		<content> The farms are isolated, but with radio
 and/or television, all keep in touch  
 with everyday affairs. The effect of  
 this showed at Gownfold Farm, where   
 the farmer's wife opened her door a   
 mere crack to ask our business.       
 Robberies and muggings today make     
 everyone wary of strange callers. Once
 sure of our purpose she was as        
 hospitable as everyone else. Tea or   
 coffee was offered and despite being  
 busy, our questions were answered     
 willingly.For women, household chores,
 gardening, providing hot meals at home
 or in the fields, fill their daytime. 
 For winter evenings there is knitting,
 television, reading, and visiting     
 other farms. A magnificent tapestry   
 now exhibited in the church was made  
 by Wisborough Green Women's Institute,
 showing landscape and houses of the   
 area, including Hawkhurst Court.      </content>
