		<title>02BUILDINGS-LUMLEY CASTLE.</title>
		<content> Set in acres of lovely woods, medieval
 Lumley Castle, owned and leased by the
 Earl of Scarborough,has been converted
 into an International Class hotel with
 luxurious amenities. In 1389 the manor
 house was licensed to be  converted to
 a castle for  Ralph, Lord Lumley.  The
 first "real"  modernization took place
 around 1721 by the architect Vanbrugh.
 In the  19th  century  the castle  was
 deserted.In the 20th  it was  restored
 and refurnished for the family,then it
 became a college of Durham and finally
 a hotel. You can  enjoy the atmosphere
 of a  medieval banquet  in the Baron's
 Hall, which is  dominated  by a  giant
 stone fireplace.  There are Conference
 Rooms &amp; rooms for private parties such
 as the elegant Garter Room. Discos are
 held in the dungeons.  One suite has a
 secret bathroom through the wardrobe!
