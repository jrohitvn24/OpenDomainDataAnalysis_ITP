 During the last 20 years farms have   
 become fewer, larger, and more        
 specialised  and some smaller farms   
 have been broken up with their houses 
 and land sold to separate buyers.     
 Hanmore farm, 245 acres has           
 traditional mixed farming with mainly 
 beef type cattle. Lower House Farm is 
 split between Sun Valley Poultry who  
 have large poultry house units and    
 Bulmers of Hereford who have 160 acres
 of modern cider orchards. Oakchurch   
 Farm is a successful PYO soft fruit   
 farm with a white Charolais herd, fat 
 lambs and corn. Kilkington(318a) all  
 cereals with a 6 yr rotation and 2    
 broiler chicken units with birds bred,
 reared and killed on the farm for sale
 to South Wales Butchers.
