 is Briggs, it has five sections,      
 household goods, grocery, toys and    
 books, a Post Office and a            
 hairdressers. Nearby there is a       
 newsagents called Earlybird, which    
 also sells groceries. There is also a 
 boutique selling ladies clothes.      
 Highmarch Stores is another grocery   
 shop which is open from 8a.m. to 8p.m.
 so that the farm workers are able to  
 do their shopping after working hours.
 The Community Centre has clubs for    
 children in the evening and is used by
 many local organisations during the   
 day. Next to this is the Parish Hall, 
 the public administration and welfare 
 centre, which is also used as the     
 entertainment centre, for public      
 meetings and for jumble sales. A very 
 popular meeting place for the farm    
 workers is the Farmer's Inn.          </content>
