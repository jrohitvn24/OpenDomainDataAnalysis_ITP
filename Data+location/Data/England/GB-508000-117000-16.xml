		<title>16W.CHILTINGTON FARMING</title>
		<content>   On July 4th W.Chiltington School 5  
 yr.olds went for a walk with Mrs.Lyne.
   "We went past a{lamb,}some{geese}and
 a{goat.}We saw a{horse}in a field.We  
 went through 2 fields, one with{wheat,
 the other with{barley}and{potatoes.}On
 the path we saw some{Rabbit}droppings 
 and then we had a rest. We got up and 
 carried on until we came to a puddle  
 with lots of flies around. In the     
 puddle was a red thing, a sort of ant 
 and I guess the flies were attracted  
 by it.Then we went on to see some{cows
{calves}and a{bull.}The cow shed was   
 mucky,it was good in there! After that
 we went into the Milking Shed to see  
 how it works. When we were looking at 
 the machine we heard a milk lorry pull
 up outside so we all went out to see  
 it.Then we saw 2{donkeys.}Our mummies 
 brought their cars and took us back to
 school."                              </content>
