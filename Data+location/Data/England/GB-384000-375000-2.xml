		<content> My group was given square number 6.We 
 were given a map and we had to find   
 the ammount of farmland, woodland,    
 roadways, buildings and water.Then we 
 had to telephone the farmers in our   
 square.This is my telephone           
 conversation "Good afternoon,my name  
 is Steven Trevor from Nether Alderley 
 School.We are doing the 1985 Domesday 
 Survey of this area so please could I 
 ask you some questions ? Would you    
 like me to ask you now,telephone back 
 later or could we come round to see   
 you ?"The questions were:What acreage 
 do you have ? How many fields have you
 ? What animals do you keep ? What     
 crops do you grow ? " Goodbye and     
 thank you for spending time with me"  
 All the farmers were very helpful     
 indeed.
