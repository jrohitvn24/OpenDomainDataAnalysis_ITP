 A mini-bus transporting staff meets   
 the service bus on the 1033 Withernsea
 to Hull Road for each staff change;   
 the first run at 0645, the last at    
 2100, running every hour in between   
 except between 1015 and 1200.  This is
 when the bus is used as free transport
 to Withernsea enabling people living  
 in the nearby Staff houses, staff and 
 patients to go shopping.  No runs are 
 operated between 1400 and 1600 hours. 
 Another bus runs between Winestead and
 Tilworth Grange Hospital in Hull      
 taking dirty laundry and exchanging   
 internal mail. At the entrance to the 
 Hospital are 10 houses, 9 of which are
 rented to staff.  The 10th house, a   
 detached 4 bedroomed building is a    
 half way house where patients, under  
 supervision are taught cooking before 
 going into supervised shared homes.   </content>
