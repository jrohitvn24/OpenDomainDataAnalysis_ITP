		<content> I was late. I got dressed, went to the
 bathroom, then ate some cereal. I went
 to school at 9.00 am. I did PE then   
 helped Babita lay out the musical     
 instruments for assembly. After play I
 made my model for the Great Air Race. 
 This is a science competition which   
 our school has entered. We have to    
 make a model from one polystyrene tile
 and one balloon. The model that       
 travels the farthest wins. I went home
 and had fish and chips for dinner.    
 School started at 1.30 pm. I worked on
 my model again. Then the boys watched 
 a video on sex education. We went home
 at 3.30 pm. I read my library book at 
 home. I went to the Mosque with my    
 cousins until 6.00 pm. I played       
 marbles with Philip, then watched TV  
 and had some food. Most of my family  
 were not eating because they were     
 fasting for Ramadan. I went to bed.   </content>
