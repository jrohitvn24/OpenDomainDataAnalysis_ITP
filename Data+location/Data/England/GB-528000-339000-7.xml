		<content> Many of the crops grown in the area   
 are still sold through traditional    
 merchant outlets. However during the  
 last decade more grower owned         
 co-operative marketing organisations  
 have been formed. As with the farms   
 themselves wholesale outlets have     
 grown in size and reduced in numbers. 
 The demand for guaranteed continuity  
 of quality and quantity have far      
 exceeded the ability of any one farmer
 to meet , so it has been to growers   
 advantage to join a group.            
{Market support}exists for some crops  
 grown in the area. This is an attempt 
 to regulate crop acres and avoid the  
 peaks and troughsof production.       
 Examples of support are the           
 intervention buying of cereals and    
 cauliflowers be the E.E.C.
