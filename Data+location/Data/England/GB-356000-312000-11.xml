		<title>11THE LOCAL SHOP</title>
		<content> THE LOCAL SHOP KEEPS A VAST RANGE OF  
 GOODS, FROM MEAT TO KNITING WOOLS. IN 
 THIS WAY IT CATERS FOR THE LOCAL NEEDS
 OF THE INHABITANTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE
 HAVE TO TRAVEL A MINIMUM OF FIVE MILES
 TO THE NEAREST TOWN. CHEESE IS A VERY 
 POPULAR ITEM, THEY SELL 90LBS OF      
 CHEESE A WEEK. MARS BARS ARE THE MOST 
 POPULART CONFECTIONERY AND CIGARETTES 
 ARE ALSO A GOOD MONEY MAKER. FRUIT AND
 VEGETABLES DO NOT MAKE SO MUCH MONEY  
 BECAUSE THEY GO BAD IF NOT QUICKLY    
 SOLD AND JUDGING THE DEMAND IS        
 DIFFICULT. THE POST OFFICE HAS A GREAT
 INFLUENCE ON THE TRADE IN THE REST OF 
 THE SHOP. WHILE PEOPLE ARE POSTING    
 LETTERS OR CASHING PENSIONS THEY WILL 
 STOP AND BUY SOMETHING FROM THE SHOP. 
 THE POST OFFICE IS ALSO THE LOCAL     
 BANK. IT IS VERY CONVENIENT TO BE ABLE
 TO GET MONEY WITHOUT THE EXPENSE OF A 
 JOURNEY INTO TOWN.                    </content>
