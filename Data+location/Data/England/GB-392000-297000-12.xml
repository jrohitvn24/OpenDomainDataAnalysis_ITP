		<content>Residents noted the improvement in     
housing, school facilities and         
amenities. They regretted the loss of  
small community atmosphere and open    
space caused by increasing             
urbanisation. Some felt that there had 
been an increase in vandalism and      
crime.                                 
There are few employment opportunities.
The larger factories have closed or    
reduced their labour force. The newer  
industrial estates have not compensated
for this loss of jobs.                 
The area is traversed by major roads   
and the increase in traffic has caused 
problems particularly for the very     
young and the old. Although industrial 
pollution has been reduced, exhaust    
fumes etc., from cars, are a growing   
problem.                               
The community has become increasingly  
cosmopolitan                           </content>
