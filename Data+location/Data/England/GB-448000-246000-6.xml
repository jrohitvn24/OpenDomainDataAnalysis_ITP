		<title>06A FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content>I get up early on a sunny June morning.
I milk the cows ready for the milk     
lorry to collect the milk from the bulk
tank. Feeding the calves is quick with 
powdered milk and a little hay.        
Breakfast time is over fast today as   
thehay mown yesterday must be turned   
and wuffled ready for baling. After    
turng the hay I fetch my dog and so in 
the landrover to check all the heifers,
bullocks, sheep and horses. After      
dinnerI start the hay but my tractor   
needs attention. The mechanic is called
and quickly repairs the fault. By tea  
time the field is baled and ready for  
the flat eight machine to put them on  
the trailer. Tomorrow all the bales    
will be elevated up into the Dutch barn
to keep the silage in place. After tea 
I again milk the cows, feed the calves 
and the dog. My day finishes at 9.00.I 
a tired but happy with my day's work.  </content>
