		<title>04A Day In My Life</title>
		<content>Friday in the morning, Mom has to come 
upstairs to wake me up. I have a       
stretch and a yawn, then I go          
downstairs in my nightshirt and my     
breakfast is waiting for me. I have    
weetabix crunched up and a cup of tea. 
Then I go to the toilet, get dressed   
and put deodorant on. I open my        
curtains and go into the bathroom where
I brush my teeth and have a wash. After
that I go back into my bedroom, put my 
earrings in and put my shoes on.I go   
downstairs, get my bag, sandwiches and 
pop, pick up my bus fare and set off to
catch the bus to school in Hednesford. 
When I get home from school I watch the
telly for a bit, then I call for my    
mates and play cricket. When the chip  
van comes we have to get the money off 
mom for the chips and eat them in the  
house. After we have had our chips we  
go to bed.                             </content>
