		<title>07GIBBET HILL WEST FLEGG</title>
		<content> We went on a walk to Gibbet Hill to   
 cover our two squares for the 1985    
 Domesday project.                     
 We hardly met any traffic because we  
 were nearly always on muddy country   
 tracks.                               
 One patch of our square was covered   
 with Blackcurrant bushes and the rest 
 of the two squares were covered with  
 arable crops, mainly wheat and barley.
 Gibbet Hill Farm was in one of our    
 squares, Dairy Barn Farm and Common   
 Farm were included as well as Martham 
 Hall.                                 
 Gibbet Hill is the highest point in   
 all the surrounding villages,although 
 it is only 17 metres above sea level. 
 Years ago they used to hang people    
 there so everyone could see them.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
