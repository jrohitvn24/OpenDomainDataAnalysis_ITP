well-known opens the carnival.It was   
held on Saturday,June 8th.They have    
lots of different events such as       
Tug-of-War and Fancy Dress.There are   
stalls of toys,plants,cakes and things 
to win.There is always a Carnival Queen
and her Attendants.They are chosen at a
disco about 2 months before the
