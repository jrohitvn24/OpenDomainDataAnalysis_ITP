		<title>16INTERVIEW WITH FISHERMAN</title>
		<content>Being a fisherman leaves you with some 
fond memories as it is a dangerous but 
exciting life.Some memorable things for
him included large catches and the     
arrival of the new lifeboat.The sea    
at Cullercoats Bay is at its calmest   
from 12:00pm to 1:00am.The main        
natural features that hinder the       
work include tides and currents.       
From his point of view the best        
thing about being a fisherman is       
the knowledge he has gained and the    
excitment,and the few bad points are   
mainly the bad hours he has to work.   
He has performed many dangerous        
rescues in his time as a member of the 
lifeboat.Cullercoats was once a main   
fishing port but now the boats have    
increased in size and decreased in     
numbers.Even though Cullercoats has    
changed he is still proud to be a      
Cullercoats boy.                       </content>
