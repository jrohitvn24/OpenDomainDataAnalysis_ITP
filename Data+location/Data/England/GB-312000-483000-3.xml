		<content> THE MAIN FOOTPATH IS WIDE AND EASY TO 
 FOLLOW RIGHT TO THE TRIANGULATION     
 POINT ON THE SUMMIT. IT STARTS FROM   
 WHICHAM CHURCH ON THE A595 JUST TO THE
 EAST OF SILECROFT. THERE IS CAR PARK  
 BY THE CHURCH AND A LANE LEADS UP TO  
 THE START OF THE PATH.                
 THE FIRST SECTION IS QUITE STEEP UP TO
 THE 900 FOOT CONTOUR WHEN IT EASES    
 SLIGHTLY FOR THE REST OF THE TWO AND A
 HALF MILE TRIP TO THE TOP.            
 THE VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT PLATEAU IS   
 EXTENSIVE AND UNOBSTRUCTED IN ALL     
 DIRECTIONS. IT PROVIDES A SUBSTANTIAL 
 VIEW NORTHWARDS TO THE SCAFELL RANGE  
 AND EASTWARD TO THE CONISTON FELLS.   
 ON A CLEAR DAY THE ISLE OF MAN, THE   
 PENNINES AND BLACKPOOL ARE VISIBLE,   
 AND IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES BOTH 
 SCOTTISH AND WELSH HILLS HAVE BEEN    
 CLEARLY IDENTIFIED.                   
                                       </content>
