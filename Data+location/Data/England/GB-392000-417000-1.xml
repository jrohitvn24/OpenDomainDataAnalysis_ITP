		<title>01Our D Block</title>
		<content> Our D Block is mostly rural- much of  
 which is rough moorland.The eastern   
 side of our area is part of the       
 Pennine Chain.Scattered about the     
 moors are lots of resevoirs which were
 constructed for the use of mills.There
 are also many disused quarries        
 scattered about the moors.            
    Also, there are lots of mills and  
 small pockets of urban developments   
 around them.There is also ribbon      
 development along the roads.Some      
 former cotten mills are not in use and
 haven't been for a long time,this     
 industry is virtually dead.Others now 
 manufacture other goods.The Rochdale  
 canal runs through our area along the 
 river valley between the hills and    
 years ago was used by the mills to    
 carry equipment.Along the valley also 
 runs a main road into Yorkshire &amp; the 
 railway.                              </content>
