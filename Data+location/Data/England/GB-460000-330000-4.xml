		<title>04FAIR</title>
		<content>     In the morning some fourth years  
 helped parents prepare the things     
 for the afternoon's event.It was touch
 and go as it rained twice before the  
 fair was scheduled to start.At 2.00pm 
 the gates opened and Mr Wicks our     
 class teacher gave us at least Â£2.00  
 float each as we needed it for the    
 games we were running.The games were a
 buzzer,how many marbles in a jar, pony
 rides,find the egg,tin cans, shoot    
 through the hole and other things.    
 There were lots of people milling     
 around,playing on the games and buying
 from the stalls.We had white          
 Elephant,Morris Dancing,Nearly New,   
 Raffle,Lucky D ip,plants,refreshments,
 toys,face painting,hair spraying,     
 disco bouncey which you bounced around
 to records in.We raised about Â£900.   
 We are spending it on a stereo and    
 play equipment for the infants.       </content>
