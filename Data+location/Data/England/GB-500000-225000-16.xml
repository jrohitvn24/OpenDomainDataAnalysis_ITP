		<content> I belong to a club that visits old    
 peoples homes and the over 60s.We have
 a stage on which we sing and dance.   
 There are twenty children in the club 
 nineteen girls and one boy called     
 Ian.Most of the songs we sing are old 
 ones like 'Its a long way to          
 Tipperary' and 'Tulips from           
 Amsterdam'.At the beginning of the    
 shows we come on one by one and sing  
 'Nik Nac'.I am number three to come   
 on.The costumes we wear consist of a T
 shirt with{Dolly mixtures}written on  
 it and a blue and white checked skirt 
 with a frill around it.The little     
 children wear pink and white checked  
 skirts and a pink ribbon in their hair
 .We have practices every Wednesday in 
 the cricket hut on the green.Another  
 girl and I do a song by ourselves     
 called 'twenty tiny fingers'.
