		<title>16Newspapers - Yardley</title>
		<content>We questioned people as to which papers
they had,why and how they were         
obtained.We found that some families   
[ about half of those asked] did not   
have a newspaper they paid for at      
all.They only received the free Daily  
News,which is a local paper but has the
greatest circulation of any free       
newspaper in Europe and second highest 
in the world.A lot of people thought   
this paper was good value[not          
surprising since it was free]even those
who paid for other papers.Generally    
people chose not to have their papers  
delivered [usually done by school      
children before and after school]but   
not because of the cost.The paper most 
bought was the Birmingham Evening Mail 
although occasionally a national paper 
was bought.Some people disliked papers 
as they were politically biased and too
full of sex and violence.              </content>
