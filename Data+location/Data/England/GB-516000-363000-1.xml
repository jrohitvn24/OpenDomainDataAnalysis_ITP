		<content> The rectangle of land under           
 consideration in the following twenty 
 pages is almost entirely agricultural 
 and woodland.It contains two villages,
 in the south east corner is Woodhall  
 Spa,a medium sized village and in the 
 north the tiny village of Stixwould.  
 Most of the significant facts in the  
 area are found in the south easterly  
 square of the rectangle.              
 The single most important factor in   
 the area is the spa waters which have 
 influenced it's development from the  
 late nineteenth century to 1985.Their 
 discovery gave birth to the village of
 Woodhall Spa and a brand new parish   
 which was made to contain it.
