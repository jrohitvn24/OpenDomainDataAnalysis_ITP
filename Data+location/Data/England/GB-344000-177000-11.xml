		<title>11BEACH SURVEY</title>
		<content>    When we went to Portishead, Mr Lang
 and a few others did a{Beach Survey . 
 Mr Lang got four sticks and stuck them
 in the ground into a shape of a       
 square.                               
     The rocks were different colours  
 purple, pink, white, black, grey,     
 orange, yellow and brown. Some rocks  
 were smooth some were round, others   
 had holes and were jagged or flat.The 
 biggest rocks were about seven inches 
 long. We also saw pieces of Quartz,and
 fossils,shell and{sharks tooth.}The   
 fossils were brown. The seaweed was   
 green with bladders. There were bits  
 of wood, bottle glass and sandgrains. 
 There were alot of insects living     
 about,such as sandhoppers,ants,water  
 fleas.There were a lot of pebbles.It  
 was very interesting to look at all   
 the different things.
