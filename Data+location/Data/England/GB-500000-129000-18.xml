{Plaistow Stores}is in a 100 year old  
 house which was once the village      
 bakery. The owners live in the        
 attached house. They sell groceries,  
 sweets, wine, newspapers and general  
 goods. It is a meeting place for local
 people.                               
                                       
{The Post Office}is at the side of the 
 village store. It was once a cottage. 
 It moved here from a Victorian house  
 near Todhurst Manor 5 years ago. They 
 also sell small antiques, seeds and   
 stationery.                           
                                       
 There is also another little shop     
 which has changed three times in      
 recent years. It was a general store, 
 then an antique shop. It is now called
{"The Spider's Web"}and sells all kinds
 of Oriental goods and jewellery.      </content>
