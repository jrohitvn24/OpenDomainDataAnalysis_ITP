 Aspatria is a small town situated     
 along a low ridge above the River     
 Ellen which flows in a south-westerly 
 direction to the south of the town.   
 This river joins the sea at Maryport  
 which is  8  miles away.Aspatria is   
 built along the main Maryport to      
 Carlisle road. The road from          
 Cockermouth to Silloth crosses this   
 road in Aspatria. Around this junction
 are old coaching inns still showing   
 evidence of the era of horse-drawn    
 travel,such as a mounting-block.      
 Also at this junction is a petrol     
 station to cater for our current form 
 of travel, the car.                   
   There are two schools in the town,  
 Beacon Hill, an 11 to 16 years old    
 comprehensive, and Richmond Hill      
 County Primary School, which is a     
 5 to 11 years old infant and junior   </content>
