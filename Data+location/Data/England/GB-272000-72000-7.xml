		<content>      Elliot's Hill School of Riding is
 based in the farm which is a medieval 
 and Victorian building. The owners    
 have farmed here since 1949. They     
 opened the stables in 1980. The school
 operates from April to October and it 
 is run by the farmer, his wife and    
 three employees. They teach ten pupils
 at a time to ride. If they take       
 clients out for a days trekking they  
 may travel 25 miles. On an hours ride 
 they may travel 3 miles on the 110    
 acre farm.                            
      The ponies are fed on oats in the
 summer and hay in the winter. Hay is  
 grown on the farm and the oats are    
 bought in Ashburton. It costs about   
 Â£15 a week to feed one pony and there 
 are about 12 of them. The riding helps
 to pay for their upkeep. Lessons cost 
 Â£3.50 per hour, Â£6.50 half a day and  
 Â£13 for a full day.                   </content>
