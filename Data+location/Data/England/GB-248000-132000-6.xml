		<title>06Employment in Fremington</title>
		<content> Employment one hundred families.      
 70% of people sent replies to our     
 questions.From this we found out      
 that 9 people work in the village,    
 52 people work in a local town and    
 9 in other places.Of these, 3 people  
 work on the land,14 work in a factory,
 18 do public service,5 work in the    
 building industry and 32 have other   
 jobs.Not very many people would like  
 to change their jobs, we found only 4 
 who would.42 families had more than   
 one adult in work at this time.       
 Those who answered all our questions  
 with a no,we counted as unemployed;   
 this amounted to only 3.Most,67% of   
 the families had someone in work.     
 Of the 30% who did not reply we can't 
 count them as unemployed because some 
 people never reply or some get lost on
 the way home.                         
                                       </content>
