		<title>19Child's average school day</title>
		<content> The children made a survey within the 
 school of every child's day during    
 term time.                            
 The survey showed that most people got
 up at around 7.30, but some got up as 
 early as 5.00 and some as late as     
 8.00.  Most children enjoyed getting  
 up. The most popular breakfast cereal 
 was Cornflakes, some people had a     
 cooked breakfast and some had toast.  
 They drank either tea, coffee, fruit  
 juice or milk.  The majority of       
 children came to school on the school 
 bus.  The remainder either came by car
 or walked.  They came from up to a    
 nine-mile radius around the school.   
 The morning sessions at school are    
 spent on maths and on language work   
 and also the children watch a few T.V.
 programmes connected with their work  
 during the week.  Most children have  
 school lunch. The rest have sandwiches</content>
