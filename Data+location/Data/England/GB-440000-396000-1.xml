		<title>01Summary of the Rawmarsh area</title>
		<content>    The area is situated to the north- 
 west of Rotherham in the county of    
 South Yorkshire. The highest point in 
 this undulating area is{Hoober Stand  
 (140m) in the north-west and the area 
 is crossed by small streams and gently
 sloping valleys.                      
    The land use is a mixture of urban 
 and rural development which reflects  
 man's use and misuse of the environ-  
 ment for his needs.                   
    To the east the housing estates of 
 the suburban fringes of{Rawmarsh}     
 reflect the changing ideas in urban   
 planning, The Dale, Monkwood, Manor   
 Farm and Thorogate. To the west,      
 surrounding the hamlets of Nether     
 Haugh and Hoober, is the parkland of  
 Earl Fitzwilliam's{Wentworth Estate}  
 where opencast mining, agriculture and
 recreational use have left their mark.
