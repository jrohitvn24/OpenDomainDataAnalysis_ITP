		<title>15RECREATION IN LUGWARDINE</title>
		<content>   The Church and the PTA of Lugwardine
 Village Primary School provide the    
 recreational activity within the      
 village. The community comes together 
 rarely - for the Church Fete on the   
 vicarage lawn in June, and St Mary's  
 R.C. School fete in July.             
   The City of Hereford provides other 
 recreational facilities, including    
 Scouts and Guides. Brownies and Cubs  
 meet in Bartestree.                   
   The majority of homes have at least 
 two television sets and video         
 recorders. 90% of houses receive a    
 daily paper - Mail, Telegraph, Express
 and Times are the most popular. A     
 variety of women's magazines are      
 ordered from the village shop,        
 together with specialist magazines.   
 Shooting and fishing are available    
 locally. Certainly the most popular   
 hobby is gardening.                   </content>
