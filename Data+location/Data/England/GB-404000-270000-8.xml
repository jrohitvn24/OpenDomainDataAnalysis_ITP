		<title>08Village Facilities</title>
		<content> Whn we inteviewed twenty six people   
 who lived in Rowney green, we asked   
 them: Are there any facilities you    
 would like which you haven't got in   
 your village? The answers varied      
 slighly.  A few people said they would
 like an off license and a church.  A  
 young mother said she would like to   
 build a primary school for her        
 children. A public telephone box was  
 asked for  because a few people in    
 Rowney Green do not have telephones in
 their houses.  But the majority of the
 population in Rowney Green wanted a   
 small village shop because the post   
 office in the village has bee closed  
 down and also Rowney Green is an      
 isolated village and if there was a   
 shop in village the people wouldn't   
 have to ravel so far to buy           
 grocerries.                           
                                       </content>
