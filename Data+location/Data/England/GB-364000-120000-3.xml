 groups that help to enrich life in    
 their own community.{Church membership
 here is comparatively high with a     
 strong monthly Young Families Service 
 at Poyntington. On an informal basis  
 newcomers are welcome and supportive  
 visits are made to sick and elderly.

 maintain the hall fabric and encourage
 local usage,like running Classes,Whist

 parties.Poyntington Hall has a pledged
 fund "Point 50"; Womens Institutes    
 offer friendship and opportunities    
 to acquire new skills,such as we are
