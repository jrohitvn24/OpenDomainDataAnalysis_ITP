		<title>19Gallows Corner Area</title>
		<content> Broadford JM&amp;I school surveyed the    
 area bisected by two main trunk roads 
 ,the A12 to Chelmsford and the A127 to
 Southend. The area is predominantly   
 residential with a large section of   
 light industry in the Ashton Road area
 Smithe and Nephew Pharmaceuticals is  
 the biggest single industry but also  
 are Havering Technical offices and the
 LEB central depot. To the East of the 
 A12 is the Bryant Avenue area. There  
 is a large area of warehousing as well
 as houses.                            
 The predominant feature in the area is
 the Gallows Corner roundabout with a  
 flyover to allow easy flow of traffic 
 for London and Southend bound traffic.
 However it doesn't appear to work and 
 frequent tailbacks occur.(See Photo)
