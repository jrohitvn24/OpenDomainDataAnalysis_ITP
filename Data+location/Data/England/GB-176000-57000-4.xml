 In a sheltered vale on the edge of the
 sand dunes is{Ellenglaze Manor.} Of   
 monastic origins,its old name was     
 Hellenclose meaning 4 halls.  This is 
 derived from the story that successive
 storms completely buried the manor    
 house under the sand-dunes together   
 with the adjacent legendary city of   
 Langarrow.                            
                                       
 Not heeding tales of a curse, the Lord
 of the Manor proceeded to build a 4th 
 house for his new bride.  However,    
 when an old witch was found hiding in 
 one of the barns he ordered that she  
 should be hanged. His young wife      
 begged that the witch's life should be
 spared and as she kissed her,the old  
 woman burst into tears which formed a 
 stream between the house and the      
 sandhills. The stream still flows.    </content>
