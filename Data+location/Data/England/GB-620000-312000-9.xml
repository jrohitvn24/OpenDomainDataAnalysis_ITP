		<content> An 70 year old resident of Hellesdon  
gave us this report:                   
 "Hellesdon was a large unspoilt County
Parish when I was a boy.The population 
was about 1,000.Reepham road was just a
cart track ,it was a large agricultural
district.The chief crops were wheat,   
barley,kale and rye.There were no      
schools in Hellesdon to begin with.The 
first school here was Heather Avenue.  
previous to that there was a school on 
the Aylsham Road boundary where there  
was a pond and a water trough for      
horses to drink from. There were a few 
old houses in Middletons lane and a    
pond at the corner of what is now      
Windsor Road and a large number of     
greenhouses on the corner. There were  
also some brickworks just off          
Middletons Lane".
