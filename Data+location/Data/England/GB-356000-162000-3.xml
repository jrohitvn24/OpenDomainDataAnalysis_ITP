		<content> There are three schools in Chew Magna 
 and a pre-school playgroup. In 1883   
 the infants were moved from the Old   
 Schoolroom to what is now the Primary 
 School and, after it was enlarged, the
 whole school was transferred in 1894. 
 Until 1958 the village school housed  
 all the village children except those 
 who went to private school.  In 1958 a
 new secondary modern school was built 
 to serve 11 villages.  This became a  
 comprehensive school in 1969 and now  
 has about 970 children on the roll.   
 It also has a good academic record and
 a fine reputation in the area.  The   
 third school, a Convent, is housed in 
 the beautiful, old, former Manor House
 which stands in 15 acres of land.     
 Unfortunately the school, started in  
 1940, is this year to lose its senior 
 department.
