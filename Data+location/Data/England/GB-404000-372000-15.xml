		<content> The High Peak College provides jobs : 
 one of its most important courses is  
 for the Catering Trade.               
 There are a number of shops in Buxton 
 which provide work such as Marks and  
 Spencer, Woolworths, Boots, Co-op, and
 W.H.Smith. Sports shops have grown up 
 in response to the growth in leisure. 
 There are also accountants, banks,    
 building societies, travel and estate 
 agencies providing employment.        
 The Hospitals which once used Buxton's
 mineral water now provide work for    
 Buxton people.People also travel in   
 from surrounding areas to work in such
 places. Perhaps it is also a          
 reflection of Buxton's climate that   
 there are no fewer than 30 property   
 repairers/damp proof contractors in   
 this small town! The most notable of  
 the light industries is one which     
 specialises in ladies' underwear.     </content>
