		<content>  The beef cattle are the male calves  
 of his dairy cows and are born between
 August and March. When they are born  
 they are fed on hay and milk.From the 
 second winter onwards they have hay   
 and kale.The farmer sells most of his 
 cattle direct to the food processors. 
 Mr.Blowey keeps 40 beef cattle.There  
 are 170 sheep on the farm.The lambing 
 season is from February to March.His  
 ewes have one or two lambs each per   
 year.During lambing the sheep are     
 brought closer to the house.The farmer
 dips his sheep twice a year in August 
 and October.The only crop grown by Mr.
 Blowey is kale which he uses to feed  
 his cattle in the winter.He grows the 
 kale as a rotational crop as it gives 
 the field a rest from growing grass   
 and leaves some goodness in the soil.
