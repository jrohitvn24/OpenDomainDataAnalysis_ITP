		<content>    A wrought iron worker in           
 Kirkandrews makes ornamental gates,   
 name plates, plant holders and        
 furniture such as bedheads. He also   
 repairs agricultural machinery for    
 local farmers.                        
    He is currently restoring two old  
 steam tractors.                       
    His workshop is the original barn  
 attached to a 1760 farm house.        
    In the winter he maintains hedges  
 and spreads fertiliser on his fields  
 which he 'lets' for grazing.          
    The local school kitchen assistant 
 retired at Easter 1985 after 32 years'
 service which consisted of setting    
 tables and supervising children       
 eating.                               
    Afterwards she would clean the     
 tables so that lessons could continue 
 whilst she went back to Burgh school  
 to wash the crockery.                 </content>
