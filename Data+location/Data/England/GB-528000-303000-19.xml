		<title>19Living in the Thorney Fens</title>
		<content>   At one time almost one-third of the 
 children in the village school        
 travelled in from the surrounding fens
 but nowadays less than one-sixth      
 arrive every morning by bus.The       
{mechanisation of farms}means{less     
{agricultural workers}are needed and   
 many of the small communities are no  
 longer there.What do the remaining few
 children think about their life on the
 fens? We asked ten of them, aged      
 between 9 and 11, to tell us a little 
 about the advantages and disadvantages
  {One of the main problems}is the{lack
{of friends to play with,}and half the 
 children would rather live in the     
 village because of this. The others   
 felt that the countryside offered so  
 much variety and interest that they   
 could manage to put up with the       
 occassional bout of loneliness.
