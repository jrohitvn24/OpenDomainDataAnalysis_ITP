		<content> LANDSCAPE AROUND STAUNTON ON WYE      
 Much of the area lies within the      
 Garnons Estate and continuity of      
 ownership  for over 200 years has     
 helped to create a beautiful unspoilt 
 agricultural landscape. Garnons       
 itself, built in about 1800 partly    
 demolished in 1957 is still a         
 beautiful and imposing house. The park
 was landscaped by Repton and still    
 contains many fine oak trees. The area
 is noted for its hardwood timber, and 
 trees and well-kept hedges still      
 abound. In 1985 Sir John Cotterell    
 gave an oak tree from the estate for  
 the rebuilding of York Minster after  
 the fire there. Staunton has a network
 of footpaths, the remnant of early    
 village trackways. It lies on a hill  
 with fine views all round. Probably   
 the best is from the church over the  
 river Wye to the Black Mountains.     </content>
