		<title>09THE CRICKETER'S ARMS</title>
		<content> The Cricketer's Arms is about four    
 hundred years old and it was once     
 three houses.The pub has a saloon bar 
 and a public bar. The fruit machines  
 and games are in the Public bar which 
 attracts the younger people while the 
 saloon bar is used by the older       
 customers.My dad is the landlord and  
 his job is to serve and do the barrels
 while my cousin and I do the          
 bottling-up.                          
     The top half of the pub is owned  
 by my nanny who is the                
 landlady.Upstairs, it is easy to see  
 the age of the pub.                   
      In the garden there is a well    
 which used to serve the three         
 houses.There is lots of old, broken   
 china in the soil.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
