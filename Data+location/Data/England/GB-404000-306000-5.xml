		<content>   A survey on leisure time conducted  
amongst third year pupils of Chasetown 
High School showed that various sports 
e.g.football,cycling and horse riding, 
were the most popular.                 
   Nearly as many pupils,however,spent 
most of their leisure time watching T.V
or visiting friends and relitives.Most 
pupils had to be back home between 9.30
and 10.00p.m.,although a few were able 
to stay out late.All pupils received   
pocket money with the majority having  
one pound per week or less.A fortunate 
few received more than five pounds per 
week.Nearly all pocket money was spent 
on leisure related activites.An example
of these activities are swimming,ball  
sports,records and magazines.Others    
simply saved their money in a bank for 
special occasions.As sports facilites  
may cost quite a lot,people often save 
to hire them.                          </content>
