		<title>18       FARMING</title>
		<content>  Over 80% of our area consists of farm
 land.All the farms are small_just a   
 house and a few outbuildings_and there
 is only one small settlement which is 
 called{Haywood.Haywood}has a church   
 and a few houses.The farming is a     
 mixture of arable and dairy farming.  
 The chief crops are{wheat}and{barley  
 although we did see some{potatoes.    
 Many fields were planted with grass   
 for grazing or for silage. The cows   
 which were kept were all{Friesians.   
 None of the farms keep sheep but we   
 did see a number of goats grazing by  
 the roadside.                         
          Most farms will have their   
 own tractor,plough etc but large      
 machinery such as{combine harvesters  
 would be hired.Although we live in a  
 mechanical age,some farmers are going 
 back to using horses either for       
 economical or environmental reasons.  </content>
