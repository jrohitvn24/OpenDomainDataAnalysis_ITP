		<content> Mrs H.House is a teacher at this      
 School she told us that O &amp; J House   
 have been in Pimperne for fifteen     
 years.They make landscapes and lakes  
 using very big machines called        
 J.C.B.s.They also sell Tandy          
 micro-computers. Tandy is an American 
 computer. It is very hard work and Mr 
 House and his twenty two employees    
 work very long hours.Some years ago a 
 very old thatched barn was burnt down 
 by some boys playing with matches.Mrs 
 House told us that she does not like  
 computers,she likes teaching and      
 people much better.
