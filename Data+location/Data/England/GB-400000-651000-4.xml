		<title>04BERWICK LIFEBOAT CREW</title>
		<content> The inshore lifeboat needs a crew of  
 four to six people.They are all       
 volunteers who have other jobs and    
 have to be ready to come as soon as   
 they hear  the bang of the maroons.   
 One bang means     STAND BY           
 Two bangs mean     RESCUE             
 Three bangs mean   RESCUE,COASTGUARD  
                    NEEDED AS WELL.    
 The men can join the crew as soon as  
 they are eighteen years old and       
 because the conditions are often hard 
 they  have to leave when they are     
 forty five.They practice              
 regularly,lauching and rescuing       
 drills.They wear one_piece            
 wetsuits,life jackets with whistles   
 attached and orange helmets called    
 'Bump caps'rather like jockeys.
