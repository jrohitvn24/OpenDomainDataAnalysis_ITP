  This block is a quiet,rural area with
 few dwellings.However,it is close to  
 two main roads.To the North is the    
 road from Brampton to Longtown.To the 
 West is the road from Carlisle to     
 Longtown.These roads have houses and  
 some amenities at intervals.          
  Across the Southeast corner of the   
 block runs the road from Carlisle to  
 Scaleby.Along it,at intervals,are the 
 main groups of farmhouses and farm    
 buildings.One of the farms now has a  
 caravan site for tourists and a small 
 recreation hall for local use.        
  The only other collection of         
 dwellings in this block is the village
 of Scalebyhill.(See page 4).
