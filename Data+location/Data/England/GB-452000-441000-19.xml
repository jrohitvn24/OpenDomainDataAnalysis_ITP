 noticeboard for jobs,sales &amp; wanted   
 adverts and forthcoming events.

 a limited turnover,so it cannot       
 compete with big supermarkets but as  
 it is the only shop and is bigger than
 the small shop at Bolton Percy it has 
 a good trade in "last minute",or "run 
 out of " groceries.                   
   It sells fruit,vegetables,bread,toys
 sweets.tights,medicines,ices,cards,tea
