		<content> A railway station was opened in       
 Downton by Lady Nelson. At the end of 
 the 19th century there was a railway  
 disaster one mile south of Downton at 
 Pile Bridge. Seven carriages crashed  
 and many people were injured. Reverend
 Bunbury was in the second carriage and
 at his next visit to Downton thanked  
 God that he was a survivor. The       
 railway was closed on May 2nd, 1964.  
 That Saturday, nearly 100 children    
 under 11 years went on the last train 
 journey to Braemore, arriving exactly 
 on time. There was a scare when thick 
 smoke was seen coming from the boiler 
 and people thought that the engine    
 might blow up. Despite the additonal  
 weight of children the journay was    
 made in record time and several       
 hazards successfully negociated. The  
 track has never been used since.
