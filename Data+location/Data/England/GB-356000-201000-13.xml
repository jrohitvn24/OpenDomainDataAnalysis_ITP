		<title>13Clanna  Pond</title>
		<content>  {Clanna Pond }is very popular because
 there are quite a few different ways  
 to get there but you can only go {half
{way}with the car.All of the streams   
 lead to the {River Severn}.In one part
 of a stream there are some places you 
 can paddle and dangle your feet off a 
 bridge.They are now renewing the old  
 muddy path to a {new} path.There are  
 quite a few {living }things in the    
 pond like trout,frogs,tadpoles and    
 ducks and around it like deer,rabbits 
 and pheasants.A lot of people go {    
{fishing }and {picnicking }there.It is 
 very nice to look at it from the side 
 because you can see most of it.There  
 are about three little wooden bridges 
 over the little streams.You would see 
 a lot of wood pigeons around in the   
 fir trees .There are quite a lot of   
{bluebells}mixed with{stitchwort}in the
 spring.                               </content>
