		<title>19RECREATION: THE GOLF CLUB.</title>
		<content>   A major aspect of land use in this  
 area concerns recreation; especially  
 that of numerous cricket and golf     
 clubs in Bowdon, Hale and Ashley.     
 Typical of such clubs on the fringe of
 these richer suburbs is{Ringway Golf  
{Club, Hale Barns.}In l984 this        
 particular club celebrated its 75th.  
 anniversary. In l929 the club occupied
 ll2 acres next to Easterlane Farm on  
 Ashley Road, but was only made into   
 l8 holes in l960. Nevertheless it is a
 popular and competitive club with many
 social functions, a demanding course  
 and prizes awarded for snooker and    
 bowls as well as golf. The Committee  
 maintains the rural character of the  
 area by planting trees and shrubs; not
 just to protect nearby houses! The    
 modernised club house and large mixed 
 lounge overlooks sycamore, oaks,      
 silver birch and the hills beyond.    </content>
