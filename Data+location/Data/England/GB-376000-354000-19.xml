		<content> Christmas in Alsager at the begining  
 of the century was very different from
 the present commercialized scene. Then
 the nights were silent and the mere   
 often frozen. Skaters and curlers     
 thronged the ice. Mr. Band perched    
 high in his cab drawn by two handsome 
 chestnut horses made a traditional    
 Christmas scene. The lamplighter could
 be seen doing his rounds with his long
 hooked pole and children pressed their
 faces against the candle-lit windows  
 gazing at penny lucky buys, small toys
 and dolls.                            
 Christmas to-day has high media       
 coverage. Advertisments are for our   
 attention. The Christmas tree outside 
 the library is lit with electric light
 bulbs. Shops decorated with artifical 
 snow and plastic decorations bulge    
 with electronic gadgets  and expensive
 toys.                                 </content>
