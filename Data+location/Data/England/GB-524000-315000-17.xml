		<title>17A DAY IN THE LIFE -continued</title>
		<content>      During the afternoon we do       
 projects, arts and crafts, music or   
 sport and at 15.30hrs we put our      
 chairs on the tables and go home.     
      After a cup of tea I go outside  
 to play until our evening meal which  
 all the family eat together when my   
 dad gets home. After tea I play or    
 watch television until bed time at    
 about 21.00hrs. I wash my hair every  
 other day because it is 66cms long and
 I dry it with a hand held hair dryer.I
 often have a hot drink at bedtime and 
 after a wash and I have cleaned my    
 teeth I read for about half an hour.As
 I collect soft toys there is not much 
 room for me in bed as I have about 15 
 of them.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
