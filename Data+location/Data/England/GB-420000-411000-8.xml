		<title>08EMLEY MOOR MAST</title>
		<content> A group of people in our class went to
 the mast and Paul Sykes went up to the
 top of it. They all brought back some 
 information on the mast. Emley Moor   
 mast is the biggest mast of its kind  
 in the whole of Europe. Its height is 
 an outstanding 330 metres or 1084     
 feet. There have been three previous  
 masts in the same place as the present
 one. One of the previous masts fell   
 down in March 1969 because the        
 stabilising cables froze and the ice  
 was so heavy the mast fell down.      
 Although the mast fell through a      
 nearby chapel roof no-one was hurt.   
 The building of the present mast      
 started in June 1969 and was finished 
 in 1970. The mast started transmitting
 again in 1971 and has been on the air 
 with programmes and radio services for
 13 years since it was rebuilt.
