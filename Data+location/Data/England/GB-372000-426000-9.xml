		<content> The area of the survey includes the   
 township of Church and parts of       
 Oswaldtwistle and Accrington and is   
 situated on the northern edge of the  
 Rossendale Forest.                    
 Church and Oswaldtwistle are ancient  
 settlements and written evidence of   
 their existence goes back to the l3th 
 century.                              
 Originally a very small farming       
 settlement it became involved in wool 
 and weaving during Tudor Times.  In   
 the Elizabethan Times the townships   
 were still very small with only 227   
 inhabitants.                          
 In the l8th century development was   
 rapid owing to the techinical         
 achievements of local inventor James  
 Hargreaves and the business drive of  
 the Peel family.                      
 James Hargreaves was born at          
 Stanhill within Oswaldtwistle in 1720 </content>
