		<title>03Shepshed-Growing Population</title>
		<content>    A{Charnwood Borough}survey in 1981 
 showed that{Shepshed}was one of the   
 fastest growing towns in              
{Leicestershire.}The population in{1951
 was just over{6000.}By{1981}this      
 number had grown to{11000,}and the    
 council predicts that by{1991}there   
 will be{13500}people living in        
 Shepshed. We can see evidence  of this
 growth in the large number of new     
 houses being built. Most of the new   
 developments are near the{motorway    
{junction.}All the houses are built of 
{brick,}but there is an interesting    
 variety of styles, from four_bedroomed
 detached houses to two_bedroomed      
 terraced "starter homes",and flats for
 single people .Alot  of bungalows are 
 being built ,which are popular with   
 old people .Modern energy saving      
 features such as insulation, are      
 included in all types of houses.      </content>
