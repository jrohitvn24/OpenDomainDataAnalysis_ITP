		<title>12CHURCH STRETTON MARKETS</title>
		<content>   In {1671}a magnificent black and    
 white building  was built.            
 It was built from timber and plaster. 
 But it was sadly burnt down in {1839}.
                                       
   Then in {1840} a second market hall 
 was built. It was built from stone and
 brick. It was considerd ugly and      
 unsafe, so they demolished it in{1958.
                                       
   Today's present market is just an   
 open space. It is used for a car park 
 except {Thursdays}because that is     
 market day. There are many stalls     
 like: fish, cheese, bacon, eggs, home 
 made pies, cakes, jam, sweets,        
 household goods, vegetables, fruit and
 a few others.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
