		<content>    J.Sainsbury's store is situated on 
 Woodchurch Road in Prenton. It was    
 opened in March 1982.                 
    Many{products}are sold, such as    
 fresh and cooked meats, canned foods, 
 fruit and vegetables, frozen foods,   
 packet foods, beverages, etc.         
 Altogether there are 7000 different   
 lines.                                
    There are 300{employees,}some full 
 time and others working part time. The
 ratio of female to male staff is 4:1. 
    Shoppers are mostly local people,  
 but before the opening of the Chester 
 store, customers would travel from as 
 far afield as{North Wales.}Since the  
 store opened, it has been very        
 successful. In fact it is a{'Group A' 
 store.                                
    In one week 27% of the customers   
 shop at Sainsbury's on a Friday, and  
 Monday is the quietest day.           </content>
