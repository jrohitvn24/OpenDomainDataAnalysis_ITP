		<content> This page shows some of the results of
 a survey into the attitudes of local  
 people to some aspects of modern life.
                                       
   {Conservation} everyone I spoke to  
 said that we should have more         
 conservation of the wildlife around   
 our area                              
                                       
  {Television} nearly all the people in
 our village said that they dont mind }
 about television.A few said it was    
 very good but not many.               
                                       
 The majority of people seem quite     
 happy with the way most of these      
 aspects of modern life are moving they
 are worried by unemployment and lack  
 of care over nature.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
