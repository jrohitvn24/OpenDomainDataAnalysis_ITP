		<title>11ALONG THE RIVER GREAT OUSE.</title>
		<content>  On Thursday May 16th. 1985,eleven    
 children and two teachers from        
 Winhills County Junior School, St.    
 Neots went on a boat trip along the{  
{River Great Ouse}from the River Mill  
 lock at Eaton Socon to the Anchor     
 Hotel at Tempsford, a distance of four
 miles  in each direction. The narrow  
 boat left the boat_yard at            
 1.30pm and went upstream  passing the 
 point where the{St. Neots Bypass}     
 will cross the river, and then{Little 
{Barford Power Station}which is now    
 closed down. The children saw the work
 on the new bridge. After one hour ten 
 minutes the boat passed under two     
 bridges carrying the A1. Just beyond  
 there the boat was turned round for   
 the journey home. Before reaching the 
 boat_yard the narrow boat had to go   
 through the{Eaton Socon Lock.}What a  
 good trip.                            </content>
