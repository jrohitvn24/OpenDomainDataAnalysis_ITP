		<content>{Earls Colne}seems a very big village  
 because it is so spread out.Earls     
 Colne has a{Primary School}a{Church   
 and a{Sports Centre}with Badminton,   
 Squash and Tennis coarts.It has a     
 population of about 2000 and 275      
 children attend the Primary School.   
         The school was built in 1983  
 so that the children didn't have to go
 from one building to another.         
         The Sports Centre was built   
 out of money from a will left by W.A  
 Hunt.Mr.Hunt had lived in the village 
 all his life and he had started Earls 
 Colnes only factory{Hunts}.           
         Earls Colne is twinned with a{
 French town called{Nonancourt}.
