		<content>{    Mountsorrel},pop.6o50,and{Rothley 
 Pop.5000 8(est)are two villages linked
 by the A.6  and  the B5351.           
 Mountsorrel has a massive Quarry  and 
 the {Rolls Royce}factory of famous    
 name is on the boundary.              
 Rothley has 10 small factories.       
 Farmland separates both villages.     
 Private houses cost more in Rothley.  
 There is new residential building in  
 the central area. There  is  local    
 authority housing in both villages.  {
    Recent parish boundary changes     
{have  been  hotly fought  over.}Each  
 village has its own excellent Primary 
 School,Mountsorrel's roll is 241 and  
 Rothley's is 227.{Despite traditional 
{rivalry  between villages (for each   
{village wants to keep its own         
{identity) there is some inter-school  
{and inter-church co-operation.This    
{project for the BBC is a good example.</content>
