		<content> Before nationalisation, in 1946, all  
 the mines were privately owned.  A Mr.
 Charlesworth owned quite a few of the 
 pits in this area, most of which were 
 named after his daughters.  Now_a_days
 open cast mining is more prevalent in 
 Woodlesford and Oulton, than          
 underground mining.  Open cast changes
 the face of the landscape by          
 re_routing rivers and literally moving
 mountains; but when the coal runs out,
  re_landscapes immediately.  Whereas  
 underground mining leaves scars which 
 take many years to disappear, e.g.    
 slag heaps and lift shafts still      
 evident after 20 years of closure.    
 Mining creates a "transient"          
 community.  As one pit closes the     
 workers are sent to others.  Often    
 this means a move for the entire      
 family, as happened with the recent   
 closure of Rothwell "Fanny" pit.      </content>
