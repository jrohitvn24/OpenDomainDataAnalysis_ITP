		<title>10Farming Near Goonhavern</title>
		<content> Most farms around us have a mixture of
 allsorts.A lot of people produce      
 beef,corn and silage.The main breed of
 beef cattle used is Fresian which     
 produces good quality meat.This year  
 there is a lot of wheat,barley,oats   
 and dredge corn.There is a large      
 amount of peas which have large       
 flowers that are fed to the livestock 
 to help their digestive               
 system.Potatoes are also grown both   
 for marketing and for feeding         
 cattle.Quite a lot of kale is grown   
 for sheep and cattle to graze at.Some 
 of the farm do not have mains         
 electricity and are powered by        
 generators.A number do not have mains 
 drains either and have cess pits      
 instead.The farming community here is 
 very friendly.Tourists enjoy          
 holidaying on the farms as well.
