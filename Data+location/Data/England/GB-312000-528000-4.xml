		<content> Every Monday at Mitchell's Auction    
 Co.Ltd.,Station Street, there are     
 sales  of fatstock and sheep. About   
 400  bullocks can be auctioned in one 
 morning as farmers bring them from all
 over Cumbria.                         
 There are two halls,one for cattle,the
 other for sheep. The livestock are    
 brought into the ring where the       
 Auctioneer has a stand. He is well    
 known as he is Managing Director of   
 the Company. Bidding is rapid and     
 farmers signal by a move of the hand  
 or a nod of the head. The fatstock are
 sold for slaughter at 115p per Kg. The
 Company has its own abattoir and      
 twelve local butchers buy stock for   
 their shops.                          
 Farmers and their wives spend the day 
 shopping and conducting business in   
 the town. The noise of cattle and     
 sheep can be heard all day.           </content>
