		<content>  At{Kingsgate Farm}Mr. Luethi has 2   
 tractors, 1 old and 1 new.  He has 13 
 acres of pasture for sheep and cattle 
 which also eat hay and nuts.  There 22
 acres of woodland as well as 2 acres  
 of farm buildings.  Mr. Luethi grows  
 maize; he has a special combine to    
 harvest it which is the only one in   
 the country.  Instead of oil seed     
 rape, Mr. Luethi is growing sunflowers
 for oil this year for the first time. 
  At{Bates Farm}most of the buildings  
 are old with the addition of 2 purpose
 built grain stores; there is an old   
 bull pen which is now a stable. There 
 are 7 tractors and 1 combine, 5 of    
 them are up to date, 2 are not. The   
 farm is 600 acres in all, but only 200
 acres are in Wittersham, the rest in  
 New Romney.  We saw 3 calves which    
 were bought in Ashford Market on 13th 
 May 1985.                             </content>
