		<title>16People and Beliefs in Dunmow</title>
		<content>   The people of Dunmow are            
 overwhelmingly of the white ethnic    
 majority; the exceptions being a few  
 Vietnamese and the families running   
 the Indian restaurants and Chinese    
 "take away".                          
   From a questionnaire it was found   
 that the majority of the junior school
 pupils believe in God and that God    
 made man.  Very few attend church but 
 many said that they would send their  
 own children to Sunday school.  School
 assembly was unpopular, especially    
 hymn singing.                         
   Many old people were found to       
 believe in life after death but only  
 50% believe in God.                   
   There is a thriving Roman Catholic  
 community in Dunmow and a small strict
 Baptist community.
