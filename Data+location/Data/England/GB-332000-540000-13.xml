		<title>13Education in Sebergham</title>
		<content>    Primary education is provided in   
 the neighbouring village of Welton and
 Secondary education in Dalston some   
 seven miles away.  Transport is by way
 of private buses.                     
    Adult education is also available  
 in the afternoons or evenings at      
 Dalston and Carlisle.                 
    Some families send their children  
 to a privately owned and run school in
 Wigton, a former convent, or to the   
 major and minor public schools.       
    Farmers children are increasingly  
 remaining at school until 17 or 18    
 rather than returning to work at home 
 at the earliest opportunity.  This is 
 a changing and englightened attitude  
 which comes about from the more       
 scientific nature of farming today.   
    Few farmers send their children on 
 to agricultural college or university.
