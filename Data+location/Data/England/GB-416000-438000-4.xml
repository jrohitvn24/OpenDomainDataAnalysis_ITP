 For years jokers have been giving the 
 best directions to get to Esholt-     
 "just follow your nose"-for the name  
 which means{ashwood}took on a less    
 sweet meaning with the arrival of the 
 sewage treatment complex completed in 
 1932.It became synonymous with odour, 
 smell,pong,niff,whiff,and other,much  
 more uncomplimentary remarks.Many     
 words were less euphemistic and more  
 vivid,depending on where you were     
 standing,and which way the wind was   
 blowing.On a foggy day the odour      
 arising from Esholt Hall Estate,where 
 Bradford's sewage treatment works were
 built,clings and hovers round.        
 Way back in 1937,people living in     
 Rawdon,Apperley Bridge,and as far away
 as Windhill,Idle and Thackley were    
 locking their doors and windows and   
 pegging up their noses.               </content>
