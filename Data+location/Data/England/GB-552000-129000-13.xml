		<content> Crowborough and Rotherfield are quite 
 well supplied with shops.Rotherfield  
 has 17 which cover the needs of the   
 village.Some, like the Chemists have  
 been trading since the end of the 19th
 century.Jarvis Brook has a varied     
 selection of small shops.On the way to
 Rotherfield is a Garden Centre which  
 sells pond life, plants and flowers.  
 Poisonous insecticides are also sold  
 but a special licence is needed .     
 They buy their plants from nurseries  
 in York or as far away as Holland. The
 Crowborough Chamber of Trade have en_ 
 couraged the opening of a new shopping
 precinct and shopping arcade in the   
 centre of Crowborough.However, in     
 spite of a fairly wide variety of     
 shops and goods available, people need
 to travel further afield to Brighton, 
 Eastbourne &amp; Tunbridge Wells to       
 purchase larger items like furniture. </content>
