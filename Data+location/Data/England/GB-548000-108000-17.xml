		<title>17Transport in Ripe.</title>
		<content>      Trains run once every hour from  
 Berwick, 3 miles South of Ripe. This  
 line goes to London, Brighton and     
 Hastings. Buses run infrequently from 
 Firle or Laughton both 3 miles distant
 so nearly everybody travels by private
 car. Owning a car is quite an expense 
 as it has to conform to M.O.T.        
 standards which means regular         
 servicing and high garage bills. Also 
 to pass the driving test one needs    
 many driving lessons and even then not
 everyone can get through the test. The
 alternative is motorbike or pushbiike.
 The roads, although only C. roads are 
 well maintained by the County         
 Council.The ramblers association looks
 after some of the footpaths and many  
 are rights of way so walking is       
 another way of getting about and also 
 a recreation. Also there are many     
 horse riders and ponies and carts.    </content>
