		<title>03CAR PARK</title>
		<content> There is on car park  at Aldingham and
 about  ten  cars  could fit on it. The
 car  park  is   next  to  the   public
 toilets. Also there is a shelter which
 looks  out to sea. There is one bin on
 the  car  park.  The car park is owned
 by the church. During a church service
 you can not park on it unless you  are
 going to church. When there is  not  a
 church service  you  can  park  on it.
 Also there are railings round the  car
 park to stop you from crashing  on  to
 the beach because  there  is  a  drop.
 There   are   a  number  of  different
 varieties   of  trees   to   keep   it
 sheltered from the wind and rain.  The
 toilets and car park are mainly  there
 because the public use the  beach  for
 recreation.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
