		<content> There was a small settlement at       
 Chilton Cantelo at the time of the    
 Norman Conquest. Indeed the Manor was 
 given to the de Canteloup family as a 
 reward for their part in the Conquest.
 The word Chilton is thought to derive 
 from the word Churls Town which would 
 indicate that it was an inaccessible  
 place set among the marshes where     
 escaped Churls or servants took       
 refuge. The original Domesday book    
 records 28 houses in the village.     
 There are three more today.           
 The moat field in Marston Magna is the
 site of a Medieval Manor House. The   
 moat was built not for defence but for
 artistic qualities. There were fish   
 ponds which acted as a source of food 
 for the inhabitants. These were fed by
 a stream which can be seen today. The 
 next field shows an example of ridge  
 and furrow farming.                   </content>
