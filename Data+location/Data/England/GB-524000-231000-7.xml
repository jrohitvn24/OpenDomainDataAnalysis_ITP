		<content>    The central area of Baldock,       
 comprising Hitchin St, Church St,     
 White Horse St, and most of High St is
 designated a conservation area.       
 Baldock is one of five towns in       
 Hertfordshire listed by the Council   
 for British Archaeology as being of   
 national importance.                  
    St Mary the Virgin Church is listed
 A1 and there are 10 Grade II*, 135    
 Grade II, and 29 buildings of local   
 importance.                           
    Hitchin St and Church St contain   
 buildings of 16th and 17th Century    
 with timber frames and plaster work.  
 White Horse St and High St have many  
 buildings of the Georgian period,     
 representing a time when the town was 
 prosperous due to the malting and     
 brewing industry in the town and also 
 the development of the coaching trade 
 on the Great North Road in the 18th C.</content>
