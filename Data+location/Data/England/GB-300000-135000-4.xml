		<title>04Beef Farming</title>
		<content>      In England Roast Beef is a       
 favourite meal the farmer tries to    
 provide our needs by Stock Rearing.   
 On Mr. Takle's Farm at Treborough we  
 saw some young calves being reared for
 their meat.   It will be fattened up  
 and sold as beef wehn it is between   
 one and two years old.                
      The catlle on Treborough Farm are
 all beef cattle but there are a       
 variety of breeds for this purpose.   
 Mr. Takle keeps a Charolais Bull but  
 has got North Devon crossed with      
 Hereford and also Hereford and Angus  
 cows crossed with Fresian.            
      On the highest land the grass is 
 of too poor a quality to support      
 anything other than sheep.   Mr. Takle
 keeps a flock of Suffolk cross sheep.
