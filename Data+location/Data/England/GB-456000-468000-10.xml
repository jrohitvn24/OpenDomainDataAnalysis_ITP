		<title>10Crops in the Area</title>
		<content> Most farming is arable, there area  a 
 few dairy herds, Friesians and        
 Holsteisn on the whole. Some people   
 rear bullocks for beef and farm sheep 
 mainly for meat with the by product of
 wool from the Fleece.                 
 The arable farming consists of mainly 
 cereals and root crops. A small       
 proportion of land cover is hay,      
 silage and strip grazing but this land
 cover is cultivated and the proportion
  of actual meadowland is very small.  
 The crops consist of varying acreages 
 of following, but these are governed  
 by various marketing brands as to hw  
 much can actually be grown.           
 Largely barley and wheat, sugar beet  
 and potatoes, rape, oats, kale,       
 mangolds, peas and beans are grown in 
 much smaller quantities andmainly as  
 crop rotation.                        
                                       </content>
