		<title>11BISHOPTHORPE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Bishopthorpe is a small village to the
 south of York.  It has developed      
 around Archbishop's Palace.  Main     
 Street is the oldest area of housing  
 and a lot of the houses there are     
 Victorian or earlier.  In the last    
 twenty years there has been a lot of  
 house building, and most of the people
 travel in to York to work.            
 The village has its own modern        
 library, and the Infant and Junior    
 schools have both been built in the   
 last twenty years.  The old school is 
 used as a Youth Club, and for the     
 Toddler Group.  The village also has  
 its own shops, where most things can  
 be bought, a petrol filling station,  
 and several pubs on Main Street.  It  
 also has a Methodist Church as well as
 St. Andrew's.
