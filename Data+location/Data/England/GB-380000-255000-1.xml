		<content> The study area includes the villages  
 of Upper and Lower Broadheath and is  
 situated north-west of the city of    
 Worcester. It is characteristically an
 area of pasture and arable farming    
 which is increasingly influenced by   
 the close proximity of the city, of   
 which the South Western portion of the
 study area is within the city         
 boundary.                             
 The larger of the two villages lower  
 Broadheath provides a focal point for 
 the community, with the services of   
 primary school, church and village    
 stores/post office, whist the smaller 
 hamlet of upper Broadheath provides   
 high class housing centers around     
 avast village green. Within the hamlet
 of upper Broadheath is a museum of    
 artifacts at the birthpalce of the    
 famous composer Sir Edward Elgar which
 is a major tourist attraction.        </content>
