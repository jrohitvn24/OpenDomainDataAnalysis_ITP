		<content> In our twelve squares there are three 
 main shopping areas,apart from the    
 Town Centre,Bush Fair,Staple Tye and  
 Potter Street.There are also 10       
 hatches which are smaller areas       
 consisting of 3 or 4 shops.Most of the
 people seem to visit the town centre  
 once a week for their main shop but   
 found their local shopping areas very 
 convenient and probably visit these   
 about three times a week.In general we
 found the local areas were slightly   
 more expensive than the town centre.  
 Our favourite shop was the joke and   
 hire-a-costume shop.The owner said    
 that she started off by selling jokes 
 and then introduced costumes.She now  
 has over 100,the most popular being   
 the French maid and the gorilla.Her   
 busiest times of the year are         
 Christmas and halloween.
