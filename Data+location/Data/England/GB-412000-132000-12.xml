		<content> WITHIN THE BLOCK WE HAVE THE OLD CITY 
 OF SALISBURY - OLD SARUM WHICH IS A   
 POPULAR PLACE FOR TOURISTS TO VISIT.  
 IT IS VERY CLOSE TO THE CITY AND IS ON
 AN EASY ROUTE FOR WALKING FROM THE    
 CENTRE OF THE CITY.  LOCAL BUS        
 COMPANIES HVE FREQUENT SERVICES TO THE
 SITE.  THE RIVER AVON FLOWS THROUGH   
 THE BLOCK AND ALTHOUGH MUCH OF ITS    
 LENGTH IS CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE       
 FISHING CLUBS DAY LICENCES CAN BE     
 PURCHASED AND GOOD FISHING IS         
 AVAILABLE.                            
 THE SITE OF THE ELECTIONS WHEN OLD    
 SARUM WAS A ROTTEN BOROUGH IS MARKED  
 BY A COMMEMMORATIVE STONE AND THIS    
 IS ON A FREQUENTLY USED WALK.  THERE  
 ARE SEVERAL OLD HOUSES - SOME         
 THATCHED - AND THE VILLAGE IS ON A    
 PICTURESQUE ROUTE TO STONEHENGE.  THE 
 WILTSHIRE CYCLEWAY IS ROUTED THROUGH  
 THE VILLAGE AND THE WOODFORD VALLEY.  </content>
