		<content>    The village housing has increased  
 greatly but not so the population.    
 This has mainly been due to the type  
 of development which was tailored     
 towards the greater wealth of "London"
 people, many of whom are retired.     
    This has led to major problems in  
 village life.  The original close knit
 community which is very warm hearted  
 was confronted with elderly people who
 wanted total privacy, or affluent     
 families who expected the amenities   
 they had in city life and more. The   
 new inhabitants to a large degree     
 expected the community to fit in with 
 them and not themselves fitting into a
 rural environment.                    
    Another major division is between  
 the young and old.  The teenage       
 bracket of the population find        
 themselves with little to do. To solve
 the problems needs a unified approach.</content>
