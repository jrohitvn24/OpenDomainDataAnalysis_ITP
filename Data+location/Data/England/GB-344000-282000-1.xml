		<content> Part of the limestone Wenlock Edge,   
 running NE-SW and reaching a height of
 334m at Callow Hill and 290m at Norton
 Camp to the southwest. There is not   
 much surface water, but a streat      
 breaks through the scarp and one of   
 two streams, flowing off the dip      
 slope, is at the lowest point, about  
 120m in the southeast corner. The few 
 valleys in this rolling area are used 
 by 2 lanes which are linked by        
 another, below and parallel to the    
 higher of the 2 scarp faces. Castle   
 Road, the B4368 from Craven Arms to   
 Bridgnorth, uses another valley,      
 attains a height of 170m and maintains
 this on the dip. There is a hamlet at 
 one of the lane junctions and most of 
 the other farms and cottages, some of 
 stone, lie along the B road; it is    
 thinly populated. The farming is      
 mainly arable - cereals and turnips - </content>
