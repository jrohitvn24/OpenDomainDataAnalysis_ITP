 middle of the playground and calls the
 name of one in the line.That child has
 to run across the playground.If he is 
 caught he is "on" with the person in  
 the middle.If he is not caught the    
 others run across the playground.The  
 first of these to be caught is "on".  
 Boneo:a game for at least 6.Two       
 children are "on".One stands at the   
 wall,the other chases the rest.When   
 one is caught he has to put his hand  
 up against the wall.The one who is    
 "on"stops the others from going under
