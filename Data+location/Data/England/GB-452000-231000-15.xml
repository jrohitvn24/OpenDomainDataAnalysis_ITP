		<title>15CROUGHTON PARISH COUNCIL 1</title>
		<content> There are 9 members of the council,   
 elected every 5 years. It is difficult
 to find replacements as members retire
 or resign. There has not been an      
 election for many years, and new      
 members have to be co-opted by the    
 council.  As a parish council is the  
 only non political form of government 
 in the UK, party politics do not enter
 into discussions.  The Parish Council 
 is a very important part of local     
 government, forming a link between the
 village, South Northants District     
 Council and the County Coucil.        
 Councillors are unpaid, and meet      
 monthly in the evenings at the school.
 The Parish Council owns and maintains 
 the street lighting, the cemetry,     
 allotments and the children's         
 playground.  It owns but does not     
 control the Playing Fields, (where a  
 new pavilion was built this year).    </content>
