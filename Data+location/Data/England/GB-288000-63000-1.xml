		<title>01A Favourite Park in Torquay</title>
		<content> My favourite place is the park across 
 the road because we can go there and  
 ride our bikes away from the traffic. 
 In the summer when our Guest House is 
 full we play hide and seek in amongst 
 the plants. It's safe because mum can 
 see us from the dining room window.   
 When our Guest House is empty, mum    
 sometimes takes us to the park for an 
 ice lolly or a picnic instead of the  
 beach.                                
 I like lying in the sun so that I get 
 sunburnt. My cat comes across         
 sometimes and we roll in the grass    
 playing with her.                     
 It's quite a big park and even though 
 it says 'No ball games', I know the   
 park keeper and he lets us play them  
 anyway.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
