<title>24Housing</title>
<content>Housing associations now do the job of the council with regards to housing. Almost all the council high-rise flats have now gone, and new private apartment blocks have appeared in their place. Many residential area's have been dominated by student housing. The Smithdown road area of Wavertree is now primarily a student area. Council estates have now become more private residential area's due to people using the right to buy to purchase their council house. Today we power our homes mainly using electricity and gas. Electricity is getting more expensive.&lt;br />
