		<title>03CORNISH HEDGEROWS</title>
		<content> A typical Cornish hedge is built      
 mostly of local stone, wider at the   
 base than at the top with an infill of
 earth through the middle.The top      
 course of stones, called{copestones}or
{Jack and Jill}are often placed        
 vertically at an angle to permit      
 drainage. On top of the hedge, turf   
 from the immediate area is placed.    
{Colonisation}of bushes in a Cornish   
 hedge is slow because of its structure
 and the exposed nature of the         
 countryside.However, grasses and wild 
 flowers thrive in the shelter provided
 and are able to grow in and on the    
 hedge because of the soil used in its 
 construction.                         
 The lack of shrubs,bushes and trees in
 the hedge does limit this environment 
 compared to some 'up-country'         
 hedgerows which are made entirely of  
 plants.                               </content>
