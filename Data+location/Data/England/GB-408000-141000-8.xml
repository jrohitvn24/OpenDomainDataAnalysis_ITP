		<title>08STONEHENGE POP FANS STOPPED</title>
		<content> Early in 1985 the National Trust took 
 civil action to stop the pop festival 
 from taking place on their land around
 Stonehenge.                           
 During May police closed the A344     
 completely and visitors were only     
 admitted via the eastern barrier. All 
 fields adjacent to Stonehenge were    
 ringed with razor wire and entrances  
 blocked off. Notices bearing{"NO      
{UNAUTHORISED ENTRY"}were put up. Local
 residents had to detour and thus added
 extra mileage to their journeys.      
 Soon it became clear that no one,     
 especially the pop fans and travelling
 people would be allowed anywhere near 
 the site of the proposed festival.    
 Several attempts were made to gain    
 access, resulting in skirmishes with  
 the police and arrests were made.     
 Eventually the Solstice passed and    
 festival goers moved on to Westbury.  </content>
