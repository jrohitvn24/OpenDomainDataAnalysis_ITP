		<title>13MUNCASTER CHURCH RAVENGLASS</title>
		<content> The church is 12th.century and is in  
 Muncaster Castle grounds.It is the    
 parish church of Ravenglass,but as it 
 is about 2 miles uphill away from the 
 village there is a consecrated parish 
 room next to the village hall.Services
 are held alternately between the two  
 places.Weddings,christenings and      
 funerals are all held at the church.  
 The Book of Common Prayer is used for 
 most of the services.                 
 It is part of the combined parish of  
 Waberthwaite,Ravenglass,Irton and     
 Eskdale.The vicar is the Reverend     
 Michael Smith,who is also rector of   
 Waberthwaite.He lives 7 miles away in 
 a vicarage in Eskdale.                
 Both churches are Anglican and are in 
 the diocese of Carlisle.
