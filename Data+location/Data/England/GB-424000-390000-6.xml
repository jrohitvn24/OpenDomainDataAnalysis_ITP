		<title>06THE CHURCH _THE PAST</title>
		<content> The stone church of St.Nicholas stands
 on the hill at High Bradfield,        
 protected from the cold winds by      
 higher ground rising behind it.It was 
 built in 1480 on the site of an       
 earlier church built by the monks of  
 Ecclesfield.The earliest stained glass
 window,dating from the 13th century &amp; 
 therefore probably a relic of the     
 earlier church,shows the founding of  
 the church by the Prior of Ecclesfield
 The stone slab of the oldest grave of 
 Ellen Wilson who died in 1598,now     
 forms part of the floor of the central
 aisle.The ancient documents of the    
 church are kept in the City Archives, 
 but one letter dated 2nd June 1743 &amp;  
 written to the Archbishop of          
 York,is retained by the church.
