		<title>17THE FISH LADY</title>
		<content>    On Sunday I went with Nicola to the
{fish lady's }house,we asked some      
 questions.I asked her the price of her
 cheapest and most exspensive fish.She 
 told me that coley was the cheapest   
 (Â£1 per pound),and Dover sole was the 
 most exspensive(Â£6 per pound).I asked 
 the fish lady "is this your van?,or do
 you work for someone else?".She told  
 me that she worked for herself ,but   
 the van was rented, this is called    
 a franchise.I also asked her how many 
 miles per week she{travelled,}her     
 answer was about 400 miles per week!.I
 asked what else she sold apart from   
 fish.She told us that she also sold   
 sausages,eggs,cheese and cream.       
    The fish lady works a five day     
 week.Each day She is on the road from 
 08.00 to 19.00 each day.At present she
 said that{trade was fairly steady.
