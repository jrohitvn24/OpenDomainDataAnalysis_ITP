		<title>12Everleigh Church (Redundant)</title>
		<content> Founded in the 14th Century by Bishop 
 Wykeham of Winchester, the church of  
 St. Peters fell into a delapidated    
 state and in 1813 it was decided to   
 build another church on the present   
 site which is between East and West   
 Everleigh.                            
 The present church, consecrated in    
 Oct.1814 contains brasses and marble  
 tablets and the Norman Font removed   
 from the original church. This church 
 continued in use until the mid 1970's 
 when due to the retirement of the     
 Rector the Church Commissioners were  
 unable to appoint another Rector and  
 the church became redundant.  Despite 
 this redundancy the church can be and 
 is used for five services per year,   
 Good Friday, Easter Sunday, St.       
 Peter's Day, Harvest Festival and     
 Christmas Day.
