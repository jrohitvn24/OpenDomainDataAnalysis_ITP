		<title>03KIRKBURTON TRAINING CENTRE</title>
		<content> The children join the centre at the   
 age of 16 after leaving school. One   
 part of the centre is a special needs 
 centre. This is where the oldest      
 pupils in the centre go because their 
 brains are not as active as the       
 younger ones. In there they practise  
 changing their clothes, making cups of
 tea and threading needles to steady   
 their hands. Outside they have started
 gardening. They have two greenhouses, 
 one plastic tunnel and one brick plot 
 for pot plants. They grow vegetables  
 and house plants. There is also a     
 laundry where a girl does the washing 
 for the centre. There are two washing 
 machines and one drier. In sewing they
 make aprons, mats and learn how to use
 a sewing machine. In pottery they make
 ornaments, spiral mugs and piggybanks.
 One boy can use the potters wheel.
