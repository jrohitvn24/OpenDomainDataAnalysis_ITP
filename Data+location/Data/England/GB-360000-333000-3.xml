		<content>   Aychley Farm is situated in 366.5   
 acres of land.85 acres of this is used
 for potatoes,30 acres for silage grass
 and 69 acres for spring barley.The    
 rest is mainly grazing grass.         
   In front of the farm there is a     
 reservoir which is 13 feet deep and   
 holds 6 million gallons of water.The  
 reservoir was dug out in 1978 and     
 doesn't contain any fish.It fills up  
 by rain water from drains under the   
 fields and from the roofs.There are   
 ducks and geese nesting on the banks  
 of the reservoir.                     
   The farm buildings and the farm     
 house were built in 1868.             
   The farmer rolls his barley to feed 
 his fat cattle.The farm has 16 hay    
 bays.                                 
   The underpass is used for driving   
 cattle under the dual carriageway of  
 the A.41 into the opposite field.     </content>
