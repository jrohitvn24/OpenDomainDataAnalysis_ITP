		<content>  My bedside alarm buzzes merrily at   
5:3Oam today,my husband,Paul,has to be 
at work early.I make him a cup of tea  
on the Aga and then pack him his lunch 
and flask which he takes with him when 
he leaves at 6:OOam.                   
  My three children,Tracy,Victoria and 
Paul awake at 7:3Oam,they all have a   
breakfast of cereal then they get      
themselves ready for school.Victoria   
and Tracy take it in turns to feed the 
animals,seven guinea pigs and a rabbit 
before they go to school.              
  I have always taken my children to   
school by car,I drop Paul off at       
Bramford School first,and then the two 
girls at Claydon High School.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
