{'A TYPICAL DAY'(CONT.)}               
                                       
 tomorrow I could be at the school in  
 conference with the Head Teacher, in  
 my capacity as Chairman of the        
 Governors, over some aspect of school 
 life.                                 
                                       
 In between these activities there is  
 my garden to cultivate. The necessary 
 decorating tasks in the bungalow have 
 also to be fitted in. In addition I am
 involved with our local Methodist     
 Church where help in various aspects  
 of the church has to be given from    
 time to time. Holidays abroad and     
 visits to relations in Suffolk and    
 Wiltshire have also to be organised in
 between times. As the year progresses 
 the garden continues to occupy my     
 time.                                 </content>
