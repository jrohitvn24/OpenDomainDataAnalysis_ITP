		<title>12Much Marcle Shop</title>
		<content> There has been a village shop in Much 
 Marcle for 60 years. The shop is very 
 busy and it opens from 7.45 am to     
 6 pm. It opens every day even on      
 Sunday morning. The shop sells general
 groceries,Coal and calor gas,lots of  
 people use the village shop.Its main  
 customers are the people in the       
 village but in the summer motorists   
 stop to buy ice creams  and soft      
 drinks. Summer and Christmas are the  
 busiest times. Inside the village shop
 there is a post office which offers   
 all the same services as a main       
 branch. The only thing that you cannot
 buy is car tax. Not long ago the      
 inside of the shop was changed to make
 it more like a supermarket.Everyone   
 says the change is a good one. I think
 that there will always be a village   
 shop in Much Marcle.
