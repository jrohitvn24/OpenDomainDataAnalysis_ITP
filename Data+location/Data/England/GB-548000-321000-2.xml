		<title>02OUR HOUSE</title>
		<content> Our house in Wingland was built in    
 1919. It was built by German prisoners
 of war from the first World War.      
       Our house and next door were    
 called "Intake Cottages" and they were
 built forfarm workers to live in. On  
 the wall at the front of the house is 
 a royal crest with the letters G.R.   
 on it. The reasonfor this is that in  
 1919 when the house was built King    
 GEORGE V was King of England and the  
 house belonged to the Crown. In 1974  
 the Crown decided to sell the two     
 houses to private owners.
