		<content>   Tregony has its own cricket and     
 football teams and a four acre sports 
 field complete with pavillion. The    
 Women's Institute and Children's      
 Playgroup are also very active.       
   In the summer many people let their 
 homes to holiday makers; there is     
 quite a high demand since the village 
 is relatively unspoilt and gives easy 
 access to the Roseland peninsular.    
   Tregony was founded in the eleventh 
 century around the time of the        
 original Domesday Book. There were    
 then only a few houses on the banks of
 the river Fal. At the height of its   
 influence and prosperity it was a     
 thriving port and, being one of the   
 notorious "rotten boroughs", sent two 
 M.P.s to Westminster in the 1820s.    
 There was much trade with the French  
 ports, dealing in tin, wool and food- 
 stuffs. Local trades have almost gone.</content>
