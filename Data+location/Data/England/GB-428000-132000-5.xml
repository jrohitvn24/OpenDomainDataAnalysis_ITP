		<content> Most of the{soil}in Broughton is on   
{chalk}so the soil is thin and dries   
 out easily in the summer. Because it  
 would be difficult to care for animals
 so far from the farm where there is   
 not any water, most of the land is    
 used for growing{cereal crops}like    
{barley}and{wheat.}But there are two   
{dairy herds}on the lower land and some
{sheep}to the east of the region. There
 is a small amount of soil that grows  
 peas and beans.                       
 Several of the small farms have been  
 taken over by larger farms, there are 
 now thirteen farms left in the area.  
 There is one set of allotments in     
 Broughton where people grow vegetables
 and flowers.                          
 Farming was once the main employment  
 in Broughton, but now few people work 
 on the land, and large machines do the
 work.                                 </content>
