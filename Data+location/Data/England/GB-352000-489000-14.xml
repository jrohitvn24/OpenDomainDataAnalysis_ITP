		<title>14OXENHOLME FARM.</title>
		<content>  Mr. Bell took over the Elizabethan   
 farmhouse in 1932. There 40 hectares  
 owned by the farm and a further 23 are
 rented. Silage, which is cut every    
 year in June and August, occupies 38  
 acres while the remaining 63 are used 
 for hay and pasture.                  
  Mr. Bell owns four{tractors,}two of  
 which are Fords. He keeps{Friesian    
{cows,}forty-two being milked every day
 at 07.00 and 16.00. So far this year  
 145{lambs}have been born, although 8  
 or 9 die each year shortly after      
 birth. Mr. Bell also keeps{hens}and   
 breeds{pheasants}which he buys when   
 they are only a day old.              
  When{St. Mark's}children visited the 
 farm they were given some silage and  
 cow cake. They watched the sheepdog at
 work and went in the milking shed.    
 When they entered a field of cows,    
 they were very quickly surrounded!    </content>
