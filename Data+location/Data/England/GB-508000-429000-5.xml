		<content> Out of a sample of 50 children aged   
 9-11 in this inner-city area, just    
 over 60% owned, or had access to, some
 form of{electronic game}in the home.  
 The majority were the hand-held       
 'arcade' games such as Pacman,        
 Astro-Wars or a bat-and-ball type     
 game.   Very few, however, played with
 them much once the novelty value had  
 worn off, much preferring the         
 commercially produced games which are 
 played on a television screen via a   
{computer.}  This is probably explained
 by three main facts:                  
 (a) the wider range of games and      
 skill-levels,                         
 (b) the greater access children now   
 have to computers through their       
 schools and                           
 (c) the amount of time they already   
 spend sitting in front of a television
 screen watching hired video films.    </content>
