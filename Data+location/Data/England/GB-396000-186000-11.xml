		<title>11CHARLTON YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content>    Charlton Youth Club is held in the 
 very modern Village Hall. Some of the 
 activities held inside the Club are   
 table tennis and snooker. Outside on  
 the field rounders and cricket are    
 played. You can dance to the music    
 inside if you want to as well. You can
 buy sweets there and orange and cola  
 flavoured drinks. The number of people
 who go to Youth Club is fifty. You    
 have to be aged 10 years and over to  
 attend the Club, but mainly older     
 children attend.                      
    People who come to Youth Club often
 are brought by car but some walk as   
 they live in the village. Three get to
 the Club by bicycle.                  
    About twelve other local           
 organisations rent the Hall regularly 
 for activites ranging from Toddler    
 Group to Yoga. These groups pay rents 
 to cover expenses.                    </content>
