		<title>09Richard's Day.</title>
		<content> My name is Richard Wood and every     
 school day I get up at eight o'clock. 
 I go for a wash and get dressed. For  
 breakfast I have cereal. Between 20   
 and half past 8 my friend Lee comes   
 for me. We walk to school. We arrive  
 about 20 minutes before 9 o'clock. We 
 usually play Bulldog or walk around.  
 At 9 o'clock we go in and line up for 
 Assembly. When we return we have      
 Maths. At 10.35 we have a break.      
 We have a tuck shop. After break we   
 have English. At 12.00 it's dinner    
 time. We have an hour and a quarter.  
 After dinner play we have Topic. At   
 2.25 we have playtime.                
 Next we have Reading and reading      
 sheets. At 3.45 we leave. When I get  
 home I watch T.V. till tea. Later I go
 out with my friend Sean who lives near
 me. We play football and go for bike  
 rides. I go to bed at 9.30.           </content>
