		<title>17THE BARN DANCE</title>
		<content>      The barn dance is held after the 
 village fete in July. It is held in a 
 big barn at Stones farm in Sherborne. 
 In the barn there is a bar,and a band 
 who play on a trailer at one end of   
 the barn.Most of the children go and  
 play on the bales of straw in another 
 barn,but some join in the dances.The  
 barn dance goes on from 7o'clock till 
 12o'clock at night.We have to sit on  
 straw bales at the sides.The barn is  
 lit with coloured lights.A hot dog van
 comes so people have something to     
 eat.Everybody enjoys it.We do lots of 
 country dances.The barn dance is      
 really good.
