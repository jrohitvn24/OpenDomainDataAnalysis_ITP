		<title>05WILLIAM TYNDALE(c.1492-1536)</title>
		<content>    William Tyndale, translator of the 
 Bible was born in Slimbridge in 1492. 
 He thought that the Bible should be   
 translated into English.              
    Tyndale was a Latin and Greek tutor
 to a bishop's children, the bishop    
 disagreed with Tyndale about his ideas
 but Tyndale swore he would translate  
 the Bible.                            
    Tyndale went to Germany to escape  
 the clergy who did not wish him to    
 translate it. He persuaded German     
 government officials to transport the 
 translated  Bibles into England, and  
 they were sold privately to those who 
 could afford it.                      
    Bishops in England were angry - as 
 expected. Tyndale was caught in 1535  
 and then strangled and burnt  in 1536.
 His last words were "Lord open the    
 King of England's eyes." Three years  
 later his prayer was answered.        </content>
