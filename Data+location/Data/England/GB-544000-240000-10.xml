		<content> General awareness of quality of diet  
 was shown - particularly mentioned was
 the increasing importance of wholefood
 "high fibre" diets and freshness of   
 food.  Most households grow their own 
 fruit and vegetables - a few eat home 
 produced game, chickens and sheep.    
 None entirely self-sufficient.        
 Majority of population eat in restaur-
 ants at least once a month _ 10% never
 eat out _ some do once a week.  "Take-
 away" Chinese, Indian and Fish and    
 Chip meals from local towns _ over 7  
 miles away _ are used occasionally.
