		<content> There are different types of farms in 
 the area. Some are almost entirely for
 fruit - apples pears + some cherries. 
 Many of the good old varieties have   
 been grubbed out, Worcester, Beauty of
 Bath, Millers seedling. One large farm
 is mostly arable, cabbage, beans,     
 potatoes, strawberries with chemical  
 fertilisers. There are  mixed farms,  
 growing blackcurrants, gooseberries,  
 asparagus, watercress as well as      
 cattle. To the north  a mixed farm    
 with Sussex reds, arable,cereal and   
 orchards. No stubble is burnt, the    
 straw is used for the cattle +        
 ploughed back, areas are left wild,   
 traditional but very efficient. This  
 farm also incorporates chestnut       
 coppice. Other crops grown in the area
 include brassicas, peas, beans, sweet 
 corn, barley and clover.
