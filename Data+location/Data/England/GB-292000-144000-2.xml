		<title>02NATIONAL PARK WARDEN</title>
		<content> Mr.Collins is one of the four wardens 
 who look after Exmoor.It is their job 
 to see that people can enjoy the      
 National Park in Safety.Most land on  
 Exmoor is owned privately,much by the 
 National Trust. There are many foot   
 paths,bridle ways and special camp    
 sites so people can enjoy many        
 different outdoor activities.Some of  
 the National Park is Woodland.Mr      
 Collins and his helpers manage some of
 it.They cut down mature trees and     
 replant with mixed native broadleaf   
 trees grown in a nursery near         
 Allerford.Much of the National Park is
 farmland.Visitors must follow the     
 country code and farmers should keep  
 footpaths clear.Mr.Collins sometimes  
 helps settle disputes between visitors
 with dogs and farmers with sheep.A    
 worry is heathland catching fire.
