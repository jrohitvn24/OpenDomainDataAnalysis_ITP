		<content> This pleasant area within the Lake    
 District National Park comprises the  
 central part of of Bassenthwaite Lake 
 and land to east and west. The main   
 Keswick to Cockermouth and Workington 
 Road the A66 traverses the western    
 shore bordered by the woodlands of    
 Thornthwaite Forest. Wythop Hall is   
 the headquarters of the Forestry      
 Commission for Thornthwaite. The      
 roadside woodlands are deciduous with 
 conifers planting on higehr ground.   
 The eastern shore is bordered by good 
 pasture land, grazed by sheep and beef
 cattle. The A591 Keswick to Carlisle

 land which is partly afforested with  
 conifers. The lake has associations   
 with Alfred, Lord Tennyson, the poet.

 is a new development of holiday homes </content>
