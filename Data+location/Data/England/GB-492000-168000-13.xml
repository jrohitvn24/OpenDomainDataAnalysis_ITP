		<title>13MY LOCAL AREA</title>
		<content> My name is Sarah and I am 10 years    
 old.I live on the border between      
 Sunningdale and Ascot.This area is    
 famous for horse racing and it becomes
 extemely busy when there is a race    
 meeting.                              
 I like this area because it is very   
 quiet most of the time.It is an ideal 
 place for bird watching,painting and  
 other quiet hobbies.                  
 I think though that this area is bad  
 for shopping.The shops are far away   
 and quite expensive.I feel that there 
 aren't enough playing fields and      
 swimming pools in the area.There are  
 not enough things to entertain people 
 and the bus service is very           
 infrequent.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
