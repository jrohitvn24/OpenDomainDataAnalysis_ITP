		<title>09MULLION PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Mullion County Primary School takes   
 children aged 5_11. It has no nursery 
 education and no "rising-five" scheme.
 Cornwall Education Committee says it  
 does not have the money for such      
 schemes. The school has 217 children  
 on roll, some of whom come from       
 outside the catchment area, as their  
 parents choose to send them there     
 rather than to their local school. The
 fact that the new school was built 3  
 years ago is an attractive prospect   
 as many of the other schools on the   
 Lizard are in old buildings in need of
 repair.There are 7 full-time teachers 
 at the school, and 2 part-time.The    
 headteacher teaches 1/3rd of the week.
 A secretary helps the head with       
 administration for 15 hours a week. An
 ancillary helps with the infants. Most
 of the pupils go to Mullion           
 Comprehensive School when they leave. </content>
