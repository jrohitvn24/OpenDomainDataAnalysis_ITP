		<title>11HOME LIFE IN EYKE PARISH</title>
		<content>                                       
The lives of people in the area tends  
to revolve around their homes, as      
illustrated by the attractive state of 
many of the gardens with their well    
laid out flower beds and vegetable     
gardens.  Most households have pets;   
there are dogs and/or cats in many and 
donkeys, horses, goats and rabbits in  
some.                                  
                                       
Theatres, cinemas and other entertain- 
ments are some miles away; the nearest 
public houses at Eyke and Butley would 
be generally considered as more than   
walking distance away.                 
                                       
Families needing babysitters ususlly   
have to fetch and return them.  Thus,  
life tends to revolve more around the  
home than it might do in less isolated 
areas.                                 </content>
