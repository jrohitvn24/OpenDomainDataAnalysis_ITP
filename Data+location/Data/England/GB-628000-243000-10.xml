		<title>10Trust Hall</title>
		<content>{Shottisham Trust Hall}was beqeathed to
 the Women's Institute by one of the   
{Quilter family}some 30 years ago. It  
 was originally three cottages but has 
 now been converted into a small hall. 
                                       
 It is the only hall in the village and
 is hired out by the WI for various    
 functions.{Whist Drives and Coffee    
 Evenings, which are very well         
 supported by the villagers, are held  
 there to help with the cost of        
 maintenance.There are no grants       
 available and it is an ever increasing
 struggle to maintain the building.    
                                       
 The elderly hold their{Frienship Club 
 meetings there , as does the{Parish   
{Council}and it is used as a Polling   
 Station during Elections.
