		<title>13SUTTON CLOUGH.</title>
		<content>   Sutton Clough is part of what used  
 to be the estate belonging to Sutton  
 Hall,now demolished.It is reached by  
 passing under a majestic stone archway
 formerly the Lodge.The gateway is     
 still inhabited.                      
   The entrance to the Clough is by a  
 narrow wooden bridge over a small     
 stream which runs into Sutton Beck and
 eventually joins the River Aire.      
   Trees rise up tall on either side of
 the path which follows the stream     
 upwards towards its source.The path is
 in the valley bottom and the sides    
 rise up very steeply towards Ellers   
 Lane on one side and West lane on the 
 other.                                
   At Clough Head,the path takes the   
 form of an ornate metal bridge over   
 the stream and then winds steeply up  
 the hillside to emerge on West Lane.
