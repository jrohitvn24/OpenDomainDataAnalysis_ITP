  We decided to interview two different
 people in our area and ask them there 
 views of life in a village in the past
 and the present.                      
  We chose Mr Lidgett an old man who   
 has lived and worked in the area all  
 of his life. He was born in           
 Springthorpe and went to the village  
 school. He now lives in Heapham not   
 far from his old home.                
  The second person was Robert Winters 
 a nine year old school boy who lives  
 with his mother,father,brother and    
 many pets in Heapham.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
