		<content>{Mr. Birt}lives in{South Lodge.}He told
 us that he looks after mainly{Beech,  
{Maple,Cherry,Hazel and Norway Spruce. 
 The latter is the most common. The    
{Hazel is used for making hurdles,bean_
{rods,pea sticks and thatching spars.  
 After consulting the{Forestry Commiss_
{ion}trees can be felled generally at  
{12 years old. The Spruce is used for  
{pit_props.}They plant more trees than 
 they fell to conserve the countryside.
  {Squirrels like to strip the bark}and
{rabbits and hares}do a lot of damage  
 to young trees and natural seedlings. 
   Some of the wood is turned into     
 chips by a large machine supplied by  
 the paper factory. He controls 150    
 acres and the oldest tree in his care 
 is a{300 year old oak. They do not get
 much money until the trees are mature 
 or semi-mature.
