		<title>05Homestead Farm   Silage</title>
		<content>   {Mr. Priddle}is the farmer at       
{Homestead Farm}at{Newbridge.}He took  
 us up through the fields  in his      
 pick_up truck to see where they were  
 cutting the grass for{silage.         
    They cut three times a  year -  in 
 May,  in July and again later. They   
 cut about 12 acres in a day.          
    The grass is cut with a mower.A    
 harvester sucks it up and loads it    
 into a trailer and it is taken away   
 to the{silage clamp}in the farmyard   
 where it is packed into a solid heap. 
    The silage  is covered with plastic
 sheets. Old tyres are put on top to   
 keep the air out.                     
    Any field that does'nt produce as  
 much silage as the rest is{ploughed}up
 and{re-seeded}in August and September 
 (15-20 acres each year). The manure   
 from the farmyard is put on the       
 re-seeded fields.                     </content>
