		<content> Cats seem to be the most popular pets;
 one farm thinks it has 38.Dogs are    
 also very common with farms having    
 working ones. Small animals such as   
 rabbits gerbals and hamsters are      
 children's pets.One farm has a steer  
 so tame the children can ride it      
 In Pilning electricity is the         
 commonest fuel for cooking but there  
 are a number using solid fuel. In Over
 Lane and Knole Park gas is available  
 as it was brought down to supply the  
 brickworks. For speed and convenience 
 microwave ovens are becoming more     
 common.  The inhabitants of the area  
 especially amongst themselves have a  
 definite dialect of S.Glos. with an   
 overlay of Bristolian.This leads to   
 adding "L" to the end of any word     
 ending with a vowel.i.e.,bananals for 
 bananas.In one house 3 people have    
 seen a ghost of an old man by a fire. </content>
