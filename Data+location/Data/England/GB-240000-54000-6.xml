{ }Torpoint is a fairly new town,the   
 first buildings were not built until  
 1737.The nearby villages of Antony and
 St. John are much older.The people of 
 these 2 villages and big coun try     
 houses needed to get across to the    
 markets and Plymouth and Stonehouse to
 buy and sell produce and surplies.They
 went across the River Tamar by Market 
 Boats which sailed from St. John on   
 Tuesday,Thursday and Saturday.About   
 1730 some kind of unoffical ferry     
 started operating,it was owned by the 
 Carews and the Mount Edgecombe        
 families.The reason for the ferrys    
 starting was the building of Devonport
 Dockyard.Many of the cottages for the 
 workers were built in Torpoint.There  
 were horse boats and foot boats ferrys
