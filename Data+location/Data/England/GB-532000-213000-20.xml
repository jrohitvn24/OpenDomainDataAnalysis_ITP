		<title>20COUNTY DAY HARTHAM, HERTFORD</title>
		<content> Held annually at{Hartham Park,}County 
 Day is a chance to have a pleasant day
 out and raise money for charity.Spring
 Bank Holiday Monday is usually wet and
 this year was no exception but,despite
 the rain,{6000 people}paid to see the 
 attractions. I got in free as I was on
{Red Cross}duty, tending lost children 
 and injuries. First I looked round the
 stalls, then we had a lot of accidents
 from the{fair}(cut fingers and knees).
   Crowds watched 5-a-side football and
 tug-o-war competitions, then the{mayor
 opened the main events in the arena.  
   There were clowns, bands, majorettes
 and the K9 Commandos demonstrating dog
 training.Next came a{medieval jousting
 display from France but the thing that
 stole the show was the{skydivers}drop-
 ping in just as the weather cleared!  
   Despite winds preventing the awaited
 balloon launch, the day was a success!</content>
