 Neroche school Broadway got its name  
 from Neroche Forest.At the time of the
 original Domesday Book the Neroche    
 Forest covered much of the area of    
 south Somerset.Neroche school was     
 built 12 years ago in 1973.           
    The small schools in Horton and    
 Donyatt closed because there weren't  
 enough pupils in them.The pupils all  
 came to this school.                  
    They are divided into 4 classes.   
 Class 1 is the Reception class and has
 29 children.Class 2 has 32 older      
 infants and lower juniors.Class 3 has 
 32 lower juniors and class 4 has 34   
 upper junior children.On Mondays      
 Tuesdays and Thursdays the local      
 playgroup meets in one of the spare   
 classrooms.                           
    The school has a field and two     
 playgrounds for Football and Cricket. </content>
