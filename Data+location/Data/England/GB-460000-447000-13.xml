		<title>13Heslington Tilmire</title>
		<content> We wanted to discover what grasses,   
 plants, shrubs and insects we could   
 find on Heslington Tilmire, an area of
 rough grazing containing wide fingers 
 of marshy land.                       
 We walked to the Tilmire along the    
 outgang, a rough track. The Tilmire   
 was enclosed in 1760. The outgang was 
 made in 1762 to provide access for the
 Tilmire freeholders. To our left was a
 tall hedgerow containing Hawthorne,   
 Alder, Beech, Oak and Willow. The     
 hedgerow is about three hundred years 
 old. In the grasses at the bottom of  
 the hedgerow we found Hogweed,        
 Cuckoopint, Woundwort or Hedgenettle  
 and Eyebright. We decided to set up   
 three thirty metre line transects to  
 provide a comparison. We set them up  
 at the southern edge of Fulford Heath 
 Golf course,at the Southern and       
 Northern edge of the Tilmire          </content>
