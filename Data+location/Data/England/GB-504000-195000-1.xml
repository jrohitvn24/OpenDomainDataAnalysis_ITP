		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO AREA</title>
		<content> THE AREA COVERED IS VERY MIXED        
 AND INCLUDES PARTS OF CROXLEY GREEN(A 
 VILLAGE SITUATED BETWEEN WATFORD AND  
 RICKMANSWORTH), RICKMANSWORTH AND     
 CHORLEYWOOD. THE WHOLE AREA COMES     
 UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THREE       
 RIVERS COUNCIL. IT IS SO NAMED BECAUSE
 OF THE THREE RIVERS THAT FLOW THROUGH 
 THE AREA; THE GADE, THE COLNE AND THE 
 CHESS. IT IS MAINLY A RESIDENTIAL     
 AREA, ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL A GREAT 
 DEAL OF FARMLAND AND WOODLAND BECAUSE 
 IT IS PROTECTED BY THE GREEN BELT.  IT
 IS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MILES FROM    
 LONDON AND MANY RESIDENTS COMMUTE     
 DIRECTLY TO LONDON EVERY DAY BY BUS   
 AND TRAIN.
