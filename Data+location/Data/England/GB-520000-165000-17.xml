		<title>17LOCAL TRAFFIC</title>
		<content>A TRAFFIC SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED LOCALLY 
ON ONE OF THE MAJOR ROADS IN THE AREA. 
DURING A TWENTY MINUTE PERIOD A TOTAL  
OF 672 VEHICLES USED THE ROAD.THE      
MAJORITY OF THESE WERE HEADING TO AND  
FROM SHOPPING AREAS AND THE LOCAL BY-  
PASS.ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE WERE         
TRAVELLING BY CAR,MANY STILL USED THEIR
BICYCLES FOR GETTING AROUND LOCALLY.   
BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF ROAD TRAFFIC  
TRAVELLING TO AND FROM LONDON MANY     
LOCAL PEOPLE USE THE TRAIN TO GET INTO 
THE CITY.A SURVEY AT ONE OF OUR LOCAL  
STATIONS SHOWED THAT BETWEEN 70 AND 110
TICKETS ARE SOLD ON A WEEKDAY,MOST OF  
WHICH ARE DAY RETURNS TO INNER LONDON. 
BOTH ROAD AND RAIL SERVICES IN OUR AREA
ARE BUSY EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK.
