		<title>18 CUDHAM - BLACKSMITH'S FORGE</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Forge, celebrated in the name of  
the village pub, is at least 200 years 
old and only shod horses until 1948.   
The blacksmith now makes swords and    
sheaths which are later covered with   
gold and studded with jewels. He also  
makes surgical instruments in addition 
to general blacksmith's work.          
 The forge burns special forge "beans" 
and is bellowed by an electric fan.    
 The smith uses black iron, stainless  
steel, and mild steel in his work,     
fashioning the metal with hand tools.  
 To make wrought iron scrolls he picks 
up a bar of iron with his tongs and    
then places it in the forge for about  
20 seconds before taking it out and    
attaching it to a special instrument   
with which he shapes the curves.
