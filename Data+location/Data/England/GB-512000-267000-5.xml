   The{woodland}in this area was       
 planted by the{Forestry Commision}in  
 the 1930's on poor arable or scrubland
 and is managed by the Anglian Water   
 Authority. Sycamore, oak and ash trees
 were planted on approximately 50      
 hectares. The ash trees did not       
 survive. Many elms were planted in the
 1960's but have succombed to disease  
 and died. A number of Scots Pines have
 been planted. They grow well and are a
 valuable asset at maturity, as are the
 oaks. There exists a crop of Norway   
 Spruce which are felled after two or  
 three years and are sold as Christmas 
 trees. The planting programme is      
 subject to financial cuts by local    
 government so the number of trees     
 planted each year is not constant.
