		<title>14ROSELAND GDNS.EST., REDRUTH</title>
		<content> In conclusion it might be generalised 
 that the average home owner living in 
 Roseland Gdns. estate, Redruth, lives 
 in a 15 year old house/bungalow, with 
 3 bedrooms. He has lived there for    
 more than 10 years and he has made    
 improvements by insulating the attic  
 and adding a conservatory. He did not 
 occupy his home from new, but moved   
 from somewhere in Redruth to gain a   
 'better house'. His previous home was 
 older, larger, but less convenient. He
 feels that the main advantage of life 
 on a modern housing estate is limited 
 through traffic, while he considers   
 the main disadvantage to be a lack of 
 privacy.
