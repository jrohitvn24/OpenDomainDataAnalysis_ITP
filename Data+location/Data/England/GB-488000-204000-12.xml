		<title>12Residential Building,The Lee</title>
		<content> Most of the buildings in the block    
 were owned by the Liberty family until
 1952. Many houses &amp; farms were sold on
 the death of Captain Stewart-Liberty, 
 &amp; in a short time the village was     
 mostly owned, not tenant-occupied.    
 There are about 24 council houses in  
 Lee Common, built in 1945.            
 The buildings are {distributed}in 4   
  centres; The Lee, Swan Bottom, Kings 
 Ash and Lee Common, the last being the
 largest.                              
{Planning}The area is in the Chiltern  
 AONB, &amp; is a conservation area. Since 
 1945 little building (70 houses) has  
 been done, only replacement or        
 infilling. As cottages have been sold,
 they have been enlarged or improved.  
 Cost eg 1952, Â£500; 1985, Â£120,000.   
 A few old{barns}have been             
 converted to dwellings, as modern     
 farms do not need so many buildings.  </content>
