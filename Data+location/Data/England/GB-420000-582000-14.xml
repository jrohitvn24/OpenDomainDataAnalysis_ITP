 There is a feeling that a sports or { 
{leisure centre}is needed in           
 Morpeth.The facilities for children   
 are not really good enough.The {local 
{park}has only got one slide and a     
 climbing frame.It is not a safe place 
 in which to play as the ground is     
 covered with broken glass.{Carlisle   
{Park }in Morpeth is disliked by more  
 local people than like it.They        
 think that the equipment needs to be  
 better looked after and more          
 exciting.The{Local Council }has       
 proposed that Morpeth Parish should   
 become responsible for maintaining the
 playground equipment.A leisure centre 
 would provide sports facilities for   
 the whole family.In Morpeth {parking} 
 is expensive.Everyone would like to   
 see {free parking}for residents who   
 maybe want to do a quick shop.        </content>
