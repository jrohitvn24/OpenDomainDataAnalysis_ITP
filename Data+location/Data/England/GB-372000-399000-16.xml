		<title>16The Little City</title>
		<content> Yesterday, July 4th, we walked to City
 Road. When we got there we looked     
 around. Most of the houses had big    
 bolts through the wall to hold the    
 house together because there was an   
 old mine underneath. Some houses      
 didn't have bolts because they weren't
 affected by it. Most of the land      
 around is waste land.                 
                                       
 We saw the Methodist Church. It was   
 built in 1868. We also saw some houses
 which had dates when they were built. 
 Some houses were built in 1902, 1894  
 and 1876. We saw some homing pigeons. 
 The city is little and there is more  
 fieldland than housing.
