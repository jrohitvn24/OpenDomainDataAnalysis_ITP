		<content> The{Farmer}came here as a small boy   
 in the 1900's. His father had a local 
 pub and started to buy and rent land. 
 He spent his life farming here.{      
{Changes:}Horses and manual workers    
 have gone. His Son, Grandson, and 2   
 men work 700 acres. The same farm once
 employed 16. Then, all the local farms
 were devoted to sheep, market garden  
 produce, fruit, and hops. Today they  
 are mostly arable with a few sheep.   
 With intensive control of grassland   
 many sheep can be kept in a small area
 his farm has 450.{People:}Marshside   
 was a purely agricultural community.  
 Village shops and tradesman supplied  
 all needs. Now, most residents are    
 retired folk, there are even "Weekend 
 Homes". The{Land}varies enormously;   
 clay on the marsh, brickearth valleys,
 and thin poor soil on the gravel.
