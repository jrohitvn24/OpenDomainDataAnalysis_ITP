		<title>20GENERAL DESCRIPTION - BIRCH</title>
		<content>{ Birch}is a small{village}situated on 
 the B1022 leading from Colchester to  
 Tiptree. The community is fairly      
 scattered with both the School and the
 Church set at the edge of the village 
 residential area. Until recently the  
 majority of people living in Birch    
 worked for the Round Family who are   
 the major landowners in the area.     
  Most of the people living in the     
 village today{work}in Colchester,     
 Tiptree,Chelmsford or London. Inspite 
 of the agricultural bias in land use  
 this is no longer the main employer of
 local people.                         
  The land rises up from the{Roman     
{River Valley}and although the fields  
 are large and hedges have been        
 removed, many trees have been planted 
 to act as windbreaks. The{soil}is     
 light and sandy and irrigation of     
 crops is often necessary.             </content>
