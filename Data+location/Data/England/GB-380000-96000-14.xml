		<content> Milborne St. Andrew is a very old     
 settlement.  Recorded history starts  
 with a Charter from King Athelstan who
 gave the land at Meleburn to endow his
 new Abbey at Milton in A.D. 843 (when 
 checked from 925 - 940.)  Milborne is 
 not mentioned again until the mid 15th
 century, where it is termed Milborne  
 Abbotson, Andrueston, Churcheston,    
 Deverel, Mamford, Michaelston and     
 Symondeston. Milborne Slileham was    
 merged with Milborne St. Andrew in    
 1933.  The Church was built in 1067   
 and has two fine Norman arches,       
 restorations were carried out in 1878.
  The village has close conections with
 John Morton, born 1410 who became Lord
 Chancellor, Archibishop of Canterbury 
 and eventually Cardinal in the  reign 
 of Henry VII.  The Manor house where  
 he lived still stands.
