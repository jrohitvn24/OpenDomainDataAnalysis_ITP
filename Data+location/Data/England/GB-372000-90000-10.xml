		<title>10THE CHURCH</title>
		<content>   This church was, in the main, built 
 in 1863 by T.H.Wyatt.                 
   The only portions of the ancient    
 church now remainig are the Early     
 English window to the West ot the     
 porch,the base of the tower,the       
 piscina in the transcept, ant the     
 small locker containig the sacered    
 vessels which is also in the transcept
 but concealed by a wall.              
   The church was rebuilt on the old   
 foundations, except in the aisles,    
 which is a later addition.The old     
 chancel was unsually small.           
 Incorporated into the wall were three 
 stones which appeared to be sills of  
 an Early English window.The transcept,
 now rebuilt in the Early English      
 style, was a 14th century addition.   
 Before rebuilding the nave had been   
 enlarged.
