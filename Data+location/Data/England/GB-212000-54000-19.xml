		<title>19OLD BUILDINGS IN ST VEEP</title>
		<content>      There aren't any grand old       
 buildings in the area apart from the  
{churches,}but there are several       
 buildings which are of interest. These
 tend to be buildings which when they  
 were built were used for purposes for 
 which there is no longer any need.    
 The old granary, mill, boat house and 
 blacksmith's are now homes.           
     {Lime kilns}can still be seen in  
{Lerryn.}One is now a ruin, but the    
 other has been converted into a       
 dwelling.                             
     {St. Cadix,}at the head of St.    
 Cyric's creek, is the site of a Celtic
 hermitage founded by St. Carroc. In   
 the 12th century it became a{priory   
 with a prior and one monk. In 1556 the
 site was used for smelting tin. A     
 house still stands on the site today  
 and links from its past can still be  
 found.                                </content>
