		<content>  The oldest{church,}St.James the Less 
 -known as{Hadleigh Church}-is little  
 changed since it was first built as   
 the centre of the medieval community  
 600yrs. ago. As a contrast,  nearby   
{St.Barnabas}and{St.Aidan's}in the     
 Fairway are modern brick buildings.   
 The latter was built in 1971: it is   
 lofty and spacious with two striking  
 stained glass windows,tall and narrow.
 The services at St.Aidan's are typical
 of an{Anglican}church. Scouts, Guides,
 Cubs and Brownies attend a parade     
 service on the 1stSunday of each month
 and the hall is used for social       
 activities. Some families in the area 
 have no time for religion,  but for   
 those who do there are{churches}and   
{chapels}of various denominations to   
 cater for them and there is also the  
{Salvation Army.                       
                                       </content>
