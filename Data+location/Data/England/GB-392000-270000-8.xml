		<content>{BOYS' BRIGADE}- The Boys' Brigade is  
 divided into 2 sections, one for 6-9  
 year-olds, the other for boys over 9. 
 The kinds of activities you can do are
 games, first aid and camping, and     
 trips are organised too. At the end of
 each year badges and certificates are 
 awarded to those who have done well in
 the activities.                       
{SNOOKER}- In Bromsgrove there is a    
 snooker hall called Rekoons. If you   
 want to play there you have to be 16  
 or over. It is open every day of the  
 week. The club is going to ask the    
 council if they can have children's   
 competitions.                         
{PARK GATE INN}- This pub is just      
 outside Bromsgrove, on the Kidder-    
 minster Road. It has a children's     
 park, so parents can have a drink     
 while their children play safely.
