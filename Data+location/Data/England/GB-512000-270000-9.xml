		<title>09CHILDRENS GAMES</title>
		<content> In our survey we found the children   
 played a wide variety of games, from  
 the traditional hide_and_seek to the  
 modern Darth Vaders.Each game has its 
 own season.The most popular games are 
 Tig,Bulldog, Birthdays and Hopscotch. 
 This is how you play Birthdays. More  
 than nine people are needed.Someone is
 chosen to be it. When it calls the    
 month of your birthday you must run   
 across the playground.If you are      
 touched you must join IT and help tig 
 people too,if whole year is called    
 everyone must run.To play Bulldog you 
 need ten players.Choose 'IT'Everyone  
 else runs from one circle to          
 another.If you are pushed onto your   
 back you are 'it'too. Soon everyone   
 will be it.So start again.
