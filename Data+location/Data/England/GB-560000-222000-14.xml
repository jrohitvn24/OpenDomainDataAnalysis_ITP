		<content> There are many hundreds of acres of   
 good farmland in Dunmow and Little    
 Easton,it is better suited to arable  
 farming.The main crops are wheat,beans
 barley,potatoes and oil seed rape.    
 Easton farm was part of the Maynard   
 Estates until the Trembath family     
 bought it in 1920.They farm 600 acres 
 some is rented from the Maynard Estate
 and the chuch commissioners.Bigod's   
 farm has 337 acres of which 80 acres  
 are woodland.It hasn't kept live-stock
 since 1978.Most of the wheat is sown  
 in the autumn because it needs a cold 
 spell before the seed heads will grow.
 Beans are grown for animal feed and as
 a break crop.The farmers use sprays   
 and fertilisers to get better yields. 
 After the harvest in August,the       
 farmers burn the stubble to kill off  
 any diseased roots,then they plough   
 the fields to prepare for the new crop</content>
