		<title>10THINGS TO DO</title>
		<content> If you live in this area you really   
 have to have a car. There are lots    
 of                                    
 good roads but buses do not come into 
 the villages very often. If you live  
 in the survey area you have to travel 
 for your main shopping items and for  
 clothing. Retford is the nearest town.
 The bus ride is 50p for children and  
 Â£1 for adults. That's expensive! If   
 you come from the  Woodbeck Estate or 
 know someone from there you can use   
 their public swimming pool which is   
 open twice a day. there is a play park
 at Woodbeck and Rampton, and a Youth  
 Club is run at Woodbeck. Treswell runs
 activities for children but nothing   
 much goes on at Stokeham or Cottam. It
 is sometimes a boring place to live.
