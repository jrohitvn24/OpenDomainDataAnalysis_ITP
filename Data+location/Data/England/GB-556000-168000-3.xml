		<content>    This farm is named after a chapel  
 that was demolished about 80 years    
 ago, sited nearby. The farm land is   
 between 25 and 60 metres above sea    
 level, and is a light, chalky, well   
 drained soil.  Cereals, potatoes,     
 brassicas, peas, pears and apples are 
 being grown in 1985 on 1000 acres.    
 This produce is taken by lorries      
 through Dartford Tunnel to an Essex   
 distribution centre which delivers it 
 to supermarkets as required. 130 young
 steers are bought and kept in sheds,  
 fattened on silage, maize and         
 vegetable waste and sold later at     
 Ashford meat market. On this farm are 
 large public warehouses and cold      
 stores where dry and frozen food is   
 kept until it is sold. The farm       
 workforce, made up of about 25 local  
 men and women, is supplemented by 40  
 women for the fruit and potato harvest</content>
