  {Subject:Male (65 years),}resident   
 for 34 years.He thought it a pleasant 
 place to live for those who like the  
 relative quiet of a village. There    
 were many{clubs and activities}for the
 elderly,a youth club,Scouts &amp; Guides  
 and several sports' clubs.There was   
 a playing field,a Library,two         
 pubs,several shops and a Post Office. 
 He disliked the{poor bus service}to   
 Lincoln,the lack of mains gas for half
 the village and the{flatness of the   
{scenery.                              
  {Subject:Male (38 years),}resident   
 for 15 years.He thought it a pleasant,
{friendly place.}The playing field     
 behind his house was a source of noise
 and nuisance but there was plenty for 
 a sporting person to do.              
  {Subject:Male (14 years).}There is   
 not enough for the young to do.       </content>
