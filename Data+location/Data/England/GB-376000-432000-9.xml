		<title>09MR. BLUNDELL 2</title>
		<content> Mr Blundell walked to Padiham for     
 piano lessons and organ lessons but he
 had no other hobbies.  His only toy   
 was a top and whip.  He sometimes     
 walked to Padiham to the pictures.  It
 cost one shilling (5p) to get in.     
                                       
 Mr Blundell joined the army and served
 in Africa, travelling on a luxury     
 liner in a convoy to avoid the enemy. 
 After the war he had a motor bike     
 until he fell off it, then he got a   
 motor car in 1947.                    
                                       
 He was the grave digger, organist and 
 caretaker at the church and school    
 until he retired.  He still plays the 
 piano in school and the church organ.
