		<content> The chapel in Pitney became redundant 
 10 years ago.It lay empty for 4 years 
 until John Perrin moved his furniture 
 restoration business from Bristol to  
 Pitney.He is a Bristolian,but his     
 wife is from Pitney.The chapel        
 interior shows  no signs of its       
 original purpose,but outside the      
 gravestones can still be seen.Mr      
 Perrin,who is a cabinet maker,employs 
 a french polisher and 1 apprentice.   
 Their main work is furniture          
 restoration but they also do some     
 upholstery,make kitchen units,tables  
 cupboards and other pieces of         
 furniture to the customers            
 specifications.This year they have    
 made their first long_case clock from 
 scratch,having only restored the cases
 before.This is the most expensive     
 piece they have ever made_it's final  
 cost will be between Â£1200_Â£1300.     </content>
