		<content>1844 Sir H.E. Bunbury had the Public   
House built at the North end of the    
village, so his men had a long way to  
walk to reach it, as he did not approve
of them drinking and did not want to   
hear rowdiness.                        
These people have told us that there   
were about 7 wells serving the centre  
of the village.                        
Icepits Wood contains the remains of   
the pits used for storing ice blocks,  
for the use of the Hall.               
Mrs. Thomas was born on the night in   
1917 when a Zeppelin dropped a bomb on 
Billericay so she was nearly called    
Zeppelina!
