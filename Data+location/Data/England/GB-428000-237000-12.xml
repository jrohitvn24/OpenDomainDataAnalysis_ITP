		<content>   Shopping facilities in Brailes cater
 for the daily needs of the people.    
 More expensive durable items are      
 purchased in nearby towns.            
   There are two general stores, one   
 incorporates a Post Office, the other 
 sells alcohol. Two garages supply     
 petrol and offer repairs to cars and  
 agricultural machinery. Milk is       
 delivered on alternate days and mobile
 vans bring bread, meat and fish.      
   Other amenities are a hairdressing  
 salon, a garden centre, a blacksmith's
 shop and a mobile library. There are  
 two public houses and a restaurant    
 with overnight accommodation which    
 provides meals for special occasions. 
   The services of builders, plumbers, 
 electricians, an undertaker and a     
 television engineer are available in  
 the village.
