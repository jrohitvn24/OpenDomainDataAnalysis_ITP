		<content> Nearly every Sunday I go to Chapel,   
 our minister is Rev. Ian Parker who   
 lives in this village. The services   
 are 10.30am and 6.00pm in the evening.
 We take collection and send it to     
 Barclays Bank. Nearly every Sunday I  
 go to church because the Vicar is my  
 Daddy. Every week there is a serice at
 9.45am and 6.30pm and on Tuesday and  
 Thursdays Holy Communion at 10.am.    
 Father Dunstan is our parish priest   
 because I am a Roman Catholic; we have
 not got a church in Hutton Rudby, we  
 have to travel to Crathorne. Each     
 Tuesday in term time we go to Father  
 Dunstan for half an hour to learn more
 about our religion and God. Every     
 Tuesday I go to church house at 9am.  
 The man who runs it is Mr. Lickess    
 our vicar. We have been talking about 
 our local monasteries, Mt.Grace       
 Priory, Rievaulx, and Bylands.        </content>
