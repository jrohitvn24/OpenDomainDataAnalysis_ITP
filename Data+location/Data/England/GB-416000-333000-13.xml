		<title>13GAMES PEOPLE PLAY</title>
		<content> TWO OF THE GAMES PLAYED BETWEEN OUR   
 NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOURS AND OURSELVES ARE
 CALLED BRITISH BULLDOGS AND           
 SARDINES.IN BRITISH BULLDOGS WE SELECT
 A PERSON WHO MUST CATCH THE RUNNERS.  
 THE CATCHER CHOOSES A SET THING SUCH  
 AS 'TREES',AND THE RUNNERS MUST THEN  
 THINK OF THE NAME OF A TREE.IF THE    
 CATCHER GUESSES THE NAME THE RUNNER   
 MUST RUN.IF HE IS CAUGHT HE IS THE    
 CATCHER IN THE NEXT GAME.             
 IN THE GAME OF SARDINES ONE PERSON IS 
 SELECTED TO GO AND HIDE ANYWHERE.THE  
 SEEKERS COUNT UP TO A CERTAIN NUMBER. 
 WHEN EVERY COUNTER HAS FINISHED       
 COUNTING THEY GO TO TRY AND FIND THE  
 PERSON WHO IS HIDING.EVERYONE HAS TO  
 SPLIT UP SO THAT THE HIDER IS NOT     
 FOUND AT ONCE.WHEN THE HIDER IS FOUND 
 THE SEEKER HAS TO WAIT WITH THE HIDER 
 UNTIL EVERYONE ELSE HAS COME.THIS     
 SEEKER IS THE HIDER IN THE NEXT GAME. </content>
