		<title>18FOOTPATHS IN COOKSMILL GREEN</title>
		<content> Some footpaths in this survey area are
 in danger of being lost.They are heav-
 ily{overgrown}or in{fields ploughed so
{close}to the edge that no path is left
 Roxwell Parish Council received  com- 
 plaints about{the state of a byway}(an
 old path for wheeled vehicles).They   
 asked for volunteers but none came for
 ward.Then the Council were asked to   
 find work for a young offender who had
 been ordered to do 160 hrs{Community  
{Service.}Under the supervision of the 
 then unemployed footpaths officer he  
{cleared}the byway.During the years of 
 neglect,brambles had been shoved into 
 the ditch and blocked them causing    
 flooding problems.It was decided to   
 clear a wider path than the orginal   
 6ft to help dry the path out,but more 
 complaints were made because the path 
 is now said to be too wide and nesting
 areas are disturbed.                  </content>
