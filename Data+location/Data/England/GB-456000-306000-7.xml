		<title>07OUTDOOR PURSUITS CENTRE</title>
		<content> This centre is situated on the        
 Loughborough Road adjacent to the     
 Redhill Circle roundabout. Many       
 exciting outdoor pursuits are taught  
 on the basis of fun with safety.      
 Activities on offer include skiing,   
 climbing, canoeing, sailing, riding,  
 camping, orienteering, absailing and  
 general sports. The council backs the 
 centre because of the increased       
 leisure time in the 80s.              
 There are courses for the disabled and
 for over-50s as well as family, adult 
 and junior courses. During school     
 summer holidays, special schemes and  
 cheap courses are organised for 10 to 
 18 year olds at 60p a day.
