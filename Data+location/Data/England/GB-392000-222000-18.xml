{REGENCY}STYLES. During the Regency    
 period, when it was fashionable to    
 take the waters (following Royal      
 example) many fine terraces were      
 built. Prime examples of these still  
 remain. e.g. Landsdown Crescent, Royal
 Well Crescent, the Pittville area,    
 Imperial Gardens and Montpellier. All 
 are now used as business premises or  
 flats. None, regrettably, remain the  
 private residence of one family.      
  There exists a local Society which   
 encourages the preservation of        
 Regency houses by contributing towards
 the high cost of repairs.             
                                       
  A recent development in Montpellier  
 has been the construction of a        
 shopping complex which attempts to    
 blend Regency and present day         
 architectural styles.                 </content>
