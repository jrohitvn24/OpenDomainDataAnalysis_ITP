		<title>03OLD BUILDINGS IN BARFORD</title>
		<content>  The oldest house in the village is   
 C15 and is built of Chilmark stone.   
 Many of the older buildings date to   
 the C17 or C18 and many are listed    
 buildings of historical interest.     
  The Green Dragon public house is a   
 late C18 rebuilding of an older house.
 It was once called the Dragon Inn and 
 possibly The Blue Dragon. It once had 
 its own brewery.                      
  There was once a forge, a corn mill  
 and a bakery in the village. They have
 all been converted to dwellings.      
  A row of old farmworkers' cottages   
 near the church, in Duck Lane have    
 been demolished and large modern      
 houses built in their place. A row of 
 cottages near the junction with the   
 main road was demolished for road     
 improvements.                         
  It is thought that there was a silk  
 or woollen factory in Factory Lane.   </content>
