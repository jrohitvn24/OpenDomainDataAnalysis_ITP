		<content>In Glapthorn there is an important     
nature reserve which is the home of the
Black Hair Streak Butterfly.  It was   
first discovered in Britain in 1858 in 
Kettering and 1859 in Oundle.   It is  
about one inch long (about 3 cms.)     
and they fly right at the tops of the  
trees.  It only flies the last week of 
June and the first fortnight of July,  
the rest of the time it is a           
caterpiller.   The caterpillers eat    
leaves of young blackthorn.  The adults
eat the nectar of a plant called       
privet.   The butterflies lay eggs at  
the Cow Pastures because the conditions
in the blackthorn are just right.      
Glapthorn Cow Pasture is one of the    
very few places in Britain where the   
Black Hair Streak Butterfly is found.
