		<title>05Brickhouse Farm,Congleton</title>
		<content>    Brickhouse Farm is situated two    
 kilometres north of{Congleton.} It    
 covers an area of 175 acres, 65 of    
 which are used for growing potatoes,  
 and the rest is used for peas, barley 
 and grazing. They have 275 ewes and   
 400 lambs, including some store sheep.
    Traditionally,{Cheshire}is a dairy 
 county, but now fewer than half of the
 farms are dairy farms.  In addition,  
 the number of farms is decreasing, as 
 the size of each farm increases.      
    Crops are grown in a five year     
 rotation.  There are two types of     
 barley, "Spring barley" and "Winter   
 barley."  The peas are used to feed   
 the animals.                          
    The wool goes to 'North England    
 Wools', and is used to make clothing  
 and carpets.                          
    Sheep, cattle and pigs are used for
 meat and breeding purposes.           </content>
