		<title>07ST. JOHN'S CHURCH,COTEHILL</title>
		<content> Our church is called St.John's.       
 Our church is about 120 years old.    
 We have a Sunday school called the    
 Young Eagles .It is called that       
 because the symbol for St. John is an 
 eagle.The church has an odd shaped    
 tower built at the side.              
 Our school goes across to the church  
 on Ascension Day for a special service
 in which children from our school read
 the lesson and read special prayers   
 they have written.Sometimes we play   
 recorder for the hymns.               
 Our vicar is called Canon Wingate.    
 He also comes into school once a      
 fortnight for our school assembly.
