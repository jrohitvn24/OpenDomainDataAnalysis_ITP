		<title>04THE OLD RAILWAY LINES CONT.</title>
		<content>However,from the old railway bridge    
near the Railway Inn,Halmerend,going   
towards Leycett,the line is completely 
overgrown and no ash track has been    
laid.Here,we can follow the track for a
short while before it becomes overgrown
with large bushes and trees and        
impossible to follow.                  
The Newcastle Countryside Project have 
recently been improving the lines near 
the school planting new trees and also 
building steps and handrails at various
points leading up to the road.         
Today the lines are used by people for 
walks or by pupils coming to school.   
There are still other reminders of the 
old railway in the village such as the 
Railway Inn,Station Road,the station   
masters house and two giant walls near 
school where the bridge used to cross  
over the road.
