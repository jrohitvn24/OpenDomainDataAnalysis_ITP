		<title>07A DAY IN A SCHOOLGIRL'S LIFE</title>
		<content>             MORNING                   
    My name is Jennifer Giles and I am 
 10 years old. On Tuesdays I wake up at
 0730 hours and practise the piano     
 until 0800 hours. Then I get dressed  
 and have breakfast. At 0845 hours I go
 to school and on the way we collect   
 Louise, who is 5 years old with blonde
 hair and blue eyes. When we get there 
 I walk round the playground with my   
 best friend Amanda. The bell goes at  
 0855 hours so we have enough time to  
 change our shoes and take our coats   
 off before Assembly at 0900 hours.    
 After that we have registration which 
 takes about 5 minutes. Then we do     
 English and Humanities lessons until  
 playtime, which is from 1030 till     
 1045. Next we have Mathematics until  
 lunchtime at 1200. Most people have   
 school cooked lunch, but I have       
 sandwiches.                           </content>
