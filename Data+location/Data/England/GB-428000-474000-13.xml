		<title>13  THE OLD JAIL</title>
		<content> Outside the old Estate house there is 
 a jail. It is a little round building 
 with a pointed roof. It is made of    
 snecked  stone with dressed stone     
 round the windows  which are iron with
 bars in. The roof is lead and conical 
 shaped. The walls and roof are three  
 metres high. There is a carved wooden 
 spike on the top. You cannot see the  
 door of the jail from the road because
 it is behind a wall.We peeped round   
 the corner expecting to see someone   
 but there was no one.We slashed down  
 the nettles and went in.              
    The middle of the roof has fallen  
 in. There is some straw above resting 
 on rotten wooden beams. There were    
 cracked plaster walls. Inside it      
 smells of pipe smoke.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
