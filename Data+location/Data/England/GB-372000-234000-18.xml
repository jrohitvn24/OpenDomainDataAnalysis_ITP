		<content> Some of the properties in the locality
 are quite isolated and some means of  
 transport is essential. There is a    
 local bus service, which operates on a
 circular route to Ledbury twice a     
 week. A bus service operates from     
 Ledbury to Gloucester along the A 417 
 once a week, but villagers have to    
 walk some distance to the main road to
 the nearest stop. Most families have  
 at least one car, however, some older 
 people still prefer to use bicycles or
 walk. The farmers use Landrovers or   
 other four wheel drive vehicles as the
 roads are treacherous during the      
 winter months. The children travel to 
 school on buses or taxis, only five   
 children walk to the local school.    
 There is a Dial-a-Ride bus available  
 for the old and the handicapped, to   
 enable them to obtain their shopping.
