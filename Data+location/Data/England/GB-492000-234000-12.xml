		<content> On the first survey our group visited 
 the public houses and other places    
 where entertainment could take        
 place.Only one pub offered any        
 entertainment the Royal Oak in Aspley 
 Heath has a very low ceiling.(Nicola) 
 Ian, Marc and I went to the Library.  
 Once it was a Quaker Meeting House.   
 We went in and Mrs. Appleton said     
 we could look at the gravestones. The 
 lady at the library gave us a book    
 about them and we found that the      
 oldest was a lady who died on         
 Christmas Day and the youngest was a  
 three year old boy. Altogether there  
 are 33 stones giving names of l7 men  
 and 3l women but we could not read six
 of the stones.(Neil)
