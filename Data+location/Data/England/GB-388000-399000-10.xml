		<title>10YOUNG CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content>{TIME}is a game you play with a ball. 4
 people stand in a square and you throw
 the ball round. The first person to   
 drop the ball has to run after the    
 others. We have to say                
 "10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,Time. If that   
 person does not tig anyone he is out. 
                                       
{WHIP AND TOP}You wrap the string round
 the top, put it on the ground, put    
 your thumb on top of it and whip your 
 whip away. Continue whipping for as   
 long as you like.                     
                                       
{PIGS CAN'T FLY}One person is on and   
 the others stand in a line 8 or 9 feet
 away. The person who is on says       
 something like "Clowns are sensible". 
 If it is true you would run, if it is 
 false you stay where you are. The     
 first person to tig the one who's on  
 changes places with them.             </content>
