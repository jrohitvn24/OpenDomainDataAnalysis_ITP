		<title>15  The Manor House</title>
		<content> Next to the church is the Manor       
House,or{Judith's House},so called     
because the Manor of Yardley Hastings  
was given to the Countess Judith by    
Willam the Conqueror after he passed   
through the village.It is one of the   
oldest secular houses in the County of 
Northamptonshire, and is scheduled as  
an ancient monument. The original Manor
house may have been built by John de   
Hastings who died in 1325, or his son  
Laurence.The Manor itself passed       
through a succession of hands until    
1524 when it passed into the Compton   
family with whom it remains today.     
Excavations have revealed that the     
Great Hall was 45ft. by 30ft. and the  
part still standing is thought to be   
the service section of the Old Manor   
House, containing the Buttery and the  
Pantry,with a large Parlour above.It   
also boasts a Norman arch and walling. </content>
