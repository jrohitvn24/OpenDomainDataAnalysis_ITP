		<title>03VISIT TO HUCKNALL COLLIERY</title>
		<content> On my visit to{Hucknall Colliery }we  
 went past the count house and walked  
 to the car park where a man called    
 Glen met us and gave us a helmet to   
 protect our heads. We went to the     
 control room. There were two big TV   
 screens with a picture of the coal    
 underground so that they can see if   
 there is an emergency and where it is.
 Next we went to the shower room. There
 were a lot of showers and lockers and 
 there was a shoe cleaner. Next we went
 to the wheel room where there was a   
 big wheel. This big wheel is used to  
 make the lifts go up and down the     
 shafts. Then we went to the tip where 
 they had planted grass and conifer    
 trees. We were told that there are    
 Christmas parties and trips to the    
 seaside and there is a Welfare band,  
 bowls and 2 football teams.
