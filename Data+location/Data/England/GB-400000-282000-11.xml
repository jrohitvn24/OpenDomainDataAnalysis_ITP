There is very little industry in       
Harborne - only a few tucked away out  
of sight in the back streets. We went  
to F.S. Walters and Sons in Clarence   
Road. The firm started in 1959 in Aston
&amp; moved to Harborne in 1963, into a    
building which had been used by an     
organ maker. Mr Walters is now retired 
&amp; the firm is run by the sons. Eight   
years ago they had twelve workers now  
they only have three and one office    
worker. They make metal staircases,    
iron railings, gates, panels &amp; central 
heating ducts. They work with mild     
steel, copper, aluminium &amp; stainless   
steel &amp; sell their product to builders 
&amp; to other companies. They use a forge,
guillotines, a roller, power saws &amp;    
drills &amp; many hand tools.
