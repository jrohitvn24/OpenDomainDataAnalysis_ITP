 sells sweets,vegtables and freshly    
 cooked bread six days a week.Tuesdays 
 it sells Chelsea buns cooked in its   
  little bakery at the back of the     
 shop.Riddets sell a lot of things     
 they cook them themselves such as on  
 Wednesdays they sell currant buns and 
 on Thursdays they sell Lardy cakes.   
 They sell many things such as washing 
 powder, food, lollies and frozen food.
 Next to this shop is the village pub. 
 The pub has its own dart team, that   
 travels around in the pub's mini bus. 
 Its name is the Lamb Inn.It has a very
 large trade on Sundays and in the     
 summer it has tables outside looking  
 on to the village Green.The chapel is
