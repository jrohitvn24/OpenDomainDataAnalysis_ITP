		<content> Our area is an urban enviroment and   
 whilst there is a fair bit of industry
 mostly space is taken up by houses.One
 group went pond dipping near the      
 museum and came back with 25 different
 specimens.There is a good range of    
 bird life.After playtime we counted 32
 seagulls in the infant playground     
 eating the dropped bits of crisps.    
 We had some ducks in class 1 and after
 six weeks let them go at the museum.  
 Sadly two men were seen killing them. 
 We felt bad so probably the biggest   
 threat to animal life in our area is  
 man.Still alot of effort is made to   
 protect animal life.The nature reserve
 at Parndon Wood contains a lot of wild
 life like rabbits,deer,foxes and owls.
