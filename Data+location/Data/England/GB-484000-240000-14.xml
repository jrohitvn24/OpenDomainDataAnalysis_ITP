		<title>14LINFORD WOODS, MILTON KEYNES</title>
		<content> Linford Wood is 1 km from Milton      
 Keynes' city centre. It is a relic of 
 the forest that once covered Britain  
 5,000 years ago. Records of Linford   
 Wood go back to 1283 when a poacher   
 was reported. The wood has been set   
 aside for walking, exercising,        
 wildlife and forestry conservation.   
 Land round the wood is used for light 
 industry. Trees include oak, ash,     
 field maple, Norway spruce and aspen. 
 There are some dead elm trees because 
 trees have had Dutch elm disease.     
 Speckled Wood and Black Streak        
 butterflies are found. Montague Deer  
 were brought from China to Woburn     
 Wildlife Park, they have escaped and  
 are now in the wood. Many wild flowers
 and birds are found. There is a       
 specially constructed exercise trail  
 called a Trim Trail which has 3       
 circuits of different difficulty.     </content>
