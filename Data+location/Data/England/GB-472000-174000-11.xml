		<title>11Reading's Third Bridge</title>
		<content>   At the moment people have three     
 bridges to choose from,{Caversham     
{Bridge and Reading Bridge,}and further
 away,{Sonning Bridge.}There are many  
 traffic jams at the bridges and on the
 approach roads to them. For people who
 live in Sonning there is another      
 problem. They have to cross an old    
 bridge which is slowly going into     
 ruins. It has traffic lights and can  
 only take traffic one way at a time.  
 For several years{Berkshire County    
{Council}have been considering plans   
 for a new Thames bridge.{Oxfordshire  
{County Council}do not want a bridge so
 much because they are afraid it will  
 lead to development on their side of  
 the river.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
