		<title>12SUTTON HOUSING TRUST</title>
		<content> The Sutton Housing Trust was founded  
 in 1894 under the will of             
 Mr.W.R.Sutton who left one and a half 
 million pounds for the provision      
 of"model low_rented dwellings" for the
 poor of London and other towns.The    
 Sutton estate at Padgate is well      
 designed, the houses set in courts    
 with many walk_only areas and at least
 15 play areas for children. Shrubs and
 trees have been planted wherever      
 possible and so,though the gardens are
 small,the general landscaping gives   
 many householders the impression that 
 they are in rural surroundings.The    
 landscaped areas are very well        
 maintained by a team of workmen, and  
 the tenants have  pride in their area.
 The design of this estate is in       
 contrast to the "ribbon development"  
 of the post war council estates       
 nearby.                               </content>
