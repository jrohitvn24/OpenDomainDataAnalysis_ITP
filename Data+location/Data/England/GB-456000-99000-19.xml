		<content>    My family has a lot of things to   
 do, we can go to the beach,go         
 swimming,play tennis and a lot more.I 
 often play on my own in our garden. I 
 play tennis on one of our walls in the
 drive  or play swingball with my      
 sister in the garden.I have a big room
 where I can play with my friends.     
 Sometimes I cycle to Marek's house    
 and play football.I go swimming       
 quite a few times a week.My sister has
 several leisure activities - like     
 playing with her guinea pig and       
 drawing.We play football and rounders,
 thumper rounders too, which is fun.In 
 Lee-on-the-Solent one of the best     
 leisure places is the beach.          
 We have an Arcade(with game machines),
 a Swimming pool,Tennis and Squash club
 and a Golf course.The church has a    
 Sunday school and Family services.    
 There is also a Community Centre.     </content>
