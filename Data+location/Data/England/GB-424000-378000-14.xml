		<title>14Longshaw Lodge</title>
		<content> Longshaw Lodge was originally part of 
 the Longshaw Estate and was used as a 
 shooting lodge by the Duke of Rutland.
 The whole Estate comprising 11533     
 Acres were put up for sale by auction 
 in July 1927 without restrictions. The
 prospectus for the sale advertised the
 Parklands as suitable for a Golf      
 Course and the woodland as affording  
 several "Beautifully placed building  
 sites". A joint committee of the      
 Sheffield council of Social Services  
 and the Sheffield Asscociation for the
 Protection of Local Scenery resolved  
 to purchase Longshaw Lodge and its    
 grounds of 747 acres, upon the        
 paymaent of Â£13000 raised by bank     
 overdraught. The repayment of this was
 achieved by public subscription. This 
 made possible the conveyance of the   
 Estate on 25th March 1931 to the      
 National Trust.                       </content>
