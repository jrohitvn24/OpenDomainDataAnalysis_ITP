		<title>14WORSTON MILL</title>
		<content> Worston Mill was built in 1814 by John
 Milner as a water-driven corn mill.   
 Milner also owned an adjoining silk   
 mill.  However, when the adjacent     
 railway was built in 1850 the         
 vibration of the trains broke the silk
 threads or the glass needles used in  
 this mill.  It closed and was         
 demolished in 1890.  Worston Mill is a
 typical mill of the area of its time, 
 having 3 floors and an attic, and     
 being built of unglazed red brick and 
 tile.  It was in use as a corn mill   
 until 1970.                           
 The present owners acquired the mill  
 in 1972 and restored and extended it  
 as a restaurant in 1981.  The mill    
 cannot now be turned by the water as  
 the Water Board took the water rights 
 in the course of 'river improvement'.
