		<content>   West Meon Station closed 26 years   
 ago. The bus services which replaced  
 the trains have now shrunk to         
 Petersfield-Winchester and            
 Petersfield- Southampton daily        
 services which pass through the       
 village. Children travelling to       
 Petersfield have a coach provided by  
 the Local Authority. A weekly         
 community mini-bus service to Fareham 
 was started in July 1985.             
   The area is desirable to those who  
 can afford to commute to work or to   
 the train at Petersfield by car, and  
 this has greatly enhanced house       
 prices. This factor, plus the lack of 
 local employment, has meant that many 
 move away from the village. Only 15%  
 of mothers and 9% of fathers of       
 children at West Meon School had also 
 attended there.
