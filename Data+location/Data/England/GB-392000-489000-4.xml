		<title>04WILD ANIMALS AND BIRDS</title>
		<content> There is an abundance of wild animals 
 in the area, the most profuse being   
 rabbits. Foxes from time to time      
 disturb the flocks. There are several 
 known badger setts and there has been 
 trouble with badger hunters from the  
 cities, although, at the moment, the  
 setts appear to be undisturbed.       
 A few otters survive, although not in 
 the numbers of a few years ago.       
 Stoats and weasels inhabit the areas  
 along the dry-stone walls.            
                                       
 Chaffinches are perhaps the most      
 common of the many species of smaller 
 birds. Curlews inhabit the higher     
 ground and their distinctive cry      
 haunts the fells.                     
 Heron and oyster-catchers are         
 frequently seen on the Ure and its    
 tributaries.                          
                                       </content>
