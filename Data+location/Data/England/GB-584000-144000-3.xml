		<content> The{Sheep}bred locally are Romney and 
{Southdown}which produce strong sturdy 
 lambs in the Spring.With modern know- 
 ledge and good husbandry, many ewes   
 give birth to twins-sometimes triplets
 Sheep go through a"Dip"of disinfectant
 to prevent disease,in Summer they are 
 shorn,the fleeces sold for spinning   
 wool.Some lambs are slaughtered and   
 the meat is sold locally,others go to 
 market. Dairy herds consist of{Jersey 
 or{Fresian}breeds which give a high   
 milk yield and rich cream. Like sheep,
 the cows graze outside most of the    
 year,supplimented with winter feed of 
 hay or silage.Bullocks are also grazed
 during the Summer and put into covered
 yards for wintering.{Horses}are kept  
 for riding; free range{Chicken}provide
 eggs and{Ducks}and{Geese}are fattened 
 for the table.
