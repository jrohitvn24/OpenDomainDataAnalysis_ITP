		<content>{How many deliveries were made in the  
{village?                              
 A coal wagon came once a month. The   
 deliveries of groceries were made in a
 pony and trap. Everything else they   
 had to fetch by walking or biking to  
 Ripley. Later on, an open decked bus  
 ran to Ripley.                        
{What was it like at School?           
 It was very strict and you had to pay 
 one penny on Monday to buy books for  
 the school. We did  dictation and     
 arithmetic and composition. We had to 
 learn tables for homework, and if you 
 didn't do it you had to go to the     
 front of the classroom and face the   
 wall.                                 
                                       
               {
