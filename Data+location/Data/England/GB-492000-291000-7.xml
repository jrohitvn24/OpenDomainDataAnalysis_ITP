		<content>The village school in Deene is now     
closed, but in the past it catered for 
the educational needs of children from 
Deene and Deenethorpe.                 
Today there are few children in the    
locality, only five in Deene, and when 
they reach school age it is necessary  
to travel two miles north-east to the  
village of Bulwick. From this primary  
school they transfer to Kingscliffe    
Middle School, and then complete their 
education at Prince William School, in 
Oundle.                                
In fact, during this study it was      
discovered that some parents in the    
district preferred the public school   
educational system, and sent their     
offspring to Stamford.
