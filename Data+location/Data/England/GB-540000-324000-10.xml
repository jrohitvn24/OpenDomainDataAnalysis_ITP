		<title>10THE CHANGING COMMUNITY.</title>
		<content> For many hundreds of years the Elloe  
 Marsh community has been a closely    
 knit independent group of people. In  
 the twentieth century, improving      
 transport facilities has enabled a    
 growing number of people to explore   
 the narrow lanes of this bleak and    
 open,yet attractive environment. Many 
 people have felt attracted to this    
 open area, as it offers such a great  
 contrast to the hemmed in hustle and  
 bustle of the city life.The area is   
 also becoming rapidly more popular    
 with London commuters, who can reach  
 the capital easily within two hours   
 using the H.S.T. rail service from    
 Peterborough.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
