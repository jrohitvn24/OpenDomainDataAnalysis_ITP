		<title>07East Town Hamlet cont.</title>
		<content> post box, public telephone or bus     
 service,the community has to be very  
 self sufficient, particulary in winter
 when it is liable to be  cut off by   
 snow drifts. One resident told us that
 she went shopping in Trowbridge once a
 week for the family provisions.       
      However the isolation of the     
 hamlet was quoted as a bonus by the   
 residents we spoke to. People said    
 that they liked the "peace", that it  
 was a "retreat", "a completely rural  
 situation, yet only 5 miles from      
 Trowbridge".                          
                                       
      My friend lives at East Town Farm
 and I go up there to play.We play Hide
 and Seek and we make dens in the hay. 
 In the barn we make ramps to jump off,
 and we play follow the leader on      
 bikes.     Nikolas Farley age 11.
