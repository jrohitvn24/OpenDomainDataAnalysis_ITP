		<title>12Scunthorpe Family Weekend I</title>
		<content>{ Scunthorpe Family Weekend}started as 
 an added attraction at the athletics  
 and cycling meeting at{Quibell Park.  
 It was taken on by the{Scunthorpe     
{Federation of Community Centres}about 
 17 years ago and was then a single day
 but has now grown into a two day      
 festival.                             
  The Chairman of the federation,      
 together with about 300 volunteers,   
 organise all the many things needed   
 for such an event, from tickets to    
 tea, from electricity laid on to      
 looking after lost children.          
  One of the regular attractions is a  
{parade}of decorated floats. There were
 26 floats this year (1985), including 
 Cubs and scouts, Viking Radio,        
 Frederick Gough Swiming Club and local
 youth clubs. The floats started from  
 Everest Road and paraded through town 
 to Quibell Park.                      </content>
