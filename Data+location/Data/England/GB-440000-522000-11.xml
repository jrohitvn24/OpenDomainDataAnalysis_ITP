		<content> Within the whole of our "block"there  
 is not a single doctor's surgery, and 
 this means people have to travel to   
 Stockton,Billingham or Norton to visit
 a doctor. Very recently a dental      
 surgeon has set up in practice within 
 close proximity to the school and in  
 addition a private Nuffield{hospital  
 has been established off Junction     
 Road.Also there is an{Old People's    
{Home,}both day care and residential   
 patients,close to our school.         
 To look after our{health}and keep a   
 watchful eye on us{school nurses}and  
 doctors pay regular visits to         
 school.Among other things we have our 
 sight tested, teeth and scalp         
 inspected and our general health      
 observed. Our teachers often remind us
 of foods to eat and how to look after 
 our bodies in order to stay healthy.
