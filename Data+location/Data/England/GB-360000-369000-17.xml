		<title>17GOLF CLUB,SANDIWAY</title>
		<content> The course is built on sand so in hot 
 weather it is watered all the time.   
 It is 63 years old with 18 holes and  
 69 bunkers.  It is 6350 yards long,   
 covering 150 acres.                   
 The course originally went right up to
 the single carriage road but a        
 compulsary purchase order was issued  
 to allow the building of the dual     
 carriageway.  To replace the 3 holes  
 lost, land was bought from local      
 industry.  Any people over the age of 
 12 can join but at the moment there   
 are no more places for male members.  
 There are very good facilities        
 including a bar, changing rooms and   
 lounges in the club-house, but you    
 have to be a member to use these.     
 None of the rooms can be hired by the 
 public.  The course only has a club   
 license.  The price is different      
 according to age.                     </content>
