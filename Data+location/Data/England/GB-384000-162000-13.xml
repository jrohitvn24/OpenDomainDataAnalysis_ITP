 St Mary's Broughton Gifford           
 Where St Mary's now stands a church   
 was erected in 13th.c., considerably  
 altered in 15th.c. and restored in    
 1850. Features of interest include a  
 piscina in the chancel and the chantry
 chapel. The east wall is hollowed to  
 form a recessed curve over the altar. 
 To the north of this is a squint and  
 the remains of stairs leading to the  
 roof loft, the north arcade is 13th.c.
 The porch had a wooden ceiling        
 originally forming a 2nd storey, the  
 stone stairs to this can be seen in   
 the west wall, the east wall has      
 glazed slits once used by lepers.     
 Inside the south door is a curious    
 brass in memory of Robert Longe.      
 There have been 58 rectors at the     
 church since the first in 1308.
