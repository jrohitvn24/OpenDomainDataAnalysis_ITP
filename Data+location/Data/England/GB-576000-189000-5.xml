		<title>05Housing in New Thundersley</title>
		<content> There are considerable contrasts in   
 the types and distribution of the {   
{housing }in the area.                 
 Around the two commons there are a    
 number of large two-storeyed houses   
 built around the First World War and  
 between the wars - rendered, and with 
 tiles made in the local{brickfield}now
 closed down.(It was next to the Little
 Common).Other houses on the clay      
 land are, first, {plotland-bungalow,} 
 these are dispersed, small, and       
 originally built of very flimsy       
 material - asbestos, hardboard, with a
 pebble - dash exterior.               
 Second there are many new housing     
{estates }in the south of the area;    
 these display the irregular  cul - de 
 - sac form common to the modern       
 housing patterns of chalet            
 development.
