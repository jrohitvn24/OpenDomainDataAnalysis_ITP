		<content> Homme House is situated on the        
 southern side of the village.It has a 
 private path leading from the church  
 to the house,which would have been    
 used by the family when attending     
 church.The house was built in two     
 parts.The first part was built in     
 about 1627 probably by Sir John       
 Kyrle.This part of the house has      
 battlements and a canted oriel        
 window.The later part of the house is 
 Georgian,and has six bays and two     
 storeys.There is a porch of two pairs 
 of Tuscan columns and a contempary    
 canted bay window. Inside is a curved 
 flying staircase and late Jacobian    
 panelling. In the grounds there is an 
 octagonal seventeenth century summer  
 house. The present owner is Vice      
 Admiral Sir Ernle Kyrle Pope,who has  
 been there ten years. The house is    
 private but the grounds are rented out</content>
