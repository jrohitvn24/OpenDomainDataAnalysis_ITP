		<title>01THE AREA AROUND WALKINGTON.</title>
		<content>  THE AGRICULTURAL NATURE OF OUR AREA  
 MEANS THAT MOST DATA IS CONCERNED WITH
 THE ONLY POPULATED PART,THE VILLAGE OF
 WALKINGTON.3 MILES TO THE EAST IS THE 
 COUNTY TOWN OF BEVERLEY;10 MILES SOUTH
 EAST IS THE CITY OF HULL.THESE TWO    
 CENTRES PROVIDE FACILITIES NOT PRESENT
 IN A VILLAGE OF 1850 PEOPLE,AND ARE   
 ALSO THE MAJOR AREA OF EMPLOYMENT.    
  A VERY PRETTY,SELECT AREA IS MARRED  
 BY A THROUGH ROAD AND TRAFFIC TO THREE
 PUBS.NEW ESTATE HOUSING IS ALSO       
 SPOILING THE RURAL CHARACTER.FOLK     
 WOULD LIKE MORE FACILITIES AND BUSES  
 BUT MAINLY THE YOUNG AND OLD USE THEM.
  ALTHOUGH WITHOUT ANY MAJOR FACILITIES
 THE VILLAGERS HAVE MANY SOCIAL EVENTS,
 CLUBS AND SOCIETIES.                  
  A VILLAGE IN A PLEASANT RURAL AREA IS
 QUICKLY BECOMING A SMALL "TOWN",MINUS 
 THE SERVICES TO COPE AND MUCH TO THE  
 ANGER OF LONG_STANDING RESIDENTS.     </content>
