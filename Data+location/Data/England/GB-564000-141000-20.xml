		<title>20Domesday Oak - Brenchley.</title>
		<content>   It is exciting at this time of the  
{900th}anniversary of the{Domesday Book
 to work in the vicinity of a relic of 
 those early times.We gained permission
 to go and see the{Domesday Oak,}the   
 surviving tree of{ANDERIDA,}an ancient
 wealden forest.It is possibly{14}or{15
 hundred years old.Without any warning 
 in the summer of{1945}it broke in two,
 but even now with a split trunk it is 
 still very much alive.It has a girth  
 of about{11 metres.}Today reinforcing 
 concrete is used to support it.The    
 tree gave us a feeling of history and 
 is a link with the original book.
