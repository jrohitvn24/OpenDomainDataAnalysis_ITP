		<content>     We visited Chertsey Museum.  There
 was a Viking sword which was found in 
 1981.  By the sword there was a       
 shield, a spearhead and  a dagger.    
 There was a big dolls house with lots 
 of things inside.  There were lots of 
 old clocks which were all working.    
 One room was full of pottery and one  
 was full of clothes from the last two 
 hundred years.  In the corridor there 
 was a quill pen with a ginger feather.
      We went out into the garden where
 there was a grave stone and a rocking 
 elephant which we were allowed to     
 ride on.  The Museum is open Tuesday  
 to Saturday in the afternoon.  It was 
 a very interesting visit.
