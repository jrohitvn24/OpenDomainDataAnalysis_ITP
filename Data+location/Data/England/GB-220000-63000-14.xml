		<title>14TOURISM IN THE DOBWALLS AREA</title>
		<content>  TOURISM HAS AN IMPORTANT PART TO PLAY
 IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY. MANY EARN THEIR 
 LIVING WHOLLY OR PARTLY, DIRECTLY OR  
 INDIRECTLY FROM THE TOURISTS WHO FLOCK
 TO THE S.W.                           
   WE HAVE A MAJOR TOURIST ATTRACTION  
 IN THE FOREST RAILROAD PARK, WHICH    
 INCLUDES A GALLERY OF PAINTINGS BY    
 THORBURN. THIS IS OPEN FROM MARCH TO  
 OCTOBER AND EMPLOYS A LOT OF YOUNG    
 PEOPLE AND WOMEN ON A PART TIME BASIS.
 MANY FARMERS ALSO TAKE GUESTS. THERE  
 ARE ALSO HOUSES KEPT AS HOLIDAY LETS  
 AND MANY HOUSEHOLDS TAKE IN BED AND   
 BREAKFAST GUESTS.                     
   TOURISM CAUSES US PROBLEMS WITH     
 TRAFFIC,IT CAN TAKE 20 MINS. TO CROSS 
 THE A38 ON A SATURDAY IN AUGUST, IT   
 CROWDS OUR SHOPS, BUT IT ALSO KEEPS   
 THE SHOPS, THE GARAGE AND THE PUB     
 OPEN. WE NEED TOURISTS. WE SHOULD     
 LEARN TO LIKE THEM AS WELL.           </content>
