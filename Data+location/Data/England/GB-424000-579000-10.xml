		<content> People feel that more can be done to  
 provide facilities, especially a      
 swimming pool &amp; sports centre.  The   
 Community Centre does not provide     
 adequate compensation. Many           
 activities take place in the area but 
 financing can cause problems.  Some   
 activities are financed by            
 enthusiasts or sponsors but sometimes 
 grants are available.  Traditional    
 activities still flourish. Football   
 and cricket are popular, many pubs and
 organisations having their own Sunday 
 football team. Cricket has its own    
 annual competition. Many boys carry   
 on playing the sports they learned at 
 school. Tennis and golf are played    
 and the scenic walk in the area are   
 used by horse riders as well as       
 walkers and cyclists.  BMX cycling is 
 popular.
