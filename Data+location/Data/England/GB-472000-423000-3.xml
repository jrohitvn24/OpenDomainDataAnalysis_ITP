		<content>  Goole has a wide range of{shops,}the 
 majority of them situated on          
 Boothferry Road and Pasture Road.     
  Along Boothferry Road,well served by 
 a large free car park, are nationwide 
 stores such as Woolworths,Boots,Marks 
 and Spencers,Halfords and Currys      
 interspaced with smaller specialist   
 shops:-jewellers,bakers,boutiques etc.
 The shops of Boothferry Road are well 
 established and the area has an air of
 stability about it.                   
  In Pasture Road however where shops  
 are smaller, the shops are of a more  
 transient nature. Almost every week   
 shops open and close then re-open     
 selling different commodities under   
 new management or ownership.          
  Video libraries,shops selling ladies 
 fashions,carpets,bicycles,toys,cards  
 and electrical goods have come and    
 gone over the last two years.         </content>
