		<title>17EMPLOYMENT IN GULVAL</title>
		<content> Many Gulval people work in Penzance,  
 being the nearest town. Employment in 
 the area includes farmers and farm    
 workers, railway workers at the       
 British Rail Depot, school staff,     
 heliport staff, and people working in 
 shops and garages.                    
 The Long Rock Industrial site has     
{light industry.}It includes a         
 British Telecom factory and a group of
 small workshops for hire to small     
 companies or individuals.             
{Tourism}brings seasonal employment to 
 the area. Marazion has hotels, guest  
 houses, bed and breakfast facilities  
 and cafes. The caravan and camping    
 site and Kennegy Hotel Complex also   
 provide jobs.                         
 As in the rest of Cornwall, the number
 of{unemployed people}who are unable to
 find jobs is very worrying.
