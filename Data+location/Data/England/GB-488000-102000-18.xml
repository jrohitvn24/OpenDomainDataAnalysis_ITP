		<title>18RELIGION IN RUNCTON</title>
		<content> This report  refers to the whole of   
 Runcton, not just the area of this    
 survey. Runcton lies within the parish
 of N Mundham.   Practising C of E     
 parishioners have to travel to Mundham
 to worship as there is no church in   
 Runcton.   Of the 500 residents, about
 40 could be said to be regular church 
 goers (at least once a month).   Of   
 these about 10 attend churches of     
 other denominations.  In addition some
 elderly people  attend Communion      
 Services held by the vicar in the old 
 people's home.   It is estimated that 
 an additional 35 attend church on     
 'special occasions' - e.g. Christmas. 
  During the past 5 years 6 children   
 have been baptised, 4 couples married 
 and 18 funeral services held in St.   
 Stephen's Church.
