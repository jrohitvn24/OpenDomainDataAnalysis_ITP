		<title>11TEENAGE LIFE - LITTLE WITLEY</title>
		<content>{  Weekends}generally start on         
 Saturday, yet my Saturday begins like 
 any other day. As a sixth former at   
 the King's School, Worcester, I go to 
 school by coach arriving in Worcester 
 at 8.30 a.m.{School}finishes at 12.15 
 when I usually go into town with some 
 friends to obtain nourishment.        
{  Saturday afternoons}consist of      
 either watching a school home rugby   
 match or coming home with some        
 friends. During the{evening}I get     
 ready to go out into Worcester, where 
 an average evening's entertainment    
 involves going to the cinema, or      
 drinking with a group of school       
 friends.                              
  {Sundays}are often occupied in doing 
 school work that should have been done
 on Saturday. In the evening I relax   
 either watching television or         
 listening to the radio. by Jacky Mills</content>
