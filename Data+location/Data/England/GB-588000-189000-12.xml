		<title>12THE EVENING AFTER SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    When I got home from school I took 
 the dog out for a walk and then went  
 out with my friends to play football  
 until my evening meal was ready. After
 dinner my grandmother came round and  
 brought my costume which she had made 
 for me to wear in the school play.    
    When my grandmother left it was    
 time to get ready for bed.I had a     
 shower, brushed my teeth combed my    
 hair and got into my nightclothes.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
