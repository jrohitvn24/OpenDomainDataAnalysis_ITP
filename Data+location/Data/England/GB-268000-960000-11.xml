 1. {TURRING:}This is the removal of   
 the thick layer of turf from the top  
 of the peat.  It used to be done with 
 a large shovel called a "flachter     
 spade" but now the turf is usually    
 ploughed off with a tractor and a home
 made plough.  2.{CUTTING:} This is the
 hardest job as the peat is very wet   
 and heavy.  One man stands on top of  
 the peat "bank" and cuts downwards    
 with a special spade called a "tusk". 
 Another man stands facing him in the  
 bottom of the bank and throws out the 
 peats - blocks about 50 by 30 by 10   
 centimetres.  Each peat is thrown out 
 on to the top of the bank and the     
 arrangement of spaced out blocks is   
 called "the spread".
