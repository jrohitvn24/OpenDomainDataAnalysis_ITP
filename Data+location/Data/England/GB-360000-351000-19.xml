		<title>19THE ANTIQUE SHOP</title>
		<content> The Antique Shop, Swanley lane,       
 Ravensmoor.                           
  Proprietor: Mrs Booth                
                                       
 The owner has been an antique dealer  
 since 1969 and has another shop in    
 Nantwich. She always wanted to be an  
 antique dealer and enjoys her work.   
    It is a small shop, but very       
 popular with tourists, many of whom   
 come every year. She sells            
 different kinds of antiques from alarm
 clocks to grandfather clocks, from    
 horse brasses to furniture. The most  
 expensive antique she has ever sold   
 was a dresser. The most famous person 
 to ever visit the shop was Brian Cart.
    Her favourite hobby is golf. If she
 could go anywhere in the world for a  
 holiday she would go to Hong Kong.
