		<title>05GROWTH OF WEST HAGLEY</title>
		<content>   The Kidderminster road from the     
 Lyttelton Arms was very narrow and    
 twisting, with high hedges. There was 
 no main road at this time linking     
 Stourbridge to W. Hagley.{Middlefield{
{Lane}began at the forge. The main road
 to Kidderminster was diverted to its  
 present course in 1922,and Middlefield
 lost part of its length.              
   In 1852, the{railway}was completed- 
 the station was built by 1884. A mile 
 away from the old village, it lead to 
 a new community developing at W.Hagley
   By the turn of the century, it was  
 realised that a second church was     
 needed, and between 1900 and 1908     
 money was raised to build{St.Saviour's
 In 1930, the Free Church was built.   
   An{infant school}used to exist in   
 Bromsgrove Road, and a senior school, 
 built by the Lytteltons in 1827. The  
 3 main schools are now in W.Hagley.   </content>
