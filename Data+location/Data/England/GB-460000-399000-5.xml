 development of{housing and            
{amenities.}There was council housing,a
 school and some shops,the area being  
 mainly arable farmland.There were no  
 pubs,clubs or churches,except         
{St.Wilfred's. Hawthorn School}was used
 as a club,then the{Methodist Church   
 and{Hawthorn Club}were built.         
     Then private and council housing  
 started to spread.{Sycamore School    
 opened in{September 1954,Partridge    
{School}in 1964 to cater for the       
 expanding area.                       
    There is also a change in Wild life
 too.Before there were wild flowers and
 many birds and animals around,the

 trees and people and the{house martin 
 has replaced the skylark.
