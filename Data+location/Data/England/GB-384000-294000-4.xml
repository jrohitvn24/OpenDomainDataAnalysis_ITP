		<title>04The Mill House, Seisdon.</title>
		<content>                                       
   Our house is the old Mill House,    
Seisdon.  It is 236 years old. It      
was a water mill. Next door to us used 
to be waste ground but now it has been 
changed into some new  housing. While  
the JCB diggers were digging it all    
over they found our old mill stone.    
   There used to be a stream running   
along side and the wheel picked up the 
water and turned the stone. The mill   
still has three floors.There is a      
piece of machinery, which used to pull 
up the cogs, left in the mill.
