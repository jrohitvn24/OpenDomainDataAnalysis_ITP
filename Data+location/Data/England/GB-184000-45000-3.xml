  Between{1885}and{1905}the building   
 was a blacksmiths workshop. The school
 opened in {1905.                      
 The children which attend the school  
 are aged between {5}and {7}years      
 old.They come from Tresillian and     
 other surrounding hamlets.Twenty one  
 children attend the school.They are   
 taught by one teacher which is        
 the Headmistress.There is one         
 classroom and a kitchen in the        
 school.They are taught:{              
{maths,english,spellings}and{P.E.}The  
 teacher and the ancilliary helpers    
 are very concerned about the road     
 because it is dangerous to the        
 children because of the amount of     
 traffic on it.                        
  When the children leave the infant   
 school they will go to a primary      
 school in Truro.                      </content>
