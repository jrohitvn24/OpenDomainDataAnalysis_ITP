 The Parish Council is democratically  
 elected by the village every three    
 years.  It has no power, as such, but 
 is our link with local government  and
 planning office and can make          
 recommendation on behalf of the       
 village, to these bodies.             
 Prior to every Parish council meeting 
 there is a Democratic half hour and   
 the inhabitants of Sydling are free to
 question and make suggestions to their
 elected council.  People realise that 
 the Parish council are frustrated by  
 their limited powers but feel more    
 pressure could be put on the County   
 District Councils with regard to      
 limiting the numbers of new houses,   
 verge cutting road maintenance and    
 other important matters.
