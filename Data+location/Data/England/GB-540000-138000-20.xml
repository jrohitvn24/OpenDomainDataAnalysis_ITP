		<title>20AIRCRAFT NOISE</title>
		<content> Our area is bout 11 kilometres East of
 Gatwick Airport, and lies partly under
 the main flight.According to their    
 Public Relations Department the       
 airport has about 500 daily air       
 movements.We spent several days       
 counting and found that in fact the   
 average was about 20 planes overhead  
 in an hour.Most people we asked seemed
 not to notice the noise very much     
 unless the aircraft was very low, or  
 the person had recently moved into the
 area.When we mentioned the word       
 "Pollution", most people,although     
 vaguely 'against' it, they thought    
 mainly about fumes, smoke and lead    
 from petrol.They did not worry about  
 noise. There is however a report in   
 the local paper that 'the airport     
 will be under-used without a second   
 full sized runway.
