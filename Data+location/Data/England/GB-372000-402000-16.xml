 The disused railway line which runs   
 through the area was closed down by   
 Dr. Beeching about 14 years ago. It   
 has a gravel bottom and is becoming a 
 dumping ground for rubbish and litter.
 It is used by local people and        
 children as a short cut to the        
 shopping precinct at Walkden. Some of 
 the residents feel it is becoming an  
 eyesore and a danger. They feel that  
 with a little work better use could be
 made of the area as a recreational    
 facility. The original station site   
 was near to where the Ellesmere public
 house now stands. The railways were   
 originally needed to transport goods  
 to and from industrial Manchester.    
 However, with the decline of the area 
 industrially, we have inherited the   
 legacy.
