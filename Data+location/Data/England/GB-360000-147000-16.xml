		<content>{CHURCHES}The three Anglican churches  
 in the area now come under one rector.
 The three churches are at Ashwick,    
 Binegar and Oakhill. Recently the     
 large vicerage at Ashwick was sold and
 the rector moved to a more managable  
 house in Oakhill. At present the      
 church at Oakhill is under threat of  
 closure due to the need for expensive 
 repairs, but villagers are fighting   
 the issue. The only non conformist    
 church remaining is the Methodist     
 Chapel in Oakhill, the old United     
 Reform Chapel has recently been       
 converted into two houses.            
{PUBLIC HOUSES}Of the 4 inns in the    
 area, the George Inn &amp; the Mendip Inn 
 began as coaching inns while The Horse
 and Jockey began when the railway was 
 built. The Oakhill Inn served a large 
 working population. They are still    
 village inns attracting passing trade.</content>
