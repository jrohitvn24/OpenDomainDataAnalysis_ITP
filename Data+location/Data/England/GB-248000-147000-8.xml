		<content>  Ilfracombe was once called           
 Alferthingcomb(Alfred).Ilfracombe is  
 an ancient sea port and market        
 town.The port of Ilfracombe was very  
 important in the 18th century,and to  
 show this the following figures are   
 quoted:29 ships cleared,1,167 tonnage 
 cleared,and 40 average tonnage per    
 ship.Most of the ships went to and    
 from Cork and a few to Barbados in the
 West Indies.The railway was built to  
 Ilfracombe in 1874 and helped tourism 
 in Ilfracombe.It was closed in 1970.  
 About 165 years ago Ilfracombe        
 consisted chiefly of one long street, 
 but about twenty years later          
 accommodation was built for the many  
 visitors.Rows of tall houses and      
 villas were built on the terraces.Two 
 major fires happened in the same place
 one in 1896 and the other in 1983.Also
 shipwrecks have occured off the coast.</content>
