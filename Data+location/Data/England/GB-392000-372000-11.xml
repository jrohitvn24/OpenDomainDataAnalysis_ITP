		<title>11CANAL ENVIRONMENT</title>
		<content>  The towpath shows both environmental 
 pollution and people beginning to care
 and try to put some things            
 right.People walk their dogs along a  
 newly widened and surfaced path.There 
 are new steps down from some road     
 bridges and seats.The canal is        
 bordered by stands of Great Willow-   
 herb,Yellow Iris,Branched Bur-reed and
 Water Dock.We recorded many other     
 flowers including Gipsywort,Skullcap  
 and Cookoo-flower.There are 4 species 
 of fern and a variety of grasses,trees
 and shrubs.We saw 5 pairs of Mallard  
 and Water-vowl.Fishermen reported     
 catching Roach,Perch,Bream and        
 Gudgeon.It amazed us how fish managed 
 to survive in dirty water with almost 
 no aquatic life except the odd        
 water-snail and microscopic           
 creatures.We were horrified at the    
 amount of litter from the school.     </content>
