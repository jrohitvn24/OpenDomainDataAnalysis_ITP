		<title>02MANOR FARM, ODCOMBE</title>
		<content> In our village we have several farms, 
 one of which is called Manor Farm.    
 Sarah Lloyd and Jenny Francis have    
 surveyed the farm.They were told that 
 the farm had{196 cows,}and{96 acres   
 which was mostly{grazing.}The older   
 buildings are made from the local     
 yellow-brown sandstone,but several of 
 the newer, bigger outbuildings are of 
 wood and corrugated iron sheeting.    
 Although the farm is on one of the    
 main streets of the village cows or   
 farm vehicles are not often out on the
 roads as there is easy access to the  
 fields. Some of the farm lanes are    
 also used by the public for walking   
 but the one past Manor Farm was so    
 overgrown this summer that no-one     
 could use it.
