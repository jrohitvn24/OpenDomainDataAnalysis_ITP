		<content> New York is an  agricultural area. It 
 is flat ad open. Arable farming is    
 predominant. Light, sandy soil in the 
 north grows Leeks, early potatoes     
 sugar beet and spring barley. Heavier 
 soil in the south grows winter        
 cereals. Land drainage is vitally     
 important. Large drains collect water 
 permeating from higher land to        
 the north of the area. The village of 
 New York was established after the    
 drainage of the fens in 1810 . There  
 are thirty houses within the village  
 boundary. The rest of the population, 
 totalling 230 for the whole area, is  
 scattered around the surrounding      
 farmland. As agriculture has become   
 more mechanised, farms tend to be     
 family run units and no longer provide
 employment for the majority of local  
 people.  However, seasonal work can be
 found in potato harvesting gangs. New </content>
