		<title>09The Yorkshire Sculpture Park</title>
		<content> The Yorkshire Sculpture Park is in the
 grounds of Bretton Hall College.As we 
 entered the park we passed the        
 sculpture zoo.People were given wood, 
 string and nails to make animals to go
 into the sculpture zoo.We were allowed
 to go into the kennel block to look at
 the project about birds that students 
 had been doing.We all liked the       
 Triceratops because it had the most   
 detailed shape.Then we walked down to 
 the totem pole.It was brightly        
 coloured.We went to see the Family of 
 Man which was by Barbara Hepworth.We  
 saw the men putting together  an      
 exhibition of Ossip Zadkine.Some of   
 the sculptures are weird but we think 
 it is a good idea to make people think
 about things.
