		<title>07The Oxford Canal-Kirtlington</title>
		<content>The Oxford Canal was one of many       
engineered by James Brindley. It was   
built to link the River Thames at      
Oxford to the Grand Union Canal. There 
are 39 locks between Oxford and        
Braunston, the nearest to Kirtlington  
being Pigeon Lock. Pigeon Lock was     
built in 1788. The canal builders      
reached Northbrook on 13th August 1787.
They finally reached Oxford on 1st     
January 1790. The canal used to be used
mostly to transport freight but now it 
is used mainly for pleasure purposes   
such as fishing and holidays. We       
believe that there is still a coal     
merchant who travels the canal. The    
bank has recently been reinforced with 
metal corrugating. To find out more
