		<title>04Annual Events in Ripe</title>
		<content>      May Day is celebrated in Ripe as 
 it has been for years with maypole    
 dancing. First the children learn the 
 dances and a May Queen is chosen from 
 the older girls by drawing straws, but
 no one is allowed to be May Queen     
 twice. Then the younger girls draw    
 straws for being attendants. The      
 dresses are brought out from their    
 moth balls. Every girl makes her own  
 posy and they all meet at the village 
 centre. The May Queen and her retinue 
 are ensconced in horse drawn carts and
 the proccession wends its way from the
 Lamb Inn down Ripe Street round the   
 finger post to the garden where the   
 dancing takes place. The may pole is  
 decked with coloured ribbons and the  
 girls dance round and weave the       
 ribbons. Teas are served and stall    
 selling cakes and crafts help to make 
 money for repairs to the church.      </content>
