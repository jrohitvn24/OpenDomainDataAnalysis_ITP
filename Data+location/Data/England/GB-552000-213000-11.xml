		<title>11The Holy Trinity Church</title>
		<content> We have two churches in our village,  
 the United Reform Church and the one  
 opposite our school, the Holy Trinity.
 The latter is a very well noticed     
 landmark as you can see it from each  
 of the six roads that converge on the 
 Heath.  There is a plaque on the      
 church which says,{"To the glory of   
{God, this dedication stone of the     
{church of Holy Trinity was laid on the
{eighth day of July MDCCCLVI by W.     
{Whewell D.D. Master of Trinity College
{Cambridge." }The oldest grave I could 
 find was erected in 1866.  All the    
 children from the primary school,     
 which is opposite, attend a termly    
 service in which they read the prayers
 and also poems and stories they have  
 written.  The Village Institute is in 
 the church grounds and it is here that
 Sunday school classes are held as well
 as clubs such as Youth Club.          </content>
