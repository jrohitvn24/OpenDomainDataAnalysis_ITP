 Overproduction of cereals nationally  
 has encouraged cereal farmers to      
 experiment with other crops such as   
 oilseed rape, peas and beans. A recent
 innovation to the area is the growing 
 of potatoes as a 'break' crop. The    
 potatoes are often 'Record' variety,  
 grown specifically for the Crisp      
 market. Agriculture still provides the
 best opportunity for employment in the
 area, but much less so than formerly. 
 As a consequence, cottages occupied by
 former farm workers are increasingly  
 being sold off as week-end retreats   
 or retirement homes.
