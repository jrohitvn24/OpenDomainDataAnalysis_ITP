		<title>16BARNS IN THE COLN VALLEY.</title>
		<content> Massive stone-built barns with a      
 central opening and stone-slated roofs
 are a dominant feature of the         
 Cotswolds. As their use for           
 agricultural purposes wanes, many are 
 being converted to other uses. That on
 Lower Farm in Coln Rogers is still    
 used for drying grain, and the        
 14.Century Ablington Barn is also used
 for storage, beautifully kept and     
 re-roofed some 20 years ago as the    
 owner's "gift to posterity". Shoecroft
 Barn in Bibury is used for storage on 
 the ground floor, with a flat for the 
 manager of the Trout Farm above.      
 Winson's Lower Barn and Corner Barn   
 are used for refrigerated food        
 storage, but Saltway Barn near        
 Ablington was too dilapidated to be   
 rescued, and its large supply of      
 dressed stones and stone slates was   
 used to build a house in Rendcomb.    </content>
