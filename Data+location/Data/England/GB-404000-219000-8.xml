		<title>08FARMING IN HAMPEN</title>
		<content> Hampen Manor Farm belonged to the same
 family for 200 years.The present      
 owner farms 80 hectares,two thirds    
 used for cereals,the other third for  
 pasturing sheep and beef cattle. He   
 claims that he and neighbouring land  
 owners have planted more trees during 
 the past 10years than were planted in 
 the previous two hundered.            
 He owns two or three fields with      
 lynchetts,or mediaval terraces once   
 used for cultivation.This land is too 
 steep for present day ploughing so the
 lynchetts are left undisturbed.Now    
 overgrown with grass,they provide     
 excellent tobogganing for the family.
