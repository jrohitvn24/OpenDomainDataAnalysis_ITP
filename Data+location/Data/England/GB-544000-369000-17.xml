  Mr.Smith was born in Alford and was

 and his wife moved to Willoughby in   
 1957 and have both worked tirelessly  
 for nature conservation.Mr.Smith

  My dad was five when he started      
 keeping chickens.So he knew a lot     
 about them by the time my Grandad     
 died.He had kept chickens since he was
 nine and he taught my dad how to carry
 them and get them ready for shows.Now 
 my dad has over three hundred birds   
 and is the best breeder in Britain.He 
 goes to nearly all the shows every    
 year and sometimes he judges at them.
