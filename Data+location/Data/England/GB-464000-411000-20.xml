		<title>20Survey of Eating Habits.</title>
		<content> Three main meals a day and a snack    
 before bed time is usual. We often sit
 in the kitchen or dining room using   
 knives and forks, but sometimes eat   
 off a tray in front of the T.V.       
 For breakfast toast is most commonly  
 eaten,cereals coming second.Cooked    
 breakfast of bacon,eggs etc.,is eaten 
 by about one third of our sample.     
 Potatoes, meat and vegetables such    
 as peas and carrots,are the most      
 commonly eaten dinner,with fish and   
 chips not quite as common.Some people 
 prefer to have a cooked meal at       
 tea-time and a snack at mid-day.Supper
 is mostly just tea and biscuits. From 
 our survey we found that the average  
 spent on each persons food was Â£10.91 
 per week.
