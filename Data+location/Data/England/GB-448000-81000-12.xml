		<title>12ECOLOGY: EAST YAR RIVER.</title>
		<content>     The extreme S.E. part of our block
 is crossed by the E.Yar River on its  
 way to Bembridge. This river forms the
 eastern boundary to Lavenders Farm and
 Bridge Farm. Near the bridge in Beacon
 Alley the river's average width is 2m.
 Its average depth is 41cm.The river   
 has a muddy bottom and frogs can be   
 found.                                
     Between "Rainbow's End"(a small   
 holding) and Lavenders Farm, a path   
 leads to the river where a water mill 
 once worked. The mill is in ruins;    
 there are only three walls standing   
 and a bit of the roof. The water wheel
 is still there.                       
     Near the ruins a wooden bridge    
 stands over the river but, funnily    
 enough, there is a brick bridge       
 underneath. Downstream there are a few
 drainage pipes leading into the river.
