		<title>14BEING DISABLED IN 1985</title>
		<content> Swinton Court is a home where able and
 disabled people live together.It was  
 opened by the Duchess of Kent in 1978.
 Mr.Buckland is in charge of the home.I
 talked to 2 disabled people,Roger and 
 Michael.They told me what is was like 
 to be disabled in 1985:"Its better    
 than it was.People dont stare as      
 much," Michael told us.I felt lucky to
 be myself.Our class saw the workshop. 
 The jobs these people had to do ranged
 from simple tasks to more enjoyable   
 jobs such as working in the toy       
 workshop and printing.Some charities  
 arrange holidays for the disabled     
 people.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
