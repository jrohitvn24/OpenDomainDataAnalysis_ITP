		<content>   Mr.Hooper,caretaker of Montgomery   
 School,remembers when the River Exe   
 burst its banks.In Buller Road there  
 is a house showing the level of the   
 flood on October 21st,1960.Mr.Hooper  
 says,"It was the most frightening     
 sight I have ever seen.Brown water    
 gushed down Manor Road and Redvers    
 Road into School from Okehampton      
 Road,breaking up cars,smashing windows
 and uprooting trees."                 
   Children were evacuated from School 
 using the meals van and with the help 
 of the Marines.Mr.Hooper carried an   
 old lady in Brunswick Street upstairs 
 to safety.She was sitting on a chair  
 ankle deep in water as her slippers   
 floated out through the door of her   
 home.                                 
   Flood relief channels have been     
 constructed to prevent this happening 
 again.                                </content>
