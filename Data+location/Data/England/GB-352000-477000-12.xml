		<title>12THE CANAL</title>
		<content> THE CANAL WAS OPENED ABOUT 1818 AND   
 WENT FROM KENDAL TO LANCASTER.A BOAT  
 WOULD NOT GET THROUGH TODAY AS THERE  
 ARE SOME CULVERTS FOR THE NEW ROADS   
 TO CROSS THE CANAL.MOST PEOPLE WHO USE
 THE CANAL GO FOR WALKS ALONG THE      
 BANK.SOME SCOUTS GO CANOEING ON IT.IT 
 IS ILLEGAL TO GO FISHING WITHOUT A    
 LICENCE,BUT SOME PEOPLE DO.YOU CAN    
 CATCH TROUT,PIKE,EELS AND ROACH.ABOUT 
 SIX MONTHS AGO IT WAS DRAINED OFF TO  
 BE FIXED.IN SOME PARTS IT IS CONCRETE 
 BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS LEAKS.IT HAS JUNK 
 AND GLASS AT THE BOTTOM SO IT IS      
 BETTER NOT TO GO SWIMMING IN IT       
 ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE DO.
