		<title>06PGL Adventure Holiday</title>
		<content> I went on an adventure holiday with   
 the school. This is one of the        
 activities I enjoyed.                 
 On Tuesday afternoon we went abseiling
 . Mrs. Cowlrick was the first to go   
 down then it was my turn. The first   
 bit was a bit scary but not very. Neil
 Moss and I were the only ones to do   
 the Irish Crucifix.Neil's was alright 
 but mine was slipping. After a bit it 
 was alright. An {Irish Crucifix}is    
 where you hang upside-down, with your 
 arms out and legs together. Then some 
 of us went down forwards.These are the
 people who did. There was Sally,Owen, 
 Neil and I. It was much more          
 exciting.By Ashley Toyn, aged 11.
