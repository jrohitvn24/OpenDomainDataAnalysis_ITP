		<title>07History: Gadshill Area</title>
		<content> The area around Gadshill was mentioned
 by Shakespeare as being noted for     
 highway robbery. This was a problem   
 for a very long time. The main road   
 still passes through the same places  
 on its way from London to the coast,  
 so it would have been a busy highway  
 in coaching days.                     
 Pockets of new housing have sprung up 
 in the areas of Gadshill and Shorne   
 Ridgway since 1945. Village life is   
 not considered to be what it was by at
 least some of the present residents of
 the area. There is no longer, they    
 say, the same closely connected       
 community life. There are many        
 families living in the area who use   
 the villages rather as dormitories,   
 while they commute to London,         
 Gravesend or Rochester.
