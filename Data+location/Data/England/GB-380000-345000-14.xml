		<content>Thistleberry House,Newcastle,Staffs was
built in 1961 for people over the age  
of 65, who were not capable of living  
alone.A matron and a total of 36 full  
and part time staff look after them.   
The majority  of the inhabitants have  
lived in Newcastle for most of their   
lives.Each of them has their own room  
but all meals are cooked for them.They 
eat a good,varied diet including       
breakfast,a hot meal and sandwiches    
each day.                              
Personal pets are not allowed,but the  
home has some fish and a budgerigar.The
old people may go on weekly day trips  
to local places.Some are lucky enough  
to take longer holidays with family or 
friends.They spend their time talking, 
listening to the radio or watching T.V.
Some knit or play cards and dominoes.  
All of them noticed changes in fashion,
local shops and new houses.            </content>
