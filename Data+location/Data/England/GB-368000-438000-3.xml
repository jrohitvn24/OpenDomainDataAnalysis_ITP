		<title>03BIOGRAPHY OF C.WATERTON.</title>
		<content>   Charles Waterton, the eccentric     
 naturalist, explorer and taxidermist, 
 started as a pupil at Stonyhurst      
 College in 1796, when he was 14. When 
 he left in 1801, his reflections were:
 "The day I left the Jesuits' College  
 was one of heartfelt sorrow to me .." 
 He turned his house, Walton Hall, into
 a nature reserve, building a high wall
 around the 259 acres. His explorations
 were recorded in his book, "Wanderings
 in South America".                    
   While at Stonyhurst he climbed one  
 of the eagle towers and, when half way
 up, was told by a Jesuit to come down.
 That night the stone onto which he    
 would have next clung fell to the     
 ground, so he narrowly escaped        
 death.The famous portrait of Waterton,
 featuring the stuffed cat's head      
 resting on a book, hangs in the Top   
 Refectory of Stonyhurst College.      </content>
