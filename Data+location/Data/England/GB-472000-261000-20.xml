  In this area there are many houses,  
some are privately owned, some are     
council houses and many are sheltered  
homes for old people.Some of the houses
were built at the turn of the century  
to house shoe workers.Others have been 
built in the last twenty years.Some    
people are quite poor and others very  
well off.There is a lot of unemployment
in the area.                           
  There are a number of factories and  
warehouses in the area and some of the 
people work in these.There are a Lower 
a a Middle school in the area but there
is no Upper school within easy reach of
the community.Children are taken right 
across town by a free bus service or if
they choose to go to a different upper 
school have to make a long journey to  
reach it.
