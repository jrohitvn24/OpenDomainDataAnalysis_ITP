		<content>{One Pick Barge:}                      
 One Pick Barge is a game for three or 
 more players.You need a long stretch  
 of ground with a line or wall at each 
 end.You have one person on, who stands
 in the middle of the ground, while all
 the others stand at one end.The person
 who is one shouts the name of somebody
 who is against the wall.The person    
 whose name has been called then       
 attempts to get to the other end      
 without being picked up by the person 
 who is on.If the runner gets to the   
 other end, all the players on the wall
 also try to get to the other end.If   
 the person who is manages to catch    
 somone  that person is on with        
 him.This carries on until everyone is 
 on.The person who was caught first is 
 on in the new game.
