		<title>09FARMING</title>
		<content> Farms in this block tend to divide    
 their time between raising dairy      
 cattle (80%) and growing arable crops,
 particularly Cheshire potatoes.There  
 is some farming of silage on a        
 commercial scale.                     
  The dairy cattle are Friesians,      
 although recently,Jersey and Guernsey 
 cattle,which produce richer milk,have 
 been introduced. The changes in E.E.C.
 milk quotas have caused considerable  
 hardship to many farms with bankruptcy
 and amalgamation of small uneconomic  
 farms becoming increasingly common.   
   The production of arable crops      
 however, seems to be on the increase, 
 and shows a profit. Potatoes,carrots, 
 sprouts,cabbage and cauliflowers are  
 grown on the sandy not too fertile    
 soils where care of the crops is easy.
 The potatoes are transported in bulk  
 to markets throughout the country.    </content>
