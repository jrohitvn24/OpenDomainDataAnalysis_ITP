		<content> Residents of the Cleat hill area were 
 asked for their views of the area.Most
 found it was nice and quiet though    
 the traffic has become busier.It is   
 definitely a place for the more       
 elderly or those who do not mind the  
 slower pace of life.It is a friendly  
 place with few robberies or vandalism 
 and little litter.Shops are about a   
 mile away and it does not seem to make
 much difference whether you have your 
 own transport or not since buses run  
 quite frequently.Surprisingly the     
 younger generation who have moved into
 the area do not like the new modern   
 attractions-they preferred it as it   
 was.Apparently it is quite a wealthy  
 area as most children have horses or  
 ponies.Residents have lived here for  
 an average of 12 years.
