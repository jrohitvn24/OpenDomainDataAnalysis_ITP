   My Grandad is the Caretaker for     
Wells Primary School.  He's done the   
job since 1969.  When I went to the    
Primary I went to see him after school.
Here's what he does in a day.          
a.m.                                   
 6.00   He gets up                     
 7.00   He goes to work                
 9.00   Goes home for breakfast        
10.00   He goes back to work           
p.m.                                   
12.00   He goes home for dinner        
        (sometimes he has it at school)
 1.00   Goes back to school            
 6.00   He goes home                   
   His job is cleaning the classrooms, 
the toilets and getting tennis balls   
from the roofs and from underneath the 
mobile classrooms.  He has 2 ladies to 
help him.  The infants recently gave   
him a scrapbook with pictures of him.  </content>
