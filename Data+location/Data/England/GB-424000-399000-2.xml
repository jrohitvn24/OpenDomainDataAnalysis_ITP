 On our farm we keep cattle we have 20 
 bulls and about 11 cows. We keep them 
 for meat we get our cows off Mr. B.   
 Fox. We keep our cattle in a barn,    
 there is room for about 15-20 cows. We
 are building 2 more barns for cows in 
 the winter. We feed our cows with hay,
 silage and corn.                      
                                       
{DEAN HEAD FARM}                       
 Dean Head Farm can be traced back to  
 1379, when Joan of Dene was living    
 there. It is notable because the barn 
 and the old part of the farmhouse are 
 of{Cruck Frame}construction and are   
 believed to be 600 years old. The     
 timbers of the house are believed to  
 be old ship timbers. The "new" part of
 the farmhouse was added 400 years ago.
