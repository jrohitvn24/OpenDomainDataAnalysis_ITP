		<title>03Lowland areas near Coniston</title>
		<content>{LOWLAND}As well as Coniston village,  
 the lowland area surrounding the head 
 of Coniston Water consists of a mosaic
 of farmland and woodland. The{farmland
 is all intensively managed{grassland, 
 the in-bye land of local farms.       
 Usually these small fields are        
 conserved for{hay and silage.}Also    
 they are grazed by sheep and cattle.  
 There are many blocks of{woodland;    
 mainly{oak,}with{ash, sycamore, birch,
{willow}and{hazel}as the most prominent
 species. One or two woods are small   
 coniferous plantations. Some of the   
 woodland, particularly that at        
 Coniston Hall and Park Coppice, is    
 used for{caravan sites.}Networks of   
 rough roads thread through the trees, 
 which effectively conceal the caravans
 from view.
