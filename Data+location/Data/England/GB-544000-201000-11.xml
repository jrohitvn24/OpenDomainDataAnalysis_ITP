		<title>11EPPING'S COMMUNITY HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>{St.Margaret's Hospital}in Epping      
 started as a{workhouse}and parts of it
 are a Victorian monument to sadness   
 and misery.It changed into a major    
{casualty hospital}in the Second World 
 War.Many of Epping's inhabitants were 
 born there,and old people of Epping   
 die in Forest Wing.                   
 The most recent change is taking place
 now. Princess Alexandra Hospital,     
 Harlow, is now to be the major        
 hospital. St Margaret's is to be a    
 centre for the{mentally handicapped   
 and{the elderly.}Also included in     
 future plans are an audiology unit and
 a hearing aid centre due to come into 
 operation in September 1985. Geriatric
 units are to remain as they are. Three
 out of the four units at present are  
 for female elderly, with 54 female and
 14 male patients.   (cont.)
