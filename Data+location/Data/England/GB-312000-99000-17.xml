		<content> BUCKERELL IS A SMALL VILLAGE IN A     
 FARMING COMMUNITY. IT USED TO HAVE A  
 POST OFFICE AND A SCHOOL BUT NOW HAS  
 NEITHER. OF SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY  
 IS THE CHURCH OF ST. MARY &amp; ST. GILES,
 WHICH IS WITHIN THE PARISH BOUNDARY OF
 FENITON. MANY OF THE FARMS IN THE     
 VICINITY HAVE BEEN MADE INTO GUEST    
 HOUSES. PLANS ARE IN PROGRESS FOR A   
 CHILDREN'S PLAYPARK BEHIND BUCKERELL  
 LODGE. VILLAGE MEETINGS ARE HELD IN A 
 PRIVATE HOUSE AS THERE IS NO LONGER   
 ANY OTHER SORT OF MEETING PLACE.      
  BUCKERELL HOSTS A COMMUNITY OF       
 FARMING FAMILIES WHO HAVE KEPT THE    
 FARM IN THE FAMILY THROUGH THE AGES.
