		<content>   A few people are self-employed      
 locally but most are not. Most people 
 are in service industries. This       
 survey was carried out fairly late  on
 Friday afternoon and so many people   
 interviewed were either retired or    
 housewives.                           
  In Bramley there is a home for old   
 people (Blunden Court) and also an    
 area called Home Park where old       
 people live in bungalows. There is a  
 resident warden.                      
  In Bramley there are two churches,   
 the Parish Church of the Holy Trinity 
 and the Roman Catholic Church of      
 St.Thomas Moore.                      
  There is also a library which is well
 used by local people. It has a car    
 park outside which is used by people  
 who live outside Bramley and come here
 to shop or go to the library or       
 Post Office.                          </content>
