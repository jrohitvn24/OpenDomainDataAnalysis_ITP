		<title>09NEW HOSPITAL IN CALOW</title>
		<content> The first part of the new General     
 Hospital was opened in March 1985.    
 It is built where Plover Hill Farm at 
 Calow used to be.                     
 This part has accident and emergency  
 units,operating theatres,Xray,therapy 
 units, medical,surgical, and childrens
 wards.                                
 We can see the top of the chimney of  
 the boiler house from school,but soon 
 this will be hidden when the trees    
 they are planting grow bigger.        
 Now they are building more childrens  
 wards,a unit for old people,maternity 
 wards and units for the mentally ill. 
 When it is finished about 350,000     
 people,in Chesterfield and N.E.Derbys.
 will use it.It should provide nearly  
 all the services we need.
