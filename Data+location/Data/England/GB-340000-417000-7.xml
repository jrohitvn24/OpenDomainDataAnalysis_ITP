		<title>07The Sewage Farm at Holmes.</title>
		<content> At Holmes there is a Sewage works     
 where the dirty and used water for    
 Holmes, Merebrow and Tarleton is      
 treated. it can deal with 1,100,000   
 gallons of sewage at once. It is a    
 very smelly place but friendly people 
 look after it. The dirty water goes   
 through a lot of pumps; different     
 machines and filter beds which clean  
 it. In it there are lots of little    
 animals called Bacteria which live on 
 the sewage and they help to clean the 
 water.                                
    The sludge at the bottom of the    
 tanks is pumped into lorries and put  
 on the farmers fields. You can        
 sometimes smell the sludge on the     
 fields. the sewage farm was opend in  
 1967 before then septic tanks where   
 used. It is very intresting and       
 exciting place to visit.
