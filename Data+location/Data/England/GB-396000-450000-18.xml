 C.P school. This ia a small school of 
 about 220 pupils and serves two large 
 housing estates:{Horse close}and      
{Greatwood.}There are{seven}class rooms
 in the main building and{two outdoor  
{class rooms.}Greatwood has a lage hall
 which is normaly used for{assembly}and
{indoor P.E.}and a much small dinning  
 hall. Greatwood is the only Primary   
 school in Skipton to have been built  
 since the second world war, and the   
 only school in Skipton to have a large
 playing field surrounding the school. 
   The field is used in warm dry       
 weather, but not when it's winter and 
 when the weather is wet. In summer we 
 play out. We normally play{cricket}or 
{football. At}morining break we have   
 kind of a{tuck shop}which sells{crisps
