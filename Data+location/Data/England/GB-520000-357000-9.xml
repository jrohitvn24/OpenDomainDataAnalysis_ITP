		<title>09OUR DENTAL UNIT</title>
		<content> A working day for Mrs.Mulraney is very
 busy.She starts work at nine o'clock  
 when the first person comes in. Mrs.  
 Mulraney is the helper to the other   
 lady,who is the dentist. Lots of      
 things are involved in Mrs.Mulraney's 
 job.There are about eighteen patients 
 a day.There are a lot more things     
 involved like the chair that goes     
 up,down left,right the spitoon which  
 is a basin beside the chair which has 
 a flow of water and also they have a  
 drill unit.One of the drills is       
 powerful and one not so powerful,and  
 also there is an Xray unit and light. 
 The  dental unit covers twenty three  
 schools +pre school children, pregnant
 mothers,handecapped children/adults.  
 She covers North Kyme to Partney to   
 Tattershall to New York.They hope to  
 become fully mobile in the future but 
 the present  surgery will stay here.  </content>
