		<content> Smarden has clubs and organisations to
 suit all ages and inclinations. The   
 youthclub has a clubhouse and the     
 Guides and Brownies their own hut. The
 sports pavilion is home to the cricket
 football and hockey teams which play  
 on the Minnis while the Tennis Club   
 has its court on the opposite corner. 
 The younger boys have a BMX cycle     
 track at the back of the Minnis. The  
 Women's Institute, Gardeners' Society 
 and Over 60s club meet in the village 
 hall while smaller meetings are held  
 in the committee room: the Ancient    
 Order of Foresters, Parish Council,   
 British Legion, Young Farmers' Club,  
 Parochial Church Council and St       
 Michael's Guild. In winter the Ashford
 Valley Foxhounds and Hunt meet at a   
 Smarden public house and the Pony Club
 holds meetings at Bullands.
