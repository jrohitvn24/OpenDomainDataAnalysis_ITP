		<title>18Growth of Trimley</title>
		<content>    Part of a big new housing estate is
in our block.  Over the past ten years 
hundreds of houses have been built on  
what used to be farmland. This building
has had a big effect on the village.   
The Primary school,just outside our    
block, has grown from about 240 to     
about 400 in five years.It is now being
extended.New shops have been opened and
a bus service runs through the estate. 
  No new playing fields have been made 
and there is the need for a proper     
village hall. Some people think the    
village is better now it is bigger.    
Others say that it has changed so much 
that it doesn't seem like a village    
any more. The estates are nearly       
finished now and there is not much     
room for more building between the High
Road and the by-pass,  so perhaps      
Trimley will not grow much more.
