		<title>03Transport-The River Ouse</title>
		<content> The{River Ouse}runs to the south of   
{Cliffe and Hemingbrough.}It is part of
 a large river system with several     
 river tributaries which rise in the   
 Pennine Hills and flow out to the     
 North Sea via the Humber Estuary.The  
 southern parts of the parishes of     
 Cliffe and Hemingbrough have been     
 affected by the course of the river   
 which has changed on a number of      
 occasions in the past.Today the       
 river is enclosed within banks which  
 are raised above the surrounding      
 ground to prevent it flooding.The     
 river here is very slow and follows a 
 meandering course. The{"Oldways"}is an
 oxbow lake formed because the river   
 cut itself off and followed a shorter 
 course.The new land was thus added on 
 to the parish of Hemingbrough. It is  
 called{Newhay}but was once part of    
{Drax.                                 </content>
