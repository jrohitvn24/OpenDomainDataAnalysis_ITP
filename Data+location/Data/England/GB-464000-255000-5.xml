		<content>The Baptist church in Bugbrooke was    
revitalized in 1969 when the pastor    
and deacons were "filled with the      
Holy Spirit"(Acts 2:4).                
 Since then a large community has      
grown up round JFC in Bugbrooke with   
committed members living in Community  
Houses of up to 30 adults pooling      
their resources into a common purse.   
 The movement has expanded into nearby 
counties and the Fellowship have begun 
a chain of health food shops,a building
supply merchants and several farms.    
 The movement has generated much       
controversy as rumours have spread     
about what goes on in the church and   
homes, but much good is being done to  
rehabilitate drug addicts etc.,and the 
members are totally committed to their 
cause.In the minds of many outside the 
village ,"Bugbrooke" is associated     
with the Fellowship.                   </content>
