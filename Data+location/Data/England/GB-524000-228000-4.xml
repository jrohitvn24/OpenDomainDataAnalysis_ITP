		<title>04HOUSING IN WESTON</title>
		<content> Weston is an{expensive area.}House    
 prices start from thirty thousand     
 pounds for a{terraced cottage}in need 
 of restoration. Most of the houses are
{privately owned,}there is a small area
 of{council housing}which is of cul-de-
 sac design and rather isolated. There 
 are{bungalows}and an{old peoples      
{wardened housing area.}Around the     
 church and the green are the oldest   
 houses. At present there is a{derelict
{cottage}in Fore St. damaged by fire.  
{Weston Manor}in the Park and{Lannock  
{Manor}are owned by the Pryor family.  
 Many of the smaller outlying{cottages 
 were originally for{farm workers}in   
 this agricultural area. The relatives 
 of several schoolchildren have built  
 property here which include two houses
 off Maiden Street and a cottage in    
 Hatch Lane which is now being         
 extended.                             </content>
