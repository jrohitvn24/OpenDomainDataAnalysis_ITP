		<title>02Housing in the villages</title>
		<content> The housing has not undergone many    
 changes and the new houses and        
 bungalows blend in well with the      
 traditional black and white thatched  
 cottages, so the villages have not    
 lost their beauty.{

{HOUSES WE LIVE IN.                    
 "Our house is old and made of wood and
 some brick. The roof is tiled. It has 
 8 rooms and 14 windows. It is about   
 600 years old and used to grind corn. 
 It is an old granary."                
 "I live in a detached house at the top
 of a lane. It is made of brick (rough 
 cast) slates, guttering and glass. We 
 are having an extension built so our  
 kitchen is knocked down."             
 "I live in a modern bungalow and we   
 have a lot of garden, we have 5 acres.
 My dad teaches horticulture.
