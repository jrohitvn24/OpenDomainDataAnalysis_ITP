		<content>Tuesday morning, the market stall      
holders are setting up their tables for
the weekly open-air market. Food and   
clothes stalls are added and the market
grows in size. In the New Town the shop
assistants of Waitrose start arriving, 
people rush through the High Street in 
their smart clothes hoping not to miss 
their London-bound trains. 4 o'clock,  
schoolchildren fill the pavements, the 
stalls pack up, rush hour traffic      
starts to clog the streets until       
Waitrose's lights dim and a shadow     
covers the High Street. Saturday sees  
the streets full of teenagers, mothers 
with children, visitors, tennis        
players, cricketers. Sunday comes,     
people going to Church, dinners        
roasting, early bedtimes. Monday       
morning, streets jammed with           
schoolchildren, cars, commuters -      
another week in Beaconsfield begins.   </content>
