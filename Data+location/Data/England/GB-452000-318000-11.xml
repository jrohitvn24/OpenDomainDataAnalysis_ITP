		<title>11THE PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Parish Church was built in stages.
 The top part of the church is 65O     
 years old and the tower which is the  
 newest part of the church is 55O years
 old.The Parish Church is in Steeple   
 Row  and is the oldest church in      
 Loughborough. When you look at the    
 ceiling  there are gold and silver    
 angels and devils.The gold and silver 
 pictures hold the hammer beams of the 
 church roof. There is a great         
 wooden door which you can't open      
 because it has been bricked up.       
 There is supposed to be a secret      
 passage from the church to the        
 antique shop over the road, but this  
 is not very likely to be true.
