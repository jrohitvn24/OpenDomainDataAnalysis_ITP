		<content>  The centre of Chorley and Coppull is 
mainly low-rise terrace housing.Since  
the mid-l960's,estates of semi and     
detached houses have been built on the 
fringes of both towns.There has been a 
policy of rejuvenation and clearance of
Victorian housing in the centres and   
open spaces have been landscaped.In    
l970 Chorley became part of Central    
Lancs New Town.Motorway and rail links 
were meant to attract new industry and 
72,000 new properties were to be built 
overall.Farm land has been used at     
Eaves Green for low density housing as 
part of this plan.Terrace house prices 
in the block start at l0,000 pounds +  
and new 2 bedroom semis from l9,000    
pounds plus.
