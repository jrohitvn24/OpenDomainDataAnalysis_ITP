		<title>11Dunford's Garden Centre.</title>
		<content>   As we went there we went through    
 Chapel Park.  When we got there we saw
 grow bags and fancy flower pots,      
 mushroom bags and pepper plants.  The 
 price of the pepper plants was 49     
 pence each.  There were some things   
 for cats and dogs, toys and pet food. 
 There was garden furniture.  What I   
 liked best was the walk there.        
  At the garden centre we saw some     
 sheds and greenhouses.  A shed is made
 of wood and a greenhouse is made of   
 glass.  A greenhouse has a frame for  
 the glass.  You can grow lettuce in a 
 greenhouse and also tomatoes.         
   When we went to the garden centre,  
 we saw flowers and garden gnomes.     
 There were bird tables. There were two
 fountains and I threw 2 pence in and I
 made a wish.
