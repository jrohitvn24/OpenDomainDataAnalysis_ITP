the first motel to be built by this    
 ompany.  It cost Â£255,000 and took    
about 6 months to complete.  There are 
20 rooms.  19 are ordinary bedrooms.   
A double room has a bathroom, double   
bed, double sofa bed and television.   
A family of four would use this type   
of room.  The last room is for disabled
people and has special features such   
as a larger bathroom, only 3 beds      
and a night call button connected to   
reception.  The colour scheme is       
blue, white and pink. The charges are  
#19.50 per night for a single room and 
#24.50 for a double room. 10 people    
are now employed here as supervisors   
or cleaners.  All meals are served at  
the restaurant on the other side of    
the car park.  This facility is aimed  
at businessmen.                        </content>
