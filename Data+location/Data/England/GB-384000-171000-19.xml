		<content>      A fete is held  on the village   
 green in June each year.              
 The money raised is shared between the
 Church and various clubs in the       
 village such as the football club, and
 the Brownies. Donations are given to  
 the W.I Harvest tea and to the        
 Biddestone Broadsheet.                
      The fete is run by a committee.  
 It is usually opened by some notable  
 personality to attract people from    
 far away. There are several stalls    
 selling handicrafts,cakes, secondhand 
 books, bric-a brac,etc. There are     
 games of skill and chance,and a raffle
 with valuable donated prizes.         
       Lunches are served on the Green 
 and home-made teas either in a        
 farmhouse or a marquee.               
       In some years a barn dance is   
 held in the marquee in the evening.
