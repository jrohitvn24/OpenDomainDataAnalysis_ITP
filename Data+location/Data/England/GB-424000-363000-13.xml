		<content>   The main users of the roads for     
 transporting goods in Darley Dale are 
 vans and lorries.Roughly sixty lorries
 and vans passed throughin a morning   
 hour. The roads are not used a lot by 
 everyday people walking to work, most 
 people go to work by car. About a     
 two-hundred and fifty-six cars are    
 driven to work in the rush hour. The  
 minor roads are used by people going  
 to and from home.                     
     ------------------------------    
   There were not many pedestrians in  
 this area and the only people we      
 met were either in a hurry or were    
 simply doing their shopping.          
   One pedestrian said she had no      
 car and that she enjoyed walking in   
 this area although she thought that   
 the pavements could be better.She was 
 on her way to Meadow Stores in Darley 
 Dale.                                 </content>
