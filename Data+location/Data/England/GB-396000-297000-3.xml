		<title>03Landscape_ Pouk Hill Quarry</title>
		<content>  Our class has been finding out about 
 Pouk Hill Quarry.We have found it     
 spelt in four different ways on       
 different ways on  different aged     
 maps.Powk Hill and Pouch Hill. No one 
 seems to know what it means.          
  We saw a photograph taken of the     
 quarry at the beginning of the        
 century.It showed a horse pulling a   
 truck of stone. The truck was on lines
 like a railway.                       
  When we visited the quarry,we found  
 two sorts of rock and identified them 
 as basalt and shale.Basalt isan       
 igneous rock formed by volcanic       
 activity.Shale is made up of layers of
 squashed mud. We found some fossils in
 the shale. Because the rock has run   
 out the quarry has not been worked    
 since early this century.
