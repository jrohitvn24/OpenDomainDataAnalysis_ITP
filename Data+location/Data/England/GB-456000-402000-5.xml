		<content> UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE WORST PROBLEM OF  
 1985 AND IS CAUSING GREAT CONCERN.MANY
 PEOPLE THINK THAT UNEMPLOYMENT IS JUST
 ONE BIG GROUP OF PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE 
 MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS SUCH AS SINGLE  
 PERSONS,SINGLE PARENTS,DISABLED PEOPLE
 AND SCHOOL LEAVERS.                   
 THERE ARE OVER THREE MILLION          
 UNEMPLOYED IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY.THE   
 PERCENTAGE OF UNEMPLOYED IN THE       
 DONCASTER METROPOLITAN BOROUGH IS     
 18.6. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE       
 REDUNDANCIES IN THE LOCAL PITS        
 ANNOUNCED RECENTLY. THE HOPE FOR THE  
 DISTANT FUTURE MAY BE BETTER BUT FOR  
 THE MOMENT THE SITUATION IS GRIM.THERE
 ARE BENEFITS FOR THE UNEMPLOYED TO    
 HELP THEM LIVE AS NORMAL A LIFE AS    
 POSSIBLE. THEY CAN ENJOY SOME SPORTING
 FACILITIES IF THEY ARE CARRYING THEIR 
 'DOLE CARD'. FUTURE TRENDS WILL DEPEND
 ON TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS.            </content>
