		<content> HANSON HOUSE (cont). John Galloway    
 lived here 1874 to 1894 and it was he 
 who designed and build the first      
 locomotive for the Manchester -       
 Liverpool Railway. The original       
 drawing for this is at Hanson House.  
 HILL HOUSE. Robert Robinson bought the
 house in 1612 along with 7 messuages &amp;
 11 cottages from Sir John Radcliffe of
 Ordsall. In 1701 Ephraim Bradbury '   
 was drowned in a tanne pitte' when the
 buildings were used as a tannery. In  
 1725 the then owner drowned near      
 Ashley Hall. Later Symonds Atlee      
 lodged at the house when he was curate
 at Mobberley church. It was his nephew
 who was to become Prime Minister.
