		<title>15Transport - the Butley  Area</title>
		<content>In this area the transport is very     
poor.There is a bus which comes round  
in the morning, lunchtime and in the   
evening to bring the workers home. Most
people have cars. Some people have a   
car sharing system to get to work or go
shopping. There are also School buses  
which service Butley Middle, Farlingaye
High and the First Schools. The nearest
railway station is Melton some 6 miles 
away. This has only recently been      
re-opened. The nearest mainline station
Ipswich some 15 minutes away. London is
one and a half hours away.             
                                       
There is a passenger Ferry at Felixtowe
to go to Belgium. It usually takes 5   
hours to cross but if you take the     
evening crossing it takes 9, because   
he boat goes slowly to enable you to   
sleep. The nearest Airport is Ipswich  
but it only takes Chartered Flights.   </content>
