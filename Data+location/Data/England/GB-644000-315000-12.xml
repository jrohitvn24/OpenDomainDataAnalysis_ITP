		<title>12ACTIVITIES (MARTHAM)</title>
		<content> Villages which are quite far from     
 towns do not have quite so much       
 entertainment as the larger villages  
 and towns. Martham has got a bit of   
 entertainment.The village has a couple
 of pubs one of which has a disco. Also
 there is a CB club which is held      
 upstairs in the other pub. There is a 
 youth club for juniors on one night   
 and seniors on a different night.There
 is a carnival which is held on the    
 first Saturday and Sunday in July.On  
 one of these days there is a          
 procession of floats through the      
 village.                              
 In the Village Hall there are dancing 
 and Judo classes.The local High School
 has evening classes and the village   
 has Brownie,Cub and Scout packs.
