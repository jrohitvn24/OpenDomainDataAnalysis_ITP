 to our lovely scenery and landmarks.  
{BUTTRUM'S MILL,}built in 1828, is a   
 fine tower mill of historic interest. 
 Originally called Trotts Mill (but the
 last miller was Mr G.Buttrum), its    
 present warden is nearby resident{Mr M
{Whitworth(T.2045).}The County Council 
 are restoring it to its orig. cond-   
 ition for opening as a working mill.  
 The{TIDE MILL,}one of East Anglia's   
 most beautiful landmarks, was orig.   
 built approx 800 years ago, but the   
 present mill has been standing for    
 over 200 years (a wooden beam inside  
 is probably 203 years old) and is now 
 owned by the Town Council. Still a    
 working mill, it gets its water supply
 from{Wyllies pool}(dug 4_5 years ago) 
 since the orig. pool is now a marina. 
 Open from March to Nov and worth a    
 visit-contact {Mr G. Dunnett (T.2548).</content>
