		<content> Three_quarters of the block is rural  
 in character. Here are the rolling    
 hills and valleys of the gently       
 sloping dip of the chalk, North       
 Downs.In places a power station by    
 the River Thames, can be clearly      
 seen.There are thickly wooded         
 hilltops,arable fields crossed by     
 ancient hedges and the relentless     
 pylons march on.                      
 Miles of footpaths twist through the  
 woods, meadows and parks, passing     
 silent houses, hidden by fences, trees
 and bushes. Tiny villages are tucked  
 away in winding lanes in this         
 delightful area.                      
 In the western part of the area lies  
 the  suburban  blot of the 2Oth       
 century, a busy road surrounded by    
 houses.
