		<title>07LONG ASHTON NATURE TRAIL</title>
		<content> Dawson's Walk is a nature trail built 
 by villagers, who lost the campaign to
 stop the building of a new housing    
 estate. They decided to use the       
 remaining land for a nature trail,    
 this land being donated by Mr Dawson. 
 The Walk passes by a small pond,      
 through woods, by a flowing stream and
 waterfall. Around the Walk are a few  
 benches and some flights of steps made
 from earth supported by wood. It is   
 a 25-30 minute walk around.It was     
 opened on 14th November, 1982, and a  
 competition was held to find the best 
 name and advertising poster for the   
 Walk. Both winning entries were from  
 Birdwell School. No financial help was
 given by Avon or Woodspring Councils  
 and the project was entirely a village
 effort, costing the Parish Council    
 only Â£400.
