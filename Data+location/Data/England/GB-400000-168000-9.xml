		<content> On 4th July 1985 we interviewed an    
 American couple from the Compton      
 Bassett married quarters. He is a     
{military policeman}at the{U.S. Air    
{Base}at{Greenham Common.}They have    
 lived here for about a year.          
                                       
 They find it cheaper to live in       
 America than in this country but the  
 countryside in this area is very      
 similar to that around their home in  
 the U.S.A. Their son comes to our     
 school but many of the Americans go to
 the{American school}at Greenham. They 
 sent him to an English school because 
 children here start at 4 years of age 
 and not at 7 as in America. They said 
 that they did'nt want their son to go 
 on the long bus trip.                 
                                       
 They thought that houses here would be
 improved if windowscreens were fitted.</content>
