		<content>     The Memorial Hall was finished in 
 1940. It took the place of a hut that 
 had stood there since the end of the  
 First World War. In 1978 to celebrate 
 the fact that Elizabeth II had been   
 Queen for twenty five years, a pair   
 of carved oak door replaced the old   
 ones. Many social events are held     
 here. These include meetings of       
 organisations such as the Womens      
 Institute, Badminton Club, Over 60's  
 Club, British Legion, Goodwil Fund,   
 Playgroup, Mothers and Toddlers Group,
 bistros and so on.
