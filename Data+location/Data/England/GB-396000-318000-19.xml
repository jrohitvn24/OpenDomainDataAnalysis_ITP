		<title>19LANDSCAPE - Brocton Caves.</title>
		<content>  Brocton caves were used as a house   
until February,1945.                   
The house had two rooms.They were the  
living room and the bedroom.There were 
more rooms but they were made from     
sandstone.These rooms were the         
pantry,smallbedroom and kitchen.The    
cooking was done on a small black      
range.The cottage was called Rock      
Cottage. It had mains water but no gas 
or electricity. This meant an oil lamp 
was used for lighting.The last         
occcupant of the cottage was Miss.Mary 
Evans. She was born there and lived    
there until she was eighty.She did the 
garden all herself.It was one acre and 
it had fruit,flowers and vegtables.She 
took these to the market to sell.The   
toilet was at the bottom of the garden 
because there was no modern toilets in 
the house.
