		<title>11THE ELDERLY IN ERITH 1985</title>
		<content>  Erith has a small cottage hospital in
 Park Crescent with 31 beds. Many old  
 people like it because it is small and
 has a family atmosphere. Some elderly 
 patients spend the last few months or 
 years of their life there.            
  Holmeleigh is a residential home for 
 the elderly in Avenue Road. It is     
 bright and cheerful and is home for 61
 people. They are happy living there   
 and have plenty to do, e.g. sewing,   
 reading, watching T.V. or listening to
 the radio. Volunteers come in and     
 provide entertainment.                
  Many elderly people still live in    
 their own homes with family or alone. 
 The Home Help Service provides people 
 to help with housework or shopping.   
 Meals on wheels provide many old      
 people with a cooked meal at          
 lunchtime.                            
  There is a Pop in Parlour in Erith.  </content>
