		<content>After a long time the people of Capel  
got their Shopping Precinct. The       
Newsagents was also built around that  
time and sold sweets,papers,cigarettes 
etc.The Mace Shop started off as a     
bakery selling only flour and home     
baked bread.Then they began to sell    
biscuits and finally turned it into a  
General Store.The newsagents started   
off as a Newspaper Rack outside a      
house,gradually it has grown into what 
it is today.                           
            New Developments.          
  Two Restaurants are now being built  
a "Happy Eater" and a "Little Chef".   
Many people in the village agree to    
this. They are both next to the busy   
A12.The "Little Chef" was started in   
May 1985.At first they had problems    
because the land was partly public     
property.They hope to finish it by     
September 1985.                        </content>
