		<title>01THE WATER TOWER EPPING</title>
		<content> The stately,noble{water tower,}built  
 in 1872 to save Epping from cholera   
 and typhoid, is now being abandoned by
 a careless public authority.One of the
 reasons for closing it down was that  
 the pigeons nesting on the ledge of   
 the Gothic windows were dying,falling 
 into the water tank,and polluting it. 
 Earlier this year the pipes were cut  
 off inside,so now it is just a        
 beautiful piece of {Victorian         
{architecture.}                        
 The tank in the top of the tower is   
 made from iron and holds 30,000       
 gallons of water. Until recently      
 it had been used as an operational    
 depot by a team of six men responsible
 for Epping's water supply.Now it is   
{abandoned}like a forgotten old person.
 The Lee Valley Water Authority wants  
 to sell the whole site,but who will   
 buy a 90 foot towering monument?{     </content>
