		<content> The main village in our area is       
 Ashover and the rest of the area is   
 mainly grassland,fields,farmland.It is
 hilly and has valleys in a North West 
 South East direction.The River Amber  
 runs to the South end of our area.And 
 there are three other streams,the     
 Marsh Brook,Smally Brook and Hodgelane
 Brook.Above Ashover there is a rock   
 called the Fabrick.If you stand on the
 top you can see all around you for    
 miles.There are pictures of animals   
 engraved on the rocks near the        
 Fabrick.The animals are ducks, goats, 
 pigs, dogs and doves.Ashover itself is
 a beautiful country village and a     
 really pretty place to live.
