		<content>  In 1964, the quarter centenary of    
 Shakespeare's birth, 2 members of the 
 Bournemouth Little Theatre Club,      
 decided that something should be done 
 to celebrate this event. They chose to
 perform Shakespeare's "The Tempest" on
 Brownsea Island because of it's       
 enchanting scenery and novel venue.   
 The council at first refused but      
 following a number of meetings        
 consented. The National Trust agreed  
 to sponsor the event. The play was put
 on for 3 nights, but owing to public  
 demand was extended for another night.
 The old cowshed was found to have an  
 electricity supply and so it was      
 decided that the ploughed field behind
 the cowshed should be used as the     
 acting area. Following the success of 
 this first production, performances of
 a play have become an annual event    
 on the island.                        </content>
