		<content>                                       
 This is a day in my life.I get up and 
 go to have some breakfast.Then I go   
 and play on my bike.I go and call for 
 some of my friends,but none of them   
 are playing.I decided to go and play  
 on my computer.I had dinner next and  
 went out again on my bike.Afterwards I
 went tree climbing.I crossed a bridge 
 to get to the trees and started       
 climbing.After clambering up a lot of 
 trees, I went home.I had tea at about 
 five o'clock.I went out till seven    
 o'clock,and then came in.I watched    
 "Street Hawk" on T.V. and went to bed 
 at nine o'clock.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
