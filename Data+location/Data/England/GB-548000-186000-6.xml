		<title>06TRAFFIC IN EAST LONDON</title>
		<content> A busy road in our area in east London
 is Whalebone Lane.A survey was done   
 to find out exactly how heavy the     
 traffic is.We found that in one hour a
 total of 5OO cars,229 articulated     
 lorries and 214 vans passed along the 
 road.The total,including bicycles and 
 motorcycles was 1OO3.                 
         Although the area off         
 Whalebone Lane is mainly              
 residential,the traffic is heavy      
 because the road carries traffic to   
 factories off Whalebone Lane on       
 Selinas Lane Industrial               
 Estate.Whalebone Lane is also a link  
 road for journeys towards central     
 London to the west and a more direct  
 route to the Ford Motor Company works 
 in Dagenham to the south.
