		<title>18Teenage life in Carlton</title>
		<content> Mr X                                  
 Life for Mr X consists of sporting    
 pastimes such as tennis and cricket.  
 At home he reads magazines on BMX and 
 computing. He owns a Sinclair ZX      
 Spectrum and a BMX bike which he rides
 in the streets near home as there is  
 no BMX track in Carlton.After school  
 he works at West Bank Market Gardens. 
 The rest of his time is spent watching
 television.                           
 Miss Y                                
 In the evening and at weekends she    
 does not find Carlton interesting     
 enough, so she visits neighbouring    
 villages. When this is impossible she 
 attends a youth club held at the 'Old 
 School' on Monday and Friday evenings 
 from 7-9pm where there is a pool table
 and disco room. At home she uses ACR, 
 a link between her and her friends in 
 other villages when she can't visit.  </content>
