   The Sports Centre covers a lot of   
ground, about 1.5 acres.The pool,to    
add to the size and cost, holds 66,000 
gallons. The pool is cleaned every two 
years.                                 
   Last year, 1984, 330,000 people used
the Centre's facilities (and the bar!).
As expected, the Centre gets a lot of  
lost property. They get so much of it, 
that which isn't claimed is thrown     
away. Some things, like a sheep skin   
coat, or a wallet, are kept. Even with 
all the money, the Sports Centre       
complex took two years to build.
