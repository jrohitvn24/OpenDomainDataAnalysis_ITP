		<content>  There are two doctors working at the 
 clinic at Bellingham,one of whom has  
 been here for 12 years.A new clinic   
 has recently been built which means   
 that more than more than one          
 consultation can take place at the    
 same time.The clinic has also         
  provided more work in the area.      
 The practice is involved in the       
{Tynedale Accident Service}which was   
 set up to cope with accidents,and     
 means that if an accident occurs,the  
 nearest available doctor will go to   
 the scene.The practice also has a     
 health visitor who visits children at 
 home for routine advice and is        
 available for help with any problems. 
 There are now 12 people working at the
 clinic,including trainee nurses and   
 medical students.The doctors envisage 
 no major changes in the structure of  
 health care in the Bellingham area.   </content>
