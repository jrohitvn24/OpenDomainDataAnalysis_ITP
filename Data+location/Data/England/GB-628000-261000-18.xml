		<title>18Framlingham, occupations</title>
		<content>To give an idea of work in Framligham, 
we made a survey of the occupations of 
the fathers of the 102 children in our 
junior department. Adjusting these to  
percentages gives the following:       
{Farming and allied industries}-25%,   
this is well explained by the nature of
our area(see p8).{Office-workers}-21%  
Farming creates some of these jobs, for
example Framlingham Farmers is a       
company which does much buying and     
selling for farmers. {Building}-20%    
{Professional}(including accountants,  
British Telecom research workers at    
Martlesham and teachers )-8%           
{Engineering (including garages)}-7%   
{Advertising and Sales}-6% {Drivers}   
(lorries out of Felixstowe port),      
{Emergency Services} and {Furniture    
Manufacturers}-all 3% {Timber-worker   
Brewer, Restauranter, Residential      
Home Attendant}-all 1%                 </content>
