		<content>I get up at 8:00 in the morning and go 
downstairs. I have my breakfast        
(Readybreak) and then go back upstairs 
and wash. Then I go downstairs and     
brush my hair. By now it's a mad rush  
for the bus which comes at 8:30 we get 
up to the top of the drive and wait

At about 8:45 we come in to school and 
do maths from 8:50 to 10:35. Then we go
out to play . We come in at 10:55 and  
do creative writing until 12:00 then we
