		<title>03WAYSIDE CROSS</title>
		<content> There is a {wayside cross }at the top 
 of Winson Hill. Some people call it { 
{Winson Cross.}Others may call it a    
 wayside cross. It is there because    
 pilgrims prayed there. It was their   
 first sight of the church tower at    
{Chittlehampton.}They prayed for{Saint 
{Urith.} The cross is made from granite
 because that is a strong stone. When  
 Saint Urith was martyred in           
 Chittlehampton a spring came up and   
 the pilgrims came to see the spring   
 and to wash in it to get healed by its
 waters if they were sick.
