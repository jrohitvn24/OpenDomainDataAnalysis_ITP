 Although there are few facilities for 
 tourists, it is hard to imagine a more
 pleasant area for getting away from   
 the hustle and bustle of town life. It
 is splendid walking country, with     
 lovely river valleys to explore and   
 easy access to{Dartmoor.              
                                       
 We found summer visitors who had      
 rented cottages, a few campers, and a 
 number of cars parked at Cross Furzes,
 their owners presumably engaged in    
 tramping along the Abbot's Way.       
                                       
 And all roads lead to the{Tradesman's 
{Arms}at Scorriton, where many visitors
 (and locals) could be found enjoying  
 the real ale and the local cider at   
 lunchtime.
