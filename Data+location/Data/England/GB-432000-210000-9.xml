		<title>09The church in Hailey.</title>
		<content>                                       
The church in Hailey is set back behind
trees and woodland.The church was built
by Willam Wilkinson about 100 years ago
and was built to look like an old      
church.George Crabbrolfe was the vicar 
at that time so he blessed the new     
church in 1868. It was a coincidence   
that Willam Wilkinson  was George      
Crabbrolfe's son-in -law.The church    
is beautiful in side and it has got a  
few stained  glass windows which are   
very colourful.The highest bit of the  
church is the alter. The church has    
got a steep roof with a small tower.   
The roof has recently been repaired.   
It all cost 27,000 pounds.Outside      
there is a grave yard which is still   
being used.
