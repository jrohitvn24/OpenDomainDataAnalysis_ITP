		<title>02LANDSCAPE NEAR RIVER COLNE</title>
		<content> The land is low_lying,but gently      
 undulates down to the marshes on the  
 edge of the river{Colne}and the       
{Pyefleet Channel. Pyefleet Channel}is 
 a wide creek which dries out          
 completely at low water. On the other 
 side of{Pyefleet Channel}is part ofthe
 sea wall and marshes on {Mersea       
{Island.}The sea wall is a wall made of
 concrete but it has grass on it to    
 keep the earth from washing away.It   
 keeps the sea from flooding the land. 
 The sea wall broke in 1952 but it has 
 not broken since. The saltings get    
 covered up every tide and then dry    
 out.There is marsh on the side of the 
 seawall and there is some rough grass 
 on which cattle graze.  All the land  
 is drained and the water that has been
 drained off goes into a dyke. There   
 are many adders living on the sea wall
