		<title>14THE MIRACULOUS BEAM.</title>
		<content>{    The legend of Christchurch Priory.
     The year was 1095 and workmen were
 building a new Priory,so that defences
 could be stiffened.For such people as 
 priests (who chanted services for     
 hours at a time) transepts were built.
 It was at this finishing stage,that a 
 tired carpenter,accidently cut a beam 
 too short.After it had been reported  
 to the chief,who was none too pleased,
 it was decided to finish for the night
 and begin again the next day.The      
 following morning,the workmen arrived 
 as usual and were mystified to see    
 that the beam which had been cut too  
 short the night before,had vanished.  
 The carpenters rushed to where the    
 beam should have originally gone,and  
 they were astonished to find it,in its
 place and too long.Many people        
 believed that it was the work of God, 
 but we will never know for certain.   </content>
