		<title>04FISHBURN COKE WORKS</title>
		<content> The coke works at Fishburn just       
 feature partly in the area of the     
 survey. Often you can see clouds of   
 black or grey smoke billowing from it.
 The smell is awful.                   
 Most of the land which has been used  
 for dumping from the mine is now being
 cleared and the site is being         
 developed into grassland and woodland.
                                       
 Last year 1984 it seemed as though the
 coke works would be closed down with a
 loss of jobs in the area but the      
 National Coal Board reconsidered this 
 decision.                             
                                       
 Not many of the inhabitants of Bishop 
 Middleham work at the coke works.
