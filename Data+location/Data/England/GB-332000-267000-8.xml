		<title>08FARMING HOMELIFE AT WILLEY</title>
		<content> Willey Lodge is a picturesque 15C     
 house in an idyllic setting of 162    
 acres. The house has been modified    
 over the centuries, the present house 
 incorporating one time outbuildings,  
 stock quarters and cheese room.       
 Cattle are Hereford bull, Freesian    
 cows. Sheep are North Country with a  
 Suffolk ram for fat sheep rearing. The
 present farmer aims to be self        
 sufficient but needs to rent extra    
 summer grazing. Stock has been doubled
 over the family's 16 years ownership  
 through employment of intensive farm  
 methods. Husband and wife are of      
 farming stock but not from Willey     
 area. The children have interests in  
 sports, music, scouts, church, &amp; Young
 Farmers which require chauffeuring    
 them to Ludlow. The parents belong to 
 the church,W.I and attend evening     
 classes.                              </content>
