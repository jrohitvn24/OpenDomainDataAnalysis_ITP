		<title>03ST. MARY'S CHURCH CLITHEROE</title>
		<content>    St. Mary Magdalene's Church has    
 existed since 1128 A.D. The present   
 building was built in 1828 but was    
 restored after a fire in 1981.        
    The bell tower of the church is at 
 the west end. It has five floors and a
 spire. The bell tower has a ringing   
 chamber and a bell chamber. There are 
 eight bells which play a scale. Bell  
 ringing is difficult and can also be  
 dangerous so you have to be taught.   
    When bells are rung there are      
 different ways of ringing. There are  
 rounds, peals and method ringing.     
    The main church is a cross shape.  
 The side chapel has a tomb for the    
 alter. The East window is made of     
 shields of local people or churches.  
     In the graveyard are the old      
 graves dating from the 1700's, the    
 oldest belonging to Thomas Law.
