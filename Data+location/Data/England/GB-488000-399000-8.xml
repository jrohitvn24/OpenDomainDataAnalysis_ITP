		<content> Public roads connect very adequately  
 with the{N,S}and{E}but the{R.Trent}   
 soon blocks direct traffic to the{W.} 
 Road widths and surfaces are generally
 adequate but care is needed when      
 meeting large lorries,double deck     
 buses and agricultural machinery.Apart
 from the{A159}crossing the{North West}
 corner of the block all roads are     
 secondary.These are the results of a  
 traffic count carried out by children 
 from{Scotter School}.The survey was   
 taken where{High Street}joins the     
 A159.In{30 mins.}165 vehicles were    
 counted on the A159.Of these 115 were 
 cars,47 were lorries or vans and 2    
 were motor cycles.Only 1 tractor was  
 seen and no buses.In the same time 71 
 vehicles were counted on High Street. 
 These were 51 cars,10 lorries and vans
 6 motor cycles,2 buses and 2 tractors.
 Survey time 2 pm to 2.30 pm.          </content>
