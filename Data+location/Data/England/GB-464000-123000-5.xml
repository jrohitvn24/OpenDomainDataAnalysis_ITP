		<title>05CHANGES IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   As emploment in domestic service and
 the farming industry has shrunk, and  
 lacking light industries, the         
 population of the village has shrunk  
 and now stands at about 850, about    
 three quarters of what it was at the  
 beginning of the century. Residents   
 now in their sixties recall a time    
 when there were 5 food shops including
 the present butcher shop and the      
 remaining grocer cum newsagent. The   
 hardware shop and Post Office still   
 exist. Lost are the cobbler, tailor,  
 blacksmith, hairdresser and the sweet 
 shop.                                 
   The grocer shop is thought to be    
 used by most of the village population
 at least once a week and the Post     
 Office by virtually 100%. Both retain 
 the feel of being an important meeting
 place for an exchange of village news 
 and views.                            </content>
