		<title>18ATTITUDES AND SOCIAL CONCERN</title>
		<content>      Many people feel that the area   
is poorly served in many respects when 
compared with nearby towns.            
     The inadequacy of medical         
facilities causes much concern among   
the population in general for often a  
long journey is necessary to receive   
treatment.                             
     The facilities for the community  
are constantly criticized in particular
the absence of a social services       
centre  in an unemployment blackspot   
and in an area with a high divorce     
rate. Young people feel aggrieved at   
the expense of facilities and many     
travel to other towns for              
entertainment.The poor range of        
shops nearby also causes concern as    
this increases the cost of living and  
limits the choice of goods available.  
Most people do like the proximity to   
rural life.                            </content>
