		<content>        {The Unfortunate Bride.        
   Outside{Butleigh Wootton}there is a 
 place called{Butleigh Court.}The      
 family who lived there had a daughter 
 who was to be married.The wedding was 
 held at{Butleigh Court.}At the end of 
 the wedding the bride said she would  
 like to play hide and seek,so she went
 up in to the attic where she found a  
 tin trunk. She got inside and closed  
 down the lid. Then she realised that  
 it would not close and she could not  
 get out.The groom found all the guests
 but not the bride.In fact no-one      
 ever found her until{Butleigh Court   
 was being changed into flats.Two      
 workmen went up to the attic and found
 the tin trunk.The men opened it and   
 found in side a{skeleton}wearing a    
 wedding dress.
