At Brigade we do all sorts of things.  
We play instruments like the Cornet,   
Bell-Lyre,Cymbals,Base Drum,Tenor Drum 
and Side Drum. We go to Brigade every  
friday night at 7.00p.m. until 9.00p.m.
We go to church once every month in    
Layham.                                
On May 11th. we went to Stafford for a 
competition. We have only been formed  
for about a year and we won three cups.
One for the best band, one for runner- 
up drummers and runner-up uniform.     
We are having a jumble sale on the 6th.
