		<title>01 CHANGES IN SHIPPON</title>
		<content>     Shippon has not really changed    
since 1975 but has changed alot since  
1905.In this time the TRANSPORT has    
changed from horse and cart to         
modern cars.                           
     The R.A.F.is another recent change
to Shippon .It has brought jobs and new
houses.As well as houses coming to     
Shippon houses have gone as well from  
the surrounding fields.                
      The oldest building is the       
church.BARROW ROAD,which passes through
the village,used to have a spring on   
it.People came to dab the water on     
their eyes to heal them.               
      One house in the village was     
built by a former PRINCE OF WALES after
a ten year legal battle with the local 
farmer who owned the land.
