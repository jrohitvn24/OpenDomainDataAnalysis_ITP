		<title>14Wormleighton the canal</title>
		<content> The South Oxford Canal makes two short
 appearances in the area, at the       
 beginning and at the end of the       
 tortuous length which encircles       
 Wormleighton hill. There are no wharfs
 at Wormleighton. In the early         
 nineteenth century the canal was used 
 for transporting coal, limestone,     
 lime, manure and also some passenger  
 boats were operating. Now all the     
 working boats are gone on this canal  
 and it is used purely by pleasure     
 craft with the occasional hotel boat  
 and converted butty. From the canal   
 can be seen the outline of a deserted 
 village which is still used as a      
 lecturing point by lecturers from     
 Birmingham University.
