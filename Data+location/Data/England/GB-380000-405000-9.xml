		<title>09TRANSPORT: MOTORWAYS.</title>
		<content> The area is well provided for by      
 motorways having the M62 crossing the 
 southern edge of the area from east to
 west and the M66 running north south  
 along the eastern side of the area.   
 The M66 runs from Darton near         
 Middleton to Ramsbottom at the moment.
 It is hoped that by 1988 it will be   
 fully build. By 1988 it will form a   
 ring road around Manchester, which    
 would be more efficient for drivers   
 driving in and out of Manchester. The 
 motorway was opened in 1976 at the    
 moment it stretches for 10 miles.
