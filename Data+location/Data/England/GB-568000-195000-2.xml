 Billericay is a delightful woodland   
 area called{NORSEY WOODS.}            
    Most of the people who live next to
 them don't mind unwanted visitors,like
 foxes and falling trees. Of the people
 we interviewed 32% had dogs,which they
 took walking in{NORSEY WOODS.}People  
 often{picnic}there using the tables   
 provided. The picnic area is right    
 next to the footpath and the carpark. 
    There is also an information centre
 with a{log book,}where you can put    
 your name and any comments. There is  
 also information about the most common
 trees, and the wildlife you will find.
    In{NORSEY WOODS}there is a{nature  
{trail}you can follow to ensure that   
 you see the most interesting flora and
 fauna. It is possible to arrange for  
 the warden to show you around.
