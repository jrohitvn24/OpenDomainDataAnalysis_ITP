		<title>20Attitudes in Brodsworth.</title>
		<content> All those of us taking part in the    
 Domesday Project have not only learned
 things about the area but have learned
 a lot about local people.The older    
 people remember the nice things in the
 past and the very hard times and are  
 pleased things are much better for    
 younger people.The{attitudes}they have
 to village life is one of sadness that
 the village spirit of{community}has   
 gone.Younger people and children look 
 towards town for lots of things and   
 often have friends there and so don't 
 look to the village for social        
 occasions.There is a lot of concern   
 for the lack of amenities in the area 
 and for the{unemployed}young people   
 wherever they are.All the children    
 from 7+ to 12+(20 children) have taken
 part in the Domesday Project.We are
