		<title>08     THE CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> The players of the Cricket Club play  
 most Saturdays in the summer at their 
 home ground on{Roadwater}recreation   
 field after the sheep have been chased
 out. Every Tuesday evening they cut   
 the grass and go over the pitch with a
 heavy roller that takes at least four 
 men to push it. The rolling is done in
 about an hour and afterwards they play
 a pratice match. The club has been    
 playing for over 60 years and a team  
 of 11 has always managed turn out at  
 half past two on Saturday afternoons  
 wearing whites. Although they have    
 only won the cup once the players     
 enjoy the game because there is never 
 any arguing. Some enjoy the tea, made 
 by their wives, in the{village hall}  
 even more than the game.              
 Each player provides his own kit and  
 pays Â£1 a match towards the cost of   
 the new ball and refreshments.        </content>
