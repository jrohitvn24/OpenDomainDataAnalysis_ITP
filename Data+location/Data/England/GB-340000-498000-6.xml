		<content> As a result of a fairly high rainfall 
 coupled with often thin and poor      
 soils, pastoral farming is virtually  
 the only form of land use. Most farms 
 in the area are designated as hill    
 farms and vary in size from typically 
 2-400 acres to as much as 780 acres in
 the north east on the upland edge. A  
 high proportion of the acreage is     
 'improved' pasture, and all the farms 
 have areas of 'meadow' based on the   
 better quality glacial soils. Whether 
 individual farms concentrate on sheep 
 (Herdwick, Rough Fell or cross-breds),
 beef cattle (mainly Angus) or dairy   
 cattle (usually Friesian) will depend 
 on local factors. All farms have some 
 sheep.
