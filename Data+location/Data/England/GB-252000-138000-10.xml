		<title>10MARWOOD N. "MY DAY"</title>
		<content>    I live on a 300 acre dairy and     
 sheep farm. We have 138 milking cows, 
 150 heifers, 300 breeding ewes and 2  
 horses at the moment.We only grow     
 about 20 acres of root crops for      
 fodder.                               
    I get up at 6.30am, get dressed and
 have a drink of milk and a bun with   
 butter on. Then I go to help milk the 
 cows. After that I get changed, have  
 another drink and walk to school.     
    I arrive at school early and have a
 game of football before lessons.      
    Every day we read, do English and  
 Maths. Sometimes we do Art, Singing,  
 Topic, and watching TV. I have my     
 dinner at school and go home at 3pm.  
     When I get home I get myself a    
 packet of crisps and a drink and then 
 play on the computer or watch TV until
 tea. After that I often do a Jigsaw   
 before a bath and bed at 8 o'clock.   </content>
