		<content>   When you are out of the village     
 there are two landmarks which stand   
 out. These are the two new pit head   
 winding towers, replacing the old ones
 which had been there for many years.  
  The Anglican Church of St. Wilfriths 
 is not the only church in the village,
 there are three more. These are the   
 Roman Catholic, The Spiritualist and  
 the Jehovas Witness'. All the churches
 are quite well attended and for a     
 small village, hardly anyone is left  
 out.                                  
   Not far from the pit there is a     
 recreation ground. It has a apark for 
 children, a cricket pitch, a golf     
 course, two bowling greens, a rugby   
 pitch, a grand stand and three        
 practise pitches.                     
   There are some allotments, for      
 people with green fingers, between the
 South of the village and the Moors.   </content>
