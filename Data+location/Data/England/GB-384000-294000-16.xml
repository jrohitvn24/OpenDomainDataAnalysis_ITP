		<content>    There is only one major industry   
other than farming. This is the        
quarrying of sand and gravel from three
sandpits. Two are off Ebstree Rd. in   
Seisdon and the third is off The Hollow
Way in Trysull.                        
    There is a water pumping station   
near Dimmingsdale Bridge which pumps up
3,000,000 gallons each day from a depth
of 1,000 feet.                         
    To the south of The Hollybush Inn  
there is a large electricity           
sub-station.                           
    Recently the road between Trysull  
and Seisdon has had an oil pipeline    
laid across it. It has come from       
Southampton.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
