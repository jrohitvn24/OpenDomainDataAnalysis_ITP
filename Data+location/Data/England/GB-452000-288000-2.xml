		<title>02OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our class is one of four classes in a 
 village school with 81 full-time      
 children and 7 part-time. There are 17
 children in our class aged 7-8yrs. Our
 class is the smallest class in the    
 school. We enjoy english, mathematics,
 art and craft, games and gymnastics,  
 swimming, music and topic work. Often 
 we can go for walks. There are a lot  
 of other activities we can do at      
 dinner-time and after school:         
 recorders, guitars, games clubs, choir
 and swimming. Some of our teachers are
 strict, they help us a lot. Our       
 classroom is colourful, with lots of  
 our work on the walls. We sit in small
 groups around square tables. We have  
 lots of books to look at, apparatus to
 help us with our mathematics and also 
 make displays to do with our topics.  
 We like our school very much.
