 There have been several quarries in { 
{Warmsworth}since pre-Georgian times.  
 Initially the limestone was used for  
 house building, then as a fertiliser  
 in the form of quicklime. The quarry  
 is situated on an area of{magnesian   
{limestone}called{dolomite. Dolomite}  
 contains a low percentage of iron and 
 is used in{glass making}as a catalyst 
 in the melting of silica. If the iron 
 content is too high the glass becomes 
 brown in colour.{Dolomite}produces    
 clear glass and is therefore in high  
 demand. The limestone is quarried     
 using explosives, and is then crushed,
 and reduced to powder. It is then sold
 to Pilkington's{glass makers}who then 
 transport the powder to their         
 factories on Merseyside.
