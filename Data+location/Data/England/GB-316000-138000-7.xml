		<title>07Nether Stowey:Local Farmer</title>
		<content> Fred Stockham, a local farming        
 'character',has lived in Stowey all   
 his life and speaks in the Somerset   
 dialect.He is well into his 70's but  
 very active. He attended the old      
 village school but admits that he     
 often played truant to go fox hunting.
 He used to make a living selling      
 timber. He then went into sheep       
 farming and for forty years has kept a
 large flock on the Quantock Hills,    
 where he has commoners' rights. He    
 keeps 250 breeding ewes and their     
 lambs. They are periodically brought  
 down for dipping, branding, or to be  
 sheared. It costs 50 pence to shear a 
 sheep today. The value of a fleece is 
 about Â£3.00. The problem of sheep     
 worrying has worsened with increased  
 accessibility of the hills to         
 townspeople owning cars. By law, Fred 
 may shoot dogs caught worrying sheep. </content>
