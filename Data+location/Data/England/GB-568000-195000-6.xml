		<title>06 FISHING CLUB</title>
		<content>  About two miles away from the village
 there is an{angling club.}At the club 
 you can use lots of types of bait but 
 you are forbiden to use ground bait.  
 The recomended ways to fish there are 
 by float, ledger and spinner.         
 The cost is{Â£18:30}for the whole      
 season for adults, and{Â£2:30}for the  
 whole season for juniors. Children    
 under sixteen must be accompanied by  
 a parent. The minimum age for members 
 is seven. On joining you recieve a    
{membership card}with the{rules of the 
{club.                                 
  We visited the{lake}and thought it   
 looked very big and quite weedy. There
 seemed to be a{great many fish}and the
 whole centre looked very good. If you 
 need more information you can contact 
 Kens Guns and Tackle in Billericay.
