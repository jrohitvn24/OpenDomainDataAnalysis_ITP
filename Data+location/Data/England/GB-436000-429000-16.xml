		<title>16WORK OF PARISH COUNCIL (1)</title>
		<content>    The Parish Council meets regularly.
 Its members are people interested in  
 village matters.They discuss all sorts
 of problems affecting the village and 
 help community groups by providing    
 money and equipment for projects.     
    Young people,working for the       
 'Community Programme' have erected new
 fencing throughout the village and    
 landscaped the area adgacent to the   
 church with stone setts,grass and     
 flower beds. Hundreds of bulbs have   
 been planted to provide a colourful   
 display in spring. In July a clean_up 
 campaign was organised to collect     
 litter and generally improve the      
 appearance of the village. This was   
 very succesful and may become an      
 annual event.
