		<title>16BIRDS IN BOWERCHALKE</title>
		<content> Birds range from Kingfisher at the    
 head of the Ebble to the Jay in the   
 wood &amp; Stonechat on the Downs. The    
 Tawny, Barn &amp; Little Owls can be heard
 or seen at dusk. Green Woodpeckers are
 often about; the Spotted one comes to 
 gardens for food in cold winters.     
 Blackbirds are common in gardens, with
 the Wren, Finches &amp; Tits: a Marsh     
 Tit is seen sometimes. On top of the  
 Downs, the Hen Harrier hunts.         
 Kestrels &amp; Sparrow Hawks get their    
 prey; Treecreepers, Blackcaps,        
 Nuthatch &amp; Yellow Hammers all have    
 their haunts. The Nightjar makes its  
 strange call late on a summer         
 evening. Magpies are increasing.      
 Their are many pheasants; partridge   
 now produce 4 or 5 young. Woodcock &amp;  
 Snipe are rarer. The Nightingale      
 sings in the woods in early summer.   
 Rooks proliferate also Crow &amp; Jackdaw.</content>
