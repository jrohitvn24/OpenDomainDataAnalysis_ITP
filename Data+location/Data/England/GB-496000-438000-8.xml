		<content> The Church runs a{Sunday School}of 20 
 children, a small{choir}of 8 people   
 and a bell-ringing rota.              
 The{Village Hall}(built in the 1950's 
 and funded by the village) holds two  
{youth clubs}organised for the 5 - 16  
 year olds. Football is played on the  
 village green. There was a Ladies Keep
 Fit class which has now been disbanded
 due to lack of enthusiasm.  But those 
 who are more energetic use the College
 sports facilities to play tennis,     
 badminton and squash.  The College    
 also has table tennis and snooker     
 facilities. There is a local cricket  
 team with its own cricket ground on   
 the village outskirts, but all the    
 members come from outside the village.
  The College has rugby and cricket    
 teams. The old age pensioners of the  
 village run a{Darby and Joan Club,}   
 helped by the Beverley Lions.         </content>
