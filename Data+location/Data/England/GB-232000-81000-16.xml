		<title>16A School teacher's Day</title>
		<content> I wake up each morning at about       
 6.50a.m. I lie in bed listening to    
 radio 4 for about thirty              
 minutes,before I get up to get the    
 morning coffee.After a shower and     
 breakfast I get in the car to drive   
 the mile to school.My role at school  
 is that of a Housemaster,as well as a 
 History and European Studies          
 teacher.In the House there are about  
 200 pupils,ranging in age from 13 to  
 18. These pupils are divided into 6   
 tutor groups.The majority of my time  
 is taken up in dealing with pupil's   
 problems and pastoral care. Although  
 the school day ends at 3.40p.m.,I     
 rarely leave school before            
 5.00p.m.When I get home I usually have
 an hour gardening,after which my wife 
 and I have dinner.In the evening I    
 spend about 2 or 3 hours doing school 
 work,and get to bed about 11.30 or 12.</content>
