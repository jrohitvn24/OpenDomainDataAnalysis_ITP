		<title>16WITCHES IN GREAT LEIGHS</title>
		<content> In St.Annes Castle there is a strange 
 room,because when everything is tidied
 up it mysteriously becomes messy.Some 
 people think it is a                  
 poltergeist,others say that Mother    
 Haven,a witch who haunts the pub.     
 She is supposedly looking for her     
 child who was murdered there.Some say 
 she was buried at Scrap Faggots Green 
 where a stone was rolled over her     
 grave to stop evil spirit escaping.   
 During World War II Americans moved   
 the stone to clear their path.        
 Unusual things happened;some comical, 
 some frightening.In a local farm      
 chickens and ducks swapped places     
 without signs of activity.The church  
 clock lost 1 hr every day and the     
 bells tolled by themselves in the     
 early hours of the morning.           
                                       
                                       </content>
