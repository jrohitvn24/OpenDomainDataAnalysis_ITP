{     A LOCAL STORY IN MARCH 1985}     
 Â£2M SUPERMARKET PLAN REJECTED IN OTLEY
 The complex was rejected because it   
 would create traffic problems and the 
 councillors heard that 759 local      
 people had signed a petition against  
 the complex. 250 car parking spaces   
 would have been provided with landsca-
 ping. So now the local people have    
 been left in peace from the traffic.
