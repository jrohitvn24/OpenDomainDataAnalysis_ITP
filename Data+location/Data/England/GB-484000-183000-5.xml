		<title>05HYDE AND TEMPLE FARMS.</title>
		<content>   Hyde and Temple Farms are both owned
 by Mr. Randall, and were originally   
 bought by his grandfather.            
   Hyde Farm is an arable farm, growing
 wheat to make flour, barley for animal
 feed, and oilseed rape for making     
 margarine. Oilseed rape is quite a new
 crop, and is bright yellow in colour. 
   Temple Farm is a dairy farm. Most of
 the land is used to grow hay for the  
 cows. The hay is turned into silage.  
 When it is cut, it is piled up and    
 covered with black plastic sheet. This
 pickles it, and it becomes very       
 smelly, but the cows seem to like it. 
 It is fed to them in the winter when  
 they have to live in huge cowsheds,   
 and cannot graze in the fields. The   
 cows are milked in a herringbone      
 milking parlour. They all have numbers
 not names, as there are so many of    
 them.                                 </content>
