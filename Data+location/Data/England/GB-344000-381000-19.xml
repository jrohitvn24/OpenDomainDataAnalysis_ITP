 John Middleton was born in 1578 to a  
 poor family and was of simple nature. 
 He is better known as the{Childe of   
{Hale.}                                
 Very little is known about his        
 childhood, but legends of his youth   
 are still the talk of the village. He 
 grew to the most outstanding height of
 nine foot three inches.               
 His white cottage still stands in the 
 village, with its high sloped thatched
 roof, white washed with two windows   
 high up in the gable, faces{Church    
{End.}                                 
 The wooden pegs upon which the{Childe 
{of Hale}is supposed to have hung his  
 hat and coat are still present in the 
 cottage about ten feet above the      
 floor.{                               
{The Childe of Hale}died in{1623}and is
 buried in the churchyard.             </content>
