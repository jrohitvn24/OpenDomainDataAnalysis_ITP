		<content>{ "THE GALA"}is the event of the year  
 both a a fund raiser for the school   
 and as a social.Months of preparation,
 meticulous planning and last minute   
 enthusiastic and feverish scrambling  
 combine to produce "The Gala".        
 Usually opened by a famous personality
 like{Ray Buckton}(an old pupil)the fun
 begins whilst the band plays.The      
 stalls sell books, plants,toys, cakes,
 sweets in fact anything saleable.There
 are sideshows,a roundabout,a pony ride
 swings,a fortune tellerand many more. 
 Then come the games or races,the      
 Tug-o-war and the Peat Sack Race.All  
 topped up with pop and ice-cream,and  
 strawberry teas,with MC Denis Hudson  
 urging all on to spend.At 4.15 comes  
 the "Draw" for assorted prizes with   
 cries of "It's a fix" mingling with   
 shouts of joy.It never seems to rain  
 on the first Saturday in July.        </content>
