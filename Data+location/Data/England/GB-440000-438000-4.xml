		<title>04O.S. Area 4243-4041</title>
		<content> This area is a mixture of farmland and
 woodland, with the A64 dual           
 carriageway trunk road running across 
 the South East section. The woodland  
 covers the North West section and     
 belongs to the Bramham Estate. The    
 trees are mainly pine, with some oak, 
 ash and beech. The farmland is used   
 mainly for crops, especially barley   
 and wheat, but there are some pasture 
 fields with cattle and sheep. The     
 farm, known as Windsor Farm, is       
 positioned just off the A64 in the    
 extreme South West of the section. The
 farmhouse is approximately 40 years   
 old and four people live there. The   
 A64 runs West to East and also has the
 beginnings of a slip road to the A1.
