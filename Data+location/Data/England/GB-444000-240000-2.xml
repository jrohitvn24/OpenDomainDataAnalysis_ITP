		<content>  There are a lot of primary schools in
Banbury for children from five to      
eleven years old. There is Dashwood,   
St.Mary's, St.John's, St.Leonard's,    
St.Joseph's, The Grange, Hillview,     
Harriers' Ground, William Morris,      
Neithrop, Queensway and Hardwick.      
  Older children go to secondary       
school. The one we will go to is       
called Banbury School. It has three    
halls - Wykham,   Stanbridge and       
Broughton. There is another secondary  
school called Drayton and one called   
Blessed George Napier. Some teenagers  
go to the technical college when they  
are about sixteen.                     
  There are also some nursery schools  
and playgroups for little children     
before they start going to a proper    
school. People pay to send children to 
these.
