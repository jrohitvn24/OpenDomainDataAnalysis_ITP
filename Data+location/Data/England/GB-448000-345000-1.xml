 The 'D' Block is in the County of {   
{Nottinghamshire}and is 11 kilometres  
 to the north west of the county town  
 of Nottingham.Just outside the block  
 is the town of Eastwood which is near 
 to the county boundary with           
 Derbyshire.It is probably best known  
 as the birthplace of the {author}and  
 playwright{D.H.Lawrence.}Most of the  
 block is in the parish of Greasley as 
 are the villages of Giltbrook,Watnall 
 Beauvale,Newthorpe and Moorgreen.The  
 edges of two towns, Kimberley and     
 Hucknall are to the south and west of 
 the block.Present day Giltbrook has   
 seen many changes in recent years.An  
 industrial estate has been built on   
 what was formerly agricultural land   
 and new {housing}has sprung up all    
 over the place.                       </content>
