		<title>05The Maldon Bypass</title>
		<content>    One of the major{social concerns}of
 the Maldon and Heybridge area         
 currently occupying the minds of the  
 local residents is the proposed plan  
 for a ring road around Maldon. There  
 is little doubt that such a bypass    
 scheme is badly needed. The High      
 Street, which is narrow and winding,  
 and{Market Hill,}of which there is a  
 slide, are now a permanent bottle-neck
 and there is some worry about the     
 effect of the continual traffic on the
 fine examples of Georgian houses      
 situated here.                        
    There are two main proposals :-    
 1) For the Maldon ring road to also   
 bypass Heybridge and                  
 2) For the ring road to run through   
 Heybridge.                            
    At present the village of Heybridge
 is split and there is some acrimony   
  between the residents.               </content>
