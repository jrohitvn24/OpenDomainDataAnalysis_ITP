		<title>01 A TRIP AROUND THE BLOCK</title>
		<content>The North Eastern corner of our block  
is dominated by the Trent Valley. The  
land is flat there and used mostly for 
farming. This changes to wooded hills  
and glacial valleys of Cannock Chase to
the South.                             
The main residential areas are Rugeley 
and the villages of Brereton, Armitage,
Hill Ridware and Mavesyn Ridware.      
There is a major road, A51 running     
roughly North to South. The London to  
North West railway and the Trent and   
Mersey canal also cut through the      
block.                                 
Two power stations dominate the        
scene.These with Lea Hall Colliery,    
Thorn Automation and Amitage Shanks,   
all to be found off the A513,          
constitute the main industries in the  
area.There is an industrial estate off 
the A51 in Brereton.The main amenities 
are within the residential areas.      </content>
