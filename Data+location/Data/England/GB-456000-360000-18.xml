		<title>18LEISURE TIME</title>
		<content> Leisure time is very important, I     
 enjoy playing pool, snooker, football,
 bike riding and running. Rounders is a
 good game as well, you need a bat, a  
 ball and some posts. I enjoy watching 
 television and watching birds. I like 
 watching television because it is     
 entertaining. I like Benny Hill best  
 as a commedian because he is a fat    
 little chubby man. I like drawing     
 cartoon characters. At first I wasn't 
 very good at drawing but I have got   
 better and better in my fourth year.  
 The 800 metres run is a hard race, it 
 is very tiring, the first time I ran I
 thought I was going to snap my legs   
 off. Football is my best sport because
 it is the longest game I've ever had  
 and I've always liked football, I have
 been playing football since I was six 
 now I am eleven years of age.
