		<title>11RACING STABLES II.</title>
		<content>    The 14 stable-lads,under the eye of
 the Head Lad,care for 3-4 horses each.
 "Mucking out" is 7.00/7.45 each day.  
 Then they feed the horses on{WHEAT}and
{"'NUTS"}and groom them thoroughly.    
    The horses exercise in the 'yard,on
 the roads or on the Gallops.Not every 
 horse is taken out and only those that
 do get an extra feed when they return.
 The 'lads return from lunch at 3.30 to
 "muck out" and feed the horses once   
 more.All the tack is cleaned weekly.  
    Winter training is hampered by icy 
 roads and frozen ground.The soiled    
 bedding,instead of going to a mushroom
 farm,is spread in a circle in the yard
 so they can,at least,do light work.   
    These horses race at{YORK}and{EPSOM
 for example.The owner,advised by the  
 trainer,chooses a jockey who,if he    
 wins, will get 10% of the "purse" plus
 his Â£35 riding fee.                   </content>
