		<content>There was a hypothesis"to prove that   
this stretch of coastline consisted    
mainly of long unspoilt sandy beaches" 
The coastline was divided into ten 300 
metre long strips,each group had one   
strip.We were given a map,ten coastline
sheets,2 metre rules and one 30        
centimetre ruler.The coastline sheets  
were sheets on which we put what the   
1 metre square was composed of eg sand 
etc.and how good it was.               
METHOD:We measured a metre square and  
recorded the amount of sand etc there  
was in it,and how much surface deposit 
there was.We did this in metre squares 
all over our area,doing near the sea   
first because of the tide.             
Was the hypothesis true?               
On the whole,no!There were some        
stretches of sandy beaches but not     
enough to say"mainly".All the          
shops,car-parks etc were by these sandy</content>
