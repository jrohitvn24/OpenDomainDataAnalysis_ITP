		<content>  Touristic interest in Wybunbury has  
 recently been awakened due to the     
 project to rescue the original Church 
 tower, all that is left of the        
 original Church, and which is         
 gradually subsiding and thus leans at 
 an angle.                             
                                       
  This interest is partly due to a     
 feature on local television and quite 
 an extensive publicity campaign by the
 group which wants to preserve the     
 tower.Tourism is still of very minor  
 importance, though and certainly no   
 special provision has been made for   
 tourists, nor are there any special   
 amenities.In fact the village is      
 scarcely aware of its tourist status, 
 so small is the tourist trade.
