		<title>16Wroxton Village</title>
		<content>Although the village is small and has  
few children, it still retains its     
school. There is some council housing  
but the majority is private. A good    
number of cottages have undergone      
restoration and been turned from two   
into one. The village has become a     
place where those in management jobs   
in local commerce and industry have    
settled. There are some village        
activities but children often go to    
nearby Banbury for swimming, ballet    
etc. The village attracts visitors to  
the Abbey which is now part of an      
American University and to its hotel   
and public houses. The Wroxton Hotel   
has a fine reputation for the meals it 
serves. In the centre of the village   
away from the main Banbury to          
Stratford-upon-Avon road lies the      
village pond which is well stocked     
with fish and ducks.                   </content>
