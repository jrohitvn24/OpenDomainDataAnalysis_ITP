		<title>02SHAW - PAST AND PRESENT</title>
		<content> In Shaw there were lots of fields and 
 not many houses.Now there are more    
 houses and fewer fields.More people   
 live in Shaw.More people used to work 
 in Shaw because there were many mills 
 but now most of them have been        
 demolished so more people work out of 
 Shaw.                                 
                                       
 Shaw had a town hall but it was       
 demolished in 1981.Shaw clock was     
 burned down and a snooker club was    
 built in its place.Shaw used to have a
 lot of fog due to all the             
 industry.There used to be a police    
 station open all hours but that has   
 been knocked down and the new one is  
 open just during the day.The bus      
 service used to stop in Shaw centre   
 but now it goes all round Shaw.
