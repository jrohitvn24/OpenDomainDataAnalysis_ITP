		<content>***************************            
Woodham Village is located to the west 
of a farming community called Woodham  
that had its origins in pre-Norman     
times. Woodham Village relates alot to 
historic past and its srong equestrian 
associations.                          
  Meticulous planning has gone into    
ensuring that the completed development
of Woodham Village will provide        
community facilities to a high         
standard. Development on the site began
in 1982 and when completed there will  
be about 1000 houses and a population  
of 3000 by the end of the 1980's.      
  There is a wide range of housing in  
Woodham Village. Depending on whether  
you live on a Heritage, Mcleans or     
Brosley site the style of homes will   
change and so will the prices. On a    
Heritage, price ranges from 12750-56500
pounds. A Mcleans, 19350-40450 pounds. </content>
