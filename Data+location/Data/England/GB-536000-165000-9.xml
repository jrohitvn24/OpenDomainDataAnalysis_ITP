		<content>   Most of the houses in the area are  
semi-detached but there are some flats,
terraced and detached houses as well.  
At the end of Mounthurst Rd. there are 
old people's flats. There's an old     
house down by Pickhurst Pond. The house
is about two hundred years old. Most of
the house is timber and bricks.ost of  
the buildings around Pickhurst are post
war but some are pre-war. Pickhurst    
Tavern overlooks Pickhurst Green. There
is a bungalow built in the 1940's. In  
Sedgewood Close are two detached houses
and about eight semi-detached houses.  
They are quite small and could fit four
or five people in them. They were built
about 1979.
