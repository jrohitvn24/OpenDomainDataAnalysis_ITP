		<content>  This block is part of an inland      
 plateau around 150m above sea level   
 but cut by two main river systems.    
{1.}The Lamberal Water- A shallow      
 marshy valley to the east and {2.}The 
 river Stratt-A deep wooded valley to  
 the west of the block.None of the main
 village lies in this block with the   
 exception of the Old Rectory now      
 partly holiday accomodation,the       
 Cornish Iron Foundry, also tourist    
 orientated and the Lodge and grounds  
 of Penstowe Manor excluding the manor 
 itself.The remaining habitations are  
 outlying farms.The main A39 trunk road
 passing through Bude and Bideford     
 crosses the N.W. corner of the block. 
 The B3254 runs through the centre of  
 the block and is a busy second class  
 road carrying a lot of local traffic  
 to Holsworthy and Launceston
