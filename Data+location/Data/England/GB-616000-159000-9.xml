		<content> The shopping facilities in Sturry seem
to be adequate for the local           
inhabitants, with one exception no     
bank.There are 2 Private Junior        
Schools, one actually in the village   
itself. Milner Court (which belongs to 
the Kings School)was given by Lord     
Milner's widow to the village. One     
Primary-Infant school along the        
Island Road estate and a Secondary     
School on the outskirts of Westbere.   
The Infant School on Sturry Hill is    
going to be demolished and meanwhile   
the children have been transfered to   
the Primary School.                    
 There are 3 old people's homes, the   
biggest, Franklin House, in the village
itself.                                
 Sturry has a 13th century church      
situated inside the Tudor Gateway of   
Sturry.
