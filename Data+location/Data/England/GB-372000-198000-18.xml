{My Brother's Christening.}            
 Last Sunday I helped Mum make some    
 sandwiches for my brother's           
 Christening. In Church the Vicar read 
 from the Order of Service. When my    
 brother was going to have the water   
 sprinkled on his head the Vicar lifted
 his head so that the water went back  
 into the font and we all laughed. Then
 we went home and had lots of things to
 eat. The guest who came were five     
 friends, four aunties, four cousing   
 and my Nan and Gramp.                 
{                                      
{Transport}- By the year 2085 cars     
 will be running on electricity rather 
 than petrol so that engines will be   
 quieter. Roads will be wider with dual
 carriageways. More hover type vehicles
 will be in use, skimming above the    
 surface of roads.                     </content>
