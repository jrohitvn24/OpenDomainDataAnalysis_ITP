		<content>{   Edwin Hall Farm}is the least       
 modernised of all the farms our class 
 visited.                              
    Geese are kept close to the milking
 parlour and as we approached they were
 very protective  towards their fluffy 
 goslings. They kept hissing at us.    
    We saw some cows which had very    
 sore feet due to the wet and muddy    
 conditions this year. In the barn were
 several small calves which we were    
 able to stroke. They were born out of 
 season. Most calves are born between  
 September and January.                
    Mr Turner, the farmer, keeps two   
 large bulls. One weighs over 18 cwt.  
  We watched some of the 108 Friesians 
 being milked. They had only 4 milking 
 machines, so it was a long job.       
    Finally the farmer's wife gave us a
 drink and a Kit-Kat, which we enjoyed 
 while playing with their sheep-dog.   </content>
