 The school was built in{1912}and was  
 called a{Council School.}The children 
 came to school from the age of five up
 to the age of fourteen. The first     
 headmaster of the school was a man    
 called{Mr. Pegg}and the school was    
 made from corrugated material.        
   Later on the school was added onto  
 and a new wing was established.  Today
 the school has five Junior classes and
 four Infant classes.  The school also 
 has a Nursery department.             
  The present headteacher of the school
 is{Mr.T.E.Bowen}who has been the      
 headmaster for the past 13 years.     
 During the last four years the school 
 has been modernised considerably with 
 sink units and fitted cupboards being 
 placed in every classroom.
