		<content> At Braceby there is a flock of{600    
{breeding mule ewes}bought annually    
 from Yorkshire. They are kept on      
 permanent grass during summer but are 
 kept indoors from November to April.  
 In January they are sheared, each     
 fleece weighing 4lb(2kg). This is     
 collected by a local merchant, graded 
 then sent to British Wool Marketing   
 Board.  The ewes are served by ten    
 Suffolk rams in October to lamb in    
 March when they have l.8 lambs per ewe
 These are weaned after l2 weeks,      
 fattened and sold from July to October
 either at Grantham or Stamford Market 
 or to a local butcher.  The Sapperton 
 flock of{400 half breed ewes(Border   
{Leicester/Suffolk)}are looked after by
 a free lance shepherd who is          
 responsible for taking them on to     
 neighbouring farmers' sugar beet tops 
 for the winter.                       </content>
