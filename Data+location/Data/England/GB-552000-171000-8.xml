		<title>08RECREATION - DARTFORD PARKS</title>
		<content> Central park is very big and it has   
 two playgrounds.One of them is quite  
 old and has a lot of swings in it. The
 newer playground is a lot bigger and  
 better. It has two lots of swings a   
 helter-skelter, and a bus which is a  
 climbing frame with a slide. Nearby,  
 where there used to be some trees,    
 just the trunks remain for children to
 climb on. I think the best thing is   
 the big climbing frame with slides,   
 bridges, ropes and a house on the end 
 of it.                                
 There are a lot of flowers in laid out
 gardens in central park,making it very
 attractive, and generally the park is 
 kept tidy.                            
 Heskith Park is a lot smaller and the 
 playground in it is similar to the one
 in Central Park. There are four grass 
 tennis courts,and two tarmac. In the  
 park is a Kent County Cricket ground. </content>
