		<content>    The Rev.Maurice Johnson came to    
 Springfield Methodist Church, Lydney, 
 in 1979; his first ministry.An initial
 day visit, he said, was bewildering as
 he was taken in quick succession to   
 all six churches he would be covering.
    His first impression on moving in  
 was the great welcome he received,    
 with help for the move, digging his   
 garden and provision of a welcoming   
 meal. He found the local people easy  
 to get to know and independent though 
 the dialect gave him a few problems.  
    He has particularly enjoyed the    
 local countryside especially visits to
 the Wye Valley and picnicking at a    
 local beauty spot, Mallard's Pike.    
    In 1986 he will be moving on to a  
 new ministry with mixed feelings. He  
 has been very happy here and will miss
 the many friendships he has made as   
 well as the area's great beauty.      </content>
