		<title>01Montacute and Odcombe area</title>
		<content> Our D block is dominated by the       
 village of Odcombe, divided into      
 Higher and Lower.{About 60%}of the    
 population are{retired.}Part of       
 Montacute village is included. Many   
{buildings}are of{Ham stone,}a hard,   
 locally quarried rock. The area is    
 mainly{elevated pastoral}and          
 agricultural land crossed by narrow,  
 often sunken lanes. Shopping in both  
 villages is limited, with one small   
 shop cum post office in Odcombe,      
 though more in Montacute where many   
 tourists come to visit the Elizabethan
 house.The majority of the population  
 are employed outside the block. Most  
 traffic is passing through to Yeovil, 
 Ham Hill, Montacute, Stoke or West    
 Coker. Although quietly rural, the air
 ia often noisy with helicopters from  
 Westlands or jets from Rnas Yeovilton.
