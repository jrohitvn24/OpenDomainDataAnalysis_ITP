		<title>20SNAITH COMMUNITY LIFE .3.</title>
		<content> The only organised social events are  
 those originated by the Parent's      
 Associations of the two schools. The  
 Comprehensive swells its funds by     
 playing Whist and the Primary by      
 consuming Home Brew.                  
 SENIOR CITIZENS                       
 Many of the town's Senior Citizens    
 live on a 'sheltered' estate next to  
 the Primary School and the Play Area. 
 There is a day centre operated by the 
 residents themselves with the help of 
 a warden.                             
                                       
 It would seem that the residents like 
 Snaith the way it is. There is no     
 difficulty in selling property, and   
 more significantly in 1985 no serious 
 vandalism.
