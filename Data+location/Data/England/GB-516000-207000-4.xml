		<content>{Jersey Lane}is a very old bridleway.  
 It once went past Evans Farm and then 
 on to House Lane near Sandridge.In the
 19th century Evans Farm changed its   
 name to Jersey Farm. Over the years   
 houses have been built next to Jersey 
 Lane and so now it runs through a     
 built up area.                        
 From Marshalswick Lane it runs east,  
 crossing Barnfield Rd. and Ardens     
 Way.About 70 metres east of Ardens Way
 it turns north and continues until it 
 joins House Lane.{                    
 The woody plants in the hedgerows are 
 hawthorn, beech, oak, elder,holly,ash,
 sycamore and horsechestnut. We found 6
 of these in a 30 metre stretch. This  
 means that the hedge is approx.500yrs.
 old. In front of the hedge we found   
 violets, ivy, cow parsley, nettles,   
 fern bracken,forget-me-nots,foxgloves,
 dock,cow parsley and lesser celendine.</content>
