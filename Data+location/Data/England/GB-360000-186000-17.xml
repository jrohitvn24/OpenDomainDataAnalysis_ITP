		<title>17Mr. Davies at the Quarry.</title>
		<content> Mr. Davies is the Manager of the      
 Harnhill Quarry in Olveston. The      
 Quarrying first started there in 189O.
 The spot was chosen because of the    
 quality and quantity of limestone     
 available. They knew this information 
 by taking core samples. There is one  
 problem, they have to constantly pump 
 water out of the quarry. The most     
 expensive piece of equipment is a face
 shovel. They also have 2 large trucks 
 plus other quarrying machinery. These 
 use on average 35OO gallons of diesel 
 fuel per week. The quarry is 16Oft    
 deep and about 5OOft around its       
 perimeter. Most of the limestone      
 quarried here is delivered within a   
 radius of 5 miles. It is used for     
 roads, cement and tarmac. Local       
 farmers also use a great deal of      
 limestone from the quarry.
