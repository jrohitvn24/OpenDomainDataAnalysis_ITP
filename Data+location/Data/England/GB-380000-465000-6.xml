		<title>06RECREATION IN STAINFORTH (2)</title>
		<content> The major event in Stainforth is the  
 annual Gala with which people of all  
 ages can lend a hand and in return    
 have a lot of fun. The Gala Queen is  
 chosen from the teenage girls of the  
 area, and there are always pictures   
 and an account of the Gala in the     
 local paper, the 'Craven Herald'.     
 Langcliffe, Stainforth's neighbouring 
 village also has an annual gala.      
 Here, too, there are very few clubs or
 other activities, so many people      
 travel to Settle for things such as   
 Cubs, Guides and youth clubs. Settle  
 also offers educational activities    
 such as evening classes, ranging from 
 computer appreciation to cheese       
 making.
