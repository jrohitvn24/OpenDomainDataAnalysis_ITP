		<title>08Darlington's "Mr. Tidy"</title>
		<content>        {     Mr Steve Wilson}is the   
{Enviromental Care Officer}employed by 
 Darlington Borough Council.  He says  
 he originally wanted to be a          
 horticulturist and was once a self-   
 employed gardener but in Winter time  
 people tended to go indoors and forget
 all about their gardens, so there was 
 not enough work to keep him busy.     
                                       
       As Enviromental Care Oficer Mr  
 Wilson gives talks to children in     
 Darlington schools.  At the end of    
 these talks he sometimes hands out in-
 centives, such as posters and         
 T-shirts, to encourage the pupils to  
 keep Britain tidy.  Mr Wilson invented
 a character called{Brian 'Tidy' Tucky,
 or BT for short, which is part of the 
{Keep Britain Tidy Scheme.
