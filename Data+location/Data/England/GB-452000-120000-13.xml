		<title>13A DAY IN A FARMER'S LIFE</title>
		<content>             MORNING                   
    As I am seventy years old now, my  
 day is nowhere near as busy as it used
 to be when I was younger, but it still
 begins at 6 a.m. when I get up, let my
 two dogs out and make a cup of tea for
 myself and my wife. I also give the   
 dogs some milk. I then have a bath    
 before breakfasting at 7.30 a.m. with 
 my assistant who arrives to discuss   
 the farm and plan the day's work.     
 He then goes out to meet the other men
 who help to run the farm. At 8 o'clock
 work begins. The stablehand tacks up  
 the horses and I ride round the farm, 
 the local tracks and the land for     
 about one and a half hours. When I get
 back we have a cup of coffee and then 
 I help with the young horses we are   
 breaking in. Sometimes I go to market 
 if we are buying or selling cattle.   
 I have a cold lunch at about noon.    </content>
