 Nearly every home has a television set
 and many hours of television are      
 watched each week.  Between 4 o'clock 
 and 6 o'clock the emphasis is on      
 childrens' programmes.  Two current   
 favourites are Wildtrack, a nature    
 programme, and Cartoon Time.          
 Obviously children do not only watch  
 at that time of day.  In a survey of  
 our Top Class the majority of         
 programmes mentioned were screened    
 after 8 o'clock at night.  The class's
 favourite programme is called Magnum  
 which is about an American Private    
 Investigator and the second favourite 
 was Dallas, a soap opera revolving    
 around the fortunes and misfortunes of
 a Texan oil family.
