		<content> BAYNARD'S COUNTY PRIMARY SCHOOL       
 In the 1970's another primary school  
 was needed and Baynard's County       
 Primary School opened its doors to 73 
 pupils in 1976.There were three       
 teachers,a headmistress,a secretary   
 and a welfare assistant.              
 It was a fairly new concept in        
 education being "open plan"and the    
 first in the area.Instead of          
 classrooms there are carpeted teaching
 areas which are defined by movable    
 partitions.For messy work there are   
 wet areas with tiled floors and sinks.
   A Nursery unit was built as part of 
 the school and equipped but no money  
 was made available by the local       
 education authority to employ a       
 Nursery teacher.However the building  
 is put to good use by the school and a
 pre_school playgroup.
