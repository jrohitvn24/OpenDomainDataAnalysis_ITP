		<title>01Summary Of The Denmead Area.</title>
		<content>  Our area is a combination of rural   
 and urban landscapes. We have studied 
 an area that is mostly agricultural   
 land with a primary village, Denmead. 
 This village is expanding with new    
 housing developments. Our area also   
 includes a suburb, called Wecock, of a
 large town called Waterlooville.      
  About 65% of our area is farming     
 land. Both arable and livestock       
 farming can be found but the emphasis 
 is on arable farming.                 
  Denmead is a large dormitory village 
 that has grown from a small isolated  
 village in the Hampshire countryside. 
 Most of the village is new housing    
 catering for the professional         
 workforce of the nearby towns and     
 cities.                               
  Wecock is a new suburb built because 
 of the growth of south-east Hampshire.
 It has grown since the 1960's.        </content>
