		<title>07Roger Bickley's Talk</title>
		<content>                                       
 Roger Bickley is a water bailiff. He  
 works for the South West Water        
 Authority. Mr Bickley visits          
 reservoiurs, lakes and rivers.His work
 includes a variety of unusual tasks,  
 the most exciting being that of a     
 "water policeman".                    
   There are many valuble salmon and   
 sea trout swim in the estury on their 
 way up and down the rivers{Taw}and{   
{Torridge.}Only 17 men are licensed to 
 fish the estury using small rowing    
 boats and seine nets. These men have  
 to fish only at certain times and they
 can only operate with an approved net.
 Unfortunatly, salmon poachers plunder 
 the quiet, remote parts of the rivers 
 because salmon is so valuable.        
  Mr Bickley brought a frozen salmon to
 show us. It had been used as evidence 
 in court to convict some poachers.    </content>
