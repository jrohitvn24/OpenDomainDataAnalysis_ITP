 Overlooking Pegwell bay is "Hugin",a  
 perfect replica of a viking boat,built
 in Denmark and rowed to Thanet in     
 1949,to mark the 1,500th anniversary  
 of the landing of Hengist and Horsa.  
 It was bought by the "Daily Mail",and 
 presented by Lord Rothermere to the   
 people of Thanet as a permanent       
 memorial. It stands near the Sandwich 
 road,just opposite the Viking Ship    
 Hotel.

{Cross which commemorates the landing  
{of St.Augustine 449 A.D. at Ebbsfleet.
{After many dangers from sea and land  
{he landed at Richborough shore,Thanet.

{on the foot of the stone cross which  
{was errected by the Earl of Granville,
{the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. }
