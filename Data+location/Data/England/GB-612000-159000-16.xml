		<title>16VILLAGE ACTIVITIES TYLERHILL</title>
		<content>In the 1940s the village was given 5   
acres of woodland. The land was cleared
levelled and drained and sown with     
grass. It is now a fine open           
recreational area bounded by woodland. 
In 1981 money was raised to replace the
small village hall with a large new    
brick-built hall. It was designed and  
built mainly by the villagers in their 
spare time. Here are some of the       
activities which take place there.
