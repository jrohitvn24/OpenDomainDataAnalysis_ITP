 Bonchurch has two churches both       
 dedicated to St. Boniface. The small  
 Eleventh Century church is used for   
 candlelight services in the summer.   
 The Parish church was completed in    
 1849 and built by Day and Jolliffe of 
 Bonchurch.  The winter congregation   
 consists of 50 people. The Rector is  
 the Reverend Alfred Tedman who is also
 Vicar of Wroxall. Ian Snow is the     
 organist. Family Communion takes place
 at 11 am. on Sunday. The Alternative  
 Service Book is used. About 10        
 children meet on Wednesday afternoons 
 for instruction and tea. There is a   
 memorial to Admiral Jellicoe in the   
 Church. Algernon Swinburne and H.de   
 Vere Stacpoole are buried in the      
 churchyard.  There is a Church Hall   
 which was originally the National     
 School.                               </content>
