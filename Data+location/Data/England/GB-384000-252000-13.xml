		<content> Whittington is an Anglo-Saxon word.It 
 was first spelt HWITINGTUN which means
 the farm belonging to HWIT.The word   
 later became WHIT - hence WHITTINGTON.
 THE COUNTY GALLOWS were in Whittington
 on the site of 4 Whittington Rd. and  
 the Hangman's coach used to stand in  
 Walker's Lane.It is said that ghosts  
 of of hanged victims have been seen   
 near this site.CROOKBARROW HILL-(known
 as Whittington Tump) is oval and about
 six acres.X-rays have shown that it is
 not a burial ground as was once       
 thought.Roman coins have been found   
 in the field.The VILLAGE SCHOOL, this 
 church of England school was built in 
 1858,modernised in 1955,and it still  
 exists because I am a pupil there.The 
 village of Whittington has a church,a 
 public house and a population of some 
      people.
