 A single road from the main A 3O75    
 passes through Cubert ending at       
 Holywell.  A network of narrow roads  
 and lanes links the smaller hamlets.  
 Cornwall Bus and Coachways provide one
 bus service daily throughout the year.
 A private coach company also operates 
 a daily service to Newquay and Truro. 
 During school terms the schedule      
 caters for transporting children to   
 and from Cubert School from the       
 adjacent village of Crantock where    
 there is no school.  However, the     
 majority of residents rely on and use 
 their own private transport.          
                                       
 There is one daily postal delivery and
 two collections (not Sundays).  There 
 is one public telephone box in the    
 square at Cubert and one at Holywell.
