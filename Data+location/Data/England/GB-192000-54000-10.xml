		<title>10Water Wheels - Fal Valley</title>
		<content> The use of{water wheels}for industrial
 purposes was widespread in the region.
 Often shafts would transmit power up  
 to a mile from the site of the wheel. 
 Three remain visible in the Fal Valley
 north of St.Stephen. The most         
 accessible is close to where the road 
 to{Meledor}crosses the{Fal.}The wheel 
 is concealed in trees to the west of  
 the river on the north side of the    
 road. This is adjacent to{Melbur Mill}
 now used for loading tanker lorries   
 from hoppers. Rather more than a      
 kilometre to the north and west of    
 Treviscoe are two further wheels which
 are on opposite sides of the Fal      
 surrounded by intensive clay workings.
 They are difficult to find without    
 help and permission for access needs  
 to be obtained from English China     
 Clays. The disused railway along the  
 banks of the Fal is also owned by ECC.</content>
