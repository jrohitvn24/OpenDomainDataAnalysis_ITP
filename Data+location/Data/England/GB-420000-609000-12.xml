		<title>12SHOPS IN LESBURY &amp; HIPSBURN.</title>
		<content> The shops in and around the area of   
 Lesbury and Hipsburn are very few. In 
 fact there are only two. One is a post
 office as well as a shop and the other
 is a general purpose shop. We asked   
 some people in the area what they     
 thought of the two shops. One lady    
 said,"There aren't enough shops in    
 the area, it costs too much and there 
 isn't a big enough variety."So she    
 would go and do her shopping in a     
 supermarket where the prices were     
 lower. Then we asked an old man who   
 said,"There are enough shops but not  
 enough variety." So he, like the      
 other woman has to go to Alnwick to   
 shop.Some people said that they would 
 like a chemist or a butcher's shop in 
 the area.Alnwick is the nearest town  
 to Lesbury and Hipsburn.
