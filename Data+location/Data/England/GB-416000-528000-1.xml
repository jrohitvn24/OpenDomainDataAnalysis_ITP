		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO SURVEY</title>
		<content> The survey covers a rural area.       
 Despite being a predominantly mining  
 area in the past, villagers           
 occupations are now wide ranging.  The
 area is overshadowed by a high rate   
 of unemployment.  Typical of this is  
 Escomb, the unemployment blackspot of 
 our Survey.  With the closure of      
 collieries and ironworks, people have 
 been forced to leave the area and     
 almost whole communities have         
 disappeared.  Despite this and the    
 problem that most people have to      
 travel to work outside the immediate  
 area some of the community spirit     
 seems to have been retained and local 
 Community Centres are highly valued by
 the residents.  The area is steeped in
 history; for example the "Rail Trail" 
 follows part of the first public      
 passenger railway in the world - the  
 Stockton to Darlington line (1825)    </content>
