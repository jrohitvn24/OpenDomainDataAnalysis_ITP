 The area around Finedon has been      
extensively mined and quarried for iron
stone.Much of this has now been filled 
and returned to agricultural use,some  
infilling still continues to the south.
 North or Finedon the remains of       
Buccleuch gullet is much enjoyed by    
local people as a place of recreation. 
This public amenity is a preserve for  
widlife.                               
 At one time a light railway took      
ironstone to the Wellingborough        
furnaces which no longer exist.The     
cutting is now overgrown and makes a   
pleasant walk.
