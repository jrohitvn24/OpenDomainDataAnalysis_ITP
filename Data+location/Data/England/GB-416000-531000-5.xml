		<content> Our D-block covers a rural area and   
 there are about seven large farms and 
 a number of medium and small          
 farms.Nearly all the farms are mixed  
 farms,which not only grow crops but   
 also keep animals,usually cows and    
 sheep.                                
   Most farms in our D-block grow      
 cereals,mainly barley and wheat but   
 they also grow some oats . They grow  
 potatoes to sell and turnips for      
 cattle food.There is quite a lot of   
 dairy farming so farmers grow grass   
 for hay and silage.Most of the cattle 
 are Friesian.Quite a lot of sheep are 
 kept.
