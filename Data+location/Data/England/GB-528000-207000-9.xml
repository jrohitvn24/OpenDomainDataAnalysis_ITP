		<content>  Originally this brick built building 
 was a farmhouse and stables. As a     
 result there used to be an archway    
 through the building, that has been   
 filled in and is part of the pub.     
  It has been a public house for over  
 one hundred years. It was originally  
 called{"The Grifon",}but in the early 
 part of this century the village was  
 bought by{Earl Baker,}and the public  
 house was renamed as a result.        
  The facilities include a large public
 bar and the saloon bar. A games room  
 has now been incorporated in to the   
 public bar. There is a large, popular 
 garden at the rear.                   
  This is a{listed building,}it is in a
 conservation area, and the Green Belt.
