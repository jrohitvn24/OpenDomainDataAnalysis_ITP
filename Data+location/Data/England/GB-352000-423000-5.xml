 The local old peoples home was visite 
 and grandparents interviewed to help  
discover  traditional local childrens  
games  and compare them with those     
played nowdays. Games played now seem  
to involve a ball and games teams of   
children. Most popular are soccer,     
tennis, snooker and rounders.  These   
are played with the proper equipement, 
wheras the past there were more games  
involving  items that did not need to  
be bought, such as ring on a stringg,  
kick the can, and jacks and bobbins    
played with pebbles.  Other games      
played now are tig, kiss-dare, promise,
skipping hopscotch, knock- a- door- run
and hide and seek.  Of the some are    
very old such as hide andseek.

crows nest, diabalo and whip and top
