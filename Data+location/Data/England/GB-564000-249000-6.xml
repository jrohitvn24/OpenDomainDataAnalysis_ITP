		<content> Winter varieties of seed crops are    
 favoured for their high yeilds. Wheat 
 and barley are grown, wheat being sold
 mainly for flour. High quality barley 
 is sold for malting for the brewing   
 industry and the remainder for        
 livestock feed. Also recent springs   
 have been so wet and so late that     
 spring planting has proved difficult. 
 Straw is used for livestock litter,   
 producing manure ad the stubble is    
 usually ploughed in. Oilseed rape with
 its distinctive yellow blooms covering
 the land in early summer is also      
 nowadays a main crop, being sold for  
 vegetable oil, margarine, soap etc.   
 Some land is put to grass for silage  
 and also beans for cattle feed. Pure  
 bred Hereford cattle a particular     
 pride of the owner are kept at Thurlow
 Hall, and store cattle at Weston      
 Woods which are fattened for slaughter</content>
