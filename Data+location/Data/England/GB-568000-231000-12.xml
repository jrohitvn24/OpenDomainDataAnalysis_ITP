		<title>12Arable farming-Crops</title>
		<content>        In our area most farmers grow  
 crops of some kind or another.The most
 common are wheat,barley,potatoes,sugar
 beet and oil-seed rape.               
        Most farmers grow crops to sell
 and they are called cash crops.       
        Potatoes are an important cash 
 crop and so is wheat.Some farmers grow
 their crops to feed their animals     
 because it is cheaper than buying food
 for them.                             
        Crops will not grow on         
 rocky hills and the soil must be      
 soft and fertile.Wheat can be used to 
 make white bread and with barley you  
 can make beer.Potatoes have lots of   
 roots and are used for eating.        
        Sugar beet is another root crop
 from which we extract sugar.The local 
 processing plant is at Felsted.       
 Oil-seed rape is the newest crop and  
 is used for low grade vegtable oil.   </content>
