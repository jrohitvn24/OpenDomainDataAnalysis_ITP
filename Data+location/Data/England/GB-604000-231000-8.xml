 Because there are more shops than     
 usual in a typical village of less    
 than 2000 inhabitants there are more  
 local jobs. The catering industry:-   
 hotels, inns and high class           
 restauraunts also offers more         
 employment. Many people with large    
 houses employ part-time domestic      
 assistance.However in our sample of 40
 typical families with 69 people in    
 regular work only 20 are employed in  
 Dedham.11 are employed in Colchester  
 and a further 11 commute to London,60 
 miles away,6 offered services such as 
 building and decorating in the local  
 area. The school employs 17 people    
 either full or part-time. Other jobs  
 are associated with the Post          
 Office,garages and agriculture.
