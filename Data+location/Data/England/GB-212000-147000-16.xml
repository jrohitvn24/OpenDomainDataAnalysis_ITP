		<title>16The Landcover Survey.</title>
		<content> On Thursday we went right through the 
 middle of the island.It wasn't so long
 as going right round.We went to       
 Tibbets and had half of our dinner    
 there.I woundn't like to live at      
 Tibbets because it is so far away from
 the shop and pub.After that we walked 
 to the North Lighthouse  and had all  
 of our dinner.We saw lots of seals    
 down there.We went right through the  
 middle to do the land survey.Most of  
 it was heather and grass.From here to 
 Quarter Wall was rough enclosed       
 grazing ground.It got worse when we   
 got past Quarter Wall.It was all      
 ferns,heather and rock.               
 When we came back we saw Mr.Hanks on  
 top of Rat Island.Mrs.Dench told us to
 go and look for different kinds of    
 seaweed.We saw a Blue Rayed Limpet,it 
 was lovely but we had to go and put   
 it back where we found it.            </content>
