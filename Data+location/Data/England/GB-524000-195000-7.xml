 THERE WILL NOT BE AS MUCH RUBBISH IN  
 BINS ANY MORE. THERE WILL BE A RE-    
 CYCLING PLACE FOR CERTAIN RUBBISH. OLD
 SPECTACLES,BOTTLES,PAPER,RAGS OR EVEN 
 SCRAP CARS NEED NO LONGER BE WASTED   
 NOW THAT THE BARNET FRIENDS OF THE    
 EARTH HAVE RELEASED A RE-CYCLING      
 BOOKLET.                              
                                       
 "HIGH BARNET SCHEME"                  
 THE HIGH BARNET GOOD NEIGHBOUR SCHEME 
 HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR 18 MONTHS,  
 AND ALREADY HAS OVER 100 VOLUNTEERS.  
 THE SCHEME,BASED AT CHURCH HOUSE,WOOD 
 STREET,IS CALLED UPON BY A LARGE      
 SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY,AND THERE IS 
 AN INCREASING NUMBER OF HEALTH SERVICE
 REFERRALS. BUT SOME AREAS ARE NOT     
 FULLY COVERED AND HELP IS NEEDED WITH 
 TRANSPORT AND GARDENING.
