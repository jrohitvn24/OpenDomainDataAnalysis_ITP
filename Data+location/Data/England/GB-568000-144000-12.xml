		<title>12FARMING..APPLE GROWING.</title>
		<content>At Bockingfold farm they have sixty    
acres of Bramley apples.In the Autumn  
the apples are picked by hand,a long   
and tedious job.In Kent 98% of orchards
are picked by hand as orchards have to 
be planted in a special way to be      
picked by machine and also the fruit   
can be damaged by picking with         
machines. Frost is a great enemy for   
the fruit farmer as frost damages the  
fruit the most.At Bockingfold farm     
water pumped from the river is used for
the irrigation of the apples.In the    
spring,water is sprayed onto the fruit 
where it freezes and acts as an        
insulator against frost.Some farms have
constructed reservoirs for this        
purpose. When the apples are picked    
theyget 5 cwt.per acre.The oldest      
orchard at Bockingfold farm was planted
in 11950 and is still going strong.
