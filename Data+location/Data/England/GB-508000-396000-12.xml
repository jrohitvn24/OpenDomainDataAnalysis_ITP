 Yarborough'estate.it was a farm of    
 about 200 acres.It then became a pub  
 but was closed down in 1900 because of
 complaints about disturbances by the  
 ironstone workers.The house was built 
 of bricks from the local brick pit.The
 house is still standing although ther 
 are only about 5 or 6 acres of land   
 attached to it including the pond,the 
 paddock,the wood and the garden.Two of
 the children living there attend the  
 school and have to catch the school   
 bus every morning.
