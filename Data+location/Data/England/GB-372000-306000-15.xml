		<content>   The environmental studies which the 
 lower juniors undertake include visits
 to churches, abbeys, museums, and     
 shopping centres.These studies are    
 undertaken to a greater depth,with    
 more maths,science,and geography      
 developing from the visit.Children    
 visit the chosen area in class groups.
 At a later date small groups          
 travel in teachers cars for further   
 visits in the evenings.The lower      
 juniors begin team games of netball   
 and football,and much more emphasis   
 is placed upon science with the use of
 the Nuffield Science Scheme,amongst   
 others. Recorders are played and the  
 children  begin  to study formal      
 notation.                             
   A Fletcher Mathematics Scheme is    
 begun in the infant department and    
 continues throughout the school.
