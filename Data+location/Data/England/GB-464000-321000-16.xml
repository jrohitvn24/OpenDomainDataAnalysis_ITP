		<title>16Railway Test Track.</title>
		<content> British Rail have a test and          
 development track based at Old Dalby. 
 The track runs from Melton to Edwalton
 and the projects during the last year 
 have been:-                           
 1.A nuclear waste fuel flask used on  
 the railways was tested by having a   
 train crash into it at 100mph.The     
 flask did not break.The test cost     
 Â£1.5M.to set up.                      
 2.Tests on radio communication between
 trains and a central control.         
 3.Tests on new types of 4-wheel bogies
 for London Underground.               
 4.Load measuring wheel tests on trucks
 5.An opticlal measuring carriage.     
 Signals are bounced off objects at the
 side of the track.A computer can      
 measure how far the objects are from  
 the side of the train.This will be    
 used by the tilting high speed trains.
