		<title>11Home Life in Eccleshall</title>
		<content> Most Eccleshall families have comfort-
 able, well-equipped houses with small 
 gardens. Many keep pets for the       
 children. The mother's day is usually 
 geared to the comings and goings of   
 the children to school or local act-  
 ivities, when they often need taking  
 either by car or on foot. Most have   
 the usual labour-saving devices in the
 home, the most recent addition being  
 the microwave oven. With this and the 
 wide availability of convenience foods
 preparation time for meals can be     
 greatly reduced. Leisure activities - 
 mostly in the evenings - are well     
 supported. House decoration and main- 
 tenance occupy the men to a large     
 extent. Perhaps more time is spent    
 watching television than on any other 
 leisure activity, particularly as many
 families now possess a video recorder.
