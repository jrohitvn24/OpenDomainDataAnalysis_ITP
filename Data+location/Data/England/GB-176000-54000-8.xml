		<content> Rose Post Office is owned by Mrs      
 Partridge.She does family allowances, 
 bills,pensions,stamps and kodak       
 prints.The P.O.is small.She runs it   
 on her own.If anyone came to steal    
 anything they would find it difficult 
 because she has got a very vicious    
 dog.Just the{locals}use this P.O.     
 Originally it was joined to the shop  
 down the road.Her father had it before
 her.It has had three moves.At one time
 it was in her mother's kitchen and now
 it is in the old coal house.A bell    
 rings in the kitchen when someone     
 comes.She likes working in the P.O.   
 because its not very busy.She has been
 working there about 14 years.Â£35.80 is
 the basic pension but not many people 
 have that now.A married person gets   
 Â£21.50.There is a much larger P.O.in  
 Perranporth.Sadly,a lot of{small      
{village P.O.'s have had to close.     </content>
