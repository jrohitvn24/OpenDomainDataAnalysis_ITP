		<title>12KING STERNDALE:BUTTER CROSS</title>
		<content>                                       
 The cross is{3 giant stones on top of 
{each other.}There are 4 giant         
 semi-circle stones layed around the   
 bottom of the cross. You can tell the 
 stones are very old and have been worn
 away by the rain, for they have big   
 holes in parts.                       
   {On the market days the people      
{would sell items and goods around the 
{cross.}The cross's real title is the {
{butter cross.}It is said to be the {  
{oldest  relic in King Sterndale.}     
 People say it is medieval. In the     
 coronation year of King George VI,    
 1937, the parishioners of the  village
 church raised money for the cross to  
 be repaired.                          
      The Butter cross lies in an      
 overgrown field at the far end of the 
 village. Now all that lies there is a 
 few houses, a farm and fields.        </content>
