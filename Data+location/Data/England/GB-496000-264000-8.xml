		<title>08 Knotting Green Farm (Crops)</title>
		<content>  This farm is run by the consortium of
Hill Samuel and Velcourt, each sharing 
percentages of the profit. The farm    
covers 1700 acres, only a part of this 
falling within our region at Higham    
Park. The fields are widely spread and 
some are very large; two at Higham Park
being over 35 hectares each.           
  The main crops are wheat, barley and 
oil-seed rape. They do their own       
planting and spraying; a single tractor
covering about a hectare per hour means
it takes over a day to do some fields. 
  Combine harvesters operate at the    
same rate but they usually have three  
machines working together. They have 7 
tractors, 3 combines and sprayers.     
  Grain is stored in large buildings to
sell at suitable times.                
  In 1984, fire destroyed 43.8 hectares
of crops with 11.5 tons of grain per   
hectare.                               </content>
