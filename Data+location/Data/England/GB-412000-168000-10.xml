		<title>10The People of Fyfield.</title>
		<content> Over half the people have lived here  
 for more than 11 years. Most move here
 because they prefer country life or   
 because of their work.                
 There are few young people. The usual 
 age_range is between 35 and 60.       
 Village life sees few changes. People 
 remember national occasions like the  
 Queen's Silver Jubilee rather than    
 local ones.                           
 Most people are happy with local      
{amenities,}but some need better       
 transport facilities for people with- 
 out cars, and more social events for  
 the elderly and young.                
{Television}is the main entertainment. 
 A small number of people do not watch 
 much, because working on the land or  
 with animals leaves little spare      
 time. Many disliked so many American  
 and repeated programmes.              
                                       </content>
