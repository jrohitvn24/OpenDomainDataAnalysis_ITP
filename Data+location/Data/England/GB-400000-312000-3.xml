		<title>03UNEMPLOYMENT - HEDNESFORD</title>
		<content>During the 1980s, unemployment has     
risen and the total number of          
unemployed now stands at 3.5 million.  
Many school leavers in this area face a
grim future. Much of the traditional   
industry has declined or disappeared   
altogether.                            
   However due to the Youth Training   
Schemes set up by the government the   
percentage of unemployed school leavers
from my school has decreased. From     
1981/84 the percentage of those going  
into permanent employment has decreased
from 18% to 8%. Yet the number of      
unemployed has also decreased from 13% 
to 7%. This reduction has been caused  
by the increase in the number of those 
entering Training Schemes which has    
increased from 27% to 45%.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
