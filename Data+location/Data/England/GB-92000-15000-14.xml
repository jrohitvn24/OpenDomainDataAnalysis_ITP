		<content>    There are 14 flower farms whose    
 size range from one and a half acres  
 to 11 acres.Some of the bigger growers
 send approximately 3000 boxes in one  
 season,if it is a good year.The season
 starts in November and carries on     
 until early March. The farmers send   
 their flowers to Covent Garden and    
 markets in other major cities.The     
 flowers are transported to the        
 mainland by ferry,aeroplane or        
 helicopter,then they are taken up to  
 the markets in lorries.The flowers    
 season can be very hard work for the  
 farmers and their wives.The men have  
 to go out to pick the flowers in any  
 weather;when they come back the ladies
 have to tie the bunches.Later the men 
 have to pack the bunches into         
 boxes until late into the night.The   
 flower industry is vital for the      
 islands economy.                      </content>
