Kemsey Manor was the centre of many    
happy occasions and Somner treated     
everyone with great courtesy. To quote 
the Rev. Foster's funeral address,     
"The love which radiated first from    
Adbaston Hall and latterly from Kemsey 
Manor, has caught us all up and left   
us the better for its effect. You      
have only to think for example of the  
joyous times at Mother's Union         
parties, or the over 60's playing      
croquet on the lawn at Kemsey, to know 
what I mean. He looked to the future,  
and the younger generation had no more 
ardent advocate than he was." He was a 
humble man. "We shall not see his like 
again."                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
