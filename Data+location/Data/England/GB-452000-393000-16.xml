		<title>16A Limestone Quarry</title>
		<content> On a working day at the quarry, the   
 first step in retrieving limestone is 
 to drill into the rock face. When the 
 hole has been formed, explosives are  
 placed into the hollow area. In every 
 blast a quantity of 10-15,000 tonnes  
 of stone shatters from the rock side. 
 The limestone is put into a crusher   
 which breaks down the rocks and       
 crushes them into different sizes.    
 Limestone can be put onto farming land
 to counter acidity. It is used in road
 construction, brick and slab making.  
 When bitumen is added to limestone, it
 forms tarmac to be used for           
 resurfacing roads. Wet mix and lean   
 mix both use water and cement mixed   
 together with limestone. The Tarmac   
 Company have a fleet of 50 lorries,   
 each capable of carrying 16-20 tonnes 
 of limestone, mostly used in a 80     
 kilometre radius for road building.   </content>
