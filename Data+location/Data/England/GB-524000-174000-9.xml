		<title>09 EELING POND COMMON</title>
		<content>Is much larger  than Parson's Green,   
but there is now no sign of the        
pond from which it drew it's name. It  
is surrounded by houses that are rather
smaller than those on Parsons Green    
and the green is more remote from the  
everyday commercial world.There is a   
large area set aside for young         
children to play in;it has a great     
variety of play equipment and it is    
fenced off so that dogs may not        
enter.There is a separate concreted    
area for tennis and ball games.Mothers 
with thier young children visit        
frequently and there two play schools  
near by.
