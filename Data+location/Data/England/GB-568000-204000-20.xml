		<title>20CHELMSFORD,THE FUTURE.</title>
		<content> Chelmsford is progressing confidently 
 towards the 21st. century.Employment  
 in the area has not been affected by  
 the economic recession as badly as    
 other areas of the country.The        
 continued expansion of housing and    
 industry (including the Hi-Tech Park) 
 gives cause for optimism,as does the  
 fact that many local firms will be in 
 growth sectors of the economy in the  
 coming decades.
