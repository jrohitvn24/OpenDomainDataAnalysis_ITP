 break we had science.  Then at a      
 quarter to four I went home.  At first
 I went to the shops to by some sweets 
 and then I went home for my dinner it 
 was Oxtail - lovely.  Then I sat and  
 watched telly for a while until 6.00  
 when I had to go and visit my mum she 
 had just recovered from an operation. 
 Then I came home and watched Dallas at
 9.00, when it finished I went to bed.
