		<content>      The original village of Cambridge
 although on the natural route from    
 Bristol to Gloucester was able to     
 exist in comparative tranquility and  
 was able to offer refreshment to      
 travellers who wished to break their  
 journey.                              
      Of the two inns one, "The White  
 Lion", now run by Mr K.W.Thomas, was  
 established in 1760 and the other,    
 "The George", now run by Mr R.Whitely,
 was established in the late Eighteenth
 Century.  "The George" has built quite
 a reputation locally for its fine     
 meals and in 1983 it won the "Best    
 Wine Bar" award.                      
      The post office is a typical     
 small village one which also serves as
 a village shop and newsagents.  The   
 only other shops are two small        
 antique-type shops where one can buy  
 or sell almost anything.              </content>
