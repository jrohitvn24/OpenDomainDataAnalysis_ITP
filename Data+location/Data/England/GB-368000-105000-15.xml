		<title>15BUCKLAND NEWTON GARAGE</title>
		<content> The garage is much larger and busier  
 than it used to be due to the increase
 in traffic.The garage offers car      
 repairs,a breakdown service,new tyres,
 exhausts ,sweets and cigarettes.      
 Improvements have been made to the    
 garage with new equipment.They have a 
 new M.O.T testing bay, tuning         
 equipment,a new ramp,a workshop and a 
 new canopy. It started as a cycle     
 shop. The owner was Mr.Candy.Then     
 Mr.Knight bought it and did           
 agricultural repairs. Mr.Seeward      
 brought it in 1976 and started doing  
 car repairs.The busiest days of the   
 week are Saturdays and Mondays.       
 Saturdays are busy for selling petrol 
 and Mondays for repairs.The busiest   
 time of the year is the Winter because
 cars need more attention.
