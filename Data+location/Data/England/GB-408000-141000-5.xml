		<title>05FARGO PLANTATION, STONEHENGE</title>
		<content>  This plantation is owned by the      
 National Trust and has not been       
 ploughed since 1830. The first        
 planting of trees took place in 1953. 
 Prior to this it was natural woodland.
 It now contains a mixture of conifers,
 beech and some self set sycamores, and
 shelters such creatures as roe-deer,  
 hares and pheasants. The conifers,    
 which are in the minority, will be    
 felled when they reach maturity       
 leaving the beech to grow large.      
 Some damage was done to trees by pop  
 festival visitors and in 1983/84 the  
 National Trust cleared the trees from 
 the round barrows to prevent further  
 damage by roots. They also cleared    
 trees from the end of the Cursus,     
 which intersects the plantation, more 
 clearing may be done in the future    
 depending on where the proposed Study 
 Centre for Stonehenge is situated.    </content>
