		<title>06EMLEY MOOR COLLIERY</title>
		<content> By 1597 there were several small mines
 at work in and around Emley. The coal 
 seams in this part of the Pennine     
 foothills are thin and throughout the 
 eighteenth century the mines were     
 operated by a few men _ usually not   
 more than six per mine.               
 In the 1939 to 1945 war, and in the   
 1950's and 1960's, open cast mining   
 became a common sight in the area. The
 railway through Skelmanthorpe to      
 Clayton West was commenced in 1872 and
 led to a screening plant being erected
 at Skelmanthorpe. Coal from Nine Clogs
 Drift and Speedwell collieries was    
 conveyed there at first in tubs to the
 station via Skelmanthorpe Dayhole with
 the help of a steam haulage at Nine   
 Clogs Drift. Later coal was conveyed  
 from Emley Moor colliery.
