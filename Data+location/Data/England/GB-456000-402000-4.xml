    IN ANY PERIOD OF TEN YEARS THERE   
 ARE TRENDS WHERE DISEASES INCREASE OR 
 DECREASE. IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS MORE  
 MONEY WILL BE SPENT ON PREVENTING AND 
 CURING DISEASE. THE AIM OF            
 PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE IS TO STOP      
 DISEASE OCCURRING BY VACCINATION AND  
 IMMUNISATION. THE VACCINES ARE BEING  
 CONSTANTLY IMPROVED.                  
    THE BIRTH RATE AT THE MOMENT IS    
 RISING. THE POPULATION OF DONCASTER   
 IS 287,000 AND THE BIRTH RATE WAS     
 3.5%. IN 1984 CERTAIN PARTS OF        
 DONCASTER SUCH AS BENTLEY (A SMALL PIT
 VILLAGE) HAD A HIGHER BIRTH RATE THAN 
 OTHERS. THERE IS A MAIN GENERAL       
 HOSPITAL FOR THE DISTRICT OF DONCASTER
 CALLED THE DONCASTER ROYAL INFIRMARY.
