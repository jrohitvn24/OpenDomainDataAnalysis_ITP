		<content> On Tuesday the 28th of May I woke up  
 at 0700 I put on my pants,socks,      
 vest,dress and cardigan.Then I went   
 downstairs to have my breakfast.I had 
 coco pops and pure fruit juice and    
 salami with bread.When I had finished 
 my breakfast I played with my sisters 
 until my dad had finished his         
 breakfast.Then we went to get some    
 bricks to put underneath the rabbit   
 hutch that my dad had made.Afterwards 
 we went to buy some sawdust to put    
 inside the rabbit hutch.When we       
 returned we put the bricks underneath 
 the hutch and sprinkled sawdust in it.
 Then my Mum and I went to buy a       
 rabbit.I chose a himalayan rabbit.On  
 the way home I decided to call it     
 Penny.For the rest of the day I kept  
 taking her in out of her hutch for a  
 cuddle.I went to bed at 2030.
