		<title>13WARESIDE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> This is a solid construction          
 containing a solid wooden dance area  
 big enough to accommodate one hundred 
 dancers.There is a kitchen,bar and    
 ladies powder room.                   
 It is good having the hall because    
 there are discos which we children can
 go to and also a Youth Club for all   
 ages.We pay 25p each week.            
 The local drama group called the      
 Wareside Entertainers put on all their
 shows in the hall.They have really    
 funny pantomimes at Christmas and two 
 or three productionsduring the year.  
 They transform the hall with tiered   
 seating,brilliant lights and scenery. 
 The hall can be hired for wedding     
 receptions,birthday parties,          
 christenings,fund raising bazaars and 
 dances.The Church Harvest Supper      
 always takes place during the Autumn.
