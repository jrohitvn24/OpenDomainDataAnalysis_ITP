		<title>05FARMING</title>
		<content> Mr. Slater was born on a farm in      
 Allesley (84 acres). He took up       
 farming as his career and when he     
 married he moved to a smaller annex   
 farm with three fields; but still     
 worked at the larger farm, which he   
 now regards as his 'office' where he  
 goes daily to work. It is mainly a    
 dairy farm but does produce beef      
 cattle too. One of the three fields   
 attached to his smaller farm is left  
 for grazing and the other two are used
 for silage.                           
                                       
 Sometimes, depending on the weather,  
 the field is manured after the first  
 cutting and then a second cutting of  
 silage can take place. Chemicals are  
 also added; these vary as different   
 crops require different ratios of such
 chemicals such as sulphate of         
 ammonia, nitrogen, potash, etc.       </content>
