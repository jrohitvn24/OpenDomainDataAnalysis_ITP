		<title>04THE JEWISH SABBATH 2</title>
		<content> candles, two loaves of bread and wine 
 in a beautiful goblet.  Father makes a
 blessing, the kiddish, whilst the rest
 of the family stands.  After father   
 has said Kiddish, the whole family    
 wash their hands after which no one is
 allowed to talk. Father then makes a  
 blessing over the bread, which is     
 called "Challa".  The challa is three 
 lengths of dough plaited together to  
 make a tasty soft bread.  After the   
 blessing everyone takes a bite out of 
 the bread and then they are allowed to
 talk.                                 
                                       
 The meal may consist of traditional   
 chicken soup. During dinner the family
 sing and speak words from the law.    
 When dinner is finished God is thanked
 for the meal.
