		<content> Buxted Park and Deer Park is          
 considered to be a local beauty spot. 
 This consists of a church,manor house 
 ,lakes,woodland and deer.Even though  
 it is within easy access  of the town 
 of Uckfield and the surrounding       
 villages of Buxted,Framfield and      
 Five_Ash_Down we were surprised by the
 small number of local people who      
 visited the park even occasionally.   
    In this mainly rural setting it was
 hardly surprising to find that most   
 people worked on the land,while those 
 living in Uckfield and Framfield      
 mostly worked in white collar         
 industries in the surrounding urban   
 centres of Eastbourne, Brighton,      
 Tunbridge_Wells and London.
