{GIRL GUIDE CAMP.  }                   
 The land was bought from Lord Egerton 
 of Tatton during the second World War 
 (1939-1945). It became a camp sight   
 for Guides from South East Lancashire.
 It now serves Greater Manchester West 
 from Wigan to Altrincham including    
 Urmston and Stretford.                
 The site covers three acres. There is 
 a purpose built training centre where 
 senior guides can train for their     
 Campers Licence or which can          
 accomodate up to 16 Brownies. Guides  
 camp in tents or in wet weather use   
 two huts.                             
 There is also a caravan which can be  
 used by the site Warden during the    
 camping season.
