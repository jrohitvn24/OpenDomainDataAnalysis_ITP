 Colney Heath village is twinned with  
{Boissy sous Saint Yon}which is in     
 France. Keys of Boissy were presented 
 on the 25th of September 1982 by      
 Monsieur Amuary Courderc to John      
 Prodger,Chairman of Colney Heath      
 Parish Council.It all started when    
 Colney Heath sent out letters to towns
 in France.Boissy replied and we       
 thought they were a suitable town     
 because it was the same size as{Colney
{Heath}and the same distance from{Paris
 as Colney Heath is from{London.       
 There are about 300 people in the     
 twinning association.The twinning     
 works like this.A French family comes 
 over to Britain to their English      
 friends and vice versa.We have        
 barbecues,football matches,dances,    
 food, drink,outings and festivals.
