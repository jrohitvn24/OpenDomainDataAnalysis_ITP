		<title>01FINDON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Findon is a small, nuclear settlement 
 situated in a valley below Cissbury   
 Ring on the South Downs. Development  
 and Communications have been          
 restricted because of the location.   
 The village commands excellent        
 Downland views. Findon is a quiet,    
 peaceful, attractive and unspoilt     
 village. As a result it is a popular  
 location for people to retire to. The 
 buildings consist of older buildings  
 mostly of flint and brick with slate  
 roofs clustering around the 17th      
 Century Inn in the village centre,    
 with more modern buildings radiating  
 out to the periphery of the village.  
 Findon has retained its rural         
 atmosphere preserving its small       
 friendly shopping centre and sense of 
 community. There is a village school  
 and there are many clubs and          
 organisations for all age groups.     </content>
