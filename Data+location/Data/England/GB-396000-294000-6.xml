		<content>  The name Darlaston thought to be of  
 Saxon origin - after{Deorlaf}which was
 settled in the 7C. Darlaston became an
 important centre for manufacture in   
 metal after the industrial revolution.
 Some of the shops from the early 19C  
 boom period still stand around the    
 Bull Stake and Pinfold Street. There  
 is some new shopping development in   
 this area but there are lots of open  
 spaces now. Darlaston was in the news 
 in 1985 with the threatened closure of
 the{SERVIS}washing machine works.     
 Metal fastenings are still made but   
 many small fastenings works have      
 closed in the last 10 years. The{ASDA}
 Superstore is the only major employer 
 opened in recent years.               
  This square has a number of pubs but 
{The Swan}and{The Bell,}or{Blue Bell}  
 (from about 1700) are of particular   
 interest.                             </content>
