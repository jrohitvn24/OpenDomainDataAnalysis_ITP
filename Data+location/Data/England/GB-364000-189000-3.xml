		<title>03SEVERNVALE GARDEN CENTRE</title>
		<content> The Garden Centre is situated in      
 Milbury heath and it is visited by six
 to eight hundred customers weekly     
 during Spring, Summer and Autumn and  
 two hundred in the Winter. Interest in
 gardening has increased recently as   
 people have more leisure time. The    
 most popular purchases are shrubs,    
 house plants and fertilizers. The     
 centre also sells gardening           
 equipment, sheds, greenhouses, garden 
 furniture, patios and swimming pools. 
 There is a small cafe for light       
 refreshments. We spoke to forty four  
 customers and found that 80% of them  
 had travelled between five and        
 nineteen miles to shop. About 50%     
 enjoy gardening as a hobby. They visit
 the centre frequently, mainly to buy  
 shrubs and trees. Deliveries are made 
 over a large area, as far as Midsomer 
 Norton and Gloucester.                </content>
