		<title>02A COUNCILLOR IN BURTON</title>
		<content>   Roger Wright,a schoolmaster ,has    
been a Labour councillor on the Staffs.
County Council for five years.He stood 
for Council in order to do his best for
Burton Town,but first worked in more   
humble ways in his party branch.       
   Mr.Wright keeps in touch with his   
division through telephone calls,by    
walking round the area,calling in      
pubs,and reading the paper.He works on 
Council business most evenings,and has 
even been called back from holiday to  
vote in Council.                       
   He attends many meetings,both of the
full Council and of the Education      
Committee,but finds little gratitude   
for the hard work involved.            
   He would like Central Goverment to  
interfere less in local spending,so    
that social services could be improved.
His only political ambition is to be   
Leader of the Council.                 </content>
