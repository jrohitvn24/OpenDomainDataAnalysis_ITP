		<title>19"My Family's Old Cars"</title>
		<content> My Dad's car is maroon. It is a       
 Triumph Dolomite Sprint. It takes Â£2  
 worth of petrol to get to "town" (St. 
 Austell). It's very neat and tidy     
 inside and it takes four star petrol. 
 The side and back windows are tinted  
 blue. We have another car. It is a    
 Mini Traveller. There is a little back
 place where Prince my dog, and I sit. 
 The Dolomite has six headlights, three
 each side. We put the six headlights  
 on when no cars are coming. If we put 
 them on when other cars are coming it 
 could cause an accident. Our drive is 
 really bumpy so I like riding down it.
 Down at number eight there is a car   
 and it's always going wrong. My Dad   
 has to fix it.
