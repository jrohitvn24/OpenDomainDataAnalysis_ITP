		<content>{The area has great natural beauty and 
{historic character.                   
 Since Victorian days the{population   
{has grown rapidly.}Living standards   
 are high and there is an active       
 community life.                       
 In a{predominantly middle class}area  
 the houses are generally large and are
 served by an excellent transport      
 system.Shopping facilities include    
{high class}stores such as             
 Finnigan's, Sainsbury's and Safeways  
 and these are supported by a wide     
 range of private shops.Most workers   
 are employed outside the area.        
 Local festivals are held each         
 year.Clubs and societies are in       
 abundance and cater for all ages and  
 interests.About a quarter of the land 
 is{farmland or parkland,}thus,despite 
 modern development,the area still     
 retains its rural character.          </content>
