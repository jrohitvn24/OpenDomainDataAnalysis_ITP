  St.Mary's Church stands half a mile  
from the village and probably marks the
site of the original settlement. Dating
from 13th century, it is built close to
the ancient Ridgeway Path and stands in
picturesque rural surroundings:-       
  "You come here for happiness.        
  You come here with sadness.          
  You come here for peace..."          
 Recently the villagers have raised    
money in order to convert part of the  
East end into a Community Centre where 
many local residents of all ages can   
meet and where new clubs, societies and
friendships have been formed.          
  "The gentle sound of tolling bells   
  Reminds you of your loved ones.      
  You come here for weddings           
  And you come here for the dead."
