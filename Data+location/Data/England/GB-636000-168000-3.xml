 1064. Its outside has typical flint   
 walls with stonework around the       
 windows and doors. Inside the         
 Victorianrenovation still dominates   
 with a beautiful brass eagle lecton.  
 More recent is a mosaic behind the    
 alter.                                
    During the Nepolionic Wars the     
 tower wasone of a signal chain for the
 navy, so the white ensign is flown    
 from the tower on festive occasions.  
    the chuch hall was opened by Edward
 Heath the then Prime Minister who had 
 attended the local school. With the   
 Partland Cottage it is the centre for 
 many village groups-see Scouts and    
 Brownies-disco and old time           
 dancers-play school and disabled      
 group. Other groups meet at the       
 Memorial Hall which was originally a  
 wooden hut in the First World War.    </content>
