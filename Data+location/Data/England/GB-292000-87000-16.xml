		<title>16The Exeter ship canal</title>
		<content> The first canal was built by John Trew
 in 1566 and was the first lock canal  
 in the country. It linked the seaport 
 of Topsham to the trading centre of   
 Exeter. Trade expanded mainly due to a
 thriving woollen industry and in 1675 
 the canal was extended across the     
 Exminster marshes. The present canal  
 was completed in 1827 and was designed
 by the prominent canal builder, James 
 Green. By 1960 the canal ceased to be 
 a trading waterway. It is now a centre
 for leisure activities. The canal is  
 in need of development, resturation   
 and improvement and the Exeter canal  
 and quay development trust, a         
 registered charity has been form for  
 this purpose.
