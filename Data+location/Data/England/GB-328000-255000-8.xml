		<content>  Kington has got a very nice church   
 called St. Mary's. It stands on one of
 the highest points in the town. It has
 undergone a lot of restoration but    
 much of it is still the same as when  
 it was built. It is thought that a    
{Saxon}church stood on the site and    
 that a{Norman}church replaced it. St. 
 Mary's is now part of a team ministry 
 with 13 other churches. There are 4   
 priests for them all but from         
 September 1985 there will only be 3.  
 There is a choir of men, women and    
 children. Sometimes there is an       
 Activity Day for children to do drama,
 crafts, etc. A service is held for    
 Brownies and Guides on Thinking Day.  
 There is a Sunday School. St. Mary's  
 is used by Lady Hawkins' School       
 especially for the Foundress Day      
 Service held every year on the 29th of
 September.                            </content>
