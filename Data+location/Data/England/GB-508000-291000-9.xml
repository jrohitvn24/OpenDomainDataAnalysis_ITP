 A lady in the village of Elton still  
 practises the old art of spinning.She 
 heard the story of Sleeping Beauty    
 when she was a little girl and her    
 interest was aroused.She bought her   
 first spinning wheel during a Scottish
 holiday.She went to lessons and       
 practised at home.The stages of       
 spinning are washing the fleece and   
 letting it dry,combing the best bits  
 and rolling them into sausage shapes  
 ready for spinning.Two or three       
 strands are wound together to make    
 thread for knitting or weaving.She    
 dyes the wool,often using natural dyes
 from plants.She is good enough now to 
 lecture locally on the subject.It is  
 five years since she started this     
 hobby and she says it is very restful.
