		<title>03COLLIERY AT HICKLETON MAIN</title>
		<content> Work on Hickleton Main first started  
 in{1894.}It was deepened between 1921 
 to 1923. The Colliery itself was owned
 privately until 1947. When the pit    
 first opened{3024}people worked there,
 now there are 217 men working there.  
 The number of men who worked there at 
 its peak was{3500}people.             
 Hickleton Main has{three shafts.}One  
 of them is the{last steam shaft}in the
 North of England. It is{60}years old. 
 The underground workings are now three
 miles square. The pit has one coal    
 cutting machine for digging.          
 In the next two years the Colliery is 
 going through a development programme 
 which includes taking the steam       
 winding machinery out. The machinery  
 will go to a museum. This development 
 programme will make the number of men 
 working there{500}and bring coal      
 production to{500,000 tonnes}a year.  </content>
