		<title>04SPECIALISED EQUIPMENT (a)</title>
		<content> Much specialised equipment is used in 
 the hospital, (a) for diagnosis and   
 (b) for treatment.{                   
{The X-ray unit}contains modern remote 
 controlled equipment including an     
 image intensifier which simulates     
 treatment and can take many           
 photographs of one particular area.{  
{There is also a C.A.T.(Computerised   
{Axle Tomography) scanner}which is     
 capable of exceptional definition and 
 accuracy and which investigates areas 
 of the body previously inaccessible to
 radiological equipment.  The images   
 are stored on floppy discs and there  
 is a viewing room where these images  
 are enlarged.{                        
{In the Coronary Department}heartbeats 
 of patients are monitored continually.
 Coronary patients en route to hospital
 by ambulance can be monitored at the  
 hospital while still in transit.      </content>
