		<content> MR.STAPLES an elderly resident of     
 Partridge Green told us a couple of   
 stories.In 1942 there was a "Rag and  
 Bone Man"named STEVE TAYLOR who lived 
 in a shack on JOLESFIELD COMMON.One   
 day he went to PRETTY'S GARAGE to buy 
 paraffin for his fire.When he returned
 he poured the contents of the bottle  
 onto his fire,not knowing that it was 
 petrol by mistake.The flames leapt up 
 and he and the shack were burnt       
 down.In 1945 one of MR.STAPLES        
 lodgers,MR.THOMPSON,went out shooting 
 rabbits in another field.That night he
 did not come back.The next morning    
 MR.STAPLES went to look for him and   
 found him dead under an oak tree.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
