		<title>12The Wildfowl Trust</title>
		<content>  The{Arundel Wildfowl Trust}is one of 
 3 in England, it was opened 10 years  
 ago. There are 60 acres of wetland,   
 lakes and rough grassland with 850    
 wildfowl of 85 different species.     
 Some of the birds at the Trust are    
 wild and some are partly tame         
 collection birds.                     
  The Wildfowl Trust has 3 main        
 objectives:{enjoyment, education and  
{breeding.}In the past few years, two  
 species of wildfowl have become       
 extinct worldwide. The Trust breeds   
 rare birds and returns them to their  
 native habitat. Three recent projects 
 have involved Thailand, Hungary and   
 Australia.                            
  16,000 schoolchildren visit the trust
 every year as well as thousands of    
 adults.
