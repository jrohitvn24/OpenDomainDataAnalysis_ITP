		<title>11SAINT CATHERINE'S HILL</title>
		<content> At St Catherine's hill are Iron-age   
 earthworks,Bronze age burial mounds,a 
 Roman fort and 2 Reservoirs.{THE      
{IRONAGE EARTHWORKS}Built about        
 50 B.C.,too small to have been a      
 fort,was possibly a cattle enclosure. 
 It was oval in shape.{THE ROMAN FORT  
 Built about (50A.D.)probably a fort   
 because of military pottery found     
 there.It had a view over the Stour    
 river and a Roman road leading to a   
 place where the Avon could be seen.   
 Also the main trackways could be seen 
 so it controlled all the major routes 
 over and around St Catherine's hill.  
{THE BRONZE AGE BURIAL MOUNDS}Built    
 about (500B.C.) rest on a ridge on the
 hill to be seen,otherwise very little 
 known.{THE RESERVOIRS}Built           
 1940-1950's One is a huge concrete    
 drum and the other a huge roughly     
 rectangular shaped concrete building. </content>
