		<title>17FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content>  My family has two sets of twins,Adam 
 and Ryan who are eleven and Rebecca   
 and Kevin who are sixteen.Kevin and   
 Rebecca are my half brother and sister
 because my Mum's first husband was    
 killed in a motorbike accident        
 fourteen years ago.My Mum and Dad are 
 also twins.                           
  We live in a four bedroomed house in 
 Draycott Avenue,Taunton.One of the    
 bedrooms is a converted loft. Ryan and
 I share a bedroom.The house is forty- 
 one years old.                        
  We have moved houses seven or eight  
 times in my life.Before I was born my 
 Mum and Dad lived in Germany and      
 Ireland.This is because Dad was in the
 army.Now he works as a driver and my  
 Mum is a dental receptionist.         
  When I grow up I want to be a        
 solicitor.If I am,I will have to      
 work hard.                            </content>
