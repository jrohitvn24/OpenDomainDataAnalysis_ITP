		<title>08The village ghost, Plumtree</title>
		<content> Bradley's Yard, once a farmyard, but  
 now a small housing development, is   
 haunted by the ghost of a farmworker  
 who hanged himself in the 19th        
 century.                              
 The yard, tucked away by the Church   
 and rectory, now contains the original
 farmhouse, a converted barn and       
 several modern houses. The man is said
 to have committed suicide in the barn 
 and his ghost can be seen crossing the
 yard at dawn during the winter months.
 One of the villagers who, until       
 recently, delivered the milk, reports 
 that although she saw the ghost cross 
 her path on many occasions, she felt  
 no threat or malice from him. She     
 describes him as a "friendly" ghost.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
