 The area is mainly arable farmland    
 with practically no services for the  
 community. There are two small general
 stores, two garages and two pubs. Most
 of the inhabitants go out of the area 
 to work. Although there are large     
 farms, very few people are employed on
 the land, because farming is highly   
 mechanised.                           
                                       
 The area includes the villages of     
{Layer Marney}and{Layer Breton}and the 
 western reaches of{Abberton reservoir.
 Layer Marney is a scattered community,
 whilst housing in Layer Breton is more
 clustered. Personal transport is      
 almost a necessity and children have  
 to leave the villages to go to school.
