		<title>04ONE-WAY SYSTEM</title>
		<content> There has just been a{one_way system} 
 put in{Chapel Road}in{Earith.}The     
 police have changed the two_way street
 into a one_way system.We decided to   
 interview local people for their{     
{opinion}of this. Generally the        
 opinions of the safety on the road was
 good but several people thought it was
 a waste of money.{10 people agreed}on 
 the system and{13 people disagreed.}  
 The one_way street was put in to      
 prevent crashes and make it safer for 
 children to walk to school. A white   
 line has been painted on the left hand
 side of Chapel Road for{pedestrians  }
 and {cyclists }so they can still use  
 the road as normal.{20 people}stated  
 that they thought a pavement should be
 built instead of a white line to      
 prevent cars colliding with           
 pedestrians.
