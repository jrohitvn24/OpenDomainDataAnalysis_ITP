		<content> On our farm we buy South Wales        
 Mountain ewes which are 4 or 5 years  
 old.We buy them in September and put  
 them to the ram.We use Suffolk cross  
 Texel rams.                           
 The lambs are born in mid February to 
 the end of March.We inject the lambs  
 and worm the ewes.At the end of May we
 sell some lambs fat and the others are
 weaned off from their mothers and     
 separated for life.At the end of July 
 we sell the ewes and the lambs are    
 sold  slowly through the months.Last  
 year we had some lambs left at lambing
 time so we sold them as store lambs.  
 Each year we buy 100 ewes and sell    
 130 lambs.                            
    We feed the lambs on oats and      
 barley.                               
  The lambs make about Â£32 to Â£33 each.
