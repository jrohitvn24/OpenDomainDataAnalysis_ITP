   From our questionnaire we discovered
 that 42% of the households had        
 children.  6% went to playgroup, 27%  
 went to primary school and the        
 remaining 57% attended secondary      
 school.                               
     The most popular primary school is
 at Nassington and the most popular    
 secondary school is Stamford High.    
    The average  distance the children 
 had to travel to school each day is 14
 miles there and back. The furthest    
 distance a child had to travel is 76  
 miles both ways, and the shortest was 
 3.                                    
   60% of the children use the school  
 bus and 40% went to school through    
 private transport.                    
     Most people would like a primary  
 school  in Wansford although felt that
 a secondary school is  unnecessary.   </content>
