		<content> THIS BLOCK HAS BEEN SURVEYED BY       
 CURDWORTH W.I. AND FRIENDS THEREFORE  
 IT IS CENTRED AROUND CURDWORTH - THE  
 VILLAGE OF CURDWORTH IS A SMALL       
 FRIENDLY, QUIET, PLEASANT PLACE TO    
 LIVE WITH FARMS IN THE SURROUNDING    
 AREA IT STILL HAS A FEEL OF BEING IN  
 THE COUNTRYSIDE. THERE IS, HOWEVER THE
 SEWAGE WORKS TO ONE SIDE AND NOW THE  
 MOTORWAY TO THE OTHER. WATER ORTON IS 
 LARGER WITH A BUSY PARADE OF SHOPS AND
 A RAILWAY STATION BUT STILL KEEPS ITS 
 FRIENDLY VILLAGE ATMOSPHERE. WATER    
 ORTON IS ONLY PARTLY IN THIS BLOCK.   
 THE SURROUNDING AREA HAS TRUNK ROADS, 
 CANAL, SEWAGE WORKS, POWER STATION,   
 FARMS AND MOTORWAYS. THE CURDWORTH    
 WATER ORTON SECTION OF THE M42 BEING  
 BUILT IN 1985 HAS CAUSED MUCH         
 DIFFICULTY WITH THE LAND COVER. BOTH  
 VILLAGES HAVE A PARISH CHURCH, SCHOOLS
 PLAYING FIELDS, BUS SERVICES &amp; CLUBS. </content>
