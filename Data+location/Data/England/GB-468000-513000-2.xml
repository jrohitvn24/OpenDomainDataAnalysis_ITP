		<content>    The Chapel was built as a Primitive
 Methodist in 1876. It has a coke      
 boiler in the centre with the stack   
 suspended from the roof. The Women's  
 Fellowship meets for a prayer meeting 
 on Wednesdays pm. The Minister is in  
 the Guisborough Circuit - Service on  
 Sundays.                              
    The Norman style Church of England,
 built with local stone, is in the     
 Boosbeck Parish. There is an open     
 churchyard. Two Communions per week   
 are held, one on Sunday. A pulley bell
 calls worshippers. The clock strikes  
 hours and quarters.                   
    Both Church and Chapel have Sunday 
 Schools and also support each other in
 fund raising events.  Carol Singing   
 and Harvest Supper are joint affairs. 
 Other denominations do not worship in 
 the village.
