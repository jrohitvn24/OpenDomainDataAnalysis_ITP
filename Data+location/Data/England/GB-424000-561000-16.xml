		<content>   A survey of parents by class 4 at   
 St.Wilfrid's school showed that people
 who had lived here all their lives    
 would not like to move. They were used
 to the area. Their{families}and{      
{friends}lived here. They liked the    
 people and had good{neighbours}.      
   Most of them liked the{Stadium,     
{library and Community Centre}but would
 like more{open spaces}where youngsters
 could play and be creative instead of 
 having organised activities.          
   They thought that the Felling       
 by-pass was too dangerous although    
 they would like more bus services.    
   Some parents did not like the area. 
 It was{not as good as it used to be.} 
 Litter and vandalism were problems and
 people needed to get together to clean
 up and improve the place.
