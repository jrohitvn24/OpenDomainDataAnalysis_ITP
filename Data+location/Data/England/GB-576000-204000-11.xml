		<title>11   THE PICKLED KNIGHT</title>
		<content> It was on the 16th of October 1779    
 some workmen were digging a grave     
 for Mrs Frances Ffytche at a position 
 just beneath a niche in the north     
 wall.They discovered a lead coffin    
 without any inscription or marks.The  
 opening of the coffin was delayed for 
 a few days but then the workmen       
 raised the lid.Inside the lead coffin 
 was another coffin made of elm.Inside 
 the coffin was a body.This was covered
 in a dark olive cement.Once the shell 
 had been broken a view of the body was
 seen.The coffin was half full with    
 liquid, a liquor of pickle leaving the
 body half exposed above the surface.It
 was the body of a man clad in         
 armour.There was no hair on the       
 knight.Folling the disturbance to the 
 body the parishioners were allowed to 
 inspect the body.Then the coffin was  
 closed and put back in its place.     </content>
