there is a triangular section supported
by pillars.Underneath the pillars is a 
platform of stone about 10 feet

leading onto the platform from the     
floor.                                 
  There are many windows set in the    
front of Ragley Hall which are         
latticed.The building is split into    
three sections with the centre         
section,the longest,set back from the
