		<title>08FARMHOUSES IN A_J_M</title>
		<content> The{farmhouses}are typical of this    
 part of the country.Most are large red
 bricked buildings with sloping roofs  
 of tiles or slates.They vary in{age   
 between the 16th century and the      
 present,although Brayne Hall goes back
 to 1248.Like most of the others it has
 been added to many times.They are well
 kept and most are still used as proper
 farms,although the flagged kitchens   
 are usually used as living rooms;a    
 modern kitchen being built instead.   
 The{furniture}is often antique family 
 pieces or reproduction in keeping with
 the style.They usually have open fires
 but most have central heating as well.
 Some were part of large estates which 
 no longer exsist and show that        
 particular style.{Outbuildings}are    
 extensive and generally well kept.
