		<content>  The W.I. was started in Shipham in   
 February 1922, to give local women the
 chance to catch up a little on their  
 education. In 1950 when Shipham was   
 only a small village there were over  
 90 members.Today there are 30 members,
 mostly older women.                   
  At the beginning of each monthly     
 meeting business decisions are made   
 like choosing representatives for     
 various regional or national          
 conferences or fixing dates for the   
 next fund raising event.              
  Stimulating talks are the main       
 activity of the evening and the       
 variety of topics can be from         
 miniature dolls furniture to the      
 importance of flower arranging.       
 Sometimes they have competitions for  
 everyone to try like fitting as many  
 things in a matchbox as possible.
