		<title>13Health Doctors,Droxford race</title>
		<content> My Dad is one of 5 Doctors who care   
 for people in Wickham,Droxford &amp; close
 villages.The surgery is in High St.   
 Most people visit the surgery if they 
 are ill.Doctors visit elderly and very
 ill people at home.If people are very 
 sick or need an operation they are    
 sent to Winchester,Portsmouth some_   
 times Southampton.In August people    
 will have to make an appointment to   
 see the Dr.They can get their pre _   
 scriptions from the Pharmacy in the   
 waiting room.There are lots of other  
 people who go to visit sick people:the
 Midwife for someone who is going to   
 have a baby,the District Nurse and the
 Health Visitor.Once a month a Chiro_  
 podist comes to the village hall.The  
 Baby Clinic is held there once a month
 15th June{Droxford 10km. road race}had
