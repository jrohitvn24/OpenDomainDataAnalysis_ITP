		<content>    These are some of the games which  
children play for entertainment in the 
playgrounds of Bedgrove First and      
Middle Schools and Weston Turville     
Combined School.                       
   " Bus 21 "is a playground game.This 
is played when one person is it.They   
have to count to 200 in fives slowly   
and when they are counting the rest of 
the children go and hide.Then when the 
person who is it has finished counting 
he looks around and if he sees anyone  
who is hiding,he shouts "Bus 21" I see 
you.This carries on until everybody    
has been seen,then the first person    
that is seen is it.At Weston Turville  
School we play a similar game called   
"Bonio-Home".
