		<title>18A LOCAL CUSTOM</title>
		<content> In Allendale there is a special custom
 which takes place at {New Year.}In    
 this custom people carry {Tar Barrels 
 which have a special name -{Barls.}   
 About 90 years ago the Tar Barrels    
 would be Tar Barrels but now they use 
 fruit and jam barrels. These are      
 filled with wood shavings and chopped 
 sticks coated with paraffin.          
 The Barls are lit at 11.35 p.m. at the
 Church and carried in a procession led
 by the band. The procession proceeds  
 around the out skirts of the village  
 and back to the{Bonfire}in the market 
 place. When the men arrive at the fire
 it is nearly{Midnight}and so one by   
 one the{Barls}are flung onto the fire 
 causing a huge blaze. As the Church   
 clock strikes {Midnight}everyone in   
 the Market place joins hands to sing,{
{"Auld Lang Syne"}and everyone wishes  
 each other a Happy New Year.          </content>
