		<content> Maple Cross is a village a few m1les  
 from Rickmansworth.The population is  
 medium for its overall size with a    
 housing estate,some of the original   
 houses and quite a large park area    
 with a small wood , swings etc.       
 Living in Maple Cross is ,I suppose,  
 just like living in any village with  
 its Newsagent and the Grocer which    
 sells anything you would want in a    
 week, from food and drink to your     
 everyday toiletries.                  
 Before the M25 was built,Maple Cross  
 had long tailbacks during the rush    
 hour and it became very hard to get   
 out onto the A405,but now the new     
 Motorway has opened there is alot less
 traffic on the main road but the      
 vehicles left travel at well over the 
 speed limit of 40 M.P.H.Now Maple     
 Cross is a much quieter place!
