		<title>05METHODIST CHURCH,THORNSETT</title>
		<content> My mum and dad live in the converted  
 methodist church,it was built in 1903 
 AD.it was partly a school and a church
 my dad converted it himself and my mum
 helped too.When i said it was partly a
 school it was apart of Thornsett      
 school.Before the methodist church was
 built there was another one which was 
 smaller but it got knocked down and   
 this one was built instead and it was 
 bigger.the church was made out of     
 stone in 1903.And some of the stones  
 were specially laid by people whose   
 names are engraved on them.The organ  
 in the methodist church was dismantled
 and taken away to be reconditioned and
 taken to a church in Hale Barnes.
