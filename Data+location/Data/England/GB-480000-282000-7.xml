		<content> We interviewed sixteen people and they
 had a number of opinions about family 
 life today.                           
 Generally, most people felt that there
 was not so much discipline in families
 today when compared with their own    
 childhood. They felt that chidren also
 had too much freedom.                 
 The average number in each family was 
 four and each family had at least one 
 young child.                          
 All of the people interviewed lived in
{Desborough}and had lived there between
 one month and forty three years. Most 
 said that they had been attracted to  
 this area by its good housing and job 
 prospects. Two said that they found   
 Desborough to be more social and      
 friendly than their last place.       
 Family entertainment consisted of     
 going swimming,to parks,              
 concerts,walking,and watching T.V.    </content>
