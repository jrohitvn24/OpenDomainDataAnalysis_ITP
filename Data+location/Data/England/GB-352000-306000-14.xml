		<title>14PLAYING FIELD, CROSS HOUSES</title>
		<content>{In 1982,}off the Cross Houses to      
 Brompton road, a piece of land owned  
 by{The National Trust}was leased to   
 the{Parish Council.}This land had to  
 be drained. Grants were obtained and  
 local people raised further money to  
 pay for the work.                     
 At the picnic and games opening by    
 Mr.S.Yates (who farmed the land) in   
 1984 it was called{"Sidney Yates Play 
{Field".}Commemorative mugs were       
 presented to all the people who were  
 present.                              
{Money}is still being raised by the 100
 Club, fortnightly Bingo and occasional
 Cheese and Wine Evenings. This is     
 needed to finance the surface of the  
 car park, and the rent and maintenance
 of the field and for purchase of      
 swings, slides, and a climbing frame.
