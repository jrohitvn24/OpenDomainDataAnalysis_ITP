		<content> The farming in the area is mixed. The 
 farmland is mainly given over to      
 temporary pasture as well as for      
 fodder crops. The fodder here is a new
 root crop derived from crossing rape  
 with turnip, and is grown on many     
 farms throughout the area, including  
{Hipley Barn Farm}in the north. As well
 as pasture,{Carman's Farm}in the west 
 has maize and{Ashlands Farm}in the    
 north grows potatoes.                 
 The livestock consists of both dairy  
 and beef cattle. Hipley Barn Farm in  
 the north has l5O dairy cows, which   
 are milked twice a day. A mill is     
 situated near Carman's Farm in        
 Boarhunt, alongside the Wallington    
 river.
