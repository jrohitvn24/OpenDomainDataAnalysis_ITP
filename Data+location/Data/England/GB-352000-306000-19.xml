		<content> My family and I own{2 cats and one    
{dog.}Our dog is a female, black and   
 white{Jack Russell terrier}called     
 Tinker. She is 13 years old, two years
 younger than my older sister, Becky.  
 Tinker gets fed "Mr.Dog" dog food at  
 the time when I have my tea (6pm.).   
 She has a plentiful supply of water.  
 I take her on walks as often as I can.
 I like taking her down the lane to    
 Brompton on her lead, but she prefers 
 going down the field behind our house.
 Tinker understands most commands,like 
 "stay, walkies" and sometimes "sit!". 
 She usually sleeps on a chair in the  
 kitchen. She is a lovable dog and     
 doesn't bite. She is rarely naughty   
 except when she eats the cats' food.  
 The{two cats}are twins and can be told
 apart by their different coloured     
 noses: one is black, the other is     
 pink.                                 </content>
