		<content>  For those without cars,transport is  
 very difficult.The local garage runs a
 coach servce to Plymouth 3 times a    
 week;to an out of town superstore once
 a week;and to Liskeard twice a month. 
  During term time,coaches take        
 children to Looe each day and students
 to the Mid Cornwall College at St     
 Austell.The public can also use these 
 services,but the times are            
 inconvenient for most people.         
  8 trains a day run on the branch line
 from Looe(5mls) to Liskeard which     
 connects with the main line,but very  
 few 'Plinters'use the service.        
  Our survey(59% return) shows that 65%
 travel to work by car;17% by lorry;6% 
 by motorbike.The remainder walk.      
  A number of village groups have      
 combined to purchase a 15 seat minibus
 and this is in regular use.The Lions  
 Club of Looe also have a bus available</content>
