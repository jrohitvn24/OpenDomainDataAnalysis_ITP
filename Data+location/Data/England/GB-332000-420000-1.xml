		<content>   On July 13th 1985, eight of us went 
 on the marsh with Mr.Mawby.We passed  
 under an electric fence and saw some  
 shellducks, lapwings, oyster-catchers 
 and a grey plover.Then we came to a   
 big channel which we had to cross.    
   On the other side we found the nest 
 of a black-headed gull.We heard alot  
 of screeching from gulls and common   
 terns flying overhead.We found a      
 tern's nest with one chick and two    
 eggs.Mr.Mawby weighed, measured and   
 then ringed the chick.Some of the     
 chicks had been killed.When we moved  
 away the mother came back with some   
 fish.                                 
   On the way back a man showed us a   
 redshank's nest.We passed under       
 another electric fence and then the   
 man said "You will have to be careful 
 where you stand because the nest is   
                                       </content>
