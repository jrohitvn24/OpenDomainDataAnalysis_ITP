		<content>   We visited a Public House called The
 Black Boy.  The Landlord was very     
 generous and gave us all a glass of   
 Coke.  We talked to him about his     
 general day.  For breakfast he would  
 have tea, toast, bacon, egg, sausages 
 and fried bread. He even showed it to 
 us!  His favourite meal was seafood   
 and fish.                             
 In The Black Boy more people drank red
 wine.  Prices were about average.  A  
 glass of wine cost 75p; a pint of     
 lager 88p; a glass of Coke 35p and a  
 glass of gin was 60p.                 
 He woke up at 8.45am and finished     
 serving in the evening at 11pm, and   
 went to bed at midnight. His day off  
 was Thursday.                         
 The improvements that he would like to
 see are having a General Store and a  
 good, clean family Grocer.
