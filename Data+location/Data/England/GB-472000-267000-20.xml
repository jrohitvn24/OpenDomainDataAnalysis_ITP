		<title>20MODES OF TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS ALMOST TOTALLY    
 ABSENT FROM THIS AREA SO THAT THERE IS
 AN UNUSUALLY HIGH INCIDENCE OF CAR    
 OWNERSHIP, WITH SOME FAMILIES HAVING  
 TWO, THREE OR MORE CARS. SOME OF THESE
 MAY HOWEVER BE "COMPANY VEHICLES" -   
 PROVIDED BY THE EMPLOYER, PARTICULARLY
 FOR "REPRESENTATIVES" WHO GENERALLY   
 WORK OVER A WIDE AREA. SEVERAL REPS.  
 TEND TO LIVE IN THE AREA BECAUSE OF   
 EASY ACCESS TO THE MOTORWAY SYSTEM.   
 UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO LONGER RAIL 
 PROVISION. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN A    
 GOODS LINE WAS OPENED TO TRANSPORT    
 SUGAR BEET FROM LOCAL FARMS TO THE    
 REFINERY AT PETERBOROUGH BUT THIS WAS 
 AXED BY DR. BEECHING IN HIS FAMOUS    
 REORGANISATION OF THE RAILWAY NETWORK.
 THIS SINGLE ACT WAS SUFFICIENT TO     
 CURTAIL AND FINALLY HALT SUGAR BEET   
 PRODUCTION IN THE AREA AS TRANSPORT OF
 THE CROP BY ROAD PROVED IMPRACTICAL.  </content>
