		<content>  Our block is in the Chilterns.It is  
 predominately undulating farmland,with
 approximately 1/5 privately owned     
 woods.It includes most of Old Amersham
 Coleshill and Winchmore Hill,and all  
 of Penn Street.                       
 As it is only about 30 miles from     
 London some people commute from New   
 Amersham and Beaconsfield. There has  
 been an influx of many people from    
 outside the area,but a large number   
 have lived here for generations.      
 Few houses have been built within the 
 last 30 years. There is a great       
 variety of styles,with many typically 
 Bucks:brick and flint houses.         
 It is well-served by amenities (just  
 outside our block.)Altogether it is a 
 very pleasant area in which to live   
 and there's lots to do.The only       
 disadvantage is, it is not near the   
 sea.                                  </content>
