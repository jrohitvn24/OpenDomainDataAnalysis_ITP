   There is only one factory in the    
 area:{Godwin Pumps.}It was founded    
 over one hundred years ago by William 
 Joynes Godwin.His first activities    
 were draining fields by digging       
 ditches. He then started to provide   
 water by drilling a borehole and      
 building a windmill to pump the water 
 to the surface.                       
 Mr.Godwin's business was given a boost
 when at the turn of the century he    
 successfully pumped water around the  
 estate at Hatherop. The water came    
 from an artesian well.                
  Today the company makes pumps small  
 enough for a garden fountain and large
 to drain gravel pits.Many of these    
 pumps are exported.                   
  Most of the hundred workers live     
 within five mies of the factory.
