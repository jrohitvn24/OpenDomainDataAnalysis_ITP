		<content>  The first Saturday in June was       
 Carnival Day. Our float from Grays    
 South Play Centre was of nationalities
 of the world. My mum was dressed as a 
 Pearly Queen. She made her own        
 costume. She made mine too. I was a   
 Spanish lady. My dress was black and  
 purple. I had a real Spanish shawl and
 I wore a rose in my hair.             
  We set off from Kilverts Field at    
 half past two. It seemed a long way to
 Blackshots. We received a trophy.     
                                       
  {MY CARNIVAL COSTUME}                
 I was dressed as Worzel Gummidge the  
 scarecrow. I had straw in my hat and  
 in my sleeves. My trousers had splits 
 at the bottoms. I had a big nose and a
 toy bird in my pocket. I carried an   
 umbrella. I looked funny.
