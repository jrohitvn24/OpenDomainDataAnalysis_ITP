		<title>04Shopping in Collingham</title>
		<content> The shops in Collingham sell{everyday 
{goods}such as food and drink.There is 
 also a newsagent,and a motorist's     
 shop.For clothes and shoes which are  
 called{occasional goods}people tend to
 go to Newark,Nottingham or Lincoln,but
 if just a few things are needed like  
 cheese eggs and butter,the Collingham 
 shops are used.One shop owner said    
 that it was hard for a small shop to  
 be competitive.He collects his goods  
 from the large towns in a van.The     
 shop's busiest day is Friday,as people
 are buying in for the weekend.        
 There are the least number of shops in
 Collingham this century.{16 shops have
{closed in the last 30 years}as better 
 transport facilities have             
 provided easier access to Newark and  
 Lincoln.
