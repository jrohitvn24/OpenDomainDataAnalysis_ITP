		<title>12PAKEFIELD BEACH AND FISHING</title>
		<content>The foreshore at Pakefield has built up
considerably over the past 20 years as 
a consequence of the construction of   
wooden groynes to prevent the erosion  
of the beach and cliff by the sea. This
foreshore is made up almost entirely of
shingle which slopes steeply down to   
the sea and which is, on average, some 
200 metres in width from the cliff to  
the sea.  On the foreshore is kept the 
local fleet of some 50 longshore boats,
so called because they are used for    
{fishing} along the shore.The boats are
mostly of wood, are clinker built and  
are about 5 to 8 metres in length.     
They are launched from the {beach} over
short wooden planks known as 'skeets'. 
Having rowed through the breakers the  
fishermen start the outboard motor.    
They catch cod and whiting by long     
lining, trawl for shrimps, soles and   
dabs and use drift nets for herring.   </content>
