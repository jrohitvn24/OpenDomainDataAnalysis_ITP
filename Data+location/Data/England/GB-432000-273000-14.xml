		<title>14TINKER PROBLEM</title>
		<content> The question of  where itinerants     
 should be allowed to camp has caused  
 friction in many areas.Some councils  
 have set up special permanent sites   
 but local people tend to oppose the   
 practice.Baginton is no exeption where
 fifteen {traveller's }caravans have   
 been parked near the airport  defying 
 a High Court writ to move.Local people
 complain that rubbish dumping is      
 making the area an eyesore.           
 The issue has become{political}as the 
 labour run West Midlands Council is   
 sending four councillors and two      
 officers to Dublin to find out why    
 Irish tinkers come to Britain. The    
 West Midlands Tory leader Alan Hope is
 opposing the scheme as 'insane' as the
 question can be put to Irish tinkers  
 already here and save the ratepayers  
 Â£2,000.
