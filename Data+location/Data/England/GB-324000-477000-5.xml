		<content>  Every two weeks some of the older    
 children in Pennington go the youth   
 group.We play volleyball,snooker,     
 Australian netball and we listen to   
 records.Sometimes we have a disco.The 
 "Chit Chat"is a newspaper produced by 
 a group of people to inform villagers 
 about the local news and let them know
 what is happening in the future.It has
 been produced for two years.It comes  
 out every month.                      
  On Saturday afternoons,children and  
 adults go to the Archery Club.The club
 has revived recently and it has       
 produced some champions.Members have  
 entered competitions locally and in   
 Lancashire.                           
  There are many other clubs like the  
 "Over 60's",the Mothers Union,the
