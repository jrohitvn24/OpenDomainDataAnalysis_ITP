		<title>05 The Gamekeeper (cont.)</title>
		<content>   Most shooters bring their own dogs  
to collect the dead birds,but some     
professional men bring trained dogs to 
collect the birds which the shooter's  
dogs have not found.                   
  Partridge shooting starts on the last
Saturday of September and pheasant     
shooting on the 3rd week of            
November.The season ending on the 1st  
of February.                           
  The gamekeeper does not have any     
employed helpers but friends come at   
weekends and some evenings to help.He  
usually starts work at 6 a.m. and      
continues until 9.30 p.m.He rears      
Melanistic,Ring-Neck,Black-Neck and    
Chinese pheasants on the Ragley Estate 
and it costs about 10 pounds to get    
each bird into the air.A few poachers  
have been known on the Estate but not  
enough to reduce the amount of birds.
