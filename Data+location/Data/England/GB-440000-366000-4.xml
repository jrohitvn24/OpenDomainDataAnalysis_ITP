		<content> Before entering the galleries we were 
 given protective helmets. We clipped  
 lights to them and carried the heavy  
 batteries in our hands. Once inside we
 were surprised how big the first      
 tunnels were. We saw conveyor belts   
 and large electricity generators. All 
 was quiet except for men being given  
 instructions along one of the tunnels.
 "Things are not always as quiet as    
 this," said our guide switching on the
 machines. The noise was deafening. "We
 have controlled the problem of dust in
 the mines, but not that of noise," we 
 were told. The tunnels got lower and  
 soon we were moving on hands and knees
 It was dark and the lights on our hats
 pointed the way. A frienly voice      
 greeted us at the end of the tunnel.  
 Day light was lovely. It was just like
 being in a real coal mine. "I'll stick
 to teaching you nuisances," said Mr.K.</content>
