 industrial estate. The road had never 
 been intended for such heavy traffic  
 also heading for the nearby{M66. }

 following opinions :                  
{90%}felt that action taken sooner     
 would have saved the road.

 their businesses had been badly       
 affected                              
{80%}thought that there should be a    
 restriction on lorries when it does   
 reopen (late 1985).
