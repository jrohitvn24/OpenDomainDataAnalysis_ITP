		<content> This is a 21 acre deciduous wood, 3km 
 S.W. of{Malmesbury.}When{Mrs. Fry}of{ 
{Coach house, Cole Park}bought the land
 in{1954,}it had been very neglected.  
 She started to plant{3000 trees}and   
 cleared the paths and rides, which    
 still have to be cleared each year.   
 She has planted young trees every year
 and someone is working in the wood    
 every day. She has replaced trees     
 killed by{Dutch Elm Disease,}with{    
{Sycamore, Oak, Birch, Beech, Chestnut,
{Regenerated Elm}and others. Mr. Fry   
 planted a{Hazel coppice.}They have    
 also planted an area of{Conifers.}The 
 most recently planted tree is a       
 Scarlet Oak planted in 1984. The      
 different kinds of trees make a good  
 habitat for a wide variety of birds,  
 animals and plants.{In a recent bird  
{count, 48 species were recorded.  }
