		<title>09POULTON AS A SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content> Poulton-le-Fylde is an old market town
 of 17,666 people. In recent years the 
 shopping centre has changed to serve  
 the population of the town and the    
 shoppers from nearby rural areas. The 
 old centre around the church,which is 
 now pedestrianised, still contains the
 stocks and fishslabs of the old       
 market. In 1974 the Teanlowe Indoor   
 Shopping Centre was developed,        
 incorporating a library, bus terminal,
 main Post Office and Public Toilets.  
 Large free car parking areas nearby   
 are accessible by a one-way system    
 which also allows the movement of     
 through traffic. There is a variety of
 food shops in the town, including four
 supermarkets and many grocers and     
 butchers. There are several household 
 goods stores  and branches of all the 
 main banks and building societies.
