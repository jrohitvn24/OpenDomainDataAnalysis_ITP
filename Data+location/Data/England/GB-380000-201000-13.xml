		<title>13RECREATION: DISCO DANCING</title>
		<content>{AT A DISCO}there is a man who plays   
 the records; he is called a Disc      
 Jockey.At Discos there are flashing   
 lights of different colours; they are 
 called Disco-Lights. There are        
 different styles of lights;sometimes  
 they are made to flash in patterns on 
 the ceiling and walls.They can hurt   
 your eyes though. The records are     
 played very loudly; they can hurt your
 ears! The boys always do break-dancing
 or body-popping.Here are some of the  
 things that they do:                  
      {Head Spins, Caterpillar, Turtle,
{Windmill, Back Flips, Popping, Hand   
{Spin, Knee Spin and Swallow Dive.}    
 Parents do not like us doing break    
 dancing because they say it is        
 dangerous.Some people have hurt their 
 necks but we still do it!
