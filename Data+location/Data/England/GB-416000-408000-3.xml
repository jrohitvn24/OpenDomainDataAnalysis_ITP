		<content> Dr. Martin Dey took over the village  
 practice from his father in 1968. His 
 father had worked on his own from a   
 large house on The Knowle for 33      
 years. He had about one thousand      
 patients when he started in 1933. Dr. 
 M. Dey continued to work from the     
 house until 1975 when a new health    
 clinic was built in the centre of the 
 village. He now works here with two   
 other doctors and has two thousand    
 eight hundred patients himself and    
 between them they have six thousand   
 two hundred. People usually get their 
 prescriptions made up at the Clinic.  
 Twelve other people work at the       
 Clinic. Once a year one of the Mobile 
 Dental Units visits the Centre but in 
 the last year a dentist has set up her
 own practice on a part time basis. She
 uses a converted cottage as a surgery 
 and waiting room.                     </content>
