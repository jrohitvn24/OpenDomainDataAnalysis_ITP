		<content> In his book "The County of Durham",pub
 A&amp;C Black1924, Mitton talks of "...the
 coal-smoke &amp;the stythe from the coke- 
 ovens &amp;brick-kilns which stunt theonce
 luxuriant growth of trees &amp;plants..the
 noisome tar &amp;oil which escapes downthe
 waterways poisoning life..". Whilst he
 was ready to point to the beauties of 
 Durham, that was not a pleasant scene,
 but it is changing due mainly to the  
 demise of coal-mining.                
 Understanding the basic landscape, and
 its subsequent alteration to what we  
 see now, requires some examination of 
 local geology. Set twixt the Pennines 
 &amp; the Mag-limestone hills of E.Durham,
 here folding/wearing of carboniferous 
 sediments has led to the outcroping of
 coal measures, including sandstone,   
 limestone, and shales, thus producing 
 the characteristic heavy clay soil _  
 mixed with some glacial rubbles.      </content>
