		<content> A fine view of the landscape of this  
 area can be gained from the footpaths 
 east of Cranfield in the vicinity of  
 Marston Thrift or from Wood End,      
 Cranfield which are located on the    
 ridge of boulder clay which runs north
 - south through the area.The land     
 falls away to the flat - bottomed     
 Oxford Clay Vale through which the    
 A421 runs between Bedford and the M1  
 via Marston Moretaine.Bedford and the 
 chimneys at Stewartby brick works are 
 clearly visible down the vale.The clay
 pits are the dominant feature in the  
 vale, originally dug to serve the now 
 defunct Ridgmont brickworks and       
 currently being filled with domestic  
 waste.Some poplar trees are evident,  
 planted as screening for the pits     
 along the roadside.A full restoration 
 scheme has been approved which        
 includes landscaping proposals.       </content>
