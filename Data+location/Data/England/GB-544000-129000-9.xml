		<title>09CAR-PARKS ON ASHDOWN FOREST</title>
		<content> Beside the roads across the Forest are
 several well-maintained car-parks,    
 mostly sited at high points from which
 extensive views can be enjoyed.       
 Clearly marked with rustic signs, two 
 of the largest are Gills Lap and      
 King's Standing, named after the      
 nearby pine-clumps. Wooden poles      
 prevent cars from driving beyond the  
 car-park limits. The plastic litter   
 bins, recently introduced by the      
 Wealden District Council, are con-    
 cealed in miniature log cabins and    
 most drivers are careful to use them, 
 though some still throw litter on the 
 ground. In almost any weather there   
 will be ice-cream vans in the larger  
 car-parks, taking up to Â£200 on a fine
 day at a week-end, when there will    
 probably be over 100 cars around at   
 any one time.                         
                                       </content>
