		<title>03Dairy Farming ...Marchwood</title>
		<content>{There are several dairy farms}in the  
 area.Dairy farming is the main form of
 agriculture.In one typical farm, the  
 dairy herd consists of 120 cows which 
 are mostly Friesians.This breed gives 
 the most milk.Calves are reared on the
 farm....normally about 25 each        
 year.The cows are usually milked for  
 about 305 days each year, and are     
 given 60 days rest before their next  
 calf.The cows are fed in the winter on
 silage made from grass grown on the   
 farm the previous summer.Up to 5000   
 bales of hay are also made.The cows   
 graze over about an acre a day in the 
 summer.They are milked twice a day..at
 5.30am and 3.30pm.The milk is         
 collected in a bulk tanker and sent to
 the Unigate Dairies in Southampton.
