		<content>{       }The people we spoke to were   
 high in their praise for the Community
 Centre which is used a great deal by  
 many groups in Parbold. It is used by 
 the Youth Club, the Women's Institute,
 the Parbold and Newburgh Garden       
 Society, the Mother and Toddlers      
 Group, and various sporting clubs such
 as Badminton, Judo, Gymnastics, and   
 Bridge. Bingo is also played there.   
          There are also educational   
 classes being conducted at the Centre 
 in Arts and Crafts and Local History. 
 In fact, so many people are using this
 facility that there is a move to      
 obtain planning permission to extend  
 the centre to meet the needs of the   
 area.
