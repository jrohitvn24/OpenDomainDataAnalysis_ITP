		<title>12The Walton Gala</title>
		<content>   The north east of our area contains 
 a part of the village of Walton.  Like
 many of the villages in the area it   
 has been surrounded by expensive      
 houses and yet has managed to maintain
 many of its traditions.  One such     
 tradition is the Annual Walton Gala.  
 We sent along some of our form to     
 report on this popular local event.   
   Like most village galas it started  
 with a procession through the village.
 The custom is for the Gala Queen to   
 lead the procession through the       
 village on a horse drawn carriage.    
 This year Julie Scollan who is in the 
 first year at our school was Gala     
 Queen.                                
   Apart from the usual stalls there   
 was a majorette display, a raft race  
 and a "Brain of Walton Competition.All
 proceeds from this enjoyable event    
 will go to the Walton Community Centre</content>
