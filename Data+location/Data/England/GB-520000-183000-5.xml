		<content> Taking Gladstone Park School as the   
 central point, the surrounding roads  
 were surveyed to try to find the      
 quietest and busiest roads.           
     {ROADS        TIMES       NUMBERS 
 Geary     Road  1400-1410        8    
 Helena    Road  1400-1410        2    
 Lechmere  Road  1420-1430        4    
 Walm      Lane  1100-1110       98    
 Willesden Hg Rd 1100-1110      176    
 85 of these were{industrial.}We think 
 that this was due to the building of a
 new supermarket on the High Road. We  
 also did a traffic count for Sherrick 
 Green Road as this is the school road.
 From{0850-0900}126 vehicles passed    
 whilst 76 passed from{0930-0940.}We   
 thought that the counts were very high
 considering it is a built-up area.This
 might be explained by the fact that   
 many children come by car and people  
 use this road to avoid the High Road. </content>
