		<content> St.Andrew's Church was built in the   
 10th century about 50 years before the
 Norman Conquest.It is built mainly of 
 flint with a lead roof. The Chancel   
 was rebuilt in 1845 for the price of  
 Â£800.It was built in 15th century     
 style with an open roof, plastered    
 walls and a tiled floor.In 1585 the   
 first bell was re-cast and by the end 
 of the 17th century there were two    
 other bells.                          
 At the East end of the South aisle is 
 the 'Walker' two manual and pedal     
 organ built in 1880 and noted for its 
 sweet and mellow tone.                
 The Tower, which was rebuilt in 1704, 
 is in three stages. There are now five
 bells which are rung from ground      
 level.
