		<title>13DEEPING ST.JAMES DOG KENNELS</title>
		<content>   The dog kennels were established    
 about 16 years ago.Before that it was 
 the station hotel owned by the Watney 
 Mann Brewery,and before that it was   
 the Manor of Deeping Wake.The owner   
 said he has only got records going    
 back to 1806 although the building    
 seems to be much older than that.     
   The Joseter kennels are well known  
 for breeding cardigan corgies.The     
 owner has had them since he was young 
 and likes them because they have a pl-
 easant temperament. Cardigan Corgies  
 come in different shades such as red  
 and white, red brindle, brindle and   
 white, black and white, sable,blue    
 merle, and tricolour. At the Joseter  
 kennels they also breed four other    
 types of dogs. They are Bichon Frise, 
 Boston Terriers,Welsh Corgies,and     
 Boxers.
