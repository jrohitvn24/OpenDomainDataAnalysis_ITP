   Wood End is a Junior and Infants    
 School built in 1965 on 6-7 acres.    
 There are 200 pupils who are taught in
 classes of 25-36, with 7 classes in   
 all.  The school has 7 full-time and 1
 part-time teacher. The pupils only    
 leave their classroom for physical    
 education and music lessons.          
   The pupils wear a uniform and the   
 school day begins at 8.50 am and      
 finishes at 3.30 pm.  There are       
 frequently clubs held after school.   
 Each year all the older pupils are    
 taken to Wales for a few days and     
 other local day trips are taken.      
   The school is built mainly of wood, 
 glass and brick and as it is not      
 double glazed, is very expensive      
 to heat.  Two years ago the oil       
 central heating was converted to gas  
 to try to be more economical.         </content>
