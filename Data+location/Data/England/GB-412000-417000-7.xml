 The Infirmary was opened in 1963 in   
 place of the old infirmary in New     
 North Road.  It covers 23 acres of    
 ground.  It employes 13OO staff       
 excluding 6O students, medical doctors
 and 4O consultants.  There are 534    
 beds and 22 wards in the buildings.   
 There are also 9 theatres.            
 Since the closing down of the Princess
 Royal Maternity Hospital, the         
 Infirmary has had alterations and     
 extensions to extend their maternity  
 building and all maternity cases now  
 go to the Infirmary.  It also has a   
 new maternity outpatients clinic.     
 It is the largest of seven hospitals  
 in the Huddersfield area and the only 
 one to receive accidents and          
 emergencies.
