		<title>20The Abbey Church.</title>
		<content>  The Abbey Church seats 800 plus 85   
 monks in the choir stalls. The crypt  
 has many chapels. The design is       
 stark throughout the Church and the   
 only relief is  in the choir. Various 
 types of stone have been used inside  
 and outside. The choir section on the 
 outside is faced with{Bramley Fall}   
 stone and the inside with{Blue Horton}
 stone. The rest of the Church is      
 externally faced with{Dunhouse}stone. 
 The church includes the splendid high 
 altar built by Giles Scott. The wooden
 furnishings especially in the choir of
 the Abbey have been made by{Thompson  
{of Kilburn}whose trademark is a carved
 mouse.                                
  A tile on the south side of the Abbey
 shows the link between the modern     
 Ampleforth Benedictine Community and  
 the original Westminster one.
