		<title>10Size of Families</title>
		<content>We carried out a survey in our school  
to find out how big families are in    
this area.                             
All the children had one mum, some had 
two because their dad had remarried    
and they lived with him. The children  
had from 1 to 4 fathers. Most of them  
only had one or two dads, that had     
lived with them since they were born.  
The average size of a family is 6      
including mum and dad. Some children   
came from big families, one family     
had 11 members. Other families are     
small ,only 3 members.Some children    
had other people living in their       
homes, like nans, uncles and aunties,  
and friends of the family.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
