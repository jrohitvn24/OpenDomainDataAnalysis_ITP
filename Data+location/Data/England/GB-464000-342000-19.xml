        ECOLOGY - RIVER TRENT          
                                       
  The River Trent cuts right through   
 our area and is still a working river 
 and ,as such, an important waterway.It
 is roughly 50m wide and slow flowing, 
 it meanders in places.At Stoke        
 Bardolph they despatch treated sewage 
 into the river.Lots of people use the 
 river for fishing and boating.The land
 around the Trent is used for growing  
 crops and the flood meadows are used  
 for grazing.                          
  In Gunthorpe on the banks of the     
 river there is a gravel pit.          </content>
