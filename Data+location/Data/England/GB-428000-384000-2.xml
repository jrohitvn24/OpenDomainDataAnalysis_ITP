		<content>  Lodge Moor Hospital dominates the    
 north_eastern corner of the block,    
 with buildings and grounds covering an
 area of half a square kilometre.      
 Originally a fever hospital built in  
 the nineteenth century, it still      
 operates under the aegis of the Trent 
 Health Authority and provides         
 employment for over 300 people.       
 Lately it has become a specialist unit
 for treatment of spinal injuries, on a
 par with, though not as widely known  
 as Stoke Mandeville Hospital. Its     
 helicopter pad is regularly utilised  
 to transport chronically ill patients.
  The land gradually rises to the north
 and west until it dramatically falls  
 away into Rivelin Valley, occupied by 
 the River Rivelin and the Redmires    
 Dams, built between 1850 and 1870 to  
 provide drinking water for the        
 fast-expanding steel city of Sheffeild</content>
