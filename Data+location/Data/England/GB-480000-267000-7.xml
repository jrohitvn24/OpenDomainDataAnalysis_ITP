		<title>07The Old School</title>
		<content>The old school is built of             
Northamptonshire sandstone. It is      
situated in the old village next to    
the Church and by the side of the      
village green. It was left to the      
village by Mrs. Dickson. There was     
only one teacher, and it consisted of  
one classroom and a little cloakroom.  
In March 1940, there were 26 children  
on roll. The children used to do       
Maypole dancing on the village green   
outside the School. In 1964, the new   
school was  built. There is now a      
group of people in the village who     
hope to turn the old school into a     
village hall to be used for meetings,  
parties, and discos. In 1985, it is    
hoped to restore this listed building  
with the aid of funds and grants.      
Joined onto the old school is what was 
formerly the School House. It is still 
lived in, but not by teaching staff.   </content>
