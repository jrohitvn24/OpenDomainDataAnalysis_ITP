		<title>15The Police Station</title>
		<content> The Police Station is on{London Road} 
 beside the petrol station. It was     
 modernised in 1975 and has a notice   
 board just outside it showing how you 
 can keep your house protected from    
 robbers.                              
 Inside the Police Station there are   
 three{cells:}one for women and two for
 men. Inside the cells have a toilet, a
 bed and three blankets. The door in   
 the corridor is safely locked so if a 
 prisoner gets out of a cell he has to 
 get past the door aswell.             
 There are{six policemen}altogether.   
 Five of them are on patrol: two in a  
 car and three walking around the      
 streets. One is on duty in the Police 
 Station. The Police have{three cars   
 altogether.                           
 The policemen do not carry any{guns   
 with them unless it is an emergency.
