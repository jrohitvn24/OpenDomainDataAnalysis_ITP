		<content>  There is no large scale industrial   
 development in the area which is      
 predominantly residential. There is a 
 selection of small industrial estates 
 with mainly low rise buildings which  
 are generally well planned and        
 pleasant to look at.                  
 The Willow Lane Estate is built in the
 the valley of the River Wandle and has
 industries which make use of the      
 proximity of water.Many of the nearly 
 fifty firms are concerned with        
 engineering in all shpes and sizes.   
 There is a small estate near Wrythe   
 Green which contains engineering      
 works, storage areas together with    
 builders and wood yards.              
 The small estate at Hackbridge also   
 contains engineering works and the    
 offices of S.G.B.(Scaffolding Great   
 Britain).
