		<title>03Trees and Stone_Charnwood</title>
		<content> There are very few signs now of the   
 former oakwoods but about a fifth of  
 the area is covered by small woods and
 spinneys of mixed or coniferous trees 
 mainly in the southern and eastern    
 sections_some commercial,some in      
 nature reserves,some in characteristic
 clumps on the rocky summits of hills. 
 In the valleys,roads are lined with   
 oak holly and rowan.Walls of local    
 stone are a feature round the 5 to 10 
 acre fields.The buildings which are   
 scattered singly over the fields are  
 almost all of local materials.Since   
 the Charnian stone is so hard and     
 splintery building takes the form of  
 random rubble with brick dressings    
 round doors and windows with brick    
 stacks for chimneys.Roofs are of local
 blue Swithland slate usually covered  
 with lichens which with the patchy    
 purple and green stone appears sombre.</content>
