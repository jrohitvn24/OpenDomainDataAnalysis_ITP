		<content> WHEN YOU GROW LEEKS YOU SHOULD KEEP   
 THEM IN A GREENHOUSE FOR FIVE MONTHS  
 BEFORE YOU CAN PLANT THEM.THE TRENCH  
 HAS TO BE LEFT OVER WINTER BEFORE YOU 
 PLANT THE LEEKS.AFTER YOU HAVE PLANTED
 THE LEEKS YOU HAVE TO WATER THEM EVERY
 DAY UNTIL OCTOBER.WHEN IT IS OCTOBER  
 YOU TAKE YOUR LEEKS OUT OF THE TRENCH 
 AND YOU HAVE TO WASH YOUR LEEKS BEFORE
 ENTERING THE LEEK SHOW.IN A LEEK SHOW 
 THEY JUDGE THE BEST CARROTS,          
 ONIONS,CAULIFLOWERS AND CABBAGES AS   
 WELL AS THE BEST LEEK.THE ONE WHO WINS
 THE LEEK SHOW GETS SOME MONEY AND SOME
 PRIZES.THE MAIN THINGS TO DO IS HAVE  
 AND OLD LEEK IN THE GARDEN BECAUSE    
 THAT IS WHERE YOU GET THE YOUNG LEEKS 
 FROM.YOU HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THEM  
 BECAUSE PEOPLE TRY TO DESTROY THEM TO 
 PREVENT YOU FROM WINNING THE PRIZE.
