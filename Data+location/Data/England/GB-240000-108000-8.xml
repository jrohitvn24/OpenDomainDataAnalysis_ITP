		<title>08NORTH HAY FARM</title>
		<content> Seventy-five acres support a family of
 four(with seasonal help).Stock        
 includes dairy and beef cattle, sheep,
 a working dog and a few cats.Five     
 thousand hens will be purchased in    
 July.In 1983 hens were discontinued   
 due to unprofitability.There is no    
 woodland.A copse was cut down for     
 grazing purposes. No trees have been  
 planted since.                        
 Grass is grown for silage and hay.    
 Chemicals are used to control weeds   
 and slurry used as fertilizer.The     
 slurry pit is fenced off.Recently a   
 bullock strayed into it but was       
 extracted with difficulty.            
 Milk is stored in tanks and emptied   
 daily by tankers to be transported to 
 Torrington milk factory.              
 The village sewage plant is on the    
 farm.
