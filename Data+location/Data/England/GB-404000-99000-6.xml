		<content> On the{Tesco's}building site about 150
 employees work, for 60 hours out of a 
 full week. When construction work is  
 finished, there will be ten other     
 shops and a new{library}with a clock  
 tower. There will also be a new       
{community centre}for which Tesco have 
 contributed Â£1/2 million. To make way 
 for the building work, four houses had
 to be demolished, includng the{Guides'
 hut. A deal was made which resulted in
 the Guides' HQ being transferred to   
 newer, better premises.               
 Mr Symonns supplied some statistics:  
{materials used}_ 500,000 face bricks, 
 6,700 cubic metres of reinforced      
 concrete, 85,000 concrete bricks, 600 
 tonnes of metal bars and 275,000 roof 
 tiles; cost _ Â£6.7 million.           
 I enjoyed talking to Mr Symonns. We   
 chatted about other things as well as 
 the building site.                    </content>
