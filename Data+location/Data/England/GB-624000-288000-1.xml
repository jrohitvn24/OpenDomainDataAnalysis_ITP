 modern{conveniences}including         
 telephone &amp; television:all keep a pet.
 Roads are narrow &amp; all homes run at   
 least one car.Though surrounded by    
 farms,there is little local work now; 
 small businesses are flourishing      
 however.Denton is a thriving{village} 
 with a close community spirit illust- 
 rated by the number of organisations  
 &amp; clubs-all well supported.Entertain- 
 ment is mainly locally organised.     
 There is an even age distribution,&amp;   
 quite a few babies have been born     
 recently,which ensures the future of  
 the village in years to come.         </content>
