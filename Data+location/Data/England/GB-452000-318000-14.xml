 using the path,or they might fall and 
 block the brook.                      
      While we were looking at trees I 
 noticed a Blackbird in an old         
 HorseChestnut tree.And there were a   
 couple of Blue Tits by the fence.We   
 saw 2 Starlings and Claire spotted a  
 House Martin.In the brook we saw Trout
 ,Sticlebacks and a Water rat just     
 coming out of its hole.               
      The buildings we saw were Lodge  
 Farm School,the shops near Sandalwood 
 road,the pet shop,the hard ware shop, 
 the grocers and the hair dressers.The 
 Forest gate is a public house and the 
 Holt is a students residence.There    
 were lots of little waterfalls all the
 way along our walk,about 10 if not    
 more.
