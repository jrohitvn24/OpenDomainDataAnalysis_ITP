		<content>      The old mine houses still stood  
 and families still lived in them but  
 the houses were unfit to live in.     
      The{NCB}wanted to demolish the   
 houses but{Lord Hastings}wanted to    
 keep them. The occupants only rented  
 them so they could be evicted at any  
 time. Lord Hastings let them stay.    
      He sent to the Government for an 
 improvement grant. He got five and a  
 half thousand pounds for each house,  
 but the cost was seven thousand       
 pounds.                               
      Lord Hastings sold the houses for
 ten thousand pounds. Then he built    
 some more houses until he made the    
 village as it is today.
