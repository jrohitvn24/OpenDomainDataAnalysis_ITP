		<title>19SCAYNES HILL EVENTS</title>
		<content> In 1924 a fire broke out at the       
 combined bakery/grocery/house/Post    
 Office. A horse drawn appliance from  
 LINDFIELD attended. The cause of the  
 fire was repairs being carried out to 
 the bakery ovens: these were operated 
 by the heat from faggots burning      
 inside the oven.                      
 Scaynes Hill House was the site of an 
 invasion by gypsies. This was actually
 a trick played on the occupants by a  
 well disguised friend of the family...
 The Chief Whip of the government.     
 Scaynes Hill House has just been sold 
 by the owners, a family all of whom   
 are doctors. The father is a brain    
 surgeon;the mother a cancer doctor;the
 daughter a psychiatrist;the son a     
 heart specialist and his wife Dr      
 Alison.
