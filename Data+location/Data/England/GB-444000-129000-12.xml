		<content>{Winchester Railway Station}on the     
 Bournemouth to Waterloo line uses     
 modern technology although it is small
 and old. The signals are computerised 
 and the third rail is electrified.The 
 lines are being welded together to    
 prevent the familiar clicking sound.  
 The station is grubby but British Rail
 is spending Â£64000 to improve it. Two 
 platforms, each 342m., allow for long 
 commuter trains. The station handles  
 5000 passengers a day, most popular   
 destination being London(110km)       
 Southampton (19km). The busiest times 
 are Saturdays in the football season. 
 A franchised{Garage}sold 600 new cars,
 1984, 60% to firms 40% private. 350   
 used also sold. Many people change    
 cars in August. Frequent{bus}services 
 to town centre quite well used. Two   
 car families probably contribute to   
 traffic jams and parking difficulties.</content>
