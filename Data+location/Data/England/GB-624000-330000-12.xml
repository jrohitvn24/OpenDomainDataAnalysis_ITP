		<title>12BACTON GAS TERMINAL</title>
		<content> My dad told me about the place where  
 he works.Bacton Gas Terminal processes
 the gas from all the off shore gas    
 platforms.Each platform has several   
 gas wells.The gas wells are pipes that
 go about 1.5miles beneath the sea be  
 Gas from the platforms flows down 30in
 diameter pipes to Bacton.The platforms
 vary from about 15miles to 70miles    
 from Bacton.At Bacton the gas is      
 refridgerated to about-10degrees F.   
 This removes liquid condensate from   
 the gas and insures that the gas is   
 dry when it enters the National gas   
 pipe network.The condensate is sent to
 an oil refinery where it is converted 
 into solvent such as white            
 spirit,paint thinners,toluene and     
 petrol.Computers are used to control  
 the production of gas.                
 The North Sea Gas industry provides   
 many people with work round here.     </content>
