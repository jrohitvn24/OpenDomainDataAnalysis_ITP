		<title>03LIFEBOAT MEMORIES SWANAGE</title>
		<content>   In 1916 the lifeboat was called the 
 Herbert Sturmey. She was a sailing and
 rowing boat with 12 oars built in the 
 Isle of Wight. In 1928 a new motor    
 boat was used and because she was     
 longer than the previous boat a new   
 slipway had to be built and the       
 lifeboat house was altered.           
   This boat was used right through the
 Second World War although the maroons 
 were not allowed to be let off.       
 Telephones were very limited so the   
 coxswain had to knock men up all over 
 Swanage when they were needed. Then he
 had to get back to the lifeboat. She  
 was not allowed to go to sea until    
 every authority was notified. It was  
 very important to inform the sentries 
 on the cliff when the lifeboat was    
 going to be launched otherwise it     
 might be mistaken for an enemy ship.
