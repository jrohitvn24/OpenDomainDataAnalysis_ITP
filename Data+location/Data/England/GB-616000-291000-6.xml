		<title>06LONG STRATTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Long Stratton has acted as a centre   
 for the surrounding rural area since  
 early mediaeval times. the South      
 Norfolk District Offices stand on the 
 very site of the village settlement   
 established by the Romans in the 1st. 
 century A.D.                          
 The centre of the present village is  
 formed by timber framed houses, many  
 dating from the 16th. and 17th.       
 centuries. These properties reflected 
 the agricultural prosperity which the 
 village shared with the surrounding   
 countryside. The Georgian Manor House 
 unfortunately fell into disrepair and 
 gave way to residential development.  
 However, its Ice House still remains  
 and can be seen at the northern end of
 the shopping precint. It is now a     
 listed ancient memorial.
