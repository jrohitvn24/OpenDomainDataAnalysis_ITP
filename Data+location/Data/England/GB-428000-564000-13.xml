		<title>13ANTIQUES BY THE TYNE</title>
		<content> In the{Royal Industrial Estate}east of
 Banks of the Tyne, we discovered a    
 unit in which 3{craftsmen}restored    
 furniture (Mr Taylor, Mr Zuckerman and
 Mr Young).  One of the{antiques}was an
 eight feet tall grandfather clock.  It
 was made in the early 1800's.  Mr     
 Zuckerman was mending a chair.  He was
 putting horse hair and cloth on and   
 stitching it down a special way.      
 Mr Taylor told us the firm received   
 work from one end of Britain to the   
 other.  One job he was busy with was  
 for a man from Jersey.  A difficulty, 
 said Mr Zuckerman, was finding young  
 persons who were prepared to patiently
 learn the required skills of antique  
 restoration, to keep the craft alive. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
