		<content>   The other village in our area is    
 Hodthorpe which is less than half     
 the size of Whitwell.The population of
 Hodthorpe has remained static in the  
 last ten years. There is only one     
 public house which is a Working Mens  
 Club Hodthorpe was built at the same  
 time as the pit was.Most of the land  
 in Hodthorpe belonged to Welbeck      
 Abbey. The facilities in Hodthorpe    
 have declined in the past thirty      
 years, as there used to be six General
 Stores and now there is only one shop 
 and a Post Office. Unlike Whitwell    
 which has much modern development,    
 there has been little recent building 
 in Hodthorpe.There is a certain amount
 of rivalry between two villages,and   
 both like to retain their identity.   
     The other settlement in the grid  
 is at Belph where there is a group of 
 six cottages.                         </content>
