		<title>13FIRST YEAR AT GRAMMAR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  {"Hoyle Road School,}built in 1909,  
 was originally a place where there    
 were Pierrot Shows. For 7 years it has
 been used as an annexe for first year 
 pupils of West Kirby Grammar School.  
                                       
   The worst things about Hoyle Road   
 are the outside toilets and having to 
 walk along the prom, in all weathers, 
 to dinner. There are no fields to play
 on, so when we play tennis, we have to
 cross the road to the public courts.  
                                       
    There are 24 rooms including the   
 staffroom, office and sick bay.       
                                       
    This annexe closes on 17th July    
 1985 and I don't know what will happen
 to the building after we have gone.   
 They might use it for a youth club or 
 a night school."
