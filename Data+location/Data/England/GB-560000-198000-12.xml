		<content>    We went to visit Mr. Gaymer who    
 lives at Dunsteads and owns a medium  
 sized farm. His farm covers about     
 11000 acres and is about average for  
 our area. Most of the farms are arable
 rather than dairy. He grows mostly    
 winter barley, winter wheat and summer
 barley.                               
    Rape is also grown as a side crop  
 after three years to retain the       
 moisture in the earth. Peas are also  
 grown for the same purpose.           
    Fertilizers are used to kill the   
 weeds: sometimes chemicals can destroy
 the crops as well if a spray system on
 the back of a tractor stops and an    
 excessive amount of chemical floods   
 out. Pigeons can be a nuiscance when  
 they land on the side of rape fields  
 and pull the stems from the roots.    
    The fields have been enlarged by   
 removing the ditches and hedgerows.   </content>
