		<title>16WILD FLOWER SURVEY</title>
		<content>  Since our area contained some common 
 land we decided to compare the number 
 of species of wild flowers growing on 
 the common land with the number       
 growing on the more intesively farmed 
 or utilised land.                     
  The farmland is sprayed where the    
 crops grow and the woodland is managed
 to rear pheasants and deer for sport. 
 The common land is not interfered with
 in this way, and is a combination of  
 woodland and rough grassland.         
  We were not altogether surprised     
 to find a total of 44 different       
 varieties of flowers growing on       
 Leckhampton Common compared with only 
 17 elsewhere in our area which had    
 been treated in  various ways.
