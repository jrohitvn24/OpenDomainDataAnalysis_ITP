		<content> Ryhill and Havercroft are two         
 mining villages-population 4000       
 -which grew up around collieries now  
 closed.There are also the hamlets of  
 Cold Hiendley and Wintersett.Mining is
 still the dominant economic activity. 
 Extensive reclamation work will result
 in re-instatement of agricultural land
 and creation of a new country park    
 including a sizeable lake.Two existing
 reservoirs provide sailing and fishing
 facilities for the public.A further   
 lake,part of a private club,is used   
 periodically for public water sports  
 activities in addition to members'    
 use.The Barnsley Canal,now disused,   
 runs through an attractive part of the
 area.Long stretches retain water and a
 local restoration group has been      
 formed.There are extensive Forestry   
 Commission woodlands and some good    
 agricultural land.                    </content>
