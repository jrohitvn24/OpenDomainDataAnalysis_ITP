   Guernsey has a tiered housing       
 system. The 'local' market is open to 
 those born in the island and those who
 satisfy residential qualifications.   
 These can be marriage to an island    
 born person or having been resident   
 for a period of fifteen years. Housing
 licences can be granted to enable     
 non-locals to live in local market    
 property. To qualify, one must be     
 deemed an essential worker and for    
 there to be no local applicant        
 suitable for the job. A licence holder
 must inhabit a house with a rateable  
 value exceeding Â£45. The 'open' market
 is available to all purchasers. Homes 
 on this market tend to exceed a price 
 of Â£80,000. If a local person         
 purchases a home in this market, they 
 forfeit their local resident status.  </content>
