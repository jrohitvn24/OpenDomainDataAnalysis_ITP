		<title>07SHALLOWFORD RETREAT CENTRE</title>
		<content> A benefactor gave Shallowford House to
 the Diocese of Lichfield in 1938, to  
 be used as a Diocesan Retreat Centre. 
 In 1973 it was modernised and can now 
 accommodate up to 39 people.  It is   
 mainly intended as a centre to which  
 clergy and laity may come in groups   
 for relaxation, renewal and study.    
 The house is also equipped for        
 conferences, parish weekends or       
 meetings.  Non-diocesan groups, too,  
 may use the facilities.  The lounge   
 and library are the two main meeting  
 rooms.  The Priest from nearby Chebsey
 regularly conducts a service in the   
 Chapel.  Upstairs, the Diocesan       
 Education Office has a Resources      
 Centre.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
