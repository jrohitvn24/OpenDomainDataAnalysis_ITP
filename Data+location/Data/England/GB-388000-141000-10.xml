		<title>10DAIRY FARMING IN SUTTON VENY</title>
		<content>   My Dad owns Long Ivor Farm .  His   
 brother and Dad help on the farm.     
 There are seventy cows which are      
 milked every morning at about 6       
 o'clock and in the afternoon at about 
 3 o'clock.  Some of our cows have     
 calves which are fed by their mothers 
 for about three days, then they have  
 powdered milk and are put into pens.  
 then they have weaning cake and then  
 hay. After about a month they go      
 out to an orchard where they eat      
 grass.  When they are fat enough they 
 are taken to market and are usually   
 sold for beef.                        
                                       
   We also have hens that lay eggs and 
 they have to be collected every day.  
 We own eight cats that catch the rats 
 and mice that eat the corn that the   
 cows eat.                             
                                       </content>
