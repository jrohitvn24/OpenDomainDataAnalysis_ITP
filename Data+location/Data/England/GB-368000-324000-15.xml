		<title>15CAROL'S LAMB</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
  I live on a farm in Hinstock.        
 My dad's friend knows Lord Shrewsbury 
 and he has a lot of sheep and lambs.  
 My dad asked Roy to look for a lamb.  
 Then one Tuesday he brOUGHT a lamb.   
 When we had her I think she was 2 days
 old.                                  
 The first time we stroked her coat it 
 was tough and rough. Then when we went
 to see her she was covered in a bunch 
 of prickles, blackberry leaves,sticks,
 and goose grass all over her head.    
 When it first rained on her I put a   
 cover over her but dad said don't     
 because it will make her ill and that 
 she's got oils in her wool to stop it 
 going to her skin.                    
 I love my lamb very much though she   
 can be a pest sometimes.
