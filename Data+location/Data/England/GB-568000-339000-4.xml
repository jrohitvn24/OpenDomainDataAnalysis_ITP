		<content>  Oldest housing is commonly small two-
 storey cottages with larger farmhouses
 built of Carrstone,a brown sandstone  
 quarried locally,with roofs of Norfolk
 pantiles.many are over 100 years old  
 having been altered at intervals.Most 
 are grouped in the village,some farms 
 are isolated.Some newer houses(1900-  
 1940) are mostly of brick.            
  Since 1945 growth has been more rapid
 Some houses built by local authoity to
 rent are in brick and designed for    
 economy rather than appearance.Others 
 recently built are in traditional     
 style in Carrstone,in the village a   
 few incorporate flint facing which,   
 though rare in Ringstead,is widespread
 along the north Norfolk coast.        
 A windmill and outbuildings of        
 Hunstanton hall (built 1490-1880) have
 have converted into dwellings.The hall
 though fire-damaged is partly occupied</content>
