   Forty years after the end of the    
Second World War, very little of the   
airfield remains and the land is farmed
again. One runway has been removed and 
planted with poplar trees and the other
runways are much narrower. The         
perimeter track is still intact. Three 
hangers have had their sides           
strengthened and have become grain     
stores. They each hold 10,000 tons of  
grain for the European Economic        
Community. The hangers are filled using
a mobile grain elevator. There is also 
a weigh-bridge for lorries which       
transport grain. Grain is stored here  
from within a radius of 75 miles. There
is a site for gypsies on the airfield. 
In April of this year the C.N.D        
protesters from Molesworth tried to    
settle here in "Rainbow Village" but   
they were moved on.                    </content>
