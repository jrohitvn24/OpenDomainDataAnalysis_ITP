		<title>14THE OLD HOUSE-TIMBER FRAMED</title>
		<content>{The Old House}is a timber framed house
 on the High Street, from Turners Hill 
 to Handcross. The centre of the house 
 was once 2 old cottages. The eastern  
 cottage was built first, the western  
 cottage was added 5 years later.In the
 19th century a brick built wing was   
 added to the eastern side, and in the 
 20th century a porch with a room over 
 it was added to the western end. It   
 has 2 main fireplaces. In the east    
 cottage on the{ingle beam}are the     
 letters{T.G. I.G. 1737,}in the west   
 cottage{I.D. 1742.}giving dates of the
 building. The letters T.G,I.G are the 
 initials of the man who owned it,     
 Thomas Gibbs and his wife.In the      
 hearth of the East house are 2 small  
 cupboards and the door of a brick     
 oven. At the front of the house       
 are projections under the chimneys    
 which are the ovens.                  </content>
