 some are holiday cottages.There are   
 few second homes in comparison with   
 other coastal areas.

 council(N.Norfolk District Council)

 stately homes.Older houses are built  
 of local soft red bricks &amp; flints     
 which may be knapped(dressed).Cottages

 small beach flints;roofs are sometimes
