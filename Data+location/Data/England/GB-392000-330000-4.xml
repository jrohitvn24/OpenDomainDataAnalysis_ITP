As a result of the type of farming in  
the area, fields are generally small   
and hedgerows have been maintained     
along the field boundaries.The small   
fields give the farmer flexibility in  
moving his cattle.The hedges and trees 
in them give protection from the wind. 
The hedges also protect and provide a  
route for the ditches which help to    
drain the heavy soil.                  
                                       
Most hedgerows contain a large number  
of species of mature and young trees,  
shrubs and wild flowers and are a sig- 
nificant feature in the landscape.All  
the elm trees have died from Dutch Elm 
Disease and have been replaced by the  
landlords with the help of the County  
Council's Tree replacement Scheme.
