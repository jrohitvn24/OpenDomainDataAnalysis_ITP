  Great Horwood is a small village of  
about 1000 people, which lies about 10 
miles north of {Aylesbury}, the county 
town of Buckinghamshire,and about six  
miles east of Buckingham. To the       
north-east of Great Horwood is the new 
city of{Milton Keynes}and this is      
having an increasingly important impact
on the life of the village. Many       
villagers work in the new city, and it 
is an important centre for shopping and
for leisure activities.                
  The village has changed in           
character.Once it was very rural, most 
of the population was engaged in       
agriculture either as farmers,farm     
labourers or an associated trade.Lace  
making was a common occupation for the 
women.Today most of the working        
population commute to nearby towns or  
as far as London.                      </content>
