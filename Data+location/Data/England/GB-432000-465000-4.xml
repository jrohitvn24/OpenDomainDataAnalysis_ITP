		<content>{Primary}education in the area         
 continues to be centered in the Church
 of England school in the middle of the
 village.   At present there are some  
 74 pupils, 60 odd of whom are from the
 village, the remainder coming from    
 outside the area.   The school has 6  
 governors, 3 full-time and 1 part-time
 teachers, 3 domestic staff and a      
 part-time secretary.   The school     
 works on a Thorn selection system and 
 the {secondary}education of pupils    
 continues at either Ripon Grammar or  
 City schools with parents of some     
 children eligible for the Ripon       
 schools opting to send them to        
 St.Aidens at Harrogate, a church      
 supported school.                     
 There is no {tertiary }education in   
 the area and those eligible for it    
 attend establishments throughout the  
 country.                              </content>
