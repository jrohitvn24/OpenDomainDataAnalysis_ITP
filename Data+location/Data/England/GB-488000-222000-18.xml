		<title>18The Linslade Youth Club</title>
		<content>    Every Tuesday the Linslade Youth   
 Club is held. It is held in a big hall
 in the Community Centre of a large    
 housing estate. Every three weeks     
 there is a disco. On the normal nights
 the head of the youth club gets out   
 two big table tennis boards and a     
 snooker table for us to play on.There 
 are lots of sweets that you can buy   
 there. When the disco takes place it  
 is held on the stage and there are    
 flashing lights and very loud music.  
 When it is warm and sunny when youth  
 club is on, we go out and have a big  
 game of rounders. Sometimes hardly any
 people go and the youth club cannot be
 held. The youth club is on from       
 7.30p.m. until 9.00p.m. The age group 
 is from 10 to 14 years.
