		<content>Lord William, a local nobleman, founded
the school in 1559 to enable the sons  
of local farmers and buisnessmen to    
enter university. School began at 6.00 
a.m. and the boys were taught Latin and
Religion. Discipline was very strict   
and the boys were often beaten with    
canes.                                 
Among the scholars were Mr. Speaker    
Lentall, Bishop Henry, the king of     
Chichester, Sir George Etherege and the
patriot John Hampden. The school       
declined in the 1860's when visitations
by the Warden of New College stopped.  
In 1874 a new governing body was       
constituted and the new school opened  
in 1879. In 1973 the school became a   
mixed comprehensive joining with the   
Wenman school at the other end of town 
and now has the reputation of being one
of the biggest (1800 pupils) and best  
in the country.                        </content>
