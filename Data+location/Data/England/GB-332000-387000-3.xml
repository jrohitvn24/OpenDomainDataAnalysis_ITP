		<title>03LIVING IN TOXTETH</title>
		<content> My name is Carol and I live in        
{Toxteth,}Liverpool 8. People all over 
 the world remember the riots and think
 Toxteth people are bad, and that      
 Toxteth is a terrible place to live,  
 but they are{wrong.}We live in a quiet
 place and our neighbours are very     
 friendly. Our house is quite big and  
 it has been{modernised.}We have three 
 bedrooms and a living room, dinette   
 and kitchen. We have a yard, not a    
 garden. Our house is terraced and     
 opens right onto the street. My dad   
 used to work in a{car factory}but was 
 made redundant. We don't have a car   
 but we have teletext television and a 
 video. I have 2 sisters and 1 brother 
 and we usually get on very well. For  
 our{holidays}we go to a caravan in    
 North Wales or sometimes to a Holiday 
 Camp.                                 
                                       </content>
