{(Cheping)}Hill.Cheping means market.  
 It was on the green by the            
 church.There is a young oak tree on   
 the green.There was one long ago.{King
{Stephen}gave the manor of Witham to   
 the{Knights Templar.}They were brave, 
 strong and tough men who fought in the
 Crusades.Their headquarters was in    
 Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem.        
 They protected pilgrims on the        
 rough and stoney road to Jerusalem.   
 Money made from selling the corn grown
 in Witham paid for this. There are    
 huge barns at Cressing that they built
 to store corn. One of the schools is  
 called Templars, their badge has a    
 knight and a Templars cross on it.    
  Templars were given land in{Newland  
{Street}on their discharge from the    
 Service.
