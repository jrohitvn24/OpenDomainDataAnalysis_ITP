		<title>11BRIGHTON MARINA : PLANNING</title>
		<content> The idea for the marina was proposed  
 by Henry Cohen and plans were drawn up
 in l963. A site at Black Rock was     
 chosen and work began in l97l. The    
 main objectives were to provide a     
{yacht harbour}offering the best       
 facilities in the world, to provide   
 residential accomodation of l,OOO     
{flats}&amp;{houses,}car parking for 6,OOO 
 cars,{shops,}an{hotel}&amp; a{conference  
{centre.}It is now the largest         
 purpose-built marina in Britain and it
 has cost Â£5Om to complete just Phase  
 One.                                  
       By 1979 economic conditions had 
 changed and the secondary development 
 has not taken place. However the      
 marina has been sold to another       
 developer, Brent Walker Ltd. who      
 intend to press ahead with housing,   
 shops &amp; the hotel etc. subject to the 
 necessary planning approvals.         </content>
