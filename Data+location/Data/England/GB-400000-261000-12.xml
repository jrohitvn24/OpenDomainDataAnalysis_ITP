		<content>  The arches separating the lady chaple
 are decorated with patterns  in red   
 and black - ox blood and tar. These   
 were done  by ladies in the Parish,   
 one was the doctors wife, who used to 
 live at the end of the square. In the 
 chancel there are some old tongs used 
 for making communion wafers.They were 
 supposidly found in a tunnel going    
 from the church to the Doctors house. 
  By the altar is a carved chair that  
 only the Bishop may sit on.           
  There are two old tables which are   
 supposed to be from the original Blue 
 Coat School. The Blue Coat Fund was   
 originally set up as a fund for the   
 poor and orphaned of the parish to    
 receive education and                 
 apprenticeships.The pupils at         
 Feckenham School still receive a Â£50  
 grant from the fund when they leave   
 for middle school at the age of nine. </content>
