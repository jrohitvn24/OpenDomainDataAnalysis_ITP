		<content> have mental &amp; spelling tests until    
 playtime at 10.30. Playtime lasts     
 until 10.45. After play we have       
 English until 12.00, when we have     
 dinner &amp; playtime until 1.15. Then its
 time to go for our swimming lessons at
 Barnard Castle which takes about 15   
 minutes . When we get there we get    
 changed &amp; sit around the side of the  
 bath, then Mrs White tells us to do   
 our six widths. We line up in our     
 groups &amp; Mrs White says 'no. 1'&amp; no.  
 1 goes,then no. 2 and so on. We get   
 back from swimming at 2.45. Our last  
 lesson is finishing off where you     
 finish off anything you haven't done  
 during the week. On a Friday night I  
 go to Bishop Auckland Gym Club. I do  
 gymnastics  and tumbling with Mr      
 Smith. On the way home we stop to get 
 fish &amp; chips. I like Fridays because  
 there's no school fot two days.       </content>
