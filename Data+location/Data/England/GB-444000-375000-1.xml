		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The area consists of three villages,  
{Mastin Moor,Barlborough and Renishaw  
 surrounded by open farmland.The       
 farmland is mainly grassland although 
 a few fields are cultivated.Of the    
 three villages Mastin Moor and        
 Renishaw are similar being mainly just
 large housing estates while           
 Barlborough has a great variety of    
 housing from different periods of its 
 long history. All three villages have 
 their roots in the mining industry    
 although Barlborough's go much furher 
 back, as far as the last Domesday Book
 which has an entry for Barlborough.
