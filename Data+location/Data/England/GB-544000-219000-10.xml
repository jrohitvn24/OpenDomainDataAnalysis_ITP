		<title>10  TRANSPORT IN THORLEY</title>
		<content>                                       
Most residents of this suburb rely on  
their own means of transport.Families  
have 1 or 2 cars &amp; use them for long &amp; 
short journeys.Although there is a     
public bus service through the estate  
it is infrequent &amp; the only proper     
stop is at the shopping centre.        
Elsewhere the driver stops on          
request.Many residents, particularily  
mothers pushing prams,are worried      
about having to walk around on the     
road verges because some areas have no 
pavement.A few ride bicycles buth      
this can be dangerous due to the speed 
of traffic on the through roads.       
Residents agree that a by-pass is      
needed for the west of Stortford to    
link up with the existing northern one 
at the A120 roundabout.
