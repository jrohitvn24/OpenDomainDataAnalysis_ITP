		<content> Kingston St.Mary is a small village at
 the foot of the Quantock Hills about  
 three miles from Taunton. The parish  
 church has a fine tower and inside    
 there are some sixteenth century      
 bench-ends. The manor house is early  
 eighteenth century. To the north of   
 the village the hills rise steeply; to
 the south is the level vale of Taunton
 Deane. The wooded hills are popular   
 with walkers and cyclists.            
 There is no industry in the village,  
 but there are tomato and vegetable    
 growers to the south. Many of the     
 residents work in Taunton. It is also 
 a popular retirement area.            
 Just over a hundred years ago there   
 were copper mines in the area and some
 local place-names bear witness to     
 this.
