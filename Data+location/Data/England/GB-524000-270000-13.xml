		<title>13CRIMES IN HUNTINGDON.</title>
		<content> The majority of crimes are committed  
 in daylight and are mainly theft.     
 There are three main kinds of thefts. 
 In 1984, 294  were house thefts, 843  
 shop thefts,510 factory thefts.In one 
 theft a man stole 50 pairs of trousers
 and nobody noticed him.Other crimes   
 include traffic offences,theft from   
 cars and car theft.On average one car 
 is stolen each week.                  
   Many crimes are difficult to solve  
 and many questions have to be asked by
 the police attending a crime.Often a  
 scene of crime officer and a finger   
 print expert visit the scene of the   
 crime looking for clues and           
 information.If a criminal is caught he
 is sent to court and usually fined or 
 sent to prison.
