		<title>11The Gayton Post Office</title>
		<content>                                       
The Post Office in Gayton is the only  
shop in the village. It is situated in 
the kitchen of a private house in the  
High Street. Because it is the only    
shop it sells greetings cards,         
wrapping paper and other stationary.   
It also serves as a community "notice  
board", informing villagers of local   
events and services. The postmistress  
says that during a normal week at      
least one member of each family will   
make a visit.                          
53 Retirement pensions are paid out    
each week (population 520).            
50 pounds worth of postage stamps are  
sold each week.                        
The most popular stamp is the 17p      
first class letter stamp.              
One thousand pounds is paid into the   
post office each week and four         
thousand pounds is taken out.          </content>
