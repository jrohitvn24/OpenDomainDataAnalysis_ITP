		<title>13BULL TESTING STATION 1</title>
		<content> At Mitchmore Farm, between Dinedor and
 Holme Lacy  just south of Dinedor Mill
 (which we think is the Mill mentioned 
 in the first Domesday Survey), is the 
{Bull Testing Station.  }There are only
{3 such stations in Britain,}run by the
{Meat and Livestock Commission.  }Only 
 farmers who belong to the Livestock   
 Commission Pedigree Scheme can send   
 their animals here.  They send them to
 get an{accurate assessment of how     
 their{animals put on weight}so that   
 they know how best to breed from them 
 and other farmers know what they are  
 buying.   Every month a new lot of    
 bulls aged about{5 or 6 months}comes  
 in, and they stay for{7 months.  }It  
 costs a farmer{Â£400}to have each of   
 his bulls assessed.   There are 9     
 acres, with 4 big pens and 8 paddocks,
 run by a manager, 2 stockmen, and 2   
 part-time stockmen.                   </content>
