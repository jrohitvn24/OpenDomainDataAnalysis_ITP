		<content>  We visited an Old People's Home which
 was built in 1968 and modernised more 
 recently.It has 24 bedrooms, 17 of    
 which are occupied individually by 4  
 men and 13 women.In the morning the   
 staff bring everyone a cup of tea at  
 7a.m.and they all get up for breakfast
 at 8.30a.m. Lunch is at 12.30p.m.     
 (which is earlier than we have it),   
 followed by a cup of tea at 3p.m.and  
 high tea at 5p.m.The Home is in a     
 beautiful house, which used to be a   
 hotel.Some of the old ladies who were 
 talking to us showed us their own     
 bedrooms and we were struck by the    
 lovely furniture they each had. Most  
 of the people we met were over 80 and 
 one of the men was blind. They cannot 
 keep their own pets but there were    
 small birds and tanks of fish about   
 the building. They always enjoy seeing
 visitors.                             </content>
