		<title>12STUART'S ROOM. AGED 11</title>
		<content>  I share my room with my brother. We  
 have bunk beds in the corner of the   
 room, next to the cupboard. In the    
 other corner there is a large box, to 
 make headroom for the stairs. On top  
 of the box we have a television set, a
 wooden play fort and a telescope. On  
 the window sill is an ornamental{Loch 
{Ness Monster}and 5 rubber dinosaurs. I
 have an old open fire-place which is  
 not in use anymore. It has an         
 alarm-clock and a fluffy owl that my  
 grandma made me on it.                
  I have 2 bookcases full of books.    
 There are also 2 wardrobes, one for my
 mum and one for my dad, brother and   
 me. The room is painted green and the 
 carpet is brown with a leaf pattern on
 it. I also have posters and stickers  
 on my walls and door.
