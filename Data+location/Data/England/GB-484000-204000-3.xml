 Beech trees predominate here though   
 the woodland is mixed Ash, Sycamore,  
 Holly, Elm and Wild Cherry. Many of   
 the Beeches are now nearing the end of
 thier natural life (150yrs) and each  
 winter brings more casualties. They   
 are also beset by honey fungus, a     
 fatal disease. There is an example of 
 a planted Beech avenue from Boswell's 
 Farm to the A413 Wendover/ Amersham   
 road. The sunken track from the now   
 disused Leather Bottle pub is bordered
 by mature Holly trees and the lane    
 from Smalldean Farm has 3 full_grown  
 Copper Beeches in the hedgerow. There 
 are a few HorseChestnuts and a few Oak
 trees in the clay on the top of Coombe
 Hill. The grounds of Chequers Court   
 contain many different species; there 
 is a tradition that each P.M. plants a
 new species.                          </content>
