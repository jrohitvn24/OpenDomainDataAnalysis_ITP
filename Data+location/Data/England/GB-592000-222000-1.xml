		<title>01THE STANWAY COPFORD AREA</title>
		<content>  This area, on the{western outskirts  
{of Colchester}bounded by the A12 in   
 the nortf and the Roman river in the  
 South, contains both modern and       
 treditional features of{rural Essex.  
 The settlements,{Copford and Stanway  
 predate Roman times with examples of  
 Celtic dykes and later medieval and   
 Tudor architecture as well as modern  
 housing and industrial estates. Ther  
 is a large area of abandoned opencast 
 workings currently being reclaimed for
 industrial and residetial use.        
{ Arable farmscape predominates}as yet 
 but sand and gravel workings and urban
 'sprawl' are rapidly modifying the    
 area. It's proximity to main lines of 
 communication make it an attractive   
{development area}with schools,        
 community centres,shopping and service
 facilities within walking distance of 
 the beautiful Essex countryside.      </content>
