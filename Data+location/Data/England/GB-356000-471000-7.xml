   Farms in this area rear mainly sheep
or cows or both. The natural grass has 
been regularly re-seeded in some fields
to improve the quality. Some farmers   
have given up milk cows altogether be- 
cause of milk quotas. The milk cows are
Friesians and  Aberdeen Angus are beef 
cows which are sold at auction in Lan- 
caster or Bentham.                     
   Normally sheep are kept outdoors    
all the year round and shorn in Spring,
but one large farm winters about 450   
sheep indoors,in an enormous shed,     
until after lambing. They shear them   
in December to prevent illness caused  
by sweating. In the past there were    
several varieties of sheep but nowadays
mules are very popular. They are a     
cross between Swaledale and Hexham or  
Blueface/Leicester. Goats are kept in  
Arkholme and their produce sold.       </content>
