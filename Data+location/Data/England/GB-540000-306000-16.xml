		<title>16VILLAGE POSTOFFICE</title>
		<content>    A typical day for me would be to   
 get up at 7am. Prepare breakfast and  
 pack my husbands lunch.               
    At 7.30am I get my daughter Amanda 
 and son Martin up for school.I then   
 make the beds and do more household   
 chores.     At 8.30am I go into the   
 Post Office to prepare for opening at 
 9.00am. Usually I am busy in there all
 morning.                              
    Martin arrives home for his dinner 
 at 12.10. I carry on working until I  
 close the Post Office at 1.00.        
    In my lunch hour I prepare food for
 tea. I reopen Post Office at 2.00 and 
 work until 5.30.                      
    We have tea at about 6.00. I then  
 finish any paper work in Post Office. 
    If weather is good I do gardening  
 or I may watch television.            
    I go to bed at about 11.00 to be   
 ready to start another day.           </content>
