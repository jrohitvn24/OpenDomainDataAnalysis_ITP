		<title>01ST.SAMPSON'S-a general view.</title>
		<content> The area that we have been given to   
 study for the Domesday Project is part
 of the parish of St.Sampson's  in     
 Guernsey. It has a large shopping area
 called 'The Bridge'. There is a       
 coastline which is not sandy at all   
 but it does include a reclamation     
 area. Around the shopping area there  
 is a large harbour area with deep     
 water facilities for large ships which
 offload fuel and heavy cargo. There is
 a lot of light industry and           
 owner-occupied houses. A secondary    
 school and two primary schools are    
 situated in and around a park which   
 has spectacular views over the        
 surrounding islands of the Bailiwick  
 of Guernsey.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
