		<content> About a year ago (1984)there was a    
 road running through Main street in   
 Bulwell. But now there is a road      
 running all around the outside of     
 Bulwell market and the shops. But     
 now the pavement has been made wider  
 and there are benches in the middle   
 of the pavement.The pavement might    
 have been made wider to help the      
 elderly people for shopping in the    
 market. More shops have been opened   
 up because of the number of people    
 down there.Car parks have been made   
 for the drivers who come down the     
 road to go to the market and have     
 nowhere to park.
