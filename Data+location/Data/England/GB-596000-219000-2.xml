 The village was, at one time, a very  
 scattered and fairly small community. 
 In 1950 the population was barely     
 seven hundred, but by 1975 it was over
 one thousand and in 1984 it is not far
 short of two thousand. Despite this   
 large increase,there is only one shop 
 where there were at least three.This  
 is due to the fact that Colchester is 
 only  four miles away.There is,       
 however,  still an unbuilt_up area    
 between Layer_de_la_Haye and          
 Colchester,which allows the village to
 retain its identity.                  
 The name of Layer_de_la_Haye has      
 changed quite a few times.The first   
 known name is from Saxon times_Legra  
 which means a 'lookout'.The old       
 settlement was on top of the hill     
 where the church now stands. This     
 provided an excellent vantage_point   </content>
