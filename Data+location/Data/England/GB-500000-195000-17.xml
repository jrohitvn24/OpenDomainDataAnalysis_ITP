		<title>17Transport in Chorleywood</title>
		<content>We made a questionaire and surveyed 45 
people about where they worked and what
transport they used to get there. We   
foud out that most people worl in      
London and travel by car and train to  
work, while a few who work in          
Chorleywood walk to their employment.  
Of the 45 people 19 worked in London,  
5 in Chorleywood and the rest          
elsewhere. (This compares to the 80    
children in the top two years of the   
Russell School. Only 3 of their parents
worked in Chorleywood, and well over   
half in London).                       
Of the 45 people surveyed it would seem
the busiest morning train is the 7.52am
and in the evening the 6.00pm from     
Baker Street.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
