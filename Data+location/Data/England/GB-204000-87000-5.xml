		<content>{ Trevillet Parc Trout Farm.           
 The Trout Farm is in Rocky Valley and 
 was constructed by building a dam and 
 pools and diverting the water from a  
 stream.This flows through the pools   
 and rejoins the stream near the old   
 Mill House,now a restaurant.          
 Fingaling or fry are bought in to be  
 grown on.They are kept in three ponds 
 and fed on pellets containing protein,
 fatteners and binders.The trout are   
 Rainbow Trout.It takes 1 year to grow 
 them to their correct size for sale,  
 which is 12 ozs.                      
 60% of the sales are at the gate.40%  
 of the trout are sold to hotels and   
 restaurants in an area between Newquay
 and Liskeard.The trout farm has 8000  
 fish.People can go and catch their own
 in a special pond.                    
 The present price per pound is Â£1.30.
