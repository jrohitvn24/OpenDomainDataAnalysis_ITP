		<title>07Interview with Mr.Farmer</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mr Farmer about the    
 years when he used to be a blacksmith.
 He has lived in the village for 35    
 years and was born in Barton in 1912. 
 He became a blacksmith after being an 
 errand boy for a grocer. He noticed   
 the blacksmith shop next door and     
 "watched with interest",and a job came
 up.Other jobs that were available in  
 our village when he came to work here 
 were mainly agricultural.Examples were
 shepherds,stockman,the miller would   
 employ a man, and farm labourers.Most 
 people that lived in Hibaldstow worked
 here, because they had no transport.  
 The only transport available was a    
 carrier (horse and caravan) to the    
 market in Brigg.Sometimes a boat would
 take people from Brandy wharf.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
