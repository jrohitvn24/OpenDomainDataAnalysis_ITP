		<title>08         FARMING</title>
		<content>  The farms in this area are small     
 ones. The main type of farming is     
 dairy though some farmers are         
 beginning to change. A milk tanker    
 collects the milk every day. Most     
 crops are for animal feed. A lot of   
 grass is made into silage and some hay
 is also made. There is a small        
 amount of corn grown and an increaing 
 amount of oil seed rape.              
  Some farmland in the North-west of   
 the block has been lost owing to the  
 building of the dam for the Carsington
 Reservoir. The trees have been cleared
 and now the land is lying bare waiting
 to be flooded. Two farmhouses will be 
 under the water eventually, and a lot 
 of good farmland.                     
  The farms do not employ many workers.
 Some smallholdings are run by people  
 who have other employment as well,    
 others employ mainly family.          </content>
