		<title>02LT.HORKESLEY CHURCH SERVICES</title>
		<content>    There are four services on a       
 Sunday, these are Holy Communion at   
 8am, Childrens' Church at 10am,       
 Mattins at 11am and Evening Song at   
 6:30pm. About 80_100 people attend    
 Little Horkesley Church regularly.The 
 last vicar left on June 2nd 1985.The  
 Archdeacon announced in February that 
 Wormingford and Mount Bures should be 
 amalgamated with the parish of Little 
 Horkesley.The people of Little        
 Horkesley are not happy with this     
 arrangement.The Bishop and the Church 
 Wardens are trying to obtain the      
 services of someone,probably retired, 
 to take charge of the Parish of Lt.   
 Horkesley by the offer of Fishponds   
 (the vicarage) as a residence and a   
 small pension to come from the        
 Brocklebank trust.This situation has  
 not yet been resolved.
