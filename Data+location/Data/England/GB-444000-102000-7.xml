		<content>    At 7.30am I wake up. I get dressed 
 and have my breakfast. I go to Holbury
 School at 8.30am, and we begin working
 after the register. At 10.15am we go  
 outside to play until 10.30am. We have
 assembly until 11.00am. After more    
 work we have lunch and at 1.00pm we   
 begin working again.                  
   Sometimes we have outdoor games. At 
 2.15pm we have play until 2.30pm. I   
 normally play skipping or marbles.    
 Then we work until 3.00 pm and then we
 have a story until hometime which is  
 3.30pm.                               
    I walk home and have a drink and   
 get changed and go out to play. Tea is
 at 5.30pm and after tea I go to       
 Guides. We play rounders and we do    
 other things. At 8.00pm it finshes,   
 and I get home at 8.30pm. I have a    
 bath and get undressed and get to     
 sleep at 10.00pm.                     </content>
