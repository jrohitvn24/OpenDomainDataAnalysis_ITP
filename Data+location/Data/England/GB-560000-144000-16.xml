		<title>16COPPICING CHESTNUT IN CAPEL</title>
		<content> MANY BROADLEAVED TREES ARE USED FOR   
 COPPICING. IN OUR PARISH WE USE SWEET 
 CHESTNUT,IN PAST DAYS OAK,WILLOW,BEECH
 ASH, HORNBEAM AND ALDER WERE USED.    
{NOWADAYS THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TREE
{ARE USED - HAZEL FOR HURDLES,BEAN RODS
{AND THATCH PEGS,SWEET CHESTNUT FOR    
{POLES &amp; FENCING AND WILLOW FOR BASKETS
 THE SWEET CHESTNUT IS CUT TO GROUND   
 LEVEL, THE BRANCHES ARE REMOVED, THE  
 BARK IS STRIPPED AND THE END IS BOILED
 IN TAR TO PREVENT ROTTING,THE TREES   
 THEN START TO GROW AGAIN. IN THE NEXT 
 10 - 15 YEARS THEY CAN BE COPPICED    
 AGAIN.{THE POLES ARE USEFUL IN CAPEL  
{FOR HOP POLES, TREE SUPPORTS, STAKES  
{AND CLEFT FENCING.}SWEET CHESTNUT     
 FENCING IS SENT FROM CAPEL AS FAR AWAY
 AS SCOTLAND.                          
 WIDE PATHS THROUGH THE PLANTATIONS    
 PREVENT FIRE SPREADING. BRISH BROOMS  
 ARE USED FOR FIRE CONTROL.            </content>
