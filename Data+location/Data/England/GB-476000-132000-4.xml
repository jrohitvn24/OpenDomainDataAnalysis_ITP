 extended in the near future.Blackmoor 
 School has it's own tree nursery where
 the children in the top two classes   
 plant many different trees.The        
 headmaster and the children have taken
 an interest in golf so we have got two

 called Mr Gale.The school is in two   
 parts,the 'hut' and the main school.
