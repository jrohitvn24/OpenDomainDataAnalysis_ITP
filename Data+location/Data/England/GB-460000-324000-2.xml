		<content> I have got a game called{frustration  
 which 2-4 people can play. You choose 
 a colour man and you have to knock out
 your opponents men.{Headache}is a     
 similar game.{Yahtzee}is when you have
 five dice and you shake the dice and  
 throw them in a tray.The idea is to   
 get the most points.The one with the  
 most is the winner.{Football}is when  
 you have red or yellow men.There is a 
 ball and you must kick the ball, or   
 try to, in to your opponent's goal.   
{Payday}is a great game.You have a     
 plastic pound sign which is your      
 counter.You get some money and then   
 your'e off.You can buy things and you 
 get letters just like in real life.You
 get bills and postcards.Sometimes you 
 can get a reward.If you buy something 
 and land on "sell"you get up to Â£1400.
 It takes hours to finish.
