		<content>  Most of the farmland in the area is  
owned by Lord Hertford and is part of  
the Ragley Estate.It is run by Peter   
Crabtree,the estate manager of Ragley.A
small area of farmland is made up of   
small,privately owned farms which grow 
mainly wheat and barley crops.There is 
also grass land used to graze mostly   
sheep although there are some dairy    
cattle in the area.                    
  The woodland is found mainly on steep
banks or on hills where it would be    
difficult to grow crops and to use     
machinery.Weethly wood runs N-S        
along a slope to the west of the area. 
Pastural land is also found mostly on  
banks or hills for the same reason. The
arable crops are grown on flat land.   
                                       
Survey compiled by pupils of 2M and 2S,
Alcester Grammar School,summer 1985.
