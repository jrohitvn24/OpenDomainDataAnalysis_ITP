		<content> There are 8 families living in P.H. at
 the moment and each family has to have
 one room which is at least 24feet     
 square.The grounds are mainly parkland
 with a watergarden. There is a pond.  
 Trout used to be bred,however,poachers
 took most of the fish. They look after
 the grounds themselves. They do not   
 employ servants,though they used to.  
 Each family has a plot in the vege-   
 table garden. Families take turns to  
 make and mend though all families are 
 expected tobe in the garden each m'th.
 Sometimes the grounds are open to the 
 public.The tythe barn is used for barn
 dances and butterfly festivals.       
 There are lots of children -all young.
 The families do not sell their produce
 to make money.The chapel is said to be
 haunted.On one occasion the skeleton  
 of a baby was found but nobody knew   
 how it got there.        (4)          </content>
