		<title>01THORNER-GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The village of Thorner is set in a    
 shallow valley surrounded by rolling  
 farmland containing both grazing land 
 and some grain crops.                 
                                       
 The village itself is one long main   
 through road with a few sideroads.    
 Along Main Street can be found        
 housing with some shops and three     
 public houses.                        
                                       
 At one end of Main Street stands the  
 prominent white stoned{Saint Peter's} 
 church.                               
                                       
 There are signs of a railway that once
 ran through the village on its way    
 from Leeds to Wetherby.               
                                       
 The village itself seems mainly       
 residential, there appears to be no   
 industry, besides that of farming.    </content>
