		<title>17THE SEWAGE WORKS, LINCOLN.</title>
		<content> The {Canwick sewage  works} dispose of
{4,000,000  gallons} of  sewage  a day,
{12,000,000}in wet  weather. The sewage
 comes  from  toilets,  baths,  washing
 machines  etc. It  is  pumped into the
 first {settlement tanks}and, after all
 rubbish  and  grit  have been removed,
 passes  on to the next tanks which are
{13m. deep }at  the  centre. The solids
 now  sink to the bottom and the liquid
 continues  on to the filter beds where
 oxygen aids a natural breakdown. After
{18 hours}the liquid sewage reaches the
{humus tanks.}From there it is returned
 to  the  river. The {sludge}is  pumped
 inside  to  the  filter  presses which
 compact it by  a chemical  process and
 turn  it into{" cake "}which  is  then
 collected  by  farmers for fertiliser.
 The sewage  plant is now controlled by
{two computers. 3  emergency generators
 are available should the supply fail. </content>
