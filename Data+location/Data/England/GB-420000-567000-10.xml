		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE.</title>
		<content>  I get up at 6.15am.to do my{paper    
{round.}My Dad has been unemployed now 
 for two years, so I am the only wage  
 earner in the family.{School}starts at
 8.55am.and lasts until 3.15pm.Some of 
 the teachers are alright but hometime 
 can't come quick enough.After I've    
 delivered the 'Evening Chronicle'and  
 had some tea I'm off{down to the woods
 with my friends.We have a secret den  
 down there but it won't be secret any 
 more now that I've told you! Sometimes
 we go{chasing rabbits}with lurchers,  
 these are fast hunting dogs.I would   
 like one but my dad says it costs     
 enough to feed us without feeding a   
 dog.The best place for rabbits is in  
 the woods around the airport.It's all 
 private land of course and the farmers
 are not very happy when they see us,  
 but they have to catch us first!
