		<title>18"My Choice of Clothes"</title>
		<content> I like wearing jeans.They are a pair  
 of trousers made of denim which is a  
 hard-wearing material. I like skirts  
 as well. My favourite colours on my   
 clothes are red white and blue. I     
 would like to have a denim skirt which
 is like a pair of jeans but it is a   
 skirt instead. I like jumpers which   
 are made of wool. I like tee-shirts   
 and I would like a tee-shirt with a   
 picture of Paul Young on it. Paul     
 Young is a pop singer. I like ankle   
 boots and I have got a pair of them. I
 have got two pairs of trainers which  
 I wear on my feet when I go out to    
 play or when I go running.
