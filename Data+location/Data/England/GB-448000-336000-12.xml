		<content> During the reign of Henry VIII, when  
 all the monasteries were ransacked and
 closed, a monk from a monastery sited 
 near to where  the Hemlock campsite   
 now stands, was beheaded. He is said  
 to roam the campsite at night         
 searching for his head so that he can 
 rest in peace. The monk has been      
 sighted on several occasions by       
 reliable people.                      
 The Hemlock Stone has been the site of
 Devil Worship and Black Magic rites   
 throughout the centuries.             
 An old lady dressed in her white bed  
 gown, rocking in her chair has also   
 been sighted near the Hemlock camp.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
