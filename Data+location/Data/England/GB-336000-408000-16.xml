		<title>16Services in Halsall</title>

  The Police Station in Halsall has    
only one officer. He told us there was 
not much crime in Halsall as it is a   
relatively quiet area, having only     
about 1472 people. There are no cells  
in the Station because it is a house   
and the policeman and his wife live    
upstairs.                              
  The Telephone Exchange has 1100 lines
and covers Barton, Halsall and part of 
Scarisbrick. It has one full-time      
worker and one part-time cleaner. The  
Exchange falls within the Preston      
Telephone area.                        
  Most of the people we interviewed    
liked to shop in nearby towns, but     
there are local shops including a      
general store, a chip shop and a       
vegetable store.
