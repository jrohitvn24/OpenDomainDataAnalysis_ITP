		<content>{Interview with Mr Skelton. Continued. 
                                       
 The major hazard for his crops is that
 hares eat his sugar beet and wheat and
 barley can suffer from mildew.        
 His main customer for his potatoes is 
 Walker's Crisps of Leicester. The     
 British Sugar Corporation factory at  
 Newark takes all the sugar beet and   
 Nicholson's take the barley.          
 Mr Skelton doesn't keep many animals; 
 the only livestock being 36 ewes for  
 breeding sheep.                       
 Thirty five acres of the farm is      
 devoted to livestock and over four    
 hundred acres for crops. Mr Skelton   
 has lived on the farm all his life and
 the farm has been passed down since   
 his grandfather's times in 1948.He    
 became a farmer because he has never  
 known anything else and because he was
 interested in it.                     </content>
