		<title>09HOUSES IN OARE</title>
		<content>  The oldest house in Oare is the Old  
 Oxyard, where the late Lady Hurd,     
 mother of Douglas Hurd the            
 present Home Secretary, used          
 to live. It was built in the late     
 17th.century, or even earlier.        
  Other houses, such as the Post Office
 have very old parts,but they have been
 rebuilt.                              
  The original part of Oare House is   
 dated 1740. It was designed by Clough 
 Williams Ellis whose work includes the
 village of Portmeirion in Wales. The  
 first owner was Henry Deacon, a London
 Wine Merchant.  In 1930 Sir Geoffrey  
 Fry, who was Personal Secretary to Sir
 Stanley Baldwin, added wings to the   
 main house.                           
   Much of the main village was built  
 about the late seventeenth century.
