		<title>16POPULATION IN PANTON</title>
		<content>{PANTON }is a scattered small community
 and at the moment there are no plans  
 for any new house building and        
 therefore the population is fairly    
 static. Most of the present residents 
 have moved into the area in recent    
 years and none spent their childhood  
 in {PANTON.}The majority of people in 
{PANTON}belong to a family group and   
 only two people live alone.One moved  
 here recently and rears goats. He     
 moved into a house formerly occupied  
 by an elderly man who lived alone and 
 died there. The youngest member of the
 area is under one year old and the    
 oldest is just over sixty.The rest of 
 the population comprises a            
 cross-section of ages and backgrounds.
