		<title>09CHURCHES OF HURWORTH PLACE.</title>
		<content>   St. Cuthbert's Church is the Roman  
 Catholic Church in the grounds of St. 
 Cuthbert's Hospital. People from      
 Hurworth, Croft and from other        
 surrounding villages, as well as from 
 Darlington, attend services here. Ill 
 people from the hospital who are      
 Catholic also go to the services. The 
 building is quite big and very nice.  
 There is a steeple that looks like a  
 rocket. There are lots of Brothers  of
 the Hospitaller Order of St. John of  
 God who make sure that the service is 
 a success. Many people enjoy the      
 services at this very friendly church.
   The Christadelphian Hall is also    
 situated in Hurworth Place. There are 
 three services each Sunday and a Bible
 Reading Meeting each Tuesday. The     
 congregation mainly come from         
 Darlington.
