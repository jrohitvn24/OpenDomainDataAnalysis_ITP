		<title>01Lowlands N.W. Of Edenbridge</title>
		<content> The landscape of this area on the     
 Surrey/Kent border is fairly flat,    
 being of clay lowlands. The highest   
 ground is on the western side at Merle
 Common. There are distant views of    
 higher ridges which lie further north.
 It is a rural area of farmland &amp;      
 woods. There is some arable farming &amp; 
 the raising of livestock predominates.
 Cattle, sheep &amp; horses are grazed in  
 the fields. The woods are mainly of   
 oak &amp; beech, carpeted with bluebells  
 in the Spring. There is a small       
 residential area with two retail shops
 at Marlpit Hill, on the outskirts of  
 Edenbridge. The hamlet of Merle Common
 has a first school &amp; there are        
 workshops &amp; a forge. Nearby in        
 Staffhurst Wood is the tiny St        
 Sylvan's Church with the unusual      
 feature of integral living            
 accommodation for the incumbent.      </content>
