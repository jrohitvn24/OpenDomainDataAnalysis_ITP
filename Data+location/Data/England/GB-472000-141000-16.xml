		<title>16ROADS (FROYLE/HOLYBOURNE)</title>
		<content> Important routes, the {Harrow Way,}two
 Roman roads, the {Pilgrims Way,}the { 
{coaching roads} and the modern{dual   
{carriage-way} have all in their turn  
 connected this area with the east and 
 west.                                 
 Pilgrims and travellers walked or rode
 horseback.  Later travellers used     
 coaches and carriages and last        
 century the railway also connected    
 Froyle with London and Winchester .   
                                       
 The modern dual carriage-way was built
 this century to keep motor traffic    
 moving fast but the railway from Alton
 to Winchester closed a few years ago, 
 with the possibility of a reduction to
 single track railway from Alton to    
 Farnham, although many people still   
 commute to London from the area.
