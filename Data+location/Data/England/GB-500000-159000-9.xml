		<content> I live in Laurel Crescent,Woodham Lane
 and am a Manager with Chase Manhatten 
 Bank which is the third largest       
 American bank. Their office in London 
 has about 1200 employees. I am        
 involved in providing financial       
 services to individuals but mostly to 
 companies, some of which are in the   
 Middle East.                          
  I am a State Registered Nurse working
 part-time at St.Peter's Hospital in   
 Chertsey. I do Night Duty one or two  
 nights per week, usually on a         
 different ward each night with        
 patients of all ages and with many    
 different illnesses. My shift starts  
 at 8.55pm and finishes at 7.30am.     
  I am a Secretary to an Insurance     
 Broker in Woking Town Centre, chiefly 
 helping to find money for people to   
 buy houses. Six people work in the    
 office from 8.30am to 4.45pm.         </content>
