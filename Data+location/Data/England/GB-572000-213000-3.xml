		<title>03FARM BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> This area is very rural and still     
 retains an air of calm and            
 tranquillity.                         
 Many of the farms buildings were built
 during the 14th &amp; 15th centuries.Some 
 still show their original form but    
 others have been 'modernised' ,putting
 a Georgian or Victorian front onto the
 building.                             
  Several of them still retain a pond, 
 usually in the form of a moat         
 surrounding the immediate premises of 
 the farm.                             
   Most  of the farm houses are now    
 private residences and the land       
 is farmed from else where.            
   Near Hole Farm a grove of willow    
 trees has been planted, growing for   
 the making of Cricket bats in about 15
 years time.
