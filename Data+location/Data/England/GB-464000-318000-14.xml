		<title>14FARMING, RAGDALE AREA _ 2</title>
		<content> There is Dairy farming in the area    
 around the village of Ragdale in      
 north_east Leicestershire.  There is  
 one large herd of pedigree Charolais  
 cows in Ragdale and several smaller   
 herds of Friesian cows on nearby      
 farms.                                
                                       
 There are herds of beast on some      
 farms.                                
                                       
 Several flocks of sheep are kept on   
 the rough grazing.                    
                                       
 There are some ten farms in the area  
 around Ragdale.  Farming is mixed.    
 Some of the pasture has remained      
 uncultivated for hundreds of years and
 evidence of medieval farming practices
 can be seen in the land ridges.       
                                       
                                       </content>
