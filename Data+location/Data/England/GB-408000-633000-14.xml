		<title>14Belford Health Centre.</title>
		<content> The Health Centre houses 3 doctors who
 treat patients from at least 10       
 surrounding villages including Chatton
 Seahouses,and Holy Island.There are   
 about 4000 patients registered.Each   
 doctor is on duty for 102 hours per   
 week on average and drives about 360  
 miles each week,as more time is spent 
 visiting homes than in the surgery.   
 The Health Visitor has an office      
 upstairs where she can be contacted   
 each morning.She runs a baby clinic   
 once a fortnight in Belford to which  
 mothers can bring their babies for    
 weighing and to discuss any problems  
 they might have.                      
 The District Nurse also treats        
 patients in the Health Centre changing
 bandages,checking mothers who are     
 expecting babies and so on.
