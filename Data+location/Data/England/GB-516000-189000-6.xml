		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MICHAEL ROSENHEAD
 (CONTINUED)                           
                                       
    When Shabbat is over we say a      
 prayer which is called Havdalah. This 
 is a small service for the going out  
 of Shabbat. There are three prayers we
 say: one for the wine we drink, one   
 for the spices we smell and one for   
 the candle we light. This candle is   
 plaited and to put it out we dip it in
 the wine. Then we sing the song of    
 Elijah and Shabbat is out.            
    We are an Orthodox Jewish family,  
 which means that we keep our religion 
 strictly. There are also Jewish people
 who do not observe their religion as  
 strictly as we do.
