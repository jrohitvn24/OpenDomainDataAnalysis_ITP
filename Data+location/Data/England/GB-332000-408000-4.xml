		<title>04FINE JANE'S PUMPING STATION.</title>
		<content> The manned water pumping station known
 as Fine Jane's Pumping station was    
 built in 1924.  There are three large 
 pumps that can be operated manually or
 automatically.  An electrode circuit  
 controls the automatic system. The    
 water balance must rise to trigger the
 shorter of the electrodes which starts
 the pumping automatically.   These    
 pumps work on a continuous network,   
 handling 70,000 gallons of water per  
 minute, passing this water through a  
 series of sluices to an unmanned      
 station and from there onto the Altcar
 flood gates and the sea.  The         
 drainage ditches and the pumping      
 station are vital to this land, as    
 without them farming would be         
 impossible except for a few short     
 months in the summer.  Since they were
 installed farming is carried out all  
 year.                                 </content>
