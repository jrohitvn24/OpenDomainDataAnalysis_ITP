		<title>11Kingfisher Shopping Centre.</title>
		<content> I go{shopping}each Saturday with my   
 mum, dad, and brother. We travel to   
 Redditch by car and use{car park}3. As
 we enter the car park we take a ticket
 from a{machine}to raise the barrier.  
 From the car park it is easy to walk{ 
{undercover}into the Kingfisher Centre.
 We enter Owen Owen's{department store 
 from an open square with a frozen food
 shop, greengrocers, kitchen shop,     
 jewellers and hairdressers. All the   
 undercover{squares}have features; palm
 trees, mosaics or water sculptures. It
 makes the centre interesting. We shop 
 at Sainsbury's for our food. This is  
 the part I dread most as it tends to  
 be boring. The one good thing is that 
 there is always the chance that we    
 will go to MacDonald's for a coffee or
 coke, or to Chelsea Girl for some     
 clothes. When we leave the car park we
 give in the ticket and pay the fee.   </content>
