		<content> We have one play area in Langtree     
 where we have four swings, two seats, 
 one climbing frame, one netball post  
 and two football goals. some nights   
 from about five-thirty about twenty   
 people come up or sometimes only about
 four people.                          
 We play football and other ball games,
 sometimes we play cricket or rounders.
 The age range is from about four up to
 about forty but mostly around ten to  
 fourteen.                             
 Sometimes we have fetes up there with 
 stalls, games,food and raffles. We    
 have a lot of fun up there and enjoy  
 meeting our friends.
