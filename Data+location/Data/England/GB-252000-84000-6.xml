		<title>06Sheep and Goats</title>
		<content>   Athough this part of the moor is    
 used mainly as an artillary range some
 farming still takes place. This is    
 usually{sheep farming,}though some    
 goats are in evidence. The sheep are  
 mainly raised for meat, except in the 
 lower parts of the area where some    
 wool sheep are to be found.           
   Unusually for this country, and for 
 Dartmoor one can see examples of      
{Jacobs Sheep}on the lower parts of    
{High Down.}The Jacobs Sheep are       
 characterised by the foreward pointing
 horns. Unless one looks carefully it  
 would be easy to confuse a Jacobs with
 a goat, they have similar             
 characteristics.                      
  Sheep are found all over the moor,   
 but cattle are also raised here. At   
 one time rabbits were raised in       
 warrens in order to provide meat for  
 the tinners.                          </content>
