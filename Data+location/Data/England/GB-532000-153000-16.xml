		<title>16A SCHOOL PLAYGROUND GAME</title>
		<content>{  BRITISH BULLDOG}can be played by 10 
 to 20 children in any open space.     
{HOW TO PLAY-}Someone is selected to be
 the{BULL.}The other players are called
 the{DOGS.}The bull stands in the      
 middle of the area and the dogs remain
 at one end. The bull calls out the    
 name of one of the dogs. The dog has  
 to run from his side, to the other    
 side without being caught. If the bull
 catches the dog he must lift him up   
 and shout,{"BRITISH BULLDOG! 1,2,3".} 
   This dog now joins the bull and the 
 game proceeds until all the dogs are  
 caught. The first dog caught will be  
 the bull in the next game.            
   If one of the dogs manages to get   
 across without being caught he shouts{
{"BULLDOG".}The rest of the dogs       
 stampede across. If any are caught    
 they join the bull. At any time the   
 bull may call{"STAMPEDE".             </content>
