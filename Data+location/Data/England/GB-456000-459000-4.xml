		<content> This area has one farm, called        
 Bohemia. To the north of the farm is a
 district referred to on the ordnance  
 map as Bohemia. The farm is occupied, 
 and the land is mainly arable with    
 some grazing land.                    
 The area is dissected by a local      
 traffic road running from north-west  
 to south-east. The road eventually    
 joins up further south with another   
 minor road leading from Wigginton to  
 Shipton, and in the north peters out  
 into a narrow farm track. This track  
 appeared to be overgrown and showed   
 little sign of use, apart from ruts   
 made by farm vehicles and implements. 
 A stream running from east to west, is
 crossed by a single lane bridge called
 Bull Lane Bridge.The stream runs in   
 the bottom of a  deep ditch, which    
 showed signs of having been dredged   
 and deepened at some time             </content>
