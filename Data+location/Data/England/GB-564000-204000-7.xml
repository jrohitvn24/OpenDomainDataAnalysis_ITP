		<title>07WRITTLE, A TYPICAL SUNDAY</title>
		<content> Sunday in my family means getting up  
 early and going to church. the church 
 service starts at 10:45am and finishes
 at 11:45am                            
       The service we go to is called  
 a family service. All my family go to 
 church, that is my mum,my             
 dad,Christopher,my brother, Ruth,my   
 sister,and me.                        
       Christopher and I belong to the 
 church choir and we practise on       
 Wednesdays for one and a half hours.  
       At 10:45am there is a Sunday    
 school for five to eleven year olds.  
 There is a church club for fourth     
 years called the Seventy Seven Set.   
        Sometimes in the service there 
 is a  baptism and sometimes after the 
 service there is coffee served in the 
 Christian Centre.                     
      After church we go home and have 
 our lunch.                            </content>
