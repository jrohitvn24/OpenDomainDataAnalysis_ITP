    { MR HODGKINSON,}A FARMER OF RAIKES
FARM, IS OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR.HE    
USED TO OWN THE FIELD IN WHICH OUR     
SCHOOL IS BUILT.                       
     HIS FARM IS MAINLY PASTURE AND HE 
KEEPS COWS AND SHEEP. HE ALSO REARS    
GEESE AND TURKEYS FOR CHRISTMAS.       
     BECAUSE HE IS SO NEAR THE TOWN HE 
HAS A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH VANDALS      
BREAKING FENCES, DOGS WORRYING SHEEP   
AND PEOPLE DUMPING LITTER.             
     ONE DAY HIS LAND WILL BE USED FOR 
BUILDING HOUSES ON BUT FOR NOW IT IS   
PLEASANT TO SIT ON OUR FIELD ON A NICE 
DAY AND LOOK AT THE VIEW{.BY LOUISE    
HUNT.}
