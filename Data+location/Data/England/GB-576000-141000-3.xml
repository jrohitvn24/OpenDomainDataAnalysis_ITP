		<content>   While Staplehurst does not appear in
 the Domesday Book the church at       
 "Wealdenway" in the Monachorum of 1087
 could refer to Staplehurst.           
  Although the original church has been
 dated at 1200 the Saxon door is dated 
 1040 and could have been made for the 
 church.                               
   The{Nave}and{Aisle}are 14th century 
 and the{Chapel}was built  in the 15th 
 century and was once known as the     
 Spilsil Chancel.                      
  The{Anchorite Cell}communicated with 
 the the church though the round       
 opening in the wall.                  
  The original{Font}stands by the      
 pulpit and the new one next to the    
 Knight's Heart.                       
  The{West Tower}was built between 1400
 and 1425 and contains the{Clock}made  
 in the 18th century by Messrs.        
 Thwaites &amp; Reed of Croydon.           </content>
