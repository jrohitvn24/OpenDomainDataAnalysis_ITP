		<content> This village is situated about three  
 miles west of Helston. It was         
 originally a mining village. The name 
 Breage originates from an Irish Saint 
 called{Breaca}who established a church
 in the village. When mining was an    
 important industry in the area the    
 village had three Wesleyan chapels,   
 one church, two public houses and a   
 bakery. It has an annual fair held in 
 June which survives from the mining   
 period. The public well and water     
 pump also survive which at one time   
 served the village and outlying       
 district. The village was also the    
 home of the Godolphin family who owned
 the local mine and represented Helston
 in parliament.
