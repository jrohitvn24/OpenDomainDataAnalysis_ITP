		<content>  Interest in conservation appears to  
 be widespread.The National Trust owns 
 hill land near Holly Cottage,Womerton 
 and in the Gogbatch,thus ensuring that
 this land is protected.The farming    
 community is interested in maintaining
 hedgerows and woodland and trees are  
 planted to replace those that are     
 felled.                               
  In the villages, many old houses are 
 either well maintained or have been   
 sympathetically restored.The Pound Inn
 the only thatched building in the area
 has recently been re-thatched.The     
 churches are also well maintained.    
  Public footpaths,although not often  
 signposted,are kept open,but farmers  
 complain that walkers stray from paths
 and damage hedges. Professional       
 conservationists are viewed with some 
 suspicion and villagers are wary of   
 over-development.                     </content>
