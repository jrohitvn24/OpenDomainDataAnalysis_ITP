		<title>19Things We Like</title>
		<content> I like going on holiday and coming    
 home, being with my Mum, Dad and      
 family, eating chicken, beef and roast
 potatoes.The fun of being able to     
 roller_skate, lying in the sun and    
 swimming. I like to see other people  
 enjoying themselves and doing the     
 things that I like to do, like eating 
 ice_cream,going to the pier, going to 
 the pictures and drinking coke.I also 
 like to paint and draw, read a long   
 book,look across the countryside on   
 a nice day, fly on an aeroplane,ride  
 on a train, or sail on a boat.        
        I like Friday evening when     
 Cover Up is on, and there's no school 
 the next day.The days George Micheal  
 is on Top of the Pops, and when I     
 have Dr Pepper to drink.Sometimes     
 I enjoy spending some time with my    
 family. I like watching Dallas and    
 listening to my tapes.                </content>
