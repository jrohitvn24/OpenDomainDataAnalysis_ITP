		<title>12Wansworth Prison</title>
		<content>Wandsworth Prison was originally named 
Surrey County Jail and was constructed 
in 1863.The Reverend Harry Entwhistle, 
Anglican Prison Chaplin,visited The    
Study School to give us a short talk   
about H.M.Prison,Wandsworth.He started 
off by telling us about the sizes and  
shapes of the buildings.We discovered  
that the main building was set in the  
form of a cartwheel,and the spokes     
represented wings of cell blocks.The   
men prisoners were allowed half an hour
visiting time per month.240 men were   
fitted into each cell branch,so        
altogether the prison held 1500        
convicts.Their day started by getting  
up at 6.30 to prepare for porridge and 
hot water at 7.15 then onto one hour's 
exercise walking around a circular     
track,then hard tiring work inside a   
block for 2.50 pounds a week.In the    
evenings they are locked away.         </content>
