		<content> The block is on top of the Pennines   
 and is therefore often very windy and 
 rainy.The major rock-type of the area 
 is limestone.                         
 The block is criss-crossed by         
 footpaths,the main one being the {    
{Pennine Way}which runs parallel to the
 River Aire.                           
 There is little pollution in the      
 block,since any drinking water is     
 brought off the moors above Malham.   
{Supernatural in Malhamdale}

 ghost called the Grey Lady who sits in
