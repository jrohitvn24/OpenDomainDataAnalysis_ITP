		<title>06PUBS IN BOROUGH GREEN</title>
		<content>   The main road in Borough Green used 
to be a {toll road} and was part of the
main route from London to Dover. Four  
of our five {pubs} are dotted along it,
and three of them date back five       
hundred years.                         
   The Black Horse dates from 1594 and 
the Red Lion dates from 1586. The Rock 
was was a beer house between 1862 and  
1872. It was a Friends' {Meeting House}
before that. It became a full {pub} in 
1950.                                  
   The Railway Hotel was built just a  
year after the railway, in 1875, as    
more and more people came here by      
train. When people got off the train   
after long journeys they went in the   
Railway Hotel for a pint and some food.
They could also stay the night there.
