		<title>10WOODMAN'S FARM-PIG FARMING</title>
		<content> About 2000 pigs are reared on the farm
 in a purpose-built shed which is best 
 described as functional, cheap, but   
 not attractive.The pigs are bought    
 cheaply simply for fattening. They are
 fed on almost any food the farmer can 
 obtain: there seemed to be no system  
 as in beef or  dairy farming methods  
 that we studied.                      
                                       
 The government seems to have less     
 impact on this type of farming than on
 others we studied there are no grants 
 or subsidies for pig farming though   
 there is a grant of approx. Â£6 per    
 head for the few sheep on the farm.   
                                       
 This farmer does not live on his farm,
 but lives 2 miles away at Wickham.    
 Like many others in the area that we  
 spoke to, he seems to own his land.
