We think school buildings will have    
solar panelled roofs to supply energy  
for the computers,lighting and         
heating. Pupils will use computers and 
printers instead of pencils and        
books.Instead of a black board there   
will be a big screen in front of the   
class room connected to a computer and 
to the television network.We think     
there will  still be human teachers    
but they might  be assisted by robot   
and computer learning systems.Teachers 
will be trained to work computers and  
make progams.We think there will be    
progams for English and Maths instead  
of books. If you are doing a certain   
topic you would tipe in the name and   
get what you needed on your screen. For
example,if you were doing Africa you   
would get maps and information.
