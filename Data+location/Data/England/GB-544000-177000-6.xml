My leisure interests are canoing,caving
and swimming. I go canoing every week. 
We go over Thamesmead. I like canoing  
because you can capsize and have raft  
races. A raft race is when you link the
canoes together and run across them    
without falling in. Caving is hard. You
have to get through small holes. I went
in a wet cave. A wet cave is when all  
water goes through the caves. I like   
caving because it is hard. I saw  a bat
and it flew away. I go swimming every  
week. I have done my 10 meters right up
to my silver. I am hoping to join a    
swimming club so I can do my gold and  
honours. I hope that I will do them.
