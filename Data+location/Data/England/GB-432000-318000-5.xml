 games are:

 British bull dog  is people running   
 across an open space and one other    
 person trying to pick them up off the 
 ground and when they have done that   
 the person that has been caught is on 
 the catchers side.This goes on untill 
 there is only 1 person left.Then      
 another game starts with that person  
 being on.
