		<content>      {All Saints Church-Cont          
 contains five complete pillars and    
 five made of pieces of stone.They have
 decorated gothic arches.The wooden    
 roof was renewed in 1952 at the cost  
 of Â£1,741.It is made of very big      
 pieces of oak timber.The bell tower   
 is younger.There is a very big wooden 
 chest inside the church. It was used  
 to keep treasures so that they would  
 not be stolen.Inside the porch is a   
 Roman altar.There is a plaque on the  
 wall to commemorate George Hedley,the 
 inventor of the Puffing Billy         
 Locomative.On the back wall is an iron
 ring and a chain to which Bibles were 
 once fastened.In the church we had to 
 find some mice on the pews.All of the 
 mice were carved by Mr.Thompson of    
 Yorkshire.There was one mouse on      
 the leg and one on of the seat of the 
 pew that I looked at.                 </content>
