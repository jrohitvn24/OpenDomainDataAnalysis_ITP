		<content>CHURCH OF ST. MICHAEL                  
  This is the Roman Catholic Church. It
is known locally as the church of the  
seven parishes. These are namely       
Walton, Hilderstone, MIlwich, Burston, 
Sandon, Little Stoke and Aston.        
  It was built by Father Dominic c.1845
who came from Italy with the intent of 
being a Papal Missionary.  He was later
to die in Aston.                       
                                       
CHURCH OF ST. SAVIOUR                  
  This is the Church of England church 
in the Parish of St. Michael. In fact  
the rector of the Stone St. Michael's  
Parish Church is also rector of St.    
Saviours.  It was extensively rebuilt  
in the early 1800's.  Next to it was   
founded an Elementary school called    
Aston School. This was closed in the   
late 1960's when only 7 children were  
left on roll.                          </content>
