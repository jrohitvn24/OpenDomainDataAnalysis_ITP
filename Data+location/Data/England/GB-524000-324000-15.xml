		<content>    Changes in people's eating habits  
 has led to a drift away from canned to
 frozen products.                      
                                       
    The cost of metal for cans and cost
 of energy to process the foods has led
 to more food being frozen because it  
 works out cheaper.                    
    Frozen foods have a lot better     
 flavour which the housewife is well   
 aware of and the people only have to  
 use what they need so it saves on     
 household expenses in the long run.   
    In this age of looking for         
 healthy food frozen food is much more 
 nutrious than canned food.            
    It is expected that people will be 
 still eating canned and frozen        
 products in 50 years time. Smedley's  
 are looking more at Continental dishes
 these days in order to cater for a    
 variety of tastes.                    </content>
