		<content>   Burton Joyce, a sizeable            
 village,provides many shops and       
 amenities for its population.The      
 choice includes a supermarket,a       
 library and a Post Office.            
  A survey was conducted on Burton     
 Joyce Main Street to discover how     
 often the amenities in the village    
 were used and why.They were all used  
 regularly;in the supermarket's case   
 mainly for groceries,bread and milk,  
 while the Post Office was used to buy 
 stationery and to pay bills;children  
 tended to buy sweets.The Post Office's
 busiest day was Thursday when seven   
 hundred pensions were collected.The   
 library provided opportunities for    
 borrowing books and records,reading   
 magazines and obtaining information.  
  Many people expressed a need for a   
 fish &amp; chip shop or a Chinese         
 take-away &amp; a cake-cum-tea shop.      </content>
