		<title>07BERRY POMEROY CASTLE</title>
		<content>     We went to Berry Pomeroy Castle   
 which was the home of the Pomeroy     
 family and then later the residence   
 of the Seymours.  Workmen were        
 rebuilding some of the castle walls   
 and we were shown a medieval fresco   
 which had been discovered on the wall 
 of the chapel above the gate house. It
 is called 'The adoration of the Magi.'
 It is thought to have been painted by 
 a Flemish artist during the fourteenth
 century.                              
         We saw the Round Tower in     
 which Lady Margaret was imprisoned in 
 the dungeons for ten years. She died  
 there and her ghost is said to haunt  
 the ramparts.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
