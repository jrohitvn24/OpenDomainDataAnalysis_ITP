  eight. Andrea sat next to her friend 
 Belinda. Sarah had sandwiches. We     
 played in the playground until 1.00p.m
 We came in and carried on with our    
 work until 2.15p.m.and had another    
 break. We played Bulldogs again. We   
 went back into the classroom and did  
 athletics. At 3.15 p.m.it was time for
 house assembly and then it was home   
 time. Toby stayed behind for cricket  
 practice.

 watched T.V until 9.30p.m.then went to
 bed. Sarah had her tea which was salad
