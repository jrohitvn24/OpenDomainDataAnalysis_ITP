 People mainly rely on private cars to 
 get around.It is necessary to drive to
 the nearest railway station to catch a
 train to London or Portsmouth,and most
 parents have to drive their over eight
 year old children to school and home  
 again.Many form a rota to help each   
 other.                                
 A bus runs through the village,taking 
 passengers to Farnham or Haslemere,but
 times are often inconvenient,and fares
 are costly.                           
 Some people use bicycles to get from  
 place to place.                       
 The main road through the village     
 carries a large number of heavy       
 lorries,most of which deliver or      
 collect from shops and businesses     
 along their route.                    
 Coach transport is always needed for  
 school outings.                       </content>
