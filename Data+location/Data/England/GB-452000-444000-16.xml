		<title>16Facilities Bilbrough Colton</title>
		<content> The facilities in the 2 villages are  
 similar.They both have a public house.
 In Bilbrough it is the Three Hares and
 in Colton it is the Sun Inn.Unlike    
 Bilbrough Colton does not have a      
 school.They each have a church built  
 in the reign of Queen Victoria.Neither
 have many services today.There are    
 3 tennis courts in Bilbrough, and many
 functions organised by the school.For 
 other facilities both communities have
 to go to York or Tadcaster.For sports 
 and swimming; for dentists, doctors,  
 opticians and hospital treatment York 
 is the nearest.There are 2 garages on 
 the A64 for petrol and repairs _ one  
 at Colton Lane End and one more       
 distant near the Wild Man Inn.For the 
 nearest theatre or cinema they have to
 travel to York by car.Colton has its  
 own post office, but Bilbrough        
 residents have to go toYork by car/bus</content>
