		<title>09History of Earls Croome.</title>
		<content> The history of the Village is shared  
 with Upton but it had its own annual  
 Fair with merchandise unloaded from a 
 quay one mile up river then carried by
 pack ass up the old Hollowstreet or   
 way called Donkey Lane to Woodleys    
 Farm, site of the Fair.  There is     
 little of historic note in the village
 apart from{Earls Croome Court,}house  
 of Earl Coventry,an early 17th century
 house, and the small 12th century     
 Church of St. Nicholas.  The Tower was
 added in 1832. Within the chancel     
 there is a stone memorial to Thomas   
 Jeffry onetime owner of the Court and 
 brother of the infamous Judge Jeffry.
