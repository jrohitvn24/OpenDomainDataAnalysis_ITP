		<title>19A Saturday in Ruan Minor</title>
		<content> On Saturday I like to get up early to 
 get breakfast for myself. Then I feel 
 ill and go back to bed again.I wake up
 again and I go to put the television  
 on. I watch Saturday Picture Show     
 which has pop stars on it and funny   
 cartoons. Then I wait till my gran is 
 up.I don't need to get up in the      
 morning for school as there is none on
 Saturday.                             
 In the day time I play in the village 
 with some boys. Afterwards I go home  
 and watch television until we have    
 dinner. Later I go back down the      
 village to go fishing at              
 Poltesco.Sometimes I play football in 
 the recreation ground. We call it the 
 rec. for short. About 7p.m. I go home 
 to have some tea. On television I     
 watch Dynasty which is about an oil   
 company and I watch World of Sport.
