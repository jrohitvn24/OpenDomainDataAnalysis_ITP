 as a young boy and from that time he  
 was determined to become the manager  
 there. Sixteen years ago his ambition 
 was realized. Now he and his family

 likes village life and is very active 
 in many village groups. He has        
 journeyed far for his faith, to Israel
 and Canada taking members of the      
 church with him. God called Mr Gibson 
 to become a vicar, a calling which    
 gives deep satisfaction through       
 helping people.
