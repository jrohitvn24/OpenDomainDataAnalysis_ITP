 During the Summer the old people of   
 Rottingdean are able to spend a lot of
 time out of doors with their friends. 
 The Winter months, however, force them
 to spend more time in their homes     
 where they do knitting, reading,      
 writing and drawing. There is much    
 social activity often connected with  
 the W.I. and other groups. Families   
 also spend a large amount of time     
 inside their homes during the winter  
 months. Tea is early and children     
 enjoy TV. They do their homework and  
 play computer games with their family.
 Friends are often invited round. There
 is a local baby-sitting syndicate to  
 enable parents to have evenings out.
