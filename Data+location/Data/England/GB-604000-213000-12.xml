		<title>12THE EAST MERSEA RANGER</title>
		<content>   The present{RANGER}for Cudmore Grove
 Country Park was appointed in March   
 1983.He was trained at an agricultural
 college in Edinburgh. He looks after  
 the{56 hectares} of grassland which   
 make up the park. There is a carpark  
 with a capacity of 220 cars. However  
 on one Sunday in July 1983 some 900   
 cars had to be accommodated in the    
 park. The park is used by many        
 different people who come to fly      
 kites, play games, walk dogs and ride 
 horses. One man claims to have walked 
 his dog in the park every day for the 
 last{18}years.                        
 The Ranger's job is therefore very    
 demanding. He encourages school       
 parties to use the park for           
 educational purposes and is pleased   
 that new facilities such as a toilet  
 block and an information centre are   
 planned for the park.                 </content>
