		<content>     The scenery in the Deepcar area is
 created by the erosive action of the  
 Rivers Don and its tributary the      
 Porter (little Don). They have cut    
 deep parallel valleys along the       
 scarplines. From the confluence at    
 Deepcar, the Don flows down the wooded
 valley, with Wharncliffe Crags 150    
 metres above it, towards Sheffield.   
    Viewed from the A629 near Wortley, 
 through the gap formed by the Don, the
 escarpment of Hunshelf Bank is clearly
 visible, the scarp slope facing       
 Deepcar and the south-west. Similarly 
 Wharncliffe Rocks represent the scarp 
 face and the Chase area to the A629   
 the dip slope.                        
    Don Field river cliff cross section
 _ clays, coal shales(incl.fossil      
 mussels), sandstone. Outcrops of      
 millstone grit(hard sandstone) at     
 Wharncliffe Crags and Townend Common. </content>
