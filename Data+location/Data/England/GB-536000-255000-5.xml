		<title>05WILLIAM WATTS</title>
		<content> This is the biography of William      
 Watts the local conservationist.Mr    
 Watts started maintaining the village 
 20 years ago.He took over from Mr Eric
 Hawtree.Mr Watts  became interested   
 after being asked to help,although he 
 doesn't have anybody to help him.The  
 Parish Council orders the plants and  
 stakes and decides where Mr.Watts is  
 going to put them.In Spring he clears 
 the grass,nettles and weeds,in the    
 Autumn he plants trees and orders     
 stock.In Winter he plants and         
 prunes.Mr Watts finds older people    
 sympathetic to his work,but some      
 youngsters are vandals which he thinks
 is the village's greatest threat.Mr.  
 Watts saved a 3 acre site which he is 
 developing as a natural habitat       
 planted with native trees.It is called
 Watts Wood.
