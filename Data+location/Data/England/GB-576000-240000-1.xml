		<title>01BELCHAMP ST. PAUL AREA</title>
		<content>{ }This area has always been extremely 
 rural.{Agriculture}is the main        
 industry but being entirely arable and
 machine orientated actually employs   
 very few people. The countryside is   
 beautiful and unspoilt still though   
 trees and hedges are disappearing.The 
 centre of Belchamp St.Paul has been   
 made a{conservation area}which means  
 that development is restricted. Houses
 are comparatively expensive so young  
 people tend to move away. The average 
 age of residents is rising. The school
 is declining. There is a post office  
 store, mobile fish and vegetable van, 
 daily deliveries of post, milk, bread 
 and newspapers. Buses run to Sudbury  
 on Tuesdays,Thursdays and Saturdays.  
 There is a church, community house,   
 three public houses,a garage,a playing
 field, sewerage works, mains water,   
 electricity,telephone, policeman.     </content>
