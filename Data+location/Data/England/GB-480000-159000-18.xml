		<content> Within the area are the Tri-lakes,    
 a privately owned water park where    
 fish are bred and released for        
 angling.  The third largest carp ever 
 caught (43 lbs) was landed here as    
 well as a 16 lb pike.   In the country
 park are several pools. Around        
 Wyndhams Pool grow the rare           
 insect-eating sundew plant, and Bog   
 Asphodel and cotton grass.  This is a 
 conservation area for birds, plants   
 insects and fishes and mammals.  There
 have been badger setts here for about 
 150 years.  There is a nature trail,  
 picnic area, boating pond for model   
 boats and facilities for coarse       
 fishing.  The Old Hospital pond is    
 only for naturalists and not for      
 angling.
