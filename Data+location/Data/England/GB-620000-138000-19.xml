		<content> Rubbish from all over the district is 
 brought to this site for disposal.The 
 site was originally an incinerator and
 all rubbish was burnt and disposed of 
 locally.However the incinerator was   
 closed three years ago and rubbish is 
 now prepared for disposal at a large  
 site in Sandwich.                     
  Our site consists of a large pit 30  
 feet deep. This pit contains two days 
 rubbish.A crane lifts the rubbish into
 a hopper which moves the refuse into a
 crushing machine which then presses   
 the remains into a container.The      
 container holds 15 tons of compressed 
 rubbish.On average 119 tons of rubbish
 is moved every day.The workmen wish   
 the site was still an incinerator,    
 where the work was much more          
 interesting.The whole site really     
 smells.The site is run by Kent County 
 Council.                              </content>
