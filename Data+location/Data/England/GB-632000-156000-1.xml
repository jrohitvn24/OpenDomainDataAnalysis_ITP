		<title>01Sandwich;a Cinque Port Town.</title>
		<content>   Sandwich was a significant Mediaeval
port. Gradual silting of the mouth of  
the River Stour and development of     
spits and sand dunes have led to the   
town's decline in importance. Marshy   
land around the dry town site has since
been reclaimed as very fertile farm    
land. Sandwich and the nearby village  
of Worth command large areas of orchard
and vegetable crops with extensive     
cattle grazing on low lying meadow     
land.                                  
   The area surrounding this timber    
beamed town with its narrow, traffic   
choked streets is almost without       
relief. It is bounded in the north by  
the River Stour, to the west by the new
by-pass road, and in the east by the   
sandy sea-side ridges of Royal St.     
George's Golf Links.                   
   Sandwich is now a tourist's haven.
