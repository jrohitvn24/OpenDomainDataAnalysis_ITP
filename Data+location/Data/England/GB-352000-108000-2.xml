		<content> This is an area of low hills and small
 streams. The underlying rocks are     
 mostly clays of Jurassic age,         
 incorporating varying amounts of      
 broken limestone. The higher ground,  
 running from north-east to south-west 
 across the block, is of a limy clay   
 called Forest Marble, while in the    
 more low-lying parts the clay is often
 covered by alluvium or head. There are
 no rocky outcrops. In the extreme     
 north and east of the block there are 
 some patches of the nodular limestone 
 known as cornbrash, and this is where 
 the best arable land is found.        
                                       
 The highest point in the block is in  
 Pen Wood at about 170m. Abbots Hill   
 rises to 139m, the Closworth ridge in 
 the east to 117m. Sutton Bingham      
 reservoir is at about 60m, and        
 Halstock Church at 64m.               </content>
