		<content>  In a survey of where people shopped, 
 we found that 73% shopped in          
 Gloucester, 22% in Tewkesbury and 5%  
 in Cheltenham. Of the three main      
 supermarkets in Gloucester, we found  
 that 40% went to Tesco's, and 30% each
 to Sainsbury's and Asda.              
  There are two village shops: the Post
 Office Stores and Jakeman's. Most     
 people do some of their shopping      
 there. A mobile shop operates round   
 the area. A man also comes with fresh 
 fish and vegetables. A fish &amp; chip van
 comes to Jubilee Place on Wednesday   
 evenings. People can buy vegetables at
 two market gardens. There are two     
 garages which most people use for     
 petrol and repairs as well as buying  
 gas and coal there. Three coal        
 merchants deliver coal in this area.  
 There is also a small garden centre   
 which sells trees, shrubs and plants. </content>
