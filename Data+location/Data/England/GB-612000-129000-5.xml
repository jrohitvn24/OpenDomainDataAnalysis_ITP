		<content> Beach Estate is on the Eastern        
 outskirts of Dymchurch. There are     
 about three hundred houses on the     
 estate.  A number of services are     
 provided. The Council collects rubbish
 once a week. Help the Aged has its own
 van which comes twice or three times a
 week to take all the old people for a 
 day out. The Spastics Society comes to
 take disabled children to a special   
 school in Folkestone. The Postman     
 makes two deliveries and collections a
 day. The collections are at 8.30am and
 4.00pm. The Milkman delivers milk from
 7.00am to 8.00am. There is one        
 telephone box on the Estate. There is 
 only one shop in the Estate. It is    
 called General Stores. It sells       
 everything from sweets and Sunday     
 dinner to medical supplies. There are 
 two stops for the regular bus service 
 between Dover and Hastings.           </content>
