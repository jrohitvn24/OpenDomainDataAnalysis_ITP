		<title>18ST. BARNABAS ANGLICAN CHURCH</title>
		<content> This Anglican Church was built four   
 years ago at a cost of '325,000.Its   
 site was chosen because most of the   
 parishioners of its mother church All 
 Saints now live this end of the       
 parish. It was designed by Rod        
 Robinson assisted by the parish priest
 Rev.Hugh Broad and his wife. It has   
 two halls which have a number of      
 parish and removing a partition can be
 used to enlarge the church which      
 normally holds 60 people, enabling it 
 to hold 250. The Church was           
 consecrated by the Bishop of Hereford 
 and the church halls opened by        
 Princess Margret. The Church has a    
 bell which came from a former         
 temporary church of St. Barnabas;     
 demolished in 1968. The sanctuary     
 light designed by Mrs.Broad was a gift
 in memory of those who died in the    
 Falklands War.                        </content>
