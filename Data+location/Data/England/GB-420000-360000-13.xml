  "Birchover News" first appeared in   
 July 1977. It was started to provide  
 information and entertainment for     
 everyone in the village, to give      
 individuals the chance to write       
 articles and to help bridge the gap   
 ...between the young and the old, the 
 newcomers and the families who have   
 lived here for generations and the    
 physical separation of those who live 
 at "top end" of the village and those 
 who live down in Eagle Tor.           
  Each edition of "Birchover News" is  
 delivered free of charge to every     
 household in the village.The costs of 
 producing the paper are met almost    
 entirely by donations from villagers  
 who volunteer to "sponsor" an edition 
 This system worked well for the first 
 three years but rising costs are      
 putting a question mark on the future.</content>
