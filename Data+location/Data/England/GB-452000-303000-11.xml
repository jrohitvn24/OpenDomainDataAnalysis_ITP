 The Public transport System consists  
 of the local City bus service run by  
 the local council and a county bus    
 service called the Midland Red,this   
 serves the villages and smaller towns.
 Some of the larger firms on the       
 industrial estate have their own      
 private bus fleet which collects and  
 returns their employees from all over 
 the county.                           
 Part of the MI motorway passes through
 the block and is used by the local    
 businesses to transport goods all over
 the country.                          </content>
