		<title>19LIVESTOCK FARMING</title>
		<content> The area is suited to sheep           
 farming.The two main types of sheep   
 are the Cheviot and Border            
 Leicester.These sheep are very hardy  
 and can spend the winter out on the   
 hills.The tup is put to the ewe around
 November and the ewes lamb late March/
 early April.The sheep are fed on the  
 farms own hay,turnips and             
 concentrates.The local mart is at     
 Wooler(10 miles away).                
   There are nowhere near as many      
 cattle kept and few if any of the     
 local farms keep milking cows though  
 several have old milking parlours in  
 their buildings.Most of the cattle are
 kept as sucklers and are sold for     
 meat.Calves are born in the early     
 winter.                               
   New large sheds now mean that young 
 animals can be kept indoors during the
 first few days of life.               </content>
