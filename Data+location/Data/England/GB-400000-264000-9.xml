		<title>09THE DISTRICT SPORTS</title>
		<content> Yesterday, we had a District Sports   
 day at Mount Carmel school. 7 schools 
 were taking part competing against    
 each other,St.Stevens,St.Georges,     
 Mount Carmel,Holyoaksfield,Batchely,  
 St.Lukes and Webheath. There were 36  
 races altogether, sprint,three-legged,
 egg and spoon,hurdle,dressing-up,     
 obstacle,hoop bowling, and relays.    
 The field had been marked put in lanes
 so that everyone knew where they had  
 to run. The first races were sprints  
 followed by the egg and spoon in which
 we had to get a ball(the egg) on the  
 spoon and get to the finishing line   
 without dropping it over a distance of
 80metres. After the 22nd. race there  
 was an interval of 10 mins. when we   
 all had a drink of squash. All the    
 schools had there own area to sit in. 
 The children who had gained 1st,2nd,or
 3rd places were awarded a certificate.</content>
