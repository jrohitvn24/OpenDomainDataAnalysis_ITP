		<title>12M1 MOTORWAY MILTON KEYNES</title>
		<content> The M1 is a piece of road people use  
 to get somewhere fast.There are 3     
 lanes on each side and two hard       
 shoulders for breakdowns and  police  
 cars. The middle area is called  the  
 central reservation and it has a crash
 barrier to stop cars going onto the   
 other carriageway. No pedestrians are 
 allowed because the cars go too fast. 
 On Friday July 5th., 1985, traffic was
 counted between 10.00 a.m. and 10.15  
 a.m. These are the results: there were
 268 cars, 151 lorries, 9 coaches and 1
 motor bike using the northbound       
 carriageway i.e. 429 vehicles. On the 
 southbound carriageway there were 238 
 cars, 158 lorries, 16 coaches and 1   
 motor bike i.e.413 vehicles.
