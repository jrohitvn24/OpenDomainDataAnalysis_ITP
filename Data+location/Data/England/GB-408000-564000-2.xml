		<content>{SCOUTS (cont.)                        
  The meetings consist of things like  
 lighting fires, learning knots and    
 lashings ,how to pitch a tent, playing
 games, passing badges.Also about once 
 every two months we have a wide game  
 which is where you do various things  
 around the village like finding       
 objects and returning them to base    
 without getting caught by other scouts
  Once a year we have camp which lasts 
 for a week.In the past we have been to
 Barnard Castle,Ford Castle,Lake       
 Windermere and this year we are going 
 to Yorkshire near the Settle Carlisle 
 railway.Apart from this we also go off
 camping in our patrols.
