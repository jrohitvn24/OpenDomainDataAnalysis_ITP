		<title>07DACCOMBE VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> We realised that Daccombe is a very   
 rural area,with only few houses.It is 
 mostly fields,so the land cover survey
 is:Primary-Enclosed Rough Grazing.    
 Secondary-Intensively Managed         
 Grassland.Tertiary-Farmland-Crops     
 other than grass.Most of the cottages 
 are around the lower part of Daccombe 
 called the Hamlet.The cottages are    
 probably homes of wealthy people since
 they are well maintained and some have
 swimming pools.There is only one      
 amenity, a caravan site for holiday   
  makers.There is nothing else.The main
  traffic is tractors travelling to    
  near by farms ,local cars and a bus  
  service which travels via Daccombe   
  once a week on Wednesday which takes 
  people to Newton Abbot where a market
  is held every week. Most of the area 
  is taken up with fields with only a  
 few cottages and little amenities.    </content>
