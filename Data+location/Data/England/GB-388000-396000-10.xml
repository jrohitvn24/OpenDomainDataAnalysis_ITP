		<title>10Gorton Community Centre</title>
		<content> Gorton Community Centre has been      
 running for eight years. It is small, 
 well established and very friendly.   
 Daytime activities include pre-school 
 playgroups, womens keep fit, mums and 
 tots afternoons, indoor bowls, and an 
 over 50's club. The social work and   
 welfare rights officer calls on a     
 Thursday afternoon. Evening activities
 include indoor bowls, keep fit, junior
 and senior youth clubs, a club for the
 mentally handicapped and a disco for  
 7_14 year olds on a Friday evening.   
 The Centre works with local schools to
 do comunity work.                     
 I like the Centre.It is good fun.I'm  
 cooking on 27th June.I'm going to take
 my own ingredients and then take the  
 buns home to share.You can play games 
 like cluedo,dominoes and cards. There 
 is a man who is 74 years old who plays
 table tennis. He is good.             </content>
