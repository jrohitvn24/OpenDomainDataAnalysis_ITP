		<content> Families will spend a whole day on the
 Estuary. Tourists and some locals are 
 often sceptical about 1)The warning   
 signs for flooded roads...cars often  
 get marooned and 2) the warnings about
 the strong currents and unstable      
 sands...there have been several       
 drownings in recent years.            
 Unfortunately, on a fine day, the     
 estuary looks very inviting. Footpaths
 in the area are Burn's Lonning, The   
 King's Arms to Shore via  iron        
 ladder, and The Banks-a medieval      
 rampart on the highest part of the    
 village. The Banks gives views of     
 Scotland and marvellous sunsets.
