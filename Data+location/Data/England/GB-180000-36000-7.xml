		<title>07ROSE HILL - THE THOMAS'S</title>
		<content>   Rose Hill ws originally built by the
 Thomas family who have lived in Mylor 
 fo over 300 years.                    
   Seven people built the road,        
 including father and sons (all        
 Thomas's). Once the road was complete 
 one Thomas asked his father for Â£1000 
 so as to build a terrace of houses in 
 Rose Hill. His father refused him the 
 money so he went to Mrs Holman who    
 lived at Restronguet Farm, she lent   
 him the Â£1000 for Â£5 on every Â£100    
 paid back. He was then able to build  
 his terrace of houses on Rose Hill.   
    Seventy-five years ago nobody      
 except the Thomas family lived on Rose
 Hill.
