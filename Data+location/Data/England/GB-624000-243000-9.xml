		<content>The main objective of the work at the  
Laboratories is to give customers      
better services at lower cost.The scope
of the research is wide and varied.    
Silicon Integrated Circuits - there are
facilities to fabricate intigrated     
circuits using NMOS, CMOS and ECL      
techniques. Custom-intigrated circuits 
with up to 30,000 transistors on a     
single chip have been produced.        
A computer-aided design system has been
developed to utilise these advanced    
silicon technologies.                  
Galliun Arsenide devices - Specific    
circuit designs for high-speed digital 
systems are being developed and the use
of gallium indium arsenide material is 
being studied.                         
Optical Communications-British Telecom 
has led the world in developing fibre  
technology with it's double crucible   
process.                               </content>
