		<title>03A PUBLICAN'S DAY</title>
		<content> We interviewed the landlord of the    
 COACH and HORSES, Mr.Ronald Marsh, and
 asked him to describe a typical day in
 his life.                             
 Mr. Marsh told us that he starts work 
 at about 8.00 am and goes to bed at   
 1.00 pm.                              
 He starts by cleaning the pub and     
 getting the shelves stocked with      
 bottles. Then he opens the pub at     
 11.00 am and is busy from 11.30 am    
 to 3.00 pm. He serves drinks and food 
 to the customers, with a smile, and is
 pleasant with everyone. He closes the 
 pub at 3.30 pm and reopens at 5.00 pm.
 He stops serving drinks at 11.00 pm   
 and washes up and tidys up before he  
 goes to bed at 1.00 am.
