		<content> A group of us, while working on this  
 project, saw two men with Springer    
 Spaniels, who were called Honey and   
 Jenny.One of the men had a shot gun   
 with under and over barrelsanda size  
 seven cartridge. We saw some rabbit   
 holes and a dead rabbit. The farmer   
 went through the corn with his dogs   
 to see if there were some rabbits so  
 they would be driven into the holes.  
 The other man had a spoon tied onto a 
 shaft and he had a tin with poison in.
 He put the poison down a rabbit hole. 
 I found out that when the poison      
 hit moisture it turns into a gas.     
 My Dad told me that the poison is     
 called Cymag which is a white powder. 
 I think that some of the wild rabbits 
 should be gassed because they eay away
 the shoots of corn. You don't want to 
 gas all the rabbits because they will 
 eat the weeds as well.                </content>
