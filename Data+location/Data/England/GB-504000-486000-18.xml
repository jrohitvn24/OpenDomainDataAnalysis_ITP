		<title>18A Day In My Life (1)</title>
		<content> On{Saturdays}I wake up at about 8.00  
 a.m. and have breakfast. Then my      
 brothers and I go, with my Mum, down  
 to the{harbour}to load one of the     
 fishing boats with ice. We work with  
 the skipper's son while my Mum goes to
 her work. The first job is to get 350 
 fish boxes aboard. This is done with  
 the help if a{hydraulic crane,}but    
 it's still hard work. Next ice comes  
 down a chute from the{jetty ice       
{factory,}and it is shovelled down to  
 the freezer room. When the morning's  
 work is finished we all go and have   
 dinner at the skipper's house, and    
 after a while Mum comes and we all go 
 home. The rest of the afternoon I     
 spend{riding bikes}with my next door  
 neighbour and my Dad until it's time  
 for tea. In the evening I{read}or     
{watch television}until bedtime.
