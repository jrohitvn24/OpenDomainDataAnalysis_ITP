		<title>08The effects of the war</title>
		<content> There were three bombs dropped on     
 Redcar during the war. One of the     
 bombs came to land on the Zetland Club
 killing the Mayor of Redcar, some     
 councillors and other prominent       
 citizens. If it had not been for a    
 special Council meeting many more     
 councillors would have been killed as 
 they frequently met in the Club.      
                                       
 Ten years after the war the site was  
 made into an ornamental garden. The   
 garden stands out because the road    
 consists of terraced houses with no   
 gardens.                              
                                       
 Opposite the garden, on the site of   
 the old Council Offices, is the town's
 War Memorial.
