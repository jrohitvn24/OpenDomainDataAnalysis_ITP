need for increased housing stock to    
include property for "First Time       
Buyers", "Medium or Family" homes,     
"Cottages", "House for the Elderly",   
and "Council Housing". There is little 
expressed demand for "Large" housing.

expressed need for development within  
the village; development should take   
place on the outskirts, with some      
suitable "in filling".                 
Types of Development:There was an ex-  
pressed opposition to "Estate Develop- 
ment","Town Type Dwellings",and        
"Industrial Development"; there was    
also an expressed need to provide more 
opportunities for local employment.    </content>
