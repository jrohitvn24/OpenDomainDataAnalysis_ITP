		<title>01THE MARSHWOOD VALE</title>
		<content> Broadoak and district is a rural area 
 with farming being the main           
 employment. It is good grass-growing  
 land with many small copses and ponds.
 The southern side of the block is a   
 steep hill flattening out towards the 
 north into small fields enclosed by   
 hedges including many oak trees, a    
 feature of the Marshwood Vale. The    
 farms are small, approximately 150    
 acres, and dairying is the main       
 enterprise with some sheep and pigs.  
 The largest employer is a farm making 
 Traditional Farmhouse Cheddar with    
 bacon pigs fed on whey, the cheese    
 by-product, a traditional West Dorset 
 cycle. Creeds the Printers are the    
 main non-agricultural employers. Many 
 families in the block go back several 
 generations, and as yet we have only  
 two or three holiday cottages. The    
 Broadoak Village Hall is a focal point</content>
