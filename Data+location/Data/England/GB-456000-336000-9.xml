		<content>    The{Precinct}is important because  
 people use it to shop in, rather than 
 go to town, and to meet other people. 
 There are two rows of shops. On one   
 side there is a bank, a video shop, a 
 newsagent and sweet shop, a           
 supermarket, a beauty salon, a clothes
 shop, a Post Office and a betting     
 shop. On the other side there is a    
 chip shop, a carpet store, a chemist, 
 an optician, a grocer's shop and a    
 pub. Also there is a Methodist Church.
 Many people meet and talk for ages in 
 the Precinct. Teenagers play on their 
 skateboards, roller skates and their  
 bikes, which drives people mad,       
 especially old people.
