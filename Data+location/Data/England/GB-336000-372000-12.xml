		<title>12CAPENHURST SCHOOLYARD GAMES</title>
		<content> Schoolyard games have changed little  
 in 25 years and do not reflect the    
 increased sophistication of toys ie.  
 computers &amp; electronic games have not 
 had much effect though the influence  
 of television is visible.The school is
 small so pupils of different ages and 
 sexes usually play together.Here are  
 the ten most popular games(type of    
 game shown in brackets).Three Bad Eggs
 (ball)Captain On Board(position)Ball  
 Tick(chase &amp; ball)Three And You're In 
 (ball)Rounders(ball)Spot(ball)Televisi
 on(quiz)British Bulldog(chase)I Wrote 
 A Letter(chase)Icky 1-2-3(hide &amp; seek)
 Skipping games are popular with both  
 boys &amp; girls also.Two children operate
 the long rope and othes have to run in
 and skip to standard rhymes such as   
 Hot Cross Buns,Cowboy Joe and         
 Red,Yellow,Purple and Green.
