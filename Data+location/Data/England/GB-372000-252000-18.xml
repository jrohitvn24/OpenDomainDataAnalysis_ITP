		<content>  At 1o'clock we had lunch and washed  
 up.We went for a walk to see the      
 Eastnor Monument, which is an obelisk 
 erected in memory of the son of the   
 man who built Eastnor Castle.When we  
 got back from our walk we played some 
 games until tea.Afterwards we had a   
 camp-fire.At a camp-fire we sing songs
 and choruses and tell jokes.Then it   
 was time for bed as it was 10:30pm.   
  On Sunday morning soon after         
 breakfast we took down the            
 tents,whilst they were still dry.We   
 cleaned the tent pegs and packed      
 everything away.We spent the rest of  
 the morning until lunch playing games.
 We visited Eastnor Castle in the      
 afternoon.There are stuffed animals   
 and suits of armour.We went back to   
 camp for tea We had had an enjoyable  
 time and our tent had come second in  
 the "Best Kept Tent" competition!     </content>
