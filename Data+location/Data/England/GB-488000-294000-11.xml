		<title>11A GRETTON FARM 1945 AND 1985</title>
		<content>  Machinery used on farms has developed
greatly since 1945. Grass was cut by   
mowing machines pulled by two horses,  
the farmer sitting on a metal seat.    
After a fortnight in the sun, and being
turned occasionally, the hay was put   
into haycocks, which were later made   
into stacks. So, too, with harvesting. 
Self-binders cut the corn and tied it  
into sheaves, which were made into     
stooks of eight sheaves to dry out.    
They were then stored in Dutch barns   
until a threshing machine visited the  
farm to thresh the wheat and bale the  
straw. Men, women and children all     
helped in the hay and corn. All cows   
were milked by hand, the milk sieved   
and cooled, and delivered from a churn.
Forty years later, grass is cut and put
straight into siloes, corn is dealt    
with by combined harvesters, and cows  
are milked by machines.                </content>
