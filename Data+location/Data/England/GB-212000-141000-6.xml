		<content> In 1972 the Polar Bear was purchased  
 by the Landmark Trust.It now operates 
 from Biddiford (previously from       
 Ilfracombe).She was built in Denmark  
 in 1960 for the Greenland trade and   
 although ideal for supplies it can    
 only carry 12 passengers.             
 A dorry called The Islander,specially 
 built in 1981 for Â£40,000,partly fills
 this need. It acts as the island's    
 'taxi' and can take visitors round the
 island and on fishing trips.It's      
 impressively fast and very well       
 equipped.                             
 The island also owns a Yorkshire      
 cobble and a landing craft to get     
 goods and passengers to the shore.    
  The paddle steamer Waverley makes    
 about 14 sailings in the summer from  
 Ilfracombe and sometimes Biddiford.
