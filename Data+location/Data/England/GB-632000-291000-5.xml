		<title>05Broome Heath</title>
		<content>   On the 17th we went to Broome. We   
 crossed the heath where Mr.Weston dug 
 a hole. It was bad soil for crops it  
 had alot of sand &amp; stones in it,but it
 is good for gravel, as proof there are
 gravel pits full of water &amp; fish.One  
 night during the war a spitfire       
 crashed on the heath &amp; you can still  
 see an empty pit.The heath is peaceful
 to cross there are only the sounds of 
 birds,dogs &amp; people.There are humps   
 which are called communial barrows.A_ 
 long time ago the stone age people    
 buried their dead &amp; tools in these,   
 they are rare &amp; people who excavate   
 them will be punished.We stopped at   
 the old railway line &amp; saw willow     
 saplings that are taken to be made    
 into the best cricket bats.Then we    
 stopped at the water works it pumps   
 water to Suffolk to be made into      
 drinking water.Broome is a nice place.</content>
