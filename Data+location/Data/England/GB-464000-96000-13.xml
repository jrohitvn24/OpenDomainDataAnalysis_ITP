		<title>13SOUTHSEA SHOPPING SURVEY</title>
		<content>    In order to find out some of the   
 attitudes of people using{Palmerston  
{Road,}we prepared a questionnaire. We 
 were put in four separate groups and  
 posted at the corners of the Shopping 
 precinct.Altogether 125 people were   
 interviewed by us. After completing   
 the survey we changed the results into
 percentages. 96% of people thought    
 that it was a good idea that the road 
 was a pedestrian precinct. 64% of     
 people were satisfied with the variety
 of shops whilst 36% did not think     
 there was an adequate variety. We     
 asked the members of the public       
 whether they considered prices in     
 Palmerston Road to be higher than     
 elsewhere. 36% of people thought they 
 were ,whilst 64% thought they were no 
 higher than elsewhere. Finally 80%  of
 the people preferred Palmerston Road  
 to Commercial Road in Portsmouth.     </content>
