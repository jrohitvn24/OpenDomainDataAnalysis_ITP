Today the following provide employment 
for some of the                        
villagers:-shops,farms,a toy factory,a 
firm producing animal food,a gravel    
pit working and a riding school.The    
rest of the working population has to  
find work elsewhere. A questionaire    
was sent to the homes of the children  
attending Ringstead School.From the 71 
returned the following statistics were 
compiled. 71 men and 45 women were     
employed.The men all worked full-time  
but 30 women worked part-time.Only 4   
men work in the village and 67 travel  
a distance ranging from 2kms to        
400kms. Of the women, 15 work in       
Ringstead and only 10 travel more than 
30kms.
