		<title>03Slindon College Horse Racing</title>
		<content> Slindon College, an Independent boys  
 boarding school, is well known for its
 National Hunt Racing Stables. This is 
 because we are the only school in the 
 country to have racing stables.       
 There are at the moment 12 horses in  
 the stables, of which 6 race.The 6    
 which race are called Ziparib,Mighty  
 Steel,First Glance,White Nile,Burn's  
 Lad and Rheingold's Gift.The most     
 successful horse we have is Ziparib.  
 The cost for all 12 horses a year is  
 Â£55,000,which includes their daily    
 feed,bedding and other little extras. 
 It is a good thing they pay for       
 themselves!                           
 The racing silks are red,white and    
 blue diamonds,and white sleeves and   
 cap.                                  
 There are 4 boys from the school who  
 work in the stables,one of whom is    
 applying for his jockey's licence.    </content>
