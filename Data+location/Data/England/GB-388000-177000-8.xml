		<title>08Stanton St Quintin School</title>
		<content> In{Victorian}times Stanton School was 
 built. There was only the one building
 but they put a curtain to divide it   
 into two. We interviewed{Mrs Drew}who 
 was at Stanton School when she was    
 young and she told us about the       
 School.                               
 They gave the children cod-liver oil  
 to nourish them. The{lessons}they had 
 were Arithmetic, Scripture, Handicraft
 (Sewing and Embriodary), Painting,    
 Times Table Test, Spelling Test and   
 Gloy (glueing). The children always   
 wore a{pinafore}to go over their      
 clothes so they would not get them    
 dirty and the pinafore was easier to  
 wash. The children always wore leather
 shoes and a rubber over-shoe called   
{galoshes.}The school has still got the
{bell}that was on the roof of Mrs Banks
 class room and it is now in the       
 Library for every one to see it.      </content>
