		<content>  In{East Herrington}there is a wide   
 variety of styles of houses. We found 
 detached, semi-detached, bungalows,   
 flats and terraced houses. Each house 
 has a front and rear garden. The      
 majority also have a garage. Most of  
 the houses are built of brick with    
 slate roofs.                          
                                       
  Between two housing estates there is 
 a large open area set aside for       
 industrial development. There are     
 roads, streetlights, gas and water    
 mains but up to now there is no sign  
 of building.                          
{                                      
{ Tunstall Lodge Farm}has a number of  
 fields which are used for growing     
 barley and hay. There is a small      
 riding school for local children.
