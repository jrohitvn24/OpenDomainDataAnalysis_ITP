		<content> The church of St.Mary and St.Peter,   
 Wilmington is a typical downland      
 church. It has been standing since the
 12th Century. Originally it was made  
 of wood but today it is made of       
 stone.The churchyard has certainly    
 been in use since Norman times and the
 oldest grave dates from 1707.         
                                       
 You enter the church through a 14th   
 Century door and on your right is a   
 14th Century font. The Nave was       
 rebuilt in the 14th Century and the   
 Gothic Chancel Arch was erected in the
 19th Century.                         
                                       
 In the North Chapel is the Bee and    
 Butterfly Window,a fine piece of      
 stained glass probably of 15th Century
 Flemish origin. In the centre is St.  
 Peter and around him are 8            
 butterflies,one moth and a bee.       </content>
