		<title>11MY WEEKEND AT HOME</title>
		<content>  I am 9 years old and my brother is 6.
 At the weekend we like to stay in bed 
 till 9a.m. After breakfast we go out  
 in the garden and play on our bikes   
 while Dad is cutting the lawn and     
 weeding the flower beds. Mum goes to  
 Fakenham shopping in her car.Lunch on 
 Saturday is my favourite- fish&amp;chips. 
 After lunch we go swimming at Dereham 
 and I like playing games such as      
 picking up the goggles from the bottom
 of the pool. When we have had tea we  
 watch television until it is time for 
 bed at 8 o'clock.                     
  On Sunday, if the weather is fine,   
 Dad likes to cook a barbecue for      
 dinner in the garden. We often all go 
 for a bike ride and have tea with Nan 
 and Grandad. We like to have egg and  
 cheese salad and doughnuts. We come   
 home at 7p.m.and have a bath and hair 
 wash ready for school next day.       </content>
