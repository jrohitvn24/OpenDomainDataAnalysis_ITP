		<content> This{dairy}farm represents a number of
 small {farming}enterprises in this    
 area.The study was made by an         
 interview with the farmer and         
 examination of the farm.The farm is in
 the middle of Warton.The farmhouse    
 stands among other buildings on the   
 main road,Austrey Road.The{fields}run 
 down in a strip about 250 metres wide 
 behind the farmhouse.The land is quite
 low and and fairly well drained.The   
 farm has been passed from father to   
 son.Mr Willis' grandfather owned the  
 farm first.The farm was 32 hectares   
 altogether.In the fields they grow    
 grass,corn and potatoes.The grass     
 covers 20 hectares and once the grass 
 is cut it is stored as silage for the{
{cows}to eat in the winter.Another 6   
 hectares are used to grow corn which  
 is ground and fed to the{cattle.}
