		<title>01HOW TO PLAY MARBLES</title>
		<content> Two or more players have a marble     
 each.                                 
 One player rolls his or her marble    
 towards a pot(a pot is a shallow hole 
 in the ground).The other person rolls 
 his or her marble.The person that gets
 closest or in the pot has the first   
 go.If both people get their marble    
 into the pot they start again.There   
 are two ways to make the marble move. 
 One is thumbing, one is               
 shoving.Thumbing is where you push    
 down on the marble and let it slip    
 forward.Shoving is pushing it with    
 your index finger.The first person to 
 get both marbles into the pot is the  
 winner.People can play for keeps or   
 for lends.Keeps is if you win,lends is
 whoever wins gives the other person   
 their marble back to{them.
