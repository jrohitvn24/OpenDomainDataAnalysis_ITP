		<title>02The Quaker Settlement 1700-</title>
		<content> One of the most interesting           
 features of the area is The Quaker    
 Settlement at High Flats. It is       
 possible to miss this historic        
 settlement as you travel along the    
 main road to Huddersfield as it is    
 tucked down a small road. The site    
 was founded by Jonh Firth of Shepley, 
 who was a follower of George Fox; the 
 founder of the quaker religion.       
 The Quaker Meeting House is where all 
 the quakers used to meet. Next to the 
 meeting house is the burial ground    
 which is still used to this day by the
 quakers. The earliest grave is about  
 1660 and the latest grave is 1982.    
 The quakers real name is the Society  
 of Friends. They got their name the   
 quakers because they said "quake and  
 tremble at the name of thy lord".
