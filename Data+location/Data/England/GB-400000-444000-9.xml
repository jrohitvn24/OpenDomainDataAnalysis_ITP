  We went to the river bank and we     
 climbed over the stile. Then we went  
 over a gate and to the stream running 
 under the bridge. We jumped over it.  
 We walked round to the other bit of   
 the bridge and jumped back over the   
 water. We carried on walking and came 
 to an island. Mr. Ackroyd said we     
 could paddle. We went into a field    
 where there were some tree stumps. In 
 the next field there were some bulls. 
 Mr. Ackroyd said "Keep to the levee." 
 He told us that a levee is a bank     
 made to stop flooding.                
  In the next field we saw sycamore and
 ash trees. We then saw a hole in the  
 bank where we thought a rabbit lived. 
 On the way back we picked some flowers
 to press.
