		<title>06   THE TREAT--SHIREMOOR.</title>
		<content> In July, in the field near the cross  
roads south of Backworth, the Shiremoor
Treat is held every year.The Treat is a
continuation of a miners'tradition     
started 78years ago when a Mr Niven and
a few other men got together at the pit
heap near the Blue Bell and decided to 
do something for the minerÂ£s kids i.e. 
Â£a treat'.                             
  Today the Treat is for all the local 
school children.Jazz Bands march from  
the villages to the Treat field and as 
 they go the children follow.During the
 day the children take part in football
day the children take part in races and
football and netball matches.All the   
chidren who go to the treat are given a
bag of sweets, a drink and and an      
ice-cream.A travelling fair completes  
the festivities.                       
   The tradition continues even though 
the pits have gone.                    </content>
