		<content> In his spare time he helps to look    
 after his yound children and goes clay
 pigeon shooting.                      
 His equipment includes his panda car, 
 enabling him to cover large areas.    
 This is why Cromhall lost its own     
 police station. He carries a          
 truncheon, although he has never hit  
 anyone with it in his ten years with  
 the police. He also has a torch,      
 wellington boots, handcuffs and a     
 radio, which he can use to contact    
 other branches of the police.         
 One such unit is the forensic science 
 unit. Once they helped convict a man  
 charged with hitting another man with 
 a lemonade bottle. Tiny bits of glass 
 were found on the man's clothes. The  
 entire bottle was rebuilt and the     
 missing bits were found to match.
