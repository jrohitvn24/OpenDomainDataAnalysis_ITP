		<content>  Every Summer visitors to Eastnor     
 village set up camp in the{local park.
  Most of the tents and caravans are   
 parked near the four big ponds. Quite 
 often the campers bring along small   
 boats and fishing gear which they use 
 on the water. On  warm summer days    
 some of the younger people  are       
 tempted by the village children to    
 join them in a swim.                  
   Different groups of people of all   
 ages come to stay.They include Cubs,  
 Brownies,Guides and scouts.In the park
 there lives a{herd of deer.}These are 
 very popular with the campers,        
 especially Corrie who is very tame.   
 The main attraction for the tourists, 
 is{the castle}in the village.         
   Another favourite walk for the more 
 energetic is to{the Obelisk}which is  
 situated on Mid-Summer Hill.
