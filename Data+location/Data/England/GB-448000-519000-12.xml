		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE 2</title>
		<content>    After playtime it is maths. It is  
 my favourite lesson. My maths teacher 
 is Mr. Field. At 11.45 it is team     
 assembly, and at 12.00 it is          
 lunchtime. I go home for dinner with  
 Farhat.                               
    At 12.45 Farhat comes and calls for
 me, and on the way to school we buy   
 some things to eat. At 1.00 it is Art,
 and I enjoy doing art as well as      
 maths. At the moment I am doing       
 calligraphy in art. At 2.30 it is     
 breaktime, and I play rounders with my
 friends.                              
    After break we do our Environmental
 Studies. At 3.30 it is hometime and I 
 walk with Farhat and my other friends.
 Tea is ready when I get home, and I   
 often have samosas and pakoras. If it 
 is a hot day we sit on the grass and  
 have ice-cream and drinks
