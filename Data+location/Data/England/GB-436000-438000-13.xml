		<content> The Main Street in Thorner is classed 
 as a 'B' road and it leads southwards 
 to the main A64 Leeds-York trunk road.
 The village is linked by a half hourly
 bus service to Wetherby and to Leeds. 
 By this means Thorner is linked to    
 nearby villages of Bramham, Boston    
 Spa, Thorp Arch and the towns of      
 Tadcaster and Wetherby.               
 There was a railway from Leeds to     
 Wetherby, but this was closed in the  
 1960's. Embankments, bridges and the  
 track bed were still to be seen in    
 places in 1985. The site of the       
 railway station has a cul-de-sac of   
 houses, named Beeching Close. {(Lord  
{Beeching was the minister who closed  
{the railway). }                       
 The need for public transport has     
 lessened as more people in Thorner and
 district use private transport like   
 cars, bicycles etc.                   </content>
