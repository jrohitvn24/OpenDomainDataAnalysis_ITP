		<title>11AYLMERTON 'SHRIEKING PITS'</title>
		<content>  North Norfolk abounds with folklore  
 and superstitions.  Aylmerton{'shriek-
{ing pits'}are so-called because of a  
 legend that the{ghostly figure}of a   
 woman in white has been seen weeping  
 and wailing among them.               
  It is not clear where these pits were
 located.  One report refers to a      
 number of hollows around Roman Camp   
 which could have been{prehistoric     
{dwellings. }Alternatively, they may   
 have been south of the village, and   
 been old{marl-pits. }Of a reported    
 2000, most have disappeared through   
 cultivation.  The Roman Camp area is  
 thickly wooded and has not been       
 cultivated.                           
  South of the village, 5 large pits in
 open farmland could be all that remain
 of the 'shrieking pits'.              
  Beware of the sound of the 'shrieking
 pits' after dark in Aylmerton!        </content>
