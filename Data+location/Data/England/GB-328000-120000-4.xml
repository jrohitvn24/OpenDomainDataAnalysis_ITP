		<title>04THE SCOUTS _ HATCH BEAUCHAMP</title>
		<content>   The Scouts meet on Tuesdays at the  
 Huish Camp Site in Huish Woods, in the
 summer and at West Hatch Scout Hut, in
 the winter.                           
   Every year the Scouts have a major  
 camping trip. In 1986, they are aiming
 to climb the three highest mountains  
 in the British Isles: Snowdon, Ben    
 Nevis and Scafell Pike.               
   The Scouts are allowed to carry     
 knives,the Cubs are not. The Scouts   
 meet at 19.00 and dismissal is at     
 21.00. The full uniform is a green    
 shirt and trousers,a belt and a beret.
 Usually during Scout meetings,we learn
 something useful,like how to skin and 
 cook a rabbit or how to put up a tent.
 Later on we play a game like "Dicky   
 Blow the Whisle" and then sometimes we
 learn something else.
