		<content>    I like{Rushenden}because it's open 
 and airy. You can go anywhere, like up
 the seawall. On the green by the      
 mud-flats you can play football and   
 all different kinds of games. Then    
 there's the Fleet. You can go         
 freshwater fishing and it's usually   
 quiet and peaceful. You can go from   
 the mud-flats to the seawall and it   
 leads to the Fleet.                   
                                       
    There is an allotment at the bottom
 of my house. On the fence there are   
 lots of lizards. They are mostly      
 pregnant. I can catch them with my    
 hands and feed them for a while until 
 I let them go.
