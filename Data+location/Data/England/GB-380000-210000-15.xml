		<title>15A VILLAGE MUM'S DAY - 3</title>
		<content> The dog and I enjoy our walk. We need 
 to cross the railway line but first   
 have to let a dirty goods train by.   
 Safely in the field, Shanty runs after
 the rabbits but never catches them. We
 arrive home; dog and mistress have a  
 cold drink before the latter gets out 
 the vacuum cleaner. This time I really
 do buzz round and get some jobs done. 
  It's 1 o'clock and news time - and my
 lunch break. A piece of cheese and an 
 apple will keep me going a little     
 longer. Some of the vegetable patch   
 gets weeded. I like to work in the    
 garden because it calms me if I'm in a
 temper (which today I am not).        
  It's nearly 3 o'clock now and time   
 for the girls to come home. I like to 
 stand at the school gate and watch    
 them come out. Today they go to a     
 friend's as I run a Brownie pack on   
 Mondays and clean the school early.   </content>
