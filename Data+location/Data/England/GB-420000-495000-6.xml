		<content> The farmhouses, owned by the County   
 Council, are well maintained. The     
 tenants decorate the interior         
 themselves whereas council tradesmen  
 are employed to preserve the exterior.
 Private farm owners are encouraged to 
 keep their property in good order and 
 there is no farmstead dereliction in  
 this area, The council housing estate 
 at Tunstall is kept up to standard,   
 the woodwork e.t.c. being repaired    
 whenever necessary, A large percentage
 of houses are owner occupied and to   
 make any major changes to any property
 requires planning permission, the     
 older type houses are built of        
 Yorkshire stone, more modern day      
 houses are pebble dashed or built of  
 red brick. All roofing tyles must     
 conform to the type laid down by the  
 council policy.                       
                                       </content>
