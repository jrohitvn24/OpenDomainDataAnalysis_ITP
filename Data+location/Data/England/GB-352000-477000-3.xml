 AND DADS EVEN TRAVEL TO NORTHERN      
 IRELAND,SCOTLAND AND THE CHANNEL      
 ISLANDS.IN HOLME MOST PEOPLE TRAVEL BY
 CAR.THIS IS BECAUSE THE M6 MOTORWAY IS
 RIGHT BEHIND OUR SCHOOL.SOME CYCLE TO 
 WORK.YOU CAN GET A BUS FROM HOLME TO  
 MANY PLACES BUT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE    
 OVER ON THE WAY.IF YOU WANT TO GO TO  
 THE NEAREST AIRPORT YOU GO TO         
 BLACKPOOL.NOT MANY PEOPLE GO BY       
 TRAIN.THERE IS NO STATION IN HOLME ANY

 OXENHOLME.IF YOU WANTED TO TRAVEL BY  
 BOAT YOU WOULD CATCH IT AT HEYSHAM OR 
 NEWCASTLE.
