		<content>   The farmer at Foote Farm has got 80 
 acres of land and he has got a dairy  
 herd.He has got 25 British Friesians  
 and 90 breeding ewes that produce     
 about 120 lambs.Mr Norman used to milk
 his cows by hand 30 years ago.There is
 a farmers saying, sheer your sheep in 
 June, sheer your lambs in July.A      
 sheepdog is essential to gather up the
 sheep.Mr Norman has lived on the farm 
 53 years and his favourite animals are
 the Friesian cow and the sheep.He     
 grows 5 acres of oats,5 acres of      
 barley and 2 acres of fodderbeet.Mr   
 Norman likes the farm because it is   
 interesting and he likes to be in the 
 fresh air all the time.The type of    
 sheepdog he has got is a collie called
 Bonzo.                                
   Forty years ago their were no       
 tractors there were only horses.
