		<title>15Clubs in Malhamdale</title>
		<content> In Airton there is an active and      
 enthusiastic Women's Institute,plus a 
 weekly painting class.A needlework    
 class is held sporadically at Kirkby  
 Malham School,although this has become
 less popular in recent years.There is 
 also a Youth Club held in Kirkby      
 Malham Village Hall,and sometimes a   
 badminton club.The local pub in Kirkby
 Malham boasts both a darts and a      
 dominoes team which travel to nearby  
 pubs throughout the Winter.           
                                       
 Education in Malhamdale               
 There is only one school in the       
 block-Kirkby Malham Primary,and this  
 gathers its pupils from the whole     
 dale.The children from the dale must  
 then travel to Skipton (10 miles) or  
 Settle (7 miles) for secondary        
 education.
