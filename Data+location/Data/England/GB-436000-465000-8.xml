		<title>08THE RAILWAY</title>
		<content> In Boroughbridge there was a railway. 
 It ran through lots of different      
 village starting at Harrogate and     
 going through Knaresbough then through
 Moor End and Stavely and Rocliffe and 
 finally ending up at boroughbridge. It
 then went through Braferton to join   
 the main railway, the main railway is 
 still standing.                       
   One day along time ago a small boy  
 was going to catch a train at         
 Boroughbridge.He was running when he  
 suddenly fell and was run over by a   
 train. I believe that I can hear his  
 ghost on windy days.He was killed in  
 June or July. The railway closed in   
 1959.Today the railway embankment has 
 been dug up to build houses on.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
