		<content>   I am Kathryn Elworthy and I live    
 with my family on{Dennington Farm.}My 
 dad has been a farmer all his life. We
 have 232 acres and the buildings are  
 down the road from our house which was
 built in 1849.  We start hay-making   
 about the first week in July and we   
 keep our hay for the cows and sheep.  
 We don't do silage but we do grow     
 potatoes, corn and of course grass.   
 We sell or cows and sheep at market.  
 It is really nice living on a farm    
                                       
  {My name is John Stanbury and I live 
{with my family on}Halmpstone Farm.{My 
{dad is a dairy farmer with 260 acres  
{and around 50 cows. Dad milks the cows
{for five days and Tim, one of the farm
{workers, milks them the other two.    
{Besides cows we have a bull. We have  
{three tractors and lots more farm     
{machinery. }                          </content>
