		<content> The Post Office  is a room in Holly   
 Cottage in the centre of Winster      
 village, where usual sub-post office  
 business is transacted. General news  
 is also avialable, certain items of   
 food can be obtained, also soft drinks
 and ice-cream. There are four kiosks  
 in the valley all painted red and     
 easily found, but not obtrusive in the
 landscape. The instrument in the      
 "Brown Horse" may be used by courtesy 
 of the staff in the bar but it is not 
 a pay phone. It is usually apparent   
 when a house has its own, and most of 
 the private houses have one, and also 
 the farms, many of which have an      
 outside bell.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
