{Ladybirds:}This club is for females of
 all ages and was formed three years   
 ago. The object of this is to enable  
 the women to get together once a      
 month and meet socially. Visits,talks 
 and outings are arranged : the aim was
 to be a locally centred activity.     
                                       
{Women's Institute:}This group meets   
 monthly in the Village Hall and has 29
 members. Apart from the regular       
 meetings other demonstrations are     
 arranged for the whole village. The   
 latest demonstration was on Microwave 
 Cooking.
