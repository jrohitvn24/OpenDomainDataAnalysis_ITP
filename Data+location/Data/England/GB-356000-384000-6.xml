		<content>{Bill Kitching}-Rose Farm,Moore breeds 
 Shire Horses.His stock is 5 mares-they
 have no stallion.Any shoeing is done  
 at Beeston since the village          
 blacksmith died.Bill is taciturn.His  
 brother Ernie provided much of this   
 information.Both men are remarkably   
 hard working.They started work the    
 hard way at ages 7 and 9 when their   
 father faced the loss of his farm due 
 to his 'capital partner'pulling out of
 the business.They are never idle.     
 Bill's aim is to beat all             
 competitors.They sell mostly to the   
 U.S.A. for bloodstocks.Their shires   
 are black with white blaze and four   
 white legs.Sometimes the American     
 buyers want "greys".Yearlings or 2    
 year olds can fetch as much as Â£5000 -
 Â£7000.The Shire Horse Society Magazine
 features the Kitchings Shire Pedigree 
 as "Moore's Gay"                      </content>
