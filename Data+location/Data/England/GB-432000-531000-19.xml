		<title>19SCHOOL CHRISTMAS CONCERT</title>
		<content> Most years the school puts on a       
 concert to which parents and friends  
 are invited. Each child in the school 
 takes part in some way or another.    
 Every class has something to do which 
 links in with the main theme. There is
 always singing, acting and comedy.    
 There are lots of practices the week  
 before the show is performed and all  
 the classes are involved in making    
 costumes and scenery. Many of the     
 parents also help especially with the 
 costumes.                             
 We usually have two performances one  
 in the afternoon and the other in the 
 evening. Most children feel nervous   
 and excited before they perform in    
 front of their parents and friends.   
 Quite often special lighting is hired 
 to give better effects. Last year we  
 used a machine which made it look as  
 though it was snowing.                </content>
