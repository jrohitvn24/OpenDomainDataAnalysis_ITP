		<title>16OFFA'S DYKE</title>
		<content> The Dyke was built by King Offa's men 
 because the Welsh kept on taking the  
 cows and sheep.The Dyke is 80 miles   
 long from Prestattyn to Chepstow,but  
 the footpath is 160 miles long.Alot   
 of people walk the part of the Dyke   
 which is in the Selattyn area.The Dyke
 is a pretty place to walk because     
 there is quite alot of wildlife to be 
 seen. Such as rabbits,foxes and       
 badgers.The Dyke is about 12feet but  
 in some places it is 20feet.About 300 
 people walk the whole dyke each year. 
               The trees at the higher 
 points are mostly conifers. Few houses
 can be seen from theDyke,but quite    
 alot of farms &amp; farm buildings.       
 From the Dyke all you can see are     
 rivers,fern and grassland.The Dyke is 
 a steep bank with a ditch on one side.
 Now the Dyke is grass covered and     
 sheep graze on the bank.              </content>
