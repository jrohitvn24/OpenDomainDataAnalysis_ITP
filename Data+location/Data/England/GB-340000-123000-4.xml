 steam roller would roll it backwards  
 and forwards to flatten it. There

  There were eleven farms here then and
 a large one at Midelney.  Now there   
 are only  four in the village.  We had
 a blacksmith, a carpenter and         
 wheelwright, a butcher and, at one    
 time, three shops. Now we have none.  
 But we have a post office and a pub.  
 We have a lovely old church and a     
 small chapel.                         
  The men still sing Wassail around the
 vllage on Old Christmas Eve, January  
 5th.  We still have a Woman's Club and
 they have their Annual Walk in June.  
 They have a banner with clasped hands 
 on it and the words "Bear Ye One      
 Anothers Burdens"and the women have   
 ribbons on their coats.               </content>
