		<title>17UNEMPLOYMENT.</title>
		<content> Unemployment in Camberley is not as   
 bad as in other areas,although it     
 is the highest in Surrey.The local    
 community provides various services.  
   A Youth Training Scheme in the area 
 teaches youths various skills which   
 they use when drafted into jobs,often 
 of their own choice.                  
   Within the area advice centres are  
 set up so that people can discuss     
 their individual problems and join in 
 with groups of other unemployed       
 people.Youth Opportunity Schemes are  
 available to people wanting to learn a
 trade.Companies in the area are       
 willing to take young people on for   
 short periods of time.However there is
 only one Job Centre in Camberley.     
   Youth groups are set up providing   
 leisure activities and other interests
 to keep unemployed people off the     
 streets and out of trouble.           </content>
