		<title>06Charney Bassett village</title>
		<content>Charney Bassett is a small village with
about 80 dwellings, and a population of
250. Around the village green are old  
white-walled thatched cottages, but    
elsewhere are several modern houses.   
There is one public house "The         
Chequers" - built in red-brick. New    
Road has a row of attractive           
Gothic-style buildings. There are no   
street lights and no speed limit.      
Charney Manor is of great interest,    
being owned by Quakers and used as a   
retreat &amp; conference centre. Listed    
Buildings include the Thatched barn on 
the green, and the Rectory. There are  
very few amenities but there are the   
Public House, the Post Office/Shop open
2 1/2 days a week, a mobile greengrocer
alternate weeks, a garage, children's  
playing field, post &amp; telephone boxes  
and a bus shelter for the occasional   
public transport.                      </content>
