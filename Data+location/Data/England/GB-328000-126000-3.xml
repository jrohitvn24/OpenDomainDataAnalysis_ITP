		<content>  Lodge Farm,Durston is a 600 acre     
 farm.It is mainly Grade 2 land.The    
 whole farm is under crop production.  
 Over the last ten years the farmer has
 gradually diversified his production. 
 He now grows wheat,barley,oats,lupins,
 sunflowers,oilseed rape,peas,beans and
 grass.He said the major problems of   
 today were,keeping up with inflation  
 and coping with cuts in crop prices.  
  The farmer and three full_time men   
 work the farm.On the farm there are   
 seven tractors,one combine harvester, 
 two lorries and an assortment of      
 spraying and drilling equipment.      
  100 years ago this land was made up  
 of six separate farms on the Portman  
 Estate.Due to death duties the estate 
 was sold.In the 1930's the farmer's   
 father bought one of the farms and    
 since then the family has gradually   
 bought the adjoining land.            </content>
