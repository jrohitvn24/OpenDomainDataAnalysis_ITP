		<title>09Children's pastimes.</title>
		<content> We asked the children at Escrick      
 Primary School to compile a list of   
 their favourite indoor and outdoor    
 games.The most popular outdoor game is
 tig,followed by roller skating,       
 rounders,leap frog,stuck in the mud   
 and Blockey 1,2,3.It is interesting   
 that nearly all of these games are    
 traditional and can be played with    
 little if any equipment.Favourite     
 indoor games range from a variety of  
 card games such as whist and patience 
 to board games including chess,       
 draughts,Cluedo and Scrabble.Favourite
 pastimes were very varied,but included
 making collections of things such as  
 stickers,dolls and stamps,as well as  
 more active pastimes such as horse    
 riding,swimming and a wide range of   
 sports.Playground games played include
 hop-scotch,skipping,and many kinds of 
 chasing games.                        </content>
