		<content>   As with most people throughout      
 Britain,the residents of this area are
 concerned about the current problems  
 facing our country today.Problems such
 as unemployment,drug addition,the     
 general degeneration of law and order,
 with its manifestation in an          
 increasing violent sociey and         
 terrorism(especially in Ulster)are    
 among the topics which they discuss   
 with their family and friends.They    
 also debate the prospects for world   
 peace.On a personal level they are    
 concerned about maintaining good      
 health and being able to enjoy a good 
 family life.They fear a further       
 decline in the country's moral        
 standards and the ultimate catastrophe
 _the outbreak of a nuclear war.Their  
 hopes are for the emergence of a more 
 peaceful and pollution free world,    
 from its present traumas.             </content>
