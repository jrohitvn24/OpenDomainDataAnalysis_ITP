		<content> Mr.Fish told us about life in the     
 village when he was a boy 60 years    
 ago.As 5 he started school at the     
 village hall,and at 8 moved to our    
 school.He remembers children coming to
 school without shoes.The lessons were 
 the same in every class but they just 
 got harder.On leaving school at 14 he 
 worked at Naylor's pipeworks.The      
 tennis court in the park was once a   
 swimming pool packed with people in   
 the summer.There used to be a golf    
 corse there too.Transport in the      
 village was by bicycle and horse drawn
 carts.The village had only half as    
 many houses as we have today,but the  
 population was the same because people
 had larger families.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
