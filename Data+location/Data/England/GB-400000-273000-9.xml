		<content> The Gloucester to Birmingham line was 
 opened in l840 and the station at     
 Barnt Green was provided in l846.     
 The{branch line}to Ashchurch via      
 Redditch opened in l859.   The tracks 
 were{widened}in l928 and now this     
 station is important in providing     
 transport for the local people.   They
 use it for going to{work}and{shopping 
 in Birmingham and Redditch.   The     
 station was very important when there 
 was a{cattle market}in the village.   
 To-day as well as being an important  
 station for{commuters,}many inter-city
 trains travel through reaching speeds 
 of 100 m.p.h.
