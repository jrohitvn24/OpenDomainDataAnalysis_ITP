		<content>  All of the families in our area have 
 at least one car.Most of them have two
 cars and the farms have most cars, one
 as many as four.As well as the car the
 farmers have other forms of transport 
 as well; pick up trucks, vans and of  
 course tractors make up the total     
 number of forms of transport.Although 
 many families have bikes very few use 
 them, even when going short journies. 
  There is a taxi service in our area  
 and the drivers take between eighty   
 and a hundred customers a week.       
  The bus service runs every hour and  
 connects Paull and Thorngumbald with  
 Withernsea and Hull.Roughly fifty     
 people a day travel on the bus,       
 sometimes going to Hedon sometimes to 
 Hull.                                 
  There is a mobile library that comes 
 to the area every fortnight.
