		<content>   There are some fine{Georgian        
 buildings which were originally built 
 around this busy 18th Century port    
 with it's{trows}and longboats.The     
 basins are now the mooring place for  
 100's of{pleasure craft}still over    
 looked by the Canal Company's         
 building-now a public house-The       
{Tontine.                              
   The round house at Areley Kings used
 to be a working windmill.It was built 
 about 1795 and has given it's to the  
 local first and middle schools.The    
 millers cottage stands beside the     
 mill.The{windmill}itself was made into
 a dwelling in 1902.                   
   The present bridge built in 1870    
 superceded a 3 arch stone bridge which
 was built by the canal company in     
 1775.Prior to this the ferry and ford 
 at{Redstone Caves}was used.It was a   
 toll bridge until 1893.               </content>
