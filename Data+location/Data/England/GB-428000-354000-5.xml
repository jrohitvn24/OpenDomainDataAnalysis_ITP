		<content> People who live on{Cromford Hill      
 endure a lot of{noise}from the traffic
 but they become used to it after a    
 while. They put it to the back of     
 their minds. Lorries are the{noisiest 
 vehicles. They come down at{4 or 5am. 
 in the morning from what used to be   
 Dene Quarry but is now Tarmac.        
 People on the Hill get lots of{dust } 
 especially through their windows.They 
{dust}but five minutes later they have 
 to{dust}again. It gets worse in the   
 summer. People who have had the       
 experience of living near{Cromford    
{Hill}would not live near the road     
 again. There was a{very bad acceident}
 on The Hill on August 2nd 1979.{A     
{runaway lorry demolished the crash    
{barriers, smashed up two cars and     
{ended in the wall of Number 86.
