		<title>17OUR LOCAL CHIPPY</title>
		<content> Our local chippy is on Brook Road. It 
 is a very clean shop with new deep fat
 fryers and a long counter for         
 recieving your order. Their chips are 
 the best around. They also sell pies, 
 gravy, curry, peas and much more.     
 Sausages come in jumbo size, which    
 cost 30p. or small hotdogs which cost 
 15p. Fish are 52p. chips are 32p. and 
 chip-barmcakes are 30p.               
  The owners are Derek and Launa. Derek
 fries and Launa, with other women,    
 serve. Launa is the most generous with
 the chips. Usually there is a long    
 line of hungry, patient people.       
 They're so long because the food is so
 nice. Small children with their       
 parents are often given free sweets   
 when ordering and there is always a   
 cheerful smile with sevice. They ask  
 if you want salt and vinegar, and     
 brown or tomato sauce is free.        </content>
