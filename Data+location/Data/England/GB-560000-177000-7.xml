		<content> As part of our Domesday project we    
 visited a retired teacher who had     
 taught at our school for many         
 years.She was born in Tilbury and has 
 lived in this area all of her life.She
 started teaching in 1946 and retired  
 in 1983 after many years of hard      
 work.During that time she witnessed   
 many changes at the school-four head  
 teachers,many teachers and countless  
 children.She told us that the building
 had been extended to include a kitchen
 and dining room.Her original room had 
 desks which were bolted to the floor  
 and there were often classes of fifty 
 children.They used pens with steel    
 nibs,dipping the pens into            
 inkwells.Lessons were formal,desks in 
 rows with the teacher's desk at the   
 front.
