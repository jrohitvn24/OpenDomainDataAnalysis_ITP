		<content> As St.Austell is the home of the China
 clay industry, the main freight trains
 carry china clay. Some go to the port 
 of Fowey where the clay is shipped all
 over the world. One train a day goes  
 to the Potteries and another takes    
 clay slurry to Sittingbourne. Wagons  
 loaded with clay also go to paper     
 makers in Scotland.                   
 The station opens from 3.3Oa.m. until 
 11p.m. The earliest trains are the    
 overnight parcels and the Royal Mail  
 and newspaper trains, which leave     
 London late at night or in the early  
 hours of the morning. The last train  
 at night is the sleeper to London     
 which leaves at 1O.5O p.m.
