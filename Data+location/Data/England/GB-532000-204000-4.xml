		<content>             As part of the work on the
 Domesday Survey local residents were  
 interviewed to find out any details   
 about their area. The most interesting
 details came from an old age pensioner
 who lived very near to Chancellors    
 School.She told us that the lake in   
 that area had been there for over 100 
 years. The lake was part of the       
 grounds of a stately home. The house  
 was burned down and its grounds are   
 now part of the golf course.The lady  
 said she could not believe the day    
 that the council dug a trench         
 alongside her house leading to the    
 lake. The lake was full of tench and  
 these were now put in danger.The      
 lady s son and his friends moved the  
 tench from the lake to Queenswod. They
 put hundreds of tench in there and    
 carried them all in buckets.
