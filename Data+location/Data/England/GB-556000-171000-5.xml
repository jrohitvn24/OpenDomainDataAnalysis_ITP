		<title>05A Typical Day at School</title>
		<content>   The very first thing I do is go into
 the playground and wait for the       
 whistle to go.  The whistle goes and  
 everyone goes into their classrooms.  
 I always look on the blackboard to see
 what work we have to do.  Then the    
 classes go into the assembly.  After  
 assembly we sometimes do maths and    
 mental arithmetic.  After first play  
 we do our project work for a little   
 while.  Then we go down and watch a   
 television programme called "How We   
 Used To Live." It is about a family   
 called the Hodgkins who lived in      
 Yorkshire in the 1920s.  School ends  
 at 3.20 p.m.  After school there are  
 clubs such as netball, soccer,        
 rounders, chess, cricket, table       
 tennis, needlework and country        
 dancing.
