		<content> The area cuts across three parish     
 boundaries - Fyfield, Willingale and  
 Beauchamp Roding.  Each parish is in a
 different deanery -Ongar, Chelmsford  
 and Dunmow but only two rectors run   
 these parishes:  Rev. Peter Turner    
 (Willingale and Fyfield) lives in     
 Fyfield and the Rev. Excel (Berners   
 Roding).  Willingale Parish Church has
 two buildings because formerly it was 
 two parishes - Willingale Doe and     
 Wilingale Spain.  The two buildings   
 share one churchyard and are built at 
 the highest spot in the village.      
 There are 4l on the electral roll, 22 
 from within the parish and an average 
 attendance of 12.  St. Andrews is the 
 older of the two buildings and has    
 some interesting stained glass.       
 St. Botolphs is the church at         
 Beauchamp Roding.   It is interesting 
 because it is completely isolated     </content>
