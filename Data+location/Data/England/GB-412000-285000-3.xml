		<content>   One of the policemen who            
 does the beat in our area  has been   
 n the force fifteen years.He is       
attached to Sheldon station which is a 
Divisional Headquarters as well as     
being a local station.About 10% of the 
 officers attached to the station are  
 women.A constable covers a large area 
 on his beat. He has a motorbike but   
sometimes walks part of his beat.He    
sometimes carries a truncheon with     
him usually at the weekend to aid him  
when arresting drunks. Fire arms can be
issued to the police, but this has not 
happened in Sheldon for a number of    
years. The crime rate in Sheldon is    
high and increasing.The increase in    
violence together with new laws are    
 thought by our policeman  to be making
 his ob more difficult.He also felt the
 olice force was being criticised more 
by the public and politicians.         </content>
