		<title>06The Library Theatre</title>
		<content> One of the new, modern facilities in  
 our town centre.                      
   The Library Theatre was built in    
 1976. Lots of houses were knocked down
 to make room for it. When the theatre 
 was opened in 1977 the first          
 performance was 'La Belle Helene'.    
 There is a rule that once a show has  
 been performed, it cannot come back   
 for another four years.               
   All the shows are of a very high    
 standard.                             
   Mr. Johns, the manager, thinks that 
 with the Birmingham Theatres there are
 enough to cover the area. He has      
 worked there since it opened and wants
 to move into the computer age with    
 some new control equipment. The       
 theatre can hold 340 in its auditorium
 and has bar and coffee lounge         
 facvilities.Tickets for other theatres
 can be booked at the box office.      </content>
