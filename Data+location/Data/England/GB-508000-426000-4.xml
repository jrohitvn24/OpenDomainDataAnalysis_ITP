		<title>04HULLS MARINA</title>
		<content> Hulls Marina was opened in 1983 and is
 in two sections, each of which was    
 once a dock.  The larger of the two   
 docks, the first to play host to      
 leisure craft such as yachts, was the 
 Humber dock and it covers 7 acres.  It
 was built in 1803 and gave Hull its   
 first enclosed dock with direct access
 to the Humber.                        
 At present the Marina has 330 berths  
 which can accommodate boats of 15ft to
 those of 75ft in length.  Access to   
 the Marina is via some modern lock    
 gates from the River Humber.  The     
 prices for berthing in the Marina are:
 rent for 1 year is Â£18 per foot per   
 boat with a minimum charge of Â£360,   
 you can rent a berth for 3 months at a
 rate of Â£6 per foot with a minimum    
 charge of Â£150.  These prices don't   
 include VAT.
