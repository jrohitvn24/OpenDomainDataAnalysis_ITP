		<content> The{Coal House}is a public house built
 in 1760 by the riverside in Apperley. 
 When the{River Severn}is flooded the  
 Coal House can be surrounded by up to 
 eight feet of water. The furniture is 
 still very old fashioned because the  
 owners who also own a guttering firm  
 prefer it that way. The landlady is   
 German and the Landlord is Irish.     
 Originally the'White Lion' it was     
 renamed because it's jetty was used to
 land coal for sale in the area. The   
{Yew Tree at Chaceley Stock,}originally
 a cider house, was always a boatee's  
 pub. It was extended c 1700. Old      
 customers remember that, before the   
 weir was built at Maisemore,{Severn   
{Trows}were stranded on the mud at low 
 tide. A Stock is a 'wharf' and the pub
 was probably situated at a river      
 crossing point at low tide. The       
 publican is a native of Staffordshire.</content>
