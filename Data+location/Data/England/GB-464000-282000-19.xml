		<title>19THE GRAND UNION CANAL H.B.</title>
		<content> The Grand Union Canal is one          
 of the village's main attractions.    
 The canal is three or four feet deep. 
 There are quite a lot of holiday canal
 barges on it.When the canal barges    
 went through the tunnel the children  
 would lead the horses over the tunnel 
 while the men legged the boat through 
 the tunnel.They would join the horses 
 after they had gone  through the      
 tunnel.Now the boats have engines.    
 Most of the water was clean.          
 In some parts you could see the fish  
 from the bank.Now the water is dirty  
 but there are still some small fish in
 it.                                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
