		<title>12CATCLIFFE GLASS KILN</title>
		<content>    The{Catcliffe glass kiln}was built 
 around the year{1740}and stands{60'   
{high. Glass}and{pot ornaments}were    
 made in the kiln. The Catcliffe kiln  
 is{the oldest standing kiln in Europe.
 A workforce of eight men used to work 
 at the kiln.                          
    At the top of the kiln the bricks  
 are all worn out. The kiln has{six    
{archways.}Inside the kiln on the floor
 are all bits of glass and fallen      
 bricks. Some of the glass is quite    
 old.                                  
    Today the kiln is not much use for 
 the village. Lots of children meet    
 there. Some children go and play in   
 the kiln. Children from our school    
 sometimes go to the kiln to{draw      
{pictures.                             
    The glass kiln means a lot to the  
{old people}as a reminder of the past. 
 It's also{a well-known local landmark.</content>
