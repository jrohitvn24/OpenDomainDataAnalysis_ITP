 District Council and contains propsals
 which are expected to be implemented  
 within the next ten years in the      
 village of Luckington.                
 These are the areas proposed for      
 residential development.              
 Land in the vicinity of the South End 
 Farm, the Street, Luckington.         
 Land at Avon Rise, Luckington.        
 Land to the South of White            
 House,Luckington.                     
 Land between the Street and the       
 playing field.                        
 The building site at Avon Rise could  
 provide an ideal opportunity for lower
 cost housing.The village is within the
 Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural  
 Beauty, this development would fit    
 into the village. There is local      
 opposition to this plan.              </content>
