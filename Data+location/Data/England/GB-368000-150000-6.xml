 Elizabethan, with Georgian wing added.
 THE OLD SCHOOL - built in l707, has   
 fine oak staircase and oak panelling. 
 THE OLD VICARAGE - a harmonious jumble
 of styles with l4C wing and later     
 Elizabethan and Georgian additions.   
 HAMILTONS - large Victorian vicarage  
 built in l863 to replace the old      
 vicarage. Now in secular occupation.  
 HAYES - built in l912 by the architect
 of Bristol University. Formerly the   
 Estate Factor's residence, now in     
 private occupation.                   
 THE TOLL HOUSE - originally at the top
 of the hill at the Trowbridge/Radstock
 fork - now on village edge.           
 PROSPECT HOUSE - in Charlton. A three 
 storey Georgian Town House built on   
 the foundations of an old cottage, and
 seems oddly situated in its rural     
 surroundings.                         </content>
