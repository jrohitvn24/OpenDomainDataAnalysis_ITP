		<title>18Morris Dancing.</title>
		<content> My dad is a Morris dancer.He is in a  
 Morris team called the Carnbrea       
 Morris.Morris has been a tradition for
 hundreds of years and it is very      
 enjoyable to see.My father wears a    
 costume when he dances,a white        
 shirt,white long socks,black shoes,red
 and yellow baldricks and blue         
 breeches.He also has a hat decorated  
 with red and yellow ribbons,badges and
 flowers.They perform a number of      
 dances which are all slightly         
 different and the last one is always a
 dance called the Bonny Green Garters. 
 This is one that anyone can join in   
 with and usually everybody does.On    
 Boxing Day we all go to watch my      
 father dance at the local pub and then
 we go to other people's places and    
 have parties,that's a great           
 day.Usually Carnbrea dancers perform  
 during the evening at two venues.     </content>
