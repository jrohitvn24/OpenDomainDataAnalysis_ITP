		<content>     When I get up on Sunday, I help   
Grandad, then I take the milk churns.  
When I come back it is time for        
breakfast.  I get the coke in and empty
the bins.  At about 10 o'clock I go    
with Grandad in the Land Rover to feed 
the sheep and count some of the cows.  
When I get back home I ride on my bike 
or help Dad.                           
     After dinner everybody sits down, 
so I usually see if Martin is in.  If  
he is, I go up to his house on my bike.
We sometimes go for a bike ride or do  
something inside.  I go back home at   
about 4 o'clock.                       
     After tea I help Dad.  At 7o'clock
everyone has finished their work.  I   
watch television and have a game of    
pool then I go to shut the hens up. I  
have some cornflakes or a hot drink for
supper, then get ready for bed.  In bed
I may read a book before sleeping.     </content>
