		<content> The 12 square kilometre block studied 
 by Castle Rock High School,Bardon Hill
 Church of England Primary and Warren  
 Hills Primary School comprises three  
 very different areas.                 
 There is a large residential suburb of
{Coalville}with schools,churches and   
 small shops;the village of{Bardon     
{Hill}(pop.c 200) which has grown up   
 around a quarry,near to the A50 and   
 situated just below Bardon Hill       
 (461132) and lastly farmland.         
 Before the residential development the
 whole area was of rough pasture and   
 mixed woodland.The eastern side of the
 area has remained unchanged.It is part
 of{Charnwood Forest},an area of low   
 hills of which Bardon is the highest. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
