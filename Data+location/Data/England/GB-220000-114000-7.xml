		<content> Most farms here are medium sized hold-
 ings of  about  200 acres.  Farming is
 predominantly  grass with a proportion
 being used for cereals. In summer some
 grass is cut  to make  hay and sileage
 for winter feeding.  Some farmers keep
 sheep and cattle;  others  concentrate
 on milking.                           
 Machinery plays a very  important part
 of farming in the 1980s and has become
 larger and more  sophisticated  as the
 years go by. Tractors are used most of
 all the machinery  to do a  variety of
 jobs by either  pulling or lifting the
 implements behind them.   Most farmers
 use a  high  proportion  of artificial
 manure  but  still  spread  slurry and
 dung.  Some  farmers employ  full-time
 workmen  whereas  others  only  employ
 part time. Usually a farmer's son will
 stay on the farm to work.             
 Many farms now take in paying guests. </content>
