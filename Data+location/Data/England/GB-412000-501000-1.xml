		<content>  This area is in the Dales, on the    
 edge of the National park. The        
 limestone dale was carved out by a    
 glacier many years ago. It contains   
 Swale river it is the fastest rivers  
 in England.                           
  The rough hilly land is ideal for    
 Swaledale sheep and can only be used  
 for cattle if the grass has been      
 treated with special fertilizer.      
  The area attracts many tourists,     
 particulary walkers, the Coast to     
 Coast walk goes through the centre of 
 our area. The Swaleview caravan site  
 caters for many tourists.             
  There are some racing stables, the   
 horses train on the old race course.  
  At the eastern edge of the area is   
 the town cemetery and the beginning of
 a council housing estate.             
  The area is basically rural and noted
 for its scenery.                      </content>
