		<title>01INTRO TO THE AREA</title>
		<content> Most of the area is very flat and low 
 lying and consists of arable farm     
 land, however there is an ash disposal
 works near the village of Cridling    
 Stubbs.                               
 There are two main features to the    
 North of the area,running             
 East-West;firstly the M62 Motorway    
 which was completed ten years         
 ago.Above this is the Aire and Calder 
 Navigation which branches from the    
 River Aire,and passes through the     
 village of Whitley Bridge.            
 This is a very quiet area.There is    
 very little night life and no         
 activities at weekends . There are no 
 supermarkets only small shops,so the  
 local residents have to travel if they
 want to do a large amount of shopping.
 The older children also have to travel
 out of the area to go to school.
