		<title>12THE FAMILY ON SUNDAY</title>
		<content> On Sunday I get up at 7 a.m. &amp; come   
 downstairs. Nearly an hour later, my  
 brother comes down. I then went to get
 dressed &amp; went outside to build a jump
 for my BMX bike. When I went indoors, 
 my brother was still watching TV.     
 After breakfast I went outside &amp; took 
 the jump to pieces &amp; built a new one. 
 At half past twelve, my Dad said,"Why 
 don't we go out for the day?"         
 So we went out to lunch to the Albert 
 in Colchester and then on to the Zoo. 
 There were lots of animals there like 
 lions, snakes &amp; fish of all shapes &amp;  
 sizes. The one I liked best was the   
 ape.                                  
 Afterwards we went to my Aunt         
 Chrissy's &amp; Uncle Tommy's house. My   
 brother &amp; I played with their dog     
 Tina. By that time it was getting     
 late, so we came home &amp; my brother &amp; I
 went to bed.                          </content>
