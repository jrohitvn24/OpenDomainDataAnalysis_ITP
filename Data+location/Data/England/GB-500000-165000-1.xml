      This area of Surrey is a mixture 
 of rural and urban communities.  At   
 the centre is the village of Lyne     
 which is surrounded by farmland.  On  
 the eastern side is the town          
 of Chertsey, an urban community with  
 shops and houses.  To the south is St.
 Peters Hospital and White Lodge Centre
 for handicapped children.  In the     
 north-west corner are the outskirts of
 Virginia Water.  The area is bisected 
 by the M25 motorway which runs north  
 to south and by the M3 motorway which 
 runs west to east.  There are seven   
 farms:- Trumps Farm, Almners Barn     
 Farm, Hardwick Court Farm, France     
 Farm, Fan Court Farm and Hersham Farm.
