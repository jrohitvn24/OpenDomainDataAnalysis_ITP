		<content> We interviewed Mr.Albert Poulter about
 his school days.He went to the Church 
 school in Guithavon St. (now Howbridge
 CofE Junior School). It had been built
 in 1842,and he went there at the age  
 of 4 1/2 in 1911 and stayed there     
 until he was 14.The teacher took all  
 subjects.Physical Education was a     
 drill.There were no school dinners    
 You either went home or ate sandwiches
 in the classroom.They played different
 games in the playground, Jimmy        
 Knackers, Leapfrog, marbles, and Flick
 (with cigarette cards). He had 1 penny
 per week pocket money,we get 50 pence 
 today.He said punishment was  either  
 the cane or writing lines, we have to 
 write an essay.He only went on two    
 school trips in the time he was there 
 ,we have at least one each year. There
 were several private schools including
 three boarding schools. Now none left.</content>
