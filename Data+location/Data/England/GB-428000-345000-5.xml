		<content>     Our school was originally built in
 1846.An Infant classroom was added  in
 1910 while a further extension in 1979
 provided for indoor toilets and a  new
 cloakroom and office.This year we have
 had a new playground added.  This is a
 great improvement.                    
     Nearly  all of the  children  live
 within two miles of the school. Almost
 all of the children are brought to our
 school by car. School starts at nine'o
 clock and finishes at three thirty for
 the Juniors. The Infants  go  home  at
 three'o clock. All children  stay  for
 school dinner. The meals are cooked at
 school by Mrs.Morley.  Each meal costs
 us 45p.                               
     We have lots of visits  from  this
 school.In your last year here, you  go
 on an extended visit.Over recent years
 they have  been  to  Norfolk, Suffolk,
 Northumberland,Wales and on the canal.</content>
