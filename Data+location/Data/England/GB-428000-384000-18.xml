		<content> Moorcroft Road on the site of what    
 used to be an old sandstone quarry.   
 Because the western edge of our block 
 is in a Green Belt area, there is a   
 restriction on house building in this 
 part of the city. Consequently,this   
 area is much sought after by people   
 who want to buy houses.               
      The cheapest semi-detached house 
 in our block will cost about Â£22,ooo, 
 while the largest of the old Victorian
 houses may fetch well above Â£120,000. 
 The new houses on Moorcroft Road have 
 been selling at between Â£40,000 and   
 Â£50,000.                              
      Our block contains a high        
 proportion of the total private       
 housing in Sheffield.  Many people    
 regard it as one of the best areas of 
 the city in which they can live.  This
 is shown in the house prices.
