      {"School days are the happiest   
       {    days of your life"    }    
 We asked parents about their school   
 days ,what they remembered........    
   {Awful pen nibs which always seemed 
{to be crossed....lumpy ink...blots on 
{your book...hit on the hand with a    
{ruler for talking...desks in          
{rows....crowded classrooms...reciting 
{tables daily...walking 2 miles to and 
{from school...iron railings around the
{play ground...outside toilets which   
{froze up on very cold days...squares  
{of blotting paper which had to last   
{the whole term...teachers mostly who  
{were middle-aged,unmarried ladies and 
{very stern...country dancing round the
{maypole...being evacuated to the      
{country during the war...air -raid    
{shelters near to the playground....
