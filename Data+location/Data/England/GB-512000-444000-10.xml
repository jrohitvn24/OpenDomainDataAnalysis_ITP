		<title>10Trees in Sigglesthorne.</title>
		<content>      In recent times this area has    
 lost a large number of{trees}and      
{hedges.                               
      The main causes of the loss of   
 large trees in the area are the onset 
 of{Dutch Elm disease,}which has       
 resulted in the felling of at least   
 twenty mature elms, and the felling of
 trees due to{old age.}Older residents 
 of the village claim that up to twenty
 trees, estimated to be up to 300      
 years old have been felled in the     
 last twenty years.                    
      There are plans to replace these 
 trees but it will be a long time      
 before they make the same contribution
 to the landscape which their          
 predecessors have made.               
      Many{hedges}have been lost when  
 fields have been consolidated to      
 produce large fields more suitable for
 cereal growing.                       </content>
