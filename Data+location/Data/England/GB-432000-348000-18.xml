		<content>        { L.B.Plastics}was originally  
 Litchfield Brothers of Broadholme and 
 the firm dates back to the 1930's.It  
 made wire parts and metal pressings.  
 After the Second World War the        
 Broadholme Factory developed an idea  
 to make more things like thermo-      
 plastics and this worked well.Because 
 it developed so rapidly a separate    
 company was formed in 1956 called{L.B.
{Plastics Ltd.}and it moved to a new   
 site at{Nether Heage.}                
     It is well placed in the centre of
 the U.K.near to Derby and the Motorway
 It has offices and factories in Sweden

 Far East. The P.V.C.is used for       
 windows,carrying electric wire through
 buildings and a knitted mesh. It is   
 used in the home for clothes lines,   
 draught excluders,door springs,curtain
