		<content>The Police Station was built in 1975.  
It is open from 10.00 a.m. to 11.00    
a.m. and from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.   
There is one Sergeant and five         
constables. The patrol goes from       
Wickham Market to Rendham to Peasenhall
to the Happy Eater Restaurant at       
Darsham. Prisoners are kept in a room  
with a hole in the door, so that you   
can see the whole room.Prisoners stay  
over night at Leiston.                 
The magistrates court sits every Monday
excepting Bank Holidays.The Juvenile   
court sits on Thursdays once a month.  
On a visit we were shown a room with   
a finger print set in it. We were shown
how to take prints.
