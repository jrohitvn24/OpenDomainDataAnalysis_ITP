		<content>     In previous times, opposite to    
 where the Co-operative shop now       
 stands, a garage and hardware shop was
 situated, owned by G.J.S. Jackson. An 
 interesting feature of the layout was 
 that the petrol pump was positioned   
 very close to the entrance to the     
 premises. Customers do not appear to  
 have been put off by having to squeeze
 past it in order to do business.      
    Pinfold Antiques has replaced what 
 used to be Peatman's grocery shop. The
 Peatman family also owned the village 
 bakery in the centre of the           
 village(now Wise Buys self-service    
 shop) and were noted for their own    
 baked bread. The shop always opened   
 for a short while on Good Friday each 
 year to sell fresh warm hot cross     
 buns, traditional Easter fare.        
                            continued-
