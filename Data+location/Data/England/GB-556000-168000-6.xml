		<content>    The{River Darent}is widely used by 
 fishermen, birdwatchers and natural-  
 ists. The lakes and the river itself  
 provide fine specimens of pike, chub, 
 carp and perch which bring many       
 anglers during the season.            
   Bird-watchers are attracted by such 
 varied species as finches, wagtails,  
 heron, snipe, kingfishers and Canada  
 geese.  Naturalists can find over     
 twenty species of trees including the 
 evergreen oak, the commonest being    
 the hawthorn, and a great variety of  
 waterside plants and flowers, some of 
 which are quite rare, e.g. cuckoo-pint
 and a woody nightshade. An occasional 
 red fox may be seen in the waterside  
 fields, and hedgehogs and voles along 
 the river. Evidence can be seen of the
 existence of badgers and moles, and   
 frogs, toads and water insects abound.
 Families use the river for recreation.</content>
