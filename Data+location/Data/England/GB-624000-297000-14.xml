		<content> The{POPULATION}is constant at under   
 500 and is centered on the main       
 streets in the villages. The remainder
 is scattered over the whole area both 
 on farms and in isolated houses.      
 Social Mix, this is varied and        
 includes skilled and unskilled manual 
 workers from farms and industry,      
 Tradesmen, Businessmen and            
 Professionals many of whom work in the
 nearby city.                          
                                       
{AGES}within the community: There are a
 smaller number of the very young and  
 teenagers than in the past.           
{PROPERTY}in the area is relatively    
 expensive consequently there are few  
 young marrieds. The retired and better
 off working community form a larger   
 proportion of the people. Working     
 farmers, though they are few in number
 own a majority of the land.           </content>
