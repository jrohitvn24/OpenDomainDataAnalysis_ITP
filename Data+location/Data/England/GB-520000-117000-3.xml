		<content>  {Science and Technology}is increas-  
 ing its influence on farming, in      
 artificial insemination (principally  
 cattle), pregnancy and blood testing. 
   Considerable use is made of ADAS and
 the advisory service provided by      
 Merchants of agricultural products.   
 Artificial and organic fertilizers are
 used regularly to-gether with         
 pesticides, fungicides and            
 weedkillers. These are applied from   
 the ground and air.                   
   Farm operation is mixed; there is   
 owner occupation, tenant occupation of
 private and Council owned farms, and  
 management for large Companies.       
   All farming in the area makes       
 extensive use of mechanised equipment.
 The labour force has been drastically 
 reduced; some large arable farms      
 operate with only two men and         
 occasional casual labour.             </content>
