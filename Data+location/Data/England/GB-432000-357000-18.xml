		<title>18Longball (A school game)</title>
		<content>   In longball there are two teams,    
 mixed or girls against boys. The      
 bowler bowls a football, underarm     
 which the runner has to kick and then 
 run to the far end of the playground. 
   The fielding team's aim is to stop  
 the ball and hit the runner with it   
  If hit, while running a player is out
 of the game, if however, he arrives at
 the far end of the playground he      
 scores 1 point though if he runs      
 straight back to the bowler's end he  
 scores an extra 2 points.             
   If however,the player stays at the  
 far end of the playground he must     
 run back when the next person kicks   
 the ball and runs down. He will only  
 score a further 1 point for this and  
 if he is hit on the way back he looses
 all his points. If the player is not  
 hit he rejoins his team to have       
 another go until caught out.          </content>
