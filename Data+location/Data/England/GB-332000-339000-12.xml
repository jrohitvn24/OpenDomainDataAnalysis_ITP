		<title>12The History of Knolton Hall</title>
		<content> From Elizabethan times a family named 
 Barton lived in the Hall and left it  
 in 1820. They changed it from a farm  
 house into a grand hall.              
 The water was supplied from a spring  
 down the valley, but in the dining    
 room there was also a 19 ft well,     
 which was later filled in. When a     
 gentleman wanted a bath they would go 
 to a hut by the lake and take one     
 besides a fire.                       
 A passage was added in Queen Anne's   
 time. Another room was decorated in   
 the Victorian style, updating the     
 furnishings.A long driveway made it   
 possible to see persons approaching   
 the house. A secret underground       
 passage was found which came out by   
 the lake.Perhaps it was built for     
 hiding people.                        
 The present owners, proud of its      
 history, maintain its character.      </content>
