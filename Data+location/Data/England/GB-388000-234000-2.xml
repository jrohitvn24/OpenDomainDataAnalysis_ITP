		<title>02Landscape of Twyning Green</title>
		<content>   {Twyning village green}is one of the
 most important pieces of Twyning's    
 history. Not only is it old, but most 
 activities in Twyning centre on the   
{green.}There have never been any      
 buildings on the{green,}but it has    
 changed through the years. It is now  
 slightly smaller due to the roads     
 being widened. It used to have a brook
 down the middle, surrounded by willow 
 trees. There used to be a pond at the 
 bottom of it. The{green}is owned by   
 all the pasture holders in Twyning.   
 The plane tree on the{green}has one of
 the largest circumferences around the 
 trunk in the world. The tree is about 
 two hundred and fifty years old; that 
 gives you a good idea as to the age of
 the{green.}The plane tree is the only 
 remaining tree out of an avenue of    
 trees.
