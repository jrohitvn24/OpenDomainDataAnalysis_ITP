		<title>03SUMMARY OF AREA (PART TWO)</title>
		<content> In the south west of our area is      
 Hurworth Burn reservoir,which has a   
 dam,and flowing around the dam is     
 Mousey Burn stream,which goes under   
 the dismantled railway,and out of our 
 area.Another stream is Claypool       
 Beck,which goes under the A19.The     
 dismantled railway,goes north to      
 south,cutting across roads,streams and
 fields.It is just a raised track      
 now.We have 2 small plantations in the
 area,the Bowman's Plantation and the  
 Fardenhill Plantation.Claypool Beck   
 runs through Bowman's Plantation,which
 is an excellent place for bird        
 watching.There are 2 disused mines in 
 our area one is near South Wingate and
 the other is right next to Kenny's    
 Pond,which is the only licensed pond  
 for fishing in this area.It is owned  
 by Hartlepool and District Angling    
 Club.                                 </content>
