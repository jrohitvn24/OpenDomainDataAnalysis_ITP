		<title>10St. Leonard's Church</title>
		<content> St. Leonard's Church was built round  
 about the year 1180 and later on,     
 during restoration work in 1870, the  
 Tower was demolished.  When the Church
 was rebuilt, several carved stones    
 were found.  These stones can be seen 
 today in the Bell Ringing Chamber.  In
 the year 1448, the first tower was    
 built by Richard Horde who lived at   
 Horde's Park, which was on the road to
 Broseley.  A year later, Richard Horde
 died and he asked, in his will, to be 
 buried under the arch of the new tower
 which he had built.  In a battle      
 between the Parliamentary Forces and  
 the Royalists, Colonel Billingsley was
 killed and his sword is kept in a case
 in St. Leonard's Church where it can  
 still be seen today.  Now, in 1985,   
 St. Leonard's Church is being repaired
 and restored and will soon be open to 
 the public.                           </content>
