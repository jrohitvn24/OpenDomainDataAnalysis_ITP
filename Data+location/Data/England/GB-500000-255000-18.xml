		<title>18Radwell, near Milton Ernest</title>
		<content>{Radwell}lies about 2 miles to the West
 of{Milton Ernest.}It is a hamlet of   
 Felmersham, a neighbouring village. It
 has a population of about 100 who live
 mainly in detached expensive housing. 
 The public house, called The Swan, is 
 in the centre of the hamlet on the    
 main road and dates from the 16th     
 century when originally it was a      
 blacksmith's forge. There is a        
{Methodist Chapel}which has been       
 converted into a private house. On the
 road from{Milton Ernest,}just outside 
 the hamlet, is a very narrow stone    
 bridge across the{Great Ouse River    
 which nowadays causes considerable    
 traffic congestion. Approaching this  
 bridge on the{Milton Ernest}side      
 across the flood meadows is a raised  
 footpath one quarter of a mile long.  
 There are two farms, one dairy and one
 dairy and arable.                     </content>
