		<title>19MEDIA NEWSPAPERS LUTON</title>
		<content>The pupils in our class answered some  
questions about newspapers.  There were
three daily newspapers the Sun, the    
Mirror and the Star in that order. 25% 
didn't have a daily newspaper.  On     
Sundays the News of th World was the   
most popular with some taking the      
Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. 20%   
didn't have a Sunday paper.            
Almost all families recieved copies of 
the free weekly local papers, the      
Leader and the Herald. Only a third    
bought the Luton News.                 
Newspapers were used, in the main, for 
looking up TV programmes.   Just over  
half the class, 11/12year olds, read   
some of the stories  and a handful     
liked the cartoons and sport.
