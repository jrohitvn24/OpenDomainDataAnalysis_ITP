		<title>15ECOLOGY: WILD FLOWERS</title>
		<content>     Along the pathways and on         
 hedgebanks we saw lots of wild        
 flowers. We were able to identify some
 of them, such as, pink campion,       
 hemlock, field buttercup, stinging    
 nettle, cow parsley, ox-eye daisy,    
 poppy and speedwell.                  
     In the hedgerows honeysuckle,     
 elder, bramble, periwinkle and deadly 
 nightshade were in flower and improved
 the appearance of the hedges.         
     Down in the marshy areas beside   
 the Medina River and the East Yar     
 River we came across a very colourful,
 pretty flower called yellow flag. It  
 grew over a wide area of marsh.       
     For those who like nature and     
 enjoy walks in the country the Worsley
 trail and Shepherds trail which cross 
 our area are worth following. The view
 and wild flowers reward the keen      
 walker.                               </content>
