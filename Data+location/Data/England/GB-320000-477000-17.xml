		<content>    There is much to interest the      
 student of natural history in the     
 entire block such as: outcrops of     
 various rock series which include the 
 very fossiliferous lower carboniforous
 limestones and red sandstones, not to 
 mention the igneous rocks of the Lake 
 District Dome. These are of great     
 interest to the geologist and         
 palaeontologist. In the fields of     
 flora and fauna the usual plant and   
 animal life which favours this terrain
 are there in abundance, ranging from  
 simple algae to super evolved         
 creatures like the peregrin falcon.   
    For the archaeologist not only are 
 there prehistoric remains but much to 
 interest the student of written       
 history including much for the        
 industrial archaeologist particularly 
 ancient farm tools and equipment.
