		<content>    In our area there were once 3      
 schools,Linton,Upton Bishop and       
 Gorsley.Now only Gorsley Goffs is     
 still in existance.The other schools  
 were forced into closure by education 
 cuts and dwindling numbers of         
 children.So in affect it was the      
 closure of those two schools that kept
 Gorsley Goffs Primary open.           
    Gorsley Goffs was not just a school
 it was also a Chapel.It was built in  
 1821 with money left by Edward Goff   
 who had died 8 years ealier.It was to 
 be a school for the poor as all the   
 other schools at the time were fee    
 paying.In 1852 the building became    
 just a school.                        
 1981 saw the rebuilding of the school.
 The work was completed in 1982.In 162 
 years Gorsley Goffs school has come a 
 long way,I think Mr.Goff would have   
 quite a shock!                        </content>
