		<title>16SHOPS IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> We have already mentioned that there  
 are four main places where people     
 live.Stockton on Forest,Hopgrove,     
 Warthill and Holtby.                  
 The last two mentioned villages       
 have about 200 and 100 people living  
 in them but have no shops at all.The  
 residents say that they do their shop-
 ping in York or get the free bus to   
 the ASDA Supermarket about five miles 
 away in Huntington.                   
      Stockton on Forest has two shops,
 (the Post Office and the V.G Grocery  
 Store).The Post Office caters for the 
 900 people in Stockton for postal     
 services,child benefits &amp; pensions. It
 also sells some food,newspapers and   
 stationery.The V.G.shop has a good    
 little business as a mini-supermarket.
      At Hopgrove there is a little    
 shop/Post Office but there are only   
 about 95 people living there.         </content>
