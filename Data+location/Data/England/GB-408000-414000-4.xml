		<content>    On the hilltops at Scapegoat Hill  
 and Moorside Edge there is heather,   
 and in places the cotton grass of the 
 real peat moorland.                   
    In the narrow side valleys called  
 Cloughs are fast running streams.Here,
 where it is more sheltered we find    
 many more trees, particularly sycamore
 and oak. Here are found rabbit and    
 hare, and in the lower valley, shrews 
 and moles. Kingcups (marsh marigolds) 
 grow near the streams. In the         
 uncultivated fields grow dandelions   
 and buttercups, celandines and        
 daisies, while coltsfoots are common  
 by the roadside.                      
    In the valley bottoms grow alder   
 and lowland trees such as ash. A      
 kingfisher may occasionally be seen by
 the river and voles can be found by   
 the water.
