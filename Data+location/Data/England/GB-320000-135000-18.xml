		<title>18COURT FARM SPAXTON</title>
		<content> It was a lovely sunny day. We were    
 going down to Mr Dares Farm. We had an
 enjoyable morning looking around.     
 First we looked at the milking        
 parlour.It was so clean we did not    
 need our boots. When we got there they
 had just finished milking and they    
 washed the floor. Outside the Friesian
 cows were eating and roaming around.  
 Some cows were due to have a calf.    
 When we had finished asking our       
 questions we walked over to the other 
 side of the farm.There we saw calves  
 and a bull. Some cows were in a shed, 
 it was very clean. There was alot of  
 straw for the cows to eat. When we    
 went down Mr Dares farm i liked the   
 milking palour. I loved the smell,    
 that was my favourite thing. Mr Date  
 was very kind because he fixed up a   
 date for us to go down. We enjoyed our
 trip very much.                       </content>
