		<content> Potton has{one caravan site.}The      
 caravan site is on the {outskirts of  
{Potton }on Myers Road. There has been 
 a  permanent site there for{eight     
 years although travellers have been in
 the area on and off for{ten to fifteen
{years.}The site is approximately{five 
{or six acres}and on it there are about
{twenty five caravans.}There are{      
{eighteen families}approximately on the
 site at present and all of them are   
 related to each other. The caravans   
 vary in size from approximately six to
 ten metres. Some of the people who    
 live on the site go away for anything 
 from two to six weeks for fruit       
 picking, weddings or holidays.  All   
{the Potton travellers}go to a big     
{summer Horse Fair}which is held       
 annually in{Cambridge.
