		<title>04Croxton Parish</title>
		<content> Croxton is a small village of 3 farms 
 and 15 houses.One farm and 3 houses   
 are privately owned, the rest of the  
 property in the Parish apart from the 
 Church,is owned by the Earl of        
 Yarborough.The Farms are predominatly 
 Arable but some cattle and horses are 
 grazed near the village.              
 A new house was built in 1983. This   
 was the first new building in the     
 village for over 100 years.Stringent  
 planning conditions had to be met,    
 because either side of the new house  
 are some yellow brick distinctive     
 Yarborough Estate Cottages.No further 
 development is expected.49 people live
 in the parish and all except 3 of the 
 men work in Agriculture. Croxton's    
 only facility is a fine church, no    
 Pub,Shop or Bus Service. Youngerschool
 children until 11 go to Kirmington.   
 Older children are bused to Brigg.    </content>
