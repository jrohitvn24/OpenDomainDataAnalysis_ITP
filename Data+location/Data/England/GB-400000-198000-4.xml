		<content> We live in a modern 4 bedroomed house 
 on the edge of town.We get up at 7.30 
 and have breakfast of cereal,wholemeal
 bread,milk,some times fried bacon.We  
 read the Telegraph and listen to the  
 Today programme on Radio 4.My husband 
 gets ready for work at the local      
 comprehensive where he teaches Maths, 
 our son of 12 attends the same school.
 Our daughter of 9 goes to the nearby  
 primary.I carry on with the daily     
 chores.At 9.30 I leave for the Sports 
 Centre to play badminton or do gym.At 
 12 I return to carry on with the jobs 
 and have lunch.While I clean house I  
 listen to Woman's Hour or a Concert.  
 The evening meal is usually relaxed &amp; 
 as varied as possible,meat,vegetables,
 fruit but also vegetarian for me.After
 homework the children watch their     
 programmes,have a bath and go to bed. 
 My husband works until 9 &amp; then to bed</content>
