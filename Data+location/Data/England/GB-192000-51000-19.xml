		<content> St Stephen was the birth place of the 
 brothers Joseph Hocking(1850_1935) and
 Silas Hocking(1860_1937).Both were    
 Methodist ministers and prolific      
 novelists.Silas achieved immense      
 popularity in his day,with his novel  
 'Alec Green',but today both he and his
 brother are little remembered.There is
 no memorial to them in the village    
 that we could find,and today nobody   
 that we had talked to had heard of    
 them.
