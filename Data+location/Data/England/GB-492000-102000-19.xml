		<content>    There was a lot of disturbance     
 about the car park outside Barnham    
 Station and the supermarket.          
    Ian Lightbody of the council       
 supports the motion that about 75     
 spaces are all                        
 that would be needed to make a large  
 car park.                             
    The local parish agreed to the idea
 and sent a letter of approval to the  
 council.This road along with the      
 railway would also create jobs.A      
 suggestion was put forward by Mrs     
 Ruthward that a junior parish council 
 should be formed. This idea was       
 supported by Mr David Hodgson. Both of
 these councillors are going to speak  
 to local headmasters about it.
