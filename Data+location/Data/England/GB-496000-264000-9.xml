		<title>09 Knight's Farm (Dairy)</title>
		<content>  Knight's Farm is on a private small  
holding of 59 acres along Newton Road, 
run by two people. The farm has about  
200 acres of land most of which is     
rented and is well spread out. The     
fields away from the farm are used for 
young stock but mostly for cut grass   
to keep as silage.                     
  The farm mostly has cows and a few   
calves, their end product is milk.     
This is sold to be bottled but some    
goes to cheese and butter              
manufacturers. The milk has to be of   
a high standard so the equipment must  
be kept clean.                         
  There are about 150 calves born each 
year, 75 of these are male which are   
sent off for beef production; at       
present they have 130 cows.            
  During the winter they feed the stock
on silage, although sometimes they use 
wheat and spring barley.               </content>
