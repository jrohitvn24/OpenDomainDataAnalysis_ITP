		<title>14NOTABLE EVENTS IN FLEET</title>
		<content> The{CARNIVAL.}Every year Fleet has a  
 carnival. There is a children's       
 procession on Saturday and a full     
 procession on Wednesday evening. Other
 events take place during the week,    
 including a firework display.         
                                       
 The Fleet{HALF-MARATHON}is held in    
 March. The 13 miles course ends at    
 Rushmoor Arena, Aldershot. The runners
 get a medal if they complete the      
 course. There are also children's     
 races at Rushmoor Arena.              
                                       
{SUBSIDENCE.}Recently, many houses in  
 Fleet have suffered from subsidence.  
 It is blamed on the very dry summer of
 1976."We found our house had          
 subsidence so the builders had to dig 
 down six feet to put in a new floor.  
 We had to move to another house in    
 Fleet for three months."              </content>
