		<title>12Life on the Estate,Blackburn</title>
		<content>   Where I live on the estate there is 
 a lot vandalism.There is glass on the 
 play grounds and people write on the  
 walls and slides.We use to have some  
 fibre glass boxes to play on but{punks
 pulled them up and dumped them on the 
 field.                                
   On the field next to the estate     
 people set fires and damage the       
 trees.There are some shops,a chemist,a
 newsagents,a doctors,a chip shop and a
 food shop.All the punks hang around   
 the shops and{there is a lot of       
{violence.                             
   There are trips which the Community 
 Wardens organize for the children and 
 a{Community Centre}where they have    
 karate,a playgroup and majorettes.    
   Living on the estate is all right   
 but I would like to move and so would 
 my mum.
