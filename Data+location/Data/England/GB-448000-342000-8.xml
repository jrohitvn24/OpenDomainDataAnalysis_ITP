		<content>  "In 1980{Strelley Hall}was unoccupied
 since the death of Emily Mary Edge,   
 the last of the Edge family who had   
 occupied the property for 330 years.  
 Before that the Strelley family had   
 owned the estate since 1198.          
   The main building was in a bad state
 of repair, needing considerable       
 attention. It was situated in most    
 attractive parkland and PAFEC Ltd     
 decided it would make an attractive   
 headquarters for the growing          
 international company.                
   At Â£165,000 it was expensive for the
 company so I sold my own house and    
 moved into part of the building. There
 are a few problems with this          
 arrangement: it is not possible to    
 relax at weekends and holiday times.  
 But the buildings and surroundings are
 a great source of enjoyment to our    
 family."  Richard Henshell MD PAFEC   </content>
