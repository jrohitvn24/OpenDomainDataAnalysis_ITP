		<title>14THE MUSEUM</title>
		<content>  We talked to Stephen Cluse who has   
 been the Assistant Curator at the     
 Corinium Museum for 4 years. He has a 
 degree in archeology. He enjoys his   
 job because of the variety of the many
 different displays and exibitions.    
 He believes that the Saxon Burial     
 Ground at Lechlade was a very         
 important find for the area. In 1984  
 the museum had 66,600 visitors.       
 Fridays are the quietest days;        
 Saturdays visitors ask the most       
 difficult questions. Many school      
 parties visit the museum,so do        
 individuals from home and abroad,also 
 many local people.Visitors to the     
 museum like the roman mosaics, the    
 stuffed animals,roman statues and     
 skeleton man.Pupils from this school  
 helped to wash the mosaics with       
 distilled water last time they were   
 cleaned.                              </content>
