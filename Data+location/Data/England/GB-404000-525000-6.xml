		<title>06HOUSING IN WOODLAND</title>
		<content>  Most houses are{owner occupied.}There
 are some Council houses in Woodland   
 but people can buy their Council      
 houses if they wish. Most buildings   
 are built from sandstone.             
   Some modern houses have two         
 bathrooms and a toilet upstairs and   
 one down or an  extra one outside.    
  In Teesdale there  are a lot of old  
 buildings that must be  left as they  
 are,{planning permission}is needed    
 before any alterations can be carried 
 out on buildings old or new.          
  My house is 160 years old and was    
 once a public house called The Black  
 Horse Inn that is where the street    
 gets it name from.                    
  Before we could extend our house it  
 had  to be sandblasted to{restore}the 
 old stone.                            
  Many houses are being{renovated}and  
 central heating installed.            </content>
