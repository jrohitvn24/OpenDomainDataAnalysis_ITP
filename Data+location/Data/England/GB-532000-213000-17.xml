		<content> In {POM-POM-HOME }the catcher counts  
 while the others hide. Everyone tries 
 to return to base without being seen  
 by him or they are out. One person    
 returning, shouts pom-pom-home and    
 frees all the others.                 
                                       
 In {STUCK-IN-THE-MUD}one person is it.
 If he touches you, you are stuck. You 
 stand with your legs open. Someone has
 to go through your legs and you are   
 free.                                 
                                       
 In {SPOT-SOLDIER }a person counts and 
 the other people have to creep towards
 him. The counter has to only look with
 one eye.The first person to be seen is
 it and then they have to count.       
                                       
 In {IT-ROUND-THE-WALL }you run in one 
 direction without going back. If you  
 are caught, you are it.               </content>
