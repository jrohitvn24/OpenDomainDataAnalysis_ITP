		<title>15RUDDINGTON SENIOR CITIZENS</title>
		<content> The elderly are well cared for in {   
{RUDDINGTON}as there are purpose built 
 bungalows with a warden on call and   
 three{Old Peoples Homes.}One is {LEYS 
{COURT }where they can have flats with 
 kitchens and eat meals in the dining  
 room. There are also various          
 entertainments laid on for them.      
{SOUTH MANOR }is in a house built 146  
 years ago for a wealthy family.It is  
 now a County Council Home for the     
 elderly and also has a short stay     
 centre.                               
 The oldest person is Mrs. Woodward who
 is 98. The Matron has 20 part-time    
 nurses to help look after the         
 residents.She said "It just evolved   
 that she became matron but she enjoys 
 it anyway." I think its a good job    
 because if there were not homes like  
 this the old people would have to go  
 in to hospitals.                      </content>
