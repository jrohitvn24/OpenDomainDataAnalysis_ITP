		<title>04Bramley Grange Hotel</title>
		<content> The Bramley Grange was founded        
 in 1914. It was converted from a manor
 house and small farm. There are       
 approximately 106 rooms and they have 
 a putting green, lawn tennis and      
 croquet. They are building an indoor  
 pool, a gym, a sauna, a jacussi and   
 20-30 more bedrooms with colour       
 televisions, telephones and private   
 bathroom facilities. They allow       
 reception parties to be held there and
 the restaurant is open to non         
 residents. The people who stay there  
 are usually executives working in     
 this area, tourists, people who have  
 been working abroad and are moving    
 into this area, and parents of        
 students visiting particularly Rikkyo 
 School, a Japanese school South of    
 this area.
