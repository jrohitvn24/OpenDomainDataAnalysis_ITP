		<title>12FARMING  DAIRY.</title>
		<content>{CHANNEL FARM.}This is a dairy farm    
 which concentrates on producing dairy 
 products of a high quality for local  
 use. The cream is delivered by van to 
 shops and there is a shop at the farm 
 where the public can buy fresh farm   
 made produce  like ice cream, cream   
 cheese, goats cheese and eggs.        
{DEVONSHIRE CLOTTED CREAM. } This is   
 usually only made in thesouth West of 
 England mainly in Devon but now in    
 Cornwall. It is very popular with     
 holiday makers and Devonians usually  
 prefer it to any other cream with     
 fruit etc and call it "real cream".   
 It is a cooked cream made by allowing 
 the milk to stand in a special bowl   
 and then heating it slowly. When it is
 cold the cream is skimmed  off and is 
 thick. It has a very high fat content 
 but is delicious with freshly cooked  
 scones and strawberry jam or friut.   </content>
