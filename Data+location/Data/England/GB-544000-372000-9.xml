		<title>09Well Vale Nature Reserve</title>
		<content> Well Vale is a nature trail which     
 takes you through parkland and past a 
 lake. The woodland area is surrounded 
 with trees such as Larch, sycamore,   
 Beech, Scotts Pine and Elm.           
     Near to the trees wild flowers and
 shrubs are growing e.g primroses,     
 silverweed, field maple and hawthorn  
 shrubs. There is a definite smell of  
 wild garlic and fungi. Although there 
 is little trace, badgers, hares,      
 moles, rats, fieldmice, pheasants and 
 other birds such as Goldfinch and     
 Treecreeper inhabit this beautiful    
 woodland area.                        
      In the lake Waterbeetle and      
 Dragonfly larvae are a few of the     
 insects found, while Moorhen and      
 Coot swim on the lake. Pale green     
 leaves of water Starwort lie on top   
 of the peaceful lake. These are just a
 few beauties of Well Vale.            </content>
