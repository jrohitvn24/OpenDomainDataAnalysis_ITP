 KITCHENS                              
                                       
 The kitchen in 1985 has nearly        
 everything you need to cook with.     
 There are microwaves which can warm   
 food up,defrost and cook.It takes     
 about two minutes to cook a pizza and 
 about five minutes to cook a dinner.  
 A dishwasher is a very good thing     
 to have in a house with a big family. 
 It saves a lot of time washing the    
 dishes.A fridge/freezer is also very  
 good.It is the most important thing in
 the kitchen.It freezes the food to    
 keep it for along time,.which means   
 you can use the food when you want to.
 Most people have access to fridges,   
 cookers and washing machines. Many    
 people would find it difficult to     
 manage a home without such modern     
 utilities.                            </content>
