		<title>07        GHOSTS</title>
		<content> So far there are three known ghosts in
 IVER HEATH.The first one is called    
 LADY LILLIAN who lives in a hundred   
 year old house which is now used for  
 malajusted boys.It is called DROMENAGH
 SCHOOL.So far three people have seen  
 her.I myself and two other people.The 
 second poltergeist is in a friend of  
 mines bedroom.The poltergeist turns   
 on the radio  when it is not plugged  
 in or has not got any batteries in.The
 last one is in my house.It is all over
 the top floor of our house.It smashed 
 my sisters glass stereo case twice,   
 chucked her alarm clock at her ,hides 
 my computer tapes,spreads toothpaste  
 in our bath,and generally scares the  
 life out of us.Where my friend and I  
 live our whole street is built on a   
 graveyard. BY                         
              NATHANIEL TURNER and
