   The owner and his wife work full-   
time and employ two part-time staff. He
begins his day by collecting papers    
from the wholesaler at Sevenoaks       
station at 4.00 am. The shop opens at  
6.30 am. and closes at 5.45 pm. The    
average number of daily papers sold is 
1000.( About 100 remain unsold.) The   
three most popular are The Telegraph,  
The Mail and The times. The local paper
sells about 650 copies weekly.         
   About half of the papers sold are   
delivered to customers' houses. 13     
youngsters deliver these. Many         
magazines, comics and periodicals are  
stocked.  Other items sold include     
paper-backed books, sweets, crisps,    
ices, drinks, biscuits and cigarettes  
(about 200 packets daily) and          
stationery.
