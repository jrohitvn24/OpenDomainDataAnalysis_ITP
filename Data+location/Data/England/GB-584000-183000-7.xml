		<content> On a typical Saturday morning my alarm
 clock wakes me up about 7.15. I go    
 downstairs to see what's on TV. At    
 8.30 I make my mum and baby brother a 
 cup of tea and biscuits. Then at 9.00 
 I have my breakfast which is Shreddies
 and milk, sometimes I have two slices 
 of toast. Then I get ready for        
 tennis which starts at 10 and finishes
 at 11. It is called Thorpe Bay Lawn   
 Tennis Club. I meet my schoolfriend   
 Faith there, we aren't very good.     
 Afterwards we go to the tuckshop and  
 buy all our sweets,we eat them in the 
 cadet hut. Then Faith's mum or dad    
 come and pisk her up. I ride home     
 again on my bike. I drink a big glass 
 of icy water. For lunch we just have a
 sandwich and a packet of crisps.In the
 afternoon I play until tea-time, and  
 then we normally have a roast dinner.
