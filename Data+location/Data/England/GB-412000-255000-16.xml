		<title>16HOUSING, HASELOR, WARKS.</title>
		<content> The Crown Inn, Haselor was sold about 
 three years ago and Haselor no longer 
 had its own pub. The buildings have   
 almost been converted into 4 luxury   
 homes. There were going to be 5 but   
 they have only done 4 so far. They are
 quite expensive houses.               
 Morris Cottage is quite a contrast to 
 the new homes that are built on the   
 Crown. It is a very old house that is 
 situated between two others and no way
 of getting to the back unless you go  
 through the house.The walls are made  
 of wattle and daub, the windows are   
 small squares of glass.It is up for   
 sale.                                 
 Hazel Cot,opposite the school,has had 
 some stables built in its grounds and 
 a garage built.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
