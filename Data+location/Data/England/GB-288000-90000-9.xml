		<content>   Sclaters Nurseries is situated in   
 Okehampton Rd. A Priory was built on  
 the site in the Middle Ages. The      
 business was established in 1780 by   
 James Sclater whose family still own  
 and work it.It has been at its present
 site since 1920.                      
   When the priory was demolished the  
 land returned to fields. It has been  
 said that there is a ghost, but it has
 not been reported for many years.     
   Several old clay smoking pipes and  
 other pottery relics have been found. 
   The owner of the nursery now is     
 Mr.A.J.Sclater. Vegetables, bedding   
 and potting plants are grown there    
 with about 100,000 pot plants.        
   Chemical fertilizers are used plus a
 secret family formula. Some plants are
 imported from Holland, Turkey and     
 Ireland. Plants are sold directly to  
 the public or at local markets.       </content>
