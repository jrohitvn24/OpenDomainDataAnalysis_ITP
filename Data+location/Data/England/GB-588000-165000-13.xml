		<content> With the exception of the large farm  
 houses - Cunnells, Coleshall, - and   
 the large houses in Bobbing, most of  
 the property in the area has been     
 built since the first world war.      
 In Iwade, Kemsley and Grovehurst it is
 not difficult to assess the age of the
 houses by observation, and it can be  
 seen that the more modern houses are  
 built to a much greater density.      
 The village of Kemsley was established
 by the mill owners for their workers, 
 but the houses were bought by the     
 Borough Council, who built many more  
 in this area.                         
 The houses in each of the areas are   
 basically well kept, and gardening as 
 a hobby is popular. Most of the houses
 built before 1955 have no garage and  
 this causes parking problems on the   
 roads
