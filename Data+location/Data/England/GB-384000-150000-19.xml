		<title>19WESTBURY&amp;DISTRICT TWINNING</title>
		<content> The Westbury and District Twinning    
 Association was set up as a result of 
 a public meeting in 1977.The          
 Association was formed from people    
 with an interest in twinning together 
 with members from the Council.The     
 Association is completely independent 
 from the Council and self funding.    
 A link was established with Soisy sur 
 Seine,a small town some 20 miles from 
 Paris bounded by the Senart Forest,a  
 favourite hunting ground of the French
 kings.                                
 In 1978 a delegation led by the then  
 Chairman of the Council,Mrs.J Holloway
 took part in a ceremony in Soisy when 
 the Twinning Charter was signed and   
 the keys of Soisy were presented to   
 the Council.In September of the same  
 year a similar ceremony took place in 
 Westbury attended by M.Gaston Rocher  
 Mayor of Soisy.                       </content>
