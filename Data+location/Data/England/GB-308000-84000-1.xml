		<title>01A GENERAL VIEW OF OTTERTON</title>
		<content>  This area combines the interests of  
 Agriculture, the holiday industry and 
 a restful retirement area.            
 The farming is organised by the       
 Clinton Devon Estate. Cereals are     
 mostly grown, with some potatoes and  
 milk production.                      
 Some of the houses in the village are 
 kept as holiday homes and Ladram Bay  
 has a very popular caravan site in a  
 very beautiful position on the cliffs.
 There is an increasing number of      
 retired people living in the village, 
 attracted by the peace and quiet, and 
 the active social life in Otterton.   
 Also the proximity to Exeter,(9 miles)
 Exmouth (7 miles) &amp; Sidmouth (3 miles)
 means that people with cars can easily
 get to the towns if they need to.
