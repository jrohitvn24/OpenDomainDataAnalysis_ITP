		<title>17Transport around Bawtry</title>
		<content>  Bawtry has seen several changes in   
 the modes of transport in the area.   
 Post coaches once stopped at the Crown
 Hotel and at one time there was a     
 thriving river port on the River Idle,
 as is indicated by the name of Wharf  
 Street. Since those days the river has
 changed its course and is not now     
 navigable by large boats. The main    
 east coast railway line passes closeby
 the town but the station is now       
 closed. Thus the people are dependant 
 on private cars or buses. There are 5 
 bus services linking Bawtry to the    
 surrounding villages in both S. Yorks 
 and Nottinghamshire and also Sheffield
 and Doncaster. Bus fares within South 
 Yorkshire are heavily subsidised and a
 journey of 8 miles to Doncaster costs 
 15pence while to travel 3 miles to    
 Scrooby,a village in Nottinghamshire, 
 costs 35pence.                        </content>
