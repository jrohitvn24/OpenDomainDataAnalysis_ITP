		<content>SANDHURST PARISH TO BE LOST            
 The congregation at St.Lawrence's,    
Sandhurst, is 35 - 40 people for the   
one or two services each Sunday. All   
the school children go to Sunday School
regularly.                             
 In a small community a higher proport-
ion of people go to church than in the 
city. The vicar is able to know them   
all and the church plays an important  
role in village life.                  
Sandhurst and five adjacent parishes   
are being reorganised and will soon be 
under one vicar. The present vicar, Mr 
McKinley, is only temporary until 1986.
When the parishes are combined a lot of
this personal contact will be lost.    
 Sandhurst also had a Methodist Chapel 
but this is now being converted into a 
house. A similar chapel is to be found 
near Hartpury though this one, with its
cemetery, is still in use.             </content>
