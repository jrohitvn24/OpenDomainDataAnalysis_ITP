		<content>    Pliocene marine formation at       
 St.Erth                               
      Pliocene is the last geological  
 period and system of rocks before the 
 Pleistocene Ice Age, the beginning of 
 the Pliocene Age is unequivocably     
 marked by a marine transgression.     
 Pliocene rocks are fully developed in 
 Britain, their only representations   
 being a shelly deposit known as       
 'crags' in East Anglia, and small     
 deposits of sand in Kent and here at  
 St.Erth in Cornwall.                  
      Here at St.Erth a deposit of high
 quality moulding - sand which has been
 exploited intermittently since the    
 early part of the nineteenth century. 
 It gave rise to an important foundry  
 at Hayle, where large castings for    
 many early iron structures in Britain 
 were made.
