		<title>20TRANSPORT  TO RAMSGATE</title>
		<content>Ramsgate is well served by most forms  
of transport.Ships have always used the
local harbour which has increased in   
size with the addition of Port Sally.  
The Port has berths for passenger and  
car ferries and container ships.The    
original harbour is large enough to    
take ships bringing in new German cars.
The Inner Harbour has a yachting marina
The first hovercraft service started   
here but moved to Dover.Air transport  
has always been available and is now   
concentrated at Manston military and   
civil airport.Railways run to London in
two directions,through central and     
northern Kent.Road vehicles go to      
London via Canterbury or the Thanet Way
on to the M2 motorway.National coaches 
run daily services to London and other 
parts of Britain.The East Kent Bus Co. 
runs the local bus services.
