    The leisure centre, which opened   
 last year, offers a wide range of     
 activities from tennis to gymnastics. 
 In the holidays children have the     
 opportunity to use the facilities in a
 course called Summer Provisions. The  
 only disadvantage is the cost.        
    One thing which it does not provide
 is a{public swimming pool.}This was a 
 big issue when the centre was first   
 built. Before the Isle became         
 Boothferry in 1974 a leisure centre   
 was planned for Epworth but then the  
 money was diverted to Goole. A golf   
 course was also provided there before 
 we finally had our leisure centre.    
    The nearest swimming pool is at    
 Scunthorpe twenty minutes from here.  
 A pool is necessary in Epworth because
 not everyone has a car and public     
 transport is expensive.               </content>
