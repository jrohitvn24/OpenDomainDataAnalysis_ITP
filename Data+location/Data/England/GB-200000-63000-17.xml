		<title>17TRIGG MORRIS MEN</title>
		<content> My dad is a morris man.Trigg was      
 formed in 1971 and is based at{BODMIN.
 It started with six dancers and one   
 musician. They do traditional dances  
 from the Cotswolds.Trigg's name came  
 from the{Old Hundred of Trigg}which   
 was an administration area of the     
 County.Trigg's costume consists of    
 green baldricks with a chain design   
 which comes from{Celtic}patterns found
 on{stone crosses,}white shirts and    
 socks, black breeches and shoes and   
 straw hats decorated with pheasant    
 feathers and fresh flowers.Around     
 their knees they wear bell-pads. The  
 officers of Trigg are the squire (the 
 chairman), the bagman (the treasurer),
 the foreman (the dance teacher).There 
 is also the fool who keeps the        
 audience amused,the horse who is a    
 symbol of strength and Betty, a man   
 dressed up as a dame.                 </content>
