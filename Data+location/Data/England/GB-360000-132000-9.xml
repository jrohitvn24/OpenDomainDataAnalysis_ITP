		<title>09A day in the life of ....</title>
		<content> It was a Saturday morning when my     
 brother's clock-radio woke me up. I   
 said to him "What are you doing this  
 morning",and he said "Nothing much".  
 I got out of bed, got dressed and went
 into the bathroom and washed my face. 
 At about 9.30 I went downstairs for my
 WEETABIX and turned on the radio . At 
 10.00 I watched television. At 10.30  
 David called for me, and we went to   
 Mrs. Mead's to buy some sweets and    
 David scrounged off me. Up the playing
 field we played cricket until about   
 12.30 then I went home and had sausage
 &amp; chips which my mum got from the     
 chippie and at 2.00 I went to the     
 field again &amp; watched Cary play       
 cricket. At 4.00 I played cricket     
 again at 5.00 I had my tea and at 5.30
 when my mum got home from work I      
 watched tele. At 9.45 I went to bed &amp; 
 watched tele on the portable set.     </content>
