		<content> On Saturday I woke up.Then I got out  
 of bed and went downstairs.I went to  
 the kitchen and had my breakfast. I   
 had a bowl of cornflakes.When I       
 finished I went to get dressed.I went 
 to the bathroom and brushed my        
 teeth.Then I went downstairs. My mum  
 said we were going to Leicester for   
 the day.So I went and sat in the      
 car.My mum said I could have some new 
 clothes and a pair of shoes.We went to
 Macdonalds for lunch.We then went home
 and I watched T.V.I had my tea and    
 went out to play. I watched T.V. again
 before I went to bed.                 
 On Sunday I got up at 9.30 and watched
 T.V. while dad made the breakfast.Then
 I played rollerskating until lunch at 
 1.00.After lunch we played Jasper.We  
 catch each other and join in a long   
 line.Jasper is our bus driver for     
 school.                               </content>
