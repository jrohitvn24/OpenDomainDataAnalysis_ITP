		<title>19Ecton House and Ecton Hall</title>
		<content>Ecton House, formerly called Rectory   
House, was built in 1693. It is now    
owned by the Peterborough Diocese and  
is used as a conference and retreat    
centre.                                
Ecton Hall. The present hall was built 
by the Isted family in 1756 on the site
of what was thought to be an old       
nunnery. The hall is now owned by the  
Sotheby family who built some estate   
cottages in the village. The hall is   
uninhabited and falling down. It is the
centre of much controversy as the      
Borough Council wants it repaired as it
is a listed building. The Hall is now  
up for sale.
