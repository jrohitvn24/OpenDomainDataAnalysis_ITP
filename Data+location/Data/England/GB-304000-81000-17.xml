		<title>17Transport around Salterton</title>
		<content> The railway line from Budleigh        
 Salterton to Exmouth and Sidmouth was 
 closed by an Act of Parliament in 1967
 because the line was losing money.The 
 Station Masters cottage is still lived
 in by the last station master even    
 though the station is now disused.The 
 cottage was built by J.W.Palmers and  
 it was made from an original plan of a
 Swiss cottage.                        
 Private cars and a bus route now      
 connect Salterton with the nearest    
 station at Exmouth but most people    
 going further afield prefer going by  
 car to Exeter and catch main line     
 trains from there.                    
 A private bus company operates from   
 the town and this not only transports 
 schoolchildren to and from Exmouth but
 also provides an occasional bus       
 service for shoppers direct to Exeter 
 14 miles away.                        </content>
