		<title>15Duffield's Dairy-Stanton</title>
		<content>  We interviewed{Mr.Duffield}who told  
 us how he bought a{milk round}of 50   
 gallons a day from a Mr.Brown in a    
 nearby village some 25 years ago.The  
 round is now 1000 gallons a day,which 
 is 8000 pint{bottles of milk.         
  Mr.Duffield wanted a reliable        
 business and chose a milk round       
 because people obviously needed milk  
 delivered every day.                  
  The dairy has ten vans with two      
 spare, which are powered by{propane   
{gas.}There are three main buildings,  
 which are used for the vehicles and   
 the large fridges which hold the milk 
 which he buys already bottled from a  
 large dairy in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.     
  The milkmen have to get up very early
 to start work and arrive to load up   
 from about 3.30am.It is very hard work
 for the milkmen.
