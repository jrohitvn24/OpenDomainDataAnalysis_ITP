		<content>   In 1797 the Ellesmere Canal Company 
 built a branch of the Ellesmere Canal 
 as part of an attempt to connect      
 Liverpool and Bristol by an inland    
 waterway via the Dee, the Mersey and  
 the Severn.  Attempts to reach the    
 Severn at Shrewsbury ended at Weston  
 Lullingfield through lack of money.   
 Weston Wharf, with its limekilns,     
 stables, clerk's house, weighing      
 machine and public house became a very
 busy centre of economic activity.     
 Lime, slate, coal and bricks were     
 brought for sale in the area.   Local 
 timber, cheese and farm produce were  
 shipped out.   The chains for the     
 Menai Bridge were brought by road from
 the Midlands and shipped from the     
 Wharf.  Trade declined with the       
 building of the railway in the 1840's.
