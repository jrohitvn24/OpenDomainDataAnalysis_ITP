		<content> The Headmaster feels the school is    
 attractive due to it s small size     
 (550),caring staff and good careers   
 record.                               
 As 3/4 of the pupils travel by bus    
 after school activities are difficult 
 to arrange.This is a pity as many of  
 these rural children have few         
 opportunities for entertainment.A 14  
 year girl said "Country children are  
 deprived.They have to be ferried from 
 place to place so they can enjoy      
 themselves.Also there are usually no  
 kids of your own age.I have to hang   
 around with kids older or younger.When
 parties and discos are on I can't go  
 because my dad doesn't want to collect
 me so I stay at home,do nothing and   
 get thoroughly bored.I really hate    
 living in a village .Its just so      
 boring that I watch TV,eat and sleep."
 Do boys have a better time?           </content>
