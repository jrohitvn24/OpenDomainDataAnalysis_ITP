		<title>11BERKSHIRE GOLF CLUB.</title>
		<content>   Our class spent an afternoon at the 
{Berkshire Golf Club.} The Club is on  
 the{Crown Estate.} This is land which 
 belongs to the reigning monarch by    
 right of the Crown.  The money from   
 the golf course, mainly membership    
 fees, goes to the Crown Estate and any
 profit that the Crown Estate gets goes
 to the Government.  In return the     
 monarch and his family get an         
 allowance called the Civil List.      
                                       
   The idea for a{Golf Club}was put    
 forward in 1926.  The purpose of it   
 was to encourage people to build      
 houses and to live nearby,but several 
 events have prevented this happening. 
 First, in 1931, the club suffered a   
 financial crisis, then the War came   
 and after it the{Planning Acts}       
 designated it as{Green  Belt}land     
 where no more building may take place.</content>
