		<title>15FAMILY BACKGROUNDS</title>
		<content>   The survey was designed to portray  
 the family backgrounds of pupils in a 
 rural area. Gillingham and Shaftesbury
 have seen their populations more than 
 double in the last ten years.  Indeed 
 it is becoming increasingly rare to   
 hear a real Dorset accent.            
   This influx of people from outside  
 the area was reflected in the birth   
 places of the children's parents, only
 one quarter of the class of twenty    
 actually had parents born in          
 Gillingham.                           
   The statistics also proved, however,
 how popular this area is as a place to
 live.  Once settled here it seems that
 people are very reluctant to move.    
 Those with city backgrounds see the   
 area as an ideal environment in which 
 to bring up their children.
