		<title>14LOCAL HISTORY OF THE TARRANT</title>
		<content>  There must have been a lot of people 
 living in this area in Prehistoric    
 Times Judging by the numbers of       
 barrows in our block.A lot have been  
 ploughed up but these burial places   
 are still everywhere.When the Romans  
 came to the Tarrants they built a road
 which ran from the NE of Tarrant      
 Hinton straight past Tarrant          
 Lounceston and Monkton and onto       
 Badbury Rings.It is not hard to       
 imagine farm carts loaded with        
 corn,officials in their litters and   
 soldiers all using this important     
 road. The Tarrant villages are        
 mentioned in Domesday Book and you can
 still see the field patterns used in  
 the Middle Ages.From the seventeenth  
 century onwards there has always been 
 an army camp in the SW corner of the  
 block.                                
                                       </content>
