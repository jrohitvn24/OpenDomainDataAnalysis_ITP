		<title>10Food Survey-Spennymoor.</title>
		<content> When we surveyed the people in        
 Spennymoor we asked,                  
   {"What is your favourite meal?"     
                                       
     35% said roast beef dinner.       
     19% said steak and chips.         
     11% said fish and chips.          
      8% said salad.                   
      3% said curry.                   
      3% said chicken dinner.          
      2% said egg and chips.           
                                       
 We got many other answers such as     
 Italian food, bacon and eggs, Chinese 
 food and mixed grill. All these things
 got 1%. Things like chips, cornflakes,
 gammon and prawns were all chosen as  
 well.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
