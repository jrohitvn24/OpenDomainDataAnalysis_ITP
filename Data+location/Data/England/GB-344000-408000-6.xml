Pilkingtons do research into glass at  
Lathom. The department moved here in   
1960 and employs up to 900 people.     
{Employees}                            
Analytical chemists test samples of    
glass to see which chemicals are there.
They use electronic equipment so that  
the amount of each chemical is shown on
a computer screen and printers record  
the data. Engineers design furnaces    
for different kinds of glass. They     
first draw designs. The engineers make 
sure that the furnaces are put together
properly. The furnaces are built in    
many countries and the engineers spend 
much of their time overseas.           
Pilkingtons have 50 acres of land      
around the labs. They have gardens for 
recreation and a pond for fishing. You 
can see Pilkingtons from all over the  
district.                              </content>
