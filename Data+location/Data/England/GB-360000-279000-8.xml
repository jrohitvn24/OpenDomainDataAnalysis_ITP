      Bromdon village is curious and   
 entirely off the road three           
 quarters of a mile down its           
 own driveway. It now functions as a   
 privately owned caravan and camping   
 countryside holiday park. The main    
 buildings house the offices, camp shop
 and some of the other facilities.     
      Previously the area was          
 communally owned. It was run as a     
 commune community.                    
      Though it quite close to Farlow  
 school and certainly within our survey
 rectangle, the village of Bromdon is  
 unfamiliar to most of the children who
 undertook our survey.
