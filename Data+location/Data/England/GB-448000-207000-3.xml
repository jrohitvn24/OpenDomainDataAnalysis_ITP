		<content>Pupils at the Dragon private school    
start at the age of 7,then go on to the
main school aged 8-13.Here they have   
boarders.They move up blocks(years) at 
Christmas.They have longer main        
holidays than us(St.Gregory's).They    
have school on Saturday mornings but   
having  Wednesday afternoons off.We    
just have the weekends off.St.Gregory's
caters for pupils aged 9-13,and is only
for day pupils.We move up classes in   
September.The Dragon has its own hymn  
book &amp; magazine,St.Gregory's has       
neither.They have more sports          
facilities including a rifle range,    
squash court,swimming pool &amp; boathouse.
We have sports lessons but the Dragon  
has its sport during their two hour    
lunch break.                           
There is a long waiting list for the   
Dragon school.
