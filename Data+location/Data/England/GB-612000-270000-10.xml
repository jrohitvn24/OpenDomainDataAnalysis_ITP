		<title>10 Farming around Occold</title>
		<content>In our 12 squares we have seen a lot of
arable land. Mostly we have seen wheat 
and barley. The barley is now coming   
into ear and turning yellow. Farmers   
usually start combining at the end of  
July and through August. The barley    
is about a metre high now. There are a 
few rape and sugar beet fields.        
Mr Hull lives on a dairy farm with cows
on it. He milks the cows every day. He 
lives on a farm with 3 children. Their 
names are Tracy, Daniel and Michelle.  
Tracy and Michelle have got one        
horse each. They are called Coral and  
Misty. Before you milk a cow you have  
to make sure everything is clean. Mr   
Hull makes milk and butter with his    
wife. They live in Occold and their    
address is Church Farm, Occold, Eye,   
Suffolk.
