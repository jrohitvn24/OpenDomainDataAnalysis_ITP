		<title>04Hornby Castle</title>
		<content>The original castle was built near the 
River Lune to the North of the village.
The present castle was built in the    
early 12th. Century by Adam de         
Montbegon. Sir Edward Stanley took     
possession of the castle in the 16th.  
Century. His victory against the Scots 
at the Battle of Flodden earned him the
title of Lord Monteagle. His grandson  
warned James I of the "Gunpowder Plot" 
in 1605 as a result of a letter        
advising him to stay away. The castle  
was attacked and seized by Cromwell's  
Parliamentarian troops during the Civil
War.                                   
Since the 18th. Century the castle has 
changed hands several times.Today      
Hornby Castle is owned by the Battersby
family. It is a private residence and  
is not open to the public though the   
grounds are occasionally opened on     
behalf of charity functions.           </content>
