		<content> Darlington Buses carry more passengers
 per bus than any other town in        
 England. There are 56 service buses   
 and 5 services enter our twelve square
 kilometres. Altogether 20 buses enter 
 our area per hour. These are: Service 
 2, 3 times per hour, Service 4, 6 per 
 hour, Service 5, 3 per hour, Service  
 6, 6 per hour, and Service 7, 2 per   
 hour. Darlington buses carry          
 13,939,142 passengers a year. Although
 there are only 36.5 miles of bus      
 route, in a year, the buses travel    
 over 1.5 million miles. Darlington    
 buses started in 1904. No profits are 
 made, so the council gives the company
 Â£300,000 a year subsidy. 218 people   
 are employed by the department.       
 Computers are used to calculate costs.
 Buses run from 4am to midnight. It    
 costs Â£1.68 a mile to operate. A new  
 single decker bus costs Â£63,000.      </content>
