		<content>    {Walsden}is in{Todmorden's}southern
 valley leading towards{Rochdale.}It is
 a quiet{Yorkshire}village with a{     
{Lancashire}postal address.            
     The main part of the village lies 
 in the valley bottom and is surrounded
 by hills and moorland. The valley     
 bottom rises from 480 ft. to 600 ft.  
 above sea level, in about two and a   
 half miles. The western side rises    
 steeply to an extensive plateau at    
 between 800 and 1000 ft. and then up  
 to nearly 1500 ft. The eastern side   
 has a more even slope to moorland at  
 900 ft. rising to 1200 ft.            
     The stream in the valley bottom is
 called the{Calder}by the locals but is
{Walsden Water}on the maps. Also       
 running along the valley bottom is the
 railway, the A6033 and a disused      
 canal.
