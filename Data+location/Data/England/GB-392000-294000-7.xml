		<content>I live on the Ettingshall Park Farm    
Estate,near to the middle. There are   
quite a lot of activities and services.
Near to where I live are two rows of   
shops which include a Spar grocers,Fish
and chip shop, hardware, hairdressers, 
butchers and newsagents. Near the shops
is a public house,"The Three Crowns"   
which is built in a large open space   
making for a larger custom. There is a 
Church of England church right at the  
centre of the estate and just below    
Beacon Hill which holds a wide range   
of activities:- Brownies, Guides,Cubs, 
Scouts, Keep-Fit and Disco's. Our main 
outdoor attraction is the "Beacon"     
covering the whole length of the area  
from Ettingshall Park to Sedgley. It   
is a wonderful walking place with      
grassy fields and a copse. There are   
many species of wild-life. The main    
drawback in the area is vandalism.     </content>
