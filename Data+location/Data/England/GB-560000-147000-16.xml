		<content> There are two farms in Hadlow College 
 they are called Bourne Grange Farm and
 Faulkners Farm.                       
 Bourne Grange Farm is a small farm but
 it has a lot of different crops.This  
 is so the students at Hadlow College  
 can study about the crops and then    
 grow some themselves. Some of the     
 crops are hops,maize,potatoes,turnips 
 and swedes.                           
 Faulkners Farm is a bigger farm but it
 has fewer crops.The students use this 
 farm as well.A large part of it is a  
 dairy farm.Some of the crops and      
 products in this farm are milk,barley,
 spring barley,wheat and potatoes.
