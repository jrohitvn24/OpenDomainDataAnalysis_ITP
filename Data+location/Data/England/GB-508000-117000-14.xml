		<title>14W.CHILTINGTON PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   The first school was established by 
 an endowment of{William Smyth}in his  
 will of 1634. Comprising two small    
 cottages north of the church, this was
 in use from 1635 until 1874 by which  
 time it was quite inadquate for the   
 number of children attending.  A local
 house{"Fryars"}accommodated the school
 until a larger building was erected on
 the site in 1876.                     
  {W.Chiltington County Primary School 
 vacated the building it had occupied  
 for nearly a hundred years in November
 1974 to begin a new era in its history
 in a building of semi-openplan design,
 providing education for children up to
 the age of eleven. In a spacious      
 modern building children follow a     
 wide and varied curriculum, which     
 includes the basic subjects as well as
{art, music, sport and swimming.       
 The{Smyth Trust}still helps the school</content>
