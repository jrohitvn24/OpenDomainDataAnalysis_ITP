		<title>04EDUCATION IN GROVE.</title>
		<content> The gifts of the Vernon family to     
 Grove included a new Church and a Dame
 School.                               
 The Dame School provided for 24       
 children and was adjacent to the      
 Church.The building is now a private  
 dwelling.A much remembered Headteacher
 was Mrs.Crompton.The Dame School was  
 provided principally for the children 
 whose parents worked on the Grove     
 Estate. The children all wore red     
 cloaks,a sight easily remembered by   
 the senior villagers.Shortly before   
 the 1939/45 war,this school was       
 replaced by a village Infants/Primary 
 School with two classrooms.Falling    
 numbers caused its closure in 1967.   
 The building is now a private         
 residence,almost opposite the Garden  
 Centre.Village children now have      
 private transport to attend school in 
 Retford,four miles away.              </content>
