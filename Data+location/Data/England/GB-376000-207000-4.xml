		<title>04Changes in Whitminster.</title>
		<content> Mrs Pocket has lived in Whitminster   
 since 1931. With her son she owns     
 Parklands Farm. She told us how her   
 life had changed since the war.       
                                       
 Modern conveniences such as           
 electricity did not arrive in the     
 village until 1955. Piped water was   
 also rare. Before that arrived Mrs    
 Pocket got her water from a pump in   
 the kitchen by pulling a handle and   
 filling up big tubs. This made the    
 washing very hard work, it took all   
 morning, so it was only done once a   
 week.                                 
                                       
 The farm had no modern equipment which
 meant that all milking had to be done 
 by hand. The farm had beef calves and 
 about forty dairy cattle.
