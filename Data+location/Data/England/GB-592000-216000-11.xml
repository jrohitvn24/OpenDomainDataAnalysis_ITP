		<title>11FARMING IN LAYER BRETON</title>
		<content> The main farm to the east of the      
 village is Nevards Farm which occupies
 125 acres of agricultural land leased 
 to a local farmer. The land, being    
 well drained soil over London clay, is
 ideal for high yield cerea            
 production.                           
 Due to modern farming methods only two
 or three people are employed to work  
 this large acreage.                   
                                       
 The landscape is fairly open and      
 slopes considerably from a height of  
 45 metres to 19 metres, the level of  
 Abberton Reservoir. Well maintained   
 hedgerows allow wildlife to flourish  
 and footpaths throughout the area     
 provide pleasant walks. The presence  
 of electricity pylons crossing the    
 area is a feature of our modern times.
