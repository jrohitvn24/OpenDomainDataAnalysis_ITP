		<title>15A TIBBERTON FARM</title>
		<content>{FARMING}-He is a dairy farmer whith 40
 cows,each is artifically              
 inseminated.He also stores stock. A   
 long time ago there was only one      
 tractor on 25% of the farms.          
{TENANCY}-The farmer dosen't agree with
 tenancy.The farmer himself was a      
 farmer's son and he would like his son
 to take over but the village council  
 have other people in mind.            
{MOTORWAY}-When the motorway was built 
 it created a noise nuisance. It also  
 took away much of the landscape. They 
 intend to widen which is going to take
 away even more of the farmer's land   
 including hedges.                     
{INDUSTRY}- He feels he isn't needed   
 any more,because big industries       
 produce things cheaper,so taking his  
 business.
