		<title>16THE FARMER</title>
		<content> The farmer with the larger farm was   
 born into a large family having 8     
 brothers and 6 sisters many of whom   
 still farm in the area.He has a son   
 and daughter,but he does not care if  
 the farm is carried on by them because
 he feels that the family farm is dying
 out. He lives in a brick cottage      
 adjacent to the church and manor house
 with a magnificent view of his fields 
 and surrounding countryside.He has    
 kept his farm neat and tidy retaining 
 the hedges and old barns. The farmer  
 likes sport for recreation; his wife  
 though prefers hunting.               
 He makes use of a consultant from a   
 firm that offers a Computer service.He
 believes that the future of the       
 British arable farmer will depend on  
 his ability to meet the current       
 economic, political and environmental 
 demands.                              </content>
