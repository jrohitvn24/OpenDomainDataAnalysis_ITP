		<title>14BOURNEMOUTH WEATHER STATION</title>
		<content>   SITUATED IN KING'S PARK NEAR        
 POKESDOWN STATION IN BOURNEMOUTH IS   
 THE WEATHER STATION WHICH RECORDS THE 
 WEATHER AND THE HOURS OF SUNSHINE OF  
 THE BOURNEMOUTH DISTRICT. THE STATION 
 HAS RECENTLY MOVED FROM HURN AIRPORT  
 TO A POSITION WHICH BENEFITS FROM MORE
 SUNSHINE.  MR PETER ROGERS RECORDS THE
 WEATHER ON A REGULAR BASIS AND HAS    
 MANY CONTACTS WITH LOCAL SCHOOLS.  HE 
 RECENTLY GAVE A SERIES OF LESSONS AT  
 KING'S PARK AND ST. JAMES' C.E.       
 SCHOOLS.  IN THE PARK THE SUNSHINE    
 TOWER IS A NOTED LANDMARK ALTHOUGH IT 
 IS UNFORTUNATELY THE TARGET FOR       
 VANDALS. MR ROGERS HAS LOST SEVEN     
 PIECES OF SUNSHINE EQUIPMENT THIS YEAR
 ALONE.
