		<title>07Problems caused by Visitors</title>
		<content> As most visitors arrive by car,       
 parking is a problem.  Using the      
 roadside and verges spoils the        
 appearance of the village, and        
 increasing the car park would probably
 mean using farm land. The increase in 
 traffic has meant widening the road   
 and one bridge.  The two bridges at   
 New Inn could suffer a change in      
 appearance by 'improvement'.  As the  
 need for accommodation has grown some 
 houses have become bed and breakfast  
 establishments.  Cottages have become 
 holiday homes.  A barn has been       
 converted to a Bunk Barn.  There are  
 also two Pot-Hole Club Houses, two    
 School Outdoor Centres and two        
 campsites.  As the visitors increase, 
 so do the problems of footpath        
 erosion, damage to dry-stone walls,   
 danger from dogs at lambing time and  
 litter.                               </content>
