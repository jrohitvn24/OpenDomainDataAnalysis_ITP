		<title>04Some Games I Play</title>
		<content> I play with Lego at home. With Lego   
 you can build almost anything, like   
 space-ships, cars, lorries, houses and
 a space station too. I have many more 
 toys. I have some farm toys. I have a 
 Renault Tractor, a Massey Ferguson    
 Tractor and many more. At school I    
 play "It", where one person chases the
 rest of us. I play lots of other games
 like Knight Rider. I play with my     
 friends Gareth and Steven. I put up my
 1st finger on one hand and I put up my
 1st finger on my other hand. I am the 
 steering wheel of Knight Rider. Gareth
 is Micheal Knight and Steven is the   
 lorry that  Knight Rider parks in. Kit
 is the nickname for the car. We like  
 to play games. They help us to learn  
 and to have fun.
