		<title>09MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE IN B.N.</title>
		<content> **************************************
 We went round Buckland Newton to find 
 how many people have moved into the   
 area. It proved to be a very          
 interesting survey. We found out 17   
 people out of 21 have moved into      
 Buckland Newton.4 out of the 17 have  
 lived elsewhere in Dorset however     
 the main place where people moved     
 from is London. 3 out of 17 have lived
 in a different country before         
 moving to Buckland Newton. We found   
 out lots of people moved into B.N.    
 because they had retired. 2 out of 21 
 are thinking of moving out of the     
 area.                                 
                                       
 This information leads us to reflect  
 that the population is increasing but 
 it is becoming more of a retirement   
 area.
