		<title>17MAYPOLE DANCING</title>
		<content> Annually, pupils of Hetton Lyons      
 Primary School participate in the     
 ancient custom of{Maypole Dancing.}A  
 Mayqueen and her attendants are       
 chosen for this special event and     
 pupils train to perfect dances such as
{"The Plait"}and{"The Spiders Web".    
 The procession begins at the school.  
 Mr. J. H. Piper transports the        
 Mayqueen and her attendants in his    
 green 1929 2_litre Lagonda. As they   
 lead the procession Houghton Schools  
 Band and school children follow       
 behind.                               
 An arrival at Hetton Centre, the      
 Maypole dancing begins to be watched  
 by an appreciative audience. Money is 
 also collected for{charities.}In 1984 
 it was used to purchase and train a   
 guide dog. Through this annual event  
 several people and groups in the      
 community have been helped.           </content>
