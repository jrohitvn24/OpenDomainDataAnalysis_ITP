		<content> WE HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE       
 CONSERVATION OF OUR ENVIRONMENT.WE    
 DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANY MORE POLLUTION.
                                       
 TO HELP,A LITTLE,WE HAVE BEEN TO      
 KIPLIN HALL TO HELP THE BRITISH TRUST 
 FOR CONSERVATION VOLUNTEERS.THEIR     
 NORTHERN HEADQUARTERS IS THERE.WE     
 HELPED TO CLEAR A POND WHICH HAD      
 BECOME OVERGROWN AND SILTED UP,IT WAS 
 SO BAD NO ANIMALS COULD LIVE IN THE   
 POND.                                 
 FIRST OF ALL WE SCYTHED AWAY ALL THE  
 GRASSY VEGETATION.THEN WE LOPPED OFF  
 THE SMALL WOODY SHRUBS AND BRANCHES   
 FROM THE PERIMETER OF THE POND.NEXT WE
 USED A SAW TO SAW OFF THICKER         
 BRANCHES.                             
 LAST OF ALL WE WATCHED THE MEN FELL A 
 LARGE TREE.ALL THE LARGE WOOD WAS     
 SAVED BUT WE BURNT ALL THE SMALL TWIGS
 AND SCRUBBY BITS.                     </content>
