		<title>10Agriculture Around Garton</title>
		<content> Farming is highly intensive and       
 profitable.Chalky soils and a low     
 rainfall make conditions very suitable
 for arable farming.Winter wheat is the
 main crop .Barley,potatoes,peas,rape, 
 and sugar beet are also grown.Because 
 of excellent farming methods much of  
 the grain is sold to seed merchants in
 Bridlington.Other seeds are sold to   
 merchants for animal feeds            
 The high cereal acreage results in    
 successful pig farming.Most farmers   
 keep some sheep and are involved in   
 beef production.Farms are highly      
 mechanised and very dependant upon    
 chemicals.There are even fewer        
 employees than 10 years ago.          
 Recent trends include machines that   
 remove stones and the tramlining of   
 crops.There is more emphasis on cash  
 crops.There are an increasing number  
 of winter crops and less spring crops.</content>
