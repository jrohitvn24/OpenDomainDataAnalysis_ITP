		<title>16LOCAL TRADE IN WEST WICKHAM</title>
		<content>{Shops and Pubs:-}This small village   
 owns 1 quaint little shop cum post    
 office. It is nothing more than the   
 front room of a house. The only public
 house, the White Horse was completely 
 renovated and reopened under new      
 management just a few weeks ago.They  
 also provide meals. One lady sells    
 fruit and vegetables from her house   
 and a local man sells his own         
 woodcraft articles from his house.    
{Businesses:-}There are several self-  
 employed builders, plumbers etc. in   
 the village and there is a small      
 electronic design industry (in the    
 redundant school house) but it doesn't
 as yet employ any local people.{      
{Deliveries:-}Baker,fishmonger,butcher,
 milk and papers-none by local traders.
{LOCAL TRADE IN WESTON GREEN}- This    
 village has the same mobile deliveries
