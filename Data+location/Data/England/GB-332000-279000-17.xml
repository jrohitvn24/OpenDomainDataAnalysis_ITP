		<title>17CLUNTON COPPICE</title>
		<content> Although no longer coppiced the       
 essential nature of the Coppice is    
 probably not much changed from years  
 ago. The steep slopes facing north and
 east are wooded. The original Coppice 
 hill near Clunton is still mixed      
 woodland with it's beautiful colour   
 changes throughout the year. This     
 woodland is to be left undisturbed as 
 a true nature reserve. Wild creatures 
 are the main inhabitants of the       
 coppice.                              
    Coppy Lane runs into Clunton       
 Coppice. It is tarmaced for a mile and
 a half then forks into two lanes, one 
 which comes out at Bush Farm, Clunton,
 the other climbs diagonally up the    
 hill to emerge at Cwm Lane above      
 Clunton. There are eight dwellings in 
 the Coppice. All are occupied though  
 one is a holiday cottage. Residents   
 have to rely on well water.           </content>
