		<title>09THE HOVERPORT, PEGWELL</title>
		<content> The hoverport was built in 1967 but   
 the first S.R.N.6 hovercraft did not  
 carry cars. In summer there were two  
 hovercrafts which went to Calais.     
 Pegwell Bay was an ideal site as it   
 was protected on three sides, is flat 
 and has a good access road.It takes 30
 minutes to cross the channel on a calm
 sea and about an hour in a rough sea. 
  In one year it costs Â£2,000000 to    
 operate one craft and the cost of one 
 craft is Â£250,000. The pilot has to   
 be between 26 and 40 years old.       
 The S.R.N.4 mk 2 carries 227 people + 
 34 cars. The S.R.N.4 mk 3 carries 424 
 people + 55 cars.                     
 The hoverport is now only a servicing 
 depot because Hoverlloyd sold out to  
 B.R. (Seaspeed) at Dover. It would be 
 difficult to see the port in operation
 again now that Port Sally at Ramsgate 
 Harbour is being developed.           </content>
