		<title>13THE WETHERBY WEIR PROJECT</title>
		<content>  During 1980/81 the Wetherby Town     
 Council became concerned at the       
 erosion of the weir on the River      
 Wharfe. In 1982 an appeal was launched
 to raise money for its repair and work
 began in August 1982. August 7th saw  
 the biggest single day's effort. Using
 a caterpillar earth-mover an entry was
 cut into the river from Scott Lane and
 36 cubic metres of concrete, weighing 
 90 tonnes and costing Â£1000 were moved
 across the river and laid to secure   
 two-thirds of the weir top. Four      
 months later, at a total cost of      
 Â£23,000 and after a great deal of hard
 work from a dedicated group of        
 volunteers, the restored weir was     
 completed. During work at low-water   
 level a stone paved river crossing    
 (possibly dating back 1500 years) was 
 clearly visible under the weir.
