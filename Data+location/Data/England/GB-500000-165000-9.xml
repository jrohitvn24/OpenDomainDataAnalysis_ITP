		<title>09BLACK CHERRY FAIR, CHERTSEY</title>
		<content>      The right to hold a fair was     
 granted to Chertsey Abbey in l440 by  
 King Henry Vl.  It later became known 
 as the Black Cherry Fair and was held 
 for centuries before being            
 discontinued.  The fair was revived   
 again in the seventies and is now held
 every year in July.                   
      The procession of floats for the 
 l985 Fair was led by a pipe band.  It 
 started from Stepgates School and     
 progressed through the town to Abbey  
 Fields.                               
      There was a fun fair for the     
 children and displays by Morris       
 dancers and drum majorettes.  A fancy 
 dress competition and Treasure Hunt   
 were organized and the wide variety of
 stalls included; antiques, tombola and
 White Elephant.  The profits are      
 shared between local charities.
