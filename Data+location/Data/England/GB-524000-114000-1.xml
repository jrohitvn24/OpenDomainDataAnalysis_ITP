		<title>01Farmland SW, Hurstpierpoint</title>
		<content> The area lies in the lee of the South 
 Downs. Predominantly arable land but  
 also containing a quarter of the      
 larger village of Hurstpierpoint; the 
 smaller village of Albourne and part  
 of the hamlet of Blackstone, the      
 southern third is more wooded, mainly 
 random deciduous but with one         
 coniferous plantation. The roads      
 passing through run E/W or N/S with   
 the main London to Brighton trunk road
 dominating the eastern sector. The    
 main industry is agriculture with     
 mixed farming mainly cereal crops and 
 cattle and sheep. In recent years     
 smaller units selling garden produce/ 
 requisites have emerged. With little  
 other industry other than local       
 service industry, residents are mainly
 either retired or travel to larger    
 towns outside the block to work.
