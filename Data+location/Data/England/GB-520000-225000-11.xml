		<title>11LITTLE WYMONDLEY HOTELS</title>
		<content> About two minutes drive from the A 1M 
 in this small village there are two   
 popular hotels.{The Blakemore.}This   
 used to be a private mansion in the   
 Georgian style. It has been modernised
 and extended to provide a very wide   
 range of facilities to cater for all  
 from the private dinner to the large  
 business conference, all in a secluded
 rural setting with extensive well land
 scaped grounds.Plans include a new    
 block of self-contained bed sitting   
 rooms for those requiring a longer    
 stay.{Redcoats.}This fifteenth century
 farm house was formerly a Sheriff's   
 home. A Victorian facade has added    
 character and interest to the building
 which was converted from private use  
 to small family hotel in 1970.        
 Specialising in home grown vegetables,
 the hotel is run by a brother/sister  
 team creating a friendly atmosphere.  </content>
