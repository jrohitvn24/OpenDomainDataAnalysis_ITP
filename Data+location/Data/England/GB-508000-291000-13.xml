     DOGS,RABBITS AND FERRETS          
 The dogs we have are used for showing 
 and breeding.At the moment we have    
 two litters-Great Danes and Jack      
 Russell terriers.We also have rabbits 
 which live in cages.We also have 13   
 ferrets which live in big runs,and    
 they live on raw meat.Their job is to 
 catch rabbits underground.
