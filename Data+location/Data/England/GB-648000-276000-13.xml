		<title>13TRANSPORT.</title>
		<content>  Walking is widely practised,for short
 distances. Cycling is inexpensive and 
 popular and the roads are fairly flat.
  The most common means of transport is
 the motor car. Most people own cars;  
 however,their use is declining because
 of high petrol prices of about{Â£2 a   
{gallon.}Taxis are used regularly.     
  Trains run between Ipswich and       
 Lowestoft via Woodbridge, Wickham     
 Market, Saxmundham, Darsham,          
 Halesworth, Beccles and Oulton Broad. 
 There are{13 trains a day,}except at  
 weekends. There is a bus connection at
 Halesworth but the times do not       
 coincide.                             
  Buses run from Southwold to Bungay{4 
{times a day}through Reydon, Blythburgh
 &amp; Halesworth. Transport in this area  
 is poor. The cut in bus services has  
 contributed to the decline in the area
 It is becoming increasingly cut off.  </content>
