		<title>18THE VILLAGE PLAYING FIELDS</title>
		<content> The playing fields are controlled by{a
{trust}and run by a committee which    
 represents the different groups in the
 village.                              
   Sited in the{centre of the village  
 next to the Coronation Hall,they      
 provide a{safe place}for children to  
 play.As the school is built on a      
 restricted site,the children use the  
 fields for their games lessons        
 throughout the year.                  
    There are{swings}and a{see_saw}for 
 the younger children and groups of    
 people organise cricket and football  
 matches for the local community.      
     Funds have to be raised for the   
 maintenance of the playing fields and 
 this usually consists of one grand    
 event in the autumn.
