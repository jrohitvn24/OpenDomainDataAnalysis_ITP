		<title>11AIREDALE SCOUTS AND CUBS</title>
		<content> The 5th Airedale Scout Group meets    
 every Monday night,Cubs               
 6.30,Scouts8.0.The evenings activities
 are based on ceremony,badge work and  
 games.During the Opening ceremony,    
 "Grand Howl"cubs reaffirm their       
 promise and the Union Flag is         
 broken.Games include football and     
 relay races which tend to be rather   
 noisy but full of fun.                
     Badge work covers everything that 
 cubs and scouts learn from sewing on  
 buttons to camp-fire cooking,this     
 being based on the founder Baden      
 Powell's ideas of survival in the     
 great outdoors.                       
 Weather permitting summer evenings are
 spent out of doors working on         
 tracking,cooking,sports etc.          
 In April each year a St. George's Day 
 Parade is held when Scout groups meet 
 to remember the World Wide Movement.  </content>
