		<title>13ASHINGTON CHURCH.</title>
		<content> Ashington Church is dedicated to St.  
 Vincent.There are no electric lights  
 so the church is lit by candles .The  
 candlesticks stand on one long pole   
 and each one holds three candles.The  
 pews at the front are like boxes which
 have seats inside for the rich people 
 and can be entered by a door.The altar
 has a brass cross with two brass      
 candlesticks either side.The pulpit is
 a square shape with a sounding board  
 above it.On the outside of the church 
 is a carving of two angels.There are  
 two parts to the church,a south porch 
 and a west bell_cote.There is also a  
 buttress supporting a bell tower with 
 two bells.On the outside of the main  
 door is a sanctuary handle. A long    
 time ago when a thief was being chased
 by the villagers he could reach for   
 this and then remain inside the church
 without being harmed.                 </content>
