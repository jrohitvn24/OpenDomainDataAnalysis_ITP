to the Rivers Division of the North    
West Water Authority as he feared the  
consequences for wildlife.             
Though no investigation had been       
carried out by the Water Authority an  
investigator had visited Hattersley's  
site and told them to improve the      
drainage. A Hattersley spokesman said  
the matter had only recently come to   
their attention and they had taken     
immediate action. After consultation   
with the Water Authority, it was       
agreed that Hattersley's would build a 
retaining wall around the diesel       
storage tank to prevent the risk of    
oil seepage.                           
Councillor Barker wants a monitoring   
system to identify all pollution       
sources. Our group feel this is an     
important issue and we hope that in    
years to come fish will return.        </content>
