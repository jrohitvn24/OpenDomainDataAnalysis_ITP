		<content> The Amberley Revels and Flower Show   
 was established in thw early 1920's   
 as the May Revels. The present day    
 event also features the crowning of   
 the May Queen. The fete always starts 
 with a procession through the village 
 to the cricket field. This year the   
 May Queen, Donna Bartlett travelled   
 with her 3 attendents in an open top  
 Mercedes. Following in an vintage     
 Southdown Bus were the children       
 entering the fancy dress. There were  
 side shows and stalls. The Flower Show
 had enteries for vegetables, flowers, 
 plants, cookery, needlework, painting 
 and photography. As part of the       
 celebrations a Disco was held at the  
 Black Horse on Friday, and on Saturday
 there was a Barn Dance and Barbecue   
 at the cricket field. There is always 
 an over 70's tea party as well.
