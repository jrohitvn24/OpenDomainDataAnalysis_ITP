		<title>01The Township of Meltham</title>
		<content>{Meltham}with a population of about    
 7000 lies 5 miles to the east of      
{Huddersfield}in a river basin between 
 the River Holme and Colne on the      
 eastern slopes of the{Pennines.}Angles
 are thought to have given it its name 
 after a smelting place when they      
 settled there about 650 A.D.          
  The{textile industry}has existed in  
 the area for a long time,weaving      
 taking place in the cottages before   
 mills were built.Peasant farmers      
 needed to supplement their income,due 
 to the climate and poverty of the     
 soil.{Peat Moorland}and{rough pasture 
 of the higher land used for sheep     
 surround the lower better managed     
 agricultural land, now mainly used for
{dairy cattle.}Looking down on the town
 tall chimneys can be seen towering    
 over matchbox stone houses,all cramped
 together.                             </content>
