		<title>11Caldewell Mill.</title>
		<content> The mill has an over splash wheel i.e.
 the water came in over the top and as 
 such it was more efficient. There is  
 no constant water supply but it was   
 fed by the mill pound at Caldewell.   
 The pound was dug  specially for this 
 purpose and it would fill up during   
 the night and in the morning a lever  
 was pulled in the mill to open the    
 sluices to let it run over the        
 wheel.It used to grind corn and pig   
 grist. The mill was shut down when the
 council drained the land up by the    
 Plough and Harrow pub then  cutting   
 off adequate supply to the pound      
 except in times of flood.
