		<content>                                       
 On Friday 15th March 1985, the Queen  
 passed through Winster.For the        
 occasion the Parish Council gave us   
 all some sweets.We were all given a   
 Union Jack to wave at her and I       
 brought my camera because I wanted to 
 take a picture of her.The Queen was   
 going to Ashbourne to visit a         
 Thorntons chocolate factory.She got   
 an Easter Egg for each of her         
 grandchildren.Mandy,Lee and Kerry went
 to see the Queen at Darley Dale with  
 Cubs and Brownies.The Queen got off   
 the Royal Train at Matlock Station.   
 To commemorte the occasion the Parish 
 Council let Mr.Edwards choose a gift  
 for the school.He chose some          
 binoculars.Elton school came down to  
 Winster to see the Queen too.The Queen
 had a police escort to protect her.
