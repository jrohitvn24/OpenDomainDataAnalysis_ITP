		<content>  There are several buses which go     
through Kersey.They are private bus    
companies which run a service to       
Ipswch,Sproughton,Burstall,Flowton,    
Hadleigh,Elmsett,Aldham and Whatfield. 
On the other route they travel to      
Lavenham,Hadleigh and Ipswich.         
  The Church of ST.Mary is called a    
"wool" church because it was improved  
and decorated in the fourteenth and    
fifthteenth centuries with money from  
the wool trade.                        
  It is made of flint and some         
limestone.One of the windows has been  
filled in and there were at least      
fifteen statues on the Church. These   
were probably destroyed in Cromwells   
time.
