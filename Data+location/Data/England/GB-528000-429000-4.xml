		<content> The coastline at Tunstall has changed 
 dramatically since Roman times.In     
 those days Tunstall was two and a half
 miles from the sea.Today it is        
 considered to be a seaside village    
 with tourist facilities on the cliff  
 top.The village,itself,is only a      
 quarter of a mile from the coast.The  
 cliffs are being eroded at about five 
 and a half feet(1.6m.) every year.The 
 reason for this fast process of       
 erosion is the strong winter gales and
 high tides,which continually wash away
 the soft Boulder Clay.The beach at    
 Tunstall does not afford any          
 protection either,in fact it adds to  
 the erosion,as the beach is mainly    
 shingle.During the winter storms the  
 sea picks up the large and small      
 stones and hurls them at the clay     
 cliffs so increasing the speed of     
 erosion.                              </content>
