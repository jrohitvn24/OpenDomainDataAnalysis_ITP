		<title>18AN EIGHT YEAR OLD'S VIEW</title>
		<content>                                       
 I'm eight years old and I love living 
 here. I hate big towns. I can just go 
 down the road to my friend's house    
 and there are hundreds of trees. We   
 often go into the woods and play with 
 guns,toy guns of course. Its near to  
 nice places and I don't want to leave 
 here ever. It's easy to go to the sea 
 and we go sailing a lot, we can soon  
 get to the Isle of Wight. We learn to 
 row boats and Dad relies on me now to 
 bring passengers from the shore to    
 our boat. Next week I'm going to be   
 invested in the Cubs and its really   
 nice at Cubs. We go trekking, play    
 games and I have been to one camp,we  
 didn't cook. It was at a farm and we  
 had a mini whirlwind, all the grass   
 which had just been cut, blew all     
 around the tent and in our faces. I   
 had fish and chips when I got home.   </content>
