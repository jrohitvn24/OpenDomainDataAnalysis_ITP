 Major development of farm machinery   
has led to a reduction in the need for 
human labour. A survey showed that     
today only 10% of people in the Charing
area are farm labourers but the parish 
records of the Victorian era show that 
65% of working men were farm labourers 
then.                                  
 Today we use chemical sprays to       
control weeds and disease. Oil-seed    
rape has become a major crop in this   
area. It is grown on seven of the eight
crop-growing farms.                    
 Vegetable farming has diminished      
and there are no hops grown here       
now. From our school log book of the   
late 1800Â£s we know  that many         
children were absent as they were      
hop picking. Farmers have              
amalgamated many of their fields so    
less ground is taken by hedges.        </content>
