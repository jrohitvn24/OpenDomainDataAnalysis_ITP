		<title>16 A Poultry Farm</title>
		<content>King Rudding Farm on the edge of       
Skipwith Common has 84,000 chickens,   
kept in rearing cages from a day old to
16 weeks. The farm is part of the      
Blackwood Hall organisation which has a
rearing farm and 3 laying farms.       
Altogether 55 people are employed.     
Their other farms are at Breighton,    
Skipwith and Blackwood Hall itself.    
King Rudding Farm has been operating   
for 16 years. Chicken feed is delivered
from B.O.C.M. A farm worker said he    
worked 7 days a week, as he had to feed
the chickens every day. He starts at   
8am and finishes at 5pm, although the  
hours vary at the weekend. Another     
poultry worker said that he collects   
eggs from 8,880 chickens-from just 1   
battery. He collects roughly 450 dozen 
eggs from one battery.
