		<title>01Haltwhistle town</title>
		<content>     Haltwhistle is a small market town
 situated on the north side of the     
 river South Tyne.  Around it are hill 
 farms rearing sheep and cattle.  A few
 miles to the north is the Roman Wall  
 which attracts many visitors to the   
 town.                                 
    The centre of the town is its      
 market square where a market has been 
 held every Thursday since 1207.  Its  
 busy main street has food shops       
 where all basic commodities can be    
 bought including fresh meat, fruit,   
 vegetables and bread. It houses a     
 library, dentist, blacksmith, travel  
 agency, and a small hospital.         
   For the people in the surrounding   
 area it can supply all their needs,   
 though most travel to Carlisle, Hexham
 or Newcastle to buy clothes or        
 furniture.
