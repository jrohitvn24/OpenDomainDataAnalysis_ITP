		<title>14THE INDUSTRIAL SITE</title>
		<content>  The {Industrial Site}has been there  
 for about twenty years but the        
 factories have changed over the years.
  One of the factories is{Ravensail}it 
 has been on the{Industrial Site}for   
 two years. They set up a business here
 because the owner lived in            
 Okehampton. They have 14 self-employed
 workers and they  make boats. They    
 also have a removal service.          
{ D&amp;D fruit}have been on the{Industrial
{Site}for two months. They set up a    
 business here because they were       
 sending a van down from Barnstable    
 every day. Very soon{G.R.Spinks}will  
 be moving up to{Exeter Road Industrial
{Site}and hopefully{Bondelivery}will be
 moving into their premises once they  
 have moved.                           
{ Cranmere}is another factory and they 
 make ladies' clothes. Their old place 
 was too small so they had to move.    </content>
