		<content> We went to Shipton Oliffe to talk to  
 a farmer called Mr Bailey-Hamilton.   
 He farms 1035 acres land and owns both
 North and South Farms.   There        
 used to be 12 people working on the   
 farm,but now there are only five.   He
 has two combines,eight tractors, one  
 fork-lift truck and trailers and      
 hay-making equipment.                 
 He grows 60 acres of peas,340 acres   
 of winter barley, 280 winter wheat,200
 acres of spring wheat and there are 85
 acres of woodland.  The woodland is   
 there because it looks nice and is    
 good for the game.                    
 He told us that 1982 was his best year
 for crops and 1976 was the worst      
 because of the drought.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
