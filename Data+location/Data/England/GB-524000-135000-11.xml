		<title>11OLD BUILDINGS RESTORED</title>
		<content>{High Street's Ancient Priors,}built in
 the C15th, was renovated in 1924.     
 Timbers and roof were cleaned         
 and replaced. Now a restaurant, it has
 kept its frontage. {The George, also  
{in High Street,}was a house in 1400,  
 then a coaching inn where horses were 
 changed. It has a rare gallows inn-   
 sign. But, built of timber, plaster   
 and tiles, it is now much changed. The
{Punch Bowle}is one of the oldest      
 intact buildings in Crawley, a classic
 Wealden jettied C15th house, once a   
 teashop for motorists but now a bank. 
 Restoration revealing original        
 features has made it attractive.      
 Volunteer restoration of{Ifield Water-
{mill}began in 1974 with research by   
 schools, and public donations. Work   
 continues to repair machinery. C13th  
{Ifield Barn}is now a theatre, rebuilt 
 1968-73 at a cost of Â£26000.          </content>
