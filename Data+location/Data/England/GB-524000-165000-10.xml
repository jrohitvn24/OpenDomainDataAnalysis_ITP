		<content> As in most areas of Britain, there are
 vast differences in the types of      
 housing, standards of living and      
 general way of life within this       
 square.                               
 A small survey of eating habits in    
 part of the square showed that the    
 traditional Roast was the most popular
 Sunday lunch.Many young people enjoy  
 McDonald's or something similar and   
 almost anything with chips!           
 A survey conducted in a local road    
 found the most popular domestic pet   
 was the cat, with dogs second. The    
 most unusual were snakes and tree     
 frogs.                                
 A popular area for holidays is Spain  
 where where people go for sunshine and
 sand.For many people a holiday is the 
 largest single expenditure in the     
 year.It is also one of the most       
 important activitiesof the year.      </content>
