		<title>17Wealthy Living</title>
		<content>   The existence of a number of very   
 large houses,e.g. Daglingworth Manor, 
 The Dower House, Chantry House, The   
 Old Rectory, etc; the conversion of   
 several old barns into luxury         
 dwellings, and the renovating of      
 cottages sold-off by the Duchy of     
 Cornwall(often converting two cottages
 into one large dwelling), has led to a
 number of comparatively wealthy people
 living in the area. Some of them enjoy
 local hunting and shooting activities.
   Their social life is influenced by  
 the equestrian atmosphere of the      
 surrounding areas (where several of   
 the Royal Families have their         
 residences) e.g.3-Day Eventing at     
 Badminton, Polo at Cirencester, horse 
 shows, trials, eventing etc. on the   
 Bathurst and Vestey Estates and at    
 Gatcombe Park, home of Princess Anne.
