		<title>02TONEDALE PAST</title>
		<content> This area gets its name from the{River
{Tone},a small river,which flows       
 through,and once provided water for   
 the woollen mill..                    
 Tonedale lies either side of the B3187
 road to Milverton and is on the North 
 West outskirts of Wellington.         
{LOCAL HISTORY.                        
{  }Tonedale was once taken up with the
{Woollen Industry}(since 1772) and     
 all its life was centred around the { 
{Mill.}The family who owned the mill,  
 owned a great part of Wellington, and 
 many streets were given their name.   
                                       
    The area had its own school and the
 main station for Wellington was along 
 side of the Mill.Since the recent     
 decline in the woollen industry,much  
 of the factory is used for other      
 enterprises and so is the school.The  
 station is also closed.               </content>
