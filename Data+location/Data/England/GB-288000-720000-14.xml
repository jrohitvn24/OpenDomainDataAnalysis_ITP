		<content>     The Crieff{police station}has been
 in King Street since 1900. The station
 is part-time but there are 3 shifts   
 which gives 24 hour cover to a wide   
 area, including Abercairney Estate.   
     There are 3 cars available to     
 Crieff station to cover the rural     
 areas.  They use radio to contact     
 base.  Most calls in the Abercairney  
 area involve accidents or poaching.   
 They have cells to secure suspects for
 short periods.                        
     No part of the Estate is          
 inaccessable to police vehicles.  It  
 would take them 10 minutes to get to  
 the furthest point on the D block.    
     A{999}call can come via the       
 central station in Perth or direct to 
 Crieff itself.                        
     It is reputed that{Bonnie Prince  
{Charlie's}horse was shod there on his 
 way to the battle of{Culloden.        </content>
