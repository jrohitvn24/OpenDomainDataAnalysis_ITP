		<content>Selsdon nature reserve started in 1924 
when the Surrey garden village trust   
gave five acres to a scheme to         
preserve sixteen arces of Courtwood.   
Great support had been given to        
this scheme and a committee was        
formed to raise money to buy           
neighbouring pieces of woodland.The    
plants of Selsdon wood are lovely in   
spring.The spring wood is a sheet of   
bluebells and a world of honey suckle, 
wild roses and in the tangle of the    
grass deadly night shade grows waist   
high.Three areas of the woodland have  
been fenced off as special bird        
sanctuaries to encourage the shyer     
birds.More than 70 species of birds    
have been spotted in  Selsdon wood,    
including tree creeper, long tailed    
tit willow, great spotted wood         
pecker and the house martin.
