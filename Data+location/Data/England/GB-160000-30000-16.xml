		<content> Tourism is important to Cornwall      
 because of the people employed in the 
 tourist industry and the financial    
 benefits for local businesses.        
 Our area is close to one of the main  
 tourist areas of Cornwall with the    
 crowded tourist beaches of Praa Sands 
 and Porthleven only a few miles away. 
 There are many visitors passing       
 through our area and many private     
 houses offer bed and breakfast        
 accommodation during the summer       
 season.                               
 The local shops and pubs depend on    
 their summer trade to supplement their
 low winter takings and without tourism
 many of them would close.             
 Tourism then is important to our area 
 even though no major tourist          
 attractions are actually within our   
 boundaries.
