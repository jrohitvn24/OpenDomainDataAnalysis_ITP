		<title>11Diet and Eating Patterns</title>
		<content>    I looked at what most of the       
 children in my class had to eat on a  
 school day and the way in which they  
 had their meals.                      
{Breakfast}About half the class just   
 had cereal and a drink. Cornflakes and
 tea was most common. One only had a   
 drink of orange and one had Rice      
 Crispies, bacon and egg and an orange 
 drink. Only three others had bacon or 
 egg as part of their meal. Well over  
 half had breakfast on their own. Only 
 four had a family meal at table.      
{Lunch }Six had the school lunch of    
 roast lamb, roast potatoes,cabbage and
 gravy followed by trifle. The rest had
 sandwiches. This is a random example:-
 3 chicken paste sandwiches, a packet  
 of crisps(very popular), lemon squash.
{Evening}Random example:- Chips, baked 
 beans, sausage, coffee. Over a third  
 ate at table with most of the family. </content>
