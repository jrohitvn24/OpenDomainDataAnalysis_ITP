		<title>06FARMING-A FARM LABOURER</title>
		<content>  Mr.Becky,aged 21,has been working on 
 a farm for 5 years.He enjoys his job  
 and the farm covers an area of 300    
 acres.He got the job by working at the
 farm after school and during school   
 holidays and when he left school the  
 farmer offered full time work.He      
 didn't need any qualifications but had
 to serve a three year                 
 apprenticeship.The job involves       
 driving a tractor,milking cows and    
 general stock work.He fears for the   
 future as the farm might be forced to 
 cut down its area or stock for        
 economic reasons or become more       
 mechanised.He loves the work because  
 it changes from season to season.The  
 farm employs two full time men and    
 several seasonal workers.
