		<title>01Mid-Northumberland Farmland</title>
		<content> rolling land mostly 250-300 feet.     
 Settlemets only small hamlets,        
 farmsteads and isolated houses.  the  
 hamlet of Helm is on a prominent      
 hillwith ine views; paxtondean is     
 almost a secret valley, with few means
 of access.  The only service is a pub,
 The Oak, on the layby at Causey Park  
 (Al) Bridge. The A11 goes through     
 the area, and there is a little bed   
 and breakfast trade. Bus routes all on
 the A1, so missing most of the        
 settlements. Hedges neat but gappy    
 (not layered). Some fences. No stone  
 walls, but plenty of houses of        
 sandstone. Plenty of small wood and   
 mature hedgerow trees. Mixture of     
 grass and crops.  Some store cattle of
 mixed breed.  Sheep - both black and  
 white faces, and blue or pink raddle  
 behind.Some old pastures under ridge  
 and farrow.  More completely devoted  </content>
