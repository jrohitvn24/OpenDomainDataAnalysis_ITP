		<content> Clifford's Dairies{(Marlow)}was built 
 in approximately 1890. They took over 
 Hughes Dairies at the bottom of Dean  
 Street. They serve about 500 customers
 a day and they sell about 14 912 pints
 a week. They have 17 milk floats, and 
 employ 26 people. They get the milk   
 from farms in Buckinghamshire and     
 Berkshire, but it is bottled in       
 Bracknell. There are 20 branches of   
 Clifford's Dairies in this area. A    
 milk float can only carry 930 pints of
 milk because of the law.The milk      
 floats that they use travel along at  
 about 15 to 20 miles an hour. To keep 
 the milk from going sour in the summer
 they have curtains on the vans and    
 they put the milk into cool boxes.They
 also sell other dairy products as well
 as fruit juice, bread, potatoes,      
 chickens, tea, coffee and sausages.
