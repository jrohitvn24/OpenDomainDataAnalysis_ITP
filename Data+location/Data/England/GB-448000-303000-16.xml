 cheapest fish which we found was a    
 Goldfish for 50p and the dearest was a
 Golden Orfe for 15 pounds.Some fish   
 come from other countries-they come by
 plane.Some countries they come from   
 are:- America,Japan, and Israel.Most  
 of them are bought through a          
 wholesaler.The farm also breeds a lot 
 of its own fish.                      
      The fish are fed three times a   
 day.The farm also sells pond plants   
 and pond linings.  {Jane
