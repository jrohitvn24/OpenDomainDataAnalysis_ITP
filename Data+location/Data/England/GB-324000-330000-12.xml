		<content> There was once a{village school}in    
 Rhydycroesau but it was no longer in  
 use, the building being used as a     
 village hall. Likewise there was a    
 village school in Pant_Glas. This too 
 has closed and is now divided         
 into three houses. A retired teacher  
 is one of the people who live there.  
 The Pant Glas school opened in 1861   
 and closed in 1945. Most of the       
 children of{primary school}age went in
 Selattyn, though some nearer to       
 Oswestry go to schools in the town.   
 The nearest{secondary schools}are in  
 Oswestry, catering for children aged  
 between 11 and 16. Oswestry serves    
 as the centre for those seeking       
 tertiary education. The town also has 
 a modern{library}which is well        
 patronised by local youngsters        
 engaged in research.
