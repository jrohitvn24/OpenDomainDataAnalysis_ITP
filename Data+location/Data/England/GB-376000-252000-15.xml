      The exterior of St. Edburga's    
 church has some noteworthy features,  
 including the porch at the west door, 
 which was probably originally on the  
 south wall.  There is a sundial on the
 south wall of the tower, which is     
 reputed to be very accurate, while in 
 the churchyard there is a Saxon       
 Preaching Cross.                      
      In the Middle Ages the church lay
 under the authority of the Abbots of  
 Pershore, who also owned the Manor of 
 Leigh.  The original Manor House was  
 adjacent to the church and passed into
 private hands after the dissolution of
 the monasteries.  The present house,  
 Leigh Court, is on the same site but  
 of much later construction.
