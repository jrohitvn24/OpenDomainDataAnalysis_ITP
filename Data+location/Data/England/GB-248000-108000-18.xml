		<title>18PETROCKSTOWE FARMS AND STOCK</title>
		<content> Over 90% of the area is farmland and  
 we studied 14 farms, accounting for   
 79% of the 12 sq.km survey area. Farms
 range in size from 70 - 450 acres, but
 the{average is 168 acres.}The princi- 
 pal stock is{sheep,}with an average   
 flock of 250 per farm but a total of  
 5000 sheep + lambs in the area, or 2  
 for every acre farmed, although 1 farm
 grazes 6 sheep per acre. The stock    
 pattern has changed since 1980 due to 
 economic pressures on dairy farmers.  
 Nonetheless there are still some 1000 
 cattle, with 5 dairy cows to every 4  
 beef stock. Additionally there are 200
 pigs, 50 poultry + game birds.        
 Generally stock is mixed: only one    
 farm runs sheep exclusively &amp; one is  
 purely a cattle farm. Let grazing     
 accounts for 10% of the acreage       
 farmed. Stock is generally sold at    
{Hatherleigh's}weekly auction{market.  </content>
