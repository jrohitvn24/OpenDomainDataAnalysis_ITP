		<title>01TOFTWOOD AND WESTFIELD AREA</title>
		<content> This block lies immediately south of  
 the town of East Dereham which has a  
 population of 13,000. Toftwood is a   
 suburb of this town and it consists   
 almost entirely of private housing,   
 built from the 1960s onwards. Over    
 5,000 people live in Toftwood. On the 
 edge of Toftwood is a light industrial
 estate built by Breckland District    
 Council.                              
 The village of Westfield is 3 miles   
 south of East Dereham and has a       
 population of just under 200. It is a 
 desirable residential area but        
 possesses few amenities.              
 The majority of land in this block    
 consists of rich arable farmland and  
 scattered farmhouses. Our survey      
 includes information about these three
 different land uses.
