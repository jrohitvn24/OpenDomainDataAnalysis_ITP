		<title>15Religion _ Leck area</title>
		<content> People in our area largely belong to  
 either the Methodist or Anglican      
 churches. The people who live in the  
 villages are usually Anglican whereas 
 the outlying farms are Methodist. The 
 Anglican churches can no longer       
 support a vicar each and so several of
 the parishes have been amalgamated.   
 Whittington, Arkholme, and Gressingham
 on the west side of the river Lune    
 have joined together and Melling,     
 Tunstall, and Leck will soon do the   
 same. Congregations in the Anglican   
 churches have fallen over the years   
 whereas the Methodist church appears  
 to retain its strength. Methodist     
 farmers tend to send their children to
 the local small secondary school at   
 Hornby where they spend five years    
 before returning to work on the family
 farm.                                 
                                       </content>
