  Built in the 1860's as part of Lord  
 Palmerston's Portsmouth defences      
 against the French. The guns pointed  
 away from Portsmouth to the North to  
 protect the city from inland attack.  
  During the world wars it was used as 
 a barracks. In 1980 it was taken over 
 by the City Council in a derelict     
 state. Youth Training Scheme members  
 and volunteers have restored part of  
 it which is now used as an activity   
 centre for young people. It offers    
 opportunity for a residential stay,   
 archery, craft, judo, karate, camping 
 and other outdoor pursuits.           
  In the underground tunnels used for  
 orienteering there is supposed to be a
 ghost.
