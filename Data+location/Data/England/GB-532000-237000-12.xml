		<title>12TUTHILL MANOR</title>
		<content> One of the most outstanding houses in 
 the village is Tuthill Manor which    
 stands in an elevated position to the 
 North of the Church. The site of the  
 manor is believed to date back to     
 Roman times and evidence of a Norman  
 Castle has been found in the grounds. 
 The earliest part of the house        
 dates from the 15th century, that     
 being a Beacon House. By 1563, a large
 open hall had been added &amp; around 1600
 the residents, the Turner family,     
 added two wings. Later,the house was  
 converted into cottages which were    
 occupied until the 1950's. In 1961 Mr.
 Rex Corbett bought the now derelict   
 buildings and for 17 years, he and his
 wife,Elma, have devoted every spare   
 moment to restoring the Manor to a    
 home of outstanding charm and beauty  
 with a dream garden which reflects the
 hours of love bestowed upon it.       </content>
