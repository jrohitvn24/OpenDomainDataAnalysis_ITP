		<title>14ILCHESTER BYPASS</title>
		<content>  An elderly resident said,"The bypass 
 has stopped flooding of houses and    
 neighbouring fields,but the traffic is
 quite heavy on the bypass (Approx.150 
 yrds from the end house) and could go 
 through Yeovil instead,as a great deal
 of noise is produced for as long as 24
 hours a day.The new road does not pass
 through Ilchester Mead thus preventing
 accidents.The new road may be fast but
 is a railway the answer?"             
   {Housing                            
 Ilchester Mead is a small estate      
 80_100 years old with varying sizes of
 gardens and car parks.There are no    
 shops.Ilchester is 750 yrds up the    
 road.
