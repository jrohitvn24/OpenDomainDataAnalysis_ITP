		<title>05St. Bartholomew's Church</title>
		<content> The area has two churches, both of    
 the Anglican tradition.Saint          
 Bartholomews built in 1850 is on the  
 west side of the village of Wickham   
 Bishops. The church tower is 120ft.   
 high and topped with a spire. The     
 building is constructed of kentish rag
 and caen stone and cost its donor Miss
 Sarah Leigh Â£4000. In 1985 there are  
 about 125 members on the electoral    
 roll. Three services are held every   
 Sunday. There is a Sunday School and a
 young people's fellowship. A mid-week 
 womens Christian fellowship meets in  
 two groups and is ecumenical in nature
 as there is no church other than the  
 Anglican in the village. The church   
 hall houses a nursery school which    
 meets daily.
