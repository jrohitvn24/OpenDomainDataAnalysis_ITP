		<title>15        WEST STOKE</title>
		<content> West Stoke is a little village on the 
 road from Funtington to Chichester.   
 There is not much there except some   
 pretty houses and cottages,a few farms
 and a very nice church.The church is  
 very old and in the churchyard is a   
 Dorset Horn ram which belongs to Fr.  
 Johnson. He breeds sheep and has some 
 more in his other church at           
 Funtington.The most interesting thing 
 about West Stoke is a house called    
 Woodend. The people who owned it were 
 called de Bathe, and one of their sons
 married the famous actress Lily       
 Langtry in 1897. His father was not   
 very pleased and threw him out,so     
 they  lived in Hollandsfield, another 
 house in the village.
