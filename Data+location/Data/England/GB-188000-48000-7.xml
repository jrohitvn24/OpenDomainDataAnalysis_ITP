		<title>07Employment in Ladock</title>
		<content>  The children of Ladock School found  
 that the most popular job in Ladock is
 working on farms around the parish and
 the next popular is working for       
 E.C.L.P. A few people work in shops in
 Truro and other towns. Steven         
 Sheppard's dad works on a Diving      
 Rig in Scotland. He is a diving       
 instructor and he teaches about 50    
 people at one time. Tamsin Hannan's   
 dad works at a fire station in London.
  About half the young people have jobs
 quite near to where they live. The    
 rest are unemployed.                  
  87% of mums work as well as being    
 housewives. Many mums work or help on 
 farms.                                
  Most grandads are retired or work    
 quite near. Only a few grandads work  
 away and very few grannies go out     
 to work. {
