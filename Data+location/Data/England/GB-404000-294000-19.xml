		<title>19  A SPECIAL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Kingstanding Special School caters for
 handicapped children up to the age of 
 19. One class consists of severely    
 disabled pupils, who are blind, deaf  
 or brain-damaged, many of whom cannot 
 walk or feed themselves without help. 
 Most pupils travel to school by       
 special bus and live at home, but some
 live in special homes for the         
 handicapped. The school day begins at 
 9.10 and ends at 3.10. Favourite      
 subjects include music, physical      
 education and swimming which takes    
 place at the local comprehensive      
 school. Social training includes      
 visits to a local shopping centre and 
 staff and pupils are currently        
 planning a visit to a nature reserve. 
 Several of the children enjoy horse   
 riding. The staff are all specially   
 trained to cope with the problems the 
 children face.                        </content>
