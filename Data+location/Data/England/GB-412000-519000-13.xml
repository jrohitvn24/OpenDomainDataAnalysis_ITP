		<content> The carnival Queen led the floats. She
 had two small attendants and one large
 one. The floats were great. There was 
 the House of the Rising Sun which was 
 Chinese and Puff the magic Dragon     
 which had a dragon's head that kept   
 going up and down. The Teddy Bears    
 was made by the brownies and won first
 prize. The Guides were dressed up as  
 'flappers'. There was a mock army     
 tank, Andy Pandy and many more. The   
 fancy dress was judged in age groups  
 and many people won. There was a brass
 band from Middleton in Teesdale and   
 four jazz bands. When the procession  
 finished there were the competitions  
 in the Scarth Hall. There were some   
 marvellous things such as paintings,  
 collage and decorations. On Sunday    
 afternoon it was the sports, where    
 everyone joined in. It was all great  
 fun, especially the three legged race.</content>
