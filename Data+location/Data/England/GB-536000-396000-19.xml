{Grainthorpe Hall}in 1916. His father  
 farmed 250 acres employing 3 men,plus 
 a housemaid. Tom went to{school}on    
 Taffy,a pony.He remembers - seeing an 
{aeroplane}in 1916,{ steamers}on the   
{Louth Navigation Canal}and{"Fasten    
{Penny"},when farmers hired workers in 
 Louth Market place and sealed it with 
 a shilling.He left school at 14 and   
 worked on a farm.Then a year in {     
{Grainthorpe Mill}at 3 shillings a day 
 ,followed by a lifetime's farming. He 
 has rung the {Church bells}for 61     
 years,and also sung in the {choir}and 
 mown the{churchyard}.During the {last 
{war}he was on the Intelligence Staff  
 of the{Home Guard}.He thinks that the 
 village was more closely knit years   
 ago,due to the influx of newcomers.
