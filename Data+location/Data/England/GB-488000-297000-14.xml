		<title>14The Harringworth Viaduct 2</title>
		<content>    This Viaduct, completed in 1878,   
 spans the Welland from Seaton to      
 Harringworth. 2,500 men helped to     
 build it, and they were paid between  
 Â£1 and Â£3 per week, according to their
 skills. Huts were erected to house    
 these workers, and the Railway Mission
 came to try to convert them. They were
 said to be a 'rough and ready lot' by 
 the local residents, and were often   
 caught drunk or poaching.             
                                       
    Many of these immigrant labourers, 
 or 'navvies' would have moved on once 
 this branch of the Midland Railway was
 built, but some settled. Certainly,   
 the lurcher dogs they liked to keep   
 are still found in the area.          
                                       
    The land belonged to Colonel Tryon,
 great-grandfayher of the present      
 landowner, Mr G.T.G.Conant.           </content>
