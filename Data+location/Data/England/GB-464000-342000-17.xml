		<title>17SHELFORD-ATTITUDES</title>
		<content>  The people in Shelford had moved into
 the area for a number of reasons,some 
 to work on the farms,one to work in   
 the public house,one to work in the   
 Post Office,others because they       
 preferred the quiet life of a village 
 to that of a town.Some inhabitants    
 have remained in the village all their
 lives.                                
  All the people questioned were of one
 mind as to the disadvantages of living
 in Shelford.They all felt that they   
 needed somewhere to buy provisions and
 a more regular bus service.There is no
 shop and there are only 4 buses a day 
 from Shelford Village to Nottingham.  
  Several clubs and societies cater for
 all the age groups.There are Girl     
 Guides,Boy Scouts,Cubs,Brownies, a    
 Youth Club,Mothers' Union,Women's     
 Institute and an Over Sixties Club.
