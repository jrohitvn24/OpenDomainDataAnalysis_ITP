		<content>Wendover Parish Council has spent      
25,000 pounds on refurbishing the      
central Clock Tower building. This is  
now a Tourist Information Centre and   
Committee Room. Parishioners and local 
residents raised over 30,000 pounds in 
order to convert part of St.Mary's     
Church into a community centre.        
Project '83 has resulted in a fine     
reconstrution known as St.Mary's       
Centre, which is well patronised.      
Pebble Brook School is shortly to be   
extended in preparation for its new    
use- a  school for maladjusted boys.   
The building of a new Youth Centre     
is well under way, sighted within the  
campus of the 3 schools. Consideration 
is being given to market traders' site 
rent. Wendover Middle School has       
received much public acclaim and press 
coverage through its involvement in the
BBC Domesday Project 1985/6.           </content>
