		<content> Back at home everyone has now left the
 house except me. After clearing away  
 the breakfast things,I have a bath &amp;  
 dress in jeans &amp; shirt. With the      
 family away at school all day &amp; having
 taken a packed lunch of sandwiches,   
 fruit &amp; a biscuit,the main meal of the
 day is prepared for the evening. The  
 tendency is towards healthy eating    
 although some of the fattier foods are
 still considered acceptable. On       
 special occasions the family may go   
 out for a meal. This will normally    
 consist of three or four courses &amp; can
 cost anything between eight &amp; eighteen
 pounds per person depending on the    
 venue &amp; if wine is served. After the  
 evening meal is over,the chidren may  
 have some homework to do. They go into
 their rooms &amp; manage to complete their
 work amid the offbeat sounds of todays
 pop music".                           </content>
