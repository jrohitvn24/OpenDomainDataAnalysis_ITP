		<title>13Anglican Minister</title>
		<content> Jim Woodhouse is the minister at the  
 local Anglican Parish Church.         
{Q. How do you think All Saints Church 
{serves the people of the town?}       
 A. Mainly by offering the worship of  
 God regularly; the occasional offices 
 like baptisms, weddings, funerals     
 etc.. Myself and other members of the 
 church are always available to serve  
 in whatever way we can.               
{Q. Does the congrgation of the church 
{cover all age groups?}                
 A. Yes, but it's stronger in some age 
 groups than others. People from early 
 middle age onwards seem to be the main
 part of the congregation, and it's    
 significant that a lot of people come 
 back to church as they have more      
 responsibility in life eg. if they    
 have a family. We lack people from the
 teenage to the thirties really.
