 breeding. Mr Millar, the farmer,      
 specializes in crossing Charalaise    
 with Fresian to improve  milk &amp; meat  
 quotas. Sheep farming is on the       
 increase now.                         
 The crops grown are  hay, wheat, rape,
 beet  and oats.                       
 Up Sydling Farm is the most modern now
 of all the farms and is refered to by 
 the older farmers as a "Factory farm".
 The soil is mostly chalk downland but 
 there are patches of good soil.

 well and take good care of their land.
