		<title>04WYTHALL NURSERY</title>
		<content>{ WYTHALL NURSERY}has been owned by the
 Moseleys since 1894 and the adjacent  
 farmland since the 17th century.The   
 Moseleys grow their delicate plants   
 in pots as the soil in and around     
 Wythall is too heavy for planting.    
 Some plants are grown in oil-heated   
 greenhouses.                          
 Sometimes the temperature in the green
 houses is as high as 80-85C.They use  
 chemical and organic fertilizer.They  
 sell their produce to {Birmingham     
{Wholesale Market}but they also have a 
 stall in the Bullring Shopping        
 Centre.The Moseleys like living and   
 working in Wythall, though they did   
 say that they liked it a lot more in  
 the old days when fewer people lived  
 here.Their hope for the future is     
 that their children will carry on the 
 nursery that their greatgrandad       
 started.     {SILVERMEAD }            </content>
