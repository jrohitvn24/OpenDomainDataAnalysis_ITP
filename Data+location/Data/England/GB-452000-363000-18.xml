		<content> It was Saturday,my dad said we were   
 going to Mansfield shopping.We parked 
 for two hours,it cost 40p.Then we did 
 our main week's shopping at Beauty    
 Care and at Tesco's,a large shopping  
 centre,the cost was Â£21.52.           
 We had dinner of chips,peas and       
 steak.Then we went to the swimming    
 baths,that cost 30p. each.We decided  
 to spend two hours there,then went to 
 the tuck shop and went home.          
                                       
{TRAGEDY STRIKES                       
 That night on television we were told 
 about a fire at{Bradford}football     
 stadium.They said it happened so      
 suddenly that many people did not     
 escape.                               
                                       
 Fifty six people died in that fire.
