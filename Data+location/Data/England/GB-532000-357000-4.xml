		<content> At 7a.m. every week day I get up and  
 get dressed.I go downstairs for my    
 breakfast. After breakfast I clean my 
 shoes and get my packed lunch ready   
 for school.This consists of           
 sandwiches, crisps, biscuits and a    
 drink of orange. At 8.25 my dad takes 
 me  to school.We play outside until 9 
 am.In that time we play football. When
 a whistle is blown everybody lines up 
 and the teacher comes round to each   
 class which has its own line.She tells
 us to go into class for lessons up to 
 10.30a.m..Then we go out to play for  
 15 minutes and come in at 10.45       
 a.m.When we come in from play we do   
 maths cards or other work such as     
 writing a story or english work       
 cards.We go into the hall at 12       
 o'clock for our lunch.when we have    
 eaten our lunch we go outside to play 
 for 45 minutes.                       </content>
