		<title>07HOUSES IN WATCHET</title>
		<content> The oldest houses in Watchet are      
 situated near the harbour, where the  
 town first sprang up. Development     
 spread South and East, where gradually
 modern building styles have evolved.  
 Terraced houses form the majority,    
 although there are many semi-detached.
 A minority is detached. Few houses are
 thatched; most have tiles or slate    
 roofs. Chimneys vary in size and      
 decoration and the newest houses have 
 none. Many older buildings have three 
 storeys. Modern buildings include two 
 storey houses, bungalows, and         
 purpose-built flats. Many buildings   
 are necessarily on a gradient. They   
 are built chiefly of stone or brick,  
 sometimes with external rendering.    
 Doors are often painted in different  
 colours, and windows sometimes        
 double-glazed. Most houses have a     
 small front, and larger back gardens. </content>
