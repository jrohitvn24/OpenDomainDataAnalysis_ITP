		<title>12RISELEY NEWSLETTER(2)</title>
		<content>      My job as editor is to collect   
 the items for inclusion. A week before
 the closing date for the submission of
 items I ask the bookings secretary of 
 the Village Hall for details of the   
 events due to take place in the       
 Village Hall in the next couple of    
 months. I contact the appropriate     
 organizations, if they have not       
 already contacted me , and ask them if
 they would like me to publicise their 
 events . (Regular users of the        
 Playgroup, the Lower School Parent    
 Teachers Association, and the amateur 
 theatre group, the 'Riseley           
 Players'.).  The Parish Council also  
 use the Newsletter. The local         
 community college regulary publicise  
 their courses in it.  To sum up,items 
 of interest to the village come to me 
 from various sources.  At the end of  
 each Newsletter,there is a "For Sale".</content>
