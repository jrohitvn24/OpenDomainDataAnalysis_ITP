		<title>16HAILES WOOD 2 MANAGEMENT</title>
		<content> Coppicing may have developed over 4000
 years ago but didn't become widespread
 until the Norman conquest.There is    
 evidence of lime &amp; hazel coppice.In   
 medieval times the monks from the     
 Abbey maintained this method of       
 management.They probably replanted the
 original sessile oaks with penduculate
 oak standards.The demand for coppiced 
 wood declined after 1900.The wood is  
 now actively managed for timber and as
 a game covert. Sections of the wood   
 have been replanted;there are stands  
 of larch,poplar,norway spruce and     
 cherry.Ornamental species such as     
 cherry laurel and northern red oak    
 have also been planted.               
 The wood has a very rich assemblage of
 shrubs and trees.
