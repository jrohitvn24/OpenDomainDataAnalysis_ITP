		<title>17GEOLOGY OF LIMPSFIELD</title>
		<content>  Limpsfield is a typical medieval     
 strip parish, identical to its        
 neighbours of Oxted, Tandridge and    
 Godstone in cutting across four       
 geological outcrops.  Limpsfield      
 village developed from Domesday times 
 on the dip slope of the{Lower         
{Greensand Ridge}escarpment where the  
 water table throws out springs.  The  
 High Street has eleven wells.  The    
 Greensand also provided ironstone and 
 ragstone for building.                
  At the scarp foot the{Gault Clay     
 formed a broad vale picked out by the 
{River Eden}liable to flooding but     
 providing wet meadowland.             
  Sheltering the vale, the{North Downs 
 chalk escarpment gave arable land     
 along the lower slopes and beechwoods 
 for pigs on the sharp scarp edge.     
  South of the{Greensand}the Wealden   
 forests gave oak for timber housing.  </content>
