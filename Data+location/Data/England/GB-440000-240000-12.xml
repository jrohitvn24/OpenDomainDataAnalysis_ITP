		<title>12School Day 1.00pm.-3.15pm.</title>
		<content>At 1.00pm. the bell goes for the start 
of the afternoon. First the register is
called, and then we go to Assembly with
the exception of Mondays. On Tuesday   
the Headteacher tells us about things  
happening during the week and grumbles 
at us for things we have done wrong.   
Wednesday is hymn practice and Thursday
and Friday is teacher and class        
Assemblies. After Assembly I some times
continue with my project work, doing   
practical investigations. Some         
afternoons we sing and play musical    
instruments and we often have games    
such as stoolball, rounders, and       
kickball. I choose to do art work in   
the afternoon rather than in the       
morning. This year I have done         
collages, lino-printing, painting etc. 
We usually finish with a story before  
going home at 3.15pm.
