		<content>The area here is a farming area.We     
have a man who rears chickens,a horse  
breeder,a specialist pig farmer,a dairy
farmer and the rest are mixed or arable
farms.                                 
     From our survey we have found that
19 people in the area work on farms.   
     Houses called "farms" are         
sometimes not occupied by farmers as   
some farmers have taken over smaller   
farms and the farmhouses have been     
sold. From our survey we found that    
all the farmers who live in Walgrave   
are called Knight and they are all     
related.

farm.He buys "day old" chickens,rears  
them and in 18 weeks, when they will   
be   ready to lay eggs, he sells       
them to other farms.
