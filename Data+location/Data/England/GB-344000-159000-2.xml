		<content>   Generally the area has beautiful    
 scenery with minor roads and pathways 
 for pleasant walks. There are a       
 number of small communities, separated
 by farmland.There has been some       
 ribbon development along the line of  
 A38 and Stock Lane.At the time of     
 writing there are plans to build large
 numbers of new houses as well as      
 infilling.This is causing some        
 controversy locally.                  
   The plan is to complete the building
 of houses in an area boarded by the   
 A38, Stock Lane,Pudding Pie Lane and  
 Ladymead Lane.According to the 1930's 
 Ordnance Survey there were only two   
 properties in this area;Churchill     
 Primary School and Hotel Farm, or the 
 Stag and Hounds Hotel as it is now    
 known.150 houses are to be built      
 shortly to complete the block.
