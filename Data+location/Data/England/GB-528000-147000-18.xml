		<title>18   EAST SURREY HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>    The East Surrey Hospital is in     
 Earlswood.It was built two years ago  
 in 1983.To build the hospital it cost 
{14}million pounds and{3}million to    
 buy paint,beds,equipment,etc.The      
 building is special because of its    
 shape.It is a{Nucleus}design.It is    
 built this way because it is cheaper  
 and saves time. It is only the second 
 one to be built like it in the        
 world.It took{two}years to build and  
 one and half years to plan.Altogether 
 there are{603}members of staff. There 
 are{8}main wards and{28}beds in each  
 and{243}beds in the whole hospital.   
    All the beds are fire proof.All the
 doors in the hospital are thick.If    
 there is a fire it would take half an 
 hour to burn through the doors.This   
 helps to make the hospital very safe.
