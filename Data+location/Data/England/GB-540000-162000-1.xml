  Keston is a beautiful place to live  
but it is inconvenient. It is essential
to have a car to get anywhere because  
of the transport but if you have a car 
it is easy to get into Bromley and     
then into London quickly.              
  The farmers in this area are annoyed 
a their E.E.C milk quotas which mean   
that their profits are cut and they are
only just making a profit. Some of the 
residents consider the area to have    
too many horses which means that what  
used to be a peaceful area is          
inundated with people riding.
