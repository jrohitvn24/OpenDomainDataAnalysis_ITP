		<title>04Farming around Medburn</title>
		<content>                                       
     A local lecturer in Agricultural  
 matters gave us a talk about farming. 
    We walked along a public footpath  
 across fields from Medburn to Darras  
 Hall,looking at what was growing.A lot
 of the land was water-logged;machines 
 were digging drainage channels to lay 
 pipes.Most grazing land is being      
 improved for cereal crops.            
     "To-day the class went on a walk. 
 When we got to{Medburn}some of the    
 mums went home. We saw a horse; Nola  
 said it was called Buttercup.We found 
 a post-box which had Edward V11 on it.
 We went past Donkins' Farm. The field 
 was all dug up and some men were there
 with bulldozers.On our drive around to
{Medburn}we only saw a few cows; we    
 think it was{barley}growing in the    
 fields we passed."
