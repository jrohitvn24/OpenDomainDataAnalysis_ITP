		<title>19ORMSKIRK RUGBY CLUB</title>
		<content> The Rugby Club is the largest sporting
 club in the square. It has a club     
 house on the playing fields near to   
 the centre of town. The land is leased
 from the Council and therefore there  
 is difficulty in expanding the        
 facilities. However three years ago in
 1982 the club was extended.           
    The Club is a "Junior" Club and    
 mainly plays local teams. However one 
 ex. player, Frank Anderson did play   
 for England against the All Blacks,   
 after he had joined a larger club.    
   The club is very friendly and in the
 winter the large open fire in the club
 house is a welcome sight after a hard 
 game.                                 
   The Club runs five sides and often a
 Colts team and many of the members and
 the players stay for many years.
