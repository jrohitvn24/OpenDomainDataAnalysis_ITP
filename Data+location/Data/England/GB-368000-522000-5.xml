		<title>05DUFTON HAY RAKES</title>
		<content> Rakes have been made in Dufton for 90 
 years.Like most village joiners, this 
 one also serves as the local under-   
 taker.There are two styles of rake,   
 each do the same job, but customers   
 have preferences. It takes 2 weeks to 
 mske 50-60 dozen rakes,but some weeks 
 are spent just sawing wood.The shanks 
 are imported from Malaysia as squared 
 lengths &amp; the rest of the wood is     
 taken through all its stages from tree
 to finished product on these premises.
 English ash is used &amp; local birch for 
 the dowels.Each van load is taken to  
 Wigan _about every 2 or 3 weeks _ a   
 good chance,incidentally,toget to the 
 bigger shops.This is a family business
 with one extra man employed.The       
 electric machines all need constant   
 attention from 1 or 2 individuals &amp;   
 keep the joiner,his wife,his father &amp; 
 one other busy full time.             </content>
