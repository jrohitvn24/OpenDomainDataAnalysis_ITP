		<title>18THE BRUSHMAKERS' ARMS,UPHAM</title>
		<content>      The Brushmakers' Arms is a quaint
 and picturesque building about 450    
 years old.                            
    Long ago it was used as a meeting  
 place for the brush makers of         
 Hampshire, but it was and is still a  
 Public House as well. In fact it was  
 one of the twelve most haunted pubs in
 the country.                          
    During the 16th. Century a miserly 
 old brushmaker called Chicket was     
 robbed and murdered whilst lodging at 
 this Inn. His ghost was said to have  
 been heard counting coins and pacing  
 the room above the Bar. The murder of 
 Chicket happened on the same day as   
 the Tudor warship the "Mary Rose" sank
 in Portsmouth Harbour and it is       
 rumoured that his murderer was aboard 
 the ship. Since the raising of the    
 "Mary Rose" no further footsteps or   
 chinking coins have been heard.       </content>
