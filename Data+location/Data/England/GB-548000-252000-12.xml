		<content>   Historically, the area was          
 important from the 1 Century BC as an 
 Iron Age hill fort, defended by the   
 Catavellauni, as it overlooked the    
 river valleys that joined just south  
 of Cambridge. For East Anglians       
 journeying from Colchester to the     
 Midlands and the North, the Romans    
 built a road past  Wandlebury over the
 Gog Magog hills and crossing the      
 Granta valley.                        
   During the Napoleonic Wars the      
 height of the land was again          
 important. A telegraph system using   
 nine shutters was used to signal      
 messages between Newmarket to the     
 North and Therfield Heath in the      
 South. Thus a message could be sent   
 from Great Yarmouth to London in under
 3/4 hour.                             
   Today MAGPAS uses an aerial erected 
 on Hill Top Farm.                     </content>
