		<content>   The Frimley Railway Aqueduct was    
 built to allow the railway to pass    
 under the{Basingstoke Canal.}In 1900  
 the aqueduct was lengthened by two    
 arches as the railway was widened.    
   Trade on the canal declined and it  
 was derelict by 1966 when it was      
 partially restored. In 1977, 600 Canal
 Society volunteers arrived on the     
 Deepcut flight of locks to begin{The  
{Deepcut Dig.}The amounts of materials 
 used in{The Deepcut Dig}were: 10 tons 
 of sand, 18 concrete mixers, 400 bags 
 of cement, 90 tons of ballast, \ ton  
 reinforcing material, 3500 bricks,    
 4 dumper trucks, 14 hand powered      
 concrete breakers and 100s of power   
 tools. 1400 pints of beer where drunk.
   Restoration of the canal continues. 
 In 1981 British Rail drained and      
 relined the aqueduct; 20 of the 29    
 locks are now working                 </content>
