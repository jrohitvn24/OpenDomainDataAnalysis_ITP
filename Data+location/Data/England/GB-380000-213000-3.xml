		<content>  The Beaufort/Tuffley Complex is one  
 of the features of the area enjoyed by
 the local residents. It is cited as   
 one of the attractions of Tuffley.    
  The Sports Centre attracts 6500      
 people each year, from babies to the  
 over 65's. Most live locally. Others  
 come from as far afield as Stroud and 
 Cheltenham. The most popular sport is 
 badminton.                            
  At the Evening Centre Yoga and       
 Coastal Navigation prove very popular.
 P.E. and Swimming classes for the     
 mentally handicapped are well         
 supported.

 1000. Attendance at their meetings    
 varies between 30 and 150. Its

 Show and Fete. This event is locally  
 famous and very popular.
