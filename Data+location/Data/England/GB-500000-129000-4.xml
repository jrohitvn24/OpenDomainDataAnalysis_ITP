 the woods around Loxwood and Plaistow,
 and are often encountered crossing the
 roads.{Wild rabbits}cause farmers a   
 great deal of anxiety in the area, as 
 do{mink.}After the Second World War a 
 number of people went in for mink     
 breeding and there was once a mink    
 farm at Bucks Green. When the mink    
 escaped they began breeding in the    
 river banks, producing large litters  
 and causing concern to the River      
 Authorities.                          
{Kingfishers}are often seen by the     
 river and in the woods, as are{Yellow 
{Wagtails, Nightingales, Barn Owls amd 
{Herons.                               
{Sea trout}are frequently caught in the
 river, and{brown trout}also.
