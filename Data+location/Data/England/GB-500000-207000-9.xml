		<content> AT POTTEN END THE GRASS AROUND THE    
 POND IS LEFT TO GROW WILD AND ONLY    
 FOOTPATHS ARE MAINTAINED TO ALLOW     
 PEOPLE TO WALK AROUND THE GREEN.      
 THE GRASS IS TO ENCOURAGE INSECTS TO  
 VISIT AND STAY IN THEIR NATURAL       
 ENVIRONMENT,SUCH AS THE BUTTERFLIES   
 AND MOTHS THAT LIKE THE WILD GRASS,AND
 PLANTS THAT ARE LEFT TO GROW.         
                                       
 THERE ARE RED ADMIRALS,PEACOCKS AND   
 TORTOISHELL BUTTERFLIES. POTTEN END   
 POND ALSO ATTRACTS OTHER LIFE TO IT,  
 THAT OF PEOPLE.                       
                                       
 AT ONE SIDE OF THE POND THERE IS AVERY
 PICTURESQUE PUBLIC HOUSE THAT NOT ONLY
 THE LOCAL PEOPLE USE,BUT ALSO PEOPLE  
 FROM THE SURROUNDING DISTRICTS. IN THE
 SUMMER THEY SIT OUT ON THE GREEN AND  
 BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT  
 THEY ARE IN.                          </content>
