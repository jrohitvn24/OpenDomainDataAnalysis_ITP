		<title>14Billingham Folklore Festival</title>
		<content> Every August Billingham is transformed
 for the Folklore Festival. Posters and
 flowering baskets appear and stands of
 seats are errected. The stage is built
 and microphones tested. Visitors      
 wearing traditional costume go        
 shopping. When the festival begins the
 stands fill up with people. All groups
 are present for the opening ceremony. 
 They parade through the town centre   
 playing music. This year (1985) the   
 21st festival was celebrated. The     
 festival first started to attract     
 people to the new shopping centre.    
 Every year up to 14 groups are invited
 to take part. There are no            
 competitions and groups come because  
 they enjoy showing their dances.      
 Groups have come from Poland, Italy,  
 Hong-kong, China and South America.   
 The festival lasts for 8 days.
