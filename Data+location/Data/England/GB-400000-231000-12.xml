		<content>   Our questionnaire asked people about
 their shopping habits. Where do they  
 shop, how do they get to the shops and
 how often they shop?                  
   Although people do use the village  
 shop for day-to-day needs most go to  
 the nearest towns to do their main    
 shopping. Cheltenham is the most      
 visited, followed by Tewkesbury,      
 Winchcombe, Bishops CLeeve and        
 Evesham. The vast majority of people  
 go by car to do their shopping. The   
 only bus service runs to Cheltenham   
 and back. Almost everybody shops      
 weekly. Most people grow some of their
 own produce in gardens or allotments.
