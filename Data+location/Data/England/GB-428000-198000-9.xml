		<title>09  Farming in Radcot area.</title>
		<content>                                       
  There are seven mixed farms in this  
area the largest being 550 acres. Some 
farms specialise in beef cattle but    
most have a milking herd, Freisans are 
definitely the most numerous cattle. At
least two farms have small flocks of   
sheep. Recently, owing to new E.E.C.   
milk quotas, farmers have had to reduce
their milking herds and consequently   
have increased acreages of arable land.
 Five of these farms are run as family 
businesses and offer employement to    
local workers. One farm is owned by a  
city businessman and is run by a       
manageress. The seventh farm is owned  
by a professional person who lives in  
the farmhouse and leases the land to a 
local farmer.                          
 In the past, small individual farms   
have been amalgamated to form the      
present more manageable areas.         </content>
