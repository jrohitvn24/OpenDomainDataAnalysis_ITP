		<title>06CLUTTON-a Cat story</title>
		<content>  The name of my house is Cuckoo Drift.
 There are lots of cuckoos and the     
 house is built over a {mine}that was  
 called the Drift.Before the builders  
 started our house, they had to fill   
 the mineshaft which was about 200 feet
 deep.When they had filled it with     
 stones up to 150 feet, they went home.
 The next day my cat fell down the     
 hole. The fire brigade came. One      
 fireman went down a ladder with a     
 bucket to fetch her. The next day a   
 newspaper reporter came to take a     
 photograph of my brother Mark and me. 
 The builders finished off,putting 5   
 feet of concrete all over the floor.  
 My brother sleeps just over where the 
 mineshaft was. There is still a steel 
 hook on his wall which was used in the
 mine.
