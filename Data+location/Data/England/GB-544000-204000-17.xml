		<title>17FARM &amp; LANDSCAPE CHANGES-1</title>
		<content> While this area has remained rural,   
 with clumps of trees dotting the open 
 fields,there have been many changes.  
 The open grassland of the{Common,}with
 its varied flowers,was ploughed in the
 1940s,leaving only the broad overgrown
 verges along part of the Rye Hill road
 Closure first of the Dunmow rail link,
 serving Felsted,then closure of the   
 refining plant there,has made sugar   
 beet an uneconomic crop hardly grown. 
 Membership of the EEC in the 1970s led
 to increases in{cereal growing-}first 
 wheat then barley-then to a rapid fall
 in dairying and{ploughing of grassland
 and recently planting of{large areas  
{of oilseed rape,}turning most of the  
 landscape golden in late May and early
 June with its flowers.Some farmers are
 now looking for a substitute for this 
 crop when the inevitable surplus leads
 to controls on rpoduction.            </content>
