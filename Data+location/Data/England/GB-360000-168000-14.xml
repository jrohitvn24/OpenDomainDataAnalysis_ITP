		<title>14Stockwood shopping centre.</title>
		<content> The main shopping centre in{Stockwood 
 is to be found in Hollway Road and    
 Stockwood Road. The customers like the
 Stockwood shops very much because they
 give quick, personal service. They    
 are convenient, and there is a good   
 variety of shops. For daily           
 purchases the old people in the area  
 (particularly from the old people's   
 home) shop here because the shops are 
 so accessible. Younger people with    
 transport go to other larger shopping 
 areas such as the{Asda Superstore}or  
 the City Centre in{Bristol}or{Bath}for
 their weekly shopping or major        
 purchases like furniture, clothing,   
 major electrical goods etc.           
 Lots of people are of the opinion that
 a local superstore would be a great   
 asset to the area of Stockwood.
