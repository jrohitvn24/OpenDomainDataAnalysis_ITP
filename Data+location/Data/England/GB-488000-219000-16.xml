		<title>16Footpaths</title>
		<content> The footpaths in the area cross the   
 farmland to connect Wing with Mentmore
 and Crafton, and Ledburn with         
 Mentmore. Some of these are rarely    
 used and it is only recently that     
 'Public Footpath' signs have been     
 erected to show their positions. This 
 follows a heightening of interest with
 the formation of local footpath       
 societies and ramblers' clubs. In     
 fact, the path which crosses Ledburn  
 Farm is now ploughed, although access 
 is not restricted. It is cheaper for  
 the farmer to plough a whole field,   
 which he has done because the path is 
 hardly ever used. All these paths     
 cross the stream, a tributary of the  
 River Ousel, at tiny bridges at       
 intervals along its course.
