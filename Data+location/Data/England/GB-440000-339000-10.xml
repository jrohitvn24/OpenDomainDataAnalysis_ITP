		<title>10A BETTER VILLAGE--T.WESTON</title>
		<content> IF I COULD IMPROVE STANLEY COMMON I   
 WOULD HAVE A LARGE SWIMMING POOL      
 BECAUSE THE NEAREST ONE IS IN         
 ILKESTON.                             
  I WOULD HAVE A SLIDE ON THE          
 RECREATION GROUND FOR CHILDREN TO PLAY
 ON.                                   
  I WOULD LIKE A SUPERMARKET BECAUSE WE
 ONLY HAVE FOUR LITTLE SHOPS.          
  I WOULD HAVE A BIGGER SCHOOL WITH    
 SWINGS,SEESAWS,SLIDES AND OTHER THINGS
 AND I WOULD HAVE A FEW MORE CLUBS LIKE
 ROLLER SKATING AND OTHER THINGS LIKE  
 THAT.                                 
  LAST OF ALL A CAFETERIA AT SCHOOL SO 
 WE COULD CHOOSE.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
