		<title>16Transport</title>
		<content> The people in our area rely on cars as
 their main means of transport.Every   
 home in our survey had a car.Over half
 the houses had more than 1 car.83% of 
 all the cars were British ,we thought 
 there would be far more foreign cars. 
 Ford and B.L. were the most common    
 makes.Out of the 36 people in our     
 survey more than 30 people had        
 travelled by air,only 4 had not.There 
 were many fathers who used air        
 transport for their work_quite a few  
 travel by air each week.The people of 
 Ashton do not use trains very much    
 because most people have  cars.Only 1 
 person in the survey used rail regula_
 rly and 13 used it sometimes.Again the
 bus service like the train service was
 not used regularly at most only 3     
 people used it often,23 sometimes and 
 11 never.In Ashton and Manley no one  
 has seen an electric car.             </content>
