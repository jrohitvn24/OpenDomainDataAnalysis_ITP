		<title>08The Old Mill Nursery.</title>
		<content>     The{Old Mill Nursery}has been     
 selling plants and trees since l969.  
 Before this started there was an old  
{paper mill}on the site.               
                                       
     They grow their own plants and    
 sell them in{Newport Market}on Fridays
 or to people who come to the nursery. 
                                       
     The owners have no employees to   
 help them,{just the family.} They     
 advertise on a post just outside the  
 Old Mill Nursery and another on the   
 main road.                            
                                       
     The plants are arranged in a piece
 of land an{acre}in size. They sell pot
 plants, bedding plants, trees, tray   
 plants and open ground plants.The Old 
 Mill Nursery has four{glass houses.}  
 Two}are heated by oil and the other   
 two by solid fuel.                    </content>
