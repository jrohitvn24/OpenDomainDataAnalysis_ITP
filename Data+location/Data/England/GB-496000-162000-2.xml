		<content>                                       
 On our walk we stopped off at the     
 Chobham{Post Office}and a{postman}was 
 going right across it on his{bicycle  
 and Mrs Eccles took a picture of him, 
 also this is an amenity.              
                                       
 We{walked}for a long way and we came  
 to Chobham Common and photographed    
 the{motorway,}which goes right across 
 the common.{Chobham Common}is a       
 stretch of land which is used for     
 leisure.                              
                                       
 We came to some{nurseries}near        
{Jubilee Mount}which we took pictures  
 of. We found a{Bus stop}and we took a 
 picture of it because it is a{bus     
{route.}                               
                                       
 I took some pictures of people and    
 other{shops.                          </content>
