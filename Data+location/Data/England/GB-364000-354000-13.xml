		<title>13Cheshire Cheese.</title>
		<content> Our area is famous for its dairy      
 farms.The soil produces good,rich     
 grass and this feeds a lot of cows    
 which give the creamy milk which goes 
 to produce the world famous {Cheshire 
{Cheese.}The rainfall is very even     
 through out the year,with an average  
 of 740mm so farmers can rely on       
 getting a good crop of grass to feed  
 their cows.                           
 Cheshire Cheese used to be made on the
 local farms, but not many of them make
 cheese these days and there aren't any
 cheese producing farms in our area.   
 When Cheshire Cheese is made on a farm
 it is called {Farmhouse}and this is   
 the best kind that you can get. To be{
{Farmhouse}it has to be made entirely  
 on the farm.                          
 Nowadays, most farmers send their milk
 to factories to be turned into cheese.
