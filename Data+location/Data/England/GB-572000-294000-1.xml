		<content> Our Area.                             
                                       
 Our area is situated in the region of 
 West Norfolk adjacent to fenland.The  
 main settlements are Methwold,        
 Brookville and Northwold.Methwold and 
 Northwold have a number of shops      
 schools and churches while Brookville,
 which owes much of its present size to
 the establishment of a late Victorian 
 fruit growing colony,has one shop and 
 post office.The villages are typical  
 Norfolk 'working villages'.The major  
 employer in the area is the sugar beet
 factory at Wissington.Methwold has a  
 Monday market and many people visit   
 the area in summer to attend the      
 Summer fete and to visit our          
 church.The parents of Methwold's      
 school children are particularly      
 generous raising over Â£2,000 this     
 year.                                 </content>
