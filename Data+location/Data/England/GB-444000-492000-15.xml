		<content> My name is Christopher,I am 7 years   
 old.In my spare time I like riding my 
 bike.I have a special bike called an  
 MX14 which is designed for racing.My  
 friends and I like to make ramps to   
 jump off &amp; we race round a track in my
 garden.Once on the green I jumped     
 about 1.5 metres.I am hoping to get a 
 helmet and some pads for my knees  &amp;  
 elbows for my birthday to wear when I 
 ride my bike.                         
 When Robert &amp; Richard come outside I  
 play football,often in goal.          
 Once a week I go swimming to the baths
 at Thirsk.I have got a badge for      
 swimming 200 metres and I am now      
 working for my bronze badge.I have to 
 swim 800 metres.                      
 My mum makes me go to recorder lessons
 after school every week.I do not enjoy
 this but I have to go.
