		<content>   {H.M.S.Daedalus}is a big{Fleet Air  
{Arm}base.It has yellow hangars as big 
 as ten garages. The roads and run-ways
 are endless;winding in and out.In one 
 of the hangars there are about twenty 
{Wessex helicopters}lined up in a row. 
 Their tails and rotor blades are      
 folded up to make more room.The       
 helicopters have used up all their    
 flying hours and are no longer in     
 service although it is possible that  
 they could fly. There are also about  
 four aeroplanes in the hangar opposite
 the helicopters,one is a{Swordfish.   
    The helicopters and aeroplanes look
 a lot bigger in real life than they do
 in the films.                         
    The helicopters in the hangar are  
 used by the trainee engineers to      
 practise on.Once a year the base is   
 open to the public .This day is called
{Air Day.                              </content>
