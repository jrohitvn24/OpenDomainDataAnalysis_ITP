		<content>  {Queenio.Queenio} :-  One person is  
on and stands with her back to         
everyone. She throws the ball over her 
shoulder.  Someone catches it and      
hides it behind their back.  Everyone  
puts their hands behind their backs.   
They shout "Queenio, Queenio who's got 
the ballio. Is she fat or is she thin  
or is she like a rolling pin."  The    
person on turns round and asks someone 
to turn around.  The person turns      
around without showing the ball.  If   
the person sees you have not got the   
ball the player on shouts "Empty       
dustbin". The player on can run        
through everyone and shout "Make way   
for the Queen." She repeats these      
actions until she knows who has the    
ball.  Then that person is on.
