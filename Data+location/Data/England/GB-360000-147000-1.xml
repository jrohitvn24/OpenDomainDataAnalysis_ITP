		<title>01SUMMARY OF OUR AREA</title>
		<content>       Our square is in the county of  
{Somerset}near the Avon border, on top 
 of the{Mendip Hills.}It consists of   
 the parishes of Ashwick and Binegar,  
 with the villages of{Oakhill, Gurney  
{Slade and Binegar,}and the hamlets of 
{Ashwick, T'other Side of the          
{Hill, Maesbury }and {Neighbourne.     
 The{countryside}is gently hilly and   
 covered in fields of grass and        
 decidous trees seperated by hedges    
 or mortared walls. The buildings are  
 mostly old and of grey lime stone with
 red clay tiled roofs.                 
   Inhabitants of the villages leave   
 the villages to go to work in the     
 surrounding towns.{Employment}in the  
 area itself comes from 1 roadstone    
 quarry, a Brewery, a Maltings and     
 other small rural industries.  Most   
 of the area is covered by dairy farms.
 Tourist attractions are few.          </content>
