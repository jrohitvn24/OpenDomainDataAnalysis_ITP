 residents of Headcorn and although    
 this area East of the village is more 
 sparsely populated, the gardens are   
 well cared for, resulting in colourful
 displays of{Flower-beds,Rockeries}and}
 neat{Lawns.}The clay soil here is     
 rather heavy,so it is advisable to use
 additives like Peat, Phosphates or    
 Compost.This enables gardeners to grow
 most kinds of plants successfully -   
{Vegetables, Flowers, Fruit}and{Shrubs.
 INDOOR GAMES and other pursuits are   
 held in Headcorn Village, where there 
 is a wide choice of activities for all
 to choose from -{Badminton,  Dancing, 
{Women's Institute}and many more.      
 There is one{Public House}called the  
 "Black Horse"situated on the bend of  
 the main A274 road when entering the  
 Village from the South, where a game
