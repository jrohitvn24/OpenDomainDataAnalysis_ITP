		<title>13WALKING COUNTRY IN STRETTON</title>
		<content>   The most popular walks in Church    
 Stretton are hill walking. The        
 longest hill, the{Long Mynd}is the    
 favourite. There is also a steep walk 
 up{Caradoc.}If you want to visit the  
 cave you have to go to the top first  
 and then scramble down the hillside to
 the cave.                             
   Often there are sponsored walks in  
 Church Stretton. One of the biggest is
 the{SAVE THE CHILDREN WALK.}It is 15  
 miles long, over the Long Mynd to the 
 Bridges pub and it starts and finshes 
 at Church Stretton School. Most of the
 walk is up hill. It is a lot of fun   
 but tiring and lots of people get     
 blisters.                             
  {THE LONG MYND HIKE}is more difficult
 and covers 50 miles, eight hills and  
 6000 ft in 24 hours. The winner's time
 in 1985 was 9 hours 16 minutes. Church
 Stretton is a wonderful place to walk.</content>
