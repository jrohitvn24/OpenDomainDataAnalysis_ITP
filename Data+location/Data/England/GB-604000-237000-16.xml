		<title>16SOCIAL CONCERNS IN WENHAM</title>
		<content>Much concern has been expressed at     
local parish council meetings regarding
pollution of the stream which is the   
parish boundary between Capel St.Mary  
and Great Wenham.Effluent from the pump
house in the neighbouring parish       
overflows into the stream creating a   
health hazard.This overloading is      
caused by the great increase in the    
population of Capel St.Mary.Plans to   
renew this pumping station in 1987 have
been made by the Anglian Water Authori 
ty  In the meantime residents are      
angry  about the lack of maintenance   
since provision for this has changed   
from Ipswich to Colchester.Reliance is 
now placed upon a warning light at the 
pumping station and a phone number.    
Deragging operations have to be carried
out every 2 to 3 weeks to remove debris
such as disposable nappies which clog  
the pump and are then stored in bins.  </content>
