		<content> There is one canal and one river.These
 are both used for Fishing,Boating,    
 Barging and Canoeing.Every two years, 
 there is a big fancy dress boat race. 
 They go from Micklethwaite to the Five
 Rise Locks.                           
 The main fishing competition is at the
 Gala which is held every year.        
 For canoeing they go up and down the  
 canal and the finals are held six     
 months after.The canal is called the  
 Leeds and Liverpool Canal,because of  
 the two main cities that it runs      
 through.                              
                                       
 BARGES                                
 People often use barges for holidays  
 or just to pass time.There are two    
 types of barges-Continental and Open  
 Air.The open air barges are used just 
 for the day and are literally open air
 with a base underneath for eating in. </content>
