		<title>12HACKFORD WALK</title>
		<content> My walk begins in the centre of       
 Hackford where there is a house called
 Firtree House because of the firtrees 
 lining the edge of the garden. Then   
 there is marsh. On the other side of  
 the road there is a marshy field.Lots 
 of animals live there like pheasants, 
 peacocks and badgers. Some of the     
 houses are new but most are old. There
 is a river about half a mile away from
 the marsh. There is a post box near   
 the river. There are many grassy      
 fields in Hackford. In Church Lane    
 there is an old village hall that has 
 been changed into a house. Next to    
 this is a porch and two paths. One    
 leads to St. Mary's church and the    
 other to an old ,derelict house with  
 ivy growing over it. A quarter of a   
 mile away is an old pub,the King's    
 Head,now a private house. The         
 shop is also closed.                  </content>
