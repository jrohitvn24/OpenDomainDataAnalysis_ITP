		<content> Farming has been the main occupation  
 in the area for generations, and is a 
 major source of employment today. Many
 of the farms have been run by the same
 families for generations. Most of the 
 farming families having one of three  
 possible surnames, everybody seems to 
 be related, however this is now slowly
 changing. The type of farming         
 undertaken is dairy cows and intensive
 grass cultivation for feed. In the    
 summer all the fields seem to be full 
 of docile freesian cows, some corn is 
 grow and like the cut grass, this to, 
 is fed to the animals during the      
 winter months. Chickens, free range,  
 are kept on a number of farms mainly  
 for use by the family. One farm breeds
 chickens for the local chicken factory
 for sale to the public.
