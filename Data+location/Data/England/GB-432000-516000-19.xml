		<title>19BOARDING KENNELS</title>
		<content> My name is{Daniel Shield}and I'm      
 eleven years old.I used to live       
 in Sadberge,but now I have moved to   
{Hurworth}which is a village 7 miles   
 away.About a year after we had moved  
 we set up{boarding kennels}for        
 dogs.(And we also will look after     
{cats.)}My mum runs the business and my
 dad works as an agricultural supplier.
 We have enough kennels for 10         
 dogs.With only having a few my mam can
 give each dog a lot of attention and  
 care.we have a two and a half acre    
 field which the dogs get walked around
 3 or 4 times a day.The dogs get fed   
 any food that the owner wants.My mam  
 usually feeds the the dogs at about   
 6.oo p.m.It costs around{Â£2}a day to  
 keep a dog in the kennels.I hope this 
 business lasts a long time.
