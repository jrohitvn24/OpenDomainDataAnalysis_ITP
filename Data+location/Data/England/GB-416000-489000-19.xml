		<title>19LOCAL CUSTOMS</title>
		<content>   Although today life here is much the
 same as elsewhere in the country,some 
 of the old customs and superstitions  
 still remain.                         
                                       
   One such custom is St.Magdalena's   
 Fair.In 1321 Edward II granted the    
 right to hold a weekly market at      
 Geoffrey Scrope's manor of Constable  
 Burton and a yearly fair on the feast 
 of St.Mary Magdalene (22nd July).     
                                       
   For the past few years the villagers
 have held a modern "fair" with        
 stalls,sideshows and many games.The   
 school children perform country       
 dances.An ancient custom revived.     
                                       
   A superstition which still exists is
 that surrounding the murder stone     
 reputed to be on the site where a     
 murder took place.                    </content>
