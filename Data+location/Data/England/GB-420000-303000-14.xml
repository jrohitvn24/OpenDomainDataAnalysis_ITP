 Children enjoy watching and playing   
sports. Swimming is probably the most  
popular sport that children take part  
in.                                    
 Our school goes {swimming} on         
Thursdays and we have two sessions at  
the local pool. Every fourth year who  
leaves our school this year (1985) can 
swim. You can go for a series of       
badges, red, green, yellow, white,     
bronze, silver and gold.               
 Many boys enjoy playing {football}.   
Our  school team plays in green and    
white hoops. Some girls play in the    
school netball team.                   
 In the summer term we have a {sports  
day} where mums and dads come to watch 
us. Everyone is in an event. We have   
sprints, potato races, sack races, egg 
and spoon races and skipping races.
