		<title>01OVERVIEW LACKHAM DERRY HILL</title>
		<content>     This area is an essentially{rural 
 area dominated by an escarpment       
 running north-south through the centre
 of the block.                         
     There are isolated pockets of     
 habitation which look to the villages 
 of{Lacock}to the south west and{Derry 
{Hill}to the north east for community  
 contact.                              
     The upper reaches of the Bristol  
 Avon runs through the block providing 
 a haven for{wild life.                
     The{National Trust}is evident in  
 this area with its ownership of two   
 tracts of land which are preserved to 
 allow superb views over the Avon      
 valley.                               
     The main sources of employment are
{farming and tourism}but the area also 
 acts as a{dormitory}for industry and  
 commerce in nearby towns. ther is a   
 large{agriculture college}at Lackham. </content>
