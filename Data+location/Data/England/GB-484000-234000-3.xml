 fashion.There are a group of people   
 called casuals who wear labelled named
 clothes.These are like Lacoste,       
 Ellesse and Nike.These are very       
 expensive.An Ellessee T shirt could   
 cost over Â£35.A whole suit of all     
 different could cost over Â£100.       
   There is another group of people
