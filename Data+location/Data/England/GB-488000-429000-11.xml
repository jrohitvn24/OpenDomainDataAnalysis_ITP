		<content> CAVE CASTLE HOTEL.                    
    Cave Castle used to be the home of 
 the Barnard family.  They owned a lot 
 of land in South Cave and they were   
 very interested in the well being of  
 the villagers.  The castle is now     
 owned by Mr. Frehling                 
    Mr. Frehling comes from Holland, he
 has lived here for three and a half   
 years.  He employs 14 full time       
 workers and 30 to 35 part time        
 workers.  His 4 chefs come from       
 Holland.                              
    The Domesday Book says "..a castle 
 at South Cave..".  There have been    
 many alterations to the castle and Mr.
 Frehling hopes to make more changes in
 the future.  He wishes to move the    
 ballroom back upstairs and he is      
 building new kitchens.                
    The castle has 20 bedrooms and can 
 sleep 30 people.                      </content>
