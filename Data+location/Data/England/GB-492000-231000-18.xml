		<content>{Attitudes to Entertainment            
{Old people}in the town think that     
 there is enough entertainment in      
 Woburn for them but there should be   
 more for younger people. In their     
 spare time old people like walking and
 gardening. In the age group{17-30     
 people seem to make more use of the   
 available facilities. In their spare  
 time they swim, play golf, walk and   
 socialise in the local pubs.          
 These people and a few old people also
 think that a{sports hall}is greatly   
 needed. The middle aged people        
 don't seem to use the facilities      
 available much. In their spare time   
 they like to walk, swim, shop and ride
 horses. These people also think that  
 there are too many pubs. Many of the  
 young people think that there are too 
 many old people and that the place    
 needs livening up.                    </content>
