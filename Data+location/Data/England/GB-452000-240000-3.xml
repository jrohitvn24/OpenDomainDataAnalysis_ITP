		<content> There were seventy seven different    
 types of housing surveyed.            
 Forty one of these were privately     
 owned, twenty three rented and        
 thirteen tied.                        
 The average number of occupants in    
 each household was two point five     
 persons. There were thirty two        
 children at school or college. The    
 approximate length of time the longest
 resident had lived in the village was 
 seventy nine years. There were twenty 
 people who have lived in the village  
 50 years or longer.                   
 Ninety three people have employment   
 approx. 14 per cent of these being    
 self employed, with some part time    
 workers.                              
 Weekly shopping is bought mainly in   
 Banbury. Mobile traders include a     
 grocer and butcher. The village shop  
 and post office has recently closed.  </content>
