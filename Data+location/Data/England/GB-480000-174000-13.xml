		<title>13Transport in Waltham  St L.</title>
		<content>    The villages of{Waltham St Lawrence
 and{Shurlock Row}are served by only   
 one bus route which goes into{        
{Maidenhead}.  The service is only four
 times each day.  There is no other    
 access to public transport in the     
 area.                                 
                                       
   It is possible with a car to reach  
 major ways of travel very easily.  The
 main{Railway}from {London}to the{West}
 passes through the area and there is a
{station}at Twyford, 4 miles away.  The
{M4 Motorway}goes just to the south of 
 the area and can be reached easily in 
 10 minutes.  The{passenger aircraft}  
 which fly over the area are easily    
 reached at{Heathrow Airport}which is  
 only about 12 miles away.             
                                       
   If you haven't got a car then       
 getting around the area is difficult. </content>
