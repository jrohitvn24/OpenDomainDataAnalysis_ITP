		<title>11Evolution of Westward Ho!</title>
		<content> Before the railway came to Bideford,  
 W.Ho! was an area of small pastoral   
 farms with little building. With      
 improved access by rail it became a   
 watering place and domicile for       
 wealthy people who built large houses 
 and larger farms.                     
 By the late 1800's in the hope of     
 developing a seaside resort, a pier   
 was built in 1874. Severe winter      
 storms demolished supports and the    
 pier was removed in 1880. 1902 a      
 railway built from Bideford to W.Ho!  
 encouraged day-trippers. Lines removed
 for use in the 1914 world war.        
 In the 30's transport improved W.Ho!s 
 development as a seaside resort.In    
 1932 groins and the sea wall were     
 built as a defence against the sea.   
 With increasing population, houses and
 shops were built including recreation 
 facilities upto todays holiday complex</content>
