		<content> WHERE THE MORDA RIVER RUNS THROUGH THE
 VALLEY IT IS KNOWN AS THE CANDY BROOK.
 EIGHTEEN HOUSES, SCATTERED ON BOTH    
 SIDES OF THE BROOK MAKE UP THE HAMLET 
 OF CANDY.                             
                                       
 UP TO 1975 THE POPULATION HAD BEEN    
 STEADILY FALLING YEAR BY YEAR BUT IN  
 THE LAST TEN YEARS IT HAS GRADUALLY   
 INCREASED. IN 1985 THERE ARE 32 ADULTS
 AND 7 CHILDREN. THREE OF THE CHILDREN 
 WERE BORN IN THE LAST THREE YEARS.    
                                       
 ONCE THE HOUSES BELONGED TO THE       
 WYNSTAY ESTATE BUT NOW THEY ARE ALL   
 OWNER OCCUPIED.                       
                                       
 FORMERLY THE MAIN OCCUPATIONS FOR THE 
 MEN OF THE VALLEY WERE ON FARMS OR ON 
 THE NEARBY LIVERPOOL WATERWORKS. THE  
 WOMEN STAYED AT HOME.
