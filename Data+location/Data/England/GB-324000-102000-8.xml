		<content> The results of our questionnaire      
 proved to us that the majority of     
 people living in our D_block were     
 retired. The number of retired people 
 came to 110 out of 320.               
 Compared to this,there were very few  
 unemployed,only 6.                    
 Also there were not as many working   
 on the land,as I expected,just 35.    
 Of cottage industries such as knitting
 and candle_making,there were 4.       
 There were many housewives,49 in all. 
 Among workers,omitting farmers,there  
 were most people in the skilled       
 category,but only 9 unskilled and 8   
 proffessional.                        
 Only one person was actively involved 
 in the Forces.
