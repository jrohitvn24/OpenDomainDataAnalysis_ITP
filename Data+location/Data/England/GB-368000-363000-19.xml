		<title>19SCHOOL BY MARIE LAWRENCE (8)</title>
		<content>   I like being at school because we do
 interesting things and in the morning 
 we have assembly and we sing songs.   
 When we come back from assembly we do 
 some reading then we talk about things
 with Mrs MacMillan.In school we have a
 pet hamster called Sammy and at       
 weekends some people take him home.   
 When we are at school we do lots of   
 things like rounders netball football 
 and P.E. recorders and lots more. On  
 Fridays Mr Thomas comes and reads us a
 story and we do a bit of writing and a
 picture about it. Sometimes we go for 
 walks and trips with school. One day  
 we went for a walk up to the trees and
 did some bark rubbing. On Tuesdays we 
 do Sound Sense and we do some sums in 
 the morning. In the afternoon we have 
 playtime. And today I am doing some   
 hand writing.
