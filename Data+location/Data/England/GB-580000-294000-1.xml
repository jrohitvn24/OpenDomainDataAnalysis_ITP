		<content> This block is a very flat area        
 comprising mainly arable land and     
 Forestry Commission softwood          
 plantations. About one third of this  
 area is owned by the Ministry of      
 Defence as part of a military training
 area. The village of Ickburgh has     
 approximately sixty-three houses (more
 are being erected). The main sources  
 of employment are Manor Farm at       
 Ickburgh and the sand/gravel quarry at
 Lynford. There is also a small factory
 producing wooden pallets at the Old   
 Rectory, Ickburgh. Lynford Hall is a  
 Country Club abd Motel, and has, in   
 its grounds, a small 'Luxury Mobile   
 Homes' static park.
