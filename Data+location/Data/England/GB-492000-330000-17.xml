		<content> The photographs show that this area is
 one of well managed farmland,most of  
 it being used for crops although some 
 is pasture.Farmers have ,in most      
 cases, practiced conservation         
 well,leaving hedgerows and woodland.  
 There is an abundance of wildlife,    
 including pheasants, rabbits, hares   
 and many species of birds.            
   There was no evidence of leaking of 
 dangerous chemicals into the river    
 Witham .Aerial spraying was not in    
 evidence during our visits.The tractor
 marks in the fields were noticeable   
 from the spraying of a fungicide this 
 year because of the wet spring.Local  
 residence agree that the situation has
 improved since the new straw burning  
 laws have been introduced.            
  The Witham valley is picturesque and 
 the landscape is only marred by a     
 series of pylons along the valley.    </content>
