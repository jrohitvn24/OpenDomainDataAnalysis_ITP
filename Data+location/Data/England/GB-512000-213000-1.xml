		<content> Harpenden is a small town in          
 Hertfordshire in the valley of the    
 River Lea.   It is midway between     
 St.Albans and Luton.   It has a       
 population of approximately 30,000    
 people all of whom live in housing    
 which is grouped around the central   
 High Street and the parish church.    
                                       
 There is very little industry in      
 Harpenden it is mainly a residential  
 area with people commuting to larger  
 towns to work.   However, Rothamsted  
 Experimental Station does employ 700  
 people who research into crop growth. 
 Many Harpenden buildings are quite old
 and the village area is under a       
 preservation order. Harpenden has over
 two hundred shops, a sports centre, an
 outdoor swimming pool and many        
 amenities but it retains its green    
 rural atmosphere.                     </content>
