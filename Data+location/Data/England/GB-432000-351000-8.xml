		<content> As she did her house work and looked  
 after her sick father-in-law she'd    
 hope and pray for her husbands safety.
 Today was special,she had received a  
 letter from him containing some wild  
 pansies gathered from a French        
 hedgerow.He said that the shell and   
 gunfire and sights of death and blood 
 shed were too horrible to write about.
 He was very tired with the strain of  
 being in the front-line.Her husband   
 took part in front-line night patrols 
 and recorded in his diary how his     
 platoon was caught in Verey lights    
 flares,but escaped machine gun fire   
 by lying flat on the ground.Later she 
 was to learn that he had been wounded 
 and captured.He luckily escaped death 
 when the bible in his breast pocket   
 stopped a piece of shrapnel           
 penetrating his chest.He spent the    
 rest of the war in a prison camp.     </content>
