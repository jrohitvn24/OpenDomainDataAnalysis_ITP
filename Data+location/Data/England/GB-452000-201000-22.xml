<title>22Technology in our home, 2011</title>
<content>

We were asked to think about things which use computers and technology in our homes. We chose a radio as the best because it can be very small but very important.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are computers in almost everything. The clock that wakes us up, our i-pad4 because you can play games on there. Our favourite game on the i-pad is hard to choose because you just log on and put your finger over the one you want to play. It can be noisy. Sometimes the phone shakes and we don't know what we're pressing!&lt;br />&lt;br /&gt;The Blackberry is a type of phone and often has a camera as well. We love that. One of our mums had a blacfk blackberry but she sold it. People sell their phones and get new ones quite a lot because they think they will be better and do different things.&lt;br />&lt;br />Other things we thought of were TVs, DS and laptops. We use MP3 players, Ipods and i-phones for games and talking to people. Touch-screen TVs, cameras, keyboards and video-cameras all use computers and technology.&lt;br />&lt;br />3rd Cowley Brownies (URC), Oxford. July 2011.   </content>
