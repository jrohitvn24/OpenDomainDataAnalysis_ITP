		<content>   Since the 1950's more houses have   
 been built, especially in Barnston    
 which has tripled in size, and many   
 properties have added garages.        
                                       
   The older houses were constructed   
 mainly of lathe and plaster and       
 Essex weatherboarding, and although   
 some roofs are thatched, a few are    
 covered in slate.                     
                                       
   More modern houses are built of     
 brick in a variety of styles with     
 tiled roofs.
