		<title>12News of the Week</title>
		<content>We have talked to Claire Chamberlin the
journalist who writes about Oundle for 
the Peterborough Standard.  The main   
news was that there had been a fire at 
the Turkey Farm at Barnwell and 2,OOO  
turkeys had to be moved.  They were    
worth a lot of money and people risked 
their lives to save them.   We also    
talked about the County Council        
Elections, the Conservative Party got  
the most votes.  The same week Oundle  
Middle School won a prize for the best 
Maths Game.   We found that the        
Standard gets their news from people   
like the Fire Station, Police, Hospital
etc. They do this by phoning them up   
and asking them if there is any news.  
Sometimes people ring up and tell them 
news, such as Oundle School, the Courts
and the Police.
