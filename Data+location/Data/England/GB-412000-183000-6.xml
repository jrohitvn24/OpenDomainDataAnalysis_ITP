		<content> In May the Tory party suffered a major
 defeat in the local elections.The     
 Liberal-SDP Alliance had broken their 
 hold on the Wiltshire County Council  
 for the first time. It is seen as a   
 comment on the Tory Government's      
 mid-term unpopularity, over           
 interference with local government and
 unemployment policies.                
{                                      
 Schools in the town have been         
 disrupted again this year as teachers 
 hold strikes and withdraw goodwill    
 because of their falling salaries.    
{                                      
 Work will start on two new murals this
 summer,sponsored by Arkell's brewery. 
 These will enhance th other murals    
 found throughout the town depicting   
 much of the town's history and its    
 famous people.
