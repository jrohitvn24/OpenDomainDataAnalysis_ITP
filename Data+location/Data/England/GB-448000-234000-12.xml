		<title>12The King's Sutton Railway</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
    The railway is on the outskirts of 
 King's Sutton; it has a small shelter 
 on the platform but no ticket office  
 or cafe.   The shelter looks more like
 a bus stop because it is so small.  It
 is very unusual nowadays to have a    
 station in such a small village.      
    You cannot buy a ticket at the     
 station as there is no-one to buy it  
 from; you pay for the journey on the  
 train.                                
    A lot of people in King's Sutton   
 use the train, especially to          
 Banbury, the nearest market town,     
 because it is cheaper and more        
 convenient.   They are used to the    
 trains and think they sound friendly.
