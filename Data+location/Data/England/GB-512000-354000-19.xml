		<title>19CROP SPRAYING</title>
		<content> ALTHOUGH AWARE OF SOME PUBLIC CONCERN 
 FARMERS FEEL THEY NEED SPRAYS TO      
 INCREASE THE YIELD AND MAINTAIN THE   
 QUALITY OF CROPS. BLACK GRASS, WILD   
 OATS AND BROAD LEAVED WEEDS ARE ALL   
 KILLED WITH HERBICIDES. SOME OF THE   
 MAIN CHEMICALS USED ARE CHLORTOURON   
 AND SOPROTURON. THERE ARE SPRAYED ON  
 MOST CROPS TO KILL BLACK GRASS.       
 FERTILISER IS APPLIED TO CROPS TO     
 INCREASE THE YIELD. FERTILISER CAN BE 
 SPRAYED ON CROPS OR PUT ON BY         
 SPREADING MACHINE. SOME FERTILISER    
 CHEMICALS ARE PHOSPHATE AND POTASH.THE
 MAIN PESTS THAT HARM CROPS ARE FLIES, 
 APHIDS AND SLUGS. THESE ARE ALL KILLED
 WITH PESTICIDES. WHEN GRAIN IS STORED 
 CHEMICALS ARE STILL USED IF THE GRAIN 
 HAS PESTS IN IT. SOME STORED GRAIN    
 PESTS ARE THE SAW-TOOTHED GRAIN       
 BEETLE, THE GRAIN WEEVIL AND THE GRAIN
 MITE.                                 </content>
