		<content> The original stone building was built 
 for Ysuelt Mortimer the daughter of a 
 powerful baron who owned most of the  
 land in the area.She married an Audley
 and it was their descendants who built
 a house of brick on the same site.This
 house is said to be one of the first  
 houses of brick in England and dates  
 from the 15th century.One of the      
 owners was a friend of The Black      
 Prince.The stone carving over the main
 fireplace depicts the crest of The    
 Prince Of Wales which has inscibed    
 below it "ICH DIENE".The two chairs   
 either side of the fireplace were made
 for the visit of Mary Tudor.A bedroom 
 upstairs is decorated in her honour   
 this is where the family priest was   
 killed during the civil war and is    
 haunted.The house contains many famous
 pictures including a portrait of      
 Raphael valued at Â£750,000.           </content>
