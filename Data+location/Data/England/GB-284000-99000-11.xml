		<title>11Shobrooke Park Trees.</title>
		<content> Alleys of trees in Shobrooke Park     
 Eaten leaves and worn away bark       
 Some growing nut and some just plain  
 seeds                                 
 Hundreds of colours and lots of       
 breeds.                               
 When we went to Shobrooke Park there  
 were 5 different kinds of tree that we
 identified which were Lime, Oak,      
 Horse-Chestnut, Ash and Copper Beech. 
 When we first came in to Shobrooke    
 Park there were a few Oak, a few Ash, 
 a few Horse Chestnut and a few Lime.  
 Then we went through a kissing gate   
 and there was an avenue of lime trees,
 and at the end of the avenue there was
 a Copper Beech.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
