		<content> We were told the Village Hall was     
 built in 1962, and everyone uses it;  
 playgroup, luncheon club, guides,     
 brownies, badminton. They use it for  
 weddings and parties and bonfire      
 night. I went to the village hall.    
 There were 2 toilets, a kitchen, a big
 hall with a stage. The Jubilee room   
 was built in 1977.                    
 At the playing fields I went on an    
 American swing with 6 seats. There    
 were 19 steps on the slide. There were
 10 swings and a rocking horse with 5  
 seats. There was a see-saw. The       
 football club play on Sunday mornings.
 The cricket club play on Saturdays and
 Sundays from May to September. In the 
 holidays, I went to the cricket pitch.
 I got all grassy because my dad tipped
 all the mowings in a pile and I jumped
 in it.
