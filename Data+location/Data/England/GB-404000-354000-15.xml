     The Butterton Gala takes place    
every year on August Bank Holiday      
Monday and is held in and around the   
Black Lion pub and the village hall.   
It has been going to about 100 years   
and is organized by members of the     
Mellor Foundation.                     
                                       
     Local women run the stalls which  
sell things like clothes and cakes.    
There is also a Tombola and a          
White Elephant Stall and there are     
competitions like Guess the name of    
a doll, How many peas in a jar and a   
draw prize.                            
                                       
     The money raised goes to the      
upkeep of the village hall.            
                                       
     Last year about 300 people        
attended the Gala.                     </content>
