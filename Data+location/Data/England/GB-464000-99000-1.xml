		<title>01Introduction to Portsmouth</title>
		<content>   From the few small villages on      
 Portsea Island in 1087, Portsmouth has
 developed into a thriving city with   
 one of the highest{population}        
{densities}in England. The natural     
 harbour, where King John established  
 his dockyard, became a major{Naval}   
{Base}of national importance during the
 campaigns of the Middle Ages and two  
 World Wars.                           
   From 1800, Portsmouth expanded from 
 the small fortified town in the SW to 
 engulf the whole island. It became a  
 city in 1926, with a population of    
 nearly{250,000.}Since 1945, the city  
 has expanded into dormitory estates   
 along the coastal and London roads,   
 but the island population has dropped 
 to{180,000.}With the decline in the   
 Navy, local industries, ferry port and
 tourism are increasingly important.
