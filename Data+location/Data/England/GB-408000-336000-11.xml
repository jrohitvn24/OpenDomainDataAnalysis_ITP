		<title>11FARM MANAGER AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> At 6-30am. Dave Randall, farm manager 
 at Abbotsholme school, starts his     
 day.He lives in Marston Montgomery, a 
 small village 2 miles from            
 Abbotsholme. He travels to work by    
 car.First he checks the stock,and then
 has breakfast at 7-30am. in school,   
 before he feeds the cattle.He has his 
 lunch between 12 and 1-00pm.and then  
 starts the busier part of his day.    
 This involves more physically         
 demanding work until 5-00pm. when he  
 goes home to his wife. He has a pet   
 dog. Dave enjoys farming very much and
 his favourite animals to work with are
 the cows and his favourite job is     
 hay-making. He has been farming for 22
 years even though farming is not his  
 familys tradition. He would like his  
 own farm but is very happy at         
 Abbotsholme.
