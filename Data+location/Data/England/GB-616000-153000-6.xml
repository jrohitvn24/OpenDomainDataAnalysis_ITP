		<title>06CHURCH &amp; SCHOOL FETE BRIDGE</title>
		<content> On Saturday June 15th 1985 a fete was 
 held at Bridge School.It was organized
 by the Parent-Teachers Association and
 Bridge Church. I was looking forward  
 to the Fete as I was going in the     
 fancy dress as a Swiss girl,so was    
 Lucy my best pal.The people in fancy  
 dress had to parade through the High  
 Street of Bridge.It was a lovely warm 
 summers day.We had to be at the Red   
 Lion Public House by 1.30pm. The Fete 
 started at 2.00.There were swing boats
 and pony rides and lots of stalls.    
 Some people gave a gymnastic display. 
 I enjoyed it very much.               
 On June 10th and 11th the children in 
 J2 (my class) brought their bicycles  
 to school to try and learn how to ride
 safely on the roads.On June 13th we   
 had a test of riding and the Highway  
 Code.We all passed the test.Now we can
 ride our bikes to school if we like.  </content>
