		<title>18BUILDINGS CHANGE,COLD ASHTON</title>
		<content>    Just as places names gives clues to
 ownership or surroundings, so the     
 names of houses can give a picture of 
 the changes in village life over      
 the centuries. The{Old Rectories}at   
 Doynton and Cold Ashton are now houses
 because the incumbent no longer lives 
 in the villages with the trend to     
 amalgamate livings.                   
    Rectory Farm, Doynton is also a    
 private house with the land sold off  
 and worked by a neighbouring farm. The
{Old Brewery}is no longer economic and 
 is now private housing.Monkswood House
 is now owned by the{water board}and is
 no longer a farm, to avoid poluting   
 the reservoir.A{papermill}near there  
 is being converted to a cottage. The  
 old{school}and the old{pub}in Cold    
 Ashton have both been converted to    
 private houses,The latter being the   
 only thatched building in the area.   </content>
