		<title>02A HOTEL OWNER'S DAY</title>
		<content>{A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A HOTEL OWNER    
  My Dad owns a hotel on the promenade.
 Every day he has to get up at seven   
 a.m. to be at the hotel by seven      
 thirty.By this time the kitchen and   
 dining-room staff have arrived,       
 and the chambermaids begin to serve   
 morning tea. My Dad and Jill,the      
 manageress, sort out bills and wages. 
  During the morning they go to the    
 bank,and on Wednesdays my Dad and some
 chefs go to the stores to buy a week's
 supply of food which fills a trailer  
 and the boot of a car.                
  During the rest of the day he helps  
 in the kitchen and behind the bar.In  
 the evening there is entertainment.If 
 the hotel is not so busy,my Dad will  
 call the Bingo,but the entertainers   
 generally do this.                    
  My Dad's day at the hotel is         
 finished.                             </content>
