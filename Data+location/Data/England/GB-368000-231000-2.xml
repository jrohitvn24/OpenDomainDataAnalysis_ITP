		<title>02The Concert</title>
		<content> As part of the Dymock 900 Festival all
 the family went to see the Leclair    
 String Quartet in Dymock Church on    
 September 13th 1985. There were two   
 ladies and two men. One lady played   
 the violin and the othet the cello.   
 One man played the viola and the other
 had another violin. The concert       
 started at 7.30 p.m. Soon we had an   
 interval and we had a drink and a     
 biscuit but I didn't like the biscuit 
 so I gave it to Amy. Soon I needed the
 toilet and Dad had to take me to the  
 pub and let me go there. When we got  
 back it had started.                  
 After about half an hour we had to go 
 home but I had enjoyed myself very    
 much. (Faye Hinton, aged 8)
