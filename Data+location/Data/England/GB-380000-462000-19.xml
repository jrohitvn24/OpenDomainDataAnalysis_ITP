		<content> Most people who live in this area do  
 not actually work on a farm. There is 
 a small industrial estate which has   
{Paper Mill, Creamery, Coal Yard,      
{Builders Merchants, Joiners, Garage   
 and{Vehicle Repairers},and on the old 
 station yard there is a{Farm Suppliers
 and a{Timber Merchant}although not all
 of this site is occupied yet.         
   The town has many more{shops}than   
 could be needed by local people or    
 even by the people who come for the   
 Tuesday Market. Most of these shops   
 rely on the{Summer vistors}who are    
 either stopping on their way to the   
 Lake District or on holiday in this   
 area.                                 
   Another important employer is the   
{Quarry}at Giggleswick. All of these   
 industries lead to very heavy use of  
 the roads but a{bypass}is planned.
