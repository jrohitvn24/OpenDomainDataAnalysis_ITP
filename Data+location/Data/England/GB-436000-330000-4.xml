		<title>04Small shops in SE Derby</title>
		<content> True corner shops are becoming rarer  
 in this part of Derby as they are     
 forced to close by economic pressures.
 Better corner shops have attracted    
 other shops to form small centres.    
 These smaller centres are still       
 dominated by the food and convenience 
 shops, although Post Offices are a    
 common addition. Each old village and 
 new housing development has its parade
 of shops. The old swallowed-up        
 villages such as Chellaston and       
 Boulton used converted houses whilst  
 new developments have custom-made     
 premises, usually comprising a row of 
 six shops, a supermarket and a public 
 house. It is noticeable at present    
 that the shops on the new estates are 
 slow to be taken up, reflecting the   
 lag between housing development and   
 service provision.
