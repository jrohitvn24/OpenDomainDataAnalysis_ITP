{Blandford Road}is the large main      
 road and contains a{small shopping    
{centre. }We found two blocks of shops,
 containing a Co-op, a Spar food shop  
 and a post office and other small     
 shops. There were more small shops    
 along other minor roads.  There were  
 petrol filling stations, a bank and a 
 library along Blandford Road.         
 There are several{schools,}such as    
 Hamworthy First, Hamworthy Middle and 
 Herbert Carter which is a secondary   
 school. Children from this area also  
 go to the grammar schools in Poole.   
 This is a mostly{residential          
 area with narrow roads.  The houses   
 are quite old and the gardens are     
 small.  There are some rest homes for 
 the elderly. There is some light      
{industry,}such as boatyards and       
 small factories.                      </content>
