 He can wear black, blue or grey       
 shirts; but, not red nor purple. Red  
 represents the Queen's Chaplin, and   
 purple represents a bishop.           
                                       
 He gets paid a stipend, which is like 
 a salary. It is less money in many    
 other jobs, but, his expenses are paid
 by the church: for example, his bills 
 and car petrol, at the end of the     
 month.                                
                                       
 When he visits people, the duties are 
 called pastoral duties. Mr.Springate  
 prays several times throughout the day
 asking for things and thanking God.
