     LAWRENCE ST.AREA.YORK CITY SUBURB.
 This area is largely a Victorian      
 working class subUrb of York that grew
 around the main road from York to     
 Hull(Lawrence St.).This remains a very
 busy arterial road.To the South the   
 ground rises on to the York           
 Morraine,while on the Northern side is
 a large area of waste ground,once a   
 Council tip but now abandoned and     
 colonised by natural vegetation.On the
 ridge St.Lawrence's Church stands,the 
 spire of which can be seen from       
 all parts of the area.Many of the     
 terrace houses in the Lawrence St.area
  have been demolished and an area of  
 light industry has been developed.at  
 the Western edge the Medieval City    
 walls still stand pierced by a        
 barbicaned gateway.On the N.E.edge    
 lies a now unused railway yard.       </content>
