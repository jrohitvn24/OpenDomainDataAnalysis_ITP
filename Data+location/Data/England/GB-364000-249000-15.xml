		<content> About half the homes in this section  
 are farms or have farming connections 
 and therefore life centres around this
 industry. Farmers'wives are well known
 for their skills in poultry dressing, 
 cake and jam making, and flower       
 arranging and wine making. Many of the
 women still help with the outside     
 work and have more time for this as   
 possession of electrical appliances   
 makes housework easier and less time  
 consuming. The other half of the      
 community also takes an interest in   
 outdoor pursuits and most gardens are 
 well stocked with flowers and         
 vegetables - some of the produce      
 being sold at the WI market in        
 Bromyard.  Most of the community enjoy
 watching television, younger ones also
 enjoy videos, pop music, and discos,  
 when their homework is finished.
