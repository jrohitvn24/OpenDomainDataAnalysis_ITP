		<title>16A DAY IN THE LIFE</title>
		<content>      My name is MEGAN CRASKE and I    
 wake up at 7.30 in the morning. I get 
 down from my bed with a ladder because
 my bed is high up on the wall. I go   
 into the bathroom and then get dressed
 out of my nightshirt into my school   
 clothes. I go down stairs to breakfast
 of a coffee and some cereals. Next I  
 brush my teeth . I pack my lunch of   
 sandwiches,drink, fruit, a piece of   
 cake and a chocolate biscuit. I go to 
 school on my bicycle which is red and 
 silver with a basket. I go to my      
 classroom and Mrs Haresign, our       
 headteacher, calls our names out for  
 the register and then we start work.At
 10.30hrs we have a quarter of an hour 
 play time.We usually read, either     
 aloud or quietly to ourselves and     
 exercises in Maths and English.At     
 12.00hrs we have our packed lunch and 
 then go out to play until 13.15hrs.   </content>
