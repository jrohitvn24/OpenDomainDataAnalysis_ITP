		<title>03THE MARKET OF A-IN-M.</title>
		<content> The market is situated in the centre  
 of Ashton.  It is surrounded by shops.
  In the market they sell anything from
 small novelty items up to size 22     
 dresses.  On Tuesdays and Saturdays   
 when the market is on you will see    
 gossipping old women propping up the  
 nearest wall, and young girls and boys
 talking about the latest disco.  Some 
 of the stalls sell clothes, jewellery,
 make-up, food and material.  You will 
 see mothers trying to drag their young
 children away from the stalls.  Just  
 around the corner from the markets    
 there are some cafes where busy       
 shoppers go for a drink.  The stalls  
 are made of canvas held up with long  
 metal poles and some are wooden huts  
 plus a few caravans.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
