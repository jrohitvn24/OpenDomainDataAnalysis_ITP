		<title>10HOUSING IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Villages in N.Yorkshire are regarded  
 as extremely desirable areas in which 
 to live, consequently houses fetch a  
 high price when they are sold-a 5     
 year-old 4 bedroomed detached house   
 with an average sized garden would    
 fetch about Â£75 000.                  
 In the village itself there are 63    
 owner-occupied houses, 1 rented house 
 and 7 holiday cottages.               
 In the area studied there are 18 farms
 but only 2 of these have the          
 farmhouses in the village itself.     
 There is 1 mansion which is open to   
 the public.                           
 The 63 houses are : 40 detached,20    
 semi-detached and 3 terrace.          
 There is also 1 mansion(Sutton Hall),1
 pub,1 garage and 1 Post Office &amp; shop.
 Some properties have workshops on     
 their land as businesses are worked   
 from home.                            </content>
