		<content> Great Witley does not seem to be      
 affected by the national unemployment 
 situation. From the results of a local
 questionaire all men of working age   
 who completed the form are in work    
 and so are some wives. Approximately  
 50% of those questioned work locally. 
 About 30% travel a distance of ten    
 miles and 20% travel farther than 20  
 miles commuting to the industrial     
 Midlands. The predominating jobs      
 seem to be farming and teaching.      
 There are quite a number of retired   
 people living in the residential area 
 of the village in The Glebe where old 
 persons' bungalows have been provided 
 by the council. The majority of       
 inhabitants have lived in the village 
 for twenty years or less, but there   
 are some elderly residents who can    
 remember the time when most people in 
 the village worked at Witley Court.   </content>
