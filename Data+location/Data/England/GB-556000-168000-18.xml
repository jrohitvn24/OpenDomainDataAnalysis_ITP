		<title>18THE DARENTH TAVERN</title>
		<content>    The{Darenth Tavern}(formerly the   
 White Hart) is based around a public  
 house but its facilities have been    
 extended to include meals, music,     
 dancing, pool and other attractions.  
 It is licenced for 300 people and     
 employs 24 staff on a rota basis. It  
 was built in 1926 over existing       
 cellars.                              
   Two major forms of fermented prod-  
 ucts are kept in a chilled cellar     
 (55C). 'Traditional' beer still       
 contains yeast and has to be allowed  
 to settle out. 'Keg' beers, lagers and
 ciders have been pasteurised and      
 produce no sediment. The Kilderkins   
 (18 gals.) of traditional ale are     
 placed on end and the beer drawn up to
 the bar through a spear which can be  
 placed at different levels. Keg       
 products are driven up by gas.        
 Opening times: 10a.m.-3p.m. 6p.m.-mid.</content>
