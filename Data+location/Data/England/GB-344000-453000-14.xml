		<content> In a predominantly country area such  
 as ur block, the main source of       
employment is farming - mainly farm    
labourers who live in "tied" cottages  
provided by the farmer.                
The other source of employment is at   
the yacht marina, where boats of all   
kinds and sizes are maintained and     
repaired by skilled engineers and      
craftsmen. Boats come from all over the
country for repair, and some of them   
are worth in excess of 100,000 pounds. 
They come for both mechanical and      
structural repair.                     
Other employment is provided by the    
school (teachers,cook, caretaker etc.) 
and the two garages in the block (motor
mechanics).                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
