		<title>02Hadley Town Centre</title>
		<content> Hadley town centre has changed since  
 the Hadley By-Pass was built in 1979. 
 The centre is now pedestrianised.     
 The original High Street now stops at 
 the new shopping precinct.            
 The railway line leads to Donnington  
 to the west and Shrewsbury to the     
 east.The trains that go on the line   
 now carry things for the{Army}Depot.  
 Every Wednesday there is an open air  
{market}in the centre of Hadley.       
 In the centre of Hadley there is a    
 mixture of old and new shops.         
 At the side of the new shopping area  
 there is a{Methodist Church}which is  
 approximately 100 years old.          
 At the western end of the High Street 
 are some recently built old people's  
 dwellings.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
