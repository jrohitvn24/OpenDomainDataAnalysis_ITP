		<title>07Honey Farming On Tweedside</title>
		<content>  About a mile down the River Tweed    
 from Horncliffe near the Chain Bridge,
 is a honey farm of 1000 hives of bees 
 run by the Robson family.             
   These bees are kept within a radius 
 of 30 miles and produce on average    
 about 25 tons of honey each year.     
  The hives are moved thrice a year    
 from sheltered sites in the winter, to
 the oil seed rape fields in the Spring
 and then to the the Lammermuir Hills  
 or to Chatton Moors for the heather   
 honey in August.                      
   The honey is extracted and processed
 by the Robsons at their works at their
 home. The products being packed for   
 sale into various types of container  
 ranging from plastic pots to specially
 produced decorated pots.              
  These products are marketed by the   
 family and by retail outlets in       
 England and Scotland.                 </content>
