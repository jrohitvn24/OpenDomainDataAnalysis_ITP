amalgamated and nationalised to form   
the British Road Services Depot,London 
Rd.They have 22 lorries of 38 ton units
each carrying 23-24 tons.The trailer   
alone is 40 feet long.This kind of     
lorry has 5 axles,2 on the unit and 3  
on the trailer.A unit may do about     
100,000 miles in 6 months.Drivers can  
work 8 hour shifts and are often away  
all over the country for up to 5 nights

 In the depot they have 32,000 cubic   
feet of warehouse space containing     
pallets,each holding about 2,880 tins. 
To check the food quality samples are  
taken from 12 tins on a pallet but all 
are disposed of after 2 years. An      
average load carried is 20 pallets     
or 57,600 tins.The tins hold anything
