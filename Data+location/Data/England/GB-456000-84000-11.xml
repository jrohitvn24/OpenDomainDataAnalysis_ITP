		<content> He had to be in attendance at the     
 airport on the day in case the        
 helicopter crashed.  The planes they  
 use for pleasure flights are called   
 Cessnas.  They are also the most      
 common plane at the airport.  The     
 safety record at the airport is       
 nothing but the best.  They have a    
 fire truck and have 3 firemen, but    
 when there is a fire only 2 of them   
 are needed.  A new control tower is   
 being built in place of the little    
 room they used before.  The radios    
 they use to contact the planes cost   
 Â£1000 each (they have 2).  The        
 airports radio frequency is 123.50.   
 Pilots tune into this when they want  
 to know what kind of weather it is at 
 Sandown and whether they can land     
 there.  They have 2 weather charts    
 aday one for the morning and one for  
 the afternoon.                        </content>
