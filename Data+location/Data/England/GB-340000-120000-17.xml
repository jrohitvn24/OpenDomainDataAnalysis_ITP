		<title>17Gala Day,Kingsbury.</title>
		<content> On the 26th June 1982,there was the   
 first Gala Day of the re-formed       
 Kingsbury Friendly Society.The pro-   
 cession started at the Wyndham Arms,  
 led by a horse called Candy Floss     
 pulling a cart in which were the Gala 
 princess and her attendant.There was a
 new banner,as the old one had been    
 preserved in the church.The main dif- 
 ferences in the schedule from the     
 original Club Day were that the fair  
 and the marquee were in a field by    
 Stembridge school,and there was just  
 one procession for women and men.Gala 
 Day celebrations have been held each  
 year since.The money raised has gone  
 to charity.This year(1985)the money   
 went to Kingsbury and Martock         
 schools'P.T.A.s,South Petherton       
 Hospital,the Cystic Fibrosis Fund,the 
 Bradford Fire Appeal and Fiveways     
 School for the handicapped.           </content>
