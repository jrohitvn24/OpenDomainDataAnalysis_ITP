		<content> Two local headmasters made the news   
 this week(12.7.85)because they both   
 retired after many years service in   
 education.The unusual thing is that   
 both headmasters were in charge of    
 village schools,both retired at the   
 same time and they live opposite each 
 other!                                
      Mr K.Potts is the retiring head  
 of Houghton School and Mr F.Boase is  
 retiring from Rockcliffe School.      
     Headmaster Mr Boase has often had 
 to pick up balls from his garden next 
 door to the school of Mr Potts!       
     The local newspaper,the Cumberland
 News reported that they both shared   
 the same interests too,'liquid        
 refreshments'!
