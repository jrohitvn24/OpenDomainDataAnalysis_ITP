		<content>    In 1972 the Central Electricity    
 Generating Board offered the then     
 Worcestershire Education Authority the
 opportunity of use by schools of the  
 17 hectares ( 41 acres ) of mixed     
 woodland surrounding{Bishops Wood     
{sub_station}near Stourport_on_Severn. 
 They undertook to provide a class room
 building to act as a base for work by 
 schools and the L.E.A.agreed to       
 provide the furnishing and material   
 necessary for field work.It aimed to  
 provide two main features (1) a nature
 trail for school parties in general   
 and (2) the facilities by means of    
 which groups of pupils could carry out
 projects of a more individual nature. 
 It was also hoped to give an          
 appreciation of more general aspects. 
 To encourage the understanding of     
 sub_stations and the care taken in    
 siting and screening them.(M.Dickson) </content>
