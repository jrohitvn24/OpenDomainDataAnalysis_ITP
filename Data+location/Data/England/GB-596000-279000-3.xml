		<title>03HALL FARM, KNETTISHALL</title>
		<content> The Bucher's farm is called Hall Farm.
 There are 500 pedigree friesian cows. 
 The cows are milked twice daily       
 starting at 5.00am and 2.30pm.  There 
 are 32 milking bays in the parlour.   
 Each cow enters a bay where there is a
 supply of grass and corn.  The men    
 attach the machines to the cow's      
 udder.  Then the cows are milked for  
 about 7 minutes.  When this is ended, 
 the machine stops automatically.      
 The Milk Marketing Board collects the 
 milk to be pastuerised. The EEC rules 
 have not affected his production. The 
 farm has 1000 acres which are used to 
 grow sugar beet, barley, wheat and    
 grass. Mr. Bucher rotates his crops   
 all the time as the soil is sandy and 
 they are easily affected by the       
 weather.  There are 12 people on      
 the farm  who farm with machinery.
