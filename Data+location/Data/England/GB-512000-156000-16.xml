 with a mangle to wring out the        
 clothes. One person remembered wearing
 "combs", vest and knickers combined in
 one garment.                          
    One person was brought up in an    
 orphanage. Their toys were hoops,     
 tops, five stones and a real rocking  
 horse. School was strict. Children    
 were not allowed to dislike anything  
 and were punished by being hit. They  
 could leave school at 14 years of age.
    Some of the old Fetcham people     
 remembered the main road as a lane or 
 cart track. There was no street       
 lighting and only two cottages in the 
 Cobham Road. Most people walked, rode 
 bicycles or used horse and cart. One  
 person remembered open top buses,     
 which could not go uphill with        
 passengers! They had to walk up the   
 hill and remount the bus at the top!  </content>
