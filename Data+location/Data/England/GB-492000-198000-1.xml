		<content>   This area of Southern England is    
 situated approximately thirty miles   
 West North West of London forming part
 of the capital's commuter belt. As    
 part of the Chiltern Hills it lies in 
 the Southern half of the county of    
 Buckinghamshire. Within the area      
 surveyed there are the villages of    
 Hyde Heath and Little Missenden,      
 together with the outer suburbs of two
 market towns, Chesham and Amersham.   
 Between these settlements are         
 extensive areas of good quality,      
 extensively cultivated cereal and     
 grass land.                           
   Amid the typical, undulating chalk  
 landscape there are numerous patches  
 of woodland. Some are natural         
 deciduous, including the Beech tree,  
 others are coniferous plantations,    
 often occupying steep valley sides and
 hilltop sites.                        </content>
