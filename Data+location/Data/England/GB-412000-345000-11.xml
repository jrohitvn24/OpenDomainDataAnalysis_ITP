		<title>11A Day in the Life of.....(1)</title>
		<content>CRAIG DEACON aged 9.                   
I usually wake at 6.30a.m. when Mum is 
still asleep.I wake Mum up and tell her
I am going to the River Dove with      
Andrew.I have my breakfast first,a     
drink of milk and some cereal.When we  
reach the little waterfall,(measuring  
1 metre across and 1 metre down),we    
cross the river to Holmes Island next  
to the weir.Our base is a ditch in the 
ground with sticks and leaves covering 
it.At about twelve o'clock I go for    
dinner,sometimes it's chips and fish   
fingers,then I go back to Holmes Island
with Dad and my sister.When Clare has  
fished falling in we all go home for   
tea.My favourite is beef-burgers.I     
think I go to bed about 8 o'clock after
I have watched some television.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
