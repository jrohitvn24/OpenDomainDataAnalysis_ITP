		<title>19WOODBROOK ROAD SHOPS</title>
		<content> On Woodbrook Road there is a row of   
 three terraced shops. They are{Soar   
{Valley Tackle,garden,hardware and pet 
{food supplies,Jillians (hairdressers) 
{and Mahers(Grocers,beers, wines and   
{spirits ).}Mahers has been closed for 
 so long that the onions and potatoes  
 have sprouted and are beginning to    
 grow. The empty shop is next to{Model 
{Farm Service Station}which is also    
 closed and overgrown. It is for sale. 
 Behind the shops is a private car park
 for staff purposes only.{Trade}was bad
 and they had to close. Mahers looks   
 very sad now. This shop which was     
 once such a cheerful place is now     
 deserted. I used to go there every day
 and I really miss that friendly shop. 
 So does my mum. We hardly ever went to
 town for food. Now we have to{trade}at
 a supermarket.
