		<title>15BROADMEADOW SPORTS CENTRE</title>
		<content> Broadmeadow sports centre was opened  
 in 1977. This year, 1985, the centre  
 has undergone some major changes.     
 Squash courts and a body building     
 gymnasium have been added. Also a     
 spacious lounge is planned which will 
 later have a bar.                     
   The centre does lots of sports      
 including hockey, volley-ball, tennis,
 football, badminton and netball. The  
 competitions take place at the sports 
 centre each year. A badminton         
 tournament takes place inside while   
 outside there is a cross-country run. 
 A disabled sports day is planned for  
 June.                                 
   There is a very small path leading  
 from Kingsway to the centre and people
 from the town have trouble getting to 
 Broadmeadow if they have not got a    
 car. Since there is only a small car  
 park, cars often park on the road.    </content>
