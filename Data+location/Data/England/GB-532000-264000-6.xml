		<title>06BOXWORTH - EXPERIMENTAL FARM</title>
		<content> The experimental work is concentrated 
 on arable crops (mainly cereals) and  
 an Autumn-calving Frisian dairy herd. 
 The ley grass fields for the herd are 
 kept close to the farm buildings, the 
 arable fields further out. Winter     
 wheat has been grown continuously for 
 34 years on one part but break-crop   
 rotation is also practsed with oilseed
 rape or beans. The 120 cows are fed   
 with different types of grass and     
 calves are bred from a Frisian bull   
 and an Aberdeen Angus. Artificial     
 insemination is also practiced.       
 The farm and its 30 employees is in   
 Boxworth for purely scientific reasons
 and not as a demonstration farm.      
 Visitors are encouraged and there is  
 an open day every year.
