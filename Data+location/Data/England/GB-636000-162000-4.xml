people--day trippers,foreign visitors  
and  those coming here for several     
days.  Locals  refer  to  all

especially Londoners, could make the   
return journey in a day. They came by  
train, charabanc and steamer.Now, most 
people come by car or coach.People

holidays.70% of visitors are aged 45   
and over, and  many  are  retired or   
unemployed.75% are spending a second
