		<title>02THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Blennerhasset is a small village in  
 Cumbria. It has a population of about 
 150. Most of the houses are set around
 the village green. Many of them are   
 very old, dating back to the 15th.    
 century. Some of them were originally 
 farm buildings which have been        
 converted.                            
  Also facing the green are the shop   
 and the school. The shop was founded  
 in 1867 by William Lawson of Brayton. 
 The school was built about the same   
 time and was originally an elementary 
 school, with three rooms, for infants,
 juniors and seniors. Now there are    
 only 24 children aged from 4 to 11.   
  On the village green there is a war  
 memorial dedicated to the men who     
 died in the two wars.There are also   
 some large trees including a          
 horse-chestnut planted a hundred years
 ago.      .                           </content>
