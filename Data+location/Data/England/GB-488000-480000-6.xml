		<content>     We have one district nurse in     
 Eberston (Mrs B.Scofield) In Snainton 
 there are four doctors and a surgery, 
 there are also four nurses (the       
 doctors practice in other villages    
 also)                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
     Most families in Ebberston village
 have between three and six people in  
 the family, but quite alot of old     
 people live in ones and twos. Nearly  
 everybody has pets.                   
                                       
     Not many people in Snainton have  
 pets but most have a T.V. or Radio.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
