 in the year 1874.It is built with red 
 bricks and the windows are arched.It  
 is quite large.Inside the{Chapel}the  
 seats are all box pews.In the olden   
 days people had to pay every year for 
 a seat for the family.There used to be
 seats in upstairs{Gallery}but these   
 have been taken out.There is an       
{electric organ}in the{Chapel}but not  
 too many years ago it had to be pumped
 by hand.A boy was paid the sum of     
{13 shillings(65p)}a year to do the    
 pumping. At the front of the {Chapel  
  is the{Altar}table and behind this   
 the {Pulpit.}The{Font}is rather       
 small and stands on a table at the    
 side of the {Chapel}when there is a   
 christening it is placed on the {     
{Altar.}The {Chapel}is in the{Goole    
{Circuit}and is looked after by the
