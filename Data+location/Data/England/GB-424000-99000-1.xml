		<content>    The{Forestry Commission}is a       
 national body controlled by the       
 government.The commission was set up  
 in 1919AD.The function of the{Forestry
{Commission}is to co-ordinate the      
 planning and planting of timber-tree  
 plantations in the British Isles so   
 that the country would always have a  
 supply of timber.                     
   The land chosen for these           
 plantations is mainly land of little  
 farming value.The soils are often poor
 and the land often hilly.             
   The plantations contain mostly{     
{Coniferous trees},including Scots     
 Pine,corsican Pine,Norway Spruce.     
   In the time that the commission has 
 been established, it has planted more 
 than 600,000 hectacres of new         
 plantations.This has helped to produce
 about 10 per.cent of the nation's     
 timber requirements.                  </content>
