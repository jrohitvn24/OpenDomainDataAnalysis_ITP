		<title>16Local Newspapers.</title>
		<content> The area is well served with local    
 newspapers, both those that are on    
 sale and those that are given away.   
   In the mid 1970's a new local give  
 away paper was started-The Guardian   
 Series- which now has at least eight  
 different areas covered as part of its
 distribution network.The paper relies 
 on advertising entirely for its       
 funding and consequently there is     
 rather more advertising than "news".It
 tends to reflect its owner's political
 views and as a result is biased in its
 values and attitudes.                 
  Papers which serve the whole area    
 include the following;Surrey Comet,   
 Sutton and Cheam Herald, Wallington   
 and Carshalton Times,and the Surrey   
 Advertiser.All these papers are on    
 sale.The Morden News Group have       
 recently changed to provide a free    
 paper as a result of competion.       </content>
