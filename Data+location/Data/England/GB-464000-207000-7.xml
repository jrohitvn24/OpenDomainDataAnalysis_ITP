		<content> Snell and Howard Quartly  so we all   
 walk down to the pub over the stile   
 then down an old lane past the sewers 
 and over a leaning gate and another.  
 Next we walk up to the river which is 
 down the bottom of the field. It takes
                                       
 20 minutes to get there and another 10
 minutes to tackle up and find a spot. 
 It is only 10:30am.The river is a     
 coarse fishing river. The main fish   
 are                                   
 Pike,Chub,Gudgeon and Roach.Gradually 
 as the day goes on more people arrive 
 at the river.The average size is 1lb. 
 At 5:00pm we go home to mum who has   
 got us some fish and chips which is a 
 treat.After tea we muck about until   
 7:35pm.Then we go in and watch T.V.   
 until about 11:00pm. Then I go to bed.
