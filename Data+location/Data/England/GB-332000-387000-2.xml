		<content> In the South West corner of our survey
 block is the redeveloped{Herculaneum} 
{Dock.}It was filled in to make the    
 main car park for the{International}  
{Garden Festival of 1984.}The gardens  
 have now been re-opened, due to public
 demand, in a smaller form. Some of the
 attractions include many of last      
 year's favourites such as the{Dragon  
{Slide, Yellow Submarine, Tea Boat,    
{Blue Peter and the Chinese Water      
{Garden and Falls. The Festival Hall   
 has re-opened as a{Magic Garden       
 including a{Giant's Garden where      
 everything, like a fallen tree, a     
 spade, a tap etc. is ten times larger 
 than life. The International Garden   
 Festival was one of the largest       
 projects ever undertaken on{Merseyside
 and was visited by millions of people.
