		<title>15LIFE IN FOREST TOWN</title>
		<content>      In Forest Town there are a lot of
 houses. In the Avenues there are very 
 old houses but the young people, when 
 they come to live here, do the houses 
 up. They look very nice now.          
      When young people move here they 
 have children. More children mean more
 schools. I think most people live in  
 style but some cannot afford it.      
      When we do the shopping most     
 people go to Tesco if they need a lot 
 of things. But if you need small      
 things you shop in Forest Town. There 
 are two paper shops, one chemist, one 
 pub and some others. The pub is called
 the Prince Charles.                   
      There are lots of places for     
 enjoyment. You can go to the pub. You 
 can go to the Kingsway Hall for a     
 dance or drink. You can have a meal. I
 think it is very good in Forest Town.
