		<title>06HEM HEATH COLLIERY, BLURTON</title>
		<content>To go down the pit men are provided    
with underwear, trousers, a jacket,    
overalls, a helmet and a cap lamp. They
wear self-rescuers on their belts. The 
men's overalls are washed at work if   
they require this facility.            
You do not have to be a certain height 
to go down the pit, but you have to be 
7 stone because it is such heavy work. 
There is a Hem Heath Social club which 
organises many activities like         
football, bowls, cricket, Christmas    
parties for miner's children and other 
functions. The club is also used by    
people in the local area of Blurton who
are not miners because many of the     
miners live up to 16 miles away. A lot 
of men moved to Hem Heath when the     
Victoria colliery closed at Biddulph.  
A lot of miners had their own          
transport, but the pit puts buses on to
bring men to work.                     </content>
