		<title>19HOME LIFE - SULLINGTON</title>
		<content> Families in Sullington are mainly     
 small with just one or two children.  
 Pets are usually dogs and cats or     
 exotic birds. Breakfast in the average
 home is a hurried meal of cereal or   
 toast and a cup of tea. At lunch time 
 children have a meal at school but dad
 has a packed lunch of sandwiches.  All
 homes have a freezer but only about a 
 quarter have a dishwasher and         
 microwave oven.  Generally food is    
 cooked by solid fuel or electricity.  
 The main evening meal consists of     
 meat with two or three vegetables     
 followed by various puddings or fresh 
 fruit.  Tea is the most popular       
 beveridge drink. When entertaining at 
 home wine is mostly served but "Bring 
 a bottle" parties are more popular    
 especially with teenagers.
