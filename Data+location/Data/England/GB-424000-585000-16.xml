		<title>16The Relief road.</title>
		<content> In 1955 there was adecisoin to build  
 arelief road.The road is being built  
 because there are too many vehicles on
 the main street.They had to knock down
 the tenth row and the inhabitants went
 to live elsewhere.                    
   The relief road starts beside Presto
 and joins the spine road that leads to
 Newcastle.It will cost 2,750,000      
 pounds to build.Wansbeck are not doing
 the job because they only do small    
 jobs.Northumberland county council    
 deal with larger jobs.                
   George's grandma is not keen on     
 having a new road.She says it will be 
 harder for old people to get to the   
 shops.Others say it will be easier.
