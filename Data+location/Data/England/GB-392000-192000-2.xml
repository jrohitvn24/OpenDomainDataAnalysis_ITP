		<title>02CRUDWELL PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>{All Saints Church,Crudwell}was first  
 built by the{monks of Malmesbury Abbey
{about 1100.It has been}added to five  
 times since then.The two oldest things
 left are the 900 year{old stone font  
{and a Norman door.}The church was     
 built from local stone.It has{several 
{attractive stained glass windows      
{including one on the north}wall which 
 is at least 500 years old.The 5 bells 
 in the square tower were rung from    
 1750 to 1850.The repairs which are now
 needed would cost thousands of        
 pounds.In the chancel walls there are 
 two slanting holes called squints.They
 were used by the lepers so that they  
 could watch the service without       
 infecting the congragation.The lych   
 gate entrance was made in the last 40 
 years as a memorial to the men of the 
 village who died during{the 1914-1918 
{war.                                  </content>
