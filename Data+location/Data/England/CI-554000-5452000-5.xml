		<title>05ST OUEN'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> This church is the parish church and  
 was built in the South West corner of 
 the parish. It was constructed in     
 granite but the spire is of different 
 construction.                         
 It is near St Ouen's Manor and has    
 several brasses commemorating the de  
 Carteret family, a family which has   
 been at the Manor for over 800 years. 
                                       
 As well as having some silver plates  
 which date back to the 17th century it
 also has an unusual stone staircase   
 which leads from the centre of the    
 church to the belfry.                 
                                       
 The church was restored in 1870 and   
 since then has changed very little.   
 There is now a sister church, St      
 Georges, which was built in 1880 at   
 the other end of the Parish at        
 Portinfer.                            </content>
