		<title>15EMPLOYMENT IN BLACKBURN</title>
		<content>      We asked the 34 children in our  
 class to write down the jobs of their 
 parents and any older brothers and    
 sisters of working age. We thought it 
 would be interesting to see how many  
 went out to work.                     
      We found that 33 fathers went out
 to work, this was unusual considering 
 that the unemployment rate in         
 Blackburn is around 16%.              
      26 mothers went out to work, the 
 rest were housewives. This number     
 really surprised us, we didn't expect 
 it to be so high.                     
      8 families had brothers or       
 sisters that worked.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
