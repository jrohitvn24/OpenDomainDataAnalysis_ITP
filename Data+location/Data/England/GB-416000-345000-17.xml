		<title>17Ashbourne's Favourite Points</title>
		<content>                                       
 We did a survey on what people like   
 best about Ashbourne.The two          
 favourites were the Shrovetide        
 football game and the swimming baths. 
 Lots of people like the Countryside   
 best aswell. Two people in this school
 like going church best.One person     
 likes Queen Elizabeths Grammar School.
 The park as well seemed quite popular.
 One person liked playing for Aztecs   
 football team. People also like going 
 to the carnival during the summer.    
 The antique shops are popular with    
 tourists but not with residents.      
 Perhaps the best loved feature is not 
 in the town at all but in the nearby  
 countryside. Dovedale provides us with
 beautiful scenery leading northwards  
 into the Derbyshire Dales.
