		<content>    Down here in Porthleven we call    
 tourists emmets or grockles. We have  
 about five tourist shops in our       
 village which sell things like badges,
 sea shells, postcards, toys, old guns 
 and all sorts of things tourists buy. 
    There are lots of Guest Houses, Bed
 and Breakfast places, four or five    
 hotels and a large number of holiday  
 flats and cottages around Porthleven. 
 We have got two pubs and five eating  
 places, not including the fish and    
 chip shops. The trouble is Porthleven 
 hasn't got many good parking areas.   
    Porthleven is a village with a nice
 atmosphere but the weather sometimes  
 spoils it and I'm afraid we haven't   
 got many indoor activities. On the    
 other hand if the weather is nice     
 there are lots of outdoor activities  
 such as swimming, putting, fishing,   
 diving and some nice walks.           </content>
