		<title>01 AREA WEST OF STORTFORD</title>
		<content>                                       
There are striking contrasts in        
landscape in this area of gentle       
relief with prosperous arable &amp; mixed  
farms,   hedgerows,deciduous woodland  
&amp; narrow   country lanes.There are     
scattered farms &amp; one nucleated        
settlement,the hamlet of Bury          
Green,now occupied by commuters.This   
rural area is being encroached on by a 
new residential zone ,Thorley,which    
has become a suburb of Bishop's        
Stortford.About 3,000 houses are       
being built by several well-known      
companies. There is a shopping area    
with a free car park dominated by      
Sainsbury's.A lack of amenities on the 
estate creates difficulties for young  
mothers &amp; school children.Further      
spread of housing seems imminent since 
the proposed expansion of Stansted     
airport 4 miles to the east.           </content>
