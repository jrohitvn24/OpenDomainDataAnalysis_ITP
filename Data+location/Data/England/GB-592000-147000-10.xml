    If you walk down Charing High      
Street you will see a number of shops. 
There are two butchers, a newsagents, a
Post Office and two supermarkets as    
well as a greengrocers, an ironmongers 
and a small electrical shop.           
   Over the years Charing  has lost    
various shops such as the chemist, a   
grocers, a toy shop, a drapers,        
a shoe shop and a shop that sold       
fish, fruit and berries. This is mainiy
because the people that owned them     
couldn't afford to run them any more   
because people bought their food and   
other goods from big supermarkets in   
towns like Canterbury, Maidstone and   
Ashford. Some shops have been replaced 
by offices in recent years, for        
example  two estate agents, a          
solicitor's, an accountant's, two      
banks and two building society offices.</content>
