		<content>{ A VILLAGER'S VIEWPOINT.}             
 " FORTON IS A QUIET AND FRIENDLY      
 VILLAGE, THOUGH THE PEACE IS SOMETIMES
 DISTURBED BY GOODS VEHICLES USING THE 
 VILLAGE AS A SHORTCUT TO THE A518, THE
 STAFFORD ROAD. AT PEAK TIMES THE A519,
 THE ECCLESHALL ROAD, DOES GET BUSY.   
 THE PEOPLE OF FORTON ARE MOSTLY       
 COMMUTERS WHO WORK IN STAFFORD,       
 NEWPORT, OR WOLVERHAMPTON.            
   THE CHURCH IN FORTON IS AN IMPORTANT
 SOURCE OF ENTERTAINMENT AS WELL AS    
 WORSHIP, WITH A THRIVING CHORAL GROUP.
   FOR SHOPPING A TWO MILE JOURNEY TO  
 NEWPORT IS NECESSARY, THOUGH FOR A    
 WIDER CHOICE A VISIT TO BIRMINGHAM OR 
 SHREWSBURY WOULD BE MADE.             
   IT IS THE QUIET COUNTRYSIDE AND THE 
 ATTRACTIVE OUTLOOK THAT MAKES FORTON  
 SO APPEALING."                        
                                       
                                       </content>
