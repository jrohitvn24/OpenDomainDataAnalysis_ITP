		<title>08AYMESTREY SAND &amp; GRAVEL PIT</title>
		<content>  During Pleistocene times the         
 Aymestrey area was affected by the    
{Central Wales ice-sheet,}a part of    
 which, the{Wye Glacier,}spread over   
 the Herefordshire Lowland influencing 
 the drainage, blocking gaps in the    
 hills between Kington and Aymestrey,  
 diverting streams and uniting them to 
 form the present River Lugg.  The gap 
 at Mortimer's Cross was blocked by ice
 which extended north of Aymestrey     
 creating a lake at Wigmore and forming
 a{gravel delta.                       
{ Quarrying}of this sand and gravel on 
 a commercial scale has been carried   
 out at Aymestrey for 33 years, now by 
 Amey Roadstone Corporation.  The      
 workings cover 84 acres and extraction
 is expected to end about 1990. 9 men  
 are employed in the quarry itself,    
 transport being provided mainly by    
 private contractors.                  </content>
