		<title>01A Description of the Area</title>
		<content>   The countryside is mainly green and 
 quite peaceful.The fields look like   
 green sheets.If you look outside in   
 summer, they are as yellow as the     
 sun.They are blowing in the wind, and 
 the golden wheat is glorious.About 80%
 of the crops grown are wheat and      
 barley,but there is grass for silage  
 and hay.                              
   The roads are long and narrow, with 
 wider parts so cars can pass.The      
 rolling hills are not very big,and if 
 you go over one in a car you will     
 hardly notice it.Lilley Bottom is a   
 long valley-like road with high       
 hedgerows.Wild rabbits,hares and rats 
 live here,and gaudy pheasants stand   
 like statues.The woods are enchanting 
 with many different shades of         
 green.There are about three hundred   
 houses in six villages dotted about   
 this area, and dozens of small farms. </content>
