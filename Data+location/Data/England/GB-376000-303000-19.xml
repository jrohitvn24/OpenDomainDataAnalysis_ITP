		<title>19LOCAL LEGENDS AND EVENTS.</title>
		<content> Within the study area there are 2     
 ghost stories that we are aware of.   
 The firstconcerns the Cosford Bridge  
 Pumping Works where a man is said to  
 have died during its construction by  
 falling into a borehole.He nows haunts
 the pumping room at night.The other   
 concerns a child who fell into one of 
 the pools at Hatton Grange and whose  
 mother was drowned attempting to save 
 her.She now drifts around the pool as 
 a"vague white shape."                 
  Other interesting events concern a   
 fire at Bowling Green House at which a
 horse drawn fire engine from Shifnal  
 pulled up incorrectly at a nearby farm
 and scared the pregnant farmers wife  
 so much that the baby was born there  
 and then and a Bonfire Night party    
 held in the meadow below Cosford Pool.
 Within hours of the 150 having left   
 the dam burst and flooded the meadow. </content>
