		<content>{Sheringham}is a small pleasant seaside
 town on the{North Norfolk coast.} It  
 is mainly a place where retired people
 come to live but there are 408        
 children in the primary school. It was
 originally a{fishing village}but after
 the First World War it became popular 
 for holidays.  It now has a population
 of 4,940.  Boats still fish from the  
 beach and the{town is famous for crabs
{and lobsters.} There are many lovely  
 walks to be enjoyed on the cliffs, the
 commons and through the woodlands near
 the town.                             
 Other{special features}are the 18 hole
 golf course, the private steam North  
 Norfolk Railway and the Little        
 Theatre.  We have two lifeboats.  One 
 is named the "Henry Ramey Upcher" and 
 is looked after by the Preservation   
 Society. The other is the present one 
 "Manchester Unity of Oddfellows."     </content>
