		<title>02The Farms at Weaverthorpe</title>
		<content>   In this very rural area, farming is 
 obviously the most important aspect.  
 The whole area is{intensively farmed,}
 with very narrow hedges or none at all
 and apart from a few chalk pits, there
 is hardly any unploughed land, except 
 from the steeper slopes in the dales  
 which are grazed by sheep.            
   When the land was enclosed in about 
 1803 under the leadership of{Sir}     
{Tatton Sykes}of Sledmere, the four    
 outlying farms were built and each    
 farmhouse and buildings surrounded by 
 a shelter belt. These form the only   
 woodland in the area. Most farms are  
 now{owner-occupied.}Six are still     
{family farms,}worked by the farmer and
 one or two others full-time workers,  
 often members of the family. Five     
 farmhouses are in the village itself.
