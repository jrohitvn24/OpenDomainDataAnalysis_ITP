		<title>08RAILWAY LINE STEVENAGE</title>
		<content> The railway line near our school is   
 the main route from London to Scotland
 The station was built near to the end 
 of the High Street. As it was a rural 
 area very few houses were knocked down
 but the brickyard in Symonds Green had
 to close. The Railway Arms was built  
 to supply the workers and travellers  
 on the new line.The railway helped to 
 change Stevenage because families who 
 wanted to live in the countryside but 
 work in London built large houses in  
 Julians Road and Hitchin Road just a  
 short walk from the station. Some of  
 these houses have been turned into    
 small hotels now and the old station  
 has been knocked down.Some small      
 factories have been built on the land 
 and a new station has been built in   
 the New Town to make it easier for the
 several thousand people who travel to 
 London every day to work.             </content>
