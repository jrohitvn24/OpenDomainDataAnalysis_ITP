		<content>{THE ROUTE}has three stages.  1-Ouse   
 Bridge through Messingermire to Park  
 Wood. 2-on to Dash Falls. 3-over      
 Skiddaw through Dodd, and down to St. 
 Bega's church. To complete the Parish 
 Boundary it is neccessary to swim or  
 sail down the middle of the lake.     
 I went on the hard third stage. I     
 signed my name in. We went to the top 
 of Dash and on upward following a     
 fence. The top of the slope was just  
 level with only a few more mounds to  
 the summit. We followed flags, and it 
 was  very welcoming to see the top of 
 Skiddaw (3,054ft.) and to sit down    
 under the shelter of stone walling and
 have our dinner.         Linda age 11.
 I did the first stage. We went across 
 fields climbed fences up little hills 
 crossed a main road and scrambled     
 through woods. By the end I was very  
 tired.                   Diane age 11.</content>
