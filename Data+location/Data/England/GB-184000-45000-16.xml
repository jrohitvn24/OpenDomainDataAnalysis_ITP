		<title>16Modern Farming Methods</title>
		<content>  Farmers have been using machinery for
 centuries.The earliest machinery(ox   
 pulled plough etc.)was very basic,and 
 did not help the land owners plough   
 very fast.                            
  Nowadays,machinery is much more      
 efficient.This helps the farmer get   
 his crops gathered,sprayed and        
 watered,cows milked and seeds planted 
 a lot faster.To gather the            
 crops,though you would need a combine 
 harvester (costing about Â£30,000).    
 Very few farmers have these as they   
 are very expensive and are only used  
 for about two days a year,so they hire
 them from machinery hirers or other   
 farmers.                              
   They did the same with helicopters  
 for spraying crops.The only people who
 invest in these are the farmers with  
 many thousands of acres.
