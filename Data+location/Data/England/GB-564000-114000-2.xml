		<title>02PARISH ADMINISTRATION</title>
		<content> Rural areas are administered by parish
 councils and our area falls into four 
 parishes. All right for Ponts Green &amp; 
 Brownbread Street completely within   
 the parish of Ashburnham. Not so good 
 for Bodle Street which has its head,  
 shoulders and half its right leg,so to
 speak,in Warbleton, its left leg in   
 Herstmonceux and its right foot in the
 parish of Wartling. This mess began a 
 long time ago,when the manors settled 
 outposts of land and developed farms  
 there. All was neatly tidied up by act
 of parliament in 1896.In the summer of
 1985 the situation is again fluid and 
 the boundary commissioners are to     
 decide whether to move all Bodle      
 Street into Warbleton,or to hand it   
 over to Herstmonceux. Do we care?     
 Probably not. We doubt whether one    
 person has made their feelings known  
 to the boundary commission.           </content>
