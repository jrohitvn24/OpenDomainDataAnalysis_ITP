		<title>03Uyeasound Up Helly Aa Galley</title>
		<content> At the 1984 Up Helly Aa,the galley was
 unusually burned instead of just      
 having a bonfire,as the galley was 22 
 years old and in need of replacement. 
   The new galley was built from       
 donated timber and plywood,by         
 voluntary labour in Uyeasound.It was  
 built in a shed on the Westside of    
 Uyeasound.It is hoped that a shed will
 be built to house the galley so that  
 she will last even longer than the    
 last one.This shed can also be used   
 for making the Up Helly Aa torches.   
   The new galley is called Thiki.The  
 1985 Guizer Jarl got this name from an
 old friend who told him it was the    
 name of a young Norwegian maiden who  
 waited on the shore for the Norsemen  
 returning from a raid.
