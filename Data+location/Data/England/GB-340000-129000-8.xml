		<title>08ASCENSION DAY, HIGH HAM</title>
		<content> For over 90 years on Ascension Day all
 the children from the village school  
 have walked in procession to the      
 church carrying flowers to decorate   
 the chancel screen and a cross. In    
 recent years a large crown was made   
 replacing the cross.The vicar takes   
 the service and dresses the screen.   
 The crown is filled with flowers and  
 the Chairman of School Governors and  
 the Headteacher raise the crown to the
 top of the rood screen, symbolising   
 the ascension of Christ from the      
 Mount. After the service the Vicar    
 joins the Headteacher in leading the  
 children who will be leaving the      
 school that summer to the top of the  
 church tower, again a symbol of the   
 occasion. Traditionally the children  
 were given the day off in celebration,
 but nowadays this holiday is given at 
 other times of the year.              </content>
