		<title>04Conservation in Dean</title>
		<content> A large part of Upper Dean is a       
 conservation area. It comprises a     
 number of loosely spaced building     
 groups arranged around an old road    
 pattern and situated on the lower     
 slopes of a very gentle valley. The   
 pattern of narrow, curving lanes is   
 emphasised by hedges and the close    
 penetration of the countryside into   
 every part of the area provide an     
 attractive setting for the old        
 buildings. Trees are especially       
 prominent around the church and 2 old 
 houses, Dean House and the Grange (now
 a school), whilst there are 2 open    
 areas in the heart of the village.    
 The church dating from 14th Century is
 a dominant feature, it's fine spire   
 forming a focus to the area.Dean House
 and Farmhouse are listed and others   
 are on the supplementary list, all    
 adding to the beauty of Dean.         </content>
