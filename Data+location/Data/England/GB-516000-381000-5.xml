 this area. There have been three      
 chapels in{East Barkwith}and one in   
{South Willingham.}Two of the chapels  
 in East Barkwith are dated 1860, that 
 is shortly after the split in         
 Methodism. They are both brick, with  
 slate roofs. One is now used as a     
 garage, the other is a dwelling house,
 and has been restored, and covered    
 with pink pebble-dash. The third      
 chapel is also brick and slate, it is 
 dated 1925, and has numerous stone    
 blocks with the names of people who   
 donated towards the building. It is   
 also a private house. The chapel in   
 South Willingham is dated 1834, and is
 built of brick and slate. It has      
 recently been converted to a private  
 house.
