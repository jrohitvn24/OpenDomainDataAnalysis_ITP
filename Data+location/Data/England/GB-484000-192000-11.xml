		<title>11ENTERTAINMENT IN WYCOMBE</title>
		<content>  Today in High Wycombe there are no   
{cinemas.}But before, High Wycombe had 
 about four cinemas.{The Palace Cinema 
 which was in Frogmoor was demolished, 
 so that some large stores could be    
 built. It was built in 1969 in        
 September. It was built in a converted
 Methodist Chapel. But in 1973 it was  
 burnt and had to be built again. The  
{Electroscope Theatre}in Oxford Road   
 was closed in 1930 and then demolished
 in 1969, to make more room for the    
 rebuilding of the King's Head.        
  High Wycombe has no theatre now,since
 the{Intimate Theatre}in Frogmore was  
 converted into offices.               
  There are two{Bingo halls,}several   
 Disco halls and{night clubs.}Otherwise
 people have to go elsewhere for       
 entertainment.
