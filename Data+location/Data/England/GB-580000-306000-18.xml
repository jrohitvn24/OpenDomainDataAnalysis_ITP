		<title>18THE PEDLAR OF SWAFFHAM</title>
		<content>                                       
  The legend tells of one John Chapman,
 who was a merchant or pedlar living   
 in Swaffham in the early Fifteenth    
 Century, who had a vivid dream that if
 he went to London Bridge he would meet
 there a man who would make his        
 fortune.He went and met a shopkeeper  
 who told John that he had had a dream 
 about a man called Chapman, from a    
 town called Swaffham, in whose garden 
 was a tree, under which was a pot of  
 gold. John hurried home and dug up the
 gold in a brass pot. On selling the   
 pot a potential purchaser translated  
 an inscription which asserted that a  
 further, larger pot was under the     
 original. Again John held his peace   
 and went home to dig up the pot. He   
 used some of the money to help the    
 church during the rebuilding in the   
 C15th.                                </content>
