  The roads in Culmstock are becoming  
 more crowded and dangerous every day. 
  In 1968 when I first came to the     
 village,there was a twice daily bus   
 service to Tiverton, Cullompton and   
 Wellington together with school       
 coaches bringing the Primary children 
 to the village and taking the older   
 children to Uffculme and Tiverton.    
  The regular bus services have gone   
 and a coach company runs a private    
 service thrice weekly to Taunton via  
 Wellington and additionally twice to  
 Wellington and once to Exeter. School 
 coaches to the village and Uffculme   
 remain.                               
  The biggest change has been the      
 designation of the principal road     
 through the village as a lorry route.
