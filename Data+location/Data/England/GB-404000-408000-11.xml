		<content> The majority of the housing in this   
 area is concentrated in squares 1 and 
 2 and while there is a small amount of
 owner occupied housing the majority of
 dwellings are council owned           
 properties.  These consist of terraced
 housing found on either side of the   
 'main' road going through the area and
 a second and more recently built      
 crescent of semi-detached houses.     
 Some of the latter have been made into
 flats, two in each house, for the     
 elderly residents.  Some of the older 
 buildings are old weavers cottages and
 farm houses which have been           
 modernised.  These show that the main 
 industries of the area were weaving   
 and farming.
