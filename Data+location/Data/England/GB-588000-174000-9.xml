		<content>      IN JULY 1985 THERE ARE 2         
 IMPORTANT TOPICS OF LOCAL NEWS. THE   
 CLOSING OF THE{MATERNITY-UNIT}AND THE 
 ROADWORKS ON{THE A249.}THE TIMES      
 GUARDIAN IS SUPPORTING THE            
 M.U.M.S.(MATERNITY-UNIT MUST          
 STAY)CAMPAIGN.                        
      THE MATERNITY-UNIT IS THREATENED 
 WITH CLOSURE BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT
 CUTS IN PUBLIC SPENDING. IT IS NOT    
 CONSIDERED ECONOMICAL TO KEEP A SMALL 
 UNIT OPEN WHEN ANY PROBLEMS HAVE TO BE
 SENT TO MEDWAY HOSPITAL ANYWAY.       
      MOST PEOPLE IN SHEPPEY FEEL THE  
 MATERNITY-UNIT SHOULD STAY OPEN       
 BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE DO NOT OWN A CAR. 
 MANY WOMEN WOULD FIND TRAVELLING TO   
 MEDWAY BY BUS AND TRAIN DIFFICULT AND 
 THEY MAY NOT GO. IT MAY ALSO BE       
 DANGEROUS IF THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY   
 AND THE KINGS-FERRY BRIDGE WAS UP.
