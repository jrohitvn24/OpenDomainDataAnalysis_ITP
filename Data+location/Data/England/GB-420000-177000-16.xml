		<title>16PASTIMES &amp; LEISURE SPORTS</title>
		<content> The main sporting activity in this    
 area is horse-riding, although very   
 few horses are stabled in the         
 district.  It is excellent country for
 long distance riding.                 
 Hang-gliding is practiced on a small  
 scale from Liddington Hill, together  
 with the flying of model aircraft and 
 children's kites.                     
 If the snow fall is heavy in the      
 winter then the skiers take to the    
 slopes, often accompanied by          
 youngsters on their toboggans.        
 The most obvious leisure activity is  
 walking.  This is a wonderful area to 
 walk with quite breath-taking views   
 from the high points.                 
 Pheasant shooting is carried out in a 
 small area on the downs (with         
 pheasants specially bred for the      
 sport).                               
                                       </content>
