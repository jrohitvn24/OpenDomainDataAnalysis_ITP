		<content> On the 4th October l985,{Mrs.Jennie}  
{Teasdale}and her husband 'Albie'will  
 be retiring from their jobs as school 
 caretakers. Jennie's first job after  
 leaving school at l4 was as a baker's 
 delivery girl in Sunderland.She later 
 worked in York City Hospital as a cook
 until l94O.She then joined the Auxili-
 ary Territorial Service(ATS)where she 
 trained to become an Aircraft Recog-  
 nition expert or'Plane Spotter'.As a  
 crew member of an anti_aircraft or    
 'Heavy Ack_Ack'gun battery which was  
 sited near Dalmeny railway station at 
 South Queensferry in Scotland, she    
 recalls the Battery's alarm bell ring-
 ing to call out the crew on bitterly  
 cold war time nights to 'take post'   
 ready to meet Hitler's squadrons of   
 JU88's and Dorniers. Happy retirement 
 to you both,from Surrey Street School!
