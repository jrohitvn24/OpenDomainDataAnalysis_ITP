		<title>12Doodle Bug on Dedworth cont.</title>
		<content> Soon we arrived home. There was broken
 glass everywhere, people running      
 around dodging squawking chickens. Dad
 jumped off his bicycle and carried to 
 his friends."What's been hit?" my     
 father asked one man. "They hit the   
 bloomin' incinerator they built       
 themselves mate," the chap replied as 
 he dashed off. The incinerator had    
 been built by German prisoners of war.
 Mercifully to my knowledge there was  
 only one casualty of a serious nature 
 the day the Doodle Bug fell on        
 Dedworth and that was the lady who    
 miscarried her baby. She survived to  
 have more babies later. There were    
 many people cut from the flying glass 
 as many windows were blown out. I had 
 no ill effects at all except a        
 lifelong memory of the day the nasty  
 old Doodle Bug stopped little six year
 old me having a ride on the swings.   </content>
