		<title>02THE GROWTH OF WYKE</title>
		<content> The textile industry also developed in
 the area during the Industrial        
 Revolution and has remained to this   
 day.  However, with the recent slump  
 in Britain's textile trade, its       
 presence in the area has been         
 greatly reduced. Benson and Turners   
 spinning and dyeing complex in Wyke   
 and a textile engineers at Low Moor,  
 were the only factories we found in   
 the area still engaged in the trade.  
 The final stage in the area's         
 development came with the large       
 housing estates built mostly in the   
 post Second World War period. Council 
 estates were built at Woodside, Delph 
 Hill, and behind St.Mary's Cgurch,    
 Wyke.  Private estates and old        
 people's housing were built around    
 Wyke Common. Recent building has      
 appeared in Low Moor, Woodside and    
 Wyke on re-developed and infil sites. </content>
