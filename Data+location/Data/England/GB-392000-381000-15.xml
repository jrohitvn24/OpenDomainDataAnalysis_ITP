 Nelson Farm,near Wood Lane Ends,is    
 owned by Mr.Grindey.His farm consisted
 of almost 63acres,but he rented extra 
 land so that he farmed altogether 200 
 acres.He had 110 cattle and 70 of them
 were milkers.The other 40 were heifers
 and so were too young to have had     
 calves.All Mr.Grindeys cows were      
 Freisans,but he also had a Freisan    
 bull and a Hereford bull.200 gallons  
 of milk was produced each day from his
 herd of 70 milking cows.Most of the   
 milk was sold to the Milk Marketing   
 Board,who collected it from the farm  
 each day in a tanker lorry.The only   
 other livestock on the farm were      
 sheep.Mr.Grindey and his son worked   
 the farm together.He said that he very
 much enjoyed his work.
