		<title>20Issues in The Shelsleys</title>
		<content>   There are worries to disturb our    
 tranquil country life; residents of   
 Martley Hillside are concerned about  
 Penny Hill quarry, now used as a tip, 
 although thankfully, toxic waste has  
 been banned. Nonetheless, the nuisance
 of heavy lorries and plagues of flies 
 is considerable.                      
                                       
   The Shelsleys' worries are less     
 immediate but no less valid. With no  
 real village centre it sometimes seems
 there is a lack of community spirit   
 and little entertainment for the      
 young.

   This survey was undertaken by       
 members of the Shelsleys W.I. with the
 assistance of Col.T.J.Bowen, Georgina 
 and Alexander Perry and Hilda and
