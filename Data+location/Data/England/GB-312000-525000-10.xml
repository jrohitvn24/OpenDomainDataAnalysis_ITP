		<content> Most households have a vacuum cleaner,
 washing machine, fridge, freezer and  
 an electric or solid fuel cooker.     
 Pressure cookers, blenders and food   
 misers are also used and more         
 recently, microwave ovens. Vegetables,
 hard and soft fruits are grown and    
 much traditional fare is produced e.g.
 home cooking and baking, jams, chutney
 and wine. Advantage is also taken of  
 convenience foods. Heating is provided
 by coal, wood, electricity, oil and   
 even solar panels. Since the erection 
 of a relay mast in 1983 good colour   
 T.V. has been received. Viewing (live 
 or on video) is a popular pastime     
 together with the playing of tapes and
 records. Bridge, Scrabble, reading,   
 knitting and sewing are also enjoyed. 
 Domestic pets include dogs, cats,     
 guidea-pigs, rabbits. All farms have  
 working collies and one breeds setters</content>
