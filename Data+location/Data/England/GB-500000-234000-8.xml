		<title>08INDUSTRY IN FLITWICK.</title>
		<content> Industry met local needs until the    
 village began to expand in the 1950's.
 As more people came to live here and  
 the{M1 motorway}was built nearby a    
 large{glass factory}was located in the
 town. A by-pass has improved road     
 communication and an industrial estate
 is being developed. A railway siding  
 exists but is little used.            
 Flitwick has two{furniture factories  
 which have grown from small companies 
 to sell their products nationally.    
 Smaller factories exist which supply  
 the goods and services the large      
 companies need such as boxes for      
 packing, pallets for storage and      
 handling and transport facilities.    
 A large{distribution centre}run by    
 a road haulage company uses our       
 proximity to the M1 and Flitwick's    
 mid-way position between London and   
 the Midlands.                         </content>
