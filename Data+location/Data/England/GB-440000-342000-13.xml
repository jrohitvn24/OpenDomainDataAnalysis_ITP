 The Post Office and general store is  
 useful for things to buy that you     
 would use everyday. It is a small shop
 with a small post office on the left,a
 fridge counter straight ahead and a   
 window  on the right with a ledge on  
 which  are penny sweets. When we went 
 we would not ask many  questions      
 because the man there was a friend who
 was just looking after the shop for   
 the day. It is on a corner of the     
 street at the cross roads so it is    
 easy for all the villagers to reach.  
 The public house in Mapperley is      
 called the Black Horse, the owners    
 have been in the Pub for 18 months. It
 consists of a tap room, smoke room and
 a hall with old farm tools and        
 gambling machines. The brewers are    
 Kimberley Ales. There are 2 churches, 
 a Methodist and Church Of England.    </content>
