		<content>{The Cardiothoracic Institute,}a centre
 for scientific research in cardio-    
 pulmonary medicine, was founded in    
 1970 and is funded by a charitable    
 trust.  Situated in the grounds of the
 King Edward VII Hospital,it provides  
 extensive research facilities directed
 principally to the clinical           
 investigation of cardio-pulmonary     
 disease.  An important part of the    
 work is directed to the needs of the  
 community and clinical care is given  
 in conjunction with the hospital.  The
 Institute is concerned with the social
 impact of disease on the community,   
 its effect on the individual, on      
 specific organs, tissues, cells and   
 subcellular components.  Services     
 provided include acute coronary care, 
 continuing care for carcinoma as well 
 as internal medicine with an emphasis 
 on cardio-pulmonary disease.          </content>
