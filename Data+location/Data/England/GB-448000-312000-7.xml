 the varied geology and soils of the   
 area.Open moorland,hill pasture,sandy 
 oak wood and marsh vegetation are all 
 present while verges along sheltered  
 lanes and motorway banks are rich in  
 wild flowers.Viola palustris survives 
 in Ulverscroft pond and bluebells in  
 the woods also a little heather and   
 bilberry on Beacon Hill.Badgers live  
 there and among other of the larger   
 animals are foxes,grey squirrels,     
 stoats &amp; weasels.On Beacon Hill too   
 are newts also adders and these like  
 all the wildlife there are protected.2

 open slopes are the meadow pipit and  
 reed bunting.Woodland birds here are  
 warblers,nuthatch &amp; great spotted     
 woodpecker while in the winter siskin 
 &amp; redpoll are present in birchwood.
