 There are approx.20 different farms in
 the parish of Snainton with 3 still   
 being on the main street.             
 The farms to the south of the village 
 are on the old Lake Pickering bed and 
 have good fertile land used mainly for
 the growing of corn. The use of oil   
 seed rape has grown over the last few 
 years. There are some cattle kept.    
 On the rising land to the North of the
 Village sheep are reared along with   
 corn.Several of the farms have large  
 pig rearing units and some poultry.   
                                       
 In the village there are several      
{Market Gardens}which supply the       
 Markets in Scarborough and the Holiday
 Trade.
