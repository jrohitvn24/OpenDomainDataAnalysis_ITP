   The castle was built at hte end of  
 the thirteenth century as a fortified 
 farm surrounded by a moat.A dwelling  
 house was added, with the             
 fortification provided some 200 years 
 later. In 1506 the estate was         
 inherited by Sir Thomas Bullen, father
 of Anne Boleyn. On his death, it was  
 acquired by Henry VIII who granted it 
 to Anne of Cleves in 1540.            
   In 1903 the castle was bought by    
 William Waldorf Astor who restored and
 redecorated it throughout. He built   
 an adjoining village in Tudor style   
 cottages and designed the lake and the
 Italian Gardens.
