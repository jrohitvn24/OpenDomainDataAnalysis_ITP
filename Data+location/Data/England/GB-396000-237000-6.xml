		<title>06THE HAMLET OF KERSOE</title>
		<content>   This was known in the Saxon as      
{Criddesho}(780 AD) and is situated on 
 the South Eastern slopes of Bredon    
 Hill. It consists of 32 dwellings     
 ranging from Elizabethan to Victorian 
 with one, post second world war house.
   Kersoe Farm of 800 acres, is mainly 
 concerned with cereal growing but also
 has sheep and beef cattle. Middle Farm
 has 9 acres of grassland and Manor    
 Farm Stables 19 acres divided         
 between grass and market garden.      
   Twenty years ago the population     
 numbered 40, mostly in agricultural   
 employment, but with the changes of   
 demand for workers on the land despite
 the population numbers being almost   
 the same, most newcomers are of the   
 professional type, with cars and many 
 of the modern conveniences. Only eight
 can now be found working on the land.
