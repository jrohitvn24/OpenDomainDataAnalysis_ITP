		<title>15Family Life:Peter Tavy Area</title>
		<content> Most people living here were not born 
 in this area.The main reason that they
 came here was because some of their   
 families were now living in this area.
 A few people came here for work.Some  
 people came because they wanted to get
 away from the city,some retired here  
 and one person inherited a house.The  
 average family had two parents and    
 some children.Most school-age children
 go to Tavistock schools,but two go to 
 Plymouth and one goes to a ballet     
 school in Surrey.All the school-age   
 children wear school uniform.The most 
 popular out of school wear was jeans  
 and sweat shirts.Most people in the   
 area had pets,the most popular being  
 dogs and cats but some people had     
 Guinea Pigs and rabbits.
