 CENTRE, GT.YARMOUTH                   
   The Seashore Holiday Centre was     
 originally owned by the Beckett       
 family. It was opened in 1953, &amp; had  
 only 160 caravans, a shop,a store room
 and an office. In 1955 the 'Mermaid'  
 Club was opened. By 1960 a Swimming   
 Pool was built. Then the business was 
 sold to the Caister Group,who didn't  
 have enough money to advertise and    
 keep up standards, and so sold it to  
 Ladbroke's.                           
   Mr. Starbuck visited our school and 
 told us their season started around   
 Whitsun &amp; ended in late September. At 
 any one time, up to 5.5 thousand      
 people may stay at the camp, and      
 because of the numbers, a lot of staff
 are needed.
