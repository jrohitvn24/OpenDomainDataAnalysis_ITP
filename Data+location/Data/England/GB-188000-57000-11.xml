		<title>11Summer Visitors.</title>
		<content> Every summer  lots of visitors come to
 Cornwall for their holidays.Many      
 travel by car and they often tow      
 caravans behind them.On Saturdays in  
 summer,especially during July and     
 August,Indian Queens,Fraddon and St.  
 Columb Road are choked by traffic     
 trying to get through to other        
 places in Cornwall and to Newquay.    
 Others going the other way are trying 
 to get home.The local people get very 
 annoyed because it is difficult to get
 about because of the traffic.There is 
 supposed to be a by pass road going to
 be built in a few years time,and then 
 the cars will not have to come through
 the village and everyone will be glad.
 Some people take in holidaymakers to  
 earn some extra money.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
