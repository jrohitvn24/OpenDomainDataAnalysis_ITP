		<title>16Angling Club Irthlingborough</title>
		<content>  There is a flourishing angling club  
in Irthlingborough because there are so
many places locally to fish. There is  
the river Nene, the canal and a lot of 
disused gravel pits. The club caters   
for beginners and experienced          
fishermen who are happy to pass on     
their expertise. The anglers meet every
Saturday and Sunday in the season,     
starting early in the morning. During  
any holiday period, they meet any day  
of the week that they can. The cost of 
30p for one session,covers transport   
but not tackle and bait. The fishermen 
meet together in the High Street and   
travel by van to the particular fishing
spot chosen for that day.
