		<title>07All Saints Church Gt.Thurlow</title>
		<content> All Saints Church is a pretty,flint   
 construction in the village of Gt.    
 Thurlow.The original church has been  
 here since before 1066,but the        
 building has been changed over the    
 centuries.Possibly the oldest thing in
 the church is the font-11th or 12th C.
 but this may be a copy.The arches     
 inside suggest that they were built in
 the 12th century,with a clerestory    
 added later.One of the pews is dated  
 1616,and the huge wooden door with a  
 massive key date from slightly        
 earlier.The church has a beautiful    
 chalice and paten made around 1650.In 
 one of the registers, whose first     
 entry is 1837,many names are signed"X"
 as the farm-workers at that time could
 not read or write.
