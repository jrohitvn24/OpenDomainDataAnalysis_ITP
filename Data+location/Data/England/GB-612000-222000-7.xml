		<title>07The Council Chairman</title>
		<content> Councillor Percy Rayner is the        
 Chairman for the year 1985.This is the
 second time he has been chairman for  
 Tendring.He goes to a function every  
 day, sometimes twice a day.The        
 functions vary from opening a small   
 school fete to having a full-scale    
 council meeting.                      
 The Chairman has almost the same job  
 as a Mayor.Tendring does not have a   
 Mayor because it is a district        
 council.Cllr. Percy Rayner also has to
 wear a chain which he is not allowed  
 to wear in other towns without        
 permission.The chairman's wife also   
 wears a chain which signifies the     
 chairman's consort.It has letters on  
 it which stand for the Tendring       
 Council's consort.
