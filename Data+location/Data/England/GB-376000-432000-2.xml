		<content>{  Altham}is a small village in the    
 district of Hyndburn, Lancashire. It  
 used be quite important because of its
 church. However, now it is only a     
 hamlet and has no shops since the post
 office closed. There are virtually no 
 public services except a bus route. An
 ambulance station serves the Hyndburn 
 area.                                 
   The Walton Arms used to be a pub    
 but is now a restaurant. Also         
 Martholme Grange, formally a private  
 house, is now a night club-restaurant.
   Altham School with only 28 pupils   
 and 2 teachers was scheduled for      
 closure, but parents and friends ran a
 successful campaign, S.A.V.E. (Support
 Altham Village Education) and a       
 reprieve was granted.                 
   This rural area boasts a developing 
 industrial estate and 6 farms.
