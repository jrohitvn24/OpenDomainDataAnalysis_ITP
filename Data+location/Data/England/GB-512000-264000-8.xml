		<content>    The young children in our area     
 attend the Village Playgroup, which   
 meets in the Westcott Room ..... a    
 purpose-designed portacabin on the    
 Village Playing Field.                
    For two years a group of mothers   
 fund-raised Â£6,000 and, thanks to the 
 support of our community, the new     
 Playroom was opened in 1983.          
    As a registered charity, the       
 business side of Playgroup is         
 organised by a committee. Fees are    
 80p. per child per morning.           
    A Supervisor and two Assistants    
 plan and organise the sessions. There 
 is a homely atmosphere where children 
 can play with sand, water, glue and   
 paints etc., dress up and role-play,  
 climb and slide, talk, listen to      
 stories, sing, dance and dramatise.
