		<title>10Employment in Papworth</title>
		<content> The village is unique as most of the  
 population is employed by Papworth    
 Village Industries, which were        
 established by the Trust. The         
 principal industries are printing and 
 leatherwork, but there are others.    
 They also employ able-bodied people   
 from outside the Settlement, but are  
 primarily there for the handicapped   
 people. The whole is a registered     
 charity and so any profits made go    
 back to the Trust.                    
                                       
 Some members of the village are       
 employed in the Hospital, which is now
 under the control of the National     
 Health Service.
