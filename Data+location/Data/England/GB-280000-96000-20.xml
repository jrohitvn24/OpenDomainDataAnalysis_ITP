		<content>{FACTS AND FIGURES:}The farm is 60     
 acres or 25 hectares large, and the   
 land is used for pasture.The only     
 crops grown are vegetables which the  
 Bickleys keep for themselves.There are
 40 Freisian cattle,20 young replace-  
 ments,a few calves and 10             
 beef(Herefords).                      
 There is also an apple orchard for    
 cider making.Mr Bickley sells the     
 apples now,though he used to make his 
 own.We call it Scrumpi in Devon.      
  The machines used on the farm are    
 Dung Spreaders,Hay makers,2           
 tractors.All the hay is baled into    
 large plastic bags holding 1/2 ton    
 each(55 tons altogether).             
  There are two wells on the farm for  
 water(they are not on Mains water).   
  The milk production had to be cut by 
 10 percent owing to Common Market     
 regulations(too much milk produced).  </content>
