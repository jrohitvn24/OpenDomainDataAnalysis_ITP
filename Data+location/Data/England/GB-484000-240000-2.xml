		<title>02FAMILY WAKING GRT. LINFORD</title>
		<content> We awake to the sound of the Teasmade 
 making our early morning cup of tea at
 7.00 a.m. While the tea is brewing Jen
 gets up and goes downstairs to take   
 the washing from the washing machine  
 which washes the clothes overnight,   
 and hangs them out to dry (if it is   
 wet the clothes are spread around the 
 heating radiators in the house). Jen  
 then empties the clean dishes from the
 dishwasher, ready to take today's     
 dishes as they are dirtied. Tea is now
 brewed, so she tries to drag Craig    
 away from the TV where he is watching 
 Children's Channel courtesy of MKTV.  
 Jen then wakes Wayne and Claire. They 
 all descend upon me, in bed, while I  
 am trying to snatch a few extra       
 minutes sleep. Arguments ensue about  
 who sits where around the tea tray at 
 the side of our bed.
