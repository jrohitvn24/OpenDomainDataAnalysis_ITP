		<content>   Chilton has seen many changes within
 living memory. In 1925 the village was
 really two separate places of Chilton 
 and Windlestone. Two coal mines and a 
 coke plant were working as was a      
 blacksmith's. All these have since    
 disappeared.                          
   In 1945 the mines were still        
 working, Chilton had expanded and     
 was almost a self-contained community 
 with local shops of nearly every type.
 It had two picture houses and schools 
 that ranged from infants to seniors. A
 level crossing carried a railway line 
 across what was the A1 at Chilton.    
   By the end of the 1960's the coal   
 mines had shut down and working people
 had to find employment outside the    
 village. More council houses had been 
 built by this time but the cinemas    
 were no longer in existence and the   
 railway line had been dismantled.     </content>
