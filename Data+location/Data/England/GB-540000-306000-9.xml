		<content> WISBECH ST. MARY PLAYGROUP.           
 The playgroup was formed in l982,     
 prior to this there were no facilities
 for the under-fives in Wisbech St.    
 Mary.                                 
 The group is run by a committee and   
 there is a leader and two helpers to  
 take care of the children during the  
 morning sessions.                     
 The pavillion in the playing field is 
 hired, for a nominal fee, to hold our 
 morning meetings. These take place on 
 a Monday, Wednesday and Friday from   
 9.l5a.m.-11.45a.m. Children are       
 accepted from the age of three        
 years and we can take up to twelve    
 children each morning.                
 The group is funded by fees charged   
 and various fund raising events which 
 are organised by the committee.
