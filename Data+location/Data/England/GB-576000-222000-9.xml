 Braintree College of Further          
 Education                             
 is the smallest college in Essex.     
 There is a wide selection of courses  
 for full, part time, day release and  
 evening students. The college runs a  
 club for retired people and has many  
 overseas students from all over the   
 world. Chapel Hill primary school was 
 built in the 1920's and has extensive 
 grounds. Stisted has a small village  
 school. Our school,although not in our
 area,was built in 1862 and is the     
 oldest school in Braintree. The       
 primary schools all feed into three   
 large comprehensive schools.
