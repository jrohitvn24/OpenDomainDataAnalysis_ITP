		<title>12TRANSPORT TRAFFIC ROADS CARS</title>
		<content>The M2 motorway crosses the south west 
corner of the grid. There is a heavy   
traffic flow especially during week    
days when the  road is used by a great 
many commercial vehicles. These come   
from all over the country and Europe.  
                                       
During the summer the road is very busy
with cars taking tourists to the Kent  
ports and holiday resorts. The road    
carries over 4 000 vehicles an hour in 
both directions during the day. The    
only other important road is the B2163 
which links Sittingbourne and          
Hollingbourne. This old road,narrow    
and especially dangerous during the    
winter, has many blind corners. The    
other roads are twisting country       
lanes,having high hedgerows and        
carrying only a handful of local       
traffic.
