		<content>  {Leigh}is a small village whose      
 houses are scattered along each side  
 of one main road and several lanes.   
 There are small cottages which are    
 over two hundred years old and local  
 authority houses.                     
  On the edge of the village is a      
{Riding School}with twentyone horses.  
 There is also a small home industry   
 where a husband and wife team work as 
 craft design engineers, producing work
 needing high precision. These, along  
 with the farms and school, provide a  
 limited amount of employment.         
 The School, built in 1894, has just   
 two classrooms with a total of        
 twentyfive children,  aged five to    
 eleven years.  The old school house is
 now an {Outdoor Education Centre}where
 Wiltshire school children camp.       
 The{Women's Institute}meet in the     
 school once a month.                  </content>
