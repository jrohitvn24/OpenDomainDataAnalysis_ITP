		<title>03OUR NEW LIBRARY</title>
		<content>                                       
  We have a new library in             
 Burnham-on-Sea which has cost         
 approximately Â£300,000, including the 
 cost of the site. The staff consist of
 two qualified librarians, two full    
 time assistants, five part time       
 assistants and two part time cleaners.
                                       
  There are about 30,000 books         
 available to borrow from the library, 
 and there are also a children's       
 section and a reference section       
 upstairs.                             
                                       
  The library is, of course, much      
 bigger than the old one, as it now has
 to serve a catchment population of    
 17,000.                               
                                       
  We are very thrilled about our lovely
 new library.                          </content>
