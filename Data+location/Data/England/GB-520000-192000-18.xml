 The linear shopping area around the   
 Green Man is another feature.The shops
 are a local attraction and make the   
 area very busy during trading hours:  
 roads are narrowed by parked cars,    
 particularly the Deans Lane road for  
 100-150 metres south of the junction. 
 The motorway(M1) passes through the   
 north-east corner of the grid square  
 on its way into and out of London:the 
 arterial road of the A41 running      
 roughly west- east passes through the 
 northern part of the square : both    
 contribute to the noise level in thier
 immediate areas and to the pollution.
