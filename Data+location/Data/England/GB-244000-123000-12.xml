		<content>__Cont.)Good weather is also very impor
-tant.We have to do a lot of preparat- 
ion for corn harvest.We have to grease 
the combine in different places so that
it is all in working order.We have to  
change and sharpen the knives.When all 
this is done we are ready to start.We  
have about 64 acres of our own to cut  
as well.Grandfather helps by taking his
combine out contracting.We also have   
some wheat to cut with an old fashioned
binder for thatching.When we have done 
all this we have to bale the straw and 
get that into the barn.A neighbouring  
farmer usually helps mum and I do this.
Corn harvest is a very long and tiring 
time.We usually get up at 7 o'clock and
take dad and 'Father to their combines.
We help them unsheet,refuel and grease.
We usually finish baling at 9 o'clock  
in the evening,and then go and fetch th
-em.Tho'it's long and tiring I enjoy it</content>
