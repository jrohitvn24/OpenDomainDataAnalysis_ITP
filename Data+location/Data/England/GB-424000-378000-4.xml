		<content> The functions room doubles as a family
 room at weekends as children are not  
 normally allowed in the bar areas. The
 Maynard Arms is an hotel with         
 conference/ballroom facilities,       
 boasting a lovely view from the dining
 room of the nightly floodlit gardens. 
 Mobile refreshments vans litter the   
 roadside in summer offering ice-creams
 teas and snacks. From the old Toll    
 House an acute bend leads back to     
 Ringinglow offering lorry and bus free
 motoring, spectacular views over      
 Bamford and beyond, but also hazardous
 conditions on an icy winters day. As  
 the motorist passes through this area,
 he may not only appreciate the        
 creators of the millstones, hewn from 
 the moorland boulders but also the    
 conservation work of National Parks   
 and Country Parks, free for all to    
 enjoy.                                </content>
