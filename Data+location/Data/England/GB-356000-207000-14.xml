		<content>                                       
 THE INN WAS BUILT OVER 378 YEARS      
 AGO,ON AN IRONMINE SHAFT.THE MINE     
 CLOSED IN 1605.THERE USED TO BE A     
 COTTAGE NEXT TO THE PUB,BUT IT WAS    
 DESTROYED IN A STORM IN 1785.THE      
 PRESENT BUILDING HAS NOT CHANGED      
 MUCH.THERE ARE STILL MANY WOODEN      
 CEILING BEAMS.THE KITCHEN IS HALF     
 UNDERGROUND.THE PUB HAS 3 ACRES OF    
 LAND,PART OF WHICH IS A BEER GARDEN &amp; 
 AN ORCHARD ,WITH 17 PLUMTREES &amp;2      
 APPLETREES.I LIKE LIVING AT THE INN,I 
 AM PHILIP LEADBEATER.MY MUM IS THE    
 LICENSEE.IN THIS DAY AND AGE I THINK  
 THAT MANY CHANGES COULD BE MADE TO    
 MAKE LIFE MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE INN 
 FOR THE FAMILY.THERE ARE FOUR OF      
 US,MYSELF,MUM &amp;MY TWO OLDER BROTHERS. 
 THE INN IS PLEASANTLY SITUATED.
