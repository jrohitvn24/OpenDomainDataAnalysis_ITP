		<title>14RELIGION IN KEMPSTON</title>
		<content> Within the urban area there are 3 main
 places of worship;{The Church of the  
{Transfiguration,}a 20th Century brick-
 built Anglican building, and two      
{Methodist Chapels, Kempston East and  
{West}the latter being the most recent.
 All three Christian places of worship 
 generate a wide variety of{activities 
 ranging from Sunday School,youth group
 Womens' Discussion Groups,Men's Groups
 and many social events and outings.   
{Congregations}are diminishing and     
 although some lively youth groups     
 involve children for some years, the  
{majority are aged over 40.}Despite a  
 large resident{immigrant community    
 there are no temples, mosques or other
 places of worship for the Sikhs,Hindus
 or Muslims within our area. Most of   
 these will travel to Bedford. Within  
{school communities}most are happy to  
 attend the daily Religious Assembly.  </content>
