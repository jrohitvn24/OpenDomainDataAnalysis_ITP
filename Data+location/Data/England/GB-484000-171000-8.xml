		<content> There are only primary schools in our 
 area, so pupils over eleven travel to 
 Bracknell for secondary schooling.    
 Many Binfield pupils attend Garth Hill
 School. As Binfield is built on top of
 a hill the journey is a pleasant one  
 through picturesque scenery, but the  
 return, uphill, is tiring. School     
 begins at 8.55 with registration.     
 There are 8 thirty-five minute lessons
 each day with a break after each two. 
 The longest break is at lunch-time.   
 Lunch is eaten in the cafeteria       
 whether bought there,or brought from  
 home. There is a wide variety of      
 subjects taught at the school, from   
 which older pupils choose options for 
 public examinations in the 5th &amp; 7th  
 years. Most pupils leave school at 16 
 years, but there is a 6th form of     
 about 130 pupils. Pupils enjoy sports,
 drama and music outside lessons.      </content>
