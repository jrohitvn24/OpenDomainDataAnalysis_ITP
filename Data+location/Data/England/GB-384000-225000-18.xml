   THe roads in Gloucestershire were   
 very bad before turnpike roads like   
 the A.38 were built (1764).Bulky      
 goods were taken by the River Severn  
 in barges called{SEVERN TROWS}.The    
 railways came in the 1840's but passed
 to the  east of the area.The nearest  
 stations were Gloucester, Cheltenham  
 and Tewkesury. Traffic returned to the
 A.38 main road in the 1920's and 30's 
 and became  very heavy by 1960.       
 Traffic jams used to extend 5 to 10   
 miles on either side of Tewkesbury    
 during summer weekends and the locals 
 said that some women were able to get 
 out of a car and do some shopping and 
 meet their husbands only a little way 
 down the High Street. The M.5.        
 Motorway opened  in the early 70's    
 took most of the through traffic  away
 from the main road.                   </content>
