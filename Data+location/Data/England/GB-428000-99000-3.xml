		<content> Marlpit Oak is a sample of many small 
 copses on heathland. It is dominated  
 by sloe with hawthorn,bramble and     
 bracken. A cluster of oak trees near  
 the road has a sample 13 metres high. 
   On the path from Tile Barn to Boldre
 the wooded parkland was grazed by a   
 large flock of sheep. Brockenhurst    
 wood is in the care of Hampshire and  
 Isle of Wight Naturalists' Trust. The 
 first 100 metres has a few oak        
 standards underlain by sycamore       
 saplings, ash saplings, hawthorn,     
 bracken and bramble. Further along a  
 15 metre square in more mature        
 woodland had an oak 15 metres high, 2 
 other oaks, 1 beech, 2 silver birch, a
 number of saplings with a ground cover
 of bracken.                           
   On the N. side of the valley in an  
 area of oak and beech there is a 20m. 
 high oak (girth=3.7metres near base). </content>
