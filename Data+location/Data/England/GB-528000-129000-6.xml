		<title>06LOCAL POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> ...winter,a lot of his time is spent  
 dealing with poachers.Not only        
 are pheasants  stolen but also        
 Christmas turkeys and chickens and    
 even Christmas trees are not safe.    
                                       
  Although P.C.Holland is Balcombe's   
 policeman,he and his colleagues have  
 to cover Lindfield, Ardingly,         
 Handcross,Bolney and also help out in 
 Haywards Heath and Crawley. He has    
 too much paperwork which takes up a   
 lot of time. On late shift P.C.Holland
 finishes at around 11.00 p.m.,but this
 can be later at weekends. He usually  
 gets to bed at around midnight.       
                                       
  His job is very dangerous.He has been
 shot at by poachers but luckily they  
 missed.
