		<title>08The Methodist Chapel</title>
		<content> A Methodist Sciety was formed here    
 around l820, but the church building  
 was dedicated in October l850. There  
 are services every Sunday afternoon,  
 with Sunday School in the morning. The
 membership is very small: average     
 attendance is six, with a Minister or 
 local preacher from the Dorchester    
 Circuit. The building is registered   
 for marriages. It is a very plain and 
 simple building with seating for      
 ninety. Music is provided by a        
 harmonium-type organ which has seen   
 better days, but as true Methodists   
 singing goes well. The highlight of   
 the year is Harvest Festival, with the
 church beautifully decorated with home
 grown fruit, flowers and vegetables.  
 Once a year members of the Parish and 
 Congregational Churches come to Bere  
 Heath for a combined service. At      
 Christmas members go carol singing.   </content>
