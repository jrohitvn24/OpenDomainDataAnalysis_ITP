		<title>01South Dalton Wold</title>
		<content> This Wold is an example of how the    
 relatively barren sheepwalks of the   
 Wolds were transformed by the great   
 land owners of the 18th &amp; 19th        
 centuries. The area would be rolling  
 arable Wold as are the extremities now
 but for the activities of the Aislabie
 &amp; Hotham families. Dalton Old Wood was
 so called in 1727 &amp; still contains a  
 proportion of Beech that were standing
 at that time though the bulk of the   
 remaining woodland is Victorian in    
 origin. Dalton Hall (block 8) is on   
 the new site &amp; was probably built     
 about 1740, modernised in 1870 &amp; then 
 reduced in 1956 to its present but    
 still massive brick symmetry. The old 
 Hall stood amongst ancient enclosures 
 which can still be picked out in the  
 later parkland to the East of the     
 present building.
