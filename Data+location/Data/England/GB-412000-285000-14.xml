		<content>By far the vast majority of houses in  
our area are terraced and              
semi-detached.Only very rarely did we  
find a detached house although there   
are bungalows. There are blocks of     
flats in the area but most of these    
are not very tall,each block being     
usually only three storeys high. There 
are also some maisonettes.             
Generally the houses seem to be in     
very good condition, while the flats   
are not. They suffer from rotting      
window frames,damp walls and doors     
which need repairs.In one part of the  
area the houses have survived much     
better than the flats although they    
all tend to be rented not owned.
