Young people walk, bicycle and horse-  
ride in surrounding fields and woods.  
Brownies, Girl Guides and Sunday School
groups flourish.   There is a summer   
play scheme to keep children occupied  
during the long five-week holiday from 
school.   Ladies can attend the        
monthly meetings of the local Women's  
Institute branch, or evening classes   
in pop-agility, needlecrafts or        
dressmaking held at the Primary School.
The Cricket Club is now defunct, but   
the men do still have a football club. 
The "Gresley Arms" public house, named 
after the Gresley family who owned     
mines in this area, provides another   
attraction.
