		<title>06SHOPS SERVING CLUN VALLEY</title>
		<content> Because of the nature of the area it  
 is neccessary to travel out of the    
 area to shop. There are several       
 centres which serve the community.    
 Within a ten mile radius there are    
 Craven Arms, Clun, Knighton and       
 Bishops Castle. Further afield Ludlow 
 and Church Stretton have markets.     
 Shrewsbury and Hereford are both      
 thirty or so miles away and are       
 patronized by the locals occasionally.
    Many people use private vehicles   
 for this purpose but there are also   
 bus services for those without cars,  
 though these don't help those from    
 remoter villages.                     
    For some people the answer to the  
 shopping problem is to take advantage 
 of shops that deliver. There are      
 regular deliveries from the Stores at 
 Clun and the Butcher will deliver     
 most days.                            </content>
