		<title>13Parish Hall (part one)</title>
		<content>   The Parish Hall was erected in 1922 
 and consists of two World War I ex-   
 army huts joined together. Additions  
 and improvements have since been made.
 It is at present  administered by     
 Trustees, but this system is now in a 
 process of change. The Hall is used as
 a meeting place for village           
 organisations, the activities of which
 are many and varied. The Playgroup,   
 which caters for pre_school children, 
 meets for three mornings per week     
 during the School term.  The Mother   
 and Toddler Group, which is pre_Play_ 
 group, meets on one afternoon a week. 
 The Over 60s Club meets monthly except
 during the summer. The Women's        
 Institute uses the Hall on the first  
 Wednesday of every month, and also on 
 other occasions. This organisation has
 been using the Hall continuously since
 its erection in 1922.                 </content>
