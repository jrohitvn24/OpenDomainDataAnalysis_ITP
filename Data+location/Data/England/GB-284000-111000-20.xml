		<title>20HISTORY OF CRUWYS MORCHARD</title>
		<content> Cruwys Morchard means the cross or    
 cross-way in the great wood or 'mor   
 ket' which stretched between Exmoor   
 and Dartmoor. The manor was held by   
 Almar before 1066, since 1175 by the  
 Cruwys family. The other Domesday     
 manor in the area is Ruckham.         
 Many of the farms are of medieval     
 origin but local research shows that  
 farm boundaries have changed through  
 time. Farms have always been worked as
 units, not held in common.            
 The hamlet of Pennymoor was first     
 mentioned in the 17c. The earliest    
 stonework in the Church of the Holy   
 Cross is 14c, but rectors are recorded
 from 1261. The main walls are 16c     
 Decorated Gothic but the interior and 
 part of the tower were renewed after  
 lightning hit the spire in 1689. Many 
 farms have named pews in the church.
