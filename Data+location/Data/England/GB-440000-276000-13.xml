		<content>   During the winter months the cows   
 are kept in an enclosed area. It is   
 completely self-contained,the cows are
 allowed to wander around. One of the  
 places they visit is the silage racks 
 which are in a room under a shelter.  
 The cows prefer the silage to hay,    
 which is also fed to them from racks. 
 The third type of food fed to the cows
 is called cake.                       
     {*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *    
   As there are fifty-five cows,you can
 imagine how much slurry there is. It  
 gets put into a big tank and when the 
 tank is full, the slurry gets pumped  
 into a tanker that sprays slurry out  
 onto the fields.The cows sleep in a   
 large sheltered area. The stalls are  
 just tiny cubicals separated by iron  
 poles. There is just enough room for  
 the cows to sleep.
