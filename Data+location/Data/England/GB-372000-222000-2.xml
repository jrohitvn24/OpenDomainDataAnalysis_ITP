		<content> LOCAL HOUSING                         
 This area of Gloucestershire is very  
 rural. Housing is mainly along the    
 country roads,fronting onto the road. 
 The houses are mostly detached        
 dwellings although there are some     
 semi-detached and there is one row of 
 terraced houses. The materials used   
 for building are mainly brick although
 some have been rendered. Roofs are    
 built of a variety of materials,      
 slates, clay tiles and concrete tiles.
 Most houses in the locality are       
 privately owned with just a few       
 council owned properties. Most houses 
 have quite large gardens, one-third of
 an acre and upwards and most are well 
 kept indicating that gardening is a   
 predominant hobby in the area. Because
 the area is so rural there is not a   
 lot of demand for new housing and     
 there is no new housing being built.  </content>
