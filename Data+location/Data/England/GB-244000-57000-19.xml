		<content>{The gravestones vary in what they are 
 made of.Some are ordinary stone,while 
 others are of marble or granite.There 
 are many different styles of grave_   
 stone _ hearts,crosses,books, scrolls,
 and elaborate arches.Some headstones  
 even have pictures of the people who  
 have died on them.The older Victorian 
 gravestones are rather delapidated in 
 appearance,and are larger and more    
 ornate than modern_day stones.The     
 verses on them are longer and more    
 sentimental than the ones of today.   
{There are graves of service men dating
 back to the First World War. Amongst  
 these,are two headstones of Germans,  
 dated 1914 and 1915,on which are      
 symbols shaped like the German Iron   
 Cross.We assumed they were sailors    
 killed in action.The Second World War 
 graves include those of a Polish      
 aircrew.                              </content>
