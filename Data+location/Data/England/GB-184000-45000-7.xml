   Now a lot of people in Tresillian   
 work in Truro ,Tresillian has became a
 commuter village.                     
  There are a few small businessess in 
 Tresillian a farm and garden shop,a   
 small corner shop(which could soon    
 close because the owner wants to      
 retire),an antiques and piano shop ,a 
 garage (which sells petrol and carries
 out repairs),a small business making  
 electric fittings and a hair dressers.
 Some people who live on the main road 
 do a bed and breakfast which helps    
 supplement incomes.                   
  The Highway depot is the main        
 employer although there are also some 
 other places of work like the farms,  
 old people's home and another garage. </content>
