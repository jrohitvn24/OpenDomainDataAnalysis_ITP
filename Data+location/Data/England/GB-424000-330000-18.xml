		<title>18THE OLD MILL,HILTON</title>
		<content> In 1085 there were two mills in Hilton
 One was probably on the site of the   
 present mill.Throughout the 19th Cent.
 it was operating as a corn mill-      
 grinding corn and making dog biscuits.
 The mill closed down in the 1930's and
 after the water wheels were removed   
 during World War Two, it stood empty  
 for over 40 years.It is now in use    
 again as a manufacturing establishment
 A local business man reopened it in   
 December 1980 after massive repairs   
 and cleaning up. Now after 4 and a    
 half years the firm employs 7 people  
 fulltime and 12 others part time, as  
 well as using outworkers producing    
 display equipment, wireformed goods   
 and printing balloons. Instead of     
 being left to decay the mill is now   
 proving to be a local source of       
 industry and is providing jobs for    
 local people.                         </content>
