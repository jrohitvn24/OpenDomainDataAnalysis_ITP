		<content>    The Mendip Hills are virtually made
 entirely of limestone. Limestone is   
 made up of mainly calcite but all     
 limestones contain a small proportion 
 of quartz, clay and other minerals.   
 The calcite probably derived from     
 coral or algae millions of years ago  
 but possibly also from sea shells.    
 Layers of flint nodules and pyrite    
 crystals can be found in all          
 limestone.                            
    The colour of the stone varies from
 white to  yellow or green to red  if  
 the limestone contains iron. Grey and 
 black limestone occurs from time to   
 time if the rock contains a large     
 amount of plant material.             
    Fossils are frequently found in the
 limestone on the Mendips. Ammonite    
 fossils  are often found but fossils  
 of other brachiopods such as cockles  
 and mussels are also common.          </content>
