 In the morning I get up about 7.30.   
 I have breakfast with my Mum,Dad and  
 my brother.I have toast with Marmite  
 for breakfast.I leave home for school 
 at about 8.45 am.                     
    School starts at 9.o'clock .My     
 favourite kind of work is writing     
 stories.At play-time I play with my   
 friend Philip.I have school dinners.  
 Some of the foods are dehydrated,     
 such as peas,but we have fresh        
 salads,vegetables and fruit.I leave   
 school at 3.30 pm.                    
    When I get home I usually go up in 
 my bedroom and have a rest,but        
 sometimes I go out and play games     
 such as cricket, or I ride my bicycle.
 I have my tea at about 5.o'clock. In  
 the evening I watch TV.My favourite   
 programme is "V".I go to bed at about 
 9.o'clock.                            </content>
