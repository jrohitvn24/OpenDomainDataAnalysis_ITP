		<title>01COUNTRYSIDE SOUTH OF DALSTON</title>
		<content>   Our area ranges from Bridge End,    
 Dalston, in the north to Rose Castle  
 in the south, and from Raughton in the
 east to Hawkesdale in the west. It is 
 mainly country land with a few hamlets
 dotted around.                        
   These hamlets include Hawksdale,    
 Unthank, Raughton and Gaitsgill (or   
 Gatesgill). The land is rolling and   
 mainly used for pasture. There are    
 many woods and the River Roe joins the
 River Caldew half a mile west of      
 Raughton. There are small, narrow     
 roads which join up each hamlet. There
 is one "B" road, the B5299.           
   There is little industry in the area
 but at Bridge End, Dalston, there is a
 fairly large cotton wool factory. In  
 the centre of our area, there is      
 Lime House School. South-west of that 
 is Rose Castle, where the Bishop of   
 Carlisle lives.                       </content>
