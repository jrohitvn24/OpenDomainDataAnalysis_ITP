		<content> FARMING. The main land use is for     
 stock farming though all farmers grow 
 some or all of the required feed in   
 the form of hay, silage, roots and    
 winter kale. Stock is a mixture of    
 cattle and sheep. There is a small    
 dairy herd in Clunton. Animals are    
 marketed locally in Craven Arms,      
 Ludlow, Knighton and even further     
 afield in other market towns.         
 FORESTRY. There is a large amount of  
 woodland in the area which is mainly  
 Forestry Commision land.              
 PLANTING. Two year old trees are      
 planted each year to maintain stock.  
 WEEDING. After four years, trees are  
 weeded using a brushing hook. They are
 then left 20 years until ready for    
 thinning.                             
 FELLING. Mature firs are felled for   
 export and home use.
