		<content>{A Survey of Children's Hobbies}       
 We surveyed eighty children aged      
 between eight and nine years of       
 age.                                  
 The eight to nine year olds didn't    
 have many studious hobbies.Only one of
 those surveyed played a musical       
 instrument! This was an organ.        
 We found that many children had more  
 than one hobby. Boys seemed to do     
 more energetic things such as football
 and judo, while a lot of girls go to  
 clubs like Brownies and dancing       
 classes.                              
 A lot of children aged between        
 thirteen and fourteen years played    
 ball games or went to discos. Again,  
 none of them did studious things. Not 
 one played a musical instrument.      
 Since many of our friends play musical
 instruments we realise our survey was 
 not large enough to be accurate.      </content>
