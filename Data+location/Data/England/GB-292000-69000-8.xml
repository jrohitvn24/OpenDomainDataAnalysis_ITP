		<content>11.If you could change, build or add on
to your business what would you do?    
  I  would like to open 2 discos to    
cater for all age groups. I would like 
to keep open all year round.           
12.Do you see the business expanding?  
  Only in a limited way as there are   
fears that buildings would break the   
skyline.                               
I3.Do you employ local people or       
outsides on your staff?                
  We employ only local people and 95%  
of them worked here last year.         
14.Do you think the area benefits from 
having your business in it?            
  Yes I think it does because local    
rates for residents would go up.       
15.Do you enjoy your job?              
  Yes, even though I work 96 hours a   
week and I have had no day off since   
Easter. During winter I decorate the   
camp and go on training courses.       </content>
