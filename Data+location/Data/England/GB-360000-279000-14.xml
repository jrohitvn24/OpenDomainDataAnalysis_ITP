		<content>{FOR.}" There is a BMX bike course on  
 our common," says Paul. "The second   
 bump is the best because of the stone 
 but if you land wrong you go into the 
 ferns and usually fall off. It's best 
 to go down the first bump on your back

 of 21 children think that motor bikes 
 and BMX cycles are dangerous and      
 should be banned. Two boys at school  
 recently had an accident on the way   
 home. One boys pedal was bent and the 
 other boy cracked off half a tooth.

 BMXs spoil the common land and scare  
 the sheep, cows, donkeys and horses.
