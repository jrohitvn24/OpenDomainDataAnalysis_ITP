		<title>13MINERS STRIKE</title>
		<content> During the pit strike my dad was      
 working every day. He went to work,   
 you can be sure there were pickets    
 there.They were always shouting scab  
 and throwing things at the car. My mum
 and dad were getting tired of the pit 
 strike. The strike was on the         
 television everyda It was getting     
 boring; bulletins about people being  
 injured in the streets, people falling
 out and beating each other up and     
 calling each other names. This is what
 happens during the strike: my mother  
 got up when my dad went to work, my   
 dad told my mother to keep a stick    
 with her. We got phone calls from     
 striking miners threatening us and my 
 mum told me to keep a look out for    
 strikers' vans and I was told that if 
 anyone asked me what my dad did I was 
 to say he was a butcher and then walk 
 away.                                 </content>
