		<title>19HULL GRAMMAR SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>{Hull Grammar School}is Hull's oldest  
 school and for several centuries it   
 was its only permanently established  
 school. The earliest indications of   
 its existence occur in{1347}and the   
 15th century town records show that it
 was then sponsored and controlled by  
 the corporation. In{1479}it was       
 endowed in connection with a chantry  
 in Holy Trinity Church by the Bishop  
 of Worcester and it occupied a        
 building near the churchyard. A new   
 schoolhouse, which still exists, was  
 built there in{1583.}In{1878}the      
 school was moved to temporary premises
 in Baker Street and then to Leicester 
 Street in{1892.}In{1945}control passed
 to the new L.E.A. and the school was  
 rehoused in Bricknell Avenue in{1953.}
 Under the plans for reorganisation the
 school will become an 11-16           
 comprehensive.                        </content>
