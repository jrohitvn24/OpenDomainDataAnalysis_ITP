		<content> I live in a house in Sparrowpit.It is 
 made of limestone and has a large     
 barn attached. The village has a pub  
 called the Wanted Inn which sells     
 alcohol and snacks.                   
 The daily bus service is the only     
 public transport but most people have 
 a car.                                
 There is a Methodist Chapel,a village 
 hall where dances are held,a small    
 play area with swings,a telephone box 
 and a post box.                       
 We own about two hundred acres we have
 four David Brown tractors and a Zetor 
 plus a Supa Dexter.We have a hundred  
 milk cows,eighty sheep as well as a   
 few ducks and goats.                  
 I expect to be a farmer when I leave  
 school at sixteen.
