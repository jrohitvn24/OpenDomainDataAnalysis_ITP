		<content> One craft that is probably unique to  
 Earls Colne are sooty plates.{Ray Wood
 is a local artist and owns a shop     
 named{Arty Crafty.}                   
         Ray holds white plate over a  
 flame on a candle which makes it black
 with soot then Ray  scratches out a   
 picture. If he happens to make a      
 mistake he just soots it over again.  
 Of course,like water pastel,it smudges
 so Ray pours varnish over it. Some of 
 the pictures that Ray Wood has done   
 are of an Indian and one of Dick      
 Joise,which worked out a bit funny for
 one cannot copy someone else moving   
 about on T.V.He has also made a plate 
 advertising the shop.                 
         Ray Wood has been on T.V.     
 doing this.
