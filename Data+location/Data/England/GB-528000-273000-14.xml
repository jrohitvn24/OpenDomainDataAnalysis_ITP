		<title>14Menus of a N.St Ives family</title>
		<content> I am probably a member of a typical   
 St Ives family.I am going to tell you 
 about the meals my family eats on a   
 typical day.                          
 My family usually has cereal and      
 toast for breakfast.For our breakfast 
 drink we usually have a cup of tea.At 
 lunch we sometimes have cheese on     
 toast or spaghetti on toast.After     
 that we have fruit or cake.And we have
 fruit juice or tea.                   
 For our tea on a typical day we have  
 any sort of meat,potatoes or chips and
 any sort of 2 vegetables. For pudding 
 we have fruit and cream or ice        
 cream.For our drink we have tea or    
 coffee.Sometimes we do not have a     
 pudding.If we have a snack we have a  
 packet of crisps or a bar of          
 chocolate.
