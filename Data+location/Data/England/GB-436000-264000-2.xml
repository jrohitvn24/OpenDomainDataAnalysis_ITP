		<title>02ECOLOGY-LAND E. OFFCHURCH.</title>
		<content>   The land{E. of Offchurch}is composed
 of rolling arable{farmland}with five  
 small{woodlands, a canal, disused     
{railway and some ponds.}The landscape 
 has changed in recent years, though   
 still leafy, as many hedges have been 
 uprooted, enlarging fields, for easier
 access by modern farming machinery.   
{  Dutch Elm disease}has wiped out many
 elm trees and ponds have dried out as 
 water is piped for irrigation.        
   However{wildlife}has found havens in
 the disused railway, the canals and   
 roadside verges, which are left uncut 
 except on edges. Many farmers have    
 replaced dead elms and are planting   
 new woodland areas. One farm reservoir
 is being constructed.                 
{  Wild plants}seen include Horsetail, 
 Ox_eye Daisy, Jack by the Hedge, White
 Campion, Black Medick , Red and White 
 Clover, Cowslip, Plantain and Vetch.  </content>
