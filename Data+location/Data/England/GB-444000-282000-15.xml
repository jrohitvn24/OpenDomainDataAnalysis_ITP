		<title>15Mrs.Lowe of Monks Kirby</title>
		<content> Mrs.Lowe has lived in Monks Kirby for 
 51 years now and would never move.The 
 house she is in is her third house    
 here and she said that she would      
 rather be down in the village with the
 people she knows.If she had to move   
 she said she would move near Rugby    
 with her daughters.When she came here 
 there were no council houses here     
 at all.She has a dog to keep her      
 company called Jane.She used to live  
 in Church Lawford and got married     
 there.When girls used to board at the 
 Convent she used to go and iron the   
 dresses there.When she moved here the 
 bus used to cost 7p return and they   
 were very different to what they are  
 now.She told us that there used to be 
 a chapel down Bell Lane and said that 
 Monks Kirby has definitely changed for
 the better.
