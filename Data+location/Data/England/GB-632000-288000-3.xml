		<title>03FREE TIME SURVEY IN BUNGAY.</title>
		<content>Following a survey of how people spend 
their leisure time we discovered that  
the majority of activities are         
undertaken in Bungay,the most popular  
of these being visiting friends and    
drinking.Many people enjoy home-based  
activities such as watching television,
reading and gardening.Some people      
travel outside Bungay for swimming.It  
was felt that Bungay needs a swimming  
pool.Generally it was thought there was
enough to do for young people.Most     
people asked,thought that old people   
interests were taken notice of.        
Bungay Sports Hall was added to Bungay 
High School in 1979.Basketball,soccer  
and cricket are a few activities which 
are played there.Several clubs use the 
hall in the evening and at weekends    
including the Black dog Badminton and  
Running clubs.                         
                                       </content>
