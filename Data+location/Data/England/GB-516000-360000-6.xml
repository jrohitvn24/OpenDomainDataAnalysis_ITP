		<content>{POPULATION WOODHALL SPA               
  There have been several changes in   
 the population of W.Spa where borings 
 which were originally for coal began  
 in 1811 at Woodhall.The Spa came later
 when a small bath house was built.In  
 those years it was said that the      
 floating population of visitors       
 exceeded the number of permanent      
 residents.In 1901 the amount of people
 (excluding visitors) had grown to 988,
 by 1911 1,484 and in 1921 1,635, in   
 1961 the figure was 2,261,by 1971 down
 to 1970 with 170 more women than men, 
 and in 1979 2,445.Facilities for      
 rheumatism sufferers brought visitors 
 and jobs.By the mid 60s the fashion   
 for Spa treatment had ebbed.There is  
 a growing population of nursing home  
 inmates giving W.Spa one of the       
 highest ratios of geriatrics.The      
 population of Woodhall is Caucasian.  </content>
