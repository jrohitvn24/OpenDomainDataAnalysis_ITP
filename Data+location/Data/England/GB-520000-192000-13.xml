		<content> HOUSING IN GRID SQUARE 6              
 Our area is typically suburban.The    
 only old property is near the Rising  
 Sun pub on Highwood Hill and the old  
 farmhouse on what is now Mill Hill    
 Golf Course.There are a  few very     
 large mansions especially on Highwood 
 Hill and in Nan Clark's Lane.         
 Between the wars the area was         
 developed as a result of the          
 construction of the Barnet Bypass(A1) 
 and the extension of the underground  
 lines to Mill Hill and Edgware.These  
 houses are predominantly              
 semi-detached.                        
 Since the war the area has seen the   
 building of the Council Estate        
 (Bedford Road,Ramillies Road and      
 Norbury Grove) which led directly to  
 the buildind of Courtland School and  
 Moat Mount School(now Mill Hill County
 High School).                         </content>
