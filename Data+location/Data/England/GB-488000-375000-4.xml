		<content> Saxilby originally developed along the
 High Street, up Church Road  and  down
 Mill  Lane forming a reversed D shape,
 rising gently to  the  ancient  parish
 church  of  St  Botolph.  The  rebuilt
 tower (1907) and 6 bells abut  a  fine
 clerestoried  nave,  double chancel of
 the  perpendicular  style  (c.1350   -
 1500) and a north aisle dating back to
 early  Norman (c.1100). From the tower
 one can see north east  across  fields
 to  Broxholme, north west to the light
 industrial  units  on  Church  Lane  (
 making  staircases,  metal  spares and
 poultry grit ) and  south  across  the
 village  to  the  Lincoln to Sheffield
 railway line, still in use, as are the
 platforms, but the once  fine  station
 building   incorporating  the  station
 master's house (c.1849) and later 19th
 century additions, stands partly empty
 and in decay.                         </content>
