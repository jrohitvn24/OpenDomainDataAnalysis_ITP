		<content>A LARGE AND A SMALL FARM               
One of the larger farms in the area is 
some310 acres,with some100 British     
Friesian cows.                         
Home grown silage,hay and bought in    
concentrates are fed to the dairy cows 
in winter.Calving is all year round and
the farm has a Charolais and Hereford  
bull. 100 hens are also kept to augment
the income, after the introduction of  
EEC milk quotas.                       
In comparison a smaller farm in the    
area owns 20 acres and rents 15        
acres.It has 20 milking cows and       
followe and boith buys and breeds herd 
replacements.A yield of 4,500 litres of
milk per cow per year is expected and  
all feed is home grown, although it is 
not always possible each year to       
achieve this.Concentrates are bought   
in.                                    
16 turkeys are fattened each year.     </content>
