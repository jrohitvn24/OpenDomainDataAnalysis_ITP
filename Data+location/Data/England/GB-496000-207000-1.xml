Berkhamted is a small town which is    
situated some 30 miles to the          
north of London. The once forested     
Chiltern hillsde now overlooks the     
important communictions links of the   
A41 road from London to Birkenhead and 
the railway from London Euston to      
Birmingham and the north of England.   
                                       
Farming, service and light industry    
are characteristic local occupations.  
However, a large number of people      
travel a fair distance to work each    
day. Local history can be traced back  
to the Romans and William the Conqueror
actually visited Berkhamsted. While    
there are many old buildings in the    
town, a high percentage of offices and 
and houses have been built since 1944  
and a large number of small computer   
firms are now based in the town.       </content>
