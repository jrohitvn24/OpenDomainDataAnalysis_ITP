		<content> There are three churches each of them 
 follow the Christian faith.           
{St. Luke's}is Church of England.  It  
 is in the centre of the village and is
 the oldest building.  A gallery was   
 built in 1705 by Thomas Hall.  The    
 church holds 260 people.  The largest 
 stain glass window was put in about   
 1925 as a war memorial.  Woodworm is a
 great problem.  No one has been buried
 in the churchyard this century.  There
 are seven bells in the tower but only 
 six are used.  They are all keyed in  
 to F#.  There is an organ.  The vicar 
 enjoys his work and has been doing his
 job for 34 years.  Every Sunday about 
 Â£220 is collected.  A new church hall 
 is being built.  It is costing        
 Â£86,000.  Services on Sunday are:     
 Communion, Sunday School, Matins and  
 Evensong.  During the week: Prayer    
 meetings, Bible studies, etc.         </content>
