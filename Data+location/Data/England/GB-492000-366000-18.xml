		<title>18TRANSPORT NORTH HYKEHAM</title>
		<content> There are three types of transport in 
 our 'D' block.There are trains,taxis  
 and buses,as well as private cars and 
 cycles.                               
 The types of trains that come through 
 are diesels,tankers and high speed    
 trains(mainly on Sunday,when  the     
 main line is closed for track works). 
 The main roads e.g. the A46 and the   
 A15 are very busy.There are some train
 tracks which have been taken up.      
  There is a British Rail station      
 in North Hykeham where local diesel   
 trains stop on the route from         
 Nottingham to Lincoln.The nearest     
 large station is Lincoln.There are    
 National Road Car service buses and   
 Lincoln Corporation.Birds Coaches are 
 a long established local firm who     
 undertake private hire and take       
 children to school from around.
