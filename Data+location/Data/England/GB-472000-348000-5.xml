		<content> After a campaign to keep it open the  
{Church of England}primary school was  
 closed in 1984, in spite of the fact  
 that a new school had been built      
 during the expansionary period of the 
 sixties. The 20 pupils now travel by  
 special bus to{Elston.}Attempts are   
 being made to sell the old school     
 building for light industrial use.    
   There is an hourly bus service to   
{Newark}and{Nottingham}and 5 buses a   
 day to{Bingham.}There is one telephone
 box, but no Post Office or shop. This 
 necessitates travelling to{Newark}for 
 shopping. There is one public house   
 called the Pauncefote Arms which      
 serves bar snacks and meals and has   
 a skittle alley. The C. of E.{Church  
{of St Oswald}is 1/2 mile west of the  
 village adjacent to the privately     
 owned Stoke Hall.
