		<content>{Recreation:Victoria Park Grounds  }   
    Victoria Park opened in 1901. The  
 Park is 25 acres in size.There are    
 only nine gardeners to look after the 
 Park.When the flowers have been dug   
 up,the gardeners  dispose of them.    
 They cut the grass whenever necessary.
 The flowers are changed twice a year, 
 in the autumn and in the summer. The  
 Park Superintendent tells the         
 gardeners what to plant.              
    The whole of the  south Sefton area
 is supplied with flowers from the     
 greenhouses at the Park.When the Queen
 visited Southport,the station was     
 decorated with plants from here.Most  
 of the plants are grown from seed.The 
 greenhouses used to be heated by solid
 fuel,then oil and now they use        
 gas.Aliquid called "Summer Cloud" is  
 painted on the greenhouses to protect 
 the plants.                           </content>
