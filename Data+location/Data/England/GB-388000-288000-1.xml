		<content>{Kingswinford}in 1985 is a bustling    
 overgrown village on the edge of the  
 West Midlands conurbation. It has many
 shops but people still visit the      
 larger nearby towns for much of their 
 shopping.                             
 It is a pleasant place to live but has
 its fair share of jobless particularly
 amongst the young.                    
 There are still many signs of former  
 heavy industry in the area affecting  
 the landscape. Brickworks are still in
 use but coalmining and steelmaking    
 have died out leaving derelict land on
 which houses are being built.         
 The area does not have many amenities 
 but good entertainment and sport are  
 available close by or on television.  
 The older areas have more amenities   
 than the new housing estates where it 
 is assumed that people have their own 
 cars.                                 </content>
