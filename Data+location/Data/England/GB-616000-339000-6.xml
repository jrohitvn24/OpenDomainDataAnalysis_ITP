		<title>06AN AYLMERTON SCHOOLBOY'S DAY</title>
		<content>  I usually get up and wash at 7.30a.m.
 then go downstairs and have breakfast,
 which is usually cornflakes.  I get   
 dressed at about 7.50a.m., and leave  
 for{school}at about 8.15a.m.          
  Registration at school is at 8.30a.m.
 and{lessons}start at 8.40a.m.  School 
 finishes at 1.00p.m. because of the   
 teachers' dispute (school would       
 normally finish at 3.30p.m.).  When I 
 get home, I have a sandwich and do my 
{homework. }Then, if the weather is    
 fine, I go out on my cycle.           
  Aylmerton lies in the catchment area 
 of Cromer High School, but I prefer to
 go to Sheringham High School.         
  From 4p.m., to about 5.30p.m., I     
 watch television, and then have a     
 cooked meal.  Afterwards, I usually   
 make use of my{computer,}eventually   
 going to bed between 9p.m. and        
 10.30p.m.                             </content>
