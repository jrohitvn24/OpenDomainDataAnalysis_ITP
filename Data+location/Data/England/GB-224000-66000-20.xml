 world mining, and made{Caradon Hill   
 rich and famous.                      
    The{Liskeard and Caradon Railway   
{Act}was granted on{26th June,1843.    
 Money was collected and the line was  
 laid at a cost of Â£27,000.            
    Waggons of ore descended by gravity
 and returned pulled by horses, then at
 a later date, by locomotives. The line
 from Caradon passed through Polwrath, 
 St. Cleer and Tremabe to Moorswater.  
 There were no tunnels, only bridges   
 and cuttings. The track may still be  
 followed for part of the way.         
  In a year about{7,000 tons of copper 
 and{8,000 tons of granite}descended,  
 and{1,600 tons of coal, iron and wood 
 ascended the line. In 1859 there were 
 27 employees-14 brakesmen,5 labourers,
 2 platelayers,a secretary, treasurer, 
 foreman and a policeman.              </content>
