		<title>08INGOLDSBY SOCIAL CLUB</title>
		<content> We have a social club in  Ingoldsby   
 where you can buy drinks and it is    
 also used for parties meetings etc.   
      When it is bonfire night we all  
 go to the club and there is a big     
 bonfire and fireworks behind the club 
 building on the playing field.        
                                       
 There are some swings, a slide and a  
 playrocking horse, so if you have a   
 little child you can have a drink and 
 your child can have a play. There is a
 snooker table, a darts board and other
 games to play in the club. They also  
 hold Bingo there to raise funds for   
 the cricket and football clubs.       
          There  are also some benches 
 so you can sit down. If you have a dog
 there is plenty of room for it to run 
 about. There are also some tennis     
 courts, a football pitch and a cricker
 pitch.                                </content>
