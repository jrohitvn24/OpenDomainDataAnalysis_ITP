		<title>03Use of houses in Grindon</title>
		<content>     In Grindon we counted eighteen    
private houses, six council houses,    
eleven farm houses, seven holiday      
homes, two cafesin houses, one bed and 
breakfast place, one pub, one village  
hall and one art and craft shop.       
     In the gift shop are pictures,    
sweets, flowers, books, glasses,       
candles, pots, apples and other things 
which tourists can buy for souvenirs.  
     A vicar built the little cottage  
which houses the shop and he lived     
there for a while.  Then he heard      
about a man who lived rough in the     
forest, so the vicar moved out of the  
little cottage and he put the old man  
in the little cottage. After the old   
man died someone purchased his cottage 
and named it Rock Cottage after the    
old man, who's name was Rock.  The     
present owner of Rock Cottage is Betty 
Osscroft.                              </content>
