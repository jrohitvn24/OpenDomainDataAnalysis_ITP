		<content> Wirral Social Services  Dept. gave the
 money to  buy recording equipment. But
 the running cost  is  about  Â£3800 per
 year which must be  raised themselves.
 They collect the  money  by  sponsored
 walks ,reads and  spells. People  help
 because they  may know  someone who is
 blind.                                
   Besides the  news  items  there is a
 part of the tape used for  a  magazine
 of  advertisements . The  editor  get 
 tapes  delivered  to  the  blind  by  
 putting them  in  yellow  packets  and
 taking them  to  the main Post Office.
   When  tapes  are  returned  by blind
 people,they are checked.If any have an
 elastic band on it means  a message is
 on it commenting  on the tape  quality
 or with suggestions.                  
   All the technicians, readers and the
 editors are volunteers. We  thought it
 was a great sevice.                   </content>
