		<title>05THE GOINGS ON IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content> Our area has garden centres such as   
 Milton Hutchings and Packetboat       
 Nurseries. The area is mostly         
 residential. For leisure there is a   
 youth club. It has a hall which has   
 different things on each night,for    
 instance there are discos for the     
 older generation as well as the young.
 Opposite the youth club there is The  
 Irish Club where you can enjoy Irish  
 music and dancing.                    
   Opposite Birch Avenue modern flats  
 are being demolished because they were
 badly built. It is possible that the  
 site of the flats will be used to     
 create new leisure facilities,but at  
 present the land is derelict.Opposite 
 Pield Heath School is the River Pinn  
 which is used by local fishing        
 enthusiasts.
