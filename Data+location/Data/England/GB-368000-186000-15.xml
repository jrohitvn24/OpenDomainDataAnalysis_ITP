		<content>{There is a church}in Rangeworthy      
 called Holy Trinity. This is in the   
 parish of Rangeworthy which is now    
 joined to the parish of Wickwar. The  
 Rector of Wickwar looks after both    
 parishes and has a Curate.            
{There follows a summary of the work of
{a clergyman}in the Church of England  
 as described to us by the Curate.     
{The most important part of a priest's 
{work}is to meet the spiritual needs of
 the people and spread the message of  
 Christianity. The priest takes        
 services, visits sick people and those
 in hospital and he gives teaching     
 about the Church to all age groups.   
{The training of a priest}takes 4 years
 and involves studying the Old and New 
 Testaments, Doctrine and Liturgies. At
 present, only men can become priests  
 in the Church of England.
