		<title>11Housing in Leicester</title>
		<content>{Leicester,}as a major urban mass,     
 contains a wide variety of residential
 buildings. The City Centre's housing  
 is dominated by a high proportion of{ 
{Victorian terraces}along with the more
 recent up-market high-rise{tower      
{blocks.}Further westwards the land    
 contains more varied types of building
 the area being more suburban, with{   
{semi-detached}and{detached houses}of  
 mixed ages; spanning the years{       
{1911-84. }                            
 On the periphery there are numerous{  
{council estates,}which date from the{ 
{1920's,}and beyond these higher class 
 residential suburbs, both of which    
 grew up as a reaction to the cramped  
 inner-city conditions; according to   
 the{Garden City Movement of the 20's.}
 The latter housing developments differ
 from the earlier buildings in their{  
{architecture}and{street patterns.     </content>
