		<content> On the site of the Industrial Estate  
 there used to be a railway carriage   
 works established in 1913 by L.B.&amp; S.C
 railways.We interviewed Mr.and Mrs R.A
 Walker who both worked there.         
 There were up to 2000 workers at the  
 site with muth of the residential area
 being built for its employees.The work
 carried out was the repair and        
 construction of passenger carriage    
 stock for the southern railway.It was 
 later used by B.R. when the railways  
 were nationalised the works were used 
 for the standardisation of            
 carriages.Theworks were shut in June  
 1965.Notice of closure was given 3    
 years in advance.Athough their        
 was plenty of employment in the aera  
 by the time the works closed.Men who  
 had worked their all their lives found
 it hard to get jobs,and one man       
 committed suicide.                    </content>
