		<title>12POULTON HALL I</title>
		<content> Poulton Hall has been the home of     
 the Lancelyn family   since the       
 Eleventh Century. They built some kind
 of castle at the highest point in the 
 area near the present Poulton Hall;   
 the original earthworks can still be  
 seen. The Hall was built about 1685   
 and has been greatly altered and      
 enlarged over the years. It is        
 L_shaped in plan with pebble_dashed   
 rendering. Poulton Hall has one small 
 room on the top floor, which has been 
 set aside to the memory of Sherlock   
 Holmes. This is a remarkable          
 reconstruction of 221B Baker Street,  
 London, where the fictional Holmes    
 lived. The room was faithfully        
 furnished by the Lancelyn_Green's     
 younger son, Richard, when he was only
 13.
