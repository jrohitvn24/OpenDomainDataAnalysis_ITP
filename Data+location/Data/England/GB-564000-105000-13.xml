		<title>13Farming on the Marshes</title>
		<content> There are few farms on the marshes,and
 most of these are situated to the west
 of our rectangle.We discovered that   
 the farms main speciality is cattle.  
 They are a mixture between beef and   
 dairy cows.The land is perfect for    
 their eating qualities as the grass is
 soft,rich, yet firm.The farmers grow  
 very little of crops such as barley or
 wheat, instead they prefer to         
 concentrate on growing grasses.These  
 grasses are good quality, therefore   
 the farmers feed it to the cows.There 
 are many water channels and passages  
 on the Pevensey Levels, they form the 
 divisions between the fields.One last 
 point is that many fields are owned by
 farmers who may live some miles away, 
 not all fields are owned by the farms 
 nearest them.
