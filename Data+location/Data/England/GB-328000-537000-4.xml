		<content> Livestock rearing dominates the area. 
 Farmland is mostly permanent pasture, 
 with 12 acres of barley. Eight suckler
 herds produce beef calves; seven farms
 produce milk from Friesian cows,      
 collected daily by tanker. Milk quotas
 were started in 1984. Government      
 compensatory allowances are paid on   
 suckler cows and hill sheep. Two farms
 let for summer grazing. One farm rears
 20,000 broiler chicks from day-old to 
 43 days. All farms have one or more   
 tractors. Two now have round balers.  
 In summer 1985 when heavy rain for 2  
 months prevented normal haymaking the 
 grass was salvaged and made big bale  
 silage. Farmers have grazing rights on
 the fells and commons: 4 sheep per    
 unit (1 acre); 1 cow per unit and 1   
 pony per 8 units. The commons are     
 owned by the Lake District Special    
 Planning Board.                       </content>
