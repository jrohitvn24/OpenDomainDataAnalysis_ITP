		<content> This is a day in the home life of my  
 family,on a Saturday. My dad goes to  
 work about 8.30am and goes to         
 Loughborough. My mum goes down to     
 Melton on the 9.30am bus to do the    
 shopping and comes back about 10.30am.
 My two brothers go to their friends'  
 house.My sister goes to her friend's  
 house as well. I go to Melton to my   
 friend's house who lives on Burton    
 Road. Then we both go down to Melton  
 Market. My dad comes home for his     
 dinner about 2.00pm. My sister and    
 brothers come home about 4.00pm. Then 
 we have tea about 5.30pm.My dad comes 
 back about 7.30pm and has his tea.We  
 are normally out side on our bikes or 
 at our friend's house in the          
 village,then go and watch television.
