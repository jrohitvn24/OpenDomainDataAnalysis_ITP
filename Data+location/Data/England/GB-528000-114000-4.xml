		<content>  The Windmills Opportunity Playgroup  
 was established in 1984 to serve parts
 of Burgess Hill, Hassocks and         
 Hurstpierpoint. It caters for{children
{with special needs}which may vary from
 social deprivation to mental handicap.
 It meets at the Mill Road Clinic,     
 Burgess Hill. Most of the playgroup's 
 staff are volunteers, although it does
 employ one organiser. It is mainly    
 funded my local charities such as the 
 Burgess Hill and Hassocks Round Table 
 and the Inner Wheel. Some local       
 schools and playgroups have also      
 organised fund raising events for it. 
 This includes some pupils from        
 Downlands School. It receives a small 
 grant from the Social Services        
 Department and uses the Mill Road     
 Clinic free by courtesy of the        
 Mid_Downs Heath Authority.
