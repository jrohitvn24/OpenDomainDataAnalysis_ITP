		<title>14Riding-A Leisure Activity.</title>
		<content> In this area{horse riding is a popular
{hobby}though{it needs quite a lot of  
{money.}Most people have lessons at    
 one of the two{local stables}but a few
 may be lucky enough to have a pony of 
 their own. You have to wear special   
 clothes for riding;{jodhpurs; trousers
{with padded knee parts, boots with no 
{grips on the soles but with a little  
{heel and, most important of all, a    
{hard hat.                             
 Part of the jobs is helping to look   
 after horses.{Mucking out the stable  
{can be a very messy job but you}get   
 used to the smell after a while. The  
 people who work at the stables have to
 groom the horses, wash them,{sweep the
{yard and give the ponies and horses   
{food, hay and straw.}We think that    
 anyone who takes up horse riding      
 will enjoy it very much.
