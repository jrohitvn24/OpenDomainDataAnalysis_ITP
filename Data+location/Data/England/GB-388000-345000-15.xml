		<title>15EATON PARK HOUSING ESTATE</title>
		<content>Eaton Park Estate is shaped like a semi
-circle.It is surrounded by rough      
grazing land.It is on high ground and  
you can see Berry Hill Industrial      
Estate with the N.C.B offices near     
Botteslow Farm,you can see Hanley town 
too.There are a lot of fields around   
the estate and usually they put horses 
in them.Our school Eaton Park Primary  
School is on the edge of the estate by 
the main feeder road, with Berry Hill  
High School opposite.There are four    
local shops that serve the people      
including a newsagent,a general store, 
butchers/post office and a baby wear   
shop.                                  
                                       
My house is small having three bedrooms
and a bathroom upstairs,a lounge and   
kitchen downstairs.Outside there is a  
small garden as well as a garage where 
we keep our family car(Odette Warrilow)</content>
