		<content> After sixteen years of rapid develop- 
 ment under the Government backed New  
 Town Scheme, Peterborough in 1985 is a
 well established commercial and       
 industrial centre for the region. To  
 those leisure attractions which       
 existed before 1969 many more have    
 been added to serve the new population
 In 1973 the city council opened its   
 Tourist Information Centre to deal    
 with the few visitors who came, but by
 1984 they were dealing with over      
 70,000 enquiries per year. Now in 1985
 the city is getting geared up to      
 attract its share of the booming      
 national tourist business, a market   
 which is expanding at a time when the 
 industrial trend is going in the      
 opposite direction. A Peterborough    
 Tourism Council has been set up to    
 help local authorities and tourism    
 firms to attract still more visitors. </content>
