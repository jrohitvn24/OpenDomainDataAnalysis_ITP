		<content> The South Warwickshire Authority      
 administers two practices including 7 
{doctors.}They are helped by Health    
 Visitors, District Nurses, Social     
 Workers, Chiropodists, Speech         
 Therapists, Community Psychological   
 and Psychiatric nurses and Midwives.  
  The{hospitals}used by the practices  
 are the Warneford at Leamington,      
 Warwick (nearest casualty dept.),     
 Stratford and the Hornton at Banbury. 
 The Munro Devis Maternity Home is also
 used. The Little Thatch surgery       
 dispenses for the area as there are no
 pharmacies within 1 mile. There is a  
{dentist}in the village although a lot 
 of people travel out of the village   
 for treatment. Teeth, particularly    
 children's are generally healthy since
 the introduction of flouride into the 
 water supply in 1974.
