		<content>{MYTTON &amp; FITZ }_ FARMING              
   Mytton &amp; Fitz are both farming      
 communities.Mytton Farm owns 250      
 acres,most of which is used forgrowing
 hay,for the farmer to sell part of to 
 a nearby dairy cattle farmer.The      
 remainder is used to feed his 700 _   
 800 sheep.He also,grows fodder        
 beat.However,this has to be rotated   
 every 4 years and harvested in        
 Nov./Dec. Each field is about 20      
 acres.                                
   Sheep have devastated a lot of the  
 hadges.Small fields are difficult to  
 work on with modern farm machinery and
 the 6"pipe drainage system has been   
 replaced with 9"pipes.Before this,the 
 land was boggy and hard to manage in  
 June.4.9"of rainfall fell in this     
 area.
