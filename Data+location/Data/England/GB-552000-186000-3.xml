		<title>03MY HORNCHURCH HOME</title>
		<content>      My house is semi-detached. I have
 7 rooms in my house. I have           
 1 bathroom, 1 toilet, 3 bedrooms,     
 1 kitchen  and a combined living room 
 and dining room.   I would say that my
 house is about 20 years old(Ihave been
 there for about 9.5 years).           
      My garden is probably an average 
 size. At the bottom of my garden you  
 can see a stream that eventually runs 
 into the River Thames.                
      My house is green and white with 
 a red roof.   At the back of my house 
 I have got an extension where we keep 
 our outdoor toys and my mum and dad's 
 gardening tools.                      
      I think that my home is a nice   
 place to live because everything I    
 need is very near.   All our family of
 5 think we need a bigger house but we 
 all want to stay in this area.
