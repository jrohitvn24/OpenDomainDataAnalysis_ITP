		<content>The National Stud:  This was founded in
1915 and placed under the control of   
the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1963   
the responsibility for the stud was    
transferred, by agreement, to the      
Horserace Betting Levy Board. A year   
later they acquired a 999 year lease,  
on behalf of the stud, on Jockey Club  
land next to the July Course.          
Very clever planning by the National   
Stud Director has turned this farm     
land into one of the greatest studs    
in the world. It was officially        
opened by the Queen in 1967. The stud  
now consists of 190 mare and foal      
stables, 20 foaling stables and 6      
stallion stables. Also in the foaling  
unit are a small laboratory for the    
veterinary surgeon and a "sitting up"  
room for the grooms.
