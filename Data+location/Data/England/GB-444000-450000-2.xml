    Tockwith is the largest village in 
 our block and always has been. All    
 three villages have followed a similar
 pattern over the years.               
    In the 50's and 60's the population
 decreased as people moved into towns  
 to live near their work.              
    In the 70's and 80's the villages  
 increased in size, particularly       
 Tockwith, when new houses were built. 
    Most people chose this area to live
 in because they wanted to live in a   
 quiet, rural environment.             
    They are prepared to travel long   
 distances daily to work, usually by   
 car.                                  </content>
