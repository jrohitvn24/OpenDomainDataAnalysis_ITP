		<title>12Birds of the South Downs</title>
		<content>  Eric Tyler,Michelle Light and Stephen
 Ball all went onto the Downs near     
 Lewes Old Race Course to go bird      
 watching with Mrs Gibbons.When we got 
 there the first birds we saw were     
 Swallows.We saw many Swallows,Sky     
 Larks,Swifts and Sparrows.We only saw 
 one Collared dove and a few House     
 Martins. We also saw a Magpie,two     
 Crows,a Blackbird and two Yellow      
 Wagtails.                             
  There was one bird that made us all  
 jump.It was a partridge.It flew out of
 the long grass right in front of us,  
 but we only saw one of them.The bird  
 that wes really special for us was a  
 Yellow Hammer.It had a yellow brownish
 brest.We had not seen one before and  
 we only saw one all the time we were  
 looking.                              
  We observed the birds for one hour   
 using a book to identify them.        </content>
