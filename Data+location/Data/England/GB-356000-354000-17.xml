 both full and part-time staff in a    
 domestic capacity and to maintain     
 their grounds. Local youths are also  
 employed doing odd jobs and gardening.
 Our local services such as the Smithy

 employment with some part-time staff  
 to help. Local horse owners employ the
 youth of the area casuallyto ride out 
 and groom their mounts. Last,but no   
 means least, is our local hostelry,   
 which employs local residents         
 domestically and as bar staff and also
 serves as the workers meeting place   
 where gossip is exchanged. Generally  
 speaking, our small rural community is
 quite fortunate in it's employment    
 prospects embracing all age ranges and
 abilities.
