		<content>    The village of Morland, in the     
 county of Cumbria and the district of 
 Eden, is administered by a Parish     
 Council of seven elected people.      
    Mr.Willie Howarth is the chairman  
 and the clerk is the                  
 schoolmaster,Mr.Davison. The council  
 meet to run the village and solve any 
 problems that might come up.At the    
 moment there is a bad case of         
 pollution in the beck from some silage
 outflow. The council entered the      
 village for the Cumbria Best Kept     
 Village Competition and one year      
 Morland won it.We were very proud.The 
 certificate is in the village hall.   
 The Parish Council looks after        
 footpaths,bridle ways and open spaces 
 including the village playing field.  
 The money it uses comes from a tax    
 called the Rates and in Morland one   
 penny rate brings in Â£180.            </content>
