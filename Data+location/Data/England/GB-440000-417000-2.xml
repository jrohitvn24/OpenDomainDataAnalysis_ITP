 Nostell Priory is the home of the     
 Winn family. This magnificent         
 Palladian Mansion was given to the    
 National Trust in 1953. The present   
 house was built on the site of a      
 medieval priory. Work on the new      
 priory was begun in 1733 by James     
 Paine for Sir Rowland Winn.           
   The Priory houses one of Englands   
 finest collections of Chippendale     
 furniture.Its other treasures include 
 a famous portrait by Hans Holbein and 
 a remarkable Eighteenth Century dolls 
 house, complete with its orignal      
 fittings and furniture.               
   Set in open countryside the Priory  
 offers a wide variety of leisure      
 pursuits including camping, fishing   
 and general sightseeing.
