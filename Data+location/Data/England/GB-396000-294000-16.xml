		<title>16Tame Valley Canal.</title>
		<content>  In general a pleasant, well          
 maintained residential area containing
 both owner-occupied and council       
 property. Most streets have been      
 planted with trees, now mature.       
  Adding to the pleasantness of the    
 environment is the landscaping of the 
 open land along{Woden Road South}     
 bordering the{River Tame.}Prior to    
 infilling and landscaping (about 1970)
 this flood marsh of the{Tame}was a    
 habitat for frogs, toads and many     
 birds-including{Warblers.}The pool    
 adjacent to the College supports wild 
 fowl including migrating{Canada geese.
 The{Tame Canal}is increasingly used   
 for leisure traffic.                  
  Detrcating from the overall          
 cleanliness was an area at the bottom 
 of{Kilvert Road}that showed decay and 
 dereliction, urgently in need of      
 repearation.                          </content>
