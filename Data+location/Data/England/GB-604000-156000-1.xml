		<content> This area still contains many acres of
 outstanding natural beauty, it is     
 mainly farmland top fruit, hops arable
 and large tracts of coppiced woodland,
 the whole,being traversed by narrow   
 winding roads. With the advancement   
 of mechanisation on the land and      
 subsequently less people employued ,  
 the many farm cottages and houses and 
 buildings such as oasts and barns have
 been bought by people from outside the
 area, converted into residential      
 property but commuting daily to work  
 in nearby towns or London. Residential
 areas are so scattered there is       
 virtually no public transport and     
 village Post Offices are hard pressed 
 to stay open, but pubs do very well   
 with the many visiters atracted to the
 area.
