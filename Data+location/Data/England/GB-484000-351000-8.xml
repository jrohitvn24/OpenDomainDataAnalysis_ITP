		<title>08Barnby in the W.River Witham</title>
		<content>  About 10 years ago the river bed  was
 lowered  and flood  banks  raised. All
 the riverside trees  were  removed and
 not replaced. Regular  weedkilling  by
 the    Severn  Trent  Water  Authority
 reduced the  Witham  near Barnby to no
 more than a drainage ditch.           
  Fortunately the  use  of  weedkillers
 seems to  have  ceased  and the  river
 banks are recovering rapidly. The soil
 disturbance has allowed  dormant seeds
 to germinate and the variety of plants
 has  improved.  The  Witham  is  again
 beginning to look  more like  a  river
 and   less  a  canal.  The   water  is
 probably  cleaner now than it has been
 for   several   centuries.  The   main
 problem, now  common  to  most English
 rivers, is excessive  growth  of  weed
 due to agricultural fertilizers  which
 reach  the  river  through  the   ever
 increasing number of field drains.    </content>
