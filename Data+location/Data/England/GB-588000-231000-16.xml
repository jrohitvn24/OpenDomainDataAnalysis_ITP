		<content>    My day starts at half past six when
 I wake up.I have half an hour reading 
 and get dressed.I choose a good book  
 and go downstairs to the kitchen.I get
 my favouite cereal and pour myself    
 my favourite drink.I eat and read at  
 the same time.When I have finished I  
 go and make my bed.I then have half an
 hour to myself.                       
    At about twenty to nine I leave for
 school on my bicycle.We go in school  
 and lessons start at nine.At twenty to
 eleven we have break and I play French
 Skipping.The next break is from       
 twelve to one fifteen.The last break  
 is from two fifteen to two twenty     
 five.At quarter past three we go home.
    When I get home I read until four  
 twenty and then watch television till 
 six.I play on the computer till seven 
 and then watch television till eight.I
 then go to bed. By Sally Lampard.     </content>
