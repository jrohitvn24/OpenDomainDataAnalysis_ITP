		<content> BOND HELICOPTERS; NORTH DENES         
 AIRFIELD; GT. YARMOUTH                
   23 years ago, David Bond founded the
 firm. North Denes Airfield is divided 
 into two halves,owned by two          
 companies,Bond &amp; Bristow. British     
 Airways helicopters also use the      
 airfield. Simon Bedford showed us two 
 helicopters, one French and one       
 American. The French one was          
 claustrophobic and the tail rotors    
 were set in the tail itself.The       
 other machine was more spacious. The  
 Heliport has 3 machines, costing an   
 average Â£1.3M.The largest can do 200  
 mph and carry 12 passengers. While we 
 were in the helicopter, one of us was 
 tye pilot, one a co-pilot, &amp; the rest 
 passengers. Inside was a various      
 amount of controls like a lit         
 Christmas Tree, most of which we      
 couldn't understand.                  </content>
