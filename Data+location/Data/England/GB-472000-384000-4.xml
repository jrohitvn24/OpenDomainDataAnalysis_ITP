		<content> THE VILLAGE OF NORTH WHEATLEY TO THE  
 EAST OF THE GRID IS A MIXTURE   OF THE
 OLD AND THE NEW. THE OLDER PROPERTIES 
 MENTIONED EARLIER HAVE BEEN ADDED TO  
 IN RECENT YEARS BY DEVELOPERS WHO HAVE
 BUILT HOUSES FOR PEOPLE WHO COME TO   
 LIVE IN THE MORE RURAL SURROUNDINGS.  
 THE EASE OF TRANSPORT HAS ENCOURAGED  
 MANY PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE VILLAGE. 
 THEY TEND TO USE THE VILLAGE AS A BASE
 AND TRAVEL OUTSIDE TO WORK IN THE     
 LARGER TOWNS. THE POPULATION TENDS TO 
 BE STABLE AND THE OLD AND NEWER       
 MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY GELL TOGETHER
 WELL.                                 
 HAYTON IS A MORE RECENT DEVELOPMENT   
 BEING CONSTRUCTED ALONG A MINOR ROAD  
 TO THE VILLAGE OF CLAYWORTH.PROPERTY  
 HERE IS OF VARYING AGE AND IS OCCUPIED
 BY OLDER RESIDENTS AND NEWER MEMBERS  
 OF THE COMMUNITY WHO ALSO WORK IN THE 
 NEARBY TOWNS.                         </content>
