We went on a trip from the Jackdaw     
Garage to the main gate at Honington.We
saw at the garage some petrol          
pumps,some cars that needed repairing  
and a shop.On the other side of the    
road there was a corn field and beside 
that there was a bus stop.Further on   
there was a play school,church and some
houses.Opposite the church was a grass 
field.Next to the grass field there was
a little wood with a pond in it.We     
found out that almost all of the trees 
were deciduous. There was the          
HONINGTON CAMP POST OFFICE STORES and  
next to that there was a bus           
timetable.We found out that the bus    
goes from Bury St.Edmunds to Thetford  
and Thetford to Bury st.Edmunds.Then   
there were some more houses. Next to   
the houses was a barley field. Along   
its side there were sycamore trees.    </content>
