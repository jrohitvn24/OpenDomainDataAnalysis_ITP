		<content> In studying our D.block we camped at  
 Skyburriowe farm.Mr.Benny,his brother,
 wife and female employee work the     
 farm. .It is a{250 acre dairy farm  } 
 with{80 milking cows, 150 beef cows,a 
{donkey and a bull which was won in a  
{raffle.}The cows are milked in a      
{modern parlour}twice a day and produce
{1100 litres}of milk per day which is  
 collected daily by a tanker.Mr.Benny  
 tries to grow as much animal food as  
 he can.In the Spring and Summer they  
 harvest as much{grass}as possible to  
 use as{silage}to feed to the cows in  
 the winter.They also grow{corn}which  
 they grind themselves.It is very well 
 equipped with{modern machinery}and has
 a collection of old tractors.Farming  
 is very hard work.The farmer works    
 very long hours to look after the     
 animals and often{ gets up in the     
{middle of the night to nurse them.    </content>
