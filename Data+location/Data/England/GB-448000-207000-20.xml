		<content>   The Weeping Child of Wolvercote     
  This story which dates back to 1744  
is still told about a vicar of         
Wolvercote.                            
  Returning late one night from        
Oxford,his lantern went out.           
  Continuing on his way in the dark he 
suddenly heard a strange sound of a    
child weeping.                         
  Suddenly for no apparent reason his  
lantern shone again lighting up another
such lamp on the ground.               
  Fetching a spade the vicar began to  
dig and came across the skeleton of a  
longÂ£dead child.This was later removed 
and given a Christian burial in the    
churchÂ£yard in Wolvercote.             
  The story goes that the child was    
shot  by the Kings guards at the       
defences of Oxford a hundred years     
previously.                            
                                       </content>
