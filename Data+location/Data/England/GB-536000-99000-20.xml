		<content> I would like Telscombe Cliffs to have 
 more trees,ponds and wildlife. At the 
 moment they are killing it by putting 
 houses and shops most of which I do   
 not like.They should have a lot more  
 parks with ponds and trees. It would  
 be nice to see more animals.

 near the new housing developments.
