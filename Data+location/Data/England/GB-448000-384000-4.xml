		<title>04The Red Lion - Todwick.</title>
		<content> This{restaurant}on Kiveton Lane in    
 Todwick used to be across the road    
 from where it is now, and was built   
 in 1923. Before that time the building
 was a private house with stables.In   
 1933 the house was made into a        
 restaurant and later the stables were 
 made into a pub to improve it. The    
 menu is both a la carte, prepared and 
 cooked to order, and the table d'hote 
 set menu. Prices vary between Â£5.95   
 and Â£8.75. During the third week in   
 May they ordered 11 gallons of beer   
 and the same in lager. The restaurant 
 is most busy on Saturday nights and   
 Sunday lunch time.In 1986 40 bedrooms 
 will be built on and the restaurant   
 will be made into an{hotel}to cater   
 for passing trade on the A57 or the   
 motorway, as well as visitors  to the 
 nearby towns.
