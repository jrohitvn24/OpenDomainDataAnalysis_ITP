		<content>    I wake up and read my book. I let  
 my dog Benji out side for a run. Next 
 I have my breakfast,Cornflakes,Bovril 
 on Toast and a cup of tea. Then I go  
 up stairs to get dressed. I put on    
 Knickers,Socks,Trousers,Tee-shirt and 
 a Jumper. I play with Benji.          
    I put my Ankle-boots and coat on   
 ready to go to Sudbury with my family,
 in the car to do the shopping.        
    On arrival we find a place to park 
 the car. We go to a Supermarket and   
 get our food shopping. We get the dog 
 food from Boots the Chemist.          
    We then have time to enjoy looking 
 around all the other shops to buy such
 things as Clothes,Shoes,Toys and      
 China. We also visit the Open Air     
 Market.                               
    We then return to the car for the  
 journey home to unpack the shopping   
 and have lunch. LYNNE KIRKHAM.AGE 10. </content>
