   At the foot of the slope there is   
 mainly unimproved meadows drained by  
 the Colliers Brook and the Leigh Brook
 extending north wards towards the     
 Coombe Hill Canal and The Leigh.      
 Wainlode in the 1920's and 30's used  
 to be a popular Sunday outing for     
 young people from Cheltenham,         
 Gloucester and Tewkesbury when cycling
 was popular. Crowds came to fish, swim
 and sunbathe on the banks of the River
 Severn. Now people go further afield  
 in cars but the Red Lion is still     
 popular in the evenings.              
   On the west side of the river is    
 another area f flat meadowland lying  
 behind an embankment.
