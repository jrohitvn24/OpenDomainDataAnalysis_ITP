		<content> People used to dance around the       
 bonfire on the shortest day.  A       
 long-demolished cottage used to belong
 to an old woman who loved cats whom   
 people used to call the witch.  There 
 used to be stocks on Low Green in     
 which miscreants had to sit as a      
 punishment but there is no sign of    
 them now.                             
                                       
 The Travelling People still come to   
 the area, variously known as gypsies  
 or tinkers.  They live in large       
 caravans, unlike the old vardoes, and 
 have cars and trucks.  They deal in   
 various merchandise as well as scrap  
 metal.  Local people, on the whole, do
 not trust them.
