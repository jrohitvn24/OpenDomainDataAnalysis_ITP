 place in the country where signalmen  
 receive their basic military training.
 About 30 recruits enter the camp every
 fortnight and are taught basic        
 training for 10 weeks.They are        
 confined to barracks for 3 to4 weeks. 
 They learn to march,salute,look after 
 and wear their uniform properly,      
 keeping fit by jogging,assualt courses
 and P.T. instruction. They also learn 
 how to use weapons and how to give    
 first aid.They live in a room         
 containing five beds,which they must  
 clean,in a large barrack block.       
  The signals have a cap badge called  
{Jimmy}he was a message carrier for the
 gods and became the Signal's badge    
 because he was quick.The Signal motte 
 is {CERTA CITO}which means swift and  
 sure.The men obtain this badge when   
 they learn to salute correctly.       </content>
