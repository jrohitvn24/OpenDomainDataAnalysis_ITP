		<title>19BIRDLIFE AROUND GRASSMOOR.</title>
		<content> There are lots of birds to be seen at 
 any time of the year. This is being   
 written in June when swallows, swifts 
 and martins are flying everywhere in  
 the area. The house martins have made 
 fifteen nests under the eaves of      
 Grassmoor School.                     
 We have seen flights of wagtails,     
 magpies, gulls, robins and redwings as
 well as the more common blackbirds,   
 rooks, thrushes and sparrows.         
 Partridges have been seen in the      
 school playground and in the park     
 opposite. There is at least one       
 sparrow hawk in the area and there may
 be more. Nobody seems to know where it
 nests.                                
 Some herons have been seen near the   
 ponds at Williamthorpe Colliery. Wild 
 geese, ducks and swans are often seen 
 there.
