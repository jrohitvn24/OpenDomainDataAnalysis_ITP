		<content>   The beef herd are bought as bullocks
 and kept for  18 months.   During  the
 winter they  are fed on baled  silage.
 There is only one herd in this block. 
                                       
   The peas are sent to be "mushy peas"
 or animal feed. The potatoes grown are
 a  mixture  of  second  early and main
 crop. They  are  sold to  caterers and
 fast food  shops for use as chips. The
 brussell sprouts are sold for freezing
 or  to  be  prepacked  for  the  large
 retail  food  chains.  The  onions are
 grown to give a supply for the  market
 throughout the year.                  
                                       
   Winter  wheat  is  grown  as  animal
 feed and  Oil Seed Rape  is  grown for
 food and industrial companies.
