		<content>  The underlying limestone also affects
 the type of farming carried out within
 the block.As the limestone is covered 
 by a thin layer of soil,the land is   
 used for grazing,for silage or for    
 hay.The principal animals kept are    
 dairy cattle and sheep.               
  However,the type of farming is also  
 influenced by two other factors:      
    _As limestone is dissolved by      
 water,streams and rivers create steep 
 sided valleys which are difficult to  
 cultivate;                            
    _As the land is around 300 metres  
 above sea level,the growing season is 
 substantially shortened,making grass  
 the only viable crop.                 
  Thus this block is essentially an    
 upland area containing a village,a    
 number of small hamlets and farms     
 dependent on farming and quarrying for
 their existence.                      </content>
