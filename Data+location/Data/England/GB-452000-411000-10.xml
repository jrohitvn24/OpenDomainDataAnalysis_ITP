		<title>10Birthday Barbecues</title>
		<content>   In the village of Norton, in the    
 street of Cridling Gardens, it is     
 customary to hold a party or barbecue 
 on someone's birthday.                
   Such barbecues are held in summer   
 and the custom arose one summer when  
 all the families were outside,talking,
 and my Mother said it was her 40th    
 birthday so we held a barbecue to     
 celebrate.                            
   If it is a barbecue then we eat the 
 food outside the person's house but if
 it is a party with alcohol then we    
 hold it in the house.                 
   Our barbecue food includes sausages,
 bacon, beefburgers, with salad and    
 pitta bread.                          
   All are invited to come but if      
 someone cannot attend the party we    
 take some alcohol to their house so   
 they are not left out.
