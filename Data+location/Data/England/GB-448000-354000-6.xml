 Mr. Sowter's farm is 170 acres and he 
 uses his farm for cereals, beef and   
 milk production.   He has got 15 dairy
 cows and has got some more animals for
 children, like horses, goats and      
 geese.   He grows wheat, barley, oil  
 seed rape and potatoes.               
    {Prospect Farm}, Kirkby Woodhouse. 
 Mrs. Lee couldn't tell us how big her 
 farm is because she had it written    
 down somewhere but she didn't know    
 where.   She uses the farm for dairy  
 cows and crops.  She couldn't tell us 
 how many cows either because when     
 calves are born they go to a milking  
 parlour and she would add two or take 
 three away so she couldn't tell us how
 many altogether.  She grows barley,   
 wheat, oats and grass.
