		<content>{Attitudes to Tourism}                 
 People in Woburn think that the       
 village has changed greatly in the    
 past few years. It now caters more for
{tourists}than for the residents.      
 Several shopkeepers disagreed with    
 this, but the tourists provide their  
 livelihood. Residents think that the  
 prices are too high and they cannot   
 afford to shop there. They do not     
 approve of the new antique and fashion
 shops which have opened in recent     
 years.                                
 The{Woburn Golf Tournaments}also      
 attract tourists and many celebrities,
 but residents and shop keepers seem to
 approve of this.                      
 On the whole the residents welcome    
 tourists as the livelihood of the     
 village depends on them.
