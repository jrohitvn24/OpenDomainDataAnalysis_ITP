		<title>06EMPLOYMENT IN MARKFIELD</title>
		<content> My mum, dad, two brothers and sisters 
 came from Hong Kong. My little sister 
 and I were born in England. My mum and
 dad came to England to work. The first
 house we had was in Loughborough. We  
 had a shop called Golden Chau.We then 
 moved to Leicester to a shop with the 
 same name. My dad found an            
 advertisement in the paper for a cafe 
 for sale. He went to Markfield to look
 at the cafe. He found it was pretty   
 big so he bought it.He called it the  
 Golden Lion. We have been in Markfield
 for three years.
