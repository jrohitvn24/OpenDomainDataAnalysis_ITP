		<content>  D-Square 04360273 extends from the   
 former village of Toll Bar End, now a 
 suburb of the city of Coventry, east  
 to the village of Ryton on Dunsmore   
 and beyond.                           
  The area is predominantly rural in   
 character but the city of Coventry is 
 having an increasingly urban influence
 on the area.                          
  Manufacturing and extractive         
 industries as well as agriculture are 
 found in the area.                    
  The river Avon meanders west then    
 south through the area following a    
 shallow valley with a NE-SW trend.    
  Maximum height is 107m in the SE,    
 minimum height is 50m along the river 
 in the SW. The average height of the  
 area is  70m. The roads and           
 settlements are on the higher, dryer  
 land; Ryton Bridge is situated at the 
 narrowest point along the valley.     </content>
