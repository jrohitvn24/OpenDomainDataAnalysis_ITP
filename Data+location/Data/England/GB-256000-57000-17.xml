		<title>17Hemerdon - Bottle Hill.</title>
		<content>   We started at the top of Galva Road 
 near Bottle Hill and we walked up to  
 Drakeland Corner. We passed three     
 houses called High Post, Plymview and 
 Higher Drakelands. We could see       
 Hemerdon Mine on the moor, rough      
 grazing land and some woodland. High  
 Post had a postbox in the wall out    
 side. We then turned down the lane to 
 Bottle Hill.                          
   On top of the hill was an old mining
 chimney for the arsenic fumes from the
 mine in the hill beneath. We passed   
 over a bridge and saw a house with    
 ducks and geese. There was a disused  
 quarry and the hillside was covered in
 woodland. At the end of the lane was a
 field for grazing and Bottle Hill     
 Quarry which is now used as a scrap   
 yard.
