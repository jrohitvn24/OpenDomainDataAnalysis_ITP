		<content> This area contains the settlement of  
 Southwell. There has been a lot of    
 residential building in this region   
 since the 1960's and all of the       
 properties are privately owned.  The  
 large area of modern properties is    
 often referred to as The Sweethill    
 estate. A modern Infant and Primary   
 school has been built to serve this   
 area. A building of interest is       
 Avalanche church named after a        
 ship wrecked on the rocky coastline of
 the Island.  Relics from the shipwreck
 are displayed in Portland Museum.     
 Also contained within this area is a  
 large quarry extracting Portland      
 limestone.  The quarry employs        
 relatively few people.
