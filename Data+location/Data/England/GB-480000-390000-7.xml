		<title>07Family Size in Our Area.</title>
		<content>  Our aim was to find out the number   
 of children per family. We went round 
 the classes and got all the children  
 to say how many brothers and sisters  
 they  have in their families.         
 In class one they have thirty-three   
 brothers and  thirty-two sisters.     
 In class two they have forty-four     
 brothers and thirty-five sisters.In   
 class three the total of brothers was 
 forty-eight and sisters thirty-one.   
 So we went on round and we found out  
 that there were a few more boys than  
 girls.The avarage number of children  
 was two per family.The most in one    
 family was seven and the least was    
 one.In the larger families there      
 seemed to be more boys  than girls.In 
 the families with an only child these 
 were all boys.Some children have      
 larger families because their parents 
 have remarried.                       </content>
