		<title>11SCHOOLS (FISHTOFT)</title>
		<content>   There are two schools in our area.  
 Our school - Fishtoft - has just under
 100 pupils whilst Butterwick has over 
 200.                                  
   Fishtoft is over 100 years old and  
 ten years ago was to close down       
 because or had less thanb 30 children.
 Now it has nearly 100 and has 4       
 classes. The kitchen closed five years
 ago.                                  
   The school house has been occupied  
 by previous heads until recently and  
 this summer is going to be developed  
 as an extention to the school. They   
 are going to build a new classroom, a 
 library, a storeroom, an office and a 
 staffroom. They are also going to put 
 a new heating system in the school.   
   Before she died Mrs. Rimington told 
 us that in the war they dropped       
 anti-personnel bombs in the           
 playground.                           </content>
