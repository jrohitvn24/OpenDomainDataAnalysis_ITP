		<title>04BRISTOL POLICEMAN'S VIEW</title>
		<content>{Westbury Park}does not need normal    
 policing.Community policing is the    
 most effective,one policeman to one   
 area,reminding people to renew        
 motor taxes,trying to be seen to care 
 and help.In response they are good    
 informants and help to keep an eye on 
 other people's property.              
 A cross_section of the people would   
 be cosmopolitan,fairly intelligent and
 professional.They try to raise the    
 standard of the area.There is little  
 trouble but a lot of crime.           
 There are two or three burglaries a   
 night,but I have only experienced one 
 case of real violence.Young families  
 and students living in flats, are     
 often replacing older people living in
 whole houses. My main contact with    
 children is  my relationship with the 
 local primary school and with those   
 who come to my swimming club. {       </content>
