 Known as Winestead Garage, it stands  
 in Patrington, the boundary being very
 close by. It was built in 1970 on land
 in front of Fasco Buildings which was 
 the former site of a brick kiln when  
 the brickworks were in being and      
 originally only sold petrol.          
 The present owners purchased it in    
 1983 and have since then added a      
 workshop, modern M.O.T. bay, a shop   
 selling tobacco, sweets and car       
 spares, a showroom, car hire          
 facilities and employs six people.    
 In 1984 they bacame agents for Ford   
 cars.  In 1985 a Ford Fiesta Popular  
 950 costs Â£4,258.73 on the road.  A   
 Granada Scorpio costs Â£15,810.00 on   
 the road.
