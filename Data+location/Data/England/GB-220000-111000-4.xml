 On June 7th  in a hillside meadow,    
 unploughed within living memory we    
 found and identified   37  different  
 wild flowers. In the whole parish a   
 survey of 25 years ago found a total  
 of over 400 different species of      
 flora.                                
{Hedges                                
 The hedgerows  around  Morwenstow  are
 built  of  clay  often  with  a  stone
 facing and  topped with  a variety  of
 trees  and plants.  Many are very old.
 To calculate  their ages, we  used Dr.
 Max Hooper's equation.  {Age of hedge=
{ (number of species in 30 yards x 110)
{+ 20 years. }Most roadside  hedges had
 an average of 6 different trees giving
 a rough age of{700}years.             
 32 types of flowers were also noted in
 one hedge.
