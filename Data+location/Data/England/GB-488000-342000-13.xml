		<content> Transport is important to small       
 villages like ours.  Most people      
 travel by car, some families having   
 two cars where father needs his for   
 travelling to work.                   
 There is a school bus every day to    
 take the children to and from their   
 Secondary Schools in Grantham.  There 
 is also a works bus each day.  On     
 Saturday, Wednesday and Friday there  
 are buses to Newark and Grantham to   
 take people shopping.  Some children  
 cycle to school from Hougham.         
 The main London to Edinburgh passes   
 through the villages but now no longer
 stops here.
