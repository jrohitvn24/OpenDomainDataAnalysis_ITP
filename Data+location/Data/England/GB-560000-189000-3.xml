		<title>03CHILDERDITCH COMMON AREA</title>
		<content> Childerditch is an undulating rural   
 area which is within easy reach of    
 Brentwood. It is dominated by common  
 and arable farmland, overlooked by the
 wooded area of Thorndon Park. Many of 
 the farms shown on the map are no     
 longer working farms, and in some     
 instances the land has been sold off  
 or rented out. Housing is either      
 private or agricultural.The centre of 
 the village is the village hall, which
 was once the local school. It is used 
 as a play school, youth centre and for
 meetings. The main crops being grown  
 are wheat and oil-seed rape. The      
 housing is varied, ranging from large 
 detached residences to very small     
 bungalows.The main attraction is "The 
 Greyhound", a large Public house,     
 overlooking the Common. The roads are 
 narrow and windy, hedged on either    
 side.                                 </content>
