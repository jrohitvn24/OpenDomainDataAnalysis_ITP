		<title>11ST MAWGAN YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content> St Mawgan youth  club started in 198O.
 The original leaders were John Wharry 
 and Sarah Conibear. In 1983 Hilary    
 Conibear and Sarah Wailes replaced    
 them. Until 1984 the youth club met in
 the church hall, but while the church 
 hall is being improved we meet in     
 Mawgan Porth hall.  We meet every     
 Friday at 7.3O until 1Opm from        
 September to June. We meet at the     
 hall for 2 weeks, and go out for the  
 3rd.Activities include table tennis,  
 darts, pool, swingball, quiz's, games 
 and disco's. We visit Polkyth leisure 
 centre, St Austell for swimming,      
 squash and the St Eval 1O pin bowling 
 alley. We've taken part in a T.V game 
 "thats my dog" and represented        
 Cornwall in a tabletennis competition.
 Membership is open from 11 to 2O      
 years. There is an adult and members  
 committee.     Olivia Conibear.       </content>
