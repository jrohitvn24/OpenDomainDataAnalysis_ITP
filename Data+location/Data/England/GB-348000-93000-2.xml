		<title>02GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The Bridport branch of the GREAT      
 WESTERN RAILWAY ran from Maiden Newton
 through Toller Porcorum, Nettlecombe, 
 Loders, Bradpole, Bridport and West   
 Bay. It was opened in 1854. It cost   
 Â£20,000 to build and it cost 9d old   
 money to go on and it took one hour   
 and a  half from Maiden Newton to     
 Westbay. It normally took 50 people   
 and it also was a goods train. It was 
 10\ miles long and it had only one    
 track.                                
 It was closed down because it did not 
 pay enough money so it shut down. The 
 people who wanted to keep the line    
 open only needed Â£1,000 more to       
 keep it open. But a landowner paid the
 recovery men to take the line up ten  
 months before schedule.
