		<content> The present owner has been the tenant 
 of Swiss Cottage,the old South Lodge  
 of Worden Park,for 10 years.The       
 cottage was the only reason for her   
 moving to Leyland.The house has       
 overhead cables connecting it to the  
 mains,and power cuts are frequent.The 
 cottage is not connected to main      
 drains,but instead has huge sceptic   
 tanks.She has 3 children,all of whom  
 grew up in Leyland,and are now        
 working.She has found that the        
 facilities around her are not good    
 enough as she is more than a mile from
 the nearest shopping area.As the house
 is secluded she has often been burgled
 ,and valuable items have been         
 stolen.This has prompted her to buy an
 Alsation.she has discovered the area  
 is very rough(drugs etc.)and this has 
 made her wish to move from the area.
