 This was one of the first types of    
 filling used in timber framed houses. 
 A mixture of clay and straw was put in
 betwen a framework of branches and    
 twigs.                                
{Tile Hanging                          
 These are used for covering timber    
 framed houses.  A series of oak laths 
 are nailed across the framework and   
 then tiles are pegged into the laths. 
 The tiles can be ordinary rectangular 
 shapes or of a fancy design.          
{Weather-boarding                      
 This was very popular in the 18th and 
 19th centuries.  It also covered a    
 timber frame.  Long narrow planks of  
 oak or elm wood were pinned           
 overlapping by nails to the oak       
 framework of the house.  They were    
 often painted white in Kent.  Nowadays
 plastic boarding is sometimes used.   </content>
