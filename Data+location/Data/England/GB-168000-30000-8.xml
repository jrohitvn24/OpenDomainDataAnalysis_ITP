		<title>08Industry: Tin &amp; Copper Mines</title>
		<content>      The remains of lots of mines can 
 be seen over most of Cornwall and our 
 area has several - Trumpet and Wendron
 Consols was a large mine.             
      In the 19th Century mining was a 
 booming industry, but then things died
 down, mines closed and many Cornish   
 miners moved to other countries.  The 
 only light which the old miners had to
 work by was a candle stuck into their 
 felt hat.  They had to work very long 
 hours for very little pay: Â£1.40 a    
 month.  Women, called Bal Maidens,    
 worked at the surface crushing the    
 ore.  Boys went underground at eleven 
 years old.                            
      Now, in the 1980s, mining is much
 safer:  the miners have electric      
 lights and powerful drills driven by  
 compressed air.  Machines crush the   
 ore instead of Bal Maidens.
