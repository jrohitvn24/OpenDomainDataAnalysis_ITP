 and reads.He gets up at 7 a.m.,has    
 another cup of coffee and goes to     
 church at 8.45 a.m..Sometimes he sorts
 out a problem and is late for morning 
 service.At 10 a.m. on Mondays he comes
 to school and stays for one and half  
 hours and then visits someone before  
 he goes home at 1 p.m.. First he      
 checks the telephone answering machine
