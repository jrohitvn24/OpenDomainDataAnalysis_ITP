		<title>11THE CARDBOARD BOX.</title>
		<content> I am a cardboard box,                 
 Stored in a N.A.F.F.I. yard.          
 I'm packed full with supplies         
 And each side is made of card.        
                                       
 One day a man came in,                
 And made sure I was strong.           
 He put some writing on me             
 And sent me to Hong-Kong.             
                                       
 After i was emptied,                  
 They left me out to rot.              
 I was put there in the evening,       
 In the morning I was not.             
                                       
 I was put into a back street          
 And in walked man and wife.           
 I sighed and thought to myself,       
 Oh, it is a difficult life.           
                                       
 Written after an Assembly on          
 homelessness.                         </content>
