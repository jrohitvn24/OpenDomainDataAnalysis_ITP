		<title>09THE CHURCH AT LEVINGTON</title>
		<content>  St. Peter's Church can be seen from  
the River Orwell, and might have been  
built as a landmark for navigation. It 
is thought to date from the 12th       
Century.  The outside walls have been  
plastered and whitewashed, but the     
tower is brick. The leaning walls have 
been supported by brick buttresses. The
church is small but most attractive.   
There are not many windows on the North
side, because people once believed that
evil spirits could enter from that side
of a building. The three bells in the  
tower are very old. The upper stages   
of the tower are  reached by ladders.  
There is some fine carving inside the  
church, the best being the carved oak  
pulpit which is early Jacobean. A new  
orgn has recently been installed. The  
church shares a Rector with            
neighbouring Parishes.
