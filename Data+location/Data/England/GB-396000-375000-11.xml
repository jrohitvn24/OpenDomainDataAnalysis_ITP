		<content>  The catchment area for the reservoir 
 is approximately one thousand acres,  
 but with only two feeder streams and  
 two drains,it is considered by the    
 Water Authority to be a rather poor   
 one.When full the surface area of the 
 reservoir is forty two acres and four 
 hundred and twenty million gallons of 
 water or ninety days supply would then
 be contained.There are considered to  
 be three layers of water within the   
 reservoir;these being determined by   
 depth below the surface level.The top 
 or transit layer is the cleanest and  
 contains the most aquatic life.This is
 followed by a middle layer which      
 contains less life and below that,at  
 the bottom,is the dirtiest stagnant   
 layer,the habitat of blood worms.     
    There are two outlets in the dam,  
 one at thirty feet below the surface  
 and the other at eighty five feet.    </content>
