		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> We have another break at 2.40, and    
 then it's orchestra. I play the       
 clarinet. At 4.00 we go home for a cup
 f tea and biscuits while we watch the 
 T.V. "I think Whizz is on tonight" At 
 5.30 we have tea, usually a boiled    
 egg and bread and butter or toast. At 
 6.00 we get ready for scouts which is 
 at Berkswell at 7.30. When we get     
 there, we have a game and then each   
 separate patrol has a meeting at it's 
 patrol box. One more game after this  
 and then home to happily greet a drink
 of Hot chocolate and a nice comfy     
 bed.(It is now about 10.00)           
 My day lasts fourteen and a half      
 hours. I have nine and a half hours   
 sleep!
