		<content> Thyme common,sage,some other herbs and
  some mint.At the other end of the    
 garden there are the remains of our   
 old garage.My dad has built the wall  
 up and put a big barbecue in there.The
 other side of the wall,there is a coal
 bunker where we keep all our coal.Next
 to the coal bunker there is an oil    
 tank where we keep all our oil.Over   
 the barbecue there is a climber for   
 our climbing plants .In the summer we 
 spend most of our time outside in the 
 garden.Beside the house there is a    
 garage where we keep our bikes and my 
 dad keeps some of his work things.    
       The most common flowers are     
 daffodil,snowdrop, tulip and primrose 
 in spring and rose,pansy and begonia  
 in summer.In our vegetable patch we   
 have carrots,potatoes,onions,cabbage, 
 beetroot,beans,cauliflower,peas and
