		<title>07 NORTHAMPTON TOWN F.C.</title>
		<content>In Northampton there is a football     
ground. Our team is known locally as   
"the cobblers" and is at present in the
fourth division. There is a big stadium
(known as the County Ground)where our  
home town plays cricket as well as     
football.                              
The Cobblers  were promoted into       
the first division in 1965 and then    
started dropping back again. They went 
right down into the fourth division one
season after another.                  
The club have had many difficulties and
problems not least of all financial,   
but their new chairman Derek Banks     
hopes that one day in the not too      
distant future they will again be      
promoted into the first division.      
Their colours are purple and white.
