   Mr.Atkinson was born on a farm and  
 went to University to study farming.He
 has now been a farmer for 20 years. He
 works from a quarter to eight until   
 four o'clock, but he says when you    
 have your own farm you never really   
 stop thinking about it. He likes      
 farming very much, especially harvest 
 time when he sees the products of all 
 of his hard work. One of the jobs that
 Mr.Atkinson likes the least is        
 cleaning the pig stys out. He would   
 like to breed more animals in the     
 future. His main problem is subsidence
 and the using of pesticides which he  
 does not agree with but has to use    
 because of the great problems he has  
 with pests on his crops.
