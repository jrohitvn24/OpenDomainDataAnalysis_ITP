		<content>   Netherstowe Comprehensive School is 
one of three large secondary schools in
Lichfield. It was originally the       
Lichfield Central School and was       
renamed when it moved to a new building
in 1963. In 1966 it became fully       
comprehensive. Today the school caters 
for 1100 children, from the age of 11  
to 18. The school offers a wide range  
of subjects to Advanced level          
standards. Netherstowe has been noted  
in recent years for the success of its 
orchestra, who have on several         
occasions given concerts locally and   
toured part of America.
