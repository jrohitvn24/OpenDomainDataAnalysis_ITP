		<title>13Helping the Unemployed.</title>
		<content>  Quedgeley's redundant Junior School  
 now houses the St. James Project which
 is funded by the Manpower Services    
 Commision and sponsored by the        
 Gloucester Diocesan churches. Its aim 
 is to help long term unemployed people
 from 18 to 60 years get back into the 
 habit of regular work.                
  The 40 people on the site undertake  
 work for the elderly and disabled. The
 canteen provides up to 100 low cost   
 meals ( 80p_Â£1) per day for them.     
  In addition, the building is used as 
 a Community Centre for everyone and   
 is used by the Youth Club, Weight     
 Watchers, Keep Fit Classes and Dancing
 School. There are facilities too for a
 creche and a playschool.
