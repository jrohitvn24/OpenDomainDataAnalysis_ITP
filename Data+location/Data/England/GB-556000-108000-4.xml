		<content>   At the{Cattle Market}bidding is done
 in 50p's, Â£1's and Â£5's.The{auctioneer
 stands in between the pens and starts 
 off with the farmers bidding price.   
 Each farmer has his own signal to     
 say  "yes" to the bid; one farmer gave
 a puff of his cigarette. Others use a 
 blink of the eye, a twitch of a finger
 and a raise of the hand.              
                                       
   The auctioneer has to ring a bell to
 let the farmers know that the next    
 item is about to start.When all the   
 people are ready he starts to bid.He  
 talks very quickly and usually repeats
 the price over and over again.        
                                       
   A man from the Ministry of          
 Agriculture  decides if each animal is
 healthy. If not, it is taken away for 
 slaughter.                            
                                       </content>
