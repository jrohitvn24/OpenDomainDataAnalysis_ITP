 Goodnestone school is a small country 
 Primary School. This year is our 150th
 Anniversary, which we celebrated in   
 the Summer Term.  One third of the    
 children come from Chillenden and     
 Goodnestone, the rest come from       
 outside our Parish.  We learn all the 
 usual school subjects such as Maths   
 and English.  We also learn to play   
 recorders, tenor, descant, treble and 
 sopranino.  We learn French.  We some_
 times go on trips to the continent,   
 last time we went to Katwijk in       
 Holland.  French children come to our 
 school to study in the summer.  We go 
 to Nonington college for swimming and 
 gymnastics.  Nonington college is     
 closing soon.
