		<content> There is a fairly wide range of       
 facilities in the area.Some of those  
 listed were a Sports Centre,Swimming  
 Pools,Libraries,pubs,Clubs and Parks. 
 Activities connected with the Church  
 also featured largely in our          
 children's discussion - these included
 Sunday School,Cubs,Brownies,Scouts,   
 Guides,Young wives and Mother and     
 Toddler Clubs.Activities specifically 
 for children such as Dance Classes,   
 Karate,Judo and Discos are held at the
 Community Centre.Family activities    
 seem to centre on videos and          
 television.  When asked how they and  
 their families spent their leisure    
 time the children seemed to prefer the
 activities organised by the Church and
 the Community Centre and made full use
 of them,whilst adults in the main went
 to pubs and clubs.
