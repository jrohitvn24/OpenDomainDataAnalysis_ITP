		<title>19Employment at Notgrove</title>
		<content> Employment is high, most working on   
 the farms in the area. Labour         
 relations are good, with the main     
 employer being Mr. Acland of Notgrove 
 Manor, who is well liked in the       
 village.                              
                                       
 The farms are in a viable farming area
 with the neat well maintained cottages
 indicating a prosperous area. Notgrove
 Church has its main fund raising at   
 the May Bank Holiday, when a grand    
 fete is held in one of the beautiful  
 village gardens, and usually raises   
 hundreds of pounds.                   
                                       
 There is no mains gas in the area, but
 everyone is connected to the          
 electricity supply. 1 or 2 cottages   
 use Calor Gas.
