		<title>15Britannia Coconut Dancers :1</title>
		<content>   The Britannia Coconutters are a     
 group of Morris Dancers unique to this
 area. With blackened faces they       
 dance through the streets every Easter
 Saturday wearing black jerseys, red   
 and white skirts, white hats decorated
 with feathers, white stockings        
 and shiny black clogs.                
                                       
                                       
   Their dances were supposedly brought
 to Cornwall by North African sailors  
 who settled firstly in Cornwall, then 
 moved north to Lancashire's quarries  
 and mines in the 18th and 19th        
 centuries.                            
                                       
   The two main dances are the Garland 
 Dance and the Coconut Dance. The      
 former is a ritual dance of spring    
 using garlands of red, white and blue 
 paper flowers.                        </content>
