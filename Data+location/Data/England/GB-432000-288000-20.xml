		<title>20DOING THE DOMESDAY PROJECT</title>
		<content>  Our area was split into two equal    
 sections.The six eastern squares were 
 covered by Stockingford Middle School.
 Third year children (aged 10_11)worked
 on the project.The childen visited    
 each square and travelled by car to   
 the most distant areas.Parents        
 assisted with transport.Robinsons End 
 Middle School covered the six western 
 squares.Mr.Mick McGraw (Stockingford) 
 and Mrs.Heather Hall (Robinsons End)  
 met to collate the information and    
 work the two schools had collected.   
  Many of the children live in the area
 and even more actually visit the area 
 to play or to meet friends.A large    
 number of parents also work in the    
 area in shops,at the hospital,on the  
 industrial estates or in other small  
 businesses.Almost eveyone we have     
 approached in connection with the     
 project has been helpful and friendly.</content>
