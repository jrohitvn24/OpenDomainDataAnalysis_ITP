		<title>17Fishing In Oulton Beck?</title>
		<content> Oulton Beck,which is a tributary of   
 the River Aire,is very badly polluted 
 because of discharge of sewage from   
 inefficient sewage works.But it is    
 hoped to clean up the beck so that by 
 1995 people will be able to fish in   
 it.The Yorkshire Water Authority is   
 waiting for final approval for a      
 scheme to clean up the beck.Mrs       
 Brockleby,secretary of Oulton Civic   
 Society, is looking forward to the    
 beck being cleaned up."It should be   
 marvellous. I think the people of     
 Oulton will be delighted to hear the  
 news.The beck has needed cleaning for 
 some considerable time.I am glad that 
 the Yorkshire Water Authoity are doing
 something at last,now we can look     
 forward to a spot of fishing".
