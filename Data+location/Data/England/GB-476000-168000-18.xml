		<content> AN ACCOUNT OF A MORNING'S FIELD WORK:-
                                       
 We went for a walk equipped with four 
 forms.One was a map,another had spaces
 for ua to fill in what we felt,saw,   
 smelt and our likes and dislikes.The  
 third was a tally chart upon which we 
 had to tally house types,public places
 ,waste land etc.on the fourth sheet we
 noted how busy the roads were.We had  
 to note these things every 20 paces.On
 our our walk we went down King's St.  
 Lane and Bearwood Rd.Everyone had     
 special jobs to do.It really made us  
 notice things in our                  
 village.Some things we had taken for  
 granted or never even noticed.
