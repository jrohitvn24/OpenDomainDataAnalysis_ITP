The groups keep in touch with          
walkie-talkies.We give our position to 
the other group as we go .If we spot   
the hunted we call the others. Every   
member has a special task.             
Stuck in the mud has one player on.If  
you are ticked by him then you must    
stand with your legs wide apart.You    
escape if someone crawls throgh you.   
The player on wins if he has ticked    
everyone.
