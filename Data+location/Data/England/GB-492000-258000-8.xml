		<content> Duloe, Staploe and Honeydon,          
 originally grew up round 2 or 3 major 
 farmsteads. Between them was a        
 scattered pattern of smaller groups   
 occupying a farmhouse, its buildings  
 and one or two cottages. Essentially, 
 this population distribution pattern  
 has remained unchanged, despite the   
 declining number engaged in           
 agriculture and the balancing influx  
 of commuting workers. The County      
 Structure Plan maintains this         
 situation in the face of pressure from
 continuous population growth in the   
 neighbouring part of Cambridgeshire.  
 There are approximately 100           
 households, of which about a quarter  
 are totally retired; mostly ex-farm   
 workers or their widows, living on in 
 their tied cottages. 12 retired       
 persons live alone. There are 300     
 persons-53 of schoolage or under.     </content>
