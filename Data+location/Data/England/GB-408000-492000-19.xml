		<content>{RECOLLECTIONS OF OLDER RESIDENTS OF   
{BELLERBY                              
  Life seemed much harder than it is   
 today.There were no cars,buses or     
 telephones.Nearly everyone walked,    
 except in an emergency,when a more    
 "well off" resident might be asked to 
 fetch the doctor in his pony and trap.
  School life was quite different too. 
 We attended the village school till we
 were 14.There were no school dinners, 
 the toilets were earth closets and we 
 we were taught at long desks and      
 benches.Lessons were very formal.At   
 playtime we played with whips &amp; tops, 
 metal hoops,marbles and hop scotch.In 
 P.E.lessons we did drill which        
 involved marching and exercising with 
 dumb bells. There were no school      
 trips,no one ever came to talk to us  
 and of course there was no radio or   
 T.V.The only punishment was the cane. </content>
