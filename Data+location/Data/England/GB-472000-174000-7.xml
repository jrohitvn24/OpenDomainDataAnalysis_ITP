		<title>07The Mill at Sonning</title>
		<content>   The mill was a corn mill but now it 
 is converted into a theatre . It is   
 right on the River Thames and with    
 willow trees drooping into it .       
   I have been there. It was a very    
 enjoyable experience .The  play I saw 
 was a modern comedy called{"My Fat    
{Friend".}I thought it was very good   
 but the story was a bit weak .There   
 were five actors and one actress .    
   You have supper and drink and if you
 wish you can take your drink into the 
 theatre. In the interval you can go to
 the restaurant and have your sweet and
 coffee.{The ticket costs Â£12.50}and   
 includes the play and the dinner.     
   My father knows the carpenter who   
 does the scenery. He is very busy     
 because there is a different play on  
 every week.                           
   If you go into the bar there is a   
 big water wheel working.              </content>
