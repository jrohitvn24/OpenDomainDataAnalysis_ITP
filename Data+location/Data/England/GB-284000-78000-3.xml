		<title>03The Wheel Craft Centre</title>
		<content> Over 50 years ago there were two      
 working mills in Chudleigh, the Wheel 
 and Palace Mills where farmers took   
 their own grain for milling.  The     
 Wheel has been converted into The     
 Wheel Craft Workshops and has a       
 working water wheel, and historic mill
 buildings which house a restaurant and
 craft workshops.  The mill was        
 mentioned in the Domesday book and was
 one of many mills involved in         
 Chudleigh's woollen industry.  The    
 waterwheel is one of the largest      
 working backshot wheels in the country
 and has extensive interior machinery. 
    The centre is open from 10 to 5.30 
 seven days a week all year and the    
 restaurant is also open evenings.
