		<title>02Lower Calbourne Mill</title>
		<content>    There was a mill on this site in   
 the{Domesday Book.}It is not certain  
 how old the present mill is. There was
 a fire in 1890 which destroyed the    
 inside of the mill so the machinery   
 inside dates from that time.The mill  
 stopped working when in 1962 when the 
 owner retired.                        
    The present owner,{Mr.John Pretty  
 decided to start the mill working     
 again in{1972.                        
    The corn is ground by two pairs of 
{millstones.}One pair is driven by a   
 deisel engine,and the second pair is  
 driven by an electric motor.There is  
 insufficient water in the stream to   
 keep the stones turning long enough to
 grind the corn required.              
    That part of the machinery that    
 shakes the corn down on to the mill   
 stones is called a{millers damsel.}Mr.
 Pretty uses this as a trade name.     </content>
