		<title>04THE CHURCHES OF SUTTON VENY</title>
		<content>   Sutton Veny has two churches,but    
 only one is used now.The old church is
 Duck Street and is called St.Leonards.
 It was built in the thirteenth cent-  
 ury.  In 1865 it began to sink because
 of marshy ground and after that it was
 not used for thirty years.  Half of   
 the church is in ruins.               
   The Church of St.John The Evangelist
 in the High Street was built in 1886  
 to replace the old church.  It has a  
 spire and was built with stone from   
 Frome.  Outside there are many graves.
   A great many are Commonwealth War   
 graves.  On the south side of the     
 church there is a sundial. The Vicar  
 of Sutton Veny also takes services at 
 the Tytherington and Heytesbury       
 churches.
