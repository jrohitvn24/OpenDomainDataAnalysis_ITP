 The original farm was part of the     
 estate of Offley Place.'Grange'       
 suggests it was farmed by the monks   
 for the church.The present farmer has 
 a partnership with his son and the 490
 acres of land is rented from the      
 Pilkington family.The farming is      
 mainly beef cattle,500 head,350 sheep,
 and the rest of the land for crops.   
 The farm produces grass for feeding   
 the cattle and clover,for hay and     
 seed,which is sold.They grows 11 acres
 of sainfoin,which is also used for    
 hay and seed.This crop has not been   
 grown a lot since 1940,but is making  
 a successful come back.Winter beans,  
 peas and cereals are also grown.They  
 are doing a trial with triticale,which
 is a cross between rye and wheat.A lot
 of the cereal is not sold but used for
 feeding the cattle.                   </content>
