      Just outside  Wetwang near       
 Wetwang Grange off the road to        
 Driffield is a large and very         
 important archeological site.Bronze   
 Age chariots,weapons and skeletons    
 have been found.It was a burial site. 
                                       
      Each year a bit more is          
 excavated.It is on Mr.Hardy's land and
 there have been two main findings.The 
 chariots were found first and some    
 skeletons and then the weaponry.They  
 are hundreds of years old.            
                                       
      They were found accidently by a  
 man parking his truck and he realised 
 what he saw and reported it.
