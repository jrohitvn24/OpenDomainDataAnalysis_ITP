		<content> The Rising Sun is on the A530 Nantwich
 to Middlewich road. It is about 250   
 years old and has always been a pub.It
 was used as a stopping place for      
 stagecoaches.                         
 The hotel is owned by Greenall Whitley
 brewery and is leased out for a period
 of 21 years.A new manager has just    
 taken over and is making changes.An   
 extension is being built to increase  
 the the size and improve facilities   
 and it is inteneded  to increase      
 trade.                                
 An old fashioned railway signal will  
 be used outside to show when the pub  
 is open.                              
 In 1950 a man went to the pub with a  
 friend and liked it so much that he   
 has been going there regularly ever   
 since.
