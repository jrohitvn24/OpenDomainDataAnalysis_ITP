		<title>06HEREFORD SIXTH FORM COLLEGE</title>
		<content>    This College was opened in 1973    
 when Comprehensive education was      
 introduced in the City of Hereford. It
 was anticipated that 500 16 year old  
 students  from the local secondary    
 schools would wish to continue their  
 education at the College.             
    The College, also on the Aylestone 
 Campus, offers a wide variety of GCE A
 and O level courses and students are  
 given full careers advice while at the
 College. Most students go on to       
 tertiary education on leaving.        
    The facilities are excellent, with 
 a purpose built science block, two    
 lecture theatres, a library, resources
 centre, Arts, Music, Languages,       
 Mathematics and Computing Departments.
    A wide variety of extra curricular 
 activites are catered for, often in   
 association with the Technical College
 next door.                            </content>
