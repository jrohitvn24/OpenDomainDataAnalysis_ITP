		<title>03The Shropshire Union Canal</title>
		<content>     The towpath runs up one side of   
 the canal, where the horses walked    
 along when they were pulling the      
 barges.  It is now over-grown.  Along 
 the side of the towpath is a stable   
 where the horses were kept overnight. 
 Opposite this is the old wharf where  
 barges used to load and unload their  
 goods.  The old pub is above the wharf
 and is now a house.  The canal area is
 a very popular place to live and many 
 of the old houses have been done up.  
 By the wharf, on the bottom of the    
 canal bed, are the remains of a sunken
 barge.                                
     There are 2 basins which are wider
 parts used to turn around.            
     We saw many birds and quite a few 
 animals.  There were also many        
 different types of wild flowers and   
 trees.                                
                                       </content>
