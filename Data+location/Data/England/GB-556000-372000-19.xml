		<title>19MRS BLAIR'S SHOP</title>
		<content> Mrs Blair's shop is one of the        
 smallest shops on the green.She said  
 that if the council and the           
 shopkeepers got together it would be  
 better because then we would have     
 clubs,marching bands and all sorts    
 that would attract people to the      
 village.Mrs Blair likes it in Chapel  
 but thinks its a bit boring because   
 there is little to do.Mrs Blair said  
 that she would also like some large   
 shops in the village like Fine        
 Fare.She likes her shop,its new and   
 its outside the bus stops.She thinks  
 things should be changed around in    
 shops,put in different places.She     
 finds it very noisy at night          
 especially in summer because all the  
 kids shout and mess around outside her
 flat.The Blair family like the Chapel 
 area but miss Nottingham's big shops. 
 She sells gifts and hires out videos. </content>
