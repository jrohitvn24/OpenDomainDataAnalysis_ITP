		<title>12EMPLOYMENT IN CASTLEFORD</title>
		<content> We did a survey about people's jobs   
 and how they have changed.Most people 
 are in paid employment,men in full and
 women in part time work.Most men are  
 manual workers,mainly in the mining   
 industry.We found that more men than  
 women work.Of those most are in office
 or shop work.We found that most people
 travel between 1 and 5 miles to work. 
 Nearly all have only one job.A lot of 
 both men and women have changed their 
 jobs within the last ten years. This  
 is because of changes which have taken
 place in local industry.Less than half
 would like to change their jobs.Those 
 who would like to change would prefer 
 outdoor work or more exciting work.   
 On unemployment we found that 2419    
 males are claiming benefit and 1156   
 females.Also a total of 167 school    
 leavers are unemployed compared to 13%
 in Great Britain as a whole.          </content>
