		<title>15The Freshfield Shops (1)</title>
		<content> Near Freshfield station are several   
 shops including a baker's, a pet shop 
 and a newsagent's. We visited a cafe, 
 a garden centre and an aquarium too.  
 The baker's had many types of bread. A
 large wholemeal loaf cost 52 pence.   
 The pet shop had 4 mice, 4 fish, a    
 bird and a rabbit for sale. The news- 
 agent's sold Lyons Maid ice-cream. The
 most expensive ice-cream was the Super
 Triple Choc at 40p. The cheapest ice- 
 lolly was a 'Mr.Men' at 11p. The cafe 
 sold Walls' ice-cream. The most       
 expensive ice-creams here were the    
 Choc 'n' Nut, Strawberry Ripple and   
 Cream of Cornish family packs at 80p. 
 The garden centre sold many plants    
 including herbs such as borage, woad  
 and gold-tipped marjoram. The aquarium
 sold fish and water-life. The man gave
 us some water snails which should have
 been Â£1 for 8.                        </content>
