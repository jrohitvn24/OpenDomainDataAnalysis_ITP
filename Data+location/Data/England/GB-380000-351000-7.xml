		<content>    Kidsgrove Fire Station is today    
manned and has two fire engines called 
appliances.They also have a water      
tanker and a van.They have a tower in  
the yard which is used for training,and
for drying hoses.They have got four    
large appliance bayes for the vehicles.
They have got a social club upstairs   
and downstairs they have offices and   
storerooms.They sometimes have open    
days when they show you around and let 
you climb over the appliances.At night 
the station is unmanned but the firemen
have bleepers to warn them when there  
is a fire or something like that.You   
are'nt at work or when it is night     
time.The fire station is fairly new and
so are the fire engines one of them is 
"X" registered.
