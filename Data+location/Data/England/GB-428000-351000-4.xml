		<content> THE MOST FAMOUS DERBYSHIRE TRADITION. 
 PICTURES ARE CREATED ON A WOODEN      
 FRAME COVERED WITH A THIN LAYER OF    
 DAMP CLAY. THE MATERIALS USED FOR THE 
 DESIGN MUST BE NATURAL, AND MAINLY    
 CONSTITUTE FLOWER PETALS, SMALL CONES,
 SEEDS AND LEAVES. THE WELLS ARE       
 USUALLY GIVEN A BIBLICAL TEXT AS THE  
 IDEA OF CREATING A WELL IS TO THANK   
 GOD FOR LIFE GIVING WATER. VISITORS   
 WHO COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO   
 SEE THE WELLS ARE ENCOURAGED TO GIVE  
 SOME MONEY WHICH GOES TO A CHARITY.   
 13 WELLS WERE PRODUCED IN 1985. THE   
 SPRING BANK HOLIDAY WEEKEND IS THE    
 TIME OF YEAR CHOSEN FOR THE WIRKSWORTH
 WELL-DRESSINGS. A CARNIVAL COINCIDES  
 WITH THE EVENT. THE LOCAL CLERGY TAKE 
 PART IN THE BLESSING OF THE WELLS.    
 THIS TAKES PLACE AT EACH SITE.
