		<title>16HOW HARTHILL HAS CHANGED</title>
		<content> At first Harthill was just the church,
 chapel, school and a few houses.But   
 then the miners moved in and Firvale  
 and Winney Hill were built.Just after 
 the Second World War some new houses  
 were built at Pryor Mede,Doctor       
 Lane,and near the ponds.Then an old   
 farmhouse called South Farm was built 
 around, with a play area at the back. 
 Later the Northlands estate was built 
 near the church on the "Glebe lands". 
 Soon a play area was built next to the
 Blue Bell on Woodall Lane. A lot of   
 work has been going on at the ponds:  
 a new bridge has been built to join   
 the second pond to the first. Our     
 school has been changed recently: our 
 hall has been enlarged, and we now    
 have two classrooms in the main       
 building and four across the yard.
