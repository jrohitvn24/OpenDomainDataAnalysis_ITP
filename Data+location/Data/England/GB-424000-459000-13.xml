		<content> In our area we have two motels. they  
 are "The New Inn" and "The Bay Horse  
 Inn." There is also a public house in 
 Birstwith. It is called "The Station."
  We have a few bed and breakfast      
 places. These are mostly farm houses. 
  We have no camp sites, caravan sites,
 guest houses, cafes, restaurants or   
 boarding houses.                      
  Tourists coming to this area         
 generally stay at camp or caravan     
 sites out of the area or stay in      
 hotels in Harrogate. A few stay in the
 area. They stay at bed and breakfast  
 places or camp in a friendly farmers  
 field.
