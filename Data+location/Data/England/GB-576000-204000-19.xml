		<content> Girls games are usually quiet,like    
 skipping games.They are sometimes     
 played where one person jumps in and  
 they sing a rhyme then another person 
 jumps in,then the other person jumps  
 out.Games like Chain He are played    
 where one person is it and,they have  
 to touch the other people and say     
 Chain He.When the person who is it has
 caught more than three people they    
 make two chains both with two people  
 in them,then carry on like that till  
 the game is finished.                 
 Clothes. Girls and boys both like to  
 wear jeans,tea-shirts.But when we go  
 out we like to wear smart trousers.   
 Pop Music. Pop music is good to dance 
 to,it is also very loud.We use        
 electrictal guitars and drums.The most
 liked pop group in our class is WHAM!!
 and lots of other exciting names like:
 Madona,Duran Duran,Sister Slegde!!!!!!</content>
