		<content> sponsored for Â£10.00 if I swam 25     
 widths, I hoped I could do them. Mum  
 had to count the widths, I hoped she  
 could keep up with us all. When we got
 to the swimming pool without dinner,  
 did'nt have time , I got undressed in 
 the changing room .I dived into the   
 pool in the deep end.I started doing  
 my 25 widths and I did them all, I    
 watched Racheal do 70 lengths but she 
 was'nt sponsored so 4 people watching 
 her gave Â£5.00.Altogether we raised   
 Â£161.00 for a Somerset Hospice.       
 Mum was busy counting the laps and    
 adding up the sponsor money.          
  We finished at 4.00 and took Mrs     
 Francis back to Castle Cary.Then home.
 I made myself a sandwich as that is   
 all I wanted. I watched T.V. At 7.00  
 Pat White picked Racheal and I up to  
 go down there baby-sitting and we     
 slept there. Mum and Dad, Pat and     </content>
