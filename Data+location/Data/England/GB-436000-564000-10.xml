		<title>10THE GARTH PROJECT:S.TYNESIDE</title>
		<content> The Garth Project was started in 1977 
 at the South Tyneside College.It is   
 designed to help the mentally and     
 physically handicapped aged between   
 16-19years.The students come mostly   
 from the three special schools in the 
 town.The Garth Project teaches the    
 students the basic skills to enable   
 them to get a job in                  
 bricklaying,joinery,cookery,gardening,
 woodwork,art,beekeeping and           
 metalwork.Each student trains for a 12
 month period which can be extended to 
 18 months.The students are taught in  
 groups of 30 and are taught at West   
 Garth Village.Before 1977 the grounds 
 belonged to a convent run by the      
 'Sisters Of Mercy.'Although neglected 
 the students soon  had them restored  
 and have since won prizes and         
 awards.At present they are building a 
 pavilion to sell tea and biscuits.    </content>
