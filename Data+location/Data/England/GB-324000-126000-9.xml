		<content>  The church of St.Augustine of Canter-
 bury dates mostly from the fifteenth  
 century.It has been added to over the 
 years,including an Aisle which became 
 a chapel dedicated to St.Margaret and 
 St.Mary.                              
  At one time the church's parish was  
 one of the largest in Somerset.Now it 
 is fairly modest.There are a variety  
 of parishioners,including landowners, 
 tenant farmers,small owner occupiers &amp;
 a number of craftsmen and tradesmen.  
  They hold a service on Sunday for    
 which they get about 30-40 people and 
 a family and pram service on Thursdays
 for which they get about 60 people.   
 About 10 people come to evening serv- 
 ices.They have added a new red carpet,
 kneelers,and new service books.       
  They have had a fire and the parish  
 room is to be rebuilt.                
  They have about 6 weddings a year.   </content>
