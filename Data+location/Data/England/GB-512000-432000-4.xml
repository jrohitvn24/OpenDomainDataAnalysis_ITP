		<title>04 Bilton Families' Lifestyles</title>
		<content>   106 families of children of Thanet  
 Junior School supplied data for a     
 social survey of{Bilton.}             
   75% of families live in private,    
 semi-detached{houses}each with a      
 garage, garden and central-heating. 23
 families did not own a car, 70        
 families had one car, and 13 were 2 - 
 car families. This may be expected as 
 there is little employment within     
{Bilton}itself and people will need to 
 travel to work. To help with{housework
 89 families have an automatic washing 
 machine, 52 families have tumbledriers
 and 24 families have micro-wave ovens.
 81 families own a freezer.The majority
 of families have a refrigerator and a 
 telephone and 105 families share 214  
 televisions.Some of the T.V.'s may be 
 used in conjunction with the 72       
{computers}owned by the families or    
 with the 63 video recorders.          </content>
