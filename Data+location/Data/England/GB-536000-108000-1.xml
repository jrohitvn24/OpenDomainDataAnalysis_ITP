 The land section located to Western   
 Rd Cp school lies west of the county  
 Town of Lewes and parallel to the     
 Brighton/Lewes railway. It is         
 predominantly a downland location with
 a southern, sloping view and is used  
 for corn production, cattle and sheep 
 rearing and incorporates access       
 to the South Downs Way.               
   There are very few houses in the    
 area but those that are belong mainly 
 to the farming community. No other    
 industry is to be found in this       
 sector. It is a site of typical       
 down_land features and possesses      
 aesthetic rather than commercial      
 value.
