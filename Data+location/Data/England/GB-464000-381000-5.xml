		<title>05A FARMER'S LIFESTYLE, RANBY</title>
		<content>  The farmer has been in business near 
 Ranby for thirty years.The farm which 
 had been previously tenanted was      
 bought from the Newcastle Estate.     
  Every day,after an early swim the    
 farmer makes essential telephone calls
 until 8:00am. These days he spends    
 about two-thirds of his time in the   
 office, managing the farm. Because of 
 a slipped disc and the size of the    
 farm he has to employ a secretary     
 to help run the farm.                 
  Though consious of the need to       
 operate profitably, for personal      
 preference, he avoids intensive       
 farming methods except for rearing    
 piglets in farrowing sheds, where they
 are kept with their mothers until     
 weaned for the first 3 to 4 weeks.    
  He is very interested in wild life   
 and makes considerable efforts to     
 preserve it.                          </content>
