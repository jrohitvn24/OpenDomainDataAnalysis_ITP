		<content> People generally travel by car as     
 Public Transport is very limited.There
 is{a Southern Vectis Bus Service No46}
 during the Summer months.This hourly  
 service operates from Sandown to Alum 
 Bay/Yarmouth and return along the     
 Military Road,a stretch of which is in
 our area.Most residents live at least 
 one mile from the nearest bus stop    
 on the Military Road.There would be a 
 possible two mile journey on foot or  
 by car to catch the Newport bus at    
 Chale or Chale Green.{A Post Bus}also 
 runs in this area.It is in operation  
 six days a week(not Sunday)all year   
 round apart from Public Holidays.It   
 makes one journey and return to       
 Newport each day.Instead of the usual 
 bus tickets passengers are issued with
 postage stamps stuck on a card which  
 is then franked by the driver.School  
 children travel by car,taxi and bus.  </content>
