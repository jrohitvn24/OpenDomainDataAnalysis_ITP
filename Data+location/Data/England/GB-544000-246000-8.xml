 ten years ago,in October 1975 to      
 stimulate public interest in the      
 village,promote high standards of     
 planning and architecture and secure  
 the protection and improvement of     
 features of public or historical      
 interest.

 members,organizes a number of annual  
 events.These include a popular garden 
 party in July,a village clean-up,a    
 village walk,talks and excursions.In  
 October 1983 it mounted a major       
 historical exhibition covering various
 aspects of village life,and in April  
 1985 it ran a successful artistic     
 exhibition entitled "Impressions of   
 Whittlesford"
