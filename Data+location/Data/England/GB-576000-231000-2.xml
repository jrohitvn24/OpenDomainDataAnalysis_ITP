		<title>02S.HEDINGHAM A604 AND TRAFFIC</title>
		<content>    Sible Hedingham would not be as it 
 is with out{traffic.}The{A604}runs    
 through the village,and is very busy  
 carrying  all forms of transport.     
 Many heavy lorries use the road to    
 reach the East Coast Docks.           
   Our school road is narrow, and is   
 busy in the afternoons as mothers come
 to collect their children. There is'nt
 a footpath and there is concern about 
 this.                                 
   There is a dairy called Tanners and 
 many milk lorries use School Road.    
 When Rippers and Tanners finish work  
 the{A604}gets busy, and there have    
 been several accidents. There are     
 sometimes jams, particularly in the   
 summer because of seaside{traffic.}   
 It's mostly quiet in Sible Hedingham  
 during the day away from the{A604.}
