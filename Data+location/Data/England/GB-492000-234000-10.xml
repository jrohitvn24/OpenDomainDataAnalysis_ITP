		<content>   Although "fast food" is popular     
 throughout the country, there is no   
 outlet in the villages, so meals tend 
 to be more traditional.               
   "My best food is fish fingers, baked
 beans and chips, but I only eat them  
 once a week.  But it is not good for  
 you.  I've got chickens and I like    
 their meat.  But if you don't bake it 
 right you get an illness.  In the     
 olden days they only had chicken on   
 Christmas Day or very special days.I'm
 glad I wasn't living then. And they   
 only had peas in the summer because   
 they were not ready in the winter.  I 
 like peas a lot.  I know how to cook  
 peas.  All you do is take some peas   
 out of the freezer and put them in a  
 pan of hot water and wait for them to 
 be ready to eat.  When I cook potatoes
 I peel them, put some salt on them and
 put them in the pan." Richard.        </content>
