		<content> Basically home made. Only the         
 irregular Flintham Festivals involve  
 the whole village. The pub,{The Boot &amp;
{Shoe}has harvest suppers, christmas   
 lunches and regular outings for the   
 retired. These may stop after January 
 1986 when the present tennants retire.
 Regular{wine tastings}are held in the 
 Old School and are very popular, food 
 was recently introduced to 'soak up'  
 the effects of the wine! Over the last
 few years Flintham and Syerston have  
 competed against one another at bowls 
 and in quizzes. A{Library van}calls   
 once a fortnight with a good stock of 
 books for both adults and children,   
 who also have their own library van in
 the school summer holidays. Most house
 holds have a television, many have    
 videos and hi-fi systems.
