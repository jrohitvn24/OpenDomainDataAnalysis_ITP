		<title>02Walton Hall,near Ryhill</title>
		<content> Walton Hall is an  eighteenth century 
 mansion in Palladian style set on a   
 small island in a lake which makes an 
 attractive feature of the estate.Other
 interesting features include a        
 mediaeval watergate __ a remnant of   
 the earlier house on this site __ and 
 an early cast-iron bridge which       
 connects house and island with the    
 lake shore.The hall is a listed       
 building and stands amid attractive   
 woodland and parkland.                
 In the early nineteenth century the   
 house was the home of Charles         
 Waterton,the noted naturalist and     
 explorer,particularly, of South       
 America.                              
 The hall is now a country club and    
 hotel offering accommodation and      
 conference facilities as well as      
 recreational activities including     
 squash,fishing and water ski-ing.     </content>
