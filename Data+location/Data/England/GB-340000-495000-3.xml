		<content>{   The Braithwaite Fold Complex       
  On the car park at Braithwaite Fold a
 company wishes to build a{Leisure}and 
{Timeshare Complex.}There would be a   
 leisure pool,ice rink,squash courts,  
 bars,restaurant and 237 flats. This   
 has caused a lot of{controversy,}many 
 people think it would be out of place 
 as it would be as long as the{QE2}and 
 as high as{5 double decker buses.     
 Local traders think it would take     
 trade away from them but the{Tourist  
{Board}think it would attract more     
 tourists.                             
{Friends of the Lake District}think the
 area should be made into a{Country    
{Park.}                                
 Meanwhile the discussions and         
 arguments go on.
