		<content>  My Mum is a teacher in Chorleywood.  
She has to leave home at eight thirty  
to get to school. She usually wears a  
skirt, a shirt, a jumper and           
high-heeled shoes. She usually shops at
lunchtime. She leaves school at twenty 
past three. On her way home she picks  
me up. When she gets home she reads the
paper and marks her books. She cooks   
the family supper at about seven       
o'clock. After that she runs my brother
and myself to an activity such as      
badminton or golf. When she comes home 
she watches the television or she does 
the ironing. She quite often phones up 
one of her friends. Often she takes the
dog for a walk or she does some        
gardening. Sometimes she has a bath in 
the evening. At ten thirty my Mum goes 
up to bed.
