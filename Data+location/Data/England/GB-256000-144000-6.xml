		<content>   There are five churches in the      
 village the oldest being the{Parish   
{Church of St.Peter ad Vincula(St.Peter
{in  Chains)},built originally in the  
 late 13th century,with 18th century   
 additions.The burial ground surrounds 
 the church.                           
   The{Bapist Church},likewise,has its 
 own burial ground.Women's             
 Organisations in both churches are    
 active.The{Methodist Church}has a     
 Youth Organisation as well.The{Roman  
{Catholic Church}which is a modern     
 building,is served by a priest from   
 Lynton.The existence of a{Russian     
{Orthodox Church} and priest in the    
 area is quite unusual.Services are    
 held in part of a private house and   
 also in a formerly disused chapel at  
 Pilton,Barnstaple.
