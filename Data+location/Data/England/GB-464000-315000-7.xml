		<title>07THE RAILWAY NEAR HOBY - 1</title>
		<content> The railway that runs through Hoby    
 valley is not very old.The railway    
 from London,St.Pancras to Leicester   
 that went on to Nottingham or Derby   
 via Syston  junction to the north was 
 built before the line to Melton,via   
 Hoby,had even been thought about.     
                                       
 Soon after a line was planned         
 to go through Melton Mowbray from     
 Peterborough via Stamford, Oakham  &amp;  
 arrive at Syston. This made Syston    
 very important to the L.M.S. Company. 
 So then people travelling from London,
 St. Pancras could go to Melton Mowbray
 &amp; Peterborough.                       
                                       
 Other stations were built between     
 Syston &amp; Melton they were Brooksby,   
 Asfordby &amp; Frisby. All have now been  
 closed down.
