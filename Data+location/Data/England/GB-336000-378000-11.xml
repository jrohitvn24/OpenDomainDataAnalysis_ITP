    A community police officer gets to 
 know the area and the people that live
 there.                                
    He usually travels by bicycle,     
 because if he is in a car he cannot   
 always see people or hear them either.
 The community policeman helps parents 
 by informing them of their children's 
 whereabouts. He also has to tell them 
 if they are troublesome.              
    The police officer that we         
 interviewed had four hobbies; they    
 were gardening, swimming, walking and 
 camping. The policeman has been in the
 police force for 17 years.
