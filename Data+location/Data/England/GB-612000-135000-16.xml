  Saltwood Church was built by the     
 Normans at the beginning of the 12th  
 century.  It was originally built as a
 knave with a chancel.  The chancel has
 been extended towards the East, an    
 the knave has had a tower built at the
 West end of it.  The North aisle      
 has been added since.                 
  The most popular one of these is the 
 Parish Eucharist.  The attendance at  
 the principle service varies a great  
 deal, but it is usually about 120 to  
 150 people.  The church holds about   
 200. _                                
  As we are in the diocese of          
 Canterbury, the arch-bishop should do 
 the confirmations  but as he is very  
 busy the suffragan bishop of Dover    
 does it instead.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
