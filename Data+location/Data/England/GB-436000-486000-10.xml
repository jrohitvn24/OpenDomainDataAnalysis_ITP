		<content> The River Wiske goes through the      
 farm's land,it is polluted.The farmer 
 has never seen a fish in the river and
 his cows won't drink the river water. 
 He thought the river had been polluted
 by the Chicken Factory up river.      
 A disused railway line runs through   
 one of the fields.British Railways    
 stopped using it in 1955.It used to   
 run between Harrogate,Ripon and       
 Northallerton.The fields were divided 
 mainly by hawthorn hedges. We saw two 
 thrushes'nests in one hedge and on our
 way to see the sheep,a yellow         
 hammer,sitting on a fence post        
 whistled at us.
