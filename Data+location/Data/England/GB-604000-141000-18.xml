		<title>18THE VILLAGE OF HINXHILL</title>
		<content>The name Hinxhill is thought to come   
from Hengist Heille, the place of Heng-
ist,a 5th century ruler of Kent.       
There are only 17houses in the village 
and the church is the most important   
building.You enter through a lytch gate
erected in memory of Rev. John Philpot.
It has a variety of carvings made of   
wood.As you enter the church a flood of
yellow light welcomes you through the  
stained glass window at the E. end of  
the aisle.There is enough seating for  
155 so it is only filled on special    
occasions.Residents take it in turns   
to clean and change the flowers every  
two weeks.The nave and chancel are     
Early - English and the date 1633 is   
carved on the timber chancel arch.     
Beside the church is Court Lodge Farm; 
one of the buildings was the original  
Manor of Hinxhill.The present Hinxhill 
Court is built on the old Rectory site.</content>
