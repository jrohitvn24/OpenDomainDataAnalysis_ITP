		<title>11A Day in the Life...a Child</title>
		<content>  Before playtime we did our Maths,and 
 after play we did our English.Then it 
 was time for dinner.I had a school    
 dinner,and today I had chips,sausage, 
 and beans.For pudding it was jam      
 sponge and custard.When I had finished
 my dinner,I played football with my   
 friends.                              
  In the afternoon we practised for the
 Summer Carnival.After last play we did
 games with Mr Richards' class.We could
 either do cricket with Mr Woodward or 
 rounders with Mr Richards.I decided to
 play cricket with Mr Woodward.        
  At quarter to four school finished so
 I went home.I played out with my      
 friends until it was my teatime,and I 
 played out again after my tea.When I  
 came in I had a shower,put my pyjamas 
 on,and went to bed at nine o'clock.
