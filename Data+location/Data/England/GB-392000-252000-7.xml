		<content> Broughton Hackett has a mixture of old
 and new houses and includes a modern  
 development at Manor Farm, which      
 incorporates the conversion of old    
 oast houses and farm buildings into   
 present day homes..Whiteladies Aston  
 is an exceptionally beautiful willage 
 with many thatched houses now in      
 private ownership. Churchill is a     
 picturesque hamlet of old houses with 
 a small number of attractive modern   
 bungalows. All this area has          
 traditionally been the property of    
 some of the great land owning         
 families, the Berkeleys, Coventrys and
 Lyttletons, which may explain why     
 there are only a comparatively few    
 modern housing sites. Further building
 is not envisaged at present.
