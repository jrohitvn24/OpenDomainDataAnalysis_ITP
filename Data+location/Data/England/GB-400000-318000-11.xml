		<title>11Julie's Weekend.</title>
		<content>Most weekends are different for us as  
Dad sometimes works weekends and Mom   
works most weekends. Saturday is the   
only day we can have a lie in. I       
(Julie) get up about 8.00am, play with 
my computer, read a book or watch T.V. 
I sometimes take Mom and Dad a cup of  
tea or coffee in bed. They get up about
9.30am, then we have breakfast, most   
times it's cereal and toast with tea.  
We then go and do the shopping down in 
Rugeley. We come home, Mom tidies up,  
makes the beds and prepares dinner. Dad
usually does odd jobs about the house  
(Which Mom has found him to do) or goes
and does odd jobs on the car. I like   
riding my bike and calling for my      
friends. We go for a ride around up to 
Etching Hill or just around the        
streets. When Mom is working in the    
evening she goes out about 5.45pm and  
my Dad and myself watch T.V.           </content>
