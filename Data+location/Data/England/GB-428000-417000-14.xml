		<title>14HORBURY SATURDAY IN JULY 85</title>
		<content> I usually get up at 9am, go downstairs
 and have a boiled egg for breakfast.  
 Then I put on my red and black        
 leotard, skirt and T-shirt before     
 going to a gymnastics class at        
 Cleckheaton, west of Horbury.  We     
 start at 10am and finish at noon. I do
 somersaults and back flips.  My coach 
 is Mrs Warmby, assisted by Elaine     
 Woodhead.Then we go to the Halfway    
 House  public house, halfway to       
 Ossett, for lunch.  We have roast beef
 and vegetables or chip butties.  We   
 play on the swings and inflatable     
 cushion in the beer garden.  Then we  
 go to my grandmother's in Horbury.My  
 sister Vicki and I play outside on the
 coalbunker.  For tea we have a ham    
 salad followed by strawberries and    
 cream or jelly.  Then I watch Ultra   
 Quiz 85 on TV until I go to bed at    
 10.15 and read.  I go to sleep at 11. </content>
