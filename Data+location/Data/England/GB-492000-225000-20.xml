 Georges Lower School Leighton Buzzard 
 have enjoyed working with the Domesday
 Project. They thank everyone who has  
 helped them in their area. Some final 
 thoughts: "I liked doing the work and 
 going somewhere", "I enjoyed looking  
 for information", I liked drawing     
 pictures for the project best", "I    
 enjoyed making our big book", "I liked
 writing about things", "I liked       
 working with maps", "We enjoyed       
 counting everything", "Cooh what a lot
 of hard work I've done and my hand    
 hurts!".      Goodbye.                </content>
