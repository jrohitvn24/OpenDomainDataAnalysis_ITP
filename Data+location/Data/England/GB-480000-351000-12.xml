		<title>12LIFE ON A LOCAL FARM</title>
		<content> Life on a farm is very different to   
 living in a town or city.On our farm  
 we have cows, chickens, pheasants,    
 working dogs and race horses are bred.
 Crops,for example,potatoes, are grown.
 The farmers have to get up quite      
 early around 5'O'clock. The machinery 
 is usually washed down and the        
 tractors in the fields by 6.The grooms
 feed the horses.I get up at 7 and help
 to feed the cows, chickens,pheasants  
 and dogs.The farmers come home for    
 breakfast at 8 and go out again at    
 8.30.They are in the fields all day   
 except for coming in for dinner.The   
 farmers day usually ends around 6.30. 
 This happens nearly every day except  
 for when there is a hunt or we go to  
 the races.Mr.Snipe is the owner of the
 farm, manor and most of the land      
 around Barnby.
