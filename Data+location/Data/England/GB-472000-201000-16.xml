		<title>16Traffic &amp; Youth:Chinnor etc</title>
		<content>   Chinnor is only three miles from an 
 M40 interchange and traffic from and  
 to  the Motorway is increasing  .     
 Heavy lorries pose particular         
 problems-not just those to and from   
 the Chinnor Cement Works. Small road  
 junctions now take traffic for which  
 they were never designed. One junction
 in particular has been the scene of   
 many accidents in recent years.       
 Demands have been voiced for a Chinnor
 By-pass; even a proposal that the     
 Lewknor interchange be sealed off.    
   The influx of newcomers to Chinnor  
 has meant an expanding teenage        
 population with a consequent need for 
 suitable facilities. Unfortunately,   
 public transport to local towns is    
 limited and 'hitching lifts' is now   
 common amongst these young people.    
 Parents are concerned at the dangers  
 inherent in this practice. (cont)     </content>
