		<content> Our block contains 5 retail shops, the
 only ones in the village. They are{a  
{general store/post office; a          
{newsagent/confectioner; a television  
{dealer; an office_equipment firm and  
{a flooring specialist.}The last two   
 are recent arrivals. The general store
 and the newsagent compete to some     
 extent: e.g. over newsrounds. Both    
 proprietors state they are content    
 with the custom they receive, despite 
 the presence of Tesco's supermarket at
 neighbouring Bar Hill. Both shops     
 employ members of the proprietor's    
 families; the general store has other 
 help as well, and between them they   
 employ eleven 'newsboys'. The TV      
 business opened here in 1952. The     
 proprietor succeeded his father,and   
 hopes his son will soon join him. He  
 sells, rents and repairs mainly TVs,  
 videos and domestic appliances.       </content>
