 -----------------------------------   
 In the South East corner of Dorset    
 near to Poole Harbour you can see the 
 small market town of Wareham with a   
 population of five to six thousand    
 people.  The town is flanked on it's  
 North and South sides by the River    
 Piddle or Trent (North) and the River 
 Frome to the South.  The town is      
 situated on the junction of two roads 
 (A351 and A352) which meet in the     
 middle of the town.  The area of      
 Northport which is half a mile North  
 of Wareham has greatly expanded over  
 the last hundred years from the       
 construction of the London and South  
 Western Railway in 1847.  Since the   
 l950's many new houses have been built
 and a small industrial site is        
 flourishing.
