		<title>04    TRAFFIC SURVEY - A49</title>
		<content> This road is a{main trunk road}       
 connecting tne North of England with  
 South Wales. It goes right through our
 Domesday Area. We decided to spend one
 hour on a typical Friday afternoon in 
 the summer{counting}the amount of     
{traffic}that uses this very busy road.
 We counted 320 cars, 35 vans, 66      
 lorries, 1 coach, 3 motorbikes and 0  
 pedestrians. Of the cars 100 were red,
 23 green, 97 blue, 32 yellow,48 brown,
 25 black, 41 white and 58 were other  
 colours. We may have missed some!     
 After traffic spotting we went for a  
 drink and a packet of crisps at a     
 roadside{snack bar}in a lay-by on the 
 A49. Lots of lorry drivers stop there 
 for something to eat.The lady who owns
 it has got a boy at our school. She   
 opens very early in the morning and   
 closes late at night. We had a nice   
 time.                                 </content>
