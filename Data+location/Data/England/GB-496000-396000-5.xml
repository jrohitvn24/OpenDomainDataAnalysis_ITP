		<content> There are seven shops in the village  
 of Waddingham including the Public    
 House.The other six are the Post      
 Office, Rusling's General Store, The  
 Fish and Chip Shop, The Butcher's     
 Shop The Hairdressers and The Antique 
 Shop.                                 
     The Post Office which is down     
 Silver Street is owned by Mr and Mrs  
 Smith . They sell groceries,          
 stationery,sweets,ices,toiletries,    
 stamps and medical appliances.People  
 say that it was built about 80 years  
 ago.                                  
    Rusling's General Store is opposite
 the village green and is owned by Mr  
 and Mrs Rusling.They sell virtually   
 the same as the Post Office except for
 stamps.It was built about a hundred   
 years ago.We think that these stores  
 are used the most in Waddingham.
