		<title>03Changes in Warwick</title>
		<content> The Warwick area has changed greatly  
 in the last 40 years. 11 new schools  
 have been built many to replace old   
 Victorian buildings, together with 3  
 old peoples homes and 2 new medical   
 centres. Part of the market square and
 adjacent areas have been              
 pedestrianised making life more       
 pleasant for shoppers, as also do the 
 many new shops which have been built  
 in the central area. A new police     
 station has been built on the edge of 
 Priory Park the site of the old police
 station now being occupied by a new   
 local authority office building and   
 car park. Recreation facilities have  
 improved with a new swimming pool and 
 childrens play-ground in St.Nicholas  
 Park. There is also much new housing. 
 However the old open air market is    
 still held in the market square each  
 Saturday.                             </content>
