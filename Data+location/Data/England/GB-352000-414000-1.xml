		<content>The area is immediately to the south of
the Central Lancashire New Town        
Development and three miles to the     
north of the Greater Manchester        
Boundary.It has been bisected by the   
M6 Motorway,which has influenced       
several developments.It lies within the
Central Lancashire grass belt;mid way  
on an East-West axis between the flat  
arable area and the Pennine foothills. 
The relief is gently undulating and    
predominantly rural.The only areas with
any high degree of building            
concentration,are Charnock Richard     
village,where several private housing  
estates have been built during         
thecourse of the last twenty years and 
Eccleston Green,which is a late        
nineteenth century development,centered
on a now-closed cotton mill.
