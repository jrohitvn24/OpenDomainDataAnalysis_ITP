		<title>04JOBS IN LOCAL VILLAGES</title>
		<content>  The majority of villagers in         
 Stibbington and Ailsworth are in paid 
 employment.  There is little evidence 
 of unemployment.  There is a sizeable 
 number of retired people in Ailsworth.
 Types of jobs include a good          
 sprinkling of professional jobs as    
 well as non-professional jobs such as 
 lorry drivers.  The residents of      
 Stibbington tend to work in various   
 nearby villages, whilst most Ailsworth
 people work in either Peterborough or 
 Ailsworth itself.  People in both     
 villages use a car to get to work,    
 especially those in Stibbington where 
 a large proportion of the residents   
 own a car.  In Ailsworth more people  
 are able to walk to work or go by     
 public transport to get to            
 Peterborough.  Stibbington is much    
 less well served by public transport.
