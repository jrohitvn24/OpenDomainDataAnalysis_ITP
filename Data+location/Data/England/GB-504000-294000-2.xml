		<title>02NATURE IN NASSINGTON.</title>
		<content>There is a lot of interesting nature   
in our block.Most of the land is       
farmland so there could be much more.  
The River Nene has lots of water       
plants including lilies,rushes and     
reeds with fish such as eels,pike,     
perch and roach.There are 10 ponds     
with  much life such as daphnia,water  
spiders,and beetles.Some have frogs,   
newts and toads.Small woods,remnants   
of Rockingham Forest,have oak, silver  
birch,elm and hawthorn.Many elms have  
died because of Dutch Elm Disease.     
Hedgerows,mainly of hawthorn have lots 
of rabbits,pheasants and their chicks. 
Birds are nesting busily.There is a    
small owl in the Holm Oak next to      
school.Owl pellets we gathered had     
bones and claws in them.Some villagers 
belong to the Northamptonshire Trust   
for Nature Conservation.They help to   
look after our wildlife.               </content>
