		<title>07BUGTHORPE CHURCH</title>
		<content>      Although the church is not very  
 large it does have on feature which is
 possibly unique. It possesses not one 
 but two chancel arches.  One of these 
 arches is Norman in origin and the    
 second seems to be from the Decorated 
 Period and of the same age as the rest
 of the chancel. It is thought possible
 that alterations may have been taking 
 place to the church when the Black    
 Death struck before the builders had  
 removed the original chancel arch.    
      On the northern side of the      
 chancel traces of an arch can still be
 seen both from inside and outside the 
 church.  Apparently this led to a     
 chapel long since lost.               
      Usually there are about fifteen  
 people in church on Sundays at        
 present. Only one or two children come
 to church.  Last year there were 4    
 funerals 2 christenings &amp; 1 wedding.  </content>
