     The land was sloping slightly with
 some more obvious hills such as in the
 Red Hill area.                        
 (housing)                             
     The area is a suburban,           
 residential part of Southampton,      
 largely owner-occupied, and is a      
 network of roads with a high          
 percentage of cul-de-sacs. This was   
 done to stop passing traffic. The     
 housing was of all types, detached,   
 semi-detached, terraced and bungalows,
 though there was a concentration of   
 each type in separate parts of the    
 area.                                 
 (shops)                               
     There was a small parade of shops 
 numbering about 15 at the junction of 
 two of the main roads. The shops      
 included food shops, and a bank.
