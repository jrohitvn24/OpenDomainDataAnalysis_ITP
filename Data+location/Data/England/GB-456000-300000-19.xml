		<content>{CHILDREN FROM KING RICHARD III SCHOOL}
      Many children seem to enjoy the  
 Saturday shopping trip into Leicester 
 where visits to 'Pizzaland' or        
 'Brucciani's' are much appreciated.   
      T.V. and video recorders are the 
 commonest form of indoor recreation,  
 although a large percentage do help   
 with household chores. Some children  
 have part-time jobs (early morning    
 paper rounds are common) while a few  
 help self-employed parents on Satur-  
 days. Weekends are also used for      
 visits to relatives, which most of the
 children enjoy.                       
      In the evenings girls were happy 
 to meet friends and gossip, while the 
 boys enjoyed playing football. Watch- 
 ing professional sport is not popular 
 because of the high admission cost and
 a fear of violence. Only 1 child supp-
 -orted Leicester City F.C. regularly. </content>
