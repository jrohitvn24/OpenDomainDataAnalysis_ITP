 is built on what was Peatman's farm   
 yard. The present village "Tuck Shop" 
 has replaced the old cobbler's shop   
 remembered as having had a thatched   
 roof and a stable type door. Next door
 was the blacksmith's forge owned and  
 run by a Mr Lilley. Westcliffe House, 
 which is close by, sold home made ice-

 sweet shop on Silver Street, this is  
 now the chemist's shop.

 hairdressing business from a hut on
