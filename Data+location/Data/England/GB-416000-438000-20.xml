		<content>{The Naughty Nuns and their Scandalous 
{Habits:-}In 1305 the prioress of      
 Esholt Nunnery offered her resignation
   {One of her nuns was pregnant!!}    
 What had been going on? It seems that 
 visitors had been invited to spend the
 night in the nuns' cells.Whenever the 
 nuns felt the need to escape their    
 cloistered lives they broke down the  
 boundary wall and went off down the   
 back lane and across the bridge.The   
 archbishop ordered that the lane was  
 out of bounds,that a high wall be     
 built,that the doors were to be locked
 and not reopened until 7am,and that   
 the nuns were forbidden to leave with-
 out a chaperone.The nunnery was       
 finally closed during the Dissolution 
 of the Monasteries by Henry VIII.By   
 then there were only 10 nuns left.The 
 site of the Nunnery was redeveloped in
 1703 by Walter Calverley.             </content>
