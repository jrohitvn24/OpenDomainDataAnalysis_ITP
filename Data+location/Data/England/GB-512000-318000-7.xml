		<content>    This eleven year old's day starts  
 at approximately 7 o'clock when       
 Spencer prepares for school. He is    
 ready by 7.40 when he has his         
 breakfast. He catches the bus at 8.10 
 and arrives at school at about 8.45   
 where he plays with his friends until 
 about 9 o'clock, when school starts.  
    School finishes at 3.30 when       
 Spencer gets back on the bus and      
 arrives home by 4pm. He then either   
 watches television or goes out to play
 with his friends.                     
    On Fridays there is normally a     
 Youth Club with a disco every week.   
 There is a playing field where he some
 times plays football. He also fishes  
 in the local river, the Bourne Eau.

 are cards,'Monopoly' and darts, which 
 he plays well.He watches television a 
 lot, finally going to bed at 9 o'clock</content>
