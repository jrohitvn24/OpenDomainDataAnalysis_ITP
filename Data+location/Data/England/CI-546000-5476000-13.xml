		<content> Sark's average population is 560 but  
 there are people coming and going in  
 the summer, either for work or for a  
 holiday.                              
 There are 24 families with children at
 the Sark School and there are 34      
 pupils, from 5 to 15 years of age.    
 There are approximately 85 children   
 under the age of 16 years on the      
 Island but the last boy and girl born 
 in Sark were in 1968. Now a "Mother To
 Be" has to go to Guernsey. The cost of
 a night's stay in Guernsey Hospital is
 Â£100.00                               
 There are 193 people over 60 years old
 on the island,58% of which are retired
 English people.                       
 The population in the summer is       
 trebled because people come over from 
 England to drive carriages for the    
 tourists who also come and stay.
