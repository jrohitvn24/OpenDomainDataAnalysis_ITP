		<title>06 Danes'Hill</title>
		<content>In 1066 a Danish invasion force sailed 
up the River Ouse and landed at nearby 
Riccall. Local tradition claims that,  
after their defeat at Stamford Bridge, 
Danish warriors were buried under a    
mound in Skipwith Common. The truth    
lies further back in time, as it is    
probably a burial ground of the Ancient
Briton's.There are several tumuli      
dotted around Skipwith Common. In 1754 
a Doctor Burton opened some tumuli. In 
the centre of one of the largest he    
found an almost perfect human skeleton,
locals call the hill by different      
names. Apart from Big Hill (the rest of
the land is very flat), one such name  
is King Rudding Hill. Some say a King  
Rudding is buried underneath. Gun Hill 
and Target Hill are two local names    
connected with wartime activities in   
the area                               
                                       </content>
