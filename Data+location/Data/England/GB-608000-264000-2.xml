We get up on school days between       
7-o-clock and 8-o-clock.  We get washed
and dressed and have breakfast which   
might be something like cereal or      
fried eggs or sausages.  Then we get   
ready for school.  Some of us are taken
to school on the mini-bus if we live a 
long way from school but some of us    
walk or cycle.  We start lessons at    
9-o-clock.  We do maths, reading,      
writing, art, music, or P.E.   In the  
summer we go swimming.  In the middle  
of the morning we have a break         
and play outside.  Lunch time is at    
twelve o-clock.  Some children have a  
school dinner which is cooked in the   
canteen, others take a packed lunch.   
School finishes at 3.15.p.m.  When we  
go home we watch television or go out  
to play.  Then we go in for tea.  We go
to bed at about 9-o-clock.             </content>
