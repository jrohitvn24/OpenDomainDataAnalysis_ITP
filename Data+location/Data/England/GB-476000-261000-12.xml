		<content>Unfortunately, Northampton has not     
achieved a notable reputation for      
artistic endeavour although a number of
individual artists and craftsmen are   
beginning to make a reputation for     
themselves and the town. Every year    
artists have an opportunity to display 
and sell their pictures at the Abington
Park open air Art Exhibition. At about 
the same time each year there is also  
the Northampton Show which takes place 
in Abington Park. Here local artists   
and craftsmen, both young and old, can 
enter for a whole range of competitive 
events from flower arranging to        
embroidery and model making. The       
Northampton Gallery displays a number  
of works of art throughout the year.
