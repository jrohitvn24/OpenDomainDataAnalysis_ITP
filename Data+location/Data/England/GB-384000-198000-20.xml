		<title>20BUILDINGS - MINCHINHAMPTON</title>
		<content>{Minchinhampton Market House}was built 
 in 1700 by Philip Shepperd. In 1913   
 Lt Col H G Ricardo gave it to the     
 town as a gift. Originally there were 
 three market houses in Minchinhampton.
 One of the others was in the centre of
 the town and was replaced by the War  
 Memorial when it was demolished in    
 1919. The site of the third market    
 house is unknown.                     
 The{church}dates from the fourteenth  
 century but it was much "restored" in 
 1842. It has a very good 14th Century 
 window in the South Transept. The     
 church contains brasses and medieval  
 tombs. The graveyard contains         
 table-top tombs.                      
{Park Terrace}was built in 1833 for    
 estate workers of Gatcombe Estate     
 (now the home of Princess Anne),  and 
 was sold at the turn of the century.
