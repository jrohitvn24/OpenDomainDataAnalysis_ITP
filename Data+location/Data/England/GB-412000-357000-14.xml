   This pub was originally a{farm inn  
 on a droving road.The shepherds would 
 probably stop for the night and put   
 the sheep in a neighbouring field     
 while the shepherds stayed and had a  
 meal at the inn.                      
   In those days the beer was served   
 from jugs.                            
                                       
   Later the pub was called The        
 Waterloo after the famous victory.    
                                       
   The pub is now{modernised.}There are
 toilets where the stables were.There  
 is now a children's room and if the   
 weather is fine you can have your     
 drinks outside under a parasol on the 
 lawn.                                 
   The Hartington and District Darts   
 and Domino league also meet here.     </content>
