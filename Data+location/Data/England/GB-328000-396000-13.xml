   Many people living in our area are  
 Christians.Three children in our      
 school are Muslim.They worship in a   
 mosque in Liverpool 8.There are many  
 Christian denominations.The largest   
 group of church attenders are Roman   
 Catholic.They worship at St.Edmund's  
 R.C. Church in Oxford Road.Their      
 priest is Reverend Patrick Sykes.     
   Both St.Edmund's and St.John's have 
 Primary Schools.Each year the pupils  
 from both schools worship together in 
 one of their churches.Some of the     
 children in our school go to Waterloo 
 Baptist Church and others to Kingsway 
 Christian Centre.Most churches have   
 youth organisations and meetings for  
 Bible Study and prayer.St.Edmund's and
 St.John's Churches cook               
 meals each week for elderly people.
