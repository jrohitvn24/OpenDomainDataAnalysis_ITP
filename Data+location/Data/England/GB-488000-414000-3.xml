 prolific designers,between 1820 and   
 1830 for Sir Robert Sheffield,4th     
 Baronet.The house contains some good  
 examples of furniture by Gillow of    
 Lancaster and works of art of the     
 Regency period.Scunthorpe Corporation 
 has set about restoring and furnishing
 the rooms in early 19th century       
 character,helped by contemporary      
 inventories dated 1829 and 1840.To    
 create a'lived-in' atmosphere things  
 such as barriers,notices and ropes    
 across chairs have been eliminated.The

 and newspapers,fruit and flowers in   
 summer and log fires in winter.
