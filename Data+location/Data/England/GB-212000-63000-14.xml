		<title>14Farm Survey by S.Williams.</title>
		<content> We did a survey of 7 local farms and  
 we found that:The farms in this area  
 are mainly dairy with some stock      
 rearing.Three farms are mixed and     
 include beef,sheep and crops.         
  The farms range from 80 to 250 acres.
 The average being 166 acres.          
  A large amount of land is used for   
 grazing and silage.The other crops    
 grown are barley,turnips,kale,fodder  
 beet,potatoes,wheat,linseed and corn. 
  Most of the crops grown are for the  
 farmers animals but some like potatoes
 and linseed are sold commercially.    
  Most of the down land has now been   
 reclaimed.Five of the of the farms are
 family-run and two farms employ 1-2   
 people.Six are tenant farmers and one 
 owns his own farm.The land is owned by
 Boconnoc and Braddock Estates.
