		<content> Sway Welfare Aid Group (S.W.A.G.) was 
 formed several years ago to raise     
 money for the sick and needy and to   
 help with transport to hospital, Meals
 on Wheels, etc. for the elderly. They 
 organise an annual Boule event in the 
 grounds of Sway Place, one of two     
 nursing homes in the village. Sway is 
 twinned with Brettville, a small      
 village near to Le Havre, France. The 
 Mayor of Brettville came to the Boule 
 event in 1984. This year 15 villagers 
 from Brettville spent a weekend in    
 Sway, and a group of Sway villagers   
 are planning a return visit soon.
