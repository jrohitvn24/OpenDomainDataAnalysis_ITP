		<title>13ROADS NEAR WEST WRATTING</title>
		<content>     Only minor roads serve the        
 villages.West Wratting High Street is 
 currently being rebuilt as it was     
 originally built layer by layer onto a
 farm track without proper foundat-    
 ions.The state of the roads is good,  
 considering that they are regularly   
 used by large farm machinery and      
 heavy lorries which tend to break up  
 the edges of the roads. Patching      
 operations take place frequently.     
     Isolated farms are well sign-     
 posted and have easy access. In winter
 snow clearance might be slow as major 
 roads come first. This is usually     
 carried out by the local farmers etc. 
 using special equipment or by the     
 plant hire business in West Wratting  
 (of whom the villagers are quite      
 protective when it comes to           
 complaints).
