		<content> There is a series of{ponds}around     
{Penn;}some form a north to south line 
 between{Penn}and the{Wye Valley.}These
{ponds}were probably formed at the end 
 of the{Ice Age}on the clay soils left 
 covering the{Chiltern chalk.}Some like
{Penn Pond}have been built up and      
 preserved by Man.                     
 There is quite a variety of{wild life 
 in the{ponds}and{streams}in our area. 
 The Moorhens and Mallards were the    
 only birds. The amphibians that we    
 found are Newts, Frogs, Toads and     
 spawn was found. The other animals    
 were Bull Heads, Water Snails, Water  
 Beetles and Leeches.{Plant life}in the
{pond}is mostly Reeds and Rushes.      
 The water in the{Back Stream, River   
{Wye}and{Lagoon}is quite clear and not 
 seriously polluted. The pollution that
 is in the river is man-made rubbish.
