		<content>   The area includes part of the       
 village of{Shobdon}and part of the    
 smaller village of{Byton}in North     
 West Herefordshire.                   
   Both villages are in the original   
{Domesday Book}and also the manor of   
 Milton, now only a large farm on the  
 southern border of the area.          
                                       
  The area is in the hilly area of the 
{Welsh Marches}and is almost entirely  
 agricultural.There are a number of    
 small lakes in the area.              
                                       
    A holiday residential caravan site 
 including club house, tennis courts   
 and a golf course is situated round   
 two of these lakes in Shobdon.        
    Also in Shobdon are two factories. 
 The larger factory produces concrete  
 castings and blocks.The smaller       
 factory makes aluminium window frames.</content>
