       Mrs Bagworth,one of our older   
 villagers, told us about Fenton and   
 how it had changed.                   
      The main attraction of           
 Fenton is the pond. Women in the      
 village used to knit socks for the    
 geese on the local pond and walked    
 them to Nottingham Goose Fair.        
       The church used to be in the    
 middle of the village but Oliver      
 Cromwell burnt half of the village    
 down. Therefore today the church is at
 the end 0f the village. Mr.Whittaker's
 house at the end of Pump Lane used to 
 be a school and there used to be a    
 train track running past Allen's farm.
 Today there is no school or train     
 service in Fenton. Mrs Bagworth said  
 there was a nunnery where Mr.Simon's  
 swimming pool is opposite Pump Lane.
