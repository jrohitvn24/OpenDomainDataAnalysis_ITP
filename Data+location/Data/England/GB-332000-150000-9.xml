		<title>09The Church in East Brent</title>
		<content>                                       
     East Brent has a church known as  
 St. Mary's. It has a spire which was  
 once painted white as a guide to      
 boats. The door is very old and has a 
 very heavy iron ring and handle. All  
 the bench ends are carved and         
 decorated, each one different.One has 
 the initials of Abbot Selwood who had 
 built a house in East Brent. There are
 2 stone statues of priests about 600  
 years old and another lies in the     
 church yard. The ceiling is of        
 decorated plaster.                    
      In the churchyard is a stone     
 cross believed to be 15th century. It 
 was restored in the 19th century as a 
 tribute to Archdeacon Denison, a vicar
 of East Brent in the late 19th        
 century.
