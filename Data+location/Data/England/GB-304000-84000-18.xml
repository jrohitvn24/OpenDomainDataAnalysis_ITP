		<title>18 LIVING IN EAST BUDLEIGH</title>
		<content>BY PIP BUTCHER-SIXTH FORMER aged 18    
East Budleigh seems a typical rural    
community and I don't think I would    
like to have lived anywhere else.The   
problems are connected with social     
facilities and transport.Most clubs are
centred round the elderly-obviously a  
high proportion of the population are  
retired.When I was in my early teens,I 
felt so limited in the choice of shops,
company and leisure activities and it  
was difficult to get anywhere.These    
disadvantages,however, were soon       
outweighed by the benefit of living in 
a small,close-knit community.It is nice
to be known by nearly everyone and have
them interested in what you are doing. 
Living here is not so practical for    
travel to school,work or shops but     
despite this the population is still   
growing-so life here must be good!
