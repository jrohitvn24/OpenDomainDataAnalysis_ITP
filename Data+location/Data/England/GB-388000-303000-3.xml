  In part of our area runs the newly   
built M54 Motorway.  Also in our area  
is a prewar estate which was built in  
the 1910's called Fordhouses which is  
part of Wolverhampton.                 
        Pendeford is a large urban area
situated on the border of Wolverhampton
in Staffordshire.  During the past 10  
years a new estate has been built and  
is rapidly growing larger.  A few miles
out of Pendeford is a large caravan    
park which comforatably accommodates   
60/70 caravans.  Running on the border 
of the caravan park is a canal called  
the Staffordshire and Worcestershire   
Union Canal.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
