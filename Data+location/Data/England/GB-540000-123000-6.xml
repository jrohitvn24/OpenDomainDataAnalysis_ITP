		<title>06FLETCHING SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was opened in 1824. At the 
 turn of the century there were 189    
 pupils ages from 5 to 14 years. Today 
 there are 49 pupils 5 to 11 years and 
 numbers are gradually declining. Two  
 main reasons are, first that Fletching
 is part of a conservation area, very  
 little new building is allowed few new
 families move into the village        
 children grow up and parents grow old 
 in the family houses.                 
 Secondly council house tenants were   
 reasonably mobile moving from village 
 to village for larger accommodetion as
 families grew but since the present   
 Conserative Government offered the    
 houses for sale 80% are now privately 
 owned. Parents remain in the larger   
 houses they now own even when their   
 children have left home. The average  
 age of population grows older with    
 fewer and fewer children.  {D Skan    </content>
