		<title>11A day in the life of Lisa</title>
		<content>  This morning I got up at twenty past 
 seven.Mum was up so I went into the   
 kitchen and put two pieces of bread in
 the toaster for my breakfast.At half  
 past eight I got my bags and coat an  
 kissed mum goodbye and ran for the    
 bus to go to school.                  
  Assembly began at 9.00am.At 9.30am we
 went into class.We began with a       
 notation test and a multiplication    
 test.At playtime Sarah and I sold     
 crisps at the school shop.After play  
 we went to the baths and just swam    
 lengths.After dinner me, Sharon,Sarah 
 and Katie went outside and played     
 fireball. At last play we practised   
 "Joseph and His Technicolour          
 Dreamcoat" for our school concert.    
  At 3.30am I went home and then to my 
 piano lesson.After that I had tea and 
 then my dad and I went to the         
 Salvation Army.    By Lisa Davison.   </content>
