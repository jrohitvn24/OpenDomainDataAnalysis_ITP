		<title>16COPFORD TODAY PART ONE</title>
		<content>  The village of{Copford}is a pleasant 
 place in which to live,a friendly and 
 close{community.}Much of the beauty of
 the village still remains without     
 being spoilt with overbuilding. I     
 think of it as a square shaped{village
 bordered by School road,Church        
 road,Copford Plains and the London    
 road.                                 
  Copford has much to offer for all    
 ages. The Village Hall in School road 
 is used by{many organisations.}For    
 example there is Disco                
 Dancing,Brownies - for the young:     
 Women's Institute and Horticulture for
 the middle and older people:Drama     
 Society for all ages thus there is    
 always something going on.            
  The{church}is an attraction to       
 visitors with many historic features  
 which the community is trying to      
 preserve                              </content>
