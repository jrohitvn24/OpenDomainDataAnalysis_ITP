		<title>18THE RIBBLE MARSHES (CONT)</title>
		<content> The birds depend on the sandbanks,    
 mudflats and saltmarshes for feeding, 
 roosting and breeding. In autumn 50000
 -80000 wading birds arrive from their 
 Arctic breeding grounds on migration  
 south to Africa, or to spend the      
 winter here. 30000 waders stay over   
 winter and are joined by 15000-20000  
 wildfowl, mainly widgeon, pinkfooted  
 geese, teal and pintail. In spring    
 numbers are increased by birds heading
 north to their breeding grounds. 6000 
 pairs of black-headed gulls, 200 pairs
 of redshank and 100 pairs of common   
 tern nest on the marshes, making it a 
 nationally important site. Cattle     
 grazing is very important, balanced to
 ensure the grass is grazed short      
 enough to enable wigeon and geese to  
 feed on it in winter but not too hard 
 during the summer, so leaving nesting 
 sites for breeding birds.             </content>
