		<title>02The People of Stonegate</title>
		<content> About 400 people live in Stonegate.   
 There is a small nucleus of settlement
 around the cross-roads,but the rest of
 the population is well scattered in   
 farms and cottages.                   
 The population structure shows a      
 mixture of age-groups - many families 
 with young children as well as older  
 citizens who have retired to the      
 countryside.                          
 With the exception of farming,there   
 are few sources of employment within  
 the study area.The sewage works are   
 visited regularly by workmen from     
 outside the area. The Bridge Inn,     
 railway station,Stonegate Stores and  
 the haulage contractors employ only a 
 small number of people. Many commute  
 to London,and some work from their own
 homes. There is no significant problem
 of unemployment in the area.
