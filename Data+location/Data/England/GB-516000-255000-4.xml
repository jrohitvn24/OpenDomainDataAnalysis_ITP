		<title>04LITTLE BARFORD SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>  In{Little Barford} there is an old   
 disused school.The school has only one
 large room and it has a little porch  
 with a wooden door.The windows which  
 are high up in the walls are all      
 smashed but we did see a light bulb   
 but mostly there are old crates and   
 bits of furniture.The school is on the
 left handside when you are going to{  
{Tempsford}from{St.Neots}on the Little 
 Barford road.It has an out building   
 which were the toilets and            
 washrooms.The playground is no longer 
 there.It has'nt been used since the   
 war and it is owned by the{Alington   
{Family.}
