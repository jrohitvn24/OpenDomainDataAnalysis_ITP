		<content> There is little employment locally and
 villagers commute to Trowbridge, Bath 
 and other towns. Most clubs meet in   
 the the village hall. Charges range   
 from 90p/hour to Â£65/day. Monthly     
 meetings are held by the Young Wives, 
 Womens Institute, Parish Council and  
 Radio Amateurs. Senior citizens meet  
 fortnightly. Weekly events include    
 playgroups, whist drives, discos,     
 bingo and badminton. Scouts, Cubs,    
 Guides and Brownies meet in the old   
 school. There is no British Legion.   
 Villagers travel to Trowbridge to see 
 the doctor and to obtain medicines    
 from the chemists, one of whom has a  
 home delivery service for the elderly.
 A baby clinic is held weekly in the   
 village hall. District nurses and home
 helps supply the home care services   
 and meals on wheels are available.    
 There is no resident policeman.       </content>
