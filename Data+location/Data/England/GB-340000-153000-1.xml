		<title>01THE LANDSCAPE.</title>
		<content>{The landscape}of this area is one of  
 contrasts. The northern part of this  
 block is the western limit of the     
 Mendip hills. The southern section is 
 low land only just above sea level.   
 The villages of Cross, Lower Weare and
 the town of Axbridge are found in this
 survey block.                         
{The low land}is lush and green. The   
 drainage has been much improved and in
 addition to dairy farming corn is now 
 being grown. When you look out across 
 this area you can see a criss_cross of
 droves and drainage channels.         
{The northern area}by contrast is not  
 as green or lush the land being mostly
 rough grazing and scrub.
