 There was probably a church in Wigmore
 as early as Saxon times, but the      
 present church dedicated to St. James 
 dates from Norman times.  The 14th    
 Century chancel is narrower than the  
 oringinal Norman one.  It was restored
 in 1868 at a cost of Â£270 and the     
 stained glass in the North and South  
 windows probably date from that time. 
 The Nave was restored in 1864.  The   
 pews date from that year.  In 1978    
 when the walls were stripped fro      
 replastering, a herring bone          
 structuring was revealed.  It is      
 likely that the 11th Century building 
 was entirely of this structure.       
 The South Aisle was added in the 14th 
 Century as were the North Chapel, the 
 61 foot tower and the Porch.
