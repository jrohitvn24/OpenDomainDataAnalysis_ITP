		<title>17CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content> In the{school playground}children play
 games such as Hopscotch, Tigs or Pig  
 In The Middle.                        
{Hopscotch}is played on 8 numbered     
 squares drawn on the ground; you have 
 to throw a stone into square 1 and    
 then by hopping or skipping from      
 square to square collect the stone and
 bring it back. You then throw the     
 stone in to square 2 and repeat the   
 game until you miss the square        
 you are aiming at.                    
 In{Tigs}you chase someone and try to  
 "tig" them by touching them; then they
 have to chase the other children.     
 In{Pig In The Middle}three children   
 play together in a line with the      
 middle one trying to catch the ball as
 the others throw it to each other. If 
 the middle one catches the ball, the  
 one who threw it goes in the middle.
