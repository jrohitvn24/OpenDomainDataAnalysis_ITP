		<title>08MINING-PIT VILLAGE OF YORE.</title>
		<content>{LUMLEY}used to be a village of miners.
 Lack of transport meant they walked to
 work over footpaths  crossing farmers'
 fields. They went  dressed for work in
 steel-capped boots,"hoggers"(shortened
 trousers), knee pads  and helmets, and
 carrying their  "bait tins"  and water
 bottles in their bags. They ate  their
 "baits" in the pit.The 3-shift working
 day  operated.  The  night-shift  were
 roused from sleep by the "knocker-up".
 The  pit  buzzer  sounded for work to 
 begin, when accidents happened and at 
 New Year. Returning miners, jet black,
 washed in a tin bath before the  fire,
 their wives picking the pieces of coal
 out of their backs. In  their  leisure
 time miners  played  billiards, tended
 their  allotments,  grew  large  prize
 leeks and raced pigeons, whippets  and
 greyhounds.           {J.Walker.
