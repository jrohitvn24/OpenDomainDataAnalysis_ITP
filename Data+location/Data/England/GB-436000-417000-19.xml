		<title>19Greyhound Racing.</title>
		<content> My dad started racing greyhounds about
 3 months ago, but we have had dogs for
 about 9 months. We had to train them  
 up because if they are not the right  
 weight, they will not run right. The  
 best our dog has run was in a long    
 race and his weight was 66lb. There   
 are long and short races. We train our
 dogs every night and day. We race our 
 dogs at Kinsley, Highgate, Askern and 
 Doncaster. We feed them on food with  
 lots of vitamins or their bones would 
 not be strong and then the dogs       
 wouldn't run right. When the dogs are 
 racing they have to be muzzled so that
 they can't bite when you are putting  
 them into the traps. It also stops    
 them from biting the wire which the   
 hare goes round on. If you wanted to  
 start racing dogs you would have to   
 walk them 2 to 3 miles on a morning   
 and the same every night.             </content>
