 Croda started in 1925 in a disused    
 waterworks making lanolin owned by Mr.
 Crowe and Mr. Dawe. In 1931 they made 
 their first profit and found out      
 lanolin prevents rust. In 1939/45     
 helped out making things in the war.  
 In 1950 opened a business in New York.
 In 1955 they bought Cowick Hall and   
 used it as head quarters. In 1964 they
 became a public company. Now they had 
 40 factories in Britain. From         
 1964-1974 the company became 50 times 
 bigger. Croda also bought other       
 chemical industries. From 1974 to 1980
 it was a bad spell. In 1985 Croda was 
 60 years old. Around 6000 staff work  
 at Croda worldwide. Croda means Crowe 
 Dawe after the people who started it. 
 Croda's profits are now around 20     
 million pounds.
