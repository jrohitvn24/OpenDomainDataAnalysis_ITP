		<content>     Telephones are one of the means of
communication.  There is a telephone   
box in Wetton.  It is opposite Manor   
House Farm.  There is another telephone
box near the Cavalier pub in Grindon.  
Also there are telegraph poles.  So    
people have telephones in their homes. 
     Some of the locals get the 'Parish
News'.                                 
     Most of the people in the area    
have a television.                     
     The people get letters and also   
the Leek Post and Times from the       
postlady.  Papers such as the Mirror,  
Star, etc. have to be bought in        
Waterhouses.                           
     Some of the people have radios.   
     There are some notice boards.     
     Some people have a C.B. in the    
house.
