		<title>03The View from Longwood Tower</title>
		<content>    Steep hills slope down to form the 
 Colne Valley. The view from Longwood  
 Tower is of smoke blackened mills and 
 houses. It is an industrial area. Most
 of the building is in the valley      
 bottom. Some mills are being pulled   
 down as the making of cloth is no     
 longer the thriving industry it once  
 was. Other mills are to let or used   
 for different work.                   
    At the bottom of the valley is Crow
 Lane School. It is made from local    
 stone and stands out as the stone was 
 cleaned when the school was modernised
 a few years ago. Next to the school   
 the railway goes over a long stone    
 viaduct taking things over the        
 Pennines to Lancashire. Running       
 parallel to the railway is Manchester 
 road. It is busy and noisy with       
 traffic.A canal, which has not been   
 used for many years runs nearby.      </content>
