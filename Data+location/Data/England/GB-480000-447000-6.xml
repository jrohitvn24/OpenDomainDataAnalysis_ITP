		<title>06Farming Today</title>
		<content> Years ago farmers could make a living 
 on 100 acres. Now they can't even make
 a living on 700 acres because they are
 putting the wrong crops on wrong land.
 Machinery has changed dramatically.   
 Horses used to pull one furrow plough.
 Now tractors can rule a farm which    
 means that the tractor is the most    
 important piece of machinery and can  
 be used to plough with as many ploughs
 as the tractor will allow. It can     
 power harrow. This is when the        
 implement on the back breaks the soil 
 and it makes a better job than any    
 other implement.                      
 We are cereal and root crop farmers. I
 think farming is going to change in   
 the future to computers. All you will 
 have to do is press a button and a 90 
 acre field will be ploughed. Or robots
 will come into use operating all the  
 machinery.                            </content>
