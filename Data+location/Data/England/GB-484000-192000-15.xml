		<title>15THE MOSQUE</title>
		<content> The{Mosque}in Jubilee Road was built  
 in 1982. It is where{Muslim}people    
 pray. We have to pray five times in a 
 day. Friday is when people usally go  
 to the mosque and pray. The mosque is 
 big. It has a{green dome}with a       
{crescent moon,}and a round pole next  
 to it, with a point. Inside the Mosque
 it is nearly all green and it has four
 rooms. Two of them are small. One of  
 the is for the ladies. We have to take
 our shoes off outside before we enter 
 the mosque. We have to wash our feet  
 up to our ankles and our hands and our
 face.                                 
  {Eid}is a day of celebration at the  
 end of the{month of Ramadan,}When     
 Muslims fast. We wear our best clothes
 and go to pray in the mosque. Families
 get together to celebrate Eid and     
 exchange presents.
