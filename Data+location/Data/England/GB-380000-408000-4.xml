		<title>04 A TYPICAL DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I got up at 7.30am in the morning.I   
 dressed, washed, and made breakfast.  
 After my tea and toast, I combed my   
 hair and took my little sister to     
 school with me. On the way I met a    
 friend and we all walked together.    
 When the bell went at 8.50am we       
 followed Mr.Pilling our teacher. He   
 called the register and then we lined 
 up for assembly.                      
 After assembly we had hymn practice   
 until break at 10.30am. English was   
 next and lasted until lunch at        
 12.00am. We carried on with our       
 English after lunch until break at    
 2.30pm. Mr.Pilling read us a story and
 then we changed for P.E. we played    
 "tig-ball" and then it was home time  
 at 3.45pm, but before we left         
 Mr.Pilling gave us all a letter about 
 the{Alton Towers}trip. I rushed home  
 and then went to the{mosque.          </content>
