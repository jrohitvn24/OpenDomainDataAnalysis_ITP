		<title>13 WHIPPET RACING-contd .</title>
		<content>  When the pup has been vaccinated and 
is lead trained, you can start taking  
it out  to the race track,so it can get
used to the noise of the traps and the 
barking of the dogs.The best way to get
a Whippet interested in the rag is to  
stand him behind the race traps and let
see what is going on. If he pulls he is
eager and interested. The muzzle-a     
light wire,fastened by a leather strap 
round the neck,should be put on for 10 
minutes 6 times a day until it is used 
to it.                                 
  At 6 months you can ask on race days 
for a "run-up",which means that you    
muzzle him, hold him until the rag     
moves and let him go.The rag or lure is
an old car starter motor,which is      
connected to a battery and has a drum  
on to keep the string attached while   
its moving at speed.Now you are ready.
