		<content>  The Tiverton{railway line}was first  
{built in 1848.}It was used until{1967 
 when it was{closed down.}For the next 
 18 years it was just used as a{public 
{footpath}and was allowed to become    
 overgrown with grass and trees. This  
 year however a new use has been found 
 for part of the old railway line. The 
 section from the Tiverton hotel to Old
 Blundells Garage is going to be used  
 for part of the new{Eastern           
{Distributor road.                     
   Another area of Tiverton which has  
 seen great change is the{Grand Western
{Canal.}It was first{built in 1814}and 
 was used for transporting limestone   
 eastwards until{1924.}Today the canal 
 is used for{barge trips for holiday   
{makers.}The barges are pulled slowly  
 in the traditional way by horse from  
 the canal basin.
