		<title>05A day in the life of.....</title>
		<content> A working mother in Hurworth - awake  
 at 7am, family up soon after.We make  
 our own breakfast and wash up and tidy
 the bedrooms, and out to school and   
 work at 8.30 am. I drive 4 miles to   
 the office where as a Secretary I put 
 in a busy day typing, in telephone    
 enquiries, appointments, banking,     
 accounts and everyday problems.I break
 for lunch at 12.30 pm and walk to the 
 shops for groceries.I finish work at  
 4pm and travel home to start the      
 evening meal; while eating we chat and
 exchange news of the day.House work   
 must then be done,the family perhaps  
 out at Karate, keep fit, swimming,    
 playing or gardening.After 9pm,a      
 chance to read, watch television have 
 a chat with my husband, finally before
 bed, lunches to be packed for the next
 day, and to bed at 11pm.
