		<content>    There is only one bus service in   
 this area which runs twice a week to  
 Barnstaple.Therefore a car is         
 essential and nearly every family has 
 one at least.                         
    The roads are very narrow and      
 all have parts where you cannot pass  
 oncoming traffic without having to    
 back into a passing place.Visibility  
 is very poor due to high hedges and   
 the winding nature of the lanes.      
    The roads are nearly all lower than
 the surrounding fields partly due to  
 the digging away and leveling in the  
 past when the roads had no surfaces.  
     This is an area where even 30     
 m.p.h is too fast to travel.
