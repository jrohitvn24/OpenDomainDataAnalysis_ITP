{My dad}gets up at 4.15am. He gets his 
 breakfast and sets off for work in his
 car. He goes to{Ilford Post Office}and
 collects the large van and then he    
 goes to the{Romford Post Office.}He   
 arrives there at 5 o'clock. He sorts  
 the{letters}and{parcels}for his round,
 puts them in his van and then sets off
 with another man. First, they deliver 
 the parcels by van and then they park 
 the van and deliver the letters to    
 each house on foot. Sometimes the     
 weather is bad and it makes him feel  
 miserable. He gets back to the depot  
 by about 1O o'clock. He finishes off  
 his work and at 11 o'clock he leaves  
 for home.
