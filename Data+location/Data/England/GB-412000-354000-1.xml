used just as commonly.)                
     The village lies to the west of   
the beautiful Dove Valley.  It is the  
home of David Knox - M.P. for the North
Staffordshire Constituency.  Its       
population is diverse in its           
occupations and interests - farmers,   
civil engineers, a member of the Royal 
Observer Corps and quite a sizeable    
community of artisans and craftsmen and
women.                                 
     The 4kms of river which flow      
through the area contain some of the   
finest scenery - Shining Tor and       
Milldale.  To the east of the river    
lies Derbyshire, the main              
Ashbourne-Buxton road, A515 and the    
edges of Alsop-en-le-Dale.             
     The whole area is steeped in      
history - noticeable from its many     
tumuli and lows.                       </content>
