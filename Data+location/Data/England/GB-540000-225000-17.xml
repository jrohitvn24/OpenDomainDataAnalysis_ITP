		<title>17TWO PUBLIC HOUSES</title>
		<content>  There are two pubs in the village the
 Star and the Brewer Tap whcih is just 
 over the road from the Brewery.       
  The Star is three or four hundred    
 years old.As well as selling many     
 kinds of beers, spirits and soft      
 drinks they also serve meals and      
 snacks eg salads, sandwiches, sweets  
 and crisps.They also have an off      
 license so that people can buy drinks 
 there to take off the premises.       
  The bar is all one room although     
 there is a little place that has been 
 sectioned off as a little             
 restraurant.At the other end of the   
 room is a huge fireplace where there  
 is always a log fire burning in       
 winter.There is also a dart board and 
 a fruit machine.                      
  Most of the customers are local but  
 sometimes people passing by go in.
