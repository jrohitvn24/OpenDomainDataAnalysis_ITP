		<title>16THE CATTLE MART 2/2</title>
		<content> The cattle mart in Tow Law has had    
 over 100 years of trading.            
{Store cattle}sales are held in Spring.
 These animals are bought for re-sale  
 at other marts, or for fattening.     
{Suckler cattle}sales are held in      
 Autumn. Suckler calves stay with their
 mothers until weaning; shortly before 
 they are sold.                        
 The{Autumn Lamb Sales}of Swaledale and
 Mules (crossbreed) are very busy      
 times. They are held during September.
 The lambs are sold to farmers of      
 lowland farms, many of whom come from 
 the Shrewsbury area, for wintering.   
{As a guide, a sale during May 1985 had
{331 ewes and lambs, 294 store cattle  
{and 18 breeding cattle (including a   
{Charolais bull) on offer. Average     
{prices were 102.2p per kilo for       
{heifers and 217.9p per kilo for lambs.
