		<title>15Burton Pidsea Carnival 1985</title>
		<content>      The Carnival was held this year  
 on Sunday July 14th. It began with the
 parade of floats led by the Carnival  
 Queen, Joanne Marjoram.               
      For the first time a shield was  
 to be presented for the Best-Dressed  
 Float. This was won by the School's   
 float - The Burton Pidsea School      
 Circus.                               
      There were lots of stalls and    
 other attractions. There were         
 mini-motor bikes and swing-boats, an  
 army assault course and target        
 practice and there was music and a    
 Cafe. There were lots of things to see
 and lots of things to be won.         
      The biggest attraction was the   
 horses. Apart from the showjumping,a  
 lady called Jane, from Beverley, did a
 musical riding display.
