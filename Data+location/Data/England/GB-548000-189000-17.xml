		<title>17HAVERING'S HISTORY</title>
		<content>  Most of Havering was once part of the
 Royal Liberty of Havering_atte_Bower. 
 Havering palace was once visited by   
 royalty.This led to a charter being   
 granted by King Edward IV in 1465     
 exactly 500 years before the London   
 Borough of Havering was formed.       
  The charter gave residents more      
 freedom hence the use of the word     
 Liberty.                              
  A map of the district was published  
 in 1618 and another map of details in 
 1771 shows the area was then mainly   
 rural.                                
  However,this century has seen the    
 local population soar from just 22,625
 in 1901 to virtually a quarter of a   
 million people in 1965_the year of    
 Havering's birth.The population has   
 not risen from this figure            
 substantially in the past 20 years.
