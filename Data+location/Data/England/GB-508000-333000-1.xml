		<title>01A GENERAL VIEW OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> Most of the block is agricultural land
 but there are parts of three villages-
 Billingborough, Horbling and          
 Threekingham. The major crops are     
 cereals because the land is flat and  
 open and working it is easy. There is 
 little wooded land and no major rivers
 or lakes.The land drains into the     
 dykes constructed many years ago when 
 the land was reclaimed. Billingborough
 is the largest village providing the  
 main shops and services, schools and  
 employment.Residents of the hamlets of
 Stow and Birthorpe travel to          
 Billingborough to take advantage of   
 the services.There are several        
 buildings of interest in              
 Billingborough and recently a museum  
 opened in the village.The area has no 
 major road networks.The atmosphere of 
 the block is that of a quiet rural    
 area.                                 </content>
