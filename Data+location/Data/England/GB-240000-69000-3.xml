		<content>       The  villages  in  our area were
 not  on  a  map  drawn  in  1865. They
 owe their existance  to the working of
 the copper mines  of the  late 1800's.
 Gunnislake,  was built  because of the
 Devon Great Consols mine  on the other
 side  of the river, where the land was
 owned by  the Duke of Bedford.  He did
 not want to lose his pheasant coverts,
 so  he would not  allow  houses  to be
 built  on his land.  So the miners had
 to build  a village, which  was called
 Gunnislake, on the Cornish side of the
 river  (a gunnis is a  worked-out part
 of  a  mine).  Drakewalls,  St.  Ann's
 Chapel and Albaston  really  form  one
 large village  built around old mines.
 Higher and  Lower Metherell, once only
 scattered  farms,  are  now  two small
 villages. In all the villages, as well
 as  old cottages, there are  now  many
 modern bungalows.                     </content>
