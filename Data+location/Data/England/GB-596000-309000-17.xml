		<title>17A PUPIL'S DAY IN TOFTWOOD</title>
		<content> My name is Helen Woodward and on a    
 normal school day I get up at 7.00    
 a.m. and by 7.15 a.m. I am washed and 
 dressed. By 7.30 a.m. I am downstairs 
 cooking breakfast for all the family, 
 normally bacon and egg or boiled egg. 
 At 7.45 I have finished my breakfast  
 of breakfast cereal and my family are 
 eating theirs. At 8.00 a.m. I am ready
 for school and by 8.15 a.m. I am on a 
 3 mile journey to school by car from  
 Toftwood to Dereham Northgate High    
 School. I get to school at about 8.30 
 a.m. and by 8.45 a.m. I am talking to 
 my friends who have arrived.          
 The bell goes at 9.00 a.m. and I line 
 up for 'tutor time' when we read or   
 talk. Next came German, we were in    
 there until just after 9.45 a.m. we   
 started the next chapter of the text  
 book by listening to a tape. By 10.00 
 a.m we were in science.               </content>
