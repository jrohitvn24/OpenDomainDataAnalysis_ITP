		<title>11Frant Railway Station</title>
		<content>  Frant Station is an attractive stone 
 building.  Lord Camden had it built   
 this way when the railway came through
 his land{100 years ago.} They had to  
 make a new platform because the new   
 diesel trains were too high up, so    
 women with tight skirts could not     
 get on the trains.   Every day 21     
 passenger trains use the line, but    
 only ten stop.  The first train comes 
 down at 5.30.  It drops the{newspapers
 at all the stations, and returns to   
 London later.  One person works a     
 split_shift 0630-1430.  There is      
 nobody later to collect the tickets   
 of commuters and others returning     
 from London.  No trains stop at the   
 weekend.  For{electrification}the     
 track along the Hastings line has to  
 join to get through{narrow tunnels.   
 The{station is being altered}to take  
 8-coach instead of 6-coach trains.    </content>
