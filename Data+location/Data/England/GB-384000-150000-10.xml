		<title>10WESTBURY MAJORETTES</title>
		<content>   Westbury Majorettes are a group of  
 girls who march/dance to music.  They 
 travel to other towns to perform in   
 carnivals, competitions and other     
 social gatherings.  The younger girls 
 are in the Junior Troupe.  They       
 practice every Monday in the Youth    
 Centre.  The older girls are in the   
 Senior Troupe and they practice in the
 Paragon Hall.  The mimimum age for    
 membership is 6; promotion to the     
 Senior Troupe is a combination of     
 merit and age.  The uniform consists  
 of a green tunic, hat and sash.  The  
 girls carry a baton which is thrown   
 and twirled during the routines. Merit
 and service badges are worn on the    
 sash.  The Majorettes travel to events
 in their own bus the furthest trip in 
 recent months was to Cardiff but more 
 usually they visit local towns in     
 Wiltshire and Somerset.               </content>
