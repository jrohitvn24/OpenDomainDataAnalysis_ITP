		<title>03  Martinstown Village.</title>
		<content>   Martinstown is a pretty village of  
 about 500 inhabitants, three and a    
 half miles west of Dorchester.Maiden  
 Castle lies on its boundary.Most of   
 the land is agricutural and many of   
 the people living in the village find 
 employment on the farms.              
   Most of these are dairy farms and it
 is a common sight to see cattle       
 grazing in the fields and the milk    
 tankers doing its rounds along the    
 lanes.                                
   In the centre of the village is the 
 beautiful church of St.Martins,       
 looking out onto the village green and
 the one main road which follows the   
 stream.                               
   Close by is the only shop and Post  
 Office, with the Brewers Arms further 
 along.There are twelve old thatched   
 cottages which nestle around St.Martin
 s,the oldest part of the village.     </content>
