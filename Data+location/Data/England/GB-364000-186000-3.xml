		<title>03HISTORY OF TYTHERINGTON</title>
		<content> Tytherington is an{Anglo-Saxon}name   
 meaning 'people of the Tytheras farm  
 or village'.                          
 Flints suggest that people were there 
 before Saxon times. There are also    
 remains of an{Iron-age}fort.          
 Some large farm-houses were built in  
 the 16th and 17th C by wealthy        
 farmers and cloth merchants.          
 In the 19th C{farming}was the main    
 occupation as shown by Kelly's        
 Directory, 1875. In 1872{quarrying    
 started in the area.                  
 Tytherington also had a railway       
 station on the Thornbury branch, and a
 board school for 120 children.        
 Some modern houses have been built in 
 the 20th Century. No large scale      
 development. Tytherington has managed 
 to keep its village character.        
 There is as yet no local history      
 group.                                </content>
