		<content>  My favourite hobbies are swimming and
 watching television.                  
                                       
{SWIMMING                              
  I am quite good at swimming but I    
 cannot do the breaststroke.Our local  
 baths are called Adwick Leisure Centre
 and St.James.I usually go with a      
 friend.I have a badge for swimming a  
 length and two certificates.          
                                       
{TELEVISION                            
  I like watching comedy acts and      
 detective programmes.The comedy is    
 good because there is sometimes       
 violence and also new jokes.Some of   
 the comedy acts are made to look real.
 The detective programmes are really   
 good because I like the way they      
 search for clues and solve the        
 mysteries.
