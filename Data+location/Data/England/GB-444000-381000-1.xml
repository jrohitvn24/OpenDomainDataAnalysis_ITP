		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW -WALES AREA.</title>
		<content> This area contains three small        
 villages,Beighton,Wales,and Killamarsh
 with farmland and industrial estates  
 lying between them.Wales and Beighton 
 are in South Yorkshire.Killamarsh is  
 in Derbyshire.We are situated about 8 
 miles from the city of Sheffield.     
 Rotherham and Worksop are handy places
 for shopping too.In recent years      
 people have been moving out of the    
 cities and coming to live in places   
 like Wales.There are many new families
 who live here and work in the cities  
 but there are still old families here 
 too.This village was once a large     
 mining community, but the recent pit  
 closures and the coming of new        
 families has changed this.Rother      
 Valley park is at the edge of this    
 village.It is a new park with lots of 
 activities.
