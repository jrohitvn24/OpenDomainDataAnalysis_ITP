		<content> Manufacturing industry has almost     
 disappeared.There are some firms      
 producing springs but many of these   
 are in decline,cutting staff and      
 scrapping apprenticeships.An exception
 to this is a firm producing business  
 stationary which employs 700          
 people.The District Hospital (1920    
 workers)and Sandwell Council (1900    
 workers)are the two largest employers 
 in the area.Both employ men and women 
 as full and part time workers.Other   
 people work in local shops and in the 
 main shopping centre.Some work in the 
 twice weekly market.School leavers    
 often have difficulty finding work and
 many join Government schemes to gain  
 work experience.Several local firms   
 recruit from such schemes.Adult       
 unemployment averages 15% in a        
 population of 300,000.Most employers  
 accept union membership.              </content>
