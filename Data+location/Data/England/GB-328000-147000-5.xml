		<title>05ST. ANDREW'S CHURCH.</title>
		<content>                                       
  There has been a church on the site  
 of St. Andrew's Church in Burnham     
 since before 1316 when the present    
 church was built. It is called St.    
 Andrew's because it is in the diocese 
 of Wells and because it is right next 
 to the sea.                           
                                       
  The tower on the church leans        
 slightly, much to the alarm of        
 visitors, who often telephone the     
 vicar to inform him about it, but as  
 it has been leaning since very shortly
 after it was built and has not moved  
 since we are sure that it is safe.    
                                       
  There are some beautiful statues in  
 the church which were designed by Sir 
 Christopher Wren for Westminster      
 Abbey. They were carved by Grinling   
 Gibbons.                              </content>
