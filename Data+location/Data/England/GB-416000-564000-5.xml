		<title>05The River Tyne;Leisure</title>
		<content>   In recent years the River Tyne has  
 been cleaned by restricting the       
 liquids which factories and others can
 discharge into the river.Salmon are   
 steadily increasing,although they will
 never be as prolific as in 1800,when  
 1600 salmon were netted in one tide.In
 the last 3 or 4 years a seal has been 
 seen regularly in the river,as far up 
 as Wylam.Its favourite spot seems to  
 be the ramp at the University Rowing  
 Club at Newburn.This year 2 seals were
 observed.                             
   The Tyne is very popular for leisure
 activities;several children at Newburn
 First School keep their horses in the 
 stables north of the bridge.The       
 children have observed rowing;water   
 skiing;speed boats;sailing dinghies;  
 canoeing and fishing on the river at  
 Newburn.Various schools and the       
 University have club houses there.    </content>
