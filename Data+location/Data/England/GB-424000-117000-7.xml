 the 16th of Febuary 1944.Extract from 
 H.M.I.report 1936.This school became a
 junior department in 1934.Congestion  
 in the main room was relieved and more
 effective training became possible.The
 discipline is now good.The children   
 are on friendly terms with their      
 teachers who have done much to make   
 the classrooms attractive.On the whole
 the school is in a promising condition
 in spite of broken attendance due to  
 epidemic sickness and to unusually    
 large numbers of admissions and       
 withdrawls.
