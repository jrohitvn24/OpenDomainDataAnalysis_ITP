		<title>09UCKFIELD'S INDUSTRY 4.</title>
		<content>    Although there are one or two      
 other industrial sites in the         
 town,only one really qualifies as an  
 industrial complex,namely the         
{Ridgewood Industrial Park}situated    
 just south of the town.The site is    
 sub-let by an engineering company and 
 provides accommodation for a concrete 
 mouldings factory, and a number of    
 one-man service industries.           
   The questionnaire also revealed a   
{male dominated work-force}although a  
 number of women were employed in      
 electronics.                          
   Finally,despite a growing town      
 population, most of the replies       
 indicated a large proportion of the   
 workers{commuted}into Uckfield from   
 surrounding areas.
