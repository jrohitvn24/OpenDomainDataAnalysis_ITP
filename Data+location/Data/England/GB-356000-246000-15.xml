		<content> A church fete is held every year in   
 Felton or Preston Wynne.  The proceeds
 are divided between the two churches. 
 Both churches have held a flower      
 festival during the past two years.   
 Bingo meetings are held regularly at  
 Burley Gate Village Hall as money     
 making functions.  There is an annual 
 clay-pigeon shoot to raise funds for  
 the football club in Preston Wynne.   
 Each year there is a horse event in   
 which teams of horses compete over a  
 cross country course built by North   
 Hereford Hunt on the land of Court    
 Farm, Preston Wynne.
