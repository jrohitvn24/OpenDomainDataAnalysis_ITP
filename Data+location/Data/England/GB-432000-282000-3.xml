		<title>03FOLESHILL FESTIVAL</title>
		<content>{by Aseem Hashmi aged 10.}Every year   
 all the primary schools do a festival 
 in the Foleshill and Little Heath     
 area. Sometimes there are bands       
 playing and the schools dress up as   
 characters from stories or sometimes  
 the children dance on lorries or do   
 fashion shows. People call the        
 festival a carnival. The traffic is   
 usually stopped. A lot of people stand
 at the side to watch the carnival go  
 by.Usually after the carnival there is
 a big fair in the park. This festival 
 always happens in the summer.I have   
 been involved in this festival in the 
 year of 1983. Our school was acting as
 the characters from the story Anansi  
 and the Jar of Bees. I was a bee in   
 that festival. For half of the time I 
 walked it and for the other half I sat
 on the float. There will be a         
 Foleshill Festival on June 22nd 1985. </content>
