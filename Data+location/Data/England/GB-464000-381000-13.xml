		<title>13THE PRISON, RANBY</title>
		<content>   Construction work began in 1970 and 
 the prison, which holds approximately 
 150, was opened on December 12th 1971.
   The prison stands just to the north 
 of the A620, lying parallel with the  
 'Ranby straight'. It has modern       
 buildings, surrounded by a high wire  
 fence, but does not have the          
 formidable appearance of top security 
 prisons. Within the prison            
 considerable efforts are made to      
 educate and re-educate the inmates. It
 employs a large number of warders and 
 ancillary staff, so making an         
 important contribution to the economy 
 of the area.
