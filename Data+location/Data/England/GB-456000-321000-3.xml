  {Prestwold Hall}dates from the early 
 18th century and stands in 2500 acres 
 of land. It is an imposing building   
 often admired by motorists on the     
 Loughborough to Melton Rd.            
 The Hall and Estate are owned by      
 Mr.S.J.Packe-Drury-Lowe. He employs 9 
 men to farm his land, all of which is 
 arable. One full-time gardener, aided 
 by two part-timers look after 20 acres
 of formal and informal style gardens. 
 Contained in the Estate are 5 flats (3
 are in the house), 2 lodges, a        
 gardener's cottage and a laundry      
 cottage. Prestwold Church stands in   
 the Hall grounds and is used for      
 services once a month.
