		<content>{Welshampton}is a small village on the 
 North boundary of Shropshire and has a
 population of about four hundred      
 people.                               
 There is a farm shop,a general store,a
 post office,a church,an old           
 Vicarage,two garages;both selling     
 petrol,a parish hall and a chapel.    
{Welshampton}is built on a point where 
 the B5063 road meets the A495 in a    
 fork.There have been at least two     
 accidents on roads in the village     
 recently.                             
 The area is mainly agricultural but   
 some people work in nearby towns.     
 There is quite alot of property for   
 sale in the village at the            
 moment,possibly because there is no   
 mains sewerage facilties only septic  
 tanks.Future development is limited by
 the lack of available building.
