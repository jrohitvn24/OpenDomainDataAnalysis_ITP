 Mrs. Reist began educating her        
 daughter when she reached school age  
 in 1924. Shortly afterwards children  
 from outlying farms joined the        
 classes, but the school only had a few
 pupils at first. In 1933 Mrs. Reist   
 moved to Heath House on High Street in
 Bolsover and the establishment became 
 known as{Heath House School.}The      
 lessons were only conducted in the    
 mornings (9-1) and there were never   
 more than 10 children at the school.  
 The schoolroom was at the front of the
 house with one table for Juniors and  
 another for Infants (age range of the 
 school was 5-11). In 1944 the         
 establishment was registered as a     
 school, therefore school milk had to  
 be provided and the school was open to
 inspection. The school closed in 1964.</content>
