		<content> The fear of nuclear war is constant   
 but usually unvoiced. Most days       
 aircraft from the nearby USAF and RAF 
 airfields fly overhead, a constant    
 reminder of an uncertain future.      
                                       
 Reduction in government support for   
 local authorities puts pressure on the
 rates for domestic and commercial     
 premises, and highway maintenance and 
 education suffer (see Education).     
 Imminent rate increases of up to 30%  
 will affect most people in this area. 
                                       
 Continuing high rates of unemployment 
 in the country generally are less of a
 problem in this area with its small   
 population.                           
                                       
 The safety of children on roads used  
 by heavy farm traffic and weekend     
 visitors causes concern.              </content>
