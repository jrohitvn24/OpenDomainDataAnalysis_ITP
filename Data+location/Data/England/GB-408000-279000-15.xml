		<content> The majority of homes in this area    
 were built between 1930 and 1945 and  
 were planned to include large gardens 
 built alongside spacious boulevards.  
 The rest of the area is mainly made up
 of council houses built during the    
 twenties and thirties. In common with 
 the other parts of the area, these are
 laid out in spacious tree-lined       
 thoroughfares.
