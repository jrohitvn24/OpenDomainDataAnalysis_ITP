		<content> The family living at home consists of 
 Mr.&amp; Mrs. Green, Francesca and Rachel,
 the 3rd and 4th daughters. Mr. Green  
 is 41 and a metal broker. After rising
 his wife drove him to Little Chalfont 
 and Latimer station to catch the train
 to Aldgate.  He arrived 10 minutes    
 late to find the tin market was quiet.
 At 10.30 he had an appointment with   
 his solicitors, which lasted 1 hour,  
 after which he went to the London     
 Metal Exchange on business. He had    
 lunch in the West End with the        
 Assistant Buffet Stock Manager of the 
 International Tin Council. He spent   
 the afternoon at the Metal Exchange   
 and then returned to the office.  He  
 returned home, had supper, played golf
 and watched TV before going to bed.   
 Mrs. Green, who is 45, spent her day  
 washing, doing housework &amp; shopping.
