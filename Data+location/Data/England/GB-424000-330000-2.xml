		<title>02A DAY IN THE LIFE OF GWYNETH</title>
		<content>                                       
 The day is Tuesday and at 7.2Oam., my 
 alarm goes off because it is time to  
 get up. I decide what to wear first,  
 then get dressed and have a wash. I go
 downstairs and have a poached egg for 
 breakfast.  I always go to the porch  
 of my house to see if I have any      
 letters from my friends. Then I set   
 off for the Primary school which      
 starts at 9.OOam. and finishes at     
 3.3Opm. At school we have a variety of
 lessons and sometimes we go out for a 
 game of rounders. I don't have any    
 homework yet so usually when I get    
 home, I watch television or play on my
 computer before tea. After the family 
 has eaten, I often go to a bowls match
 with my mum and dad or go out to play 
 with my friends.
