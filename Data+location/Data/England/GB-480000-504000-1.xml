 The pub bar is{200}years old. The best
 day for selling is{Egton Show}day,    
 because there are a lot of people     
 around. The pub was first owned by the
{Foster}family.                        
                                       
 The pub used to be a farm and they    
 grew everything. They even brewed     
 their own beer !                      
                                       
 They get their food from{Cheshire,    
{Manchester, York}and{Sleights.}They   
 came to{Egton}because the business was
 for sale and they liked the building. 
                                       
 The pub was built in{1887,}probably by
 someone local. When{Egton}was a Market
 the owners used to make{60}breakfasts 
 a day !
