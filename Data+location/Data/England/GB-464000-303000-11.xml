		<content> Where we live on TLE there are quite a
 few clubs.There is a BMX club where we
 can have races on our bikes.Quite a   
 lot goes on at the community centre.  
 There is one section especially for   
 old folks and my grandad goes to it.  
 It is called the Wednesday Club.At    
 this club they cards and dominoes etc.
 They can have cups of tea and         
 biscuits. My grandad  is on the       
 committee and they organise trps to   
 the seaside for the old folks.Ithink  
 that is nice.                         
 At Easter and in the summer there are 
 play schemes, but I don't go there    
 because older kids pick on you. Next  
 to our school is the Boys Club, but   
 that is rough as well.Mums can play   
 Bingo at the centre,but dads usually  
 spend their spare time at the pub.    
 There is also a dog training club, so 
 there is something for everyone.      </content>
