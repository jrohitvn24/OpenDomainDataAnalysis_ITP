		<title>11Rt.Hon.Boscawen's role as MP</title>
		<content> The Rt. Hon. Boscawen's{role as Whip.}
 His specific duty is to report        
 parliamentary business to the Queen.  
 There are 14 Whips in the Government, 
 who try to keep some order in         
 Parliament. On matters of extreme     
 importance, all M.P.s must be present.
 The Whips have control over certain   
 areas : the Rt. Hon. Boscawen's       
 area is the{South_West.}He makes sure 
 that all 37 M.P.s from that area are  
 present in Parliament to vote on the  
 matter in hand.In some cases 'bisques'
 are allowed.This is when one M.P. for 
 the motion pairs off with one against 
 the motion,so that the final majority 
 is not affected.To deal with his      
{consistuency business}the Rt. Hon.    
 Boscawen holds 'surgeries'. These are 
 held all around his constituency,so   
 that every constituent has a chance to
 discuss problems with him.            </content>
