		<title>10AMBERLEY C. of E. SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was opened on the 12/5/67. 
 Surrounded by a large playing area    
 with an outdoor swimming pool, it is a
 modern building with classrooms       
 opening on to a central hall. There   
 are 60 children whose ages range from 
 4.5 to 10 years. Most of these        
 children now come from Storrington.   
 The rest come from Amberley itself or 
 the surrounding villages. The morning 
 staff consists of a headteacher, one  
 full time and one part time teacher,  
 each with their own class. In the     
 afternoon the three classes merge into
 two. The present headmaster has held  
 this post for 20 years. Other members 
 of staff include a welfare assistant  
 and secretary. School lunches are     
 cooked on site with a kitchen staff of
 a cook and two school meal supervisors
 Annual events include Sports Day,     
 Amberley Revels and a xmas production.</content>
