		<title>01The area around Bawood</title>
		<content> The area in this block is almost      
 totally owned by the Earl of          
 Shelbourn, and is mostly farmed by    
 tenant farmers.  Estate workers repair
 and maintain estate property, and     
 gamekeepers organize shoots for       
 foreign clients.  Local people clean  
 the house at Bawood and are employed  
 as guides etc.  The house is open to  
 the public for six months each year.  
 In block number four a large factory  
 which employed over 2000 people in the
 pig industry (Harris' Pork Pies) has  
 just been demolished. In block number 
 nine there is a small village of      
 thatched roof houses now privately    
 owned.  In block four there is a      
 landing pad for helicopter inspections
 of an oil pipeline.
