		<content> The fore-shore inspectors take care of
 ten miles of fore-shore extending one 
 mile out from the sea wall. There are 
 sixteen men to do this. If you want to
 rent a chalet it costs you Â£160 per   
 season. There are 18 chalets in our   
 area, 9 in Westcliff and 9 in         
 Southend. All have glass doors, 4     
 chairs,a table and a carpet. The beach
 is man-made. If they run out of sand  
 they have to bring some more on       
 lorries. Mooring a boat costs Â£20.76 a
 year. Bait digging is allowed more    
 than quarter of a mile from the shore.
 There is a fine of up to Â£200 for     
 digging too close. There are three    
 first aid stations, and no free       
 parking anywhere.
