		<title>12Reading's Third Bridge</title>
		<content>   In 1983 a traffic survey was done.  
 It showed that 800 cars went over     
 Sonning's old bridge in an hour so    
 that people have to queue there. 2500 
 cars used Caversham Bridge and 1200 _ 
 1500 an hour used Reading Bridge.     
 Three_quarters ofthe traffic was from 
 Caversham and one quarter from        
 villages outside Caversham.           
   If there is a new bridge, should it 
 be a motorway bridge, and let the     
 government pay, or should it be a     
 local bridge? Should there be no new  
 bridge at all? The County Council has 
 said, "A local bridge for local needs"
 and "The bridge should not be a       
 motorway bridge".{Now a new bridge may
{be built in between Reading Bridge and
{Sonning's old bridge, between the     
{gravel pits to join the Henley road at
{the bottom of Caversham Park Village.
