		<title>07The Tweddles Typical Sunday</title>
		<content> We have a chalet at{Haggerston Castle 
 Caravan Park in Northumberland about  
 50 miles north of{Dinnington.}We went 
 to Haggerston for the weekend and on  
 Sunday we spent the morning at{       
{Bamburgh}a village with a fine castle,
 long ago it was the ancient capital of
 Northumbria.We saw the B.B.C. with    
 their outside T.V. Unit preparing for 
 the programme, "Bird Watch"to be      
 televised from the bird sanctuary on  
 the nearby Farne Islands. We walked   
 along the coastal path and we bought  
 an ice cream costing 23p and a can of 
 lemonade costing 30p. We returned to  
 the chalet and after lunch I went     
 sailing on the lake in my dinghy. We  
 left{Haggerston}at tea time to return 
 to{Dinnington,}dad and I took our dog 
 Maxi for a walk.
