		<content>    On the 30th April we went to       
{Hedingham Omnibus Depot.}The owner Mr.
 Mc'Gregor was not there so we asked   
 the secretary some questions about the
 company. A{bus}driver came in and we  
 asked him what happened when the buses
 broke down.He said that they have     
 their own repair garage. He also told 
 us that every{bus}travels about 300   
 miles a day.                          
    Then we went outside to look at the
 buses. We saw lots and lots of        
 different types. We went and looked   
 inside a{Double Decker bus}and went   
 upstairs to the top deck. They run    
 more{Single Deckers}than{Double.}     
    We also saw a very old{bus.}The    
 registration number was EX 6566.It was
 a{Double Decker}and it had no seats,it
 was being preserved.    We collected  
 some{bus}tickets and leaflets for our 
 project.                              </content>
