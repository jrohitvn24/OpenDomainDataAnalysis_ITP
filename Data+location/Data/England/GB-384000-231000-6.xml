		<title>06FORTHAMPTON COURT</title>
		<content> The road approaching Forthampton Court
 is still lined by sycamore trees which
 were first planted in 1898 and today  
 the gamekeeper lives in the lodge on  
 the drive. The exact origin of the    
 manor is unknown, but it was probably 
 built about 1240 by Abbot Robert de   
 Fortington. Since then many parts have
 been added and altered. The outside of
 the manor shows the irregular shapes  
 preferred by the famous architect     
 Philip Webb, who added the square     
 tower on the South-West front. The    
 house came into the Yorke family via  
 marriage in 1762. Today the house     
 retains much of the fabric of a large 
 Medieval manor house with its oak     
 staircase and Great Hall. The Yorke's 
 live in the house and it is not open  
 to the public.
