		<title>18ALVINGHAM CHURCHES</title>
		<content> In Alvingham there is the unique      
 feature of{two churches within the    
{same church yard!}St Marys Church     
 which is no longer used was the parish
 church of North Cockerington and      
 St Adelwolds was the parish church of 
 Alvingham. The latter is still used   
 today as the church for both parishes.
 St Adelwolds is the only church in the
 country dedicated to this particular  
 saint. He was a man who spent his life
 on Lindisfarne with St Aiden and      
 St Cuthbert who, it is said brought   
 Christianity to Britain.              
 A priory was established in Alvingham 
 in the 12th century by St Gilbert, and
 by 1131 the two churches were built   
 for the increasing needs of the       
 Gilbertine order. Evidence of the     
 priory, such as moats and ponds in the
 fields and stone from the priory used 
 in later buildings can still be found.</content>
