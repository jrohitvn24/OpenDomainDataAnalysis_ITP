		<title>10NEWTON FIELD CENTRE</title>
		<content>Newton Field Centre is located in the  
abandoned Church of St. Faiths. In 1975
a kitchen, office, library, laboratory 
and toilets were installed and a second
floor was built to accommodate         
dormitories.                           
About 40 schools from Northamptonshire 
attend the Centre to study about 30    
subjects under the headings of Ecology,
Conservation and Natural History. 15   
schools stay overnight.  The Centre    
costs 25,000 pounds per year to run.   
The wardens would like to provide more 
laboratory space and equipment. They   
think it is essential that no more of  
the wildlife habitats, used for study, 
are destroyed.                         
The local farmers are helpful and      
pleased with the Centre. Since it      
opened vandalism has been reduced in   
the area.
