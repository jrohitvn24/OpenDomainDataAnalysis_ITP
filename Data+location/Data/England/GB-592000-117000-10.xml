		<title>10The Mary Stanford Disaster.</title>
		<content>{  On the 15th November 1928 }there was
 a call at Rye Harbour Lifeboat Station
{The 'Alice',a steamer carrying        
{bricks,}was drifting {eight miles off 
{Dungeness.}It was a very stormy night 
 and the steamer was taking in         
 water.Launching the lifeboat was      
 difficult.{There were 17 men in the   
{crew}and they had to wade in the water
 till there was a good depth for the   
 boat to float.Soon after the launch a 
 message reached the lifeboat station  
 saying that {the crew of the Alice had
{been  rescued.}Flares were fired to   
 recall the lifeboat but with no       
 success. After several hours the Mary 
 Stanford turned back, but a mile and a
 half from safety the boat was hit by a
 giant wave and overturned.{All 17     
{lives were lost}and nearly every      
 family in the Rye Harbour community   
 suffered from the tragedy. {          </content>
