		<title>08Harvest Festival</title>
		<content> Many festivals are celebrated in our  
 school through the year.              
 The harvest festivals in which        
 schools take part are held in August  
 and September. Everyone is asked to   
 bring in a couple of items, a big     
 display is made in the hall and every 
 one admires it. At the end of the day 
 some fourth years are asked to carry a
 box of goods to some old people.      
 The Church also celebrates the        
 Harvest festival. Round about the     
 church flowers and sheaves of corn and
 barley are placed to decorate the     
 church. The Harvest festival          
 celebrates the food that was brought  
 in for the winter stores, like crops, 
 apples, and home made wine and cheese.
