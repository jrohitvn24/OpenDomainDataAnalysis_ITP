		<content>  Mr.Garnsworthy bought this           
 2-3acre                               
 nursery 38 years ago,and before this  
 it had been a fruit farm but had      
 become very overgrown.Apart from a    
 break in the 1960's when subsidies to 
 horticulturists on the continent      
 forced him into other work,the present
 owner has worked this nursery.The     
 farmhouse is about 250 years old and  
 made of cob.It has an old coachhouse  
 attached to it.The coachhouse,now a   
 garage,did have a cobbled             
 floor.Important features include a    
 beautiful conifer garden ascending the
 hillside and a 75 year old greenhouse.
 The greenhouse will soon be replaced  
 by an aluminium structure. All        
 greenhouses have gas or oil-fired     
 central heating.
