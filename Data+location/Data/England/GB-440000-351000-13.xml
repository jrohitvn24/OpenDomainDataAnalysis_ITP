		<title>13What my house is like</title>
		<content> The house I live in is a terraced     
 house .It has seven rooms. My mum's   
 room is the biggest my two brothers   
 have the middle size one and my room  
 is the smallest but it is all right.  
 Then there  is the bathroom and the   
 livingroom.                           
 The dining room has in it a table, a  
 little settee and a stereo. In the    
 kitchen there is a washing machine, a 
 fridge and a cooker. The living room  
 has two chairs and a settee, a gas    
 fire and a T.V. Our house has a garden
 with a lot of flowers.It has not got a
 garage so we park the car on the road.
