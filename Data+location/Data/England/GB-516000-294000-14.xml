		<title>14Modern implement - Pen</title>
		<content>    A typical pen is a cylinder 16cm   
 long with a 1cm diameter.  One end    
 tapers to a little ball which rolls   
 along the paper as you write.  Inside 
 the pen is a tube which contains ink. 
 As you hold the pen for writing, the  
 ink flows down to the bottom  of the  
 pen, onto the ball, which rolls the   
 ink onto the paper.  This sort of pen 
 is called a {ball point pen. }It is   
 less messy than a fountain pen, and   
 you do not have to blot your writing  
 to dry the ink.  Some people still use
 the fountain pen as the writing is    
 neater with it, but most people use a 
 ball point as it is quicker and less  
 fussy.   I would not have liked to    
 have used a quill, which was a feather
 which had to be dipped in ink each few
 words.   Pens come in many colours,   
 usually of metal or plastic, and often
 with an advetisement for a company on.</content>
