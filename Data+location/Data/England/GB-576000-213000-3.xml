		<title>03ATTITUDES ABOUT TERLING</title>
		<content> The general concensus of opinion is   
 that Terling is a very desirable      
 village, in which to live. It is very 
 picturesque and well preserved and    
 there is a full social life for those 
 who wish to take part in it, and a    
 good community spirit. The teenagers  
 might wish for more activities, though
 there is a Youth Club which though    
 threatened with closure has been      
 reprieved. There is no vandalism or   
 discipline problem since village      
 children seem gentler than town       
 children. Most people would like to   
 see a better Public Transport service,
 though most have cars. Our local      
 historian remembers frequent buses to 
 Chelmsford, also her school_days here 
 in the 2nd World War, which were      
 stricter,though she felt life was more
 fun, with a Working Men's Club putting
 on something different every night.   </content>
