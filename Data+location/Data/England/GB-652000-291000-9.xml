		<title>09LOWESTOFT PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> We asked our class which games they   
played in the playground. They said    
Tag, British Bulldogs, Football &amp;      
Queenie-Queenie.                       
  For British Bulldogs, you have 2 home
bases:the wall &amp; the shed. The person  
who is on calls a name like "Alan" &amp;   
Alan has 10 seconds to get from the    
wall to the shed. If he is not caught, 
we can all run to the shed. The catcher
tries to touch as many people as he    
can. On the next run, if you were      
caught, you are on too. The game       
carries on until everyone is caught.   
  In Queenie-Queenie, we stand in a    
line &amp; the person who is "on" throws a 
ball over his shoulder. Someone in the 
line catches it &amp; hides it. Queenie    
(the person who is on), tries to guess 
who has the ball when we say           
"Queenie-Queenie who's got the ball?"
