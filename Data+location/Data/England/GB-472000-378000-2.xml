		<content> The present church,dedicated to       
 St.Helen,was opened by the Bishop of  
 Lincoln on 8th December,1882.Records  
 show that it was cold and snowing,but 
 the church was full with 120 people.  
 The Bishop and congregation had       
 gathered in the older church and then 
 proceded to the new church,slightly to
 the north.The former was then         
 demolished,having stood for 400 years.
 The new building cost Â£5,000 and was a
 gift from Mr.Harcourt Vernon.         
 The present organ is two manuel and   
 was installed in 1894.The white  alter
 frontal was embroidered by the Sisters
 Of St.Marys',Wantage.The parish       
 register dates back to 1726 and is in 
 a good state of preservation.The      
 church contains beautifully carved    
 woodwork behind the alter,threestained
 glass windows and the tomb of Humphrey
 Havey,1511-from the former church.    </content>
