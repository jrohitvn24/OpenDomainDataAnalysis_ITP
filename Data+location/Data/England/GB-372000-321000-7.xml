		<content> AMONG THESE PLANTS WERE GNATS,        
 LADYBIRDS,BEETLES AND SPIDERS.        
   OUR SECOND SAMPLE WAS AT WHITLEYFORD
 BRIDGE (03740323). THIS SECTION OF    
 HEDGEROW WAS NEXT TO THE COPSE ALREADY
 MENTIONED. THE MAIN SHRUBS WERE       
 HAWTHORN, CRACK WILLOW AND SYCAMORE.IN
 THE BOTTOM OF THE HEDGE WAS A LARGE   
 NUMBER OF NETTLES AND COMMON CLEAVERS.
 NEARER THE ROAD WAS HEDGE PARSLEY,    
 WHITE AND PINK CAMPION, CHICKWEED,    
 BUTTERCUPS AND DOCK. ONE UNUSUAL PLANT
 WE FOUND WAS HORSETAIL. BIRDLIFE WE   
 SAW IN THE HEDGE WAS A PHEASANT, A    
 MALE AND FEMALE BLACKBIRD AND SOME    
 SPARROWS. BELOW THE HEDGE WE NOTICED  
 SOME SNAILS, BEES AND CUCKOO SPIT. IN 
 THE BANK WE ALSO SAW TWO HOLES WHICH  
 WERE POSSIBLY THOSE OF SHREWS OR      
 VOLES.                                
   WHEN WE DID OUR SURVEY IN JUNE,     
 BANKS AND HEDGEROWS HAD NOT BEEN CUT. </content>
