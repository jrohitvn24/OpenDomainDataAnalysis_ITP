		<title>13THE HISTORY OF HEATH HAYES</title>
		<content>Heath Hayes was originally an old      
mining village.  At the height of its  
mining life there were about eight coal
mines in the area. Most of the people  
who lived in the village were in some  
way connected with the coal mining     
industry either as miners, brickyard   
workers or office workers.             
The village consisted mainly of        
terraced houses that were owned by     
Mining companies for their employees.  
Nowadays, there are no coal mines in   
the area, they have all been closed    
down and very few people are connected 
with coal mining.                      
The village is far from "dead" though  
as there are many new housing          
developments being built. Many people  
live in Heath Hayes and travel to their
places of work.
