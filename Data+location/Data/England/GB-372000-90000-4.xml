		<title>04TESS OF THE DURBERVILLES</title>
		<content>   The other book is called{"Tess Of   
{The Durbervilles".}In this novel, Tess
 worked as a dairy maid at a farm.     
 Herman Lea does not identify the farm 
 at which Tess worked,but indicates    
 that it was set to the south of the   
 heath around the area of the "Duck    
 Dairy house". In one part, Tess goes  
 to a church at Mellstock (Stinsford). 
   Bearing in mind where Hardy was born
 and spent his early years there can be
 little doubt that the area must have  
 been a great influence on his outlook.
