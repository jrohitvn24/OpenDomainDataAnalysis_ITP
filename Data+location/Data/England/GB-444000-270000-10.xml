commuter,retired and farming households
Our survey found that most life styles 
were similar apart from the farmers.   
Many village people rise at 8:30am on a
Sunday,although others rise between    
6:30 and 10:00am.The average time for  
weekday rising was 7:00 and 8:00 am.   
The few who got up at 6:00am were      
farmers.                               
The way children get to school is      
generally by car.Others by             
bus,bicycle,or on foot.

followed by dogs,fish,rabbits,guinea   
pigs and birds.
