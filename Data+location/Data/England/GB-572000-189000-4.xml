		<content> Having lived here nearly 30 years, the
 greatest change is in the attitude of 
 people. They care less. There is      
 little friendship or community spirit.
 Children are not encouraged to have   
 respect for their parents let alone   
 others. They, and adults, are rude and
 try to take advantage of us. Maybe    
 it's because families now live over a 
 wider area - the closeness has gone.  
                                       
 The council does provide various      
 amenities for pensioners, but as there
 are none in this area, you need money 
 to travel, which I haven't got. And   
 I'd prefer that some more money was   
 spent on housing, for improvements and
 for new houses for the youngsters.    
                                       
 I'd like to see more help from the    
 council, for example removing garden  
 rubbish which I can't deal with.      </content>
