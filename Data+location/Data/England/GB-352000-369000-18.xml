 There is a Zion Methodist Chapel &amp;    
 Sunday School at the N.E. corner of   
 our area.This was founded in 1870.    
 There is also a very small Catholic   
 church, These are on either side of   
 the B5152,near Hatchmere.             
                                       
 LOCAL HISTORY                         
 Eddisbury ridge at a height of approx.
 170 metres is certainly the highest   
 area in our sector. In Iron Age times 
 there were hill forts all along the   
 ridge. On the ridge also is Old Pale  
 Farm,built by the Crown in 1835. Old  
 Pale means 'original clearing' &amp; was  
 a paled off or fenced off area for    
 deer grazing.
