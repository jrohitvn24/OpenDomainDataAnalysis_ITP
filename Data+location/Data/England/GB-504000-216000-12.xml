		<content>         {MARKYATE GUIDES              
  Markyate Guides meet at the Youth and
 Community Centre at the bottom of     
 Pickford Hill.It is quite a busy road.
 We have our meetings every Thursday.  
 The only time we don't have meetings  
 is if the school is on holiday or in  
 Winter if it is really cold.The time  
 of each Meeting is 7.00pm to 8.30pm.  
 The amount of money for subscriptions 
 is 30p per week, even if you are away,
 as the Hall still has to be paid for. 
 There are four Patrols: Swallows,     
 Bluetits; Canaries and Robins.The     
 games we play are "Ladders"; "Guides  
 from other Counties"; "Names of" and  
 many more. This year is the 75th      
 Anniversary of the Guide Movement so  
 our group is making up 75 different   
 challenges to perform.One week the    
 challenge was to eat a jelly with a   
 pair of chopsticks.                   </content>
