		<title>17NEW BY PASS IN BLAYDON BURN.</title>
		<content> In Blaydon Burn the building of a new 
 by pass is in progress. The road is   
 being built for two purposes, one to  
 take the quarry heavy goods traffic   
 away from the narrow Summer Hill Bank,
 and secondly as part of the           
 Ryton_Crawcrook by pass. The road was 
 designed by the County Council        
 engineers, and is being built by      
 Balfour Beatty, at a cost of 1.4      
 million pounds. Their contract started
 in June 1984 and expires in September 
 1985.On the site at the moment is a   
 labour force of three steel-fixers,   
 four joiners and one chief engineer. A
 bridge across the Burn will soon be   
 built. It will be 14m high and 63m    
 long. At the moment 10 men are at work
 on the bridge, which in June 1985 is  
 just a mass of scaffold. On the bridge
 is a big N.C.K. Rapier crane.
