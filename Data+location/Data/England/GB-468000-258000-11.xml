		<content>   On the {A45}Northampton over certain
 periods of time I took down notes of  
 how many cars went past.              
  In 16 minutes 1OO cars went past.    
  In half an hour 14O cars went past.  
  On the last time which was 40 minutes
 an overall of 175 cars went past.     
  On average 6300 cars would go along  
 the {A45}( in one direction ) a day.  
                                       
  On a bridge over the {M1}over a      
 period of time I took down notes of   
 how many cars went past.              
  In 20 minutes 380 cars went past.    
  The {M1}is probably the busiest road 
 in Britain and the whole of England!  
  The average cars in a day to go along
 the {M1}would be 28800. Between       
 junction 15 and 16 is most probably   
 the worst accident black spot because 
 there are at least 2 or 3 accidents a 
 month!                                </content>
