		<title>03SWIMMING IN RIVER CALDEW</title>
		<content>   The bay is situated at Bridge End,  
 which is at the southern end of       
 Dalston.                              
                                       
   The bay is a popular place where    
 young people go to bathe. It is a weir
 with a deep pool where you can swim.  
 The pool is about 20 feet deep. People
 say that many years ago a horse and   
 cart fell in but no traces have been  
 found.                                
                                       
   The bay is safe but it has a strong 
 undercurrent and some parents won't   
 let their children swim there. You can
 go down the waterfall on old inner    
 tubes or air beds.                    
                                       
   If you get permission off of the    
 people who own the land you can go    
 fishing there when the season starts.
