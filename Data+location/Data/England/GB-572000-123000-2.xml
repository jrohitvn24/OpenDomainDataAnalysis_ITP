  The parish of Salehurst is quite     
 large but it is the village of        
 Robertsbridge,within the parish,that  
 has grown as the main built-up area.  
  Communications are good.The present  
 main line railway station is within   
 1/2mile of the centre and the main    
 road from Hastings to London passes   
 through the village.                  
  The land-use is mixed with good      
 farming land being used for arable and
 pastoral farming.Hops are grown in the
 area.                                 
  Trade in the area is                 
 established.Gray-Nicolls,the famous   
 cricket manufacturers,have had a      
 factory in the village for over       
 100years.There has been a grain mill  
 here since almost 1086.               
  There are many clubs and societies.  </content>
