		<title>19RUNNING ON THE MALVERN HILLS</title>
		<content> With the increased interest in health 
 and physical fitness in the past 10   
 years many people have taken to the   
 sport of jogging or running. The      
 Malvern Hills has good opportunities  
 for this kind of recreation. The most 
 run-over areas are around the{steep   
{paths of Holy Well,}along the         
{undulating roads between Great Malvern
{and British Camp}and in the{flat area 
{near the 3 Counties Showground.}Each  
 year since 1982 the Malvern Hills     
 Round Table has organised a charity   
{half marathon to Upton}with a         
 start-finish at the showground. Most  
 running is done as an informal        
 individually organised 3 to 5 mile jog
 before or after work. In schools both 
 running and orienteering form part of 
 the curriculum. Around{British Camp   
{regional orienteering}events are run  
 using a special 4 colour 1:10,000 map.</content>
