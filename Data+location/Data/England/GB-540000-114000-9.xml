  The following are comments about     
 living in Barcombe today,by teenager  
 Mandy Smith aged 16 years:            
  I have lived in Barcombe for         
 12.5 years.During that time it has    
 become bigger with more new housing   
 estates.The only shop that has changed
 is the antique shop,in the centre of  
 the village,which used to be a grocers
 shop.                                 
  I enjoy living in Barcombe because it
 is a nice quiet village.It is a nice  
 friendly place which is better to live
 in than a larger town like Lewes.You  
 know most of the other young people   
 and you go round in a crowd.This makes
 it a nice close community.Of course   
 Lewes is very near so you can travel  
 to it quite easily.
