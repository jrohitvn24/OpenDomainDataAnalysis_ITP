		<title>06FARMING, DOWNS EDINGTON (1)</title>
		<content> The major part of the high ground     
 belongs to the Ministry of Defence.   
 Some of this land was acquired as far 
 back as the Boer War for the purposes 
 of army training. Tenants may crop    
 Schedule I land as they wish; the army
 gives three months notice of using it 
 for training. Schedule 3 land is      
 rented much more cheaply; it has      
 been cropped in ten acre blocks,      
 alternate three year cereal, three    
 year grass; but from l986 Schedule 3  
 tenants will only be allowed to grow  
 grass as more use is being made of the
 land by the army. Stoke Hill farm has 
 a thousand acres, mostly in this      
 block. It is cropped with winter      
 barley, wheat and oilseed rape. There 
 is no livestock. The farm manager is  
 the only person living on the Downs in
 this area.
