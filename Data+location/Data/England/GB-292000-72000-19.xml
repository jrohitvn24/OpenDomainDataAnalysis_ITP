		<content> There are the following outdoor       
 facilities at the Broadmeadow sports  
 ground.                               
   Cricket, rugby, football,athletics  
 track and an "inadequate" BMX track.  
 There are still some problems with the
 shifting ground as this was built on  
 reclaimed land. It does provide very  
 valuable facilities, however, as      
 Teignmouth is a town built on steep   
 land and there is no other flat land  
 available for pitches that take up a  
 lot of space.                         
   Older people can play bowls either  
 on the Den or at Bitton Park and the  
 Den has other games like "Crazy Golf".
 A new canoeing club has been started  
 in the town.                          
   The biggest gap is the lack of a    
 large, heated swimming pool for all   
 the year round use.
