		<content> The College site was a golf course    
 from 1906 until the second World War. 
 The site was then turned into an      
 American Army hospital with many      
 nissen huts and other temporary       
 buildings, including a large water    
 tower. The site was then used for     
 various purposes including teacher    
 training. In 1953 the site was first  
 used as a boarding school, using the  
 existing nissen huts. The pupils of   
 Thorpe Grammar School also came to the
 site until their own buildings were   
 complete. Another school, the County  
 Grammar School was started on the     
 site, but the buildings for this were 
 never built and the pupils became day 
 pupils of Wymondham College. Wymondham
 College, which is a state school,     
 became the largest coeducational      
 boarding school in europe.
