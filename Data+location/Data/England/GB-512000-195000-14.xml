		<title>14St.James's Church 2</title>
		<content> The font is near the door of the      
 church and is made of marble and is   
 very heavy.  There is a wooden cover  
 for it and on it are some designs with
 a piece of wood sticking out of the   
 middle where you lift it up.  The font
 also has a little plughole.  The altar
 has a cloth over it with real cloth of
 gold designs over it.  On the side are
 marble designs of Jesus in the middle,
 Mary on his left and Joseph on her    
 left.  On Jesus's right is St.John and
 after him St.George    the patron     
 saint of England.  There are lovely   
 paintings in the Nave which the       
 Victorians painted.
