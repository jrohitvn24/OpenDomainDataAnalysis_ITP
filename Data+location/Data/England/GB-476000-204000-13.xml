 For the under-fives there is a play   
 group held in Longwick.  Fund raising 
 events are held to help cover costs   
 and the children enjoy puzzles,       
 stories, music and movement etc.      
 Village Hall                          
 The village hall is the hub of the    
 village.  Here is where most of the   
 regular clubs are held:   judo, keep  
 fit, W.I., bingo, and the over 60's   
 club.  It is also used for Antique    
 Fairs and other occasional happenings.
 The Scout Hall.                       
 This was recently built with the aid  
 of a grant and much effort from the   
 village and is the pride and joy of   
 the local scout movement.  It is in   
 use most nights of the week for       
 scouts, cubs, venture scouts, guides  
 and brownies.  Fund raising events for
 the scout movement are also held there</content>
