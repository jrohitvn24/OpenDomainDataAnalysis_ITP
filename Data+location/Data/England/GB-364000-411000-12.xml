		<title>12THE PIPE WORKS</title>
		<content> During the 19th century the ceramic   
 industry expanded rapidly. In 1860 the
 pipe-works were established on the    
 side of Rivington Pike just above the 
 town.The clay was mined in the        
 neighbouring town of Westhoughton and 
 using the "Bessemer" process made into
 drainage pipes in Horwich.The works   
 continued to produce pipes until 1980 
 when it closed and was                
 demolished.Remains of the kilns can   
 still be found .
