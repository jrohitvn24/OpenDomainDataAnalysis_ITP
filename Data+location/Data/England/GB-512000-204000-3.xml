		<title>03ST STEPHENS CHURCH</title>
		<content>  {St Stephens church }has a large,    
 interesting graveyard. {St Stephens   
{church}is an old church as it was     
 built in 948 A.D., the same year as   
 two other churches in the area. You   
 can tell it has passed through Roman  
 and Norman times because it has both  
 rounded and pointed arches.  All the  
 windows now have thick plastic        
 covering to prevent damage by vandals.
 The church has a large and interesting
 graveyard and includes the grave of   
 the wife of Sir Mortimer Wheeler.     
 Mortimer Wheeler was responsible for  
 most of the Verulamium excavations and
 the grave is covered by Roman tiles.  
 The church used to have a brass       
 lectern in the shape of an eagle but  
 it was stolen on St Andrews Day, 1984,
 possibly by some{Scots}as the lectern 
 came from Scotland originally.
