		<content> Where coniferous woodland was found it
was often mixed with deciduous trees.  
This expands the number of habitats for
birds &amp; insects in particular &amp; so     
benefits the area's ecology.The main   
coniferous tree species were European  
larch,Scot's pine,Norway spruce,Douglas
fir &amp; Corsican pine.These were mainly  
inplantations owned by the Forestry    
Commission.In the private manor gardens
such as Marsden &amp; Rencomb Manors more  
unusual conifers occured:Leyland       
cypress,cedar of Lebanon &amp; western red 
cedar.Few conifers existed to the      
eastern side of the area but in several
cases the farmers had planted lines of 
conifers to act as windbreaks          
protecting their crops.The benefits of 
conifers on the ecology are good       
protection &amp;nesting sites for birds &amp;  
squirrels' dreys which also feed on the
cones.                                 </content>
