		<title>07AN INTERVIEW WITH A LORD</title>
		<content>   {Lord Cawley}talked to a group of   
 children on the steps of{Berrington   
 Hall.He is very proud of the house and
 his estates make up a large proportion
 of our squares,about  3,000  acres.   
 The house itself was built in 1778 of 
 brick covered in sandstone quarried   
 from Moreton, just down the road. The 
 farm employs 7 men and the gardens    
 2 men. Lord Cawley lives at{Bircher   
{Hall}now and has done so since 1973.  
 He goes to the{House of Lords         
 regularly and chairs a Committee      
 hearing private bills. Since 1957 the 
 Hall itself has been run by the       
{National Trust}and about 18,000       
 visitors a year see it. Lord Cawley's 
 grandfather bought the estate for     
 Â£14,500 in 1901 and furnished the     
 house with beautiful furniture. Lord  
 Cawley knows most of the families of  
 Luston, some still work for him.      </content>
