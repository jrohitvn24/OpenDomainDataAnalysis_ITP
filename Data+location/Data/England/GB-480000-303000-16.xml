		<title>16Shooting in Leighfield</title>
		<content> In Priors Coppice (830055) there is no
 organised shooting only rough shooting
 but the 140 acres of Launde Park Wood 
 (803038), as well as 200 acres of     
 farmland to the north is part of a    
 syndicated shoot.                     
 The syndicate has 10 guns and shoots  
 occur once a fortnight during the     
 season giving a total of about 8      
 days.A gamekeeper is employed in the  
 wood and he visits twice daily to     
 check that everything is alright.     
 Pheasants are fed all over the wood   
 and about 750 birds are bred and      
 released each year. The shoot is      
 mainly for pheasant but about 40      
 woodcock and a few pigeons are also   
 shot each year.
