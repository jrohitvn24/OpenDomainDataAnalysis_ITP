		<title>18THE RIDING OF THE BOUNDS</title>
		<content> The Berwick Riding of the Bounds is   
 the oldest of all the Border common   
 ridings.On the 1st of May each year   
 anyone with a horse can take part in  
 the ceremony;in recent years the event
 has risen in popularity.The boundaries
 were first ridden in 1533 at the      
 command of Henry V111,and has         
 continued unbroken ever since.Many    
 changes have taken place,the route has
 been changed so that no rivers are    
 forded,after several people were      
 drowned.There used to be a break      
 halfway round at Mordington and flat  
 races took place,but these were       
 stopped due to professionalism.For the
 last 70 years the ride has been led   
 by J.Moffat,who as leader is presented
 with a sash by the Mayor of Berwick at
 the Town Hall steps at the start of   
 the ride,the rest of the riders are   
 given a ribbon and stirrup cup.       </content>
