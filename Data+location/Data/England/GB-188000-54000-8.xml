		<title>08SCARCEWATER</title>
		<content>  Scarcewater is on the main road      
 between Newquay and St Austell.It is  
 dangerous through the hamlet as the   
 road is rather narrow. There are      
 about 20 houses which are very        
 scattered. They house some old        
 families and some young families.     
 There are no shops or pubs. Basic     
 needs can be satified at nearby St    
 Stephens.There is an active Methodist 
 chapel in the hamlet. Farming and     
 china clay are the main jobs of the   
 people. It is called Scarcewater      
 because the area might have had a     
 water stortage at one time. Families  
 have lived here for ages as the houses
 are old. There is one telephone box   
 and one post box. There is a small    
 caravan club location with about 5    
 caravans in.We interviewed Mr Willcox 
 who we found painting his house on our
 survey day.                           </content>
