		<title>16THE L.S.A.NEWBOURNE.</title>
		<content>The Land Settlement Association was    
founded in 1934 to provide alternative 
work for unemployed from industrial    
areas and to give families with an     
aptitude for agriculture but little    
capital an opportunity to farm.        
Between l935 and 1937 the estate was   
developed at Newbourne. The original   
farm was partitioned into holdings.    
The old Elizabethan Hall was adapted   
as a temporary headquarters for        
incoming staff and stables and         
cowsheds were converted to stores,     
packing sheds and garages. Army huts   
were erected on the yard to house and  
instruct the trainees Fifty new houses 
complete with piggeries,glasshousess   
and poultry huts were erected.A new    
road was constructed the early         
trainees doing much of the work. The   
first trainees,mostly unemployed       
miners,arrived from Durham.            </content>
