		<title>08A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> On Monday 23rd June, 1985, I lay      
 in bed awake. Soon my dad came in     
 and said that it was time to get      
 up. I didn't really want to get up    
 so I lay in bed a little longer.      
 My sisters, Debbie and Esther were    
 also lying in bed. Grace was in       
 Sussex with my elder brother Graham.  
 She was looking after an old lady.    
 Philip, my eldest brother was at      
 Birmingham University. Derek and      
 Stephen were already up doing other   
 things, probably reading. We got up   
 and got dressed. Soon Derek came in   
 and told me I had to do my job. We    
 each have a job. Grace normally       
 makes the tea. Derek lays the tray,   
 putting the cups, milk, sugar and     
 teaspoons on. I lay the table in the  
 morning and Debbie lays it in the     
 afternoon.                            
                                       </content>
