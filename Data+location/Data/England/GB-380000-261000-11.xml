		<content> Sand and gravel has been quarried in  
 Holt and at Top Barn Farm for nearly  
 40 years. From the 300 acre site, 150 
 acres of which are already            
 quarried,200,000 tons are extracted   
 annually and sold within a 30 mile    
 radius. It is used by the building    
 industry for pre-mixed concrete and   
 pre-cast concrete. Of 30 employees all
 but three executives live locally. One
 of the older disused quarries is used 
 by a private contractor as a rubbish  
 tip;another is filled with water and  
 used for farm irrigation, fishing and 
 water sports. Malvern Hills           
 Authority's conservation and safety   
 policy now requires old quarries to be
 immediately filled in and             
 cultivated.This slightly changes the  
 original contour causing a dip on the 
 sloping sides of which trees are      
 planted.                              </content>
