		<content> Our area contains three villages      
 surrounded by countryside. Fields and 
 hedgerows are everywhere. In each     
 village old buildings blend with newer
 ones. Farms which have been here for  
 many years are still standing upright.
 There are Post Offices, shops,        
 churches which hold regular services, 
 and a few Public Houses in our area.  
                                       
 There is also a sports club where     
 cricket and tennis are played.        
                                       
 Our area is really a quiet, pleasant  
 and clean place with no pollution     
 about. Most of the people who live    
 here like it a lot.
