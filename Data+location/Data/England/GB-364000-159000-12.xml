		<title>12TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN WANSDYKE</title>
		<content>    The local Police from Radstock     
 helped us to find out information.    
    Not many cars are stolen           
 locally.However,there are quite a lot 
 of collisions around here,mostly on   
 main roads, especially on the A39 near
 Marksbury.Most people do drive too    
 fast,especially in fog.Drivers need to
 obey the law.Pedestrians should keep  
 to the pavement and 'be seen.'Motor-  
 bikes need to be driven with great    
 care as they are very vulnerable.     
 Cyclists need lights,especially, and  
 bright clothing and good brakes.      
    Of recent accidents,there have been
 three fatal accidents nearby,north of 
 Timsbury. Lots of accidents           
 happen outside pubs.One place had two 
 accidents happen within half an hour.
