Three worked flints have been found in 
the old gravel pits.                   
{Bronze Age}                           
Crop marks revealed by aerial photo-   
graph show a pair of irregular round   
ditches which may have encircled a     
barrow or wooden henge southwest of    
Balsdon Hall on the slope below Hawks  
Grove.                                 
{Romano-British Period}                
The same photograph shows what appears 
to be a native farmstead within these  
ditches.                               
{Roman Period}                         
Traces of an east-west road may be seen
along a minor road and hedge near      
School and Slough Farms. A north-south 
road crossed this near Bassetts Farm.  
Close by, a hand mill stone and a      
marble head of Roman origin have been  
found.                                 </content>
