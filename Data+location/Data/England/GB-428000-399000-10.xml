		<content> The eleven houses called New Bailey   
 are made of brick and stone. They are 
 the newest houses in Crane Moor and   
 were built twelve years ago. There is 
 a new stone bungalow in Crane Moor    
 Nook. From the centre of Crane Moor   
 you can see fields and woods all      
 around you.The village is at the      
 bottom of three hills with farms and  
 woodland surrounding it. We think it  
 is a lot better than being in a town  
 and staring into other houses. We have
 one club and one inn.The club is a    
 Working Man's Club.The public house is
 called the Rock Inn and it has a      
 restaurant.
