		<title>01Introduction to Debenham.</title>
		<content>The village of Debenham is in the      
rolling countryside of High Suffolk.It 
is a very fertile area with a mixture  
of soils,very suitable for arable      
farming.The land drains into the river 
Deben which flows eastward to the sea  
north of Felixstowe.The area was once  
heavily forested but has now lost all  
its woodland,apart from one small      
plantation.                            
  Debenham was chosen as a Heritage    
Village by the English Tourist Board   
in 1975.The seven antique shops        
indicate its importance as a tourist   
centre.The village has achieved a      
harmonious blend of old and new.It has 
many old buildings-part of St.Mary's   
Church is Saxon-and several new        
housing  estates.With a population     
approaching 2000,it is an active,      
growing village,attracting commuters to
Stowmarket,Ipswich and even London.    </content>
