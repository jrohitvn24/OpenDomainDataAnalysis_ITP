 This is a small coppice of mixed      
 deciduous woodland, with an area of   
 approximately 1 hectare. When the     
 school was built in 1965, the owners  
 of the woodland- The Bourneville      
 Trust, made the woodland over to the  
 Worcestershire Education Committee to 
 be maintaines as an area of           
 environmental interest.               
 The woodland appears on maps dating   
 from 1882, and has remained unchanged 
 for probably 200 years.The dominant   
 oak trees are about 18 metres         
 tall.There are 91 in the Coppice, with
 an average girth of 270 cms.Other     
 varieties include: Rowan,Birch and    
 Alder.Shrubs show:Honeysuckle,Willow  
 and Hawthorne.                        
 This area is of great environmental   
 value to the school.                  </content>
