		<title>11FARMHOUSE NEAR DUFTON</title>
		<content> Along the Keisley road,the houses are 
 mainly small,low ones with a long     
 sweep of roof facing the fell wind as 
 protection.Inside,the rooms are low,  
 but seated by the windows, you see the
 whole valley and the Lake District    
 Fells beyond.A kitchen I know belongs 
 to an elderly couple,farmers,with 2   
 bachelor sons,who live at home.2 of   
 the married daughters live on farms   
 either side &amp; they come home regularly
 to help with washing &amp; baking.As a    
 visitor,you sit in front of a glowing 
 fire &amp; look at the view past the      
 clutter of baking ingredients &amp; busy  
 hands shaping the pasties.You chat to 
 the old folk in their chairs &amp; to the 
 others passing through the room &amp;     
 talk about market prices,old days,    
 young children,the state of the       
 weather,until you have forgotten about
 time....                              </content>
