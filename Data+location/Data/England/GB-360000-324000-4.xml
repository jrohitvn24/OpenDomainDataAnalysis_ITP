		<title>04DAY IN LIFE OF A PIG FARMER.</title>
		<content> The day starts at six thirty a.m. when
 the pigs are fed and cleaned out.     
 There are seventy sows, three boars   
 and about five hundred fattening pigs.
 The sows have ten piglets on          
 average, and farrow twice a year.     
 Breakfast at eight thirty a.m. Before 
 feeding and cleaning out again at four
 p.m. there are a variety of tasks to  
 be done. The piglets are born in      
 farrowing crates which help to stop   
 the sows lying on the piglets. They   
 are always watched at farrowing, day  
 or night. At three days old the       
 piglets are injected with iron and    
 their teeth are cut, so that the sows 
 do not get sore teats. The pigs are   
 weaned at three weeks old. Once a week
 the fat pigs are weighed. If they are 
 60kg in weight, aged between 16 &amp; 18  
 weeks, they are sold for pork. They   
 are fed on bulk pelletted corn.       </content>
