		<title>05PARK LODGE G.L.C. FARM</title>
		<content> The Greater London Council operates a 
 scheme which allows children from the 
 inner city areas of the capital to    
 experience the benefits of a holiday  
 in the country whilst at the same time
 learning something about the          
 difficulties of living together as a  
 group - 24 hours a day. The scheme is 
 based at Park Lodge Farm, a working   
 farm to the south of the village.     
 The children are housed in the old    
 farmhouse in dormitary accomodation   
 and are expected to take part in a    
 series of activities designed to both 
 stimulate and educate.                
 In the current unstable political and 
 economic climate, it is possible that 
 the G.L.C. may not continue in its    
 present form and that this unique     
 facility may have to be abandoned.
