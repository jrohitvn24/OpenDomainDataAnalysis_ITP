		<title>08GRAND BRIDGE</title>
		<content>Blenheim Bridge is quite long. It is   
built from Cotswold stone and is       
between 30 and 40 feet above the lake. 
The road over the bridge goes from the 
palace to the monument, North lodge,   
two farms, and other parts of the park.
There are some rooms in the bridge.    
A woman used to live there. Before she 
lived there she made clothes for one of
the dukes.                             
The bridge was built by the original   
landscaper and just crossed the river  
Glyme. This grand construction looked  
out of place across a small river and  
so Capability Brown conceived the idea 
of the lakes which has put the bridge  
in a setting once described as the     
finest view in England.
