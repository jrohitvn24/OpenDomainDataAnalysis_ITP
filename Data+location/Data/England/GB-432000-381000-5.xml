		<title>05    BEAUCHIEF ABBEY(cont)</title>
		<content>    During the 100 years following     
 Henry's seizure, the Abbey was allowed
 to fall into ruin.In{1648}it passed by
 marriage to the{Pegge}family. The     
 Abbey stayed with this family until{  
{1923}when the then High Sheriff of    
 Nottingham disposed of it to{Frank    
{Crawshaw}in{1923.}                    
                                       
    Today the Abbey with its tower only
 two-thirds its original height        
 presents an interesting relic of less 
 secular times. Outside,on the north   
 and south sides are contrasting       
 doorways,rounded Norman,pointed       
 Gothic,salvage from the ruins.Graves  
 of owning families lie beside the     
 still traceable foundations of the    
 original buildings.
