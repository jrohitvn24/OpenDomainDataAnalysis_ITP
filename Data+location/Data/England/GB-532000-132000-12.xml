		<title>12FARMING IN THE HIGH WEALD</title>
		<content> Clearance of the forest of{The Weald  
 for agriculture has been taking place 
 since{Saxon times}and by 1350 it had  
 almost reached its present extent.    
 Today it is mostly used for{dairy     
{farming}as the soil is unsuitable for 
 growing cereals or other crops        
 profitably. The main crop is{intensive
{grass}but odd fields of barley, oats  
 or potatoes are grown on some farms.  
 The{EEC milk quota}introduced in 1984 
 has halted expansion and cut milk farm
 sales by 11% so farmers are trying to 
 diversify to keep in profit. The grass
 is grazed, some{hay}made but mostly it
 is made into{silage}for the dairy herd
 in winter. This is mostly put into    
 clamps but latterly some is baled and 
 put in plastic sacks. Most herds are  
{Friesians,}but{Jerseys}are bred at    
 Duckyls Farm and{Guernseys}at Old     
 House Farm and are exhibited at shows.</content>
