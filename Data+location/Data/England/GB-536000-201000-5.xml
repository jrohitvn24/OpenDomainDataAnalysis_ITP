		<title>05Transport In 1985</title>
		<content>   In the twentieth century there are  
 lots of  different kinds of transport 
   The earliest kind of transport is   
the canal.Canals are man-made and are  
straight and direct.However they are   
slow because you have to pass through a
lock to go up hills.                   
   A more efficient means of transport 
is the train.The train was powered by  
steam.Today it is either diesel or     
electric.There are three railway       
stations in our area,Waltham Cross     
,Cheshunt and Theobalds Grove.This     
is because a lot of people commute     
to work in London each day.            
   The most popular form of transport  
today is road transport.People can     
travel by bus,bicycle or car.Most      
people travel by car.This can cause    
such problems as pollution,noise and   
accidents.The two main roads in this   
area are the A10 and the A1010.        </content>
