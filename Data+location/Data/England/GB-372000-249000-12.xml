      It is Monday, 24th June -        
 Midsummer Day and we all go to explore
 Suckley and district.  At 10 a.m.     
 after walking a little way it starts  
 to rain.  We take a side turning, the 
 rain increases, it's the wrong        
 turning!  It takes twenty minutes to  
 get back on to the right road.  We    
 trudge along in the rain until we come
 to Byfields Farm.  Now it is          
 absolutely pouring.  Darrel and       
 Richard go to a house to ask some     
 questions.  A little further on we    
 meet Mrs. Johnson and she tells us it 
 is too wet to carry on, so we slowly  
 make our way back to the cars.  We    
 leave at about 12.10 and get back to  
 school at 12.30.  Perhaps before the  
 end of the term we shall get ONE FINE 
 DAY to finish the Domesday Project!   </content>
