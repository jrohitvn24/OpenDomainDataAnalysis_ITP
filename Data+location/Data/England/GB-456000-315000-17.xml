		<title>17THE HOUSES OF BARROW</title>
		<content> We found in a sample of 258 houses    
 that 80% were owner occupied of the   
 sample 13% are private tenant and 7%  
 are council tenant. The oldest house  
 is the Bishop Beveridge House it was  
 built in the 13th century. The Mock   
 Tudor house at 4a Beveridge Street was
 built in the 1600's. Within the last  
 25 years there have been some estates 
 built in Barrow. They are known as The
 Beaumont estate, The Lakes and The    
 Rivers. The Mount is probably the     
 biggest house in Barrow. As well as   
 The Mount, Barrow Cliffe house and    
 Stratcliffe House are both big houses.
 We found that 7% of houses had 2      
 bedrooms, 76% had 3 bedrooms, 15% had 
 4 bedrooms and 2% had 5 bedrooms.
