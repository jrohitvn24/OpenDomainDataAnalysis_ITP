 The area is rich agricultural         
 land,forming part of the Vale of      
 York.It is very flat except for some  
 embankments for bridges over the main 
 Newcastle_London railway.Most of the  
 fields contain arable                 
 crops,particularly wheat potatoes and 
 sugar beet though some is             
 pasture.Apart from outlying farm      
 houses the only centre of population  
 is part of Raskelf containing less    
 than 500 people.It is a twin          
 settlement,with 'the Green' separate  
 from the rest of Raskelf.In the Middle
 Ages the area was covered by the      
 Forest of Galtres.Today there are     
 still a few woods but they contain    
 mainly recently planted conifers      
 rather than the old oaks.In the south 
 west corner is part of Tholthorpe     
 airfield used in World War 2.         </content>
