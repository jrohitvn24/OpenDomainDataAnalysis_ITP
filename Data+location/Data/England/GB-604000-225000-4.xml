		<content>    It is thought that on the site of  
{Parsonage Farm}there used to be a     
 Saxon settlement.Parsonage Farm itself
 was built by{Jesus College}in about   
 1540.A{Parson}lived in the farmhouse  
 in the sixteenth century,which is how 
 it got its name,he also farmed the    
 sixty acres which belonged to it.Later
 it was changed into three cottages,   
 then two and now it is one cottage    
 again.It was bought and{renovated}by  
 the present owners in 1981, they are  
 only the second people to have owned  
 it. There used to be a{moat}around    
 the farmhouse which they think had a  
{drawbridge.                           
    Little is known about the history  
 of the farmhouse because the deeds are
 written in Medieval Latin and it has  
 not been translated as yet.{
