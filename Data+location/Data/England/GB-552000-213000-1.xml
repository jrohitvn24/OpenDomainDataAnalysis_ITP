		<title>01General Review of Area</title>
		<content> Our 12 square kilometre area is mainly
 agricultural land, the main crops     
 being wheat and barley.  There is just
 one village, Hatfield Heath which is  
 situated in the north-west.  This is a
 picturesque village which is extremely
 popular with tourists, especially in  
 the summer and six different roads    
 converge on the Heath.  The A1060     
 travels from north-west to south-east 
 across the block, the road crossing   
 Pincey Brook roughly in the middle of 
 the area. There are several farms, a  
 sewage works and a large abattoir.    
 There are a variety of different      
 dwellings and a selection of listed   
 buildings including Lea Hall and      
 Ongars which are both mentioned in the
 original Domesday Book.  With the news
 that Stansted Airport is to be        
 developed, villagers are aware of     
 inevitable changes to the area.       </content>
