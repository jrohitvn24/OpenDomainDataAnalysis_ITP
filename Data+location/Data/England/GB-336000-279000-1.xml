		<title>01THE CLUNBURY BLOCK</title>
		<content>   This block is rural farming country 
 in south Shropshire. There are three  
 villages in the block and three       
 hamlets, around the base of{Clunbury  
{Hill}which is a dominant feature of   
 the centre of the block. The          
 population is approximately two       
 thousand people. It is an area        
 becoming increasingly popular with    
 retired people and many young people  
 are leaving to seek employment        
 elsewhere. There are only two primary 
 schools in the block, one church and  
 no chapels left in use. The church is 
 part of a group ministry of five      
 churches with one rector. The rivers  
 of the{Clun}and{Kemp}flow west to east
 across the block, meeting to the north
 of Clunbury Hill. The area between the
 rivers was a marshy area but is now   
 farmed. There are postal collections  
 twice a day in the two main villages. </content>
