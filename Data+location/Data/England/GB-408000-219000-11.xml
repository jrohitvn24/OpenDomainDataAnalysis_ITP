		<title>11Population In Notgrove</title>
		<content> In this area, the main centre of      
 population is the village of Notgrove,
 with about 100 adults and only a few  
 children in about 30 houses. Most men 
 work on the farm. The population is   
 non-mobile, with only a few retired   
 people in the village. Most of the    
 cottages are owned by the Notgrove    
 Estate, with only 2 or 3 privately    
 owned. 1 or 2 cottages are let as     
 weekend cottages. The rest of the area
 is populated by only a handful of     
 houses scattered in the folds of the  
 hills. One of these, on the main A436 
 road, offers Bed and Breakfast        
 accommodation for passing motorists.  
 It offers 4 double bedrooms, but trade
 has been poor this summer of 1985     
 partly due to the bad holiday weather.
