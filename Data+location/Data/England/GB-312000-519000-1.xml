		<title>01LOWESWATER AREA</title>
		<content> Although Loweswater has few of the    
 modern amenities which characterize a 
 healthy village, no bus, shop or      
 school, it is a very viable community.
 Some work is available within the     
 area, and people are prepared to      
 travel to work outside the area.      
 Housing is a slight problem, houses   
 being both expensive and scarce.      
 Planning permission for new homes is  
 extremely difficult to obtain and     
 restrictive regulations make them     
 expensive to build. Recreation within 
 the area is well catered for, with so 
 many natural assets. Loweswater is    
 much appreciated, not only by those   
 who live there, but by those visitors 
 who return again and again to enjoy   
 its beauty.
