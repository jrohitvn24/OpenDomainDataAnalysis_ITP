		<content> The type of employment is varied.     
 There are a number of{small factories 
 in an industrial estate.A manufacturer
 of drawing office equipment{employs 18
 people, a boatyard and chandlers shop 
{12,}and a nursery and garden centre{7.
 The two pubs empoly local labour as do
 the restaurant and shops. The farms   
 employ little outside labour.         
{Labour relations}are good as the      
 workforce is fairly young and         
 interested in the work. There is an   
 independent attitude especially among 
 those working in family businesses.   
{Unemployment}is difficult to asses but
 it cannot be high and a number of     
 people work from home as one man      
 businesses.
