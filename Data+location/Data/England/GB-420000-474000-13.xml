		<content> All homes have Television &amp; Radio.    
 Some families own Home Computers &amp;    
 Video recorders, a rapidly developing 
 branch of home entertainment. We are a
 long way from cinema &amp; theatre. Most  
 people watch TV. Some occasionally eat
 out, frequent the local pub or take   
 part in the many village socities &amp;   
 clubs.                                
{Safety.}Some recent house break-ins   
 have meant an increase in burglar     
 alarms for more affluent looking      
 houses. Also stronger doors &amp; locks.  
 In comparison with town life, fewer   
 precautions are necessary &amp; some      
 windows doors &amp; cars are left unlocked
 Children wander &amp; play about each     
 village fairly freely. Neighbours do  
 excercise a supervising role because  
 all children are known. Road Safety is
 necessary, of course, &amp; children are  
 taught it at home &amp; school.           </content>
