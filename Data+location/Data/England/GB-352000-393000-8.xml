 We  approached the  general public, to
 discover their views on  unemployment.
 Unemployment  within our area of study
 stands at just over  10%. However only
 10% of  leavers  from  our  own school
 were employed in  September  1984. The
 first  question  asked  was, "What are
 your  views  on  unemployment today?".
 Out of ten people, they all  expreseed
 serious concern. We then asked the ten
 "What do  you think causes the lack of
 jobs?".  Answers  included  Government
 and technology. We then asked, "Should
 people  on  the dole get more money?".
 Seven  said "Yes" and three said "No".
 The  final  question was, "What do you
 think of the  Youth Training Scheme?".
 The majority concluded "slave labour".
