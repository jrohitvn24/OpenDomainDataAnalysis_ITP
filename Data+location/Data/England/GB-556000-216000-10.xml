 Committee was elected at a public     
 meeting called by the Parish Council  
 in 1979 to canvass views on proposed  
 expansion of airport.  Meeting was    
 opposed to any growth.  Committee     
 arranged fund raising events - dances,
 bonfire parties, sponsored walks.     
 Proceeds have helped finance          
 activities of North West Essex &amp; East 
 Herts Preservation Assocn.  At the    
 3rd Public Inquiry to investigate     
 merits of developmnt (1981-1983) 2    
 members of the group gave evidence and
 presented video film of village life. 
 Government approval for expansion of  
 airport given l985 initially for      
 capacity of 8 million.  Some local    
 opinion favours fullest use existing  
 capacity (currently underused) but not
 to extent that damages environment and
 lifestyle.                            </content>
