		<title>13PEOPLE (FROYLE/HOLYBOURNE)</title>
		<content> At Domesday Froyle had about 200      
 people; 23 smallholders and 10 slaves,
 all with families.  Froyle now has 871
 people, (over 100 at Treloar College),
 and its school of 24 pupils is about  
 to close.                             
                                       
                                       
 At Domesday Holybourne had only about 
 50 people; 6 villagers, 4 smallholders
 and 1 slave, Neatham nearby being much
 larger with 54 villagers, 26          
 smallholders and 16 slaves.  Much     
 recent new building in Holybourne has 
 caused a population rise, Holybourne  
 School now having over 100 pupils, but
 Neatham has declined to a small       
 hamlet.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
