		<title>10BAYSTON HILL FAMILY WEEKEND</title>

 My weekends are never empty they are  
 always full with things to do.On      
 Saturday I woke up it was a lovely    
 sunny morning so I jumped out of bed  
 already fully awake and hurriedly got 
 dressed and went out to play.         
 Presently I heard Mum calling me in   
 for breakfast I scoffed that down and 
 flew out to play with my friends. I   
 jogged down to Ella's house and asked 
 her down to mine.We played on my      
 scrambling net and we had a game of   
 swingball.I was called in for dinner. 
 Ella went home. After dinner my family
 and I hopped into the car.We drove to 
 Church Stretton to have a walk.After  
 our walk we drove to the Little Chef  
 to have our tea. I was tired so we    
 went home to bed.
