		<content> We have two places of worship in the  
 village, St. Saviours Church and the  
 Congregational Chapel.                
 The Church was built in 1892, the     
 Chapel was built in 1847.             
 The minister and the vicar both start 
 their days early in the morning.      
 The vicar is supposed to only work a  
 six day week but both gentleman said  
 they were always available to anyone  
 needing their help.                   
 During the week their time is spent   
 studying, visiting and preparing      
 sermons.                              
 The people attending services tend to 
 be the very young and the elderly.    
 There are less people attending places
 of worship now than there used to be.
