		<content>   Computers have become an integral   
 part of many of the{homes}in Loughton.
 The majority of them are used for     
 games, one of the most popular at the 
 moment being 'Chuckie Egg'. Computers 
 are also used in{schools.}The BBC'B'  
 in many of the local primary schools  
 and the Linx 380Z at Epping Forest    
 High School. CGL(Computer Games       
 Ltd.) are makers of many of the small 
 hand held games and one of the few    
 electronical{businesses}in Loughton.  
  One of our fathers is a{policeman}and
 the computer has made many changes to 
 his job. With the press of a button on
 the keyboard he can call up a criminal
 record. Fingerprints can be checked   
 against those of other criminals or he
 can check numberplates of stolen cars.
 Even different faces can be made up on
 a computer for an Identification      
 Parade.                               </content>
