		<title>09RESIDENT INTERVIEW</title>
		<content>    Mr.Paulson has lived in the area   
 for seventy years,and his family have 
 lived here for about a thousand.      
    The area has obviously changed a   
 lot in that seventy years. He says    
 that the biggest change he has noticed
 has been the large increase in the    
 building of houses. The area has      
 changed into a small number of        
 communities, i.e. Rowsley, Darley Dale
 etc, rather than lots of different    
 groups of houses.                     
   Mr. Paulson thinks that the area is 
 too built up and said, "There are far 
 too many strangers and that there     
 ought to be more comunity facilities  
 than there are now".                  
   As a child he went to Churchtown    
 School, Darley Dale, and then to the  
 Earnest Bailey Grammar School,        
 Matlock. He knows a great deal about  
 the area, both past and present.      </content>
