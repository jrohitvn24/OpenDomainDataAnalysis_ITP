		<title>02BRISTOL,ST.WERBURGH'S FARM</title>
		<content> On May 1 we went to city farm.First we
 saw 3 Jacob sheep with 4 black lambs. 
 In with them there were some hens     
 with lovely brown feathers and one    
 white cockerel.Then we saw the nanny  
 goats with their white kids.The kids  
 were lively and curious.They ate paper
 sucked Paul's pen and jumped off the  
 bench whilst body popping.One even ate
 Miss Brazier's skirt!Another escaped  
 from the pen!                         
  Then we went to see the rabbits,there
 were lots of little dwarf rabbits and 
 one big rabbit.The man showed us one  
 of the dwarf rabbits We all stroked   
 it.It was brown and we all wanted one.
  Some of us went to see the pigs.There
 were some small pigs feeding from     
 their mother they were black and      
 white.                                
 It was all great fun!
