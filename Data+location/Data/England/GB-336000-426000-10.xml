		<content>   The main use of the land is         
 Pastoral.There are two main farms     
 within the area of study,Brook Farm   
 consisting of 77 acres on which Dairy 
 farming and replacement farming take  
 place. Little Carrside Farm consisting
 of 85 acres dates back to the 17th.   
 Century.                              
   Dairy Farming is the main farming   
 type.The only crop grown is grass for 
 silage,which is used to feed the      
 cattle.Because the land is low-lying  
 it is affected by the tide but this   
 only affects 10 of the 85 acres.      
   The busiest times of the year are   
 between May and December.The Guardian 
 farms have some electric fencing.They 
 employ 22 people,their busiest time is
 between September to October.The      
 Guardian has owned the farm since     
 1963.
