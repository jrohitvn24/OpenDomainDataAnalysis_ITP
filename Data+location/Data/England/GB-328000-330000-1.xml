  The area forms an undulationg  slope 
 between the Welsh Hills and the       
 Shropshire Plain. The height drops    
 from 2OOm in west to 1OOm in east.It  
 is wooded with deciduous trees and the
 hedgerows have a wide variety of      
 trees.                                
 Several large buildings dominatee     
 their rural surroundings, Orthopaedic 
 Hospital, Derwen College, Whittington 
 House. The central area is reclaimed  
 land from the army where sports       
 facilities, farming and a special     
 gypsy site are the main uses.         
 The south west corner is an area of   
 houses built when the railway came to 
 Oswestry. It has had environmental    
 improvements.                         
 Dairy farming is the chief occupation 
 so grass, barley, and fodder crops    
 occupy most of the fields.            </content>
