    A walk around the area reveals a   
 wide range of fauna. In a single visit
 to the{canal}we were able to identify 
 many and varied species. Using        
 home-made nets of our mother's tights 
 we caught the following:-             
 *water boatmen    *water beetles      
 *water snails     *freshwater prawns  
 *leeches          *tadpoles           
 and various other mini-beasts.        
    Frogs can be seen and we saw many  
 eel nets which are left out over night
 at certain times of the year to catch 
 the eels and elvers as they move up   
 and down the canal. They are then     
 fried and are a local{custom}and      
 delicacy. Many anglers use the canal  
 for{recreation}and fish for gudgeon,  
 minnows, sticklebacks, roach, rudd,   
 tench and the occasional carp.        </content>
