		<content>The soils are heavy clay and Greensand.
On the stoney soils, feed barley is    
grown. The wheat, sown in September, is
high protein and used for milling to   
produce bread. Grass is cut for silage 
in July and taken to a pit at the      
dairy. 1000 tons of grain are fed into 
a grain drier. The barley is rolled and
in the hopper other ingredients are    
added eg sugar beet pulp.              
There are 50ton bins for grain storage.
A tractor loads grain onto a conveyer  
to be taken to  Wallingford or         
Southampton. There is still an old     
granary in the grounds with arches     
beneath to keep grain off the wet      
ground, built of timber and red brick. 
Other buildings include a brick barn,  
a workshop, 300 yr old farmhouse, and  
a new house and offices, and a grain   
store.There are 3 full time workers and
machine repairs are done by suppliers. </content>
