		<title>17SWINLEY PARK, BRACKNELL.</title>
		<content>   The{Rides}in the Park were used by  
 huntsmen.  These are narrow and the   
 trees above overlap, unlike the       
{fire-breaks}which are much wider.     
 Some of the main{tracks}in the Park   
 were built by the Army during the     
 Second World War.  Ammunition was     
 moved to and from secret brick and    
 concrete bunkers.  The remains of     
 these ammunition "dumps" are in       
 evidence today.                       
                                       
{  Animals}such as deer, foxes,        
 squirrels and rabbits are often seen  
 by people walking in this part of the 
 forest.                               
                                       
  {Fences}and fencing stakes are made  
 from softwood like Scots Pine, brought
 in from other parts of the Crown      
 Estate as the trees in Swinley Park   
 are not yet mature enough for use.    </content>
