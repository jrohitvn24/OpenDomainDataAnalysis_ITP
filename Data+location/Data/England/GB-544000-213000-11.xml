		<title>11PISHIOBURY</title>
		<content>  Pishiobury Park covers two hundred   
 and fifty acres and in it is the old  
 house built from designs by James     
 Wyatt.The house built beside a lake   
 has a drive nearly a mile long and    
 was the site of an old manor house    
 .Inside some wall panelling and other 
 fittings survive from the Elizabethan 
 manor house built by Sir Walter       
 Mildemay which was later burned       
 down.Later Pishiobury was used as a   
 School .Now they want to turn it into 
 offices and build houses where the    
 stables used to be .That will mean    
 twice as many cars going up and down  
 Pishiobury drive.Before they do all   
 that they have to get a document      
 signed by the council.I think it will 
 spoil the countryside around the      
 school.They can't build on Pishiobury 
 because of the green belt.
