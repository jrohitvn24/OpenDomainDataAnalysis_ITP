		<title>02MR SAWYER'S POSTCARDS</title>
		<content>  Mr Sawyer started collecting         
 postcards by taking a picture of his  
 own house and having it enlarged. He  
 now has{over a hundred postcards}which
 he keeps in a book.{All the postcards 
{are of local interest.                
  He gets them from local sources and  
 Antique Markets around here and       
 further afield. He usually gets more  
 postcards of this area from           
 Bournemouth and more distant places.  
 Mr Sawyer has one very old postcard of
 Netheravon which shows the old tree by
 the post office. In those days  it    
 didn't have a bench around it but now 
 it has got one. Some have got girls on
 them wearing frilly dresses.          
  Mr Sawyer's favourite postcard is the
 one of his own house.
