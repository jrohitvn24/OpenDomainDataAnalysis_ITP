		<content> When it has been necessary to remove  
 trees to make way for buildings or    
 testing areas trees have been planted 
 elsewhere in greater numbers.The      
 periphery is bounded by quite a high  
 hedge,this is mixed and typical of the
 area.An attractive way to ensure      
 privacy.                              
 The land surrounding the runways is   
 leased to a local farmer, and used for
 arable farming.                       
 Security is much in evidence, and     
 visitors have to report to the        
 security lodge before the barrier is  
 raised for them to enter.School       
 children are not normally welcome for 
 educational visits. However because of
 The Domesday Project a small group of 
 children and a teacher were shown     
 round the Proving Ground in a Ford van
 by a manager.The children found the   
 place fascinating.                    </content>
