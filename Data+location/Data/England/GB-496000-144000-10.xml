		<title>10Godalming Times Newspaper</title>
		<content> The Godalming Times publishes 8 000   
 newspapers a week, and they have been 
 publishing newspapers for about 121   
 years. They employ 2 full-time and 1  
 part-time journalist. They have one   
 printing press and a technician but if
 a computer breaks down the paper may  
 be delayed. It takes 1 week to prepare
 the paper, 12 hours to sort out which 
 information goes on which page, and it
 takes 12 minutes to print it.         
 Disasters hit the headlines every week
 for example, this week's headline is  
 "Animals are dying from poisoning".   
 The Godalming Times has many letters  
 sent to the paper each week about     
 local issues and national events.
