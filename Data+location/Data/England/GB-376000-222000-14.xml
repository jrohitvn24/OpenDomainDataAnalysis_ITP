		<content> Hartpury village covers a wide area   
 because originally it consisted of    
 'Ends' e.g. Murrells End, Moorend,    
 Blackwells End. The 'End' signifies a 
 clearance in a forest at the end of a 
 path to a hamlet. Traces of these old 
 stone and timber framed buildings are 
 still seen today. In C19th, New Court 
 House,now Hartpury House, was built   
 for the Canning Family, who built many
 brick houses on their estate          
 (identifiable by 'GC' markings);      
 building materials were obtained from 
 Brick Pits Quarry in Ashleworth Lane. 
 The only building in C20th has been   
 at Danford Villas except for a few    
 individual developments. Similarly    
 most buildings in Highleadon and      
 Rudford are scattered and date from   
 previous centuries, except for a      
 council development built about 1945.
