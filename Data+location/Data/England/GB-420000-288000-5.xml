		<title>05Maxstoke-a child's view.</title>
		<content>  Maxstoke Castle is surrounded by     
 trees.It is a small castle but it has 
 had bits added on.I noticed that the  
 castle had glass in the windows.      
 When we were going down the lane,we   
 saw Dukes Bridge.It was very old and  
 made of stone.We went straight        
 across.We saw it on the maps as       
 well.The land around Maxstoke is      
 mostly arable.That means that it has  
 crops.We saw pastures with cows in as 
 well.The first time we got off the    
 mini-bus we went down a public        
 footpath.We saw some remains of some  
 old railway lines.They had been       
 covered with dirt and gravel.Now it   
 was a track to a place called Castle  
 Farm.Near the castle there was lots of
 woodland.It had lots of trees and     
 hedges.We saw a place called Birch    
 Wood.I wondered if woodland had       
 anything to do with it.               </content>
