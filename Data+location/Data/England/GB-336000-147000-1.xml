 Highbridge and Burnham-on-Sea are  4  
 miles to the West. The nearest town   
 East of Mark is Wedmore 4 miles       
 away. There are several small hamlets 
 lying within a 3 mile radius of the   
 Causeway,which runs through the       
 village.Yarrow and Southwick lie to   
 the South and Northwick and Vole lie  
 to the North.                         
 This village of 1000+ inhabitants is  
 mainly a farming community with many  
 fine dairy herds living off good moist
 grazing land. Many small local        
 industries have survived and flourish.
 Young people are well catered for with
 sports facilities and halls for youth 
 activities. There is a small tourist  
 trade existing amicably with retired  
 locals and "foreigners" alike.        </content>
