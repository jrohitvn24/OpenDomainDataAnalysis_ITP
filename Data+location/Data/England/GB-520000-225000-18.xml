		<title>18STEVENAGE CYCLEWAYS</title>
		<content> Stevenage was planned from the start  
 to allow safe movement of all kinds of
 traffic.  Since 1962 most new housing 
 estates have been built on the Radburn
 principle,separating motorists from   
 pedestrians. Provision has also been  
 made for cyclists by means of a system
 of cycleways covering about 40        
 kilometres. This minature highway     
 network runs alongside the primary    
 routes with underpasses at all major  
 junctions. The system was designed    
 mainly to cater for journeys to work, 
 school and to reach the town          
 centre.Wherever possible links have   
 also been made with the parks and     
 recreation areas. The most popular    
 length of the cycleways has been known
 to carry over 1100 cycles and mopeds  
 per hour at peak travel time. The     
 cycleways have helped to make the town
 one of the safest in Britain.         </content>
