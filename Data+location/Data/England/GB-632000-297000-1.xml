		<title>01SISLAND AND SURROUNDINGS</title>
		<content> The parish of Sisland has 38          
 inhabitants. Mixed arable agriculture 
 in family farms is the only industry  
 the area has ever had. Cattle, pigs,  
 chickens and turkeys are reared here  
 and pheasants for shooting. The houses
 are large. Old farm buildings are too 
 small for modern farm machinery and   
 are either being converted to houses  
 or being allowed to decay. New housing
 estates for Norwich commuters are     
 appearing at the edges of the area.   
 Hedges have largely disappeared. Small
 belts of trees are being planted. Half
 of the houses are not connected to    
 mains water or sewer. All are         
 connected to electricity. There is a  
 victorian letter box in a barn wall.  
 There are no shops. Grass grows in the
 middle of the roads and rubbish is    
 dumped in a parish pit. Churches are  
 used and well cared for.              </content>
