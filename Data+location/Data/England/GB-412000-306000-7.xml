		<title>07MY HOBBY; SCOUTING.</title>
		<content>Scouts are a group of boys who do a    
variety of activities such as tieing   
knots, lashing and making things for   
use in emergencies, just for fun or for
camp.                                  
  Going to camp is my favourite        
activity. We usually go for a weekend, 
but sometimes we go for as long as a   
week. At camp we sleep in tents which  
are made out of canvas and can be large
enough to fit ten people or small      
enough to fit one. At camp we cook on  
fires which we light with a match! (In 
the olden days they used to rub two    
sticks together to get a spark - which 
is virtually impossible!)              
  Whilst at camp we do long hikes,     
usually walking about 12Km or more. We 
also do canoeing and rock climbing.    
  I am a patrol leader. I have an      
assistant patrol leader and six other  
Scouts in my patrol.                   </content>
