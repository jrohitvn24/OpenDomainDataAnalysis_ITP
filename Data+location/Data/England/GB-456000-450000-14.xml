		<content>    {A Day in My Life.                 
  I wake up at 7:25 am and get up at   
 7:45.After I have washed and dressed I
 see to my chores.Then I have          
 breakfast,Cornflakes or Shreddies,and 
 toast.School starts at 9:00 and       
 finishes at 3:30.First we have        
 assembly followed by Maths and        
 English,later we have our dinner.     
  In the afternoon we have Art and     
 Craft.One day a week we go swimming.  
  In the evening I have my tea at 6:00 
 and watch TV.I often do hobbies.I go  
 to aerobics-exercising to pop music-at
 Priory Street.I attend a drama class  
 at Scarcroft School,which is great    
 fun.At other times I have a tennis    
 class,again at Priory Street,and I am 
 a girl guide.                         
  Bedtime is about 9:00 pm.Sometimes I 
 wish it was later because I would like
 to see some later TV programmes.      </content>
