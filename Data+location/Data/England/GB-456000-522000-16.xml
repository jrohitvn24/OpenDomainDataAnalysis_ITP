		<title>16NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content>  The reserve lies immediately to the  
 west of Redcar ,in an area that was   
 originally saltmarsh.It is probably   
 the most ecologically valuable wetland
 area south of the Tees in Cleveland.  
 Due to drainage and land filling,only 
 about 50 acres remain as fresh water  
 marsh.The rest of the reserve consists
 of landscaped mounds and pools.A      
 drainage canal which runs through the 
 marshland broadens at the western end 
 into a sedged_fringed pool.The total  
 reserve area is 54 hectares. Until    
  1850,Coatham Marsh extended to the   
 river Tees and the monks from         
 Guisbrough collected salt from 3 salt 
 hills on the marsh.Successive develop_
 ments reduced the marsh to the present
 50acres of freshwater marsh, but the  
 reserve also includes newly mounded   
 land with 2 interesting lakes, con_   
 structed 10 yrs ago on a refuse tip.  </content>
