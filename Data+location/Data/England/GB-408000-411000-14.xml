		<content> Moor End Farm is owned by Arthur      
 Sykes, it covers 165 acres and is near
 South Crosland village. Mr. Sykes has 
 three workers on his farm. In addition
 to his son,he has a man who drives the
 tractors and other machinery and a man
 who comes in to milk the cows.        
  Mr. Sykes has 90 Friesian cows and a 
 bull, 75 of which were milking when we
 visited the farm. He also has 70      
 calves. Last year the herd produced   
 12,750 gallons of milk, most of which 
 was bottled and sold to five local    
 milkmen, 30 gallons of milk a day is  
 pasteurised. Any surplus milk is sold 
 to the milk marketing board. Mr. Sykes
 uses his land to grow grass which he  
 turns into silage to feed his cattle  
 in winter. He buys compound cake to   
 give to his animals. Mr. Sykes has    
 been a farmer all his life.
