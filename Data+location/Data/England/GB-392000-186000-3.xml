		<content>    The{Malmesbury Commoners}meet      
 several times a year in the{Old       
{Courthouse.}This building has had a   
 number of uses. It was built between  
 1250 and 1300 as a hospital for the   
 Knights of St. John, and for a time   
 housed lepers. The hospital was closed
 down with the dissolution of the      
 monasteries in 1535, and was taken    
 over by the{Old Corporation.}From 1600
 it was used as a school for the boys  
 (not girls!) of Commoners. Our guide, 
 Mr.{Bowen,}told us his grandfather was
 a pupil here, his grandmother went to 
 a dame school above the Abbey doorway.
 We saw the pupils' desks, like A.G.   
 1781. The teacher sat on a high       
 platform, and had a small stock       
 cupboard, still carefully labelled.
