		<content> This area, mainly in the North-western
 corner of Leicestershire, is          
 predominantly arable farmland and     
 includes two villages, Wilson and     
 Isley Walton. Wilson falls just within
 Leicestershire.                       
 The Derby/Leicestershire county       
 boundary traverses northwards to the  
 outskirts of Donington Park and       
 continues around the western side of  
 the latter before crossing the River  
 Trent. The A453 Nottingham to         
 Birmingham trunk road provides easy   
 access to this area.                  
 An important feature of the area is   
 Donington Hall and Park. The hall is  
 now the headquarters of British       
 Midland Airways and access to the park
 is strictly limited. About half of the
 area which was Donington Park is now  
 Donington Park Racing Circuit         
 including the Museum of Motor Racing. </content>
