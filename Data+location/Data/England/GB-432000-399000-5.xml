		<title>05The M.1.motorway.</title>
		<content> The M.1.motorway runs close to        
 Tankersley and Pilley cutting them off
 from Hoyland Common and Birdwell.It   
 does,however,make long distance travel
 much easier for local people.         
                                       
 We asked some local people what they  
 thought about the motorway.They all   
 felt it was a mixed blessing.None of  
 the people we talked to felt it 'cut  
 them off'from people and services on  
 the other side of the road as there   
 are an adequate number of bridges.The 
 main complaints were about the noise  
 and the dust.
