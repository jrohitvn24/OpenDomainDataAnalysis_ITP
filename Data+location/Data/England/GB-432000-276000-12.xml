		<content> The sector has a wide cross section of
 types of housing.It ranges from       
 property over 100 years old to modern 
 housing and from private to council   
 owned property.                       
{COUNCIL HOUSING.                      
 Much of the council property is flats 
 where large numbers of people can live
 in a small area.This can cause many   
 social problems.There are also houses 
 that are usually built close together.
{PRIVATE HOUSING.                      
 Part of the area of private housing   
 was built nearly 70 years ago when    
 houses were needed quickly for people 
 coming into a booming industrial city.
 They were mainly terraced back to back
 houses.More recently the houses built 
 have been semi-detatched with larger  
 gardens and more space between them.  
 The property to the south is often    
 detatched and the more expensive kind.</content>
