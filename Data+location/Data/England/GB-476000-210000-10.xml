		<title>10CALLEY FARM</title>
		<content>Calley Farm is owned by Farmer Giles.  
He owns 108 cows and he has one        
Hereford bull. He built his own milking
machine which  can milk 12 cows at a   
time.                                  
He grows hay, barley and other crops.  
His first lot of hay he makes into     
bales, his second he makes into silage.
They do their own maintenance, mending 
the tractors and other vehicles. They  
have a few tractors and two combine    
harvesters.                            
Some of the crops are crushed because  
of children playing in the fields.
