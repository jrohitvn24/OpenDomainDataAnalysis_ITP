		<title>11George Fentham School (Poem)</title>
		<content> As we went into{school,}              
 There was such a noise,               
 Coming from the girls and boys.       
 We went into class,                   
 When I heard people yelling.          
 I remembered my spelling              
{Teacher}t.e.a.c.h.e.r.                
 The teacher came in                   
 He looked quite pleased.              
 That nobody teased                    
 "Get out your busy books."            
 He told the story of{George Fentham.} 
 George Fentham was clever at work.    
 He built our school _                 
 The story went on  _                  
 As we listened to the lecture,        
 From the teacher,                     
 We were wondering,                    
 When a loud warbler went off.         
 It was playtime when we have a break. 
 We ran around and took a deep breath, 
 As George Fentham was left at death.  </content>
