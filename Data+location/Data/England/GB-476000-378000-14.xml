		<content> The old Chapel was demolished two or  
 three years ago. The new Chapel is    
 still in use.                         
     The village used to be served by  
 two butchers from Rampton and a baker.
 A horse drawn fish and chip van also  
 called at the village. A grocer came  
 from Retford and a pots and pans man  
 from near by Dunham.                  
     The farmers sold milk and butter  
 to the village and most people kept a 
 pig to fatten and kill. There was a   
 station at South Leverton and as local
 carrier would collect fruit and       
 vegetables to send to Sheffield       
 Market.                               
     Electricity supply was installed  
 in 1935 and mains water came in 1936.
