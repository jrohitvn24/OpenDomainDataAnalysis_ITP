		<title>06Restored Buildings.</title>
		<content> In{Redditch}we have tried to preserve 
 as many old buildings as possible.{   
{Marlfield Barn}in Church Hill which   
 has been converted into Community     
 Rooms is an example of this. The{Craft
{Centre}in{Winyates}is a restored set  
 of farm out-buildings. Here, pottery, 
 leatherwork, needlecraft, jewellery   
 and instrument making can be seen and 
 purchased in the craft shop. The most 
 impressive restored building is{Forge 
{Mill.}It is the world's only water    
 driven needle scouring mill and has   
 been restored to working order. In    
 June 1983 H.R.H. Queen Elizabeth II   
 opened the mill as the{National Needle
{Museum.}It is a working museum which  
 displays each stage of needle making. 
 There is also a static display called 
 "Thousands of uses for millions of    
 needles". Redditch-made needles secure
 the tiles of N.A.S.A.'s space shuttle.</content>
