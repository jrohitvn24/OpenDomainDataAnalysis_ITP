		<content>   Opposite the Morganite Crucible     
 factory there lies a mile of rough    
 grassland beyond which one can see    
 what is known as Norton Hall. Over the
 years it has become derelict after    
 being neglected by its owner.  It was 
 purchased by a consortium in 1984 who 
 are now restoring the hall. The local 
 gentry used to own and live in the    
 hall. It is interesting to note that  
 all the farm labourers cottages that  
 remain, that used to belong to the    
 estate, have been restored for use to 
 day. Many of these householders own a 
 few sheep or ducks. The stables are   
 now used as equipment sheds. Most     
 people maintains an attractive garden.
 The  Hall used to be an Army barracks.
 The locals are pleased to see it being
 restored to its former glory.
