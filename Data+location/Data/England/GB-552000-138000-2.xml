		<title>02PUBS AND RESTAURANTS</title>
		<content>{PUBS} In this part of England a pub is
 more than just a building where       
 alcohol can be bought and consumed: a 
 village's pub can be it's main - and  
 sometimes it's only - social gathering
 place.                                
   Of the four pubs in the area two,   
 The Chafford Arms and The Grange, are 
 owned by Whitbread and one, The       
 Greyhound, by Courage. The remaining  
 pub, the two hundred-year-old High    
 Rocks Inn, is a free house. All have  
 been pubs for at least fifty years.   
   Each pub serves meals, but only the 
 Grange and the Greyhound have seperate
 restaurants. All have beer gardens    
 except The Greyhound, which is also   
 the only one that offers accomodation.
{RESTAURANTS} The only restaurant in   
 the area, L'Etoile, serves french     
 style meals. It has a licence, but    
 meals cost more than in the pubs.     </content>
