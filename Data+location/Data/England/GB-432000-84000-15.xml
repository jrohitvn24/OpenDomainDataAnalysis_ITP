 My teacher would  call out a register.
 A register is a book with names of    
 pupils in the class.  After that we   
 will have to line up for asembley.  An
 assembley is a place where we sing and
 say prayers.  Then we would go back to
 our classrooms for lessons.  Then a   
 bell would go and we  would go out to 
 play.  In a playground or field.  Then
 we would hear the bell and line up    
 outside the classroom.  Sometimes we  
 would go to another room for science, 
 C.D.T. library and music.  After our  
 lessons another bell would go and we  
 would have lunch.  We either have     
 snacks, dinners, sandwiches or go home
 for dinner.  To get snacks or dinners 
 we would have to have a ticket or     
 card.  Then more lessons until the    
 bell went.                            </content>
