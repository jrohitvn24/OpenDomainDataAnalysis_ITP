		<title>07Plympton Lamb Feast</title>
		<content>   {Elizabeth 1st }granted a charter   
 for a weekly market. The market was on
 Saturday. There were two fairs held   
 each year. One of the fairs took place
 on the {Eve of the Ascension }the     
 other was on the {Feast of the Blessed
{Virgin Mary.                          
{   }We have a {Lamb Feast }every year.
 This year it was on the 29th June. The
 Lamb Feast is organised by the {      
{Plympton St Maurice Civic Association.
    At the Lamb Feast they cook a whole
 lamb. Our school {(Plympton St Maurice
{Primary School) }has several stalls at
 the Lamb Feast each year. We usually  
 have "Spin the Wheel". We take part so
 we can raise money for the school.    
 This year we raised Â£95 that will be  
 spent on things for the school.
