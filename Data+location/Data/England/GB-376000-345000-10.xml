		<title>10MADELEY STAFFS : MORE CLUBS</title>
		<content>1 men's &amp; 2 ladies'bowls teams operate 
from the Working Men's Club.At the Swan
public house,2fishing clubs hold their 
meetings:Madeley Anglers &amp; Madeley Sea 
Anglers.                               
 A football club,Madeley White Star,has
its own pitch &amp; hopes to raise enough  
money to build a club house &amp; changing 
rooms.The cricket club owns its pitch  
and pavilion at Lycett,and plays in the
Staffordshire league.Its future seems  
secure.                                
 For those who feel no longer young or 
fit enough to join the clubs mentioned,
there is a pensioners'club,which meets 
in the Village Hall,every Tuesday after
-noon,when they have tea with friends. 
The villagers raise money during the   
year to pay for an annual outing &amp; meal
for them.Thus the community is well-   
provided for;though not everyone wants 
to belong to an organisation or club.  </content>
