		<title>14A JAMAICAN SUNDAY</title>
		<content>On Sunday morning I get up at 9.30 and 
get washed and dressed. I go downstairs
and eat my breakfast of akee-a         
fruit,saltfish and rice.Then a minibus 
arrives at 10.45 and takes us to our   
Pentecostal Church.When we get there we
meet many of our friends and chat      
before we go in. Most of the people at 
my church are black.We sing a lot of   
gospel hymns and people stand and      
dance.The Minister stands and we pray  
and he tells us something from the     
Bible.The children have to learn about 
the Bible.The service goes on for three
hours.Then we go home in the minibus   
for a dinner of brown rice,peas,chicken
and stuffing.My Dad makes a drink      
called Ginger Punch from fruit juice   
and ginger.Friends come after dinner   
and we speak in patois and play Reggae 
music.
