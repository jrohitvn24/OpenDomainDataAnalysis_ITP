		<title>04SMEATHARPE - FARMS</title>
		<content> The area surrounding Smeatharpe has 1O
 farms, namely: Burrow's, The Knowle,  
 Gotleigh, Chapelhayes, Riggle's,      
 Gorwell, Bywood, Gullylane, Mathayes, 
 and Fair Oak.  Bywood and Gorwell     
 are reputed to have been mentioned in 
 the first Domesday Book when they were
 entered as Biude and Gorwelle.  Buide 
 Farm is believed to have been part of 
 the Dunkeswell Abbey estate where the 
 monks had the farm producing corn.    
 As will be seen from the landcover    
 categories on the grid map, most of   
 the farmland is used for silage, hay  
 or grazing for dairy cattle.  There is
 some arable farming, some enclosed    
 rough grazing, (particularly around   
 Gotleigh and Hense Moors) and a small 
 area of woodland at Fair Oak Farm     
 where the land drops down.            
                                       
                                       </content>
