     {Thurle Grange}has been a farm    
 since 1544 and was owned by a family  
 called Allen until 1890. The present  
 building is{Edwardian}and was built in
 1910 and is divided into different    
{apartments.}Mr. McCulloch, who farms  
 in this area, lives in one third of   
 the house, while his son lives in     
 another third. The rest of the house  
 is rented out as flats to the public. 
      At the entrance there are 2 tall 
 gate-posts,made of flints and bricks. 
 The{flints}are local building material
 collected from the top of the Downs.  
 In the garden, by the entrance there  
 is an old well which is now covered   
 up.
