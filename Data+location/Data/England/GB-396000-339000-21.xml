<title>21Huntley Wood (former quarry)</title>
<content>

Quarrying ceased at Huntley Wood in about the year 2000 or shortly after.  In 2010 it was purchased by Argoncroft Ltd, a family company run by husband-and-wife team Jonathan Ely &amp; Emma King.  They applied for and received planning permission (granted in April 2011) to turn the former quarry into an outdoor recreation and leisure venue, which it is hoped will be open in Spring 2011.   &lt;br />
