		<title>17WILD FLOWERS</title>
		<content>{Andrew:}I was looking for wild flowers
 and I found{Bird's Foot Trefoil.      
{Sarah:}I like the{Field Poppy}best    
 because it is my favourite colour.{   
{Julia:} I found{Field Scabious}in the 
 meadow of the pumping station down    
 Paradise Lane.{Vincent:}I was         
 walking down Church Road and saw a    
 flower growing out of the hedge.  It  
 was a {Buttercup.} My mum put it under
 my chin and it glowed on my chin. {   
{Christopher:} I went for a walk and   
 found twenty different wild flowers. {
{Jesse:} Near a ditch I found just one 
{Jack-in-the-pulpit.  Nicholas:}One day
 Christopher brought in some flowers.  
 They were very rare.  Rare means there
 are not many left.{Ruth:} Wild flowers
 have a nice smell and a nice colour.{ 
{Donna:}My favourite flower is a{Daisy}
 because you can make a daisy chain.{  
{Jonathan:}I found{Dog's Mercury.}     </content>
