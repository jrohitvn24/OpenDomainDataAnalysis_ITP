		<title>17HAIR STYLES IN WIVELISCOMBE</title>
		<content> We interviewed a lady from a local    
 salon which employs several           
 ex-Kingsmead girls.Over the last five 
 years fashion has changed a lot,from  
 longer to shorter styles.The most     
 popular styles today are layered bobs 
 and short spikey hair.                
 The salon has 80-100 customers a week 
 numbers having increased over the last
 few years.Most people who have their  
 hair dyed are having blonde dye or    
 high lights or brown dye low lights to
 cover up grey hair.Occasionally people
 moan about how things turn out.       
 Apprentice hairdressers have to train 
 for three years and then take an exam 
 to qualify.                           
 The salon hasn't styled any punk heads
 yet.Some children get it done in      
 Taunton but often you find that they  
 have done it themselves or with       
 friends.                              </content>
