		<content> It was found that many of the people  
 that lived in this area kept{dogs}not 
 only for pets but to protect          
 themselves from{burglary.}Some people 
 said that they were frightened to open
 their doors to strangers.Many of the  
 dogs are allowed to roam around the   
 streets and there was dogs waste all  
 over the pavements.{Litter}was also a 
 problem and there were papers,cartons 
 and plastic containers on the         
 pavements and in the gardens.This may 
 be due to the lack of litter bins in  
 the area.                             
 Almost half of the people who were    
 interviewed thought that{vandalism}was
 the main problem in the area. Empty   
 houses had been vandalised and others 
 had their windows boarded up. There   
 was a great deal of grafitti on walls 
 and bus shelters and many young people
 hang around the street corners.       </content>
