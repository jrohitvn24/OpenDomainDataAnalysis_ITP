		<title>15SHIPWRECKS NEAR BUDE</title>
		<content> During the 19th century there were    
 several ship-wrecks along this coast.A
 lot of ship-wrecks occurred near      
{Northcott Mouth.}They included the    
 Surprise whose cargo was Clovelly     
 Skiff, sloop which was importing      
 oats, Ann'of St.Ives' which carried   
 copper ore.In all the ships the crew  
 were drowned.The remains of the       
 Crystal Spring where auctioned in     
 1850.The hull, spars and masts where  
 bought by the Petherick brothers for  
 10 guineas and the rest of the boat   
 was sold for 9 shillings.             
 Today the remains of a hull and boiler
 of a wreck can be seen on the north   
 side of{Northcott Mouth.}At times the 
 sea almost buries it in sand, though  
 sometimes the wreck is more visible as
 the sea scours away the beach.Some    
 remains have been taken to a museum in
{Bude}near the canal lock-gates.       </content>
