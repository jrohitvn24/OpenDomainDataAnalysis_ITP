		<title>14UPTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The sub postmistress at Upton used to 
 have an ice cream caravan at          
 Wimbleball Lake but gave it up because
 it was just too expensive. She had to 
 tow the caravan there every day and   
 after paying the rates for hire of the
 site and the petrol there was little  
 left. She once spent a whole afternoon
 there and only took 27p!              
                                       
 There have been quite a few changes in
 the area over the last 50 years. Many 
 of the old people have moved away to  
 old peoples homes to be replaced by   
 people new to the village - foreigners
 according to the locals!              
 There used to be a village school but 
 this was closed over ten years ago and
 now children have to go by bus to     
 schools in Wiveliscombe or Bampton.
