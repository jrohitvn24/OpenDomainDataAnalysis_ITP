		<title>12The Fete - Barby</title>
		<content>The following is taken from a report   
printed in the "Rugby Advertiser" on   
27th June 1985.                        
                                       
Last Saturday, despite a cool and windy
day, Barby 'Grande Fete' took place and
proved a very lively and popular event.
There were stalls selling cakes,       
sweets,plants, crafts and bric-a-brac  
and a variety of games of skill and    
chance for visitors to try.  The swing 
boats proved a big attraction for the  
younger visitors.  Adults enjoyed an   
interesting display of photographs of  
Barby, past and present.  A display    
was put on by Barby School children.   
A pleasing total of seven hundred      
pounds was made for the Church         
Restoration Appeal.
