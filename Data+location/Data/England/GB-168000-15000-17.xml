		<title>17Pastimes and hobbies</title>
		<content> We asked all the children in our      
 class what they did in their spare    
 time.The most popular pastime is      
 watching television! Most of the boys 
 go fishing in the sea for fish, crabs 
 and lobster.We all like going swimming
 in the sea in the summer. One girl    
 usually starts swimming in July when  
 it is warm enough for her but not for 
 the jellyfish.Lots of the children    
 come up and play in the village in the
 summer evenings.Lots of the boys play 
 sport.Two boys go fresh water fishing.
 We all read books and comics like     
 Beano and Wizzer.Some of the other    
 pastimes are stamp collecting,making  
 models,going shopping,playing on the  
 computer,helping at home, drawing,    
 riding bikes or horses, playing the   
 guitar.
