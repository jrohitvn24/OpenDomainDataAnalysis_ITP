		<content>{High Green School closing down .....  
                                       
 Our teacher said this is the most     
{important letter}you will ever get    
 from this school. When I got home we  
 learnt{the school might be closed.}The
 council said that seeing as the school
 is in a bad state they will shut it   
 down. We started a{'Save our School'  
 campaign. Some children wrote letters,
 Emma wrote to the{Queen.}Her picture  
 was in all the papers. I wrote to     
{Martin Flannery M.P.,}the{Chief       
{Education Officer}and{Prince Philip.  
 Amanda wrote to{Jimmy Saville.}We did 
 lots of things to help. We had discos 
 and designed badges. My mum and me and
 our Peter paid a lot of money. I made 
 a petition. The badges said{"Bite back
{against Closure".}When we got our     
 teeth badges we wore them a lot.
