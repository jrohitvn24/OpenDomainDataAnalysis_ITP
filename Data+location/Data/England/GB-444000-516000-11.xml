		<title>11HOUSING FOR OLD PEOPLE</title>
		<content> Many old people in Thornaby live in   
 bungalows,flats, or old peoples homes.
 The bungalows have only one storey so 
 that the inhabitants don't have to    
 climb stairs. They usually have only  
 one bedroom because the children of   
 the family have married and set up    
 their own homes. Sometimes the gardens
 round the bungalows are kept tidy by  
 council workers.                      
 The flats are in large buildings with 
 many storeys. There are lifts to every
 floor, but if the lifts are broken    
 some old people can't go out because  
 there are too many stairs to climb.   
 Some old people feel cosy in the flats
 but others say that they don't have   
 many people to talk to during the     
 day.If some old people can't look     
 after their own home they will live   
 where they can have their own room,but
 have their meals together.            </content>
