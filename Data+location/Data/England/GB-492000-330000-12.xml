		<content>{ The old mill at Great Ponton}        
  When ,walking down Mill Lane ,we came
 across the old mill (now a private    
 house).MOst of the old features were  
 still in evidence.                    
   Steven Atkin 1m:"On the outside     
 there was a large water wheel,some 12 
 metres in diameter.Inside there were  
 three floors.On the second floor there
 was the actual millstone used and all 
 the cogs and wheels,which still turned
 after 130 years.There were trapdoors  
 on the second and third floors where  
 the sacks of corn were dropped by     
 using chain pulleys.Some of the steps 
 on the ladders were very old and      
 thin.On the top floor there were four 
 holes for storing the different types 
 of corn.Points of interest:           
  1)The mill was last used in 1950     
  2)The mill was owned by A.S.Crabtree 
  3)It employed 4 men in the 19thcent. </content>
