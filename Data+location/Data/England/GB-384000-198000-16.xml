		<title>16HISTORIC HOUSE NAILSWORTH</title>
		<content> Built in the 16th century - formally  
 two houses, converted to one in 1880's
 It is built with Cotswold stone and   
 was the home of{W. H. Davies}who was  
 born in Newport (1871) and died here  
 in 1940. On the wall of the house     
 there is a quote from his famous      
 poem{'Leisure'}                       
 The house now belongs to his grandson.
 At the end of the cottage there used  
 to be a shop (early 20th century).    
 In the same area of{Watledge}most of  
 the old cottages were weavers'        
 cottages.                             
{Whipps Lane}is so named because       
 donkeys carrying their loads of       
 fleeces were whipped up the hill.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
