		<title>06Shopping In Fulwood.</title>
		<content> Before the new shopping centre was    
 built people in Fulwood used to shop  
 at Booth's and other shops on Garstang
 Road because these were the only shops
 in the area of Fulwood.  As more      
 houses were built around St. Peter's  
 school it was decided to build a new  
 shopping centre so that it was nearer 
 and people did not have to go as      
 far to shop. In 1978 the first shop to
 be built and opened was Booth's which 
 is a big supermarket whose roof is    
 shaped like a Swiss chalet. Other     
 shops were built around it including  
 N.S.S. a newsagent, a children's shop,
 a clothes shop, a curtain shop and an 
 optician. Two car-parks were built and
 a "bottle-bank" is there together with
 a pillar-box and a telephone box. Many
 people from the immediate area and    
 outside use the facilities of the     
 centre with its seats and coffee shop.</content>
