		<title>07Employment in New Mills</title>
		<content> Factory employment is one of the      
 biggest groups of employment in New   
 Mills. The factories in New Mills are 
 Garrison Works which is made up of 5  
 factories. Another factory is Swizzels
 which makes sweets. The Canal Foundry 
 is another factory.                   
 Farming in Newtown is mostly enclosed 
 rough grazing. There are about 37     
 farms in New Mills. If you walk along 
 the Sett Valley Trail you will see    
 some of the grazing fields.           
 There is quite a large shopping centre
 in New Mills. There are two main      
 supermarkets and two markets.         
 At the top of New Mills an estate has 
 been built. That is where most of the 
 commuters live. The more commuters    
 that come to New Mills, the more      
 estates that need to be built.
