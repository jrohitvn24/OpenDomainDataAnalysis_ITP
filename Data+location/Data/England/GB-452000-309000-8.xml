		<title>08THE ROMAN ROAD NEAR ANSTEY</title>
		<content> We went to see a road that has        
 recently been discovered, it is       
 thought to be Roman. The road is 34   
 feet 6 inches wide and one foot deep. 
 It is believed to be part of the roman
 road that goes from Colchester to     
 Chester, as the Via Devanna. The road 
 was discovered by two members of the  
 Anstey and District Archaeological    
 Society.                              
 The road is made of many stones. The  
 stones are being counted and measured 
 and drawn on to graph paper. At the   
 sides of the road are large stones    
 which act as kerb stones.             
 On the north section of the excavation
 flint was found dating back to 300BC. 
 A roman coin has also been found in   
 the area.                             
 By Louise Bennett,Sally Collins and   
    Charlotte Richards. Aged 9 -10.
