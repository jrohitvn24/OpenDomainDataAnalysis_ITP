		<title>05FAMOUS CONVALESCENT HOME</title>
		<content>{The Miners'Convalescent Home,Bispham} 
 This majestic building,dominating the 
 coastline, was founded by miners'     
 contributions for the use of miners in
 Western England and was opened by the 
 Prince of Wales in 1927. It merged in 
 1977 to become the Lancashire and     
 North Staffordshire home.             
 The home, on a seven-acre site,has 110
 spacious rooms,all with washing       
 facilities, and caters for 155        
 residents. Although most are retired, 
 priority is given to working          
 miners;paraplegic residents are       
 catered for in three specially built  
 bungalows.                            
 Contributions from working miners     
 finance the home, and each pit has a  
 "bed allocation".                     
 The dedication of the nineteen live-in
 staff ensures a welcoming atmosphere.
