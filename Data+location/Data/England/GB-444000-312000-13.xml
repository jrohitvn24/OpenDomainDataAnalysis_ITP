		<content>   When we carried out our survey for  
 the{Domesday Project}we started out   
 from school (456148)at 1.10pm on      
 Wednesday afternoon 5th.June in the   
 year A.D.1985.We went south-east along
 the Warren Hills Road (B587) past the 
{Bull's Head Pub}to{Upper Greenhill    
{Farm.}By that time we were looking at 
 our maps and writing the codes for    
 what the fields contained.At (472138) 
 we turned south-west along the        
 footpath to{Kellam's Farm.}From here  
 we  carried on through fields until we
 reached some woodland at (465127)     
 where we turned south-east again and  
 through a meadow with several ponies  
 in -which we stopped and stroked- past
{Old Rise Rocks}and{Rise Rocks Farm}   
 until we met the B591 near{Poplar     
{Farm.}Turning north-east we went about
 500 metres then took a right turn down
 a side road to the Motorway.          </content>
