		<content>    The unclassified road between      
 Shaftesbury and Blandford (C13)runs   
 North to South along the top of the   
 escarpment near the western boundary  
 of the area. It is thought to follow  
 the original route and for much of its
 length it is straight and level, but  
 not very wide. To the north however   
 there is s steep descent down Spread- 
 Eagle Hill into Melbury Abbas.        
    The road is unsuitable for heavy   
 vehicles but carries a good deal of   
 lighter traffic, particularly in the  
 holiday season, much of which travels 
 at speeds excessive for the nature of 
 the road.                             
    The Dorset Structure Plan includes 
 proposals for upgrading this road to  
 form the main route from Shaftesbury  
 to Blandford, but no firm plans have  
 yet been published, and this delay is 
 causing considerable local anxiety.   </content>
