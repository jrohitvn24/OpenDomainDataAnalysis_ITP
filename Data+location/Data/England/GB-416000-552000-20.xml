		<content> The fashion in this area is quite upto
 date when viewed alongside the latest 
 fashion in Britain.For instance a lot 
 of girls are wearing skirts of a      
 length which goes just below the knee.
 Baggy clothes are also fashionable for
 men and women.Jeans or coloured canvas
 trousers similar to jeans are worn.   
 Baggy dresses and T.shirts or jumpers 
 are fashionable for girls.As regards  
 hair fashion the following seems to be
 vogue in our area.Boys seem to be     
 getting perms rather than skinhead    
 cuts which are not as popular as they 
 used to be.Now boys prefer medium     
 length hair at the back and spiked on 
 the top,or medium length and curly at 
 the back and straight on top.Girls    
 however go for a loose perm which is  
 called a Demiwave,or alternatively a  
 wet look perm which has wet gel       
 applied to it to make it look wet.    </content>
