Pre 1875 the children were educated in 
the School Room behind the Old School  
House which is situated on North Street
to the south of the Church. It is      
thought that it was originally a Dame  
School. In 1875 a new school was built 
opposite on the corner of North Street 
and Church Street.                     
  The Old Schoolhouae is of traditional
construction under a peg tiled roof.   
It has a n Inglenook fireplace and     
an unusual arched fireplace. There are 
also exposed heavy timbers and leaded  
light windows.
