		<content> Entertainments and games were provided
 for the residents. Outside there was a
 bowling green, a croquet lawn and a   
 putting green. The village hall has a 
 stage for concerts, a valuable grand  
 piano and can be used to show films,  
 and for whist drives or old-time      
 dancing. There are clubs for scrabble,
 amateur dramatics, dancing, bowls and 
 many more. They have an annual show of
 the things they have made or grown.   
 The club-house includes a bar and     
 snooker and pool tables. It also holds
 a small exhibition about the history  
 of {Whiteley Village.}                
 More fun can be had on coach trips to 
 the sea or the country.
