		<title>02THE WATLING STREET</title>
		<content>   {The Watling Street or A5}passes    
 through this block close to{Nuneaton  
{in Warwickshire}- it was a{Roman road 
 from London to Holyhead. Being now a  
 main artery in the present day trunk  
 road system the asphalt surface is    
 kept in good condition by the County  
 Council, and the grass verges,fences  
 and hedges are well tended.           
    The road is for two way traffic    
 until the Western boundary where it   
 changes to a dual carriageway.        
    Several{fatalities}have occurred at
 the road junction to Higham-on-       
 the-Hill and Nuneaton.Higham Parish   
 Council organised a{petition}in 1984  
 asking for improvements at the        
 crossroads.The results of a public    
 meeting were the installation of      
 street lighting at this point and the 
 anticipated building of a traffic     
 roundabout at a later date.           </content>
