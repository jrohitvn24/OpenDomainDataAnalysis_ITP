		<title>12Clubs - Yardley</title>
		<content>Over half of the people we questioned  
did not go to a club and did not know  
anything about clubs.Some of them      
pointed out the disadvantages of having
clubs nearby i.e. being unable to park 
your car by your house and the noise   
and frights when the clubs closed.There
seem to be 3 main types of clubs in the
area;Social clubs which open every     
night,have bingo,dancing and darts.    
Clubs which do similar things on a     
quieter basis weekly or fortnightly.   
Youth groups which offer table tennis, 
outings and snooker and open, twice a  
week, for children up to 14. People    
approve of clubs since they help people
to mix and belive there should be more 
clubs for teenagers to keep them out of
trouble.
