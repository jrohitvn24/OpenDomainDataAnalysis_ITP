		<title>17HOW I SPEND MY TIME</title>
		<content>                                       
     In my spare time I watch T.V. and 
 if there is nothing I like,  I draw   
 pictures of scenes from 'Starwars' and
 from 'V', sometimes the pictures are  
 boring, but some are good. Other times
 I go to my friend's house or on       
 Thursdays I go 'Boys Brigade'. It's   
 good there because all you do is play 
 games. On Tuesday and Sunday I go     
 swimming.                             
     At school my best subject is      
 craft,swimming and using the computer.
 I also like the teachers, Mrs. Ali is 
 the best.                             
     At home I help my Mum by doing the
 Hovering,washing the plates and drying
 them,I also help doing the beds.      
 Sometimes I don't feel like doing jobs
 especially when I'm watching T.V.
