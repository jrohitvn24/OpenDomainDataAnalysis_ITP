		<content>The soil is quite chalky and flinty    
because we are so near to the          
Chilterns. There are 8 farms in our    
area;Lord and Lady Macclesfield's      
estate  and Model Farm which belongs   
to their son (at Shirburn), Home Farm  
(Pyrton), Knightsbridge Farm and       
Stokefield Farm to the West of Lewknor 
and Field Farm, Church Farm and Town   
Farm in Lewknor. They are all quite    
small, mainly arable farms with some   
pasture supporting dairy herds         
(Friesian). The most  common crops     
grown are; wheat, barley and oats.     
There is an agricultural machinery     
supplier, Farrels, in Lewknor. The     
machines used are;combine harvesters,  
trctors, bailers, silage trailers,     
harrows, ploughs and forage choppers.
