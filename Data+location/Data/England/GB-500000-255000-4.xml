		<title>04A Family in Milton Ernest</title>
		<content> A Saturday in this household in{Milton
{Ernest,}means a leisurely breakfast of
 cereal, toast, orange juice and coffee
 at about 0800h. We are all at home    
 today. The morning is spent in Bedford
 shopping, going to the library and    
 having coffee in a cafe. We sometimes 
 look at a{Do_It_Yourself shop}or      
{Garden Centre}on the way home. After a
 sandwich lunch the afternoon is spent 
 either in the garden or on a drive to 
 a nearby village to ring church bells.
 The evening is spent watching         
{television,}playing{computer games}or 
 reading. Occasionally Claire plays the
{flute}while dad accompanies on the    
{piano.}Our evening meal may be pizza  
 and salad which everyone likes and can
 help prepare. Bedtime is 2100h for the
 children and later for we parents,    
 after a glass of wine.
