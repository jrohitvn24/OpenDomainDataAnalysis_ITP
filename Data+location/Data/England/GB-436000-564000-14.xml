		<content> TheWhite Horse-South Shields.         
 The{White Horse} is a famous local    
 landmark, visible for some distance.It
 is quite simply a large white horse   
 painted on an exposed rock face       
 overlooking Redwell Comprehensive     
 School.                               
 There are many stories to explain the 
 origin of the {White Horse} ,but the  
 one accorded with most credibility    
 concerns the Whitburn nobleman{Sir    
{Hedworth Williamson}.                 
 Every day Sir Hedworth and his wife   
 would go riding on {Marsden Beach} for
 a picnic,but one day Sir Hedworth had 
 to leave on business and{Lady         
{Williamson}had to go out on her {White
{Horse}alone.She vanished that         
 day.Search parties found no trace of  
{Lady Williamson}.The {White Horse}was 
 scratched out as a tribute to {Sir    
{Hedworth}by his gamekeeper.           </content>
