		<title>19VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content> As we surveyed our area we tried to   
find out what each person thought of   
the area. There were two different     
groups, one group who were born in the 
area and the other group were those who
had moved into the area.               
 The group who had moved into the area 
said that they liked the countryside.  
They did not know much about the buses 
but did most of their shopping by car  
in Hadleigh and Ipswich.               
 The other group who had been born in  
the area said that the village had     
changed since they were children. There
were now fewer buses and shops in the  
villages. The school in Kersey used to 
have many more children coming to it.  
There used to be a lot more jobs in    
Kersey.e.g. undertaker, grocers,       
sawyer (man who cut trees into wood).  
The roads used to be rougher and often 
they had ditches in them.              </content>
