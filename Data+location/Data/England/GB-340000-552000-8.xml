 Most people in{Carlisle}shop in The   
{Lanes,}a new shopping development. It 
 is a large complex based on old lanes 
 which were demolished. The character  
 of the old lanes has been retained to 
 form a pleasant area for people to    
 shop in. The shops are both big and   
 small, ranging from large chain stores
 like C&amp;A and Fine Fare to small units 
 such as The Bird of Paradise, a flower
 shop.                                 
     The importance of fashion today   
 can be judged by the shops which      
 devote a large proportion of their    
 floor area to clothes. Skirts, jumpers
 or trousers can be made more          
 fashionable by the addition of beads, 
 bangles, earrings and bands.
