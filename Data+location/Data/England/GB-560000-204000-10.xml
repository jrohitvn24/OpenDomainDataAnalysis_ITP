		<content> This building is surrounded by peace- 
 ful countryside.It has been a pub for 
 at least 200 years.It is the "local"  
 and social centre of{COOKSMILL GREEN} 
 and{RADLEY GREEN.}Regulars call it the
 CUCKOO probably because it used to own
 a cuckoo clock. Most customers live in
 the neighbourhood,between 50 and 60   
 are regulars.On Friday evenings the   
 pub is crowded,up to 100 squeeze in.  
 Sunday lunchtime is also very busy and
 often ends up with sing-songs accom-  
 panied by a piano accordion. Lunch-   
 times and evenings in the early part  
 of the week are quiet.There is 1 large
 bar,converted from 3 small rooms.Open 
 fires and wood panelling give a very  
 cosy feeling.The pub has a Darts,Dom- 
 ino and Football team. They practise  
 in the pub and garden.Sometimes they  
 play other pub teams.Meals are served,
 but the main attraction is{REAL ALE.  </content>
