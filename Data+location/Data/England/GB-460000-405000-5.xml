		<title>05Shaw Wood near Armthorpe.</title>
		<content> The biggest wood in our Domesday Block
 is{Shaw Wood.}The main trees in the   
 wood are Oak, Beech, and Sweet        
 Chestnut, and there are a few ever-   
 greens. There are bad things that     
 happen in the wood like dumping litter
 and scrambling on motor-bikes. Some   
 children earlier in the year started a
 fire. There are some good things      
 people do when they go in the wood,   
 like schoolchildren sketching trees.  
 There is a variety of wildlife in the 
 wood - I have seen rabbits, squirrels,
 woodpeckers, and a fox. The{miners'   
{strike}caused some destruction -      
 approximately 30% of the wood was     
 lost. This was because the striking   
 miners chopped down the trees for     
 fuel. The wood will take many years to
 recover from this damage.{THE RESULTS 
{OF A SURVEY OF PART OF THE WOOD ARE   
{GIVEN ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE (PAGE 6).}</content>
