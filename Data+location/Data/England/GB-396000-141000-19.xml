		<title>19SUPERNATURAL IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> With the numerable ancient            
 archaelogical sites the Plain area is 
 rich in stories of ghostly            
 visitations, but the immediate        
 surroundings of Chitterne can only    
 boast a few. Local reports speak of a 
 Miss Adlem, whose aged, bonneted      
 figure is supposed to frequent one of 
 the upstairs rooms in St. Mary's      
 Lodge. Another story is told at the   
 King's Head Public House of a former  
 landlord whose wife became involved   
 with a lodger. No-one knows quite how 
 he met his end, but his ghost is      
 reported to haunt what is now the pool
 room.                                 
 The area around Chitterne is said to  
 be a centre of witchcraft through the 
 ages and is mentioned in Dennis       
 Wheatley's novels as a place where the
 Black Arts were practised.
