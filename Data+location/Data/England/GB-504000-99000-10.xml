 The Coastguard Cottages near the sea  
 remind us of the days when smuggling  
 was common.From the sea the mill on   
 Highdown and the spire of {East       
{Preston Church, }provided landmarks   
 to guide in the boats which carried   
 wine,brandy or wool.                  
  The {Coast Blockade}was set up in    
{1815}when a  row of cottages were     
 built.These cottages each share a     
 single entrance door and hall.This may
 have been for economy or mutual       
 defence,for the gangs were notoriously
 brutal.(19th records tell us that     
 carriers earned 5/- a night, while the
 batmen (there protectors)earned 20/-. 
 Farm labourers often earned money by  
 joining the smugglers.Ingenious hiding
 places for the smuggled goods include 
 the{Millers Tomb}on {HIGHDOWN}.
