On Saturday the 18th June I got up and played on my DS for 10 mins then my mum woke up and got dress.  My mum went to wake up my brother because they were going out, Scott my brother had to have his hair cut. Me and my sister had to stay with our dad, so I race down the stairs and went in the kitchen.&lt;br />&lt;br />I went to see if my dog was awake and he was so I went to make me some breakfast. My mum went out. Then I went up stair to get dress.&lt;br />&lt;br />I got up the stair and got dress I put a yellow top and a white trousers then I went down.&lt;br />&lt;br />Next I went to play on my Xbox for 30 mins then some of my mum friend come down to see my dad for 5mints and then my mum came back home and we had to get ready for my nanâ€™s party.&lt;br />&lt;br />We left to go.
