		<content>  Tavistock Wastesavers mainly collect 
 furniture which they restore and sell 
 to the public.They also collect       
 newspaper and wastepaper which they   
 recycle and sell to a company in      
 Plymouth.After a jumble sale they will
 collect the remaining items, some of  
 which they will sell.                 
  The site at Wilminstone Industrial   
 Estate is ideal for Tavistock         
 Wastesavers' purposes because there is
 a lot of space for storage.If this    
 site was situated in the town it would
 make the town look dirty and untidy.  
  The original company was started by  
 the Manpower Services Department in an
 effort to provide employment in the   
 area but this company went bankrupt   
 just over a year ago.The owners of    
 Tavistock Wastesavers live in         
 Tavistock and Mary Tavy.They have     
 owned the company for one year.       </content>
