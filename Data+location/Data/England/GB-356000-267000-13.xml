		<content>    My Dad is a Game Keeper,he works in
 Bickley.In the month of June he has   
 100's of birds to rear.He has had some
 eggs,hatched them out and  has had    
 them since they were one day old      
    They have chick feed and           
 water.They are let into big runs so   
 they have extra room.He rears         
 pheasants and occasionally partridges 
 in pens.They are small and fluffy.    
    When they are old enough to go out 
 in the open,my Dad arranges dates in  
 the Autumn to go shooting.The men come
 from Kidderminster and around our     
 area.

 once. Wells makes Blackcurrent, Soda
