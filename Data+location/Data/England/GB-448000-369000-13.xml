		<title>13SCARCLIFFE PARK.</title>
		<content>      The wood in Scarcliffe Park      
 covers 900 acres. There are two small 
 ponds, each covering about one acre,  
 and a small stream, the River Poulter,
 runs through. The wood is owned by the
{Chatsworth Estates.}There are many    
 public paths but some of the wood is  
 private. The wood is used for growing 
{timber}which is constantly cut down   
 and replanted. The wood is also a game
 preserve for{pheasant, partridge,duck 
 and{rabbits.                          
      Three{foresters,}two{gamekeepers 
 and three or four{casual keepers}work 
 in the wood. The only people who live 
 in the wood are the gamekeeper and his
 family.                               
      To move the timber around        
 tractors and trailers are used and a  
 van is used by the gamekeeper.        
      The wood is not greatly used by  
 the public but some visit in summer.  </content>
