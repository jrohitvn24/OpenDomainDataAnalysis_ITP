		<content> In 1985 the most popular hobbies in   
 our area were gardening,reading,      
 knitting and sewing.Less popular ones 
 included stamp  collecting,and round  
 the house hobbies such as decorating  
 and silver work.People spent up to six
 hours weekly on their hobby.They chose
 these hobbies because they found them 
 interesting or enjoyable.A few people 
 chose them because they were usefull  
 to them such as for making            
 clothes.Most people have had their    
 hobbies for many years (between 30 &amp;  
 40).Only five people have had their   
 hobby for less then ten years.Most    
 people get the things for their       
 hobbies from shops, but a few get     
 stamps and books from the library and 
 stamp fairs. Most people had not      
 changed hobbies but some of the people
 had because they had grown out of     
 them.                                 </content>
