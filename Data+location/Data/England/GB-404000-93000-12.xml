		<content>    Harris's Newsagents is at 40 Kinson
 Road, Wallisdown and is open 7 days a 
 week from 6.00am to 6.00pm. Its best  
 selling product is newspapers and     
 there are no problems with deliveries.
    They have no restrictions when     
 storing goods and this does not limit 
 the type and quantity of goods        
 ordered.                              
    Mr. Harris employs 8 staff, mostly 
 paperboys, who go around putting      
 ordered papers through the customers  
 letter boxes.                         
    Larger shops, such as supermarkets,
 effect his business by selling things 
 more cheaply than he can as they can  
 work on lower profit margins.         
    He prefers to run his own shop     
 because he would rather work for      
 himself than anyone else. He feels the
 future of his small shop is secure if 
 it is run properly.                   </content>
