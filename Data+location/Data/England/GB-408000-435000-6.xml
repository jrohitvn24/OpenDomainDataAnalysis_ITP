		<content>{ELASTICS}is played by girls. You need 
 3 metres of elastic tied in a loop.   
 Two girls standing inside the loop    
 stretch it. The rest take turns to    
 jump in, out, and around the loop.They
 have a sequence of jumps. When a      
 mistake is made the next girl takes   
 her turn.                          {  
{KINGY}is mostly played by boys. To    
 start everyone crouches in a circle,  
 with legs apart. Someone then drops a 
 ball in the circle. Everyone then     
 tries to hit it through someone's     
 legs, if it goes in, they're on. The  
 person who is on throws the ball at   
 everybody. He is allowed to run but   
 when he hits someone they help the    
 person to catch the rest, but from    
 then on they cannot run with the ball.
