 There are two iron age camps in the   
 area, Stockland Great and Little      
 camps.Several paleolithic hand axes   
 and a large number of Mesolithic      
 and Neolithic flints have been        
 found in the area and are being       
 removed to Exeter Museum.There are    
 two mills,probably the ones           
 mentioned in Domesday 1086,and a      
 Georgian house which was a lunatic    
 asylum in the C19th.A number of houses
 are listed buildings.On either side of
 the Umborne brook is a stone hidden in
 the hedge which marked the area of    
 road surface to be repaired by the    
 county as distinct from the           
 parish.Dick Turpin is reputed to have 
 stayed a night at the"Three Mariners" 
 inn,which is now a private house.
