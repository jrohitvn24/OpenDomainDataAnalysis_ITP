		<title>12THE VILLAGE POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The post Office doubles as a shop and 
 is more than 100 years old while the  
 house itself is more than 150 years   
 old.It was once a full sorting office 
 and the store room was a telephone    
 exchange.The present owners have      
 extended the premises and have        
 introduced new lines such as cards and
 cooked meats.They buy in stock fairly 
 regularly as their storage space is   
 quite limited.This is purchased       
 locally in either Worcester or        
 Malvern.The least busy day is         
 Wednesday and they are closed on      
 Sunday.The shop has a heavy commitment
 to the supply of newspapers.They      
 supply 925 daily newspapers and 530   
 Worcester Evening News.They also take 
 300 magazines for various customers.It
 is very much a family concern and all 
 members take a hand in helping out in 
 the shop or the post office.          </content>
