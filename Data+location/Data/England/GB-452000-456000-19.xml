		<content> We sent out questionnaires to people  
 in the village and we found out that  
 the community centre wasn't being used
 as much as it could be.The community  
 centre is where they do activities    
 such as:Youth club,bowls,play group   
 etc.We found the most popular adult   
 activities are gardening &amp;knitting.We 
 found the most popular activities for 
 children are:watching T.V.and playing 
 games outside.When we asked what      
 activites they would like organized   
 most people said a hard tennis court, 
 swimming pool,monthly discos,cricket  
 pitch and team,social club and night  
 classes.People think that there should
 be more activities for younger        
 children and especially teenage       
 children.There is no swimming pool in 
 Shipton,some people find it quite easy
 to get to a swimming pool,but others  
 find it difficult.                    </content>
