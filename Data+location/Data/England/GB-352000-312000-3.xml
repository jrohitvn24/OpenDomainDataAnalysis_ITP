		<content> fairly busy because the post office   
 has been shut on the Sunday.Tuesdays  
 and the afternoons are usually very   
 quiet.The original post office can    
 still be seen opposite Frank Cross    
 Drive.It is easy to identify because  
 it has got two Brooke Bond Tea        
 stickers in the window and a Colmans  
 Starch sign on the wall.              
 Mr.Oldham does the shopping for the   
 shop on the half day. He gets the     
 stock from a cash and carry, he picks 
 up the shopping himself as there are  
 no deliveries these days.             
 They sell many papers but the most    
 popular are The Sun, The Telegraph,   
 and The Mail together with these      
 popular comics and magazines; Look_in,
 Dandy,Beano, Woman, Womans Own and    
 Farming Books.The old post office in  
 Uffington has recently been rebuilt as
 a private house.                      </content>
