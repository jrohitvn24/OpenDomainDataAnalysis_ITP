		<title>14Schools' Chess in Skegness</title>
		<content>  One of the most important extra      
 activities in our school is the School
 Chess Club. There are more than 100   
 members who take part in many         
 competitions. The School Chess Teams  
 have been very successful in recent   
 years, and  1984's captain, Richard   
 Birks, played for England. This year  
 the Under 11 Team's members have all  
 played for Lincolnshire. Two of them  
 are County Champions. Tamsin Hoffman  
 is the County Girls' Under 11 Champion
 and Michelle Barker is the County     
 Under 10 Champion. She has written    
 about playing chess :                 
 When I am playing chess I am very     
 nervous. I have to put my hands under 
 the table because they are trembling. 
 When I can see checkmate my heart     
 starts going fast because I am        
 excited.When I win a trophy I am very 
 pleased but nervous when I collect it.</content>
