		<content>        The majority of people in our  
 area said that although they did not  
 do a great amount every day, they did 
 their best not to eat fatty foods and 
 try to walk whenever possible.        
        Many people said that they did 
 not go out too often to supper as they
 were very busy, and only a few said   
 that they went out regulary.          
        The majority of people living  
 in Babcary were retired and so they   
 had plenty of time to do gardening and
 their gardening was very impressive.  
        Most people other than farmers 
 said that although they were          
 Christians, few actually went to      
 church. The farmers said that life was
 so busy for them 7 days a week that   
 they could not find the time off to go
 to church.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
