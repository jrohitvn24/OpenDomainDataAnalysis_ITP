		<title>02MIDFORD AND TUCKING MILL</title>
		<content>   Midford is no longer a village in   
 the true sense.The station has closed 
 and the busy Frome road cuts straight 
 between the houses.There is still a   
 pub,but the shops,post officeand      
 chapel have gone.It has never had a   
 school or church,and nowadays most of 
 the inhabitants only meet at specially
 arranged gatherings.The banks of the  
 Midford Brook and neighbouring fields 
 are lovely for walking;and its valley 
 between Midford and Tucking Mill is   
 dominated by a spectacular eighteenth 
 century castle.                       
   At Tucking Mill there are seven     
 houses,a reservoir and water treatment
 plant.Disabled anglers are allowed to 
 fis there and the whole area is a     
 popular place for walking,with its    
 fields,streams and wildlife.Those who 
 live in Tucking Mill and Midford rely 
 heavily on cars to get about.         </content>
