		<title>20Things we like</title>
		<content> I like best my mum, dad, sister and   
 our dog Benjy. I like going through an
 old scrap-book and looking at pictures
 of Princess Diana and seeing what     
 clothes she wore and where. I like    
 listening to Top of the Pops and      
 hearing what is number one.           
        My favourite meal is chips in  
 newspaper, and I also like burnt      
 bacon for my tea.My favourite afters  
 on a Sunday is apple pie.             
            I like going on holiday and
 then I like coming home.I like to swim
 and sunbathe on the beach. When I get 
 home from a holiday, within a week, I 
 am usually reading a C.S. Lewis book  
            Other  things I like are   
 roller and ice skating, which I do    
 mostly in the summer.On a hot summers 
 day I like to go into the back garden 
 and have a cold drink, especially     
 lemonade.                             </content>
