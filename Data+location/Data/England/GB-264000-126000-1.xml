		<content> Filleigh village is found eight miles 
 to the south-south-east of Barnstaple 
 and four miles from South Molton.     
 The A361 road runs through the village
 from east to west but the planned link
 road will by-pass the main village.   
 The village possesses a church, a     
 primary school with aproximately      
 sixty-five children, a post office,   
 sawmills, and village hall. The       
 Fortescue family's house, Castle Hill,
 is close by and to the east of the    
 village.  The area is predominantly   
 farm land (mostly with sheep and cows)
 and there is the Fortescue Estate     
 Forestry covering 1,200 acres.        
 A number of the houses in the area    
 belong to the Fortescue Estate and are
 occupied by employees of the Estate.  
 A bus service connects Filleigh with  
 South Molton and Barnstaple.
