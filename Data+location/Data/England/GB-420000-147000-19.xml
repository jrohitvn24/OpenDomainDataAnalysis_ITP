		<title>19LOCAL HISTORY OF TIDWORTH I</title>
		<content>  The village of Tidworth has been in  
 existence for thousands of years. In  
 Roman times it was a centre of commun-
 ication between London,Marlborough and
 Bath. The Anglo-Saxon name TUDWORTH   
 meant TUDAS HOMESTEAD. By the middle  
 of the seventeenth century the estates
 of Tedworth and the Manor of Tedworth 
 House were well known to the Royal    
 Court,Houses of Parliament and City of
 London. It was a centre for sheep     
 breeding and the wool trade and known 
 to British and European merchants. In 
 l650 Thomas Smith became the new      
 squire. He and his descendants were   
 important people in the City of London
 and did much to maintain and develop  
 the village. Thomas Assheton Smith III
 modified Tedworth House and formed    
 Tedworth Hunt. The estates passed out 
 of the Assheton Smith family in l859.
