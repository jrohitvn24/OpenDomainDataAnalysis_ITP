		<content>   The Church of the Holy Cross stands 
 just behind the Market Place.  It is a
 very old church.  We found out it was 
 built over 700 years ago.  In the     
 church is a grave with a cross, a     
 sword and the Blenkinsopp family coat 
 of arms on it.  The vicar lives in a  
 large house near the church.  There   
 are 12 people in the choir and 4      
 servers to help each Sunday.  A flower
 festival is held every September.     
   At the east end of town there is the
 Roman Catholic Church of St. Wilfred. 
 There is no resident priest.  Services
 are taken by the priest from Haydon   
 Bridge and the presbytery is now a    
 private house.  The usual congregation
 of about 60 is increased so much by   
 summer visitors that the bishop gave  
 special permission for the first Mass 
 of Sunday to be held on Saturday      
 night.                                </content>
