		<title>01GITTISHAM AND COMBE</title>
		<content> The twelve square kilometers of the   
 Domesday block contain most of the    
 Parish of Gittisham and the ancient   
 manor of Combe.                       
 The area is bounded to the West South 
 and East by the high ground of        
 Gittisham common and East Hill, and to
 the South by the Otter Valley, which  
 also carries the main A30 trunk road  
 and the railway line between London   
 and Exeter.                           
 The village is small and has not      
 suffered major development; it retains
 much of the atmosphere of a           
 traditional Devon village, nestling   
 between the hills which cut it off    
 from Honiton and the busy main roads. 
 The estate of Combe is still in       
 private hands and owns most of the    
 land of the block. The manor house is 
 mainly mediaeval on an ancient site.  
 It is now let as a Hotel.             </content>
