		<content> the proposal by a mining concern to   
 open a drift mine at Osmondcroft Farm 
 to the west of the village which would
 employ 22 people and produce 14,400   
 tons of coal a year.  The local action
 committee has the support of the      
 County Planning Officer in the matter 
 who feels that the proposed plan could
 spoil the area's natural beauty.      
 The small cluster of houses across    
 the River Tees from Winston, known as 
 Winston Gate, stood on land owned by  
 the Earl of Harewood which was sold in
 the early 1920s for private dwellings.
 The "Board Inn" which once stood      
 there, has been converted into a      
 private dwelling.
