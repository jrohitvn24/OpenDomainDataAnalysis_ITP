		<title>10Marchwood village magazine</title>
		<content> The {Marchwood Village News} was      
 introduced to get the people who had  
 been in Marchwood a long time and the 
 newcomers, together.The cover was     
 designed by the Parish Clerk until    
 a year ago.Now it is drawn by local   
 people and at Christmas by children.  
 The magazine is paid for by the Parish
 Council and the advertisements help.  
   The first edition was published in  
 1982 and was just a sheet.The Parish  
 Clerk had to duplicate 4000 sheets.   
 The duplicating machine used to pack  
 up after about 20 minutes so it took  
 her 3 to 4 days.The Parish Council    
 thought it was too much work so they  
 agreed to have them printed.They are  
 distributed to the houses free of     
 charge and consist of                 
 advertisements,articles on local      
 groups,children's birthdays and       
 general local news.                   </content>
