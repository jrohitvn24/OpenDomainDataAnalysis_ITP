		<content> This is a farm building which has had 
 numerous extensions and has been      
 converted into a very popular wining  
 and dining rendevous. There are rooms 
 for functions as wel as the normal bar
 and dining facilities. Outside        
 catering is a newly added speciality  
 and the owners appear to be very      
 enterprising. Lawns have been         
 constructed for putting, croquet and  
 merely lying on to relax and take in  
 the view. The club is reached from the
 Colyton to Honiton road down a very   
 narrow unclassified road leading to   
 Northleigh. To find the club a series 
 of arrows have been added at the road 
 side giving directions to this club   
 built on a very isolated site.
