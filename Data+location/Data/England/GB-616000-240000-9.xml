		<title>09POWER STATION IPSWICH</title>
		<content>The Cliff Quay Power Station is the    
only station within the Ipswich        
boundary which has responsibility for  
generating electricity.However, from   
1985 this function will cease.Within   
three years it is planned to demolish  
the major buildings and to sell the    
land for other industrial use.         
  Actual production of electricity     
stopped in March 1985. The coal burning
station was thirty years old and by    
 odern standards, was not cost         
effective.It's six turbines could only 
produce as one turbine in a modern     
plant.                                 
  Naturally the quay used to import the
coal is now redundant, the large       
storage areas are already being used   
for other purposes (e.g. the storage of
imported Volvo cars).
