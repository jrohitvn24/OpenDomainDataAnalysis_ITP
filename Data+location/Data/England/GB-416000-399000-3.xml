		<content>{The Dog and Partridge.                
     Originally built as a farm house  
 in 1642 and converted in the          
 nineteenth century, this clean        
 oak-beamed pub has a very "Olde       
 Worlde" feeling.  Large stables and a 
 coach yard provide evidence of the    
 building's coach-house past.   There's
 nothing ultra-modern or artificially  
 antique about this quiet country pub's
 comfortably old-fashioned atmosphere. 
  This is an ideal place to stop for   
 lunch after a walk or drive.   Bar    
 meals are served in front of a large  
 open fire between twelve and one      
 thirty.   Typical meals are meat pie  
 potatoes and vegetables, steak        
 sandwiches, salads and scampi.        
 A wide range of spirits and beers are 
 available, a pint of beer costs around
 a pound, a single measure of spirits  
 costs around eighty pence.            </content>
