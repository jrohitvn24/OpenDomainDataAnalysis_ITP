		<content> In 1967 a group of enthusiastic volun 
 teers acquired 3 acres purchasing a   
 further 4 acres from Coventry         
 Council.The ever expanding collection 
 now open to the public displays       
 military and civilian aircraft dated  
 between 1936 and 1958 and includes the
 only surviving Flettner F1 282 Kolibri
 helicopter and the only Boulton Paul  
 P111A ever built.Later additions were 
 purchased or donated by the Ministry  
 of Defence and organisations like the 
 American Airforce.Although essentially
 concerned with aircraft examples of   
 associated equipment include a        
 lighting tower, a 25 pounder field gun
 once used by the Desert Rats in World 
 War 2 and a Bofors Anti-Aircraft gun.
