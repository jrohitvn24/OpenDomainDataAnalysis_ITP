Historic Buildings Comission.          
When the school closed at Raydon the   
community raised money to buy half the 
building for use as a community centre.
The other half was sold to be converted
into a private dwelling.The playing    
field land,lent to the school by local 
farmer Mr.Dunningham has been sold and 
a private dwelling is now in the       
process of being built upon it.
