		<title>10The Milk Marketing Board</title>
		<content>{  }My Dad works at the milk marketing 
 board. He phones the milk board for   
 some calls to farms to do with the    
 cows. Then after he has finished the  
 calls he phones up for some more so he
 can do those. Then he comes home for  
 lunch. In the afternoon he goes back  
 to the milk board to put the flask    
 back. Then in the morninghe will go   
 back to the milk boardto ask if there 
 are any more calls.

 Mr and Mrs Spencer do the milk        
 delivery inWrentham. They live at 9   
 Bonsey Gardens. The milk is fresh from
 the Milk Marketing Board. They start  
 at about half past six. Sometimes Mrs 
 Spencer helps.     Heidi Hodgkins
