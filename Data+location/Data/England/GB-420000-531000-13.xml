		<content> Like Carol, p12, Lisa also lives in   
 Binchester, at 63, Granville Terrace -
 with her parents &amp; a younger brother. 
 "From my window I can see at least 5  
 horses in the next field. Mr Weston a 
 teacher at our school has moved into  
 no.1, where Melanie Hill lived". In   
 small communities people know everyone
 &amp; everything going on.                
 "In my spare time, when I'm not doing 
 homework, I like to play rounders or  
 play cricket".                        
 Lisa's father works at Talent Eng., N/
 Aycliffe, "I sometimes wait for him at
 the bus stop...mother likes to go to  
 Spennymoor on a Friday night but she's
 always home by 11.30,a bit like Cinder
 ella". They all worry about Paul as he
 has to play in a lane where older lads
 "bomb" around on motor-bikes.         
 Lisa, a member of the youth committee,
 is also active in the local jazz-band.</content>
