		<title>04A House Boat</title>
		<content> I live on an M.T.B. which stands for  
 motor torpedo boat which was used in  
 the war and was once blown up but     
 repaired.   We have nine rooms and    
 what is the lounge now, used to be an 
 engine room.   At one end of the boat 
 it was air tight so if it sank all the
 men would go up that end and they     
 would be safe.  I live on the boat    
 with my mum, dad, brother, cat and    
 goldfish.   The boat is 72 feet long  
 and about 16 feet wide.   Out-side we 
 have a rowing boat, raft, and a diving
 board, the boat is moored on the      
 saltings. At high tide the gang- plank
 is very steep and it is hard to get up
 and  down, if the tide is high and it 
 sometimes comes over the path from the
 carpark to the boat.
