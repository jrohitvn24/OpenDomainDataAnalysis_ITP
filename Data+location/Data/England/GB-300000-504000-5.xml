		<content>  I live on a farm with my younger     
brother, mother and father.I get up    
about 6 a.m. and dress myself in socks,
pants, T-shirt and trousers.I go down  
stairs for my breakfast. After washing 
myself in the bathroom I go and feed   
our Springer Spaniel pup and his mother
then I go and put the ponies into the  
paddock behind our house. After that I 
feed the hens and let them out of the  
hen house for a run. Next I muck out   
the stables and fill the hay nets for  
the ponies at night. After lunch I go  
up stairs and practice my music -treble
and descant recorders.Then I get my    
saddle and bridle and put them on my   
pony. I go for a ride round Ponsonby   
Tarn.When I return I take all his tack 
off and put him back in the paddock.   
Then I have my tea.
