		<content> Industry in this area is limited to a 
 small number of light industries. Most
 of these industries are concentrated  
 to the south of the town on its east  
 side of the river. Existing industy in
 this area includes: The largest       
 factory is one which produces finished
 aluminium goods, a second produces    
 huge concrete pipes, others include a 
 double glazing manufacturer, a farm   
 supply company and factory producing  
 television and audio equipment. There 
 have been attempts made to encourage  
 other industry to the area, especially
 as several have died out or have moved
 away, but most attempts fail owing to 
 the more suitable arrangements to be  
 had at the nearby new town of Telford.
