		<title>16  Factory at Weaverthorpe</title>
		<content>    Now known as{Boythorpe}Ltd.,this   
 factory was built at Weaverthorpe in  
 the sixties by a local businessman and
 farmer. It was hoped that it would    
 give{employment}to local men. Some-   
 times there are several local men     
 working there but now, of the 30 shop-
 floor workers and 12 office staff,    
 only 2 men and 1 cleaner live in this 
 village.                              
    The{Boythorpe cropstores,}and to a 
 lesser extent the{slurry containers,  
 are to be seen all over England and   
 many have been exported to Germany,   
 Iceland, Sweden, France, Ireland and  
 the U.S.A.                            
    In 1980 the firm then known as     
 "Gasgoigne". was given the{Queen's    
{Award for Industry}and an excellent   
 buffet meal was provided in a marquee 
 for all the staff, after the  Marquess
 of Normanby made the presentation.    </content>
