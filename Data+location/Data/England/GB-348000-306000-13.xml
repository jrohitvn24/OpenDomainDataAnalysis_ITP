		<title>13The Burgs,Bayston Hill.</title>
		<content>   The Burgs is an Iron Age hill fort, 
 lying on a ridge jutting North-East   
 from the large village of Bayston     
 Hill.                                 
   The Northern ramparts of the Burgs  
 are fairly flat because they are in a 
 field and may have been ploughed up.  
 You can just see the ditch.On their   
 southern side they are very steep and 
 there are two ditches.                
   The oak trees crowd the fort growing
 up the southern slopes.The wildlife of
 the Burgs is mostly grass land,hedges 
 and trees.The centre is a maze of     
 tangled weeds like goose grass,nettles
 and brambles.The broom bushes grow in 
 large clumps.The ash tree is very     
 common inside the actual fort and the 
 hawthorns were in full bloom when we  
 were there.I think the Burgs is a     
 beautiful and interesting place.It's  
 like an unexplored island of mystery. </content>
