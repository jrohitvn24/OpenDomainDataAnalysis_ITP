		<content>   At present there is a junior school 
 on a split level site for 4 - 9 year  
 olds with eight teachers. A middle    
 school in a modified purpose built    
 unit with five teachers, is being     
 wound down prior to closure in 1986   
 and therefor only has three years of  
 children. Both are controlled schools 
 and cannot be altered without the     
 consent of Lichfield diocese. Each    
 school has its own board of Govenors. 
 Overseas visits are run yearly to     
 France and occasionally to Austria.   
   On closure of the middle school the 
 juniors will move into their building 
 and plans are afoot to purchase the   
 junior school for use as a village    
 hall since the present Village        
 Institute has been outgrown.          
   St. Edwards Psychiatric Hospital has
 a School of Nursing.
