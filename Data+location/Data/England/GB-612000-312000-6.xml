		<content>     {Ringland's}nearest bus service is
 2 miles away in{Taverham}and some     
 cycle to catch it. Others use a weekly
 bus from Dereham to Norwich.{Ringland 
 children &lt;12 are bussed to school in  
{Taverham}but have to cycle or walk    
 along narrow, winding, unpaved roads  
 when they go to the High School.      
      There are no street lights in    
{Taverham.}Some children use the busy

 how many vehicles went in and out of  
{Taverham.}Most vehicles using The     
 Street were cars and on the Fakenham  
 Road, there were 338 vehicles going to
 Norwich and 311 to Fakenham from 10.00
 to 11.00 on 17/6/85. Local pedestrians</content>
