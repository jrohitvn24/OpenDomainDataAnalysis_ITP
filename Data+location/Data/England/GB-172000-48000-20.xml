		<content> Mithian County Primary School is      
 situated on the main St. Agnes to     
 Perranporth road.  The building is    
 typical of many Victorian schools.    
 Today there are some fifty pupils, a  
 full-time teaching headmistress and   
 infant teacher, and two part-time     
 assistants.                           
 Among its famous "old boys" is Bob    
 Monkhouse, who was evacuated to       
 Mithian during the 1939-45 war and was
 for a short time a pupil at the       
 school.  In recent years the school   
 has acquired a playing field adjacent 
 to the school yard - but it no longer 
 has a school garden.                  
 St. Agnes County Primary School, in   
 British Road, is larger and is a      
 typical rural primary school.         
 For secondary education the majority  
 of children travel by "school bus" to 
 the Richard Lander School in Truro.   </content>
