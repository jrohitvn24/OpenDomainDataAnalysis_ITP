		<title>01THE LIFESTYLE OF WINTERTON</title>
		<content> Winterton is a friendly place to live 
 in because the people get on well with
 each other. It has nearly all the     
 shops you need. Winterton has few busy
 roads. Most people have cars and      
 parking is a problem on some narrow   
 roads. This is sometimes because      
 people don't have drives to put their 
 cars in. It is a small locality which 
 everyone knows their way round quite  
 well. It has quite a lot of amenities 
 such as the park, hairdressers, tennis
 courts, library, garages and the      
 health centre. The only main amenity  
 people seem to miss is a chemist shop.
 3 out of 4 people said on a survey    
 that this was the only thing. We have 
 3 schools in Winterton; the infants,  
 juniors and the comprehensive. We go  
 to school 5 days a week from 8.55-3.40
 My favourite lesson is English.
