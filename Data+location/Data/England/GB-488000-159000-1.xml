		<title>01INTRODUCTION.</title>
		<content> Originally the whole area was         
 heathland crossed by the Great West   
 Road (A30).Camberley did not exist but
 there were a few isolated buildings   
 such as the Golden(now Jolly)Farmer.  
 The first building was the Obelisk    
 built by John Norris about 1760 to    
 signal to his friend Francis Dashwood 
 of the Hell Fire Club.Camberley began 
 with the setting up of Sandhurst      
 Military College in 1812.Its function 
 was to provide shops,services &amp; labour
 for the college.As Sandhurst expanded 
 &amp; separated into 2 colleges,so Camber 
 ley grew,its military connection stre-
 ngthened by officers retiring to the  
 area.Our patch was opened up by large 
 houses with rhododendron drives.With  
 the introduction of the car it became 
 a fashionable area for London commut- 
 ers.Other military developments were  
 R.A.R.D.E.and the WRAC College.       </content>
