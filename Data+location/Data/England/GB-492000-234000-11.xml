 in l867. Aspley Heath is part of      
 Woburn Sands and is a civil parish

 on Greensand and Oxford Clay which    
 runs across the village.              
 The area is heavily wooded, mainly    
 with conifers, resulting from the

 extraction of Fullers Earth. The rest 
 of the area is divided into two       
 categories, residential and           
 agricultural.Communications are good, 
 there being easy access to the M1     
 motorway and to the local railway line
 between Bedford and Bletchley. At the 
 present time bus services connect the 
 village with nearby towns.
