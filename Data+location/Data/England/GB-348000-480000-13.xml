		<title>13A LOCAL FACTORY</title>
		<content> Cross &amp; Blackwell, tomato ketchup     
 (produced as the result of a takeover 
 of Libby's by the Nestle group, who   
 also own Cross &amp; Blackwell) and fruit 
 juices, which includes Um Bongo and a 
 highly successful Moonshine drink     
 which in June 1985 sold its 500th     
 million carton. Other changes include 
 the factory modernisation as computers
 now play an important role in         
 production. Despite this the workforce
 consisting of local people is 211,    
 twice the original.The transportation 
 of products is now carried out by road
 and not so much by rail as in the past
 owing to the easy access to the M6 &amp;  
 A6.The output is up from the factory  
 thanks to new machinery and a Â£3.8    
 million investment.Wages which were   
 originally 8d an hour for a 17 yr old 
 have increased keeping place with     
 inflation.                            </content>
