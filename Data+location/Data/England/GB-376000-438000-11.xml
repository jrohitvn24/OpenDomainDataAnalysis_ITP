		<title>11INTERVIEW WITH WILSONS (2)</title>
		<content> During the war{Mr. Wilson}worked as a 
 cook in the army while{Mrs Wilson}had 
 to put up with the rations provided.  
 They could only have a bit of food    
 each week and they used clothes tokens
 for buying clothes.                   
      During the war,blackout time,a   
 warden used to come round to make sure
 no lights were showing.There was no   
 actual bombing in sabden itself during
 the war and the nearest bomb fell in{ 
{Clayton. }                            
    It was very dark in the streets    
 during those days as only{26}gas lamps
 were provided in the whole village.   
    Before the war there were iron bars
 round every garden but they were all  
 pulled up to make planes for the war  
 and if you look now you can still see 
 where they have been pulled up.
