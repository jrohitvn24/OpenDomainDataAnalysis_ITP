		<title>05A rural museum in Breamore 2</title>
		<content> rural industries,all so authentically 
 reproduced that one expects to hear   
 the clang of the anvil in the         
 blacksmith's shop or the satisfying   
 splat of newly made butter being      
 patted into shape in the dairy.Other  
 rural crafts include a cobbler's shed,
 brewery and a wheelwright's shop.In   
 one corner of the building is a full  
 size replica of a 19th century farm   
 labourer's cottage,with the table laid
 for tea ,kettle on the hob and        
 geraniums in the window.              
 A further collection of horse drawn   
 vehicles and fire-fighting equipment  
 can be seen in the Carriage Museum.The
 most eye-catching exhibit here must   
 surely be{Red Rover}the last stage    
 coach to run between London and       
 Southampton.Many of the exhibits      
 featured here were actually used on   
 Breamore estate in the last century.  </content>
