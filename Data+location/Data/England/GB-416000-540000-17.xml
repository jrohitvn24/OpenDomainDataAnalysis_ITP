		<title>17A Visit To Durham Cathedral.</title>
		<content> In April a mini-bus took us to Durham 
 Cathedral for an interesting visit.   
 What was particularly good was the    
 Craftsmen for Christ Exhibition in the
 Norman undercroft.I looked at sone    
 models.One was a stonemason with a    
 hammer.Stonemasons would have         
 sculptured the stone into beautiful   
 shapes.Other models were of monks and 
 I think one could have been of St.    
 Bede who was writing,St.Cuthbert who  
 was holding a cross to his heart,and  
 St.Aidan who was praying.             
   Climbing the cathedral tower  I had 
 the following thoughts"325 steps to   
 climb,Icould not go on.We came to half
 way,not far to go now.Ah,we are at the
 top,looking down,down.Being up here is
 a tremendous feeling.The stone worn   
 away by tramping feet".               
    We visited the tombs of S.Cuthbert 
 and St.Bede in the cathedral.         </content>
