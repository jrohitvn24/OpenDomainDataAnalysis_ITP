		<content>Our school is called Anthony Roper. We 
got this name from a man who lived in  
Elizabethan times. He was Lord of the  
Manor in Farningham. The stags head on 
our school badge is from Anthony Ropers
coat of arms. When we leave our school 
his money buys us bibles to take to our
next schools. We have a modern primary 
school. It was built in 1973. It was a 
single storey building and covers a    
large area. The children are aged five 
to eleven. The school is in a lovely   
environment, it is rural and very      
green. There are lots of trees and     
bushes. The first letter of each in a  
group spells out the message "{MY SON  
BE WISE}". We often see squirrels and  
mallard ducks. Last year we had ducks  
nest quite near our classroom.
