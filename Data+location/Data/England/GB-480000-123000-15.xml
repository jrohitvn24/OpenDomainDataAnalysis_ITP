		<title>15Customs in Rogate</title>
		<content>     There is a story of how  in 1748  
 one Williiam Galley a custom officer  
 was murdered and his body stuffed down
 a well. Popular legend has it that his
 horse was also pushed down after him. 
 The well is on  site at Galley Grove  
 but a modern arch covers its depth.   
    An  elderly resident, tells of one 
 story current when she kept The White 
 Horse public house, of highway men who
 escaped the law and hid in the        
 cellars. The  policemen walked up and 
 down outside still wondering what had 
 happened to the men. Finding some     
 women's clothes in a basket the       
 thieves dressed themselves up and     
 walked boldly out and away.           
    The village band has also had its  
 strange moments when it became so     
 drunk that it spent some time         
 entertaining a haystack thinking it   
 was a house.                          </content>
