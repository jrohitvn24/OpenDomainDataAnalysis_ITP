		<title>09WEST END VILLAGE</title>
		<content> West End village hs been described as 
 "a unique backwater of Victorian      
 England".It has a very active         
 Residents' Association which campaigns
 against the threat to the character of
 the village from increases in traffic 
 and proposed housing developments.Even
 the recent transformation of the      
 village pub, the "Prince of           
 Wales",where a "bootleg era" theme has
 been introduced in the restaurant has 
 generated a great deal of controversy 
 in the community.                     
 The largest local concern is Garson   
 Farm which is a nursery-cum-garden    
 centre.                               
 The Village Hall is a focal point.The 
 playschool meets there and the pigeon 
 club and the Residents' Association   
 also use it. Housing is expensive for 
 what you get.You have to live there a 
 long time before you become a 'local'.</content>
