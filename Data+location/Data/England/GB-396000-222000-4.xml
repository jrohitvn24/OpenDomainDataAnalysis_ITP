		<content> OUR CLASS OF CHILDREN WENT UP THE LANE
 BY{PRESTBURY SCHOOL}TO FIND OUT WHERE 
 THE HOUSES FINISHED AND THE           
 COUNTRYSIDE BEGAN. WE PASSED THE EDGE 
 OF THE{CEMETERY}AND WE REACHED SOME   
 NEW HOUSES WHERE MEN WERE BUILDING.   
 BOVIS HOMES ARE BUILDING A{NEW        
{ESTATE}AND MOST OF THE HOUSES WE SAW  
 HAD DOUBLE GLAZING AND PATIO DOORS.   
 NEARBY, THERE IS A SMALL PARK WITH    
 SWINGS AND A ROUNDABOUT. A{STREAM     
 FLOWS BEHIND THE NEW HOUSES BRINGING  
 WATER DOWN FROM CLEEVE HILL. IT WAS   
 PARTLY BLOCKED BY WASTE METAL AND     
{RUBBISH,}INCLUDING CORRUGATED IRON    
 SHEETS. A LITTLE FURTHER ON, WE SAW IN
 A BIG MUDDY FIELD SEVENTY COWS FROM   
 LOWER NOVERTON FARM GOING TO BE       
 MILKED.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
