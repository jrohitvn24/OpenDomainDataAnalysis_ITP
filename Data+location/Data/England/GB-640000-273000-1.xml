The 12 sq km block takes in most of the
parishes of Wenhaston and Thorington   
and part of the village and parish of  
Bramfield. It is largely farming land  
with some woodland and the remains of  
heathlands that in Suffolk are called  
Sandlings. The sandlings are underlain 
by glacial outwash sands and gravel.   
The settlements are ancient, being     
pre-Norman and have had a remarkably   
consistent population up to the        
beginning of the 20th century when a   
steady decline began. The parishes of  
Bramfield and Wenhaston each support   
their own primary schools, but         
Thorington has no nucleated settlement 
and consists of isolated farms.        
The farming is largely arable, but     
there is some fruit growing in the west
of the block, and some cattle are kept 
on the water meadows by the streams.   </content>
