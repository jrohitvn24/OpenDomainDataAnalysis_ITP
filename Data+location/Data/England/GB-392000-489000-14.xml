		<title>14THE VILLAGES</title>
		<content>{ASKRIGG,}like the other villages of   
 the area, mainly serves the farming   
 community, although the forest market 
 that once flourished there no longer  
 takes place. The tourist industry is  
 now important and Askrigg's fame has  
 been enhanced by being known as the   
 village in which the Vet's house      
 appears in the BBC's "All Creatures   
 Great and Small".              {      
{BAINBRIDGE }was established as        
 a forester's village (under the Roman 
 fort of{VIROSIDUM}) as part of the    
 administration of the old forest of   
 Wensleydale. Each evening at 9pm from 
 27th September to Shrovetide, a horn  
 is blown three times over the village 
 green, a practice started in order to 
 guide travellers through the forest.  
 The present Hornblower is 12 year old 
 Alistair Metcalfe. The Metcalfes have 
 been the hornblowers for 300 years.   </content>
