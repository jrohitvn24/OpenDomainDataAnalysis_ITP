		<title>19Attitudes in Woburn 3</title>
		<content>{Attitudes to Facilities}              
 Most people in Woburn think that there
 is quite a reasonable selection of    
 shops in the village, but there could 
 be a few more practical shops like a  
 fishmongers and a chemist.            
 The{only bus}that passes through      
 Woburn is one from{Bedford.}There is  
 none that go to the main shopping     
 centre in{Milton Keynes,}but most     
 people would like one. One of the shop
 keepers thought that there were enough
 buses, but this is probably because   
 people would stop going to her shop if
 they could get to Milton Keynes where 
 goods are cheaper. Many people feel   
 that Woburn needs a{by-pass}because   
 the roads often become congested with 
 heavy lorries. Parked cars also cause 
 congestion, so people think yellow    
 lines should be painted along the High
 Street and a car park should be built.</content>
