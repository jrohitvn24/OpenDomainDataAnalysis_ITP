		<title>20NEW TECHNOLOGY IN CULWORTH</title>
		<content>In 1980 school children in Culworth    
were visited by parents to show them   
what computers looked like.Some        
children visited the home of Mr Walker 
a local accountant who had begun to use
a computer in his work.In 1985 ,the    
majority of older children and about   
half of the younger children have at   
least 1 computer in their homes.They   
are mostly used for playing games.At   
least one parent markets computers     
abroad.Mr walker's business now an     
Accounting and Data Processing Service 
relies heavily on the use of computer  
control.One parent markets lasers,one  
travels the world as air crew and one  
speaks to other nations via radio link.
This small,apparently sleepy village is
certainly part of C20.Children,Teachers
Parents and Friends of Culworth CE     
Primary School send greetings of PEACE 
to all who read this,wherever,whenever.</content>
