		<title>05DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content> Dairy farming is a very big industry  
 in this area. Nowadays most people    
 have electric milking machines. Most  
 milking machines can milk four cows at
 once.                                 
     The first thing you have to do is 
 fetch the cows up from the field. Then
 you put them a building ready to be   
 milked.Then the cows go into the      
 milking parlour to be milked.Then you 
 put units on the cow's udder.The units
 suck the milk out of the cow.Then the 
 milk goes through a pipe to another   
 parlour.Then it goes through a        
 cleaning process then into a tank.For 
 sixty cows it takes about one and a   
 half hours.Every morning a milk tanker
 comes and takes the milk to Bamber    
 Bridge and it is sold as cheese,      
 butter or just as nice cold milk.Some 
 people in Catforth have their own     
 dairies and sell their own milk.      </content>
