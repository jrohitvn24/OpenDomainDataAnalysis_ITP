 to Sharnbrook Summit, which is a      
 nature reserve leased by the

 excavated during the 1850's as part of
 the railway track linking Bedford with
 Leicester. The line was opened in 1857
 and is still in use today. The tunnel 
 baulk, provides a fine viewing point. 
 The baulk supports a wide variety of  
 plants including cowslips, common     
 birds foot trefoil, oxe eye daisy,
