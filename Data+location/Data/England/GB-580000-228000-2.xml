		<content> We went up to the crossroads by St.   
 Andrews church to do a traffic survey.
 We discovered the road to Sudbury was 
 the busiest, 256 vehicles an hour and 
 on market day there were 408 vehicles 
 travelling in the same direction. It  
 is very difficult for lorry drivers to
 turn. One lorry had to drive on the   
 pavement to turn into Hedingham Road  
 from Colchester Road. There is        
 normally a long queue going to        
 Braintree. We wrote down the          
 registration numbers of the lorries.  
 Most of them were not local. Some of  
 them were from as far away as         
 Scotland. On market day more of the   
 lorries were local.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
