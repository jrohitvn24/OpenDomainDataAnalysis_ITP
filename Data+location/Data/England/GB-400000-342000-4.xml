		<content>We surveyed the majority of shops in   
Cheadle High St. which amounted to     
about 50.Most of the shops were more   
than 50 yrs. old and many had changed  
hands &amp; uses over the yrs.Most owners  
knew the age &amp; previous history of     
their shops.Miss Salt's Wool Shop had  
belonged to the same family for 100    
yrs.It is still in use as a wool shop &amp;
has changed very little. The original  
shop fittings are still in use.Most    
customers live locally and Friday &amp;    
Saturday are the busiest days of the   
week.Most shops employed very few staff
(between 1-5).The Co-op was the largest
employer with 20-30 staff. Many shops  
had part time assistants. There were   
169 women &amp; 116 men working in the     
shops.The majority of the shops were   
small family concerns providing a      
personal service to the public.
