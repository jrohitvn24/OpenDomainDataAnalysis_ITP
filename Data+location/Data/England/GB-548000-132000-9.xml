		<content> My name is Jamie Donald. I am 8 years 
 old and have one younger brother. I   
 live near Forest Lodge Farm in a      
 three-bedroomed{house.}My dad and     
 uncle are busy building an extension  
 which will give us a new bedroom,     
 kitchen, utility room and study. Dad  
 works at home. He is a{mechanic}and   
 repairs cars. Our own car is a beat-up
 old Renault because we are spending   
 all our money on the house. I get a   
 lift to school because it is rather   
 too far to walk. When I get home at   
 3.30 I change and play outside until  
 six, when we eat as a{family.}Then I  
 watch TV or play indoors until bedtime
 between 8 and 9. I see my grndparents 
 every Sunday. We have a holiday flat  
 in Spain and have just spent two weeks
 there.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
