 talked to pensioners at a O.A.P.club  
 the good companions.They left school  
 from the ages 10-14.The girls went    
 into service.Bus to Norwich was 4.d   
 but most people walked.There was 1    
 school - The Old School,but its shut  
 down.The village hall was built for   
 soldiers in the 1st world war and is  
 still standing.                       
 BLACKFORD HALL FARM:1 of the eldest   
 surviving buildings,the moated white  
 farmhouse dates back to Henry II and  
 is partly flint covered.3 windows     
 survive from its early history.The    
 other brick building dates from the   
 late 19th Century.There is supposed to
 be a ghost on the farm called'Tillet',

 stormy night to the sound of cart     
 wheels.                               </content>
