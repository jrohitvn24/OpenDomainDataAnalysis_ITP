		<content>   Very little of our land is used for 
 building purposes it is mainly        
 agricultural.The main land use in our 
 area is arable.There is fertile soil  
 especially in the Great Hollanden Farm
 area,this is because about 10,000 yrs.
 ago after the Ice Age,water flowed    
 from the hills around and carried and 
 deposited fertile silt.In other parts 
 of Hildenborough there is             
 Hildenborough clay.There is also      
 fertile soil in the east of our area  
 around Shipbourne.                    
   Wheat,barley and oats are grown,oats
 near Horns Lodge,wheat and barley grow
 extensively where there is good       
 soil.Other crops grown in smaller     
 quantities are peas,beans and rape.The
 peas go to Japan to be dried and      
 salted like peanuts,if the beans are  
 fresh they are used as cattle food,if 
 mouldy they are used as dog biscuits. </content>
