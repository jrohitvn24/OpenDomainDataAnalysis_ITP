		<title>08       SARK SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The Sark School was built in 1826. In 
 1850 Sark was the first place to make 
 schooling compulsery in the British   
 Isles. The school has thirtyfour      
 children on it's school roll, ten     
 infants, eight juniors and sixteen    
 seniors. The school building doubles  
 as a court and parliament.            
 The junior and infant schools are     
 built over old gravestones which where
 discovered when the foundations were  
 laid. The building stands over the    
 site of a medeival cemetry.           
 Sark still retains the 11+ exam. If   
 one passes one may go to the grammar  
 school or Elizabeth College,both of   
 which are on Guernsey.If you fail you 
 stay on Sark and may go to Guernsey   
 later. School begins at age 4\,but if 
 there is no room then from 5 years,to 
 15.
