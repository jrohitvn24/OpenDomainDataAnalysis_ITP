		<title>11The Post Office, Eglingham.</title>
		<content>  The Post Office was originally opened
 in the 1800's, the first in this area.
 The mail came into Eglingham and was  
 sorted there, then delivered to nearby
 villages by three postmen on foot.    
  Mr and Mrs Barclay took over the post
 office 25 years ago and in 1972 saw a 
 big change. The mail became sorted and
 delivered from Alnwick. This postal   
 area now covers only from New Bewick  
 to Bannermoor and over to Beanly.     
  Although the mail is not delivered   
 from here now the post office is still
 very important because it covers a lot
 of other items:{                      
 i.e.{pensions, allowances, licenses,  
{   giro and savings bank, bus and rail
{   cards and travellers cheques.      
 They also stock a good selection of   
 groceries, stationery, papers, ice    
 cream and ordered fresh bread, an     
 essential in this rural community.    </content>
