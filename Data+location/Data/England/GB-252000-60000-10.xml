		<title>10Bickleigh/Wotter housing</title>
		<content> The core of Bickleigh village consists
 of turn of the century workmen's      
 houses built by Sir Massey Lopes. They
 are characterised by small gabled     
 upstairs windows and a stone with ML  
 and date in each front wall. A few    
 modern houses have been added and the 
 out-buildings of a farm are being     
 converted into dwellings. Bickleigh   
 camo buildings are are square modern  
 "barracks architecture". In Wotter 50%
 of the houses were built by the china 
 clay company which still owns and     
 maintains them.There are a few private
 dwellings, the rest are dull council  
 houses.The farms are much older than  
 the villages.Three of them date from  
 the 14th century and belonged         
 originally to Plympton Priory.They    
 have been modernised but retain many  
 orioginal features eg dove holes at   
 Lower Collard Farm.                   </content>
