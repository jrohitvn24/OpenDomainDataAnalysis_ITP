 The{1973}water act set up 10 water    
 authorities in England and Wales. The 
 Northumbrian is responsible for our   
 "D" block water and sewage supply. The
 water collected from the ground is    
 piped 80 miles from Kielder Dam. The  
 main hazards of impure water are      
 disease causing bacteria and viruses, 
 lead and nitrates. The water is       
 treated with chlorine.Every house in  
 "D" block has an indoor tap water     
 supply and sewage system. Most water  
 is used for WC flushing{12%,}washing  
 and bathing{9%,}laundry{5%,}washing up
{3%,}carwashing and garden use{1%,     
 drinking, food preparation and        
 cleaning{7%.}Water is paid for by a   
 water rate system although this is    
 being reviewed and water meters may be
 installed. There is a small sewage    
 pumping station in Kirklevington.     </content>
