		<content> Many natural habitats provide an abun-
 dance of wild life in this region. The
 River Humber, with large mudflats,sup-
 ports a variety of bird  life.  Wading
 birds  are attracted  to  the  feeding
 grounds at low water red-shanks, green
 shanks, curlews,shell ducks, mallards,
 teal, wigeon, cormorants and an occas-
 ional  heron  are  just  some  of  the
 species to be found. Reeds Island is a
 haven for wildlife. Thousands of gulls
 roost there  and  on  surrounding  mud
 banks.  The  island is a nesting place
 for long eared owls and red deer  have
 been introduced onto the grassland.Oc-
 casionally a seal can be  seen basking
 in the river.In Autumn pink foot, grey
 lag and Canada geese feed on the  mud-
 banks  on  their  migration south. Oil
 polution  in  the  river  can severely
 affect the bird population. There is  
 an abundance of small mammals.        </content>
