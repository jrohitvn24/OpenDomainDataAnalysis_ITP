  SHOPPING. There is a shop in the     
village which is quite well patronised,
about one quarter of those interviewed 
said they used it every day. Most      
people however shopped for food in     
Kettering, 2.5 miles away and other    
major items came from Kettering or     
Northampton, 10 miles away.            
                                       
  HOLIDAYS. Over half of those         
interviewed holidayed in Britain and   
one quarter went abroad. One fifth     
never took a holiday away from home.
