		<title>15A Day in the Life of my Mum</title>
		<content>    On a Saturday my mum gets up at    
 about a quarter past seven so that she
 may watch TV-am and have her breakfast
 and a cup of tea. Then if she is not  
 already dressed  she goes upstairs to 
 dress and get ready for work.         
    She works from ten until one in the
 afternoon when she comes home for     
 dinner and does the washing up,washing
 and housework. That takes till twenty 
 past three when she comes to fetch my 
 sisters and me from the garden outside
 to have a drink of orange and a       
 biscuit. We turn on the T.V. to see   
 what's on. If it's wrestling my dad   
 watches but if it's football it goes  
 straight off.                         
    We have tea at five then have the  
 T.V. back on. We have a bedtime drink 
 after nine and go to bed at ten. My   
 mum goes to bed at eleven.
