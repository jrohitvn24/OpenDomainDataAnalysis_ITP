		<title>14Small Businesses, N. Lopham</title>
		<content>      In this quiet Norfolk village we 
 have some unusual small businesses.   
 One is a pop record company, which    
 sells records around the world.  The  
 owner said that the record business is
 slowly declining, because more people 
 are buying tapes instead of records.  
 The owner has lived in the village for
 8 years and has a barn instead of a   
 proper studio.  He lived in Ilford    
 before, but thinks it is much nicer   
 down here in the village.             
      A second small, one-man business 
 makes terrariums, glass cases for     
 models and odd bits and pieces, using 
 glass, copper and solder.  The maker  
 took up the craft several years ago   
 as a hobby and takes 2-5 hours to make
 one terrarium.  He said that          
 terrariums can be filled with other   
 things besides plants, e.g. silk      
 flower arrangments.                   </content>
