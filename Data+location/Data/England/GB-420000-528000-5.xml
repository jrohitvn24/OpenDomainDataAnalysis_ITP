		<title>05BISHOP AUCKLAND - TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> We have a railway station in {Bishop  
{Auckland.}The only trains that come   
 into it are from {Darlington.}The cost
 is 90p. A new{bus station }was opened 
 on 10.5.84. There are 6 bus companies 
 using it. The first bus comes from Tow
 Law at 5.20a.m.The last bus comes from
 Tow law at 12.15a.m.Lots of buses take
 tours abroad.In our school, we talked 
 to a bus driver who told us where he  
 changed buses.It was the {United}bus  
 he was going to drive.In our school   
 62% of the families have a car.The    
{most popular make}is {Ford.}The most  
 popular foreign makes are {Japanese.} 
 Most cars were 1300cc to 1600cc,      
 probably because of the cost of       
 petrol (Â£2.04). We have not got a car 
 but my dad can drive.He has a tandem  
 instead.A tandem is a bike for two    
 people.I used to go to school on the  
 back of it.It is very nice.           </content>
