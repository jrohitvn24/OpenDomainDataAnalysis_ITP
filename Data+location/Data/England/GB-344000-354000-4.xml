 Everyone seems to enjoy our Luncheon  
 Club at Clutton School which we have  
 every Thursday at 1pm. We can do      
 this because there are now fewer      
 children in the village school and    
 they have the space for us.The school 
 cook provides dinner for up to 20     
 people from the surrounding districts.
 It gives people a purpose to meet     
 because 1985 is very much the age of  
 the motorcar and people no longer walk
 as much. When we don't meet in the    
 natural course of the day it makes for
 quite a lot of loneliness especially  
 in the older generation.              
    After lunch we are able to sit and 
 talk,play cards or just socalise.     
 Sometimes the children come in the    
 hall and talk to us whilst we have a  
 cup of tea until we are ready to      
 depart to our homes.                  </content>
