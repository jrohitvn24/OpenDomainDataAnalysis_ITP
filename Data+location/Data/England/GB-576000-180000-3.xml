   The main entrance to the Methane    
 Terminal is down Thames Road, on      
 Canvey. To get in, you must go to the 
 main entrance, where there is a       
 security man, sitting inside a booth. 
 He also controls cameras, so that he  
 can see all around. I also saw an     
 Alsatian dog running free in a        
 compound. We were not able to get in  
 because you must be 18 yrs. old.      
   However, we walked along the sea    
 wall,{behind}the Terminal. We saw the 
 jetty which the Terminal owns. This is
 where ships come up the Thames and    
 moor. The jetty sticks out into the   
 deep water channel of the Thames.     
   From the sea wall we saw many white 
 storage tanks,with coloured flashes.  
 The Terminal was well guarded by dogs 
 and special barbed wire and cameras.  
 They store gas there.                 </content>
