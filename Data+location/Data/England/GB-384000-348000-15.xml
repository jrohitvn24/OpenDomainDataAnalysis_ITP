		<title>15LIFESTYLES POTTERS HOLIDAY.</title>
		<content>    Every year a worker in the         
Potteries has these holidays,one week  
at Easter,the first Monday in          
May,which is called May Day.The        
PotterÂ£s Fortnight,the last week in    
Juneand the first week in July.One week
in August,which is the last week,and   
two weeks at Christmas..               
                      The PotterÂ£s     
fortnight is where all the potteries   
have two weeks off,and the schools and 
most of the factories have have those  
two weeks off too.When they finish work
all the pottery factories close down   
for their holiday.Then most people go  
away,for example Blackpool and Rhyl are
are the most popular places to visit in
Britain.                               
        When everyone goes away for    
their holidays our area is empty and   
quiet.
