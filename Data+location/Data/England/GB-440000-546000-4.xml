		<title>04TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN SEAHAM</title>
		<content> FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE IN SEAHAM HAVE 
 BEEN WORRIED ABOUT THE HEAVY LORRIES  
 AND TANKERS USING THE ROADS.TO KEEP   
 THESE VEHICLES AWAY FROM HOUSES AND   
 PEOPLE CERTAIN RULES HAVE BEEN        
 INTRODUCED.NO HEAVY GOODS VEHICLES ARE
 ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ALONG THE AVENUE OR 
 STATION ROAD UNLESS THEY NEED TO      
 DELIVER OR LOAD GOODS.THEY MUST USE   
 LORD BYRON'S WALK.THIS IS A PITY AS   
 THIS ROAD IS A PICTURESQUE RAMBLE TO  
 THE BEACH.THEY CAN ALSO USE THE NEW   
 BY-PASS ROAD,BUILT IN 1978 AND PARTLY 
 FINANCED BY THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC     
 COMMUNITY.WE HAVE A LARGE PROPORTION  
 OF LORRIES VISITING THE COLLIERIES ,  
 THE DOCKS,THE FACTORIES,BUILDING SITES
 AND GARAGES.UPON LEAVING SEAHAM THE   
 LORRIES CAN USE THE A19 TRUNK ROAD TO 
 TRAVEL NORTH OR SOUTH OR THE B1404 TO 
 GO WEST.                              
                                       </content>
