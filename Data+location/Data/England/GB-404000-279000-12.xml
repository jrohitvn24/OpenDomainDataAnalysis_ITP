		<title>12Siege (1) in Kings Heath</title>
		<content>A{gunman}held armed detectives at bay  
in a siege in{Kings Heath}after a      
policewoman and a detective            
superintendent were shot. A man, named 
{James Field,}was holed-up with a shot-
gun in a flat on a top floor of a house
at{10 Drayton Road}. Fifty police      
wearing flak jackets, ringed the       
terraced home as a "Softly, Softly"    
operation was mounted to persuade the  
gunman to surrender peacefully. At     
11.15 am.,{nine hours}after the siege  
started, four people, a husband and    
wife and another man and woman, were   
allowed to leave the house. Television 
cameras, radio and newspaper reporters 
were in Kings Heath all day until just 
after the siege ended at 3.45.
