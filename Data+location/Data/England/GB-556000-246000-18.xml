		<title>18TOURISM IN LINTON</title>
		<content>   St. Mary's church was built before  
 the 1300's.The north porch was built  
 in Norman times.The right side of the 
 church was built by the Paris family, 
 but the left side was built by the    
 Millucernt family.In July there is a  
 flower festival,which attracts about  
 2000 visitors a year.                 
  The water tower is placed on Rivey   
 hill and it can be seen for miles     
 around,it is the symbol on the Linton 
 Village College school badges.        
  The Mill is no longer in use.It was a
 corn mill built between 1800 and 1900.
 It is not the biggest tourist         
 attraction.                           
  Many of the cottages on each side of 
 the High Street are old and           
 attractive,because of the timber,flint
 walls,thatching and carved plaster.
