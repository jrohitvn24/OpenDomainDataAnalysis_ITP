		<title>01Barton Abbey Estate</title>
		<content> The first lord of the manor was Bishop
 Odo of Bayeux, and the present house  
 was built c.1524, although it was not 
 named 'Abbey' until 1860. An attic    
 room, 92 ft long, was painted with    
 frescoes and fitted as a Roman        
 Catholic chapel in the sixteenth      
 century. In the nineteenth century the
 house had a large estate of 2,500     
 acres, consisting of 5 farms, but in  
 the 1920s the estate was split up. Now
 Barton Abbey estate has 300 acres of  
 parkland and 1,710 acres of farmland, 
 including Home Farm, Church Farm,     
 Leys Farm and Whistlow. Most of the   
 farmland is used for cereal growing,  
 and the parkland for grazing sheep.   
 The grounds of Barton Abbey have      
 always been used for fetes and flower 
 shows, and more recently for gymkhanas
 - the 15th was held there in 1985.
