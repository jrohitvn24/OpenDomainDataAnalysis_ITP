		<title>07The Shop Manager.</title>
		<content> My job is affected by the weather and 
 the time of year.I have to make sure  
 there are adequate supplies for       
 everyone as there is no other shop    
 they can use.Also during the summer we
 get supplies on 3 days a week,so with 
 large numbers of visitors,this takes a
 lot of planning.During the winter we  
 can experience long periods of bad    
 weather which may mean that we don't  
 get fresh supplies for over a week.   
 This has to be taken into             
 consideration when submitting orders. 
 Personally I found my first winter on 
 Lundy quite a novelty,having had a    
 regular 9-5 job for many years.       
 However last winter I felt depressed  
 for sometime during January and       
 February.Once the better weather      
 arrived we started receiving large    
 numbers of visitors and my days got   
 much more interesting.                </content>
