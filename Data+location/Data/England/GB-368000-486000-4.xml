		<content>  The school as we know it today was   
 built in 1968,but this purpose built  
 building incorporates the original    
 National School,which is now known as 
 the Memorial Hall, built in 1845 and  
 serving as a school hall for dinners  
 P.E.,dance,drama and music during the 
 school day and being used as a        
 village hall in the evenings and at   
 weekends.                             
   The main building consists of three 
 classrooms,staffroom and toilets.     
 Because there are only 45 children on 
 roll,one of our classrooms is used as 
 a library and T.V.room.We have two    
 full time teachers,one for one morning
 a week,a secretary for a few hours,a  
 helper part time,a dinner lady,a cook 
 with her helper and a cleaner come    
 caretaker.The Junior teacher is also  
 the headmisstress who is in charge of 
 the school.          {                </content>
