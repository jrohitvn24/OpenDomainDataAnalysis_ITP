		<content> We went bird-watching along Salary    
 Brook and through Welshwood Park. On  
 the way we saw the following birds:   
 chaffinch, wren, crow, pigeon, jay,   
 dunnock, yellow-hammer, robin, rook,  
 mistle-thrush, song-thrush, great     
 spotted woodpecker, blackbird,        
 red-legged partridge, pheasant, lesser
 black-backed gull, kestrel and linnet.
{Bullock Wood}is between Ipswich Road  
 and Ardleigh Road. It contains many   
 different trees such as silver birches
 and sweet chestnuts. There are also   
 foxes, grey squirrels and many birds, 
 including blackbirds, robins and jays.
 A long path circles inside the wood,  
 so if you stay on it you will not     
 become lost. However, when walking    
 through, boots and trousers should be 
 worn, as there large banks of nettles.
 Beautiful flowers grow there, such as 
 bluebells and mouse-eared hawkweed.   </content>
