Amateur Theatrical Society. RATS       
started in 1971 by the then rector     
Mr Cornish.The RATS first production   
was "Music hall". The second a musical 
called "The  Boyfriend".RATS do        
about 3 or 4 plays a year one of which 
is always a pantomime.This year it     
will be the first time RATS have ever  
repeated a pantomime-"Aladdin".The     
ages of the performers range from 11   
to over 70.RATS raise money for        
charity by doing old time music        
Halls,barn dances and westerns,etc.    
Different members produce plays as     
well. There is a lot of work that goes 
on behind the scenes such as makeup    
artists, costumes, hairstyles,         
refreshments,scenery, music,ticket     
selling, publicity and prompting.      
Several original members are still in  
the RATS.                              </content>
