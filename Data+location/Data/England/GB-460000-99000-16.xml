      For cycle fanatics, a recent     
 addition is a BMX track used by both  
 boys and girls.                       
      There are at least three snooker 
 clubs; pool and darts are also        
 available in several pubs.            
      Also in the area is the Thorngate
 Hall; a popular venue for amateur     
 dramatic productions, youth clubs,    
 discos, keep fit and an organ society.
      There is a small boating lake in 
 Walpole Park and a Model Yachting     
 Lake, used for major competitions by  
 clubs from many parts of the world.   
      There are the usual guides,      
 scouts, brownies and cubs, dancing    
 schools and majorettes which are very 
 popular.                              
     There is a well equipped library  
 to be found in Walpole Road.
