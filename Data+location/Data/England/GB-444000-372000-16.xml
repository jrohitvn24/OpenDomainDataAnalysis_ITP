		<content>{ Entertainment.-}In the Woodthorpe,   
 Poolsbrook and Duckmanton area this is
 very poor.  We researched video       
 libraries, Cinemas, Computer Shops,   
 Discos, Pubs and Sports Clubs, there  
 was little of any.  We found a few    
 pubs and football, hockey and cricket 
 teams.  It would be useful in the     
 future if there were more places of   
 entertainment.                        
{ Media.-}Our survey on television     
 programes showed the following to be  
 the most popular programmes:Calendar  
 (local news),various soap operas(eg:  
 Coronation Street, Crossroads and     
 others).  Quizes were next followed by
 comedy and then sports programmes.    
  When asked to choose between watching
 a play, a film, live sport, the news  
 or a comedy most people chose a film.
