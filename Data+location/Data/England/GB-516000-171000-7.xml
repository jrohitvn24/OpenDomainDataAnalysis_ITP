		<title>07A CHILD IN HAM 60 YEARS AG0</title>
		<content>{  Ham}used to be a little village in  
 the country. There were a few shops,{a
{sweet shop, a grocer, a butcher}and{a 
{general store}that sold everything    
 from butter to paraffin. The rest of  
 Ham was just{farms}and{orchards.}The  
 rent for a cottage in Ham Street was  
 about{7/6d}(37.5p) per week. They had 
 no electricity but they had{gas}      
 downstairs. Each cottage had a{kitchen
{range}and a{copper}in it. The{lavatory
 was half way down the garden. Going to
{school}must have  been very hard      
 because even for not holding your     
 pencil properly you were{caned}across 
 the knuckles. On the 24th.May,{Empire 
{Day}each child was given a{bun}and an{
{orange}by Mr.Hill the baker. Pocket   
 money was{2d}(0.5p) spent on{sweets}  
 which were wrapped up in a{newspaper  
{cone.}
