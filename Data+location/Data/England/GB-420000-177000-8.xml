		<title>08FARMING - FARM VEHICLES</title>
		<content> Being an area that is extremely       
 difficult to reach, the most useful   
 vehicles are tractors and Landrovers. 
 The cultivated fields are large and   
 very uneven.  Combine harvesters,     
 trailers, balers, ploughs, disc       
 harrows, rakes, riddles, seed         
 spreaders and sprayers are all used in
 the harvest cycle.  On one specialised
 farm a single track vehicle is used in
 bad conditions.  Diesel fuel is kept  
 in storage tanks on some of the farms 
 as there are no fuel stations in the  
 immediate vicinity.  Beef cattle and  
 sheep are transported out of the area 
 by waggons brought in for this        
 purpose.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
