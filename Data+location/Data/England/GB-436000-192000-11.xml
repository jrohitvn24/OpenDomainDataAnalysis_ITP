		<content>Charney Manor (which was mentioned in  
the Domesday Book) has had many owners.
In 1906 it was restored from its       
delapidated state,and in 1948 was      
bought by a group of Oxford Quakers led
by Henry Gillett. They presented it to 
the Society of Friends for use as "a   
place where people might come to find  
peace of mind,friendliness &amp;           
relaxation".Now a Charitable Trust,    
Charney Manor is developing its role as
a Quaker House &amp; Conference Centre.    
There are regular meetings for worship 
in the Solar with its open timber work 
ceiling.The residential conference     
centre is open to all denominations.   
Charitable work includes training      
groups e.g.Oxfam &amp; Samaritans. The     
establishment is aided by the William  
Allen Society based in London and the  
Friends of Charney Manor who give help 
and raise funds when necessary.        </content>
