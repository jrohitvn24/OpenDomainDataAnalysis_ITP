		<title>08ALL SOULS PRIORY.</title>
		<content>{ All Souls Priory}is a large building 
 tucked away in{Old Headington.}It is  
 occupied by some working nuns but is  
 mainly a home for{elderly sisters.}   
  Belonging to the order of{The Sacred}
{Heart Of Jesus,}founded in{1813,}in   
{France,}the nuns are active and work  
 in the community,{nursing}and         
{teaching.}They used to{teach only,}but
 due to many requests they became      
 nurses as well. This caused the order 
 to split, but the{two halves}continue 
 to do both jobs. As they are working  
 they wear{black}or{grey pinafores}and 
 veils, very different from the{long}  
{black habits}worn in the{past.}       
  The{Priory}belonged to a{closed}order
 until the nuns moved in, in{1969.}Many
 changes had to be made, as the house  
 was so dull, in fact workmen refused  
 to stay in the rooms alone as they    
 said it was{"too spooky."}            </content>
