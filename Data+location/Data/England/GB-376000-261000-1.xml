		<title>01LITTLE WITLEY - A SUMMARY</title>
		<content>   This is a{rural}area, based on a    
 village, with a small population.There
 are old established farming families  
 as well as affluent commuters to towns
 like Birmingham. Unemployment is low  
 and local nurseries, farms and        
 orchards provide opportunities for    
 casual work.                          
   The area has no shops or pubs and   
{very few amenities.}Despite this lack 
 of facilities Little Witley is a very 
 active and{close-knit community}which 
 generates its own social life. This   
 social life thrives from close        
 communication between the Women's     
 monthly meetings and the men's Social 
 Club evenings. Newcomers are quickly  
 integrated into the community.        
   The text describes in detail the    
 village organizations, work done on   
 the land and the homelife of families.
 Ecology and houses are also described.</content>
