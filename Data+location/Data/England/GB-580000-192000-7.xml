     Summer 1985,s fashions give a very
 casual outlook.Cotton trousers rolled 
 up at the bottom are the in thing at  
 the moment.Canvas shoes are very      
 popular with the girls.The in colours 
 are lemon, pale pink, lilac,light blue
 and turquoise.Stilettos are another   
 craze to wear. These are  very pointed
 at the toes and the name stilettos    
 comes from the heels.The ladies skirts
 are normally very tight and short or  
 not so tight and much longer.Big      
 flowers on skirts and blouses are     
 also fashionable.Hats are not in the  
 fashion at the moment.luminous socks  
 are fashionable,mostly worn by the    
 young.When it is cooler the fashion   
 is a Gallini jumper.In the hotter     
 weather there are Gabicci teashirts   
 for the boys.                         </content>
