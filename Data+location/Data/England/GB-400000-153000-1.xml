		<content> Market Lavington,a small village in an
 enclosed area is peaceful despite the 
 noise of tanks and guns.Our village is
 in a valley with the army estate in   
 the gigantic ditch.The shops are west 
 of the estate,the school is north,    
 south is{Salisbury Plain}and east is  
 Easterton.A main road goes through    
 West Lavington,Market Lavington and   
 Easterton with roads leading to the   
 army estate,the school and{Broadwell} 
 where people used to get their        
 water. It isn't like a well,more like 
 a concrete swimming pool.Our school is
 on top of a hill up which I walk.     
 Between Market Lavington and West     
 Lavington there is a comprehensive    
 school where children from Market     
 Lavington,Easterton,West Lavington and
 Urchfont go.
