		<title>15Houses in the area</title>
		<content> All the houses in Pendock are rather  
 old.My house is next to the school as 
 it once belonged to the school.       
 Heathers was once a pub.Alex's was a  
 bakery.People used to go to the shops 
 in the village.Now there is only one  
 shop because they go to the super     
 markets,in near by towns.All houses   
 are old because the Policy says you   
 can not build a lot of houses at a    
 time in the country side.             
                 Because the houses are
 so spread out,all of them have very   
 large beautiful gardens.Lots of them  
 have small areas of land and orchard  
 attached to them,so some people keep  
 goats or ponies.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
