		<title>14The Village C.B. Network</title>
		<content>    Our Rector started a C.B. radio net
 club for the older people. It is used 
 to  contact them every day to check   
 that they are well.The radio operators
 call up all the people in the morning 
 using special C.B. names like Rabbit, 
 Sunshine and Dancing Lady. They say   
 things like, "How are you? Do you need
 anything?" and "Do you want to speak  
 to anyone else?"                      
    There are about 28 people in the   
 network using hand-held or home base  
 radios. The Rector carries one with   
 him all the time.                     
    The network has been going for     
 about a year and a half, and it has   
 been on television, on radio and in   
 magazines quite a lot. Each C.B. unit 
 costs about Â£100 and a group of people
 called The Mad Men help the Rector by 
 raising money                         
                                       </content>
