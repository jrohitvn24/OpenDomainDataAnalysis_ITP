		<title>12THE DISUSED RAILWAY</title>
		<content> In July 1856{Lewes and Uckfield       
{Railway Company}opened their          
 line. Twelve years later a small      
 stretch was opened between Lewes and  
 Hamsey so that trains could run from  
 Brighton to Uckfield and beyond       
 without having to interrupt their     
 journey by reversing.                 
 In the 1960's British Railways decided
 to close the line because the viaduct 
 over the River  Ouse was unsafe. The  
 line was not making muh profit because
 more people had cars.{The last train  
{to run from Lewes to Uckfield was in  
{February 1969.                        
 Running up the Ouse Valley, the       
 disused line enables people to walk   
 through Malling and Hamsey. The       
 remains of the railway can be easily  
 seen eg. the ruins of the viaduct over
 the Ouse and the junction of the 1856 
 and 1868 lines north of there.        </content>
