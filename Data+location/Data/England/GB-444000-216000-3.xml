		<title>03AMENITIES IN WOODSTOCK</title>
		<content>  Woodstock is provided with ample     
clubs and amenities to satisfy all     
tastes. Sports are catered for with    
several tennis courts and an heated    
out-door pool. For a more leisurely way
to spend time, there is a river and a  
lake where fishing is allowed with a   
permit.                                
  Many clubs are run for the local     
people or any one who wants to join.   
Slimmers clubs and keep fit classes    
are held once or twice a week at the   
community centre for the fitness       
conscious.                             
  Children and teenagers have a youth  
club where on several days of the week 
they can go. Like most towns Woodstock 
has a Brownie and Scout hut.           
  The younger generation provides the  
elderly of Woodstock with a Good       
Companions Club, where the elderly can 
meet with a friend or go on outings.   </content>
