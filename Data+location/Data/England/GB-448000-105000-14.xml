		<content>  Following the establishment of a     
 thriving{market garden industry},the  
 area quickly developed.Soon,factories,
 roads,churches,schools,railway lines, 
 and other amenities grew up to serve  
 the new community.                    
  In{1880}the jam factory was built by 
{Louis Lynn and Co .}In 1886,{St.John's
{Mission}was built and this was turned 
 into a school eight years later.In the
 same year(1894){St.John's Church}was  
 finished.In{1902}, a congregational   
 church,a pub (The Sir Joseph Paxton), 
 and a Post Office were built. So, by  
 the turn of the century,the area had  
 many amenities to offer its growing   
 population.                           
  The twentieth century has seen the   
 emergence of a variety of new         
 industries which have encouraged a    
 still greater influx of people.
