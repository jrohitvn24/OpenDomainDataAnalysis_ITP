		<title>15Culcheth Sewage Works</title>
		<content> The sewage works takes sewage from    
 Lowton, Culcheth and Glazebury. It can
 handle 30,000 cubic metres of         
 sewage a day. There are computers so  
 three men operate all the machinary.  
 Screw pumps lift the sewage from the  
 sewers. Screening gets out paper and  
 cloths etc. The sewage goes into the  
 settling tanks and all the sludge     
 sinks to the bottom. Sludge pumps deep
 under the ground pump out the sludge  
 into tanks. Next the sewage goes      
 through a bed of stones, and worms and
 bacteria break down any organic       
 matter. The water is now clean enough 
 to into the River Glaze. Small hills  
 have been made and trees have been    
 planted to improve the look of the    
 works. There is only a smell when     
 sewage is coming in to the works,     
 while at the other end there is hardly
 any smell at all.                     </content>
