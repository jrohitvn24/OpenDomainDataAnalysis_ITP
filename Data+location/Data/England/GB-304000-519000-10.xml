		<content> The most noticable thing about        
 industry in the area is the lack of   
 it.                                   
 QUARRYING occurs nearby, but just     
 outside our "block". There was once an
 iron ore MINE in the locality but the 
 only evidence of this today is the    
 presence of the overgrown spoil heaps.
 A RAILWAY once served these mines and 
 also provided transport for the local 
 population to visit other areas, but  
 this too is merely an overgrown relic 
 of past activity.                     
 Looking to the future,there is a      
 strong liklihood that some of the area
 will become an open cast COAL mine as 
 the N.C.B. have extensive workings in 
 adjacent areas and are presently      
 surveying parts of this area.This may 
 not be for another ten to fifteen     
 years, but it will change the         
 predominantly rural scene of today.   </content>
