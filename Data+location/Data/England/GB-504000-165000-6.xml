		<content> The railway which runs partially      
 through the d-block forms a part of   
 the commuter system of Southern Region
 into Waterloo. Originally, the line   
 belonged to the London &amp; South Western
 Railway Company. The building of the  
 railway was initially blocked by the  
 Town Elders, but by 1849 the railway  
 reached Chertsey as a branch from     
 Weybridge. The loop was completed in  
 1870 to Virginia Water joining the    
 Reading line.                         
                                       
 Today, the frequency of trains is     
 half-hourly which link to the Main    
 lines at Weybridge and Virginia Water.
 Many people using the train today     
 prefer to travel from Woking or       
 Staines to London, as the journey time
 is drastically reduced, and service   
 frequency increased.
