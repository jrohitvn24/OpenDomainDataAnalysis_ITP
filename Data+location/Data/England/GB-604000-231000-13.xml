		<content> St Mary's Church is a major tourist   
 attraction, partly because it appears 
 in many of Constable's paintings. It  
 was built in 1492 with money from the 
 Webbe and Gurdon families, wealthy    
 cloth merchants. A few months ago the 
 tower was being restored   and the    
 scaffolding spoilt tourists           
 photographs. The vicar Rev. Norman    
 Bedford came from Southwold in 1983.  
 Our school goes to special services   
 there and we sometimes hold our       
 concerts in the Church because more   
 people can attend.                    
 A Methodist Chapel near Bargate Lane  
 crossroads has services every Sunday  
 as well. The minister is Rev. D. Lang.
 The Congregational Chapel built in    
 1871 to replace an earlier Meeting    
 House of 1739, closed for worship in  
 1980 and is now the Dedham Art Centre.
