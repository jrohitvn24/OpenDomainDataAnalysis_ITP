		<content> Southwest of Leicester is mainly      
 suburban in character with a northerly
 and eastern urban fringe and a rural  
 fringe south and west.Central east is 
 residential/industrial development.The
 area is reasonably prosperous but     
 unemployment is high on the council   
 estates nearer Leicester.A variety of 
 commercial and industrial enterprises 
 are scattered throughout the area,    
 although many people travel to the    
 city and beyond for employment. North 
 and east, council housing predominates
 whilst in the Blaby and Glen Parva    
 areas, owner occupied semi-detached   
 houses are more typical. There are    
 good sports and leisure facilities    
 either within the area or very        
 accessible. The amenities of Leicester
 are close at hand.The motorway and a  
 good road system give easy access to  
 other regions of the country.         </content>
