		<title>01THE HARTSHORNE AREA</title>
		<content>   In the Hartshorne area there are    
 quite a few farms. Some of the farmers
 employ extra people. Some of the men  
 in Hartshorne work down the pits round
 this area.                            
   There are lots of fields around but 
 no housing estates. At the moment the 
 council are putting in sewage pipes.  
 They closed down one road that goes   
 down to Repton and Bretby. There are  
 only two shops in the area and they   
 are small, so people have to go to    
 Swadlincote or Burton to shop.        
   The school in Hartshorne isn't very 
 big but it is very old. There are     
 seventy-six children in the school.   
   We have a Nature Reserve called     
 Carvers Rocks, where there is a big   
 reservoir where all the water birds   
 go. There is a sort of Nature Reserve 
 at Ticknall too, called Ticknall      
 Limeyards.                            </content>
