		<title>11SLIMBRIDGE PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>      At the beginning of the Twentieth
 Century the educational needs of the  
 area were catered for by a small      
 school in nearby Cambridge.  As the   
 population of the area grew a new     
 school was built a kilometre away on  
 the outskirts of Slimbridge.          
      At present there are fifty-four  
 pupils at the school which is a       
 co-educational primary school covering
 the five to eleven age range.  The    
 region is still fairly sparsely       
 populated so the catchment area       
 extends for some eight or nine        
 kilometres and includes the           
 settlements at Berkeley and Sharpness 
 as well as the original villages of   
 Slimbridge and Cambridge.             
      Most of the pupils go on to one  
 of the large comprehensive schools    
 when they reach the age of eleven.
