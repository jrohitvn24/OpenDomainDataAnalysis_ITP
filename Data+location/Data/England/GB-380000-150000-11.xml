		<content>  In Beckington  there  is a play-group
 and a school. The  play-group ages are
 3-4 yrs. and the  school  ages are 4-9
 yrs. I go to  Beckington  school and I
 am 9. After the  holidays I will go to
 Selwood  Middle School and  after that
 to  Frome  College. A  coach takes the
 children to  Selwood  and brings  them
 back  but  when  you go to the college
 you have to go on the service bus.    
                                       
{ Beckington First School }was built in
 1852. School  starts  at 9.15 a.m. and
 finishes at 3.30  p.m. There  are  two
 classes. The  teachers  are  Mrs. T.C.
 Smith  and  Mrs. V. Johnson. I  am  in
 Mrs. Smith's class  and  I  bring  her
 flowers.    Mrs.  Leach  takes  us  on
 Thursdays because Mrs. Smith has to do
 her papers.                           
  There are 36 children in the  school.
