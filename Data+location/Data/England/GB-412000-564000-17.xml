		<title>17THE DAY OF AN 8 YEAR OLD.</title>
		<content>    Every day should be a special day  
 and a happy day.                      
    So first I get out of bed and get  
 washed and brush my teeth, comb my    
 hair and have my breakfast.           
    At about half past eight I go to   
 school where I have many friends. I do
 maths and language work and I enjoy   
 singing and working out science tasks.
    At 3 o'clock I go home and I read, 
 play with my friends and watch        
 television. At half past seven it is  
 time to get ready for bed.
