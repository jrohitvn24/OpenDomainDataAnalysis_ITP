		<content>{Mrs Tyreman}started work as the Post  
 Lady in 1943 when letters cost 1.5d to
 send.  Her round of ten miles covered 
 the village and the outlying farms as 
 far as Gormire.  She cycled and walked
 carrying the letters (over a hundred  
 each day) in a large sack on her      
 shoulder.  She wore a navy uniform    
 with a red stripe and had a hat. As   
 well as delivering letters Mrs Tyreman
 would take orders for bread and would 
 post mail for people.  She always     
 carried 30d worth of stamps with her  
 as she was not allowed to collect an  
 unstamped letter.                     
 In 1985 nine postman on a weekly rota 
 system cover the 40 mile route in a   
 small van.  They still carry stamps   
 (to the value of Â£1) and collect      
 letters from outlying farms.
