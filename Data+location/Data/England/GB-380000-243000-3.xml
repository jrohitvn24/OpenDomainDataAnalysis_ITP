		<title>03MALVERN SEWAGE WORKS</title>
		<content> Malvern Sewage Works processes about  
 two million gallons of sewage each    
 day.It is gravity fed from the Eastern
 slopes of the{Malvern Hills.}During   
 rain storms water from road drains can
 increase the flow to over six million 
 gallons and overflow systems          
 automatically divert storm water,     
 untreated , into the{Pool Brook.}The  
 process of cleaning sewage begins with
 the removal by{screens}of large,      
 hard objects such as bricks and pieces
 of wood which could damage machinery. 
 Rags and paper are passed through a   
{communuter}and the shredded and       
 squeezed residue is automatically     
 dropped into sacks for removal.Road   
 grit is also removed at this stage.   
 Finer solids settle at the bottom of  
{sedimentation tanks.}This{'sludge',   
 rich in nitrogen , is pumped into     
{sludge tanks}to be fed through presses</content>
