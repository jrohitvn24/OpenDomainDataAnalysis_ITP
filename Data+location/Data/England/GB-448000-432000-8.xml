		<content>{Events in Sherburn-Sherburn Gala.}In  
 1975 the first gala was held.On the   
 middle Saturday in May every year     
 since then there has been a gala with 
 a procession of floats.With the money 
 raised from these galas it is hoped to
 build a leisure centre either on      
 Eversley Park or behind the Forester's
 pub.Many societies and clubs enter the
 float competition.Our school's entry  
 this year being the Black and White   
 Minstrels.At 1pm.the procession of    
 decorative floats,marching bands and  
 other vehicles set off through the    
 village where people line the         
 streets,waving to it as it passes.The 
 procession leads into Eversley Park   
 and then the gala is opened by the    
 reigning gala queen.There are stalls  
 round the edge of the field with an   
 arena in the middle where larger      
 events and displays take place.       </content>
