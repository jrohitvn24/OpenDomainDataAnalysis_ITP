		<title>16The School Fifty Years Ago</title>
		<content> In 1935 the majority of the children  
 who left school at the age of fourteen
 went into work in service or on the   
 land.However,only a very small        
 proportion went to work professionally
 or in clerical work,other wise people 
 went on to a variety of occupations   
 such as van delivery,farm             
 work,gardening,teaching and carpentry.
 During the early part of the Autumn   
 term,the older children spent a week  
 picking hops or harvesting potatoes.  
 Gardening and basketry were two major 
 items in the curriculum.The school    
 then had two large classes,taught by  
 the headmaster and an assistant       
 teacher.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
