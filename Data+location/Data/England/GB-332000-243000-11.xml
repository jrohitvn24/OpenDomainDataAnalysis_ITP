		<content> The Women's Institute is the only     
 'Club' meeting regularly in the area. 
 It was formed 62 years ago but has    
 only 20 members - hardly surprising in
 view of the low population. However it
 is invaluable as a link between       
 villagers and although small is a very
 lively and friendly institution.      
 Another organisation is the Wyeside   
 Community Project Group, set up under 
 the Community Development Scheme of   
 the County Council. This concerns     
 itself with initiating and promoting  
 community efforts; an example is the  
 recent production of a local Services 
 Directory.                            
 There is no longer any Playgroup or   
 Youth Club. Young people have to go   
 out of the area for these.
