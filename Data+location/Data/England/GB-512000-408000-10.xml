		<title>10TRAFFIC IN OUR VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Up until 1984 there have been quite a 
 number of road accidents on the A18   
 which passes through the village. This
 was due to the very bad bends in the  
 road. In the past we sometimes carried
 out a traffic survey and it was quite 
 difficult to keep a record as there   
 was so much traffic on the road.      
 The new motorway to Grimsby was opened
 in 1983 and much of the traffic now   
 uses that routeway. The village has   
 now become much quieter so much so    
 that it is no longer possible to carry
 out a traffic survey due to absence of
 vehicles.                             
 The effect on local trade as a result 
 must be considerable. The New Inn, the
 only pub in the village must have felt
 the effects of the new routeway quite 
 considerably as it relied to a large  
 extent on the passing trade. The      
 residents think it a blessing.        </content>
