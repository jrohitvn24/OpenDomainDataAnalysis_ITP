		<title>20OTHER FARMS,DUNTISBOURNE</title>
		<content> There are fewer farms today than 100  
 years ago.Some have merged and are run
 as one unit:Cotswold and Rectory      
 Farms,Voxhills and Dartley Farms.     
 Others have sold off land and their   
 farmhouses are purely residential,    
 such as Nutbeam and Church farms. The 
 Cotswold Hills have traditionally been
 seen as sheep rearing areas but today 
 the farmers here are concentrating on 
 other animals and crops.Variety and   
 flexibility are the keywords at the   
 moment in farming.
