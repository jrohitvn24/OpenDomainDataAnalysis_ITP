		<title>17FAMILY LIFE IN 1985</title>
		<content>   In 1985 family life is very         
 different from family life say a      
 hundred years ago .The average  family
 nowadays has a television and in the  
 majority of families that television  
 is coloured.Most families also have a 
 car. It is most unusual for someone   
 not to have a telephone. A very high  
 percentage of people in Britain own   
 their own home.Others rent them from  
 the council or private business's but 
 very few are actually homeless        
   Food is nearly always obtainable.   
 There are no droughts or famines and  
 no family could really said to be     
 starving as in other countries. There 
 is a great deal of inequality in      
 Britain in 1985 though.Some people are
 with well paid, important jobs have   
 much more money than they need.They   
 spend great amounts of money on       
 thingswhich are far from necessary    </content>
