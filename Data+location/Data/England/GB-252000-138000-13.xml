		<content>    50 years ago our school catered for
 everyone in this block and they spent 
 all their school days here from 5_14. 
 They walked to school from their      
 houses.                               
    There wasn't any electricity and   
 the school was heated by coal fires   
 with guards around them.              
    The headmaster Mr.Pill had a very  
 tall desk which he could stand at and 
 the children had sloping desks.They   
 wrote with dip pens.                  
    The children brought their own     
 dinners to school and ate them in the 
 classroom.The teachers were very      
 strict and children got the cane if   
 they were naughty.                    
    There were'nt any school trips,    
 outings or  school plays like we have 
 today.If they were lucky they had a   
 chapter of Charles Dickens' novel     
 a "Christmas Carol".                  </content>
