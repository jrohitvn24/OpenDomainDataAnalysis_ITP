		<content> During the war the present Industrial 
 Estate was owned by the War           
 Agricultural Committee.There is an    
 aircraft hangar still there being used
 by one of the companies.The village   
 hall used to have a stable under      
 it.There were steps up to it.The floor
 was much higher than now.In 1926 the  
 floor was lowered so there are no     
 stables there now.This is why the     
 windows are so high.Children had to   
 walk to school.There were no          
 wellington boots like there are       
 now.During the war Condover Hall was  
 occupied by the Auxiliary Territorial 
 Service.After the war it was sold to  
 the Royal National Institute for the  
 Blind.They still own it and it is now 
 a school for the blind.
