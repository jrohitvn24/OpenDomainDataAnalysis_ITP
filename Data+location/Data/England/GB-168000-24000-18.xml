 a tourist attraction.It has five      
 pools,each holding three to seven     
 seals.There is two hospital pools.The 
 first hospital pool holds baby seals  
 of four to six months.These seals have
 just been brought down from the       
 hospital.The second hospital pool     
 holds older seals,that are hopefully  
 going to be put back into the sea     
 soon.The first hospital holds three   
 seals,the second holds six.The weaning
 pool holds seals aged about           
 twelve.This pool holds seven seals.The
 isolation pool holds five seals.The   
 resident pool holds four seals.The    
 Gweek Seal Sanctuary was opened in    
 1958/59.There is a hospital near the  
 car park,for badly injured seals.The  
 sanctuary is run by Mr and Mrs Jones.
