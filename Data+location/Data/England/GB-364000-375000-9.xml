		<content> There is a Durafencing factory in     
 Anderton, near Northwich, which       
 specializes in the manufacture of     
 concrete fencing posts, although they 
 also make concrete panels and lintels.
 Their products are despatched all over
 the U.K. The firm was founded 7 years 
 ago by Mr. C.P. Baldwin and this      
 factory is now one of several         
 throughout Britain, with an H.Q. in   
 Manchester. The Anderton factory      
 occupies 17,000 sq. ft. and employs 26
 people. However, business is good at  
 present and should be expanding in the
 near future. In fact some of the other
 plants are now making steel objects.  
 Durafencing sell direct to builders,  
 not to the general public. They       
 advertise a lot in local papers and   
 trade magazines. The factory works    
 from Monday to Friday but not at the  
 weekend.                              </content>
