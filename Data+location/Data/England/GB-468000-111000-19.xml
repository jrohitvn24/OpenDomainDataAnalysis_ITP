		<title>19FARMING NEAR COWPLAIN</title>
		<content> Around the edge of the built up area  
 of our Block farming is an important  
 activity, particularly nr Horndean.   
 There is a mixture of land use.Herds  
 of dairy and beef cattle are found and
 flocks of sheep occur on the Padnell  
 Estate.Pyle Farm grows wheat for      
 flour, barley for malt and oats for   
 breakfast cereals.Hook Cottage has an 
 interesting private animal collection.
 One farmer said he liked his work in  
 earlier times when there was a greater
 variety of work on each farm. Modern  
 machinery has replaced labourers      
 because it is more efficient.Nr Wecock
 some farmland has been sold for more  
 housing and in general farmland close 
 to housing estates remains as rough   
 grassland and is little used.Patches  
 of mixed woodland owned by the        
 Forestry Commission, particularly to  
 the east completes the scene.         </content>
