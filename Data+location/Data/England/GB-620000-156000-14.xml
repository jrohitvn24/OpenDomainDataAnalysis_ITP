		<title>14Ecology Littlebourne Area</title>
		<content> The area has an active conservation   
 Society whixh tries to preserve the   
 rural character. A continuing concern 
 is the extraction of water from the   
 river + bore holes affecting its flow.
 Gravel extraction is also a problem. A
 local guide has been produced for     
 W'breux and 2 local history booklets  
 for L'bourne. Trees have been planted 
 in all the villages + on Howletts Car 
 Park + the lime trees pleached in     
 W'breux. There is a continuing        
 interest in listed buildings +        
 conservation Areas + planning         
 applications concerning them. Films + 
 footpath walks are organised + litter 
 sweeps to clear rubbish from the      
 country lanes. The footpaths are of 2 
 types, the inland footpaths joining   
 parts of the village + the outland    
 footpaths to the small settlements    
 e.g.Garrington, Woolton, Swanton.     </content>
