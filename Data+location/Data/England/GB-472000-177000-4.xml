 In earlier times the scene would have 
been more romantic, with the towers and
bulk of Reading Abbey in place of the  
gasometers, and the hall and gatehouse 
of the Bishop of Sarum's manor house   
showing on the hill above Sonning      
Church, the whole panorama backed by   
the seemingly impenetrable and         
limitless timber belt of Windsor Forest
and its adjoining woodlands. In places 
the chalk comes to the surface, but at 
other levels it is capped with gravels 
and London clay, often to a            
considerable depth where there are     
underlying folds - a complicating      
factor in the problem of waste water   
and sewage disposal with which many    
householders have found difficulty in  
coping.
