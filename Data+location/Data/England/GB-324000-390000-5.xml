		<title>05   LEASOWE CASTLE HOTEL</title>
		<content> Leasowe Castle was built in 1593 by   
 Ferdinando, the Fifth Earl of Derby.  
  There were 3 probable reasons for it 
 being built:-                         
  1) To watch the horse races on       
     Leasowe Racecourse.               
  2) Being built on a plain it was     
     possible to observe bird life.    
  3) Ferdinando was able to hide from  
     his enemies.                      
  Nowadays, Leasowe Castle has changed 
 greatly from it's early days.  It has 
 been developed as an{hotel/conference 
{centre}with 100% of the trade being   
 businessmen.

 dining rooms,a ballroom,4 bars and
