		<content>{POSTAL SERVICES}- During our survey we
 noticed that we could not find many   
 post offices, only one in{Quakers Rd} 
 Downend and one in Winterbourne Down. 
 There are several post boxes dotted   
 around the area. People post letters  
 in these. Letters are sorted in the   
 main sorting office in Bristol.       
{TELEPHONE SERVICES}- Around the area  
 there were several telephone boxes,   
 used to communicate with other people.
 Many people have telephones in their  
 homes and quite a lot of households   
 have two and sometimes more.          
{TELEVISION}- This is another way of   
 communicating and we saw lots of      
 aerials attached to houses. When we   
 asked people how many televisions thay
 had in their houses most had at least 
 two. They had one in their lounge and 
 often one in the bedroom.
