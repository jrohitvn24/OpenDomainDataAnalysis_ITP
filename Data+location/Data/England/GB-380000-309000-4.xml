		<title>04BOSCOBEL HOUSE</title>
		<content> This historic house, now owned and    
 administered by the English Heritage  
 Trust, was once only a working farm.  
 However, the family who owned it in   
 1642, when the Civil War began, were  
 Roman Catholics, the Giffards.  They  
 identified with the cause of Charles 1
 and the house was the scene of several
 skirmishes.                           
 It became nationally famous in 1662   
 when Charles II escaping from the     
 Battle of Worcester, hid in the       
 surrounding Oak forest, and later     
 sheltered in the house.  Since then,  
 every owner allowed visitors to look  
 at the tree.  In the late nineteenth  
 century the house began to be opened  
 to the public.  Now it is open all    
 year round, and attracts visitors from
 all over the world.
