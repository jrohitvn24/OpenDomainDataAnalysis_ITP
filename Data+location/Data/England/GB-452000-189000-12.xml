		<title>12THE GREAT WESTERN SOCIETY</title>
		<content>This year, 1985, the 150th anniversary 
of the Great Western Railway is being  
celebrated. The Great Western Society, 
which is run by its members, is        
organising many activities this year,  
including Â£steaming days', when the    
public may travel in coaches pulled by 
steam engines which have been magnific-
ently restored by the members          
themselves. The original GWR station   
was burnt down and its roof destroyed. 
Now Frome is the only GWR station which
still has its original covered roof.   
The Great Western Society moved into   
the sheds in 1965. Many members spend  
their free time renovating the engines,
waggons and coaches.  Near the sheds   
are two shops, a museum and a stall.   
The whole area around the sheds is an  
attractive and interesting place in    
which to spend a day.  It is open most 
weekends and Bank Holidays.            </content>
