		<content> The Land's End can be viewed in two   
 different ways.Seen by the landsman it
 is usually thought of as the romantic 
 westernmost tip of Britain, with beau-
 tiful views across the Longships Light
 house to the wide Atlantic. To the    
 sailor, however,it means one of the   
 most dangerous landfalls in the world.
 Countless ships have found a watery   
 grave amongst the hidden reefs,       
 confused currents and treacherous     
 tides of this area.The shipwreck which
 most emphasised the need for a life   
 boat at Sennen was that of the "New   
 Commercial" in 1851.During a lengthy, 
 difficult and heroic rescue three of  
 the ten people were rescued by the com
 bined efforts of several groups, most 
 notably the men and boats of Sennen.  
 As a direct result of this operation  
 the first Sennen lifeboat was deliver-
 ed to the village in June,1853.       </content>
