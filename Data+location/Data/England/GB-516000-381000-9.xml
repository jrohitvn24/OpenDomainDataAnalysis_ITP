		<title>09PIG FARM,  EAST BARKWITH</title>
		<content>   In {East Barkwith}there is a small- 
 holding of about 3 acres which        
 specialises in rearing{pigs.}They have
 30 sows in the sow-house. Ten sows at 
 a time go into the farrowing house,   
 where they have the piglets. There are
 heaters in here, which attract the    
 piglets so they don't get squashed by 
 the sow. The piglets have to be       
 injected with iron, and have their    
 teeth clipped so they don't tear the  
 sow's teats. After 3 weeks the piglets
 are moved to a weaning pool, 30 or 40 
 piglets in each one. Later they are   
 moved to the fattening house until    
 they are about 6 months old, when they
 are killed for bacon. They have       
 carefully measured feeds to produce   
 lean meat. Sows produce 4 or 5        
 litters, of about 12 piglets each,    
 they are then sold for sausages. There
 are two boars to serve the sows.      </content>
