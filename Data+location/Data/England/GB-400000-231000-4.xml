		<content>   Home Farm House was built in        
 approximately 1725 of local Cotswold  
 stone. It is a family farm worked with
 the help of 3 full-time labourers. The
 land extends beyond our square by some
 200 acres given over to cereals and   
 root crops. The rest of the land is   
 intensively managed grassland which   
 supports 250 cows which produce 6000  
 litres of milk per year per cow.      
   The labourers live in cottages on   
 the main farm complex. The cowman     
 works from 4.45 am to 6.15 pm seven   
 days per week. The other workers work 
 from 7.30 am to 5.30 pm with seasonal 
 variations.                           
   The farm has 5 tractors, a forklift 
 truck, bailer, fertilizer spreader,   
 plough, cultivator and silage making  
 equipment. There are no working       
 animals but 3 hunters are kept.
