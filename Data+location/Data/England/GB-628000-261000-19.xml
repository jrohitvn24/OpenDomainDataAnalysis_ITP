This item is written by Michelle who   
is 10 years old. Her father is a       
butcher in the town of Framlingham.    
                                       
Mum gets up at 6.45 in the             
morning,gets dressed, gets me up and   
off to school. She does the housework  
but if some-one is away she helps my   
dad in the shop. She gets my dinner    
ready and then she washes up. She has  
her own dinner. She is always washing  
clothes and things. She may watch T.V. 
for a little while. She goes to the    
International shop for bits and bobs   
and to the greengrocer, but on Friday  
she goes to the Co-op. When she has    
finished that she will make everyone's 
tea. She will either take the dogs for 
a walk or have a game of ball, then    
she will get me to bed.
