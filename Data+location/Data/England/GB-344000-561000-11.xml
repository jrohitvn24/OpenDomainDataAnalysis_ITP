		<content>{Whitrigg Farmhouse}was built in 1702  
 and there was a Roman fort in the     
 field to the left of the farm         
 drive. Hadrian's Wall runs through the
 field and the owner, Mr. Hardy is not 
 allowed to plough it because of the   
 remains beneath the ground.           
 In the Middle Ages the land was owned 
 by monks who put up buildings         
 including a dove cote opposite the    
 farmhouse.                            
 To the east of Whitrigg Farm, the line
 of Hadrian's Wall can be followed     
 first as a minor road, then a track   
 and finally a footpath before reaching
 Oldwall. A hedge marks much of the    
 way, but the only other sign to be    
 seen is the depression to the nortn   
 which is the ditch first dug by the   
 Romans.
