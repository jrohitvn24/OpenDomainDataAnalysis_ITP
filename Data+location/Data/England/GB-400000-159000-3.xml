		<title>03DEVIZES,A GARRISON TOWN.</title>
		<content> Devizes became a Garrison Town in     
 1873 and 5 years later,the Wiltshire  
 Regiment adopted the Town as its base.
 The Regimental Museum was formed into 
 a trust in 1963 and its collection    
 stored at Le Marchant Barracks.       
 It includes items from many Army units
 and also the two V.C's won by the     
 Regiment.                             
 The Army has forged many happy links  
 with the townspeople of Devizes,and   
 until 1959,St James' served as the    
 Garrison Church.The old hutted army   
 camps were formed into two barracks   
 named after Hopton and Prince Maurice,
 although the former is now a trading  
 estate.                               
 The Royal Army Ordnance Corps were the
 last regiment to serve in Devizes and 
 they left in 1983,but the town still  
 retains its military links having a   
 T.A.Unit and a Cadet Force.           </content>
