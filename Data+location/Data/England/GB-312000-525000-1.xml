		<content>  This is a completely rural area. To  
 the south the land is high, the lower 
 slopes of the mountains of Cumbria.   
 The land slopes steeply down to past- 
 ures.The river Cocker flows through   
 these fields. The area lies just      
 within the western boundary of the    
 Lake district national park.  It is   
 beautiful and unspoiled development is
 strictly controlled by the L D S P B. 
 The main industry is farming-cattle &amp; 
 sheep and milk production. Some people
 provide accommodation for tourists-   
 bed and breakfast 1 hotel, 1 public   
 house, 2 caravan sites and the letting
 of holiday cottages. This block       
 contains details of church &amp; SCHOOL   
 but it is an account of part of a     
 community. The village of High Lorton 
 is described in the adjacent block.
