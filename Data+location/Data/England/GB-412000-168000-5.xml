		<content> This ruined{longbarrow}was built in   
 megalithic times. It is said that it  
 was deliberately constructed so that  
 at sunset the stones lined up with a  
 former sacred place and that at one   
 time there was a crescent shaped      
 forecourt.                            
 Five stones make up the entrance,     
 which lies between east and           
 south south_east.                     
 A ring of broad stones stood half a   
 mile to the south. This unfortunately 
 was destroyed in the 1880's. The fact 
 that these monuments were built so    
 close together suggests that they were
 all part of the same plan. The        
 surrounding land has indeed remained  
 unchanged for many centuries.
