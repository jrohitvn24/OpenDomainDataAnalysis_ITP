		<content>   The population of Crawford village  
 is mainly retired folk and in their   
leisure time they have bingo and       
dominoes which are played in the       
village pavilion. This wooden building 
was built and put up by the villagers  
themselves. There is also a Derby and  
Joan Club who arrange trips.           
   People go to the Weslyan Chapel and 
others to the Mission but attendance   
has fallen as the older people die.    
   The Crawford Arms public house plays
an important part in the life of the   
community.                             
   Until recent years the village had a
football team.                         
   The Villagers raised 400 pounds to  
provide swings, a roundabout and slide 
for a childrens play park.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
