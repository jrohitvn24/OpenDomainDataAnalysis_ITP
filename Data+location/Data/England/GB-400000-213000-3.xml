		<content>   The Church yard which was surveyed  
 in 1984 by members of the Withington  
 Women's Institute,contains over three 
 hundred memorials ranging from simple 
 stone vase to large table tombs. An   
 interesting inscription was found on a
 grave to "Honest John Stockwell" who  
 died of the{plague in 1665.}          
   The earliest part of the church was 
 built in 1150. Interesting features   
 are:                                  
  {Five mass dials}which have survived 
 since mediaeval times on the south    
 wall of the church.They were used to  
 tell villagers the times of services. 
   There are{two Norman doorways}on the
 south and north sides of the Church.  
 The south doorway which is protected  
 by a porch is a beautiful example of  
 Norman work.                          
   Most valuable items of church plate 
 are held in the cathedral treasury.   </content>
