		<title>20A Future for Horsted Keynes</title>
		<content>   What do we want for the future?     
   We have tried to find out how the   
 people in the village would like to   
 see Horsted Keynes change in the years
 to come.                              
   The youngest schoolchildren want to 
 see better playing facilities such as 
 improvements to the recreation ground,
 more slides and swings and a zoo.     
   Older children see a need for a     
 greater variety of shops and clubs.   
 They would like a swimming pool and an
 adventure playground. Some find the   
 village "not very exciting"; others   
 like it as it is and do not want it to
 grow, change and become "spoilt".     
   Adults too have mixed feelings about
 the village's future. Most do not want
 it to grow much more. They would like 
 improved facilities such as the bus   
 service, a mains gas supply and a     
 wider range of shops and clubs.       </content>
