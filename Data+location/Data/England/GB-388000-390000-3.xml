		<title>03NELSTROP'S FLOUR MILL</title>
		<content> The first Albion Mill in Heaton Norris
 was built in 1820 by William Nelstrop.
 In 1893 disaster struck. A great fire 
 burnt the mill to ashes. A year later 
 the present mill was built.           
                                       
 Nelstrops use wheat fron East Anglia, 
 Manitoba wheat from Canada and Spring 
 wheat fron USA.                       
                                       
 The imported wheat is discharged from 
 wheat tankers into large grain silos  
 at Seaforth docks, Liverpool. It is   
 then bought to Stockport in 20 tonne  
 bulk wheat lorries. In a typical week 
 1600 tonnes is brought into the mill. 
                                       
 The different wheats are blended in   
 varying proportions to provide 40     
 types of flour.The flour is sold to   
 family bakers and supermarkets and    
 exported to Nigeria,Egypt and Jordan. </content>
