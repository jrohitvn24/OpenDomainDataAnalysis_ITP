  Most people have lived in this area  
 for over 20 years but some have moved 
 in a couple of years ago.Everybody we 
 questioned apart from two people were 
 born in this are.One of the two people
 moved into this area because of there 
 work and the other person moved to    
 their parents.Most houses are owner   
 occupied.There are no tenants at all. 
 Everybody wanted to stay in this area 
 apart from one person.The houses are  
 in very good condition,apart from some
 terraced houses.
