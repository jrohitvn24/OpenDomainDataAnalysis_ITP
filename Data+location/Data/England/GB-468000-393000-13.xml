		<title>13SHOPPING IN MISSON</title>
		<content> In Misson my parents own a shop called
 central stores.The shop has a house   
 joined to it and we sell a variety    
 of things for example                 
 groceries,wool,knitting needles,dog   
 food ETC.We open at 9 am until 1 pm   
 when we have our dinner hour.The shop 
 re opens at 2pm until 6pm.The Post    
 Office also has a shop attached to it 
 and sells a variety of things like    
 groceries,sweets,toys and             
 vegatables.The person who owns the    
 Post Office has owned the shop for 15 
 years.He says he enjoys his job       
 because he meets a lot of people.His  
 toys and fancy goods sell very        
 well.The busiest day in the Post      
 Office is Thursdays because of the    
 older people going to draw out there  
 pension.
