		<title>08Birthday parties.</title>
		<content> Birthday parties are held in your     
 house or in the village hall.First    
 everyone plays games like Pass the    
 Parcel,or Musical Bumps.In Pass the   
 Parcel a prize is wrapped in many     
 layers of paper.Children sit in a     
 cicle and music is played.When the    
 music stops the person holding the    
 parcel unwraps it.The game continues  
 until someone takes off the last layer
 and wins the prize.In Musical         
 Bumps,people dance to music and when  
 it stops everyone must sit on the     
 floor the last down is out.When the   
 games are over everyone eats.Usually  
 there are sandwiches, crisps,         
 sausages, cakes, jellies and ice      
 cream.Sometimes instead of parties    
 small groups of friends go to a cafe  
 for a meal or go swimming or roller   
 skating.
