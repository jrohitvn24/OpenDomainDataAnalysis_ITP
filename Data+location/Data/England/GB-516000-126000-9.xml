 what sports we do in our spare        
 time. There are twenty three children 
 in our class and most of us live in   
 the countryside and a few of us live  
 in the town. Here are our results:-

{dancing}1,{BMX}3,{horse riding}4,     
{tennis}1,{badmington}1,{table tennis

{racing}1,.There are quite alot of     
 clubs around here so some people go to
 them. In the{rugby}season Leighton    
 plays rugby for Horsham on Sunday and 
 on Saturdays Leighton and I play
