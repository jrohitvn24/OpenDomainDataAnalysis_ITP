		<content> The climate is warm and damp due to   
 the prevailing west wind. The area is 
 mostly 600 to 700 feet above sea level
 and exposed to the wind, but suffers  
 little from frost and snow. The soil  
 is not rich therefore the area lends  
 itself more to animal husbandry than  
 arable farming. The underlying soil is
 clay making drainage a problem for    
 most of the year and many acres have  
 to be drained before they are viable. 
 Undulating ground makes tractor work  
 hazardous and sometimes even          
 impossible. There are areas of        
 woodland both coniferous and          
 deciduous. Some trees have been felled
 to create more valuable grassland, but
 some landowners have planted many     
 hardwood trees resulting in a         
 noticeable increase in bird types and 
 numbers.
