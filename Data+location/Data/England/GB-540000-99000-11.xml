		<content> LIFE STYLES - D.I.Y                   
 Mr. Fixit D.I.Y. is open from 9.00    
 a.m. until 8.00 p.m.  There are 20,000
 items which range from a screw to a   
 complete kitchen, but all those do not
 include the things that can be bought 
 in the garden centre.  The whole place
 itself was built two years ago and has
 thirty-six staff who all have to be   
 sixteen or over.  With a weekly       
 turnover of Â£25,000 the store plays an
 important part in the hobby life of   
 the area.  A very common occupation   
 for the whole area is do-it-yourself  
 which ranges from decorating a room to
 complex repair and renovation.
