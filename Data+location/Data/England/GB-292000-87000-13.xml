		<title>13Countess Wear Estate</title>
		<content> Although much of the estate was built 
 within a few years in the 1950's there
 is a surprising amount of diversity in
 both style and materials used.        
 The majority of the homes were two    
 storey houses of family size. Most of 
 them (about 270) were semi-detached.  
 There were some flats (about 100)     
 which were smaller. There were a few  
 bungalows mainly built for the older  
 people of the community.              
 Building materials varied. The most   
 popular was red brick, but there were 
 also some rendered houses (about 70). 
 Some units were obviously erected     
 swiftly after the war as they were    
 pre-fabricated - made from concrete   
 panels and either hung with tiles or  
 tin sheeting on the upper floor.      
 Most of the homes have gardens, many  
 are now privately owned.
