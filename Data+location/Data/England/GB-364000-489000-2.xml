		<content>      George Fox, the founder of the   
 Quaker movement, came to Brigflatts, a
 hamlet of flax weavers on the banks of
 the river Rawthey, in 1652 after      
 travelling through the Dales preaching
 in many of the villages. On nearby    
 Firbank Fell George Fox preached a    
 famous sermon at the spot now known as
 "Fox's Pulpit".  An inscription reads:
        {LET YOUR LIVES SPEAK.         
{HERE OR NEAR THIS ROCK GEORGE FOX     
{PREACHED TO ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SEEKERS
{FOR THREE HOURS ON SUNDAY JUNE 13 1652
      On the nearest Sunday to this    
 date every year a service is held in  
 commemoration of this event.          
      The Brigflatts Meeting House was 
 built in 1675 and is open all year    
 round for visitors.  Last year 2,000  
 people signed the visitors' book.
