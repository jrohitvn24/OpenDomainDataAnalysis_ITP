		<title>01River Laver Valley &amp; Hills</title>
		<content> This is a country area typical of many
 such areas in Yorkshire.  It includes 
 one small village, Laverton which     
 serves mainly as a focal point for    
 roads meeting and passing through to  
 the larger surrounding villages.  It  
 has no amenities other than a public  
 telephone.  Most of the land in this  
 area is now farmed, but is only good  
 enough for grazing, mostly sheep, as  
 it is reclaimed moorland.  The river  
 Lamer meanders through the centre of  
 this area, amply supplied from the    
 surrounding hills.  It runs through a 
 steep sided valley at one end onto the
 flat, low area in which the village is
 found.  The south of the area is still
 marshland.  Centrally there is a large
 coniferous plantation and several     
 smaller ones - both coniferous and    
 deciduous.  It has a good road network
 serving all the hillside farms.       </content>
