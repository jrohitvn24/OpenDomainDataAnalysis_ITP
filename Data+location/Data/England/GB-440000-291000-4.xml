		<content> THE LIBRARY                           
  From 1888 until 1975 the library was 
 situated on Station Rd. Although that 
 building is still there, the new      
 library was opened in Lancaster Rd in 
 1975.The new library offers reference 
 and lending services for children and 
 adults,a sound recording loan service,
 a tourist information centre, and a   
 photocopier. The citizens advice      
 bureau also operates in the building. 
  The Plessey computerised issue system
 was introduced in 1978 being the first
 public library in Leicestershire to go
 live.All the books in Leicestershire  
 libraries are catalogued on microfiche
 and can be ordered in Hinckley.       
  There are about 80 000 volumes in    
 Hinckley, of which about 20 000 are on
 loan at one time.
