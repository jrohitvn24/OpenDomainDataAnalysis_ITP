  The passengers have to pay the same  
 as a normal Bus Service would charge. 
 Part of the cost of running the bus is
 subsidised by the council. It runs 5  
 days a week at collection times, all  
 year round.As it is used by roughly   
 the same people each week, the drivers
 get to know who uses it, and so can   
 pick them up, however it can be waved 
 down. When the bus breaks down, or has
 an accident, it is replaced by a      
 spare, shared between Petworth and    
 Petersfield. The Post Bus provides a  
 vital service to the community; it    
 will last as long as it is required.
