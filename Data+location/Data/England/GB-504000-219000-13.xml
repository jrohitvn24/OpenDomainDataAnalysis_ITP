		<title>13EDUCATION SCHOOL SUBJECTS</title>
		<content>I think one of the important things    
about Farley Hill is the schools,      
because they are for learning and to   
help get jobs easier. Some hate school 
some think they are missing fun at     
home. The subjects at Rotheram High    
include Maths and English which are    
very important.  Geography and History 
are sometimes taught separately and    
sometimes together as Humanities. For  
children from Junior schools some      
subjects are new eg.Science which has  
laboratories.  Craft also has special  
rooms woodwork is taught as well as    
sewing. Cooking is a favourite with    
many Art another. Many find French     
interesting and look to the time when  
they visit France and are not scared to
speak. RE and Social Education are     
taught and Pastoral time is spent with 
the form teacher. Computer Studies is  
new, PE and games are for health.      </content>
