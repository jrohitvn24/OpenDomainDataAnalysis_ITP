		<content>   There are many things to do in      
 Canterbury. One could visit the 986   
 seater Marlowe{Theatre}for Â£3 - Â£4.50 
 and watch a veriety of things,        
 including opera, ballet, plays and    
 comedies.                             
   Smaller, but more intimate, is the  
 Gulbenkian Theatre which is at the    
{University.}It has 300 seats, costing 
 only Â£1.50 for adults. Performed here 
 are mainly amateur productions and    
{concerts}of classical music.          
   Then there is the ABC{cinema}which  
 shows films ranging from adult films  
 to cartoons. There are children's     
 films in the holiday and films for    
 teenagers and adults in the week. If  
 you take your child after 6 pm you    
 only have to pay the child's price.   
 You can see more unusual films at the 
 University Film Theatre.
