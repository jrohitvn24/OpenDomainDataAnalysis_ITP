		<title>16Housing in Epworth.</title>
		<content>   Epworth has been expanding steadily 
 since The Second World War and we now 
 have three quite large housing        
 estates.                              
    A problem has recently arisen      
 because virtually all of the land now 
 needed for further development around 
 the village is good quality           
 agricultural land.It is difficult to  
 decide whether farmland should be     
 built on or left to produce food on   
 which we depend.                      
    Recently most new houses have been 
 built in gaps between existing built  
 up areas but such spaces are becoming 
 rare.One solution would be to prevent 
 any further development from occuring 
 but this is not easy because Epworth  
 is such a popular place and a lot of  
 people do want to come here to live.
