		<title>13HOUSES IN HAYFIELD</title>
		<content> In our square of six km,there are     
 a lot of farms,most of them dated     
 about 1820. Most of the farms are     
 situated on moorland because the      
 majority of farmers breed sheep, and  
 the sheep thrive well on moorland.Most
 of the houses are built in the actual 
 village of Hayfield or in the village 
 of Little Hayfield.There are three    
 public houses in the area.One is in   
 Birch Vale,one in Hayfield and one in 
 Little Hayfield.Most of the public    
 houses are built in the community     
 because if they were built in isolated
 areas no one would go there.There are 
 a lot of terraced houses in the area  
 because a lot of mill owners built    
 them,terraced house being cheapest to 
 build and they were mainly built in   
 the late 19th century.The oldest      
 houses are terraced houses but the new
 ones are detached or semi-detached.   </content>
