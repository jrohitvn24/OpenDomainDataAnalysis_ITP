		<title>11 - ECOLOGY AND LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> The area is still very rural and there
 is a wide variation in flora and      
 fauna.                                
                                       
 The three ponds, Chingford, Burton,   
 and Black, all have resident and      
 visiting birdlife including swans,    
 geese and ducks, and dragon flies are 
 also a frequent occurence.            
                                       
 Alders are the most common tree in the
 wetter areas, whereas to the south the
 heathland has many silver birches and 
 a lot of bracken. Burton Park contains
 many fine trees including sweet       
 chestnuts now past their prime,       
 planted by former owners.             
                                       
 There are two small nature reserves in
 the area, and it is home for a large  
 rabbit population. Deer are frequently
 seen as well.                         </content>
