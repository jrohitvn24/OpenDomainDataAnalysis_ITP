		<title>01THURLASTON AREA</title>
		<content>Thurlaston,in Warwickshire,is situated 
on the edge of Dunsmore Heath,350 feet 
above sea level.To the south are       
delightful views of Draycote Water.412 
people live there.The village has      
changed,almost all the farmland was    
taken for the reservoir.The M45 passes 
through the area,making it a useful    
commuter base.Local schools are in     
Dunchurch and Rugby.                   
It is a peaceful village apart from the
hum of the motorway.The people seem    
friendly.Many are older.The Post Office
is the only shop.A windmill is         
visible,as is the 19th century Church. 
The area around is mainly farmland and 
residential.It is better to have a car 
as public transport is limited.The     
nearest hamlets are Toft and Cawston.
