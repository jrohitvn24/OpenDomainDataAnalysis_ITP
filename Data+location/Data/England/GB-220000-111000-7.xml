		<content> A  rural area  and ideal for energetic
 hikers naturalists and those who enjoy
 to ramble in rugged countryside. There
 are no  campsites but  some farms  and
 houses welcome visitors and offer good
 accommodation.  The National Trust has
 holiday chalets  at  Coombe Mill  in a
 pretty wooded valley with nature trail
 footpaths maintained by  the  Cornwall
 Naturalist Trust.  The coombe  ends at
 Duckpool beach bounded by high cliffs.
                                       
 North Cornwall Cars provide a shopping
 bus two days a week to Holsworthy  and
 Bude,but personal transport is a must.
 Respect for the land and a  reluctance
 to change has helped to keep this area
 so natural. A notable recent exception
 being the signals  station  whose dish
 aerials dominate  the  skyline and are
 of added  interest  to the  scientific
 minded tourist.                       </content>
