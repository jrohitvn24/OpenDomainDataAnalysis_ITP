		<content>   The main types of housing in our    
 block are,privately owned old houses, 
 privately owned modern houses and     
 council houses.Apart from in Uley the 
 houses are not densely built together.
 The most common kind of house is the  
 privately owned older property.Some of
 these old houses were once linked with
 the now collapsed woollen industry.   
   The modern houses range from 1 to 20
 years old.Most of the council houses  
 were built around 1947 and are        
 situated in the bottom half of Uley.  
   There are two pubs in Uley.There is 
 also a village hall which was built   
 in 1912 and recently extended.The     
 church was built in 1856.There were   
 two chapels in Uley,one now sells     
 antiques and the other is an arts     
 centre.There are no large housing     
 estates in our area.
