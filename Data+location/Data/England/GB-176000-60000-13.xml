		<title>13VISITORS TO THE NEWQUAY AREA</title>
		<content> The{tourist trade}is very important to
 the area.  Tourists stay in hotels,   
 self catering flats and campsites.    
 The Pentire headland has a large      
 number of hotels, flats and guest     
 houses.  West Pentire has a smaller   
 number.  There are 3 campsites in the 
 Crantock area, a large caravan park   
 and over 3000 people can stay on      
 Pentire each week in the summer.  Most
 of the hotels close from October to   
 April.  We looked at an hotel, a      
 caravan and camp site. {The Bay Hotel}
 was established in 1908 when it was   
 just 2 joined houses and was the only 
 hotel in Pentire.  Two-thirds of the  
 visitors come by coach. {Beacon Park} 
 is for caravans.  Each caravan is     
 really a small, temporary home which  
 is fully equipped and very comfort-   
 able. The{Camp Site}is mainly for the 
 use of people with canvas tents.      </content>
