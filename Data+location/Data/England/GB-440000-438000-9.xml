 This area is a mixture of farmland and
 woodland, with the A1 trunk road      
 crossing it North to South. The       
 woodland covers the East section and  
 is a mixture of deciduous and         
 coniferous trees. The wood is owned by
 the Forestry Commission and a public  
 footpath runs down the East inside of 
 the wood. In the South West section is
 Nuthill Farm owned by Mr. and Mrs.    
 Gill. This consists of a farmhouse, 2 
 barns, an out building and 14 large   
 sheds containing geese. In the North  
 West is a detached house belonging to 
 Mr. and Mrs. K. Lovat-Fraser. In the  
 extreme South there are 2 service     
 stations and Little Chefs either side 
 of the A1. There is also row of (3)   
 terraced houses. From the North East  
 tip to Nuthill Farm there is visible a
 ridge which was a Roman road.         </content>
