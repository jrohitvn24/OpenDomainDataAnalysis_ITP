		<content> This lady,in her early thirties,lives 
 in the village. She works part time in
 the infant department of the{private} 
{school.}She is,therefore, glad that   
 the private school is in the village  
 as it provides{employment}and adds to 
 the trade in the{village shop;}she    
 would find it inconvenient if the shop
 were to close.                        
 She lives on one of the new estates in
 the village and finds the long        
 established families rather suspicious
 of newcomers, taking a very long time 
 to accept them.                       
 She likes the quiet{village life}with 
 its reasonable playing field,         
 proximity to good leisure facilities  
 and twice yearly sale of 2nd-hand     
 childrens clothes.                    
 She's disappointed in the lack of a   
 playgroup,the vandalism,the necessity 
 of a car and nosiness of the villagers</content>
