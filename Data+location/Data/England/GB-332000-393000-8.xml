   The main job of the{fire brigade}is 
 to put out fires. They help people who
 are trapped in fires. The{firemen}have
 to wear oxygen masks so they can still
 work in smoky conditions. Their main  
 task is to get the people out and then
 put out the fire. They often have to  
 give first aid and try to revive      
 anyone who might be dying.{Bankhall   
{fire station}is near the docks so they
 have special portable equipment for   
 fighting fires in the holds of ships. 
 But we need{firemen}for many other    
 jobs for example: to rescue a cat     
 stuck in a tree, to free somebody's   
 head stuck in railings or if a car    
 crashes they are needed to get the    
 trapped passengers out.{Firemen help
