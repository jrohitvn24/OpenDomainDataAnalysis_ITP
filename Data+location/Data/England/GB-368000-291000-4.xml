		<content> The Cliff Railway is an easy way of   
 travelling from Low Town to High      
 Town.It was constructed between       
 November 2nd. 1891 and July 7th.      
 1892.  During the first two months of 
 its use, over fifty thousand          
 passengers used it.  Since 1944 the   
 Cliff Railway has been operated by    
 electricity although before steam     
 power was used.  The carriages are    
 operated from a control box at the end
 of the Castle Walk.  The Cliff Railway
 is the shortest and steepest funicular
 railway in England.  The bottom       
 station is situated opposite the      
 river.  The railway has been in use   
 for 93 years.  Every one and half feet
 you travel horizontally you travel one
 foot vertically.  The maximum speed   
 which the carriages can travel on the 
 upward journey is 250 feet per minute.
