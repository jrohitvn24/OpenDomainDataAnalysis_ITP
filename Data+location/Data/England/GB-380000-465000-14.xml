		<content> We have looked at our survey          
 critically and are aware that people  
 who do not know the area could think  
 that life here could seem to be       
 unexciting and uneventful. Many people
 who live here, however, would say that
 though things are relatively peaceful 
 and the pace of life slow in          
 comparison with a more populous area, 
 their lives are full and they would   
 not want to live anywhere else.       
                                       
 This survey has been carried out      
 by the pupils of Settle High School. A
 group of Sixth Formers did the        
 land-cover and amenities survey, and  
 they and a mixed group of 13 to 16    
 year olds helped to write all the     
 other contributions during the very   
 wet and windy Summer Term of 1985.
