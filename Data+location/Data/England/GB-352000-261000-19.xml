		<title>19The Church in the Parish</title>
		<content> In our area there is only one church  
 building (and two redundant Methodist 
 chapels),though the area includes land
 in four parishes,three of which are   
 served by one priest.                 
     Formal,organised church activities
 in these parishes are few.Apart from  
 weekly worship in the church they     
 include the choir,bellringers,Mothers 
 Union,Church School,and the           
 organisation of community events such 
 as fetes,Jubilee and other            
 celebrations,Public House Harvest     
 Festivals,&amp;c.                         
     In addition,the Church (and its   
 graveyard) holds a central place in   
 the life of the community and through 
 its members is active in most         
 community activities:Parish           
 Council,Evergreen club,Men's          
 Club,Womens institute,Football        
 club,Youth club,Bingo Club,&amp;c,&amp;c.     </content>
