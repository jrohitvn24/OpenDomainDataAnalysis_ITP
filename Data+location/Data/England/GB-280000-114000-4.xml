		<content> Shopping in Witheridge is fun.The     
 shops can offer most of what we need  
 without having to go to the towns.We  
 have our own small supermarket which  
 has a good butchery as well.There is  
 old established bakers which provide a
 wide variety of bread and cakes,enough
 to serve the area.We also have a dairy
 which delivers milk to a large area as
 well as two other general stores      
 selling groceries , vegetables and    
 hardware items.The local newspaper    
 shop sells a wide range of medical    
 supplies as well as selling shoes and 
 Witheridge also has it's own sub-post 
 office.A new venture has been a       
 clothes shop with a D.I.Y department. 
    To complete the facilities we also 
 have a bank branch,the local garage   
 sells a wide range of motoring        
 accessories and there is an electrical
 shop selling T.V's and radios.        </content>
