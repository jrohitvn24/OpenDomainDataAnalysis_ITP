 The two most important 'big' houses in
 Bulls Cross are Forty Hall and        
 Myddelton House. Forty Hall is        
 surrounded by parkland and trees at   
 the top of Forty Hill. It is now owned
 by the Council as a public recreation 
 area. The house itself has a small    
 museum and often has paintings or     
 photographic displays. In the summer  
 there are open-air plays to watch or  
 music to listen to. Quite close was   
 the site of the old Elsynge Palace but
 nothing remains now. Worcester Lodge, 
 Longbourne, Clock House and Elsynge   
 too are often photographed. These and 
 some ordinary houses and a row of just
 six shops, with a church and a school 
 make up the village of Forty Hill.
