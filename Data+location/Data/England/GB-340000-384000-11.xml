		<content>   On Tuesday 6th May I went to        
 interview Mrs. Roberts. She has been  
 living in the area for 23 years.      
 I asked her what changes she has      
 noticed in the last 10 years. She told
 me that the area is not as clean as it
 used to be. Next I asked her what she 
 liked about Hunts Cross. She said that
 she likes the{community}atmosphere.   
 She also said that she does not like  
 the smell of the{factories.}Mrs.      
 Roberts works in the area as a        
 lollipop lady. In her spare time she  
 looks after her home. She{travels     
{about 4 times a year}by rail. She also
 told me that she thought that there   
 should be more activities for young   
 people in the area.
