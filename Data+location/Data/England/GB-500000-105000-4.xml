		<content>{May.}We saw bluebells, wood garlic,   
 dead nettles, stitchwort, celandine,  
 red campion and cow parsley growing in
 the wood. We saw oak flowers and two  
 baby squirrels playing in the oak     
 tree. There were big fences at the end
 of each garden to stop deer from      
 jumping over and damaging the plants. 
  We sowed our peas in Mrs. Carter's   
 garden.                               
{July 12th.}We walked to Priory farm   
 and looked at the barn where there are
 remains of a Priory in the wood there 
 was once a road leading to the Ford   
 where people could cross the river.   
 We saw wild roses, woundwort,         
 thistles, hedgebedstraw, blackberry   
 blossom, chestnut flowers and hazel   
 nuts on our walk.                     
  We picked our peas in Mrs. Carter's  
 garden. (This was a class of 5 year   
 olds from Arundel CE School)          </content>
