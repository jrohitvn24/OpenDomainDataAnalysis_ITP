   The{population}is{widely scattered} 
 and is probably of above average age. 
 It consists of a high proportion of   
{retired people,}long-established{     
{farmers}and{businessmen and women,}the
 latter living in converted farms,     
 barns and farm cottages.              
   Many of the women have full-time or 
 part-time employment.                 
   Most of the population is relatively
 wealthy, and car ownership often      
 extends to two or three per family.   
   The keeping and riding of horses,   
 the installation of tennis courts and 
 swimming pools, give an indication of 
 the life-styles of many local         
 residents.The number of young families
 living in the area seems low, possibly
 due to the high price of property and 
 the need for a car due to the limited 
 availability of public transport.     </content>
