		<content>       The Village of Much Marcle      
 The village is situated four miles    
 from Ledbury in the county of Hereford
 and Worcester. It is a small village  
 surrounded by rich agricultural land  
 that supports a variety of crops.The  
 area is well known for its cider apple
 orchards and Westons Cider factory is 
 situated in the village. There are two
 houses of historical interest namely  
 Hellens and Homme House. The people of
 Much Marcle are mainly involved in    
 agriculture, cider production or are  
 retired. There is little employment in
 the area and this has caused a decline
 in the village population. There has  
 been little development recently but  
 hopefully this will come in the       
 future.
