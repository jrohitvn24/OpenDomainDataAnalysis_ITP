		<content> This small section of Shropshire and  
 fragment of Powys is true border      
 country.  Totally unspoilt it rises up
 from the valley of the river Teme     
 which forms the boundary between      
 England and Wales.                    
 Very hilly indeed it is wonderful     
 walking country, the bare hills are   
 softly rounded grassy with quite      
 deeply indented narrow valleys, mostly
 wooded running downwards to the river,
 made even more attractive with the    
 chatter of a gurgling stream.  They   
 are not high,never rising to more than
 1,104 feet but the slopes are often   
 steep and their tops seem wild and    
 barren though fused extensively for   
 rough grazing and the occasional field
 of arable crops.  The views are       
 wonderful from every aspect, looking  
 northwards across the valleys and     
 hills to the height s of Shropshire.  </content>
