		<title>20A Middle School Afternoon</title>
		<content>    After morning lessons we have      
 dinner time. Some people have school  
 dinners and the rest bring sandwiches.
 The children who have school dinners  
 go into the dining room, where        
 hot-dogs, chips, beans, hamburgers and
 so on are served. In the summer when  
 it is dry the children who have       
 sandwiches are allowed to eat them    
 outside, otherwise they use the dining
 room when the others have finished.   
 Health Education is the first lesson  
 in the afternoon. We have been        
 learning about teeth and hands.       
 Recently we have done a project on a  
 famous person in medicine. French is  
 next. In this we are learning to      
 describe our room and the things in   
 it. After a 10 minute break we have   
 Humanities. In this we are learning   
 about the Vikings and their lives. At 
 3.30p.m. we go home.                  </content>
