		<content> The village is built amongst rolling  
 clay countryside in the north east of 
 Bedfordshire. Like many others in the 
 area, it spreads out over some        
 considerable distance with much of the
 building being in narrow plots        
 alongside the roads.                  
                                       
 There are four 'ends', Church End,    
 Chapel End, Roothams Green and finally
 The City. The latter with the         
 interesting name is thought to have   
 Huguenot connections.                 
                                       
 The church was built in the early 13th
 century by the local landowner, Sir   
 Gerard Braybrook in honour of his     
 French wife. It is dedicated to the   
 patron saint of France, St.Denys.
