		<title>08A Large Estate in Wolsingham</title>
		<content>   One of the largest landowners is    
 Mr Tom Fenwick of{Bishop Oak,}part of 
 whose estate is included in this area.
 His four farms are let to tenants,who 
 graze sheep and cattle and produce    
 some barley,hay and silage.           
   Mr Fenwick,after 30 years farming   
 realises that only some innovations   
 will work in this area.The main       
 changes have been the{reduction in    
{manpower due to mechanisation}and     
 the increasing use of{contractors}to  
 carry out specific tasks.             
   Mr Fenwick owns extensive{woodland  
 producing timber for furniture.The    
 management of trees is one of his main
 concerns.The woods provide cover for  
{game birds.                           
  Mr Fenwick is a conservationist and a
 supporter of fox hunting.He believes  
 that{town people}have an{unrealistic  
 and{overromantic view}of the country. </content>
