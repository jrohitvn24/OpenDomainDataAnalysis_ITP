		<title>12COLESHILL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Earl Howe and some friends built the  
 school in 1840.Originaly it was 2     
 schools,infants, and pupils up to 14  
 years.                                
 Part of the school used to be the     
 schoolmaster's house _ 1 room upstairs
 and 1 down.You can clearly see all the
 changes made to the building,and also 
 marks on the bricks in the porch made 
 by pupils sharpening their slate      
 pencils.                              
 Once there were about 100 pupils in   
 the school,now there are 24,and 7 of  
 them come to our school in the Autumn,
 as it is now only a first  school.Ten 
 of our class went to this school.     
 The headmisstress,Miss Dollimore,works
 there full-time,but she is never alone
 because another teacher,a welfare     
 assisstant and secretary all work     
 partime.                              
 Every child has a school dinner.      </content>
