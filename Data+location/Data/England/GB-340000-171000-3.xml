		<title>03The Coast at Clevedon</title>
		<content> As Clevedon is on the coast of the    
 Bristol Channel,it is very often      
 windy.Much of Clevedon is below sea   
 level,which is why we sometimes get   
 floods.In 1981,the water poured over  
 the sea wall and flooded part of the  
 town.The beaches are Clevedon Bay     
 and Ladye Bay.They have pebbles and   
 shingle.There are several cliff       
 walks along the coast.From the        
 cliffs near Ladye Bay,there are views 
 of Wales across the Channel and       
 lovely sunsets!At the top of the hill,
 by the golf course,there is Walton    
 Castle.Two pop stars are thinking of  
 buying it!I have found that in        
 Clevedon,the people are more friendly 
 than in Bristol(where I lived before),
 because people know each other.       
 There are too many people in Bristol  
 for that!  by Kathryn Harris(age 11)
