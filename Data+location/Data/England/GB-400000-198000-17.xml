		<content> The family firm which owns the King's 
 Meadow Garden Centre was founded in   
 1795.Through the founder's 4 sons the 
 business diversified.The Seed Section 
 became this centre.The main building  
 on the 2.5 acre site is a double green
 house with 500m2 of selling area.Here 
 sprays,fertilizers,tools,house plants 
 and garden items are sold.Outside in  
 the garden proper plants,trees,shrubs,
 paving,fencing,green houses,sheds and 
 swimming pools are sold.The busiest   
 times of the year are Spring for      
 planting flowers and Autumn for bulbs.
 The centre is open 7 days a week and  
 the customers,2,000 per week,are often
 in the 25-45 age group.The stock,which
 is bought in from specialist growers, 
 is often bulky so a car park for 80   
 cars is provided.An adventure play    
 ground and mini zoo are planned for a 
 6 acre site to the west of the centre.</content>
