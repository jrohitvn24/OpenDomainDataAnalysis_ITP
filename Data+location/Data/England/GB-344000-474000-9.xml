 The Field Day Committee organise a    
 number of events for the young people 
 of the village.                       
 The Christmas Party, which starts the 
 new year, is a firm favourite with    
 those aged from seven to eleven. At   
 this event the attendants for the Rose
 Queen are selected who is herself     
 chosen at a later event.              
 The Queen and her attendants make     
 their principal appearance at the     
 annual carnival procession and field  
 day. This is the day on which the     
 village holds its sports, when        
 children in various age categories    
 compete for prizes. Prizes are also   
 given for fancy dress and floats in   
 the carnival.
