		<title>14Welsh Frankton.</title>
		<content>  Welsh Frankton is a small settlement 
 occupying a position at the top of the
 Brow.This forms the southernmost edge 
 of the hills that stretch away to the 
 North-West and Wales.                 
  The village is dominated by St.      
 Andrews church, built in 1858 by      
 public subscription. It is unusual in 
 the size and position of the steeple  
 which starts from a massive base and  
 tapers away rapidly. It is also       
 positioned on the side rather than the
 end of the church. The walls are      
 heavily butressed and the vestry was  
 enlarged in 1898.                     
  The remainder of the village         
 comprises a few cottages, a shop and a
 service station. The village hall     
 provides youth facilities and Frankton
 maintains a flourishing cricket club.
