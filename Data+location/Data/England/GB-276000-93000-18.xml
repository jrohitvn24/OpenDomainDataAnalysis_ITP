		<content> I go to Brownies at Tedburn St Mary.  
 It is fun. We play games like ladders,
 queens headache, fishes and outdoor   
 games. In the summer we water the     
 plants in the tubs which keeps Tedburn
 tidy. We also do badges. I have done  
 my Animal Lovers, Hostess, Artist,    
 House Orderly, Swimmer and Venture    
 tests. They were all quite easy to do.
 We have 30 Brownies. Parents take it  
 in turn to take us by car to Tedburn  
 from Cheriton. Some other children    
 from our school go too. It is fun.    
 There are 5 packs Imps, Elves,        
 Pixies,Gnomes and Kelpies. I am in the
 Elves. We go every Tuesday from 5.45  
 to 7.00 pm.
