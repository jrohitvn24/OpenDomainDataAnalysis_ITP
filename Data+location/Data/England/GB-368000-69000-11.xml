		<content> A.R.E. Southwell is a government      
 research establishment responsible for
 the application of technology to      
 underwater warfare.  Physicists and   
 oceanographers study underwater       
 acoustic propagation and detection.   
 Chemists and engineers study materials
 for the undersea environment.         
 Mathematicians and computer           
 specialists use comprehensive in house
 facilities for, amongst other things, 
 weapon system simulation and trials   
 analysis.  The engineering group is   
 able to design and manufacture        
 experimental and prototype equipment. 
 Because of the nature of the work many
 of the practical aspects are carried  
 out on ranges and at sea with the     
 Southwell accommodation used for      
 preparation and trials analysis.
