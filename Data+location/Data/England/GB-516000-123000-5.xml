		<title>05A day in the life of my dad</title>
		<content> Every morning my dad{gets up}about    
 7.30am .Sometimes it is about 6.30am  
 or even five  when he has             
 to load pigs for transporting on a    
 cattle lorry. Mr Swabey the man who   
 drives the cattle lorry has to go to  
{Baldocks Slaughter House}in Wivels-   
 field near Haywards Heath .But on a   
 normal day he has his breakfast at    
 7.30am with us then he goes out to    
{Jamesland Farm,}one of his two in the 
 area .The farm is very old because it 
 is in an old map revised in 1911.We   
 have nothing but{pigs}on our farm we  
 have boars with very unusual names.   
 One is called Boris and one is called 
 Frank Sinatra. Then he comes back and 
 then goes to{Barnfields Farm.}At the  
 moment we are building a brand new    
 barn with large sliding doors then he 
 comes back until the next day.
