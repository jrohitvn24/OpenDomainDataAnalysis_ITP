 LITTLE HENNY IS A VERY SMALL          
 PARISH(419ACRES) AND IN 1981 IT HAD   
 LESS THAN 50 INHABITANTS. IT WAS      
 DOMINATED IN THE PAST BY THE BIG      
 HOUSE, THE RYES(SEAT OF THE           
 BARNARDISTONS)WHICH IS NOW USED AS A  
 SPECIAL SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN WITH      
 HANDICAPS. IT IS A PRIVATE SCHOOL BUT 
 PUPILS ARE PLACED THERE BY LOCAL      
 AUTHORITIES.EXCEPT FOR THE WOODED AREA
 &amp; GARDENS ROUND THE RYES THE PARISH IS
 LARGELY FARMING LAND. IT IS           
 ATTRACTIVE COUNTRY TO LOOK AT &amp; LIVE  
 IN. THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE OLD PARISH 
 CHURCH ARE IN THE GROUNDS OF THE RYES 
 WITH A LITTLE OF THE WALLS SHOWING.THE
 BRIDLEPATH TO MIDDLETON MAKES A GOOD  
 WALK WHERE THE RIDING PONIES HAVE NOT 
 CHURNED UP THE WET PATCHES TOO MUCH.
