		<title>13CUCKFIELD-COMMUNICATION</title>
		<content>  Most people prefer to use first class
 mail although it is more expensive    
 than second class (17p as against 13p)
  Most houses in Cuckfield have a      
 telephone. People lazily prefer to    
 telephone rather than write a letter. 
 There are six telephone kiosks in     
 Cuckfield. The minimum charge for a   
 call is 10p.                          
  Of all the other ways of obtaining   
 information, books and libraries are  
 still very popular. Surprisingly few  
 people (12%) use Teletext.            
  When asked to name the one medium    
 that they would turn to for the latest
 news coverage most people said        
 television. Radio and newspapers were 
 the next most popular.
