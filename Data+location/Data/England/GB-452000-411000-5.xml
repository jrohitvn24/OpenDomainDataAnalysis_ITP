		<content>   All my family are Roman Catholic,and
 we attend church every Sunday at 11am 
 at the very modern Catholic Church in 
 Askern or at Burghwallis at 5pm.Father
 Burke is the priest for both these    
 Churches.                             
   Our Church includes a group called{}
{The Union Of The Catholic Mothers}who 
 have meetings every Tuesday at the    
 Catholic Hall. They help people like {
{Children in Need}and the {Ethiopia    
{Appeal,}raising money through coffee  
 mornings and jumble sales.You really  
 should be a Catholic mother to join   
 the group but,even though some girls  
 are not mothers,they are able to  join
 when they are 18.                     
   Every Wednesday and Friday the      
 Church holds a Bingo session for      
 people and it raises money for the    
 Catholic Church.
