		<title>19Gala Day in Ingleton</title>
		<content> Gala Day takes place on a Saturday in 
 Ingleton. The day begins with a parade
 at 1.30pm where there are floats led  
 by the Pipe Band. The main float is   
 the Gala Queen's float. The Gala Queen
 is a girl chosen from the Primary     
 School by the pupils. Behind the      
 floats come the people in fancy dress 
 and other attractions. The parade     
 leads all the way around the village  
 and ends up on the football field     
 where there are lots of stalls and    
 activities. This year there was the   
 usual mountain race where competitors 
 race to the top of Ingleborough Hill  
 and back again. The Junior Race goes  
 part of the way up Ingleborough to a  
 place called Crina Bottom. Some of the
 other attractions were as follows:    
 there was a Punch and Judy show for   
 the small children: there was a maze  
 for older children.                   </content>
