		<content>   Because Spreyton is far from a town 
 and surrounded by narrow twisting     
 lanes,it is not on a bus route and    
 people that do not have transport need
 mobile shops to come to them.         
   Many things can be bought from the  
 village shop and post office but the  
 village is visited by a green         
 grocer,fishmonger,butcher,baker and   
 fish and chip van.                    
   As well as these we have a          
 coalman.dustman,postmen,a paper man   
 and lady,a milkman and lady for those 
 people who do not have farm milk.     
   Other people that visit us here,    
 include an ice cream van, chimney     
 sweep, electricity man to read the    
 meters and a roadsweeper who comes    
 occasionally to sweep the road and    
 keep our village tidy.Barry Radmore is
 our special constable and the         
 Okehampton police help us too.        </content>
