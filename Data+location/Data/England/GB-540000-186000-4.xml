 Gants Hill is governed by the London  
 Borough of Redbridge. Our families pay
 rates to the London Borough of        
 Redbridge and this pays for many      
 things we need in the borough.        
 A Councillor is elected for a Ward    
 such as Wanstead and then looks after 
 the interests of all people in that   
 Ward. With Councillors of other Wards 
 in the Borough he must ensure the     
 Council makes Rules for and provides  
 many services. Some are- proper       
 Homes;good roads, lighting and refuse 
 disposal; adequate Social Services -  
 care for the elderly and those in need
 of help;a good education for all      
 children;control of building and car  
 parking; clean and hygienic shops, and
 parks to walk and play in.
