		<content>   As would be expected of the area the
 recreational facilities are almost all
 natural. Indeed apart from a Rifle    
 Range there are no constructed facilit
 ies to be found.                      
   Gardening in this fertile area takes
 up a lot of spare time for many people
 growing vegetables fruit and flowers. 
 Reading is another favourite pastime _
 especially winter _ and the mobile lib
 rary calls at Cossick Cross. Radio and
 Television provide further entertain_ 
 ment at home, augmented in some cases 
 by video and hifi systems.            
    Sewing,knitting and crocheting are 
 other hobbies which are popular. Most 
 of the residents take advantage of    
 their surroundings and are keen walk_ 
 ers and cyclists. However unless they 
 are prepared to travel in search of   
 facilities most of their entertainment
 must be found at home.                </content>
