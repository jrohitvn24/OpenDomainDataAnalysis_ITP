		<title>10    Treworgey Manor</title>
		<content>   Treworgey Manor is the home of Major
 Hall, the Lord High Sheriff of        
 Cornwall, and his wife. The manor has 
 70 acres of land. The original manor  
 house was built in reign of Henry VIII
 and has been in the possession of the 
 Cannocks and the Hanhaus since then.  
 The manor house was burnt down in 1938
 and a new one has been built on the   
 same site. It is thought that there   
 might have been an even older manor   
 house there. In the manor grounds     
 there is a clock tower which was built
 in 1720. The bell was made in 1620.   
 The clock is a twelve_hour clock, and 
 has only one hand, with four divisions
 between every hour. It has to be wound
 up every day.  In the stable block    
 there is a room with no windows or    
 doors and which can only be reached by
 a trapdoor in the ceiling, and which  
 might have been used as a dungeon.    </content>
