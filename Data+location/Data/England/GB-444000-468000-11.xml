		<title>11PHEASANT REARING PART 1</title>
		<content>{Mr Cocker is a gamekeeper at Moorhouse
{Farm which is to the south of the     
{Helperby to Raskelf road.In the big   
{pen outside there are 160 hens and 40 
{cock pheasants.When the eggs have been
{laid they are collected and put into  
{an incubator.There they stay for 20   
{days and are turned three times a day.
{The incubator holds 3,000 eggs and the
{temperature must be 100 degrees       
{Celsius.                              
{  After 20 days the eggs are put into 
{the settling trays.After that they go 
{into the hatcher for 4 days.Once they 
{have hatched they are fed three times 
{a day and are put into huts outside.  
{These huts have special lamps to keep 
{the pheasants warm.Each week they go  
{into different huts until they are    
{five to six weeks old.They are then   
{let out into the woods where they are 
{kept in release pens. }               </content>
