		<title>19ELDERLY CARE IN FLEETWOOD</title>
		<content>  Worsley House was opened on 7/2/77.  
 Owned by Lancashire County Council    
 Social Service Department.The patients
 are usually referred to the home by   
 their social worker or doctor.It is a 
 52 bedroomed home, with all the meals 
 prepared on the premises.             
  On a typical day,the patients get up 
 at about 7.00a.m.,and because the     
 average age of the patients is eighty,
 most need help in dressing.Breakfast  
 is at 8.30a.m.,after which some are   
 taken to the toilet.With lunch at     
 12.00p.m. and tea at 4.30p.m.,the     
 patients have time to themselves.Most 
 watch television or sit in one of the 
 sitting rooms.                        
  With a staff of thirty-two(most of   
 whom work shifts),Worsley House is    
 quite expensive to maintain,but it is 
 necessary to have this type of        
 establisment to care for old people.  </content>
