		<title>02HOUSING ESTATES, IPSWICH</title>
		<content>Two of the largest Council housing     
estates in Ipswich can be found in the 
South-East of the town.                
  RACECOURSE AREA:                     
  This is a post-war estate,well       
planned with a definite road pattern.  
The roads are planned in a 'wheel      
pattern'.The local shops are in one of 
the 'spokes'of the wheel,near to the   
centre.Most of the houses are terraced,
but there are some semi-detached within
the area.Like many estates of this size
there is a large recreation area       
nearby.                                
 The houses are two storey and made    
from red brick with a tile roof.With   
small gardens,front and rear,the estate
looks the same throughout.Many of the  
houses are being renvated (see page 4) 
  The shops generally sell 'local'     
products and have homes above them.
