		<title>20LONGTON BRICK CROFT</title>
		<content>   The Brick Croft used to be a wild   
 area of overgrown gardens with a large
 variety of trees alongside flooded    
 pits. Public paths went through and   
 provided quiet walks. The wildlife    
 was not unduly disturbed by the       
 fishermen or exploring children.      
    This year a{nature reserve}is being
 created with gravel paths and seating.
 The pits which have escaped infill    
 have been smoothed and made safer     
 since there will be housing nearby.
