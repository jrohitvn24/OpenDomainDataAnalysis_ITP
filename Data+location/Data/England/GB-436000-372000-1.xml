		<content>  The first Church School was founded  
 by George Milnes Esq. of Dunston Hall,
 assisted by voluntary contributions.  
 A site was chosen on the western edge 
 of the Little Moor and a local farmer,
 George Roberts, became the first      
 master when it opened in 1785 with    
 eight pupils. In 1844 the upper room  
 was used as a class for girls only and
 owing to a gradual rise in numbers the
 school was sold in 1863 and became the
 Wheatsheaf Inn, the second School     
 being built near to the new Anglican  
 Church opening in July 1863. It gave  
 good service to the community for 98  
 years despite epidemics of measles,   
 whooping cough, scarlet fever, small- 
 pox and typhoid. It was closed in 1961
 &amp; re-opened in 1965 as the Eagle Club.
  The third Church School opened in Oct
 1961 with additional building in 1979.
 In 1985 the roll is 189 in seven rooms</content>
