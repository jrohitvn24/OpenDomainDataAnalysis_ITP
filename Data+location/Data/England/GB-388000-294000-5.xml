		<content>The Penn childrens and geriatric       
hospital cares for young and old       
people. The geriatric hospital was     
opened in 1978, whilst the childrens   
hospital has been there since the turn 
of the century, having been converted  
from an old house.  The geriatric      
hospital has 84 beds.  There are 3     
wards and each ward is divided into 4  
bays with 6 beds in each.  There are   
approximately 100 nurses who work on 3 
shifts working 37 hours a week.  Most  
of the patients come from New Cross    
Hospital.  To them the hospital is     
their home, perhaps for the rest of    
their life.  Others, like Mrs.         
Butcher, who we met, is there on       
relief stay while her son goes on      
holiday.  Mrs. Butcher is 84, but she  
is still able to take part in          
activities at the hospital such as     
knitting, printing and canework.       </content>
