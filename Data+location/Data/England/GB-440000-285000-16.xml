		<content> The land around Wolvey is mainly      
 devoted to{FARMING.}                  
 Most of the land is used either for   
 growing{CROPS} or for growing grass   
 which is cut for silage or hay. The   
 crops grown are mainly cereals such as
 wheat and barley. Smaller quantities  
 of oil seed rape, kale, turnips and   
 peas are grown by some farmers.       
 On the farms today everything is      
 highly{MECHANISED.}Tractors, ploughs, 
 hay-making machinery, combines,       
 fertilizer spinners and forklift      
 trucks are now common place. This     
 means that few people are employed    
 full time on the farms. Usually two or
 three people can run quite a large    
 farm.

 herds, sheep and pigs.
