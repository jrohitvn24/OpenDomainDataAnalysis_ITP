		<title>16The Snake Man of Wormley</title>
		<content> Mr Newton lives in a cottage by the   
 River Lea. His job is looking after   
 the weir by his house. Not only is he 
 a lock-keeper but he also has a fine  
 collection of snakes and other unusual
 pets, such as tarantulas, rats, a     
 parrot and a lizard. All of the snakes
 are constrictors but the tarantulas   
 are poisonous.                        
                                       
 The longest smake that Mr Newton has  
 at the moment is a python that weighs 
 over 36 kilos, measures nearly 5      
 metres and is still growing! The      
 snakes are fed on rats and rabbits but
 Mr Newton never feeds them on live    
 animals.                              
                                       
 Many of Mr Newton's unusual pets have 
 been on the television. One of the    
 snakes also took part in a film called
 "Greystoke - The Legend Of Tarzan".   </content>
