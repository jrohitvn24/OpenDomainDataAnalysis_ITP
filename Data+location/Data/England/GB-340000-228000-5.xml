		<content>{Grove Park Estate,}just off the A465  
 road, is actually in the parish of    
 Kenderchurch, although the postal     
 address is Wormbridge. There are 18   
 houses and 4 bungalows. The first ten 
 houses were built in 1953/4 and the   
 remainder added in 1970. Together with
 three other dwellings on the opposite 
 side of the road this development     
 increased the population approximately
 threefold. The{present population}is  
 68.                                   
{Mains electricity and water}were      
 connected to the site in the late     
 1950's. Before this water was pumped  
 from a 90 foot{bore hole}on the site  
 to a tank in the roof of houses 9 and 
 10, thence fed by gravity to all the  
 houses. Initially all the houses were 
{Council property}but now four are     
 privately owned.
