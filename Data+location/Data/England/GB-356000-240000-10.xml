		<title>10THE CASH &amp; CARRY</title>
		<content>{ Norman's}is a large cash and carry in
 Withington. The total area is 16,000  
 sq.ft. 7,000 sq.ft. are taken up by   
 storage space. They get most of their 
 stock from their central depot in     
 Exeter.                               
  One thing that attracts customers is 
 the easy parking and low prices.      
 Norman's is well laid out, ideal for  
 doing the week's shopping.            
  There is a lot of fire-foghting      
 equipment and the place is well       
 organised.                            
  Norman's chain of shops started in   
 1970, when it was called "Meadow      
 Market." At the moment the store in   
 Withington is the most northerly, one 
 is planned to open in Birmingham soon.
  All kinds of goods, from crisps to   
 garden equipment, are sold.
