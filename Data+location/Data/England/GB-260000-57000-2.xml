		<title>02Cornwood church.</title>
		<content> The tower,the oldest part of Cornwood 
 Church,was begun in Norman times.It   
 is dedicated to St.Michael and All    
 Angels.Over the years it has been much
 altered, the most recent change being 
 the removal of the wooden pews at the 
 back of the church,leaving an open,   
 carpeted space for exhibitions and the
 serving of refreshments, which gives  
 it a warm and friendly atmosphere.    
 Leading from the rear of the church a 
 small room has been built,            
 incorporating a toilet and kitchen    
 facilities.The room has been built to 
 blend in with the original stone      
 work,and roofed with old slates,and   
 lead guttering.The alterations caused 
 a great deal of  discussion among the 
 villagers, many of whom were worried  
 about the aesthetic effect.
