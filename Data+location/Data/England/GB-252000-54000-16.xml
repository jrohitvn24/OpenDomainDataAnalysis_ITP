		<title>16The Fireman</title>
		<content>   My name is Paul Wood and my father  
 works at Plympton Fire Station. About 
 130 men are employed at the Fire      
 Station as firemen. They share duties 
 including answering the phone. When   
 seven vacencies were advertised 3000  
 people applied for the jobs.          
   In the Fire Station there is a house
 used for training. Dummies are placed 
 in the house and the firemen have to  
 rescue them. The dummies weigh 16     
 stone. The rooms are filled with smoke
 as if the house was realy on fire.    
   All the firemen have to drill. They 
 pracise using the hoses and putting   
 them back into the Fire Engine. They  
 have to check that their breathing    
 apparatus works and also practise     
 wearing it.                           
   When they return from a fire they   
 have to clean all their equipment.
