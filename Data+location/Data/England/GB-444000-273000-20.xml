		<title>20Church Lawford Aerodrome 2</title>
		<content>  This privately owned aerodrome was   
 taken over by the RAF at the outbreak 
 of the Second World War. The airfield 
 was then used as a training station   
 for new pilots particularly those from
 Australia,Canada and New Zealand.The  
 most common type of aircraft found at 
 the airfield was the'Oxford' a twin   
 engined plane as indeed most of the   
 aircraft here were. Other aircraft at 
 the station included 'Tudors' and     
 'Ansons'.Many other aircraft used the 
 station, though, as an emergency      
 airfield most notably a 'Flying       
 Fortress' which crashed there in      
 August 1942 and a 'Wellington' bomber 
 which crash landed there in April     
 1943.German prisoners of war were     
 often used to clear any wreckage from 
 crashed aircraft and there was much   
 as pilots were new.The airfield was   
 run down after the war and abandoned. </content>
