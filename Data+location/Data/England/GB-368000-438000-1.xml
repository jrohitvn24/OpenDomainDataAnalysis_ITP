		<title>01THE AREA.</title>
		<content>   The area is rural and undulating,   
 falling from Longridge Fell in the    
 North to the Hodder and Ribble valleys
 in the South-East.The land is covered 
 with grass and deciduous woodland.    
   Hurst Green, with a population of a 
 few hundred, is the largest village in
 the area.It has an hotel and filling  
 station (just out of our area),two    
 public houses, two cafes, and public  
 conveniences.                         
   Mitton has very few houses, but its 
 very old church is worth a visit on a 
 Sunday afternoon.                     
   Stonyhurst is a small collection of 
 teachers' houses near Stonyhurst      
 College, a Catholic Public School.
