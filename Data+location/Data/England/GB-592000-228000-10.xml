		<title>10FORDHAM SUNDAY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Sunday school is held in the Village  
 Hall from ten o'clock until eleven    
 o'clock on a Sunday morning.It is run 
 by Mr James. Sometimes instead of     
 going into the hall the children go   
 into the church and perform plays.Mrs 
 Gregory plays the piano for the songs 
 and when the children are in the hall 
 she takes the youngest ones           
 separately. They are all taught       
 stories from the bible.Then they play 
 games such as a quiz between two teams
 with points given for correct answers.
         Every Christmas the children  
 are taken to the theatre and then back
 to the hall for a party. In the summer
 they are taken for an outing,         
 sometimes to the sea-side.
