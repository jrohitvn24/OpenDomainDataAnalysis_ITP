		<content>Hednesford has many clubs for children.
Dance troops and jazz bands are very   
popular. The Bobby Dazzlers in their   
red and black uniforms have won many   
dance competitions. The Hednesford     
Sapphires are a very well known        
marching jazz band and have won all    
over the country. The ex-servicemen's  
bowling club is for all ages and       
travels to other greens playing        
tournaments. The Boys Brigade is very  
well supported. We meet on Wednesdays, 
and after a short service and          
inspection we do badge work and play   
games. We also have a football team.   
The Wado Ryu karate club meets on      
Mondays. We do self defence and the    
Japanese way of fighting. There are    
various movements called katas,        
coloured belts show the stage you have 
reached. Our school runs clubs for     
Badminton, gymnastics, football etc.   </content>
