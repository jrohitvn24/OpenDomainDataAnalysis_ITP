 another walk then some food.For her   
 meal she eats a whole tin of dog food 
 and one a half saucepans of dog       
 biscuits.                             
 A Pony: I go and meet my pony everyday
 I take him out for a ride and groom   
 him before and after the ride.I would 
 take his food up and check that he has
 clean fresh water everyday I would    
 also spray him with fly spray in the  
 summer.I would try and be with him all
 my spare time.

 with Gocats with milk. At 5 o,clock in
 the afternoon she has kitekat meat    
 plus milk.Some days she stays inside  
 all day asleep but others she goes    
 outside in the sun or shade.          </content>
