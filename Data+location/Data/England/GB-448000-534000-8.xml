		<title>08WHAT I BELIEVE IN.</title>
		<content> On Sundays we go to Holy Trinity      
 Church . At Sunday school we learn    
 about God and Christ. Our religion is 
 called Christianity, our church is    
 called the Church of ENGLAND. We      
 believe in one Holy Body and the      
 Kingdom of God. One way of showing    
 this belief is to pray and to worship 
 God.In the 'Our Father' prayer we say,
 'Do not lead us into temptation'. We  
 believe that Jesus was a miracle from 
 from God who was born to help others. 
 People who pass this message on like  
 Popes, vicars, priests, and other true
 religious believers try to think that 
 Jesus Christ was God's son, and was   
 good to mankind and died for us.This  
 is called the crucifixion, and other  
 tales like this are in the Holy Bible.
 There are other religions for people  
 that live in different countries      
 that don't believe in God and Christ. </content>
