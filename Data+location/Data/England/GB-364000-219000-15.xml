		<content> In the area we have one Parish Church 
 of St.John the Baptist at The Lea     
 which is still quite well attended    
 with a good number  of young persons  
 in the choir.This church has a history
 from the 12th.Century with the        
 settlement of a recluse or anchoress  
 in what was then a Chapel  of ease    
 under the control of Linton.(1315)Many
 visitors are attracted to the         
 Church for its historical bells,old   
 chest and an Halian stoup Font.There  
 is a history of Nonconformity in      
 the area as far back as 1662 with the 
 birth of nearby Baptist Church at     
 Ryeford and later a daughter church   
 at Longhope.There is a Methodist      
 Church at Bailey Lane End and a       
 dis-used Methodist Church on the      
 Bailey near to the Lea. The Quakers   
 had a very strong influence in the    
 past but this now appears to be nil.  </content>
