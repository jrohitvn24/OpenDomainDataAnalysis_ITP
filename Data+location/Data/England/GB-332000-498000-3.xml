		<content> Tourism is by far the most important  
 aspect of this part of the Lake       
 District.{The National Trust}owns the 
 tarns and surrounding land and many   
 thousands of people visit the area    
 annually. It is renowned for its      
 superb views of the Cumbrian Fells and
 Coniston Water. An ideal area for     
 walking and photos, it has extensive  
 car parks screened by trees, toilets  
 and a disabled persons car park at a  
 fine view point. Hawkshead is well    
 known for its quaint, narrow streets  
 and old buildings. It attracts many   
 visitors to see the church, school,   
 narrow alleys and yards. The road     
 which originally went through the     
 centre of the town has been closed    
 except for pedestrians, and           
 a bypass made. The camping and caravan
 sites, hotels and guest houses are    
 used extensively during the summer.   </content>
