		<content> In our area there are four            
 churches,three in Hathern             
 incorporating three different         
 religions:Baptist,Church of England   
 and Roman Catholic.Both Baptist and   
 Church of England have active Sunday  
 schools catering for village          
 children.Roman Catholics go out of the
 village for their Sunday school.The   
 Church of England church was built in 
 700 but now nearly rebuilt due to     
 decay.Historical value due to old font
 found in church yard,now it is inside 
 the church.Named St.Peter and         
 St.Paul.The Baptist church is over 100
 years old.The church in Long Whatton  
 is Church of England.It is fairly old 
 and holds regular services.The Roman  
 Catholic Church has recently been     
 rebuilt because it was falling apart.
