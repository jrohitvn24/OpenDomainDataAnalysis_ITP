During the Second World War there was  
not much activity or troop movement    
around this area. What was once the    
Runway is now The Parkway. I remember  
that the runway was not lit up-this    
may be because of the blackout.        
  Dutch, Polish and Czechoslovakian    
troops were based near the Airfield.   
In the autumn of 1941 the Princess     
Wilhelmia Brigade were based here and  
visited by Dutch royalty. Infact there 
is still a strong Dutch community in   
the area today.                        
  Before hte War the olf field was part
of the local farmland and woodland that
streched from Birmingham southwards to 
Kinver. I used to go cycling along the 
winding country lanes that surround    
Perton.
