		<content> The A38 and A380 roads pass through   
 this block.They are the main routes   
 for holiday traffic into Devon,and    
 carry very heavy traffic throughout   
 the summer.Haldon Hill and Telegraph  
 Hill,on the A38 and A380              
 respectively,used to be well known for
 their traffic holdups,but road        
 improvements in the 1970s have created
 dual carriageways,and holdups are now 
 unusual,except for road works.However 
 both roads can become impassable in   
 winter due to ice and snow, and Devon 
 County Council has a priority to try  
 to keep them open.Industrial          
 development in Plymouth and the       
 Roscof ferry to France have led to an 
 increased number of heavy goods       
 vehicles using these roads.The roads  
 also make it possible for commuters   
 from rural Devon to reach Exeter.
