		<content>    The{Plant Breeding Institute}has   
 extensive fields beside the old A10   
 (now A1310) where test-growing is     
 carried out.  Some glasshouses have   
 been brightly illuminated all day and 
 night for 20 years as an experiment.  
 They light up the night sky.  The     
 fields are divided into little squares
 of different crops, and are protected 
 from the fumes from the M11 by a high 
 fence.                                
                                       
    Close to Addenbrookes Hospital is  
 the{Parke-Davies Research Centre}which
 is very private.  You have to talk to 
 a receptionist through an intercom and
 the main doors are electronically     
 locked.
