		<title>13FOXHOUNDS - PETWORTH RURAL</title>
		<content> The local Hunt is the Chiddingfold,   
 Leconfield and Cowdray Foxhounds. The 
 Pony Club for those under eighteen,   
 had an August camp at Midhurst which  
 was almost washed away after a week of
 1985's torrential rain. The Hunt has  
 120 subscribers and the Supporters    
 Club a membership of 400. The Kennels 
 are at Petworth Park. There is strong 
 local opposition to hunting as a blood
 sport and objectors often try to      
 disorganise a Meet by spraying riders,
 hounds and horses. By tradition the   
 Boxing Day Meet is at the ruins,      
 Midhurst, and the last for the season 
 is held at Toby's Stone on Bignor     
 Hill, erected in honour of Earl       
 Fitzwilliam's son James, known as     
 Toby, a dedicated foxhunter. Hunt     
 servants wear the blue livery of Lord 
 Egremont, Vice Chairman.
