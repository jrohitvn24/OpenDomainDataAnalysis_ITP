		<title>18Dean Farm</title>
		<content> It took us about ten minutes through  
 the woods &amp; then round two cornfields 
 to reach Dean Farm. There was a very  
 loud bird-scarer by the path that     
 nearly deafened us. Mr Lingham met us.
 He lives there on his own with his    
 sheepdog and some ducks. He &amp; his     
 father work 6 farms with 900 acres.   
 Dean Farm is about 130 acres. Like all
 the others it is rented from the      
 cement companies who own the land. Mr.
 Lingham grows barley, oats, wheat &amp;   
 grass for hay and silage. He makes    
 silage in big plastic bags that hold  
 half a ton. Some of the barley &amp; oats 
 are fed to the cattle. They have      
 Hereford cross Fresians which they    
 fatten up for market. In the winter   
 they are kept in big barns. They have 
 sheep which winter out. The cement    
 company is planning to quarry chalk   
 here soon-spoiling a beautiful valley.</content>
