		<content> W.B.B. stands for Watts, Blake and    
 Bearne and the firm has a branch at { 
{Shaugh Lake.}We went there to see how 
 they extract the clay. First we went  
 to see the water monitor. It blasts   
 the clay out of the stones and rocks. 
 It has a pressure of 150 p.s.i. Next, 
 it goes to the sand plant, where the  
 sand and gravel are separated from the
 clay. This is screened into different 
 grades and sold to builders etc. The  
 clay goes into the thickener plant and
 travels through a series of cyclones  
 which extracts any mica that is left  
 in it. After this, chemicals are added
 to thicken the clay and clear the     
 water. The clay is pumped to {Cornwood
 for further processing.At{Cornwood}it 
 is dried and then either  exported or 
 sent to factories for the manufacture 
 of other commodities.
