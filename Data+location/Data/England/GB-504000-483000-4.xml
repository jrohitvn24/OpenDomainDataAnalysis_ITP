		<title>04KNIPE POINT, CAYTON BAY</title>
		<content> It is an area of wooded cliffs which  
 stretch down to the northern end of   
 Cayton Bay. The area at the top of the
 cliffs is now occupied by several     
 brick built holiday bungalows with    
 access from Filey road. The area      
 formerly consisted of wooden chalets  
 which formed a NALGO holiday centre.It
 has also been used as an              
 entertainments centre with bars and   
 live groups, and as a community       
 centre. There are  problems with land 
 stability. Footpaths lead down through
 the woods to the beach, the wooded    
 area being very damp and having lush  
 vegetation. The area has been         
 designated a special site of          
 scientific interest to protect the    
 plant and animal life.
