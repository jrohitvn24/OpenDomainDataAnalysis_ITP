		<content>{Cullyhall farm,Rydedown Lane.         
 The farm house,2 barns,the wall and   
 gate are Grade II listed buildings.A  
 Georgian front has been put on a much 
 older house. The main door is 9 ft    
 high so that a man on horseback can   
 ride through it as the house used to  
 be a hunting lodge.John Seend used    
 to live at Cullyhall;his father in law
 was John Seymour,nephew of Queen Jane 
 wife of Henry VIII. Elizabeth 1 might 
 have visited.Now on the 105acres,beef 
 and cereal are grown by the Nesbits.  
  Sally on the Barn at Court Farm.     
 A farm has been here for centuries. In
 1839 a statue of the goddess of corn  
 was fixed to the barn,known as Sally. 
 There are lots of stories about her.  
 Most involve her father and being     
 locked in the barn.She dies and now   
 haunts the barn,which now is used for 
 breeding horses!By Fiona,Karen &amp; Sarah</content>
