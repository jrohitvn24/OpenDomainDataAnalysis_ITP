		<title>17Youth Training in Aston</title>
		<content>  Before 1981 someone lived at Glebe   
 House. In 1981{Man Power Services     
{asked}Father Wright to set up a Youth 
 Training Scheme.The reason for this is
 the{problem of unemployment}for the   
 young school leaver in this area.     
 Before{the Youth Training{Scheme,     
{there was a Youth}Opportunities       
 Scheme,which started in January 1982. 
 Glebe House is the central office for 
 the Youth Training Scheme in Aston.The
 scheme has been going nearly 4        
 years.On the scheme they are allowed  
 50 trainees but at present there are  
 only 42.The trainees work for only one
 year on the scheme.                   
  The upper storey is made into offices
 and a computer room.The bottom part is
 for church meetings and sometimes     
 other groups hire it.
