		<title>14EVENTS IN HEMINGBY.</title>
		<content> The bridge in Hemingby over the beck  
 had to be rebuilt to carry traffic. A 
 few people in Hemingby protested      
 about it in vain.During the           
 building the local farmer, Mr.Read    
 opened his farm road so that drivers  
 could reach the village. The bridge   
 was eventually finished after six     
 months and a get-together was         
 organised for the opening of the      
 bridge. The bridge was opened in June 
 1984 by Micheal Read. He performed the
 ceremony of cutting the ribbon. Drinks
 were served in the village hall. Funds
 raised were used by the Parish        
 Council.Hemingby garden fete is held  
 every year on a Saturday in June.There
 are lots of fun,games an competions.  
 The stall are jumble,tombolar,cake    
 stall.Wehave sports later on in the   
 day too.The day end with a tug of war.
 Money raised goes to Church funds.    </content>
