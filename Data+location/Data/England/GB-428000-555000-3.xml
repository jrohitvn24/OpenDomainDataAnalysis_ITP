		<title>03WASHINGTON OLD HALL</title>
		<content> The Old Hall is famous because George 
 Washingtons ancestors lived there.In  
 1936 it was due to be demolished but  
 it was saved by the work of a local   
 committee who restored it with help   
 from English and American friends.    
  In the garden are two stone eagles.  
 In front is a sun dial.Nearby is a    
 flagpole.The American flag is flown   
 on three celebrations.Downstairs is   
 the great hall.It is where the        
 important people and guests used to   
 eat.The table has a bench at each     
 side.There is a fireplace at one end  
 of the hall.The kitchen walls have    
 probably survived from the 12th       
 century when the manor house was      
 originally built.The kitchen has a    
 table like the servants used .The     
 fireplace has a roasting jack and     
 spits like those used to cook their   
 meat.                                 </content>
