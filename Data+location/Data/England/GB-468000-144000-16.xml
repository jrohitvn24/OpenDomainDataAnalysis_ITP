		<title>16Home Life</title>
		<content> Life at Pickaxe Lane: The Lane has 14 
 houses mostly with very large gardens.
 People grow a lot of their own veget- 
 ables. The people who live there keep 
 themselves very much to themselves. 6 
 houses are privately owned and the    
 rest are farmworkers homes. All have a
 colour television set, some have video
 recorders, every house has a washing  
 machine, every home has at least 2    
 cars. There are 3 swimming pools and 2
 tennis courts. A school bus collects 4
 children and takes them to the state  
 school. Every home has at least one of
 the following: rabbits, dogs,cats,    
 horses, hampster, goldfish. Some have 
 tortoises which after 1986 it will be 
 illegal to import into this country so
 will become very expensive. Cooking is
 by Calor gas, electricity or solid    
 fuel, that is wood or coal as there is
 no gas piped to the area.             </content>
