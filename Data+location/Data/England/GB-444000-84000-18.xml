		<title>18"Bowcombe"-Day in the Life 2</title>
		<content>   A typical Summer day in the life of 
 one farmer begins at about 6.30 with a
 good breakfast so that he can be out  
 by 7 to feed the chickens. At 7.30 he 
 opens the gates, greets the men, and  
 they discuss the jobs for the coming  
 day. He then takes feed out to the    
 cattle in the Land Rover and will     
 spend the morning checking the        
 livestock for disease or ailments. He 
 will then come home for lunch.        
   The afternoon may be taken up with  
 hay-making or silage making until 7 or
 8pm when he returns home for supper.  
   "The weather is obviously the most  
 important factor. We like a good cold 
 Winter, it kills off pests. Sun and   
 rain in the Spring and a dry harvest. 
 Of course, you don't often get it. The
 thing I like about farming is the     
 variety. If you put a lot of effort in
 you get a lot of satisfaction."       </content>
