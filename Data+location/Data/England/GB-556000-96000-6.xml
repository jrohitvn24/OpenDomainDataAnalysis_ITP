		<title>06Farming 1: Ownership of land</title>
		<content>    All the Downland and farmland of   
 the area is owned by Eastbourne       
 Corporation who bought the land in    
 1920s. There are 3 farms in this area:
 Bullockdown Farm, Black Robin Farm and
 Cornish Farm. All these farm a mixture
 of arable and pasture, usually sheep. 
 However, Bullockdown has a dairy      
 herd. The first two are farmed by     
 tenants of the Corporation and the    
 last by a bailiff who farms for the   
 Corporation.                          
    It was the intention of the        
 Corporation when it acquired the land 
 to preserve its natural plant and     
 animal life for the public. It was the
 Second World War that led to the      
 increased use of the land for arable  
 farming. This has caused many         
 ecological changes and annoyed both   
 conservationists and archaeologists.
