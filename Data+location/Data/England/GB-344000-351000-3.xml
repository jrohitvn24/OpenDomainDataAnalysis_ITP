		<title>03ENERGY IN TILSTON</title>
		<content> Most houses in the area use           
{electricity}for lighting and cooking. 
 Farmers also use electricity for their
 milking machines. Houses are mainly   
 heated by{solid fuel or oil,}although 
 the occasional house is heated by     
 electricity. One house in Tilston is  
 partly heated by{solar power}panels   
 in the roof as an experiment.{Water   
{energy}is used at Stretton to run the 
 old{water mill}there. The mill is     
 about 500 years old and was restored  
 in the 1970's. It is now a tourist    
 attraction (See tourism in Tilston).  
   Many of the villagers would like to 
 use{gas}as it is considered the most  
 economical form of heating but        
 unfortunately gas has not yet been    
 piped to the area. There are one or   
 two homes which use bottled gas for   
 heating and cooking.
