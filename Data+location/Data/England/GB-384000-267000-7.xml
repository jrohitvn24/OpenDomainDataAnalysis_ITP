		<content>{Cutnall  Green}is the  main centre of 
 population  in  the  area . There are 
 something over sixty  dwellings and a 
{Post Office,}( doubling up as a small 
 supermarket ), three farms very close 
 to the  village centre , three public 
 houses and a primary school. This has 
 at present just 38 children - perhaps 
 there  is  a  danger of closure . The 
 suggestion has been made!             
                                       
                                       
 The public houses are thriving  mainly
 on passing trade - much of it for food
 as  well  as  drink !  But the filling
 station has now closed , although  the
{heavy  vehicle repair shop}remains.
