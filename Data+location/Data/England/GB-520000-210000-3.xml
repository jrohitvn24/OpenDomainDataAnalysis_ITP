		<content> In {1920}the first houses in {WGC.    
 were built on the Broadwater Estate.  
 These concrete houses were designed by
{Louis de Soissons.}Each house had sash
 windows and Roman tiles.These terraced
 houses are now being replaced with    
 modern brick built houses which retain
 the design originally proposed by{    
{Louis de Soissons.}There are 2000     
 houses in this block most of which are
 terraced.The newest houses are built  
 on the site of the {Mater Dei Convent}
 and have Georgian sash windows and    
 Roman tiles.These features are similar
 to houses in Letchworth another garden
 city designed by{Ebenezer Howard &amp;    
{Louis de Soissons.}
