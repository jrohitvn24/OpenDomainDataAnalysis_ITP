		<title>05Stainton-History</title>
		<content>  The name of Stainton is derived from 
 the Saxon words 'Stan'and 'Tun'       
 meaning stone town or farm.From       
 excavations,it is thought that        
 Stainton was once the site of a Roman 
 outpost,one of several surrounding    
 Danum,now Doncaster.The ownership  of 
 much of the land passed to the Earl   
 of Scarbrough in the seventeenth      
 century.In the 19th century,Ruddle was
 an important mineral extracted in the 
 area and the Ruddle Dyke stream       
 produced the required amount of water 
 to process the ore.                   
 The oldest residence is Hall Farm,    
 which was built out of limestone in   
 1680. It has 1 window bricked up due  
 the window act of 1698.Although there 
 has been a school since 1873, it was  
 closed in 1981,due to a falling roll. 
 the school building has now been      
 converted into a private residence.   </content>
