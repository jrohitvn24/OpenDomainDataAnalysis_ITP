		<title>14FARMING</title>
		<content>       Farming is the main source of   
 employment in our block. It is mostly 
 dairy farming. Recently, one dairy    
 herd was sold off.                    
       One farm of particular interest 
 is Meadlands Farm. Although the main  
 farm buildings are just outside  our  
 block, much of the land is within it. 
       The have a herd of Short Horn   
 cows and some sheep. The Short Horns  
 are not seen very often now in this   
 country. Most farmers do not breed    
 them any more because they do not give
 very much milk. The advantage is that 
 they do not eat so much grass.        
       There is an interesting         
 smallholding close to Stawley church. 
 It supports at least eight beautiful  
 goats which are milked by hand, a     
 variety of chickens, plus donkeys,    
 horses and peacocks.
