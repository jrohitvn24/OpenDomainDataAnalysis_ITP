		<title>16NORTH SEA GAS AT NEWTON.</title>
		<content> There is no gas supply to this block  
 but at the beginning of this decade a 
 huge North Sea Gas pipeline was taken 
 across the area.It caused great       
 consternation among some local people 
 who imagined possible gas escapes.It  
 was amazing to realise how medieval   
 were some of their fears and I was    
 tempted into verse.                   
                                       
 O mighty one!Dragon,long and yellow,  
 Passing unseen under my feet!         
 I tremble at your power hidden below  
 And beg you,flame only at the seat    
 Of all your mouths away from here!    
 Let not escape your gassy breath      
 Into this rural air for fear          
 I have that it may be my death!
