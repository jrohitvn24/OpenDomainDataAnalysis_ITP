		<title>13RISELEY - REVITALISED</title>
		<content>      In the 1950's Riseley was one of 
 Bedfordshires dying villages.  Changes
 in agricultural methods and two wars  
 had left the village with a population
 of less than 500.                     
      During the 1960's a building     
 policy was implemented to reverse this
 decline.  The secondary school was    
 built,as were small estates of both   
 council and private houses.           
      These developments attracted     
 residents who worked in towns,but who 
 wanted to live in a village.  Now in  
 the 1980's small developments of      
 desirable residences are still being  
 built and many old properties         
 renovated and enlarged.  Busy,lively  
 with a population of over 1000 now,it 
 supports a picture gallery,in a       
 disused chapel,craft shop,builder,    
 thatcher,garage etc.  It is           
 picturesque,prosperous and pleasant.  </content>
