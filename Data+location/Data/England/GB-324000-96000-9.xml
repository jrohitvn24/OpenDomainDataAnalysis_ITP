 Most people seem to like gardening;   
 certainly the gardens are very well   
 kept and look most attractive,        
 especially in the summer months.      
 There is a large field, with a cricket
 pavilion and the old village hall.    
 Kilmington has a cricket club, a      
 football club and some people belong  
 to a golf club.                       
 Activities are arranged for all ages  
 by the village hall committee and the 
 school and include social, sporting   
 and money-raising events.             
 Many of the old people go to the      
 Senior Circle,which meets every week  
 in the village hall.                  
 A coach takes the children to Honiton 
 swimming pool each week and there is  
 weekly badminton, with coaching, in   
 the hall.                             
 Brownies and guides meet every week.  </content>
