		<content> Havering has changed over the         
 years,now it is mainly  a residential 
 borough and is situated on the east   
 side of London.The borough is         
 dominated by Romford which is famous  
 for its market which is filled with   
 bargain hunters on market days.       
   Although there is no professional   
 football team or county cricket ground
 the people have great enthusiasm for  
 sport;the Dolphin centre is a famous  
 aqua leisure area.                    
   Few of the people who live in       
 Romford journey out of town to do     
 their weekly shopping;87% use local   
 shops and 30% use public transport.   
   Local people like Havering and tend 
 to stay in the area on average  23.8  
 years.Some things upset local people, 
 at the top of this list are crowds,   
 litter, poor  parking facilities and a
 lack of things for the young to do.   </content>
