		<title>19SHOPPING IN BRANSTON</title>
		<content> Branston is a very big village which  
 has fourteen shops. There are two     
 hairdressers, two news agents and two 
 grocers' stores, one electrical goods 
 shop and one garage, one pet shop     
 which is closing down, two butchers,  
 one post office, a Co-op and          
 Galbraith's DIY and hardware          
 store.There are also more shops       
 opening on the Brookfields estate.    
 Most shopkeepers here open from Monday
 to Saturday, but the Co-op is closed  
 all day Monday and one newsagents and 
 one grocers store are open on a       
 Sunday. Not many shopkeepers take     
 cheques and hardly any take credit    
 cards. We asked people what they      
 thought about the village shops. Most 
 liked the shops, especially the Co-op 
 but a lot also shopped in Lincoln once
 a week.
