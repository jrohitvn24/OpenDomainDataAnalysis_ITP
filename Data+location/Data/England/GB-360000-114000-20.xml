		<title>20STALLEN, NEAR SHERBORNE</title>
		<content>  This is a small hamlet about 1 mile  
 south-east of Nether Compton. It once 
 belonged to the Abbey but was later   
 granted to Sir John Horsey.           
  The Black Death came from China to   
 Weymouth and spread all over England  
 killing half of the population. One of
 the villages struck was Stallen. The  
 victims were buried in a common grave 
 near to the old church.               
  One of the farmers, who has lived in 
 Stallen for 15 years, produces dairy  
 replacements for other farmers.       
  Stallen has not changed much over the
 years. There are only 20 people living
 there now so it is a very quiet place.
