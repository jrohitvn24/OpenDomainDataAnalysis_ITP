		<title>12A Cannington girl's day.</title>
		<content>  At 7.15am I get up and dress and go  
 downstairs to make my sandwiches for  
 school. These usually consists of     
 bread, butter and a filling. Then I   
 make my breakfast which is usually a  
 cereal called Cornflakes which I eat  
 with milk and usually quite a lot of  
 sugar. After my breakfast I watch the 
 television. In the morning there is a 
 programme called "Good Morning        
 Britain" which is on a channel called 
 I.T.V . Then at 8.00am I wash the     
 dishes. At 8.30am I make my way to    
 school. On the way I call for Julie,  
 one of my friends. School starts at   
 9.00am.                               
 At 3.10pm we go home. I get home at   
 3.30pm and play with some of my       
 friends. I go in at 4.40pm for tea.   
 After tea I watch television,have a   
 bath and go to bed at 9.15pm to read.
