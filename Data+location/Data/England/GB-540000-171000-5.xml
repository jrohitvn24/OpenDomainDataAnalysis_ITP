 I woke up at half seven on a Saturday 
and I sneaked downstairs  and into the 
kitchen.There was the sun streaming    
through the side window.It made me feel
hungry.So I had my breakfast.After that
I went into the diningroom and         
tormented Bobbie our budgie.I went into
the livingroom.To my horror the clock  
 said 8!Icrept up to my Dads bedroom.I 
took a run up and jumped over my       
dad."Couldn't you do that softer?"Dad  
said sleepily."Don't forget Sarah's    
going on a ramble up to Halls Place at 
Bexley"said mum from inside the        
bathroom.Dad told me to wake Sarah     
up.Soon we were heading for Elmstead   
Lane  Baptist Church.When we got there 
Sarah  went to her friends and dad had 
a chat  with the leader.She asked my   
dad if he could drive a few girls up to
Halls Place.                           </content>
