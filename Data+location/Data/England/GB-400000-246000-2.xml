		<content>   There are three distinct farming    
 belts in this area.The flood plain is 
 mainly pasture.The scarp has fruit    
 trees,decidious and coniferous        
 woodland.The coniferous woodland until
 recently was managed by the forestry  
 commission,but they have ceased to do 
 so. By far the most interesting area  
 is on top of the scarp.A small field  
 within the grounds owned by the B.B.C.
 Wood Norton,is closely monitored by   
 the Worcestershire Nature Conservancy 
 Trust and is natural meadow containing
 a varied variety of plants.The whole  
 area on top of the scarp was once     
 given over almost totally to fruit    
 trees.It was one of the areas that    
 gave Evesham it's name for fruit.     
 However,recent years have seen the    
 removal of plum,pear and apple        
 orchards,although many still remain.  
 Cereal production has replaced fruit. </content>
