		<content> We went to Basildon Railway Station.  
 The Station Manager was called Mr.    
 Turner. He told us that three to four 
 thousand passengers travel through the
 station each day. Basildon Station is 
 a large building with a Booking Office
 selling tickets and a shop selling    
 newspapers, magazines and sweets.     
 There is a lift and a staircase up to 
 the platform. On the patform There is 
 a waiting room. There are two railway 
 tracks, one leading to London, the    
 other leading to Southend-on-Sea. The 
 trains are blue and white. They are   
 electric trains with overhead wires.  
 The fronts and the backs of the trains
 are painted bright yellow. The guard  
 was a lady. She had a whistle to send 
 the trains on their way. She had a    
 special key to lock the carriage      
 doors.
