		<content> BMXing is a sport which is done on    
 special bikes.There are two types of  
 BMXing.The first is racing.You need a 
 special track with lots of jumps and  
 humps.The other BMXing is called      
 freestyle.For this you need a very    
 strong bike.You can't just use an     
 ordinary bike.For both events you have
 to have a BMX.In freestyle you need a 
 lot of space and equipment like a     
 ramp.There are lots of ways which you 
 can fly off the end of a ramp in      
 midair and they have names like a     
 crossup or a Bob Haro.Another ramp for
 freestyle is a quaterpipe.You go up   
 the ramp which is curved,go flying off
 the top turn right around then land   
 back on the ramp and come back down   
 it.You can also do tricks without     
 ramps on the ground.You can walk      
 around on your bike or do hops on your
 front tyre.I like freestyle best.     </content>
