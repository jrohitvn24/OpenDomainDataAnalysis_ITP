		<content> A large recreation ground in Meonstoke
 provides a beautiful setting for      
 matches played by the Football Club   
 and Cricket Club. Badminton is played 
 almost every day in The Meon Hall     
 which is situated on the recreation   
 ground.                               
 Yoga and Keep Fit classes are well    
 attended. Horse riding is very        
 popular.Several families have a pony  
 and support the local Pony Club. The  
 Merrie Stud and Exton Stud provide    
 lessons and hacking facilities. A     
 number of villagers ride with the     
 Hambledon and Hursley Hunt.           
 On the purchase of a licence, local   
 people (many children) enjoy fishing  
 for trout in The Meon River.
