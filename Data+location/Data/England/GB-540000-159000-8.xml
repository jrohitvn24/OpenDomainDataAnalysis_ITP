		<content> HOME LIFE IN DOWNE                    
                                       
       I live at Downe Court Manor.    
 The house was built in 1689 and       
 extended in 1837.  Our house has 26   
 rooms and we have 40 acres of land    
 including fields and a wood.  We keep 
 lots of animals.  We have six horses, 
 six chickens, three ducks, eleven     
 doves, a cat and a great Dane which is
 used for guarding the house.          
       My Dad works in London, but my  
 mum stays at home to feed all the     
 animals and clean the house.  Some    
 rooms have to be closed off in winter.
  We have a big farmhouse kitchen with 
 a flagstone floor laid on the soil.   
 When it rains the stones go darker.   
       It is said that Queen Elizabeth 
 I once visited our house to attend a  
 chritening which makes it important   
 for our local history.                </content>
