  Although the Northampton to Rugby    
main railway line runs between         
Harlestone,Althorp and Church Brampton,
there are no longer any stations.The   
stop at Althorp(once used by Queen     
Victoria) has been closed and the goods
yard(owned by the Spencers) rented to  
industry.The nearest station is at Long
Buckby and Northampton.                
  The 594-6 bus services serve Lower   
Harlestone and Althorp but there are   
few buses to Upper Harlestone and only 
one service(Wednesday morning returning
same evening) runs to Church Brampton.A
school bus service serves all the above
villages conveying children to middle  
and secondary schools.                 
  There are no car hire services in    
Althorp, Harlestone or Church Brampton.
