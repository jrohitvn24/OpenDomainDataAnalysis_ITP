		<content>   Our village Church at Leadenham     
 built in the 14th Century replaced the
 earlier Church referred to in the     
 first Domesday Book.A fine lychgate   
 gives entry to a lovely churchyard    
 making a superb setting for a         
 beautiful Church built of Ancaster    
 stone.The spire soars up from a square
 tower. Inside,the first impression is 
 of an uncluttered place of worship.   
 Seating in the pews is for 320,and the
 choir seats 24.The chancel is a       
 special feature of the Church.The     
 reredos and roof were decorated by the
 artist Augustus Welby Pugin.The east  
 window has some very old Flemish glass
 in the triple rose of "Christ in      
 Majesty".The other stained glass      
 windows,installed in memory of        
 families complete the picture.The     
 Church clock,a flat bed movement given
 in 1861,strikes the hours and quarters</content>
