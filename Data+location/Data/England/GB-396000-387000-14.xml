		<title>14TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS</title>
		<content>  The original turnpike roads were so  
 difficult to travel along that they   
 didn't encourage people to travel any 
 distance. The first major influence on
 transportand communications was       
 therefore the building of the canals. 
  At Marple, two canals meet, the{Peak 
{Forest Canal}and the{Macclesfield     
{Canal.}The point where the canals meet
 is at the head of a flight of{16}     
 locks, and is called{Top Lock.}Near to
 this point were situated coal mines   
 and lime kilns which were both good   
 customers of the canals. There is now 
 a marina at the junction which is well
 used by pleasure craft, mostly under  
 private ownership. In the Summertime  
 the canals at Marple are very busy    
 with holiday boats and pleasure trips.
 There is one boat which is used as a  
 floating restaurant called{"The Four  
{Seasons."  }                          </content>
