		<title>17Road Accident in St. Albans</title>
		<content> I knew a girl called Hakima. She died 
 on Tuesday May 21st 1985, on Hatfield 
 Road. She had just come out of school.
 Her friends saw the accident. They    
 went to get her sister. I came to know
 about it because my Dad came home and 
 told my Mum. Then my Mum went to see  
 her Mum. She did not come back until  
 the next morning. Every night my Mum  
 went to see her. I did not cry, but my
 Mum did. I don't know why I did not   
 cry. A truck had knocked her over and 
 she fell on the ground. It happened on
 Hatfield Road. It's a busy road. I    
 have seen lots of cars and lorries    
 there.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
