		<content>   Paddlesworth is part of an ancient  
 settlement with a Georgian manor house
 and a small Norman Church still       
 remaining.During the middle ages St.  
 Benedict's Church belonged to a manor 
 which was owned by Odo,Bishop of      
 Bayeux. The Black Death in the        
 fourteenth century killed many of the 
 population.                           
   In 1678 the Church was closed as a  
 religious building.It was used mainly 
 as a barn for the next 250 years.Then 
 in the 1930's the Roberts Family of   
 Paddlesworth Farm restored the Church.
 Since 1971 it has been redundant as a 
 church but open to visitors.          
   The Church is 45 feet long,17 feet  
 high and 17 feet wide.The walls are   
 mainly built of flint rubble,patches  
 of brick and ragstone.The chancel arch
 is decorated with fourteenth century  
 carved heads.                         </content>
