		<title>16RIVER RAVENSBOURNE</title>
		<content>      The River Ravensbourne runs      
 through Haynes Park.   It is quite    
 polluted because nobody ever cleans it
 out.   There are no fish in the river.
 In the spring, however, you do get    
 lots of frog and toad spawn.   People 
 throw in lots of rubbish.   In the    
 summer lots of long grass falls in    
 when the golf course is cut.   Lots of
 children have gone to paddle in the   
 water and cut their feet on glass.    
      We did a survey to see how many  
 people thought the stream was         
 dangerous.   Lots of people thought it
 was not very safe.   In fact          
 eighty-seven people out of a hundred  
 said it was dangerous.   We also asked
 if they thought it was clean enough.  
 We had a terrific response.           
 Sixty-six people said that it was     
 polluted and thirty-four said that it 
 was safe.                             </content>
