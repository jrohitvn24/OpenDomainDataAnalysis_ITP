		<content> A Pedigree Herd of Wresto Cattle are  
 kept at Hall Farm. This herd          
 started with twelve heifers from Silso
 in Bedfordshire. Good Friesians were  
 bought locally and from these has been
 raised the Wresto Herd which now      
 comprises 140 milking cows, 100       
 followers (young stock) and 20 beef   
 cattle. With the current milk quota   
 due to overproduction in the Common   
 Market it is necessary to cull hard so
 only the best cattle are kept within  
 the herd.  All the cattle are kept    
 inside for the winter and by the      
 beginning of December all are under   
 cover.
