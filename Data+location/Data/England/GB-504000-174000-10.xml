		<content> The M25 is the London Orbital Motorway
 and there is an exit just west of     
 Stanwell to serve the traffic to      
 Heathrow.The s. part of the motorway  
 is currently in use. Later this year  
 another section should be completed   
 linking Heathrow to Gatwick,the second
 London Airport. The north part,linking
 the present M25 to the M1 and the     
 north and east part of the M25 should 
 be open soon and hopefully will       
 relieve the traffic problems that     
 cause many problems in the area.      
                                       
 A great deal of goods traffic is      
 routed through the village and its    
 narrow roads as the cargo side of the 
 airport is on the south side of       
 Heathrow. The safety and the damage to
 the historic houses is a major cause  
 of concern to local residents.
