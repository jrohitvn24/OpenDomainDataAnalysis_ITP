 There is an unusual copse North of Two
 Bridges called Wistman's Wood. There  
 are records of this existing as long  
 ago as the seventeenth century.       
                                       
 Ecologists think that Wistman's Wood  
 is part of an old forest that covered 
 most of the area. It is made up of    
 gnarled, stunted Oak trees amidst a   
 granite clitter covered in Lichen,    
 Moss and Ferns.                       
                                       
{Wildlife}                             
                                       
 Kestrels, Buzzards and Crows are often
 seen in the vicinity of the wood.     
 Larks are often heard but seldom seen.
 Sheep, cattle and ponies graze out on 
 the open moor.
