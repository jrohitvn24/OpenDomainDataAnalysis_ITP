		<content>  FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS I HAVE BEEN    
 CARRYING OUT A SURVEY ABOUT WHAT      
 PEOPLE THINK OF TELEVISION. I         
 INTERVIEWED 10 PEOPLE AND HERE IS MY  
 ANALYSIS:                             
 THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT      
 WATCHING TELEVISION IS 3 HOURS PER    
 DAY.                                  
 MY SECOND QUESTION WAS 'DO YOU THINK  
 THAT TELEVISION CAN BE IMPROVED IN ANY
 WAY?  60% SAID{YES.}40% SAID THAT IT  
 WAS ALL RIGHT AS IT IS.               
 OF THE 6 PEOPLE WHO WANTED IT         
 CHANGED,2 THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE NO  
 VIOLENCE SHOWN AND ONE SUGGESTED THAT 
 THERE SHOULD BE MORE AIR TIME. TWO    
 PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO
 COMMERCIALS AND 1 PERSON SAID THAT    
 THERE SHOULD BE MORE CHANNELS         
 AVAILABLE.
