		<title>19The Sailing Club</title>
		<content> Our sailing club is in Southwold on   
 the River Blyth. There is a race every
 Sunday and they have a Spring and     
 August Regatta. Some Saturdays they   
 also have a club night. After sailing 
 people throw you in with your clothes 
 on. They also have teas and lunches.  
   We also have a school sailing club  
 which goes sailing every Wednesday    
 with Mrs Price. Only people who can   
 swim 50 metres in light clothes are   
 allowed to sail with the school. We   
 always wear life jackets and usually  
 sail Wayfarer dinghies. There is a    
 safety boat in case we get into       
 difficulty.
