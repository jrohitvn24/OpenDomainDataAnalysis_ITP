		<content>{Sandroyd School}is situated in the{400
{acre Rushmore Park.}The main building,
 originally belonging to the{Pitt-     
{Rivers}family was constructed in{1888.
 As a prep school it has the advantages
 of smaller classes and competent staff
 . It is not co-ed as activities are   
 easier to arrange with just boys. The 
 fees for the{110-120}boys vary from   
{Â£1,100 to Â£1,300 per term}depending on
 the number of extras. The parents     
 consider an education away from home a
 good training for later life. The most
 important subject is{English},includ- 
 ing the  art of communication, both   
 oral and written. The school has a    
 good{C.E. and scholarship}success rate
 and the opportunity given to the boys 
 to learn about the{natural history}of 
 the area is one of its main attract-  
 ions.
