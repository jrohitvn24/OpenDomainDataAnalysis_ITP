		<content>Living in Five Oak Green has advantages
and disadvantages.Shopping facilities  
are limited and buses infrequent so    
transport is difficult for the elderly 
or families without cars.              
There is a Post Office,a hairdressers,a
garage and a D.I.Y. shop.Service in the
two general stores is personal and     
friendly. Milk and bread are delivered 
daily and kind neighbours transport    
elderly friends to shops and the Health
Centre in Paddock Wood.                
Entertainment for the elderly is       
provided by Capel Country Friends.     
There is a large playing field and     
modern community centre.We have        
Brownies,Cubs,Scouts,a Youth Club and a
playgroup for children.                
Badminton,The Sports and Social Club,  
Women's Institute and Gardener's       
Society are favourite adult groups.    
Two small churches worship in covenant.</content>
