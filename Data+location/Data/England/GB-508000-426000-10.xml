		<title>10HULLS TELEPHONE SERVICE</title>
		<content> 1985 is the 80th anniversary of Hulls 
 Municipal Telephone service, it is now
 the only independent telephone service
 in Britain.                           
 There are now 182,000 telephones      
 serving a population of 372,605.  The 
 area covered is larger than the city  
 boundary, it includes many of the     
 villages outside the city, covering   
 some 120 square miles.                
 The service also has 424 public phone 
 boxes and 1083 rented coin phones.    
 The future looks promising as with the
 privatisation of British Telecom Hulls
 independence remains assured.  Also   
 the service is to be improved with the
 replacement of the old Stowger and    
 Crossbar exchange system with the new 
 System X built by Plessey/GEC. This   
 new system uses microchip technology  
 and is being phased into the existing 
 system slowly over the next 3 years.  </content>
