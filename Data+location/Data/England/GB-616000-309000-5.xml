 The school is on Three Mile Lane,     
 which is so called because it is next 
 to the milepost three miles from St   
 Benedict's Gate, Norwich.             
 Children aged 7 to 11 years attend the
 school, from Costessey;  there is a   
 bus to bring children from Old        
 Costessey.  Children who live at      
 Easton, the first village along the   
 A47 to the west, come to Costessey    
 Junior when they are 8, in the second 
 year.  They also come by bus.         
 A small number of children come from  
 other places, like Bawburgh, Honingham
 and Bowthorpe, because their parents  
 choose to send them to Costessey      
 Junior School.
