		<content> Most of the area is in the Anglican   
 Parish of Treverbyn. It has a         
 population of 4000 of whom 61 are on  
 the Church electoral roll with an     
 average of 48 regular communicants.   
 There is no Sunday school or Youth    
 Club. Numbers of baptisms, weddings   
 and funerals have remained relatively 
 constant over the last 5 years. Fund  
 raising continues through the year    
 with an annual fete, Christmas bazaar,
 treasure hunts, country dancing and   
 jumble sales in the Church Hall.      
                                       
 The Reverend Janet Knowles-Berry, one 
 of 5 women ministers in Cornwall, is  
 the Methodist minister of Trethurgy   
 Chapel. The number of methodists have 
 halved in the last 5 years. With an   
 average congregation of 6, the Chapel 
 closed in July 1985. Penwithick Chapel
 now serves the whole area.            </content>
