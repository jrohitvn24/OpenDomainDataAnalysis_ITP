		<title>04St.MICHAEL'S SHEBBEAR</title>
		<content> The Parish Church of Shebbear goes    
 back to 1150, as its Norman entrance  
 testifies. It has two parallel        
 aisles, the south aisle dating back to
 1450 and built by Lady Prendergast    
 whose effigy is set into the south    
 wall. It has barrel shaped vaulting,  
 the ceiling having been removed to    
 allow air to circulate. A screen      
 across the chancel was erected in 1933
 by a previous vicar. The Jacobean     
 pulpit is a fine feature. The Church  
 seats 176 people, and has an average  
 congregation of 25 to 30. Morning     
 service is held every Sunday. The     
 Churchyard is spacious and has 385    
 graves, dating as far back as 1760.   
 There is a modern two manual pipe     
 organ. Many of the hassocks have been 
 attractively embroidered by ladies of 
 the Congregation. The choir consists  
 of older boys and girls.              </content>
