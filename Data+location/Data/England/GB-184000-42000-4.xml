		<title>04Games We Play at School</title>
		<content> The games we play on our playtimes at 
 school are pretend fighting,which is  
 just playing around on the grass.We   
 also play tig,or hospital tig which is
 different because in hospital tig you 
 have to hold where they tig or touch  
 you,but you do not in ordinary tig.   
   Sometimes we play Red Rover.When    
 somebody calls you you have to run    
 over to the other people.If you do not
 get through you join on the other     
 side.If you get through you stay n    
 your own side.                        
   When we do not know what to play in 
 the netball season,we sometimes play  
 netball and if one of us brings a ball
 we play passing shooting or           
 football.We also play F.A. which is   
 when someone is in goal and the other 
 people tackle one another to try and  
 score a goal. ,
