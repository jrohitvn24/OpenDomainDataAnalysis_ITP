		<title>12World War II Find, Hailey</title>
		<content>On the land-cover survey I stubbed my  
foot on a fragment of metal. I dug up  
what I thought was an ordinary shot-   
gun cartridge.                         
I sanded it down and on the top it     
read ST 1942 20mm. which was in the    
Second World War.                      
At school I showed Mr. Claridge, who   
lived in Hailey in 1942. He told me a  
story about a formation of Avro Ansons 
which were night training from RAF     
Finstock, circling, landing and taking 
off again. A German fighter attacked   
so they turned the runway lights off.  
The pilots training couldn't find the  
run way so the German fighter could    
easily shoot them down. Some of the    
pilots tried to land and crashed in    
doing so.                              
Perhapes my cartrige came from the     
guns of the German fighter plane.
