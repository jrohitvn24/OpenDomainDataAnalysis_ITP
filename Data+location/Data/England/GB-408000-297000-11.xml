		<title>11Four Oaks Farming.</title>
		<content>   At the Middle School, across our    
 playground, they rear chickens and    
 ducks. They have six chickens and the 
 average number of eggs laid each week 
 is 3 dozen. Each six eggs are sold for
 40 pence which brings in Â£2 to Â£2.80  
 per week. The breed are Warrens and   
 are 15 months old. They have been     
 laying for about 12 months. They eat  
 'layers' mash and drink water, They   
 have grit to help them digest their   
 food. On April 16 1985, Middle School 
 put 8 duck eggs in an incubator, seven
 days later they added 12 hen's eggs.  
 Between May 13th and 15th six ducks   
 and seven chikens hatched. It was very
 exciting watching them grow.3 ducks   
 are being kept for the school pond. 2 
 have gone to an 'old people's home'   
 and one to a child. The cockerels have
 gone to a farm and the hens kept for  
 laying eggs at school.                </content>
