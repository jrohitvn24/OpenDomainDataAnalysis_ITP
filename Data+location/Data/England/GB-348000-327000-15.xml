		<title>15Michael's Busy Day  2</title>
		<content>  After lunch I called for Edmund who  
 was cleaning his gun.I said "Are you  
 playing?" and he said yes. His dad    
 said "Try some of this Greek wine."   
 I thought it would be like any other  
 wine. Edmund said "Drink it fast or   
 you won't like it." Then he started   
 laughing. I drank it quick. It tasted 
 of aniseed. About 5 seconds later it  
 really burnt my throat. Then we went  
 to the building site. We only meant to
 stay for an hour but when I looked at 
 my watch it was 5.30. "Oh no! I'm     
 late," I thought. When I eventually   
 got home my dad looked hard at me and 
 my mum said "What time do you call    
 this?" I said "Sorry," and she said   
 "Alright then." Isaid "Can I go out   
 until 8?" My mum said I could. When I 
 got in dead on 8 I watched the telly  
 until 10 o'clock then went to bed.
