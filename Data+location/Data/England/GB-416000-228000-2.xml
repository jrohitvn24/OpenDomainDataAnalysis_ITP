		<content> The area is served by the A424 Stow   
 to Evesham road &amp; the A429 Moreton to 
 Stow, Fosseway.Connections to these   
 roads are via lanes which are more    
 than adequate for the volume of       
 traffic.During periods of heavy       
 snowfall; normally Jan.-Feb.these     
 roads are often blocked &amp; smaller     
 settlements can find themselves cut   
 off.Rail communication is possible    
 from Moreton-in-Marsh &amp; some people   
 commute to London &amp; Evesham using this
 service.There is also a bus service to
 Moreton &amp; Cheltenham(via Bourton).On  
 Saturday there is also a bus to       
 Evesham.A service of a different kind 
 is provided by a minibus-'The         
 Villager'driven by voluntary local    
 drivers.A short traffic census in     
 Longborough showed an average of 40   
 cars passing through the village in an
 hour.Most families own a car.         </content>
