		<content> Surveys by children of{Horndean and   
{Wecock Middle Schools}showed that     
 watching television was the most      
 popular activity. Riding bicycles came
 next, particularly bicycle motor cross
 riding. Other popular activities      
 included dancing, reading and board   
 games. Many children like belonging to
 clubs which provide activities like   
 scouting and guiding, boxing,         
 football, computing and judo. School  
 playground games tend to be group or  
 team games involving chasing, for     
 example catch, bulldog, football,     
 kinger and blue murder. Younger       
 childrens games were more concerned   
 woth role play. Mummies and Daddies,  
 schools, nurses and shops are         
 examples. During school physical      
 education lessons preferred activities
 were football, rounders and athletic  
 events like running and hurdling.     </content>
