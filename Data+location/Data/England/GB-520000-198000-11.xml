		<content> We did a survey of the views of people
 living in South Mimms and all the     
 people we interviewed said they liked 
 living there. Most gave us their chief
 reason, the QUIET rural ATMOSPHERE .  
 The younger people also liked being   
 fairly close to the shops in Potters  
 Bar and being able to get to London   
 easily.We also asked about the effects
 of the M.25 on the village. When the  
 work first started there was concern  
 amongst the villagers because of the  
 noise &amp; threats to the countryside.Now
 the construction is well under way    
 most said they had come to accept     
 it. They thought it would eventually  
 ease traffic problems at Bignell's    
 Corner roundabout and be useful for   
 getting to the airports or round      
 London to the coast.
