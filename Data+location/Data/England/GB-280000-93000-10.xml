		<title>10THE METHODIST CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Methodist Church was built in 1930
 for the sum of Â£1900.It was lit by    
 paraffin lamps, until electricity came
 to the village.                       
 It now has a membership of 20, and two
 services are held each Sunday.        
 A kitchen was added in 1982 at a cost 
 of Â£625.                              
 The Harvest Festival is a highlight of
 the year, when the Church is          
 beautifully decorated - a special     
 feature being the hanging corn,       
 threaded through by string. Parish    
 Councillors and Young Farmers take    
 part in the service.                  
 The Wesley Guild meets fortnightly    
 during the winter. Friends from the   
 Anglican Church and other             
 denominations join in.                
 A new building has been proposed      
 alongside the Church for a Sunday     
 School.                               </content>
