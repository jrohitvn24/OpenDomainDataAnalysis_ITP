		<title>02THE MARLBOROUGH CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> It was the Carnival on Saturday, and  
 the sun was shining. I watched and    
 thought it was fun. I liked to look at
 it and I liked to look at the         
 carnival princess. I saw the Mayor, I 
 saw my brother's float, and he        
 squirted me and I got very wet. I     
 liked the people who dressed up.      
                                       
 Peter was a sheep and he won first    
 prize.                                
                                       
 Paul was on the Ghostbusters float,   
 and it was the best one. I threw money
 into a hat. The carnival was good.
