		<title>02HONING E.RUSTON LAND USE</title>
		<content> Our area covers the civil parish of   
 Honing and the western half, more or  
 less, of E.Ruston. Much of the land is
 the good free draining loam typical of
 East Norfolk but there is more        
 variation than is usual in the better 
 parts of the region and the less      
 favored patches are numerous and some 
 are fairly extensive. Woodlands, parks
 and commons and uncultivated wet lands
 are estimated at 15% or more.         
 The most extensively grown crop is    
 wheat, followed by barley and sugar   
 beet and by vegetable crops mainly on 
 contract for processing, these        
 comprising potatoes, peas and beans.  
 Fruit, formerly a local speciality,   
 has very recently disappeared.        
 Grassland, whether temporary or       
 permanent, is of minor importance, as 
 are the various livestock enterprises,
 principally beef cattle and pigs.     </content>
