		<content>    Tiddenfoot Leisure Centre was      
 opened in 1975. In the Centre there is
 a large swimming pool, which always   
 has about two staff at the pool side. 
 They have fun swims every Saturday and
 every day except Sunday in the        
 holidays. On Thursdays in term time   
 there are mother and baby swimming    
 sessions. There is a sauna, spa bath  
 and solarium. The lounge is upstairs, 
 where gymnastics, keep-fit and table  
 tennis are done. Also tennis can be   
 played. There is a weight lifting room
 and badminton and squash courts. One  
 squash court has a balcony. Roller    
 skating can also be done at the       
 Centre. You can buy goggles, sweat    
 bands, squash balls and other sports  
 equipment there. There are 9 full time
 staff, who have their own staff room. 
 Outside the Leisure Centre there is a 
 large car park for the users' cars.   </content>
