 The group of shops in Allandale Road  
 and Francis Street cater not only for 
 the every day needs of the local      
 residents but also attract people from
 further afield by providing a number  
 of quality specialist shops.These     
 include jewellers,fine art shops      
 boutiques,a restaurant,hairdressers   
 and a florist.Although it is generally
 rather expensive to shop here many    
 customers regularly do so because of  
 the friendly personal service.Many of 
 the shop assistants expressed similar 
 views and said that they preferred    
 working in an area where they could   
 get to know their customers.          
 The site has an interesting history in
 that many years ago it comprised of   
 rows of terraced houses which provided
 accomodation for servants working in  
 the larger houses nearby.             </content>
