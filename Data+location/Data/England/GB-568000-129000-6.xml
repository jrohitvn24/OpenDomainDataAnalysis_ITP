		<title>06Ticehurst School - Present</title>
		<content>  The school was built in 1846. The    
 outside was last painted in 1982, the 
 inside in 1967. It has 5 classes, 2   
 small halls, 1 music room and a T.V.  
 and resources room. At the front is a 
 lovely garden with a pond, lawns,     
 flowers and trees. Around the back of 
 the school is a hard playground. There
 are 4 classroom huts but only two are 
 joined to the main building. Most of  
 the class would like better sport     
 facilities with proper changing rooms.
 They like the computer and the new    
 disc drive.                           
  Kathryn's mum who's chairman of the  
 P.T.A. said that it was enjoyble and  
 good to be involved with the school.  
 The P.T.A. raises about Â£1,000 a year 
 and has provided us with such things  
 as reading labs, P.E. apparatus,      
 record player, a video, sports        
 equipment and musical instruments.    </content>
