		<content> Only one{policeman}works in our area. 
 He is a Community Constable and he    
 lives in a police house at Marr.Next  
 door is an office,but no cell.Any one 
 arrested is taken to Bentley.The      
 office was built in 1952.Before that, 
 the{policeman}worked from Adwick.The  
 main offences around here are dumping,
 burglaries and poaching.There are also
 a lot of road accidents on the cross  
 roads at Brodsworth.Most of the{crimes
 such as robberies and dumping are     
 commited by people who do not live in 
 the villages.Some of the boys from our
 school were witnesses to a{burglary}at
 a house in Brodsworth.The church has  
 been broken into quite a few times but
 most of the things stolen have been   
 recovered.{Law and order}is topical at
 the moment.There are more Community   
 Constables to break down the barriers 
 between people and the police.        </content>
