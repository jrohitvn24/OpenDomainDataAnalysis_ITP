		<content>      At the time of writing (June     
 1985) a new primary school is being   
 built to replace a 19th century       
 building in Pewsey and other smaller  
 village schools for all children aged 
 5 - 11 years.                         
      Pewsey Vale School takes pupils  
 from 11 -16 years.  With about 550    
 pupils, it is one of the smallest     
 viable comprehensive schools in the   
 country, serving villages for 10 miles
 around.  Academically and in sports   
 Pewsey Vale can match its bigger      
 neighbours, as well as having the     
 advantages of a more intimate         
 atmosphere in a smaller organisation. 
 Pupils going on to further education  
 attend school at Marlborough or       
 colleges at Salisbury, Trowbridge or  
 Swindon at 16 years.
