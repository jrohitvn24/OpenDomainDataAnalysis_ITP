		<title>05A DAY AT BODIAM MANOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>                                       
   I am 13 years old and in my         
 final year at an Independent school   
 preparing for Common Entrance         
 Examinations.                         
  The day begins with assembly at      
 8.50am. for the whole school. The     
 first hour is given to a weekly       
 examination practice after which we   
 hurry outside for morning break. Next 
 is a computing lesson during which we 
 learn to program in Basic. Then       
 Science and English Literature lessons
 bring us to lunchtime. After lunch and
 a break we have Gymnastics in the new 
 School Hall. Then in Pottery we use a 
 wheel to model clay. Our last lesson  
 is Mathematics. School finishes at    
 4.00pm. when we may optionally stay to
 do our prep. until the Dancing at     
 5.15pm. My mother collects me in the  
 car at 6.15pm.                        </content>
