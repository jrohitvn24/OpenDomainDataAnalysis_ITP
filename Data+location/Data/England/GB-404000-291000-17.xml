Litter is quite a big problem around   
some areas.Hawthorn Road area is full  
of litter because of the shops like    
take aways,sweet shops,toy shops and   
department stores. I think teenagers   
and kids make the mess mainly because  
of the sweets,crisps,ice lollies and   
fish and chip wrappers.                
                                       
VANDALISM                              
Vandalism is quite a big problem in    
Birmingham.We have had a lot of        
vandalism done to our school.Vandalism 
has been done to telephone boxes,houses
and shops.Some new trees were planted  
at the sides of the roads,but lots of  
them have been broken off.
