		<content> LEISURE ACTIVITIES OF SOME OF THE     
 PEOPLE OF NEWTOWN, GT.YARMOUTH        
    We decided that the results showed 
 that most people do not want any more 
 entertainment in Newtown. Also,a      
 majority said they do not spend too   
 much on Entertainment.Nearly all      
 travelled to the facility by car,but  
 most not further than Yarmouth.       
    Gardening is quite a common hobby  
 amongst the people who were           
 questioned, along with knitting.      
    The Athletics Club and Marina      
 Centre were popular under the Sporting
 section.                              
    People went to the Marina Centre   
 not always for the sporting           
 activities, but sometimes for its     
 other Entertainments.
