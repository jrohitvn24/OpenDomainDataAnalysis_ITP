		<content>                                       
  THE MOST NOTABLE FEATURE IN OUR      
 LANDSCAPE IS KNOWN AS THE DEVIL'S     
 PUNCHBOWL.IT IS A HUGE DEPRESSION     
 WHICH HAS BEEN FORMED BY THE EROSIVE  
 EFFECT OF RAIN, SPRINGS AND STREAMS   
 OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, SO THAT   
 THE BASE OF THE BOWL IS 1OO METRES    
 LOWER THAN ITS RIM, AROUND THE EDGE   
 OF WHICH THE LONDON TO PORTSMOUTH ROAD
 -A3, IS FORCED TO CURL.               
  THE SPRINGS, RISING WHERE THE        
 GREENSAND AND ATHERFIELD CLAY MEET,   
 JOIN TOGETHER TO FORM THE SMALL BROOK,
 WHICH BECOMES A TRIBUTARY OF THE WEY. 
  THE PUNCHBOWL IS AN AREA OF          
 OUTSTANDING NATURAL BEAUTY AND ALONG  
 WITH GIBBET HILL FORMS PART OF THE    
 HINDHEAD COMMONS UNDER THE OWNERSHIP  
 OF THE NATIONAL TRUST. AS A           
 CONSEQUENCE IT IS MUCH FREQUENTED BY  
 THE PUBLIC FOR RECREATION.            </content>
