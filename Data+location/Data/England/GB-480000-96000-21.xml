<title>21East Wittering Fire Station</title>
<content>

Being a part time firefighter at East Wittering station means you have lots of responsibilities.  Firefighters carry out a range of duties from emergencies in the home and on the roads, as well as visiting children in schools and nurseries to educate them about fire safety.  &lt;br />&lt;br />In 2011 the station at East Wittering had a new fire engine.  It is stored at the fire station which also has a base for local police and community wardens. &lt;br />&lt;br />The firefighters go to college to learn about fire safety and every Wednesday they meet and go through drills.  They also learn to use the truck and boat. &lt;br />&lt;br />The firefighters have a pager to take home, this alerts them when there is an emergency and they have to get to the station as quickly a they can. Most of them have other jobs. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
