		<title>11LAND USE IN THE WROTHAM AREA</title>
		<content>  The two main land uses in {Wrotham}  
and {Borough Green} are {Grassland} and
{Housing}. In Wrotham there isn't any  
derelict land. In Wrotham there are    
some amenities that we don't have eg.  
Colleges, Job Centres, Hospitals,      
Cinema, Private Sports Grounds.        
  {Farming} has got less land than it  
had in the 1960's. The cost of housing 
has gone up heavily costing now from 40
to 75 thousand pounds.                 
  The amount of livestock has decreased
over the past 30 years due to the need 
for food and diseases such as foot and 
mouth.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
