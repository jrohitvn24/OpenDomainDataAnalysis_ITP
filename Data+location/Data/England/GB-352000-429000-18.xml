		<title>18RAMADAN AND EID IN PRESTON</title>
		<content>       We Muslims have a month, called 
 Ramadan, when we don't eat from dawn  
 until dusk because Allah wants us to  
 remember the poor.                    
       At sunset we eat dates, fruit,  
 samoosas and vegetables. Later we wake
 up to have a big meal. After a special
 prayer, called Niyat, we can't eat any
 more, so we go back to sleep.         
       At the end of Ramadan, there is 
 a festival called Eid. Ladies decorate
 their hands with mendi (henna). We    
 all wear new clothes. The men go to   
 the mosque. Later everyone goes       
 visiting. When some one opens the door
 they say Eid Mubarak (Happy Eid!). We 
 all have plenty to eat and drink.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
