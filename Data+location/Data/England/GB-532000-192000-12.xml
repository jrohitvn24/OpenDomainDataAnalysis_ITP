 STICKY TOFFEE                         
                                       
 In your street or school playground   
 you can play sticky toffee. There are 
 about eleven people playing. One      
 person says I went to the shop and I  
 bought a sticky ...apple, until he    
 says 'sticky toffee' then you all run.
 If the person catches you, you have to
 stand still with your hands out. They 
 wait until someone goes under their   
 arms when they are set free. If the   
 person catches them all he has won.   
 You have three chances. In games like 
 this people usually say 'Fainites' if 
 they're going to be caught or need    
 some excuse. When they say            
 'Fainites',they cross their feet or   
 fingers.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
