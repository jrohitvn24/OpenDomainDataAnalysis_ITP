		<title>12Friars Farm (1)</title>
		<content> Recently a group of children from our 
 school visited Friars Farm.  The farm 
 has been in the same family since it  
 started 150 years ago.  It was then a 
 dairy farm with livestock - beef herd 
 and chickens.  The historical feature 
 of the farm is the Brew House which is
 200 years old.  Today there is no     
 livestock and most of the 400 acres   
 are used for cereals -{Wheat: 160     
{acres, Barley: 150 acres and Beans: 90
{acres.} These are winter crops and    
 they do not grow any spring crops.    
 The average field size is 25 acres and
 the soil is medium loam.  They have   
 two combine harvesters which are only 
 used for 6 weeks of the year which    
 seems a waste for such expensive      
 machinery but they find it too        
 difficult to hire them because of the 
 high demand at harvest time.
