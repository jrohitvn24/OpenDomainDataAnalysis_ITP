		<content> The Wrenthorpe Community Assosiation  
 are trying to raise money to pay the  
 builders who are going to build a new 
 Village Hall.They have been holding   
 events for 7 years.Some of the events 
 are things like discos,dances and the 
 May Day Spectacular.They have some    
 games to take to galas like Bat a     
 Rat,The Key Game,Play Your Cards Right
 and other games like that.In Bat a Rat
 there is a tube  which you send the   
 rats down and there is a space at the 
 end where you hit the rats.Play Your  
 Cards Right is like the one on        
 TV.The hall is used for Playgroup,    
 Whist Drive,discos and dances.They    
 also use it for Bingo.At the discos   
 there are  drinks,crisps and sweets on
 sale.
