		<content>Horse racing: There are two race       
courses at Newmarket. The Rowley Mile  
course dates from the mid 17th. century
and is used during Spring and Autumn,  
and the July course, some 100 years old
is used in the Summer months. They are 
situated on the Heath on either side of
the Devil's Dyke. Approximately 146,600
people visit the two courses during the
flat racing season. Many people are    
employed in the racing industry and on 
race days traffic is heavy with race-  
goers coming from many miles away      
nowadays.                              
The Newmarket Town Plate, a race for   
amateurs, is run every year in October.
It was instituted in 1665 by King      
Charles II who is reputed to have won  
it.                                    
Horse boxes are a common sight.
