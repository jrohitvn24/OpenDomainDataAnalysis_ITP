		<title>20The future of Heybridge</title>
		<content>   Although an ancient place, Heybridge
 owes much of its present position to  
 the canal. That stretch of water      
 brought with it work and money. Not   
 least was the importance of Bentall's 
 which made farming machinery and moved
 to Heybridge in 1811 to take advantage
 of the canal. The factory and the     
 warehouse were important symbols of   
 Heybridge. However, Bentall's has now 
 gone and the jobs with them. Yet other
 firms are springing up and taking its 
 place and there is talk of converting 
 the old factory into a new shopping   
 precinct which would bring new work to
 the area. Heybridge has been a port, a
 farming centre, a canal and industrial
 complex and in the future..? Heybridge
 is nothing if it is not adaptable.{
