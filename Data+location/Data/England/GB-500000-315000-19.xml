		<title>19CHILDREN'S LEISURE</title>
		<content> All 36 Primary School children were   
 included in this survey, although only
 12 live in the block allocated.{TOYS. 
 Largely traditional favourites: dolls 
 (Action Men for boys), battery contro-
 lled model cars, teddy bears, bicycles
 and toy soldiers. The main innovations
 were computers and electronic games:  
 6 children had their own computers.   
{LEISURE ACTIVITIES.}Also traditional, 
 involving little or no expenditure    
 (except horse riding and swimming):   
 fishing, train spotting, Brownies,    
 Guides, riding bikes, playing outside,
 dog walking, writing stories, reading,
 drawing, colouring. Only swimming and 
 plane spotting involve leaving the    
 area. Activities may be restricted to 
 the area by lack of transport or by   
 children's ages (5 to 11) and the     
 general ethos of families living, from
 choice or otherwise, in a rural area. </content>
