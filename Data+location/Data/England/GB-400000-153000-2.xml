		<content> On Friday 3rd May 1985 St. Barnabas   
 School did a survey about the shops in
{Market Lavington.}There are 10 shops,a
 Co-op, Fruit and Veg, Post Office,    
 Newsagents, Spar, Hardware, Shoe      
 Shop, Drapers, Butchers and           
 Photographers.We also have a          
 Hairdresser, Bank, Library,four Public
 Houses, a Chapel and a Church called  
 St.Mary's.We questioned people from   
 11.00 am to 11.30 am as they came out 
 of the shops. It was discovered that  
 the Co_op was the busiest shop during 
 the time we were there. We questioned 
 48 people  all together.22 people     
 wanted a Chemist shop in Market       
 Lavington. Others said they would like
 a Cobblers and a Bakers. 8 people     
 liked it how it is.
