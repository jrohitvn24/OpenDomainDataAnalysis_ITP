		<title>05The Hamlet of Wheatcroft</title>
		<content>   Wheatcroft hamlet is mainly a       
 farming community with no industry in 
 Wheatcroft itself. The name Wheatcroft
 comes from,{"wheat"-}crops of wheat   
 and{"croft"-}area of land.            
   Wheatcroft is set in Crich Parish   
 with the oldest building being Cruck  
 Barn, at Beech Tree Farm built around 
 the mid 1400's. There is a small      
 Independent non-Conformist Chapel     
 although it has been closed for many  
 years, it is beleived to have been    
 established in the late 1600's.       
    One of the oldest families of      
 Wheatcroft was the{Kirkland family}who
 first came to Wheatcroft in 1545. In  
 1652 a{John Kirkland}of Wheatcroft    
 died and left a charity of 40         
 shillings a year for the poor of      
 Wheatcroft. This charity still        
 survives and makes a payment to people
 at Christmas.                         </content>
