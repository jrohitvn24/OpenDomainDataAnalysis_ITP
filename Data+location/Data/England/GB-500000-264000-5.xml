		<title>05Population of Melchbourne</title>
		<content> Melchbourne is a small village, with a
 population of about 100 people.       
 The structure of the population is    
 very unbalanced. There is well over   
 two thirds of the people of retiring  
 age and over.                         
 The village has only got 13 children  
 who are of school age or younger and  
 four of those are in one family.      
 Less than 30 households in the area   
 are economically active.              
 This pattern is unlikely to change as 
 there is no future developement       
 proposed in Melchbourne. The existing 
 properties if they were to become     
 vacant would not attract young        
 families, as they are in the main, too
 small or purpose biult for the        
 elderly.
