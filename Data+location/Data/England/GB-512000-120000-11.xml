		<title>11St. Mary's Church, Shipley.</title>
		<content> It was built 1125-1175 by Knights     
 Templars, of French stone brought up  
 the river Adur, on the site of a Saxon
 Church mentioned in the Domesday Book.
 The unusual "sacrificial" shaped Iron 
 Age stone in the porch indicates Pagan
 Worship.Features include double splay 
 Norman windows and fine stained glass 
 by Kemp. The most recent window, 1984,
 commemorates 50 years of the Shipley  
 Scouts. The Shipley Reliquary, of 13th
 Century Limoges enamel, stolen in 1976
 is replaced by a replica. The oldest  
 of the bells was cast in the church   
 yard. There is a memorial to Sir      
 Charles Merrick Burrell, Bart.,M.P.   
 for Shoreham for 52 years and an      
 alabaster tomb to the Caryll family   
 dated 1616. A Sarsen stone marks the  
 Composer J. Ireland's grave. The Queen
 attended a wedding at the church in   
 1952 shortly before her Coronation.   </content>
