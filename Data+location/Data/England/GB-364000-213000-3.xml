		<content> Sheep in the Forest are considered    
 picturesque by the tourists, a hazzard
 by motorists and an anathema by       
 gardeners. The owners are called      
 "Sheep Badgers" and claim Commoners   
 rights. They are a crafty band who    
 certainly Know just where their sheep 
 are when it comes to rounding up      
 time, for sale, but compensation for  
 damage caused by sheep is quite       
 another story.                        
{Forest sheep are hardy and have the   
{reputation of easy lambing and of     
{being good mothers. They are the most 
{efficient 'lawn mowers' and keep the  
{verges tidy and the undergrowth       
{down. Without the sheep the character 
{of the woodlands would certainly      
{alter but the mortality rate is high  
{and dead sheep and lambs beside the   
{roads are a common sight.
