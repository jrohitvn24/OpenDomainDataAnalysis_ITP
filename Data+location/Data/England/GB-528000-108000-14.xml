 Estate.The workforce has been cut by  
 75% in 14 years.In 1971, 4923 people  
 earned their living there.Now there   
 are just  1,247 with a further 360    
 rendundancies announced at STC.STC    
 buildings make up almost 1/3 of the   
 site.After October 1985 all that will 
 remain of what was Brighton's biggest 
 factory will be the 130 design        
 engineers working at a smaller site in
 Crowhurst Road.                       
 Chubb Cash Registers have been cutting
 back since 1978 and pulled out in     
 1982,transferring some workers to Hove
