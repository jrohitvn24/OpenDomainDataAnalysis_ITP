		<title>06       LIHOU ISLAND</title>
		<content> In 1971  my Grandpa helped when the   
 reconstruction of a{farmhouse}and     
 staff cottage in a walled garden were 
 completed externally,while internal   
 work was still in progress.  The      
 Farmhouse was approximately 31 feet   
 wide and 72 feet long.  Overall the   
 buildings had taken approximately Five
 years to complete.  Materials were    
 taken to the{island}by boat when the  
 causeway was covered, but usually     
 were taken in a trailer by tractor. In
 1961 the iSland was purchased  by     
 Colonel Wotton, and some years later  
 in 1974 he bought a small  flock of   
 rare{seaweed eating sheep}from the    
 island of North Ronaldsay in the      
 Orkneys. From 1939 to 1945 the Germans
 used the island as an artillery range 
 and destroyed the original farmhouse  
 and its surrounding walls. By{Martin
