		<content>     The block is  chiefly agricultural
 land containing the villages of North 
 Cave and Hotham and crossed by        
 secondary roads.   The M62 is nearby. 
 People from both villages commute to  
 work in Hull and Brough.  Hotham      
 retains its rural charm with one main 
 street, a post office, pub and two    
 large country houses.   Both villages 
 have becks and ponds.   Traffic       
 bustles along Westgate with its three 
 general stores and lots of houses.    
 Church Street and Nordham run parallel
 to this and are a mixture of old, new 
 and renovated properties.   The old   
 water mills lie between Church Street 
 and Nordham with the church  nearby.  
 Station Road was named before the     
 Hull-Barnsley line was closed and     
 links North and South Cave.   Some    
 villagers were born here, others have 
 moved here because of its attraction. </content>
