		<content> Pests on the farm are crows which are 
 a nuisance and one is shot and hung up
 to deter other crows in the barley.   
 Rabbits are also shot and there are   
 rats which the cats catch.            
     Mr Dyer has to get up at 6.30 to  
 milk the cows and he usually finishes 
 at 5.30. His son milks the cows in the
 evening. When they are making silage  
 or hay they all work until dark.      
     Mrs Dyer does all the paperwork,  
 she rears the calves and some lambs in
 the kitchen. When they are very busy  
 she takes meals to the fields for the 
 workers.
