		<content> Great Mills is a DIY store.I am       
 writing about the Great Mills on the  
 Hedge End, Herald Industrial          
 Estate.The employees there work from  
 9.00am until 8.00pm during weekdays   
 and from 9.00am until 5.30pm at the   
 weekend.Great Mills can tell if anyone
 is late because they have a clock-on  
 clock-off system where a  card is put 
 in a special clock when you arrive    
 which prints your time  of arrival and
 when you leave it prints your time of 
 departure.If you are late, 15 minutes 
 of pay are deducted.A DIY shop is     
 where you can buy tools and also      
 cabinets, doors,kitchen units,garden  
 equipment,paint,wallpaper,tiles and   
 most things you need for home         
 improvement.DIY means Do It Yourself  
 and is popular because it saves people
 money.
