		<content> EDINGTON COUNTY PRIMARY SCHOOL.-1985. 
         The school has 25 pupils,two  
 teachers,a part time secretary,two    
 dinner ladies (cooked meals coming    
 from Devizes),a part time cleaner and 
 a crossing patrol. Pupils begin school
 at 5 yrs and at 11+ move to secondary 
 education in one of the near-by towns.
 There is a mother's and toddler's     
 group in the village,and many children
 go to the pre-school playgroup before 
 starting state education. The most    
 important change to be seen in the    
 school is the high involvement of     
 parents.They now regularly assist the 
 teachers with transport to swimming in
 Westbury, reading practise, music,    
 needlework and cookery lessons.Their  
 fund-raising efforts also help to buy 
 extra items like computers and        
 cookers.During the past 108 years,    
 there have only been 7 headteachers.  </content>
