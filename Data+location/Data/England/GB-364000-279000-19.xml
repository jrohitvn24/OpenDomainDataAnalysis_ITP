		<title>19FARMER'S DAUGHTERS REPORT 1.</title>
		<content> Every morning at 7am my Dad gets up to
 feed the animals. Then he goes to his 
 building work. My Mum feeds her ducks,
 hens, geese and a goat. My Dad is a   
 self employed builder with a small    
 holding of about 25 acres. My grandad 
 also has the same amount of land. He  
 has 100 sheep and about 40 head of    
 cattle. We also have Rip, the sheepdog
 and Sam, the cat.                     
     When we are hay making we get     
 about 1275 bales, some of them silage.
 One year we put Rape on stony field   
 for the sheep. The field beside that  
 is called Twin Trees. Most of the year
 we use our fields for grazing. The top
 field is used by the Spring Vale      
 Rovers football club. We have two     
 Damson trees, four Apple trees and    
 three plum trees by the house and     
 lawns.
