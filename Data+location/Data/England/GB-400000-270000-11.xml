		<title>11My Family.</title>
		<content> In my family I have my Mummy and      
 Daddy, brother and sister, 2          
 cats,2 rabbits, and 10 chickens. On a 
 week day we get up and dress, have    
 breakfast and go to school. When we   
 get to school we have assembly then we
 do some work. We have our milk and go 
 out to play. At that time my Mum would
 be tidying the house, and Dad would be
 at work. When we are back in from play
 we sometimes watch a TV programme and 
 talk about it. By the time we have    
 finished talking about it, we would   
 have lunch. Mum would be having her   
 lunch and feeding the baby. We would  
 go out to play again and do some more 
 work. My brother would do some work   
 too. Then we go home. I would feed the
 pets, and watch some TV, and have tea,
 and go to bed.
