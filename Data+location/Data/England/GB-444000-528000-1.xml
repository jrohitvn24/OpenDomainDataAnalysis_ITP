		<content> The area which we are covering        
 consists mainly of countryside. There 
 are no villages.  The nearest there is
 to a village is the cluster of farms  
 at Brierton. The farms in the area are
 mainly mixed farms. There are 16 in   
 all including 2 chicken farms. Riding 
 is popular and there are 2 riding     
 schools.                              
 There is only one one major road      
 through the area. This is the A19     
 which runs from Newcastle to Teesside.
 Amenities too are few. There is one   
 public house,the Red Lion, a service  
 station and a car tuning centre.      
 Apart from the riding schools there is
 no organised recreation but           
 townspeople do use the area for walks.
