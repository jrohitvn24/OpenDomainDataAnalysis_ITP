		<content>         The Rector of the church is   
 called Mr.Cohen. He originally came   
 from Australia.Before he joined the   
 church he was a teacher.He studied for
 three years and then did a further    
 three years training as a curate.After
 six years he was ready to become a    
 Rector.He wrote to lots of different  
 Bishops in this country.Some of them  
 replied that he would not be suitable 
 for their parish.Then the Bishop of   
 Brentwood asked him to come and meet  
 some of the parishioners of North     
 Stifford.They asked him lots of       
 questions and then invited him to     
 become their Rector.                  
          There are many interesting   
 items in the church.On the wall there 
 are brass rubbings of people who had  
 been members of the church and were   
 now dead.One of these people was named
 Ann Latham.                           </content>
