		<content> Most farms in and around Colerne own  
 the usual farm animals, including     
 cattle, sheep and horses. They use    
 many modern machines on their farms   
 but still possess some old equipment. 
 They grow some of the most common     
 cereal crops like barley, wheat and   
 corn which are grown to help feed the 
 animals.                              
 Other crops which they grow consist of
 swedes, clover and potatoes. One of   
 the main problems in farming is the   
 birds; some farmers use the method of 
 cutting a piece of black plastic in   
 the shape of a crow, and hanging it on
 a stick so that crows and rooks think 
 it's a dead bird.                     
 A farmers day is long and tiring.It   
 starts at 5.45am-6.00pm but is longer 
 in hay making season. Nowadays a      
 typical farm has three  workers but   
 fifty years ago there would thirty.   </content>
