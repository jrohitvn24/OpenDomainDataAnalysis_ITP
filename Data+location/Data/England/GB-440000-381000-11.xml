		<title>11A day with the Taylor family</title>
		<content> heard a story and wrote. A. drew 2    
 pictures, had physical education,     
 wrote and read.                       
   At lunchtime, G. had sandwiches at  
 the building site. L. brought the     
 girls from school at 11.55, giving    
 them ham sandwiches with wheatgerm    
 bread and yoghurt. She took the girls 
 back to school 13.05.                 
  In the afternoon, G. did more glazing
 and some roof insulation from 13.05   
 until 19.30 with short tea breaks at  
 15.05 and 18.05.                      
   L. spent the afternoon ironing and  
 collected a prescription from the     
 chemist for Grandma.                  
   At school, J. finished writing and  
 had assembly. At break she played     
 "Kiss Catch". A. played with Lego     
 bricks, read, and did capacity work   
 (filling a bucket with bottles) before
 assembly (cont)                       </content>
