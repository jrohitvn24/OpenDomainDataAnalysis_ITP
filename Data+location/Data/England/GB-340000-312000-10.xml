		<title>10ATTITUDES OF FORD PEOPLE</title>
		<content>                                       
   It seems that{FORD}is a much loved  
 village by all of the people living   
 there, especially the old people.Those
 who have lived there all their life   
 like{FORD}as it is,with one village   
 shop and a nice church.But the younger
 people would like to see supermarkets 
 introduced into{FORD.}Some people     
 would like to see the{LEASOWES}with   
 better houses and the Recreation      
 ground replaced with better equipment 
 e.g. swings,slides and roundabouts.The
 old people would like to see more     
 street lighting.The mobile library is 
 used a lot by the old people and they 
 would like a speed limit through the  
 village and the junction with the{A458
  adjusted to make easier access to and
 from{FORD.}
