		<title>14THE BLACK HORSE INN, WHALEY.</title>
		<content>      Our pub is called the Black Horse
 Inn and it's in Whaley. About a year  
 ago we had extensions built and had it
 decorated. In our pub we serve meals  
 and John Smith's beers and lagers.    
      About three years ago my dad was 
 spring cleaning when he discovered a  
 bomb. The bomb was a mortar bomb and  
 it was live so we had to send for the 
 Police and the Bomb Disposal Team to  
 make it safe. They said that i could  
 have gone off at any time and it would
 have blown up half of our pub.
