		<title>01LOWER WHITLEY &amp; SHINFIELD</title>
		<content> This area can be roughly divided into 
 the area around Lower Whitley which is
 mostly residential &amp; heavily populated
 &amp; the area around Shinfield village   
 which is primarily agricultural land. 
 Much of the agricultural land has very
 recently been lost as the result of   
 the construction of the M4 motorway   
 which runs right across the area from 
 west to east;&amp; also the development of
 a vast private housing development in 
 the East of the area.                 
  Within the area are a number of very 
 important agricultural research       
 establishments whose findings are made
 available to many countries in the    
 world.There is also the European      
 Weather Centre which supplies         
 information worldwide.It is           
 interesting to note that what happens 
 in this small area could be of        
 world_wide importance.                </content>
