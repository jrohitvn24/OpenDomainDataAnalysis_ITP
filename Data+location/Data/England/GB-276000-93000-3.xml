		<content> Cheriton Bishop has one school. It is 
 a primary school which has 44 children
 and 2 teachers. When we are 11 years  
 we have to go to Queen Elizabeth      
 Comprehensive School at Crediton. We  
 have a big football field, a netball  
 court, 2 swimming pools including one 
 for beginners. My favourite lessons   
 are mathematics and art. At Christmas 
 we do pantomimes and have parties.    
 Each Summer we go for a weeks's camp  
 at Chagford. It is excellent fun. 12  
 children have school dinners. They are
 cooked in Exeter and brought in each  
 day by van. Most children prefer      
 packed lunches. The school day begins 
 at 9 am with one hour for dinnertime  
 at 12 noon and finishes at 3.30 pm. We
 play games with other schools. We are 
 doing a project about Norman England.
