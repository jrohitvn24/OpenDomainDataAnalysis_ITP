		<title>11Games Children Play</title>
		<content>  Small children use their{imagination 
 in the games they play. The boys      
 pretend they are heroes from          
 television programmes like the "Dukes 
 of Hazzard" or the "A_Team". In       
 summer, girls play handstand game     
 called "Ready, Steady, Handstand".    
 Here they land in different positions 
 on their tummies; one is called       
 "squashed tomato" and another, with   
 their legs wide apart, is called      
 "banana splits".                      
  They also play singing games with    
 actions. One is :"My mummy is a baker,
 yummy,yummy" (then you rub your       
 tummy). Another is: "My Daddy is      
 dentist, agh, agh, agh" (then you show
 your teeth). Some of these rhymes have
 lots of verses and end up with the    
 girls{lifting up their skirts! }
