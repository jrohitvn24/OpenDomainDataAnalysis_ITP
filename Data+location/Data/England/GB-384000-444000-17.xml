		<content>BUILDING MAINTENANCE                   
The Becon system,which stands for      
Building ECONomics,is for              
establishments such as schools,        
libraries and other centres to report  
building maintenance problems.If       
a problem occurs the head of centre    
rings up BECON and gives the required  
information,such as the address of the 
establishment, the nature and location 
of the problem and how urgent its      
repair is.The operative then feeds the 
information into the computer and the  
computer will select a suitable firm   
to rectify the problem.The operator    
then either phones up the contractor   
or if not too urgent sends the         
information by post. The contractor    
comes to do the work and the head signs
a slip to say  the work has been       
finished and is  satisfactory.
