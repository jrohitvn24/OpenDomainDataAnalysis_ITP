		<content>{Sir John Colfox}feels that the most   
 important building in the village is  
 the{church}because it is the oldest   
 building.                             
                                       
 Sir John, who owns over half of       
{Symondsbury,}has lived in the village 
 for 61 years.                         
                                       
 The live-stock on the land includes 4 
{dairy herds,}700{sheep}and up to 3000 
{pigs. }                               
                                       
 Sir John, likes living in Symondsbury 
 and if he didn't live there the       
 alternative would be heaven or not as 
 the case may be.                      
                                       
 He is pleased about the way the       
 village is running and he would not   
 like to change it.
