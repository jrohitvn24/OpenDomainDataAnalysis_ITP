		<title>17Nomansland, The Wicked Lady</title>
		<content> In the past Nomansland Common was a   
 place where highwaymen lurked. The    
 ghost of one is supposed to haunt the 
 Common. It is the ghost of Katharine  
 Ferrers who was born in Markyate in   
 1634. She married very young and was  
 bored so at night she went into a     
 secret room and changed into a highway
 man's costume and rode 12 km from     
 Markyate to Nomansland Common and held
 up coaches. She shot anybody who      
 didn't give her their money. One      
 night a guard on the coach shot her   
 but she managed to ride home. The next
 day one of the servants found her dead
 in front of her secret room. The      
 family were so shocked they wouldn't  
 bury her in the family grave. There is
 now a public house called The Wicked  
 Lady on the Common.
