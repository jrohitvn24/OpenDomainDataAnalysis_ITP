		<content>{The Annual Midsummer Wake}of the Lyke 
 Wake Club is held in the barn and     
 adjoining outbuildings at Potto Hill  
 Farm, the club's headquarters and home
 of Bill Cowley, Chief Dirger and his  
 wife Jean, Chief Witch. Dirgers and   
 Witches, those who have completed the 
 Lyke Wake Walk in 24 hours and wear   
 the black-and-silver coffin-shaped    
 badge, gather to celebrate midsummer. 
 The 40-mile walk over the N.York Moors
 was started by Bill Cowley and some of
 his friends in 1955. In 1984, 2534    
 people completed the Walk, 2343 for   
 the first time. The Cleveland Lyke    
 Wake Dirge is probably our oldest     
 dialect verse, its ideas being of     
 Norse origin. It begins:              
{"This yah neet(night), this yah neet  
{  Ivvery neet an' all,                
{ Fire an' fleet(flame) an' cannle leet
{  An' Christ tak up thy saul(soul)"}  </content>
