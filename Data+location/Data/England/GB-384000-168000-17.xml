		<title>17SCHOOLS IN CORSHAM</title>
		<content>   After primary school the pupils will
 then progress to a secondary school,  
 at the age of 11. As the differences  
 between the two schools are huge, it  
 would be an incredibly difficult step 
 up for the child, so in 1975 the      
 primary-secondary-school liaison was  
 brought into the area.The idea was to 
 let fourth year pupils spend a week in
 the Comprehensive school and get to   
 know what life is like. They would    
 get shown around and told what is     
 what.The pupils would be taught by    
 various teachers so that they would   
 get a taste of the subjects and get to
 know some of the teachers at the      
 comprehensive school.The pupils are   
 arranged into tutor groups,with a     
 group tutor. The main subjects are    
 Maths,English and P.E.The primary     
 pupils  get to do all of these        
 subjects.                             </content>
