		<title>02MEMORIES OF SKELTON</title>
		<content> Skelton today is a large, expanding   
 town. In 1920 it was a small village  
 surrounded by green fields and farm   
 land. It consisted of small cottages  
 and three rows of housing for the iron
 stone miners. Since the war three     
 council estates have been built and   
 many private developments. Everybody  
 knew each other in pre-war Skelton.   
 Today the population is too big. A    
 local event in Skelton used to be the 
 Monkey Parade. Teenagers from all     
 around would come to walk up and down 
 the High Street with the boys chatting
 up the girls. It used to be a romantic
 place on a Sunday. Today Skelton has  
 changed completely and many new people
 have come into the area. The old way  
 of life and community spirit of long  
 ago has gone.Horse drawn vehicles have
 given way to modern transport and new 
 way of life.(Mrs.Eileen Lowe b.1913)  </content>
