		<title>05THE SCHOOL FETE</title>
		<content> Some children brought frisbees to the 
 school Fete.It was Rebecca Burchell's 
 and Emma Dobson's birthdays on the    
 same day. Some children brought       
 umbrellas because it was raining.     
                                       
 P.C. Kitchen,Lydeard St. Lawrence's   
 rural area police constable was there 
 supervising the fire engine.          
                                       
 There was a big flop, a car boot sale 
 and a children's stall selling        
 pomanders, cocunut ice, cakes and     
 other things.                         
                                       
 Also at the fete we had plate gardens 
 and a competition to see who could    
 guess the name of a goat. The name was
 "Just William." There were cream teas,
 hotdogs, icecreams, cake stalls, plant
 stalls and a wool stall. There were   
 tractor rides too.                    </content>
