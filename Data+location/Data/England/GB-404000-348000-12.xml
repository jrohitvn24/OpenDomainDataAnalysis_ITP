		<title>12Cauldon Lowe School</title>
		<content>Cauldon Lowe School opened in 1846 and 
closed in 1980 along with the other    
small primary schools in the area. The 
children were transferred to           
Waterhouses First and Middle Schools.  
The building was sold and became the   
Staffordshire  Peak Arts Centre.       
Here are a child's memories of his     
early years at that school:            
I started to school when I was 5 and   
left when I was 8. In school there was 
a hall also used as the dining room.   
Another room with a partition down the 
middle housed two classes. There were  
two teachers. Outside there was a      
climbing frame and when the bell went  
we used to run outside and scramble to 
the top. We had a shed which contained 
equipment, including pogo-sticks and   
stilts. I was always good at pogoing   
but I always fell off the stilts.
