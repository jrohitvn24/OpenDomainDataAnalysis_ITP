		<title>17ECOLOGY OF PULBOROUGH.</title>
		<content> The plants living on the hilly part of
 Pulborough differ from those in the   
 River Arun valley. We scrambled down a
 steep slope to see the Brooks.The     
 ground was flat and marshy, with      
 long grass and clover. In the distance
 were a few trees, with some cows      
 grazing, and beyond the river rose the
 south downs. A ridge ran beside the   
 river, made by the mud dredged from   
 the river. Rushes and flowers like    
 Knotgrass, were in the field among    
 the different kinds of grass. In the  
 water were reeds, sedges and Water    
 Plantain. Up the hill near the school,
 the landscape was different. There    
 were hedges and many Hawthorn and     
 Elderberry trees, Nettles, Hogweed    
 and Thistles. There were fewer kinds  
 of grass than on the Brooks. We saw   
 Daisies, Dandelions, Speedwell, Vetch,
 Shepherd's Purse and Mayweed.         </content>
