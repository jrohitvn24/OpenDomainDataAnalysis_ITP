		<title>15  GREAT SUTTON WATERWORKS</title>
		<content>    When{water supplies}for Capenhurst 
 were needed Sutton Hall Water Works   
 was built. It covers 23 acres of land 
 but employs only 20 people. The water 
 is obtained from the{river Dee}and is 
 treated by activated{carbon and       
{chlorine}which is added to kill germs.
 A holding tank containing 5.5 million 
 litres of water is present in case the
{Dee pumping station}breaks down. It   
 takes 20 hours for water from the Dee 
 to reach our taps, almost of the      
 Wirral is supplied from here. It pumps
 out 120 million litres of treated     
 water every day to over 500,000       
 people. The works stores 50 tons of   
 chlorine in two large tanks. If any   
 escaped it could cause a{disaster.    
 Gorsthills School situated next to the
 works has a safety drill-just in case!
