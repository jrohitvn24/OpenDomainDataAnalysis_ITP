		<content>     On 11th June 1985 the school had a
 visitor Mr. Andy Bigg from Vancouver, 
 Canada. He had lived in Wrestlingworth
 as a child. The schools Admissions    
 Register dated his entry as 1923. Mr. 
 Bigg's father had been the Daily Mail 
 representative for Bedfordshire,      
 Camridgeshire and Hertfordshire. The  
 family had built a bungalow at Water  
 End and had owned one of the first    
 cars in Wrestlingworth. In time Mr.   
 Bigg had emigrated to Canada, where he
 had become a successful journalist and
 had owned his own newspaper near      
 Vancouver. He thought the village had 
 changed very little and left us for a 
 search for any fellow school mates who
 were still around.
