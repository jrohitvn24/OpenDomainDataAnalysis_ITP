		<content>   On Saturdays most people don't have 
 to work or go to school, which means  
 they can sleep a little later than    
 usual. Many take the opportunity to   
 take a family outing. Often that      
 involves a shopping expedition to one 
 of the nearby towns like Yeovil,      
 Blandford or Dorchester, but there are
 many fayres, fetes, and shows to visit
 Usually, dads spends the weekends     
 attending to jobs around the house or 
 the garden, and mums, because many    
 work, catch up with house work. The   
 children look forward to the Saturday 
 morning television programmes because 
 many cartoons are shown. If the       
 weather is fine, we often play on the 
 village green or recreation ground.   
 Many school children spend their time 
 on their own because they live so far 
 away from others.
