		<title>10Clearing the Canal to Ripon.</title>
		<content>    The{Ripon Canal Society}are trying 
 to clear the canal so that boats can  
 cruise to the middle of{Ripon.}A      
 mechanical digger is being used       
 to clear lots of rubbish, from bottles
 to large rocks. The major problem     
 concerning the reopening of the canal 
 in the area covered by this survey    
 is that of re-positioning the route of
 two pipes. These cross the canal and  
 are both about one metre above water  
 level. Such alterations require       
 careful planning and financial        
 backing.                              
    The Ripon Canal Society is         
 constantly looking for ways to raise  
 money for such ventures. At the       
 present time, it is collecting        
 aluminium cans which will be sold to a
 scrap metal dealer for a good price.
