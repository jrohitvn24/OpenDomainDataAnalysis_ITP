		<content> Nowadays Police are more modernised.In
 Edenham the Policeman are PC Clark and
 Pc Morton.Every so often the Police   
 come round Edenham in their Police    
 cars seeing that nothing has happened 
 the night before.At our School the    
 Police come and give advice to road   
 safety and they do cycling            
 proficiency.Sometimes Police come and 
 sit near the main road and take the   
 speeds of the cars.Once the           
 Policeman went to the coal merchant   
 over the road to the School because   
 there was a bent oil sign.Nowadays    
 some Policemen may be going on        
 bicycles because buying cars and      
 buying petrol to run the cars is very 
 expensive.On the main road near our   
 School there is a thirty mile an hour 
 speed limit.If the cars break the     
 limit they get fined by the           
 Police.They are caught in a trap.     </content>
