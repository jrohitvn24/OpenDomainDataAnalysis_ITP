		<title>10CARNIVAL IN CHAPEL-FRITH</title>
		<content>  Foresters in the ancient Royal Forest
 of the High Peak purchased land about 
 l225 &amp; obtained permission to build a 
 'chapel'in the forest.The church was  
 dedicated to the martyred Thomas      
 Becket &amp; the present building stands  
 on the site of the original chapel.The
 founding date-July 7th-became the     
 medieval fair &amp; later l9th century    
 "Wakes".Local industry took its       
 holidays at this time &amp; shops were    
 shut for a week while townspeople took
 their annual holiday.                 
 Now,the carnival is held on the       
 Saturday nearest July 7th &amp; the whole 
 town is involved.A grand procession   
 passes through decorated streets &amp;    
 events continue for a week.In l985 the
 visit of the carnival queen to the    
 parish church co-incides with the     
 760th anniversary of the founding-July
 7th.                                  </content>
