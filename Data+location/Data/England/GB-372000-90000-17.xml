  {9:}These DOUGLAS FIR are over 80    
 years old and are named after{David   
{Douglas}who introduced the seed in    
 1827. When crushed the needles smell  
 strongly of turpentine. The straight  
 timber was useful for ships' masts.

 our only common decidous conifer and  
 REDWOODS which can grow to 100 metres 
 in their native California.
