{Church Minshull}is a village situated 
 at a bend in the R. Weaver. It was    
 called Maneshale (Old english = nook  
 or corner) in the first Domesday book 
 The village is the centre  of the area
 in which agriculture, mainly{dairy    
{farming,}is the principle industry.   
 There are 286 people on the electoral 
 role,the main centres of population   
 being the village and the mobile home 
 site at Lea Green. So far there are   
 not too many{commuters}living here but
 there has been a noticeable increase  
 in the turn-over of property in the   
 last five years. We are concerned     
 that we should not become a  dormitory
 village but that we should retain our 
 rural character.The centre of the     
 village is a{conservation area}so     
 there can be only limited changes to  
 the buildings.                        </content>
