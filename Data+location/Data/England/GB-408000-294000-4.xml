		<content>  THE OLD WOODLANDS ARE BASICALLY OAK  
 WITH SOME SILVER BIRCH AND ROWAN.     
 THERE IS ALSO A REMARKABLY LUXURIANT  
 UNDERSTORY OF HOLLY FOR WHICH THE AREA
 IS FAMOUS, THERE BEING FEW OTHER AREAS
 IN BRITAIN WHERE HOLLY IS SO ABUNDANT.
 THE GROUND FLORA OF THESE WOODS IS    
 TYPICALLY HEALTHY AND INCLUDES        
 BILLBERRY, COW-WHEAT AND WAVY         
 HAIR-GRASS. THE OAKWOODS SUPPORT A    
 VAST INSECT POPULATION AND PROVIDE    
 NEST-SITES FOR BIRDS SUCH AS GREEN AND
 GREAT SPOTTED WOODPECKERS, NUTHATCHES,
 AND TREE CREEPERS.                    
 A NUMBER OF PLANTATIONS WERE          
 ESTABLISHED IN THE PARK DURING THE    
 19TH AND EARLY 20TH CENTURIES. THE    
 CHIEF SPECIES PLANTED ARE SCOTS PINE  
 AND LARCH TOGETHER WITH CORSICAN PINE,
 SPRUCE, BEECH AND OAK.RHODODENDRONS   
 OCCUR IN SEVERAL AREAS.
