		<content>   Of the twenty-one farms surveyed the
 total number of tractors owned was 39 
 giving an average of 1.86 per farm.   
 Other means of transport were cars    
 total of 28 average per farm 1.33.    
 Motor bikes 4 average 0.19 and cattle 
 trucks 6 average 0.25 per farm and    
 only one lorry.                       
  The houses in the village, a total of
 83, gave an average of only 0.81 cars 
 per house, so a conclusion can be     
 drawn that because of public transport
 available here, and used by 13        
 households car ownership is not so    
 high. There are only 3 motor bikes    
 owned in the village.                 
  One point to make to explain the     
 higher number of cars on farms is that
 they are working vehicles and help in 
 farm work e.g. pulling a trailer of   
 animals to weekly market at Newton    
 Abbot.                                </content>
