 1984.                                 
 The building has got very high

 cameras watch you as you enter the    
 main door.  They have five  cars but

 Cavalier is for speed.The under water

 special marksmen and eight special    
 constables. The main types of{crime}in
 this Area are petty crimes like       
 shoplifting and domestic quarrels;    
 sometimes there are a few big         
 robberies or a murder but these are   
{rare.
