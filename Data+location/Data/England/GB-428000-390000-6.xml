		<title>06A DAY IN MY LIFE IN LOXLEY</title>
		<content> I am 9 years old. I get up at 7.30am, 
 wash, brush my teeth and get dressed. 
 I have my breakfast, pack my bag and  
 walk to school. When the bell goes at 
 8.50 a.m. I go into the classroom. We 
 read while we have the register. Then 
 we do Maths and English. At 10.15. we 
 have Assembly. We sing hymms, say     
 prayers and have a story. Then it is  
 playtime. After playtime we do more   
 Maths and English. At 12.00. we have  
 dinner in the hall and then we play   
 outside until 1.15 pm. We go back into
 the classroom and have art and group  
 work when we  work at different       
 topics. Sometimes we play rounders. At
 2.15 p.m. it is playtime again. Then  
 we have music, literature, poetry and 
 drama. We finish school at 3.30pm and 
 go home. When I get home I sometimes  
 go swimming then I go home for  tea,  
 play and watch t.v. 9 p.m. is bedtime.</content>
