		<title>11RELIGION - PARISH OF EGMERE</title>
		<content> Norfolk is known for its many{ancient 
{churches.}Less known is that it also  
 has an extra high number of ruined    
 churches: apparently there are 240.   
 Many of these are to be found in      
{Norfolk's 'lost' villages}- villages  
 that had ceased to exist by the end of
 the Middle Ages. Egmere is one of     
 these and has{impressive church ruins.
 Though the{Nave}and{Chancel}have      
 almost disappeared,{the tower}still   
 stands to nearly its full height. The 
 tower is small, but is well built and 
 proportioned. It dates from the early 
 14th. century as does its neighbour at
 Gt. Walsingham. As a settlement,      
 Egmere now consists of just a small   
 group of estate cottages and a few    
 other isolated houses. It stands on a 
 plateau between the river valleys of  
 the{Stiffkey}and the{Burn.}It looks   
 ecclesiastically to Wells-next-Sea.   </content>
