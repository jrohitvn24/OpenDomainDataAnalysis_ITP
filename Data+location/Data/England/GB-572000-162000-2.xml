		<title>02BURHAM - CHURCHES JOIN</title>
		<content> In 1980 St. Mary's the Virgin Church  
 Burham was pulled down because it was 
 found unsafe after its recent five    
 yearly check and beyond economical    
 repair. After this decision was made  
 the Church's congregation started to  
 use the Methodist Church for the next 
 few years.                            
 After discussion between the two      
 Churches it was decided it would be   
 good for the community for this       
 arrangement of sharing the Methodist  
 Church to be made permanent. They     
 agreed to join together because of the
 size of the village and the amount of 
 people using the Church is few. Also  
 it would be fairly easy to carry out  
 because the villagers know each other 
 and in May 1984 a legal document was  
 signed to make the sharing of the     
 building official.
