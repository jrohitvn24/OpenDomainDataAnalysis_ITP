		<content> Sutton Park and Ninevah is            
 predominantly undulating countryside  
 mostly intensively farmed. The higher 
 land and fringes of valleys are wooded
 with a mixture of deciduous and       
 coniferous trees.                     
 Hopyards have completely disappeared  
 giving way to wheat, oilseed rape,    
 barley and oats and some fodder roots.
 One small area has apple orchards.    
 Sheep and beefcattle graze on         
 intensively grown grass.Silage is made
  rather than hay for winter feeding   
 in covered yards. Most sheep are      
 housed for lambing in the early months
 of the year.                          
 A riding schol with an all weather    
 facility is the only recreational     
 establishment besides the Public      
 House. The nursing home was converted 
 from a farm house and is privately    
 owned.                                </content>
