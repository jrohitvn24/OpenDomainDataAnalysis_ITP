		<title>17ATTITUDES IN HOLMER GREEN</title>
		<content>Through our questionnaire we discovered
that most people moved into the area   
for the following reasons,good schools,
friendly atmosphere,relatives living   
near by.Houses were comparitively cheap
,well built,they were close to business
and near to the countryside.Most people
like living in Holmer Green.Three      
people didn't like living in Holmer    
Green because of the lack of           
entertainment in the village itself.   
In response to the question:"Do you    
believe in God?" approximately 12%     
replied "No",18%,"Don't know" and 68%  
"Yes"and many of these would call      
themselves religious,although only one 
fifth actually belonged to a church.   
There were no professed members of     
faiths other than Christianity in our  
sample.Of those who did attend church  
the majority felt it important to live 
out their faith in daily life.         </content>
