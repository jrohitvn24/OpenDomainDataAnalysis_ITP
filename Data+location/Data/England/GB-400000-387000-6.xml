		<title>06THORNSETT SCHOOL,THORNSETT</title>
		<content> Thornsett C.P.School was built in 1878
 and it is dug into the moors.If you   
 look carefully you can see where they 
 started building the walls.The school 
 was built on a hill and if the tall   
 wall wasn't there the moor would just 
 fall down.When we have sports we have 
 to walk from our school to Derby field
 about a mile away.There are fields    
 surrounding us but we're not allowed  
 to use them.We have no gym in our     
 school because it isn't big enough,   
 our playgrounds are not very big and  
 they aren't linked together so to get 
 from one playground to another we have
 to go through our school.We have a    
 staff room built up in the ceiling    
 The old staffroom is now a T.V.room.  
 At the far end there is a bench which 
 we can sit on at playtimes.
