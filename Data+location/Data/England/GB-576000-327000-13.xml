		<title>13NEW HOUGHTON -HOUGHTON</title>
		<content> The name New Houghton refers to houses
 built in 1729 outside the Park Gates  
 when Houghton Hall was built,and the  
 old village near the church was       
 removed.As listed buildings the       
 exteriors of the houses must remain   
 unaltered but modernisation inside has
 reduced the original dwellings to     
 26.There are also 2 farms and         
 2 lodges.Until 1945 all of these      
 dwellings were occupied by estate     
 workers or pensioners. Today only one 
 third are needed by the estate , the  
 rest are let or unoccupied.They cannot
 be sold. The population of New        
 Houghton and Houghton Hall is 65. The 
 School, Post Office, Chapel and the   
 Social Club have all gone and the W.I.
 now meets in Rudham. There is still a 
 Bowls Club with licensed bar within   
 the park.
