  MOST FOODS ARE ALRIGHT BUT IF YOU    
 EAT TOO MUCH OF THEM THEY WILL BE BAD 
 FOR YOU.HYGIENE IS MOST ESSENTAIL     
 BECAUSE  LACK OF IT WILL MEAN ILLNESS 
 OR EVEN DEATH! IF YOU HAVE PETS IT IS 
 BEST TO KEEP THEM CLEAN OR THEY WILL  
 SPREAD GERMS, ESPECIALLY DOGS. WHEN I 
 DID A SURVEY I FOUND THAT OF 26       
 CHILDREN 25 SAID THAT THIS  COUNTRY'S 
 HYGIENE COULD BE INPROVED, I HOPE SO  
 IN THE FUTURE! EVERYTHING IS BAD FOR  
 YOU IF TAKE IT IN LARGE QUANTITIES.   
 FOR INSTANCE MATHS AND SLEEP! MOST    
 PEOPLE SLEEP FROM NINE TILL SEVEN     
 WHICH IS A GOOD TIME.EXERCISING       
 MAKES YOU FIT AND IF YOU ARE FIT YOU  
 ARE HEALTHY.
