		<content> There are a number of important houses
 in our area. There is April Cottage   
 which is probably the oldest house in 
 Ashton. It was built in the fourteenth
 century as a woodcutter's cottage.    
 It has a thatched roof and recently   
 has had an extension built. The       
 present Peel Hall was built in 1637.  
 King William III is known to have     
 slept at Peel Hall. There is a moat at
 the hall which is probably one of     
 Ashton's oldest links with the past.  
 Other notable buildings include       
 Mouldsworth Hall, the present         
 residence having been built on the    
 site of an earlier Tudor house; Ashton
 Heyes, whose history as an estate     
 dates back to the time of William the 
 Conqueror; and, Ashton Hall at present
 a modern arable and dairy farm.
