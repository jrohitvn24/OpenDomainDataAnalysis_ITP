		<content>   Farnworth has good connections by   
 bus and train with its two nearest big
 towns Bolton and Manchester.The number
 8 bus comes every 10 minutes at peak  
 times and every 15 minutes off peak.  
 They run between 5.30 and 23.00.      
   The local buses start at about 5.15.
 They are good for children and        
 pensioners who pay only 10p a journey.
 Some adults, who pay the full fare,   
 think that buses are expensive for    
 short journeys.                       
   The Bolton - Farnworth - Manchester 
 train runs every 30 minutes at peak   
 times and every hour otherwise.It is a
 little dearer but quicker by 17 mins. 
 than the bus.It costs 89p against 70p.
   Taxis are convenient but at Â£1.20   
 minimum they are dear for one person. 
 St.Peter's Way is like a motorway from
 Bolton to Farnworth. It connects with 
 the M 62 for Leeds or Liverpool.      </content>
