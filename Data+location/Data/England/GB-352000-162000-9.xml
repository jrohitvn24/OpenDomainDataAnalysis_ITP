		<title>09Community Life in Ridgehill</title>
		<content>   Although Ridgehill (Regil) is only a
 small village, its community life can 
 be compared with that of a small town.
   Village life revolves around two    
 groups - these are the Village Hall   
 Committee who organise numerous       
 social events in the new village hall,
 and the Conservative Association who  
 organise outings and parties. The     
 Crown Inn, to the north, is home to   
 six local skittle teams. It is the    
 local pub and also a small restaurant.
   In summer, there are occasional     
 cricket games and village competitions
 (long time residents against          
 newcomers). In winter, both young and 
 old toboggan in nearby fields.        
   There is quite a strong religious   
 background in this farming area and   
 there is a Sunday School. Recently a  
 Drama Society has been formed. For its
 size, Regil is a very active village! </content>
