  A small, but old part of these woods 
 comes into this section.  The area    
 studied was one which consisted mainly
 of oak trees, interspersed with       
 sycamore trees.  Rhodedendron bushes  
 also featured prominently.  There were
 a number of hazel trees present and   
 the ground around the trees was       
 covered with a mixture of bramble,    
 braken and grass.  Animals include    
 wood pigeons and squirrels.
