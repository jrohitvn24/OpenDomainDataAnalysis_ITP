		<title>03STREET END ESTATE</title>
		<content> The Baker-White family purchased      
 Street End Estate in 1860. The 1500   
 acres of farms, woods and parkland are
 now run as a family business. The     
 first Street End Place, built in 1700 
 fell into disrepair. It was demolished
 in 1962 and replaced the following    
 year by a one-storey residence. The   
 Coach House and buildings, with a wall
 of mathematical tiles, stables and    
 laundry still remain. The Coach House,
 now the Estate Office, was the Home   
 Guard Headquarters in the 1939-45 war.
 Behind the new Street End Place is the
 old walled garden with a 200 year old 
 mulberry tree. Part of the sundial is 
 from the original church, rebuilt in  
 1832. The gardens and grounds are open
 to the public once a year in the      
 Spring. The Estate owns the forge,    
 Forge Cottage and several dwellings in
 the village.                          </content>
