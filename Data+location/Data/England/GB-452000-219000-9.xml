		<content>The busy trunk road A43(T) between     
Oxford and Stamford,Lincolnshire,runs  
directly north and south through the   
parishes of Weston-on-the-Green and    
Chesterton. A planned extension of the 
M40 motorway from London to Birmingham 
is scheduled to be completed by 1989   
and the route of this motorway will    
also be north and south through the    
parishes,parallel with the A43 but     
approximately 2 Km. to the east. It is 
anticipated that this motorway will    
relieve the present heavy traffic use  
of the A43 which is currently averaging
12,500 vehicles a day.
