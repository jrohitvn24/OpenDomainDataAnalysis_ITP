 The pheasants are penned with their   
 wings tied to stop them flying away.On
 April 20th the first eggs arrive and  
 they are taken to incubators.The eggs 
 are kept in big incubators for 20     
 days,and are then moved to a          
 smaller,hotter one for 4,during which 
 time they hatch.The new chicks are    
 kept under an electric hen-this is    
 like an electric blanket and can keep 
 up to two hundred chicks warm at a    
 time.When they are six weeks old they 
 are taken to release pens for 4-6     
 weeks.May to August is a very busy    
 time-it is also a very worrying       
 time.The biggest worry is power       
 cuts,without  heat the chicks will    
 die in about 1 hour.As the chicks need
 constant attention,the gamekeeper only
 gets about 3 hours sleep every night. </content>
