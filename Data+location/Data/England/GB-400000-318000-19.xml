		<content>THE RIVER TRENT.                       
The River Trent rises in the hills of  
North Staffordshire and flows          
southwards towards Rugeley through our 
ever widening valley. It flows         
eastwards and then northwards from     
Staffordshire to enter the North Sea at
the River Humber. The valley of the    
Trent in Staffordshire is mostly       
pastureland and there are many villages
along it's banks. The river is crossed 
at Wolseley Bridge by the A51 and there
is a fine bridge designed in 1780 by   
James Rennie.                          
THE TRENT AND MERSEY CANAL.            
The canal was built to link the River  
Mersey with the River Trent at its     
navigable point south of Derby. It was 
built during the 1770's. The public    
meeting to discuss the idea of the     
canal with the local landowners was    
held at Wolseley Bridge in 1765.       </content>
