		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION,AGNES</title>
		<content> St Agnes is one of the smallest island
 in  Scilly. It is in the Atlantic     
 ocean.                                
 There is only one shop on Agnes and   
 that sells toys as well as food and   
 everything. We get our food from the  
 mainland because the Scillonian and   
 the helicopter comes from Penzance and
 brings our goods up and then the Gugh 
 boat brings our food and mail over to 
 St Agnes from St Marys. There is a    
 school on St Agnes with only seven    
 children. You start when you are five 
 and go to the secondary school on St  
 Marys when you are eleven. You board  
 at hostel from Monday to Friday.      
 StAgnes has beaches, open grassy      
 spaces and farmland. It has only a    
 tiny lane with very little traffic.   
 Most people own a boat.
