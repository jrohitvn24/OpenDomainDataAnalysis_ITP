		<title>15   Kerbie and Double Ball</title>
		<content>   Kerbie is played after school.      
 Kerbie is a very good{game}.A mixed   
 team of two people can play.Any ball  
 will do but a football is best.You    
 stand on the kerb and throw the ball  
 at the kerb opposite. If the ball     
 bounces back off the kerb you score   
 one point.If you catch the ball with  
 two hands you score two points. If you
 catch it with one hand you score five 
 points.The person who scores the most 
 points out of three games wins.       
   Double ball can be played in the    
 school yard or in the{street}.You can 
 throw the balls in the air or at the  
 wall.It's a{game}for girls.You must be
 fast for double ball because you have 
 to keep throwing the balls up against 
 the wall,and catching them every      
 time.One of the movements is{LEGGY.}  
 Leggy means you throw the balls under 
 your leg.                             </content>
