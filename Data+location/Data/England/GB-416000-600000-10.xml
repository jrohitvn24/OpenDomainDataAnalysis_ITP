		<content> There are many different clubs and    
 groups in Felton and Thirston.        
 Some are based in the Village hall    
 others are held in pubs and houses    
 Some clubs hold functions that other  
 people can attend(for fund-raising).  
 Because of the distances to the big   
 towns there needs to be a lot going on
 in the village.                       
                                       
 There are 2 Senior Citizens Clubs     
 organising activities and outings.    
 There is a Ladies Leek Club and       
 Vegetable Club at one of the pubs.    
 The proceeds from the annual show are 
 used to benefit the community.

 and darts teams from both pubs.The
