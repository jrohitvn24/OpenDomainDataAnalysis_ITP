 The May Day Fair is held on May Day   
 Bank Holiday once a year.The Fair is  
 held in the Triangle if the weather is
 fine,if it rains we usually hold it in
 the village hall,or the school.There  
 are lots of entertainments like the   
 Mayjorettes and the ceremany of the   
 crowning.there are stalls aswell which
 sell games and toys,you can also play 
 games on a stall to,like throwing     
 darts and getting a prize.Each class  
 from the school does an               
 entertainment.We raise the money for  
 school equipment.This fair has been   
 going on since the Queen Silver       
 Jubilee in 1977.                      
  There is also a Summer Fayre to      
 support the village hall.
