		<content> MILLOM PARK PLANTATION IS A LARGE AREA
 OF WOODLAND PLANTED SINCE 1950. A     
 LOCAL FATHER AND SON HAVE PLANTED OVER
 HALF A MILLION TREES TO FORM THE      
 PLANTATION AND HAVE MANAGED IT FOR THE
 EARL OF LONSDALE WHO OWNS THE LAND.   
 THE TREES ARE MAINLY CONIFERS         
 INCLUDING SPRUCE,LARCH AND PINE.THERE 
 IS ALSO A EUCALYPTUS TREE AND         
 ORNAMENTAL TREES LIKE RED OAK.        
  BESIDES THE MANAGER KEEPING GOATS,   
 GEESE AND GUINEA FOWL, AND PHEASANTS  
 BEING BRED FOR A SHOOTING SYNDICATE,  
 THERE IS PLENTY OF NATURAL WILDLIFE. A
 QUIET VISITOR MAY SEE RED DEER, ROE   
 DEER, FOXES AND BADGERS. THERE ARE    
 MANY BIRDS INCLUDING THE BRIGHTLY     
 COLOURED JAY AND THE SOARING BUZZARDS.
 MOST VISITORS CRASHING THROUGH THE    
 WOODS SEE NONE OF THESE.
