		<content>     {Ward's Garden Centre}was started 
 in 1968. They grow mainly heathers.   
 Some of these are sold to other garden
 centres. There are 14 staff but three 
 are part-time. The busiest days are   
 Saturday and Sunday.                  
      They sell garden furniture and   
 equipment as well as plants that are  
 bought mainly from Holland, Belgium   
 and Denmark. Every year Mr. Ward's    
 staff take cuttings from the heathers 
 and put them in trays. The trays hold 
 about 200 heathers. They are then put 
 in long arch-shaped greenhouses to    
 grow ready for selling.               
      Mr. Ward told us that more of his
 customers come to the garden centre   
 when the sun shines.
