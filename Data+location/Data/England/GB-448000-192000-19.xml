		<title>19Oxfordshire Schools Crisis.</title>
		<content>    The teachers in our school are     
 still refusing to supervise the       
 children at lunchtime. It could mean  
 thousands of pupils being sent out on 
 to the streets in towns around the    
 country because there is no one to    
 keep an eye on them. The teachers are 
 taking this action as a protest to    
 support their pay claim. In the       
 'Abingdon Herald' this week Mr. Ian   
 Nickless, secretary of the National   
 Association of Head Teachers said "To 
 have a head left with two or three    
 unqualified supervisors with 800-900  
 students is a crazy situation. In the 
 last couple of years heads have been  
 coming under increasing strain at     
 lunch-time."                          
    Teachers have been offered a pay   
 rise of over 5% but they feel this is 
 not enough especially as inflation is 
 currently running at 7%.              </content>
