 Cradley is a very busy place,there is 
 a lot of traffic on the roads and many
 people around the streets.It is a very
 untidy place.There are crisp          
 wrappers,chocolate                    
 wrappers,cans,broken glass from       
 bottles all over the                  
 place.Churches,schools and factories  
 have their windows broken by{vandals.}
 Thare are a few tramps like Jeff      
 hanging around in the{streets}and     
 asleep on benches.                    
   There are hundreds of{council houses
  -something like a third of the       
 population of Cradley live in         
 them.There is also a lot of waste     
 ground,where the council has knocked  
 down old houses.                      
   There are lots of garages and{petrol
{stations,}because 50% of the families 
 in Cradley own a car.                 </content>
