		<title>10Housing in Knockholt</title>
		<content> Housing in Knockholt has, in common   
 with so many villages, undergone a    
 tremendous change in the last few     
 years. Thirty years ago there were    
 comparatively few houses - all        
 cottages or larger mansions, many     
 built post-first world war.There are  
 many farmhouses, and one house with a 
 turf roof. Most houses are of flint or
 brick sometimes faced with Kentish    
 boarding and some made entirely of    
 wood. A few new houses have been built
 in recent years; some pairs of old    
 cottages have been made into one      
 larger house and many cottages have   
 been enlarged and "improved". Not all 
 are yet connected to main drainage and
 gas , though all have mains water and 
 electricity. One house, Scotts Lodge, 
 has a very old painting on an inside  
 wall and another, Portlands, has a    
 music room where concerts are held.   </content>
