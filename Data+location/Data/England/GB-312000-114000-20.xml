		<content> It is mostly family farms around here 
 about a hundred acres each. In the    
 main it is milk production in the     
 valley, and rearing cattles and sheep 
 on the hills. Some of the hedges have 
 been bulldozed down,but as far as I   
 can see the fields are about 4-5 acres
 each, and from here I can only see one
 ploughed field. Change and progress is
 the talk all the time with our men;   
 even our Milk Factory has changed its 
 name to St Ivel (Unigate) and in three
 years, two small farms over the road  
 from here have gone and only the      
 farmhouse is occupied.
