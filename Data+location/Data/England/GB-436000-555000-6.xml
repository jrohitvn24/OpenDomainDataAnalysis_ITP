		<content> Three major trends can be detected in 
 Sunderland's industry, all pertinent  
 to block D. Firstly, there is the     
 ongoing shift away from traditional   
 industries (shipbuilding and its      
 associated industries) towards other  
 forms of manufacturing. Associated    
 with this is the second trend - a     
 change in spatial emphasis away from  
 the river sides, towards more         
 accessible sites out of the centre of 
 the town and the block. Thirdly, there
 has been an overall decline in        
 employment in the town, related to the
 decline in traditional industries.    
 Evidence of industrial decay is very  
 apparent within the block, with many  
 disused factories and warehouses. Yet 
 more have been demolished and some    
 sites have been given over to         
 non-industrial activities.
