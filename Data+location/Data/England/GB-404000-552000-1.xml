		<content>                                       
 Our grid area encompasses part of     
 Shotley Low Quarter,which locally     
 is referred to as "The Snods",as      
 this is really the hub of life in     
 the Parish.&lt;it is by nature a         
 sparsely populated rural area>.       
 Within our grid there are only two    
 places that could be called Hamlets   
 and no real village.Shotley Field     
 with 9 dwellings is the largest       
 Hamlet,Snods Edge is the next         
 sizeable Hamlet with 4 dwellings      
 plus the Church and Parish Hall.      
 The rest of our area is scattered     
 farms and houses,a filling station    
 and a public house.Although physically
 very scattered there is an excellent  
 community spirit.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
