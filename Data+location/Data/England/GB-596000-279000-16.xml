		<title>16CLOTHING IN HOPTON</title>
		<content> People in the Hopton area are far less
 fashion conscious than city dwellers  
 and they tend to wear clothes for many
 years rather than buying new ones     
 every year.  Many people here buy     
 their clothes from mail order         
 catalogues rather than travelling to  
 the towns and cities. In 1985 a ladies
 casual summer outfit could be a cotton
 blouse with a skirt or dress to just  
 below the knee and gathered waist     
 with grey or brown tights. A man might
 wear cotton or denim straight-legged  
 trousers, a short sleeved tee-shirt   
 and a pair of light training shoes.   
 Winter styles are very similar to     
 summer ones, however the clothes would
 be made from wool or warm man-made    
 fibres eg. acrylan, with long-sleeved 
 jumpers.  In very cold weather people 
 wear scarves, gloves and hats with    
 their coats outside.                  </content>
