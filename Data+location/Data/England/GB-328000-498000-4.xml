		<content>    Our block contains the aptly-named 
{Coppermines Valley}(286987), which was
 an important centre for copper mining 
 until the end of the 19th century. The
 Mines Royal Company started to extract
 copper ore from the sides of the{Old  
{Man}in the 16th century. The ore was  
 transported by barge across{Coniston  
{Water}until the railway was opened in 
 1859. The workings are important      
 examples of industrial archaeology.   
    Slate quarrying developed in       
 response to the demands of the        
 industrial revolution, and has        
 recently undergone a revival because  
 of the aesthetic appeal of slate as   
 opposed to tile and concrete. Today   
 "green slate" is quarried at          
{Tilberthwaite}(312024), and there are 
 many abandoned workings in the area.  
 Lime was quarried for local use from a
 small outcrop by the A593 (309989).   </content>
