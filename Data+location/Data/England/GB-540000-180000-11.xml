		<title>11OUR NEW HOMES</title>
		<content> Nearly everyone in our school has     
 moved into a new house. All except for
 one short street of old houses have   
 been demolished. Many of them were    
 prefabs left from the war. So is our  
 school which is old and falling to    
 bits.                                 
 Newham Council, Comben, Wimpey,       
 Barratt, Brosley, Sellards, Goldings, 
 Hay &amp; Croft, Bennets, Wilmot, Jerams  
 are all busy building houses of all   
 designs, flats studio flats,          
 maisonettes all in pleasant red brick 
 with cobbled squares and closses. But 
 apart from a few shops there are no   
 other amenities. Even so, many people 
 are moving in. Not many houses stay   
 empty for long. We asked in school and
 found that 23 families lived here     
 before the new building, 59 came from 
 other parts of Newham, 5 from London  
 and 6 from abroad.                    </content>
