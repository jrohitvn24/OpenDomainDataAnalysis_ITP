		<title>16The King John Hotel</title>
		<content>  This is not a place with accommodat  
 _ion inside the building but opposite 
 the car park is a house that is let   
 out for weekends. This hotel special  
 _ises in{'Good Food' and 'Traditional 
{Ales'.                                
  The most popular drink is a tradition
 _al ale called{'Six X'}and the most   
 popular lunch is a{'Ploughman's Lunch'
 and people come a long way for it.    
   Most food is sold in the summer     
 because people come to see{Cranbourne 
{Chase.}Hikers use it a lot as well as 
 cyclists. Tollard Royal inhabitants do
 not so much because they find eating  
 out expensive. There is no children's 
 room but can use the garden. About ten
 years ago it changed from a hotel to a
 pub. one of the problems in attracting
 customers is the small car park. It is
 not as much a village pub as before.
