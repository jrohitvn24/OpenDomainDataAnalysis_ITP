		<title>07The Legend of St. Marwenne.</title>
		<content> Marwenne came to Marhamchurch in the  
 6th century to bring the word of God  
 to the villagers.She had great healing
 powers and  healed most of the sick   
 and brought peace to the village.She  
 arrived at the village in a rowing    
 boat having been pulled up river by   
 the tide to Hele Bridge.              
   She walked up the hill to the       
 village and built a hut where the war 
 memorial now stands.After a while the 
 villagers built a wooden church for   
 her.                                  
   Now every year the legend of        
 St.Marwenne is celebrated.The         
 children of the school vote for a     
 queen.She is not always the best      
 looking but the one that is most like 
 Marwenne.She has 6 attendants and a   
 marshaland page.The queen is crowned, 
 rides around the village on a white   
 horse and every-one will celebrate.   </content>
