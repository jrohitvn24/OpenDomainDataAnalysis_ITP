 sometimes and there are swings and    
 roundabouts for young children.Also on
 the park is an{indoor swimming pool   
 and a{squash club.}There are{football 
{pitches}which are very busy on a      
 Sunday. There are{primary schools}on  
 two sides of the park, St Martin de   
 Porres,which is Roman Catholic and    
 Ferrars Junior and Infant school.On   
 the other edge of the park,high on an
