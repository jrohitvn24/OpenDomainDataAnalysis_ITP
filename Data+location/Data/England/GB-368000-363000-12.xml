		<title>12HEALTH AND THE FOOD WE EAT</title>
		<content>{NATURAL FOOD.}In Wimboldsley most     
 families grow food because we have    
 large gardens.We grow beans, potatoes,
 carrots, cabbages, cauliflowers, beet 
 root, lettuces, and spinach.We grow   
 our own fruit including strawberries, 
 rhubarb,raspberries, apples,tomatoes, 
 blackcurrants,and tomatoes.We make    
 pies and gateaux with them and store  
 in our freezers.                      
{ADDITIVES.}Beef crisps contain no real
 beef, just chemical flavouring.Two    
 antioxidants stop the crisps going off
 they are numbered (E320)and(E321).At a
 local food factory RHM, gravy granules
 sauce mixes and salt are made.        
{DISEASES}can be connected with what we
 eat.This can effect heart and liver if
 we eat too much of some chemicals, fat
 or salt.We are not sure of this, so   
 scientists today are trying to find   
 out more about healthy eating.        </content>
