 Young teenagers have caused havoc on  
 the Â£600,000 Paston Ridings new       
 travellers and gypsies site.These     
 young vandals have:                   
 Stolen Fire extinguishers and thrown  
 them into a ditch,                    
 Taken apart fire alarm bells,         
 Ripped up trees and landscaping work, 
 Smashed a concrete fence panel.       
 The site was newly opened last month. 
 There are 50 caravan/car stands, in   
 between which are small brick-built   
 houses with all the usual amenities.  
    Most travellers and gypsies who are
 on the site came there because of the 
 new power of the council which allows 
 them to move caravans parked where    
 they shouldn't be.
