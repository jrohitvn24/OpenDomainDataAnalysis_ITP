		<content> The large kitchen garden,so essential 
 an adjunct to country houses of       
 previous centuries,has largely been   
 grassed over with shrubs incorporated 
 in order to make the maintenance of   
 the walled garden as easy as possible.
 Each generation has its own problems. 
 This generation has tried to preserve 
 this house and its landscape in the   
 context of its own time in the hopes  
 that future generations,in the context
 of their time,will have something     
 which they too may be able to preserve
