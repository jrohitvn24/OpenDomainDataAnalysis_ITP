		<title>02CHOOSING A COUNTRY LIFE.</title>
		<content> Daniel and James decided to find out  
 about how the population has changed  
 in our {D-Block}over the years.We     
 wanted to find out how long people    
 have lived in the area and their      
 reasons for choosing to live in a     
 rural environment.Most people in      
 Easthorpe said they liked living in   
 the area because it has a friendly    
 community and it is peaceful and is   
 out of the town and in the            
 country.Some people said they don't   
 like it because there are not very    
 many facilities,for  example no       
 shops.The average length of time for  
 living in that area is round about 16 
 years.Most housing in the area was    
 built prior to the war.In Easthorpe   
 there are still some prefabricated    
 dwellings.There is also an estate in  
 the area that is 15 years old.
