		<title>09MOTTRAM VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   The present school building at      
 Mottram was constructed at the        
 beginning of this century. At first it
 was an all age school, but in the     
 1940's became a county primary school.
   At present there are 52 children on 
 roll ranging in age from 4+ to 11.    
 Only 1/3 of the children come from the
 village and official catchment area.  
 The remainder come from the           
 surrounding towns of Alderley Edge,   
 Wilmslow and Macclesfield _ the       
 parents of these children opting to   
 send their children to a village      
 rather than a large town school.      
    The teaching staff comprises of a  
 head, two full_time teachers and one  
 part_time teacher.There is a          
 caretaker, a cook and canteen         
 assistant, and three mid day          
 assistants.
