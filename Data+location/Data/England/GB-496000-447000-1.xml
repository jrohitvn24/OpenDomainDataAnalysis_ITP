 The area covered in our Domesday      
 survey is a rural area consisting of  
 three villages, Lockington,Lund and   
 Kilnwick and a number of farms.There  
 are natural woodland areas and        
 plantations which are quite new.The   
 block is situated between two main    
 roads which lead to Malton and        
 Driffield.The villages each have their
 own church and there are chapels in   
 Lockington and Lund.There are public  
 houses in Lockington and Lund but not 
 Kilnwick.Recreational facilities are  
 few although there is a sports hall in
 Driffield seven miles away.A bus      
 service runs through the area but     
 there are no railways.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
