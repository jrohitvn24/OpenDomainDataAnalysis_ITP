		<title>04A D.I.Y. SHOP IN CROSSGATES</title>
		<content> In our{Arndale Centre}we have a newly 
 opened hardware store called{         
{Wilkinsons.}The manager told us about 
 why he opened the store in our area.  
                                       
 Firstly he told us that a population  
 of 20,000 people must live in the area
 to make the shop worth while opening. 
 When finding a suitable place for the 
 store these things must be taken into 
 consideration;-the shop must be within
 a radius of 80 miles of their head    
 office,the type of area in which the  
 shop is to be situated and the size of
 the shop unit that is available. The  
 weather affects the types of products 
 that customers will buy. 8,500 paying 
 customers pass through the store every
 week with  average weekly takings of  
 Â£17,000. The store employs 28 staff to
 run the shop efficiently.             
                                       </content>
