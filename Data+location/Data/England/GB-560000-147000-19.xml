		<title>19The Medway</title>
		<content>  In the bottom four squares of our    
 area runs the River Medway.On either  
 side of the river are fields and      
 woodland.In the fields grow wheat,    
 oats,barley,rape and grass.Some of the
 fields are used as rough grazing      
 land.Bulls and cows are grazing there.
  People use the river for fishing,    
 canoeing,pleasure cruising and for    
 walking by.                           
  In our area there are two locks that 
 have just had their fittings painted  
 green and white.If you are very lucky 
 you might see a boat go through them. 
  A lot of dykes run from the river,and
 these are crossed by small bridges    
 which have bars across them to stop   
 the cattle getting into the fields of 
 crops.There are a lot of wild flowers 
 and insects by the river.There are    
 also a lot of pill boxes from the war.
