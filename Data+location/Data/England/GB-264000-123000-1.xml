		<content> Our area of twelve square kilometres  
 is covered with fields. The fields are
 mainly grass fields for growing silage
 and hay, or grazing cows and sheep.   
 Some crops are grown in the area,     
 mostly barley and swedes for animal   
 feed, and potatoes.                   
 There is a small river, the{River     
{Bray,}running down the east side from 
 north to south. It is about five      
 metres wide at{Clapworthy Mill,}and   
 about half a metre deep. Salmon, trout
 and sea-trout are caught in the river.
 Seven streams run off our area into   
 the River Bray. Three other streams   
 flow west towards the River Taw.      
 There are very few people living in   
 the area because there are no villages
 or towns. Most people either work on  
 the farms or work in South Molton     
 which is nearby, to the east.
