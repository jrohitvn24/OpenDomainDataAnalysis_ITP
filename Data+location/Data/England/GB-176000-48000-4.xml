		<title>04ALLET FARM, NEAR TRURO.</title>
		<content> This farm consists of only 20 acres in
 6 fields, since the sale of some land 
 in 1966.  The present owner is a semi-
 retired 75-year-old single man who    
 requires considerable help from his   
 neighbours, who take care of his      
 shopping &amp; transport.  He is, however 
 able to cook &amp; clean, &amp; do what is    
 required in looking after up to 10    
 horses which he keeps on his land for 
 a friend who runs stables for pony-   
 trekking near Perranporth.  He treats 
 the horses as pets &amp; obviously enjoys 
 their company.Some hay is produced for
 his own use; this is harvested for him
 by local contractors. Good stabling is
 available but is only used when there 
 is a rare spell of severe weather.  No
 other enterprise is undertaken but he 
 grows all his own vegetables &amp; makes  
 full use of his 24 by 12ft.greenhouse.
