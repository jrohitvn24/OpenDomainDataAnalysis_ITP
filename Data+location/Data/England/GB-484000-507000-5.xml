   Sleights is on the Whitby to        
 Middlesborough line.  It is served by 
 14 trains, seven each way every day   
 from Monday to Saturday.  During      
 summer, there are 4 trains each way on
 Sundays.  There are no Sunday sevices 
 from September to May.  The line is of
 little importance to the national rail
 network, it being one of the country's
 few surviving branch lines.  It is    
 single tracked and operated by diesel 
 multiple units for the passengers,    
 there being no freight service.       
 Although the people of the area use it
 relatively little, it is used to carry
 most of the secondary school children 
 into Whitby and back, morning and     
 evening, serving Eskdale and Whitby   
 Comprehensive schools.
