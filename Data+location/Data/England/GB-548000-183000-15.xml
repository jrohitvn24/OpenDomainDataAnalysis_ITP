 the Civic Centre,my brother goes to   
 Marsh Green primary school and I go to
 Dagenham Priory school.               
 We live on Oval road South.We usually 
 go around to my Grand-fathers every   
 month or so.On Saturdays I usually go 
 with my dad to his factory which is in
 Dagenham.                             
 Our house is a semi-detached house,it 
 has double glazing.My uncle lives next
 door to us so we have joined the two  
 gardens into one large garden.
