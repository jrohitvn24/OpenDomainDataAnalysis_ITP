		<title>17Sandringham Flower Show</title>
		<content> The Flower Show takes place annually  
 at the end of July. It is always      
 visited by H.M. The Queen Mother and  
 often other members of The Royal      
 Family.                               
                                       
 In the main, the horticultural cups   
 and trophies are competed for by the  
 people of the Estate villages, but    
 there are a number of open classes,   
 which attract entries from the        
 surrounding area.                     
                                       
 The Park is alive with stalls selling 
 all manner of goods from furniture to 
 dolls' houses and there are side-shows
 and entertainments for all.           
                                       
 All day long the millitary band plays 
 from the band-stand, while Morris     
 Dancers can often be seen dancing in  
 front of the beer-tent.               </content>
