		<content>  Dairy products can all be bought from
 supermarkets for economy and          
 convenience, although there are also  
 daily milk deliveries in the area.    
 Cheese can be bought prepacked or     
 loose.                                
 Fruit and vegetables, if not homegrown
 are bought at a greengrocer's or a    
 supermarket. It is possible, however, 
 to buy produce in season from roadside
 stalls, which are usualy of excellent 
 quality and value, although a regular 
 supply from such sources cannot be    
 guaranteed.                           
 Eggs can be purchased at a variety of 
 shops, depending on whether battery or
 free-range eggs are preferred.        
{SHOPPING IN NORTH NORFOLK}            
 Fish is bought at a specialist fish   
 shop. In the coastal villages there   
 are often stalls if a fisherman has   
 made a good catch.                    </content>
