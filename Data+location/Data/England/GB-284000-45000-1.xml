		<content>{     Strete}is a village(SX842468)    
 overlooking Start Bay,built upon      
 Dartmouth slates.As the name suggests 
 the settlement is basically one long  
 street on the Dartmouth-Kingsbridge   
 road.Though a long established        
 village, in recent years a change in  
 character has occurred with a larger  
 population but loss of services and   
{"community spirit". }                 
 Life-long inhabitant, Mrs.Parnell,    
 believes the community spirit was     
 destroyed in the 1960's when an estate
 of seventy bungalows was built,in the 
 1980's a further thirtyfive flats were
 added.The new inhabitants were mainly 
 retired people, who have altered the  
 age structure of the village.As a     
 consequence only about 30% of the     
 villagers are of working age &amp; only 12
 to 15 children of school age.Many new 
 villagers have their own transport.   </content>
