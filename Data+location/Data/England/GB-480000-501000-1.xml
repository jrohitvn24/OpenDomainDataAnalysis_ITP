		<title>01Goathland Moorland</title>
		<content> The inhabitants of this moorland Hill 
 area number about 500. The main       
 dwelling area is the village of       
 Goathland. The rest of the are        
 contains small hamlets, outlying      
 cottages and farms. The area is       
 totally unspoiled even though tourists
 have discovered it's beauty and       
 tranquility. There is a wealth of     
 flora and fauna to be studied. Sheep  
 farming and a small amount of arable  
 farming is carried on here. The       
 preserved north Yorkshire moors       
 railway proves to be a great tourist  
 attraction, the scenic route and the  
 thrill of travelling on a steam train 
 drawing many people to the moors      
 during the spring, summer and autumn. 
 The rural way of life has been        
 maintained by the holding of country  
 fairs and produce shows.
