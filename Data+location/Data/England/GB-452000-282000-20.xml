		<content>     Moorbarns Farm is owned by Mr.    
 Boyes. It is a{Mixed Farm}of 370      
 acres. There are fields of{rape,barley
{and grazing.}The seeds are bought each
 year.Mr. Boyes has 25 friesian        
 bullocks, 155 lambs, 160 ewes and one 
 Hereford bull. The cows produce 290   
 gallons of milk a day when they are   
 milked by machinery in the milking    
 parlour. Bullocks, sheep and lambs are
 taken to be killed at a butcher's or  
 slaughter house every year.           
     As well as the haybarns, animal   
 sheds and farmhouse, there are        
 machinery sheds containing Â£70,000    
 worth of farm machinery such as       
 tractors and a combine.               
     Farming is a round-the-year job   
 and when our class visited the farm we
 saw sheep being sheared. It was a good
 job it was warm or the sheep would get
 very cold.                            </content>
