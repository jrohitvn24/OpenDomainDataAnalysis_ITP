		<content>     This is an ancient settlement,    
being set on "War Hill".  Its original 
boundaries covered Longendale and east 
It is set at the head of all the       
important Pennine routes and thus      
became a thriving community service.   
However all that now remains is the    
"Pack Horse Inn".                      
   The woodland was mentioned in the   
previous Domesday Book, but was only   
stated as being fit for hunting.  Yet  
it was both this and sheep rearing that
continued to dominate the local        
economy.                               
    With the introduction of rail and  
road networks to the nerve centre of   
steel, Sheffield, Mottram and the      
surrounding areas were dragged into    
industrialisation.
