		<title>03SOMERSHAM CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The church has only two bells.On the 
wall is a small cabinet,inside it is   
what looks like a bell but actually it 
is in fact a bomb which landed near    
the church in World WarI.The door to   
the church is very old,there are marks 
where once studs were.On the wall was  
a fragment of picture.There used to be 
pictures all around the church.There   
are two paintings,one of Moses and one 
 of Arran.                             
  On the outside of the church is an   
old sundial which the vicar used to    
time his services by.The wood on the   
porch is very old and has been         
preserved in animals blood as it has   
salt in it.This vicar is also the      
vicar of Somersham,Flowton,Offton and  
Willisham churchs.He said he liked his 
job because he served God and he likes 
working with other people.This church  
was mentioned in the Domesday book.    </content>
