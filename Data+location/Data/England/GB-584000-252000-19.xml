		<title>19Lawshall Area in General.</title>
		<content>This rural area lacks many of the town 
facilities-there are no street lights  
and although most homes have electric- 
ity,mains water and sewage connections,
some older properties in outlying areas
are without these services. There is no
gas supply at all.Essential services   
such as ambulance,fire,police,doctors, 
dentists,banks etc. are 15 minutes     
drive away. However,the countryside has
a peaceful and calm way of life, the   
hustle and bustle of town does not     
exist here,people are more relaxed and 
have time for each other.Suffolk people
are very friendly and sociable,a charac
-teristic very noticable to anyone mov-
ing into the area-and as long as you   
return the friendliness you are very   
soon accepted as part of the community.
Although there is a saying hereabouts, 
you're not considered a local until you
have lived here 20 years!              </content>
