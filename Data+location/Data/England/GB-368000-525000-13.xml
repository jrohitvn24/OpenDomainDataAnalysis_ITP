		<title>13ART AND CRAFT IN DUFTON</title>
		<content> There are several artists amongst the 
 inhabitants of Dufton.3 or 4 go to a  
 weekly art class in a neighbouring    
 village.Pictures are mainly local     
 views done in watercolours and        
 occasionally in oils.                 
 At least 3 people devote a great deal 
 of time to sewing:1 to American patch-
 work and quilting,1 to various forms  
 of embroidery (which she also teaches 
 at evening classes), 1 to a variety of
 crafts with needle, knitting &amp;        
 modelling.Work from all these are     
 exhibited in the local annual show.   
 Materials are mostly bought locally,  
 but for patchwork Laura Ashley cottons
 are bought direct from the factory.   
 Ideas and patterns are found in       
 magazines and pattern books, or are   
 own-designed or may be a traditional  
 craft like corn dollies or crochet.
