		<title>12College Farm</title>
		<content> College farm is a 3OO year old 3OO    
 acre mixed farm.   The crops grown are
 barley, wheat and grass.   British    
 Fresian beef and dairy cattle are     
 reared.   E.E.C. membership has caused
 the farm to focus on dairying as      
 market gardening became unprofitable. 
 Mechanisation on the farm consists of 
 three tractors, a plough, a disc      
 harrow, a cultivator, a roller, a seed
 drill, a fertilizer spreader, a       
 combine harvester, a hay trimmer, a   
 double chopping mower and a bale      
 carrier.                              
 The milk parlour is a 5/5 herring     
 bone.   The cows are milked twice a   
 day and the Milk Marketing Board      
 collects the milk every day.          
 Great care is taken when applying     
 fertilizer and pesticides to avoid    
 river pollution and straw is only     
 burnt on calm days.                   </content>
