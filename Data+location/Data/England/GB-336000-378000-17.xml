		<title>17  Housing - Eastham,Hooton</title>
		<content>    In Eastham and Hooton there are    
 many different types of houses.       
    If you travel into Eastham Village 
 you will see rows of cottages,        
 particularly near the church.Some of  
 these are very old.There are also rows
 of Victorian terrace houses where the 
 front doors are separated by a        
 wall.They were built like that to stop
 the women gossiping on the front step.
    Very recently, old stables near the
 church have been modernised and made  
 into new cottages.                    
    There is also a variety of private 
 housing, mainly semi-detached and high
 priced detached.                      
    Hooton is only a small place and   
 most of its housing is private.These  
 consist of terrace houses,semi-       
 detached and detached which vary in   
 price considerably.
