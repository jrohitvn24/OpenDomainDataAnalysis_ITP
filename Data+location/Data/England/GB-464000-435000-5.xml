		<title>05 Riccall Airfield Today</title>
		<content>If you go there today, you can see all 
the broken lights at the side of the   
runway. You can still see the runway   
rings where aeroplanes were fastened.  
There are also bomb shelters. The      
airfield sheds are now used by farmers 
for storing fertilisers and machinery  
and-thanks to the darkness -to grow    
potatoes. There is a large air raid    
shelter under an artificial hill. The  
entrances are often flooded.Skipwith   
Common Nature Trail crosses runways 2  
and 3 and the sites of wartime bomb    
stores. Most of the concrete has been  
removed from the large runway number 2.
Some farmers have dug up cartridge     
cases. Bullets can be found with metal 
detectors. Aeroplane glass is          
occasionally found in ploughed fields  
by local children.
