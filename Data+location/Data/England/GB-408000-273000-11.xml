		<title>11Earlswood  Lakes</title>
		<content> Earlswood Lakes were completed in     
 1823.They were built as a feeder for  
 the Stratford on Avon canal. The locks
 were being used frequently. At this   
 time Stratford needed to buy water    
 from Worcester and Birmingham canal.So
 they decided to build their own       
 Reservoir. Earlswood Lakes consists of
 three lakes: Windmill Lake which is 40
 acres, Engine Lake which is 30 acres, 
 and the Nature Preserve which is 15   
 acres.The Lakes contain 14000         
 lockfulls of water so it is possible, 
 in theory, for 14 000 barges to pass  
 through the Stratford on Avon canal   
 before needing to buy water. The water
 was pumped by a steam beam engine     
 which was replaced in the 1930's by an
 electric pump. 2000 lockfulls can be  
 used by gravity. Today the lakes are  
 used purely for leisure such as       
 boating, fishing and birdwatching.    </content>
