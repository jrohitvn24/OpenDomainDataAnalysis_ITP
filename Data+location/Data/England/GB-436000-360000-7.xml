		<content>  Another change is that the{Common    
{Market}is to drop the beef premium    
 which gave farmers an extra 10% on the
 value of certain graded carcasses.    
 There may be variable sheep premium.  
 There is the benefit of the market in 
 Europe for cereals.                   
  Other new ideas are{growth promoters 
 for beef cattle. {Silage}is used      
 instead of hay, making it easier to   
 feed bigger herds. It is better       
 quality and grass cutting can be done 
 earlier. This has been important this 
 year because we have had so much rain.
  There is a trend for more{economical 
{farming}and there may be a quota for  
 grain in the future. There seems to be
 a general cutting out of smaller farms
 and family farms and a concentration  
 on large economically run farms. The  
 National Farmers' Union is trying to  
 help small farms.                     </content>
