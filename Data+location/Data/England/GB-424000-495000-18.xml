		<content>{Oran Hall}is situated to the south of 
 Catterick Village on the southern edge
 of R.A.F.Catterick.It is close to the 
 A1 and surrounded by trees.           
 Oran Hall was the home of the Booth   
 family during the 19th and early 20th 
 centuries.                            
 The Booth family are said to have had 
 interests in cattle farming in South  
 America.                              
 There are many references to the Booth
 family on the walls of Saint Anne's   
 Parish Church in Catterick Village.   
 The church bells were donated by one  
 of the family.                        
 At present Oran Hall is divided into  
 flats for R.A.F.Officers.
