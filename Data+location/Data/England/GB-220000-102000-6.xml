		<content> Every acre of land that could be used 
 would be.Fertilisers were used in the 
 hope of getting a better yield in     
 grass and corn corps.Most farmers     
 aimed to be self sufficient in their  
 crop growing but some managed to sell 
 corn and bought straw.Some milled     
 their own corn but still needed to buy
 in balanced meal for dairy cows.      
    There was one horticultural        
 establishment with a retail outlet in 
 the nearby town.This grew vegetables  
 and produced local cider buying in the
 necessary raw material.               
   Numerous farms allowed fields to be 
 campsites on a short term basis in the
 height of the holiday season.Many     
 had holiday cottages to let.
