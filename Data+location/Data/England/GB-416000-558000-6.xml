		<content>   On 25th June 1985 Lindsay, Faye and 
   Esther went with Mr Pearson in the  
   car to see the types of houses in   
   our block, and when they were built.
   we had 12km squares in our block to 
   look at.                            
   The oldest house which we saw was  a
   farmhouse which was made from stone.
   It is about 150 years old.We went   
   down a bummpy road and saw a pair of
   two storey  rubble stone houses with
   a pantile roof.They were probably   
   built in the late eighteenth        
   century.                            
   In Rowlands Gill we saw some        
   terraced houses built for the mining
   community at the turn of the        
   century.We also saw some bunglows   
   for the miners which were built in  
   1923.These houses were built for    
   retired miners by the owner of the  
   mine.                               </content>
