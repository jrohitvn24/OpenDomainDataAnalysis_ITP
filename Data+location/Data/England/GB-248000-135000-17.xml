		<title>17The Resevoir.</title>
		<content> On the{2nd September 1940,}a member of
{Braunton Parish Council}wrote to      
{Barnstaple Rural Council,}telling them
 that they had had many complaints     
 about the shortage of water in        
 Braunton. With the evacuees from the  
 cities,a result of the{2nd world war, 
 there was not enough water for people 
 to use.The old resevoir could not cope
 with this influx. So a new resevoir   
 had to be built. This was done after  
 the war ended. Today, the resevoir is 
{the only source of water}in the       
 village. Although Braunton gets{heavy 
{rainfall in winter,}the fact that it  
 is the main source of water, means    
 that there is always{a water}shortage 
 in summer. This leads to{restrictions 
{such as a ban on the}use of hosepipes,
 and in extreme cases standpipes on the
 streets after water to homes has been 
 entirely cut off.                     </content>
