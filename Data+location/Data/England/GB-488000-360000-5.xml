       In the past,until about 30 years
 ago, most farm equipment was made from
{wood.}For example, farm carts and     
 fencing. Today{farming}is more        
 mechanised and most of the machinery  
 is made from{metal.                   
       Over the years the Wheelwright  
 and Joinery Business, which has       
 existed in the area since 1740, has   
 gradually changed to general household
 joinery, reshafting hand tools and    
 making items of furniture.            
       In recent years, a small{metal  
 business developed. This business uses
 metals to make a variety of things,   
 including pig troughs.
