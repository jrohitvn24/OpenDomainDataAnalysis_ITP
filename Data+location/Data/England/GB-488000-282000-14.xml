		<title>14MAY DAY</title>
		<content>May Day is celebrated each year by the 
Primary schoolchildren. Each child     
takes flowers to distribute to senior  
citizens in the village during the     
morning. At each pensioner's house the 
May Carol is sung.                     
At Midday the children return home for 
lunch collecting the May Bread from the
Vicar at Church. The playground is     
prepared with chairs and the Maypole.  
The children come back bringing entries
for a garland competition judged by a  
celebrity. Everyone goes to Church for 
a May Day Service.                     
Afterwards, the May Queen, chosen by   
the children a month earlier, is       
crowned on the Eleanor Cross flanked by
her consort and attendants.            
The children proceed to the playground 
to present a programme of dances.      
Finally a May Day tea is served for the
pupils in the Village Hall.            </content>
