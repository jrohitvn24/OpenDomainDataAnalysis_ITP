		<content> In our playground we play lots of     
 games, one of them is called          
{'Elastic'}.Two people put the elastic 
 round their feet and another person   
 jumps in and out of it.There are lots 
 of different steps.Another popular    
 game is marbles.{Marbles}is played on 
 drains.On our drains there are        
 triangular pieces sticking up. The    
 marbles go everwhere.They carry on    
 going until they hit one of the       
 others.Another game is{'Bull dog'}.In 
 our playground there are two semi     
 circles .We all stand in one of them  
 and a person chooses another person   
 and they have to hit them .If the     
 person who is hit didn't hit the other
 one ,all the other people run to the  
 far circle.
