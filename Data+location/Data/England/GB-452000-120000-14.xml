		<title>14A DAY IN A FARMER'S LIFE</title>
		<content>            AFTERNOON                  
    After lunch the dogs jump into the 
 landrover and away we go to view the  
 crops and make sure all the cattle are
 all right, no fences are broken, and  
 that there is plenty of water for them
 in the various places where they are  
 grazing between Baybridge and         
 Northbrook. I usually meet various    
 friends en route and pass the time of 
 day with them, discussing the weather,
 the crops and anything else that has  
 happened locally. I return to the farm
 at about 4.30 p.m. and we all have a  
 cup of tea. Sometimes I will do a bit 
 of weeding in the garden, or prune the
 roses, but if I'm weary I sit down and
 have a little nap. We have our evening
 meal at about 7.30 p.m. and then      
 chat,read or watch the television     
 until about 10 p.m. when we go to bed.
