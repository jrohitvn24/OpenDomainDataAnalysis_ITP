		<content>SEVERAL LOCAL PEOPLE WERE INTERVIEWED  
DURING OUR PROJECT WORK AND WE         
DISCOVERED THAT MUCH CAN BE LEARNT BY  
LISTENING TO OLDER PEOPLE.FOR EXAMPLE  
WE INTERVIEWED OUR LOCAL DEACONESS FROM
ST.JOHN'S PARISH CHURCH,MRS.DIANE      
OSBORNE.SHE TOLD US ABOUT HER BUSY AND 
REWARDING LIFE.HER MAIN JOBS ARE       
VISITING PEOPLE IN HER PARISH AND      
TAKING CHURCH SERVICES.WE WOULD ALSO   
LIKE TO THANK MR.G.E.OSBORNE WHO WAS   
KIND ENOUGH TO COME AND TALK TO US     
ABOUT HIS LIFE IN THE AREA SINCE 1938.
