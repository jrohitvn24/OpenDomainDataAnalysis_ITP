		<content> Branston is a big village and it is   
 about 5 miles away from Lincoln and   
 most people work and go shopping in   
 Lincoln.I wanted to see how many      
 people have a car and use public      
 transport or need public transport to 
 get into Lincoln.Out of the 26 people 
 in Branston I interveued 19 people had
 a car 13 people had a bike and 2      
 people had a motor bike.Most people   
 went into Lincoln shopping and for    
 dental appointments and even          
 business.Some people walk to Lincoln  
 every day to get fit!12 people use    
 the bus service no more than          
 occasionally.2 people use it once a   
 week.No one uses it regularly and 6   
 people never use it.People do use     
 public transport but it is not that   
 important because most people in      
 Branston have a car.
