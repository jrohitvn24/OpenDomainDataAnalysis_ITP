  Ellington Colliery is the main       
 industrial feature in our area. Most  
 men from Lynemouth work at Ellington.{

{Residential.                          
  The rest of the area is farmland,with
 residential areas at Lynemouth-built  
 in 1923-and a large housing estate at 
 Ellington.                            
  There is also a residential area at  
 Cresswell, but there aren't many      
 houses. There are 600 caravans making 
 a holiday village, which has many     
 amenities on site.                    
  There are more caravans on smaller   
 sites im the area,including gipsy     
 caravans on the seashore at Lynemouth.
{Wetland.}                             
   More than half our block is wetland.
