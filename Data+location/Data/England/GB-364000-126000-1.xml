		<title>01A GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> This block lies 200'-500'a.s.l.where  
 the valleys of two streams drain from 
 NE to SW.It is gently rolling farmland
 divided up by hedges and roads into   
 fields,copses,farmsteads and villages.
 Country roads criss-cross but the road
 pattern is dominated by the A.303,a   
 major route E-W dividing the area     
 physically and socially into two      
 parts.The population is concentrated  
 into 4 village/hamlets containing     
 working farms and many old farmhouses 
 and thatched cottages.                
   A picture may be forming in your    
 mind of an idyllic rural scene;a      
 population living off the land; an    
 area offering the newcomer freedom to 
 breathe fresh air,walk or ride at     
 will:in short an area of rural peace. 
 Read on to find a different scene,    
 elements of rural contentment exist   
 along side those causing friction.    </content>
