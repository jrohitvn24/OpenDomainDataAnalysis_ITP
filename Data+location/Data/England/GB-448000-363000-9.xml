		<content> There are still many rows of terraced 
 houses in Pleasley which belonged to  
 the National Coal Board; although     
 since the colliery closed some of the 
 houses have been demolished, that is  
 the older ones, while the others have 
 been sold and are owned by the public.
 In a recent survey 60% of the people  
 in Pleasley are owners of their own   
 homes.There are a small number of     
 private houses being built at the     
 moment - July l985. The local         
 council, Mansfield District Council   
 are the owners of many rows of        
 terraced houses for which the         
 tennants pay rent. There are other    
 houses owned by other people who have 
 tennants paying rent.These are the    
 more wealthy people who are property  
 owners.During the past two years a    
 block of thirty eight modern flats    
 have been built for the elderly.      </content>
