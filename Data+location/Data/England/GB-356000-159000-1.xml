		<title>01THE CHEW VALLEY</title>
		<content> The flooding of this valley by damming
 the River Chew and its tributaries has
 now been accepted by the local        
 inhabitants. The original objections  
 on the loss of rich farmland have now 
 given way to an appreciation of the   
 new beauty of the area. Birds flock in
 their thousands to the lake either to 
 over winter or rest on their journey  
 to other breeding grounds.            
 Work on the land is very important to 
 the communities but on the whole the  
 villages and hamlets are now mainly   
 dormitories used by the commuters  who
 work in the cities of Bath, Bristol   
 and Wells.The communities are very    
 lively and clubs and organisations    
 exist for children and adults alike.  
 A variety of different types of house 
 can be found from old cottages to     
 modern houses.
