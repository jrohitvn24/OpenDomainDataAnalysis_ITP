		<title>09SAVAY FARM (contd.)</title>
		<content> The present owners of the farm are    
 Mr. and Mrs. I.F.I. Cakebread.  They  
 bought the farm in 1945.  Mr. and Mrs.
 Cakebread used to keep farm animals   
 i.e. chickens, pigs, cattle and       
 horses.  But as houses were built near
 the farm, the residents objected to   
 the smells of the farm and the        
 Cakebreads had to stop stocking       
 animals.  Now all the 40 acre farmland
 is used for growing wheat in three of 
 the four fields.  Hay is grown in the 
 remaining field.  2.5 acres of the    
 farm land is woodland. The river Colne
 runs through the farm and the bridge  
 which was built in 1762, has a stone  
 which marks the boundary between      
 Middlesex and Buckinghamshire.        
 The farmhouse has two ghosts and both 
 appear to be nuns.  The farm has      
 appeared in several films made by the 
 B.B.C.                                </content>
