		<content>    Our school was opened in 1976 and  
 can accommodate 240 children aged 8 - 
 12. At present there are 148 on roll. 
 It has one storey and there are eight 
 classrooms, two shared areas, a hall, 
 a medical room, two offices and a     
 staffroom where the teachers have a   
 break.                                
    The basic shape from an aerial view
 is a square but bits stick out like   
 the kitchen and the boiler-house. The 
 outside of the building is covered in 
 brown pebble-dash and the doors, which
 are all double, are painted orange and
 are set back into the walls to make a 
 sort of porch. On the school roof     
 there are some large square plastic   
 pyramids which let in light.          
    There are two playgrounds and one  
 has a netball pitch on it. There is   
 also a large wooden storage shed, a   
 greenhouse and a large playing field. </content>
