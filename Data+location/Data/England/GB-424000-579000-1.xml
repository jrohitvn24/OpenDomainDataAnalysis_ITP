		<title>01BEDLINGTON - PAST &amp; PRESENT</title>
		<content>  Bedlington itself dates back to      
 Anglo-Saxon times (Bedlas ton -the    
 settlement of Bedlas a                
 chieftain.)Today the close links with 
 that period are to be seen in St      
 Cuthbert's Church.  Much of           
 Bedlington's attractive Front Street  
 is over l00 years &amp; centred upon the  
 Market place.  The area is essentially
 rural in character with farming       
 predominant.  The River Blyth bissects
 the block and the Blyth Valley is     
 interesting ecologically as well as   
 providing a very attractive leisure   
 area.  Mining connections are still   
 strong - Hartford Hall rehabilitation 
 centre; the Bedlington Miner's Picnic 
 - but little visible evidence remains 
 of the areas premier industry.  Family
 Life is traditional, close knit and   
 has helped to weather the storm of    
 unemployment.                         </content>
