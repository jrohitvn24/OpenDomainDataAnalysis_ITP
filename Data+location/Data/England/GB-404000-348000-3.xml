		<content>The limestone hills around the villages
of Cauldon and Cauldon Lowe are the    
source of material for the extractive  
industries of our area.                
The Tarmac Quarry is the largest single
employer with about 100 employees, most
of whom work full time. The main       
product, limestone is used for making  
roads, wall building, landscaping,     
lime-spreading on farms and for making 
plastics.                              
The stone is quarried by a combination 
of explosives and large dragline       
excavators, then taken by giant earth  
movers to the processing plant on site.
From there fleets of lorries and goods 
trains transport it all round the      
country. A few years ago stone from    
this quarry was used to build the      
Thames Flood Barrier. Now stone is     
being used for landscaping at the      
National Garden Centre, Stoke-on-Trent.</content>
