		<title>10FARMING IN WORSBROUGH</title>
		<content>  The{Elmhirst}family have been farming
 in this area for over 700 years.There 
 used to be several farms owned by the 
 Elmhirst family but now all the farms 
 have been combined into one large farm
 as is the practise with farming       
 generally.{A.O.Elmhirst}gave his son  
 Richard the estate when he became too 
 old to manage it himself.The farm is a
 mixed dairy and arable farm.They have 
 recently begun raising{red deer}.They 
 breed and fatten the deer which are   
 sold as venison.Over the years Mr     
 Elmhirst has enjoyed seeing newly born
 animals play around and crops maturing
 in his field.He dislikes crops failing
 especially when the cause is not      
 known.His animals sometimes get       
 diseases such as Ringworm ,TB. and    
 Brucellosis.These are always          
 distressing for the farmer when they  
 see their animals suffer.             </content>
