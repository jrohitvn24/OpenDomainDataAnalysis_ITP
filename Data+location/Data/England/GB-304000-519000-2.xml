		<content> There is very little in the way of    
 habitation in this area. Apart from   
 the northern end of the expanding     
 village of Arlecdon the rest of the   
 population is scattered around the    
 countryside either in isolation or at 
 best small hamlets.                   
 Some of the dwellings are farm houses 
 but the majority of buildings appear  
 to belong to people who live in the   
 countryside but travel to the nearby  
 towns to their places of work. As this
 trend continues there has been a      
 recent increase in the number of new  
 dwellings in the area.                
 Some of these dwellings have been     
 erected on spare plots of land        
 scattered around the area, but two    
 places have seen most development.    
 These are Asby and Murton Park, the   
 latter being part of Arlecdon.
