		<content> The new Carnival Queen of the Wecock  
 Annual Carnival was Dawn Rowe. She was
 chosen on July 20th at Wecock Village 
 Centre. She won Â£30, a dress voucher, 
 a hair styling and a bouquet.  A six  
 year old pony was brought into        
 Meadowlands School for the morning    
 assembly by Kerry-Anne Stone aged 8.  
 Helped by her father, she answered the
 questions from 300 pupils. Animals    
 have been brought to school to        
 encourage children's interests in     
 different areas of school work.  The  
 police turned a resident of Cowplain  
 away from Stonehenge. He has gone to  
 celebrate the summer solstice every   
 year since he was 16. The Brewmaster  
 pub, for the fourth year running, has 
 had the most intelligent drinkers.    
 This year's team won the Whitbread    
 regional competition.
