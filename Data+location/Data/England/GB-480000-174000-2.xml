		<title>02Waltham St Lawrence Village</title>
		<content>  {Waltham St Lawrence}is a small      
 village in the Thames Valley.  It has 
 one main street with three small side 
 roads off it.  There is a Post Office,
 a general store and an agricultural   
 supplier in the village.              
                                       
   The village has two pubs, The Bell  
 and The Star, a village hall and      
 another hall for meetings, a church   
 and a petrol station.                 
                                       
   The houses down the main street are 
 mainly old houses built before 1900   
 while on the outskirts of the village 
 most of the houses are much smaller   
 and were built after 1900.  Apart from
 some council houses there are very few
 modern houses built in the village.
