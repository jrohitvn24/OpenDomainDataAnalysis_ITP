 into 6 plots, after Lloyd George's    
 policy of 'a cow and an acre' was     
 passed.  Mr. Bonnet's farming         
 grandfather owned one plot from       
 l926-32.  His son took over in l932   
 until l970 and now Mr. Bonnet owns it.
  Bonnet's Farm is run by Mr. Bonnet.  
 He owns part of the land, and rents   
 the rest from Essex County Council.   
 It is a market garden farm selling    
 vegetables eg radishes, lettuces,     
 onions, garlic, rhubarb and parsley.  
 He sells his crops at Stratford and   
 Upton Park Markets, and also in Nine  
 Elms, Aldgate, Aveley and Sainsbury's 
 in Rainham.  They have their own farm 
 shop too.  Mr. Bonnet has 3 tractors,
