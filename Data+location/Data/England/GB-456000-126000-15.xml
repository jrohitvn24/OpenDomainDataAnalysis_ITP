		<title>15Where and why People Travel.</title>
		<content> We thought it would be interesting to 
 investigate the pattern of peoples    
 movement in and out of the village of 
 Cheriton.We interviewed 111 households
          Out of these 55 people       
 commute to their place of employment. 
 Of these 25 travel more than 12 miles,
 17 more than 6 miles and 13 more than 
 2 miles.                              
          We also asked where people   
 went to do the bulk of their food     
 shopping,as there is only one village 
 shop and village shops find it        
 difficult to compete with             
 supermarkets.42 went to Winchester(8m)
 48 to Alresford(3m),7 to              
 Eastleigh(12m) and 5 to Chandlers Ford
 (11m).The remainder traveled to a     
 variety of places and only a few of   
 the older residents without transport 
 relied solely on the village shop.
