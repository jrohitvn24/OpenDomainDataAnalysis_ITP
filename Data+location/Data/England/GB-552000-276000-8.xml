		<content> The distribution of settlement is     
 closely related to the shape of the   
 ground. The two villages Stuntney and 
 Little Thetford are found on the      
 higher ground away from the low-lying 
 Fen. Stuntney in particular is a very 
 good example of a dry-site (fen       
 island) settlement, having been built 
 on a small piece of land above the    
 general level of the marshy/flooded   
 area. There are 5 other individual    
 farms in the area. The population     
 density of the area is therefore very 
 low. Stuntney has 52 houses of which  
 about half have been built recently,  
 whilst Lt.Thetford has 84 houses (50  
 recent), these newer properties are   
 situated more on the outskirts of the 
 village away from the old centre and  
 are evidence of the greater mobility  
 of people today, as the majority do   
 not work near where they live.        </content>
