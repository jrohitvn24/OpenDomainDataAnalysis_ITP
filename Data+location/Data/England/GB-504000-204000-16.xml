		<title>16HEMEL HEMPSTEAD PEOPLE</title>
		<content> A small survey has been conducted from
 a few schools in Hemel Hempstead. This
 has aimed at finding out how people   
 feel about living in the town. The    
 majority of responses have come from  
 the 25-60 age group. More of those    
 responding appear to be content with  
 living in the town than those who wish
 to leave. Of the people who wish to   
 move, about half still wish to be in  
 Hemel Hempstead but in a different    
 neighbourhood. This would suggest that
 even though people have moved to the  
 town for a variety of reasons: after  
 marriage,for a job, brought by parents
 for example, they do find it a        
 sufficiently pleasant place to remain.
 This view is reflected in the under 25
 age group although there were very few
 responses from this group.            
                                       
                                       </content>
