 Harvel Village Hall was built in 1912 
 and left to the village by Mr F.      
 Cripps -Day on his death.It was       
 extended in 1965 to provide a stage   
 and cloakrooms.  The hall is run by a 
 management committee, one member      
 nominated by each of the regular users
 e.g. the Playgroup, the Cricket Club, 
 the W.I. and the Over Sixties, and 5  
 elected members.  The hall is used    
 also as a surgery, for dancing classes
 and for private social functions.  In 
 the past the hall has been used as a  
 church,Sunday school and for Guides.  
 The committee also administers        
 Swanswood Field now leased to Vigo    
 R.F.C.  To raise money for hall upkeep
 a Fete is organised on each August    
 Bank Holiday.It is run by villagers   
 with no commercial involvement, and   
 the atmosphere remains truly rural.   </content>
