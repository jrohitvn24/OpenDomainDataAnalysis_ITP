		<title>03Alstonefield Landscape</title>
		<content>     Around Alstonefield, it is mostly 
farmland with rivers, fields and       
grassland.  The land is quite hilly and
the woodland is largely spread.        
     The land next to the burial mound 
Steep Low, which is covered with trees,
belongs to Gateham Farm.  This land is 
mainly mowing grass used for hay and   
silage, with just a few pastures.  The 
land on the other side of the road is  
mainly pasture and belongs to Gateham  
Grange.  The land around Pealow belongs
to Raikes Head Farm and Green Farm.    
This land is also mixed with some      
mowing grass and some pastures.        
     The River Dove starts in the Axe  
Edge Moors as a little stream, flows   
east of Alstonefield and when it gets  
to Dove Dale it is a wide river.  There
are also one or two dried-up river beds
in the area.                           
                                       </content>
