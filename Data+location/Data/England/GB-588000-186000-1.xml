		<content> OUR BLOCK IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SHARPLY 
 CONTRASTING AREAS. THE DIVIDING LINE  
 BETWEEN THESE TWO AREAS RUNS          
 DIAGONALLY THROUGH THE BLOCK FROM THE 
 NORTH WEST TO THE SOUTH EAST AND IT   
 COMPRISES THE DUAL CARRIAGEWAY        
 ARTERIAL ROAD FROM LONDON TO          
 SHOEBURYNESS. TO THE SOUTH OF THIS    
 ROAD IS A MAINLY RESIDENTIAL AREA     
 ORIGINALLY BUILT IN THE FIRST DECADES 
 OF THIS CENTURY; THERE IS ALSO A      
 CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LIGHT INDUSTRY MIXED
 IN AMONG THE HOUSES. TO THE NORTH OF  
 THE ROAD IS A MAINLY ARABLE FARMING   
 AREA WITH LIGHTLY SCATTERED HOUSING   
 WHICH HAS REMAINED LARGELY UNCHANGED  
 FOR CENTURIES.                        
    COMPARED WITH OTHER PARTS OF       
 SOUTHEND THE BLOCK COVERS AN AREA     
 PARTS OF WHICH ARE RATHER             
 DEPRESSED ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SIGNS    
 OF IMPROVEMENT AND INDUSTRIAL GROWTH. </content>
