		<title>16Schooling in Breamore</title>
		<content> Breamore primary school,a{Victorian  }
 structure opened in 1872,serves the   
 needs of the villages of Breamore,    
 Woodgreen,and Godshill.Presently,56   
 children are enrolled,with numbers    
 rising as parents from Fordingbridge  
 and Whitsbury choose to send their    
 children there.                       
 Some 95% of Breamore school children  
 then attend the{Burgate Comprehensive,
 the nearest 11-16 secondary school.   
 Occasionally,a pupil may choose to    
 attend a single-sex grammar school in 
 Salisbury,where the old"grammar-      
 secondary modern system" is still     
 operating.A controversial decision has
 just been made(Sept.1985)to scrap this
 system in favour of a comprehensive   
 one and if it obtains the approval of 
 SIr Keith Joseph,the present Education
 Secretary,this schooling option will  
 no longer be available.               </content>
