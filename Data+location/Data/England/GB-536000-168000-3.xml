		<content>{Houses }in Beckenham have changed     
 enormously in recent years.A large    
 number were built in Victorian times  
 for well to do families.They have     
 become too large for most people to   
 be able to afford so are being        
 converted into small flats or old     
 peoples homes or being knocked down.  
  The prices have risen over the last  
 fifteen years;a house that cost Â£7000 
 then is now ten times higher. Many new
 houses and small blocks of luxury     
 flats have been built in the last few 
 years.
