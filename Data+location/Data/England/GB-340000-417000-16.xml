		<title>16Ascroft's Mill in Merebrow.</title>
		<content> The cornmill was founded by Thomas    
 Ascroft in early 1900. The shop also  
 belongs to the firm T.Ascroft and     
 Sons. In the early 1900's there was a 
 staff of 8 people which included Tommy
 Ascroft the son of the founder. The   
 present staff has been streamlined to 
 3 full time and 1 part time office    
 staff. The present fulltime staff are 
 grandsons of the founder.             
   They own two wagons. The machinery  
 was installed by Blezards of Preston  
 and consists of 2 grinders, 2 mixers  
 and a crusher. As well as selling and 
 preparing animal feedstuffs they sell 
 all gardening and farming tools, also 
 peatmoss, woodshavings,cement and     
 limestone.                            
 Sometimes farmers come and we crush   
 their barley and oats. Most of the    
 deliveries are local but sometimes    
 they go north to Blackpool.           </content>
