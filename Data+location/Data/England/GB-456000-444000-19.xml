		<content> After this we play a game on paper or 
 play some records or tapes.By this    
 time we go to the shops for some      
 sweets and a can of coke.Then we ride 
 round on our bikes and have races and 
 stop every so often to have some of   
 our sweets.Then Angela goes home on   
 her bike and I have my tea and        
 sometimes we have fish and chips which
 I go for on my bike.After tea I take  
 my dog for a walk down Moor Lane where
 I let her off the lead and throw      
 stones which she fetches and brings   
 back. When I get back it is about     
 6.45pm and so I practice my instrument
 the Guitar, or watch television for an
 hour. Then I have a hot drink and some
 biscuits for supper, I get ready for  
 bed, brush my teeth and then shout    
 goodnight to my mum and go to bed.
