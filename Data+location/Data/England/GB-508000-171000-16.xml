		<title>16HANWORTH</title>
		<content> Hanworth is a small part of the town  
 of Feltham and it has a very historic 
 past. Most of the land that has now   
 been built on in Hanworth used to be  
 the Royal hunting grounds from Hampton
 Court in the days of King Henry VIII. 
 What open land there is left served as
 an airfield both before and after the 
 Second World War.                     
 The Mount (the centre of Hanworth) was
 built as an Ice House for Hanworth    
 Park House in about 1875. This        
 building was used as the headquaters  
 for the Royal Navy Association up     
 until 1962. The lodge was then        
 demolished and Feltham swimming baths 
 were built on the site much to the    
 annoyance of many people. Today       
 Hanworth is like a little town it has 
 its own library,banks,post            
 office,garages and shops.
