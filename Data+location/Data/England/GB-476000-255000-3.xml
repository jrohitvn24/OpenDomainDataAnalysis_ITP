		<title>03  Wootton  Primary  School.</title>
		<content>  The first part of Wootton School was 
built in 1872 on the opposite side of  
High Street from the Church. The school
has since been added to at various     
times. At the moment there are 170     
children who work in six classrooms.   
There are seven teachers including the 
head.                                  
  The subjects we do are mathematics,  
English,reading,writing, history,      
environmental studies and physical     
activities. Most of the children prefer
mathematics to any other subject.      
  We have a playing field, a small     
library and a computer which we use in 
a lot of different ways. Parts of the  
school need redecorating, we need two  
modern purpose-built classrooms, better
library facilities and p.e. apparatus. 
  However most children like the school
and it is good to be here in 1985.
