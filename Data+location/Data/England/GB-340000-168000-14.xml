		<title>14An ordinary day in my life</title>
		<content>  I get to school at{8:40 a.m.}and play
 football with my friends before the   
 bell goes at{8:55 a.m.} We line up    
 outside the classroom and are let in  
 at{9:00 a.m.}After registration we    
 read for a while before assembly and  
 then usually do maths until playtime  
 at {10:40 a.m.}when we play cricket or
 football. After some language work    
 like writing a story, the bell goes at
{12:00 p.m.}I have my lunch at {12:40  
{p.m.}I bring sandwiches. School       
 finishes at{3:30 p.m.}and when I get  
 home, I usually watch Children's ITV, 
 play on my computer or go out to play.
 Tea is about{5:30 p.m.}We usually have
 a roast or salad but we might have a  
 Bar-B-Q. After that, I might go out   
 and play or put the T.V. or Video on. 
 Before I go to bed, I write what has  
 happened in my diary.                 
                                       </content>
