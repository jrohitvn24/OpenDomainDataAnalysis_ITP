		<content> On the second Saturday in August we   
 have the Rushbearing Ceremony. This   
 dates back to medieval times when     
 rushes covered the floors of the      
 Church and houses. The custom was     
 revived in l9l0 and nowadays a Queen  
 and attendants are chosen. There is a 
 procession where the children carry   
 posies and rushes and following this  
 is a short church service. Another    
 popular occasion is the Village Fete, 
 Barley, held on the third Saturday in 
 August on the picnic area. This event 
 is organised by the Village Hall      
 Committee to raise funds. The main    
 attractions are children's races, tug 
 of war, fell race, afternoon teas     
 provided by Barley Women's Institute, 
 and a brass band.  In the evening a   
 dance is held for over l6s in the     
 Village Hall.                         
                                       </content>
