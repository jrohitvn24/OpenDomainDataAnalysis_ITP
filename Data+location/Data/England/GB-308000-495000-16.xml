		<title>16LAKE DISTRICT NATIONAL PARK</title>
		<content> The whole of this area is in the Lake 
 District National Park and this       
 imposes severe restrictions on the    
 village.No building can be done       
 without permission from the planning  
 board which dictate the size, shape   
 and building materials used.It is only
 in the last 5 years that any building 
 has been allowed in Ravenglass at all 
 and many people believe that much     
 natural development has been          
 stifled for example there is no garage
 in the area.However the planning      
 board is reponsible for maintaining   
 the car parks,public toilets and the  
 footpaths which helps the appearance  
 of the village.
