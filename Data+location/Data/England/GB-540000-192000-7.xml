		<title>07RIVER RODING,BUCKHURST HILL</title>
		<content>  The River Roding is a riverthat flows
 through Essex from North to South,into
 the River Thames.We looked at two     
 sections along the Roding.The first   
 was a very flat area with a lot of    
 rubbish in the river.The underground  
 runs over the Roding on an arched     
 bridge.There is a lake which used to  
 be a quarry used in the building of   
 the M11 Motorway.To the south is a    
 sewage works.It is a tatty area with  
 rubbish lying around.                 
  Section 2 is much nicer because it is
 cleaner and smater.The grass here is  
 well looked after.Here there is       
 another lake which was also used for  
 the M11.On one side of the lake there 
 is the remains of a barage blloon base
 from World War Two.This is now        
 wasteland.                            
  This area is much used by locals for 
 walking dos etc..                     </content>
