		<content> Although people cry that there is not 
 a lot to do the area is not poorly    
 provided for. There are playing fields
 at Iwade, Kemsley and Quinton with a  
 cricket field at Bobbing. There is a  
 well appointed club at Kemsley with   
 facilities for snooker, darts and many
 other pub games as well as being a    
 popular dance and banqueting hall.    
 A B.M.X cycle track has been built at 
 Kemsley although it is occassionally  
 used as a rubbish dumping ground.     
 The Borough Council organise play     
 schemes during the summer holiday     
 period for each area of the           
 population. The Woolpack Inn at Iwade 
 has a florishing social club as does  
 the Halfway pub at Bobbing. With the  
 village halls at Iwade and Bobbing    
 being very popular for dances and     
 receptions the area is not without    
 amenities.                            </content>
