		<title>16SCHOOL EVENTS IN COLEHILL</title>
		<content> These are some of the annual events we
 have at school.Soon we will be having 
 Sports Day. I will run in the running 
 race.I like the Christmas events.We   
 have a Christmas party and lots to eat
 and drink.Most years we have a        
 sponsored walk.Last year I did not go.
 All it is is just walking around the  
 school grounds.We raised a lot of     
 money.Every year we have a school     
 photograph.I have mine taken with my  
 sister.The dentist comes to check up  
 on our teeth.My teeth were all right. 
 The library van comes every term and  
 people go and choose some books.We    
 have an annual outing.We are going    
 soon to the Motor Museum at Beaulieu.
