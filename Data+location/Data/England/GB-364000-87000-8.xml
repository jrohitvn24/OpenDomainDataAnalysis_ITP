		<title>08A wet Royal visit</title>
		<content>   9.00a.m.24 May 1985 Crowds of people
 were walking up the old tracks to     
 Maiden Castle. The reason? Simple, the
 Prince and Princess of Wales were     
 arriving by helicopter at 10.00 a.m.  
   Rain poured down, accompanied by    
 gale force winds.                     
   We walked up the earth mound and    
 stood crammed against a rope, tired   
 and cold. Then we heard they weren't  
 to come until 11.00 a.m. Television   
 men were getting impatient. People    
 waved everytime they thought the      
 camera was on them.                   
   The helicopter was delayed by bad   
 weather.By 11.30 a.m. we couldn't move
 our feet were stuck in the mud. The   
 helicopter landed and the Royal couple
 came out. They shook about three hands
 and then headed into a tent. The crowd
 rushed forward,but no more was seen of
 the couple.                           </content>
