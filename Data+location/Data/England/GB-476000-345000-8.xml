		<title>08The Combine Harvester</title>
		<content> A Combine Harvester is a complicated  
 machine.It is powered by a diesel     
 engine.The front of the combine is    
 called the wheat bender.Under the     
 combine is the thresher and above that
 the worm gear.There are lots of types 
 of combine.There is the Massey        
 Fergusson,John Deer,Klaas and New     
 Holland.Modern combines have air      
 conditioning in their cabs.They have  
 bright lights so that harvesting can  
 be continued at night. A new combine  
 costs about Â£70,000.                  
      A combine does 2 jobs,the first  
 cutting and gathering,the second      
 threshing and separating. A mower cuts
 the corn.A pick-up reel with rows of  
 tines picks it up.The straw and grain 
 are shaken.The grain falls through a  
 grid,the chaff is blown away and the  
 grain goes by pipe to a trailer.The   
 straw falls out.                      </content>
