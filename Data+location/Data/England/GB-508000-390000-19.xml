		<content> Rural Ministry within the Church of   
 England in the latter years of the    
 20th century is entirely different in 
 conditions and situation from that of 
 former years. Whereas, in years past  
 each village church could usually     
 support its own benefice through the  
 media of glebe, patronage and fees,   
 the present situation is one of       
 multiple parishes grouped together    
 as a unit under the cure of one       
 clergyman. This has been brought about
 basically by 2 factors:-              
 1. Forces occasioned by increasing    
 industrialisation and the resulting   
 vast economic changes. This meant that
 glebe and patronage were no longer    
 sufficient to provide for clergy and  
 family.                               
 2. Urbanisation. The newly created    
 parishes did not have the traditional 
 benefit of glebe and patronage.       </content>
