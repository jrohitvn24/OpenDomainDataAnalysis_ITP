		<content>{Listed buildings.}This part of rural  
 Cheshire has quite a number of listed 
 buildings,especially round Saighton.  
 The "Gatehouse" tower of Saighton     
 Grange rates 2 stars &amp; the rest is    
 grade 2.Also grade 2 are the water    
 tower;two boundary walls;the Old      
 Vicarage,its gardens &amp; walls;the      
 building &amp; rails outside the primary  
 school.At Hatton Hall both the house &amp;
 the causeway over the "Moat" are grade
 2 &amp; so is Faulkner's bridge over the  
 canal.This ensures that they are not  
 destroyed or changed much.            
{New property.}Except at Gatesheath    
 there has been little 20th century    
 building with only the very occasional
 new house or business premises eg.at  
 Hatton Heath.Gatesheath has a small   
 estate of post-war council houses (see
 page 4) &amp; some smart detached 1960's  
 houses with gardens.                  </content>
