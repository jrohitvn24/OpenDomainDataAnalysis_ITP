 There are flourishing groups of       
 Scouts, Cubs, Beavers, Girl Guides,   
 Brownies and Horse Rangers, with a    
 Youth Club nearby at Sandford.        
 Gardeners are well-catered for, with  
 the Growmore Club and the             
 Horticultural Society.  The parish    
 church has a team of bellringers. The 
 Women's Institute, and the Sunshine   
 Club for the over-60's meet regularly 
 and the Auld Acquaintance Committee   
 raise money for an annual party for   
 the elderly. For those whose interests
 lie in party politics, there are clubs
 for Conservatives and Liberals. There 
 is a Cricket Club and Gun Club, while 
 darts, snooker and other pub games can
 be played at "The Griffin" and "The   
 Taverners" as well as at the Sports   
 and Social Club in the Village Hall.
