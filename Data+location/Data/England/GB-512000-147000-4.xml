		<title>04THE NOWER</title>
		<content>   The{Nower}is a{sandstone hill}to the
 south west of Dorking. It is towards  
 the eastern end of the{lower greensand
{escarpment}which reaches its highest  
 point at Leith Hill. Originally it was
 the garden for a house which stood on 
 the site of Nower Lodge School. During
 the last war it was used by the Polish
 army for training and many  of their  
 trenches still remain.                
   Today the Nower is part of the      
{greenbelt}and consists of a large area
 of grass and woodland. A one day      
 survey showed that 50% of the people  
 using the Nower did so to{exercise    
{their dogs,}99% of these came every   
 day and lived within a few miles of   
 the area. Others used the area for    
{jogging, walking}and a number of      
 children used it as a short cut to    
 school. In winter a great number of   
 people use the slopes for{sledging.   </content>
