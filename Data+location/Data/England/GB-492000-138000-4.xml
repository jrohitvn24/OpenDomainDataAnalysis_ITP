		<title>04NATIONAL TRUST-WITLEY COMMON</title>
		<content>   In 1921{Witley Common }was bought by
 the National Trust and today there is 
 a very interesting Nature Information 
 Centre there.The National Trust built 
 the Centre in order to give pleasure  
 and to encourage interest in Nature   
 Conservation and supply the need for  
 countryside management.               
   The Common has a wide range of      
 habitats,animals and plants.There are 
 three marked trails,yellow,orange and 
 red and a team of experienced guides  
 to show people around .               
   Inside the Centre,which is a very   
 attractive,modern building,there is an
 exhibition of the history of the      
 Common and a ten minute slide show.   
 Upstairs are two rooms ,one for       
 lectures and one for private study.   
   The Centre is open daily from 11.00-
 13.00hrs,14.00-17.00hrs,April-October.
 There is a car park and picnic area.  </content>
