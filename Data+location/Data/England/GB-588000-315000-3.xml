		<title>03LOCAL HISTORY CHANGING TIMES</title>
		<content>   Here we have compared the views of  
people of all ages,and painted a       
picture of how times have changed, a   
breif compilation of different peoples 
memories and opinions, and various     
views of life today starting with      
younger members of our local society.  
   We discovered that life in general  
is liked by people in this area, and   
only a few would perfer to live in a   
city.The only complaints were of lack  
of amenities,such as a good a good bus 
service,and the preference of living in
a larger village to satisfy such needs 
as discos,which do not occur often in  
the rural Litcham area,certainly not in
the smaller villages.We found that     
pocket-money averages at around 2      
pounds a week, and is usually spent on 
such things as records and sweets.
