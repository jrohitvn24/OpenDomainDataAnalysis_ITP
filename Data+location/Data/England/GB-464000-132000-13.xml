		<title>13FOUR MARKS SCHOOL:GAMES</title>
		<content> GAMES CHILDREN PLAY:  The children in 
 Four Marks school make up some of     
 their own games.  It's much more fun  
 because you can make your own set of  
 rules.  One of the games we play is   
 called "Victory".  A group of people  
 stand in a half circle, a Catcher is  
 chosen then the Catcher picks one     
 person to run to the other side of the
 playground to another half circle.  If
 that person gets to the other side    
 before the Catcher taps them they     
 shout "Victory".  The group of people 
 then have to run to the other side as 
 well.  Anyone who is caught has to    
 help catch.  This goes on until one   
 person is left.
