 newspapers which also include {The    
{Romford and Havering Observer, The    
{Billericay Gazette}and {The Essex     
{Chronicle.}One senior reporter,chief  
 reporter,junior reporter and one      
 part-time political reporter work on  
 the paper along with 5 photographers, 
 news editor, sub-editor and editor.   
   The group started in{1788,}founded  
 by William Strupar, but{The Gazette}  
 has only been running since{1919.}The 
 bulk of the paper contains advertise- 
 ments so the size of it varies each   
 week. It informs the public of activit
 -ies in the vicinity and reports all  
 relevant local news. Since the M25    
 opened in 1984, the number of motoring
 offences has trebled but offenders    
 have not necessarily been from        
 Brentwood.                            </content>
