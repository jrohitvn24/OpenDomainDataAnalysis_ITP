		<content> In the{Piethorne Valley}there is a lot
 of{pollution}from a dye mill in{Ogden 
 which is on Piethorne's door step .The
{walls}around Piethorne were a{sandy   
{colour}because they were made of      
{sandstone,}but now they are{black.    
 Close by is a wood but the trees did  
 not{grow well}because of the pollution
 in the valley.Now the trees  are a    
{shelter}to the{animals}and you can    
 be very sure that if you are in the   
 wood an{owl}would be looking at       
 you.There has not been a lot of{acid  
{rain}in the area around Piethorne.    
{Facilities}are  available,these       
 include a car park,a toilet and an    
 office where{wardens}are based.The    
 wardens like to help you and there are
 a lot of walks for people to enjoy.
