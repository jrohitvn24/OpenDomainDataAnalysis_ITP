		<title>01Kingswood District. Avon.</title>
		<content>  Kingswood District is about 18 square
 miles in area and lies on the eastern 
 edge of{Bristol.}It is mainly         
 residential, with a{population}of     
 about 87,000. There are also a number 
 of small{industries}such as printing  
 and engineering,as well as those      
 manufacturing footwear and foodstuffs.
 A few farms amd market gardens may    
 also be found.                        
  Evidence can still be seen of the now
 abandoned{coal-mining}industry for    
 which Kingswood was once famous, and  
 the many chapels are a legacy of the  
 18th century religious revivals.      
  Today, Kingswood is a popular        
 residential area for people working in
 Bristol. It has a good shopping centre
 and is quite well supplied with       
 amenities relating to health,         
 education and leisure.  It became part
 of the county of{Avon}in 1974.        </content>
