		<title>19DEEPING ST.JAMES SUGAR BEET</title>
		<content>    Sugar beet is a common crop in East
 Anglia.Many farmers in our area grow  
 it.It is sown in March using a beet   
 drill drawn by a tractor.It takes     
 about six weeks for the first signs of
 the beet to appear.When the crop is   
 young it is sprayed with Beternol     
 which gets rid of the little insects  
 and weeds which will endanger the     
 crop.The farmers used to hire women to
 weed the field when it needed it but  
 now they mainly use a normal tractor  
 which has an attachment to pull up the
 weeds.                                
    The sugar beet has a yellow body   
 and green leaves.It is harvested by   
 machine between October and December. 
    The beet is mainly sentto Spalding 
 sugar beet factory where the beet is  
 processed.The farmers can buy the pulp
 back for cattle feed.
