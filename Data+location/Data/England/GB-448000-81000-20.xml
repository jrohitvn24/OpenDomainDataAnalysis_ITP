		<content>    There are three regular bus routes 
 in our area: the Newport to Ventnor   
 service and the Cowes to Shanklin and 
 Ventnor service in square 4, the      
 Newport to Brighstone Post Bus in     
 squares 2,6,5 and the Ryde to Ventnor 
 and Blackgang service in squares 1,5  
 and 9.                                
    Some of the minor roads are too    
 narrow for buses . Elderly people in  
 the remote parts, who are not active  
 enough to walk to the nearest bus     
 routes, have to depend on private     
 transport. There are no railways.     
    All the roads are in a good state  
 of repair. There are a few overtaking 
 areas along the minor roads which car 
 drivers hope are near when they meet  
 oncoming traffic! Road users have to  
 be very alert on these narrow, country
 roads.
