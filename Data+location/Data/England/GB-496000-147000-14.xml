		<title>14GUILDFORD: TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>   Guildford is an important route     
 centre. Many main roads pass through  
 it eg. the A3 (London-Portsmouth), the
 A31 (to Farnham), the A3100 and A320. 
 Guildford has access to the new London
 Orbital Motorway (M25) via the A3. The
 High St. is now the focus of an       
 experimental pedestrianisation scheme.
   The Friary Bus Station serves the   
 whole Guildford area.                 
   Guildford has two railway stations  
 London Rd. and the main-line station  
 which has services to London (Waterloo
 Station), Portsmouth, Reading and     
 Aldershot. There are a few trains     
 which go to Leeds and Manchester via  
 Reading. There are regular bus and    
 train services to Heathrow and Gatwick
 airports.
