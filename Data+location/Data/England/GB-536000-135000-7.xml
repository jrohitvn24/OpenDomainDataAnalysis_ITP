		<content> Children in this area attend the 200+ 
 pupil Chequer Mead County Primary     
 School run by West Sussex County      
 Councilfrom its area office at        
 Crawley. Chequer Mead was East        
 grinsteads first school and has no    
 grassed playground only a tarmaced    
 area big enough for a net ball court  
 plus a learner size swimming pool.    
 This part of East Grinstead has       
 expanded in the last 5 years and there
 is now a shortage of primary school   
 places. The council is considering    
 building a larger school or           
 alternatively taking over the East    
 Grinstead youth club's and adult      
 education buildings on the Chequer    
 Mead site and converting them to      
 classrooms. A decision should be made 
 in Autumn 1985.
