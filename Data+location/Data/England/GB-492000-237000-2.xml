		<content> The largest organisation in both      
 villages is the Youth Club. The age of
 members range roughly from ten to     
 twenty years. The Club meets every    
 Monday at the Village Hall from 7pm to
 9.30pm. The Youth Leader is Mr.       
 Nicholas Hall of Whitsundales Farm.   
 Members indulge in practically every  
 type of indoor game such as snooker   
 and table tennis, often taking part in
 contests with other parties. Sometimes
 they arrange entertainment at         
 community events in the village. The  
 Wednesday Club first formed over a    
 year ago is popular among residents   
 unable to travel elsewhere for various
 reasons including lack of public      
 transport.The Club is self supporting 
 due to the efforts of five ladies who 
 keep the wheels in motion. Our W.I.is 
 very active.
