		<title>10THE POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> It is very confusing in the village of
 Souldrop. The{old school}is a post    
 office and the old post office is a   
 house!                                
                                       
  The post office and the village hall 
 share the building which was once the 
 village school.  The office is run by 
 the{sub-postmistress}and is open      
 Mondays to Fridays from 9am until 1pm.
 The main business carried out is the  
 selling of{stamps}and postal orders,  
 paying out{pensions}on Thursdays and  
 dealing with Giro bank transactions.  
 Post is collected daily from the      
 letter box at 10am and at 4pm.        
                                       
 Outside the post office is a{telephone
 call box. Calls can be dialled from   
 the box to any part of the country for
 ten pence or more depending on        
 distance.                             </content>
