		<content> The parish church at Chettle is united
 with that at Ashmore which shares its 
 rector.                               
 The churches at Tarrant Hinton and    
 Gunville are under the auspices       
 of the incumbent in charge of all of  
 the Tarrant Valley parishes, whose    
 modern rectory is situated at Tarrant 
 Hinton.                               
 There is a monthly rota of poorly     
 attended services but a willing band  
 of helpers (not all of whom attend    
 services) turn up to clean the        
 churches and form working paries for  
 churchyard clearance etc. Tarrant     
 Hinton is beautifully cared for by one
 devoted lady parishoner.              
 Other branches of Christianity are    
 represented and of other religions at 
 least one buddist convert is          
 recognised.
