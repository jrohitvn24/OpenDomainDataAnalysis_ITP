 There is general concern over the     
 political scene in our modern world   
 several people having expressed fears 
 over the Russian influences on the    
 whole of the western world            
 Generally people have a very          
 optimistic outlook for the future and 
 feel that we have a lot to            
 be thankful for in this part of the   
 country                               
 The age of the micro-chip is viewed   
 with a certain amount of caution      
 although it is generally accepted that
 used properly it can be of great      
 benefit to society as a whole         
 The family unit is seen as a most     
 important part for the stability of   
 the county, country and the world and 
 greater emphasis should be put on this
 when using modern technology
