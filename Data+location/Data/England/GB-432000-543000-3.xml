		<content>  The ancient name{PITTINGDUN}tells the
 story of its origin.{DUN}or{DON}is the
 Saxon word for{HILL}and{PITTING}      
 denotes the{CLAN OF THE PITTS};the    
 people who first reclaimed and        
 occupied the land.Therefore the name  
 Pittington really means the "hillside 
 settlements of the Pitts."            
   Low Pittington stands on the site of
 the original settlement, dated c. 624.
 Later a second village at Hallgarth   
 sprang up and with it a "little town" 
 on the spot where Littletown Farm now 
 stands.                               
   The present villages of High        
 Pittington and Littletown became      
 established with the up-surge of      
 railways and mining. To each village  
 an estate of council houses was added 
 after the First World War, and at the 
 present time Priors Grange, an estate 
 of private dwellings, is being built. </content>
