		<content> There is no{shop}in the village other 
 than the{Post Office,}for stamps and  
 stationery, or The Parish Oven{public 
{house}where I can buy sweets, crisps  
 or drinks. The Post Office will soon  
 close down, like the sweetshop did in 
 1981. We can buy eggs and cheese from 
 the{farms,}and{bread}is delivered     
 every Wednesday and Saturday, and{milk
 on Tuesday,Thursday and Saturday. We  
 also have a{grocer}delivering every   
 Thursday. A daily newspaper is        
 delivered every day except Sunday.The 
{ice cream van }comes at the weekend   
 and I sometimes buy a 12p cornet and  
 sometimes we have a  50p block for    
 tea. We go by car to Tesco supermarket
 in{Worksop}on Friday for groceries and
 sometimes we go to{Sheffield}for      
 clothes. If we only want a few small  
 things like, torch batteries, we might
 go to{Kiveton.   }                    </content>
