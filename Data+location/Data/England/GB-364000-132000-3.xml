		<title>03 HUGH SEXEY OF BRUTON.</title>
		<content>  Hugh Sexey was born in the middle    
of the sixteenth century.He was the son
of poor parents.We do not know for     
certain where he was born,although the 
surname Sexey appears on the parish    
register.He was a clever man and,like  
many others,became wealthy during the  
Reformation,acquiring considerable     
property.In 1599 he was made a governor
of the Free Grammar School of Bruton.  
    He built a house in Bruton,"on the 
west side of the town near Wynne's     
well."It has been suggested that he    
lived in the mill at West End,but in   
1795 this was called Swanton's House.  
In fact he preferred living in his     
other house in Wedmore.In his will,he  
left money for the poor of Bruton.This 
built Sexey's Hospital.Later some money
went to Sexey's School.
