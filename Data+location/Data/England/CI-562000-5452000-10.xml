		<title>10Water Supply _ Handois</title>
		<content>      Jersey's dense population makes  
 a very heavy demand on the limited    
 water supply. Water catchment is      
 limited to four of five narrow valleys
 with a stream running along its base. 
 One such valley is known as Waterworks
 Valley in the parish of St. Lawrence. 
 It has three small reservoirs, Handois
 being the most northerly one along    
 this picturesque valley. It also acts 
 as a pumping and filtration station   
 within the overall system. It also    
 boasts a trout hatchery to provide the
 reservoirs with their pollution early 
 warning system.                       
      In 1985 the States of Jersey are 
 still debating after about five years 
 whether there is a need to flood yet  
 another valley in the east of the     
 Island, called Queen's Valley.
