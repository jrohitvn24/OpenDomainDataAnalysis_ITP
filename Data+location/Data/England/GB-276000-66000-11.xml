		<content> Mr. Warren helped us discover how life
 had changed here since 1926 when he   
 came to the area to farm at           
 Newtake,Staverton.There were some 30  
{farms}of various sizes then and each  
 farm employed from 10 to 25 men.The   
 average wage was about Â£2 plus 'perks'
 They lived in{cottages}that seem to   
 have gone now,and on the farms        
 themselves.They were mostly           
 hard-working contented men who        
 considered themselves so much better  
 off than the men in mines and         
 factories.We can see now why there is 
 so much unemployment today as the farm
 machines are so good at doing the     
 men's work.                           
      The{roads}here were often almost 
 overgrown in the summer and muddy and 
 pitted in the winter.
