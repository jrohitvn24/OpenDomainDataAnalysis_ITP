		<title>05CHURCH AND PRIORY</title>
		<content> The church is a good example of a     
 monastic church. It was shared by     
 the monks and the people of the       
 village, but there were always        
 arguments between them. Eventually a  
 big screen was built  across the      
 church to divide it. The monks used   
 one side of the screen and the        
 villagers used the other.             
 The tower has eight bells in it, the  
 oldest one was made in 1673. The      
 chimes play a different tune every day
 at one, five and nine o'clock,        
 changing to carols at Christmas time.
