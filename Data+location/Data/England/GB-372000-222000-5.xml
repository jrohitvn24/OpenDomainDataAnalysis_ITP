 A typical day for the Boaitts is to   
 get up at 6,45 a.m. and have a cup of 
 tea. The children then get up and have
 breakfast. Mr. Boaitt goes to work and
 Mrs. Boaitt cleans up which takes     
 until 9.00. She then takes the twins  
 to the play group in Tibberton and    
 this gives her time to look after the 
 baby, housework and shopping. Before  
 lunch she has to pick the twins up. At
 1.45 some friends come to play for the
 afternoon. At 5.00 they then have tea 
 and if the weather is good they have a
 walk after tea. At the end of the day 
 the children have a bath which takes  
 till about 6.30 when Mr. Boaitt comes 
 home. The children go to bed at 7.00  
 and Mr. and Mrs. Boaitt can then      
 relax. They go to bed at about 12.00.
