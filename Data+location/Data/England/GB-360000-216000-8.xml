   {FLOWER ARRANGING}                  
                                       
   You have to take your own flowers   
 and buy some oasis and a dish to put  
 them in. There are two ladies to help 
 you arrange your flowers and you can  
 buy some ribbon. The cost of the oasis
 is 15p and the dishes are 15p. We go  
 on a Monday and we have competitions  
 at Christmas. There are different     
 groups for their ages.                
                                       
    {BROWNIES}                         
                                       
   You are allowed to go when you are  
 7-11. You can make things and you can 
 get badges like 'The Pet Lovers' which
 means you look after your pet. They go
 out for trips. At the end they say    
 pow-wow.
