		<title>06STOKE DOYLE CHURCH</title>
		<content>   Unusually this church is called     
 St.Rumbold's. It is situated about 100
 metres from the pub at the centre of  
 the village along Church Walk. The    
 present building is said to date back 
 to about 1200, although the register  
 only dates back to 1650. In the       
 eighteenth century the church fell    
 into decay so it was pulled down      
 completely and a new one built in     
 1722.It is the only eighteenth century
 church in the area which makes it even
 more unusual. It even has a flat      
 roof! Inside the church is very       
 symmetrical and is an L-shape with a  
 side-chapel containing lovely marble  
 statue of Sir Edward Ward erected in  
 1725. Inside the church there are 23  
 pews each of which can seat four or   
 five people. Some of us went up the   
 belfry and one of the group even      
 showed us how to ring the bells!      </content>
