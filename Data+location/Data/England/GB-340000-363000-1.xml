     This area, to the south east of   
 Chester is mostly rural: some market  
 gardening near the city but largely   
 dairy farming.                        
                                       
     There are two large schools, an FE
 college, two army establishments and  
 the River Dee in this area.           
     Life in this area is quite relaxed
 although the one square kilometre in  
 the city is often thronged with       
 tourists.                             
     A by-road through the area keeps  
 much of the traffic away from the     
 residential areas but the congestion  
 on the roads is still sufficiently    
 horrendous to keep most Cestrians away
 from the centre on Saturdays.
