		<title>12PUTLANDS FARM, FAIRWARP</title>
		<content> At Putlands Farm, Fairwarp, the owners
 are experimenting with milking dairy  
 sheep. Jacob and Friesland sheep are  
 used mainly. 150 sheep are kept; 40   
 are milked. Each sheep produces       
 approximately two litres of milk per  
 day.                                  
 Four day old lambs are bottle fed     
 so that ewes can be milked. The       
 sheep's diet is enriched with         
 hydroponically grown wheat, oats and  
 beansprouts. Sheep's milk is more     
 easily digestible than cow's or goat's
 milk and does not cause allergies. The
 milk is made into yoghourt and cheese 
 and can also be frozen in bags. At    
 present it is mainly sold in health   
 shops.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
