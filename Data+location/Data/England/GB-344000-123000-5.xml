		<content> I get up at 8 o'clock,dress in my     
 school clothes which are blue and     
 white,then I go downstairs for        
 breakfast.I eat toast with            
 marmite.After that I wash my face with
 a flannel and clean my teeth with my  
 yellow toothbrush.I feed my fish,then 
 I go to school.My sister takes me     
 across the road to my friend's        
 house.Her Dad takes us to school in   
 his car.We have a little playtime     
 until the bell rings at 9 o'clock.It  
 is Wednesday so we go to church.After 
 church we do maths.,then we go to     
 Street swimming pool in a coach.When  
 we come back we have our lunch,I eat  
 sandwiches.In the afternoon we do our 
 topic work about the Elizabethans,then
 we go out to play.I might play French 
 elastic where we jump in and out of a 
 piece of elastic. After school I may  
 have a piano lesson or go to Brownies.</content>
