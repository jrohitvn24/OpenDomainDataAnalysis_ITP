 The nearest railway station from Coads
 Green is Liskeard which is about 11   
 miles away.                           
 There are two bus lines that pass     
 through the grid,the 76 and the 77.The
 76 is the most frequent coming from   
 Plymouth via Callington to Launceston.
 There are 5 buses a day on this       
 service.The 77 runs 1 bus on Tuesday  
 and Friday only.Few people use the bus
 for commuting or shopping.The service 
 is used by old people or people       
 without a car .where I live its 2.5   
 miles to the nearest bus stop.Almost  
 everybody in our villagehas a car.    
 It is not a good service if you want  
 to go out in the evening as the last  
 bus back from Launceston is at 17.15. 
 To get anywhere in our grid it is     
 essential to have a car.
