		<title>03THE CHURCH IN COLYTON</title>
		<content> St.Andrews Church,the main            
 place of worship, is in the middle of 
 Colyton. This is the Anglican         
 Parish Church. The present vicar is   
 Rev.Harry Rann. There is a Methodist  
 Church at the top of King Street,     
 built in 1814 as a Congregational     
 Chapel. It was enlarged in 1831. There
 is a Gospel Hall in West Street (the  
 Butts). There is another small chapel 
 in the cemetery, on New Sidmouth Road.
 There used to be a Unitarian Chapel in
 Church Street; this was closed years  
 ago and is now used as a youth club.An
 interesting fact is that at one time  
 the minister there was Dr.Manton, one 
 of Cromwell's chaplains. The Revd. J B
 Smith, a minor poet, was also         
 minister there.
