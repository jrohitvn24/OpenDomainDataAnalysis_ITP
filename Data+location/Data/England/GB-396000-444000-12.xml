		<title>12OAK CLIFF FARM</title>
		<content>   Our farm,including all 543.5 acres, 
 is rented from various people.Fields  
 are used for hay and livestock.       
   We have approximately 350 sheep,    
 which graze on the high moors.The     
 dairy cattle numbers range from 50 to 
 60 and they graze much nearer to home 
 for milking.The cattle numbers are    
 restricted by the milk quota,which is 
 400,000 litres a year.Nowadays milking
 is done by machines.                  
   We have 3 milking parlours each     
 holding 12 cows.Our cows are          
 predominantly Friesians,occasionally  
 we keep a Jersey.                     
   We collect about 50 eggs a day from 
 our hens.                             
   Our 8 barns store hay.Usually we cut
 and bale our own hay.We have a mower, 
 tractor,baler and centipede which     
 shakes the hay out.The finished bales 
 are taken to the barn by trailer.     </content>
