		<title>15Quinton Green Farm Grassland</title>
		<content> Quinton Green Farm covers 800 acres,  
 bordering the M1 motorway, Quinton    
 Village, Preston Deanery, and Salcey  
 Forest. One third of the farm is used 
 as grassland, which provides two cuts 
 of silage per year and summer grazing 
 for 350 head of Pedigree Friesians    
 cows. 90% of the cows calve between   
 August and November.                  
 The cows are artificially inseminated 
 by the cowmen with top Pedigree       
 Friesian/Holsten semen; embryo from   
 the best cows, in the not too distant 
 future, will be implanted in good     
 breeding cows.In winter the cows      
 occupy a 180' x 114' clear span       
 building. Each cow has it's own       
 sleeping cubicle from which the dung  
 is automatically scraped into an      
 underground pit. From here it passes  
 into a 20'high, 60'diameter slurry    
 tower.                                </content>
