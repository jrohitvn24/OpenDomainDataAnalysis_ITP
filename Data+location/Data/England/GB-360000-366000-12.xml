 The spire of St John's Parish Church  
 Over can be seen for many miles. The  
 church stands halfway along Delamere  
 Street, with the recently built       
 vicarage and community centre opposite
 it. The church foundation stone was   
 laid in 1860, and it was built by Hugh
 Delamere, 2nd Baron, in memory of his 
 wife. It was consecrated in 1863.     
   The church serves a large parish,   
 with many new houses being built in   
 the last 30 years.                    
   The school was in existence for a   
 number of years before the present    
 building was erected. The old Over    
 Market Hall was probably used. In 1858
 Lord Delamere gave some land for a    
 school to be built,and the first entry
 in the school logbook is June 1st 1863
 The attendance was 91.Now in 1985 it  
 has 85 on roll and a staff of 4.      </content>
