		<content> Fyne Court, Broomfield, was built in  
 1629. In 1791 it was said to be 'a    
 handsome house with elegantly disposed
 plantations', but in the 1850s Mrs    
 Crosse said that it was 'of moderate  
 size, much enlarged and altered by    
 successive possessors so that it can  
 only boast of its antiquity and       
 irregularity'. Andrew Crosse used many
 of the rooms as laboratories.         
 Only the music room and the library   
 survived the fire of 1898, together   
 with the old coach house, cellars,    
 engine room and stables. The grounds  
 were landscaped by 1812 and include a 
 lake with a boathouse, two ponds, a   
 large walled garden and a folly built 
 as a summerhouse and later as kennels.
