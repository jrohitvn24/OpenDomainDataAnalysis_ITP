		<title>17DONYATT POTTERY</title>
		<content> Records show that there has been a    
 pottery industry in the Horton and    
 Donyatt area since the thirteenth     
 century.Since the Second World War,   
 the amount of pottery made has        
 declined, but in previous centuries   
 the potteries in this area provided   
 most of the pottery used in this part 
 of the west country. There is a       
 collection of typical pieces in the   
 Castle Museum in Taunton, and there is
 even some in the Smithsonian Institute
 in Washington, U.S.A.                 
   The clay for the pots was all dug   
 locally and there were many sites     
 which had kilns. Archaeologists from  
 Taunton excavated some of the sites a 
 few years ago, and are about to       
 publish a report on the dig. Pieces of
 pottery can be easily found in the    
 fields of Horton and Donyatt.
