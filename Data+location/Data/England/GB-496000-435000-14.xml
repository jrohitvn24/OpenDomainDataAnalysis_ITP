		<title>14WALKINGTON SOCIAL CONCERNS.</title>
		<content>  BASED ON A SURVEY OF 200 HOUSEHOLDERS
 73% OF THE VILLAGERS ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT
 THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS,ALTHOUGH MANY
 OF THEM LIVE IN THE EARLY 70's ESTATES
 WHICH MADE FAR GREATER LOCAL IMPACT.  
  REASONS FOR DISSATISFACTION ARE a_BAD
 DESIGN NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A VILLAGE; 
 b_BUILDING DENSITY AND THE LOSS OF    
 GREEN AREAS;c_THE LOSS OF A VILLAGE   
 ENVIRONMENT.                          
  11% OF THE POPULATION QUOTED THE     
 "VILLAGE ATMOSPHERE" AS THE MOST      
 DESIRABLE QUALITIES ABOUT WALKINGTON  
 AND DID NOT WANT TO SEE IT DISAPPEAR. 
  PACKED PUBLIC MEETINGS HAD CHOSEN    
 "INFILLING",WITH A STRICT LIMITATION  
 ON BUILDING BOUNDARIES TO PRESERVE    
 CERTAIN GREEN AREAS,eg THE NORTHGATE  
 PADDOCK,AND TO KEEP WITHIN THE        
 BUILDING ENVELOPE.THE PARISH COUNCIL  
 WITH THE BOROUGH COUNCIL WERE TO SERVE
 AS WATCHDOGS OVER THE DEVELOPMENTS.   </content>
