 PARKING THEIR VEHICLES,ESPECIALLY THE 
 CARS IN WESTOWN.IN THE SUMMER THE     
 TOURISTS MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT  
 TO PARK AND GET AROUND.MANY PEOPLE WHO

 SHOPPING AND GETTING AROUND.IN OUR    
 AREA THERE IS ALSO A FERRY.IT RUNS    
 FROM HAYLING TO PORTSMOUTH.A RETURN   
 TICKET COSTS Â£0.50 FOR CHILDREN AND   
 Â£1.00 FOR ADULTS.BUSES RUN REGULAR    
 TRIPS ALL OVER THE ISLAND.THEY COME   
 FROM MENGHAM(NOT IN OUR AREA).MANY    
 CHILDREN GO HOME FROM SCHOOL BY BUS.ON
 SUNDAY,ABOUT 5 O'CLOCK IF IT'S NICE   
 THERE ARE HUGE TRAFFIC JAMS FROM THE  
 BEACH RIGHT OFF THE ISLAND.IT TAKES   
 ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR TO GET

 THE TRADE.
