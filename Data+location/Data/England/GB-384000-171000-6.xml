		<content>      Because this is an attractive    
 area there is an inflow of people who 
 can pay high prices for houses. This  
 includes a high proportion of retired 
 people.                               
      Because of the decline in        
 employment in this rural area,        
 increased house prices, and poor      
 public transport there has been an    
 outflow of younger people seeking     
 jobs, housing and other amenities.  At
 the same time, the older members of   
 the community who have roots in the   
 area are becoming fewer in number.    
      This shift in population has lead
 to other changes such a considerable  
 reduction in the number of children at
 the village school.There are now only 
 27 pupils.                            
      Meanwhile there is constant      
 employment for building craftsmen who 
 specialise in renovating old cottages.</content>
