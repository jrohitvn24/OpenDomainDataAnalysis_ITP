		<title>17Hall Engineering</title>
		<content> Hall Engineering is a new firm. The   
 machinery in use is designed by Mr.   
 Hall himself, and is very modern. One 
 is controlled by two computers. The   
 firm manufactures elevator webs for   
 harvesting vegetables. The elevator   
 webs are made of rubber straps and    
 steel bars. The steel bars start off  
 as a coil of steel which weigh a ton. 
 It is fed through rollers to iron     
 out any kinks, and then put inside a  
 furnace. A press guided by a magic eye
 shapes the bars. After cooling they   
 are brittle and can be snapped off.   
 The bars are heated up again to make  
 them springy. Then rubber which is    
 reinforced with cotton fibres has     
 holes and grooves put in and it is    
 attached with an automatic riveter to 
 the bars. To finish it off it is      
 dipped  in tyre paint which dries in  
 lO minutes. {Rachael Hindmarch        </content>
