 services. Children from the region    
 attend Brightwalton Primary School and

 Comprehensive School at Compton some 6
 miles to the east. The county council 
 provide a coach as transport to the   
 2 schools. The post office as part of 
 its service runs a mini-bus which can 
 be taken to Newbury but this is quite 
 irregular and depends on deliveries   
 and collections. Doctors surgeries are
