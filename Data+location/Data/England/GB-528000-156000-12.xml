		<content>Coulsdon used to be a farming          
community, but only two farms remain,  
Woodplace and Hooley. Woodplace        
sustained an arson attempt during this 
year when old vehicles housed there    
were damaged by fire, and a mugging    
occurred three days later. Hooley farm 
used to be a dairy farm but it was     
changed into a stud and donkey         
breeding farm recently. Portnalls,     
Bradmore, Tollers, Marlpit and         
Placehouse farm have now disappeared   
as farms but are remembered in houses  
and road names. The area now has a     
council estate and a large area   of   
detached and semi-detached houses.     
Many people have more hi-tec things    
like : dishwashers, telephones,        
tumble-driers, videos, hi-fi systems   
and televisions. General changes are   
more litter, more cars and vandalism.
