		<title>06BARNARD CASTLE STREET MARKET</title>
		<content> I have been selling material on       
 Barnard Castle market for 28 years,   
 since I was 16 years old.I also go to 
 Bishop Auckland,Otley and Bedale,so I 
 do a lot of travelling round in my van
 .My day starts at 6.45am when I put up
 my stall and set out my goods.In      
 summer this is pleasant,but it can be 
 rough in winter when it is wet,windy  
 or snowing,as I must be careful not to
 get my material wet or dirty and of   
 course,trade is not good in bad       
 weather.The market is not as busy as  
 it was years ago,perhaps because      
 people have cars and go to larger     
 towns to shop.We take our stalls down 
 again at 4.45pm so it is a long day.  
 You have to have a sense of humour and
 be friendly in this job or you will   
 not be successful.I like the outdoor  
 life and meeting people.I could not do
 anything else to earn a living.       </content>
