		<content>    On Tuesday we went for a walk      
 around our Domesday patch.  As we went
 we came to more and more stinging     
 nettles and brambles.  We got stung   
 and scratched and our feet started to 
 ache; it also got very hot.           
    We saw a lot of different birds:   
 yellowhammers, housemartins, swallows,
 partridges and pheasants.  We also    
 found out what was growing in the     
 fields, like sugar-beet, wheat, maize,
 barley, peas and oil-seed rape.       
    When we had got to the old airfield
 Chris dropped all his empty shotgun   
 cartridges he had been collecting.  We
 ended up at the Crawleys' farm and    
 they let us have a swim in their      
 swimming pool.                        
    Then we had a ride back to school  
 in Mr. Bailey's Volkswagen camper.    
 Most of us went home and had a long   
 sleep.                                </content>
