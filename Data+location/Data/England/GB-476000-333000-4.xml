		<content> The sort of animals farmers keep      
 now are cows pigs hens and sheep.Most 
 hens are now kept in batteries but    
 they used to be able to run around.Not
 all hens are kept in batteries some   
 are kept in large buildings called    
 litter houses as the floor is covered 
 with straw or shavings.The hens can   
 not get out but they can roam about   
 inside them.Hens are used for their   
 eggs and meat and sheep are kept for  
 their wool and meat.A lot of sheep    
 together are called a flock and once  
 or twice a year they have to be dipped
 to keep away diseases and they have to
 sheared once a year in around May or  
 July because they would be too        
 hot.Pigs are kept for their meat and  
 cows are kept for meat and milk.
