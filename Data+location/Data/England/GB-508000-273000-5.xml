		<content> It was felt necessary to refer to this
 former airfield, now a proposed Cruise
 Missile base, which lies immediately  
 to the North/West of the survey area. 
                                       
 Residents of Catworth, being South of 
 the A604, do not find much disruption 
 but at times of demonstrations by anti
 nuclear protestors, problems are found
 with parking of cars at Leighton and  
 the sheer number of people in Brington
                                       
 In February 1985 a fence was erected  
 round the proposed base.  Ignoring the
 opinions for or against the principle,
 it was felt locally to be well-planned
                                       
 Time will tell whether the children at
 the area school will be affected by   
 the changes and whether living in the 
 villages will be different.  Meanwhile
 life goes on much as before.          </content>
