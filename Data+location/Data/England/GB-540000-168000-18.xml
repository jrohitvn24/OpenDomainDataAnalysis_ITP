		<title>18Half Term in Bromley</title>
		<content> I go to Horniman's Museum.I make clay 
things and straw things and papier     
mache.I go on Saturdays and half terms.
I made a clay dish.First I made a clay 
slab.I went round the Museum and I     
looked for four patterns.I went back.  
Then I cut them out.Then I printed onto
clay.Then Carol glazed it and put it in
the kiln.Girl aged 7.                  
                                       
 My Dad was doing our drive which was  
our front garden.First we lifted up the
grass and mud and took it to the tip.  
Then we marked out where we were going 
to put the drive and we dug a trench.  
We filled it with bricks and tiles.Then
we put sand on the bricks.Then we put  
concrete.Then we pushed a machine      
called a Whacker over them.Boy aged 7.
