		<title>17Local Government in Horton</title>
		<content> Decisions regarding how the village is
 governed are taken by people miles    
 away.                                 
                                       
{A Parish Council}of seven residents   
 meets monthly but has no real power.  
                                       
 There is a district councillor on {   
{Craven District Council} which meets  
 20 miles away in Skipton.  We have a  
 County Councillor who represents      
 several villages.  The {County Council
 meets in Northallerton about 60 miles 
 across the hills.                     
                                       
{The Yorkshire Dales National Park     
{Committee}has powers over some        
 activities of residents.              
                                       
{Our Member of Parliament}has one of   
 the largest constituencies in the     
 country, so rarely visits Horton.     </content>
