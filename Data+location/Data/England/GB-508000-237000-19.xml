		<title>19MORE OLD HOUSES IN CLOPHILL</title>
		<content>  Parts of the brick buildings which   
 form{34 High Street}go back to{Tudor  
 times, with many later additions. It  
 was used as a butcher shop &amp; slaughter
 house, later it was a hat factory. It 
 is now a private house, the old{pump  
 can still be seen in the garden.      
{ 19 High Street}is built of local     
 brick &amp; was formerly a dairy farm. The
{pump}in the front yard was last used  
 in{1942.}Mrs.Robinson was born here &amp; 
 went to our school until she was 14.  
 She then sold milk by ladling it in   
 measures from a pail into a jug. The  
 cows were kept in the field behind the
 school &amp; milked twice daily at no.19. 
  Other notable buildings, although not
 houses, are the{lock-up}where drunks  
 were incarcerated until they were     
 sober, &amp; the{pound}where stray animals
 were kept until they were claimed.
