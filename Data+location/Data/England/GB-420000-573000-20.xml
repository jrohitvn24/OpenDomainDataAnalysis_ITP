		<content> This Domesday Project has been        
 produced by children aged 7-9 years   
 from two neighbouring First Schools,  
 Seaton Burn with their teacher        
 Alan Wilson, their photographer       
 Malcolm Cowley and Dinnington Village 
 with their teacher Jennifer Dobson.   
                                       
 The Headteachers and staffs of both   
 schools have generously assisted the  
 study with help, encouragement and    
 advice.                               
                                       
 The assistance and patience of the    
 people of Seaton Burn and             
 Dinnington is acknowledged, without   
 their help and contributions this     
 Project could not have been produced.
