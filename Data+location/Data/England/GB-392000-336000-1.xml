		<content>  {LANDSCAPE.} -The area covered is    
very rural with virtually no industry. 
There are no large towns and only one  
village of any size; FULFORD, which    
has the primary school working with us 
on this Project. The area does not     
include our school, but does include a 
large part of our catchment area and   
although Fulford is not included, a few
children do attend ALLEYNES.           
  {LOCAL HISTORY.}-ALLEYNES School was 
founded in 1558 in Stone and although  
the major town in the area it was not  
mentioned in the original DOMESDAY.    
 There are however a number of villages
within a Five mile radius which were   
included and still exist today such as 
Fulford, Cotwalton and Moddershall.    
 References to these were made in an   
English translation of Domesday by     
Dr.H.Malcolm Fraser, Headmaster of     
ALLEYNES GRAMMAR SCHOOL -1916 to 1936. </content>
