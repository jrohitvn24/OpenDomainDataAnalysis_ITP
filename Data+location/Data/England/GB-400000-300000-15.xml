		<title>15MRS.MEEKE'S MEMORIES.</title>
		<content> Mrs. Meeke has lived in Rushall for   
 over seventy years. She moved into    
 Rushall when she was nine. She        
 remembers the time when there was a   
 fire station in Daw End Lane and a    
 police station opposite the wine bar. 
 The fire station had only one fire    
 engine. She can remember when Rushall 
 had its own registrar. When anyone was
 born or when anyone died their name   
 had to be registered. Now the nearest 
 police station and fire station is in 
 Aldridge and the registrars office is 
 in Walsall. In the middle of Rushall  
 was a weighbridge where carts and     
 their loads could be weighed.There was
 also a trough for the horses to drink 
 from and a clock. All of these have   
 now gone.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
