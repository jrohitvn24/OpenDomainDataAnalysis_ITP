		<title>03 THE RACECOURSE</title>
		<content>Many years ago the Racecourse was used 
for horseracing. Nowadays it is used   
for sports activities such as football,
tennis, cricket, hockey and rugby. Many
people jog around the racecourse to    
keep fit. Sometimes Funfairs come to   
the racecourse and stay for several    
days at a time. A lot of tramps hang   
around at night. It is dangerous to    
walk through the racecourse at night   
because many muggings have happened    
there just recently. The Northampton   
American Footballers started training  
at the racecourse. It is one of the    
best play parks in my area and is close
to the town centre and Northampton's   
Roman Catholic Cathedral on the Barrack
Road.

School, Northampton.
