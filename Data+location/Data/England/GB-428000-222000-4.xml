		<title>04NATURE AND CHURCHILL</title>
		<content>  Almost all the arable land around the
 village is now devoted to winter wheat
 (the result of EEC agricultural       
 policy).   This monoculture, with the 
 associated intensive spraying and     
 hedge removal, severely reduces the   
 number of plant, insect and animal    
 species in the fields.   On the       
 positive side however, the road       
 verges, left uncut because of         
 economies by the District Council,    
 show an increasing variety of         
 flowering plants, and along with this 
 an increase in the range of insect    
 life.   Just now (August) the verges  
 are colourful with scabious, knapweed,
 bellflower, yarrow, tansy and         
 toadflax.                             
  There are several public footpaths   
 and bridleways around Churchill, and  
 these, particularly the latter, are   
 regularly used.                       </content>
