		<content> In our family there are three of us,my
 mother,my father and myself.We live in
 a four bedroomed bungalow with a self 
 contained annex attached to it.We have
 an acre of garden with a river running
 throught it.We grow all our own       
 vegetables and soft fruit.We have two 
 pear trees as well.My dad works as a  
 dentist in Truro.Our main activity is 
 sailing and we go out most weekends.We
 have two boats and two dinghies.I also
 enjoy playing musical instruments,    
 swimming and riding.My mothers hobbies
 include tennis and badminton.During   
 the Summer we holiday in Wales where  
 we go sailing with a number of        
 friends.We have been doing this for   
 years now.We also windsurf and        
 fish in the sea.Winter evenings are   
 another favourite time when we sit    
 round our open fire and roast         
 chestnuts.                            </content>
