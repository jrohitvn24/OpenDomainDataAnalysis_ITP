		<title>14THE REDGRAVE THEATRE (cont.)</title>
		<content> Sir Michael Redgrave placed a 'time   
 Capsule' in the foundations. Princess 
 Margaret opened the theatre and       
 watched a play,specially written for  
 the event by William Douglas Home. She
 returned for the 10th Anniversary and 
 again witnessed the first showing of  
 another play by Mr Home.              
 The theatre is paid for by local      
 support groups and contributions from 
 local people and companies. One of the
 fund raising events is the annual     
 garden party in the grounds.This is   
 well supported by many popular actors 
 and actresses.                        
  The main theatre is quite small and  
 retains an intimate quality. Meals and
 snacks are available and the Castle   
 Club Room is open to private members. 
 The name of this club is a reminder of
 the original theatre which started in 
 a disused barn in Castle Street.      </content>
