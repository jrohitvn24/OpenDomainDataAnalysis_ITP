		<content> Crawley Down and Turners Hill lie     
 respectively 30 and 32 miles south of 
{London,}4 miles west of{East Grinstead
 and 5 miles east of{Crawley.          
   Crawley Down was a{common}which was 
 enclosed in the 19th. century. In the 
 1970's Crawley Down more than doubled 
 in size when old{brickworking}land was
 released for housing. To the north, by
 the{A.264}road, lies{Snowhill,}a      
 settlement, also once a common. To the
 north east of the village lies an area
 called{Furnace Wood,}because of the   
{iron workings}which were once there.  
   Turners Hill began as a settlement  
 built around a crossroads as early as 
 the 15th. century.{Rowfant}is a hamlet
 which grew up around{Rowfant House,}a 
 mile west of the two main villages. To
 the south west lies{Worth Abbey;}once 
 part of the{Paddockhurst Estate,}which
 owns hundreds of acres in the area.   </content>
