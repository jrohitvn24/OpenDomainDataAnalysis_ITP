		<title>03Houses in Caterham Drive</title>
		<content> I live in a road called Caterham      
Drive. Most of the houses are bungalows
detached or semi-detached. There are no
flats. There are roughly 280 houses but
it is a long street. There is one      
family living in each house and each   
house has three or four bedrooms. All  
the houses have both back and front    
gardens. Caterham Drive is in a valley 
with very steep sides. This can be     
annoying to those with long slim       
gardens as it is difficult to mow the  
lawn. Quite a number of people have    
either cats or dogs and there is an    
average of four people living in each  
house.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
