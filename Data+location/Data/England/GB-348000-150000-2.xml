		<title>02LAND USE, SOUTH MENDIP HILLS</title>
		<content> Main present day land use of the land 
 is in large measure a response to very
 varied physical conditions. From the  
 warmer south facing footslope with its
 well drained brown earth soils to the 
 colder, wetter and more exposed       
 plateau with thinner soils developed  
 on{carboniferous limestone.}Land use  
 varies from intensive fruit, vegetable
 and flower growing to more extensive  
 forms on the plateau. Important       
 deciduous woods exist on the steep    
 slope (Stoke Woods) and the influence 
 of physical conditions is manifest in 
 the use of{dolomitic conglomerate     
 stone in the village and the existence
 of an important limestone quarry      
 (Westbury Quarry) in square 5050. The 
 plateau is characterised by frequent  
 rocky outcrops and much of the land is
 covered by scrub vegetation.
