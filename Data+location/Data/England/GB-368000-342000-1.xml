		<content> Buerton is a sparsely populated sleepy
 village situated on the Cheshire/     
 Shropshire/Staffordshire borders. It  
 is a flat grassland area, the greenery
 occasionally broken with the 20 farms 
 &amp; the residential area of the village.
 An intensive dairying area with the   
 main accent on milk production but    
 some farms are rearing calves, beef   
 cattle &amp; sheep. The majority of       
 residents are self employed but       
 professional people have settled &amp;    
 they commute to the surrounding       
 Cheshire &amp; pottery towns. A new       
 housing development at Windmill Green 
 is in progress with no public trans-  
 port to speak of, the majority of     
 families are car owners. The nearest  
 post offices &amp; shops are in the       
 neighbouring villages of Woore &amp;      
 Audlem.
