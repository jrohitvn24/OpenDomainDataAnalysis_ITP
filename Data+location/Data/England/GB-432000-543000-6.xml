		<content>   The other wall-painting shows when  
 Cuthbert,nearing the end of his life, 
 went round to visit all his friends in
 the north. While he was staying at the
 Abbey of Abbess Aelfleda he had a     
 vision of someone holy falling out of 
 a tree.At the same time a shepherd had
 really fallen out of a tree.          
   The next alterations were made by   
 Bishop Pudsey and his masons.They made
 some amazing arches which consisted of
 precise masonry and dogtooth moulding.
 It was so accurate that the blocks of 
 stone could be turned upside down and 
 still fit together.                   
    In Norman times there wasn't any   
 tower and the present one was added to
 the West end of the nave in the late  
 12th century.                         
   We think the church is one of the   
 most beautiful Parish Churches and    
 Architectural treasures of the country</content>
