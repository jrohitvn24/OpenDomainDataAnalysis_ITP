		<title>14The Sewage works Edenbridge</title>
		<content>The Edenbridge sewage works have been  
there since 1957. The land was         
originally used for farming. The sewage
works serves the whole of Edenbridge. 1
million litres of sewage is processed  
on average a day. The sewage is used   
for fertilizer and is said to be better
fertilizer than farmland manure. The   
clean effluent goes into River Eden.   
The sewage is turned into clean        
effluent in stages. At first it get    
rids of unwanted items by passing it   
through grids. The next stage removes  
the sand and grit. This is done in a   
channel where the sand &amp; grit settle at
the bottom. The sewage then goes into  
sedimentation tanks where raw sludge is
removed leaving settled sewage. The    
nutrients and the rest of the organic  
material is then removed by biological 
filter beds. This then leaves the      
treated sewage or effluent.            </content>
