		<title>01DISTRICT OF NORTH KESTEVEN</title>
		<content> This area of arable farmland is in the
 district of North Kesteven in South   
 Lincolnshire.Oolitic limestone lies   
 over clay and was under glaciers      
 during the last Ice Age.The A15 road  
 crosses the A52 and the largest       
 village is Osbournby on the A15.The   
 population is low and still in        
 decline and there are few amenities   
 in the block.Very few of the          
 inhabitants are directly concerned    
 with farming and most are incomers    
 with husband and wife both in         
 employment outside the block.Most     
 people have cars as there is little   
 public transport.There is only 1      
 Primary School and all 11+ education  
 is outside the block.Most building is 
 vernacular styled limestone and red   
 clay pantiles.Travelling bank,library 
 and shops visit the block.
