 3.{Timber-}This has to be over 4 m in 
 length and have a minimum of 18 cms   
 diameter at the end of the tree       
 after topping. Fresh felled timber is 
 measured by the cubic metre. This goes
 to sawmills within a 100 km radius and
 is used for fencing, planking, and in 
 house building.                       
 The{Douglas Fir}is the most valuable  
 tree and fetches around Â£47/cubic     
 metre. However, when replanting, these
 trees need to be fenced as they are   
 liked by deer. This is not the case   
 with the{Corsican Pine}which is       
 becoming popular as it has a good     
 growth rate that is almost 2 times    
 that of{Scots Pine}and the wood is    
 less knotted. This fetches around     
 Â£37/cubic metre and{Scots Pine}around 
 Â£30/cubic metre.
