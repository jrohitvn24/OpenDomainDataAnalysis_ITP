		<content> We visited the woodland area and lakes
 around Highams Park.The woodland area 
 ,a part of Epping Forest,is generally 
 quiet with a few people fishing in the
 boating lake.There are many varieties 
 of trees including Beech,Wild Cherry, 
 Willow,Oak,Conifer and some Holly and 
 Hawthorn bushes.On the lake there     
 coots,moorhens,ducks and swans.The    
 birds that the class saw in the area  
 were blackbirds,thrushes,sparrows,    
 robins,pigeons and black headed gulls.
 Wild flowers were everywhere these    
 included,Fever Few,Skull Cap,Wood     
 Caliment,Lesser Cats Tail,Buttercup,  
 Cow Parsley.Poppies,Golden Rod,Silver 
 Fir and Meadow Barley.Most of the veg-
 etation is uncultivated.              
  Epping Forest originally belonged to 
 the crown,it was a from Queen Victoria
 to the people of London.The river     
 Ching flows to Highams Park Lake.     </content>
