		<title>06WETHERBY FIRE SERVICE</title>
		<content>  Wetherby Fire Service consists of one
 appliance, operated by 28 men, all    
 full time, 4 on duty on each shift.   
 It covers an area of about 100 square 
 miles, and attends approximately 250  
 call-outs per year, ranging from the  
 ordinary fire calls to the special    
 service calls. At Wetherby they have  
 special cutting gear and chemical     
 protection suits for accidents on the 
 nearby A1.                            
  The{Thermal Image Scope}and the      
{computer call-out system}are seen as  
 future technological developments.    
 Otherwise they don't think that the   
 fire service will change, except for  
 the way that products are constructed.
 They think that new materials such as 
 foam rubber and fibre-optics will     
 hopefully be used more often by the   
 manufacturers.
