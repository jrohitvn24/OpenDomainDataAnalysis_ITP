		<content>     The Rector used to be responsible 
 for four separate parishes of which   
 only one, CASTLE CARROCK, lies in the 
 study area.                           
                                       
     For the last decade these have    
 been merged into a United Benefice    
 with the incumbent serving a scattered
 community of approx. 15OO.   The      
 Rector lives in the Rectory in Castle 
 Carrock.   Communion is celebrated by 
 the Rector twice a month, while Matins
 is sung on the alternate Sunday, led  
 by a local Licensed Reader.           
                                       
     The village of TALKIN also has its
 own Church and forms part of the      
 Parish of Hayton and Talkin.          
                                       
     The several Chapels have now all  
 disappeared, often being converted    
 to private houses.                    </content>
