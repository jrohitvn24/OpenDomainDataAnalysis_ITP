		<title>13VIETNAMESE BOAT PEOPLE</title>
		<content> In April 1980, ten Vietnamese families
 moved into accommodation on the Sutton
 Trust estate in Padgate.Each family   
 was befriended by an English family   
 who helped to prepare and furnish the 
 house before the families moved from  
 resettlement centres in the south of  
 England.The children were taught      
 English by a teacher specialising in  
 English as a second language, and the 
 adults were offered language tuition  
 at night school by the same           
 teacher,though few of the women       
 attended these classes.In 1982 the    
 first family moved to live with       
 friends in Birmingham, closely        
 followed by a second.In 1985, 3 more  
 families moved to live with the       
 Chinese communities in London.Of the 5
 families left in Padgate, 4 of them   
 are trying to exchange their houses   
 for homes in London.                  </content>
