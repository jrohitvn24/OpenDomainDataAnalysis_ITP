		<title>04CARLESS OIL REFINERY</title>
		<content> The{refinery}is an important piece of 
{industry}in the area, and a large     
 number of local people are employed   
 there.                                
  As well as dealing with certain      
 aspects of the oil industry, it was   
 explained to us that a whole range of 
 chemicals and additives are produced  
 at the site.We were surprised to find 
 that the company has its own Private  
{Railway}to move the tanks about.      
  The storage tanks seem to be         
 enormous,especially when we were      
 standing on top of them or crossing   
 over the catwalks.The rules about     
 smoking and the{fire}warning signs    
 were all over the place, and they have
 their own fire house.                 
  The refinery deals with all{European 
{countries}and belongs to a large      
 company which has many other similar  
 places around the world.              </content>
