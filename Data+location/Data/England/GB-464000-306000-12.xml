		<title>12Beeby Self Pick Farm</title>
		<content> Beeby Self Pick Farm is one of a      
 new-breed of fruit and vegetable farms
 where the general public pick their   
 own produce and pay on the basis of   
 weight. This cuts down overheads for  
 the farmer and gives people the       
 pleasure of a day in the country. The 
 cost of the fruit and vegetables is   
 less than similar produce in the shops
 or on the market. 1lb of strawberries,
 for example, costs about 25 pence. To 
 buy these in the shops would easily   
 cost twice or three times this amount.
 The range of produce available at     
 Beeby is very wide. Rhubarb,          
 gooseberries, strawberries,           
 raspberries, worcesterberries,        
 boysenberries, whiteberries, cabbage, 
 peas, broccoli, new potatoes, brussel 
 sprouts and onions are available,     
 amongst other things.
