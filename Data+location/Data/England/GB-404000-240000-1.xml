		<content>   Our area of study for the Domesday  
 Survey has proved interesting because 
 of its variety. Most of it consists of
 market gardening land,glass houses and
 polythene tunnels,together with       
 evidence of locally grown produce seen
 in the form of stalls lining the A44  
 Broadway-Evesham road.                
  One square is made up of the newer   
 residential area of Evesham, with     
 the new Presto Supermarket, The High  
 School, Simon de Montfort Middle      
 School and The Vale Special School.   
   We looked at the complete village of
 Wickhamford,with its Church and       
 Manor.The various activities available
 in the village have proved interesting
 as has the work of the National Canine
 Defence League Kennels.               
  Our survey also covered the southern 
 part of Badsey, fortunately including 
 our school,{Badsey First School.}     </content>
