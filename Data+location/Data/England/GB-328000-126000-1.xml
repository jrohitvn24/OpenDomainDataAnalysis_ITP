		<title>01A GENERAL SUMMARY</title>
		<content>  Our block is a very rural area.It    
 contains only three small areas of    
 housing _ the villages of Durston,    
 Charlton and West Lyng.There is a     
 mixture of dairy farming,cereal,      
 vegetable and fruit growing.          
  One kilometre of the M5 crosses      
 the very edge of the block.There are  
 six roads in the block, one well_used 
 "A"road and five minor country lanes. 
  Running through the area is the River
 Tone, the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal
 and a mainline railway track.         
  The section  on the edge of Sedgemoor
 is very flat and the whole area gently
 undulates.                            
  In this quiet,largely unspoilt piece 
 of Somerset,the people seem to have   
 the best of both worlds:the peace and 
 tranquility of the village,while being
 only four kilometres from Taunton,the 
 busy county town of Somerset.         </content>
