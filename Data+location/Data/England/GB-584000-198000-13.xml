		<content> My dad races cars called Hot rods.    
 Nearly every weekend we go racing. On 
 the 6th of July he is in the world    
 final and he will be on television.I  
 won't be there as I am a brides maid  
 for my 2nd cousin. My hobby is riding 
 ponies. At the moment  I am lucky to  
 have three of my own ponies. I go in  
 for shows on them once in a while. My 
 mum rides but she does not go in for  
 anything. I also go to karate. I am a 
 white belt at the moment but in a     
 couple of months time I will be a blue
 belt. My brother goes to karate, he is
 also a white belt. My brother has Go  
 Carts they have engines in them.He has
 races in them round the field.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
