		<title>18THE RED ARROWS</title>
		<content>  From 1965 to 1983, {The Red Arrows}  
 were based at {R.A.F.Kemble.}They are 
 famous all over the world for their   
 stunts and aerobatics. In 1983 they   
 were transferred to Lincolnshire and  
 all the people in Kemble were sad to  
 see them go. We never got any peace   
 when they were practising but we      
 enjoyed seeing them.  When they first 
 came to Kemble, they flew Gnats but   
 now they fly Hawks.                   
  When{The Red Arrows}left, we gave    
 them two books of drawings and poems  
 by the children and they gave us a    
 signed poster. They gave us a special 
 fly past over the school and it was   
 televised by the BBC and ITV.
