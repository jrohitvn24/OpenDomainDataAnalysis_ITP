		<title>10Whitehall Fruit Farm, Gatton</title>
		<content>     There are twelve people working on
 Whitehall Fruit Farm. The{vehicles    
 they use include strawberry planters  
 and combine harvesters. For the rats  
 in the fields they use rat poison. In 
 the farm they use cats like in normal 
 houses for the mice. To keep the birds
 away they use scatterguns. The trouble
 is as soon as the noise dies away the 
 birds come back again! They water the 
 plants every few days for about an    
 hour,to make sure the water soaks     
 in.                                   
     The people who farm don't choose  
 their{employment,}it's a sort of      
 family job. There are no particular   
 times of work in farming, but they    
 work more in the summer. Most of the  
 fruit they grow goes to the shops. The
 bad fruit they have to throw away. The
 land is chalky. The most popular fruit
 is strawberries.                      </content>
