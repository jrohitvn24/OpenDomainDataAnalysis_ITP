		<title>16PLUCKLEY GHOSTS 5</title>
		<content>{THE SCHOOLMASTER} did not work in     
 Pluckley, but is thought to have      
 committed suicide about 1920. A small 
 group of children found his body      
 hanging from a tree in Dicky Buss     
 Lane. They watched silently as his    
 body was carried away and he haunts   
 that same lane today.                 
{THE HIGHWAYMAN}has been dead for many 
 years, but the clash of swords that   
 brought his life to an end can still  
 be heard at times at the fatal scene. 
 So too can the agonising scream which 
 he gave as the sword pinned him to the
 tree trunk. His dark shadowy outline  
 can be seen close to where the tree   
 once stood. (Although the identity of 
 this ghost is not known, one of the   
 Dering family met a similar fate and  
 it is likely this is his ghost).
