		<title>11Education In Our Area</title>
		<content>   Education is a large subject all    
over our 12 squares.Weston Turville    
School itself has over 200 pupils and  
is still growing.In 1983 it had 6      
classes,one year later it had 7.The    
school times are currently being       
changed from 9-3.45 to 9-3.30 .The     
playgroup in the village hall operates 
every morning and in the evening       
there is ballet and short tennis.      
   In Bedgrove there are two schools   
providing education to one of the      
largest housing estates in Britain.Both
schools(both having over 250 pupils)   
start at 9 but the first school ends at
3.15pm and the middle at 3.30pm.There  
are 2 playgroups,1 at the pavilion,and 
1 at the church.Soon there will be a   
nursery school at the First School     
which will give young children the     
chance to work in a primary school.
