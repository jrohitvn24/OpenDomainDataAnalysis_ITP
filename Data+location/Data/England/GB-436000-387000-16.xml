 COME TRY THE DON-BAIT FOR FISHERMEN   
   The dirty{Don}could soon be a       
 perfect spot for Sheffield{anglers.}A 
 report carried out by Sheffield       
 Council has revealed that the River   
 Don is becoming more fishable because 
 perch, roach and trout are apearing in
 the river. In ten or twenty years we  
 might be able to have some salmon back
 into the river

     KESTRELS NESTING IN DARNALL       
   {Kestrels}have been nesting in      
 Darnall. Three fledging have been     
 reared by their parents and have now  
 left the nest. This is the first      
 report we have heard of them setting  
 up home here.                         </content>
