Examples of these institutions are the 
Horticultural Society,the playgroup,the
women's institute and the church       
council.The Nor'lye news also contains 
the Vicar's letter and information     
about  forthcoming events in the area, 
as well as many other things.North     
Leigh is a mixture of old and new      
houses.In North Leigh there is a hall  
called the Memorial hall.Its where     
meetings and discos take place.        
Attached to the hall is North Leigh    
library.Also in North Leigh there are  
3 churches and a garden centre. I like 
North Leigh because its in the         
country however I have not got many    
friends there.
