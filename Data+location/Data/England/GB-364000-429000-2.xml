		<content>    The farmers enjoy attending the    
 auction markets at Gisburn,           
 Clitheroe, Preston and Lancaster.     
  The farmers and the general public   
 live alongside each other quite well, 
 but problems do occur with broken     
 fencing and walls,litter,dogs worrying
 farm animals and poaching.            
  The farmers' main difficulties in    
 1985 have been a very wet summer and  
 their quota of milk allowed by the    
 E.E.C. being decreased.               
  Farming is an important area of life 
 around Mellor. Soon it is our Harvest 
 Festival in church when the farmers,  
 villagers,school children and clergy  
 all join together in a thanksgiving   
 service.
