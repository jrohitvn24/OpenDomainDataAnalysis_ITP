Hundon is an ancient village pre-dating
the Norman Conquest. It  is mentioned  
in the original Domesday Book. The     
name may have come from "Hunasdene",   
Huna's Valley or the Valley of the     
Huna.It suggests that the occupants of 
the valley were fierce, warlike people 
from across the North Sea. They were   
possibly descended from an ancient     
Asiatic nomad race who invaded Europe  
in4th  and 5th Century.                
  There have been significant social   
changes in the life of the inhabitants 
of the village which are reflected in  
the change of commercial  use of the   
buildings.                             
e.g. circal 1885 Hundon had 10 public  
houses and 6 shops today 2 public      
houses and 2 shops
