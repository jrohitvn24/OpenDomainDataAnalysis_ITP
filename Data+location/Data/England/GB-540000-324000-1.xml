		<title>01LUTTON AND THE GEDNEYS</title>
		<content> This part of the {Lincolnshire Fens}is
 one of the most intensely {cultivated}
 parts of England. The landscape is{   
{typically}flat with only minor        
 undulations in the field surfaces to  
 break the  monotony.Huge skies and    
 panoramic views are the norm.Villages 
 are scattered with small nucleated    
 settlements around village churches or
 farming centres. Farms fall into no{  
{particular category},varying from     
 large multi company co-operatives,    
 through to small family concerns      
 working a few acres. The main village 
 centres are at {Lutton and Gedney,both
{}are clustered around churches of     
 varying architectural note,Gedney     
 Dyke has no such feature, and probably
 has its origins as an agricultural    
 centre,although much modern building  
 has changed the nature of the village.
