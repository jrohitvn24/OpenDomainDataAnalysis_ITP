		<title>20BROADBRIDGE HEATH RESIDENT</title>
		<content>   A resident was interviewed about the
 Broadbridge Heath area.He has lived   
 there for 8 years and has 3 children. 
   The changes he notices most are the 
 new developments especially the       
 housing.Although so many houses have  
 been built,the facilities in the      
 village have not improved.Most needed 
 are a chemist,a doctor and a dentist  
 nearer than those in  Horsham.        
   The road through Broadbridge Heath  
 is quieter now the by-pass is there   
 but some people,in order to avoid     
 traffic,make a detour,driving too fast
 through the village.                  
   On the whole,the atmosphere is not  
 like a true English village, or a town
 but is mid-way between the two.       
                                       
 The survey was carried out by the     
{Third Form girls of Farlington School,
 an independent school at Strood Park. </content>
