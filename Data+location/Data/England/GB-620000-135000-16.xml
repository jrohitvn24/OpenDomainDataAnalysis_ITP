		<title>16 DAILY LIFE: AN 11 YEAR OLD</title>
		<content>   On most mornings I am woken up by my
dad at around 7 o'clock. I then get    
dressed and have breakfast which is    
already on the table. I am taken to    
school by my mum in her car. When I    
arrive at school it is about half past 
eight.                                 
   School starts at 8.55. The morning  
lessons usually consist of Maths and   
English, with a fifteen minute break   
in the middle.                         
   Lunch is from 12.00 until 1.10.     
There are three sittings. The lessons  
in the afternoon are of a more prac-   
tical nature. School ends at 3.15.     
   I usually arrive home at four       
o'clock. I then have my tea and go off 
to a club. When I return home I have a 
wash and get ready for bed. I then go  
downstairs and watch the television    
until about nine o'clock, when I go to 
bed.                                   </content>
