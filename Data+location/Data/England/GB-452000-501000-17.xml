		<content> Thwaites Plantation is a 6 Hectare    
 area of 24 yr old Scots Pine &amp;        
 Lodgepole Pine trees. It is a Forestry
 Commission thicket stage plantation   
 much used as a latrine by those       
 following the Lyke Wake Walk - for    
 which purpose stiles have now been    
 erected. The fences that are at the   
 roadside suffer occasional damage from
 vehicles. Part of this block is to be 
 sold to the N Yorks Moors National    
 Park Cttee. for development as a car  
 park. On Cringle Moor there is a 12.5 
 Hectare plantation of Scots Pine,     
 Lodgepole Pine &amp; Sitka Spruce. The    
 first two have suffered predation by  
 sheep so the Sitka has a stock fence. 
 A recently opened footpath cuts       
 through the Sitka at the S end. Where 
 the trees have not blocked out all    
 light, rank bracken takes over. The   
 area is generally impenetrable.       </content>
