		<content> On the north side of the river there  
 are no churches in this area.There is 
 a small village{chapel}at Rodley but  
 few people attend.Nearest churches are
 at Westbury on Severn and Newnham     
 where attendances are also very       
 small.On the south side church-goers  
 also have to go outside this area to  
 Arlingham where there is a{Parish     
{Church}.The average congregation      
 according to local residents is about 
 20 but for a Christening it may rise  
 to 70-80.There is a{Free Church       
{(Non-Conformist)}also at Arlingham    
 which is lucky to get a 'handful' in  
 its congregation.Residents believe the
 area has become apathetic concerning  
 religion.
