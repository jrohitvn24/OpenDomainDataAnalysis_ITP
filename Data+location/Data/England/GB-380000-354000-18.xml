		<content> There were 112 juniors in our school  
 on the day of our survey. We asked    
 everybody two questions. The first one
 was "Which activity do you like       
 best?" and the second was "Which      
 activity do you spend most time       
 doing?" The most popular activities   
 were sport and watching television.   
 The most unpopular activities were    
 gardening and jobs.
