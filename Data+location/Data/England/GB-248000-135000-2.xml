		<title>02Braunton Great Field.</title>
		<content> Braunton great fields are situated    
 between Braunton and Saunton.The Great
 field is{only one of three}left in    
 Britain.In{1905,}there used to be     
 sixty farmers, but now{(1985)},there  
 are only five.The Great fields take up
 about 350 acres to the south-west of  
 the village.It is an archaeological   
 site because,it has been farmed since 
 mediaeval times when all the fields   
 were in strips seperated by{balks     
{(banks of grass between strips).}Now, 
 with modern machinery,the strips are  
 too narrow,so the farmers are taking  
 the balk away, and making larger      
 fields.The great fields would be      
 ruined,so archaeologists hope it will 
 stay in it's present form,a mixture of
 strips and larger fields.
