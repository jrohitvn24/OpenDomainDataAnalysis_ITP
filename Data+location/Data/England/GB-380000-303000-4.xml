		<content> In the school yard we play many games.
 The most popular is Tig.This is played
 like a normal game, but we have to run
 from one circle to the other.We play  
 marbles at school.                    
 We swap them with other people and    
 also we try to hit another marble     
 when it is stationary.The boys play   
 football,and the girls often bring a  
 skipping rope and we experimentto find
 different ways of jumping in and      
 outwhen the rope is being turned, with
 out stopping it.We also play a game   
 called Red Rover.Both boys and girls  
 play it.What we do is have two teams, 
 each team stands in a line and holds  
 hands.One team, asks a member of the  
 other team to try and break threw the 
 line.We have different crazes at      
 different times.
