		<title>18The Future</title>
		<content> Our group's topic was the future of   
 Seaton Delaval. First we prepared some
 questions which we used in{interviews}
 with passers-by at the Avenue Head.   
 Two of our parents took us up and we  
 asked our questions and recorded the  
 answers on two tape recorders. We     
 asked about energy of the future,     
 houses, facilities and so on. The most
 popular hope was for the extension of 
 the{Tyneside Metro}to Seaton Delaval. 
 The Metro is a system using electric  
 trams and part of it goes under the   
 city of Newcastle. Some people hoped  
 for a large shopping area such as     
 Eldon Square in Newcastle, but we     
 thought if the Metro was extended here
 we wouldn't need a large shopping area
 with its traffic jams etc. We hope    
 Seaton Delaval will stay a{friendly}  
 place to live in as it is now!
