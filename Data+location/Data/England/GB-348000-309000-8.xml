		<title>08BIRD LIFE</title>
		<content> Our survey shows that the usual house 
 sparrow, blackbird, robin, thrush and 
 tits are the most often seen birds.   
 Other birds observed regularly are    
 dove, starling, wren, chaffinch, crow,
 greenfinch, and pigeon.{14%}of people 
 mentioned the magpie, now a serious   
 suburban resident, visit their garden.
 Summer visitors are the house martin  
 nesting at{Coleham School}and spotted 
 flycatcher. Heron are seen high over  
 head flying westwards in the morning  
 and returning in the evening to their 
 heronry at{Longnor Hall, Atcham.      
 An unusual sight in the winter is     
 seeing the large{Meole Brace}traffic  
 island populated with lapwing. One    
 theory in the local press is that the 
 pounding of traffic bring earth-      
 worms to the surface and thus there is
 a steady supply of food. However,     
 other theories have been suggested.   </content>
