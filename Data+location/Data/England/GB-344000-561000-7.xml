		<title>07Barclose Garage, Scaleby</title>
		<content> What used to be Barclose Petrol       
 Station is now an agricultural garage.
 They repair cars and carry out M.O.T. 
 tests also. The garage is owned by the
 son of Mrs. Kate Little of Barclose.  
 She has lived 45 years in her present 
 house and 59 years in Scaleby.        
 Before the garage existed, Mrs.       
 Little's husband was the blacksmith.  
 He shoed horses for the people of     
 Scaleby.                              
 For 30 years Mrs. Little's father had 
 no tractor on his farm but horses to  
 do the work. Now there is a lot       
 more machinery used on farms. Cars    
 only gradually came to the village.   
 There were 5 by 1926.
