		<title>02Riccall Mine.</title>
		<content>   At{Riccall}mine there are 400 people
 (mineworkers). The pit was opened 3rd 
 of October 1983.                      
   The shaft is 850m deep. It has a lot
 of facilities eg.showers,a canteen and
 lockers for workers' clothes.There are
 2 cages down to the bottom. Each cage 
 holds 150 men at a time.              
   Coal does not come out here,it      
 travels by conveyer belt under ground 
 from there to{Gascoine Wood}Mine.     
   From there it goes to the power     
 station by rail to supply             
 electricity.                          
   The coal seams are very thick and   
 the mine should be productive for many
 years.                                
   There are three shifts: nights,     
 afternoons and days.                  
   Riccall mine is part of the new     
{Selby Coal Field.}
