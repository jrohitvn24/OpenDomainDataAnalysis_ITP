		<title>06A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ....</title>
		<content> "Friday. I wake up at about 07.00 hrs.
 After I have had a wash I get ready   
 for school. For breakfast I have      
 cornflakes and toast.                 
 I leave my house at 07.50hrs and      
 walk to the bus stop to wait for the  
 bus which arrives at about 08.10hrs.  
 When I arrive at school I wait at the 
 classroom door for the bell to go.    
 After that my teacher calls the       
 register. Then we line up for         
 Assembly. Afterwards I go to my first 
 lesson which is 'Home and Family      
 Studies', where we do cooking or      
 writing. After that lesson it is      
 break, followed by Science. We work   
 from books called "Measurement". After
 dinner I have spellings followed by   
 reading. Then it is Drama and Music.  
 I like Drama best because you can act.
 At 15.35 hrs. I catch a bus home.     
 After tea I play or do my homework."  </content>
