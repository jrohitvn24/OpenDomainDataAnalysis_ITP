		<content> The Women's Institute has grown over  
 the last twenty years in the Lymm     
 area.  According to one of its members
 who is a past president of the local  
 organisation.  She said the Woman's   
 Institute does a lot of work for      
 charity in the area and as well as    
 helping by visiting pensioners they   
 raise money from jumble sales.  They  
 also have meetings where people give  
 talks and demonstrations on subjects  
 like flower arranging or travel.  They
 also arrange trips and days out for   
 their members.  Twenty years ago there
 was one branch of the Women's         
 Institute in the area, now there are  
 three.
