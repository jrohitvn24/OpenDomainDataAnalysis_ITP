		<title>12Home Life In South Kyme-1</title>
		<content> South Kyme still sticks to its' rural 
 roots. Not all inhabitants are        
 involved directly with agriculture, as
 was once the case. A Lot of people    
 from other areas have moved here and  
 this has changed the fabric of the    
 village. Many residents grow their own
 vegetables, and the traditional meat  
 and two veg. is the normal everyday   
 fare, though more adventurous food,   
 and also convenience foods have put in
 an appearance.                        
 Breakfast is mainly cereals and toast,
 rather than the traditional bacon and 
 eggs. Potatoes form an important part 
 of the diet. Freezers are popular and 
 a lot of home grown fruit and veg. is 
 frozen. In the shooting season game is
 eaten or frozen. Mealtimes are usually
 early, with lunch at 11am. for the    
 workers. There is much more awareness 
 of wholefoods and avoiding additives. </content>
