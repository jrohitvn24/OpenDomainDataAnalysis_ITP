		<title>08PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> In our playground we play lots of     
 games.Here are some chasing games,    
 Bulldog, Tig and Turkey Lurkey. To    
 play turkey lurkey you need 3 or more 
 people and a post. One person is on,  
 and whilst they count the other people
 run and hide. The one on finds the    
 other players and when they're found  
 they run to the post and say "Turkey  
 Lurkey seen" then say their name. We  
 play lots of skipping games. Ball     
 games are also popular such as        
 football, catch, get the ball and     
 Queenie Queenie, Piggy in the Middle  
 and Hot Rice. To play this game you   
 just have to dodge the ball. If it    
 hits you under the knee you are       
 out.Another game played is marbles,   
 you have a marble and try to hit      
 someone elses with yours or you try to
 hit a target on a drain grate.
