		<title>08SOUTH MOOR MODERNAIRES</title>
		<content> The band was formed 11 years ago and  
 after many local successes came 2nd in
 the U.K. Championships in 1985 and    
 qualified for the World Championships 
 in August.There are about 45 members, 
 mostly girls from 5-18,who attend     
 practices twice a week on South Moor  
 Park fields.Uniforms are provided,    
 except for sandshoes.Most of the      
 children have many medals for entering
 various competitions.                 
 Travel to events is by bus,sleeping or
 eating as we go,sometimes singing when
 we are nervous.On arrival we stand to 
 attention,the drum-major blows her    
 whistle and we're off.When everyone   
 finishes their displays we wait for   
 the results.The bands not mentioned   
 are disappointed,but if our name is   
 called we jump for joy.I play the     
 kazoo,which sounds like a comb and    
 tissue paper.                         </content>
