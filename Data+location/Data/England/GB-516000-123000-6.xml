		<title>06A day at Shuckers Farm</title>
		<content> Every morning my dad gets up at six   
 thirty.He then goes outside to feed   
 the{cows}and the{sheep.}Then it is    
 time for him to go to work, so he has 
 his breakfast then goes.Then my mum   
 comes out and feeds the{goats}and the 
{chickens}and our{donkey.}It is then   
 time for us to have our breakfast.    
 After breakfast my mum picks the      
{vegetables}or tidies the house.When   
 my dad gets back from work  he        
 sometimes puts fetilizer on the field.
 After that it is time to feed the     
 animals again.After that my dad       
 sometimes makes hay in the summer.We  
 have got hundred acres of land which  
 is grass land.In the morning my dad   
 takes some cattle which go to         
{Guildford.}In the spring it is our    
 busiest time because we have lambing. 
 When the lambs are bigger we sell     
 them.                                 </content>
