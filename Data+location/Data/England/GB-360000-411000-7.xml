		<title>07BLACKROD VILLAGE (SCHOOLS)</title>
		<content>    There are three primary schools:   
 Scot Lane C.E. School, opened in 1870,
 Blackrod County Primary, opened in    
 1969 and housed in the building       
 formerly occupied by the secondary    
 modern school, and Blackrod Anglican  
 Methodist Church School, opened in    
 1980. This last school replaced the   
 old Parish School of 1845 which is now
 St.Katharine's Parish Hall.           
    On completing their primary        
 schooling, the majority of children   
 transfer to Rivington &amp; Blackrod High 
 School, an 11 to 18 comprehensive     
 school.                               
    The former Blackrod Grammar School 
 in Church Street, built in 1799, was  
 incorporated with the Free Grammar    
 School at Rivington in 1881 and the   
 building is now used as the local     
 council office.
