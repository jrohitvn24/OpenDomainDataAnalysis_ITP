		<content>  On the top heather predominates over 
 bracken and grass and there are large 
 patches of bare granite due to fires  
 in the 1930s.These fires also revealed
 extensive Bronge Age settlement.      
 Gannet's Combe,however,a wide and     
 shallow valley to the east, has deep  
 marshy vegetation.                    
 At the N.W.point is Lundy North Light.
 The remains of a tramway and winch can
 be seen which used to raise supplies  
 when the lighthouse was manned-and a  
 steep flight of steps winds its way,  
 past Kittiwake Gully,to the sea below.
 Off-shore are the treacherous rocks   
 The Hen and Chickens,through which    
 the tide-race roars.                  
 Telegraph posts once carried the link 
 to the south of the island but these  
 were used recently to fuel a beacon.  
  The exposed west coast is            
 particularly rugged and bare.         </content>
