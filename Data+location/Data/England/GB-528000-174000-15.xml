I am an atheist, I don't believe that  
Jesus ever lived and I think that Jesus
was just a story that people told and  
thought it was true.  So people began  
to worship Jesus and to say that he was
the son of god, but I don't pray to him
unless I am at school and we have to   
pray.  My nanny was a Christian and    
christened my mother but as my mother  
grew older she did not believe in god  
and Jesus, but my aunty believes in god
and is a christian.  My nanny does not 
believe in god any more either.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
