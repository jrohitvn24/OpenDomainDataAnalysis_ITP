		<content> Popular annual events held in the     
 village each year include{The Coverack
{Regatta, Lifeboat Day and Carnival    
{Day.}The{regatta}is centred on the    
 harbour and includes such events as   
 boat races, swimming and diving, for  
 each of which trophies or prizes are  
 awarded. Crews and teams from other   
 villages compete in the events,       
 together with local people and        
 holidaymakers.                        
{Lifeboat Day}generates a great deal of
 support, when funds are raised for the
 Royal National Lifeboat Institution; a
 charity close to the peoples' hearts, 
 although Coverack's own lifeboat has  
 been taken from the village.          
 Much planning and preparation of      
 decorated floats takes place for      
{Carnival Day.}The Carnival Queen is   
 crowned and a procession of floats    
 parade through the village            </content>
