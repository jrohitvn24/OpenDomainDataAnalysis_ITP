		<title>13RIVER CHURN, CIRENCESTER.</title>
		<content>                                       
  The River Churn is a tributary of    
 the Thames, it flows north to south   
 through our block. The river is about 
 4 metres wide and 40 cms deep. In our 
 block it is meandering through it's   
 small flood plain. The river is fast  
 flowing and very clear with a stony   
 bottom. There is much private fishing 
 for trout. Due to the unusually wet   
 June weather it is swollen.           
  There are two bridging points at     
 Perrott's Brook and Baunton. Willow   
 trees and elder bushes line the  banks
 which are covered with cow parsley,   
 rose bay, willow herb, nettles and    
 woody nightshade. At the sides grow   
 yellow flag and reeds.                
  Throughout our block the river forms 
 a fairly steep sided valley, all      
 surrounding fields are used for       
 grazing.                              </content>
