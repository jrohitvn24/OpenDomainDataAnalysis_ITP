		<title>16MY LEISURE TIME. by Kate.</title>
		<content> I have lots to do in my spare time.On 
 Sunday morning I go to Sunday School  
 at the local United Reformed Chapel.  
 Guides is held at the Youth Centre on 
 a Monday night from 7pm.to 9pm.At the 
 moment a group of us are working for  
 our Entertainer's Badge.We are        
 producing our own play and dance.On   
 Tuesday evening I always go to the    
 Library in Boot Hill.When I am there I
 look at books about hobbies and       
 interests.Sometimes I bring some books
 home to read.Usually I read about five
 books a month.I always look forward to
 Thursday when I go to Youth Club.I    
 enjoy playing pool and table tennis   
 and I always watch "East Enders"-a    
 soap opera-on the television while I  
 am there.I am very fond of reading and
 I like to crochet and knit.When the   
 weather is good I play on the         
 recreation ground with my friends.    </content>
