		<title>18Coal Lorries to Thorpe Marsh</title>
		<content>  During the miners strike,big coal    
 lorries transported coal to{Thorpe    
{Marsh Power Station,}because railway  
 workers were in support of the miners.
 Now lorries are used as well as trains
 to deliver coal to the station.The    
 villagers of{Barnby Dun}are annoyed at
 the lorries damaging the roads of the 
 village.Many of the lorries pass also 
 through{Arksey}and{Bentley}damaging   
 the roads there.{South Yorkshire      
{County Council}want to build a depot  
 next to the canal so the roads would  
 be less busy,but the villagers of{    
{Barnby Dun}oppose the idea.During a   
 half-hour period thirteen coal lorries
 went past us to{Thorpe Marsh.}After   
 eleven o'clock in a thirty-five minute
 period we saw twenty-seven lorries of 
 different kinds.Bumps and pot-holes   
 occur in the roads after some lorries 
 have gone over them five or six times.</content>
