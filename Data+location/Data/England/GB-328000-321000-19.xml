		<content>     We collected all our information  
 on a single day, Wednesday July 3rd.  
 Despite the fact that the Summer has  
 been generally wet, we were lucky to  
 choose a beautiful day for our visit  
 to our area.  We set out at half past 
 nine and separated out into our       
 various groups.  We had prepared our  
 questions in advance and were lucky to
 find people ready and willing to help 
 us find out about the area.  We       
 thoroughly enjoyed our day and        
 returned to school soon after three   
 o'clock to begin the task of putting  
 together all our information on to the
 computer.  We found it a very useful  
 and enjoyable experience.
