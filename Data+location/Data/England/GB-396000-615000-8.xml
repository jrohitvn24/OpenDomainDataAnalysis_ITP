		<title>08EROSION IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> There are two main areas which are    
 subject to erosion in the area. The   
 first area is on the hillier parts. On
 the west-side of Brough-law hill there
 are extensive screes beginning at only
 500 feet. On many of the other hills, 
 vegetation is being eroded at an      
 alarming rate. Some of the more       
 popular paths on Brough-law are also  
 showing signs of wear.                
      The other major area of erosion  
 is the river itself. Floods in winter 
 can be severe. Thunderstorms over the 
 hills very occasionally lead to walls 
 of flood-water up to 6 feet high      
 racing down the river. These floods   
 lead to erosion of bank-side and in   
 some parts of this area, lead to the  
 narrow river having a very broad dry  
 bed which leaves a broad scar along   
 some of the valley                    
                                       </content>
