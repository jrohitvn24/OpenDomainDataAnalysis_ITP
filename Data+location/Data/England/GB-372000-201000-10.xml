		<content>      With several farms around the    
 Village, farming is the main          
 occupation although not all of the    
 farms are of the traditional variety -
 one has been given over to growing    
 fruit (mostly strawberries) for the   
 "pick your own" market and another has
 turned some of its fields into a      
 residential and touring caravan site  
 with some space for campers.          
      With the coming of the main A 38 
 Trunk Road the Village Hall and the   
 School disappeared - these facilities 
 are now shared with nearby Slimbridge 
 - and the only leisure activity apart 
 from walking is fishing on the River  
 Cam which runs through the middle of  
 the village (and from which the       
 village derives its name).            
      In spite of several bus services 
 Cambridge is an isolated village and  
 is likely to remain so.               </content>
