		<title>14GREEN ACRES FARM KEMBERTON</title>
		<content>  This farm is owned by Mr Lea. The    
 farm house and buildings are about 15 
 years old. His previous farm house was
 on land purchased by Telford          
 Development Corporation. He has 6     
 fields by the farm, 2 in the village  
 and 3 in another part of the parish.  
 He owns 210 acres, of which 145 are   
 used for grain. There are 5 acres of  
 woodland the rest being grassland for 
 about 70 beef cattle. Cattle are      
 usually bought from Shrewsbury market.
  The boundary hedges to the farm have 
 been retained but the internal hedges 
 were removed about 20 years ago to    
 facilitate mechanised farming.        
 Electric fences are now used.         
 Machinery used to be contracted but   
 now Mr Lea is self-sufficient. He     
 employs a full time worker and a      
 part-time worker.
