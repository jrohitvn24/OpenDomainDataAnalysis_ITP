 The Spar grocers shop is run by Mr.   
 George Airey.  It has been a Spar shop
 for 13 years, although there has been 
 a shop on the site for 80 years. It   
 was formerly a Co-operative store.    
 The Spar is very popular with school  
 children.  Every day 60 to 100        
 children go in to buy sweets etc.     
 Tinned goods are the items with the   
 hightest sales.  The shop is now self 
 service and has a check out.          
 In contrast to other shops in the     
 area, half day closing is on a Tuesday
 afternoon rather than a Thursday.     
 This is done to help customers, as    
 there will always be a store open     
 locally.
