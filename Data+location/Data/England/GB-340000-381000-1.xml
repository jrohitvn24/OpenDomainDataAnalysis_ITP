		<title>01WELCOME TO SPEKE.....</title>
		<content> Speke has come a long way since it was
 first   mentioned   in  the   original
 Domesday Book in 1086.    There it was
 written that Speke was held by Uctred,
 and had  been  since  1066.   In those
 long-off  days  it  was  known  as the
 manor of Speke.     It was part of the
 forestership of Lancashire.           
      Today Speke is in Merseyside.  It
 consists  largely  of  industrial  and
 housing  estates   surrounded  by  the
 civil airfield  to the west and south,
 industrial  develpments  to the north,
 and the  rural aspect  of  Hale to the
 east.                                 
   In stark contrast to the brick-built
 council houses and  factories,  it can
 boast  of  a  great  heritage  in  the
 beautiful,  half-timbered   Speke Hall
 which  has  graced  the area since the
 fifteenth century.
