		<title>08Framlingham, arable farming.</title>
		<content>Most of the grain grown on the heavy   
clay soil around Framlingham is autumn 
sown wheat and barley. After ploughing 
the fields farmers prepare a seedbed   
into which the seed is sown. Plants    
quickly emerge and farmers try to keep 
them free from weeds, harmful insects  
and disease. Crops are harvested in the
summer and put in the farmer's grain   
store.After processing,the grain is    
used for feeding people and livestock. 
Some seed is retained for the next     
year's crop. Some grain grown locally  
is shipped to other countries for use. 
Many people in and around Framlingham  
work on farms or in businesses         
supplying farmers' needs. Some firms   
supply or service farm machinery,      
others buy or sell the corn or process 
it into animal food. Other crops grown 
in this area include oil-seed rape,    
field-beans and peas.                  </content>
