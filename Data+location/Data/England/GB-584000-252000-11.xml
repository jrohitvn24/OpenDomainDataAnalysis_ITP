		<title>11The Agricultural Institute</title>
		<content>Chadacre Hall and estate were purchased
in 1918 by the First Earl of Iveagh,who
set up a trust fund to establish and   
endow an Institute for agricultural    
education and training.The Hall was    
modified and now provides a dininghall 
library,lecture room,chapel,recreation 
rooms,sports hall and group study bed- 
rooms as well as kitchens,offices and  
accomodation for resident staff.Since  
its first opening as Chadacre Agricult-
ural Institute in 1921 a course in gen-
eral agriculture has been offered,cov- 
ering 2 winters'residence with the in- 
tervening summer being spent on farms. 
It was originally intended to provide  
free training for sons of farmers and  
farm workers from Suffolk and adjoining
counties,but under modern conditions   
fees have to be charged(although most  
students obtain generous grants) and   
now accept students from overseas too. </content>
