		<title>13HOME LIFE IN PANTON</title>
		<content>{PANTON }households tend to be fairly  
 self-sufficient because of their rural
 setting. Most grow their own produce  
 and shopping is done on a weekly or   
 fortnightly basis  in either Lincoln  
 or Louth. Many visitors from outside  
 the area consider the houses very     
 isolated but none of the residents    
 would consider themselves lonely.     
 There are frequent visits from neigh- 
 bours and other friends and it is the 
 norm for such visitors to stop for a  
 cup of tea. Children are not able to  
 "drop in" on each other but will tend 
 to stay for the day or evening having 
 been brought by their parents in the  
 car. There is a splendid feeling of   
 time and space in {PANTON }which in   
 modern living is a luxury. There is   
 time to talk and to listen.
