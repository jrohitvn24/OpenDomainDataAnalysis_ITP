		<title>02Landscape of Beeley Moor</title>
		<content> This is a flat upland area with two   
 exposed millstone grit edges from     
 which two main valleys lead off, one  
 in an easterly direction and the other
 westwards. The predominant feature is 
 grouse moor and in places peat bogs   
 exist. The moorland is interspersed   
 with rough pasture for sheep grazing  
 whilst lay pasture provides fodder for
 cattle. Dry-stone walls intersect the 
 area giving a bleak appearance to the 
 landscape. On the exposed moorland and
 down the gentle sided valleys are a   
 number of coniferous plantations.     
 There are a few small coppices of     
 deciduous trees. The moorland is the  
 source of two streams: the River      
 Hipper flowing east and Beeley Brook  
 flowing west resulting in waterfalls  
 en route to lower ground. It is a     
 sparsely populated area. The farms are
 built of local gritstone.             </content>
