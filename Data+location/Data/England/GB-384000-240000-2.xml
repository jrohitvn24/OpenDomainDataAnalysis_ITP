		<title>02Upton River Activities.</title>
		<content> Upton's stretch of the{river Severn}is
 both powerful and unpredictable, not  
 always apparent to visitors. Swimming 
 is dangerous and not permitted. The   
 town quayside is always busy with both
 private and hired narrow boats        
 alongside. Many visitors then visit   
 the shops, pubs and restaurants in the
 town. The{"Conway Castle"}steamer     
 takes visitors up and down the river, 
 wines and dines them en route,daytime 
 and at night.At East  waterside is a  
 busy{Marina,}with first class         
 facilities for berth holders and      
 visitors, including hire boats, boat  
 sales, moorings, slipway, chandlery,  
 boat hoist and fuel.Upton has its own 
 angling club and the local tackle     
 shop, in Old Street,will issue        
 licences.
