		<title>02ATTITUDES IN CURDWORTH</title>
		<content> GENERALLY, PEOPLES ATTITUDES TOWARDS  
 LIVING IN CURDWORTH ARE FAVOURABLE    
 SOME OLDER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY   
 REMEMBER WITH SADNESS THE TIME WHEN IT
 WAS A SMALL COUNTRY VILLAGE WITH      
 COTTAGES AND FARMHOUSES PLUS A SMALL  
 NUMBER OF WATER BOARD DWELLINGS,      
 SURROUNDED BY FIELDS AND TREE LINED   
 LANES HOWEVER DESPITE CHANGES THAT    
 HAVE TAKEN PLACE, WITH THE DEMOLITION 
 OF MANY OLDER PROPERTIES AND THE      
 BUILDING OF NEW ESTATES, PEOPLE ENJOY 
 LIVING IN CURDWORTH AND THE COMMUNITY 
 SPIRIT WITH ITS CARING ATTITUDES,     
 REMAINS FAMILY BEREAVEMENTS HAVE LED  
 TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW FRIENDSHIPS 
 AND THE CEMENTING OF OLD ONES. PEOPLE 
 FEEL THIS IS A PLEASANT PLACE TO LIVE 
 IN BECAUSE OF THE CARING ATTITUDE TO  
 OLDER RESIDENTS AND NEWCOMERS ALIKE.  
 THERE IS A CONCERNED ATTITUDE TO THE  
 ENVIRONMENT.                          </content>
