		<content> The oldest types of building which can
 be seen in Milborne have cob          
 walls,some cottages still have        
 thatched roofs. The rendered walls    
 have been painted to look more        
 attractive. Many of the buildings are 
 constructed of brick and flint, these 
 include the Church and the school.Most
 of the more modern housing is brick_  
 built.Three private estates have been 
 built during the last twenty years,   
 together with several private houses  
 and two terraces of houses, one of    
 which is now owned by the Council.Many
 previous council house tenants have   
 purchased their properties. so that a 
 greater proportion of the houses are  
 now owner_ocupied rather than         
 leased.The latest private             
 development,currently being completed 
 is built next to the school,and       
 consists of ten mock_Georgian houses. </content>
