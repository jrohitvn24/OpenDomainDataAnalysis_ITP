		<title>19COMPUTERS</title>
		<content>  Many people now have computers.The   
 popular computers are Sinclair        
 machines.Over the past few years the  
 price of machines has dropped         
 dramatically.The reason most people   
 in our school have computers are      
 mostly so they can play games.Games   
 are called software.Most people buy   
 games on cassette but games are       
 available on disc or cartridages.
