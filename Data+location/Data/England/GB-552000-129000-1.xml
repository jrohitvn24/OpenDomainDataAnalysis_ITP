		<content>   Crowborough lying in the High Weald 
 800 feet above sea level was part of  
 the ancient parish of Rotherfield     
 until 1905 but with 16970 inhabitants 
 is now the biggest town in Wealden    
 Authority.  It is the only Parish to  
 have a full time Clerk. Twinning links
 with Montargis France have existed    
 since May 1966 and strong ties of     
 friendship were rewarded when winning 
 the Sussex in Europe award in 1982.   
 Rotherfield by acreage is the largest 
 Parish in Wealden but has a population
 of 3090.  It is mainly farmland and   
 forestry land.  Many small farms are  
 amalgamating into larger concerns and 
 boundaries disappearing.  Arable      
 farming predominates.  Limekiln Wood  
 occupies 32 hectares of conifers,     
 grown for fencing, stakes and         
 paper,replacing many great oaks.      
 Rotherfield is a preserved area.      </content>
