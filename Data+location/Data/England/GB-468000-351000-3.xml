		<content>  {Southwell}might have had a          
 connection with the{Romans}because    
 there were rumours that there is a    
 town under{Southwell}called{'Ad       
{Pontem.' Roman coins}have been found  
 on{Southwell Burgage}and in other     
 places around{Southwell.              
   The{Burgage}belongs to{The Burgage  
{Manor. The Burgage Manor}is a large   
 white Georgian Mansion.               
  {Southwell}is mentioned in{The       
{Domesday Book}as{Sudwell}and through  
 the years it has changed to{Southwell.
 When the{Domesday Book}was made The   
 Normans who originally came from      
 France, ruled England. South in French
 is sud, so this could have a          
 connection with why Southwell is      
 called Southwell now.
