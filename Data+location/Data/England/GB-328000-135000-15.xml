		<title>15SKITTLES IN BRIDGWATER</title>
		<content> In Bridgwater all the pubs have       
 skittle alleys.  There are about 120  
 teams in the Bridgwater league.  The  
 game is played in an alley, usually   
 about 9m long.  Each team has six     
 players and eaqch player rolls three  
 balls at the pins or skittles.  There 
 are 9 pins at the end of the alley. If
 some of them are knocked over they are
 called "Deadwood" if they stay on the 
 Metal Diamond.  One person stays at   
 the end of the alley and puts up the  
 pins when they are knocked over.  He  
 is called a "sticker up". My Dad plays
 for the Knowle Inn team and he plays  
 once or twice a week.  He has won so  
 many trophies that it is impossible to
 move in our house.  There are no      
 league games played in the summer.
