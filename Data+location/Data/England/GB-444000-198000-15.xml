		<title>15 ORDNANCE SURVEY ERRORS?</title>
		<content>     ORDNANCE SURVEY maps are greatly  
admired for their accuracy.So it was   
with some surprise that we found any   
ERRORS on our section of the 1:50000   
map.They have many uses and tell us    
much about the LANDSCAPE,but errors    
and omissions do occur, sometimes      
through changes since surveying.       
     In Cothill there is a Nature      
Reserve opened by BBONT(Berks.,Bucks   
and Oxfordshire Naturalist Trust) not  
marked on at 467998.Yet the map        
appears to be up to date in its        
OMISSION of the public house which     
closed two years ago.Also in Cothill   
the public telephone kiosk (T) is not  
marked.                                
     The private school, dating        
back to the 1870's is not marked       
either. In square 4398 the (T) and Inn 
are on the wrong sides of the road.
