		<content> The main occupations of residents in  
 our area are farming and market       
 gardening.  Some residents obviously  
 live in the area as it is convenient  
 for their work.  The minority of      
 residents have jobs in farms or are,  
 perhaps, railway workers in nearby    
 towns and they wanted to live in a    
 quiet, unspoilt area close to their   
 place of work.                        
    The average number of years that   
 residents have lived in the same area 
 is just over 38 years, though this    
 does not apply to all residents.      
    The majority of occupants are      
 married, but only about half the      
 residents asked had children.         
 Residents enjoy the surrounding       
 unspoilt countryside and the company  
 of friendly inhabitants.
