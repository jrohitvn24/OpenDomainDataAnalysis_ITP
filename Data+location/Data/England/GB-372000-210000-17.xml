		<content> The area we cover is a rural one and  
 most of the people do{gardening}in    
 their spare time.All of the gardens   
 are well kept and always look neat and
 tidy.                                 
{Fishing}is another hobby because the  
 people are near the river and they    
 have no problem in getting transport  
 because they can walk to the river    
 bank.                                 
 Some people go{horse riding}if they   
 have got a horse or they can hire one.
                                       
 People may choose to go{rambling}in   
 the fields or{shooting}pheasant or    
 pigeons.                              
 Others leave Rodley and go to other   
 places outside the area to keep fit   
 classes, dancing or photography.
