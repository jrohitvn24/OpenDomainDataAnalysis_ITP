      The area is typical of Exmoor the
 land being very boggy with peat based 
 soil.   The grassland is very poor and
 is only suitable for supporting sheep.
 The predominant plants are bracken,   
 gorse and heather.                    
      The underlying rock is a type of 
 stone peculiar to the area and is     
 known as Hangman Grits.   This is a   
 very hard form of gritstone which     
 withstands weathering.                
      Most of the area is over 1000    
 feet above sea level.   The wind      
 strength is often strong to gale      
 force.   The annual rainfall is high  
 and the highest point of Holdstone    
 Down is often obscured by low cloud or
 fog.   Conversely, in time of drought,
 it is necessary to carry water to the 
 sheep as there is no water supply.
