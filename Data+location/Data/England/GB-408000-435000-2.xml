		<title>02DIFFERENT KINDS OF FARMING</title>
		<content> It is 5th June 1985. Kate Joels and   
 Rachel Lumb went up to{Sandy Lane}to  
 interview the farmer. We asked him    
 about farming.                        
{SHEEP}_September is the mating        
 season. The lambs are  born in Spring.
 Once fattened, they are taken to      
 market in July. Summer is the clipping
 time, they stack the fleece and send  
 it to market.                         
{HENS}_Battery hens, deep litter, free 
 range. Different colour yokes are used
 e.g blue, red, green etc.             
{PIGS}_Piglets are weaned at 8wks. At  
 5wks they are put in piggy boxes.20wks
 are fattened for slaughter, weight is 
 160lbs. They are killed for pork and  
 bacon.                                
{COWS}_The farmer buys young ones and  
 keeps them for 6 months. They are     
 killed the following Spring.
