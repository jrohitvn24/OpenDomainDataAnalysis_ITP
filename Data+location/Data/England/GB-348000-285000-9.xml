		<title>09White House, Aston Munslow</title>
		<content>     The White House was the{Saxon     
{Manor}of Estune (East Town) in 1042   
 AD.  It was given to the{Stedman      
{family}by the King 1332 and became    
 their ancestral home until 1947 when  
 its present owner, Miss Purser, bought
 and restored it to open part of it to 
 the public.                           
     It has always been a family house 
 and is still lived in. You can  still 
 see parts of the hefty oak cruck      
 timbers.                              
     In 1780 a{medieval crosswing}was  
 added.  A fire in the same year burned
 down part of the original Saxon manor 
 and then a{Georgian wing}was added.   
     There is a bake oven which is in  
 the original kitchen which was used in
 the filming of "Anne Hughes' Diary" by
 the BBC.  Under the original hall lies
 the Undercroft hewn out of solid rock,
 a refuge from robbers etc.            </content>
