		<title>06LIFE IN OLDHAM- 1945/1985</title>
		<content>   Life in Oldham was hard.Children    
 left school when they were twelve and 
 went to work in the cotton mills.The  
 work was done by hand as there were no
 machines.                             
    People lived in terraced houses.   
 there were no flats or housing        
 estates. Inside they had gas.         
    The shops were small and people    
 went to the markets,there were no     
 supermarkets.There were hat, herb,    
 paper and pawn shops. People had      
 little spare time because they worked 
 longer hours.For entertainment they   
 went to the cinema or listened to     
 radios,there was no television.       
 People travelled by tramcars or by    
 foot,the rich travelled by cars.      
     Life in 1985 is a lot better than 
 it was in 1945!The homes are bigger   
 and children stay at school until 16. 
 The cotton mills have now all gone.   </content>
