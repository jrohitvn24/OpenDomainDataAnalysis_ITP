		<title>01AN AREA NEAR SEISDON</title>
		<content>   This  block lies between the        
villages of Claverley and Seisdon.     
Its eastern boundary is some seven     
kilometres from Wolverhampton and      
its western boundary about nine        
kilometres from Bridgnorth.  It        
includes some of Claverley's out-      
lying hamlets and part of the village  
of Seisdon, but otherwise there are    
no settlements of any size within      
it,only scattered houses or small      
groups of cottages.                    
   The county boundary runs through the
block dividing it fairly equally but   
very irregularly into Shropshire on the
west and Staffordshire on the east.    
   It is a stretch of undramatic but   
very pleasant countryside, most of it  
intensively farmed and sparsely popu-  
lated.
