On Sunday 9.00 was the most popular    
getting up time and the morning was    
spent swimming,attending Sunday school 
or visiting a place.A roast lunch was  
eaten at 1.00 to 2.00p.m and afternoon 
activities were playing or a family    
outing.The evening meal at 6.00p.m was 
usually a light one of sandwiches      
or salad although some children had    
their main roast meal then.            
After watching television and having a 
bath,bedtime was at 8.00p.m.
