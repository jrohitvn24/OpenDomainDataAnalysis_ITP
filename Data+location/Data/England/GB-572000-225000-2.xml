		<content>      We interviewed{Mrs Wildish}who   
 has lived in{Panfield}for 40 years.   
      Not many houses had mains water  
 supply in{1940,}so Mrs Wildish had to 
 get water from the pump in the garden 
 next door.                            
      The majority of houses were in   
{Hall Road.}Now Hall Road is less      
 important. There are many new houses  
 along{Kynastan Road.}In{1953}Mrs      
 Wildish named{Queens Gardens. St Marys
{Close, Ketleys View, Queens Gardens   
 and{Meadow Close}were all built about 
 the same time.                        
      There were more buses, both early
 and late. There was a bus at 7.00 am  
 which went to{Bocking}via{Courtauld's 
{factory,}where many people from       
{Panfield}worked. Forty years ago there
 was one{village shop}which shut for a 
 few years and then reopened as a{post 
{office}and{general store.             </content>
