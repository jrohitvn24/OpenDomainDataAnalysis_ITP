		<title>20SATURDAYS</title>
		<content>    I am woken up at seven o'clock as  
 usual by my  Hitachi {digital clock   
{radio.}I listen to the Disc Jockey    
 playing records. At about nine I go   
 down and make Mum and Dad coffee with 
 the Expresso{coffee machine.}I get it 
 really frothy. I take them the paper  
 and letters with the coffee. When we  
 are all up we sometimes work in the   
{garden}keeping it tidy. We often go   
{shopping}on Saturdays because Mum and 
 Dad work all the week. The shops are  
 crowded and boring. It takes us nearly
 an hour to get to a  big  shopping    
 centre.  When we get back I may have  
 time to play games on my{computer}or  
 perhaps there will be something good  
 on{television.}Sometimes I go up to   
 the village on my{bike}by the back    
 lanes. The main road is too dangerous.
