		<content> We,the children of Westonzoyland      
 County Primary School,Cheer Lane,     
 Westonzoyland,Near Bridgwater,in      
 the County of Somerset have enjoyed   
 working together to produce the       
 information on these pages for you.   
  Our Village and its surroundings are 
 very special.We are part of the       
 Somerset Levels,a large area of low   
 flat land which for thousands of years
 was flooded.Prehistoric man made      
 track-ways across the marshes using   
 woven branches.King Alfred burnt his  
 cakes on these Levels.Monks in the    
 Middle Ages began drainage of the area
 and this was carried in the 18th      
 Century by Dutch engineers and in the 
 1800's steam pumping stations were    
 used.The Last Battle on English soil  
 was fought here and in World War II   
 there was a large R.A.F.Station       
 here,closing in 1952.                 </content>
