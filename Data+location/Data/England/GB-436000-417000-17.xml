		<title>17Entertainment in a Local Pub</title>
		<content> In public houses children are not     
 allowed inside but outside there are  
 seats and swings for the children.    
 Inside for the over eighteens there   
 are snooker and pool tables, plus they
 play dominoes ,darts and cards but all
 this is limited to one room. It is    
 called the "Tap Room". In other rooms 
 the people entertain themselves by    
 talking or dancing to the juke box. A 
 juke box is a musical box where you   
 press a button and it plays the song  
 you want. Also people play bandits for
 enjoyment. Sometimes the owner of the 
 pub will organise a trip for men to go
 fishing or day trips to Bridlington or
 Scarborough. Some public houses have  
 football teams. If they win they have 
 parties and the mistress of the house 
 makes some food.
