		<title>05MOTHER &amp; TODDLER CLUB</title>
		<content> Therfield Mother &amp; Toddler group is   
 held weekly in the school hall.It is  
 an opportunity for mothers with       
 pre_school children in Therfield and  
 the surrounding villages to meet      
 outside their own homes.It also       
 enables the children otherwise        
 isolated from playmates of their own  
 age to mix and develop their social   
 skills.Holding the group in the school
 hall familiarises the children with   
 the building and its surroundings,    
 making starting school a less awe     
 inspiring prospect.We cater for       
 upwards of 25 children at present,with
 ages ranging from young babies through
 to 4 years old.
