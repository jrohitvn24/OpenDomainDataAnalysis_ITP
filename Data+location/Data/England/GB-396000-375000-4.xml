		<title>04Hill Farming in Cheshire.</title>
		<content>    The farm houses themselves are     
 scattered among the hillsides and some
 are even found on the exposed tops,   
 where they are vulnerable to the full 
 force of the elements.The temperature 
 on the hills is a degree or two below 
 that of the Cheshire Plain and the    
 chill factor of the wind,often lowers 
 it still further.Shelter belts of     
 trees have been planted by a number of
 the farmers,to give their houses a    
 measure of protection from the        
 wind.Built of locally quarried        
 sandstone,the farmsteads give the     
 appearance of rugged,sturdy           
 characters,which stand sentinel in    
 their isolation, surveying the        
 landscape and defying the climate's   
 harsh blast.
