		<content>Legend says that if the ancient chained
oak in Barbary Gutter falls, that Alton
will fall into the Churnet.The oak and 
Alton still stand but much of the      
deciduous woodland has disappeared.    
There is now a  predominance of        
coniferous  plantations   of pines and 
larches,inter- mingled with deciduous  
trees such as oak and  sycamore.A      
lone elm still grows on the  Ranger    
and alders grow along the riverbanks.  
          Violets, primroses and many  
wildflowers grow on the disused        
railway line which is exceedingly rich 
in plants and insects.Dingy ,grizzled  
and small skippers are to be found as  
well as the common blue and many other 
butterflies.  Indian balsalm has       
colonised the river banks,and the very 
rare insectivorous sundew grows in     
just one isolated spot. There are few  
rich meadows left unspoiled by man.    </content>
