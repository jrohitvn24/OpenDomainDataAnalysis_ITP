		<content>   Carldane Court and Chaldean Farm are
 mentioned in the Domesday Book.       
 Carldane Court used to be two small   
 cottages, with a family living in each
 cottage. The first record of it is in 
 1100. The Bishop of London owned it   
 for 60 years. He had a servant called 
 Roderick. He was a very faithful      
 servant so the Bishop gave him 130    
 acres, including the court.Roderick   
 called it"Keldene" which in English   
 means service to the King.The Parnell 
 Family bought some of it and held it  
 for 300 years.In the early 1900's most
 of the Parnell Family died.A cousin of
 the family, named Crallon inherited   
 it. He was a professional architect   
 and woodcraftsman and he was the one  
 who enlarged the cottages to almost   
 what they are today.He did a lot of   
 carving and oak pannelling which can  
 still be seen. The timberwork is good.</content>
