		<title>18A days fishing in Filey.</title>
		<content>   On Saturdays and Sundays my father  
 takes my cousin,Alan,and myself       
 fishing.We set off at 4.30a.m. and it 
 takes us about 45 minutes to reach the
 fishing ground about seven miles off  
 shore.During the week they use nets   
 and pots to catch the fish,crabs and  
 lobsters.When I am with them they use 
 rods and lines and we catch cod,      
 haddock,dogfish and blegg.We arrive   
 back in Filey at about 1p.m.          
   When they get back to Filey the     
 catch is taken to the Fishermen's shop
 in West Road.It is then filleted and  
 sent to market.                       
   When they go 'potting' it takes     
 about 20 minutes to haul in a fleet of
 pots.There are 25 pots in a fleet and 
 my father has 6 fleets.My father has  
 a blue coble called 'Deep Harmony'.
