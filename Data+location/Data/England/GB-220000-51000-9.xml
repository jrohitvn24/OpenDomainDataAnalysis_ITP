		<title>09LIFESTYLE:A SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY</title>
		<content> I usually awake at approximately 7.45,
 wash and then dress in school uniform 
 which consists of a grey skirt,white  
 blouse with maroon and silver tie and 
 grey jumper.I am usually just         
 finishing breakfast of cereal and     
 toast when Dad leaves for work at     
 8.00.Soon my friends call for me and  
 we walk about three-quarters of a mile
 to school,saying "hello" to shop-     
 keepers and people we meet.We play    
 something like the Corner game before 
 the bell rings for assembly.I         
 sometimes play the recorder for the   
 hymn.After assembly we might have     
 Maths or English.We usually do both   
 each morning.On a Monday morning,we   
 have P.E..School dinner is at 12.00.  
 I am a table monitor and I am in      
 charge of seven younger children.After
 eating my dinner,I might go out to    
 play except when I do (see P.10)      </content>
