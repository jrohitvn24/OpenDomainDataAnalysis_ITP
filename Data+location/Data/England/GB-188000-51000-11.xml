		<title>11Recording Studio at Ladock 1</title>
		<content> Mr. Wood has lived at Trendeal for    
 fifteen months. He has only been      
 recording for two months because he   
 built the recording studio himself. It
 was once{an old barn on Duchy Land    
{which Prince Charles converted into a 
{house and studio as part of a         
{development scheme.                   
                                       
 There are three rooms in the recording
 studio; one is used for the musicians.
 This room has a little room in the    
 corner where the drummer goes. There  
 are lots of microphones which go over 
 every drum so you can hear them       
 better. Another room is for Mr. Wood  
 to record in and the third for his    
 synthesisers.                         
                                       
 He is building a workshop in the      
 garden as he mends recording machines 
 as well.                              </content>
