		<content>  In our area there are three schools. 
 Our school is aprimary school,        
 consisting of children between the    
 ages of 4 and 11 years. Another school
 in our area, called Freda Gardham, has
 many more pupils than Playden and has 
 children from as far as Camber and Rye
 Harbour.                              
  The third school is Thomas Peacocke  
 Upper School. This is the top part of 
 the area Comprehensive and as well as 
 those from Rye it draws children from 
 all the surrounding villages, who have
 to be brought by bus. This is for the 
 children between the ages of 13 and   
 18.
