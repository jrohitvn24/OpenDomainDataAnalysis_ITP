		<content>  Smallholdings in the area are mostly 
 leased from the County Council but    
 some are privately owned.The average  
 size is 30 acres.A group of small-    
 holdings beside the A.49 is identical 
 and was originally built by the County
 Council to be leased to ex-servicemen 
 returning after the Great War.        
  Most smallholdings concentrate on    
 dairy farming and calf-rearing for    
 beef.A few goats are kept on one and  
 another is run as a market garden     
 selling flower and vegetable plants,  
 vegetables,fruit and eggs.Poultry are 
 kept but there are no battery systems 
  The smallholdings are usually run by 
 one family and are often used as step-
 ping stones to larger farms.Many of   
 the smallholders have another job,    
 indicating that they find it hard to  
 obtain a high enough income from their
 farming activities alone.             </content>
