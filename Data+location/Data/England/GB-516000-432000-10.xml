		<title>10A SCHOOLCHILD'S 'WORKING'DAY</title>
		<content>{On a Tuesday I get up at 7.30 and rush
 to get ready for school because I set 
 off at 8.00. We then go to the school 
 and usually get there at 8.30. I wait 
 about 10 minutes when my friends get  
 to school. When the whistle goes we   
 go inside and Mr.Crabb does the       
 register. After registration Mr.Crabb 
 tells us what we are doing that day.  
 Normally it's S.M.P, English, Mental  
 maths and computer. We start our      
 groups at about 9.30, until 10.00 we  
 do our first group.From 10.00 to 10.30
 we work on our second group.10.30 to  
 10.45 is play time. At 10.45 we work  
 until 12.00. We have lunch from 12.00 
 to 1.15 then we do cycling proficiency
 and from 2.30 to 2.45 we have play.   
 Last session we have P.E. When I get  
 home I do my piano practice have tea, 
 read and go to bed.
