		<content> INTERVIEW WITH RESIDENT:SEMI-RETIRED  
 HORSE-SALESMAN. I now own only this   
 house and garden. Now semi-retired, I 
 work part-time for the horse-feed     
 business, which will probably expand  
 its production of pony-nuts and       
 constantly improving feed for         
 thoroughbreds.This is a lonely area   
 but my wife and I are closely involved
 in the community,supporting the church
 and running the gymkhana.The new      
 "link" road will bring more people    
 into the area, expanding the village  
 of Littleham and pushing out the      
 "green belt".The E.E.C affects farmers
 around here,who resent the grain and  
 milk quotas. Most of my spare time is 
 spent in the garden,for recreation I  
 go mostly to Torrington or Barnstaple.
 My wife and I are Yorkshire people but
 it's much prettier here and we feel   
 part of a closely-knit community.     </content>
