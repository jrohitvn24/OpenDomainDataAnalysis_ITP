  "I was a farm labourer and my name   
was Harry.My costume was a shirt and a 
waistcoat.We had a pair of cord        
trousers with braces,a pair of         
wellington boots and a cap and a       
neckerchief.First I brushed the horses.
then I collected a bag of straw for the
horses' stable.Then we had our         
sandwiches.When we finished we washed a
sheep and cut all the black wool off   
the sheep's back.After that we polished
the cart,straps and reins.Then we led  
the horse round the yard and got our   
wages."
