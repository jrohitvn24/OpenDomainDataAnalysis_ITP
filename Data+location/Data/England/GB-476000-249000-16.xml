by 1950 most jobs were out of the      
village.New people from towns &amp; Cities 
had to change to village life.Some     
farmland was lost for housing,but the  
forest has not changed.There were two  
shops in Hartwell until December 1984. 
Now there is only one.Farming was mixed

changing to potatoes or sheep or beef. 
New people have brought new ideas like 
the Playgroup scheme.
