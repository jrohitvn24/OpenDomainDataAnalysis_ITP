		<title>14Whitby Town Council.</title>
		<content>  The town is administered by{         
{Scarborough Borough Council,}which    
 took over the district on 1st April,  
 1974, much to the annoyance of{Whitby}
 residents.{Whitby Town Council} is an 
 elected body, but apart from the{     
{Pannett Art Gallery}and{Museum,}it has
 no official function, except to       
 provide a very good sound-board for   
 public opinion and forms an ideal host
 council to important visitors to the  
 town. It can and does levy a rate to  
 meet its own expenses.                
  There are 18 councillors who meet    
 once a month at the Eskholme Council  
 Offices.They are elected every 4 years
 and a mayor is annually elected from  
 among the body.Members serve on school
 governing bodies.                     
  Whitby Town is twinned with Whitby in
 Ontario,Anchorage in Alaska,Stanley in
 the Falkland Islands and Tonga.       </content>
