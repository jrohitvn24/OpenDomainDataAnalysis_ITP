		<title>18CROPWELL BUTLER SINGERS</title>
		<content> The{Belvoir Revellers}are a Concert   
 Party based at Cropwell Butler. They  
 meet weekly and rehearse and perform  
 with an electronic organ. They have   
 been formed for about 10 years, and   
 comprise usually six men and six      
 ladies who live either at Cropwell    
 Butler, or in other villages in the   
 Vale of Belvoir. About twenty concerts
 are given annually, mainly between    
 October and March at Harvest Suppers, 
 Christmas Parties and in Homes for the
 Elderly. It has become tradition to   
 finish the season in March by         
 performing three concerts at Cropwell 
 Butler. The proceeds from these       
 concerts go to the Church Funds and,  
 fortunately, these three concerts are 
 always sold out!
