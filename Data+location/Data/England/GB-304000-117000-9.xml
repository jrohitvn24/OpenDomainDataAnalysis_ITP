		<title>09WESTLEIGH QUARRY</title>
		<content> There is only a fairly thin covering  
 of soil over shale rock around here.  
 There have been quarries here for a   
 long time.Many of these have now been 
 left and are covered with brambles and
 trees,but there are 2 quarries at     
 Westleigh which are still used a lot. 
 We can hear the sound of the huge     
 lorries from our school and every so  
 often we hear them blasting new rock  
 with explosives.The quarry is very    
 busy and although only 18 men work    
 there all the time,many others are    
 employed driving lorries to and from  
 the quarries.This makes the roads     
 around Burlescombe very dangerous.    
 The quarries are slowly using up a    
 hill. However they can dig down a     
 further 40 metres and expect to be    
 working there for many years yet.
