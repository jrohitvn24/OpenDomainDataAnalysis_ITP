		<title>01SOUTH SHREWSBURY</title>
		<content> This area contains the majority of    
{Shrewsbury}south of the town centre.  
 Half the area is built-up whilst the  
 south and eastern outskirts are rural.
 2OO years ago settlement would have   
 been based only on the village of     
{Meole Brace,}the{Shrewsbury}suburb of 
{Coleham}and the out-lying hamlets of  
{Betton, Sutton}and{Pulley.}The coming 
 of the railways saw rapid expansion in
 the{Belle Vue}area whilst the affluent
{Kingsland}developed more slowly. Strip
 development followed along the major  
 roads, the{London Road}and{Wenlock    
{Road}to the south-east and along the{ 
{Hereford Road}to the south linking    
 Meole with{Belle Vue.}Following the   
 195O's council house building at{Meole
 and{Springfield}there has been infill 
 with the{Sutton}and{Reabrook Estates. 
 Only the hamlets of{Betton}and{Pulley 
 have remained relatively undeveloped. </content>
