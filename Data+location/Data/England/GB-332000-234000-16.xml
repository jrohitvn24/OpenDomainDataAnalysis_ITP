		<title>16THE YOUNG FARMERS CLUB</title>
		<content>   Young Farmers is a club. Sometimes  
 you will get people comming to a      
 meeting to tell you about flower      
 arranging, calving etc. We also have  
 parties and run concerts as well as   
 going carol singing at Christmas.     
   There are competitions for the older
 members of the clubs.There is the     
 Junior Field day which is the same but
 for the younger members. There are    
 people in charge of the club who have 
 to be voted for by the other members. 
 There is a chairperson, a secretary   
 and a vice-chairperson who organise   
 most of the activities.
