 contract. The association has two main
 laboratories, one is the Headquarters 
 at Windermere, the other in Dorset.   
 The FBA library at Windermere is      
 probably the best freshwater biology  
 library in the world.                 
    In 1977 a unit was set up in       
 Teesdale to monitor different flow    
 regimes on Salmon and Trout. The unit 
 left in 1984 but a presence is        
 maintained by staff at the NWA in     
 Lartington.                           
    When Cow Green Reservoir was built 
 a study of fish populations was made  
 in the Tees and its tributaries. The  
 Lartington staff made a study of water
 temperatures beacause of the use of   
 upper Teesdale land. Lartington also  
 provided electronic backup. Data is   
 collected with water level recorders  </content>
