		<content> Mr Tomkinson has lived in Queensbury  
 for all his life with his family. Most
 of Mr Tomkinson's family have lived in
 Queensbury  for generations. The      
 Queensbury life differs from Bradford 
 life as the weather is winterie at    
 winter as there are more hills about. 
 In summer its very hot  as they are   
 very high up. Some people move there  
 as the scenery is good as you can see 
 for miles and miles.Mainly old people 
 move to Queensbury is alot quieter    
 than Allerton or Thornton people are  
 alot  friendlier as you could be      
 walking down a street in  Queensbury  
 and someone would say "hello" but in  
 Allerton they'd just walk past.       
 Queensbury is a pretty busy place     
 during the afternoon when school      
 children come out of school.
