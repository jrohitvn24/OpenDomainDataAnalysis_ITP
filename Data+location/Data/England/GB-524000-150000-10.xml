		<title>10REIGATE NATURAL HISTORY CLUB</title>
		<content>    The Holmesdale{Natural History     
{Club,}founded in 1857, now has a      
 membership of over 200. The original  
 aim of studying Natural History has   
 been widened to include Archaeology,  
 Local History and Ornithology in the  
 Reigate/Redhill area.                 
    Micklefield School pupils saw some 
 of the interesting exhibits the Club  
 has collected on a visit in May to the
 small, privately owned{museum}at l4,  
 Croydon Rd, Reigate.  The Natural     
 History section includes stuffed birds
 (eagles, owls, paradise birds &amp;       
 sparrows), fish, fossils &amp; insects.   
    Old postcards, maps and slides     
 vividly illustrate{local history.     
 Exhibits, many from excavations in    
 which Club members have participated, 
 include the skeleton of a young  Saxon
 girl, medieval drain pipes, and       
 pottery associated with witchcraft.   </content>
