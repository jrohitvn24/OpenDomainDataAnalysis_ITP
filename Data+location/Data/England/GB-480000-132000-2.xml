		<title>02River Wey and Watermeadows.</title>
		<content> The river Wey is crossed by four roads
 very recently the stonework of the    
 narrow bridge carrying the B3004 was  
 conserved during widening. Public foot
 paths cross the Wey at 5 places and   
 from paths alongside the walker sees  
 reeds, rushes and balsams under alder 
 trees, or the open lake of Waterside. 
 Formerly 3 watermills flourished, and 
 a highly engineered system of water   
 meadows was in operation to raise     
 grass productivity. Initiated probably
 in the 1650's, the watermeadows were  
 irrigated from the river by linked    
 channels, small stone aqueducts and   
 long stretches of stone work, with    
 hatches to allow or prevent the flow. 
 It was a labour intensive system      
 controlled by the water baliffs and   
 'drowners', and persisted into this   
 century. The urge in the 1980's to    
 conserve this evidence is very strong.</content>
