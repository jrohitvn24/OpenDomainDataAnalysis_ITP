		<title>20A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A VET</title>
		<content> My Dad is called John and he is a     
 Veterinary Surgeon, in Odiham. His    
 surgery is at Colt Hill, opposite to  
 the War Memorial. He goes to work at  
 8.30, in the morning. He checks the   
 answer-phone for calls. Then, he      
 attends to the animals, whose owners  
 have made appointments at the surgery.
 He travels to Fleet, along the A287,  
 Farnham road, to another surgery.     
 When the surgery is over, he visits   
 the farms to see the animals. After a 
 quick lunch, he continues his visits  
 before the surgery opens at 2.00 pm,  
 in Odiham. He has more visits before  
 going to Fleet for an evening surgery.
 He is on call, one night in four.     
 There are four Vets in the practice.
