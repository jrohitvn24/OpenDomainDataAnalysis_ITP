		<content> In 1984/5 a dispute arose about       
 building a road across the stretch of 
 land known as Coundon Wedge. This is a
 beautiful country area with a brook,  
 wild flowers, small animals, birds,   
 blackberries and strawberries.        
                                       
 Jaguar, a car firm producing world    
 famous executive cars are planning an 
 expansion programme. This would       
 involve an increased traffic flow     
 along Browns Lane, a residential raod 
 which is already suffering from excess
 traffic and all its complications     
 (noise, fumes, pedestrian dangers).   
 The proposed road would divert some of
 this traffic much to the benefit of   
 the people of Browns Lane but at the  
 expense of destroying an area of      
 natural beauty.
