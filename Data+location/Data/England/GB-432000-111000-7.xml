		<title>07TOTTON WESTERN BY-PASS</title>
		<content> The Totton western by-pass is being   
 built to allow traffic from the       
 Waterside area to get to the motorway 
 (M27) quickly and easily. It will cost
 two and a half million pounds to build
 and it will be two miles long. There  
 are twelve companies involved in      
 constructing it and it will have five 
 roudabouts, two bridges, one subway   
 and a calvert which will carry Bartley
 Water under the road.                 
 It is estimated that twelve thousand  
 cars a day will use the road. The road
 will take ninety weeks to complete and
 it will be finished by December 1985. 
 No one opposed the construction of the
 road and as yet no one has been       
 seriously injured during the building.
 The building contractors did not have 
 to demolish any buildings of any shape
 or size because it is being built on  
 open fields and woodland.             </content>
