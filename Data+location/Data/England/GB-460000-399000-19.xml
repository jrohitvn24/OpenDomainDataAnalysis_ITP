		<content>{(1.Hot Rice. }                        
 We stand in a circle with our legs    
 apart.One person bounces a ball which 
 is allowed to run through someones    
 legs.This person then chases and tries
 to hit someone with the ball.When they
 are all hit the game begins again.    
{(2.Baseball:                          
 Baseball is like rounders only you use
 a 3ft. bat and a hard ball.You have to
 hit the ball and go round all the     
 bases.You are out if you run and a    
 base is blocked,also if you hit a     
 catch.                                
{(3.Skipping:                          
 You need your mum's washing line to   
 skip with.One person holds the line at
 each end and turns it.The object of   
 skipping is not to stop the rope while
 jumping over it.If you do then you    
 take the place of whoever is turning  
 the rope at one end.                  </content>
