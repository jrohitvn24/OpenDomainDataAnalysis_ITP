		<title>14The Quedam,Yeovil.</title>
		<content>       The Quedam was started in 1983 &amp;
 today Phase 1 is open.Of 33 shops,    
 about half are operating &amp; the rest   
 are let.The unfinished part,Phase     
 2,will be operating by August 1985.   
       The shops form an attractive    
 street(for pedestrians only).They are 
 serviced from a lower level by means  
 of 8 lifts.Vehicles delivering goods  
 below'ground'level ,are observed by   
 CCTV Cameras(which also aid security),
 &amp; their access controlled by traffic  
 lights.                               
       Although the area is attractive 
 &amp; convenient,it doesn't seem to       
 attract many shoppers.This may be     
 because there is no great variety of  
 shops.Among the 22 shops now open,5   
 are ladies' fashions, &amp; 4 are mens'   
 fashions.There is also a shoe shop &amp; a
 jewellers.
