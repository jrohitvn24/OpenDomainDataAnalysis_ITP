Farming is one of the basic industries 
of }SUFFOLK}, and this area illustrates
major changes that have taken place in 
agriculture since the turn of the      
century. The town of {IPSWICH} has     
always been an important town for      
Suffolk farming, the large firm of     
Ransomes has supplied not only local   
farmers but also the rest of the world 
with agricultural machinery. Whilst    
fertiliser has always been available   
from the local Fisons factory. It is   
the {SUGAR-BEET} industry which        
dominates the landscape, with the smell
from the nearby sugar-beet factory     
being strong when the wind is from the 
west during the winter harvest months. 
Barley and wheat are the other two main
crops planted by the local farmers.
