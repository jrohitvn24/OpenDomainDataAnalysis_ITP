		<title>01WETHERBY (EAST) INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> The area east of Wetherby forms part  
 of the undulating Vale of York. Most  
 of the area is underlain by Magnesian 
 Limestone but there are extensive     
 glacial deposits.                     
                                       
 The western part of the area includes 
 the main parts of Wetherby, the race  
 course and the Youth Custody Centre.  
 The remainder of the land is          
 agricultural, with arable farming     
 being dominant - especially the       
 production of barley, wheat, oil seed 
 rape and sugar beet.                  
                                       
 Recently the landscape has changed    
 as the increasing intensiveness of    
 farming has resulted in the removal of
 many hedgerow and tree field          
 boundaries thus causing a loss of     
 habitat for many types of wildlife.
