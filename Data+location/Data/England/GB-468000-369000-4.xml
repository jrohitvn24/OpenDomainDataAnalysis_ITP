 however an area of coniferous woodland
 known as Bevercotes Park in the centre
 of the grid. The lowest point is less

 highest point being over 100 metres.  
 To the east of the B6387 half a mile  
 north of Walesby there is a wooded    
 area called Haughton Decoy, this is   
 one of the largest remaining decoys in
 England. On top of the hill that      
 separates the two main roads running  
 through the area there is a television
 communication repeater station, this  
 is a metal structure .
