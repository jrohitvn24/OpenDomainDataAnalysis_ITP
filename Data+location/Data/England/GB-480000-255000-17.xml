		<title>17 A VISIT TO A STUD FARM</title>
		<content>On the 19th.June 1985 we went to a stud
farm to ask some questions about the   
farm and the horses.                   
On the farm there were about 120 horses
and 60 foals. There were also some     
dogs,ferrets and chickens.             
We asked the farmer what she grew in   
her fields and she told us that she    
only grew grass and hay in the summer  
whch she harvested so that she could   
feed the animals in the winter.        
The farmer said she used to train      
horses to race-some in the Grand       
National-and that she had some of the  
Queen's horses here as well as some    
belonging to other members of the      
Royal Family.Prince Charles and        
Princess Anne own horses here.We were  
very surprised about this as we often  
pass the farm but had no idea about the
owners until the day of our visit.
