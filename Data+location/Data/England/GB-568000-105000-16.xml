		<content> MR CLARKE HAS BEEN A FISHERMAN AT     
 NORMANS BAY FOR SIX YEARS. HIS BOAT   
 THE KELLY GAL, IS TWENTY FEET LONG. IT
 COST JUST UNDER Â£1000 SECOND HAND. IT 
 RUNS ON DIESEL OIL. HE GOES OUT EIGHT 
 MILES TO THE WATERS BY THE SOVEREIGN  
 LIGHTHOUSE TO FISH. THE WATER HERE IS 
 17-20 METRES DEEP. TRAMMEL NETS ARE   
 USED, FIXED TO THE BOAT. THE FISHERMEN
 GO OUT WHEN THERE IS A FULL TIDE, BUT 
 NOT WHEN THERE ARE GALE FORCE WINDS.  
 THEY STAY OUT AT SEA FOR 6-7 HOURS.   
 THEY SELL PLAICE, COD, SOLE, DABS, AND
 SKATE. ONE OF THE FISHERMEN'S WIVES   
 SAYS IT IS SO PEACEFUL IN NORMANS BAY.
 SHE HAS LIVED THERE FOR 38 YEARS. SHE 
 HAD WATER LAID INTO HER HOUSE ONLY 16 
 YEARS AGO. SHE GOES IN HER HUSBAND'S  
 FISHING BOAT TO THE SHOPS IN BEXHILL. 
 AS A CHILD SHE LIVED IN LONDON BUT    
 WOULDN'T WANT TO GO BACK. SHE THINKS  
 EVERYONE IS SO FRIENDLY HERE.         </content>
