		<title>11 The Palace of Bromley</title>
		<content>  The site of the "Palace of Bromley"  
has been lived on for over 1000 years. 
From 955 to 1845 the palace was owned  
by the Bishops of Rochester. The main  
Georgian building dates from 1775,it   
has the Bishops coat-of-arms in stone  
on the pediment over the front door.   
The outbuildings of 1775 have been     
lost; extensions are much more modern. 
The garden has part of the old         
ice-house,the remains of the old moat, 
occupied by "Hissing Sid",the swan,and 
a well giving "medicinal" waters.      
  From 1935 to 1980 Stockwell College  
of Education occupied the site and     
added the library and other buildings. 
After the closure of the College       
Bromley Council took over and re-named 
the complex as the "Civic Centre".Now  
it houses council officers serving a   
Borough with a population of 300,000   
covering 59 square miles.              </content>
