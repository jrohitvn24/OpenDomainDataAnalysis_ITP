 local government dealing with matters 
 concerning just one parish. Their     
 funds are allocated from the rates.   
 The number of members depends on the  
 size of the parish but in the case of 
 the size of Shepreth there are seven  
 members. There are eight meetings of  
 the committee and one open village    
 meeting per year. The annual village  
 meeting is open to members of the     
 public so that they can speak, the    
 public can attend other meetings but  
 cannot speak. They look after the     
 general facilities of the village such
 as recreation ground, bus shelters,   
 seats, footpaths, and control land as 
 recreation ground, memorial, school   
 field, church pits, allotments and    
 meadows.
