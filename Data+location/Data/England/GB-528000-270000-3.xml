		<content> In this area we have several large RAF
 stations. Because of this there are   
 large numbers of servicemen and their 
 families who only live in the area for
 a few years. This RAF family have had 
 fifteen moves during dad's 22 years   
 in the RAF. Their children had been to
 five different schools so they now go 
 to boarding school. They find most    
 of their friends within the RAF       
 because, with moving, they find it    
 difficult to make friends within the  
 local population. The father is on    
 long periods of stand-by and is often 
 away from home on training. At these  
 times his wife has complete           
 responsibility for the family and     
 home. He thinks he is doing a         
 worthwhile task as he feels that he   
 is helping to protect the kind of life
 we enjoy in this country.
