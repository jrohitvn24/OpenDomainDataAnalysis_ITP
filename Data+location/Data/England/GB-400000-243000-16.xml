		<title>16Our Vicar,Hampton,Evesham.</title>
		<content> Our vicar wanted to be a vicar ever   
 since he was three years old !{Before 
{he was a Vicar}he did heavy engineer- 
 ing work for a year. After that he    
 went to University then taught for    
 five years and then he trained to be a
 Vicar. His{hobbies}are animals, horse-
 riding, reading, listening to music   
 and he used to be in the Blue Sahara  
 Stompers Jazz Band. He was the        
 drummer. The{best thing in the world, 
 he said, was clever medical care. The 
{saddest thing}in the world was people 
 being hungry in some countries when   
 there are piles of food in other      
 countries. The{worst part of his work 
 is going to meetings that go on for a 
 long time. Sometimes the Vicar has    
 grumbling letters and sometimes he has
 nice letters. He said{the most        
{important thing}about being a priest  
 is saying prayers.                    </content>
