 rural.There are ten farms ranging in  
 size from 14-400 acres.The area is    
 sandwiched between the towns of{

{Town}is slowly encroaching from the   
 West.Two thousand houses and a number 
 of light industry factories are       
 planned for the near future.This will 
 change the nature of the area.There   
 are two residential areas.The village 
 of{Moore}with approximately 600       
 inhabitants and a small part of the   
 village of{Walton}.There are a number 
 of industrial concerns in the         
 area.Some of these are service        
 industries such as warehouse
