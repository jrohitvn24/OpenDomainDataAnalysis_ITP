		<title>09POPULATION OF TADLEY (AGE)</title>
		<content>  Statistics for the population of the 
 Tadley area broken down by age and sex
 were made available to the writer.    
 These figures and statistics          
 based on the 1981 Census have been    
 used in this report. In this area     
 22.4% of the population are under 16, 
 66.4% are between 16 and retirement   
 age and 11.2% are over retirement age.
 The comparative national figure are:  
 22.2%, 59.9% and 17.9% respectively,  
 indicating that the Tadley area has a 
 younger than average population,      
 indeed 65% of the population is under 
 40. At around the ages of 60-65 there 
 is a dramatic fall in the population, 
 due not to a high death rate but      
 rather showing that Tadley is a place 
 where people live while working but   
 that they retire elsewhere. In the    
 rural area the proportion of older    
 people seems to be somewhat higher.   </content>
