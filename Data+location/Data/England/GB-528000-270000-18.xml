		<content>  The Town Crier is a free tabloid     
 newspaper published in St Ives. There 
 are four editions which cover an area 
 from St Neots to Cambridge and the    
 Fens. The paper was started in 1973   
 and the main office is situated in the
 old courtroom and police station in St
 Ives. It has developed from just an   
 advertising sheet to a newspaper with 
 various editorial articles and        
 extensive advertising space. 150,000  
 copies are distributed over the area  
 by schoolchildren watched over by     
 supervisors who are responsible for   
 3,000 copies each. Thirteen people are
 involved in the production of the     
 paper. There are three editorial      
 staff, three type-setters, three      
 paste-up staff and four proof-readers.
 The paper is printed in Diss. The     
 paper may be printed in full colour   
 soon.                                 </content>
