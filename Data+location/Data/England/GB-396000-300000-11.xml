		<title>11Wild life in Willenhall</title>
		<content> On St Giles church there is a kestrel 
 nest and there are swifts and house   
 sparrows nesting in the tower.Some of 
 the nests are wrecked because they are
 built in the bells.At my old school we
 built a bird table and made a study of
 the birds which came.There were robins
 blackbirds,starlings and various sorts
 of tits attracted by the hanging nuts 
 which we put out.We even saw some     
 white doves on the school roof.In my  
 house there are some sparrows nesting 
 in the attic and during July 4 chicks 
 have fallen out and have died.        
   Although Willenhall is an industrial
 area there is still plenty of wildlife
 to see.At Noose Lane there used to be 
 a pond which has been turned into a   
 nature area.It is common to see       
 hedgehogs in the streets at night and 
 even foxes can be seen scavenging in  
 the dustbins.                         </content>
