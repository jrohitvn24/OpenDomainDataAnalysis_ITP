		<title>16Health care in Chatteris</title>
		<content>    The present doctors' surgery in    
 Chatteris has three young doctors, two
 male and one female, plus numerous    
 other ancilliary staff.  A            
 computerised system of patients'      
 records is kept with facility to      
 recall those requiring various        
 vaccinations and injections eg        
 rubella, tuberculosis  and tetanus    
 (this area is high risk).             
    The surgery itself is a new        
 building purposely designed in order  
 to house various clinics, such as a   
 Baby Clinic, Diet Clinic, chiropodist 
 surgery, there is a nurse always in   
 attendance. The number of patients    
 catered for is about six thousand and 
 some of these are visited by health   
 visitors and social workers who also  
 have their own office at the surgery. 
 The registrar of births and deaths is 
 also in attendance three days weekly. </content>
