On Saturday and Sunday I went to my dad’s house. I had to be quiet because everyone was asleep. When they woke up they got dressed and went out.  Then I had to go home, when we got home we went to the park then I came home and went to sleep. &lt;br />&lt;br /> When I woke up I went  to my  dad’s again I went to the beach with my dad then I came home and went to bed  and I had a really good time.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
