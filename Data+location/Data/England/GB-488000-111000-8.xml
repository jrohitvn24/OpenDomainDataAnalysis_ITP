		<title>08Farming Around East Dean</title>
		<content> All the farmland belongs to Goodwood  
 Estate and the farmers are tenants.   
 There are two mixed farms at East     
 Dean. New House Farm comprimises 340  
 acres, some of which is used for      
 cereal growing. There is a flock of   
 650 pedigree South Down sheep and a   
 herd of 75 Aberdeen Angus cattle.     
                                       
 Droke Farm comprises 1,000 acres, 600 
 of which is arable, mainly cereals.   
 The rest of the land is for running   
 the cattle, 200 head of beef, 100     
 dairy cows and 150 young stock.       
 Goodwood estate farms the land at     
 Charlton. Sheep and cattle graze some 
 fields but the majority is used for   
 cereal growing. The woodland at       
 Charlton is used for breeding game    
 birds for the winter 'shooting'       
 season. They belong to Manor Farm at  
 Singleton.                            </content>
