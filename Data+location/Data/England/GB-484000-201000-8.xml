		<title>08Prestwood - Survey</title>
		<content>  We designed a survey of all the      
children who attend P.M.S. There are   
272 boys and girls at P.M.S. and 180   
returned the questionaire - a good     
sample. We asked questions about many  
things and put this information on     
our RML 480Z Quest-d file. There are   
9 classes of girls and boys of mixed   
ability from 8 - 12. 3 classes in the  
4th. yr. (11-12yrs) and 2 in 1st. 2nd. 
and 3rd. We have compared some of these
facts with information from the 1881   
census of this area which we also put  
onto a Quest file. Maybe it will be    
even more interesting in 100 or        
1000yrs. time. We hope you enjoy       
reading it wherever or whenever you    
are.  (We allowed for brothers and     
sisters in school in our statistics    
by having only the {oldest} child in   
a family in school fill in a form).
