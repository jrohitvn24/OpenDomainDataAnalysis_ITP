		<title>12BARTONBURY</title>
		<content>     Bartonbury is an old Devonshire   
 house in the parish of Down St Mary.  
 It was built about 1545-50. Bartonbury
 has had some recent changes but apart 
 from that most of it is original. The 
 hall has still got its open fireplace.
 All the old Devon farmhouses at that  
 time had their living room and kitchen
 combined, and the original house at   
 Bartonbury was the same, but it was   
 enlarged in 1620 to take a growing    
 family, and a kitchen was added at one
 end, with a bedroom above. At the     
 other end of the house a big barn was 
 built.  The hall had oak panelling all
 round, and beside the fireplace is an 
 ancient doorway leading to an old     
 staircase which is the original one   
 from 400 years ago.
