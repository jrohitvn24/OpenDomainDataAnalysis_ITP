		<content>    Milk production is almost          
 exclusively confined to Fresian herds 
 though the Holstein is gaining in pop-
 ularity.  The milk cows are mainly put
 to beef bulls to produce calves for   
 sale to those who rear them for beef. 
 All milking is now by machine and milk
 is collected by bulk tanker.          
    In the past two years farmers have 
 run a few more suckler cows producing 
 beef animals and more sheep are now   
 kept for the lambs which are sold in  
 May or September at the local markets.
    Both suckler cows and sheep have   
 increased due to the introduction of  
 government imposed milk quotas as     
 there is a European surplus of milk.  
    The land is heavily fertilised with
 nitrogen based chemical fertilisers   
 for a better growth of grass cut for  
 silage in June and August.  Some hay  
 is made but only for calves and sheep.</content>
