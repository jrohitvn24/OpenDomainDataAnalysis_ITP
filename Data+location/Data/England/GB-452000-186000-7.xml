		<content>Few houses in the village date before  
1600 as a fire destroyed the village in
1628. The older homes have oak and elm 
timber beams with infill of brick and  
mortar. Some of the houses have        
thatched rooves whilst some about      
150yrs old have hand made clay tiles.  
Iron and lead pipes take water. The    
oldest houses are in Church Close and  
Shoe Lane some of these being converted
barns. Near the Croft there is a 300yr 
old house that was originally only 6ft 
tall made with mud. This was later     
extended by lathe and plaster into a   
two storey building and about 70-100yrs
ago was again extended with red brick. 
The house is curently being gutted and 
there is little evidence of the        
original building material. Houses     
built this century are mainly brick    
with tiled rooves, plastic gutters and 
downpipes and lack chimneys after 1950.</content>
