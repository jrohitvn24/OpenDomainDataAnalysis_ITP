		<title>07BERWICK CHURCH HISTORY</title>
		<content> Church of the Holy Trinity            
  Built 1652. Foundation stone         
 APRIL 26th 1650. Charles ordered  the 
 building of the church, as existing   
 church St. Marys  was too small.Money 
  was  collected from  churches all    
 over England and Â£36 left from        
 constrction of Old Bridge was  used.  
 The strong walls of Berwick castle    
 were pulled down hauled in horse drawn
 carts and used to  build the church.  
 Coats of arms from the exterior of the
 castle can be seen above the          
 gallery.A tower was planned but Oliver
 Cromwell on his way to the battle of  
 Dunbar would not allow this as he did 
 not approve of either Church Towers   
 or Church bells.  So  this church has 
 a flat roof. There is only one other  
 church in England which was built in  
 the same way.                         
                                       </content>
