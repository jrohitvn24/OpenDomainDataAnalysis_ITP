		<content>  St Lawrences was the parish church   
 of Upton, now a part of Slough but    
 originally a separate village.It is   
 one of the oldest churches in         
 Slough.The original church was        
 Saxon,this was replaced by a Norman   
 stone building.The Tower and the nave 
 still stand and Upton was mentioned in
 the Domesday Book.                    
  Local building material of flints and
 "pudding stones" was used and can     
 still be seen.                        
  Sir William Herschel,the famous      
 astronomer,was buried here in 1822,   
 having discovered Uranus in 1781,and  
 built the largest telescope of the    
 time in 1789.                         
  Thomas Grey is said to be referring  
 to St Lawrences in his"Elegy in a     
 Country Churchyard"                   
  The church was fully restored in     
 1981.                                 </content>
