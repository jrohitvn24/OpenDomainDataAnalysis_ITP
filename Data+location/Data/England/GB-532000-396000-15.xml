		<content>   95% of the people interviewed were  
 very happy living here,whilst over 75%
 fo them worked within the survey area.
  However,of the newer inhabitants more
 than 60% of them travelled to the     
 surrounding district for their        
 jobs,largely in Grimsby 16 kms.north. 
                                       
  35% of the population had been born  
 within 8 kms. of where they now live, 
 which would show that they must be    
 contented with the area.              
                                       
  Only 15% were regular visitors to    
 either of the churches,although this  
 figure was higher amongst children,   
 many of whom went regularly to Sunday 
 school each week.There are no other   
 places of worship other than C of E,  
 or Methodist chapel,the few Catholic  
 families travelling to Grimsby to     
 worship.                              </content>
