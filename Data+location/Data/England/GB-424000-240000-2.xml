		<title>02NEW RESIDENTS IN SHIPSTON</title>
		<content>   Many new houses have been built in  
 Shipston-on Stour in recent years.    
 There were approximately 1100 houses  
 in the town 5 years ago and there are 
 1490 in 1985.People are moving to     
 Shipston from various parts of the    
 country, but mainly from the south.   
  We asked several new residents what  
 they thought of Shipston-on-Stour.    
  Mrs Hadgekiss and her family moved to
 Shipston because her husband's firm   
 moved.She found Shipston convenient   
 for shopping.                         
  Mrs Kant moved to Shipston because   
 she liked the new houses.             
  Mrs Wolf preferred Shipston to       
 Manchester because it is smaller and  
 she felt it was better for her        
 children.                             
  Mrs Gray said that Shipston-on-Stour 
 was much more peaceful than London,   
 and was the ideal place to live.      </content>
