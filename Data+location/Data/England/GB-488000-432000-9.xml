		<title>09WALK TO N.CAVE PLAYING FIELD</title>
		<content>    My favourite walk in our reference 
 grid is to go down Station Road       
 (ref.895323),up Everthorpe Road past  
 Claire's garden and up to the         
 whispering trees.  You then go past   
 the houses until you get to a public  
 footpath which goes through a field   
 and over a stile and into the Playing 
 Fields.  Pass by a big oak tree and   
 the pavilion and then enjoy fun on the
 swings.  Carefully across the road and
 past our picturesque church down to   
 the soft sandy beck.  If it's a warm  
 day I recommend a paddle.  Now you    
 turn back and return the way you came.
 This is an enjoyable walk for the dog 
 as well as being pleasant for people  
 from one to eighty.
