		<title>15Doctor's Gate Footpath</title>
		<content>       {Doctor's Gate}is a local       
 footpath leading from Old Glossop onto
{Bleaklow.}It is a popular route with  
 walkers as it joins onto the{Pennine  
{Way.}It used to be a Roman road from{ 
{Melandra Castle}near Glossop to the   
 Roman fort at{Brough.}In places it is 
 paved.                                
        A local legend is that the name
 comes from a{local doctor} who was    
 under the power of the{Devil.}To get  
 his freedom he had to race against the
{Devil}on horseback and win.           
        The{doctor}lost the race       
 because the{Devil}used black magic.   
 The{doctor}found out that as long as  
 he stayed on the other side of the    
 river he was free from the power of   
 the{Devil.}
