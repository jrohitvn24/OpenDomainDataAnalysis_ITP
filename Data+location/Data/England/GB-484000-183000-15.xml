		<title>15THE GHOST OF BISHAM ABBEY.</title>
		<content>   Bisham Abbey is thought to be       
 haunted by the ghost of Dame Elizabeth
 Hoby. She was born in 1527, and died  
 at the age of 82. She had been married
 twice. Her first husband left her with
 4 children. In 1573 she married Lord  
 John Russel and had 3 more children:  
 Thomas, Anna and Elizabeth.           
   Elizabeth Hoby was a very powerful  
 and intelligent woman. She could speak
 4 languages, and did not enjoy the    
 company of those less intelligent than
 herself. Her daughter, Anna, was very 
 clever, but unfortunately Thomas was  
 not. It is said that she used to whip 
 her son because he often got things   
 wrong, and that one day her whipping  
 caused his death.                     
   It is not certain that she did this,
 but people believe that she haunts the
 Abbey to punish those who called her a
 murderess.                            </content>
