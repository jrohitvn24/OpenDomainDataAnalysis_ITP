		<title>05STAPLOW AND SURROUNDING AREA</title>
		<content> This country area is mainly used for  
 arable farming - hops and to a lesser 
 degree fruit growing. It includes one 
 small hamlet,{Staplow,}of approx. 14  
 houses and an Inn (Free House).       
 Otherwise, housing is scarce and      
 scattered.                            
 The{main problems}raised in the area  
 were the decrease in acreage of hops  
 and soft fruit.{The decrease in hops  
 is due to the effect of the           
 breathalyser, the miners strike of    
 1984-85, high unemployment, changes in
 the EEC policy, but basically to high 
 mechanisation with harvesting,        
 producing a higher yield.{The decrease
{in fruit growing}is due to the high   
 cost of labour (pickers) and again EEC
 Policy. This in turn has decreased the
 number of customers at the Inn.
