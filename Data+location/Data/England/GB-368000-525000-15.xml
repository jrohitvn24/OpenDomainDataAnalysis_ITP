		<title>15DUFTON BARYTES MINE</title>
		<content> High on the fells above Dufton are the
 old lead mines.The spoil-heaps are now
 being reworked for their barytes      
 content.This is a valuable mineral    
 used in the oil-drilling industry.    
 The main working now takes place on   
 the bleak &amp; windy fellside at about   
 600m OD.The climate is severe &amp; causes
 great difficulties to the operators as
 it is extremely cold at this height in
 winter.Even during the summer it is   
 often unpleasantly cold,misty &amp; wet.  
 The mine is reached by a long,steep &amp; 
 very rough track over open country &amp;  
 along the side of a narrow,rocky      
 valley.The track is often destroyed by
 rain &amp; landslips &amp; has to be          
 continually remade to allow the       
 passage of the heavy ore-carrying     
 vehicles down to the village,across   
 the village green to a depot beyond.
