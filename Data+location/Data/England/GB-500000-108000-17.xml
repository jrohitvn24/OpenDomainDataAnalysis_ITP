		<title>17ON AN ARUN MEANDER - BURPHAM</title>
		<content> Burpham, a saxon burg, lies at the end
 of a three mile cul-de-sac with       
 panoramic views. The church still has 
 its own vicar. Across from the church 
 lies a pub, with parking facilities,  
 a recreation groung complete with     
 village hall. Nearby is the old forge,
 the farrier sells ornamental ironwork 
 on Mondays and Tuesdays, whilst       
 Wednesday, Thursday and Friday sees   
 him out shoeing horses. The           
 environment is mainly affluent, with  
 attractive houses and gardens. Burpham
 is on a spur resulting in a high-     
 banked drop, dense with vegetation,   
 down to the river Arun below, with its
 wet-lands and marsh. Westwards, cattle
 graze the grasslands, crossed by a    
 railway line. The woodlands are       
 deciduous. Amenities; main drains,    
 water, electricity, bus Fridays and   
 school bus. Burpham is lively.        </content>
