		<title>18GREENSIDE - OUR VILLAGE.</title>
		<content>  Most of the men in Greenside were    
 coal miners. When they got home their 
 wives had the tin bath ready in front 
 of a blazing fire. The other members  
 of the family had to go into a        
 different room in the house. The      
 houses in our street have changed from
 what they used to be like.            
  There was a picture hall near Mitton 
 Street at one time. The "Temp" as it  
 is known locally used to be called the
 Temperence Bar and it sold milk       
 because temperence means              
 non-alcoholic. The street next to the 
 Temp was built by the miners.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
