		<content>   The area is rural with evenly       
 dispersed farms and two tiny hamlets  
 centered on{Evesbatch}and{Uplands.}A  
 church service is held at Evesbatch   
 once a fortnight but all other social 
 functions are sought outside the area.
   The underlying geology is of        
 Devonian sandstone incised by the     
{River Leadon}and its tributaries to   
 give undulating topography with fairly
 steep slopes, which in places give    
 moderate limitations that restrict    
 choice of crops and demand careful    
 management, through gradient, shallow 
 soils and liability to soil erosion.  
 In valley bottoms problems of wetness 
 occur, in places combatted by improved
 field drainage.                       
   Farms have amalgamated and land use 
 has adapted to changing markets.      
   Professional classes are replacing  
 farm workers in renovated residences. </content>
