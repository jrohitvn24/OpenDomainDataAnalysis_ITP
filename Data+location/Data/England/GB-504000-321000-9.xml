		<content> This Summer the weather has not been  
 very good at all.There has been a lot 
 of thunder and lighting.But on Monday 
 afternoons the weather has been pretty
 good (lucky for us because it is      
 swimming).On mid and late June the    
 weather has been nice to us aswell.   
 We have a Conservation area at our    
 School,we do not touch it.We leave it 
 for the butterflies,other insects and 
 the birds.Pheasants nest in our       
 Conservation area aswell.We have a    
 stream at the end of the conservation 
 area.There are lots of                
 frogs,toads,tadpoles and newts in     
 it.The trees include :Oak,Ash,Willow  
 and Hazel.We hope there will be some  
 nuts for the Squirrels.We have a lot  
 of Daffodils this Spring.We have a    
 fence around the area.Sometimes we    
 have a lot of rain and the stream     
 overflows.                            </content>
