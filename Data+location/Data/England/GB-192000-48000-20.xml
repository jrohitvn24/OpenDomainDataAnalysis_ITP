		<content>  Grampound has two football teams.The 
 senior team has been in existance for 
 many years but the under 12's was     
 begun in 1985.Both teams play league  
 matches which takes them all over the 
 County of Cornwall to play.The senior 
 team also play cup matches when they  
 attempt to get through each round then
 into the final to win a cup.All the   
 players do not live in Grampound some 
 come from other villages but prefer   
 to play for Grampound.                
  The Archery Club meets in the village
 hall every Thursday evening but does  
 not attract many people from the      
 village.Most of the members come from 
 other villages and towns.When the     
 weather is fine the archers practice  
 outside on the Recreation field,but   
 when it is wet they have to use the   
 hall which is not so good as it is not
 really long enough.                   </content>
