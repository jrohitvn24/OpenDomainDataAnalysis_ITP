		<title>19Quixhill Shire Horses</title>
		<content>   The Croft, a farm of 45 acres is    
where Jim Salt breeds his shire horses.
They are huge horses once used to pull 
ploughs but are now used for showing,  
pulling dreys, wagons for advertising. 
He has 6 stallions and 2 mares of whom 
Cubley Charlie is a great champion. He 
weighs 1 ton 2 cwts. and is l8 hands   
tall. He eats 4 buckets of bran and    
corn and a bale of hay each day. He is 
such an exceptional horse that many    
breeders send their mares for him to   
sire their foals. The Quixhill name    
is his own and very famous. 42 mares   
come to the 6 stallions each year and  
stay for 2\3 weeks. The pregnancy lasts
ll months. The foals weigh 2 cwt. when 
they are born. After 5 days the        
stallion is put to the mare again so   
she can produce a foal the next year.  
They can be sold for a great deal of   
money and many are exported.           </content>
