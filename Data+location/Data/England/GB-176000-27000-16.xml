		<content> My typical{school}day begins at 7.30.I
 get my own{breakfast}something simple 
 and quick like cereal.I get ready and 
 Mrs Richards drives me to school with 
 Steven. School begins at 9:00. In the 
 morning we have Maths or English on   
 Wednesdays. We go to Truro swimming   
 pool which is 13 miles away. School   
{dinner}is at 12 o'clock. My favourite 
 is roast or stew with chocolate       
 eclairs or mint slice. Half of the    
 children bring pack lunch. At 1:15 we 
 have Topic Work or Craft, then games  
 or Music. Play is at 2:15 to 2:30.At  
 play time the girls play handstands or
 just walk around and chat. The boys   
 always play football. School finishes 
 at 3:30. I go home and watch T.V and  
 argue with my brother. Sometimes I    
 have a friend to play, we ride on our 
 bikes or on our roller boots. I live 4
 miles from my friends.                </content>
