		<content> Marley Tiles has produced tiles since 
 1953. The factory produces 95 tiles a 
 minute which is 15 million tiles per  
 year.                                 
     The raw materials are a special   
 grade of sand called sharp sand from  
 Cumbria and Ebchester,cement from     
 Eastgate,colour from Germany (Beyers) 
 and water from the mains.These are    
 mixed and become wet morter.This is   
 then put into pallets,chopped,dried   
 and stacked.This occurs on a conveyor 
 belt and is a continuous process.The  
 four basic tile designs are Bold      
 roll,Mendip,Wessex and Modern.All the 
 tiles are sold within 40miles of the  
 factory and are transported by        
 road.The employees live locally,66    
 work in the factory,15 drive wagons   
 and 39 are staff in the office.
