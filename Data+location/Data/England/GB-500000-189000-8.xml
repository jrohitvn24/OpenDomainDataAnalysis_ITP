		<title>08The Chalfont St.Peter Church</title>
		<content>   I am doing a survey on the Chalfont 
St.Peter Church and the kind of changes
that have been made.                   
{Local History}  The Church first      
known in 1196 fell down in a storm in  
1708.It was built again and the        
present church was opened in 1714.     
{Changing Times}  In the last ten years
there seems to be a larger congregation
and younger people attend especially   
the communion.Also nearly all the      
testaments are new and the prayer books
seem to be more modern.                
{Religion} Every religion was alowed in
the church even if the people weren't  
Church of England as it is today.      
{Events}  There is a summer fete which 
both the school do next door and the   
church,there is a Christmas Bazar and  
also a womans institute.               
                                       
                                       </content>
