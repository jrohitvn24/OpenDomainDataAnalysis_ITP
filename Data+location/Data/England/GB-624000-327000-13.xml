		<title>13THE POTTERY IN FELMINGHAM</title>
		<content> Belaugh Pottery in Church Road was    
 opened in 1975, in a building that was
 originally part of the King's Head    
 Public House (closed in l950).        
 Over the years this building had been 
 put to many uses as diverse as cycle  
 repairs, shoe mending, wedding        
 receptions, and, during the Second    
 World War, Home Guard Training.       
 Today it houses the pottery workshop  
 as well as living accomodation; and   
 produces handthrown stoneware pottery 
 which is sold through outlets in this 
 country and world wide; as well as in 
 the pottery's own shop.
