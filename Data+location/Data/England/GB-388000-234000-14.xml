{EXTRACT, A.G.M.Jan.1985:}Lighting and 
 power have been installed in the      
 belfry. The clappers need replacing.  
 Work is in hand to deflect the sound  
 over a wider area. The captain was    
 pleased at the progress of the band.  
 We have 4 Stedman ringers but rely on 
 visitors to ring this and Minor.      
 Our first Tower Outing ever is on     
 Feb. 23rd to Kempsey, Powick, St.Johns
 Worcester, and  Earls Croome.{
