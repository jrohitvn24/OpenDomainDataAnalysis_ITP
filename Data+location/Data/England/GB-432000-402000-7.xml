		<content>{PEGS:}To play pegs you need two teams 
 each with the same number of people.  
 You lean three pegs against a wall    
 with another peg across the top of the
 other three.  The captains of both of 
 the teams try to knock the  pegs      
 down with the tennis ball.  The first 
 captain to do this, his team goes     
 first.  They take it in turns to throw
 the ball at the pegs and if they knock
 the pegs down and the fielding team   
 catch the ball without it bouncing on 
 the floor, the team who were throwing 
 are out.  If they knock all the pegs  
 down they have to try and put the pegs
 back up again as quick as they can.   
 If the fielding team gets the ball and
 throws it at the person who is putting
 the pegs up and it hits them the      
 throwing team is out.  When the       
 throwing team is out the fielding team
 have their turn to throw.             </content>
