		<title>09EGGINTON CHURCH</title>
		<content>   Egginton Church was built in 1290   
 and the first Rector was John Hebto.  
 The church used to have a steeple but 
 now only has a tower. The oldest      
 grave is dated 1715, and the newest is
 1984.                                 
 The path leading up to the Church     
 is in memory of Mr. Archer, a great   
 Christian. The tower is about 12m tall
 and the main part is 8m tall. There   
 are several trees leading up to the   
 Church,some are Maple and some are    
 Lime.There are about 250 grave stones 
 in the Church yard. The Oil lamp still
 works but is only connected to gas at 
 Christmas. The architecture of the    
 church is old English, except for the 
 tower which is Norman.
