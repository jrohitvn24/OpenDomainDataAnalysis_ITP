		<content>   Mr Bilkey, born July 21st 1907,     
 lived at Lower Boskenwyn Farm with one
 brother and one sister until 1972.The 
 farmhouse, built of stone with a      
 Delabole Slate roof in about 1850, is 
 half a  mile from Boskenwyn C.P.      
 school.The main  crops were grass,    
 dredge corn and straw for thatching.  
 They kept South  Devon cows and the   
 machinery  was drawn by  Shire        
 Horses.  Mr.Bilkey started  school in 
 1913. Teachers and children  walked to
 school. The boys wore jerseys and     
 boots and the girls wore white        
 pinafores and had long hair tied with 
 ribbons.There were between 70_100     
 pupils in three classes:reception and 
 lower juniors in what are now the     
 kitchen and resources area, and top   
 juniors in the big classroom. There   
 were black stoves in the junior rooms 
 and an open fire in the infants.      </content>
