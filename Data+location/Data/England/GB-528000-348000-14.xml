		<title>14Entertainment, Gipsey Bridge</title>
		<content>      The following information was    
                                       
 taken from a survey carried out by us 
 in the village of Gipsey Bridge.      
      Most of the entertainment in the 
 village takes place in the home where 
 people read or watch television.They  
 like most of all reading history books
 and watching quiz programmes on the   
 television.                           
            When they do leave the home
 they go for walks and think that there
 should be more walks here.Most people 
 think that there should be  better    
 public transport and more places for  
 young people to go out.               
            It is too far for the      
 people of this area to go out to the  
 theatre  or to a sports club but they 
 do go to the pubs.
