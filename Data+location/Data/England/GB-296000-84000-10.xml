		<title>10Marine Training Camp.</title>
		<content>The Commando Training centre Royal     
Marines lies between Exton and         
Lympstone on a large area of land      
between the main road and the estuary. 
It is the country's main training      
centre for Marines,the fighting        
section of the Navy.Recruits are taken 
at 16-17 years old and the rigorous    
course lasts 10 weeks.The emphasis is  
on discipline and physical fitness and 
only the best suited survive;40% drop  
out by the end of 10 weeks.The camp was
only a small collection of wooden huts 
in 1963 but now is a large,almost self 
contained communtiy with a church,     
medical unit,dentist and railway       
station.Qualified Marines move onto a  
commando unit elsewhere in Britain and 
and will specialise in a chosen skill  
(like cook or mechanic)so as to gain   
qualifications for later life.
