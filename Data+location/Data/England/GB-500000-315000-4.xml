		<content> Holywell is a scattered settlement in 
 a picturesque setting. The parkland of
 Holywell Hall (itself just outside our
 block), grazed by sheep and Canada    
 geese, slopes down to a group of three
 small lakes. Two, within the grounds  
 of the Hall, are ornamental; the third
 is an old mill pond overgrown with    
 willows and alders.                   
 An attractively situated stone house  
 overlooks the middle lake. Downstream 
 is a stone-built farmhouse, recently  
 much restored, with several new farm  
 buildings. A hilltop farm is now a    
 private house, though its buildings   
 are still used. Two isolated stone    
 cottages were converted into one house
 about eight years ago after being used
 as farm buildings. The rough track to 
 another isolated house (originally    
 kennels) was recently resurfaced with 
 crushed stone.                        </content>
