		<title>13Games Children Play</title>
		<content> My favourite game is climbing trees.  
 When my cousin comes to stay we have a
 great time finding trees to climb.Most
 boys of my age have gone crazy about  
 football and transformers.These are   
 plastic toy cars which can change into
 robots.In the Autumn children like to 
 play conkers. The girls are always    
 skipping in groups or just on their   
 own. Red Rover is a game where one boy
 tries to run through a line of boys   
 without being caught. Games at        
 school are 'Sticky Toffee', 'Tag'     
 'Rabbit Run' and 'Run Away Train'.    
 These are all chasing games.Boys also 
 like to make 'Go-carts' out of old    
 pram wheels and bits of wood.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
