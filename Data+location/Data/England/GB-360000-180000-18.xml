		<title>18CHANGING TIMES-PATCHWAY EAST</title>
		<content>    Joanne spoke to a lady who is 85   
 and has lived in Patchway all her     
 life. She rmembers when it was all    
 fields.                               
    As a housewife she had no modern   
 gadgets. To clean her{carpets}she used
 a broom and tea leaves. She put it    
 on the line and beat it with a carpet 
 beater made of cane.{Clothes}were     
 washed in the bath with soap and a    
 rubbing board.{Meals}were cooked on   
 open fire ranges.                     
{ Light}in the house was by paraffin   
 lamps which had large brass bases.    
{Coal}was delivered at 14lbs.for 1d.   
{Milk}was bought from the milkman who  
 pushed a two wheeled barrow which held
 a churn of milk. In those days 10p    
 filled the cupboard with food.        
{ Travel}was by hansom cab or in a     
 horse drawn bus.                      
                                       </content>
