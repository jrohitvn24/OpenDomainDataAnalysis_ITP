		<title>10EMPLOYMENT IN PANTON</title>
		<content> The workforce of {PANTON }consists of 
 47 adults. There are l2 adults who    
 live and work in the square of whom   
 9 are employed solely in agriculture. 
 These are all male. Of the remaining  
 35, l9 are women who do not work out- 
 side the home. Of the remaining l6, 8 
 work outside the square in local towns
 and 8 are either self-employed or un- 
 employed. Because of the lack of      
 public transport those unemployed and 
 without personal transport would find 
 it almost impossible to travel outside
 the area to work. Unemployment is a   
 very big social problem in the country
 as a whole at present and living in a 
 rural area these problems are exacer- 
 bated. One resident is attempting to  
 set up a sewing workshop. Six women   
 are employed machining high quality   
 dresses to sell in London but this is 
 a very new enterprise of a few months.</content>
