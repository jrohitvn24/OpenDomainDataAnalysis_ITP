		<content>Because of its situation there is a    
need in the area for a number of       
different mobile services supplying a  
variety of goods not otherwise easily  
obtainable.  Public transport is sparse
and expensive and small shops carry    
only limited stock.  Milk is delivered 
6 days a week and the dairy also offers
fruit juice, eggs, potatoes and bread. 
A bread round on 3 days a week also    
supplies biscuits, pies and crisps.    
Three butchers and a fishmonger call   
weekly as do a mobile library and a    
caravan selling wool, knitting-patterns
and needles.  Twice weekly a fish and  
chip van calls.  Hairdressing can be   
arranged at your home.  A grocery bus  
and a grocery van come weekly.  Beer   
and soft drinks can be left on your    
doorstep.
