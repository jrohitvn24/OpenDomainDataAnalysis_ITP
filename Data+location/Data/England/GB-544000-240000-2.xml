		<content> Farming is mainly arable _ barley,    
 wheat with a little oats, sugar beet  
 and break crops of peas, beans and    
 vetches with grass for grazing.  Most 
 fields are between 30 and 40 acres,   
 bounded by roads or hedges.  There are
 3 small herds of cattle for fattening 
 and  1 of Jersey cows.  Sheep numbers 
 are declining due to lack of special- 
 ised labour although 2 farmers have   
 small flocks and 1 has a larger flock 
 of fat lambs.  3 farms are about 300  
 acres and 3 farms are over 600 acres. 
 5 are mainly family concerns, 1 farmer
 lives outside the area and manages it 
 with other land.  There is an inten-  
 sive egg farm.
