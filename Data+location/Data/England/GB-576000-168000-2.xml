		<content> EID is a religious festival. It is    
 celebrated just like christmas.       
 We have two festivals one is  large   
 and one small. The small is after the 
 month of Romadon (Fasting). This is   
 when we are not allowed to eat for a  
 period of time example (2.am to       
 9.pm).                                
 The second one is the large one and it
 is celebrated because of a true       
 story;Prophet Ibraham (who made the   
 great home of Allah in Mecca)had a    
 dream to cut his son to pieces and    
 give them to friends poor and rich who
 believe in Allah. He was about to do  
 this when Allah sent an angel who said
 to him "Don't, instead cut a lamb and 
 give that away", so he did.  To show  
 his pleasure he set a feast for       
 everyone and now everyone sets a feast
 and gives lambs away.
