		<title>02Kielder Water: the dam</title>
		<content> The great dam at the southern-eastern 
 end of Kielder Water was built        
 principally of{boulder clay}: some 5.3
 million cubic yards. Close to the     
 northern end of the dam is the        
{draw-off tower,}which is some 212 feet
 high, and also at the northern end of 
 the dam is a 200 yard long{overflow   
{weir.}Whenever the reservoir reaches  
 capacity level this overflow allows   
 water to flow off into a stilling     
 basin at the foot of the dam and from 
 there into the{North Tyne.}These      
 overflow works have been designed to  
 cope with double the worst combination
 of flood conditions ever known to have
 occurred.                             
 Hydro-electricity from the dam        
 installation is now being fed into the
 National Grid of the Central          
 Electricity Generating Board.
