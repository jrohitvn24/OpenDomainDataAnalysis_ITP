		<title>14My Home on Sunday.</title>
		<content>   It was morning. I got out of bed and
 I remembered last Sunday when I went  
 netball with my Mum. It was bright and
 sunny.I went downstairs and said      
 "Shall I feed the cat?" "No," said Mum
 "she's been fed." " COME ON DAD!."    
 Dad came. Remember last Sunday? "Yeah"
 said Daniel. "Good wasn't it?"        
   I ate my breakfast and then got     
 dressed. I played a game with Daniel  
 giving piggy-backs but he was ever so 
 heavy and I soon got tired,so we went 
 out to play 'WAR'. We played our War  
 and I gave in."Hurray" shouted Daniel,
 "I won!".                             
 Some friends came to play rounders and
 I scored 7. It was time for tea. We   
 looked at T.V. but is was boring so we
 went outside to play French cricket.  
 "'Bye" said our friends, "thanks for  
 tea." I got ready for bed. I think it 
 has been even better than last Sunday.</content>
