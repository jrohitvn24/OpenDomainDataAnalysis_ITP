		<content>    Some of the oldest rocks in the    
 country lie around Church Stretton.   
 They were formed from a period between
{800 and 900 million years ago.}Most   
 hills are of different types of rock. 
    Church Stretton lies in a valley   
 between the hills of the Long Mynd,   
 Caer Caradoc, The Lawley, Helmeth,    
 Hazler and Ragleth. The valley follows
 a big fault called The Church Stretton
 Fault.                                
    Some hills like the Caradoc and    
 Ragleth are the oldest rock in the    
 valley. They were formed by lava. But 
 neither of these hills was a volcano. 
 They are made of rocks and ashes.     
    The Long Mynd is mainly sedimentary
 rock consisting mainly of shales and  
 sandstones.
