 active in Pembury. As many as 55 are  
 listed in the village news letter and 
 in the library. These include the     
{Horticultural Society, the Darby and  
{Joan Club, the Women's Institute}and  
 many others.                          
  The{WRVS}are now in their third year.
 Every Wednesday between 24 and 30     
 elderly or disabled people are served 
 with lunch in the village hall. They  
 also run a meals on wheels service,   
 taking dinners from the school kitchen
 to the people's homes.                
  The{Pembury footpath walkers}are     
 active, with a monthly walk. Their    
 last walk was a 10 mile hike to       
 Brenchley. The{Pembury Society}and the
{Parish council}have been active       
 encouraging the way-marking and       
 clearing of many footpaths.
