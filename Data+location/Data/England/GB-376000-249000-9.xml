		<title>09A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LOUISE</title>
		<content> I get up in the morning and have my   
 breakfast and then my sister goes off 
 to catch her school bus.Sometimes my  
 Mum leaves the house with me to go to 
 work and sometimes I walk to school on
 my own.It is my job to unlock the many
 doors of our school building.I also   
 have to unlock some gates in the      
 playground.After our assembly we have 
 our first lessons.Usually in the      
 morning we have number work and       
 English and French.In the afternoon we
 have Topic work,Games,Art and Craft   
 and Music.At playtimes I usually play 
 with Tracy and we play dancing games  
 or we practise netball.At lunchtime we
 all have sandwiches and then have our 
 long playtime.At 3.30 school finishes 
 and I go home.I play with my sister   
 and we go to the village shop to get  
 some shopping for my Mum.After I have 
 watched T.V.I go to bed at 8.30.      </content>
