		<content> I AWOKE, THREW OFF MY CONTINENTAL     
 QUILT AND STAGGERED INTO THE BATHROOM 
 TO USE THE NEW{"AQUAFRESH 3"          
 TOOTHPASTE. I PUT ON MY NEWLY WASHED  
 JEANS AND A T-SHIRT AND WENT BACK INTO
 MY BEDROOM. I SWITCHED ON MY STEREO   
 HI-FI AND TUNED INTO RADIO 1 WHICH WAS
 BROADCASTING THE WEATHER FORECAST. I  
 DECIDED I WOULD PREFER TO WATCH       
 TELEVISION SO I UNPLUGGED THE HI-FI.  
 JUST AS I WAS WATCHING A CARTOON THE  
 PHONE RANG SO I TURNED OFF THE SET    
 USING THE REMOTE CONTROL AND PICKED UP
 THE TELEPHONE TO TALK TO MY FRIEND    
 ELESE. AS THE PHONE WAS CORDLESS I    
 TOOK IT DOWNSTAIRS. IT TOOK ME TWO    
 MINUTES TO MAKE TOAST AND BUTTER FOR  
 BREAKFAST. I PUT THE PHONE DOWN ON THE
 VIDEO AND SLUMPED ONTO THE SETTEE. THE
 DOORBELL RANG AND ELESE CAME IN. IT   
 HAD NOT TAKEN HER LONG TO ARRIVE. WE  
 WOULD SPEND SATURDAY TOGETHER.        </content>
