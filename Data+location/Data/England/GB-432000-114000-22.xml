<title>22Calmore Junior School</title>
<content>

Calmore Junior School is one of three main schools catering for this age group, taking in children in Years 3 to 6 and aged between 7 and 11 years old. The school was recently refurbished to provide bigger classrooms and fewer classes themselves. The school takes about 230 children every year. School starts at 8.30am each day and finishes as 3.00pm each day, with a 15 minute morning break and an hour lunch break starting at 11.30am. Uniform includes a navy blue jumper or cardigan with the school logo alongside a white or light blue polo shirt and grey or black trousers or skirt. Shorts and checked blue and white dresses are worn for summer. The children mostly eat the school dinners, or from packed lunches. Lots of sports are run outside of school with some being run through the School Sport Partnership in the area.   &lt;br />
