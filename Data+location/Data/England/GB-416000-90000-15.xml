		<title>15The Priory Church</title>
		<content> Much to the surprise of visitors to   
 the Priory,it is today,as it was in   
 the middle ages,a thriving Parish     
 Church,at the very heart of the local 
 community.                            
 In social terms,it possesses the usual
 range of Church organisations,        
 bellringers,choristers,mission groups,
 sick visitors and a veritable army of 
 volunteer cleaners,the'holy dusters'  
 as they are known.On the electoral    
 roll there are well over 1000 names,  
 many of them from many miles away,such
 is the pull of the place.The Priory   
 has a reputation for fine music and is
 very popular for weddings. The        
 building provides the perfect setting 
 for major services such as Remembrance
 Sunday but the highspot of the year is
 undoubtedly the Christmas Eve Midnight
 Communion when 1400 people literally  
 pack themselves in the Church.        </content>
