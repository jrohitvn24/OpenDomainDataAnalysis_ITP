		<title>09GOLF, LITTLE WALTHAM</title>
		<content> Channels Golf Club is situated on the 
 outskirts of Little Waltham.The       
 original 9 hole course, opened in 1974
 was constructed on what had been      
 Channels Farm. An additional 9 holes  
 were added in 1978 extending the      
 course over disused gravel workings.  
 The irregular features of the old     
 gravel pits provide an undulating     
 surface.                              
 The farm house, part of which dates   
 from the 14th. and 17th. centuries,   
 has been renovated to provide a club  
 house. Adjacent to the club house is a
 large barn, that has been restored,   
 and is used both for club and private 
 functions.The stable block has also   
 been put to good use, and houses a    
 shop and offices.                     
 There are 640 members of various      
 categories,and some block             
 memberships.                          </content>
