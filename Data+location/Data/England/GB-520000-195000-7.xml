		<content> We went out and made a count of all   
 the pubs in 4 square kilometres. We   
 found 8 altogether. The manager of the
 'Mops and Brooms' at Well End became  
 very interested in what we were doing 
 and said that if we went the next day 
 he would talk to us. We went and he   
 gave us drinks and crisps. He told us 
 that the pub was first known as 'The  
 Lord Nelson' until it moved to a new  
 site in 1915. The original 'Lord      
 Nelson' was housed in the white       
 cottage next door. The name 'Mops and 
 Brooms' came from a competition to    
 name the pub. The winning story told  
 of a batle between gypsies using mops 
 and factory workers using brooms as   
 weapons. A lot of people think the    
 story is true but it isn't.
