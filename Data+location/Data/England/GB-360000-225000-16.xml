 Mr Malson told us in 1953 there was a 
 party when the Queen was crowned. The 
 party lasted 2\ hours and they had a  
 good meal and lots of beer.Mr Malsom  
 used to work at Townsend Farm he was  
 a shepherd.In that farm there were 15 
 horses to plough the fields and 1     
 tractor.When Mr Malson came to live in
 the village with his sister at first, 
 but then got married later.There also 
 was a policeman who used to ride a    
 bike around Brampton.Mr Malson told us
 more or less the same as Miss Keen.
