		<content>The day begins at 6am.After breakfast  
sick parade is held followed by drill, 
lessons on subjects like map skills,P.T
in the gym and weapon training.Lunch is
at 12.35,then they may go to Woodbury  
Common to learn the use of guns of all 
types and field combat.Larger exercises
take place on Dartmoor.The day is hard 
and organised with frequent endurance  
tests to be passed at each stage;for   
example,a Tarzan course across some    
apparatus,and a climb up a 30ft rope   
whilst wearing full kit weighing 40lb. 
After 16.30,their time is their own but
there is kit to be looked after and    
dormitories which are shared between 5 
people to be kept clean.The aim is to  
gain the green beret and to pass out at
the Kings Squad Parade,a well earned   
reward after a hard 10 weeks.
