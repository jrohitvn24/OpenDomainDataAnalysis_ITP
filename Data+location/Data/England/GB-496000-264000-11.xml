		<title>11 Newton Road Junior School</title>
		<content>  When the school was first opened in  
1894 it soon grew in size to over 600  
pupils (2 classes used the hall).      
Log and punishment books were kept,    
they can still be read and are still   
kept up-to-date.                       
  The school is a large brick building,
decorated with beautiful Victorian,    
patterned tiles.                       
  In 1982 the bell tower was restored  
and the bell rung after many silent    
years, it is rung regularly to start   
school today.                          
  In 1982 the school was modernised.   
Ceilings(false) have been lowered to   
save heating costs. A secretary's room 
has been built from an old cloakroom.  
The old staff room is now a library, a 
staff room was made from an upstairs   
classroom. 2 other rooms now open onto 
a wet area. Their small playground has 
outside toilets. They have no field.   </content>
