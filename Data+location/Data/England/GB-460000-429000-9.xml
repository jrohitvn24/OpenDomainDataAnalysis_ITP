		<title>09SELBY RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> The{Railway Station}was built over 100
 years ago. It was the main line for 60
 years until a new one was built. There
 are 19{level crossings}in the Selby   
 District area. About 60 years ago the{
{Flying Scotsman}came into the station 
 so fast that it killed a workman. 18  
 people work in{Selby Station.}They    
 used to work 8 hours a day but they   
 are now working 12 because they are   
 short of staff. We went onto the{swing
{bridge}that crosses the river. We were
 told that we were the first children  
 to go over it. The bridge is very     
 dangerous because if you had loose    
 clothing on (like dresses or skirts   
 etc.) and the train caught your       
 clothes you would be dragged along and
 killed. There is a box which works the
 bridge. The people who work it work 24
 hours a day every day in shifts (apart
 from Xmas.)                           </content>
