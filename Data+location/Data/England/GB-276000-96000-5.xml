		<title>05SEWAGE WORKS,Yeoford area.</title>
		<content>{Yeoford}sewage works is a little way  
 away from{Yeoford.}All the machines   
 there are worked by electricity, which
 is quite unusual because most machines
 at sewage works are worked by water.  
 First, the sewage is put into a       
 machine which cleans out all the      
 things that shouldn't be there. Then  
 it runs into a kind of round swimming 
 pool, which has a machine arm that    
 goes round and clears all the dirt    
 from the surface of the water. Then it
 runs into the edge of a kind of big   
 swimming pool full of stones. The     
 stones were small on top and got      
 bigger as you dug down. It is then    
 sprinkled onto the stones and all     
 the dirty water stays on the stones,  
 while all the cleaner water comes out 
 of drains.This runs into the{River    
{Yeo.}There is going to be a supply of 
 clean water to be used in a drought.  </content>
