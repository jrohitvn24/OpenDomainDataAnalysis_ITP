		<content> As elsewhere in the southern Lake     
 District, the farming economy is based
 on sheep and cattle. In recent years, 
 several farms have been amalgamated so
 that now, there are only two farms    
 within the survey area, although quite
 a lot of land is owned by Kentmere    
 Hall which  lies just beyond it to the
 north. (Most of the former farm       
 buildings have been converted in to   
 private homes). The majority of the   
 sheep are Swaledale or "Swaleys" and  
 Herdwick, with some Rough Fell. Cattle
 are mostly Friesian store cattle.     
 As far as possible, hay and silage for
 winter fodder is provided off the farm
 but a major proportion of the survey  
 area is rough grazing so shortages do 
 occur, especially when the summer is  
 poor.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
