		<content>{Ilkeston Swimming Baths}is open to the
 public and many clubs. It is also open
 to schools on week days. There are    
 three pools, a{diving pool,}a{learner 
{pool}and a{main pool.}The is a        
{cafeteria}upstairs where you can buy  
 refreshments. Here is one girl's view 
 of the club.                          
{Ilkeston Swimming Club}is where       
 children or even adults learn to{swim,
{dive,play water polo}and many other   
{water sports.}It is great fun because 
 when you can swim the coaches pick you
 for{galas}and you travel all over the 
 country. If you cannot swim you start 
 in the teaching pool where you learn  
 to swim a width and gradually progress
 to the main pool. We train 5 nights a 
 week. On Sunday night there is a      
 special training session for the A    
 team but it is very hard work. However
 I enjoy it so much I don't complain.  </content>
