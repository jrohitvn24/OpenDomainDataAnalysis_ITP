 A fishing licence is needed before you
 can fish the well-stocked waters of   
 the reservoir.This may be purchased   
 from the 'New Napoleon' which is the  
 public house overlooking the          
 reservoir. A day licence is quite     
 costly at approximately Â£12. There are
 good stocks of trout in the waters.

{ Birdwatching                         
 The reservoir is extremely popular    
 with keen birdwatchers, as this       
 scenic, sheltered area attracts many  
 species of bird, both common and      
 rare.                                 
  There are hides along the water's    
 edge so the birds can be watched      
 without being alarmed. Birds seen     
 include coot, great crested grebe,    
 heron and kingfisher.
