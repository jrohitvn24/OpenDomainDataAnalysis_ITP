		<content> This area has never been densely      
 populated. Now, only three farms are  
 inhabited.                            
 The reason for the decline in         
 population is the inaccessibility of  
 the farms in relation to the          
 surrounding villages. Schools are     
 closing in the villages themselves and
 children have to travel to the nearby 
 towns to be educated, and also for    
 entertainment.                        
 The large arable farms mean fewer farm
 workers are required due to           
 mechanisation and low wages mean jobs 
 are sought elsewhere.                 
 Many of the remaining workers are     
 elderly and may leave the area on     
 retirement.
