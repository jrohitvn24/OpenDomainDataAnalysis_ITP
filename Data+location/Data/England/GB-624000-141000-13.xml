		<title>13MARKET GARDENING IN ALKHAM.</title>
		<content>  To the south west of Alkham lies     
 Upton Farm in the hamlet of South     
 Alkham.The farm has developed into    
 quite a large farm shop selling both  
 produce fresh from the fields and that
 which has been brought into the       
 area.Strawberries,raspberries and     
 blackcurrants are grown and during the
 harvesting season the fields are open 
 for "pick your own".Part-time pickers 
 are also employed during the picking  
 season.They also sell eggs which are  
 free range from their own farm and    
 this year they had a stall at the     
 County Show at Detling near Maidstone.
 Mr.W.Wenham,the milkman and general   
 grocery deliverer,also sell their eggs
 on his rounds.The shop which is open 7
 days a week also sells jams,sweets,   
 ice-creams, gifts, pot plants, bedding
 plants and stone garden furniture.
