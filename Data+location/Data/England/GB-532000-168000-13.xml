		<content>   In one of the squares that we studed
 there is a large area of derelict land
 This land is just north of the border 
 between Croydon and Bromley, near     
 Elmers End Station.We found that it   
 used to be the site of a sewage farm. 
   The Land here is very uneven and    
 there are drainage pipes sticking up  
 out of the ground. There are footpaths
 to follow across the land.            
   In one place there was a group of   
 gipsies. Around this site were lots of
 bits of old cars. Shortley after our  
 first survey the gipsies moved away.  
   We found lots of plants which were  
 typical of those found on wasteland,  
 beds of nettles, shephered's purse,   
 cow-parsley, hog-weed, charlock and   
 cleavers.                             
   We saw red admiral butterflies and a
 variety of birds;crows, magpies,      
 starlings, blackbirds, and thrushes.  </content>
