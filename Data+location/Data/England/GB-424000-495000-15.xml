 an enthusiastic group of local        
 amateurs who have at least two

 of people of all ages and include     
 children as young as ten years.       
 The productions include singing,      
 dancing,drama,and humour.The latest   
 production was the pantomime "Ali Ba  
 Ba and the Forty Robbers".This was    
 performed in the Booth Memorial Hall  
 on two evenings during the 1985       
 October half term holidays.Both       
 performances were well attended and   
 refreshments were served.             
 The profits made by the Theatre       
 Company are shared amongst village    
 organisations.
