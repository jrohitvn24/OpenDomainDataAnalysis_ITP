		<title>04'City of Cardiff', Nanjizel.</title>
		<content> In 1912 the steamer 'City of Cardiff' 
 lost her rudder in a storm whilst     
 rounding Land's End. She drifted onto 
 the sandbar in Nanjizel and eventually
 against the cliffs at the north end of
 the bay.{The crew were rescued by     
{rocket life-saving apparatus and a    
{breeches buoy.}Eventually much of the 
 ship was broken up and taken away     
 using steam wagons. Evidence of where 
 the blocks and tackle were anchored   
 can still be seen in the cliff side   
 along the present coastal footpath. At
 spring low tide,{two boilers of the   
{ship were visible until recently,}but 
 now only one can still be seen.{(photo
{C).}It is thought a salvage vessel    
 working on another wreck, possibly the
 steamer 'Balbec', wrecked one hundred 
 years ago in 1884, which became       
 visible on the bar in 1984, may have  
 disturbed the other boiler.           </content>
