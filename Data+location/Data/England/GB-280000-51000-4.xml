 with her father. Her{father}was a     
{farmer.}When they knew that every body
 had to move out of their houses the   
 first thing they had to do was to{find
{some where}to stay.He went to Rowden  
 farm near Widdicombe and also         
 Bittaford.And he{bought one house and}
{rented the other.}Once they found some
 where to go,they had to{thresh}the    
 corn,{bail}the hay and all the turnips
 had to be pulled up.And just before   
 they moved out they had to get all of 
 their furniture out. When they were   
 moving out they had{sailors}and{one}  
{land army girl}to help.At that time   
 they all had{identity}cards.And where 
 ever they went they had to take them  
 with because if they were stopped by  
 the{soldiers}or{home guards.}There    
 were soldiers with mules at Pitt Farm 
 and East Allington. ..                </content>
