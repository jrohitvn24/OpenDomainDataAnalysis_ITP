		<content> Rev. Grahame Smith and his family have
 lived in the modern rectory next to   
 the church since 1976.He holds a      
 service in most of his 5 churches in  
 this area each Sunday. Uffington has  
 no choir and the average congregation 
 numbers twenty.Sunday school is held  
 weekly and the bell ringers practice  
 twice a week. There are about three   
 each of weddings, christenings and    
 funerals each year. As the church-yard
 is almost full,cremations are often   
 held at Marholm. Tombstones must be   
 made of stone,small with no curbstones
 for easier churchyard maintenance.    
 Church repairs are often done freely  
 by local craftsmen helped by Man Power
 Services. Various fund-raising        
 activities take place. In 1984 a new  
 heating system was installed costing  
 Â£6000 and a Christian Stewardship     
 Campaign took place to covenant funds.</content>
