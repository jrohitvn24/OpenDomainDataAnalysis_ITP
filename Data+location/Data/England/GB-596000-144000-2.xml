		<content> The major social concern for most of  
 the area is the imminent extention of 
 the{M20 Motor-way}which, whilst the   
 line has not been announced it is     
 accepted by the locals, as running    
 from it's existing end in square 00 44
 along the N.E. side and within 150    
 metres of the railway line then turn  
 east under the railway at Tutt Hill,  
 where a bridge to carry the railway is
 at present under construction. The    
 motor-way will then cross the{A20}and 
 swing N.W. passing to the west of     
 Charing.                              
                                       
 During interviews with local people   
 most said they favoured the motor-way,
 including a farmer who is losing some 
 fourty acres of land, because "it will
 make the A20 a safer road".
