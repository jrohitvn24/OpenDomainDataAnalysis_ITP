		<title>08THE KINGSCLERE STREAM</title>
		<content>  The Kingsclere stream starts at the  
 foot of the Downs where little springs
 bubble out of the ground. Then it     
 makes a lake. At the end two streams  
 flow out. One goes to a disused mill  
 called Gailey mill; the water is very 
 clear here. Then this joins the main  
 stream. Then the stream goes under a  
 road. A lot of ducks swim there, and  
 many people bring their children to   
 feed them. This place is known as 'the
 Ducks.' The stream flows through the  
 village and behind the church. Here   
 there is a lake with a bridge and a   
 footpath. In the lake is an island    
 where the ducks make their nests. In  
 spring thousands of snowdrops grow on 
 the island. Then the stream flows     
 through a disused mill, and through   
 some meadows. There were four mills   
 for grinding corn. My brother caught a
 trout, and I have seen kingfishers.   </content>
