		<content> During the summer the cows go out in  
 the fields.  The work is quite easy   
 then although it is busy when we are  
 making{silage.                        
                                       
 In the summer we cut the grass, which 
 is chopped and brought into the silage
 pit.  The grass is rolled and then    
 covered.  It sort of ferments during  
 the summer and is ready for feeding to
 the cows the following winter.        
                                       
 In the winter the cows are confined to
 the yard area.  They are fed with     
 silage and milled food concentrate    
 twice a day.  Every day the yard has  
 to be scraped.  As well as this Dad   
 still has to do the milking.  It is   
 very hard work.  Sometimes I help by  
 washing down the parlour after        
 milking.
