		<content>{COMMENTS ON CHANGES.                  
 a){PEOPLE. }Although people had less  
 children, and families were smaller,  
 many more houses had been built and   
 bungalows in particular. Some old     
 houses had developed serious cracks,  
 and had been knocked down and new     
 houses built instead. Many new people 
 have moved in the area from           
 towns. Most settle in very well, but  
 some find it too lonely and leave .   
 Some buildings have vanished from the 
 village, for example two pubs and the 
 Methodist Chapel.                     
 b){FACILITIES.}Although the village   
 shop is now much bigger and stocks    
 almost all everyday needs, there used 
 to be three shops here. Public        
 transport is much as it has always    
 been - very poor. Most people cycled  
 everywhere until cars became popular.
