		<content> The road from{Ferndown}to{West Moors, 
 runs between a country setting of     
 trees, fields and widely-spaced homes.
 People worry that the new{bypass}will 
 destroy the countryside, and yet it   
 is needed badly because it will take  
 heavy through traffic out of Ferndown.
 When you approach the village of West 
 Moors, you see several shops which    
 include newsagent, chemist, wool shop,
 baker, bank, grocer and also a large  
 DIY centre. These cater for the needs 
 of the population which is mainly     
 elderly.                              
 Over the years West Moors has grown   
 considerably from a village to a      
 town. There is a social club, playing 
 field, bowling green, several pubs and
 a nearby library. Several of our      
 teachers have their homes in West     
 Moors and find it a pleasant place to 
 live.                                 </content>
