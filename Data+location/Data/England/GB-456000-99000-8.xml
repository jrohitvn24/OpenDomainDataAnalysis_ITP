		<content>{   Rowner}is a parish in the borough  
 of{Gosport}situated on the south coast
 by the waters of the Solent.A large   
 proportion of the community are       
 members of{H.M.Forces,}who are        
 accomodated in married quarters.These 
 quarters are either semi-detached or  
 terraced dwellings.                   
 There are no large,enclosed parks or  
 sports grounds but there are numerous 
 play areas scattered between the      
 accommodation blocks.The large        
 population of children can therefore  
 play safely near to home.Pre-school   
 children are also well provided for   
 with several play-groups run in       
 conjunction with the Play-Group       
 Association.                          
 The Rowner Recreation Centre is       
 administered by the{Royal Navy Welfare
{Association}and offers family         
 membership-use of the pool and bar.   </content>
