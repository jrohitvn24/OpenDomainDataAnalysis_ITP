		<content> They began to sink the pit in 1917 and
 by 1923 the two main shafts had       
 reached a good seam of coal.It was a  
 modern pit producing good coal.However
 problems with strikes meant loss of   
 output often during the 1920's and    
 30's.In 1936  between September and   
 December over 62 thousand tons were   
 lost.Some miner's carried on working  
 but others went on strike and because 
 of the troubles convoys of police     
 known as chain gangs had to be drafted
 into the village.Something similar    
 happened again last year in the miners
 strike of 1984-5.The colliery was     
 privately owned until nationalization 
 in 1947 and after that time the       
 colliery continued to expand right up 
 until 1965.Now in 1985 the colliery is
 set to expand its production once     
 again.
