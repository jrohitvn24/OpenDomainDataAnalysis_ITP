 the A689 which runs from the south    
 east corner in an easterly direction, 
 are several more houses and a{factory 
 that makes steel castings.   This area
 is called Clitheroe.   Further along  
 the road is open farm land, all farms 
 are{sheep farms}with some beef and

 farmhouses and barns.                 </content>
