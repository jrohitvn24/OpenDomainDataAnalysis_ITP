		<title>13Are St Ivians RELIGIOUS?</title>
		<content> Many people in this area are          
 Christian.We asked several people     
 which religion they were.There are    
 some Anglicans, 2 Roman Catholics and 
 a Morman.                             
  Not very many people go to church but
 some people in our class would like to
 learn about Jesus and find out about  
 him. All mums and dads are the same   
 religion as their children.           
  Many people think that religion is   
 good and worth hearing about.Most     
 people go to church by car.Some people
 go to Sunday School. Most people think
 we have enough churches in this area. 
  Some types of church in this area are
 Evangelical, Free, Methodist, and     
 Jehovah Witness.                      
  In our school we don't have lessons  
 about the Bible.But we have assemblies
 about different religions throughout  
 the world.                            </content>
