		<title>11HILBRE ISLAND,THE ESTUARY.</title>
		<content>   Although the main island is out of  
 the block we felt that it was such an 
 important natural feature and facility
 that it had to be mentioned.It is one 
 of three islands,the other two being  
 known as The Middle Eye and The Little
 Eye.                                  
   The estuary of the River Dee is     
 famous for the quantity and the       
 variety of its wildlife especially the
 birdlife and Hilbre Island is one of  
 the best places for visitors to go to 
 view these birds.The island covers    
 about five acres and is a bird        
 sanctuary with a resident ranger who  
 is carrying out a number of           
 conservation projects.                
   Grey seals are also readily spotted 
 all the year round and many thousands 
 of people make the two mile walk from 
 West Kirby promenade to the island.
