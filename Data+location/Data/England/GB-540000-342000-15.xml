   The hardest carpet to clean is a    
 woollen carpet because you have to pin
 it down and put dryers underneath it  
 or else it will shrink .Other carpets 
 they hang up to dry with heaters.They 
 like the job and they wouldn't swap it
 for another one.                      
 They like doing the job because when  
 people are feeling down, because they 
 have had a fire _or a flood we go and 
 clean it up so it makes them          
 happy.They clean carpets in           
 offices,supermarkets,pubs and also    
 night clubs.
