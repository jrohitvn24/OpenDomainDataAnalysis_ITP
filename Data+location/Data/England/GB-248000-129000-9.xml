 The school building is just over 100  
 years old with an additional modern   
 classroom. At present there are just  
 over 80 children on the roll. There   
 are 3 teachers teaching the age range 
 of 5 to 11. We have a school          
 secretary, a caretaker, a cook and 2  
 kitchen assistants. The children come 
 to school from the surrounding area,  
 many of them being brought by their   
 parents in a car. There is a small    
 school field adjacent to the          
 playground and also an open air       
 swimming pool. The school has many    
 visitors. It is open from 9 o'clock   
 until half past three.
