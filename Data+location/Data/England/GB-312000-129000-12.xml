 Four miles west of the A358 is Combe  
 Florey. The village is remarkable for 
 its small sandstone church which      
 stands near the centre of the village.
                                       
 The church dates from c.1300 in its   
 oldest part, the north aisle. The     
 Norman-French inscription recording   
 the heart burial of Dame Maud de      
 Meriet, a nun of Cannington and the   
 adjoining tomb of a knight and two    
 ladies has produced a local story that
 she was the wife of Sir John de Meriet
 of Hestercombe ( d.1327 ) and that his
 attempt to get hold of his wife's     
 heart for burial outside the nunnery  
 led to his excommunication.
