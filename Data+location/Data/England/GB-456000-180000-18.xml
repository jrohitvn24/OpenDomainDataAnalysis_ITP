		<content>      Many of the{older cottages}in    
 Streatley High Street are built of    
 brick and flint which is a traditional
 building material.                    
                                       
      There is also a block of{modern  
{terraced houses}on a small estate     
 with small gardens. The houses are    
 made of brick and timber with tiled   
 roofs and look alike. They have been  
 built in the grounds of a large       
{Georgian house.                       
                                       
                                       
      The{Village Hall}is a good       
 example of brick which is arranged in 
 the{English Bond}style. It was built  
 in 1925.
