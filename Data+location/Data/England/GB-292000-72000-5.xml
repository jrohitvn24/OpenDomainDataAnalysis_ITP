		<title>05A DAY IN MUM'S LIFE</title>
		<content>   The alarm goes off at 7 am. I get   
 dressed and have a wash. Then I go    
 downstairs and make a cup of tea. I   
 get the three children up at 8 am.    
 They get dressed while I do breakfast.
 At 9 am I send two off to school. At 5
 past 9 I take the youngest to school  
 and then come back home and make beds.
 I do the dishes and fill up the       
 washing machine. I dust and hoover, go
 down town to do the shopping then come
 home to put the washing out.          
   At 12 o'clock the two youngest come 
 home for dinner. I cook them something
 to eat. I send them to school at 1 pm.
 I wash up the dinner dishes and go to 
 visit a friend for a chat and a cup of
 tea. I meet the children at school at 
 3.30 pm.                              
   I then bring in the washing and iron
 it, do the tea and wash up the dishes.
