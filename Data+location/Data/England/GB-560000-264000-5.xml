		<content> We took a random sample of people in  
our area which is centred on Exning.We 
found out that Exning is a village     
which is populated by people born in   
Suffolk and Cambridgeshire.            
 Most people have lived in Exning for  
less than 3 years.The number of people 
in each house varies,but the 2-4 range 
is the most popular.The town which     
employs the most people is Newmarket   
with the American Air-Bases second.    
 Most people own a car which they use  
to get to work.There is a small        
percentage that also have a second car.
 A high percentage of people we asked  
have retired and therefore some of the 
figures may be a little out.
