 My name is Kathryn and I am 8 years   
 old This morning I woke up at half    
 past seven. Then I woke my sister up  
 and I had a wash. Then I got dressed  
 and went downstairs for my breakfast  
 I had cornflakes and a drink of       
 coffee. Then I went upstairs and      
 cleaned my teeth and and I got my     
 pixie boots on. Then I combed my hair 
 and at quarter to nine I go to school.
 And when we come into assembly. And   
 when we come back from assembly we do 
 S.M.P.andI like S.M.P. it is my       
 favorite subgect. Then sometimes we do
 about the Normans.Then in the         
 afternoon we did about the railways   
 and then it was playtime .We played   
 outfor a bit then we came back in
