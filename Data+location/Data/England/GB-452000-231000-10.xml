		<title>10RAF CROUGHTON - US BASE 2</title>
		<content> In addition to this and three other   
 smaller units, there is also a High   
 School and Elementary/Middle School   
 for the children of US servicemen,    
 with a population of 1200 students.   
 As on all US bases, shops, clubs,     
 restaurants and churches are provided 
 at Croughton and Upper Heyford for US 
 Personnel.  They are not restricted to
 the bases, however, and 'The          
 Blackbird' public house in the village
 is well patronised, particularly at   
 lunch times.  Several children attend 
 the village playgroup, and the infant 
 class of the village school (formal   
 education does not start until six    
 years on the Base).  There are 111    
 'family housing units' on the base,   
 and dormitory accommodation for 200   
 personnel.
