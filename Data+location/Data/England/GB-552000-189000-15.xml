		<content> Hidden away between Church Road and   
 the railway embankment are two        
 industrial estates, Bates and Elms.   
 There are 83 companies employing      
 approx.1000 people, most of whom live 
 locally. The companies cover a wide   
 range of business. About 25% are      
 connected with engineering and motor  
 maintenance.Among the remainder are   
 Printers,solicitors,brick-makers,     
 furniture manufacturers,etc.          
 Most of the companies use their own   
 transport for distributing their      
 goods,being so close to the M25.It is 
 likely that more industries will be   
 attracted to the area because of this.
 At the moment not many companies      
 export their goods.But Tilbury Docks  
 are now within easy reach because of  
 the M25.
