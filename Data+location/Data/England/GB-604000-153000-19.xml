		<title>19PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content>   One of the most popular games we    
 play in the playground is Chase.There 
 is a similar game but when you are    
 caught you link hands and the two end 
 people have to catch the others. We   
 also play a game called Stuck in the  
 Mud. Somebody has to hold out their   
 hands with their fingers open and the 
 rest of the children each hold a      
 finger. The person holding out their  
 hand says any rhyme and when they say 
 "Stuck in the Mud" you must let go of 
 the persons finger and you must run   
 off. In the summer the girls like     
 skipping.We say rhymes like,"high,    
 low,swing,dolly,pepper,salt,normal,   
 scissors".In the autumn we play       
 conkers.Conkers are really horse      
 chestnuts.You put them on a string and
 try to hit the other persons conker   
 and smash it.
