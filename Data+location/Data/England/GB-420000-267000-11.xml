In Shrewley village there is a song and
dance hall, which is occasionally used.
For main activities people go to War-  
wick or Leamington, eg. cinema or      
theatre. Often people gather together  
at each others homes,exchanging jokes, 
stories,listening to music or playing  
instruments. Most stay at home to watch
television, video, play board games,   
charades, listen to the radio, sew,    
knit or read.                          
                                       
Some prefer walking or going to the    
local pub to play games like darts,    
snooker and cards. A few people go to  
Lapworth for Bingo. Kart-racing was    
one mans idea of enjoying life. Some   
families like showing their horses when
there is spare time, or teaching the   
local children how to ride. There are  
monthly cheese &amp; wine parties.         </content>
