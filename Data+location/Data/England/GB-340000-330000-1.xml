		<title>01Introduction- Colemere &amp; Lee</title>
		<content> This rural area of Shropshire consists
 principally of farmland, arable and   
 pasture.                              
                                       
 There is also a sand and gravel       
 company working a large gravel bed. We
 have several areas of woodland, both  
 mixed deciduous and conifer and some  
 fine free standing  oaks. A few very  
 old hedges remain.                    
                                       
 There are 2 small villages, Colemere  
 (434325)(pop. 65) and Lee (405324)    
 (pop. 35) as well as a number of      
 isolated farmhouses and farm cottages.
                                       
 Colemere has a stonebuilt Church      
 (438329) and Vicarage, while at Lee   
 Bridges (405316) we find a small      
 Methodist Chapel (405311) constructed 
 of timber and corrugated iron.
