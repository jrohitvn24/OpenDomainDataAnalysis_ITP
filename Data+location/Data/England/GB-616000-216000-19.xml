		<title>19Clacton Carnival Week</title>
		<content>     During Clacton Carnival Week,     
 (usually the second week of August)   
 the town is alive with people. It is  
 one of the largest carnivals in the   
 country in terms of events, and now   
 lasts about a week and a half, with   
 events on most days for some section  
 of the public.                        
    The Carnival Committee is a purely 
 charitable body who took over the     
 organization of the events over twenty
 years ago, when it comprised of a     
 procession and a fete only. Now there 
 are about fifteen different events and
 they are constantly under review.     
     The Carnival is becoming quite    
 well known over a large area, and many
 visitors book their holidays every    
 year to coincide with Carnival Week.  
     The committee tries to help one   
 main charity each year and donations  
 are given to many local charities.    </content>
