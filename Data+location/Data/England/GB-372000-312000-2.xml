		<title>02LILLESHALL CANALS</title>
		<content> The canal was once used to carry coal 
 to limekilns in{Lilleshall}and swap it
 for lime which was taken to           
{Coalbrookdale.}The canal in our block 
 is called the{Donnington Wood}canal   
 because it starts in{Donnington Wood  
 and ends in{Pave Lane.}This canal was 
 eventually closed on Christmas Day    
 1882. The people who make the boats   
 closed in February{1765 }the boats are
 really called tub boats and the canal 
 was quite shallow because the tub     
 boats have flat bottoms instead of    
 pointed bottoms so they don't need    
 very deep water to float on.
