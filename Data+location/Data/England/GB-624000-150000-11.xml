		<title>11A DAY WITH THE PARKER FAMILY</title>
		<content>  It was 07.30.hrs. in our house and   
 suddenly:"brrrrrrr!" it was my        
 sister's alarm clock. My sister       
 groaned and pressed the button.       
  I pulled the covers off and got out  
 of bed. I got washed and went         
 downstairs.Imade my packed lunch, had 
 some sugar puffs and orange juice. I  
 turned on TV_AM and watched a bit,    
 then I went back into my room and     
 brushed my teeth. I got my P.E. kit   
 ready and went off to school.         
  As soon as I got to school the bell  
 rang and everyone went in. We got our 
 A_Day Maths out"Caroline, hurry up and
 get your work out "said Mrs Paul.     
  We went into assembly where we sang a
 hymn and had a story. Back in the     
 classroom we did some more            
 maths_ALGEBRA! I sat next to Eunice   
 because we were both doing the same   
 work.                                 </content>
