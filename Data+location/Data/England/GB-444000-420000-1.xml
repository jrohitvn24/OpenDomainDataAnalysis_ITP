		<title>01The Town of Pontefract.</title>
		<content>   {Pontefract}is a very old town which
 recently celebrated the 500th         
 anniversary of the granting of the    
 Town Charter.King Richard III let the 
 town hold a market when he granted the
{Charter}and market days are still very
 important.The open air market is held 
 every Wednesday and Saturday, the     
 Market Hall is open every day except  
 Sunday.                               
    The ruins of the{Castle}are close  
 to the town centre,they are a good    
 place to explore.The{Park}is another  
 nice place to go.Horse races are      
 often held and the crowds cheer from  
 the Grandstand.There is a boating lake
 and tennis courts and plenty of open  
 grassy places for picnicing.          
    The{swimming baths}and the{library 
 are newly built.These,and the new     
 shopping precinct,where no cars are   
 allowed,make the town much nicer.     </content>
