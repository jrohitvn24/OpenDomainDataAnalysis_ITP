		<title>17Clevedon Craft Centre</title>
		<content> Clevedon Craft Centre is situated in{ 
{Moor Lane,}just south of{Clevedon     
{Court.}It is owned by{Mr and Mrs      
{Huxtable,}who used to run it as a     
 dairy farm, as their family had done  
 for many years. In{1970}the{M5}was    
 built across much of their land (and {
{Mr Huxtable}became ill), forcing them 
 to give up farming. However,{Mrs      
{Huxtable}loved the farmhouse and      
 wanted her five children to grow up   
 there. She saw an advertisement in the
{Clevedon Mercury}from a silversmith   
 requesting accomodation for his work. 
 She offered him an unused barn and    
 that was the start of the Craft Centre
 - in fact, this business is still     
 thriving there along with such arts   
 and crafts as glass blowing, diamond  
 cutting etc. When you visit, you can  
 see the crafts being demonstrated and 
 buy the produce.                      </content>
