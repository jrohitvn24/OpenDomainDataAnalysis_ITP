		<content>   On the first Saturday in July a     
 'Rose Queen Festival' is held in      
 Duddon. This event is organised       
 jointly by St.Peter's Church and      
 Duddon School and attracts many people
 from the survey area.                 
                                       
    A Rose Queen is chosen from the    
 eleven year old girls at school and a 
 procession of the Rose Queen, her     
 attendants and a page-boy takes place 
 at the start of the event. The Rose   
 Queen and her retinue from the        
 previous year are also invited to     
 attend.  The Rose Queen is crowned by 
 an invited guest.                     
                                       
     The event also includes diplays   
 from the primary children, such as    
 dancing and gymnastics.  There is also
 a wide range of sideshows and stalls .
