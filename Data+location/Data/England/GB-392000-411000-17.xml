		<title>17MILNROW CARNIVAL</title>
		<content>   Every year in Milnrow there is a    
 carnival which is held to raise money 
 for local charities. In the carnival  
 there are different groups in fancy   
 dress. There are also floats, Morris  
 dancers, majorettes, church queens and
 bands. A trophy is presented to the   
 best walking group and another for the
 best float. After the procession there
 is a fancy dress competition. One year
 the carnival starts from Firgrove and 
 the next it starts from Newhey.  Each 
 year it ends at Roch Valley High      
 School. In the afternoon stalls are   
 open for refreshments and games in the
 school grounds. Bands and Morris      
 dancing troupes also take part in the 
 entertainment.
