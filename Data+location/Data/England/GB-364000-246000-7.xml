		<title>07FARMING AROUND BISHOPS FROME</title>
		<content> The block includes about 12 farms.Much
 grass is grown for silage, hay and    
 grazing; these support beef cattle and
 sheep but there is no longer dairy    
 herd. Cheyney Court Farm has a        
 pedigree Hereford cattle herd. The    
 main cereal crop is wheat, with a     
 smaller amount of barley and even less
 oats. Hops are a traditional crop,    
 used in beer production for the aroma 
 and bitterness produced by resins and 
 oils in the female flower. But        
 hop-growing is declining because cheap
 imports from Europe and China are     
 available and changing tastes favour  
 lager, which does not need hops,      
 rather than bitter beer. Another      
 characteristic crop is apples. At     
 Leighton Court Farm are extensive     
 orchards of dessert and cooking       
 apples. Many other farms grow cider   
 apples to sell to local cider         </content>
