		<title>11Old Houses in the area.</title>
		<content>         As building stone is scarce in
 the Greensand, it impresses one to see
 that the dozen old and most attractive
 houses edging Passfield Lane are of   
 sandy coloured stone. Old maps show   
 several small local quarries of the   
 Bargate beds. The Cricketers' c1600   
 once the home of a blacksmith with    
 forge next door was a pub in the last 
 century. Quarry Cottage, stone with   
 clay tiles, hides behind a stone wall.
 An old stone barn nearby was recently 
 converted to a home and thatched.     
 Passfield Farm dates from 1520, timber
 frame,still a delight.A fine old      
 wooden framed farm house at Stand ford
 is the scene of much activity and     
 close by an old dwelling 1649 has     
 oak beams, once old naval timbers.    
 Several grand houses of early origin  
 lend charm to scenes along the River  
 Wey both at Standford and Bramshott.  </content>
