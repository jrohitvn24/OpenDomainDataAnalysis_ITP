		<title>12PLAYGROUND GAMES,CROFT.</title>
		<content>  Lots of games which we play today are
 variations of the games that children 
 played many years ago. These include  
 marbles,hopscotch, skipping and hide- 
 and-seek.The boys enjoy playing       
 football on the yard and British Bull-
 dog. The girls like playing make-     
 belief games best. Boys and girls     
 often play together in a game of tig, 
 or girls after boys.                  
  Our playground is marked for netball,
 hopscotch and there series of circles 
 and lines painted for children to play
 on.We also have a large brick playwall
 which we use to kick or throw a ball  
 at, or for cricket.                   
  British Bulldog is just one of the   
 games we play across the yard. We use 
 the netball markings for "Farmer",    
 "Pully", "Peggy-leggy" and different  
 kinds of "Polo".
