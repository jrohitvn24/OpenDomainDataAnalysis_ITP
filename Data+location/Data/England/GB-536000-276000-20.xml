		<content>  SOMERSHAM SITS ASTRIDE THE B1050 AND 
 B1086 WHICH JOIN CHATTERIS TO ST. IVES
 AND HUNTINGDON, AND BEING ON A CLASS B
 NETWORK, ROAD LINKS ARE NOT GOOD.     
  TRAFFIC PROBLEMS INCLUDE POOR        
 VISIBILITY AT A NUMBER OF ROAD        
 JUNCTIONS AND INSUFFICIENT OFF-STREET 
 PARKING IN SOMERSHAM, A MATTER DUE TO 
 BE RESOLVED BY A NEW VILLAGE CAR PARK.
  SOMERSHAM'S RURAL LOCATION MAKES IT  
 DIFFICULT TO SERVE ECONOMICALLY BY    
 PUBLIC TRANSPORT. BUSES DO RUN TO ST. 
 IVES, HUNTINGDON, CHATTERIS AND       
 CAMBRIDGE BUT ROUTES ARE TORTUOUS SO  
 AS TO COVER AN ECONOMIC CATCHMENT AREA
 AND JOURNEYS ARE CORRESPONDINGLY LONG.
 A LOCAL COACH COMPANY RUN A WEEKLY    
 SHOPPING TRIP TO A LOCAL HYPERMARKET. 
                                       
  COMPILED BY J3 AND J4 CHILDREN AND   
 TEACHERS AT SOMERSHAM C.P. SCHOOL     
 DURING THE SUMMER TERM OF 1985.       </content>
