		<title>04LANDSCAPE : E. RAINTON</title>
		<content> E. RAINTON is a small village built on
 a hill 100 ft above sea level. It is  
 6 miles E. of{Durham city}and 2 miles 
 W. from Houghton _ Le _ Spring.Most of
 the old houses have been knocked down 
 and{modern houses}have been built in  
 their places. E. Rainton was a        
{colliery village.                     
 Around E. Rainton there are lots of   
 round rolling hills and lots of big   
 fields, one field is called the       
{Grinders field}because a long time ago
 the{miller}lived in a house in a      
 field. He ground the corn to supply   
 the village with flour. In another    
 field the farmer has ploughed away the
 public footpath. Down at the bottom of
 the field there is some{marsh land}   
 with some chopped down trees. There   
 are also lots of wild flowers.
