		<title>04Mr. Morgan -The Shepherd</title>
		<content>  At Whitehouse Farm there are 2,500   
 sheep.Mr.Morgan and his assistant are 
 in charge of the sheep.He works about 
 40-45 hours a week,but even longer in 
 the lambing eason.Generally 1,700     
 lambs are born each spring, but in the
 south many lambs die in the lambing   
 season.A lamb weighs 40kgs. and a     
 sheep weighs 75kgs.When the lambs are 
 new,they are fed 500kgs.of hay a      
 day,straw,grass,turnips or processed  
 food.A ram costs Â£300,they are dearer 
 than sheep.Sheep cost about Â£100.If a 
 sheep dies it will cost Â£75 to replace
 it.They have their feet clipped once  
 or twice every year.Some people think 
 that sheep are stupid,but Mr.Morgan   
 said that they are not as stupid as   
 people think they are.An average sheep
 lives up to five or six years.The     
 oldest sheep is six years old.He said 
 that sheep can live for up to 15 years</content>
