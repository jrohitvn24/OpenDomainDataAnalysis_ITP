		<content>    Behind our house there was a wood. 
 All the children used to play there   
 for hours making dens to play in      
 during the holidays and after school. 
 Children used to go to school through 
 the wood because the school estate is 
 linked to our estate by it. Now       
 Richards Walk has been made there is  
 only one entrance.A few weeks ago the 
 entrance was fenced up and there is a 
 big{Keep Out}sign. Some children say  
 the wood is haunted by a ghost. They  
 say it is an army general from the    
 second world war. They say he was     
 patrolling the area in a jeep when it 
 was blown up. A couple of months ago a
 few of us went to have a look around  
 and we saw the remains of an old jeep.
 Somewhere in the wood there is the    
 remains of a German bomber. My friends
 and I had a look for it but could not 
 find it.                              </content>
