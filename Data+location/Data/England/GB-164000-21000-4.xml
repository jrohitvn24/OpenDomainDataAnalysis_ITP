		<title>04VIEWS OF A MAN IN CURY</title>
		<content>      I would like to see a few more   
 local job opportunities so it becomes 
 more of a community again. If you talk
 to people who have lived in the       
 village all their lives,and are now   
 retired, this little village up to    
 some six years ago, used to be a      
 totally self sufficient community. It 
 used to have its own school, and a    
 shop where you could buy all your     
 shopping. It also used to have its own
 smithy,carpenter, a cobbler and there 
 were a lot more people living and     
 working in the village. Fishing was a 
 secondary industry where people could 
 get another income. All the amenities,
 if you like the country life and      
 unspoilt beaches, are really natural  
 ones. Gunwalloe is a nice area to live
 in.                                   
                                       
                                       </content>
