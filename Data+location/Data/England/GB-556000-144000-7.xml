		<content> Postwar buildings enlarged the town.  
 Traffic jams provided Sunday          
 entertainment as people watched London
 bound traffic crawl through the town. 
 Rationing kept small shops, and       
 tradesmen delivered goods. In the     
 1960s Tonbridge began to expand to the
 West and East but mostly in the North.
 Supermarkets replaced small shops.    
 Cinemas and dancing were popular.     
 There was an excellent bus-service but
 traffic problems were considerable.   
 Electric trains replaced steam trains 
 making Tonbridge a popular commuter   
 area. Several new schools were built. 
 Today Tonbridge has reached the limit 
 of its expansion. Small developments  
 are replacing large old houses. The   
 main developments are the Angel Centre
 providing supermarket, sports and     
 exhibitions, the Industrial Estate and
 two By-passes built to ease traffic.  </content>
