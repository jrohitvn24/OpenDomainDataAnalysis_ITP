		<content> Bexleyheath has become a major        
 shopping area, with the opening of the
 Broadway Centre.  It was opened on

 Edinburgh, and is owned jointly by the
 London Borough of Bexley and Norwich  
 Union Insurance.  The architectural   
 style is modern, a long four storey   
 building of concrete, brick and glass,
 with hanging tile facing.  Inside, the
 walls are ashlard marble, and the     
 ceilings have a bronzed effect.  In   
 the Mall is a squre where people can

 small fountains.  This area is        
 frequently used for display purposes.
