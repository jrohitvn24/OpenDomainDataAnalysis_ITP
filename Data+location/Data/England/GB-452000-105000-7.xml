		<title>07The Mayor of Fareham</title>
		<content> On the 2nd June 1985 we visited the   
 office of Mayor of Fareham.It has     
 been going since 1974. Before you can 
 become Mayor you have to be a member  
 of the town council. The mayor told us
 that her main duties are being        
 chairman of the council, and meeting  
 as many people as possible. These main
 duties have changed considerably since
 the original Domesday book was        
 written, in the reign of William the  
 Conqueror.The black background on the 
 Mayor's badge is there to represent   
 the Iron industry, the ship is gold,  
 and the flag is the flag of St.       
 George. The motto on the badge reads  
 "Prest a Faire" meaning "Ready to     
 Act". The chain around the Mayor's    
 neck is gold and it is inscribed with 
 the names of recent Mayors.The Mayor  
 showed us her robes which are red,    
 white and black.                      </content>
