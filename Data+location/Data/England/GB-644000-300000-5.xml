		<title>05BOAT HOLIDAYS IN NORFOLK</title>
		<content>    The Norfolk Broads provide a       
 holiday venue for thousands of people 
 each year.Many miles of navigable     
 waterways allow leisurely freedom,    
 although  popular localities become   
 very crowded.Much of Broadland's most 
 picturesque scenery is only accessible
 by boat.The rivers Yare,Waveney       
 and Bure flow into Breydon Water      
 making it a busy cross- roads in high 
 season.Local firms hire boats of      
 various sizes on a weekly or daily    
 basis.Many small river-side           
 settlements depend on tourism for     
 their livelihood.                     
     Problems have arisen due to boat  
 holidays.River banks have been eroded 
 and fuel spillage has caused some     
 pollution.
