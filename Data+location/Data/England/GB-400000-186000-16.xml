		<title>16BRAYDON EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content>    The increase of costs over the past
 years has reduced the number of       
 labourers employed by farmers. There  
 is now an even bigger dependence on   
 families to help with the day to day  
 work. Many look forward to future     
 generations running the family farms. 
    The homes, built for farm labourers
 and their families, are now let to    
 those who have employment elsewhere,  
 usually at nearby towns, as there are 
 certainly no large or small employers 
 in other types of work here.          
    Reflecting the difficulty some have
 in obtaining employment in other parts
 of Britain, one family, now in this   
 area, moved all the way from          
 Yorkshire. The husband found only     
 temporary building and renovation work
 but this was enough to tempt him, with
 wife and four young children, to leave
 relations and familiar surroundings.  </content>
