		<content> The first pit is weak but the hides   
 are put through 14 pits in all,       
 getting stronger each time. The       
 process takes about 9 months,         
 depending on the strength of the the  
 liquor and the temperature. After the 
 pits, the hides are put into drums and
 spun in stronger liquor for finishing.
 They are then dried carefully before  
 going through a variety of processes  
 such as scrubbing, oil rubbing,       
 rolling and shaving for different     
 uses. The hides are left overnight in 
 a heated vat containing mutton tallow,
 cod oil and shumac to give an         
 attractive colour. Further layers of  
 colour are built up by hand and then  
 the hide is greased to preserve it.   
 About 25% of output is used for       
 harness leather and 60% for medical   
 use which, by law, can only be oak    
 tanned leather.                       </content>
