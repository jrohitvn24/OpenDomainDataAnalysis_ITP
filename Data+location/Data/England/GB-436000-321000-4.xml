		<content> "The Limeyards" cover approximately 50
 acres of land to the South East of    
 Ticknall, part of the Harpur-Crewe    
 Estate. These abandoned works were    
 used between 1874 &amp; 1915 for quarrying
 &amp; burning Lime for sale in Ashby de   
 la Zouch. It was transported there by 
 a 4'2" gauge horse-drawn tramway,     
 which was officially closed in 1915.  
 This has left a fascinating study area
 for botanists, naturalists &amp;          
 ornithologists &amp; anyone who enjoys    
 natural beauty. The four quarries are 
 waterfilled &amp; used for fishing for    
 perch,tench &amp; an elusive carp! The    
 areas between are filled with         
 deciduous woodland &amp; all manner of    
 lime loving plants. The Derbyshire    
 Naturalist Trust manages a part which 
 houses the rarest plants i.e. the bee 
 orchid, to protect &amp; preserve them.
