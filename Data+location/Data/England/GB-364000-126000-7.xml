		<title>07WOMEN'S WORK-in a rural area</title>
		<content>  The majority of the female population
 between the ages of 18 and 45 are     
 wives and mothers with children under 
 16.Being a wife and mother can be a   
 full-time job but many choose or need 
 to work as well as run their homes.   
   A few "working women" can be found. 
 These tend to be professional women   
 who have returned to their careers    
 after a few years at home raising     
 young children.Their jobs are well    
 paid and the children are generally in
 private education.                    
   Apart from these women others do    
 some kind of part-time or casual work 
 outside the home,mainly "cleaning     
 ladies" for well-off retired people   
 and also for "working women".         
   Many wives of farmers and farm      
 workers are involved in the everyday  
 tasks of the farm both paper work and 
 looking after animals.                </content>
