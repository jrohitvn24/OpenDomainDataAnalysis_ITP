		<title>17CONSERVATION AREA</title>
		<content>Our school has a conservation area.    
That is an area that has been fenced   
off from the rest of the school field  
and where we have planted trees and    
shrubs and wild flowers.               
A group called Operation South Cannock 
started us off with our conservation   
area.  They bought some of the trees   
and plants and helped us dig the       
drainage ditches.                      
Children from the third and fourth year
did all the hard digging and planting. 
We planted bushes and flowers that     
would attract birds and insects so that
we can study them in our science       
lessons.                               
We also build a pond which has frogs   
and fish in it. It also has water      
plants.                                
A local garden centre gave us a lot of 
plants for our conservation area.
