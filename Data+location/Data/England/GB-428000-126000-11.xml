		<title>11Farm Survey (cont)</title>
		<content> There are 400 cattle on Dean Hill Barn
 Farm.                                 
 Wheat of different varieties is grown 
 for seed on a contract and peas too.  
 This means the farmer has to work to  
 very high standards. The grain drier  
 is constructed within a large barn    
 made of steel, wood and a concrete    
 floor. The grain is put into a large  
 hopper in the floor, taken by an      
 elevator through the drier and then   
 tipped into the storage silos.        
 Sometimes, to maintain quality, the   
 grain is checked by hand.
