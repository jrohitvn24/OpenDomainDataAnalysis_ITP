		<title>09PATOIS ERDINGTON</title>
		<content> Patois literally means dialect.  It is
 the language of Jamaicans and a few   
 other West Indians.  Patois is like a 
 first language to us.  When amongst   
 friends and family we tend to speal   
 Patois rather than English.  Patois   
 reminds us of our roots.  It          
 originated in the days of slavery.    
 Patois can be a comfort to some West  
 Indians when rejected from this       
 society because of colour or race     
 prejudice.  Racism is constantly      
 around and a black person feels more  
 secure with Patois.  As West Indians  
 we speak Patois to show that we are   
 proud of our origins.  We are aware of
 our identity and must never forget it.
 There are many other ways to show our 
 identity, through dance, music, poetry
 and stories.  Personally if I gave up 
 speaking Patois I would feel like I   
 had given up a major part of my life. </content>
