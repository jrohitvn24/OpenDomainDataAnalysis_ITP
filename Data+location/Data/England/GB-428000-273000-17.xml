		<content>Gibbet Hill  had more buses because it 
has 2 bus stops. The buses from        
Kenilworth that we saw on the bypass   
were going to Coventry and Birmingham. 
The bypass was used more for lorries   
delivering things to other parts of the
country.Most of them were Walker's     
Crisp trucks.Most of the heavy goods   
vehicles were travelling on the        
bypass.The quiet vehicles were         
travelling on Gibbet Hill because of   
the University. There wouldn't be a lot
of bicycles on the bypass because of   
the danger of being run over. At the   
bypass we counted 355 cars and 127 at  
Gibbet Hill. The buses on the bypass   
were quite full but the buses on Gibbet
Hill were empty.
