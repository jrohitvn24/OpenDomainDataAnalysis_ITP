		<content> Sunday school no longer exists, but   
 the rector is in contact with younger 
 children through the school brass     
 rubbing sessions, and activity        
 afternoons during school holidays. A  
 lively church magazine, a combined    
 effort of rector and village spreads  
 the word about not only national      
 concerns and local church matters  but
 also local fund raising events. The   
 annual Garden Festival is a popular   
 event attracting crowds to private    
 gardens all over the village, and the 
 Suffolk Historic Churches Trust Cycle 
 Ride raises money through sponsored   
 cyclists visiting as many churches as 
 possible in this corner of the        
 diocese. The chior consists of several
 village ladies and like most villages,
 Thurlow has its flower arranging rota.
