		<content> Lived in Portchester for seven and a  
 half years.  He considers his main    
 problem in life to be a lessening of  
 job satisfaction and he feels bitter  
 about the state of the education      
 system and the status of the teaching 
 profession.                           
 One national problem is the           
 philosophical division of the country.
 Ideas of separate people and parties  
 conflict so greatly that no common    
 ground or compromise can be found     
 between the extremes eg               
 Nationalisation by Labour or          
 Denationalisation by the Conservatives
 Here, political dogma dictates the    
 course taken instead of economic      
 commonsense.
