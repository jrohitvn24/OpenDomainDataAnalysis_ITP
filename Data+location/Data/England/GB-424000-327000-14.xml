		<title>14EGGINTON SCHOOL BUILDING</title>
		<content> The school is built of bricks and     
 some bits look newer than others. The 
 school is very small. It is 17.20     
 metres long and 17 metres wide. In the
 upper juniors' class room there is a  
 war memorial with the names of the    
 people who were killed on it. There is
 a wreath of poppies next to it. The   
 lower juniors' classroom is the       
 canteen as well. The hall has some    
 P.E. apparatus.  The school has a     
 little garden in which we plant flower
 and vegetable seeds. I have never been
 to another school and I like this     
 school because it is so small and you 
 can't get lost.
