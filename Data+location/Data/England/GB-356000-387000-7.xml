		<title>07The Development of Old Hall</title>
		<content> There is a large Horse Chestnut tree  
 on the corner of Old Hall Road between
 the Barns Community Centre and the new
 pub.It stands there tall and strong   
 branches waving in the breeze.It has  
 probably been there a few hundred     
 years.If it could only talk what a    
 story it could tell.When it was a     
 seedling the land all around was used 
 for farming and hunting,the pub was   
 still a farmhouse,the barn had cows in
 it and a great family lived in the Old
 Hall.Time passed people came and went.
 In 1940 when the tree was reaching    
 maturity thousands of men came and    
 camped around the Old Hall.They all   
 belonged to Burtonwood Air Base.The   
 place was crowded,all was hustle and  
 bustle and the peace was continually  
 shattered by the noise of large       
 aircraft landing and taking off close 
 by.                                   </content>
