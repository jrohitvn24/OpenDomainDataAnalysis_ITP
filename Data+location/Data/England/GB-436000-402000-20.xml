		<content> THE CHILDREN TOLD US THAT ON SUNDAYS  
 THEY PLAYED WITH TOYS OR FRIENDS, WENT
 BIKE-RIDES OR WALKS, VISITED RELATIVES
 WENT SWIMMING, DID HOUSEWORK, WENT TO 
 MAJORETTES, CLEANED PETS OUT, LISTENED
 TO THE RADIO OR WATCHED TELEVISION.   
 WE TOLD THE VICAR WHAT WE HAD FOUND   
 OUT AND ASKED HIM WHY HE THOUGHT SO   
 FEW CHILDREN WENT TO CHURCH. WE ASKED 
 HIM IF HE COULD SEE THINGS GETTING ANY
 BETTER AND HE SAID THAT HE GOT BETWEEN
 20 AND 30 CHILDREN AT SERVICES        
 INCLUDING THOSE IN THE CHOIR AND HE   
 SUPPOSED THAT UNLESS PARENTS EXPLAINED
 THINGS TO THEM THEY WOULD FIND IT     
 BORING. HE COULD NOT SEE THINGS       
 CHANGING MUCH AND HE HAD NO PLANS FOR 
 DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT TO GET MORE  
 PEOPLE TO COME. WE ASKED HIM IF HE    
 LIKED VISITING OUR SCHOOL AND HE      
 SAID,"NO, NOT REALLY," SO WE TOLD HIM 
 WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM MORE OFTEN.  </content>
