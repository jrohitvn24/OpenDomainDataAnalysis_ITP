		<title>02Cattistock Village</title>
		<content> The largest village is Cattistock;,   
 which, together with the surrounding  
 farms and hamlets, constitutes a      
 Conservation Area in which new        
 building is restricted by law.   It   
 has a main street containing two      
 right-angled bends leading in opposite
 directions.                           
 The village square is actually        
 triangular, bounded on two sides by   
 15th and 16th century cottages, some  
 stone-built, some rendered, many of   
 them thatched.   Along one side is the
 churchyard, with the War Memorial     
 standing just inside the gate.  Also a
 well-head with drinking cup is        
 in the churchyard.Behind the village  
 square there is a small development   
 of council bungalows providing        
 sheltered accommodation for 20        
 retirement pensioners, with warden    
 supervision.                          </content>
