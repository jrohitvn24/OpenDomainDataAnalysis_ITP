 The houses and farms show some variety
 in their construction and age, ranging
 from reputedly fifteenth century to   
 the l960's. There are six             
  timber-framed buildings in various   
 states of preservation.  One has been 
 completely dismantled in the last two 
 years  and rebuilt with a new thatched
 roof, but many have had the thatch    
 either replaced by tile or slate, or  
 covered in corrugated iron or asbestos
 sheeting. Church and Vicarage are     
 built of stone but the majority of    
 inhabited buildings are in brick,     
 usually bare but some colour-washed.  
 Some Victorian houses have brick      
 ground floors with timbered first     
 floor, whilst others which appear to  
 be brick prove to have been built     
 around earlier timbered originals.
