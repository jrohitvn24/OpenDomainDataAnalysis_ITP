		<content> Farming is the main industry of this  
 area.  Most of the land is owned by   
 Earl Spencer's estate and is let to   
 tenant farmers in one large unit and  
 several small-holdings.  One farm of  
 about 500 acres is privately owned, as
 is one small-holding.                 
 this is a prime sugar-beet growing    
 area with the processing factory 22   
 miles away at Kings Lynn.  The climate
 is conducive to the production of good
 malting barley.  Wheat, oats &amp; oilseed
 rape are grown, some rye grass for    
 seed production, and mustard on       
 contract for a national company.      
 Carrots and other vegetables provide  
 useful break-crops.  There are no     
 livestock farmers in this area.       
 The farmers are generally sympathetic 
 to the need for countryside           
 conservation.
