		<title>19MR SCOTT, NEW ENGLAND FARM</title>
		<content> Mr. Scott has lived and worked on New 
 England Farm for many years. He is a  
 local gentleman having been born in   
 Swaffham Bulbeck on 9th. January 1899.
 He is very active for his 86 years. He
 could remember going to school but    
 also having to work very hard from a  
 very early age. To travel then one had
 to go by foot or by bicycle if you    
 were lucky enough to have one. Mr.    
 Scott told us about the days he       
 started to learn to drive in his early
 twenties and he did not have to have a
 test. The driving test has reached 50 
 years but Mr. Scott has been driving  
 longer than that and still makes trips
 to the Norfolk coast with his wife. He
 got married on November 26th. 1926 and
 went to live with his wife in the     
 cottage at New England Farm some      
 thirteen years later. They are now    
 looking for a bungalow to live in.    </content>
