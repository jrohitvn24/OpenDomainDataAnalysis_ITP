    We found the" Domesday Project"    
really interesting because we had a    
good look at the area in which we live 
and go to school.                      
    We now know far more than even some
adults about where we live.I think we  
enjoyed our visits to the farms and    
factories the best.                    
    What amazed us was  how " friendly"
and helpful people were when we asked  
them questions. They were all most     
co-operative.
