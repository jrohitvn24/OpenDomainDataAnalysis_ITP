		<content>Local History -  At Northbrook there is
a brick built dovecot which together   
with a walled garden is all that       
remains of the Manor House. The main   
house in Kirtlington being built       
between 1741 and 1748, when it was     
owned by the Dashwood family. During   
the Civil War soldiers from both sides 
were billeted in the village. The      
first Post Office was opened in 1815   
and it is known that during the 18th   
Century shops, blacksmiths, bakers, a  
dairy, a jewellers and many public     
houses existed in the village. Prior   
to 1811 farmers owned various small    
strips of land scattered over the      
village. The Land Inclosure Act of     
1815 forced farmers to exchange        
pieces of land to create larger        
areas and thus make farming more       
convenient. Kirtlington is mentioned   
in records as early as 977.            </content>
