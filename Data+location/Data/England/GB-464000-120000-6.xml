		<title>06THE DAIRY SHOP.</title>
		<content> This shop closed 28 years ago.It      
 was a butchers shop for many          
 years,owned by a well_known local     
 man,remembered by some of our older   
 customers.We opened our dairy shop in 
 this lovely 600 year old thatched     
 cottage in East Meon one year ago.We  
 are growing as a family concern all   
 the time,and have a nice relationship 
 with the public.                      
 We have a large milk round in the     
 village and the surrounding           
 countryside.We sell general           
 groceries,fresh milk and cream,local  
 made bread,home made scones and all   
 kinds of fish,including fresh trout   
 from the River Test,fresh fruit and   
 vegetables and a good selection of    
 ice_cream and sweets.
