		<title>03GREAT OFFLEY, contd.</title>
		<content>  Offley has a cricket pitch with woods
 nearby, and there is fishing in Long  
 Pond. There is a small park with a    
 slide and roundabout for the children.
 Opposite Pond House are private livery
 stables. By the crossroads there is a 
 small public garden, where people may 
 sit quietly, called Pond Garden; this 
 could be a nice spot but is spoiled by
 much litter. At night, the lights of  
 the pubs are very pretty, but the     
 Green Man is very noisy and the many  
 visitors cause parking problems. Most 
 weekends, the Riding Club holds some  
 kind of show at the old football      
 ground. There is a general shop and   
 Post Office near the crossroads and a 
 butcher's shop in the High Street. The
 roads are easy to cross since Offley  
 was by-passed and there are many long 
 walks in the country around. The      
 people of Offley are very friendly.   </content>
