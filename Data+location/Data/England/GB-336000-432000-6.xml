		<title>06A day at school</title>
		<content>     I attend Weeton C. of E. primary  
 school. On Thursday morning I arrived 
 at school at 9 o'clock and read a book
 for 15 minutes. I then did three cards
 of S.M.P. maths. For once I got them  
 all right! This was followed by 10    
 minutes of Hesse and calculator maths.
                                       
     After lunch I had my piano lesson 
 and helped Heather build our castle.  
                                       
     The afternoon seemed very long,   
 but at last we tidied up and went out 
 to play. Back in the classrooom, we   
 sang "Black and Gold" and said the    
 poem "The Old Wife and the Ghost". It 
 was story time after that and our     
 teacher read two chapters of the book.
                                       
     We said our prayers and it was    
 hometime. HURRAY!
