		<content>{"Tying the Church Gates"}is a         
 tradition in Swainby that is not      
 generally found locally. The village  
 children assemble while the wedding is
 in progress and tie the gates with    
 yards of string which the best man has
 to untie, first throwing handfuls of  
 coins for which the children scramble.
 This being the only exit, no-one can  
 leave until the "ransom" is paid. The 
{Whorlton Run}is a more recent custom  
 started by a village policeman in     
 1960. Competitors are started off by  
 shotgun outside the Blacksmiths' Arms;
 senior men take a 3-mile route through
 Scugdale and Whorlton, senior ladies a
 shorter one,and children run a simpler
 course. A large crowd assembles to    
 cheer the winners, trophies are       
 presented and thirsts slaked inside   
 the Blacksmiths' Arms.{Carol singing} 
 is kept up in Swainby and Potto.      </content>
