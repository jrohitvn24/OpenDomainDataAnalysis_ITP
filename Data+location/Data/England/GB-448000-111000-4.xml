		<title>04A SCHOOL MORNING</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.00 am.I have my         
 breakfast at about 7.30 am.I have a   
 bowl of Corn Flakes and a cup of tea. 
 At 8.00 I get my clothes on.At about  
 8.30 I leave for school.It takes 25   
 minutes to walk to school.            
 We go into school at 9.00 and go to   
 the hall for assembly.We get back to  
 class at about 9.50 and we may do     
 S.M.P. mathematics.                   
 At 10.40 there is playtime and I often
 play rounders.This is a game where you
 have to hit a ball with a bat and run 
 round four bases without stopping     
 before the other team tap the base    
 with the ball.                        
                                       
 We go back to class at 11.00 and we   
 may do writing until 12.00 when we    
 learn French.We have lunch at 12.20.I 
 have crisps, sandwiches and a         
 "Penguin" biscuit.                    </content>
