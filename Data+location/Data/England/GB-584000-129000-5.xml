		<title>05Great Maytham Hall,Rolvenden</title>
		<content>  {Great Maytham Hall}is one of the    
 largest of the country houses in the  
 area. The manor of "Mayhamme" was     
 mentioned in the Domesday Book but the
 first house was not built until 1721. 
 It has been re-built several times and
 the present house was designed by Sir 
 Edwin Lutyens in 1909.                
   The house fell into disrepair       
 between 1936 and 1955 and was almost  
 pulled down but a housing association 
 bought it, restored it and converted  
 it into apartments for retired people.
   Today 34 people share the luxury    
 which was once for one family. There  
 are almost 100 rooms in the house now 
 and 6 acres of peaceful gardens.      
   The most famous part of the gardens 
 is the walled garden which inspired   
 Francis Hodgson Burnett to write "The 
 Secret Garden" during the time that   
 she rented the house in 1898.         </content>
