		<content> of employment is represented by       
 teachers at three educational         
 establishments outside the            
 survey area: Clinton School Merton,   
 Shebbear College and Marland School.  
 Figures quoted relating to employment 
 are based on one only adult earner per
 household, but a considerable amount  
 of additional work, often part-time,  
 is provided by those schools.         
   Although primarily a{farming area,  
 employment on the farms is very low - 
 they are generally family-run - and   
 employment covers a wide spectrum of  
 occupations: civil engineer, solicitor
 estate agent, glass blower, haulier,  
 carpenter, electrician, shipwright,   
 etc.. Employment is dependent on motor
 vehicles as there are no trains and   
 few buses. Everyone goes to work by   
 car or motorcycle, travelling 3-20    
 miles each way daily.                 </content>
