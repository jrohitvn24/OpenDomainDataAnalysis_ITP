		<title>10THE MANORS OLD PEOPLE'S HOME</title>
		<content> There is not a garden at the Manors   
 just a few shrubs around the border.  
 There is one large bench which holds  
 about six pensioners at a time.       
 Inside the 36 flatlets there are no   
 modern appliances, particularly gas,  
 as the pensioners would find it hard  
 to adjust to these modern ways. There 
 is a large games area where the       
 pensioners can listen to music, play  
 dominoes, read or even play bingo. It 
 is rather like a hospital as there are
 lots of well cleaned crridors. The    
 building is painted once every three  
 years, but the pensioners must arrange
 to have their own centrally heated    
 flats decorated.                      
 It is very rare that all the flats are
 occupied at once.
