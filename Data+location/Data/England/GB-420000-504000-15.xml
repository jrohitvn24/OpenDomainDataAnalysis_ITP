		<content> The land within our block is mainly   
 used for farming. There is a mixture  
 of arable and grazing land with some  
 small wooded areas. There is no other 
 industry of any significance in this  
 area.                                 
 The majority of the buildings in the  
 village of{Middleton Tyas}are private 
 dwelling houses and further building  
 developments  are  restricted  by     
 planning controls. These are some of  
 the factors which make it unlikely    
 that there will be any major changes  
 in the existing landscape during the  
 foreseeable future.                   
 A{major change}in the local landscape 
 which has taken place in the past  20 
 years  has  been  the construction  of
 the   {Scotch Corner  A1M/A66  Road   
{Interchange.} This and the  {Scotch   
{Corner Hotel}are well known landmarks.
