		<title>17EXETER  MINI-BUS  SERVICE</title>
		<content>    Recently in Exeter there has been  
 introduced a{Mini-Bus Service.}They   
 are replacing the old double-deckers  
 on the{city bus routes.}They can carry
 up to about fifteen people.They are   
 small and so inexpensive to run and   
 are quicker.One thing that is really  
 helpful is that you don't have to     
 wait at stops you can wave them       
 down.They are useful if you want to go
 into town quickly.                    
    They only operate on certain routes
 such as Cowick Street- City Centre    
 though.They usually have about two on 
 a service they'd use a double-decker  
 bus for.                              
    I think they should extend         
 this service to other places even     
 remote towns.I also think they should 
 have an{Express and special services  
 for special occasions such as the     
 Carnival or the Festival.             </content>
