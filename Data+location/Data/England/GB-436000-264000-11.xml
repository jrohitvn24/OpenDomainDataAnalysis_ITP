		<title>11OFFCHURCH, MODERN DAY LIVING</title>
		<content>  {Offchurch,}housing approximately 200
 people, is described by its residents 
 as a quiet and friendly village away  
 from the bustle of modernisation.     
  There is one{Public House, a Church  
 and a{Village Hall.                   
{ }With no shops nor schools in the    
 village, residents travel to nearby   
 towns and larger villages, but many   
 feel that the abundance of wildlife to
 be seen close by -{squirrels, badgers,
{moles, foxes and muntjak deer -}makes 
 up for lack of facilities.            
   Social activities include{Keep Fit, 
{Upholstery, Tapestry, Bellringing,    
{Cricket}and{Football.}Recently some   
 private gardens have been opened to   
 the public as a fund raising venture. 
   Some social and educational         
 activities take place in the Village  
 Hall while the Old School is used for 
 country festivals.                    </content>
