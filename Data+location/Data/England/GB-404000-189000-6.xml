		<content> Public transport in this area is very 
 sparse and the majority of households 
 in the block have a car of necessity. 
 There is a bus service daily between  
 Cricklade and Malmesbury, and a school
 bus in term time between Ashton Keynes
 and Braydon Forest School in Purton.  
 Although there is no station nearby,  
 the main Swindon to Gloucester railway
 line runs through the block. In August
 of 1985 a number of steam trains were 
 run along this line to celebrate 150  
 years of the Great Western Railway.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
 THE INFORMATION FOR THIS BLOCK WAS    
 RESEARCHED AND PRODUCED BY THE LADIES 
 OF THE{ASHTON KEYNES WOMENS INSTITUTE 
 WITH THE KIND ASSISTANCE OF LOCAL     
 RESIDENTS.                            </content>
