		<title>13Royston Police Station</title>
		<content>   Royston police station has been in  
 the same building on Priory Lane for  
 103 years. The police used to have    
 horses, but now the stables have      
 become the police car park. The police
 station has a magistrates' court next 
 door, where people are tried. Three   
 magistrates sit at a long table.      
 Sometimes people are kept in one of   
 the cells, which are old and dark.In  
 each cell there is a bed and a rock-  
 hard pillow made of wood.             
   The police deal with everything from
 lost property to an occasional murder.
 They have a new computerised breath-  
 alyser machine to test drunk drivers. 
   The police patrol the streets and   
 help people. They catch shop-lifters  
 and burglars. They go all over Royston
 and the villages to the south, but not
 into Cambridgeshire, because that is a
 different county.                     </content>
