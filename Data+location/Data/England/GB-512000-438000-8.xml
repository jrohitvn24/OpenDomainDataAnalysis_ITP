  The playing field contains swings,   
 slides and a climbing frame. There is 
 a cricket pitch where the Cricket team
 plays on Saturday afternoons and      
 Sundays. There is a small changing    
 room which the Rugby and Cricket teams
 use.                                  
  During the rugby season a rugby      
 pitch is marked out and the players   
 play Rugby League at weekends and     
 train twice during the week.          
  A gala is held on the field in the   
 summer with a foot race around 10     
 kilometers of the local lanes.
