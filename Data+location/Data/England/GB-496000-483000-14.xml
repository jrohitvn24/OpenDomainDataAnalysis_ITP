		<title>14A farmworkers day</title>
		<content> 'It's 7.00am and time to get up and   
 ready for work. I have some breakfast 
 and let the dogs out. I arrive at the 
 farm at about 8.00am. We feed the     
 livestock and get the machinery       
 ready for work. The dogs come to the  
 farm everyday. We start work on the   
 land at about 10.00am. At the moment  
 I'm mostly baling hay or spraying.    
 When we bale hay it takes about three 
 hours depending on the size of the    
 field. I drive an Internatational     
 685xl. It has a 72hp engine.After I   
 have baled the field we load the hay  
 onto trailers and stack them in the   
 dutch barns. We go home for dinner at 
 12.00pm and go back to work at 1.00pm.
 During the dinner hour I sometimes cut
 the lawns and tidy up. After dinner I 
 often go to spray.
