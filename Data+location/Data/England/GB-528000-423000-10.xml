		<content>{OLD SCHOOL AT WINESTEAD}              
                                       
 When the school closed it was used as 
 a Village Hall for activities such as 
 a library and for whist drives and    
 parties etc. and was still owned by   
 the Local Authority.  When it became  
 no longer a viable proposition it was 
 sold to the present owner in 1980.    
 The new owner raised the roof by many 
 courses to make it two floors high and
 removed many unsightly outbuildings.  
 They also made the playground into a  
 garden and added many more structural 
 features and amenities. It now        
 consists of a lounge, living room,    
 dining area, kitchen and sun-lounge   
 with breakfast area and a bathroom    
 up and downstairs and four bedrooms.  
 Formerly as a school it only had one  
 large room with a partition and       
 kitchen. The present value is Â£57,750 </content>
