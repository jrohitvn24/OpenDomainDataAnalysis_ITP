		<title>01VILLAGE IN THE FOREST</title>
		<content> The whole block is owned by the       
 Forestry Commission, abb to F.C.      
 throughout the remainder. The Norfolk_
 Suffolk County border follows the L.  
 Ouse in a large curve in the north of 
 this block; Santon Downham is at the  
 centre of this arc. Here the          
 administrative centre of the Thetford 
 Forest has been built. This Forest is 
 the largest lowland forest in Britain 
 _21,483 Ha forest and 969 Ha farmland.
 It makes good use of the poor soil of 
 Breckland. The F.C. was established in
 1919 and planting of Scots pines      
 started here in 1922. The trees are   
 now Corsican pines which are found to 
 be more economic. The Forest District 
 Office also acts as a Fire Control    
 Centre which is served by local fire  
 brigades. Most of the following pages 
 contain references to the F.C.        
                                       </content>
