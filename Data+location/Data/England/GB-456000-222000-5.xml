		<content>LOCAL HISTORY: Bicester is thought to  
be of Saxon origin.The first authentic 
reference was in the 1086 Domesday     
Survey,when it is called Berencestra   
and had 2 manors and 2 mills,and it    
belonged to Robert d'Oily who built    
Oxford Castle.                         
  In 1182 an Augustine priory was built
by Gilbert de Basset and it probably   
stood on the site of Old Place Yard but
only the dovecot now remains.          
  There are many old buildings in the  
town.In the market place the medieval  
funnel-shaped plan is still visible.   
There are many houses dating back to   
the 16th and 17th centuries.           
  Many famous people have visited the  
town including Henry V111 who spent    
many nights here;as did Elizabeth 1.   
Charles 1 and Oliver Cromwell.
