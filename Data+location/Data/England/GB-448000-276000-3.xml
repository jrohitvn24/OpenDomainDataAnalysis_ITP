		<content> Survey of Leiceter road roundabout.   
           ========================    
 Brownsover end, 2 minutes, 10 cars.   
 Motorway end, 13 cars, 1 minute. Swift
 valley end, 10 cars, 8 minutes. Rugby 
 end, 17 cars, 2 minutes. Survey of 50 
 cars altogether took 13 minutes. 359  
 cars used the roundabout between 2.06 
 pm and 2.24 pm. There were 8 "B"      
 registrations, 46 petrol cars, 4      
 diesels, 29 privately owned cars and  
 21 industrial vehicles. There were    
 also 3 motorbikes in the time. As it  
 is in the centre of three industrial  
 estates the roundabout is in constant 
 use. Saplings have recently been      
 planted around the roundabout. The    
 roundabout was built in 1984 for the  
 industrial estates and the motorway.
