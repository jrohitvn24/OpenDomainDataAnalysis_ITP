		<title>17SMEATHARPE - AMENITIES.</title>
		<content> The nearest village shop is at Church-
 inford, and is a sub-post office as   
 well.  Many village shops have closed 
 in the last 2O years as people shop in
 bulk, in town super-markets with comp-
 etitive prices.                       
 Smeatharpe has few amenities but even 
 the public telephone box is under     
 constant threat of closure.  British  
 Telecom, the private monopoly who owns
 the telephone service, continually    
 reviews kiosks who have takings of    
 less than Â£2OO per year.              
 In the hot dry summers of 1976 and    
 1984, restrictions were imposed upon  
 the use of water.  This is when almost
 a million tourists visit the area.  It
 seems incredible, with increasing     
 water charges and the high rainfall in
 Devon, that this situation should     
 occur.  Obviously there are insuffic- 
 ient reservoirs for the population.   </content>
