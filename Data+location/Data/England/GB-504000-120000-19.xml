		<title>19RECREATION, NORTH PULBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  There are no public sports or leisure
 facilities in the area, other than the
 Rose and Crown public house. Gardening
 is the most popular recreation for    
 local residents.                      
  Several of the larger houses have    
 their own tennis courts and some a    
 private swimming pool.                
  Some houses and farms have stables   
 and riding is popular. The area is    
 well served with bridle paths,though  
 the West Sussex County Council has    
 only limited resources for keeping    
 them clear. So local horseriders      
 sometimes carry out the necessary     
 clearance.                            
  Public footpaths offer good walking  
 with pleasant views of the North and  
 South Downs. Societies such as the    
 Sussex Downsmen, Sussex Wealdsmen and 
 the Ramblers Association arrange for  
 the leading of walks through the area.</content>
