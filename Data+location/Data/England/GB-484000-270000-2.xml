		<title>02The Village Of Orlingbury</title>
		<content>   The village of Orlingbury is        
situated 5 kilometres outside the town 
of Wellingborough.The area surrounding 
the village is mainly agricultural     
farmland .Much of the land is used for 
the growing of cereal crops,But some of
the land is used for keeping cattle and
sheep.                                 
   Most people who live in the village 
work in Wellingborough and travel to   
work daily by private car.There are a  
number of doctors living in the village
but none of them has a surgery in      
Orlingbury. There is no industry other 
than farming.                          
   In the centre of the village is the 
Green which has in it's centre a well. 
Today this well is no longer used as it
has a concrete cap over it.It was      
capped because a man when collecting   
water from the well fell down and died.
