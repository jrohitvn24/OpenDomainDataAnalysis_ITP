		<content> Even tough both young and old complain
 because the village is so isolated,   
 they all care about it equally and    
 resent any change which would spoil   
 the characteristics of the village.   
 For example, when a sign to warn      
 motorists about cattle was put up in  
 the square many complained. A small   
 brown addition to the sign made the   
 point!                                
                                       
 Most people think that the younger    
 ones should be more involved in the   
 running of events and now three       
 youngsters have joined the            
 entertainments committee              
                                       
 Everyone in the village seems to know 
 everyone else's business, which would 
 seem like nosiness to an outsider, but
 is mainly just friendly concern.
