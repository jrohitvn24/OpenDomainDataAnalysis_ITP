		<title>08WILDLIFE IN THE NEW FOREST</title>
		<content>    In the New Forest there are a lot  
 of animals and insects around.{       
    We saw some spiders with eggsacks  
 dragging behind them. Some ants were  
 about half a cm long and some were    
 a bit bigger.The bigger ants were the 
 biggest ants in Europe.               
    We saw a few forest ponies with    
 baby foals .They looked ever so  cute.
    They had fluffy manes and they were
 quite small.There were quite a few    
 birds in the sky too,but I couldn't   
 make out what kind of birds they      
 were.There were some colourful        
{Butterflies.}They were quite          
 interesting.Their colours were        
 bright and gay.They were mainly purple
 ones.There were other colours too,but 
 purple was the main colour.           
    The ladybirds were quite common in 
 the forest and other places.
