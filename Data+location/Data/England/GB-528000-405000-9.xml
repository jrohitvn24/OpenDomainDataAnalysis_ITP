 To play kick-ball fly you need a      
 football and a lot of people.One      
 person sits on the ball and chooses   
 another person to kick the ball he    
 also chooses a person to be 'it'.The  
 kicker kicks the ball down the street 
 and the person that is 'it' runs after
 the ball to bring it back. He or she  
 has to return backwards while the     
 other people go and hide.When the     
 person that is 'it' gets back he looks
 for the others.If one person gets to  
 the ball before the person that is    
 'it' he can kick it and the person who
 is 'it' must get the ball again and   
 look for the others.When everyone is  
 caught the first person to be caught  
 is 'it' and the game begins again.
