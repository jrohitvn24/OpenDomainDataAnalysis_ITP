		<content>Shareshill is a small village lying 6  
miles north of Wolverhampton and 4     
miles south-west of Cannock.Whilst     
retaining the agricultural nature of   
the area it is basically a dormitory   
village for workers in the West Mid-   
lands conurbation.The M6 cuts through  
the N.E.of the area enabling quick and 
easy travelling from junction ll.      
Shareshill together with Great and     
Little Saredon were mentioned in the   
original Domesday Book.It was recorded 
that Shareshill was assessed at 3 hides
having woods half a mile long and as   
much broad.A hide is usually taken as  
l2O acres thus in lO86 the village     
covered an area of about 36O acres. In 
l563 there were 3O households,and in   
l665 79 households.In the census of    
l98l the population was 72O.
