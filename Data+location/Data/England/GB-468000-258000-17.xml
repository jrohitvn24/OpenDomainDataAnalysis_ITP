		<content>  The people we interviewed said they  
 liked Kislingbury very much.Many of   
 the houses in Kislingbury are old but 
 there are a some new ones being       
 built.One man we interviewed told us  
 that his house was built in {1705}but 
 the oldest building in Kislingbury is 
 the church which was built in {1219}. 
  Kislingbury itself has changed alot  
 since the seventies.There has been a  
 new estate built, and therefore a     
 change in the types of resident.Most  
 of the people we interviewed said they
 did not want Kislingbury to get any   
 bigger.We think that Kislingbury is a 
 nice place to live.                   
  General concern is shown over{social 
{problems}such as vandalism and litter 
 in the streets.The area has many      
 resident associations which hold no   
 legal power but encourage the upkeep  
 of standards.                         </content>
