		<title>17ASDA v The Local Shop.</title>
		<content> The area is served with the usual     
 collection of small, local shops and  
 one large{ASDA Superstore.}But which  
 type of shop do people prefer?        
{"You can't beat the friendly service  
{of the corner shop",}says one old     
 lady.{"They're good places to catch up
{on all the gossip",}she added.        
 However, not all agree.{"Shopping is  
{such hard work",}say one young couple.
{"At least at ASDA we can get a  week's
{shopping done quickly."               
 The price advantage is often mentioned
 too.{"Very competetive",}said one man.
 Certainly those with busy lives or    
 keen money savers preferred ASDA.     
 But perhaps the last word should go to
 the school girl who said,{"I'd never  
{go to ASDA to buy my 1O pence worth   
{of spice!"                            
                                       
                                       </content>
