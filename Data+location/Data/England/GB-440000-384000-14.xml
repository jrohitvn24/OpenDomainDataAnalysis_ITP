		<title>14ECOLOGY -RIVER ROTHER AREA</title>
		<content> We studied the River Rother which is  
 one of the most polluted rivers in    
 England. We found little or no water  
 life and the river had been used as a 
 dumping ground for unwanted junk.A    
 large flash or lake,caused by mining  
 subsidence, is nearby.This is a haven 
 for wild birds particularly the grebe 
 and heron. Water skiers share this    
 site causing some noise pollution and 
 irritation with local inhabitants.A   
 small number of houses, over 90 years 
 old,are situated near the flash.The   
 people enjoy living here because of   
 the rural aspect.The area is used by  
 occasional ramblers,bird watchers and 
 fishermen.Very little agriculture is  
 possible because of the poor soil.    
 Much of the surrounding area is a     
 waste industrial tip.
