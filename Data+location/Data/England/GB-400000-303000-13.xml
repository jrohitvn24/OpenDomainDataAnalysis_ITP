    We were very suprised to see that  
 over half of the people questioned    
 in our survey said they went to watch 
 a sport.                              
      By far the greatest number went  
 to watch football(soccer)the main foot
 ball teams(Walsall,Aston Villa,West. B
 rom.Birmingham,City and Wolves)play wi
 thin a radius of twenty miles from    
 Pelsall snooker was the second most po
 pular.This shows how much more popular
 snooker has become in 1985.           
                         The rest of th
 e sports mertioned by people were watc
 hed by only a few,This we felt,was    
 because there were not many cricket   
 teams,tennis tournaments,(swimming com
 petitions etc.
