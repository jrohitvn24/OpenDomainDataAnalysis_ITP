		<title>10PUBLIC HOUSES</title>
		<content> I live in the Martlett which is one of
 two public houses in the area.        
 Alcoholic and soft drinks are sold but
 alcoholic drinks are the most popular 
 especially Exmoor ale. My parents sell
 meals as well which includes          
 sandwiches of all kinds , snacks,steak
 and chicken in the basket and other   
 hot dishes. Food is not served on     
 Sundays. Six months ago a new skittle 
 ally was built with a bar. This has   
 made alot of extra work because the   
 ally is open four nights a week.      
 Private discos are run for weddings.  
 Our busiest day is Saturday.          
   The other pub at Holywell Lake also 
 sells drinks and food which includes  
 special meals for private parties .   
 Skittles is a popular game so they    
 also have a  skittle ally.
