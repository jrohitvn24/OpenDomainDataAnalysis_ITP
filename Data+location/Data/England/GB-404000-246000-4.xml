		<title>04The New Harvington By_Pass.</title>
		<content>   The By_Pass was made and finished in
 nineteen seventy five to stop the     
 heavy vehicles coming through the     
 village.It took nearly twelve months  
 to make and the people making it had  
 to buy about one hundred and fifty    
 acres of land. The by_pass is on the  
 Stratford to Evesham road. It goes    
 through the middle of the old         
 railway line which no longer exists.  
 The by_pass is also joined to Crest   
 Hill which connects it to the village.
 It caused a lot of fuss around the    
 village because of the land being     
 bought by compulsory purchase from the
 local people.It is now quieter in the 
 village except when there is an       
 accident and the road is closed.We    
 have done a traffic count, and in     
 twenty minutes 40 lorries,100 cars,12 
 vans,2 buses and 3 motor bikes went   
 past.We obviously needed it.          </content>
