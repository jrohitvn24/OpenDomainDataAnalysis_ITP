		<content> Rainbow School was built in 1981 for  
 profoundly handicapped children aged  
 2-19 who are taught by a vast input to
 all senses.This approach has been a   
 major  innovation for a group of      
 society who were institutionalized.   
 Here 8 nursery assistants, 8 teachers 
 and Headteacher, physiotherapist,     
 nurse, and domestic staff provide a   
 lively and stimulating atmosphere for 
 30 children in the school's brightly  
 lit and decorated rooms and corridors.
 The curriculum is divided into 5 main 
 elements:socialization;Motor;         
 Cognitive Skills;Self Care and        
 Communication.Each child works towards
 objectives within environments of     
 learning (Classroom, Water,Creative,  
 Community, and the Electronic where   
 the computer has a major impact.Many  
 individual successes have been made   
 here using parents as partners.       </content>
