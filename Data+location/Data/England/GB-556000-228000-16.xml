		<title>16Chickney, scientific vacuum</title>
		<content> Little in the way of advanced science 
 and technology touches the lives of   
 residents in the Chickney area. Most  
 farmers use modern machinery such as  
 combine harvesters, tractors, ploughs 
 and harrows and vacuum pipes for the  
 transferring of grain from farm       
 trailers to storage silos have been   
 installed at Pinewood Farm. Crop      
 spraying is done by the use of boom-  
 sprays fixed to tractors by aerial    
 methods. There is a radio station at  
 Sibleys, where work for the government
 takes place, part of which is the     
 relaying of Anglia Television         
 programmes to the areas north of      
 Essex. This station is connected to   
 the Post Office Tower in London.
