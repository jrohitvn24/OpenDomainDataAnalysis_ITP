		<content>{Shops.}In the 1930's the Allendale    
 Co-operative Society had three parts, 
 the main part which sold  the food,   
 the fruit shop which sold all of the  
 fruit,and the drapery which sold      
 clothes and kitchen equipment.The Post
 Office was built where Hutchinson's   
 fruit shop is now,which is next to    
 Allen house.There were two blacksmiths
 and there are none today.One was at   
 the top of the Peth where Allendale   
 Motor Company is now.There were two   
 cake shops Dicks cake shop and a small
 cake shop.The Fish and Chip shop was  
 behind Arnison Terrace at the back of 
 what is now the Gift shop.The Butchers
 is in the same place and is still     
 owned by the Co-op.The Chemist was in 
 the same building but at the end      
 nearest the Heatherlea Hotel.There was
 a cobblers but now you have to travel 
 to Hexham to get your shoes repaired. </content>
