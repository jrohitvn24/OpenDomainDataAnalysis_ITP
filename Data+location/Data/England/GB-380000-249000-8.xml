		<content> The region is undulating,poorly       
 drained,glacial till and river        
 alluvium,overlying the Triassic,      
 Keuper Marl between 16 metres and 55  
 metres above sea level.               
   The natural vegetation of deciduous 
 woodland has been restricted by       
 farming activities isolated woods and 
 coppices on steeper slopes,north      
 facing areas,or particulary poorly    
 drained land.                         
   Carey's Brook flows east into the   
 River Severn 1km East of Callow End.  
 The river Teme, 1 Km to the north,    
 also flows East into the River Seven. 
  Lowland pasture to the north and east
 of Powick and Callow End may be       
 subject to seasonal flooding.         
  It will be interesting to see the    
 effect the new roadway, that serves   
 the recently opened bridge over the   
 River Severn, has on flooding.        </content>
