{The Railway Station.}                 
 This is one of Yaxham's features will 
 a touch of history and trade. Although
 trains still run,they are for freight 
 only. The station is closed,but the   
 platforms and the land around them are
 now used by "Yaxham Light Railways".It
 is a narrow gauge railway with about  
 100 metres of track.                  
 It has six engines, four tipper       
 trucks and four flat trucks. This is a
 private concern, with the land owned  
 by British Rail.Extra steam engines   
 include a traction engine and steam   
 roller.
