		<content> Most farmers are tenants renting their
 farms from private landlords. Farms   
 rarely come up for let. Approximately 
 90% of the land is under plough with  
 10% down to permanent grass.          
 The mostly chalky bolder clay soil    
 grows good quality cereals. Crops     
 grown include winter wheat, winter    
 barley and oats with rotational break 
 crops of oil seed rape, tic beans and 
 a small quantity of potatoes and seeds
 for hay.                              
 Animals kept are pigs, sheep and store
 cattle; no dairy herds and no poultry.
 Some farms form part of a larger unit,
 units range from 200 to 1000 acres.   
 Each farmer owns a combine harvester, 
 a corn dryer and modern high-powered  
 tractors plus numerous other tools.   
 Hedges and dykes are kept neat and    
 tidy, the work mainly undertaken by   
 contractors.                          </content>
