		<title>16Grangetown Shopping Centre</title>
		<content>    We went to{Grangetown}to look at   
 its{shopping}centre. We noticed that  
 there was a wide range of shops. They 
 are mostly quite small - the biggest  
 is called Shoppers' Paradise and it is
 Grangetown's only{supermarket.        
    We found that there are two main   
 types of shops. There are{food}stores 
 like the butchers', the fruiterers'   
 and the take-aways; there are also    
 shops which provide a{service}like the
 post office, the banks, the building  
 societies and the garages.            
    The people of Grangetown do not    
 seem to know which they like best -   
 the cheaper prices of the supermarket 
 or the friendly atmosphere of the     
 dearer small shops. They do agree that
 they have a good shopping centre -    
 they have got plenty of{choice}and it 
 gives them a chance to have a natter  
 with their friends.                   </content>
