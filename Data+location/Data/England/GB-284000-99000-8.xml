		<content> PENNYMILL EGGS                        
 When we went to Pennymill eggs, we met
 Mr Brooks. There were 17000 chickens. 
 The chickens lay one to two eggs per  
 day. They have two pigs who eat the   
 dead chickens and the broken eggs off 
 the floor. The eggs were put on to a  
 grading machine and sorted into their 
 sizes and sent to all different       
 places.                               
 THE POST OFFICE.                      
 The owner of the post office is called
 Mrs Ford. She has worked in the Post  
 Office for 13 years. She sells almost 
 anything, but she sells mostly sweets 
 and newspapers. She opens the Post    
 Office at 9am and closes the Post     
 Office at 5.30pm. The mail is         
 collected twice a day.
