		<title>10TRANSPORT IN YATTON</title>
		<content>           Although off the            
  main Bristol to Western-super-Mare   
 road, Yatton's narrow High street is  
 always busy, mainly with traffic going
 to and from Clevedon and M5 motorway. 
 There are no parking restrictions,    
 which is a good thing for pedestrians,
 because the traffic is forced to slow 
 down by parked vehicles.In some       
 places the pavements are narrow and if
 a lorry passes you have to squeeze    
 back against the wall. Yatton has had 
 a railway station since 1841, and at  
 one time was an important junction for
 Clevedon,Cheddar and Blagdon.Although 
 the branch lines have closed, it is   
 still busy,being an Avon Link station 
 serving commuters to Weston and       
 Bristol .In 1985 several steam-hauled 
 trains went through Yatton to         
 Celebrate the 150th anniversary of the
 Great Western Railway.                </content>
