		<content>   There is a scene in the Bayeux      
 Tapestry where the English look with  
 astonishment at a star; they are      
 afraid it's a bad sign. In fact it is 
{Halley's Comet.                       
   In Florence there is a{fresco paint-
{ed by Giotto}in C13; Mr Finch says his
 daughter has seen it. The Wise Men are
 worshipping Jesus and in the sky is   
 the star they followed. It's the      
 Comet, and that's why a{spacecraft}has
 been named Giotto.                    
   This was launched in July, carrying 
 ten experiments. It is due to meet    
 Halley's Comet in{March 1986}and study
 the dust cloud and solar wind. It may 
 survive only a few hours.             
   Comets don't fit the normal pattern,
 so they have instilled gloom and doom.
   PS.{Christians}know their lives are 
 not ruled by 'stars'.                 
   PPS. It rained on{St Swithin's day}!</content>
