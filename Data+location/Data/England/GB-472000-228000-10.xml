		<title>10  Adstock Fields Farm</title>
		<content> Owned by Mrs Nicholson, the farm      
estate includes Hanover farm and land  
at Addington. Two dairy herds are kept,
oats, wheat and barley are grown and   
beef cattle are reared. Pigs are kept  
in fox covert where pheasants are      
reared. Fox hunting takes place in     
winter. 1 fox to 1000 acres is reckoned
to be enough.                          
 Glebe lands of Padbury and Adstock are
reuted,together with the larger one at 
Addington.Glebelaids were once part of 
the stipend of the vicar,who also      
collocted tithes from his parishoners. 
The magnificent title the barn still   
stands at Addington. Untill about 6    
years ago the rent for Addington glebe 
was paid to the vicar of Winslow,but   
now goes directly to the board of      
finance of the church of England.
