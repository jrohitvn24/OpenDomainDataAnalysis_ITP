		<content> Continued from Page 14                
 The{rhyne system}takes the water into 
 the main rivers. The 2 main drainage  
 rivers in the area are the{Axe}and the
{Brue,}both natural rivers.There is    
 also the{Huntspill River}which was cut
 during World War 2  to serve as a     
 relief channel for the Brue and to    
 supply the Royal Ordnance Factory at  
 Puriton with several million gallons  
 of water daily. There are several     
 man-made rivers, which take water from
 the rhynes to the main rivers,chief   
 ones being the{North Drain}in Teadham 
 Moor,the{South Drain}in the Burtle    
 area and the{Mark Yeo}which connects  
 the Axe and Brue flowing through      
 Rooksbridge,Mark (by the White Horse  
 Inn) and Yarrow. The{Wessex Water     
{Authority}are responsible for the     
 rivers and also charge rates. The     
 rivers discharge into the sea.        </content>
