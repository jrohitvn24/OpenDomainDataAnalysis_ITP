		<title>12Worcestershire Hunt Kennels</title>
		<content> The Worcestershire Hunt moved to      
 Fernhill Heath in 1806. The buildings 
 include lodges, stables, tack rooms,  
 flesh shed and the Long Room which is 
 used for meetings. There are also     
 houses for the hunt staff. Cub-hunting
 occurs from September to November     
 when fox hunting starts. The season   
 finishes in March, depending on the   
 weather and local farming policies.   
 Sixty couple of hounds are kept,      
 divided into dog and bitch packs. They
 are exercised twice daily by hunt     
 staff either on bicyles or horseback. 
 They are fed once a day. Carcasses are
 prepared for the hounds by the hunt   
 staff on the premises. Puppies are    
 sent to farms to be 'walked' at 10    
 weeks and start hunting at eighteen   
 months. Hunting is threatened by      
 pressure groups and modern farming    
 methods, housing and new roads.       </content>
