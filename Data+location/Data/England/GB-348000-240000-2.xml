		<title>02A CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content> I woke at 1/4 to 7. Mum &amp; Dad weren't 
 awake so I had a snooze. When Dad had 
 a wash I got in his place. Mum said,  
 'Keep still!' I had a chat with Dad   
 about school. He went to make the tea,
 Mum got up &amp; I had the bed to myself  
 till 7.30. After breakfast I got my   
 lunchbox. Mum put my bunches in... At 
 school I waited for Kate but she only 
 came after the 2nd whistle. After reg-
 ister, in assembly, Mr Smith gave out 
 swimming tapes. We did hard Maths off 
 the blackboard, &amp; played{Please Mr    
{Crocodile}at break for{Domesday.}Kate 
 fell over, she went to Miss &amp; had some
 cream on. After lunch, I showed every-
 one my swimming.We were late for play.
 Then I had to describe a{playground   
{game, 1-2-3-Handstand.}Mrs Wickes read
 out from Amy's history book about the 
{Old Domesday book}... In the evening I
 watched East Enders &amp; Give us a Clue. </content>
