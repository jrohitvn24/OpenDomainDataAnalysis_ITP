		<title>04Farming on Herm.</title>
		<content> Herm has a dairy farm which has one   
 of the biggest herds of dairy cows in 
 the Channel Islands. It is run by two 
 farmers.                              
 There are about eighty head of cattle 
 with fifty-five milkers. They give    
 about five hundred and forty litres of
 milk a day.                           
 Most of the milk is exported daily to 
 Guernsey. It is taken in milk churns  
 by boat to the Guernsey dairy where it
 is pasteurised. There are also bulls, 
 calves and heifers.                   
 Herm has about eighty acres of good   
 pasture all within close reach of the 
 farm, and another twenty acres of     
 brakes.                               
 11 acres can be irrigated. In summer  
 grass is cut for winter silage.       
 Hay and straw have to be imported, but
 the cows bed down happily on sand from
 a sand pit on the common.             </content>
