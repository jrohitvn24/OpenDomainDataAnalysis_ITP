		<title>05The Treborough Tip</title>
		<content>     {The old slate Quarry}at         {
 Treborough has long ceased been worked
 as a Quarry but is now fulfilling a   
 very different role in the life of the
 area.                                 
     It is now used as the main        
{Municipal Refuse Tip of the West      
{Somerset District Council. }Although  
 in many ways an ideal site it is not  
 without its problems.   The only      
 access to this tip is through the     
 narrow and winding{Roadwater Valley   
 and the residents of this village are 
 much{concerned by the heavy traffic.  
 This is of course especially true     
 in the height of the{holiday season   
 when there is a lot of refuse from the
 holiday camps to be disposed of.      
    With modern society producing such 
 a lot of rubbish the local Council is 
 now urgently engaged in seeking       
 another site for a refuse tip.        </content>
