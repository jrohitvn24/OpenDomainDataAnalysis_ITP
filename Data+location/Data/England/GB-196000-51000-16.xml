		<title>16Dairy Farming</title>
		<content> My name is Colin Ferkin and I live on 
 Nanphysick Farm - a dairy farm typical
 of this area.                         
 Our farm has got seventy-four cows and
 forty-nine calves. The cows are milked
 twice a day; early in the morning and 
 mid-afternoon. The cows give eight    
 hundred litres of milk a day. They are
 milked by electric machines and the   
 milk goes into a jar then travels     
 through pipes into a steel tank. Later
 a tanker collects the milk and it is  
 taken to Lostwithiel.                 
 My dad owns a hundred and thirty acres
 and he rents twenty acres. He grows:  
 thirty-two acres of arable silage     
 (barley, peas &amp; grass); fifty-one     
 acres of silage; eight acres of tyfon;
 thirty-eight acres for grazing; four  
 acres of hay; an acre of potatoes and 
 two acres of woodland.
