 This machine is also pulled by a      
 tractor. It collects the straw or hay 
 lying on the ground and binds it into 
 large, round bales. These are stored  
 in long stacks. The big bales are     
 easier to roll out as bedding or      
 winter feed for the animals.          
                                       
{The Low Ground Pressure Vehicle.}     
                                       
 This vehicle is made of lightweight   
 alluminium. It has eight wheels to    
 spread the weight. It is about 2.5m   
 long and very low.                    
 The cab is very small and has a       
 calculator in it to work out how much 
 of the field has been treated.        
 It is used when the ground is too wet 
 for a tractor to spray crops.
