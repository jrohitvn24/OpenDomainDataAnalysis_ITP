		<title>12The Miners' Strike</title>
		<content> In March 1984 there was a National    
 Strike called by the National Union of
 Miners.The reason for the strike was  
 the fear of many pit closures.Askern  
 Colliery was one of the collieries to 
 join the strike.The strike affected   
 not only the people who worked at the 
 pit but the majority of the population
 in one way or another.Many businesses 
 suffered along with the miners from   
 lack of money.During the strike there 
 was trouble in Askern and other       
 mining communities because of the     
 number of men returning to work which 
 caused picket line violence.The men   
 who broke the strike were called scabs
 they had violence shown not only to   
 themselves but to their families and  
 property.
