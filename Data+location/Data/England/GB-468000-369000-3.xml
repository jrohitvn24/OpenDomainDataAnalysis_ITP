		<title>03HOMES IN WALESBY</title>
		<content> Walesby has a population of around    
 1200, having more than doubled in size
 of the last 20 years. There have been 
 many new housing developments during  
 this time, mainly private housing with
 one local authority housing estate on 
 the site of the former Manor House. As
 a result of this building the village 
 has a cross-section of homes, indeed  
 the approximate figures are:          
   Semi-det. bungalows - 12%           
   Semi-det. houses    - 39%           
   Detached  bungalows - 27%           
   Detached  houses    - 22%           
 Despite the amount of new building    
 there are still a number of homes over
 100 years old, particularly in the    
 area around the Church on Main Street.
 There is very little stone work, most 
 of the houses are brick built.
