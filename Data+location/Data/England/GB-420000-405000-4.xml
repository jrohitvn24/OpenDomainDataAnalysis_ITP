		<title>04Farming in the Area.</title>
		<content> We found that in going through the    
 area to do the Domesday Survey that   
 most of the farms were involved in the
 production of milk. One farm ran the  
 local milk round, surving a large     
 proportion of Penistone and district. 
 This farm provides{green top milk }   
 which is untreated in any way. There  
 have been some doubts about the safety
 of this milk so pasturising equipment 
 has been bought.  Many people still   
 believe that untreated milk is the    
 best.                                 
 As a result of the new milk quotas    
 introduced throughout the Common      
 Market some farmers in the area have  
 pulled out of dairy farming and turned
 their land over to sheep or to arable 
 crops.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
