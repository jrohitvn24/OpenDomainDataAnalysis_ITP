		<content> This is one of the island's two main  
 hospitals.Here doctors treat patient's
 illnesses and nurses care for them.   
 X-rays are used to show the inside of 
 the body to see if bones are broken.  
 Endoscopes with a light on the end of 
 a flexible tube are used to see inside
 the stomach and the lungs. The        
 pathologist looks at cells of the body
 to check if they are diseased or not. 
 Blood samples are tested for          
 abnomalities.Surgeons are doctors who 
 operate to remove parts of the body   
 that are making people ill.Other      
 people help patients by exercising    
 their muscles and joints. They are    
 called physiotherapists. Some of the  
 buildings are very old but are        
 decorated to make them clean and      
 attractive. There is to be a new      
 bigger hopital in 1987.
