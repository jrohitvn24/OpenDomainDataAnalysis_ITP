		<title>20PROPOSED PRISON NEAR WHADDON</title>
		<content> The people at Tattenhoe and Whaddon   
 are worried that the proposed site for
 a prison at Milton Keynes is so near  
 the village. There was a meeting of   
 the Parish Council when the people    
 talked about it. They said that they  
 do not want the village to change.    
 Whaddon and Tattenhoe are rural       
 communities and a prison could make   
 the place different. Traffic through  
 the village could get much worse when 
 the prison is being built and after it
 is finished. The people of Whaddon and
 Tattenhoe enjoy living in a friendly  
 rural area, with the amenities of     
 Milton Keynes so near them, and they  
 do not want their way of life to      
 change. Living in this area does mean 
 that you need a car as there is only  
 one bus every Thursday morning to take
 the people to Bletchley for market    
 day.                                  </content>
