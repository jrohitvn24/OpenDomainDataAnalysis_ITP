		<content> In Holwell Hyde Lane we found a place 
 to fish.A man said that he went       
 fishing there about three times a     
 week.He found it very quiet and       
 peaceful.Further up there was a farm  
 with cows in the field.               
 The crop that is growing in the two   
 fields is barley.There were hedges    
 on either side of our walk;the path   
 was very grassy with two tracks.There 
 is also wildlife;we saw blackbirds,   
 butterflies and a fieldmouse.The area 
 has large fields with trees like oak  
 and hawthorn separating them.         
 Holwell Court farm is run by Mr       
 Davies.It is a tenant farm owned by   
 Redlands.The crops grown on it are    
 wheat ,barley ,oats and grass.Mr      
 Davies keeps most of his animals,     
 which are cows, in Hertford.His farm  
 covers 50 hectares,producing beef and 
 cereals.                              </content>
