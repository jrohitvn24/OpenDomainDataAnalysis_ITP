		<content>     I live in Poolhouse Rd.,Wombourne.
The house is called Carisbrooke. It is 
70 years old and is black and white    
with a gravel drive. Wombourne has new 
housing estates which were fields      
except for a row of houses where I     
live. Behind my house I have a field.  
It is protected greenbelt There is     
a new swimming pool at Ounsdale. My    
next door neighbour has a swimming     
pool. I have one brother,three dogs, a 
cat and a goldfish.  Sam.              
    I live in the country in The       
Hollybush Inn, at Ebstree. Around      
the pub are fields of crops and        
meadows. We own 6 acres of land.       
The pub was built in 1842. At the      
moment we have builders in who are     
knocking down walls and re-building.   
We have another  house at Perton. This 
used to be an airfield and an army     
base.   Glenn.                         </content>
