		<content>     After the Bronze Age the Romans   
 came in about 70A.D.giving a sharp    
 impulse to farming.They bred their    
 horses on the Wolds and the limestone 
 hills became sites for their villas   
 and farmsteads.Roman roads started to 
 cross the region.                     
     In Saxon/Norman times,in the      
 village itself there were twenty      
 farmers owning six teams of plough    
 oxen between them.King William's      
 decision to build a royal Motte and   
 Bailey Castle on the steep-sided site 
 to the north of the village green     
 ensured the continuance of Pickering  
 and changed the shape of the town.The 
 church is mentioned as existing from  
 the time of Edward the Confessor.     
     During the Middle Ages the area   
 was used extensively as a hunting     
 forest.                               
                                       </content>
