		<title>06WOODLANDS OF NORTH FAREHAM.</title>
		<content> There are about 12 copses in North    
 Fareham,varying in size from 0.5ha up 
 to 25ha.Chancellor's Copse typically  
 has a mixture of oak,silver birch,    
 beech,Scot's pine,ash,lime and        
 hawthorn.In some places the woods have
 been coppiced,i.e.the trees have been 
 cut right back to encourage much new  
 growth.Part of Dash wood is a         
 coniferous plantation;the wood from   
 here was once used to make log cabins.
 Locals use the public footpaths for   
 recreation such as country walks,     
 walking the dog,bmx bikes and         
 motorbike scrambling.The woods are    
 home for a great variety of wild      
 animals,especially deer,and birds.    
 Wickham Common,an area of unfenced    
 rough grassland,also has isolated     
 clumps of trees and shrubs.
