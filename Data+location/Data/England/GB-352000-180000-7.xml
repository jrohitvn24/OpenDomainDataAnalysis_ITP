		<content> The villagers of Hallen have formed a 
 preservation society mainly due to the
 opening of two rubbish tips in the    
 area. A total of 300 rubbish carriers 
 per day are using a road that was not 
 meant for such heavyweight vehicles   
 and which runs through the centre of  
 Hallen village. Add to this traffic   
 frequent oil tankers and heavy goods  
 lorries to Avonmouth and there is real
 cause for concern. However, it should 
 be mentiioned that the rubbish tips   
 are being filled in and with          
 landscaping they should look quite    
 pleasant when finished.
