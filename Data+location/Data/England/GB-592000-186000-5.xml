		<title>05GREAT WAKERINGS INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> APART FROM AGRICULTURE THE LARGEST    
 INDUSTRY IN THIS AREA IS BRICKMAKING. 
 THIS HAS BEEN A MAJOR INDUSTRY IN THIS
 AREA FOR THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS OR
 MORE.  THE MAIN WORKS AND DISTRIBUTION
 PLANT FOR THE ONE COMPANY NOW         
 OPERATING IS DOWN STAR LANE IN GREAT  
 WAKERING.  THE BRICKS USED TO BE MADE 
 TO THE NORTH OF THE VILLAGE AND       
 TRANSPORTED BY RIVER TO OTHER PARTS OF
 THE COUNTRY BUT NOW THE BRICKS ARE    
 TRANSPORTED BY ROAD.   THE BRICKS THAT
 WE MAKE AROUND HERE ARE LONDON STOCK  
 BRICKS AND THEY ARE YELLOW IN COLOUR  
 BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF SAND IN THE  
 BRICK EARTH THAT IS EXCAVATED.  THERE 
 IS A SMALL INDUSTRIAL ESTATE DOWN STAR
 LANE AND THE MOST POPULAR FORM OF     
 INDUSTRY ON THE ESTATE IS CAR REPAIR  
 AND MAINTENANCE.   THERE ARE ALSO     
 PRINTERS AND ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC
 COMPONENT MANUFACTURERS ON THE ESTATE.</content>
