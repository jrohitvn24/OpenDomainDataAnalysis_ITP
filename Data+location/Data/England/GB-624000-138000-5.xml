		<content>   The first bus to Dover comes through
 at 6.33am. A few people get on the    
 7.31am to go to work. The 8.00am buses
 to Dover and Folkestone are very busy 
 taking older children to Astor        
 Secondary School, both Dover Grammar  
 Schools, Folkestone School for Girls, 
 The William Harvey Grammar School and 
 Wingate School.                       
   The Primary School begins at 9.00am 
 for children from Capel and the       
 surrounding villages. In the Village  
 Hall the underfives arrive at their   
 playgroup.                            
   The postman, who drives a red car,  
 usually has his radio playing loudly. 
 There are two milkmen, from the Co_op 
 and Northern Dairies. People stop and 
 chat to their friends on their way to 
 the shops or whilst they are walking  
 their dogs. Then it is quiet again.
