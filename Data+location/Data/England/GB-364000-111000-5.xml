		<title>05TYPES OF HOUSING IN BLOCK</title>
		<content> The only concentration of population  
 in this block is in the village of    
 Longburton (population 300) the       
 remainder of the area being dotted    
 with farms consisting often of the    
 farmhouse and several farm cottages.  
 In Longburton which has developed     
 along the A352 road there are two     
 large farms (Manor Farm and Long      
 Burton Farm) and many of the houses   
 in the village are occupied by people 
 engaged in agricultural work.         
 In the l950s a small Council          
 development of 6 houses were built -  
 four of these have now been sold. In  
 the l970s two private developments    
 were built with 30 houses in the      
 biggest.  These houses are built of   
 reconstituted stone with tiled roofs. 
 Several houses in the area have       
 thatched roofs.
