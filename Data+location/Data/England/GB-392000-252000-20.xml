 Ladies Aston and Churchill.           
 There is a daily postal delivery and a
 post office in Upton Snodsbury.       
 There is a service of 'Meals on       
 Wheels' three times a week delivered  
 to elderly or infirm people whom      
 doctors think have need of it. Meals  
 are prepared in a central kitchen in  
 Pershore and delivered in specially   
 heated containers by volunteers.      
 There is no doctor's surgery in the   
 area, but patients are covered from   
 the group practices in neighbouring   
 towns.                                
                                       
 This survey was made by members of    
 Stoulton &amp; Wadborough Women's         
 Institute.
