		<title>17Leisure in 1985</title>
		<content>Today we have much leisure time. Most  
people only work for 8 hours a day ,   
sleep for 8 which leaves 8 hours for   
leisure.In that spare time there are a 
variety of pastimes to enjoy.One of    
the most popular is watching           
television.On average people watch 3   
hours television each day.Then         
there is the video recorder which      
allows people to watch videos of the   
most popular films or record their     
favourite television programmes.Many   
children have their own computers on   
which they play games.This has meant   
the cinema is not as popular,though    
people go sometimes.There are also     
outdoor activities including football  
,tennis,fishing and swimming.Adults    
pursue different pastimes.They go out  
to restaurants and local pubs.At       
weekends adults and children share     
leisure time on family outings         </content>
