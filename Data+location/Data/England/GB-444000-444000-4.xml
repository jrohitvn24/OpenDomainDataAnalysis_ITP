		<title>04      WIGHILL SCHOOL</title>
		<content>      The school at Wighill is the only
 school in the area.  It is for        
 children between the ages of 4 and 11.
  There was a school in the village    
 over a hundred years ago. At one time 
 children used to stay until they were 
 fourteen and as many as fifty children
 were crammed into the small lofty hall
 and tiny infant classroom.            
                                       
      The toilets were outside for the 
 children. Until 1978 the headteacher  
 lived at the attached school house.   
 West Riding County Council purchased  
 some adjacent land and built two      
 temporary classrooms with a big       
 playing field. We do lots of different
 subjects and go on often go on visits.
                                       
      There are 19 children altogether 
 and one teacher.
