		<content> Spring comes very early and many of   
 the usual spring flowers are out in   
 so-called mid winter in this area.    
 The walks across the area are superb  
 in natural beauty and are renowned for
 their peacefulness.                   
 Stretching along the coastline are    
 some of the most attractive beaches to
 be found anywhere on the Island. Each 
 offering a quiet and relaxing area    
 where the natural beauty is all       
 around.                               
 Adjoining the Botanic Gardens is      
 Steephill Cricket club and ground set 
 in a sheltered amphitheatre and much  
 higher adjoining Rew Down is Ventnor  
 golf course.                          
 Nearer Ventnor is Ventnor Park set out
 with as little change to nature as    
 necessary to provide terraced walks   
 with marvellous views. The Park also  
 incorporates an 18 hole putting green.</content>
