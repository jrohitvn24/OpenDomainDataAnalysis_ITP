		<title>11The Hobbit Play</title>
		<content> Sennen School went to watch the Hobbit
 Play at the Minack Open Air Theatre.  
 In the morning we went to the workshop
 to do some games which were like the  
 Hobbit Play.The man said "Pretend you 
 are stuck in a marsh."                
   After we had lunch we went to watch 
 the Hobbit and Jenny took a photo of  
 us.One of the Trolls came up to us and
 looked in our bags.Then the big dragon
 came out and there was smoke coming   
 out of his mouth and he looked        
 ferocious and roared at Bilbo and     
 Gandalf .They both ran away then the  
 dragon went back to his cave.Then the 
 dwarves came and sang a jolly song and
 they ate a meal.  Bilbo came back and 
 sat down and smoked his pipe The black
 birds came to send a mesage to Gandalf
 that the dragon was dead.We enjoyed   
 our day at the Minack very much.
