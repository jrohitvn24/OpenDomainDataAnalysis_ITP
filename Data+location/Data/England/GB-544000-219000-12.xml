		<title>12 A THORLEY COMMUTER</title>
		<content>The Thorley area of Bishop's Stortford 
has become a dormitory suburb for      
London.One commuter moved to Thorley   
from Manchester in 1984.He is a Fleet  
Street journalist working for The      
Express.When he started commuting to   
London he drove to Epping,parked at the
station &amp; went by underground train.   
This cost 420p per day plus petrol and 
took half an hour longer than his      
present journey.Now when he is on day  
shift his wife drives him to the       
station at 7.30am.A day return costs   
730p but it is not always worthwhile   
buying a 2400p weekly ticket because   
sometimes he only has to travel to work
on 2 days a week.If he is on night     
shift he drives all the way via the M11
He finds commuting expensive &amp;         
sometimes frustrating when Fleet Street
buses &amp; Liverpool Street trains are    
late.                                  </content>
