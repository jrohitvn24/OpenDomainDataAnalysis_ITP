		<content> The first house on this site was built
 about 180 years ago.  The original    
 building was 3 storeys high but fire  
 destroyed the top floor which was     
 never replaced.  Last year an         
 extension was added which took 8      
 months to build.  One part of the     
 house is Victorian and the rest       
 Georgian.  The roof of the Victorian  
 part is pitched and tiled, the rest of
 the roof is flat.  The house has 21   
 rooms and bells for Room Service are  
 still in working order.  There are 17 
 acres of land around the house, these 
 include an orchard, a 2 acre paddock  
 where the owners ponies are kept and a
 very large garden. There is an area of
 mature mixed woodland close to the    
 house and long drives provide access  
 to the lanes.Outhouses include        
 6 stables, a garage, a coach house and
 a barn.                               </content>
