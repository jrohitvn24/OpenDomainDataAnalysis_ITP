		<title>03The Cliffs</title>
		<content>If you go to the South end of the      
village you can walk along the cliffs. 
Here is the most easterly farm in the  
British Isles. You will notice the     
wooden sea defences along the beach    
preventing coastal erosion.You can     
still see the remains of cottages which
have fallen into the sea.Beach angling 
is very popular along this strip of    
coast during winter months, as is      
fishing from small boats. The species  
most commonly caught are cod,whiting,  
and dabs.                              
There are a number of different birds  
to be seen along this coast.Among those
to look out for are - sand martins     
black-headed gulls, herring gulls,     
little terns, common tern, dunlins,    
guillimots, oyster catchers, skylarks, 
yellow hammers, goldfinches, kestrels, 
swallows, house martins and lapwings.
