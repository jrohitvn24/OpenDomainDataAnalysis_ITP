		<title>20Cockermouth Mechanic's Band</title>
		<content> The Band was formed in 1825, and was  
 then one of three town bands.  After  
 varying fortunes, the Band was        
 reformed in 1967 and now has over     
 twenty-five members. The instruments  
 played include the trombone, cornets, 
 baritone and tenor horns, flugohorn   
 and euphonium.                        
 The Band rehearses twice-weekly and   
 performs regularly in Cockermouth and 
 the district.  The Band has performed 
 in Marveljols (twinned town) and will 
 be performing there again in 1986.    
 The members pay an annual             
 subscription.                         
 The Band traditionally leads the      
 annual Cockermouth Carnival in June of
 each year.                            
 When first founded the Band was for   
 'mechanics' from the many small       
 industries found in Cockermouth.
