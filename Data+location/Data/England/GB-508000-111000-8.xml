		<content>{Sullington and Chantry Lane Areas}    
 Interesting buildings in Sullington   
 include Sullington manor Farm, which  
 is the only listed building.  It is   
 early eighteenth century with a       
 central core, possible thirteenth     
 century. Its tithe barn is one hundred
 and fifteen feet long, reputedly      
 restored in 1685.  Chantry Mill, now a
 residential unit, was formerly a      
 working corn mill, believed to be of  
 medievel origin.  Chantry House, a    
 late eighteenth century farmhouse with
 Victorian additions, takes its name   
 from the small stone building in the  
 grounds which was consecrated by a    
 former owner who was led to safety    
 over the Downs by the sound of a      
 Church bell through the fog.          
 Waterfall Cottage, now a very         
 attractive house, was once a "fulling 
 mill".                                </content>
