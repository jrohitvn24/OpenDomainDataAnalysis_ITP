		<title>16RECREATION - THE CANAL</title>
		<content>   The canal is now used as a{Country  
{Park.}From the basin in Canal Hill the
 first mile is lined either side by    
 houses. Many of the occupants own     
{boats}or canoes. Motorised vessels are
 not allowed. Nine year old children   
 are given the opportunity to go       
 canoeing from school.                 
   The tow path is used by people for  
{leisure}and{exercising their dogs.    
 This causes problems as the path is   
 left fouled by the dogs.              
   The{bank}is full of wild flowers and
 birds, whilst the water supports fish,
 frogs and water fowl.                 
   Two{barges}drawn by shire horses    
 carry{passengers}several miles along  
 the canal. They are decorated         
 traditionally with flowers and castles
 although one has the Tiverton coat of 
 arms painted on it.
