		<title>05Landscape of Malhamdale</title>
		<content> The landscape is very rural and is    
 dominated by the limestone bedrock.It 
 is interspersed with dry stone        
 walls.Farmhouses are scattered at     
 regular intervals parallel to the     
 road,especially between Kirkby Malham 
 and Airton.                           
 Some of the stone-built cottages date 
 back to the 17th century,and many     
 barns are older still.Most houses are 
 large by modern standards.            
{Airton}developed around a village     
 green,and by the River Aire there,an  
 old wool-spinning mill has been       
 converted into flats.{Scalegill Mill},
 another disused wool-spinning mill by 
 the river near Kirkby Malham,has also 
 been converted into holiday cottages  
 and flats.
