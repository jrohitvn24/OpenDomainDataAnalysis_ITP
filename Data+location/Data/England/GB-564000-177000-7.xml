		<content> At{West Tilbury}stands the            
 Norman-towered church of St. James.It 
 is an attractive small church of{flint
 and has a fascinating graveyard       
 bearing witness to the hard times of  
 the last century. The tower is no     
 longer safe and the small congregation
 has been absorbed by nearby           
 St.Catherine in East Tilbury.         
  St. Mary's stands at the top of the  
 hill next to the crossroads in {      
{Chadwell}St.Mary.Similar in style to  
 St. James it still has a thriving     
 congregation.                         
 There is also a Pentecostal Church in 
 Chadwell,and a cemetery chapel.There  
 is a Methodist Chapel in Linford, and 
 also the small, rather box-like modern
 Church called St.Francis.The          
 Bata-estate part of East Tilbury has  
 no church but people attend those in  
 Linford or East Tilbury Village.      </content>
