		<title>10Shopping, for Harberton</title>
		<content> There is not a shop or post office    
 within the whole 12Km. square.        
 The village is served by a travelling 
 butcher and fish monger once a week.  
                                       
 Most families shop for bulk food items
 fortnightly or monthly at out of town 
 super stores, day to day items are    
 purchased from Totnes, although many  
 comment on the problem of parking in  
 Totnes in the town. The lack of a post
 office means that pensioners without  
 their own transport find difficulty in
 collecting pensions, prescriptions and
 shopping.                             
 The gardener is catered for we have a 
 garden centre on the main road, which 
 is on the very outskirts of the       
 village.
