  There are many small streams which   
 flow from the bottom of the chalk     
 hills in our area. The main river     
 however is the River Frome which flows
 from West to Easy through Bradford    
 Peverell, skirting Charminster and    
 flowing through Dorchester on it's    
 Northern boundary.                    
  Along the Frome are lush watermeadows
 and quite large herds of cows graze;  
 mostly black and white Freisians.     
  The other river is the River Cerne   
 which flows from the hills near Cerne 
 Abbas through Charminster. It then    
 passes along the watermeadows parallel
 with the A37 before joining the Frome 
 at the bottom of the Grove in         
 Dorchester, just by Grey's Bridge.The 
 rivers are clean with moorhens,ducks  
 and a great variety of wildlife.
