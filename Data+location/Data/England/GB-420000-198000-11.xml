		<content>{BOY} Fishing is my main hobby. I      
 usually go fishing for pike. As well  
 as fishing I like flying model        
 aeroplanes. I also enjoy swimming. I  
 like walking and cross country        
 running. I do other sports like       
 football, cricket and table tennis.   
{GIRL}Sometimes in my spare time I go  
 for cycle rides with my dad. On other 
 occasions I play softball with dad in 
 our back garden. On Wednesday evenings
 I go to guides. At the weekends I     
 usually play with my friends. Other   
 things which I enjoy include knitting,
 sewing and drawing.                   
{HEADMASTER}With a wife and three sons 
 of primary school age there is little 
 spare time for one who is a priest    
 (non-stipendiary) as well as a        
 teacher. However, a large garden and  
 an allotment provide recreation and   
 much needed exercise.                 </content>
