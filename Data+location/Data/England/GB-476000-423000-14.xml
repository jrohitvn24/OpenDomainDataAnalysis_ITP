		<content> In our{village}there is a{church}and  
 next to the{church}is our{vicarage}   
 where the{vicar}lives.Every year in   
 the summer there is a{Garden Party}   
 where all the people are invited from 
 the  village.There are{games}run by   
 children in the front{garden}of the   
 vicarage.In the back {garden}there are
 tables and chairs where you can relax 
 and have a wonderful time.There are { 
{raffles, tombolas,white elephants}    
 and{cake stalls.}It is all very       
 exciting.You can eat and drink but you
 have to pay for it.At the end,to get  
 things cleared,every thing goes down  
 in price.So instead of{drinks         
{of orange }being ten pence it is five 
 pence and {ice cream}the same.Lots of 
 people come a{hundred}or more.When it 
 was about {5 o'clock}it was ending and
 people were going{home.
