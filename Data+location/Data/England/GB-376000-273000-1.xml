 (pop.9500) situated on the River      
 Severn and set in a valley of tree    
 covered hills and farmland. Its name  
 originates from{"Beau Lieu"}Beautiful 
 Place. The graceful bridge which leads
 into the main street was built by     
{Thomas Telford}in 1798. Much of the   
 West Midlands holiday traffic passes  
 over the bridge, for Bewdley is still 
 the{gateway to Wales.}The river is    
 very popular with fishermen because of
 the good fishing and unspoilt scenery.

{Railway.}Steam trains run from        
 Kidderminster to Bridgenorth. On the  
 outskirts of the town is the{West

 in 1972 by Chipperfield's. Bewdley is
