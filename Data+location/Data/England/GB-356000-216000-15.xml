   Red Rover is a game played with two 
 equal teams .The two sides stand so   
 that they are parallel .Then the first
 side says "Red Rover, Red Rover we    
 want ", and they choose one of the    
 other team's people.This person then  
 runs over to the other side .If this  
 person breaks through the chain he    
 takes one of this sides players back  
 to his side. If he doesn't break      
 through he has to stay on their       
 side.This goes on until one team runs 
 out of team members.
