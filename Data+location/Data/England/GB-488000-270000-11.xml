 At half past five in the morning the  
post-lady gets up,she has to be at the 
Post Office by 6.15am. There are five  
other people working at the Post       
Office.                                
 At 6.30am she begins sorting the mail 
and delivering the parcels at about    
7.30am.It may be 30 to 40 parcels a    
day. She travels about 10 miles a day  
but can use a bike, sometimes she uses 
her car. She delivers to all parts of  
Finedon and finishes at about 10.30am. 
 She likes being a post-lady because   
when she gets up she enjoys the weather
and the birds singing. She has to work 
six days a week, having Sundays off and
four weeks holiday a year, plus the    
Bank Holidays.                         
 In her spare time she does knitting,  
sewing tatting and reading.
