		<title>01GREAT LONGSTONE AND DISTRICT</title>
		<content>{Great Longstone} is in the Peak       
 District National Park just north of  
 the Market town of Bakewell.          
 In 1985 the population of the village 
 is approx 984. The hamlets of Little  
 Longstone, Rowland and Monsal Dale    
 surround the village. The Village of  
 Ashford in the Water is close by.     
 In the Village of Great Longstone     
 there are approx 300 houses, dating   
 from the conquest to the present day. 
 In the past lead mining and quarrying 
 has taken place, especially in the    
 Longstone Edge area.                  
 The area is now mostly farmland with  
 the exception of the Thornhill's      
 Country Produce Factory.              
 Plans have been put forward to build  
 34 new houses which will be 'starter  
 homes' and elderly persons houses.    
 Monsal Head is one of the most popular
 tourist attractions in the area.      </content>
