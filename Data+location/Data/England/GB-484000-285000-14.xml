		<content> To the north of the Danesholme        
 estate,and to the west of the         
 Kingswood estate there is an area of  
 ancient woodland called{Kingswood.    
{Kingswood}was once part of{Rockingham 
{forest.}The wood was left when  Corby 
 was built,the wood was left on        
 purpose.                              
   The wood is very useful as it is    
 full of old trees such as oak,ash,    
 hazel etc.There are also two ponds    
 which have frogs and toads in them as 
 well as insect nymphs and larvae.     
   It is also possible if you look very
 carefully to find evidence that owls  
 feed there during the nights (owl     
 pellets).                             
   Kingswood is completely surrounded  
 by houses.Children often play in rhe  
 woods,although some parents will not  
 let their children go there.
