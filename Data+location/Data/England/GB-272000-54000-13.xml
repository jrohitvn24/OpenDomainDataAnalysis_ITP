		<title>13CONSERVATION IN DIPTFORD</title>
		<content> The Devon Tree Bank is a campaign to  
 help preserve {trees}. Diptford       
 Primary School is helping the Diptford
 Tree Society with the upbringing of   
 saplings, which are then planted in   
 areas around the parish. The four     
 seasons which for so long have been   
 associated with agriculture are now   
 reduced to two, with the loss of      
 Spring and Autumn. Our area has a wet 
 but reasonably warm  climate  which is
 influenced by Dartmoor.There are still
 ancient {footpaths }which provide     
 receational walks.  Many footpaths are
 disappearing because people today     
 prefer to reach their destination by  
 other means of transport. In Diptford 
 we are concerned that our{environment}
 should remain unpolluted. Litter is a 
 constant problem and every effort is  
 made to educate people to take their  
 litter home.Here the air is fresh.    </content>
