		<content>{British Rail}want to close this famous
 line. People all over the world have  
 been trying to save the line from     
 closure. They want it to stay open    
 because it is an{historic}line. In the
 past when it was being built people   
 risked their lives for the line. If it
 was closed down there would be 6 yrs  
 of labour for nothing and hundreds of 
{lives lost}for nothing too.           
   The line also passes through some of
 the most{beautiful scenery}in Britain.
  {Local people}use the line to{visit  
{relatives, go shopping}and to get to  
 the{hospital}though this is difficult 
 with{only four trains each day.       
   A problem for{British Rail}is that  
 the{Ribble Head Viaduct}needs millions
 of pounds spending on it to repair    
 it. There are not enough people using 
 the line to pay for this.
