		<content> A minority of the population attend a 
 place of worship. In Kilkhampton there
 is an Anglican Church with a resident 
 rector, a Methodist Chapel served by  
 the Bude circuit ministry, and a      
 "Fellowship" Chapel with a resident   
 minister. There is also a Methodist   
 Chapel at Bush and Grimscott. If asked
 to state their religion, it has been  
 estimated that twelve households would
 claim to belong to the Methodist      
 Church, six to The Church of England  
 and one Roman Catholic. The other six 
 households are not believed to attend 
 any place of worship.
