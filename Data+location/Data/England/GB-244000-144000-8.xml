		<content>     Tourism is nowadays the main      
 source of employment in this area.    
 Both in Mortehoe, and particularly in 
 Woolacombe with its long sandy beach, 
 catering for the holidaymaker during  
 the few short weeks of the summer     
 season is the chief concern of the    
 majority of the local people.         
     In the main the impact of tourism 
 has been well-controlled: the caravan 
 sites are well-situated and are       
 generally screened with trees;        
 facilities which have been provided   
 for holidaymakers on the camp sites,  
 such as swimming pools, are not       
 obtrusive; and the small number of    
 shops and cafes catering to their     
 needs are generally open all year     
 round for the benefit of local people.
 On the whole, the rural atmosphere is 
 being retained very effectively.
