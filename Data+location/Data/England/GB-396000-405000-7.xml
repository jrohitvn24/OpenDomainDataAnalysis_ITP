		<content> cattle. The Collings farm, for        
 example, has 110 acres with only 8 for
 good quality grazing. 80 cattle,      
 mainly Friesian, are kept and the only
 product sold is unpasteurised milk.   
   The area is crossed by{two important
{roads.}There is Thurston Clough Road  
 which was the original main road      
 crossing the Pennines in this area in 
 the{last century.}Today it is a narrow
 country lane with very little traffic.
 There is also the{A62}which replaced  
 the previous road as the main trans - 
 Pennine route from Leeds to           
 Manchester. This has in turn been     
 eclipsed by the M62 so that today it  
 is mainly used as commuter route into 
 Oldham and Manchester.                
   There is a continuing problem of    
{heavy traffic}passing through the     
 hamlet near the Old Original public   
 house to the quarry and tip.          </content>
