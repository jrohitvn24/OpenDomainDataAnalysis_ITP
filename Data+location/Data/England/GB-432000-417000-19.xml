		<title>19Memories of Wakefield (cont)</title>
		<content> Famous people in Wakefield this       
 century are the novelists{George      
{Gissing and David Storey} and the     
 sculptress{Barbara Hepworth.}The two  
 main buildings to have been extended  
 are{Wakefield Prison}which now houses 
 many IRA convicts,and{Pinderfields    
{Hospital}which is famous for its burns
 unit.The past twelve months has seen  
 major development in the towh centre  
 with the building of the{Ridings      
{Centre}which has been voted the best  
 European indoor shopping centre.      
 Having lived in Wakefield for sixty   
 years the ex-deputy head of our school
 says that the three major things to   
 have had an impact on her life would  
 be,personally, the invention of       
 televisison,and,less personally,space 
 travel and the micro-chip.One wonders 
 what replies will be fifty years      
 hence.                                </content>
