		<title>06FARMING TODAY</title>
		<content> The farm land in this area is mostly  
 owner occupied. The main crops are    
 Barley and Wheat with Oil Seed Rape   
 and Sugar Beet as break crops. Some   
 farmers keep beast, one keeps sheep   
 and there are 2 Egg and Chicken       
 stations. There are now no Cows       
 milked at all. There are 7 working    
 farms now and all of them have land in
 other areas. One is a depot for       
 Potatoes although there is hardly any 
 grown in this area. Most of the farm  
 workers are only Part Time, working in
 the harvesting of the crop and        
 cultivating and drilling of the next. 
 There are only a few Full Time workers
 now because of the bigger tractors and
 machines doing more work. Chemical    
 spraying and Straw Burning is carried 
 out although farmers are becoming more
 aware of Conservation and Tree        
 Planting is taking place.             </content>
