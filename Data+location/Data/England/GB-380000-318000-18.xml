		<title>18Gnosall Carnival</title>
		<content>  Gnosall Carnival is held once a year 
around June. A parade of floats and    
people in fancy dress parade from the  
Oak public house to St. Lawrence school
grounds, where the competition for the 
best float is held.                    
  In St. Lawrence school grounds there 
are fairground rides and mini train    
rides around the school playground. In 
the centre of the school playground    
there is a pram race and dancing.      
  There is a refreshment tent and many 
other stalls and games. Many village   
organisations are involved, including  
the St. John's Ambulance Brigade, the  
Mothers' Union, local churches and     
school P.T.A.'s and local businesses.  
  The carnival involves people in a lot
of hard work but it is all worthwhile  
because it brings the whole community  
together to enjoy themselves and raises
money for St. Lawrence's Restoration.  </content>
