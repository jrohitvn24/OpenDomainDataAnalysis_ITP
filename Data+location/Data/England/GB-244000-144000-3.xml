		<title>03MORTEHOE CHURCH</title>
		<content>     The church of St Mary's in the    
 centre of Mortehoe dates from 1109,   
 though most of the church was built in
 the 13th century.  It has Norman      
 arches and a fine barrel roof.  It was
 restored in 1857, and the lych gate   
 was added in 1886. The original bells 
 of 1432 were recast in 1926.  At one  
 time the vicarage was Easewell, now a 
 farm.  The list of Clergy of St Mary's
 dates back to 1258; the last incumbent
 died in May 1984.  In 1985 Mortehoe   
 church became part of the Ilfracombe  
 Team Ministry.  The Electoral roll is 
 currently under revision and will be  
 about 15-20 people.  Services are held
 at 6.30 pm each Sunday evening,       
 average attendance being 12.  Current 
 works in hand are a new heating boiler
 and repair work on the lych gate.
