		<content>      The area takes its name from     
 associations with the medieval magnate
{John O'Gaunt.}However, the area is    
 very much a product of the 19th and   
 20th centuries. To the north-east of  
 the{A639 Pontefract Road}the area     
 consists of a mixture of{privately    
{owned houses}and{council houses.}To   
 the south-west of the road the        
 buildings are mainly{factories}and    
{warehouses,}doubtless attracted by    
 easy access to the national motorway  
 network.                              
      John O'Gaunts stands on high     
 ground overlooking the valley of the  
{River Aire}and it is possible to      
 obtain good views of the area of the  
 survey. The most prominent features   
 are the{Yorkshire Imperial Metals     
 factory,{Skelton Grange power station 
 and{Temple Newsam}park.
