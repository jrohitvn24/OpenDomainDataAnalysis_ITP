		<title>09SANDBANKS TOLL FERRY</title>
		<content>    Studland Ferry runs from{Sandbanks}
 to{Shellbay},which is about 500m .Its 
 75p for cars and 25p for one person.  
 .The ferry holds about 30 cars.It is  
 powered by a Diesel-Electric motor    
 which drives two winches to pull the  
 ferry back and forth along two iron   
 chains. It takes about 10 minutes to  
 get across. The trouble ferries mainly
 have is when the chains break and they
 drift away!.(This last happened in    
 1984.) If cars go too fast and it's   
 wet they may skid off the edge.Parking
 28 cars 4-abreast close together leads
 to a few dents, especially when       
 drivers forget the handbrake and the  
 sea is rough.The worst problem in the 
 summer is the queue on the Studland   
 side which may reach over a mile in   
 length and mean a delay of two hours  
 and more before the journey home can  
 really begin.                         </content>
