		<content>     It is 8.30 on a{Saturday morning} 
 when I leave home to go swimming with 
 my brother and friend at the pool in  
 Tenbury Wells, where my Mum works. We 
 return home for lunch. In the         
 afternoon, I help my brother do his   
 paper round. My Mum arrives home at   
 about 18.15. My Dad races pigeons, so 
 at about 19.00, he and my brother go  
 to pigeon club. During the evening, I 
 watch T.V or go out to play.          
                                       
     On a{Sunday morning,}my family    
 have a lie in. We get up at about     
 9.30. I make breakfast, then Ifeed my 
 pets, and help Mum get dinner and     
 tidy up. We have a roast dinner at    
 12.45. In the afternoon, my Dad tends 
 the pigeons while Mum gardens. We go  
 to my Nans for tea. We return home at 
 20.45 and I am in bed by 21.45.
