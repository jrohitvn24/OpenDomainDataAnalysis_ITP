		<title>13CIDER FARM</title>
		<content> Mr.Churchward has owned the farm for  
 38 years.It is a family concern       
 employing seven people.The apples,    
 picked from the orchards,are cruched  
 in a mill to form a pulp.The pulp is  
 spread three inches thick in a three  
 foot square frame.It is wrapped in    
 cheese cloth.Fourteen cheeses are     
 placed on top of each other.They are  
 then pressed using a hydraulic press  
 _ one and a half tons per square inch.
 The juice then ferments in stainless  
 steel or fibre glass tanks.           
 Before cloth,straw was used and a     
 screw press,turned by horses,was used 
 instead of a hydraulic press.         
 The cider is sold locally.            
 Mr.Churchward has won many prizes for 
 his cider.

         Gareth,Samantha and Tomeaka.
