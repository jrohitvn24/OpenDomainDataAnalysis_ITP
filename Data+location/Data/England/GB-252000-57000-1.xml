		<title>01   BORINGDON AND NEWNHAM</title>
		<content>   This area lies to the north of      
 Plympton.It is an area that can be    
 divided into four distinct zones,the  
 forests,the farmland,the residential  
 and the industrial zone.              
   Cann Wood to the north is managed by
 the Forestry Commission.Newnham Deer  
 Park forest is privately owned.Moving 
 south there is farmland.It is mainly  
 put to crops or pasture.In the south  
 are the residential areas of Woodford 
 and Boringdon.In the south east is    
 part of the Newnham Industrial Estate.
   Historically the area is based      
 around two large estates.             
   The lands of Boringdon were granted 
 to Plympton Priory by King Edgar      
 (957-975),and remained that way until 
 the dissolution in 1534.              
   Old Newnham was first recorded as   
 the residence of Simon de Plympton at 
 the end of the 13th centuary.         </content>
