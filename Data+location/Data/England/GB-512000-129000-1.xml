		<title>01BROADBRIDGE HEATH AREA</title>
		<content>   Broadbridge Heath is a{newly        
{developed area.}It used to be a quiet 
 village with a busy main road running 
 through.Now it is a very populated but
 practically traffic free village.This 
 has happened mainly because of the    
 building of the{new by-pass.}The      
 village is growing all the time.{New  
{houses}are still being built which    
 means that the village is increasing  
 in population.                        
   The development of the{industrial   
{estate}is increasing slowly. A{new    
{hypermarket}will be built which will  
 be more convenient for the villagers. 
 There is a{small Sports Centre}and a  
 new Happy Eater restaurant for        
 travellers next to a large garage.    
   The noticable aspects of the        
 countryside to the west of the village
 are the number of{sheep farms}and the 
 fields of{rape.}                      </content>
