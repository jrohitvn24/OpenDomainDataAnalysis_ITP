		<title>04PARWICH PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The village school is built out of    
 limestone and is often mistaken for   
 for a chapel because of it's design.  
 About 55 children attend the school   
 aged from 4 to 11, after which they   
 attend the Queen Elizabeth School in  
 Ashbourne.                            
                                       
 For a small village this is a healthy 
 number on roll and is the result of a 
 number of new properties that have    
 built in the village.                 
                                       
 On 31 August l985 Mrs. Birch retired  
 after 28 years at the school. Such    
 long service at one school is becoming
 less common.
