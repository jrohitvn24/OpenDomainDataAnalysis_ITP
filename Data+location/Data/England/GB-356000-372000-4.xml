		<title>04Heavy Horses At Home Farm</title>
		<content>  Mr. Posnett of Home Farm, Norley     
 breeds heavy horses.  He breeds Shire 
 horses and Clydesdales.  He began the 
 business approximately 12 years ago   
 when he finished with his dairy herd, 
 and is one of the countries heavy     
 horse enthusiasts.                    
  He has 8 Shires and the same number  
 of Clydesdales. In addition he has a  
 hunter and its foal.  He specializes  
 in showing and breeding his heavy     
 horses, and tells us that the big feet
 are a sign of good quality in these   
 horses.  The head of the Clydesdale is
 broader than that of the Shire, and   
 also has broader 'pancake feet'.      
  Mr. Posnett exports some of his heavy
 horses, usually by air from London or 
 Prestwick to South Africa, Canada and 
 America.
