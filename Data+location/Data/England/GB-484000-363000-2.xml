		<content> The Eagle Hall Gamekeeper looks after 
 four thousand pheasants each year.When
 wild birds start laying in April eggs 
 are collected three or four times a   
 day.The eggs are stored and placed in 
 incubators once a week.Here they stay 
 for three weeks and for the last four 
 days are transfered to the hatchers.  
 When the chicks hatch they are moved  
 to large sheds where they are put     
 under gas or electric heaters to keep 
 them warm.Here they stay for five or  
 six weeks before they are released    
 into The Great Low Wood at Eagle Hall.
 While hatching is taking place in the 
 Spring and early Summer vermin such as
 foxes, rats, stoats and weasles have  
 to be caught.These preditors if left  
 unchecked would eat the young         
 pheasant chicks when they were        
 released into the wild.
