		<title>19Paint Factory</title>
		<content> The TKS paint factory is the largest  
 of the few factories in Cuxton; it has
 been manufacturing paint for about 30 
 years. The paint is used for          
 protecting surfaces and making things 
 look nice. Most of the paint made here
 is sold to industry, especially the   
 public service industries and to local
 authorities. The yellow paint used on 
 mechanical diggers, and other         
 road-making machines, is made by TKS. 
 The paint is manufactured from powders
 called pigments, and chemicals blended
 with resins, oil or water in ball     
 mills which produce a smooth creamy   
 mixture. The factory makes about 4,000
 litres of paint a day, and as the     
 materials used in making paint can be 
 dangerous to health, the people who   
 work there have to wear protective    
 clothing. Of the 80 people working for
 the company about 40 live in Cuxton.  </content>
