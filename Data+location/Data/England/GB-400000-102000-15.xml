		<title>15FARMING AT HIGHER HONEYBROOK</title>
		<content>{Higher Honeybrook}is approximately 300
 years old and is now used mainly for  
 dairy farming. The cows are a well    
 bred stock of 100 fresians, 40        
 Herefords and two stock bulls. Weather
 often causes problems for Mr Strobelt 
 the farmer and the cows. Before now   
 the milk tanker has been unable to    
 reach the farm due to deep snow; all  
 the milk was stored in tanks,         
 dustbins-anything they could find.    
 Also in the winter the pipes freeze   
 over and have to be thawed before     
 milking can start. The cows are milked
 first thing in the morning and in the 
 late afternoon.                       
      Land surrounding the farm is     
 approximately 250 acres and let by Mrs
 Gibson, the owner of High Hall.
