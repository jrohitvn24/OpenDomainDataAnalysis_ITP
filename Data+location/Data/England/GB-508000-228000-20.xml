		<content> We measured temperature and rainfall  
 each day between the dates shown. The 
 Spring this year was late and         
 unusually cold.                       
{TEMPERATURE _}17 April to 23 May 1985 
 Highest 25c  Lowest 8c  Average 15c.  
{RAINFALL _}13 June to 17 July, daily. 
 Most _ 80mm  Average 12.3mm.  No rain 
 fell on 25 days during this period.   
{Children from the Junior class of     
{Hexton School}collected their         
 information about the Hexton area     
 from April to July 1985.              
 The words which we recorded are but a 
 fraction of the complete work which   
 engendered much interest and          
 enthusiasm. As Anne_Marie said,{"We   
{could write a page for every step of  
{the way".}The children were Mark,     
 Heidi, Gregg, Anne_Marie, Debbie,     
 Eleanor, Alexander, Hannah, Ellinor,  
 Annabel, Jennifer, Karen &amp; Toni_Marie.</content>
