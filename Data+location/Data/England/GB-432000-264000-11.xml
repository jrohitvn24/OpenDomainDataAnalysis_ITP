		<title>11WARNEFORD HOSPITAL.</title>
		<content>   The Warneford Hospital was built in 
 1832. It was named after Dr. Samuel   
 Warneford, the main benefactor. It    
 serves a community of 250,000 people  
 from Stratford to Solihull.           
   There are nine wards with 204 beds; 
 four operating theatres, two always in
 use, one day-theatre and one in the   
 maternity block. The hospital also    
 treats 3 900 outpatients and has a big
 ophthalmic department. About 1,800    
 births occur each year at the hospital
 which employs about 350 staff         
 including doctors, nurses,            
 secretaries, clerks, cooks, cleaners, 
 electricians, porters and storemen.   
 Some jobs were lost recently through  
 privatisation.                        
   Rumours exist that the hospital     
 might close and become a home for old 
 people. Patients said the hospital had
 a kind and friendly atmosphere.       </content>
