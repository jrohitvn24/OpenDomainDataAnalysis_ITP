		<title>15HIGH HURSTWOOD SERVICES</title>
		<content> A recent improvement in public        
 services has been the provision of a  
 weekly refuse collection with         
 specially designed plastic dustbins on
 wheels allotted to every household and
 a speedy mechanised system of emptying
 them into lorries. Away from the main 
 roads there is no main drainage and   
 all houses have a cesspool or septic  
 tank. Piped gas is not available. All 
 houses have electricity but power     
 failures are a hazard everyone has to 
 be prepared for especially in thunder-
 storms. Farms have petrol generators  
 and most homes keep alternative       
 methods of heating and lighting. Side 
 roads can become treacherous in icy   
 weather and are the last to be        
 attended to. Local farmers are often  
 called on by the Council to help with 
 gritting and snow clearance.
