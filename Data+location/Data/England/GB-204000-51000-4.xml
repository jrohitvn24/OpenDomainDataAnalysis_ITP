		<content>{THE PORT OF PAR}                      
     It is no good producing the clay  
 if it cannot be transported easily to 
 where it will be needed. For this     
 purpose the ports of Par and Fowey are
 used.                                 
     The port of Par was built around  
 130 years ago (in the 1830's) by a man
 named J.T. Treffry.                   
     It is a completely man-made port  
 and was originally built to serve the 
 local copper and tin mining           
 industries.                           
     In 1964 E.C.C. bought the port of 
 Par, although they had been using it  
 to transport their clay since 1946. It
 is the main port for the export of    
 clay by sea.
