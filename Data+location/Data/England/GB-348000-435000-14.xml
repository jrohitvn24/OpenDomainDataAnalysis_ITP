		<content>One of the games we play at St Mary's  
is called "Runaround". In this game all
the players line up against the wall.  
At a signal everyone runs to the grass 
and back. The last one to return is    
"on".                                  
                                       
The one who is "on" then calls out     
someones name. He/she has to run to the
grass avoiding the one who is "on". If 
caught he/she is also "on". If the one 
chosen succeeds in reaching the grass  
there is a "full charge" in which all  
run to the grass and back. Any captured
join the one who is "on".              
                                       
Other playground games include         
football, cricket and tennis at        
various seasons. Dolls and toys brought
from home are also played with.
