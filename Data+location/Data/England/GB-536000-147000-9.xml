		<content>   South Godstone has a{London Country 
{Bus Service}which runs from Croydon to
 East Grinstead every hour. There is   
 also a Greenline Service every hour to
 and from East Grinstead and Hemel     
 Hempstead. The buses are very         
 important to the village particularly 
 for the young and the old people.     
 Children from Blindley Heath and      
 Godstone use the buses to travel to   
 and from school and the elderly, many 
 of whom have no cars or cannot drive, 
 travel by bus cheaply with a bus pass.
   One petrol station serves the       
 village. It has a small shop attached 
 selling motor accessories, and a large
 showroom selling mainly speedboats. At
 the rear of the garage is a large     
 workshop for car repairs.
