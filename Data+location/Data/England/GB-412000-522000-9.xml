		<title>09Keverstone Grange. 1.</title>
		<content>  This farm is part of the large Raby  
 estate,and is nearly 200 years old.The
 Littlefair family have been working   
 the land for about 100 years.Before   
 Keverstone Grange became a farm house 
 it used to be the residence of Lord   
 Barnard's agent.The tenants of his    
 Raby Estate came to the house to pay  
 their rents etc.It's a surprisingly   
 big house made entirely of stone.The  
 walls are very thick.The original farm
 house nearby is much smaller and is   
 now let.The house is divided into two 
 parts.The front rooms being for the   
 family whilst the back,with its own   
 staircase,would be for servants.At the
 back there are two courtyards bordered
 by old stone buildings which are still
 used.In the office courtyard we saw a 
 mounting block,which would be used in 
 days when tenants came on horseback to
 see the agent.                        </content>
