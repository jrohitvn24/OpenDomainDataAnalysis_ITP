{THE CREAMERY AT MINSTERLEY.}          
     The creamery at Minsterley makes  
 lots of people happy by providing     
 jobs.They make lots of healthy foods  
 like{butter, cheese, cream and        
 yogurt.The{yogurt}is in all flavours. 
 My favourites are pineapple and       
 strawberry.                           
     There are big articulated lorries 
 and tankers. The tankers carry{milk   
 from the farms.Inside the backs of the
 articulated lorries it is very cold   
 because the food has to be kept       
 extremely cold so that it will not go 
 bad.My dad works at the creamery and  
 he told me that the lorries have to be
 weighed before they leave the factory 
 with a full load.                     
     The factory is lit up at night and
 looks quite a sight as you pass on the
 road to Shrewsbury.                   </content>
