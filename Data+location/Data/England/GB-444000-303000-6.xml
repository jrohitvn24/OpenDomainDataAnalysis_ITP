		<title>06Desford Parish Council</title>
		<content> Desford Parish Council has ten        
 members, eight representing Desford   
 Ward and two the Bufton Ward, which   
 comprises two small hamlets north and 
 east of Desford.                      
 Seven members of the present council  
 were elected in 1983. Since then, one 
 member was disqualified through       
 failure to attend meetings, and was   
 replaced by co-option. Two others     
 resigned and were replaced, one by    
 co-option and the other through a     
 by-election requested by parishioners.
 The present composition of the council
 is seven men and three women. Desford 
 is linked with Peckleton Parish to    
 form part of a Borough Council with 2 
 members, and additionally with Barwell
 as a County  Council division with one
 member. Both Borough councillors &amp; the
 County councillor are also members of 
 Desford Parish Council.               </content>
