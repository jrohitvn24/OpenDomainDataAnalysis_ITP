		<content> During the iron age,about 200 years   
 before Christ a large hill top camp   
 was built near to the burrough        
 spring.Just beyond one of the farms   
 just outside Ratby the remains of this
 are to be found.Unfortunately the     
 farmer on whose land the camp is      
 situated is very anxious about        
 attracting crowds and allows          
 absolutely nobody to see it.          
    Both Ratby and Kirby have an entry 
 in the Domesday book.Ratby was the    
 larger of the two places in those days
 and had a priest_indicating the       
 prsence of an early church.The main   
 body of the church   dates from the   
 14th century  .Historians suggest that
 the incoplete stonework in the nave   
 may be due to the visitation of the   
 plague.                               
     Both the important Leics families,
 the Greys and Hastings owned land here</content>
