		<title>13Village Hall, Staploe</title>
		<content> The village hall built in 1954, with  
 money raised locally stands on        
 leasehold land, beside the cricket    
 field, loaned by a farmer. The        
 Committee drawn from Duloe and Staploe
 only, organizes events each year, to  
 upkeep the structure, (a whist drive, 
 a Christmas Carol bazaar and a Summer 
 gymkhana bazaar.) Regular users are   
 the cricket club, over 60's, Social   
 Club and Council. More intermittently,
 weddings, private parties and courses 
 e.g. dancing. Charges are moderate    
 with winter heating additional. The   
 over 60's club enjoys preferential    
 rates. Owing to it's scattered        
 population the public uses additional 
 venues. Honeydon's pleasantly small   
 chapel is used for winter Council     
 meetings and a Barn at Chestnuts Farm 
 is licensed and complies with fire    
 regulationsfor events. e.g. Halloween.</content>
