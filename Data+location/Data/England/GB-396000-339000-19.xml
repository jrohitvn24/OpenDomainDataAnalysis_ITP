Highfields Farm is on the main road    
which passes through Draycott. The Farm
is about 108 acres. 60 acres are used  
for crops, such as barley and the rest 
is used for grazing and hay and silage.
This is mainly a beef producing unit.  
It has got 42 cattle, mostly heifers   
but some bullocks. In addition there   
are chickens and horses.               
                                       
The combine harvester is a New Holland.
There are 3 tractors, which take a wide
variety appliances. Most of them are   
used in some way or another in the     
harvest. The first step in the harvest 
is to plough and sow the seed in the   
autumn. It is not until the following  
September that the time has come to    
harvest the barley which is mainly used
as animal feed.
