		<title>06Manor of Spaunton Court Leet</title>
		<content> The{Court Leet}is held annually at    
 11.00 in the forenoon on the first    
 Thursday in October. 14 common right  
 owners are summoned &amp; a foreman is    
 chosen,they then swear allegience to  
 the Monarch. Their duties are to      
 'police'the land &amp; report any offence.
 An encroachment onto common land is   
 subject to a fine which is collected  
 by the Baliff. In recent years some   
 land has been enclosed by commoners   
 who pay a minimal for this privilage, 
 &amp; they have to maintain all boundary  
 fences. At a public enquiry some years
 ago several commoners had some of     
 their rights removed. A few farmers   
 now rent extra grazing rights.        
 Although the Court Leet owes it's     
 history to tradition,it's laws &amp;      
 customs play a useful part in comunity
 life today.
