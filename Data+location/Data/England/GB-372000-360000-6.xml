		<content> During June 1985 a{new shopping       
{precinct}was opened in Sandbach. It is
 the first new shopping development in 
 the town for many years.The precinct  
 has been constructed in an area which 
 was previously an eye-sore.The        
 construction work was completed by    
 Marath Construction Ltd. of Nuneaton. 
 The design of the precinct (by        
 Mitchell Gray Associates of Sandbach) 
 is such that it blends with the       
 century old market and town hall. The 
 precinct is a traffic free area       
 consisting of 6 small shop units, one 
 large shop unit, a supermarket unit   
 and one office unit.At the same time  
 as the constuction of the precinct    
 alterations to the doctors surgery    
 nearby were undertaken so that it also
 blended with the new building.Above   
 the surgery there is 2,500 sq.ft.of   
 office accomadation.                  </content>
