		<content> Living in Frizinghall.                
 Life in Manningham is great,there are 
 lots of shops close by selling fish   
 and chips,newspapers,hardware,videos  
 plus three minimarkets,one betting    
 shop and a post office. Nighat's      
 family owns a shop, they sold clothes 
 and shoes but now they sell drinks,   
 food,fruit and even beer.There are    
 playing fields,a football pitch (not  
 very big!) and a cricket ground.At    
 school Muslim girls must wear trousers
 to cover their legs - most white girls
 have got used to the Muslim ways but  
 they no longer ask them to parties    
 because they know they will not be    
 allowed to go.Sometimes white girls   
 wear the Muslim style of clothes and  
 try to learn Punjabi.Zartashia's home 
 is special to her because her family  
 all love each other,they work together
 and welcome people to share their home</content>
