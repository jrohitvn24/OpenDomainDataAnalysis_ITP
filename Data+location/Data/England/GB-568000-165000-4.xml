		<title>04The Village Policeman</title>
		<content> PC.Ireland polices Cuxton and Halling 
 villages. Most villages are policed   
 from the nearest town. After checking 
 his vehicle PC.Ireland drives to      
 collect teleprinter messages from     
 Rochester Station and fits freshly    
 charged batteries into his radio. The 
 radio is the only link with the       
 station during the day. On returning  
 to Cuxton he does a foot patrol and   
 then deals with messages. Poachers,   
 rubbish dumped illegally and          
 suspicious cars are often reported.   
 The cars owners are traced via the    
 police computer. Often PC.Ireland is  
 called away to help with large police 
 operations. Another part of his job is
 to visit schools to give talks on road
 safety and warn children about the    
 dangers of going with strangers.      
 Vandalism and burglary are Cuxton's   
 most common crimes.                   </content>
