		<title>12WAPLEY COMMON</title>
		<content>   A local councillor,one of our school
 governors,told us that 10 years ago   
 Dodington Parish Council bought{Wapley
{Common}so that it could be open to the
 public to walk dogs,play games,have   
 picnics and enjoy themselves.         
   The{Avon Wildlife Trust}is very     
 interested in the nearby woods(Wapley 
 Bushes) because it has several        
 interesting plants and flowers growing
 there.They intend setting up a{nature 
{trail}with notices to show the public 
 where to walk and see the plants.     
   Our school is quite near to the     
 common so,hopefully,we will be able to
 go out there and use it as a study    
 area for project work.
