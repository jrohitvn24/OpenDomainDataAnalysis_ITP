		<content> BECAUSE WE ARE A RURAL AREA WE ARE    
 LUCKY AS WE HAVE VERY LITTLE IN THE   
 WAY OF POLLUTION BY FACTORIES AND     
 INDUSTRY.  AS A RESULT THERE IS ALWAYS
 A VAST NUMBER OF FLOWERS TO BE FOUND  
 IN THE WOODS AND HEDGEROWS.  ON A WALK
 ONE GROUP FOUND TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT 
 TYPES OF FLOWER.  THERE ARE           
 ALWAYS A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT    
 FLOWERS AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR
