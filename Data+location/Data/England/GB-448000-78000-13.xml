		<content>  The conservation situation in the    
 Chale Green/Roud area is not adequate.
 In Roud the roads are well kept, but  
 the roads passing through the area and
 Chale Green have been described by the
 local residents as unsuitable.        
  Unfortunately the roads are not      
 repaired on a regular basis. The      
 same is true for the buildings and    
 monuments owned by the National Trust.
 Even the pond in Chale Green is       
 stagnant. A lot more general repairs  
 need to be carried out in this        
 picturesque area of the Island.       
  Chale Green and Roud are both small  
 settlements, and so are without a     
 booming tourist trade. In fact there  
 is only one guesthouse in the area!   
 Most people who stay at the 'Halls'   
 guesthouse in Chale Green probably go 
 there for the scenic views and the    
 numerous footpaths.                   </content>
