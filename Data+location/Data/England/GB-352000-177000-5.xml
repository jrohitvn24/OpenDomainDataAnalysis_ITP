		<title>05SHOPPING IN LAWRENCE WESTON</title>
		<content> There is the odd shop or two at either
 end of the Lawrence Weston estate, but
 the variety is to be found at         
{Ridingleaze.}There is stiff           
 competition here between pairs of     
{greengrocers, supermarkets, butchers  
 and{newsagents.}You can also satisfy  
 your appetite with a fish or chicken  
 chow mein supper, bedazzle friends    
 with a stunning new{hair}style,       
 refurnish your home or chance all at  
 the{betting shop.}And of course, there
 are the 'old faithfuls'-the{Post      
{Office,}the{clothes}and{wool}shop, a  
 cafe and auto spares. The popularity  
 of these shops is reflected by the    
 Saturday traffic jams. The rank of    
 shops recently survived a fiendish    
 plot to build a brand, spanking new   
 supermarket. Thanks to the howls of   
 protest  from the locals, this scheme 
 was stopped in its tracks.  L.W.School</content>
