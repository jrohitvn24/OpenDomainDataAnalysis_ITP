		<title>18CHILDREN'S PLACES OF BIRTH.</title>
		<content>  The survey was carried out on 117    
 middle school children(aged 9-12) at  
 Budbrooke Combined school.We asked    
 where their parents lived when the    
 children were born.There were many    
 different places so we had to break   
 them down.We ended up with 6 areas.We 
 added the total in each area and      
 expressed the result as a percentage. 
 They are:
