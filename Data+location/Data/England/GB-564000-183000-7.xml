 The present School is brick built and 
 situated in Hillcrest Road on land    
 which was formerly a recreation       
 ground.  The notice closing the       
 footpath across this area from Mill   
 Lane to the High Road has only        
 recently been published.  The old     
 School is used by the Youth Centre.   
 One of the two demountable classrooms 
 was dismantled and removed in May.    
 There are 147 pupils aged from 5 to 11
 in 5 classes.  The Head is Mrs. S.    
 Gascoigne and there are 5 teachers Mr.
 R. Matthews (Deputy Head) Mrs. Porter,
 Miss Collings, Mrs. Jones and Mrs.    
 Springett.  The children go by coach  
 on Thursday to swim at Corringham     
 Pool.  After the School Harvet Service
 in Church the children take gifts to  
 the old people in the village.
