		<content>  The type of farming in the area      
 varies a great deal.                  
  The alluvial soil near the River Tees
 is ideal for arable land, growing good
 crops of roots, particularly potatoes.
 Wheat and barley are also grown on    
 this type of land and in recent years 
 oilseed rape and a little linseed are 
 used as break crops.                  
  At the other extreme the heavier clay
 is more suited to intensive grass     
 farming. The grass is used both to    
 graze livestock, such as dairy cows,  
 beef cattle and sheep, and as a       
 preserved winter feed in the form of  
 silage and hay.                       
  Intensive pig units are to be found  
 on some farms. Intensive beef units,  
 where cattle are fattened on barley   
 rather than grass, are also to be     
 found. Most farms specialise in one   
 main enterprise.                      </content>
