		<title>12Barton Gravel Pit</title>
		<content>Barton gravel pit,located to the east  
of the A38 near Barton,is owned by     
Amalgamated Road Stone Corporation.    
Sand and gravel are excavated to use   
in the building and construction       
industries. After excavation the gravel
is taken to the sorting plant by       
conveyer belt. The stone is dropped    
onto a stockpile which is fed into the 
sorting plant. The gravel is separated 
into two grades,building and concrete. 
It is then washed to remove sand and   
is further sorted into sizes           
determined by demand. Most of the      
aggregate is transported to the new    
M42 Motorway under construction at     
Tamworth.The quarry also supplies      
building merchants,farmers,drainage    
contractors etc. Nine people are       
employed at the quarry and work is     
expected to last for another 60 years. 
Archeological  evidence has been found.</content>
