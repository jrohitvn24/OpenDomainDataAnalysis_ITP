		<content> Netherton is a small quiet village.   
 Because of the mechanisation of       
 farming this century, there has been a
 big loss in population from about 160 
 in 1851 to about 60 today.            
   There is no Church.The only meeting 
 places are the Star Inn public house  
 and the Village  Hall,built in memory 
 of those who served in the First World
 War.                                  
     There is only one shop - the Post 
 Office.It sells sweets,               
 soft-drinks,cigarettes and newspapers.
    The old school building and a      
 nearby pair of cottages are used as an
 Expedition Centre.                    
    Two businesses in the village are  
 Blakey's wagon haulage and petrol     
 sales and Ford's Agricultural         
 Contractors.
