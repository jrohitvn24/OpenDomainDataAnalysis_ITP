		<title>01  THE AREA I LIVE IN</title>
		<content> 'm eleven years old and was born in   
Dartord, I've lived in Dartford all my 
life, near the heath which is on the   
edge of the town.  I like my town      
because it has a very large new theatre
called The Orchard,a park with a new   
play area, a swimming pool called      
Fairfield Pools which also have squash 
courts and other such sports,a libary  
with its very own museum that has lots 
of information on the history of       
Dartford.  It has its own shopping     
centre named the Arndale Centre soon   
to be renamed the Priory Centre. The   
Arndale was opened in November 1975.   
Dartford has its own tunnel which is   
named after it ,which crosses the river
Thames to Essex. We are only a short   
train ride to London and situated on   
the edge of the Greater London Area.   
The population in Dartford is 42,000.
