		<title>15CUSTOMS</title>
		<content>{Well Dressing}is our local custom in  
 Derbyshire.You build a frame and put  
 it in water for about 48 hours.Then   
 you have to soften down some clay.You 
 put it in a tub with water and stamp  
 about in the clay with your bare feet.
 The clay is then spread on the frame .
 While the clay is being made soft,    
 somebody else is preparing the        
 drawing.The drawing is usually a      
 picture from a Bible story.When the   
 drawing is finished it is put on the  
 clay and pricked with a pin so that   
 the picture is pricked in the clay.   
 Petals and moss and leaves are pressed
 in the clay using the right colours   
 for each part, like yellow for the sun
 and white for the clouds.The petals   
 overlap like tiles on a roof.
