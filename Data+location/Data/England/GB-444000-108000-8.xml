		<title>08My Dad's Allotment.</title>
		<content>   My dad is a keen gardener.He has got
 an allotment at Weston.His plot is 10 
 rods and it costs him Â£15 rent each   
 year from Southampton City Council.   
   He works on his plot about three    
 times a week usualy at week-ends and  
 he said it's realy hard work keeping  
 it going,that's probably why so many  
 of the{plots are vacant.}Also the rent
 has gone up a lot in the last few     
 years so that has put many people off.
   There are taps for water all round  
 the site but you have to share with   
 others.By the main gate there are     
 toilets and a shop for those in the   
 Gardening Club to buy things cheaply. 
   My dad grows pots,R.beans,B.beans,  
 cabbage,lettuce,rhubarb,beetroot,     
 strawberry,raddish,cauliflower,carrots
 but he doesn't think it saves him     
 money but he must enjoy it because he 
 works so hard.                        </content>
