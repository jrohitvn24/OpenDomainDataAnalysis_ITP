		<title>06The Shopping Precinct</title>
		<content>   In l976/77 Branklodge Securities    
 Limited proposed a shopping precinct  
 with adjoining car-park.  The precinct
 will be positioned off Bath Street in 
 the East Street/Albion Place area.    
 This company obtained planning        
 permission for this development which 
 will include some of the land in      
 possession of the Borough Council.    
 This scheme did not advance until the 
 end of 1984, early 1985 because of the
 problems obtaining the land.  The     
 present owners of Ilkeston's shops on 
 Bath Street have fought a gutsy       
 rearguard action against their        
 businesses.  Certain shops such as    
 Burtons have decided to quit Bath     
 Street to be in the centre of the     
 precinct.  Burtons will not be a      
 highly fashionable 'Top Man' store,   
 but will be 'much bigger and better'  
 than the present Burtons.             </content>
