		<title>05FLEET RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> Fleet Station caters mostly for       
 commuters, with about 3,000 travelling
 to London each day, at a cost of      
 almost Â£1,000 p.a.                    
                                       
{Commuting to Work}                    
 Every day my Dad commutes to London.  
 He gets up at 6.30 and, after         
 breakfast, cycles to the station. Once
 there, he rushes to his spot on the   
 platform to catch the 7.25 to         
 Waterloo.  He tries to get a          
 'non-smoker' carriage, often he cannot
 even get a seat so has to stand. His  
 office is 20 minutes walk away.  If it
 rains he catches a bus. The journey   
 home is worse as he is always tired   
 and often gets a headache.  If he is  
 lucky, he is home by 6.30 p.m. If not,
 he eats his tea by himself.  He does  
 not like commuting.
