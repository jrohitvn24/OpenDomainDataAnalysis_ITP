		<content> We are fortunate in Bexleyheath as far
 as leisure facilities are concerned.  
 There are golf courses, swimming      
 pools,  cricket, football and tennis  
 clubs, parks and lakes for water      
 sports.  The two main leisure centres 
 are the Crook Log Sports Centre and   
 Splashworld.  The Crook Log Sports    
 Centre opened in 1982. It is open to  
 the public betwen 10.00 and 23.00 hrs.
 daily, and offers the full range of   
 indoor sporting activities.  The main 
 hall is used for entertainments       
 ranging from fashion shows to         
 wrestling and snooker tournaments.    
 There are lessons for trampoline,     
 judo, table-tennis, parachuting and   
 dancing.  The Committee Rooms can be  
 hired for parties and meetings, food  
 and drink can be obtained at the      
 lounge bar, and young children can be 
 left at the creche.                   </content>
