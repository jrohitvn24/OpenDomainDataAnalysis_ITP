		<title>11FARMING  DARTMOOR</title>
		<content>      We visited the Hexts whose family
  have farmed in the area for over 500 
 years. The farm is still worked by 3  
 generations and great-grandmother     
 still lives with the family.The women 
 remembered cooking on the open fire   
 with dried peat from the moor for     
 fuel.They had a bread oven heated with
 faggots.The flour was ground          
 at Cockingford Mill which is now in   
 ruins.The evening we were there a     
 sliced wrapped shop loaf was on the   
 table.Meat was cooked on the fire in a
 camp kettle,which was also covered    
 with peat.They had to brush the embers
 from the lid to open the pot and had  
 to be careful not to be burnt by hot  
 sparks.Now they ahve an electric      
 generator and cook by electricity.They
 used to preserve food with salt but   
 now use a refrigerator or deep freeze.
