		<title>06SUPERSTORE AT WEST THURROCK</title>
		<content> My mum works at Tesco in the Lakeside 
 Development.Tesco is a superstore     
 selling different things like toys,   
 clothes,tools,bikes,wallpaper,computer
 s,records,books,wine and groceries.   
  You will find my mum at the checkout 
 desk.She looks at the prices on the   
 goods,puts the prices into her till   
 and the till adds them all up.Then she
 takes the customers' money and then   
 gives them their change and their till
 receipt .My mum likes to work at Tesco
 because she meets lots of people .She 
 has worked there since the store      
 opened in 1984.                       
  She gets to work by car,sometimes    
 her friend's car.My mum does not not  
 do shift work, she only works in the  
 evening.
