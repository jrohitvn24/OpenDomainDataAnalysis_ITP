		<title>09The Marsh and Brickcroft(1)</title>
		<content>  One of the main physical features    
of our area is the marshland that      
separates Longton from Hesketh Bank.   
The land is low-lying vegetated        
saltmarsh and is chiefly used as rough 
grazing for sheep. It is bisected by   
the River Douglas and is liable to     
flooding. In the past the river was    
well-used. There has always been an inn
on the edge of the marsh and it is said
that that there was and still is tunnel
leading from the Dolphin Inn (known    
sometimes as the Flying Fish) to the   
river. Smuggling of Dutch lace and     
gin was rife at this time.(Early       
18th century)                          
  Over the years a considerable amount 
of the marshland was drained and       
some agriculture developed.            
  Longton Brickcroft was opened in the 
mid-19th century.The family who owned  
the land were the Bentleys.(Contd.)    </content>
