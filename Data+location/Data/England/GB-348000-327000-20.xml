		<title>20Wem Amateur Dramatic Society</title>
		<content>  1919 was the year when the Amdrams   
 put on their first production, an     
 operetta, and they have continued ever
 since apart from the war years. The   
 number of shows is about 4 a year and 
 they try to have a wide variety,      
 something for everyone. Every year    
 they enter a play in a local drama    
 festival, often with great success.   
 The society is run by a committee who 
 choose and organise the productions.  
 Besides the cast, which varies from 4 
 to 24, there are always many others   
 involved with lighting, music, scenery
 props and costumesetc. Because there  
 is such a range ofjobs, the society   
 involves a cross section of the people
 in Wem and everyone is always welcome 
 to join in. The Town Hall is usually  
 full because the Amdrams have built up
 such a good reputation. Wem is lucky  
 to have such a thriving group in town.</content>
