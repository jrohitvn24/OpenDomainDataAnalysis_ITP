		<title>02River Cray Area</title>
		<content>    This block covers the area of the  
{River Cray}from Foots Cray High St. to
 the Five Arches bridge.               
    The study area is towards the      
 eastern edge of Sidcup. It appears to 
 be the largest single stretch of open 
 land in the immediate vicinity of     
 Sidcup.                               
    The area is primarily meadowland   
 and is dissected by the{River Cray}.  
 There is a network of footpaths       
 criss-crossing the area. On the       
 eastern side of the river there is a  
 council housing estate, along with a  
 few factories towards the southern end
 of the section. It is a very          
 picturesque setting especially along  
 the western side of the River Cray    
 around Five Arches. It is a very      
 popular place for walks, picnics and  
 general recreation.
