		<title>03METHODIST CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Methodist Church at Wadworth  was 
 built in 1926. Inside it is not like  
 Wadworth Anglican Church, with bare   
 stone wall, it has smooth painted     
 walls. It has a small organ and a     
 piano, also lots of pews. The 20th    
 Doncaster Wadworth Guides pack meets  
 there every Tuesday except Bank       
 Holidays with song and games. In the  
 Chapel are mostly older people. But   
 unlike the anglican church they do not
 have weekly services with one one week
 but not the next week. In the grounds 
 of the chapel there are no graves but 
 grass. Around the back of the chapel  
 there is a vegetable patch which Mr   
 Oxby grows vegetables in. The minister
 of the church does not live in the    
 village but in Bawtry. Every Good     
 Friday they have a special tea to help
 raise funds.                          
                                       </content>
