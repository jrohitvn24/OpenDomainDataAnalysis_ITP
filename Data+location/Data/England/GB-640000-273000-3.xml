		<content>There are only two real centres of     
population and even these are not      
complete villages. The larger of the   
two is{Wenhaston} and the other is     
{Bramfield.} Wenhaston is a rather     
scattered village with the older houses
gathered around the heaths(sandlings)  
and with more modern infilling.        
Bramfield is a more nucleated village, 
but most of it is not included in this 
block of the survey. The farming areas 
dominate the block, and the settlement 
is evenly spaced. There is no dominant 
large estate or very large farm. Most  
farms are in the 100 to 200 hectare    
size and and although there has been   
some consolidation, there are few      
unoccupied houses.
