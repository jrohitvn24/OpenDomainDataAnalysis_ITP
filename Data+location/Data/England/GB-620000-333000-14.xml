		<title>14Home Life In Gunton.</title>
		<content> Although widely scattered this        
appears to be a very stable community. 
Most of the elderly have lived in the  
same house all their lives with their  
pets,tending their gardens and         
usually keeping themselves very much   
to themselves. By nature very reticent 
they have little to say concerning     
education, religion or politics. The   
younger generation however are more    
vocal on subjects.They live in council 
renovated estate cottages or their own 
privately owned homes and enjoy leisure
time in their village communities or   
nearby towns. The Norfolk dialect is   
still much heard among the elderly     
locals who lived peaceably with those  
who have moved from the towns.         
 Within the Hall complex, because of   
their professional status (!) the      
residents are aware and outspoken on   
local issues.                          </content>
