		<title>06TYPES OF HOUSES - TEIGNMOUTH</title>
		<content>   In order to get a picture of the    
 houses in Teignmouth the town was     
 divided into two parts, east and west.
 Some streets were chosen at random,   
 from each part, to study.             
   The streets we looked at on the east
 side were Barnsley Close and Gorway.  
 The type of housing in Barnsley Close 
 is detached houses with large gardens,
 garages and driveways. There are 3 or 
 4 bedrooms in the houses. Some of the 
 houses were modern but some were very 
 old. The houses are all different in  
 design.                               
   The homes in Gorway were detached   
 with garages and large gardens. They  
 were also 3 or 4 bedroom houses.      
   In the west side of Teignmouth we   
 looked at the flats at Kingsway. There
 are 30 flats in each block and there  
 are 4 blocks of flats. Each flat has 2
 bedrooms but no garden or garage.     </content>
