		<title>17Old Hartley Hero</title>
		<content>   Half a mile North of Curry's point  
 is Hartley Bay. On October 28th 1880, 
 the Dutch Galleon{"Trebroders"}was    
 passing Hartley Bay in a raging sea   
 when she ran onto the rocks at Crag   
 Point. The remaining crew were        
 clinging to the rigging. Then the     
 figure of Thomas Langley appeared at  
 the top of the cliff and without      
 hesitation he said he should be       
 lowered down onto the raging sea. He  
 saved a child and two seamen. As      
 Langley was returning to his cottage a
 cry was heard that another ship was in
 distress.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
