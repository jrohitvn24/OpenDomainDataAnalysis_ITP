		<title>13New Forest Ponies.</title>
		<content> All ponies in The New Forest belong to
 someone and they, the owner, can be   
 identified by the brand mark on the   
 animal. People living within certain  
 boundaries of the Forest are entitled 
 to what is known as{Commmoner's       
{Rights.}These "Rights" are many, but  
 one of them allows a New Forest       
 Commoner the right to graze cattle on 
 Forest land. According to some people 
 in this area this right is being      
 abused and ponies are foaling for a   
 second time in one year without       
 sufficient grass available. Due to    
 this over-grazing some of the animals 
 are in a poor state of health. This is
 the opinion of the staff of the two   
 riding establishments which were      
 visited.
