		<title>19THE 'STORY' OF FELON'S OAK.</title>
		<content>  At the crossroads of Forches Lane    
 and Greenland Lane near Croydon Hall  
 there was an old oak tree.            
 People who committed crimes used to   
 be hung by a very strong rope on the  
 branches of the oak till they were    
 dead and when the rope broke they fell
 down on the track. The tree has stood 
 for about 300 years until it was cut  
 down very recently. In that time it   
 became called Felons Oak.Most         
 villagers said there was a ring of    
 power around it and if you went to it 
 after 8 o'clock at night a cloak of   
 darkness would come over you and your 
 neck would begin to tingle. So people 
 stayed well away. Now a new tree has  
 been planted.If you put your head to  
 the old stump of the oak you can still
 hear the rattle of chains.
