		<title>05CROPS-SUGAR BEET &amp; POTATOES</title>
		<content>    {SUGAR BEET}is grown on 18/20 inch 
 rows, sown accurately at about 6 inch 
 spacing, sprayed for weed and applied 
 control and finaly lifted by a 3 row  
 harvesting machine which lifts tops,  
 cleans and delivers into a trailor.   
    The beet which has a sugar content 
 of around 16% is delivered to the     
 factory at{Brigg}for processing,      
 eventually into{lump sugar.           
                                       
   {POTATOES}are often picked by hand  
 as the stones in the land may cause   
 damage if lifted by machine. On stone 
 free land a harvester is used and the 
 crop is usually stored for sale at    
 intervals during the winter. Sprays   
 are used to combat weeds and diseases 
 particularly{potato blight}and a      
{sprout suppresant}is used during      
 storage.
