		<title>11South Park</title>
		<content>  South Park is the area of forest and 
 heathland in the block.(North Park is 
 used by the Ministry of Defence).     
  South Park is a very peaceful place  
 where many people go to walk their    
 dogs and enjoy the peace and quiet.   
  The only disturbance is the distant  
 sound of the cars on the busy spur    
 road to Bournemouth.The only other    
 noises are the singing of the birds   
 and the humming of grass hoppers.     
  In the heather and gorse,there is the
 occasional spider's webb shining in   
 the sun.                              
  In the wooded area,there is a        
 woodland walk which is marked with    
 white arrows.
