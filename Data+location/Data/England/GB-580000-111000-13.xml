		<title>13Archie Belaney of Hastings.</title>
		<content>          I live  near{St. Helens Woods
 and sometimes I play there. At school 
 we read about a boy called{Archie     
{Belaney}who was always playing Red    
 Indians in{St. Helens Woods.}When he  
 grew up he went to{Canada and lived   
{with the Indians.}He married an Indian
 girl and he went trapping beavers for 
 their fur. After a few years he felt  
 sorry for the beavers and rescued two 
 baby ones. He wrote books about       
 beavers and became very famous.       
 Everybody thought he was a chief      
 called{Grey Owl.}He even had tea with 
 the{King}in{Buckingham Palace!}Some of
 his things are in our{Museum.}He was  
 filmed and photographed. He made      
 people want to preserve wildlife. You 
 can still read{Archie Belaney's}books 
 because they are in the Library.
