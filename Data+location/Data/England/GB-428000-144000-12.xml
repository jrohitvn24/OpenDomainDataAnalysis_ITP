		<title>12THRUXTON AIRFIELD &amp; CIRCUIT.</title>
		<content>  Over half of Thruxton Airfield is in 
 our area, including three of the four 
 runways. Aeroplanes from Thruxton     
 Flight Centre may be seen taking off  
 together with gliders of the Inkpen   
 Gliding Club &amp; members of the Thruxton
 Parachute Club.                       
  Around the airfield runs the Thruxton
 Circuit used for testing and racing   
 cars and motorcycles, demonstration   
 and promotion purposes and also fund- 
 raising runs. There are twelve race   
 meetings a year, nine for racing-cars 
 and three for motorcycles and T.V.    
 cameras are often on the scene.       
  The eastern end of the airfield is a 
 mini-industrial estate. Among the many
 industries are metal-working and      
 engineering, the making of traffic-   
 lights, flying jackets, binoculars,   
 model aircraft and wine-cooling trays.
