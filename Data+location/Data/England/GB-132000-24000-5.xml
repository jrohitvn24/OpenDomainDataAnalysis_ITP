		<title>05Sennen Beach</title>
		<content> Sometimes{Sennen beach}can be fun. But
 it can be quite{dangerous}because you 
 can get caught by a current and pulled
 out to the sea, or you can slip off a 
 sandbank,and get cut by glass or get  
 cut by sharp metal things.Mostly      
 if you go too far into the sea you can
 get stuck on a rock.You would have to 
 wait for the{lifeguards boat}to come  
 and get you off the rock.If they dont 
 come you could get swept off the rock 
 and fall into the sea and you might be
 drowned because it is a dangerous     
 beach.We have{lifeguards}looking after
 the people on the beach in the summer 
 If people get into trouble or have    
 difficulty the{lifeguards}rescue them 
 on a {surf board}or with their{speed  
{boat.}The flags the{lifeguards}use are
 red and yellow for the safe swimming  
 area,red is for no swimming and black 
 and white for surfers and canoeists.  </content>
