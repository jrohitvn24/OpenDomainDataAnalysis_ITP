		<title>16Working on the Mainland</title>
		<content>{Gillian West writes -}My Dad used to  
 work at Elliot's in Cowes but they had
 to close because not enough machinery 
 was being bought. Now he has to travel
 to the mainland each day to John Brown
 in Portsmouth because there were no   
 suitable jobs on the Island.          
 Every day he drives 14 miles to Ryde, 
 parks his car and catches the Hover-  
 Craft to Southsea. Then he gets on his
 bike and rides to the office. A season
 ticket for a month on the Hovercraft  
 costs about Â£40.                      
 The car journey takes 30 minutes and  
 but the Hovercraft only takes 7 min   
 to cross the Solent (4 miles).        
 Sometimes my Dad has to go abroad to  
 Germany, to Holland or to U.S.A. His  
 job is buying special machines and he 
 has to go to the factory where they   
 are being made.
