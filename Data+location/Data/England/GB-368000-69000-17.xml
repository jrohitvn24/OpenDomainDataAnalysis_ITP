		<title>17A Family Day</title>
		<content> One time our family walked to Church  
 Ope Cove.  When we got there we had to
 walk down the steep steps to the beach
 and then we spread a blanket over a   
 big rock near the sea.  I put on my   
 trunks and went into the water.  When 
 we were in the water my brother and I 
 had a water fight.  Soon afterwards we
 both came out of the water and went to
 a different rock to dry out in the    
 sun.  It didn't take long and then we 
 had a picnic lunch.  Afterwards my    
 brother and I started to climb the    
 rocks to look for caves and fossils.  
 When we came down from the rocks we   
 collected our things and went to      
 Easton to buy some sweets and         
 newspapers.  Then we went home.
