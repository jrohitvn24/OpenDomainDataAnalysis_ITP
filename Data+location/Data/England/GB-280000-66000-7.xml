		<title>07Denbury Hill Fort.</title>
		<content>  We visited the{hill fort}early in    
 June.We had to climb a very steep lane
 called{Denbury Down Lane,}the footpath
 from the North West no longer exists  
 nor does the lane from{Nordon Cross. }
  The fort is an ancient{Celtic}settle-
 ment with a double ditch on three     
 sides, to the North is a single ditch.
 There are two tumuli within the double
 ditches.                              
  The{ditches}were clearly defined and,
 although overgrown with hazel and     
 holly trees, were in good condition as
 a defence.They were between three and 
 four metres deep. The{tumuli}appeared 
 undisturbed, the eastern one is more  
 clearly visible.It has a small granite
 marker from the last century on top.  
  From a distance the{hilltop appears }
 to be crowned with deciduous trees    
 about twelve metres tall.Ground cover 
 was sparse.                           </content>
