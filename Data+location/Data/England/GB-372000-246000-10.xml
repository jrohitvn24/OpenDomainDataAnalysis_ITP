		<title>10HOLLINGS HILL FARM CRADLEY</title>
		<content> The farm is mostly dairy with a few   
 cereal crops.The farmhouse is about   
 200 years old and the old parts are   
 300 to 400 years old.We went around   
 the farm.The first thing we saw were  
 the calves and they started to suck   
 our hands.When we saw the lambs some  
 of the girls and boys put their       
 fingers in the lambs mouths and they  
 got bitten.They do not keep pigs but  
 they have a pig sty.They have just a  
 few hens and a cockerel which they    
 said woke them up very  early in the  
 morning.We went to see the cows being 
 milked.The cows come in and are all   
 lined up in the pens.Then the cups    
 were put on the udders.When the cows  
 had finished being milked the cups    
 shot off and the milk was taken to the
 dairy.
