		<title>06Redlynch School,Gypsy Topic</title>
		<content> Just south of Lover is  an area called
 Bohemia, apparently so called because 
 gypsies lived there.This term we have 
 been finding out about the gypsy way  
 of life in 1810.We have made  benders,
 formed gypsy families and worked in   
 gypsy clothes.                        
               On June 26th we met     
 "gypsy tribes" from five other schools
 at Odstock, for a{gypsy fair}and to   
 re-enact the true story of Joshua     
 Scamp, a gypsy who was hung in 1810   
 for a crime he did not commit.        
    To our surprise we have{real }     
{travellers}in Redlynch now (July      
 1985).Their canvas topped "vardo" is  
 parked in Goggs Lane, horses and a    
 family of chickens feeding on the     
 verge.A board announces ,"Pegs for    
 sale".
