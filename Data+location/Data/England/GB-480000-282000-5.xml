		<content> There are a number of churches in the 
 survey block. Most of the churches can
 be found in{Desborough}and these are  
 the{Baptist Church, St. Giles}and the{
{United Reformed Church}which cater for
 the major religous faiths.            
 In{Rushton}there is one church, it is 
 called the{All Saints,}which plays an 
 important part in the life of the     
 community.                            
 Originally services in the{Baptist    
{Church }were held in {Braybrook}but as
 more people attended a new church was 
 built in {Desborough.}                
 When the church was less well off it  
 sold its {Sunday School}but now hopes 
 to buy it back.                       
 The minister fears vandalism in the   
 church and would like to see a        
 policeman on the beat all the time.   
 The spire of {St Giles}church has been
 struck by lightining twice.           </content>
