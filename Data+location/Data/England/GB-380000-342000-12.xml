		<content>Rev:T Houghton showed us round the     
church.St Thomas' Church in the parish 
of Newcastle, is named after Thomas the
Apostle. It is built in sandstone.     
Inside, the walls are plain white,     
with only a few memorials. The         
biggest ones are the                   
Swinnerton/Pilkington family ones who  
died in 1854 and 1855.They built the   
church and are buried underneath it.   
There is no cemetery; the water level  
is too high.There is a crucifixion     
picture rescued from the vault of      
Butterton Hall.There is one bell but   
the rope is broken. Under the          
memorials are box pews,where the Lord  
of the manor and his servants sat. The 
church banner is on the wall.About 30  
people attend services  weekly.The     
alter vases are Brass. Most of the     
books are in the record office, but we 
saw the original marriage book.        </content>
