 Cheshire. It covers Nether Alderley   
 and most of Over Alderley it is mainly
 country side and farmland but there is
 a main road going through Nether      
 Alderley. It is the A34. There are no 
 shops in this area, but there are some
 2 miles away in Alderley Edge.On the  
 A34 there is the ICI. It is a large   
 industrial complex that deals in      
 drugs. Lots of people near by work    
 there. There are different types of   
 houses mostly cottages but there are  
 some modern cottages too. There is a  
 mill owned by the National Trust that 
 you can look around. Opposite the mill
 is St Mary's church.There are 2       
 schools. On the edge is The Wizard    
 Restaurant and an information         
 centre.
