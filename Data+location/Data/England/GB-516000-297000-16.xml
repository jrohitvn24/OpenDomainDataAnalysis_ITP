		<content>  Peterborough is the headquarters of  
{British Sugar}- one of Europe's       
 biggest sugar producers. Each year,   
 the company makes more than one       
 million tonnes of Silver Spoon sugar -
 approximately half the total UK demand
 - at its thirteen factories, eleven of
 which are located in Eastern England. 
 British Sugar's links with the city go
 back to 1926 with the opening of the  
 Peterborough sugar factory. In the    
 mid-1970's, head office operations    
 were transferred from London to a     
 purpose built office complex in Oundle
 Road - the nerve centre of a          
 nationwide operation with annual      
 turnover in excess of Â£600 million.   
 The raw material, sugar beet, is grown
 by about 12,000 British farmers and   
 Peterborough factory handles the crop 
 from more than 1,000 growers operating
 within a 25 mile area around the city.</content>
