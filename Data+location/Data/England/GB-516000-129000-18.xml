		<title>18HORSHAM ARTS CENTRE &amp; SPORT</title>
		<content> The Horsham Arts Centre is a mixture  
 between a theatre, cinema, drama club,
 ballet classes and playgroup. At the  
 theatre I watched 'Cinderella' at     
 Christmas and later I watched 'I have 
 been here before'. They have some     
 quite famous people there. At the     
 cinema I watched 'Ghostbusters' and   
 'Passage to India'. They were both    
 very good. Before being the Arts      
 Centre, it was a cinema. When they    
 knocked it down everyone was angry but
 most people like it now. Also in      
 Horsham there is a town cricket club. 
 For 10 - 18 year olds St Marys School 
 also has a cricket club and play other
 schools on Saturdays. When you join   
 the cricket club you can go and see   
 any county match you want. In Horsham 
 they play county cricket against other
 counties.
