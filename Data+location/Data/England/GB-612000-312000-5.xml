		<content>      'I get up at 6.30, wash, dress   
 and prepare the breakfast and packed  
 lunches for my family of four. I am a 
 teacher and cycle to school, arriving 
 at 8.10 to check and prepare lessons  
 for the day. I work in the classroom  
 from 9.00 to 3.00 with a 15min break  
 for coffee and 1 hr. for lunch. After 
 school, I shop, prepare the evening   
 meal, do the housework and marking.   
 Then I read, garden, watch TV or talk 
 to my husband and children.'(A.Carter)
    { Kitchen Gadgets-}Every house has 
 a gas or electric cooker, some micro  
 waves. Most have washing machines but 
 a few still wash by hand. Many have   
 tumble driers, ironing is a chore.    
 Nearly all homes have fridges and     
 freezers to keep food fresh and many  
 use mixers or food processors. Fresh  
 produce is available locally but other
 foods are bought in bulk and stored.  </content>
