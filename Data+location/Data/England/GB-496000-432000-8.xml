		<content>  5 farms surround the village of      
 Little Weighton. Although this gives  
 an impression of being an agricultural
 community, the 5 farms between them   
 employ only 12 workers, half of whom  
 are employed on a casual basis.       
  All the farms have a lot of expensive
 machinery and we think that is why not
 many workers are needed.              
  Little Weighton is on the Southern   
 edge of the Yorkshire Wolds so the    
 land is quite high up and rather      
 chalky. Crops grown include winter    
 wheat, oats, barley, oil seed rape,   
 potatoes, peas, beans and grass.      
  Animals on these farms include       
 sheep,cattle and pigs.                
  The smallest farm is 145 acres and   
 the largest is 600 acres. Machinery   
 used includes tractors, combine       
 harvesters, drills, cultivators and   
 ploughs.                              </content>
