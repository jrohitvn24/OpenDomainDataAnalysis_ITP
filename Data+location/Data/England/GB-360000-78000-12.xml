{VILLAGE LIBRARY}.SHE HAS BEEN{        
{LIBRARIAN}FOR{10 YEARS}.{MRS.  ROSE}  
 WOULDN'T LIKE TO BE A{LIBRARIAN}IN A  
 BIG{CITY}BECAUSE SHE WOULD MISS THE   
 PUBLIC. THE HARDEST PART OF HER JOB   
 SHE SAYS IS TO KEEP A GOOD SELECTION  
 OF BOOKS.{MRS. ROSE}LIKES HER JOB     
 BECAUSE SHE LIKES MEETING PEOPLE AND  
 LIKES TO HEAR HOW THEY ENJOY READING  
 BOOKS. ONCE A LADY TOUCHED A BOOK ON  
 DISPLAY ON THE SHELF AND ALL THE BOOKS
 FELL DOWN LIKE A ROW OF DOMINOES.     
 EVERYONE IN THE{LIBRARY}JUST STOOD AND
 LAUGHED. SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE        
 MEETINGS AT THE{LIBRARY}AND SOMETIMES 
 PEOPLE JUST COME INTO THE{LIBRARY}TO  
 HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO, LIKE THE OLD 
 LADY WHO HAD JUST LOST HER DOG.
