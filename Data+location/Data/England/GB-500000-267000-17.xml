		<title>17Buildings in Shelton</title>
		<content> Of the 21 houses in Shelton, 3 are    
 Grade 2 Listed Buildings. Shelton     
 Hall is now a farmhouse but was once  
 part of a moated rectangular building 
 on a Medieaval site. The Old Rectoryis
 a fine Georgian building and the Old  
 Rectory Cottage is 17th Century. There
 is also a pair of semi-detachrd       
 Council houses.                       
 Shelton has several times won the Best
 Kept Village award. This is an annual 
 competition run by the Bedfordshire   
 Rural Community Council and is judged 
 by a group of people with varying     
 interests. The winner holds the trophy
 for the year and the name of the      
 village is engraved upon the cup.
