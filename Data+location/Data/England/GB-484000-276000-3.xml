On Saturday morning I get up and make  
my mum a cup of tea.When I am dressed  
I go to call for Darren Wright. We     
go to the town and play on the         
computers in Boots and W.H.Smiths.I    
have my lunch at the Kentucky Fried    
chicken. In the afternoon I meet       
my mum and sister and sometimes she    
buys us some clothes.We then choose    
a video from Supervision to watch      
when we get home.During the evening I  
watch TV until bedtime. On Sunday      
morning I get up about 9.00 am After   
breakfast I watch the video again.     
In the afternoon I call for Darren     
again and we play in his Dads yard     
where he keeps old cars.Just outside   
we have a secret den.When I get home my
mum gets me something to eat.During the
evening I play some of my Atari games.I
have a bath and go to bed at 9.00 p.m. </content>
