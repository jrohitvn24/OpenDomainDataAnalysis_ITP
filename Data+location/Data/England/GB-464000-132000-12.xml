		<title>12FOUR MARKS SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> A TYPICAL DAY:  My schoolday starts at
 6.30 a.m when I wake up.  I lie in bed
 for a while so I can wake up properly 
 and read a book.  Then I get out of   
 bed and get dressed.  I go downstairs 
 and have my breakfast.                
       I watch television for half an  
 hour and then polish my shoes.  Then I
 go upstairs, clean my teeth and at    
 8.35 a.m I go to school.  When I get  
 to school every morning, I go and see 
 my two best friends.                  
      When we get into school, we do   
 some work and at 9.05 we go to        
 assembly.  After assembly we usually  
 do some maths until playtime at 10.40 
 a.m.  At 11.00a.m playtime ends and we
 go back into school.  Usually we do   
 English until 12.30 p.m which is      
 lunchtime.  Lunch lasts for 1 hour and
 15 minutes.                           
                                       </content>
