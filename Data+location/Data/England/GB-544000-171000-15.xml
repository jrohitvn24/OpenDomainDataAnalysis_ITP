		<title>15The Railway in Sidcup Area.</title>
		<content>   The railway was{responsible for the 
{development of the area,}built in the 
 1930's. It runs from Dartford to      
 London. It mainly provides transport  
 into London for commuters, living in  
 this area.                            
   Most of the{commuters}get off at    
 Canon Street Station, which is in the 
 centre of London, thus only has       
 offices nearby and so is only open    
 Monday to Friday.                     
   Other London Stations which are busy
 with commuters and shoppers are:      
 Charing Cross, Waterloo East and      
 London Bridge.                        
  {Train passes}are quite common, to   
 avoid the queues as well as to save   
 money. In September 1985 the train    
 pass will have to be accompanied with 
 a{photocard for identifcation.}This is
 already compulsory for bus passes.
