		<content>    In June 1985 in an area between    
 South{Wilford}Endowed School and      
 Wilford Meadows School, we found wild 
 strawberries, bramble, common vetch,  
 purple clover and wild carrot growing 
 in a section of railway embankment.   
    Magpies were constantly to be seen 
 and many pairs of blackbirds. Thrushes
 and other seed eating birds like      
 linnets and greenfinches were around  
 too.                                  
    Old allotments bordering the       
 embankments had reverted to pasture   
 for horses and ponies. Within the     
 Wilford Meadows playing fields were   
 cuckoo pint, sorrel, buttercups and   
 grasses, which indicate an old,       
 undisturbed meadow. Between the       
 playing fields and the marshland, the 
 variety of vegetation provides a      
 habitat for all kinds of birds and    
 wild life.                            </content>
