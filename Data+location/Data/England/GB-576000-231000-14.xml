		<content>    On June 3rd we went to the{Old}    
{Peoples}home in Sible Hedingham.{Mrs} 
{Ranner}said she worked at Courtaulds  
 Silk Factory from 6.00am till 4.30pm. 
   {Mrs. Springett}went to our school  
 more than 70 years ago. The Headmaster
 and Headmistress were Mr.and Mrs.     
 Robinson. At school two children had a
 small plot and they planted cabbages. 
   {Mrs. Flint}lived in Alderford      
 Street in an old cottage, which only  
 had an outside toilet and that was    
 only a bucket. The old Mill in        
 Alderford Street was owned by Mr.     
 Rollingson.                           
    The{Webster sisters}had an open    
 Landau Carriage to drive around in.   
    The games they used to play were   
 Netball,Hopscotch,Spinning Tops,Hide  
 and Seek,Skipping and Blackberry.     
    There were no doorstep deliveries, 
 people had to walk to the nearest shop</content>
