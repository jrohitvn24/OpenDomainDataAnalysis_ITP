		<title>20FUTURE DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content> This area has limited potential for   
 large scale development in the        
 future.                               
 It is restricted by several factors   
 such as it's natural boundaries-the   
 canal and the riverTrent;it is not    
 located in an area with any natural   
 resources which are in great demand;  
 plus the fact that it's development   
 must have been hampered by it's close 
 proximity to the two important cities 
 of Derby and Nottingham.              
 Because it is a very picturesque place
 of some historical interest it could  
 make a contribution to the local      
 tourist industry,any other commercial 
 or industrial development is unlikely.
 Infact, the area will probably remain 
 unchanged for many years to come,thus 
 maintaining it's rural character and  
 culture.
