		<title>10CARLISLE RACE_COURSE</title>
		<content> There used to be a race_course in the 
 centre of Carlisle but it is now a    
 pitch and putt golf course.The old    
 grandstand is still there but derelict
 and has a preservation order on it.The
 present race_course at Durdar used to 
 be part of the Blackhall Estate.The   
 course was opened 56 years ago and is 
 one of only 18 dual_purpose courses   
 (flat and National Hunt racing).It was
 the first,by half an hour,to open an  
 indicator board,beating Newmarket     
 because the owner brought the day's   
 racing forward by 30 minutes.Only 3   
 full_time workers are employed,the    
 foreman,the groundsman and a tractor  
 driver.Racing is held on 18 days in   
 the year and many temporary staff are 
 taken on to run the restaurants and   
 bars.The course itself is 1.5 miles   
 long and is regarded as a tough test  
 for horses being uphill near the end. </content>
