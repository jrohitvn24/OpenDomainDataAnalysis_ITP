		<title>18FARM COUNT</title>
		<content> We took seven typical farms in our    
 area with a total of 1172 acres. This 
 showed that the average acreage was   
 approximately 170. On this acreage 566
 milking cows were kept, 155 beef      
 cattle and 173 calves in total. This  
 gave an average milking herd of about 
 80 per farm.  Only two of the farms   
 kept sheep and these had 256 between  
 them.  None of them kept pigs, one had
 a few free range poultry, while one   
 went in for poultry in a bigger way   
 and had 5000 birds. This last was a   
 small farm making more intensive use  
 of its acreage.  Another small farm   
 hired grass to graze its heifers, and 
 went in for "strip grazing",          
 restricting cattle to part of a field 
 at one time. Normally farms of over   
 200 acres support 90 to 100 dairy     
 cows.                                 
                                       </content>
