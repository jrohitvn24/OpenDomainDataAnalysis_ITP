		<content> The tumbled ruins of a wall known as  
 Irishman's Wall bisect Belstone Tor.  
 The story goes that an Irishman who   
 wished to enclose part of the moor    
 employed some of his countrymen to    
 build a considerable length of wall.  
 The locals watched the wall develop   
 and after a large portion had been    
 built, ganged together and destroyed  
 it.  After that the Irishman gave up  
 and left the area.  Watchet Hill on   
 the border of this block and the one  
 to the north has old stonecutters'    
 tracks leading to Belstone.  Belstone 
 granite was used a hundred years ago  
 for building gateposts and other      
 agricultural purposes.  The stone was 
 roughly cut on the moor and then      
 transferred to Belstone for finishing.
