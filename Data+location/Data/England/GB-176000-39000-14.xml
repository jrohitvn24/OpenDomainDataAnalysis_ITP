		<content>  We walked  into the surgery through a
 small front porch.   After that we got
 to  a  waiting  room  and  a reception
 office.   We asked the receptionist if
 we could  ask some  questions  for our
 Domesday project.    She knew the name
 Domesday immediately so she took us to
 the nursing room.                     
  In the nursing room  there was a bed,
 two  chairs  and a  pair of scales for
 weighing babies.                      
  She told us that the surgery was open
 every weekday  and  that there  were 3
 doctors,   a lady called Dr Tregaskill
 and doctors Stephens and Jackson.     
  30-40 patients are seen daily, aged  
 from birth to 98 years.               
  There are 4-5000 patients on their   
 register.                             
  There is also a surgery in Devoran.
