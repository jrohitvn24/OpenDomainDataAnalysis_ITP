		<title>13Families - Carla</title>
		<content>My name is Carla McLoughlin and I am 9.
I live near the marsh in Blackheath. We
live in a modernised old house. I have 
lots of cousins in the village. I have 
a younger brother and sister called    
Patrick and Megan. Megan is naughty    
although she is only one.              
Dad works all over the world on oil    
rigs. He works on the safety capsules. 
I have two pet cats called Mork and    
Mindy and I would like a dog, a        
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.         
I like Enid Blyton books and ghost     
stories, but I like all books too.     
School is super. I like everything ,   
from the work to the Christmas         
pantomime. My hobbies are baking,      
sewing and reading. My favourite food  
is salad, but I don't like eating      
vegetables. I would like to work with  
children, or books, when I grow up.
