		<content> The local policeman is moving shortly 
 and another policeman will be coming  
 soon.There has been a                 
 crisis of  children playing on the    
 railway.Some people have been fined   
 Â£25 for trepassing and you can be     
 prosecuted.In Siddick there is a      
 problem of vandalism. The houses are  
 boarded up because youths smash the   
 windows.If you want a house you have  
 to take the boards down but they will 
 probaby be smashed again.The crime in 
 Seaton is rather high. Seaton school  
 is always getting broken into.        
 Camerton is a small place and I think 
 that it has little crime. In school   
 the local policeman does cycle        
 proficiency every year and it takes   
 about a week. If you pass you get a   
 certificate but if you make just one  
 mistake you fail.
