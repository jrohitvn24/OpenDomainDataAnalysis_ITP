		<content> Life in the area is quiet and         
 leisurely and this is reflected in the
 homes of people living here. The{large
{houses}are gracious and well kept with
 beautiful gardens. At the other end of
 the scale are{small cottages}mainly   
 attached to farms. There is no poverty
 here. In 1948 a{council estate}of 30  
 houses, Beechfield, was built. They   
 are attractive houses with large well 
 cared for gardens. There are also some
 old people's bungalows. Many tenants  
 have been there since 1948- two are   
 buying their homes. There is no gas in
 the village.{Lighting, heating and    
{cooking}are fuelled by electricity.   
 Some houses are warmed by solid fuel  
 or by oil. There is{mains water and   
{sewage. Refuse}is collected weekly    
 from Newbury.{Milk}is delivered every 
 other day.{Letters}are delivered twice
 daily. There is no shop.              </content>
