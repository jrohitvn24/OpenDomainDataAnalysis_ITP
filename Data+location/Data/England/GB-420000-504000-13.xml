		<title>13A Day in the Life of Stephen</title>
		<content> When we got home I changed into my old
 clothes. I called for my friends Paul,
 who lives next door, Marc who lives   
 opposite and together with Roy we went
 down the lane to the corner of the    
 nearby wood where we made a den.      
 No-one could see us from the lane.    
                                       
 Later on Mum came looking for us as it
 was time for tea. After tea we played 
 on the{microcomputer}using the{games  
{cassettes}of 'Hopper', 'Bandits at 3  
 o'clock' and 'Overdrive'.             
                                       
 Finally we got washed, changed into   
 our pyjamas and went to bed at the end
 of  a  typical  day  in  our  school  
 holidays.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
