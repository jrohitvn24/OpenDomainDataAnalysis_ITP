		<title>01Exbourne and Area</title>
		<content> In 1845 Exbourne was described as a   
 pleasant village on the east side of  
 the picturesque valley of the Okement 
 river,5 miles E.S.E. of Hatherleigh.  
 It is still so, but the 593 population
 has dwindled to aprox.300.            
  The area includes the ancient Parish 
 of Honeychurch,present electoral roll 
 23+2 children.                        
 It is a very rural area,having been   
 farmed since Saxon times.Many of our  
 farms were mentioned in the First     
 Domesday Book.Some even retain the    
 same acreage.                         
   The last Lord of the Manor,Sir Roper
 Lethbridge,died in 1919.He had built  
 the present Village Hall in 1884,used 
 for so many village activities.It is  
 used as a classroom part of the week. 
 The landscape may not have changed,but
 the people have;so the village has    
 too.                                  </content>
