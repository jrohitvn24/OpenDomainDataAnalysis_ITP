		<title>11Burscough-Food and Shopping</title>
		<content>by Rachael                             
My mum does most of the shopping in our
house and I sometimes go with her.We   
usually buy the basic things like bread
,butter,milk and a few things like     
sweets and crisps.We don't buy any     
fruit and vegetables as work on a fruit
and vegetable stall.We go to a         
supermarket once per week which is only
two miles away.There is plenty of car  
parking space there.                   
My mother and I both prepare food.A    
typical meal is potatoes,vegetables and
steak.We also eat a lot of fish,salad, 
chips,cheese,eggs and hamburgers.In our
kitchen there is a fan oven and so     
things cook faster than on recipies.in 
iwe mainly cook joints of meat.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
