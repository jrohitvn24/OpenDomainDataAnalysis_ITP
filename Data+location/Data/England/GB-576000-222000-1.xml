{East Braintree is mainly residential  
 and does not include the centre of the
 town, although there are some shops.  
 The houses are a mixture of of new    
 estates and very old timbered         
 buildings. There are several streets  
 of council housing. Included in the   
 area are a swimming pool and leisure  
 centres, and several playing fields.  
 Small industrial units have been built
 on the outskirts of the town and      
 Crittall Windows is a major           
 manufacturing industry. Towards the   
 Eastern edge is open countryside with 
 several farms and a village called    
 STISTED. The rivers Brain, Pant and   
 Blackwater run through the area and   
 there are pleasant river walks.       
 There is a branch line Railway Station
 serving London commutors.             </content>
