		<title>03THE NEW ESTATES</title>
		<content> Many new houses have been built in the
 last 5 years in the {West End of      
 Clevedon.Building is still going on.  
                                       
 In a survey we held we asked people   
 about living on a new estate.         
 Everyone said the people were         
 friendly.Most of the families had     
 moved because of the husband's        
 job.Half the people said they could   
 do their shopping easily,although     
 three quarters said a shopping @rcinct
 would improve things. Most people said
 they liked the area and just under    
 half said they had things wrong with  
 their house. Over half said the new   
 school was near enough and under half 
 thought that no more building should  
 take place.                           
 Because of these estates Clevedon is  
 changing more quickly now than ever.
