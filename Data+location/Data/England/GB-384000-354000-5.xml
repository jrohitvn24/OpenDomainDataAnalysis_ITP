		<title>05 HOUSING IN KIDSGROVE</title>
		<content>  Our area is varied, including rural, 
suburban and urban districts. The      
houses are also varied, ranging from   
200 year old stone cottages to houses  
still under construction.              
  The stone used to build the cottages 
was hewn from the nearby hillsides so  
that the cottages appear as part of the
landscape.                             
  Many of the locals work in the mines 
and live in houses previously owned by 
the N.C.B. The houses have   now been  
bought by   the local council, or in   
some cases by   the occupants, but the 
estate will be   known for years to    
come as the   "Miners' Estate".        
  More and more privately owned houses 
are being built. Some of these are on  
estates where one house is very much   
like all the rest.Others are designed  
to the owners specification.Most of the
houses have well-tended gardens.       </content>
