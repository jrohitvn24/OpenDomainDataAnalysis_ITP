		<title>06CRANHAM COMMON</title>
		<content> Cranham Common is a big grassland. It 
 is owned by Major Birchall and Mr.    
 Workman. It is about 90 acres and is  
 in 4 main areas. We have three        
 different types of orchid - bee orchid
 , pyramid orchid and butterfly orchid.
 There also are cowslips on our common.
 In the summer cows graze on the common
  from farms around the village. We    
 have two types of snakes and one type 
 of lizard - adders, grass snakes and  
 common lizards. There are a few trees 
 on our common, mainly Silver Birch and
 Hazel. A fire for Guy Fawkes Night is 
 held right on the top of the common.  
 Near that place is the cricket field. 
 We have lots of horses ridden on the  
 common, and a riding school situated  
 on the common, owned by Mrs. Hemming.
