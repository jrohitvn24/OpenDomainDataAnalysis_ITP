		<title>20SUMMERCOURT FAIR</title>
		<content> The fair dates from 1201. Originally  
 the fair was held at Penhale but for  
 reasons unknown was transfered to     
 Summercourt in about 1711.Gypsies in  
 tents and high class travellers were  
 typical visitors to the fair in those 
 days.Much trading was done and the    
 toss of a coin would sometimes secure 
 a pony for between Â£1.50 and Â£5.00    
 cheap jacks squabbled over the best   
 pitches and local youths pitted their 
 strength against the booth boxers and 
 wrestlers.The fair today has changed, 
 fewer animals are sold ,market traders
 dominate the edge of the central fair 
 field in which there are many booths  
 and stalls such as dodgems,roundabouts
 big wheels, noahs arks and twisters.  
 Fair day,25th September draws many    
 local people to Summercourt for an    
 annual reunion.The police have to     
 close the road through the village.   </content>
