 We spoke to some of the people who    
 have lived in Tow Law all their lives.
                                       
{One 80 year old, Mr Robinson, thought 
{that it was the friendliness of the   
{local people that made him not want to
{move away.                            
                                       
 "Since 1945 new estates have been     
 built and the railway closed in the   
 1960's. I remember having to catch the
 train to go shopping in Crook (4      
 miles). Few traces of the railway now 
 remain."                              
                                       
 "The old back-to-back houses have all 
 been altered or demolished but I can  
 still remember the days when I worked 
 in the office of a local colliery."
