		<title>13SEWSTERN VILLAGE III</title>
		<content> The Village Hall is the main gayhering
 point which took some 20 years to     
 raise money for, but in 1961 the hall 
 was erected and now holds Bingo,      
 Dances, Wedding Receptions, Civil Aid.
 The Horticultural Show here is an     
 annual event with a very high standard
 in garden produce, culinery and craft.
 Civil Aid is a relative newcomer but  
 about once a year sees an influx of   
 people to take an active part in      
 simulated accident situations to see  
 how the civil aiders can cope. The    
 outer area of the village lhas some   
 fine walks called the Green Lanes.  In
 the season the sound of guns are heard
 with regular Pheasant shoots.  All the
 aforesaid makes this small rural      
 community a happy one through the     
 efforts of all the villagers for their
 help and suport of one another enables
 Sewstern to Flourish.                 </content>
