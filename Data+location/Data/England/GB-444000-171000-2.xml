		<content> Winterbourne is typical of many rural 
 villages presently undergoing a change
 in population structure but classed as
 a "dying village" in the 1950's       
 because of its high percentages of    
 pensioners who lived in old houses    
 with big gardens.Since the 1960's and 
 the opening of the Motorway young     
 couples both earning good salaries in 
 Newbury,Reading and Swindon have      
 afforded the inflated house prices,   
 necessary repairs and received        
 planning permission for single houses 
 in the large gardens compatible with  
 the thatched cottages so the village  
 retains its compact linear structure. 
 Children attend primary schools in    
 Boxford or Chieveley;the 19 century   
 school is a pottery; other amenities  
 are buses,telephones,pub and a post   
 box.Having cars the population shops  
 and seeks recreation elsewhere.       </content>
