		<title>14SUTTON VENY FLOWER SHOW</title>
		<content>   The Flower Show in Sutton Veny is   
 something that happens once a year in 
 August on the field by the village    
 hall.  The adults take fruit          
 and vegetables to be judged in the    
 competitions.  The things we do for   
 the competitions in the show are      
 paintings and designs, flower         
 arranging and cooking.                
                                       
   They sell drinks, ice-cream, sweets 
 and popcorn.  They have games to play.
 In one game you have to throw three   
 balls into a goldfish bowl, another   
 game you throw balls into a clowns    
 face.  There is usually a lucky dip   
 where you always win something.       
 At the end of the show they give out  
 cups for the best flowers,            
 pictures,vegetables and cooking.
