		<content> Many houses in Donnington have flat   
 rooves.They were built during World   
 War II when there was a shortage of   
 wood.They have recently been insulated
 and retiled. The houses are either in 
 sets of four or are semi-detached.Most
 of the homes in the area are council  
 houses. The Jubilee Avenue estate was 
 built in 1935.These houses have been  
 modernised in the last few years.The  
 most recent council houses to be built
 are those around Coronation Drive and 
 The Common which were built in the    
 1960s.Elderly people are well catered 
 for.Bungalows at Lawndale are set in  
 open plan gardens with a hall on the  
 site.Although close to a busy road,it 
 is very quiet there.Summercroft, on   
 Church Road,is a single storey home   
 for people who need a little nursing  
 help.Across the road is Willow Court,a
 block of flats for the elderly.       </content>
