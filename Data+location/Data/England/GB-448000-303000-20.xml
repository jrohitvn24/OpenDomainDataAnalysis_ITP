		<title>20The View From My Window</title>
		<content> Out of my bedroom window I can see the
 railway line and Kirby Lane.In the    
 winter and sometimes in the summer,   
 when there has been a big wind, you   
 can see right over the railway line to
 the houses on the other side.All the  
 trains which run on this line are     
 trains which carry goods.They do not  
 carry people.                         
                          {Elizabeth.  
 The view out of the bedroom is a road,
 a field, with horses, and a cottage   
 with a thatched roof.I like what I    
 see.

 From my bedroom window I can see my   
 mum's flowers and shrubs and the      
 tarmac.I can see grass,the pavement   
 and the road.I can see our neighbours 
 bungalow and George's house.I can see 
 cars and people walking dogs.
