		<content>      Elworth Hall County Primary      
 School is the newest of the four      
 primary schools in the area.The other 
 three schools are more 'formal' in    
 design whilst Elworth Hall is an 'open
 -plan'building of echelon design and  
 was opened in 1977.                   
      There are approximately 160      
 children in the school and seven      
 members of staff i.e. six class       
 teachers and the headteacher.The other
 three primary schools vary slightly in
 size e.g. the largest has about 240   
 pupils and nine members of staff.     
     The six classes at Elworth Hall   
 include three infant and three junior 
 classes.In order to limit class sizes 
 certain groups have mixed age bands   
 e.g.the oldest group consists of 8    
 third-year and 20 fourth-year juniors.
 The largest class size in the school  
 is at present 32 children.            </content>
