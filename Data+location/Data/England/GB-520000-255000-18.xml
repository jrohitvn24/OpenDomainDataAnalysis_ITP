		<title>18Flying In Abbotsley</title>
		<content> On Tuesday the 11th of June 1985 our  
 class went to Abbotsley.Our group went
 to Abbotsley's parachute club.Our     
 group leader Mr Harding pilots a plane
 for the club.We asked him a number of 
 questions.One of the answers that he  
 gave suprised us, that the plane he   
 flies took 4O gallons of petrol every 
 two flying hours.He showed us what all
 the knobs do and we were allowed to   
 sit in the pilot's seat and put the   
 head phones on. Then we took a walk   
 down the runway.Mr Harding told us    
 that most parachutists come from      
 different parts of Britain some times 
 from abroad.About two years ago there 
 was a tragic accident when for some   
 reason or other a man's parachute     
 didn't open properly and he died on   
 impact.
