		<title>16Events in Alfriston</title>
		<content> There are a number of events in       
 Alfriston which take place each year. 
 One of them is the fair. It is a      
 village event which includes stalls   
 and games run by villagers and takes  
 place on the village green.           
                                       
 Morris dancers come to Alfriston 6    
 times a year. Everyone comes out of   
 their houses to see them dance down   
 the street.                           
                                       
 An old tradition has been restarted   
 again this year,the tug of war across 
 the River Cuckmere. One team pulls    
 from one bank and one from the other. 
 The winner pulls the opposition in.   
                                       
 On Christmas Eve,Father Christmas     
 visits all the houses in the village  
 delivering presents.
