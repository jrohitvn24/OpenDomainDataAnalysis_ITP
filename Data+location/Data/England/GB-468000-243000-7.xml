		<content>Enter the churchyard by the lychgate.  
The tower and porch were built in the  
13th century.  High up on the tower is 
a Norman window and there are five     
bells within.  The porch floor is      
constructed from up-ended slates.  The 
oldest part of the church is the west  
arch which is pointed, with two bands  
of leafy ornament.  The altar pictures 
depicting the Annunciation,            
Presentation and Crucifixion are gold  
and mosaic.  Adjacent to the choir     
stalls is the vicar's seat with        
carvings of dragons on its arms.  The  
pulpit was carved in the Middle Ages.  
There is an old oak chest about 2.5    
metres long.  The vicar also serves    
Paulerspury and Wicken.  The church has
a choir of 13 and the Sunday School has
12 pupils who attend every fortnight.
