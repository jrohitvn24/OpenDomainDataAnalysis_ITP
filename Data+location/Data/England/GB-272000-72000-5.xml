		<content>      There are granite buildings and  
 boundaries of various periods from    
 medieval times.Scobitor Farm has had a
 continuous occupation from Saxon times
 and is mentioned in {Domesday Book}.In
 the 13th. century it was passed to the
 monks of Torre Abbey by the Bokeland  
 family and remained the property of   
 the Abbey until the 16th. century.The 
 present house was enlarged in the late
 19th.century and incorporates two     
 Dartmoor long houses. On the adjacent 
 tor is a tower-like structure built in
 1868 for an unknown purpose.          
      A drift road,formerly used for   
 taking animals onto Buckland Common   
 for grazing goes from Buckland village
 past Bowden Farm.Large beech trees    
 border the righthand side where it    
 passes Birch Wood.The road funnels out
 onto the moor through Ripman's Gate.
