		<title>11NW.SHERBORNE:OLD HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>  The{isolation hospital}is a derelict 
 brick building standing on the west   
 side of Trent Path Lane a mile out of 
 Sherborne at OS ref 623173. It was    
 used, up until the end of the last    
 war, to isolate people suffering from 
{fevers}and highly{infectious diseases.
 There is one main building and two    
 smaller buildings at its side. It can 
 be reached by a sandy lane leading    
 from the B3148 road. It would have had
 a{beautiful view}to the south, across 
 the Sherborne valley to the hills     
 beyond. It is now overgrown with      
 stinging nettles, dog-roses and       
 various other plants and flowers, and 
 surrounded by young trees, mostly     
 elder. There are signs that it is used
 from time to time by people{sleeping  
{rough.}
