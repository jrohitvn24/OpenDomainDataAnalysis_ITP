		<content>  There are several main shopping areas
 in Portsmouth and Cosham High Street  
 serves the Northern part of the city. 
 There is a cinema, some large         
 supermarkets, reasonable parking      
 space, a railway station, a bus       
 terminus and a wide variety of small  
 shops. Public opinion was sought on   
 the following:-                       
 1) Does the area require a department 
 store ?                               
  On the whole men did not want any    
 more shops at all, while the ladies   
 would have liked a store of the 'Marks
 and Spencer' or 'C &amp; A' type.         
 2) Is the area kept clean and tidy ?  
  When we were there it was quite tidy 
 and the majority of those asked said  
 it was usually good.                  
 3) How far away do you live ?         
  90% of the shoppers lived in the     
 local area.                           </content>
