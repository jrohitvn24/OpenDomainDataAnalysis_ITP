		<title>10Gillie's Day (Aged 11)</title>
		<content>  At 8:00am I'm still snoring. Mum     
 drags me out of bed. After scrubbing  
 my teeth I go downstairs in my school 
 uniform, eat my breakfast, get my bag 
 and cycle to school. The whistle goes 
 and we line up. Today is Wednesday and
 these are the lessons. First we go    
 down to the hall for assembly. Then we
 go back to our classes for English.   
 Our language work is from Ginn 360,   
 there are work cards and sheets to    
 fill in about a story. Maths next, we 
 are copying angles.Then we watch a    
 TV.programme which sets us a practical
 problem to solve. After lunch we watch
 a sex education programme called      
 Living and Growing which all the      
 fourth year watch before going to     
 Hinchingbroke school. Next its games, 
 I play rounders. After school I go to 
 gardening club where we plant seeds. I
 cycle home, have a snack and watch TV.</content>
