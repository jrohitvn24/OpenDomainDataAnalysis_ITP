		<title>17BIRD LIFE ON THE LUGG FLATS</title>
		<content>    The Lugg Flats lie below the 50    
 metre contour and due to the seasonal 
 flooding of the River Lugg, consist of
 very fertile natural grassland.       
    The Lugg Flats or "Meadows", as    
 they are sometimes known, are very    
 attractive to birds.                  
    In winter there are Lapwings and   
 migrants such as Redwings and         
 Fieldfare and during flooding,        
 Mallards, Teel, Wigeon, Mute Swan,    
 Snipe, and gulls galore, feed in the  
 area. The gulls are mainly of the     
 Lesser Black Back variety and they    
 make a daily excursion from the Severn
 Estuary up the course of the River Wye
 to return, during the evening, as     
 light fades.                          
    During the dry summer months bird  
 life is scarce apart from the         
 occasional scavenging Rook and Carrion
 Crow and flocks of Starlings.         </content>
