		<content> The main type of farming is the       
 cultivation of arable crops. Most of  
 the land within the D-block is farmed 
 by Mr. Mailer of Park Farm.           
  Fifteen years ago oil seed rape was  
 hardly grown at all,potatoes and sugar
 beet grew instead. The clay content in
 the local soil made heavy work for    
 these root crops and so the farmers   
 swopped to the new crop which is now  
 very popular. Grain crops and peas are
 also grown.                           
  A field manager advises Mr. Mailer   
 about his crop. For instance when to  
 spray against the weevil,the crops    
 worst pest which makes the pod rotten.
 The harvested crop is stored on the   
 farm before being sold to a local     
 merchant.                             
  He also keeps a beef herd, which is  
 uncommon in the area as is the dairy  
 herd kept by a neighbouring farmer.   </content>
