		<title>13A SENIOR CITIZEN OF 1985</title>
		<content> Nutshalling Close, bungalows for      
 Senior Citizens on the Calmore Estate,
 is a very pleasant place to live      
 according to Mrs McAdam a resident for
 3\ years.{ Her great joy is living    
{next to the schools,watching and      
{listening to the pupils enjoying      
{themselves at work and play.}She      
 misses the children at holiday        
 times.The fresh country air of the    
 estate is also enjoyed,although when  
 the weather is bad she does not like  
 having to wait for a bus to take her  
 to the shops.{Friends and relatives   
{from outside the area often had       
{difficulty in finding her, since the  
{estate is not very well sign posted.  
 They like being away from the noise   
 of the traffic and although they are  
 sometimes disturbed by noise from the 
 pub they live together as good        
 neighbours enjoying the pleasant area.</content>
