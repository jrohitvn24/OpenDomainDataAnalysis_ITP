		<content>    After passing over Magdalen Bridge 
 in Oxford, The Flying Machine went by 
 way of Henley, Maidenhead and over    
 Hounslow Heath to Hammersmith and so  
 into London along Knightsbridge to the
 Gloucester Coffee House in Piccadilly 
 where some passengers would end their 
 journey. And then on down The         
 Haymarket and The Strand to the       
 Bolt-and-Tun in Fleet Street. The fare
 from Gloucester to London was twenty  
 three shillings and eight passengers  
 were carried. On the next page is a   
 full description of an advert for the 
 Gloucester Flying Machine taken from  
 The Gloucester Journal of 1756.
