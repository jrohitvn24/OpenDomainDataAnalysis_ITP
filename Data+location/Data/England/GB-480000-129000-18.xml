 recreational centre. It caters for the
 young and old, and has activities     
 inside and out of school life. The    
 community come here during the day,   
 evenings and holidays to take pleasure
 in the interests provided. These      
 interests can be coached or there for 
 your personal use. Apart from the     
 obvious sporting facilities there are 
 many aspects of creative studies, such
 as metalwork, sewing. For the more    
 outgoing types there are discos and   
 musical productions. YOu can play an  
 instrument. The Community Centre is a 
 place for friends and the community to
 meet and enjoy the company of others  
 who have come here to enjoy the       
 activities provided.
