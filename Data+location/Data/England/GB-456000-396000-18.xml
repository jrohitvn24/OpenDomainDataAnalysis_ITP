		<title>18LOVERSALL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Loversall village stands on a smaller 
 hill north of Wadworth. The church at 
 Loversall was built around 1100. It is
 situated like Wadworth church at the  
 top of the hill. South east of the    
 church is Loversall hall, it has seven
 and a half acres of grounds and was   
 built around 1809 on the site of an   
 earlier dwelling. It is now used by   
 Colbear advertising. The Loversall    
 water wheel was constructed in 1800.  
 The 6 foot high Wheel is a breast     
 wheel and was renovated in 1976 by Mr 
 J Henderson. The main road has by     
 passed the village but the bus service
 still goes through the centre. It     
 remains a very small community with a 
 small amount of new building.
