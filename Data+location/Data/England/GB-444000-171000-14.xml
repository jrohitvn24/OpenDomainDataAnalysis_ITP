		<title>14THE FARMING YEAR</title>
		<content> In Autumn on any given day four       
 tractors would be at work in varous   
 fields,one pulling a culitivator to   
 break up the soil to nine inches deep,
 the second breaking it down more      
 deeply, the third making the sowing   
 bed and the fourth sowing the Winter  
 barley. Other Autumn jobs are fencing 
 and final spraying. In Winter the     
 cattle have to be fed and bedded up,  
 yards cleaned and any concreting      
 done.In Spring fields are harrowed    
 over,fertilized and sown.The crops    
 sprout in ten days and the second     
 spraying is done.In Summer the bulk of
 the crops are sprayed again.Silage is 
 made in June.July is harvest time.The 
 combine is started up at ten a.m when 
 the dew has dried and then kept going 
 until nine p.m. Paper work is done in 
 the evenings throughout the year.
