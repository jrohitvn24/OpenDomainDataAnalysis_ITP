		<title>05PLAYING THE PIANO</title>
		<content> I said to my dad I would like to play 
 the piano,because I saw Liberace      
 playing the piano at one of his       
 concert's,and I thought that I would  
 be the same. My dad found a piano     
 teacher and I went for my first       
 lesson. Three years later I'm still   
 playing the piano. When I come in from
 school I go upstairs into my room and 
 practice. At half past six every      
 monday night I go to my lesson,my     
 lesson starts at 7:00 to 7:45. I      
 practice my piano an hour a night. I  
 practice 2 pieces of music, scales,   
 aural, sight reading and theory. You  
 can take 8 grades I have taken and    
 passed the first two. When you first  
 start playing the piano it's a bit    
 boring but as you get more advanced it
 gets more exciting. When i have passed
 my exams I would like to be a piano   
 teacher.                              </content>
