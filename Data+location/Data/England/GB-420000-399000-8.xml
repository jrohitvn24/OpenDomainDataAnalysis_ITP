		<title>08Hunshelf's history.</title>
		<content>  Hunshelf appears to have been settled
 in Anglo_Saxon and Viking times       
 judging by placenames.For instance,{  
{"Carr Head"}is associated with a      
 Viking settlement.There are several   
 springs in the area,as well as two    
 "cloughs",indicating past             
 communication problems.An important   
 landowner,Major De Wend Fenton lived  
 in the centre of Hunshelf. In the     
 past 200 years,quarries and pits for  
 stone,coal and iron ore have operated 
 in the area.A hexagonal stone monument
 in Hunshelf bears witness to this.The 
 centre of Hunshelf has links with the 
 salt trade in Cheshire and Lancashire 
 through{Salter Hill Lane,Tenter Lane  
 and{Cloth Hall Farm}indicate          
 Hunshelf's former links with the      
 cotton trade.In 1794 Jonathon Denton  
 tried to establish a cotton mill,which
 later became Samuel Foxes steel works.</content>
