		<title>09Buildings in Hadstock</title>
		<content> The centre of Hadstock is a triangular
 village green, from which roads       
 and short lanes lead off in several   
 directions.  Most of the houses in the
 village are several hundreds of years 
 old.                                  
    Some are plastered, over a timber  
 frame; one large house has exposed    
 vertical studwork.  There is a cottage
 clad in overlapping horizontal boards,
 treated with dark brown stain.  Most  
 old houses still have old windows,    
 with many small panes of glass in     
 frames which slide horizontally to    
 open.  Roofs are of tile, some        
 flat, some wavy pantiles; a few are   
 thatched.                             
    The old schoolhouse is used as a   
 village hall.  Once there was a       
 thriving market and several inns; the 
 King's Head is the only public house  
 now.                                  </content>
