		<title>13A DAY IN MY LIFE-ETTON 2</title>
		<content> (CONT.P.12) We spent lots of money!   
 When we returned home I played on the 
 computer with Duncan,my friend Sophie 
 and her brother Tim.At 11.40 my dad   
 drove me to Beverley for riding at    
 Bleach Yard stables.We rode on the    
 Westwood.My pony was a small dun      
 called Pickles.At 1.00 p.m. dad picked
 me up and we went to Beverley market  
 and bought some grapes,then returned  
 the library books.At home after a     
 cheese and lettuce sandwich I called  
 for Sophie.There was to be a barbecue 
 party later at my house so we cycled  
 to Cherry and bought marshmallows to  
 toast.At 5.00 the Marshals and Whites(
 our friends) arrived.We had a smashing
 time playing French Cricket and       
 stuffing ourselves with chicken,      
 sausages beefburgers and kebabs.At    
 9.00 we all went inside to watch the  
 'Live Aid' concert on television.     </content>
