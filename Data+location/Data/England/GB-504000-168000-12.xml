		<title>12QUEEN MARY SAILING CLUB</title>
		<content>  There is a big reservoir near our    
 school which belongs to {Thames Water}
 .Once upon a time no one was allowed  
 to use it for sailing but then they   
 gave their permission.Now there is a  
 big {Sailing Club} up on the          
 reservoir.It is like a great big lake 
 1.25 miles across and 3 miles         
 long.They do all sorts of sailing and 
 board sailing there as well.There are 
 10 safety boats there,with one on duty
 at all times.                         
  There is an area where sailing is    
 prohibited so that water birds can    
 live there in peace.                  
  In rough weather the waves can get so
 big that they splash right up over the
 clubhouse.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
