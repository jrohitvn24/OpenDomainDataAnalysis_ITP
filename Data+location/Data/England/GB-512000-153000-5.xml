		<content> High class housing covers most of the 
 block. Since 1950 the population has  
 grown very rapidly, encouraged by the 
 road and rail transport to work places
 in London and the local towns. Every  
 possible site has been developed or   
 infilled and now there is virtually no
 spare land left, despite the pressure 
 exerted by the new M25 motorway.      
 Consequently, prices have soared; a   
 house built in 1950 for less than     
 Â£3000 now sells for Â£70-80000. Large  
 detached houses are being built for   
 Â£150000 and houses with 4/5 bedrooms, 
 2 bathrooms and double garages change 
 hands for this sum. Semi-detached post
 war houses fetch Â£65000, 1930s        
 terraced fetch Â£45000. Apart from     
 leasehold flats, there is little      
 available for less than Â£40000 and as 
 a result many young house purchasers  
 are forced to look elsewhere.         </content>
