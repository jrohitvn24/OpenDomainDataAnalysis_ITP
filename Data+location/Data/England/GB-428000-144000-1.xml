		<title>01SIX HAMPSHIRE VILLAGES.</title>
		<content>   Arable and grazing land covers most 
 of this beautiful rural area which    
 includes the villages of Amport and   
 Monxton, Kimpton, Thruxton, Fyfield   
 and Weyhill. Thatched cottages        
 contrast with modern houses and       
 council estates. Chalk streams meander
 and footpaths link the farms.         
   Primary schools at Amport, Kimpton  
 and Weyhill serve the area. There are 
 five churches, three village halls and
 eight public houses.                  
   Amport has a Village Green and      
 Amport House, while Monxton Village   
 Hall serves both villages. Kimpton and
 Thruxton skirt Thruxton aerodrome and 
 racing circuit. Racehorses are trained
 at Fyfield. Weyhill has Dunnings      
 construction firm. The busy A303 runs 
 through the village and a bypass is   
 under construction, passing the local 
 Hawk Conservancy.                     </content>
