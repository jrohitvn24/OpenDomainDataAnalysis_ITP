		<content> Many people are under the mistaken    
 impression that because it is a 'New  
 Town' that Basildon has no historical 
 background,no roots,no identity. This 
 is far from the truth.                
 The name Basildon itself is of Saxon  
 origin and means 'Beorhtels Hill'. In 
 the first Domesday Book survey in 1086
 it is shown as Belesduna or           
 Bertesduna. certain land-owning       
 families are mentioned in the earlier 
 historical records.                   
 The Town Centreis built around what   
 was the site of Barstable Hall;this   
 manor-house was once held by Odo      
 Bishop of Bayeux and half brother to  
 William the Conqueror. During the     
 building of roads and houses, much    
 evidence of links with the past were  
 discovered.
