		<title>18Social Concerns</title>
		<content>   Many of the people who live in our  
 area are part of an old established   
 farming community.The matters which   
 concern them and their attitudes to   
 things are to do mainly with keeping  
 the beauty and peace of the           
 surrounding area intact.              
   Most social concern expressed would 
 be about new buildings which would    
 affect the life of one,or more than   
 one member of the community.          
   There has been some controversy     
 recently,reported in the local        
 newspaper,about a barn which had been 
 erected without the necessary planning
 permission.This barn was erected in   
 Bromsash to be used for the intensive 
 rearing of calves.A Department of the 
 Environment inspector has ruled that  
 the barn must be demolished.
