		<content> We found out how{leisure}time is spent
 after school and at weekends.Most     
 girls go to Brownies and most boys go 
 to Cubs.These clubs are run on similar
 lines,games are played and badges are}
 earned.                               
{ Cubs}play{games}like poison and      
 traffic lights but also they work to  
 earn{badges.}Everyone tries to earn   
 their arrow badges because they are   
 the highest ones.For each arrow you do
 12 tests,3 tests of 4 different       
 things.                               
{ Brownies}play games like rabbit      
 hutches and ladders.They fill in their
 Brownie books by answering            
 questions.The best badge is the       
 Highway badge.Then when you are old   
 enough you can join the               
 Guides.Children enjoy being part of a 
 club because it is good fun and it    
 stops them from being bored.          </content>
