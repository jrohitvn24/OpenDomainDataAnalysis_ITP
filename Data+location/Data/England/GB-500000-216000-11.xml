		<title>11Farming in Kensworth Area</title>
		<content> During the 1980s farming patterns have
 changed.Dairy farming is no longer    
 practised here,though one or two house
 cows may be seen.Beef cattle,sheep,   
 pigs and poultry are few in number.   
 Farmers have become retailers as well 
 as producers with the growth of farm  
 shops.Horses play a large part in the 
 rural scene with local stables        
 providing riding &amp; livery facilities. 
 Scurry ponies &amp; four in hand carriage 
 driving enthusiasts travel the lanes. 
 Cereal farming is the major type of   
 farming now with wheat,barley,oats,   
 oilseed rape,and some potatoes grown. 
 Fields are larger and many hedgerows  
 have disappeared,but wild life is     
 catered for in areas of heath and     
 woodland.Numbers of people engaged in 
 agriculture are relatively few,big    
 machines replacing them enabling      
 increased production without drudgery.</content>
