		<title>02THE HAMLET OF AISBY.</title>
		<content> This hamlet,linked to the village of  
 Oasby in the block to the north,has   
 about 60 inhabitants.It has become    
 quite an expensive rural residential  
 area with former farmhouses and farm  
 cottages enlarged and modernised and  
 with some large private modern houses.
 Even so the hamlet still presents a   
 pleasant rural appearance with its    
 buildings grouped round 2 large open  
 grassed areas.The hamlet lies on the  
 east edge of the former Oasby Cow     
 Common which is now used as the Oasby 
 Village Cricket Ground.Only 1 farmer  
 still lives and works in Aisby and all
 other workers work outside the block. 
 All education takes place outside the 
 block in the neighbouring market town 
 of Sleaford.There are no amenities    
 except post box and telephone.
