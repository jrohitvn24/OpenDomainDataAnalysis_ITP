 In a barn we saw 43 bales of hay which
 had been collected from 3 acres.Hay is
 grass which has been cut and dried for
 5 days before it is baled.It is used  
 for feeding the cattle which come in  
 first for the winter.The bales of hay 
 are cylindrical.They are about 1 metre
 in diameter and about one and a half  
 metres long.{                         
{Silage}                               
 In the yard we saw a pile of large    
 black polythene bags covered with     
 netting.These contain silage.Silage is
 grass which is stored while it is wet.
 The netting is to protect the bags    
 from birds and small animals,as the   
 silage would be spoiled if air got    
 into the bags.                        
{Bedding}                              
 We saw bales of shredded newspaper    
 (unsold copies) now used for bedding. </content>
