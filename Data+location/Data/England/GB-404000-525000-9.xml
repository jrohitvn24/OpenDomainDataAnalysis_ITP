		<title>09RELIGION IN WOODLAND-CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The majority of people do not attend 
 the churches.My family go to church   
 every week but some only go when it is
 a family service.More old people than 
 young people attend. In the winter    
{attendence}is low.Approximately eleven
 attend services at Woodland about     
 fifty at St.Johns and nine at Chapel. 
   I attend Church of England.The{Vicar
 is{Rev.N King}he has been Vicar for   
 one year.                             
   There are two Church of England     
 churches, St.Marys Woodland built     
 in 1915 and St.Johns Lynesack built in
 1847. When there are no services at   
 Woodland we go to Lynesack. The       
 services last about 1 hour 15 minutes.
  The{Methodist Chapel}in the village  
 is 159 years old and seats 150 people.
 The{Minister}is{Mr N. Wakeling.}There 
 are no activities connected with the  
 Chapel.                               </content>
