		<title>14FARM MACHINERY &amp; MILKPARLOUR</title>
		<content> The Massey Ferguson machinery includes
 haybalers;two tractors;muckspreaders; 
 haybob,which turns the hay;the forage 
 harvester, which transfers the grass  
 to the trailer;the slurry auger,which 
 sucks up the slurry to load it into   
 the spreader.They use diesel engines. 
  The cows are milked at 6am and 4pm.  
 While the cows are being milked they  
 are fed cow cake.10 cows can go into  
 the parlour at one time,but only 5 can
 be milked.A group of 6 tubes (cluster)
 is placed on the cow's teats and the  
 milk is sucked into a glass collecting
 jar(which has a 30 litre capacity). A 
 pipe takes the milk from the jar into 
 the bulk tank(which has a 1400 litre  
 capacity). This is collected at about 
 9am by road tanker and taken to Well- 
 ington Dairy. 810 litres of milk are  
 produced daily in Summer and 1100     
 litres in Winter.                     </content>
