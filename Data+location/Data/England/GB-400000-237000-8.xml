 We interviewed Mr Shaw the present    
 owner of the now disused mill.  He    
 said that the Mill was closed down in 
 1947.  Mr Shaw came to the Mill in    
 1960, 25 years ago.  The oldest part  
 of the Mill dates back to the 18th    
 century.  It was used to grind barley 
 and wheat for flour.  It was also used
 to make cider with the water wheel.   
 The water wheel is still visible.  Mr 
 Shaw now uses the Old Mill as a base  
 for his woodwork. Several of the      
 residents of the village remember the 
 Mill when it was still working and was
 also used as a bakery.
