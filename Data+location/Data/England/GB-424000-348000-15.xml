		<title>15     PUBLIC HOUSES</title>
		<content>  Kirk Ireton has two pubs. One, called
 The{Barley Mow}is 400 years old. Part 
 of the T.V. programme "The Nanny" was 
 filmed there.                         
  The{Bull's Head}is the other public  
 house, but it might close down and a  
 housing estate be built there instead.
 In the{Bull's Head}people play darts, 
 dominoes and pool. They win trophies. 
  Many villagers do not want to lose   
 the{Bull's Head}even if they think it 
 is a good idea to build some cheaper  
 houses. One local resident told us,   
{ "What this village needs is a proper 
{local pub i.e. one that is welcoming  
{to all sections of village society, is
{prepared to house local pub teams, is 
{clean and well cared for and looks    
{after its beer properly! Neither      
{existing pub fulfils all these        
{criteria." }                          
                                       </content>
