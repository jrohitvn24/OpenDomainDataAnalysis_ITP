		<title>08A Health Visitor,Pin Green.</title>
		<content> People can only become health visitors
 after they are experienced nurses.To  
 become a nurse you need at least 5"O" 
 levels,and some "A"levels for a 3 year
 course.After a person has been an     
 S.R.N.(State Registered Nurse)for a   
 few years,they can take extra courses 
 like Obstetrics (looking after mothers
 and babies) or midwifery (delivering  
 babies)and then take the postgraduate 
 course to become a health visitor.This
 lasts for one year and includes topics
 such as psychology and sociology.     
   Mrs.Staines,who works in St.Nicholas
 Health Centre,has been doing this job 
 for 3 years in Stevenage. She is part 
 of the{Primary Health Care Team}and   
 works alongside G.P.s,District Nurses 
 and Social Workers.She enjoys it very 
 much because she likes meeting people 
 of all ages,it uses all aspects of her
 brain and she is always learning.     </content>
