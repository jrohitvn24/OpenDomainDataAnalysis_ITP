		<content> Langtoft Church is called{St.Peter's, 
 Langtoft and is a Church of England   
 church.It stands on a high part of the
 village and overlooks most of the     
 houses.It contains a{Saxon Font}that  
 was brought from Cottam church,which  
 is now disused and is due for         
 demolition in the near future.The     
 present Vicar is Rev. Colin Lenton who
 was appointed in 1985.The Vicarage is 
 now a modern house on Scarborough Road
 but until 1984 it was a Victorian     
 house which is close to the church.   
 The church was greatly restored at the
 turn of the century at the expense of 
 Sir Tatton Sykes.Much of the intricate
 woodwork dates from that time.        
 In the square shaped tower are the    
{church bells.}There are two bells;one 
 dates from{1620}and the other from    
{1953.}The church and the cemetery are 
 surrounded by a shelter belt of trees.</content>
