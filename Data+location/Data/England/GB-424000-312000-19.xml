		<title>19Grangewood garden centre</title>
		<content>   The garden centre at Grangewood near
 Lullington is a recent addition to the
 services provided in the area. It is  
 situated on rented land adjacent to   
 Grangewood Hall &amp; is managed by one   
 man. He employs one man full-time &amp;   
 another participating in a YTS. Daily 
 opening times are between 9:30 am &amp;   
 5:00 pm.                              
   Despite its relatively remote{      
 position it attracts customers from   
 several kms around eg. Burton,        
 Swadlincote, Lichfield &amp; Tamworth.    
 Several people visiting the centre at 
 the time of our survey said that they 
 had, "come out for a drive".          
   The majority of plants are brought  
 from wholesalers. A huge variety of   
 garden &amp; house plants are displayed   
 both under glass &amp; in plots outside. A
 limited selection of garden furniture 
 is also available.                    </content>
