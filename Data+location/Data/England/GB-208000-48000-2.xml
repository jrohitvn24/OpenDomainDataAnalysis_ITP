		<content>   The whole area is very scenic giving
 excellent views of Fowey,Polruan and  
 St Austell Bay.The only sandy beach is
 Polridmouth which is accessible only  
 on foot or by boat.The walks are well 
 maintained and easy to follow with car
 parking at Menabilly Barton or the    
 National Trust one beside Combe Farm. 
  There are a few camping sites near by
 such as that at Penhale Farm.         
  The Cornwall South Coast Path takes  
 you all the way round the area and is 
 well worth the walk.
