		<title>13FARMING AND EMPLOYMENT.</title>
		<content>   A major{source of employment}in this
 semi_rural Survey area are the Farms. 
 The other major source of employment  
 exists in the service sector: shops,  
 banks, pubs and in recreation: livery 
 stables and groundsmen. Industry is   
 confined to the sewage works and a few
 small businesses, one of note makes   
 paper goods. Approximately fifty per  
 cent of the are is given over to      
 farmland which survives despite       
 pressure from housing, recreation and,
 of course, the{motorway.}The farms,   
 big and small, are mainly arable as   
 very few herds of livestock were seen.
 Fields were large yet hedges seem well
 preserved. The major, more mechanised 
 concerns are{Dairyhouse Farm}and      
{Houghgreen Farm.}There are many,      
 smaller, family holdings boasting     
 ducks, rabbits and goats. Of note is  
{Ashley Hall Farm}of Tatton Estates.   </content>
