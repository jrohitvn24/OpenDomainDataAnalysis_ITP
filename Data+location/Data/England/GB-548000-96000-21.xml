<title>21Seaford Schools</title>
<content>

I must correct this item.&lt;br />&lt;br />In 1959 there were around 40 schools in and around Seaford. Most were private and were for girls or boys of all ages (no mixed schools in those days). &lt;br />&lt;br />In fact the area was quite dependent on the income generated by the prescence of these schools and the 'visiting weekends' when parents were permitted to take out their offspring for the weekend - usually about 3 visits per term were permitted.&lt;br />&lt;br />Rivallry between schools in Seaford and other local towns, like Eastbourne, were legend.&lt;br />&lt;br />Seaford was renown for its private schools and the fact that it was a healthy place to live due to the fresh sea air.&lt;br />&lt;br />By 1986 many had been closed due to lack of demand and vast improvements in the state school system. Only one or 2 remain and are much smaller.   &lt;br />
