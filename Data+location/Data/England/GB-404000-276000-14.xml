		<title>14ECOLOGY IN KINGS NORTON</title>
		<content>On Monday Third {June 1985} we went to 
the Kings Norton canal for the Domesday
topic to see things about ecology and  
the landscape.The first thing we saw   
was a frog.It was dark green.On the    
trees there was a lot of blossom.There 
was also a lot of rubbish like sweet   
papers and big black bags.We saw a     
lot of plant life too.We saw an old    
mooring lock where the old barges used 
to go before it got knocked down beca- 
use of {vandalism}.The fish lived in   
polluted water and as mentioned there  
was loads of litter.The banks were     
mostly washed away and old moorings    
were standing in the canal.The name of 
some of the boats on the canal were    
Norman,Shark,Rellever,Kerie.Calipso    
3 and Cover,Heath.There is a compound  
for Patrick Motors cars.There was also 
plants growing in a brick wall.
