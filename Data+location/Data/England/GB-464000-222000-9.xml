		<content> What a different place it is now,in   
 the middle of{July.}The sun is shining
 ,the farmers are very busy and we have
 met lots of people. The children have 
 far more people to play with  than    
 when we lived in Cheltenham.          
 I have joined the local cricket team. 
 One of the great things we have had   
 was{Marsh Gibbon Club}feast day when  
 it seemed that all the village turned 
 out and there was a fair in the       
 afternoon.                            
 When we lived on the edge of a large  
 town we had next door neighbours and  
 we miss saying hello to them. Here we 
 do not have any neighbours because the
 school is right next door.            
 Both town and country have different  
 things to offer.
