 The second oldest building is the     
 library (l669).  A man called Charles 
 Read built three schools.  The first  
 head teacher was Mr. Charlesworth, the
 vicar.  But it was only for boys      
 because they thought that girls were  
 thick{BUT WE'RE NOT.}The School was   
 closed down in l9l5.  After that it   
 became a clinic. Between l95O - 58 it 
 was used by the Tuxford Primary for a 
 extra classroom.
