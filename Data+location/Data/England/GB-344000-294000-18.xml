		<title>18CHURCH STRETTON SCHOOLS</title>
		<content>   There are two schools in Church     
 Sretton, one primary,{St. Lawrence's  
 and one comprehensive,{Church Stretton
{School.                               
   When children are five they start   
 at the bottom of the primary school.  
 There are eight classes, about 230    
 children and ten teachers in this     
 school. Children leave this  school at
 the age of 11 and move into the       
 comprehensive until they are 16.      
   The comprehensive school has a head 
 mistress and the primary has a head   
 master. The comprehensive has about   
 600 pupils and 35 teachers. So you can
 imagine how big it is.                
   The schools are right next door to  
 each other and share a playing field  
 and swimming pool.                    
   The schools are beautifully         
 situated and are overlooked by the    
 Church Stretton hills.                </content>
