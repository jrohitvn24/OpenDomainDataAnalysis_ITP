		<content>  Prior to entry to the village school 
 many children attend the local play-  
 group which is held on three mornings 
 each week in the village hall. Some   
 children attend nursery schools in    
 Hitchin.                              
   After the age of eleven the children
 leave the village school to attend    
 secondary schools in Hitchin. There   
 are a few children who do not attend  
 the local schools.                    
   There are a number of children from 
 the village who are at colleges of    
 further education.                    
   Offley Place, once the home of the  
 Salusbury family, is now owned by     
 Hertfordshire County Council. Earlier 
 this century it was a teacher training
 college but now is a residential      
 centre for in-service education in the
 county. Due to financial constraints  
 its use is curtailed at present.      </content>
