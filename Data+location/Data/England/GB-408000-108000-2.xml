		<content> The{Parish Council}started in the late
 19th century. There is an election    
 every 4 years. If 12 people apply,    
 they are automatically elected, but if
 there are more, then an election takes
 place. The chairman is elected        
 annually by council members. If a     
 councillor doesn't attend for 6 months
 without good reason, he loses his     
 office. If a councillor moves away    
 there is a vacancy so a notice is put 
 on the Parish Council board, people   
 apply and the Parish Council vote for 
 who they think would do a good job.   
 The Parish Council is responsible for 
 the provision and maintenance of the  
 Parish Cemetery and Recreation Ground 
 and have representatives on other     
 village committees. Any member of the 
 public can go to any Parish Council   
 meeting where they can ask questions  
 during question time.                 </content>
