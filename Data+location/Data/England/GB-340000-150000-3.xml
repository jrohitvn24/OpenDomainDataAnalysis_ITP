		<title>03A woman's Morning</title>
		<content> I wake up at 6:30 a.m.and go down     
 stairs to make breakfast for my       
 daughter Jackie and myself.We usually 
 have cereal and toast for our first   
 meal of the day.I get the car out of  
 the garage and take Jackie into       
 Axbridge where she gets a lift to     
 Taunton.Jackie is training to be a    
 Nursery Nurse at  college in          
 Taunton.When I return home I wash the 
 dishes,tidy up the house,and water all
 the plants.I give my dog Pepi some    
 food and lock up the house            
 carefully.At 8:40 a.m.I drive 5 miles 
 to work at Weare School.I arrive at   
 9:00 a.m.and quickly start to get     
 ready for the day ahead.There are 9   
 children in the unit where I          
 work.They have difficulty in hearing  
 and come from a long way to have help 
 with their problem.I check that each  
 child's hearing aid is working.       </content>
