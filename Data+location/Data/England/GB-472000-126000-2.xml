 are woodland.They own a  total of 102 
 cows of which 52 are milkers and 50   
 heifers.Each dairy gives 3800 litres  
 of milk per year.They sell milk to the
 public for 22p per. pt and 18.341p to 
 the milk board.They also own 50-60    
 pigs.The cows are going to be sold for
 slaughter because the E.E.C.will not  
 pay extra money for extra milk.The    
 cows are producing too much milk and  
 farmers are losing money.They own a   
 combine harvester, four tractors,four 
 trailers ,1 reversable plough,a       
 combine drill,2 different harrows,1   
 grass topper and a dung spreader.Also 
 at the farm are a couple of grain     
 bins.
