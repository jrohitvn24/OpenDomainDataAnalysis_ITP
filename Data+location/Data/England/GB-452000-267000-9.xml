		<content>The housing in our D-block is varied   
ranging from three hundred year old    
stone farmhouses to the latest in      
design and construction techniques.    
Daventry Road, Barby, presents an      
interesting picture. Brick terraced    
council built homes occupy one side    
while privately owned bungalows occupy 
the other. In recent years it has been 
the policy of the Conservative Gov-    
ernment to sell off council houses.    
This has meant that a number of        
council houses are now privately owned.
A recent national survey has           
found that because of high levels of   
unemployment a growing number of new   
owner occupiers cannot meet the high   
cost of repairs. The survey reports    
that one house in five is in need of   
major repairs.  To make matters worse  
home improvement grants have been      
drastically cut.                       </content>
