		<content>   We have about three or four meals a 
 day. We have breakfast, dinner, tea   
 and sometimes supper.   For breakfast 
 we have toast, which is bread grilled.
 We have that about 8 a.m..  The       
 traditional English breakfast is bacon
 and eggs. For lunch (or dinner) on a  
 weekday we take sandwiches to school. 
 Sandwiches are pieces of bread with a 
 filling of perhaps meat or egg.   At  
 weekends we might have a cooked dinner
 of beef or pork, peas, potatoes,      
 Yorkshire pudding and gravy.  Some    
 days we have fish and chips.  You make
 chips like this:  you have potatoes,  
 peel all the skin off, cut them into  
 strips, put them into  deep frier,    
 wait till they are brown and then take
 them out and eat them.  For tea we    
 might have ham or another meat,       
 lettuce and tomatoes.   To drink we   
 have tea, coffee or squash.           </content>
