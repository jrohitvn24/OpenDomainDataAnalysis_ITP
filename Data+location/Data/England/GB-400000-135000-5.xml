		<content> There is a main road going through the
 Wylye Valley, it is the A36 which     
 goes from Southampton to Bristol and  
 they are both busy ports.The road goes
 through Steeple Langford.In half an   
 hour 27 vans, 74 lorries, 1 motor bike
 and 225  cars went through the        
 village.  The village of Wylye was    
 on the A303 but was bypassed in       
 1975.Now there is not so much noise   
 and dirt. A shop , a pub and a garage 
 had to close down.In the same half an 
 hour in Wylye we counted 0 motorbikes 
 31 cars 9 vans and 8 lorries passing  
 through Wylye Village.                
 We hope Steeple Langford will be      
 bypassed by 1990. {
