		<title>11EARDINGTON MANOR GROUNDS</title>
		<content>  The{10}surrounding{acres}of ground   
 are divided into 4 different sections.
 The 1st and biggest is the main garden
 and contains a variety of flowers and 
 plants.Adjacent to this is a newly    
 built swimming-pool complete with its 
 own heating system and springboard.   
  The next largest area is used as a   
 vegetable plot for growing fruit and  
 vegetables.A gardener comes twice a   
 week to ensure that the gardens are   
 kept looking their best.On the other  
 side of the house are a number of     
 stables which are now used as store   
 rooms.It is still possible to see the 
 original timbers and bridle hooks.    
  As well as the main garden there are 
{several smaller gardens}around the    
 house.We thought the gardens were well
 kept and made the house look very     
 picturesque.
