		<title>15LEISURE IN SWINDON</title>
		<content> There are two major leisure           
 centres in Swindon: the{Oasis}and the 
{Link.}The Oasis, situated near central
 Swindon, was opened in 1976. The Link 
 Centre is in Western Swindon and was  
 opened in 1985; its opening was one of
 this year's major local events. The   
 facilities provided at the two leisure
 centres were decided upon only after  
 careful market research; e.g. only two
 squash courts were built at the Link  
 Centre because it was thought that the
 sport is slowly losing popularity.    
 Although both centres have many       
 similar facilities the Link includes  
 an{ice rink}(which it is hoped will   
 attract people from a 60 mile radius) 
 and a rock climbing and traversing    
 wall. The swimming pool at the Oasis  
 is for leisure only whilst the pool at
 the Link can be used for competitive  
 swimming. The Link also has a library.</content>
