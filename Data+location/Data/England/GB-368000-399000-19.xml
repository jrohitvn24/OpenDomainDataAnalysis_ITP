		<title>19BRIDGEWATER CANAL</title>
		<content>  THE{BRIDGEWATER CANAL}WAS COMPLETED  
 IN{1761.}IT RUNS EAST-WEST ACROSS THE 
 STUDY AREA. ORIGINALLY IT WAS USED TO 
 TRANSPORT COAL FROM THE LOCAL         
{COLLIERIES}TO THE{INDUSTRIAL CENTRES, 
 LIKE{MANCHESTER.}NOW MOST OF THE      
 COLLIERIES ARE CLOSED AND THE CANAL IS
 MAINLY USED FOR{PLEASURE BOATING.     
 THERE IS STILL EVIDENCE OF COAL HAVING
 BEEN TIPPED INTO THE BARGES, AND IN   
 PARTS THE CANAL IS MUCH WIDER TO ALLOW
 FOR THE TURNING OF THESE BOATS.       
  IN PLACES{REPAIR WORK}HAS HAD TO BE  
 UNDERTAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE{CANAL BANK.
 IN SOME PLACES THERE ARE{NEW SIDE     
{BANKINGS}AND{NUMEROUS SAPLINGS}OF     
 DIFFERENT SPECIES HAVE BEEN PLANTED.  
 THERE ARE ALSO{PICNIC TABLES,}LITTER  
 BINS AND A{NEW PATH}MADE OUT OF       
 GRAVEL.
