		<content>   Two main roads run through the area,
 the A666 from Bolton to Blackburn, and
 the A675 from Bolton to Preston.      
 Minor roads to the north of Egerton   
 connect the two, and roads to the     
 south of Egerton provide links with   
 Bromley Cross, Eagley and Harwood, and
 the railway station. The A666 is very 
 busy, and the 40mph speed limit in    
 Egerton causes much concern. Regular  
 bus services run to Bolton, but only  
 13% use it regularly, 62% very rarely.
 Most people travel by car, with 90%   
 of homes having use of a car, 43% more
 than one.                             
   Children travelling to secondary    
 schools are principal users of public 
 transport
