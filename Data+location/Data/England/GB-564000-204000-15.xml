		<title>15WRITTLE,PERSONAL EXPERIENCES</title>
		<content> I like Writtle because it is much     
 quieter and the atmosphere is         
 friendlier than a town. If I am bored 
 I just have a walk along the river    
 bank.The only thing I do not lik is   
 the fact that I live on a main road   
        We have got a lot of fields in 
 Writtle and there is a lot of wildlife
 in and around the village.            
        I like the fact that Writtle   
 has got a duck pond with lots of ducks
 on it. Some of these ducks are        
 mallards, moorhens, coots, barnacle   
 geese,swans and Canadian geese.
