		<title>07MORNING AT L.CROSBY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   I get up, wash and get ready for    
 school. Mum does my hair! Then I go   
 for the{school bus}which leaves       
{Hightown}at 8.30a.m.                  
   On the bus, I meet Margaret who is  
 our{bus supervisor.}When we get off,  
 we play for a quarter of an hour in   
 the playground.                       
   At 9.00a.m. we can come into school 
 and do{English}or{Mathematics.}Mrs    
 Barnes the Headteacher and Mrs Tumilty
 teach us. This is called              
{'Team-teaching'.                      
   Then at 10.30a.m. we go out to play.
 We have our{breaks}(e.g. biscuit) and 
 play games.                           
   At 11.00a.m. we come back into      
 school and do more work - perhaps     
{History}until 11.50a.m. which is      
 lunchtime.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
