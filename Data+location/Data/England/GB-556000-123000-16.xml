		<content> MOST PEOPLE CHOOSE TO LIVE HERE       
 BECAUSE OF THE OPEN FIELDS AND THE    
 BEAUTIFUL VIEWS. IT IS CONVENIENT FOR 
 PEOPLE WHO WORK IN LONDON AND WANT TO 
 COME HOME IN THE EVENING TO THE PEACE 
 AND QUIET OF THE COUNTRYSIDE. THE     
 FRIENDLINESS AND COMMUNITY SPIRIT     
 WHICH MANIFEST THEMSELVES THROUGH     
 ACTIVITIES ORGANISED BY VARIOUS GROUPS
 OR SOCIETIES MAKE THIS AN ENJOYABLE   
 PLACE TO LIVE IN.IT IS NEAR THE COAST 
 WHICH IS CONVENIENT FOR LEISURE AND   
 TRAVEL ABROAD VIA THE CHANNEL PORTS.  
 THE POPULATION IS ALMOST EQUALLY      
 DIVIDED BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO MOVED INTO 
 THE AREA IN THE LAST 10 YEARS AND     
 OTHERS WHO SETTLED HERE IN THE FIFTIES
 AND SIXTIES. PARENTS PLUS ONE OR TWO  
 CHILDREN MAKE UP AN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD.
 GIVEN A CHOICE, 90% OF THOSE ASKED    
 WOULD STAY IN THE AREA RATHER THAN    
 MOVE ELSEWHERE.                       </content>
