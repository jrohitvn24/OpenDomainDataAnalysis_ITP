		<title>13HOUSING.</title>
		<content>   Housing is mainly privately owned   
 but there used to be six council      
 houses,most of them have now been sold
 There are roughly seventy houses in   
 Mathon rural area and about 350 people
 altogether.Many people are retired and
 some commute to work elsewhere.Many   
 houses are quite large farmsteads.    
   Being a widespread rural area,crime 
 is very unlikely and the only         
 policeman in the area lives in Cradley
 and looks after Mathons interests.    
   When we went round Mathon we saw    
 lots of old barns and some lovely     
 black and white houses.All these      
 houses are in a lovely area which     
 makes them very desireable.There are  
 some modern estate houses as well but 
 they are not so pretty.
