		<title>07Tourism &amp; hotels, Freshfield</title>
		<content> Visitors to the area are mainly day   
 trippers from Liverpool travelling by 
 train to Freshfield. Then they walk to
 the beach past the{National Trust}or  
 the{Nature Conservancy}reserves. In   
 the summer and on Sundays the squirrel
 reserve has thousands of visitors.    
 Vandals sometimes climb over fences,  
 pull up trees, signs and fences and   
 make fires with them. A few people    
 ride motorbikes over the dunes. In    
 general, however, the wardens are     
 pleased to have visitors.             
 Meals are served at the Grapes Hotel  
 in the evening and at dinnertime. Many
 golfers eat there in the summer as it 
 is the nearest restaurant to the golf 
 courses. The Treetops Hotel is        
 busiest on weekday evenings because   
 most of the guests are business       
 people.
