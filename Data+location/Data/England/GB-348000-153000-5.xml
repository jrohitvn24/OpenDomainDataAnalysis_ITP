		<content> Mendip is an exposed area.There are   
 many problems facing the small        
 community who live on the plateau.    
 Without a car people find it very     
 difficult to reach amenities which    
 are several miles away.Isolation can  
 lead to loneliness as settlement is   
 widely dispersed.Public transport     
 services are few and expensive.       
 Farms suffer from frequent cloud,heavy
 rain and high winds.Thin soils and    
 lack of sunshine make it difficult to 
 grow crops in places.The limestone    
 can lead to water shortages in dry    
 summers.Many of these problems are    
 greatly increased in winter.The area  
 often has snow lying for several      
 weeks.Temperatures can be very low and
 roads blocked frequently.
