		<title>17A Day At A Secondary School</title>
		<content>   It was a Tuesday. I had finished my 
 science and maths homework. The usual 
 day with maths, French, English,      
 library lesson, French again, then    
 lunch hour, back to lessons history,  
 all about Middle Ages and then needle 
 work, and yes boys do attend this     
 lesson. Then homework, English and    
 French. There are over 1,000 pupils at
 Owens and about 300 acres of ground,  
 tennis courts, lake, woods, greens and
 fields. The day starts 9.05 in the    
 morning and goes on to 3.40 p.m.      
 There are many clubs in the school    
 e.g. history club, orchestra, choir,  
 model railway and angling club. There 
 are three assemblies in a week and two
 form periods for the first year.      
 The first years have lockers and the  
 other years have cupboards.
