This area is administered by the East  
Hertfordshire District Council and is  
in the parliamentary constituency of   
Hertford and Stevenage.                
                                       
This is an agricultural area with some 
light industry. The A10 runs through   
the SE corner and two villages have    
developed along this route. Someone    
passing through might mistakenly think 
there was just one community but the   
River Rib divides Wadesmill to the     
North from Thundridge to the South.    
There are now new housing developments 
adding to the vitality of the villages.
                                       
The smaller settlements of Chapmore End
Westmill and Tonwell nestle in the     
gently rolling countryside. The area   
has many footpaths and on one walk an  
old derelict house and garden was found</content>
