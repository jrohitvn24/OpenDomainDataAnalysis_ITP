		<title>20Industry in Chorley</title>
		<content> In Chorley engineering is mainly      
light. There are a few furniture makers
such as Dickinsons. There are also some
mills,for example The Talbot which is  
situated at the bottom of Baggenly     
Lane. There are also little industries 
which make  such things as keys and    
locks.A large new employer is the      
brewery on the south east of the town  
and built virtually on the banks of the
Leeds Liverpool canal.                 
                                       
The entries for Chorley were compiled  
by Mr.W.Sloan the Deputy Headteacher   
of St.Peter's school Chorley from      
information collected by pupils from   
St.Peter's school,St.Jame's school and 
St.Lawrence's school all in Chorley.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
