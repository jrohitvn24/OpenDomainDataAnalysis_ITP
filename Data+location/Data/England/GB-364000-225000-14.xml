    Living in a rural area we are lucky
  to see a policeman once a month!     
    But unlike towns and cities we see 
 very few crimes,although there are    
 quite a few road accidents due to     
 narrow roads,bad bends and crossroads.
    Our block comes under the beat of  
 P.C. Baldwin who is stationed at      
 Weston-Under-Penyard.He works for the 
 West Mercia Constabulary which covers 
 Herefordshire,Worcestershire and      
 Shropshire;his headquarters being in  
 Worcester.                            
    He patrols his beat in Fiesta car  
 which is unaltered apart from a blue  
 light and{POLICE STOP}signs.          
    The nearest court is at Ross.There 
 are a few minor offences,but there are
 few serious crimes
