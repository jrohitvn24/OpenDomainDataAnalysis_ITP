		<title>13LEOMINSTER FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content> The daily routine begins with the     
 feeding of calves, reared initially on
 powdered milk. The milk taken from the
 cows is stored in a refrigerated tank 
 to await daily collection by a bulk   
 tanker.                               
 The potato crop may develop diseases  
 and spraying by aeroplane or tractor  
 is necessary. Corn crops are also     
 sprayed to prevent weeds and diseases.
 Some grass is being cut and dried for 
 hay, but more is cut and compressed   
 into silage as a supply of winter     
 food.                                 
 Many processes on the farm are now    
 mechanised, making reductions in      
 manual labour and fewer workers being 
 required. The price of produce such as
 beef, lamb, pork, eggs, fruit and     
 potatoes is affected by European      
 Economic Community policies.
