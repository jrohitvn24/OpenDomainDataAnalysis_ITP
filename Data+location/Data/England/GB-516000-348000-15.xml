		<title>15Industry In South Kyme</title>
		<content>  As this is almost entirely a farming 
 area, there is little industry.       
  The main business in the village is  
 an Agricultural Engineers, run by the 
 4th. generation of one family.        
  Originally this was a blacksmiths    
 business, chiefly working in farriery 
 and repairing horse ploughs, harrows, 
 corn binders and hand tools. Now the  
 type of work has changed to making,   
 repairing and supplying spare parts to
 large modern machines. These include  
 hydraulic harrows, drags, potato and  
 beet harvesters, and combines.        
  Some work is still carried out on the
 original forge and anvils, but modern 
 methods of electric and oxy-acetylene 
 welding, and power driven grinders,   
 cutters, and drop hammer are now used.
  Other industry:a firm specializing in
 designing/making precision machinery, 
 and a building/joinery firm.          </content>
