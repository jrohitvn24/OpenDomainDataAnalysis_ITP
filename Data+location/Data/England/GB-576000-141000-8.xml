		<title>08The King's Head Ghost.</title>
		<content>   On the hill opposite the church     
 stands the King's Head public house   
 which it is thought stands on part of 
 the 14th century churchyard. Forming  
 part of one wall of the pub are two   
 ancient grave stones.A number of years
 ago one of the gravestones was moved  
 and that started the haunting. Moans  
 and footsteps were heard in the main  
 bar and weird noises came from one of 
 the guest rooms upstairs which neither
 the landlord's cat nor dog would go   
 into. The gravesstone was eventully   
 replaced in its original position but 
 the ghostly phenomenon still continues
   There is said to be another ghost in
 the area which haunts Loddenden Manor 
 by the old school.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
