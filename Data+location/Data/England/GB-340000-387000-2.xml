		<title>02SHOPPING IN BELLE VALE</title>
		<content>  The main shops for the Belle Vale    
 area are situated in the Belle Vale   
 shopping precinct.The types of shops  
 include,a cobblers,a music shop and a 
 decorating shop.There are too many    
 food shops &amp; not enough shops selling 
 toys &amp; books.The only newsagent in the
 precinct has recently been closed     
 down. There are two supermarkets      
{(WOOLWORTH &amp; TESCOS)}which people find
 convenient as they can get everything 
 at once, but there are usually long   
 queues.Though the precinct caters for 
 nearly every necessity ,&amp; is very busy
 at the weekend,there is no bank or    
 post office.Consequently the building 
 society branch in the precinct is well
 used.The nearest bank is situated in  
 the Gateacre Park block of shops which
 is the other main place to shop.The   
 Gateacre shops aren't as big as the   
 ones in the precinct but are as good. </content>
