		<title>17OUR LOCAL POLICEMAN</title>
		<content>   P.C. Johnson is our local policeman.
 He came to school to talk about his   
 job. This is what P.C. Johnson's day  
 is like. He does a day shift. He      
 starts at 8am. He spends half an hour 
 looking at his paperwork and dealing  
 with enquires. At 8:30 he goes to     
 peoples' houses and follows up the    
 enquires. The type of laws broken in  
 the Shardlow area are things like     
 speeding or a broken window or parking
 on double yellow lines or in front of 
 peoples' drives. There are sometimes  
 break-ins on the boats in the marina. 
 When there are no things to do he just
 rides around on his bike and keeps a  
 check on the area. He ends his day at 
 4pm. The type of crimes we get are    
 very different from the crimes in a   
 city. In a city there are more violent
 crimes and theft.
