		<title>07Richmond's nature reserve</title>
		<content> The  reserve  is  largely 2 to 8m deep
 around the edges of the school        
 grounds. We started our reserve in    
 1980. With cash raised through raffle 
 ticket sales we bought over 600       
 "Whips" (very small trees).These were 
 planted in carefully planned areas by 
 the children.The area was surrounded  
 by small wooden stakes connected with 
 string.The area  was then left to     
 itself. The reserve has been greatly  
 extended since its initial planting.  
 Several wild flower gardens have been 
 created and a pond  which supports a  
 substantial frog and newt population.A
 large part of the reserve is enclosed 
 by turf barrows which landscape and   
 protect the area. Already,weasels,    
 hedgehogs,kestrel,owls and grass      
 snakes have been seen.We hope that    
 the site is protected in the long term
 and will continue to thrive.          </content>
