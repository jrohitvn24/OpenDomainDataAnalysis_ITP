		<title>10RACING STABLES.</title>
		<content>    Horse racing was established here  
 long ago and there are several stables
 in the area.The old{MALTON RACE TRACK 
 was only closed about 1850 when it was
 sold off for farming and planted with 
 trees.All the stables share the use   
 and upkeep of the Training "Gallops"  
 on Langton Wold.{KENNYTHORPE STABLES,}
 with its Colts,Fillies and Geldings,is
 in our area.It is mainly for "jumpers"
 which race over fences,although there 
 are some "sprinters" here.The "Flat"  
 season is their quiet time,so only 30 
 of their 41 boxes are occupied.       
{   Thoroughbred Yearlings,}bought in  
 September,are broken-in and trained to
 start their racing after 6 weeks.Most 
 stay with the stable all their career 
 and may even race in Europe.The best  
 may go to "Stud",later,and the rest   
 retire or carry on racing in countries
 where the standards are lower.        </content>
