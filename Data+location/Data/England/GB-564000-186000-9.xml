		<title>09GRAFFITI IN THE LAINDON AREA</title>
		<content> The walls of{Laindon and Basildon}have
 recently been "decorated" by{graffiti 
 gangs. Young people aged between 13 to
 20 have been using the subway walls   
 for their{"burners."}A burner is a    
 graffiti competition. The graffiti    
 artists say they want to brighten up  
 the area and some of their work dows  
 look attractive.                      
 However many members of the public    
 think the walls should be left        
 whitewashed. They say the graffiti is 
 an eyesore. Some children in our      
 school think that the graffiti is so  
 artistic that it should be allowed to 
 remain. It is a change from all the   
 dirty things that usually get written 
 on walls. Others think that there     
 should be special places for graffiti 
 writing and drawings.
