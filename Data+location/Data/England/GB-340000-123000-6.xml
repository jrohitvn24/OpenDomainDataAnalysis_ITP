		<title>06A Day In The Life Of My Dad</title>
		<content> My Dad gets up at 6am.He does his     
 household chores,washes his           
 overalls and then sweeps out the      
 storeroom.At 7am he does some         
 gardening;sowing vegetable            
 seeds,weeding,watering plants and     
 harvesting the crops.In the Summer he 
 is very busy picking peas and runner  
 beans.About 500 pea plants and about  
 80 bean plants are grown each year.He 
 then walks 2 miles to the farm where  
 he works.When he gets there he        
 prepares the tractors to take feed out
 to the 500 cattle and calves.         
 it takes two hours to feed them their 
 silage and rolled barley.During the   
 next four hours he cleans out the     
 cubicles and beds them with straw.Dad 
 then does maintenance jobs around the 
 farm and feeds the cattle  before     
 walking home for his evening meal.
