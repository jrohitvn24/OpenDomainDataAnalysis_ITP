		<title>19CHILD'S VIEW OF THORPE END</title>
		<content> As{children}living in Thorpe End we   
 think it is pretty boring, there are  
 not many activities in our village. At
 the moment the builders are going to  
 make a{recreation ground}with a       
 football pitch and tennis courts, but 
 that could take another couple of     
 years. The only place we have to play 
 is on the green but that is mainly    
 private property. The only{shops}in   
 our village are the post office, hair 
 dressers and garage. There is a church
 hall and a bus shelter. Thorpe End won
 the best kept village contest in 1978.
 Thorpe End is just outside the city of
{Norwich,}it is situated in the country
 and is quiet and quaint. The houses   
 are old and most of them have thatched
 roofs.Now the builders are making     
 modernised houses, which most people  
 don't think are as nice.
