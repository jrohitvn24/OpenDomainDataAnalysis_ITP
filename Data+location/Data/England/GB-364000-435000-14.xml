		<title>14Churches in Ribchester</title>
		<content>We have 5 churches in the Ribchester   
area,2 Catholic churches,2 Anglican    
churches and 1 Evangelical Protestant  
church. The Parish church was mainly   
built in the 13th Century but other    
parts were built later on. The other   
Parish church STYDD was probably built 
in the 11th century. STYDD church has  
been altered many times. The earliest  
part of the building is in the North   
wall. It is a good example of Norman   
work. Our Lady of the Way Side is a    
Catholic chapel. It must be very old   
because it has an old toilet that is   
just a hole. It has no priest of its   
own. The Evangelical Protestant church 
is 91 years old. The pulpit is older   
than the church because it came from   
another church.They do not have the    
pulpit at the side, instead they have  
it in the middle.
