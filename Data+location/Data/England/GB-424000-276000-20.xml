		<content> Leigh Church of England Primary School
 is a small church school which serves 
 the parishes of four different        
 churches. These churches are St.      
 James, Tile Hill-St. John the Baptist,
 Westwood-St. Oswalds, Tile Hill and   
 St. Stephens, Canley. There are 231   
 pupils in our school which are divided
 into 3 infant classes and 4 junior    
 classes. Throughout the week our      
 lessons cover all the different       
 subjects taught in a primary school   
 and after school we are able to attend
 various clubs such as dancing,        
 gymnastics, padder tennis, archery and
 table tennis as well as football and  
 netball practises for the school      
 teams. Credit should be given to the  
 junior pupils of Leigh Church of      
 England School for all the work they  
 have done in compiling the information
 for the B.B.C. Domesday Project.      </content>
