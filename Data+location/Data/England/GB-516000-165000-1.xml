		<title>01Living in Tolworth.</title>
		<content> My home area is quite near the bypass 
 and the Hogsmill runs through it.     
 I live in Tolworth, its main buildings
 are Tolworth Tower and Charrington    
 Bowl. The Bowling alley brings alot   
 of people to Tolworth, as it is one   
 of the largest in Europe. It is, also,
 near to Chessington with it's famous  
 zoo. Tolworth itself is quite quiet,  
 despite the traffic going through the 
 bypass from and to London. Tolworth   
 Broadway is the popular place for     
 shopping. The tall Tolworth Tower     
 stands out as the landmark here. The  
 bypass separates one half of Tolworth 
 from the other. Our school is on the  
 north side and is larger. I live on   
 the south side. Bus services to       
 Kingston, where there are big shops,  
 are very frequent. There is,also, a   
 railway service to London.
