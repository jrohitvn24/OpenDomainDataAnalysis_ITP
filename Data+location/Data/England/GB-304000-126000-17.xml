		<title>17LIFE ON A CHIPSTABLE FARM</title>
		<content> I am Rachel, I live at Marshes        
 Farm, Chipstable, and I am 11 years   
 old. I am going to tell you about a   
 normal day in my life.                
                                       
 In the morning, I get up  at 7.30am on
 a school morning. I get ready, and    
 then  catch the coach at the bottom of
 the farm lane at about 8.30am. I come 
 home at about 4.00pm, get changed, and
 have something to eat.                
                                       
 Then I go outside and take my pony for
 a ride along the country lanes. I     
 usually ride for about three quarters 
 of an hour. Then I groom the pony, and
 my first pony, and muck them both out.
 Then I put them in the field for the  
 night. If there has not been any rain,
 I water my garden and then take Zola, 
 my dog, for a walk.                   
                                       </content>
