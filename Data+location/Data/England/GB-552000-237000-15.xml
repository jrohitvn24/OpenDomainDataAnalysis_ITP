		<title>15Changes in Saffron Walden</title>

 Twenty years ago the population was   
 less than 10,000. Today it is about   
 18,000. Most of the new people live on
 the Fairview Estate to the south of   
 town and the Wimpey Estate to         
 the north-east. All these people have 
 brought about a traffic problem in    
 Saffron Walden where it is difficult  
 to park. The bus services are not very
 frequent so those without cars are    
 handicapped because most people in    
 this sort of well off town are assumed
 to have cars. Not many of the         
 newcomers work in the area so this is 
 changing the character of the town.
