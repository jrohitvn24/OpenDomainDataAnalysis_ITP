      There is a high incidence of     
 "weekend cottages" in and around Hethe
 where, too, American families from the
 base at Upper Heyford have sought the 
 quietness of this village in which to 
 live. Some locals say they are not    
 easily assimilated and are apart from,
 rather than a part of, the local      
 community.  Certainly, the village    
 pubs are centres of music cults owing 
 more to the American way of life than 
 the traditional folk and jazz.  Young 
 "first-time buyer" village couples    
 are, as in other areas, victims of    
 escalating house costs pricing them   
 right out of their home area where    
 family roots are strong.
