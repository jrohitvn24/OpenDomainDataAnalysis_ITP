		<title>20HOME COMPUTERS IN LEOMINSTER</title>
		<content> A survey made during the Summer Term  
 1985 produced the following results - 
 Acorn Electron - 15  Vic 20    - 14   
 B.B.C.'B'      - 13  Dragon 32 -  7   
 Commodre 16/64 - 37  Oric      -  5   
 Sinclair comp. - 45  Einstein  -  1   
 SHARP          -  5 MSX       -   1   
 436 children in{Leominster}Junior     
 School were questioned - 143 had      
 computers and 293 were without.       
 Therefore just over 32% had computers 
 for educational and games use. These  
 computers ranged in price from below  
 one hundred to nearly four hundred    
 pounds.                               
 The school has at present three       
 B.B.C.'B' computers - this being the  
 most popular make purchased by schools
 generally. The Dept. of Education and 
 Science gave schools a 50% grant to   
 buy their first computer-others were  
 bought by the Parent Teachers Assoc.  </content>
