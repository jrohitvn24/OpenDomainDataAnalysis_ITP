		<content>Being a country area with few houses,  
there has been no opportunity for any  
ethnic group to become established as  
is the case in nearby Lancaster, and   
consequently, there are just two places
of worship in the block. One Church of 
England church in Glasson Dock and one 
Roman Catholic church in Thurnham,close
to the Hall. Both are tiny village     
churches supporting small congregations
on Sundays, so there are basically two 
religions in the block - Protestant    
and Roman Catholic. A small private    
chapel is also to be found at Thurnham 
Hall. This is R.C.                     
The incumbent at Glasson is only part- 
time, sharing his duties with the      
Lancaster Royal Infirmary, where he is 
a chaplain.
