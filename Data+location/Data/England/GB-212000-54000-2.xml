		<title>02THE LERRYN AND FOWEY RIVERS</title>
		<content>      The beauty of the{Fowey}river and
 it's tributary the{Lerryn}attracts    
 people for varied reasons. Many to    
 "mess about in boats" others to watch 
 birds and wildlife, some to just relax
 and enjoy it's beauty.                
      The river inspires some people to
 try and capture it's beauty on paper  
 and canvas. It is said that{Kenneth   
{Grahame}wrote{"The Wind in the        
{Willows"}after a river trip to Lerryn 
 from Fowey.                           
     {Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch}wrote   
 many books set around the Fowey       
 river, in particular "Castle Dor",    
 started in the  1920's, but not       
 finished until 1962 by{Daphne du      
{Maurier,}another very famous writer   
 about Cornwall.                       
      Other writers who have written   
 about the area are{Denis Val-Baker    
 and{Leo Walmsley.                     </content>
