		<title>19 Newton Bromswold Village</title>
		<content>  The village only has 16 houses, a    
mixture of bungalows, cottages, farms, 
a Manor house and the church. We found 
there was a very friendly atmosphere.  
The villagers said that it was quiet,  
lovely and friendly, they preferred it 
to the busy towns.                     
  Most villagers shopped in Rushden or 
other nearby towns but there was no bus
so they relied upon cars. Sometimes    
they used the small shop/Post office at
the end of Avenue Road.                
  Most people worked in Rushden or the 
nearby farm. One person was unemployed.
  There was once a village school but  
this was closed over 20 years ago. The 
children are now Â£bused' and the school
has been demolished and built upon.    
  There are no mains gas or sewer, they
use either oil or coal. It costs 27    
pounds 50p to empty their cess pits.   
They don't have street lights either.  </content>
