		<title>12TATENHILL AIRFIELD</title>
		<content> Although called{Tatenhill Airfield,}it
 is not in the neighbouring village of 
 Tatenhill but{in Needwood.} It was an 
 active airbase during the 1939-40 war.
                                       
{Part}of it is still used as a{private 
{airfield}by a national brewery based  
 in Burton-on-Trent, and{Her Majesty   
{Queen Elizabeth II}left from it when  
 she visited the Duchy of Lancaster    
 estates in the early 1980s.           
                                       
 However{much}of it is{now derelict.   
 In one area{"banger" racing}takes     
 place at weekends; another area is    
 used by a local club to fly{model     
{aeroplanes;}and in another part{sheep 
{graze}on the now broken runways. The  
 buildings too are now derelict, used  
 only by the sheep to shelter from the 
 winter winds.
