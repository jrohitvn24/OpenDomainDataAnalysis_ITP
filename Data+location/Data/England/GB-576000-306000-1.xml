		<title>01Swaffham Heath, Norfolk</title>
		<content> An area of gently rolling forest and  
 farmland, between 65 and 15 metres    
 above sea level. Soil is light and    
 sandy, on chalk, with much flint. Rain
 drains quickly and this coupled with  
 persistent winds has meant that before
 modern fertilisers agricuture was     
 unrewarding. and led to nearly half   
 the landscape being planted with      
 conifers by the Forestry Commission.  
 Four small farms lie within the area, 
 and other dwellings, built for        
 Foresters lie along the one metalled  
 road running from Swaffham to         
 Beachmwell. The area has many tracks  
 and public rights of way, though some 
 plantations are closed because of     
 shooting rights. Besides pheasants and
 French partridge, wildlife includes   
 goldcrests, golden pheasants,         
 crossbills, nightjars, owls, roe deer,
 hares,rabbits, grey and red squirrels.</content>
