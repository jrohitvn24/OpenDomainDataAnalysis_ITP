		<title>08BARNS - HURSTBOURNE TARRANT</title>
		<content> There are some beautiful thatched {   
 barns in {Hurstbourne Tarrant}and{    
{Ibthorpe.}                            
 At Parsonage Farm next to the church, 
 there is a{Tudor granary}standing on  
 staddle stones. It is unusual because 
 it has a pigeon loft. There are also  
 two large barns with oak timbers on   
 which the following dates are carved:-
 1735, 1737, 1780, 1798, 1799. One is  
 an{aisle barn}with free standing oak  
 posts supporting the roof.            
 Barns were used as village meeting    
 places, and the aisle barn at{Ibthorpe
 Manor Farm is still used in this way. 
 Each summer a party of blind people   
 from{Andover}come to a concert in the{
 barn given by local schoolchildren. In
 September 1985 the village{Flower Show
 will also be held in this aisle barn  
 for the first time.
