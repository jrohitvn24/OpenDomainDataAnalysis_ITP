		<title>18HEALTH - Sister Dora Home.</title>
		<content>  The Sister Dora home is at Milford,  
just off the road to Brocton.They look 
after people who are old and often     
disabled.The nurses wear uniforms like 
a state hospital.There are 36 staff    
including domestic and non domestic.   
They look after about 31 people from   
the local area and from anywhere in the
country.They may stay for a short      
period to give relatives a break for   
two weeks to two months.Many are long  
stay patients and two have been there  
for 14 and 10 years.                   
 The place is named after Sister Dora  
who helped save many men in the Great  
War (1914-1918) at her hospital in     
Walsall.The building has also been used
for miners with bad lungs and by the   
Royal Wolverhampton Hospital as a      
convalescent home.
