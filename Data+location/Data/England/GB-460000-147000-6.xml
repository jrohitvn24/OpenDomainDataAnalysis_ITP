		<content>  The area is policed in two           
 ways. First, by police panda cars     
 patrolling the area. These operate    
 from police headquarters in           
 Basingstoke to the north of the M3 and
 from Preston Candover to the south.   
 Second, the area is policed to the    
 north by a {Community Policeman,}who  
 operates on foot or on a bicycle on a 
 regular beat for 8 hours per day, and 
 to the south by a{Rural Policeman.    
 Both the Community Policeman and the  
 Rural Policeman operate very much from
 home, where they may be involved in   
 paperwork for some 2 hours per        
 day. They are responsible for issuing 
 such items as shotgun and pedlars     
 licences. They both maintain regular  
 contacts with respective H.Q.
