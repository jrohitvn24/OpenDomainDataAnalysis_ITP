   None of the houses down Polesdon,   
 Papercourt or Tannery lanes are owned 
 by Papercourt farm. One house, lived  
 in by an old lady is owned by Lady    
 Lovelace and the lady pays rent to    
{Housesteads Farm.}Both the houses at{ 
{Blunt Cottage}are privately owned, one
 of them being unoccupied. Down        
 Polesdon Lane are a group of houses   
 with{S.C.C.1920}(Surrey County        
 Council) on their chimney breasts.    
 After the First World War they were   
 built for war heroes by S.C.C. when   
 Lloyd George said,"Every man shall    
 have a cow and an acre." The land was 
 bought by Hall Aggregates in 1926.    
 These houses are now privately owned. 
 The Severn Stars public house is      
 opposite the mobile home site and     
 serves lunch time snacks.
