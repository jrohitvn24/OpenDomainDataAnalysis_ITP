		<content>Of the working population,about 86% are
employed in the service sector,mostly  
in offices &amp; shops in Exeter.London &amp;  
Manchester Assurance,who moved its Head
Offices to Clyst St Mary (8 miles away)
some 10 years ago,is an important      
employer.                              
Commuting is encouraged by the presence
of the Railway Station on the Exmouth- 
Exeter branch line and by the A376     
which is direct,though very busy.      
Lympstone has the usual range of low   
order,or frequently needed services but
also a tea shop reflecting the         
influence of tourism.Several services  
have gone in the past 7 years;these    
include book &amp; antique shops and a     
bank.The effects of commuting are      
evident here.
