		<content>A survey at the local hairdresser's    
found that the most popular style for  
men is short hair at the front, sides  
and back. For women the most popular   
style is permed hair with pointed sides
and the front brushed back.For girls it
is a "step" or mushroom cut, so called 
because it looks like a mushroom. Punk 
styles are worn by some young people.  
Here the hair is spiked and stands     
straight up on end as if the person has
seen a ghost.Sometimes it is dyed      
bright colours. There is also a very   
short "skinhead" cut. Both of these    
fashions are very spectacular,but      
neither is really popular with the     
people we interviewed. Many people used
he hairdressers regularly,but a large  
number, especially children, had their 
hair cut by their relations or         
neighbours in their own homes.
