		<content> The tourist industory in Walton caters
 mainly for day-trippers and caravan   
 dwellers.There are a couple of hotels 
 in the town,but it seems that most    
 weekly visitors stay at one of the    
 three caravan camps where they can be 
 entertained.Day visitors come by rail,
 coach or private car and usually spend
 most of their time on the beach or at 
 the parks.Other attractions in the    
 town itself include amusement arcades 
 and the pier. Walton is well known for
 its long golden beaches and these are 
 enjoyed by thousands of trippers each 
 summer.
