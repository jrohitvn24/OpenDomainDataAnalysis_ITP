		<title>12GROVEBURY FARM, LEIGHTON</title>
		<content>  Grovebury Farm is situated between   
 Billington and Leighton. The farmer's 
 family have rented the farm from the  
 council for twenty years.             
  It is mainly an arable farm, covering
 an area of 380 acres which is divided 
 into twenty fields. There are five    
 buildings on the farm, a grain store, 
 a tractor shed, a cattle building, a  
 calf house and a farm house.          
  The crops grown are wheat, barley,   
 oil seed rape and grass. They are     
 harvested between July and September  
 which is a very busy time on the farm.
 They use some of the crops to make    
 cattle food and the remainder is sold 
 to local merchants.                   
  There are about two hundred cattle on
 the farm, mainly of the Simmental     
 breed and are used for beef. Some of  
 the calves are bred on the farm but   
 others are bought at market.          </content>
