 dried leaves and dead  wood (which is 
 decomposing). Under fallen trees and  
 on the floor there are spiders, common
 beetles and many other small insects. 
 On the trees there are aphids, moths  
 and a few flying insects. In parts,   
 large areas of woodland floor are     
 covered with bluebells and ferns. The 
 woods have many mammals and birds in  
 them which include badgers, rabbits,  
 foxes and small rodents (mice etc.).
