		<title>19Ladock Children's Toys</title>
		<content>  The 30 infants in Ladock School told 
 us about the things they play with.   
 Nearly everyone has a Teddy Bear. Even
 the boys have dolls, they are called  
 Action Men. The girls play with dolls 
 called Barbie or Sindy. Many children 
 have hundreds of model soldiers or    
 cars. Several children have train sets
 and dads like to play with them too.  
 The boys like toys like tractors,     
 diggers and other mechanical toys. The
 girls prefer to play with dolls and   
 toys where you have to pretend.       
  The children said that if they had   
 lots of money they would spend it like
 this. 1 girl would buy a Teddy, l8    
 boys would buy space toys, 2 boys     
 would buy train sets, 7 girls wanted  
 dolls and 2 would buy a toy gun. Many 
 of the girls liked dressing up in old 
 clothes.Other popular toys were Noah's
 Arks, dolls houses and prams.         </content>
