		<content>  Hockenden house has one acre of land.
It was a farm house with a dairy and a 
bakery which are now old and half      
fallen down. The house owner would have
it rebuilt but she can't afford it.So  
the council call it a listed builing.It
was built over 300 years ago.There is a
priest hole in one of the bedrooms     
which,was used in the old days for     
priests to hide in,to get away from the
soldiers. In the front garden there is 
a Walnut tree and others around the    
house. One of the trees was 70 foot    
high but it was struck by              
lightning.There was so much wood that  
they made a fence around the front     
garden.
