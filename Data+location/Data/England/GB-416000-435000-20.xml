		<content>   We decided to conduct a survey of   
 all the children in our school to find
 out what activities they enjoyed in   
 their spare time.These are our        
 findings.The most popular hobby was   
 swimming.Football was the next most   
 popular,closely followed by snooker.  
 Music lessons,judo ,karate ,cubs      
 ,dancing ,gymnastics and cricket were 
 also enjoyed by many boys and girls.  
 Only 2 boys were members of the Boys  
 Brigade and one child was interested  
 in first aid.                         
                                       
   The Domesday Project survey of this 
 block was conducted by the following  
 schools:-Middle Schools -Hutton and   
 Thorpe;First Schools -Our Lady &amp; St.  
 Brendan's RC,Bolton Lane,Grove House  
 and St.Anthony's RC.Thanks to all
