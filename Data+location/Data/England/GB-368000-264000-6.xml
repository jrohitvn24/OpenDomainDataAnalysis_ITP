		<content> There are two{Village Halls}serving   
 this area.                            
 The hall at{Stanford-on-Teme}was      
 originally the Village School and on  
 closure was given to the villagers    
 residing in Stanford and Orleton by   
 the Winnington family, to be used     
 solely as a village hall - many and   
 varied social functions are held here 
 throughout the year.                  
 The other hall at{Upper Sapey}was     
 built in the late nineteen forties in 
 memory of Edith Silcocks, a former    
 headmistress of Sapey School - the    
{Sapey Cricket Club}are the main       
 users.                                
 A{Darts Club}and a{Rifle Shooting     
{Club}are based at the Stanford Bridge 
 Hotel.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
