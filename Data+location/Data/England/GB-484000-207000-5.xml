		<title>05Housing in Wendover</title>
		<content>The older buildings in Wendover, apart 
from the 13th century church, are in   
the centre of the village. The High    
Street has many examples of            
half-timbered houses, some             
sympathetically adapted as shops. In   
Tring Road is a row of heavily thatched
cottages built around the 1600s. Along 
the Aylesbury Road, houses with earlier
building characteristics display a     
range of 18th century frontages. Many  
houses in the village date from the    
late 19th century period but there is  
evidence of  modern in-filling. After  
slow growth before World War II, the   
village has undergone considerable     
development in the last 40 years mainly
through the building of a Council      
Estate and speculative private         
building. Prices in this favoured area 
range from 30,000 pounds to 180,000    
pounds.                                </content>
