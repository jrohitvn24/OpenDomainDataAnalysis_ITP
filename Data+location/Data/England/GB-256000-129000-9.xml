		<title>09A DAY OUT IN SQUARE THREE</title>
		<content> Square three was Landkey. My group    
 went in Mrs. Moore's car. When we got 
 to Landkey all we could see was       
 fields. As we drove on we saw the     
 village and we stopped there to do our
 sketches. I drew the "Ring o' Bells"  
 inn. Also I drew the houses that were 
 attached to it. After doing our       
 sketches we walked down to the river. 
 We stayed there for a while then made 
 our way back to the car which was     
 parked near the church. We got into   
 the car and made our way back to      
 school with a little time to spare.
