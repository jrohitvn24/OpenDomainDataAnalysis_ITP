		<content>   In Alvechurch there are clubs for   
 children from the age of 7 to the age 
 of 18, including youth clubs,         
 brownies, girl guides, cubs, scouts,  
 seekers. There is also a disco in the 
 village hall at times. The school     
 also does a disco about once every 2  
 months. There is a canal where some   
 people fish and there is a small      
 library in Alvechurch. There are 2    
 clubs and 3 pubs, one is a working    
 mens club.                            
   Down Meadow Lane, opposite the Red  
 Lion, are the meadows with a football 
 pitch, swings, a slide, a roundabout, 
 a tyre swing, and shelters.           
   In Peck Wood, a wood not far from   
 the village there is an adventure     
 playground for children from          
 Birmingham.
