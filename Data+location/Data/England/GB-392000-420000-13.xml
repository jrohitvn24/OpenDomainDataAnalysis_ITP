		<title>13Farming in Walsden (Part 1)</title>
		<content>    Farming in Walsden is mostly       
 confined to the steep upper valley    
 sides, the hilltops and the moors.    
 Many farmsteads are now used purely as
 dwelling houses and the land either   
 left to revert to moorland or rented  
 off to other farmers.                 
    Arable farming is not possible as  
 the soil is not deep enough. Many     
 farms are still suffering from the    
 after effects of the war, when fields 
 were ploughed up disturbing the land  
 drains. In consequence much of the    
 land is becoming wetter. Oats will    
 grow but will not fully ripen.        
    Dairying is now on a quota system  
 so farmers are not able to milk as    
 many cows as the land would sustain.  
 Often farms now exist solely for beef 
 'hill cows' and 'hill sheep'.
