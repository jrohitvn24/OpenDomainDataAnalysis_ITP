		<content>{THE PARISH COUNCIL                    
{ }There's been a Parish Council since 
 1890. There are six people. There is a
 chairman, Miss Lyon and a clerk whose 
 name is Mrs.Dilly who lives in West   
 End. The clerk is the person who      
 people visit and complain about       
 things. Then at the next meeting,the  
 clerk talks about the things that     
 people have complained about. About   
 four of the people turn up at meetings
 normally. The Parish Council has quite
 a lot of power. It stretches from     
 Essendon to the outskirts of Hatfield.
 One of the special projects they have 
 got on at the moment,is keeping the   
 village tidy. They would like to keep 
 the village the way it is,in the      
 future. They mainly work with the     
 Essendon Society,if they work with    
 other societies. People would like to 
 see the conservation area enlarged.   </content>
