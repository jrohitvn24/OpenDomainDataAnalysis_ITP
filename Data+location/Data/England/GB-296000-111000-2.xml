		<title>02ATTITUDES TO RELIGION</title>
		<content>   There are five{churches}on the      
 eastern outskirts of Tiverton, most of
 which are concentrated on the western 
 side near the town centre.            
   When we were conducting our survey, 
 the people who were interviewed were  
 mainly reluctant to talk about        
 religion. Even when asked general     
 questions their{attitude}was one of   
 unease.                               
   In our survey, most people belonged 
 to the{Church of England;}some were   
 non-conformist, belonging to the      
{Baptist or Methodist}denominations; a 
 very small proportion were{Roman      
{Catholic.}Our area is not a           
 multi-faith area as we have a very    
 small immigrant population; we have no
 temples or mosques.                   
   Generally, though, the people who   
 were interviewed held no strong       
 beliefs about religion.               </content>
