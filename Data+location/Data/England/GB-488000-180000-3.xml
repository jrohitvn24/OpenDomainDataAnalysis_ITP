   In the early seventies the Leisure  
 Centre was opened.It is called The    
 Magnet.Before the Leisure Centre was  
 built Maidenhead  possessed an outdoor
 swimming pool which could only be used
 in warm weather.Now we have an indoor 
 pool which is open all the year.      
                                       
                                       
   There are many interesting things   
 that you can do at the Leisure Centre.
 There are squash and badminton        
 courts,a sauna and hairdressers,a bar 
 and cafe.There is also a very large   
 sports hall that is used for very     
 large functions as well as sports.    
 There are plans to extend the Leisure 
 Centre and build a small theatre but  
 whether these will materialise time   
 will tell.
