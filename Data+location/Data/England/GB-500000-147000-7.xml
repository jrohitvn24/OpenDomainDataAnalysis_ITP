		<content>{Industry.}The Ministry of Agriculture,
 Fisheries and Food is a computerised  
 office, dealing with administration in
 farming. It employs 600 people. There 
 is also a publishing firm specialising
 in foreign travel picture books.      
                                       
{Law and Order.}As well as the main    
 Guildford police force there are two  
 local policemen in the area. One      
 covers Shalford and Peasmarsh and the 
 other St. Martha's, Blackheath, Albury
 Heath and Rice's Corner. The main     
 crimes are theft, burglary and        
 speeding. The policemen travel around 
 their areas on bicycles and work in   
 shifts. On average there is one       
 burglary a week, although they have   
 decreased due to better security for  
 houses e.g. burglar alarms. Both      
 policemen live in their villages and  
 are careful to maintain a good image. </content>
