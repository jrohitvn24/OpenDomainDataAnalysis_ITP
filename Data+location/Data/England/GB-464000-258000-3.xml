		<title>03HALL - SILVER JUBILEE FETE</title>
		<content>On the 29th &amp; 30th June 1985 we held a 
special 2 day fete on our Green to     
commemorate the {Silver Jubilee} of our
Village Hall; the fete is usually a one
day affair. It began with a carnival   
led by the Rose Queen's float, followed
by floats from various village clubs.  
The fete was opened by Viscount Althorp
(his sister is Diana, the Princess of  
Wales) - his father had officially     
opened the Hall in 1960. Soon a Wild   
West Show started up &amp; BMX &amp; Dog       
Training displays amused the crowd and 
there were stalls all around the Green.
The Green became a mass of people      
laughing, running and enjoying         
themselves. In the school there was a  
photographic exhibition of Village     
History. Similar things happened on the
Sunday plus the annual Round the       
Village Road Race. The weekend ended   
with a family barbecue.                </content>
