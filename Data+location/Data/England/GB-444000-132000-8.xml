 REFERENCE{044450132.}THE POST OFFICE  
 HAS ABOUT 150 CUSTOMERS EACH DAY.THE  
 POST MISTRESS' HUSBAND WORKS BEHIND   
 THE COUNTER WHICH SELLS{T.V. LICENSES}
 AND GIVES PENSIONS AND CAN START      
 CHILDRENS ACCOUNTS. THE POST MISTRESS 
 WORKS BEHIND THE SWEETS COUNTER.I WAS 
 AMAZED BY SOME OF THE ANSWERS WE GOT. 
 THE POST MISTRESS WAS VERY NICE AND   
 TRIED TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS.THEY
 DO NOT HAVE ANY PETS BUT THEY DO HAVE 
 TWO BOYS.WE TOOK OUR BLACK CLIP BOARDS
 TO WRITE DOWN THE ANSWERS.THE POST    
 MISTRESS AND POST MASTER HAVE BEEN    
 WORKING IN THE POST OFFICE FOR ABOUT  
 TEN YEARS.THEY LIKE LITTLETON A LOT   
 BECAUSE IT IS SMALL AND QUIET.
