		<title>09The Population of Cattistock</title>
		<content> The population of the area consists of
 about 540, of whom roughly 12% are    
 retired, with the same percentage aged
 under 17 years.   There are           
 insufficient children of primary      
 school age to warrant a school in the 
 village, so those children travel by  
 coach to a nearby village.   There is 
 a playgroup for under 5 year-olds in  
 the same village.   The children of   
 11 years and over attend a            
 comprehensive school about 11 miles   
 distant;  they also travel by coach.  
 There are some agricultural workers in
 the village still, but quite a few    
 inhabitants commute to the local towns
 for their various occupations.        
 There is very little dialect spoken   
 nowadays, except a word here and there
 from those few born in the area, now  
 probably less than a quarter of the   
 population.                           </content>
