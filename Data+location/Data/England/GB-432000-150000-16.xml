		<title>16TANGLEY HOUSE-NR.HATHERDEN</title>
		<content> Mr.Mrs. Colvin own 600 acres in       
 Tangley and live in Tangley House     
 which they bought from                
 Mrs.Smith-Pearce in 1960.They have    
 five helpers on their Upper Green Farm
 which supplies three other farms with 
 water from three 400 feet deep        
 wells.Mr.Colvin has been a Member of  
 Parliament since 1979 and now         
 represents Romsey and Waterside and is
 also Paliamentary Private Secretary in
 the Foreign Office.From Monday to     
 Thursday evening they live in London  
 near the Houses of Parliament and     
 spend most weekends either in Romsey  
 or relaxing at home in Tangley.By     
 train it takes them one and a quarter 
 hours to commute from Andover to      
 London and 25 years ago they were     
 almost the only commuters. This is a  
 major change that they have noticed.
