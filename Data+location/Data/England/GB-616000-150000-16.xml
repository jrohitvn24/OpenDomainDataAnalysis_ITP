		<content> Traditional crafts have always been a 
 feature of rural life and these skills
 have assumed a new importance today.  
 Many of the older women are proficient
 in weaving, tapestry, crochet, patch- 
 work, lace-making etc. and younger wo-
 men are anxious to learn. In Kingston,
 ladies meet weekly for a social work- 
 ing hour. Gardening, too, is popular, 
 many people preferring to grow their  
 own produce, and there is friendly    
 competition at the local horticultural
 shows. Jams, pickles and chutneys are 
 still made, but freezing seems to have
 replaced other methods of preserving. 
 Many people's interests extend beyond 
 what is available in their own village
 and opportunities exist to participate
 in music, art, sport, and a wide range
 of courses provided by the Adult Educ-
 ation Dept. Theatres, concert halls   
 and cinemas are within easy reach.    </content>
