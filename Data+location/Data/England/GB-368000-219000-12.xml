		<title>12Huntley Manor and Estate</title>
		<content> We visited{Huntley Manor House}and    
 were shown round by the present owner.
 Her father had planted most of{Newent 
{Woods}and the estate was very large.  
 Changes have taken place recently and 
 the estate has been divided up with   
 several firms holding interests.{     
{Huntley Manor House}was built in the  
 19th Century for the then Rector Rev. 
 H. Miles and used as his home. We saw 
 some lovely stained glass windows in  
 the house and the present owner's     
 family crest. As well as{Huntley Manor
 the owner owns{Woodend Farm,Huntley   
{School of Equitation}and quantities of
 woodland. The farm is 550 acres and   
 there are over 1500 acres of{woodland.
{Forestry}is important and we found out
 that recently replanting has been     
 mainly hardwoods. We saw the new areas
 of cultivation and the site where     
 felled timber is sawn up and treated. </content>
