 Mrs. Thorogood who supervised the     
 computer work.                        
    The work was displayed in an       
 exhibition from which the necessary   
 information was gathered for the      
 computer pages.                       
    Although the 12 kilometer squares  
 are south of the centre of the village
 the information is about Sible        
 Hedingham thanks to the co-operation  
 of De Vere School Castle Hedingham who
 were allocated the squares covering   
 the village.                          </content>
