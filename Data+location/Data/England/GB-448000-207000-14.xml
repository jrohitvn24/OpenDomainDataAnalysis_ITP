		<content>  When we visited W.Lucy &amp; Company Ltd,
we were told that they manufacture     
parts for electricity substations,     
lamp posts,main house fuses and        
electrical distribution equipment.They 
use brass,copper,steel,iron,zinc and   
plastic.They recycle brass,copper and  
iron for further use.They have four    
furnaces.We did not see these working  
because they are in prohibited areas.  
  We were suprised at the technological
level that the factory had reached.The 
floor manager told us that,to keep up  
with demands,most of the machines are  
automated or computerized.Although     
computers took the place of some men   
Lucy's has managed to find more work   
for those who lost their old jobs.     
  The company is 95% self sufficient.  
They make almost all of the components,
so they are not affected by the        
industrial action of their suppliers.  </content>
