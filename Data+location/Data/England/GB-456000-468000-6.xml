 different drivers throughout the 24   
 hour of cover.Rural officers,         
 sometimes called Community Policemen, 
 used to be called country bat men, or 
 vilalge policemen are based in the    
 surrounding villages of Sutton,       
 Raskelf and Linton. They share        
 responsibility for this area. The

 disputes, also minor vandalism which  
 rarely gets solved. There are a few   
 problems related to drinkwhcih appears
