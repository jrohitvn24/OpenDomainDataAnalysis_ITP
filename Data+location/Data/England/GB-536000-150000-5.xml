		<title>05Health Centre &amp; New Ramp.</title>
		<content>    The{Oxted Health Centre}is situated
 in Gresham Rd., just off the main High
 Street.{6 Doctors}take their surgeries
 in a large modern building.   Patients
 make appointments to see their  Doctor
 by 'phoning the Doctors' Secretary.   
{  Surgery hours}are 8.45 - 10 a.m. and
 5.15 - 6.30 p.m.  There is a{Treatment
{Room} where a nurse dresses wounds and
 gives injections to save the Doctors' 
 time.    There is also a{Baby Clinic},
{Weight-watchers}and{Ante-Natal Clinic.
    We are very lucky to have such good
 medical facilities near us.           
{  * Ramp * }For 2 years money has been
 raised for a{RAMP}to be built at{Oxted
{Station}so that{Mums}with prams,{old  
{people}with trollies &amp;{disabled people
 in wheelchairs will be able to use the
 Station &amp; Subway more easily. One shop
 is being knocked down, but a new shop-
 ping centre will be built by the ramp.</content>
