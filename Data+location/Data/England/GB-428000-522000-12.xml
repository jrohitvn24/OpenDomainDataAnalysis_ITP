		<title>12Old People Link With School</title>
		<content> An aim of Sugar Hill School is to make
 pupils socially aware and to encourage
 community involvement.At Christmas    
 1984 therefore a link was forged      
 between pupils and the elderly of     
 Shafto House.Pupils decorated the Old 
 People's Home with Christmas Art work,
 performed a Carol Service and gave    
 gifts of crocus bulbs planted earlier.
 Matron,staff and residents enjoyed it 
 so much that an Easter visit was      
 arranged,which followed the same form.
 In July,pupils and teachers donated   
 flowers, wrapped individually and     
 these were given to the residents by  
 the children as they left,after       
 singing their favourite hymns and     
 songs.                                
  The link is now very strong,and      
 beneficial to both the residents and  
 the children.It is hoped that it will 
 continue on a termly basis.           </content>
