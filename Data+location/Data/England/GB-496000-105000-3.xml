		<title>03Walberton School _ Parents</title>
		<content>   One of the great strengths of       
 Walberton Primary School is the close 
 involvement in the school of many     
 parents.  There is a thriving PTA     
 which organizes social functions and  
 raises funds (Â£1200+ last year) for   
 such items as PE equipt., TVs,        
 computers, stage lights, swimming     
 pool, projectors, music centres, etc. 
   In addition dozens of parents come  
 in every week for such varied tasks as
 teaching French; listening to readers;
 taking groups for cooking, music and  
 games; running after school clubs for 
 chess and computers; helping with     
 school outings and swimming lessons;  
 running a bookshop; looking after the 
 library; etc.                         
   All this not only helps the children
 to have a broader, richer school life 
 but also gives the parents a better   
 view of the pros and cons of school.  </content>
