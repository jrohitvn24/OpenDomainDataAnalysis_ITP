		<content>   The overall impression that a       
 visitor would leave our area with     
 would be one of contrast.Large areas  
 are predominantly grass,farms and     
 woodland ,with isolated farms         
 scattered throughout.Pockets of       
 older mining communities are being    
 absorbed by expanding{residential     
 areas and new industries.Much of this 
 change has been brought about by the  
 M1.Spoiled land from mining and       
{industrial}dereliction is agricultural
 and recreational activities.Industrial
 and mining eyesores are less obvious  
 because of thoughtful locations,      
 healthy interest in enviromental      
 health and conservation.              
   It is hoped that new industries will
 be attracted to the area to counteract
 the present high level of unemployment
 and the effects of National Coal Board
 rationalisation plans.                </content>
