		<title>05THE GRAPHIC DESIGNER</title>
		<content>                                       
     We visited a graphic designer. He 
designs things like advertisements     
for pig floors and sultana packets, and
he also plans out maths books and      
materials for schools.                 
     He designs nine packets and       
choses one of them and sees if the     
people who he works for like it. He    
uses felt tip pens when he does the    
designs, it is so neat it looks like a 
type writer has done it or it has been 
printed.                               
     On the leaflets he has to make    
sure he explains things properly. One  
of his leaflets that I thought was     
very interesting was about the pig     
floor. He has a lot of items in        
magazines. He designs leaflets for     
drinks and packets of things. He works 
at home, but he often has to go out to 
meet people in his job.                </content>
