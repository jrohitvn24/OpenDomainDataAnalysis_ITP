		<content> Inhabitants of the area enjoy living  
 here, although there is a faster      
 turnover of occupancy than in previous
 years due to the 'new middle class'.  
 These people tend to stay for         
 relatively short periods of time and  
 this has led to diminished interest in
 village activities. The class         
 structure in the area is clearly      
 defined in political persuasion -     
 there is a vast Conservative majority.
 Only rarely does one see the whole    
 village 'coming together' as it used  
 to do which is sadly missed by        
 established residents. Young people   
 especially find it hard financially to
 settle here and tend to move to the   
 towns nearer to their work. Young     
 mothers go out to work whilst their   
 children are still at school to help  
 with the family budget. These factors 
 all help to undermine village life.   </content>
