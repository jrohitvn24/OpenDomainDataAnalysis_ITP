		<title>12RELIGION -THE VICAR</title>
		<content>{Mr.Boultbee}has been at St.Merryn     
 church for six years now and he likes 
 it very much.                         
 Before he became a vicar he was a     
 business man.He has been a vicar      
 at Truro, Coverack, Helston and now at
 St.Merryn.                            
 He says that being a vicar is a 50/50 
 job, sometimes hard and somtimes      
 easy.                                 
 Mr. Boultbee thinks that more people  
 are becoming religious, although it is
 still not many people it is an        
 improvement.The church congregation is
 more than keeping pace with natural   
 wasteage.                             
 Mr.Boultbee was amazed recently to    
 discover that there have been several 
 vicars in his family.                 
 He has always believed in God but only
 made a firm comittment some 31 years  
 ago.                                  </content>
