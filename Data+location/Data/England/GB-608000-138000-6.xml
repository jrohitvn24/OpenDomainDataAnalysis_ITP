		<content> The working population of the area is 
 involved in a wide variety of lines of
 employment such as farming,finance,   
 education,manufacturing,engineering,  
 retail and wholesale trades,industrial
 research and transport.Most work in   
 the larger urban areas of Ashford,    
 Folkestone and Canterbury,though some 
 work further afield in Maidstone or   
 London.Since by far the majority of   
 working residents work outside the    
 locale,this is mainly a dormitory     
 area.The level of unemployment is     
 below the national average,much work  
 being available during harvest periods
 for casual labour,particularly women, 
 in order to assist with the harvesting
 of vegetable and soft fruit crops.    
 However,school leavers are finding it 
 increasingly difficult to obtain long 
 term jobs locally and are hence having
 to move to other parts of Britain.    </content>
