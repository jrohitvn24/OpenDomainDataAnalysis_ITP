		<title>12Bovis Building Area Trentham</title>
		<content>In 1985 Bovis started building on the  
7.5 acre plot.The plot used to be a    
farm. There are going to be 52 houses  
on the plot on Constance Avenue and    
Pacific Road .There is a 2.5 acre spare
area in the middle which  is going to  
be a park.There is a fault in part of  
the surface so they have put in        
hardcore after digging out a massive   
hole.The houses are quite big with twin
garages.Some are bungalows.At the      
moment they have built 2 houses. They  
have brought in a lot of machinery like
diggers and dumpers and lorries.They   
are leaving most of the trees to go in 
peoples gardens.The bushes will be     
chopped or burnt down.Bovis has built  
many of the houses in Trentham most of 
them are in Hunters Oak.
