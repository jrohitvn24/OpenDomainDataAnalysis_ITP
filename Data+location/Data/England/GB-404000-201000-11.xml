		<title>11THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT</title>
		<content>  Since the old people's bungalows and 
 flats were built, there are increasing
 numbers of people over 80. There is   
 concern for their welfare. The        
 District Council have been asked to   
 provide a warden. They have refused.  
 Many are concerned that the price of  
 houses prevents young couples with    
 children moving into the area which   
 means that the number of children at  
 the village school is decreasing.     
 Dogs, out of the 154 dogs in the      
 village, fouling the footways concern 
 those interested in health. There are 
 constantly calls for a speed limit    
 through the village. Some people would
 like street lighting. There is always 
 a worry about the dumping of household
 and builders' rubbish on farmland and 
 in gateways. A guide to the footpaths 
 has been published because concern was
 felt that they were being lost.       </content>
