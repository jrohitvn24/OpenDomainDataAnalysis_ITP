		<content> Saturday morning, Dad went to work.   
 The rest of us had a lie in.  My      
 brother went to Newcastle.My sister   
 and I watched television and          
 afterwards I went to the village to   
 buy a Father's Day card and two guinea
 pigs.After dinner I went to Grandma's,
 while Mam went to Newcastle. I watched
 T.V.again and then visited my Great   
 Grandma who is eighty five.  I stayed 
 the night with my Grandma as my       
 parents were at a wedding reception   
 disco at Spanish City, Whitley Bay.   
 On Sunday morning I walked home with  
 my brother and sister and we played on
 our bikes.  After dinner my parents   
 took us to see The Northumberland     
 Tattoo on 'The Links'. We watched pipe
 bands, drum bands,  Highland Dancers, 
 paratroopers and a motorbike display  
 team.After fish and chips we went     
 home.                                 </content>
