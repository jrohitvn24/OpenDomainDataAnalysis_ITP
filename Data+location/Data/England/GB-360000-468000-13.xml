		<title>13THE LOCAL POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> The local policeman, stationed in     
 Wray, covers the villages of Wray,    
 Wennington and Lowgill and is governed
 by Lancashire Division, the second    
 largest in England. Working hours are 
 from 8 am to midnight on a shift      
 basis. When off-duty he is covered by 
 policemen from Lancaster. Personal    
 radio provides the link with Lancaster
 and also with the force headquarters  
 at Hutton. The basic role of the rural
 policeman is more to prevent than to  
 solve crime. He patrols in his own    
 car, receiving an allowance, and his  
 physical presence acts as a deterrent 
 to possible offenders. In addition to 
 the usual function of the policeman   
 those in rural areas must act as      
 "jacks of all trades" in dealing with 
 road traffic, various agricultural    
 regulations and wildlife preservation 
 matters including poaching.           </content>
