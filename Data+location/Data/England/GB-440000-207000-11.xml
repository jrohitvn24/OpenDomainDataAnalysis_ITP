		<content>The main road in our grid is the A40   
which runs north of the grid.During the
year of 1985 we did a survey on        
transport.Over 60% of Eynshams         
population have got a car and most     
people have got a bicycles,but some    
people havn't got a bicycles and       
cars.We have different makes of cars   
like:Ford and Austin.The main source of
power used in our cars is Petrol.      
 Two buses run in Eynsham.One goes to  
Church Hanborough which is about 2.5   
miles away.One bus goes 17 times in a  
week and one only comes twice.We have  
motorcars that can go up too 170 mph   
but we are only can go 70 mph as a     
max.speed.  BY ROGER MARSHALL,MARK
