		<title>13TINTWISTLE IN LONGDENDALE</title>
		<content> The village of Tintwistle, 12 miles   
 east of Manchester and a mile north   
 west of Hadfield station, overlooks   
 Longdendale. Up to 1974 it was in     
 Cheshire but is now in Derbyshire.    
   The main road through the village is
 part of the busy Woodhead Road, the   
 main route from Manchester into       
 Yorkshire. It suffers from heavy      
 traffic most of the day.              
   Many of the houses are 19th century 
 and are built of gritstone from the   
 local quarries, now no longer working.
 Many of these houses have been        
 renovated.                            
   There is a small village green in   
 the centre of the village. There are  
 two reservoirs - Bottoms and Arnfield.
 A large house is attached to Arnfield 
 Reservoir and is used as a Field Study
 Centre by Manchester Education        
 Committee.                            </content>
