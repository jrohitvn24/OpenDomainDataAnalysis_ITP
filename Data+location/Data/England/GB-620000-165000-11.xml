		<content>{ARCHITECTURE:}There are quite a       
 number of 16th and 17th Century       
 buildings surviving in the area. Some 
 of the{Tudor}half-timbered houses are 
 hard to spot because of (usually      
 Georgian) alterations.  Within, the   
 oak rafters and panelling are proudly 
 displayed. Later houses built in red  
 brick with "Flemish Gables" and       
 peg-tile roofs are to be found.  At   
 Grays and elswhere there are fine     
 example of {Georgian}architectural    
 style as applied to farmhouses.       
 Marshside Methodist Chapel, and       
 cottages at Boyden Gate are Victorian.
 Buildings of the 1920s and 1930s are  
 noticably lacking, perhaps due to the 
 deep slump in farming during that     
 period.  An exception is the fine{Road
{House}at Hawthorn Corner.
