		<title>15Health in Gunton</title>
		<content> This area, consisting chiefly of the  
old Gunton Estate, has no medical      
facilities. A Doctor lives within tree 
miles and there are medical practices  
and small Cottage Hospitals in the     
nearby towns. Maternity cases and      
serious medical cases fase a journey of
up to 20 miles to the Norfolk &amp; Norwich
Hospital. Ambulances when necessary are
called from Cromer 6 miles away. A     
considerable number of both men and    
women do manual work, often outdoors,  
and generally enjoy good health.       
 A sewage works in Tops Hill Road      
serves the village of Thorpe Market and
is controlled by the Anglian Water     
Authority. Nonagenarians are not       
exceptional. The population of this    
area is under 200 (of all ages), 60 of 
whom live in the Hall with a further 50
in the park.                           
                                       </content>
