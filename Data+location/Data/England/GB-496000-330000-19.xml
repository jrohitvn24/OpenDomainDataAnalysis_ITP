		<title>19LIFE IN BOOTHBY PAGNELL,1985</title>
		<content>   The population of Boothby Pagnell   
 has gone down in the past 20 years.It 
 is now around 100.Another thing that  
 has changed is that when my cousin was
 a girl,everyone knew everyone else in 
 the village.Now she doesn't know half 
 the people who live there.She says    
 that there are mostly town people who 
 live in the village and commute to the
 towns and cities nearby.A lot of them 
 work in London.                       
   The post-office used to be a        
 post-office cum general store but now 
 there is no call for it.It now only   
 sells eggs from my cousin's farm.There
 are no mobile shops anymore either.   
   Even so the villagers get their milk
 and newspapers delivered to them.     
   There is one telephone box in the   
 village.The bus service runs through  
 the village around five times a day   
 when it travels between nearby towns. </content>
