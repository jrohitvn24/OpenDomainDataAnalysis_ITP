		<content> The Domesday Commissioner swayed in   
 his saddle, then fell heavily to the  
 ground. When he rose to his feet his  
 guards saw a look of absolute terror  
 on his face. They looked towards the  
 nearby church before making the sign  
 of the cross. My God. What has        
 happened? In the sky a big screaming  
 bird. A three-eyed creature with each 
 eye a different colour! The houses    
 like palaces. This must be Hell! A    
 giant monster coming for me, huge     
 silver teeth. Its passed through me   
 but its stinking breath chokes me.    
 Another giant, red, carrying people it
 must have eaten. A wizard with pink   
 spikey hair swaggers towards me, a    
 plume of white smoke coming from his  
 mouth and behind him a squat, red     
 being frozen with its mouth open. This
 wizard is cruel. He has seen me, my   
 God please forgive my sins!           </content>
