		<title>15Notton Gala</title>
		<content> On Sunday I went to Notton Gala.There 
 were lots of stalls like the coconut  
 shy.It all started with the parade.   
 You could be a clown and I was one.I  
 had my hair sprayed red and blue.The  
 clowns had to walk down to the green  
 after the brass band.When we were half
 way down it started to rain.Maria won 
 a game because she was the best clown.
 I had to go home to get changed       
 because I was wet.                    
   My mum was helping with a marble    
 game.I won 20p on game.You had to find
 the whole egg and I did.My dad helped 
 too.He won a coconut and we haven't   
 finished eating it yet.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
