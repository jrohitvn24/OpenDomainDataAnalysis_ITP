		<title>10WOODLAWN SPECIAL SCHOOL</title>
		<content>I attended Woodlawn Special School     
before I came to South Wellfield First 
Shool in September 1984.Woodlawn is for
physically handicapped children.Most of
friends were in wheelchairs.Melanie    
couldn't use her legs or arms.She wrote
with a pencil in her mouth.In the      
mornings we did normal schoolwork.At   
dinnertime the nannies and teachers    
helped children to cut up their        
food.Some children had special diet    
meals.In  the afternoons we had Art,   
stories,played games or went out in the
mini-bus.We went to Fenwick's          
department store in Newcastle to see   
Santa Claus.Sometimes soft toy         
equipment was brought to school for us 
to play on.I was in The Wizard of Oz as
the good witch and I sang "Somewhere   
Over the Rainbow."
