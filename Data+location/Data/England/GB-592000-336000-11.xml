		<title>11Modern Blacksmith &amp; Farrier</title>
		<content> Working as a farrier in 1985 was very 
 different from years ago when he made 
 all his own tools.A Blacksmith made   
 everything from a nail to horse drawn 
 implements.He made all the shoes he   
 put on horses.Very often he made his  
 own horse shoe nails,and also tools   
 like pincers,knives,buffers for taking
 shoes off,sugar beet hooks,turnip     
 picks and hand hoes.All cart_wheels   
 were shod with iron tires by the local
 blacksmith.All this work was done on a
 coal forge which was blown by hand    
 bellows,and a lot of sweat.Today's    
 blacksmith and farrier uses factory   
 _made shoes and tools which are to a  
 high standard.He travels from his     
 forge to the horses by car,sometimes  
 travelling many miles a day and is    
 kept very busy.
