		<title>12GUNARD COASTAL FOOTPATH.</title>
		<content> There is a path which runs right round
 the Island, it is called the coastal  
 footpath.In this area it runs from the
 Woodvale,up the hill to Solent View   
 Road,along the marsh and then follows 
 the cliff path for about two miles,   
 turning inland to Pilgrims park at    
 Thorness.Round the Island there are   
 lots of wild flowers on the cliff     
 path,the{Dog Rose,}the{Common Purple  
{Orchid}and{Clover}were some of the    
 ones we saw most.On the sign post near
 the marsh it said 1 mile to Thorness 3
 miles to Porchfield.As well as the big
 flowers there were smaller flowers,   
{Stitchwort,Rock Roses}and{Vetch.}We   
 picked some of them to press.Bits of  
 the path couldn't go right by the sea 
 because of private land.In some places
 because the path was breaking up so   
 much, we had to hang onto the wire    
 fence to stop us from slipping.       </content>
