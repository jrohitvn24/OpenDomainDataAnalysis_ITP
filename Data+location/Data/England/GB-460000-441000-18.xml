		<title>18Housing Summary.</title>
		<content> Escrick has 5 main types of houses.{  
{Estate houses}were largely built      
 before 1915:originally 48 houses,and 4
 more in 1948/49.Now 33 houses belong  
 to the Estate,the rest having been    
 sold for private dwellings.All Estate 
 farmhouses are rented from the Estate.
 Workers from the Estate occupy the    
 houses,and widows and retired workers 
 remain in the houses,rent free,for as 
 long as they wish.These Estate houses 
 are either terraced or semi-detached, 
 most of them built with brick and     
 slate roofs with the occasional       
 pantiled roof.{Council houses}were    
 built on land purchased from the      
 Estate in 1951. 8 semi-detached       
 houses were built along the Skipwith  
 Road and a further 4 were built in    
 1956.Several of these properties have 
 been sold to tenants for private      
 dwellings.                            </content>
