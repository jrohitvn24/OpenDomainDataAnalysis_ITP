		<content> Our 'D' block covers the villages of  
{Cutsdean}and{Ford,}part of the village
 of{Temple Guiting}and other           
 settlements such as{Hyde}and{Colman.  
 As part of the North Cotswolds we have
 many hills and streams, the{River     
{Windrush}rises near to{Cutsdean,}flows
 through the rest of the block and     
 eventually joins the Thames near      
 Oxford. The land is mainly used for   
 arable farming although there are     
 several flocks of sheep, a few store  
 cattle and tree plantations.  Most    
 buildings are built of stone quarried 
 locally with stone roofs and large    
 gardens. Most of the children under 11
 go to the local school and then go    
 either to the Westwoods Grammar school
 or to Bourton Vale Secondary Modern   
 School. These schools are to be       
 amalgamated in the near future at     
 Bourton on the Water.                 </content>
