		<title>13KETTLEWELL TRUST LORDS</title>
		<content>   After the Dissolution of the        
 Monasteries, what was the Manor of    
 Kettlewell came into the possession of
 a group of London merchants, who sold 
 off areas of land to local lords or   
 sheep farmers, who were gaining       
 importance.                           
   By 1628 King Charles I gave control 
 to these yeomen who eventually became 
 Trust Lords, with their own steward,  
 barmaster, gamekeeper, and shepherd.  
 They had rights of turbary, drainage  
 and repair, with mineral rights on    
 their land, being self-reliant and    
 showing active interest in the        
 village. Today there are mainly local 
 farming members, with a secretary,    
 still called a barmaster.  About seven
 Trust Lords meet annually, for        
 charitable purposes, owning a small   
 amount of land, dealing with old      
 monuments or mineshafts on their land.</content>
