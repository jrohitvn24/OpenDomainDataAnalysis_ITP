The rector of St. Mary's C.E. Church   
in Bushbury is the Reverend Roger      
Hinton. He told us that there have     
been a lot of changes in the services  
over the past few years. The church    
belongs to the people to worship God   
in and everyone should take part.      
Many of the congragation, which is     
often 250 or more, play musical        
instruments during the hymns. There    
are house parties in the church,       
family services and an old people's    
service on Mondays. People used to do  
as they were told, but nowadays they   
like to think for themselves and do    
not always agree with the rector.      
There are a lot of activities during   
the week like choir practices, bible   
study classes and cubs. The church is  
about 500 years old, and has played a  
part in the history of Wolverhampton.  </content>
