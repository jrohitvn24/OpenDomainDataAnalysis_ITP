		<title>17Small Creatures at Stonegate</title>
		<content> We went for a walk on a Wednesday in  
 June looking for insects and          
 minibeasts.As we were walking we saw  
 some butterflies,including a small    
 tortoiseshell and two wood            
 butterflies.We found many flies,one of
 which was a green-bottle.We found lots
 of spiders;one of them had eggs and   
 was very neatly wrapped up in a tight 
 coccoon,protecting it from any        
 enemies.                              
 Here are some of the other creatures  
 we saw:                               
       ants,including a flying ant     
       two bees                        
       a hoverfly                      
       mosquitoes                      
       an earwig and a baby earwig     
       two beetles                     
       two moths                       
       a woodlouse.
