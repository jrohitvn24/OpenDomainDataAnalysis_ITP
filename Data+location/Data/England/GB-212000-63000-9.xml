		<title>09Changes in West Taphouse</title>
		<content> West Taphouse was a quiet hamlet which
 has been split by the A390 road.People
 once travelled by pony and trap or    
 walked or cycled,but now most people  
 travel by car or bus.                 
 Except for the two Council houses no  
 houses have been built in the area    
 since 1914.                           
 There used to be three shops in the   
 village now there are none.The nearest
 shop is at East Taphouse.There used to
 be lots of Roundsmen but there are not
 many now.                             
 There have been no services in the old
 chapel for at least 20_25 years.      
 The school used to take children from 
 age 5_14.Now it is a primary school   
 and takes children age 5_11.Children  
 used to walk to school but now they   
 are transported by bus or car.        
 West Taphouse farm is a listed        
 building.It is now a private house.   </content>
