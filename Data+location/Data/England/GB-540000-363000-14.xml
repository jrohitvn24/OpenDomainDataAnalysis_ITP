		<title>14HALTON HANDBELL RINGERS</title>
		<content> The Halton Handbell Ringers restarted 
 an old tradition in the village in    
 1979-and in 1985 there are 9 "ringers 
 all ladies of various ages and musical
 ability. There are 28 bells; from the 
 Loughborough Bell Foundry; half owned 
 by Saint Andrews Church, half by one  
 member. The bells are brass with      
 leather  handles and the tunes played 
 on them vary from hymns, carols, folk 
 tunes and extracts from pieces of     
 music such as Handel's Water Music.   
 The ringers play at church services,  
 festivals, charity occasions and      
 clubs  such as Women's Institues and  
 Over Sixties.                         
 The ringers wear no specific uniform. 
 They practise once a week on a        
 Thursday evening either in the church 
 or a member's home.
