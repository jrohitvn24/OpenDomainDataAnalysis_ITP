		<title>05FARMING IN THE EDGMOND AREA</title>
		<content>   Since Britain joined the{E.E.C.     
{farming}in{Edgmond}has not altered to 
 a great extent. Basically the same    
{crops}are grown, but with guaranteed  
 prices now in existance it pays to    
 over produce. This is the reason for  
 the vast Butter, Milk and Grain       
 Mountains. Previously Wheat and       
 Sugar-Beet were the principle crops   
 grown, but more recently - over the   
 past five years - Oil-Seed Rape and   
 Peas are produced on a greater scale. 
   As in many other areas, much larger 
 fields are now apparent due to hedge  
 removal as a result, much wildlife has
 been destroyed, which is a great pity.
   The developments which have most    
 influenced farming in the area in the 
 last 3 decadesare, the Breeding of new
 Plant Varieties, Herbicides to control
 weed growth and - in the last decade -
 Phangicides to Prevent Disease.       </content>
