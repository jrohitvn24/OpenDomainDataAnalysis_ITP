		<title>19PARKING IN HELSTON</title>
		<content> Helston has three main car parks. The 
 largest is in Trengrouse Way. At the  
 moment it provides parking for        
 approximately 170 cars. However, the  
 site of the car park is now to be used
 to build a new supermarket for the    
 town. Another car park is to be found 
 in Tyacke Road which has pedestrian   
 access to Coinagehall Street. This car
 park can take over 100 cars but the   
 surface is uneven and there are no    
 markings.                             
     There is another car park in      
 Wendron Street for 54 cars at a cost  
 of 30 pence per day. Down by the      
 cattle market is another car park     
 which is rarely used by shoppers      
 because it is far away from the main  
 shops. Beside the new by-pass around  
 Helston there is a free parking place 
 for 50 cars.
