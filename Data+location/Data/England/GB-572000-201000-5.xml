   Rainbows End has 1.4 acres of       
 land.It was built in 1968,which makes 
 it over 17 years of age. They started 
 selling fuchsias in 1980. They        
 sell geraniums as well. In the whole  
 world there are over 6,000 different  
 varieties of fuchsia and they have 500
 approx. varieties at the nursery.     
   The best month of the year to sell  
 their flowers is May and the worst    
 month is January.                     
   At the moment they water the plants 
 twice a day as it is summer and in    
 winter once a week. Under some of the 
 plants are volcanic stones, which soak
 up excess water from the plant's soil.
 Under the propagating bench are       
 heating cables to keep the plants     
 warm.
