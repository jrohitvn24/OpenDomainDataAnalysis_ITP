		<content> The end of the fighting in Europe was 
 not unexpected.We knew that the war   
 was coming to an end and so it was    
 just a case of waiting for the        
 official announcement.Even so when the
 day did come it was greeted with      
 relief,joy and thoughts of when would 
 loved ones in the armed forces be     
 coming home.Everyone set about        
 organising parties and entertainment  
 for the children and although food was
 rationed and so scarce,people produced
 items of food which had  been         
 carefully stored away.Everyone was    
 determined to enjoy themselves and the
 children's parties merged into parties
 for adults with singing and dancing   
 and the streets lit up specially for  
 the occasion.The Sheffield Arms and   
 the Ferry House Inn were full of      
 people celebrating.Not so one lady who
 heard that her son had been killed.   </content>
