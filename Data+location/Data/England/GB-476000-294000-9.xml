		<title>09HISTORY IN HALLATON TODAY 3</title>
		<content>  There are fine 18th century          
 residences in the village - for       
 example Hallaton Hall, now Torch      
 House, built in 1713. In 1843 Hallaton
 Manor was moved stone by stone from   
 its position by the Grange to the top 
 of the hill outside the village. It is
 now an old people's home with 30      
 residents and 20 staff.               
  In the High Street and Churchgate are
 two pumps used by the villagers until 
 25 years ago. Behind the Cross is a   
 water conduit which diverted water to 
 large houses.                         
  One cottage in Hog Lane now houses   
 the Hallaton Museum, which contains   
 many local treasures and items of     
 interest. It was opened in 1979 with  
 support from a number of villagers,   
 most notably Mrs H Bewicke Whigham.   
 It now has 260 exhibits and opens on  
 Sunday afternoons in Summer.          </content>
