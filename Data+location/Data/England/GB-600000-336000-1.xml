		<content> Well wooded arable land predominantly 
 wheat, barley, sugar beet and         
 potatoes.  Very few livestock.  Much  
 of land owned by an insurance company 
 pension fund.  Three small very pretty
 villages with mainly flintstone       
 cottages some used as second homes and
 very little modern development.  One  
 ilometre square contains no buildings 
 and area sparsely populated.  Area    
 crossed by main midlands to cromer    
 road, A. 148, and well served by      
 country lanes, bridlepaths and        
 footpaths.  A general lack of         
 amenities.  No schools or shops or    
 post office or public house.  About   
 four miles from nearest town.         
 Villages served by community minibus  
 ervice pioneered here.  Mostly retired
 people.  Little employment available  
 other than agriculture. No rereational
 facilities.  Land comparatively high  </content>
