		<title>12SERVICES AT ULLEY CHURCH</title>
		<content>{                                      
{   }The congregation is comparatively 
 small,usually about twenty people, out
 of a population of approximately two  
 hundred and twenty.As the congregation
 is so small the parish has been       
 incorperated with nearby Aston.As the 
 church is so small the services held  
 here are rather limited.Major         
 festivals  such as Christmas,Easter   
 and Mothering Sunday are observed with
 a special Communion Service every     
 Sunday at 9.00a.m.Family Service is   
 held at the beginning of each month at
 10.00a.m.Also an evening service is   
 held every month.                     
           Approximately two           
 christenings take place each year,many
 parents preferring to go to           
 Aston.Hardly anybody has been buried  
 here recently because of the fear of  
 earth movement.                       </content>
