		<content> HANDSTANDS: A caller nominates        
 variations of handstand forms as      
 follows- jellywobble (legs shaken in  
 the air), banana splits (legs parted) 
 chinese lantern (legs form diamond    
 shape), lock (feet close to back).    
 After each call, the participant      
 judged to be most successful by the   
 caller becomes caller in turn.        
 RABBIT STUCK IN THE MUD: One catcher  
 catches participants by touching them.
 When touched the captive stands still 
 with arms and legs outstretched until 
 being touched and thus freed by a free
 participant, who can also release by  
 crawling between the captives legs.   
 BUTTERFINGERS: Ball bowled to batsman 
 who deliberately hits the ball high   
 into the air. If fielder nearest to   
 the descending ball fails to catch it,
 he/she loudly called butterfingers. A 
 successful catcher becomes batsman.   </content>
