		<content> Set in the foothills of the Cheviots  
 and on the edge of the Northumbrian   
 National Park, our block of land is an
 area of small clusters of stone       
 houses, green fields and moorlands.   
                                       
 There are many scattered hamlets,     
 mainly farmhouses with three or four  
 farm cottages nearby. The main village
 of Powburn is the area with the       
 largest population - about 102 people.
 The only main road, the A697, runs    
 through this village on its way North 
 to Scotland.                          
                                       
 It is an area which is rich in        
 wildlife. It is particularly          
 attractive countryside for horseriding
 and this is a popular pastime. More   
 and more visitors are visiting the    
 area each Summer.
