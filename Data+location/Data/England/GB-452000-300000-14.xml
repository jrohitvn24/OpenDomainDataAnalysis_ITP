		<content> We went to the Welcombe Avenue Public 
 Library for  visit. Most of the people
 who go there are from Braunstone.     
 In the library, there are 13,116      
 books.Leicestershire County Council   
 owns the building and all of the books
 are paid for by the ratepayers.       
 There are 3 library assistants, 1     
 cleaner and the librarian come once   
 per week. In a half hour survey, 2    
 ladies, two men and a small boy came  
 in to the library to choose books.    
 You can have up to 4 tickets and this 
 will allow you to borrow up to 4      
 books. If you choose a book, the lady 
 at the desk takes out the ticket and  
 stmps the book with the date on which 
 it is due back, which is 3 weeks. If  
 you are late in returning your books, 
 you must pay a fine of 1p per book per
 day. It is always warm and quiet in   
 the library which was built in 1964.  </content>
