		<content>In Howfield Wood the firm of Bretts is 
carrying out gravel extraction.        
Careful land management is taking      
place.Large areas of sheep pasture     
are under temporary use as gravel      
sites.First the topsoil is removed,    
stored and the gravel extracted. Lakes 
are formed.The pits are then           
backfilled and the topsoil             
replaced.It soon returns to sheep      
pasture. There is a man who owns 88    
acres of woodland to the east of       
Dunkirk and has lived in a caravan in  
the middle of a 30 acre clearing in    
the woods for 15 years.He owns a       
haulage business.The lorries bring     
the waste rubble left over from        
motorway and roadway construction and  
repair work,and dump it in the         
clearing.It is then bulldozed flat.His 
site is beside the new A2.The timber   
cut in the clearing is sold for pulp.  </content>
