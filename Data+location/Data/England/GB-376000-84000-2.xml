		<content> THE GREAT VARIETY OF{HOUSING}IN OUR   
 BLOCK RANGES FROM THE{MANOR HOUSE}WITH
 ORIGINS IN 1263-80 TO MODERN FOUR     
 BEDROOM{EXECUTIVE HOMES},TO{TIED FARM 
{COTTAGES}AND{COUNCIL HOUSES}.WE STILL 
 HAVE{4 ORIGINAL FARM HOUSES},THOUGH   
 ONLY ONE OF THESE WORKS TODAY.EACH HAD
 FARM WORKERS COTTAGES WHICH ARE STILL 
{THATCHED}.SINCE 1926 A{SMALL COUNCIL  
{ESTATE}HAS BEEN BUILT, 2 SMALL{PRIVATE
{ESTATES}AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME       
{IN-FILLING},BUT THE VILLAGE RETAINS   
 MUCH OF ITS{ORIGINAL CHARACTER.}      
 RECENTLY SOME OF THE COUNCIL HOUSES   
 HAVE BEEN{BOUGHT}BY THEIR OCCUPIERS   
 AND THIS TREND IS CONTINUING.THERE IS 
 ONE ALL YEAR{CARAVAN SITE}IN OUR      
 BLOCK.LITTLE NEW DEVELOPMENT IS       
 POSSIBLE AS RURAL PRESERVATION IS AN  
 IMPORTANT LOCAL ISSUE.
