      Schools in Dudley have a visiting
 nurse who looks for nits and veruccas.
 She will visit homes to see children  
 who are very ill or who may have been 
 the victim of child abuse. Many       
 children are not properly cared for   
 and she keeps an eye on them. The {   
{School Dentist}checks teeth in school 
 and then treats children at a local   
 clinic.                               </content>
