		<content> To the south of Westonzoyland lie the 
 villages of Moorland &amp; Fordgate.In    
 1981 a new village hall was built in  
 Moorland to serve the people of both  
 villages.The old hall was knocked down
 and the new built on the same         
 site.Somerset C.C.&amp; Sedgemoor D.C.    
 gave a grant to help towards the cost 
 but the villagers had to raise        
 thousands of pounds themselves.They   
 held all sorts of fund raising events.
 The Hall is now used by all the people
 of the two villages.There is a        
 Playgroup,a Badminton Club,a Youth    
 Club,A Gardening Club,and a Club for  
 older people.As wee as these regular  
 meetings there are often coffee       
 mornings,and Dances held by groups.   
 The Hall is run by a Committee of     
 Representatives from all the groups in
 the villages.This year it was awarded 
 the Prize for the best Villate Hall.  </content>
