		<content> Some people are concerned that the    
 character of village life is being    
 threatened by the wrong type of       
 housing development.{New housing}     
{estates}in Fiskerton and Morton are   
 thought to be out of keeping with     
 surrounding properties. Children      
 brought up in the area may have to    
 leave to find a house they can afford.
 The amount of{heavy traffic}on narrow 
 village roads affects the quality of  
 life, causes deterioration of roads   
 and is a hazard to pedestrians.       
 There is concern over the possible    
 future{withdrawal of bus and/or rail  
{services}as these are vital links for 
 rural communities.                    
{Dogs}barking and fouling both public  
 and private areas are a continuing    
 source of nuisance and concern. Many  
 feel that stricter laws should be     
 introduced to control this problem.   </content>
