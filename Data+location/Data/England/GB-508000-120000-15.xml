		<content> 'Horelands' at Broadford Bridge is the
 home of B.B.C. orchestral conductor   
 Kenneth Alwyn and his actress wife    
 Mary Law. Nearby lives Sheila Van Damm
 the former rally driver, of London    
 Windmill Theatre fame. Here too is the
 home/workshop of Roger Smith, crafts- 
 man in wood, who makes rocking horses 
 and furniture, mainly from oak. He has
 designed and made the new choir and   
 clergy stalls for Steyning Church, and
 the new bar at the Elephant and Castle
 Public House at West Chiltington.     
   A well-known landmark on B.2139 is a
 small cottage festooned with ironwork 
 and ornaments, where Mr Arnell, an    
 elderly Sussex local, restores genuine
 old gypsy caravans - sometimes for    
 genuine gypsies!  In the garden is a  
 splendid example, once featured in a  
 TVS regional broadcast.  Looking from 
 its doorway is a cut-out countrywoman.</content>
