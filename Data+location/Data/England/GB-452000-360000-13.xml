		<title>13MANSFIELD COLLEGE OF ARTS</title>
		<content>{THE COLLEGE ON CHESTERFIELD ROAD} HAS 
 MANY ACTIVITIES HAPPENING THERE. FOR  
 EXAMPLE THERE ARE THE NIGHT CLASSES   
 FOR ADULTS WHO WANT TO TAKE A         
 PARTICULAR SUBJECT TO A FURTHER       
 DEGREE.THERE ARE ALSO THE SATURDAY    
 MORNING CLASSES FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE  
 INTERESTED IN CRAFT POTTERY,EMBROIDERY
 ETC.                                  
 THE CLASSES HAVE A SUBSCRIPITION OF   
 TWO POUNDS FOR EVERY TEN WEEKS.THE    
 SCHOOL ALSO ORGANISES TRIPS OUT TO    
 GALLERIES AND STUDIOS WHICH ARE ALL   
 FREE.THE SATURDAY MORNING CLASS STARTS
 AT 9am.AND FINISHES AT 11.30am..      
 THE COLLEGE ALSO HAS A SHOP WHERE     
 CRAFT EQUIPMENT IS SOLD AT A CHEAPER  
 PRICE THAN IN THE SHOPS.              
 I GO TO THE COLLEGE ON SATURDAY       
 MORNINGS AND ENJOY IT VERY MUCH AND I 
 AM GLAD THAT MANSFIELD HAS THIS       
 FACILITY.                             </content>
