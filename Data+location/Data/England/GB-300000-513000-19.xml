		<title>19CLEATOR MOOR FOR TOURISTS</title>
		<content> Cleator Moor is not exactly packed    
 with tourists but there are some nice 
 places to go to.                      
                                       
 The River Ehen at Wath Brow is very   
 pleasant with landscaping and seating.
 The water is shallow enough and easily
 reached for paddling.                 
                                       
 Many people climb the nearest big hill
 Dent for a pleasant walk. There is    
 roadway up to about halfway then you  
 walk through woods and open ground to 
 the top. Of course there is a         
 fabulous view from the top so it is   
 well worth the climb, which is not too
 arduous.                              
                                       
 For those who like the excitement of  
 water there is a ford to splash       
 through near Mill Hill, and the       
 viaduct can be seen from there.       </content>
