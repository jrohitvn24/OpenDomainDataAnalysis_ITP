 favourite game was she repiled HOP    
 SCOTCH to play{HOPSCOTCH}you have a   
 number grid with ten numbers you can  
 have any number of people playing     
 apart from one,each person has a stone
 and they have to throw it to number   
 one and they have to hop and jump up  
 to number ten missing then jump back  
 to number one if the stones lands on  
 the wrong side of it then its the next

 played outside a stone suface .
