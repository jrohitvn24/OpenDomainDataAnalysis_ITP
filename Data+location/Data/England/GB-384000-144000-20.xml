		<title>20WARMINSTER'S FUTURE</title>
		<content>  According to the latest Wiltshire    
 Structure Plan the population of      
 Warminster is unlikely to rise very   
 much in the near future.Most new house
 building is confined to infilling open
 spaces within the built up area of the
 town. Large scale housing developments
 are limited because little new land is
 available for development.To the north
 is Salisbury Plain, used by the Army  
 for training.On the other three sides 
 of the town are landscapes of high    
 value, including the Wylye Valley and 
 Longleat.                             
  The average age of Warminster's      
 population seems likely to rise.There 
 are already a number of old people's  
 homes &amp; there are many retired people 
 living in the town.Most people in the 
 town will continue to work in service 
 activities as new industries in the   
 town seem unlikely in the near future.</content>
