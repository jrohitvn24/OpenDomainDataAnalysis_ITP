		<title>15JESSICA VISITS A SAND QUARRY</title>
		<content> We went to two quarries. We saw big   
 pipes that sucked up the water and    
 sand and we saw a man go out in a boat
 to move a machine that sucks the sand 
 and water up and sends it in the      
 pipes. Then it goes into a very big   
 machine and that machine pours it out 
 into big piles. We saw the sand fall  
 down the piles. (In some quarries, if 
 the sand depth goes below the natural 
 water level, then a lake will be      
 formed as the sand is dug out.) Once  
 they sucked up a pike fish in the     
 machine. Next we went to a quarry     
 which was a "dry working" quarry. It  
 was nearly the same but there was no  
 pond that had pipes. The man told us  
 that sometimes they find interesting  
 things in quarries such as a mammoth's
 tooth and a Roman well containing     
 pottery and fossilised shells. Nearly 
 everybody drives a machine at work.   </content>
