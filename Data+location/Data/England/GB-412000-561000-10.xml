		<title>10A TYPICAL FARM IN RYTON</title>
		<content> A typical farm in this area was Eat   
 Farm, Barlow. Mr Philipson's family   
 have owned the farm for 45 years but  
 Mr Philipson has only been running it 
 for about 25 years.                   
 He owns 30 acres of woodland and farms
 226 acres of arable land which is     
 divided up into 20 fields, most of    
 which are given up for rough grazing. 
 80 acres are used for crops such as   
 barley, turnips and potatoes. These   
 are used to help feed the cattle and  
 the suplus is sold.                   
 He has 46 dairy cows which give 200   
 gallons of milk a day. Mr Philipson   
 has 3 people to help him.
