		<content> The{school}is small and was built in  
 the early 20th Century, a newer block 
 added in the 60's. It is backed by a  
 large field. This is used for the     
 Womens Institute show, and on         
 alternate years the Scout's fete and  
 the Church Garden Party. The school   
 itself is a venue for adult evening   
 classes.                              
                                       
 The{Village Hall}offers dance classes 
 for the younger children and discos   
 for the older ones and adult, as well 
 as being a meeting place for the      
 Scouts, Guides, Cubs and Brownies -   
 who have a communal band.             
                                       
 Next to the Village Hall, the{church  
{room}is a meeting place for the Derby 
 and Joan club and flower arranging    
 classes as well as church events, like
 Harvest Supper.                       </content>
