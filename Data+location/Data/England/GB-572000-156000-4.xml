     The longest paddle I have been on 
 so far was from the Club House to the 
{lock.}I passed two rather bashed-up   
 boats but the rest were pretty well   
 looked after. There were two old      
 petrol drums for boats on the river   
 and a small boat shop. Halfway up the 
 river is where it is most green and   
 unpolluted. When I got there I could  
 see a mother duck and about four baby 
 ducks behind her. At the lock I pulled
 myself up and looked over the lock -  
 it was a long way down. Then I paddled
 back. When I passed the{Malta Inn}    
 there were people outside with drinks 
 and they waved at me as I passed.
