		<content> A WALK UP SHARPITOR                   
  The idea of an account of a walk up  
{Sharpitor}was to try and portray the  
 different variations of plant life    
 with height and aspect.               
  The walk began from the main         
 Princetown to Plymouth road(3 miles   
 from Princetown,12 miles from         
 Plymouth)at a height of{1125ft}above  
 sea level.At this height there is     
 bracken growing in abundance and where
 there is no bracken,grass is          
 growing.As one proceeds up the        
 tor,scattered trees are growing and   
 they may provide some rest place for  
 the rooks and crows that were         
 seen. Skylarks and wheatears were seen
 out in the open.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
