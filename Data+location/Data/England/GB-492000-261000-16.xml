		<content>   Although parts of today's churchdate
 back to the l3th century the original 
 building was much older.  There are   
 some Saxon stones which suggest that  
 there might have been a church on the 
 site even before the original Norman  
 building.                             
   The chancel and the font date back  
 to Norman times.  Nothing remains of  
 the Norman nave.  The north doorway   
 dates back to the l3th century,the    
 roof to the l5th century and the main 
 door is Tudor.  Some of the bells were
 cast in the l7th century and some in  
 the l9th century.                     
   Near the chancel arch is a statue of
 Mary holding the infant Jesus.  This  
 is a modern statue carved from a      
 single piece of apple wood.           
   Services are still held regularly.  
 Sometimes we hold our end of term     
 service in the church.                </content>
