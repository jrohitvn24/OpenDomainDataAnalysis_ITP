		<content>   This area has gently rolling        
 relief,though in the western part of  
 the area there is a small valley      
 through which runs a small stream.    
   The area is covered by boulder clay,
 which was deposited in the Ice Age. At
 that time the whole area was covered  
 by a great thickness of ice, carrying 
 with it stones and clay from other    
 areas, which were laid down when the  
 glacier melted.                       
   The soil is mostly a mixture of     
 clay, chalk and flints, though some   
 parts are more sandy, but the soils   
 have been much altered by farmers     
 ploughing and adding fertilizers.     
 Beneath the boulder clay is chalk,    
 which means that the area has good    
 drainage, with rainwater easily       
 sinking into the ground.
