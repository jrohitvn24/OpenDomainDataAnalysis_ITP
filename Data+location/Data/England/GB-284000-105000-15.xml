		<content> One of the three Partners in          
 General Medical Practice,each of whom 
 lives in a  neighbouring village, is  
 always on call. They have built in the
 village,a surgery and dispensary,which
 operates an appointments system 5 days
 a week. For several years before 1976 
 a succesion of{Doctors}working alone  
 lived in the village. Now the         
{Community Nurse/Midwife}does. There is
 an (un-manned){Sewage}Disposal Works, 
 Refuse is collected weekly and a      
 special vehicle sweeps the main       
 streets occasionally. The{Water}Board 
 supplies every house by high pressure 
 mains  and maintains the streams and  
 gullies. In{1905}there were only earth
 closets and refuse was "thrown over   
 the hedge" In{1965}a few houses in the
 main street still shared a communal   
 water tap.
