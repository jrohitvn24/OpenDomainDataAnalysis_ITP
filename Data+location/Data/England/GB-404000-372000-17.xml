		<title>17Buxton:Housing.</title>
		<content> Buxton has a wide variety of different
 types  of houses. There are many large
 Victorian and Edwardian houses built  
 in gritstone, particularly around     
 Corbar and Burbage.                   
 Local Authority housing is            
 concentrated in the newer part of     
 Fairfield to the east of the main road
 to Manchester, where there are        
 bungalows and flats for the elderly as
 well as houses for families.          
 There are several estates of newer    
 owner occupied houses in Burbage and  
 on the road leading south to Harpur   
 Hill.                                 
 As a guide to house prices in the area
 in 1985, a modern three bedroomed     
 bungalow was advertised for Â£45,000.
