		<content> Skirlaugh is in the County of         
 Humberside and in the Borough of South
 Holderness.                           
                                       
 Before counties were re-organised the 
 village was in the East Riding of     
 Yorkshire and many of the residents   
 still regard themselves as Yorkshire  
 folk, not Humbersiders. A considerable
 number still use Yorkshire in their   
 postal address.                       
                                       
 Most of the community ammenities are  
 provided by the County Council and the
 Borough Council but some              
 responsibility rests with a locally   
 elected Parish Council.               
                                       
 Water supply is in the control of the 
 Yorkshire Water Authority. Electricity
 is from the national network. There is
 no mains gas in the village.          </content>
