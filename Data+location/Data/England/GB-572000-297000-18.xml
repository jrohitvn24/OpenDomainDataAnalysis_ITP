		<content> Buses and Coaches  provide a valuable 
 service as only about half the        
 families  own a car. Carters,a private
 coach firm from Foulden,operates a    
 comprehensive service primarily to the
 weekly markets in the local towns.It  
 also links the villages. On Tuesdays, 
 Thursdays and Saturdays there is a    
 return journey to Kings Lynn;on       
 Wednesdays a return journey to Watton;
 on Fridays a return journey to Downham
 Market;on Saturdays additional return 
 journeys to Swaffham and Norwich.No   
 coaches run on Sundays or Mondays.    
 In addition special services are      
 arranged to meet local demands - for  
 example to the annual Sandringham     
 Flower Show and for late night        
 Christmas shopping in Norwich.        
 A daily bus service from Brandon to   
 Downham Market via Northwold is run by
 Eastern Counties Bus Company.         </content>
