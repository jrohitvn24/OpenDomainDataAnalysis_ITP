 by the{Rev.Nicholas Latham}on the site
 where the war memorial now stands. The
{Ladies Fitzpatrick}built a school in  
{Back Lane}while{Lord Lyveden}opened   
 another in the{High Street.}The fees  
 were 2d. a week and 1d. for infants.  
 In 1873 the trustees were asked to    
 exchange the site of the schools for a
 new one the cost being paid by the{   
{Duke of Buccleuch.}All the other      
 schools were closed down. In 1949 it  
 became a Primary School, the older    
 children going to Corby. Extensions   
 were built in 1954. For its centenary 
 celebrations{Princess Alice of        
{Gloucester }was the guest of honour.  
 There are over 100 children in four   
 classes at present. The Parent /      
 Teacher Association raises money for  
 such extras as PE equipment and a     
 music centre.                         </content>
