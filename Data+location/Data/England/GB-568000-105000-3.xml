		<content> PRINCIPAL FEATURES                    
 GEOGRAPHICALLY,THE AREA IS MAINLY     
 MARSH,CULTIVATED GRASSLAND AND        
 RESIDENTIAL AREAS,THE LATTER BEING    
 APPROXIMATELY TWO SQUARE KILOMETRES.  
 MANY PEOPLE RETIRE TO THIS REGION AND 
 SO THERE IS A LARGER PROPORTION OF    
 ELDERLY PEOPLE HERE THAN IS NORMAL.   
 THE HOUSES ARE OFTEN LARGE WITH FOUR  
 OR MORE BEDROOMS,AND SET IN SIZEABLE  
 GARDENS.THEY ARE QUITE EXPENSIVE TO   
 BUY,AND ATTRACT THE WELL-TO-DO:       
 UNFORTUNATELY THEY ALSO ATTRACT       
 BURGLARS,AND THERE IS A FAIRLY HIGH   
 INCIDENCE OF BREAKING AND ENTERING.   
 MANY RESIDENTS OWN THEIR OWN CARS,AND 
 THIS PRECLUDES A VIABLY COMMERCIAL    
 PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM,WHICH         
 NECESSITATES MORE FOLK OWNING THEIR   
 OWN TRANSPORT _A VICIOUS CIRCLE!  IT  
 ALSO MEANS THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO 
 DO SO ARE LIMITED TO THE LOCALITY.    </content>
