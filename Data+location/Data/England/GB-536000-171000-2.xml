		<title>02Our Daily Life</title>
		<content>Our daily life in 1985 is on monday and
until friday every week we are at      
school.  Our school is Catford girls   
school and we have five lessons a day  
 and we are at school   for six hours a
day.  And we go home around about 3,35 
but somtimes we get home work which    
not many people like it.  There is 22  
 people in my class at school.         
sometimes we go out for a day with the 
 school or a week camping with the     
school like l did. My name is Susan Cox
and i think that school is all right   
 but l think that it shouid start at   
 10.00 am not at 8,55 or 9,00.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
