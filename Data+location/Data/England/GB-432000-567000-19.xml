		<content> In 1984, Linskill High and Preston    
 High amalgamated to form John Spence  
 High School.As John Spence is a       
 community school,lots of other people 
 use the building,such as Meals on     
 Wheels and people who want to run     
 clubs like a Toddler Group and many   
 others.If you want to book a hall or a
 classroom you have to ring the deputy 
 head to reserve the room you would    
 like but it must be after school time.
  Again, for a transitional period both
 schools are used.But after 1986 John  
 Spence's LInskill site will be closed 
 and the schools will use the Preston  
 site.There will be a new building     
 there as well as the original school. 
 The Linskill site will then be used   
 for community and a part of North     
 Shields Library will be situated      
 there.
