		<title>09BINGHAM LINEAR PARK</title>
		<content>    You may enjoy the Bingham Linear   
 Park and its country walks from an    
 entrance off the A52 or by way of a   
 zig-zag stepped pathway from the      
 spinney on Tythby Road which is on the
 way from Langar to Bingham.           
    The park follows the route of the  
 former Nottingham to Melton Mowbray   
 railway line. It runs in an easterly  
 direction from the A52 trunk road to  
 the west of the town for a distance of
 2 miles to the River Smite bridge at  
 Whatton.                              
    Most of the disused railway track  
 is now grassed over and planted with  
 shrubs, trees and wild flowers        
 including Lesser Celandines, Daisies, 
 Poppies and Lesser Spearworts. However
 to the east, where walking is less    
 easy, you may follow the original     
 track base to find panoramic views of 
 the local and distant coutryside.     </content>
