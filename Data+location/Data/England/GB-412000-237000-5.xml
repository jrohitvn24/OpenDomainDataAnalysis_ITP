		<content> My brother and I get up at 7a.m.      
 during the week but later at the      
 weekend. We get our own cereal or Mum 
 makes toast or bacon. Then I take the 
 dog for a walk,do piano practice or   
 clean our shoes.  In the week we have 
 lunch at school.At weekends Mum cooks.
 We have roast beef with Yorkshire     
 pudding and sometimes "picnic" lunches
 (cold meat,salad and cheese). Mum     
 tries not to give us too much red meat
 or fat these days. We have a lady to  
 clean the house twice a week because  
 Mum teaches part-time.Dad works in    
 Cheltenham and gets home at seven.Mum 
 shops in Campden for vegetables but   
 other goods are too expensive.We have 
 a dog called Humphrey who is great    
 company. He gives us plenty to do like
 closing the door after him or bathing 
 him when he has rolled in something.  
 The family like hiking and travel.    </content>
