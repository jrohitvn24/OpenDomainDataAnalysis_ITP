		<content> At 08.00 I get up, go into the kitchen
 and have breakfast. I get dressed and 
 wash,pack my bag and go to call for my
 friend. We walk to school. At 08.55 we
 go in for the register and have       
 assembly_ usually a story, hymms and  
 prayers. We spend the day working at  
 maths, written work, art, games, music
 etc. We have one playtime in the      
 morning when we can buy crisps and one
 in the afternoon. I take sandwiches to
 eat at lunchtime and then play on the 
 field. We finish school at 15.40. When
 I get home I have a snack, watch TV   
 and make part of a plastic model. At  
 18.30 I have my tea, get changed into 
 my uniform and go to Sea Scouts. We   
 play games like tunnel tick and do    
 some badgework until 21.00. Most of us
 stay until 21.30 and play pool table  
 tennis and badminton. When I get home 
 I watch TV and go to bed at 22.30.    </content>
