		<content> The ecoloy of the plateau area to the 
east is greatly affected by the        
agriculteral techniques used.The       
habitat is virtually all the same &amp; the
number of bird species is lower than in
the western wooded valleys.A few small 
sheltered spring valleys were found    
where most of the species were to be   
seen.Birds seen included kestrel little
owl,partridge,pheasant,yellow hammer   
stock dove tree sparrow skylark linnet 
swallow &amp; jackdaw.The lack of wildlife 
in this area is probable not only due  
to farming techniques but also to the  
natural barren habiwat &amp; nature of the 
plateau,particularly in winter.        
Ornithologically this is shown by the  
number of birds which nest either on   
the ground or low down in hedges such  
as linnet yellow hammer partridge &amp; sky
lark from the list above.
