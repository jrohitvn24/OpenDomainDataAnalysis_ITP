		<content>  Near{Box Hill}there are two cafes.   
 One is Rykas at the bottom of the hill
 near the dual-carriageway on the      
 London Road. It serves{motor-cyclists,
{lorry drivers and coach parties}during
 the week and walkers and cyclists at  
 the weekend. Eight people work there  
 and the most popular food is a{burger.
 Cindy Richards who owns Rykas was not 
 very talkative.                       
   At the top of the hill near the     
 look-out point is the Zig Zag         
 cafe-Restaurant. Many{old people}come 
 to the cafe on drives or Old Folks    
 outing. They enjoy{tea,coffee and     
{biscuits and ice-creams}. Sometimes   
 Famous people come when T.V.          
 advertisements are made. Different    
 clubs often use the restaurant        
 section. The{busiest time for both}   
{cafes is in summer and at weekends.   
 Matthew,the owner,gave us ice-creams. </content>
