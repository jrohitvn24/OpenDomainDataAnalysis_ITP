		<title>12Warmingham Craft Workshop</title>
		<content> The Craft Workshop is a converted mill
 in the centre of the village.Although 
 records show the existence of a mill  
 in 1289 only parts dating to 1780 are 
 left.Olive stones and coconut shells  
 for filler in the plastics industry   
 were ground in modern times until the 
 slump in 1978.In 1979 the workshops   
 and gallery  opened in the early days 
 of a trend towards smaller units and  
 traditional crafts. The workshops are 
 used by self employed crafts people   
 such as potters,knitters,artists,farri
 -ers and a silver smith.The{public gal
{-lery}displays resident craftware as  
 well as other craft goods.Light refre-
 shments can be obtained in the gallery
 and a short stay tent and caravan fiel
 -d is opposite the mill.{The Aeroplane
{Collection,in}1962 the first voluntary
 preservation group in the country,re- 
 builds and displays old aircraft.     </content>
