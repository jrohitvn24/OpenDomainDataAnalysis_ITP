		<content> C.H.Binder is an agricultural industry
 whose main business is working with   
 topsoil.They collect the soil from    
 local farms taking the top 2 inches of
 soil from the grass fields.The soil is
 transported back to C.H.Binder by     
 lorry where it is stored in heaps.Then
 it is sifted or screened and perhaps  
 sterilised according to the customers 
 requirement.Sometimes special mixtures
 such as sand and peat are required.The
 finished product is then transported  
 by lorry to its final destination     
 which could be football pitches,      
 cricket tables,golf courses and       
 bowling greens.Lords and the Oval have
 contracts with C.H.Binder.They employ 
 ten people.If all the lorries are in  
 use,C.H.Binder use other contractors  
 for transporting the soil.The lorries 
 they have include a 20 ton 8-wheel    
 lorry and a 15 ton 6-wheel lorry.     </content>
