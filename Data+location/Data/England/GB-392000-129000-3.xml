 tank of water and combing or running a
 metal stick up and down through the   
 paint and then laying a piece of paper
 on top to transfer the design on to   
 it.{Solveig Stone}started marbling    
 because her husband{Humphrey}designs  
 books and she became interested in the
 end papers of the books which were    
 often marbled, and she wanted to know 
 how to do it. Lots of things are      
 marbled from address books, note pads,
 lamp shades to gift wrapping paper.   
 She has done this craft for thirteen  
 years.                                
  {Johnny Goodall}was born in 1908 and 
 trained to be an{artist.}He uses water
