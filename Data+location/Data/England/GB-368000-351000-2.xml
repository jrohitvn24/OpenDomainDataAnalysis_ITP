		<title>02FAMILY LIFE IN THE 1980s</title>
		<content> Families lead increasingly busy lives 
 in 1985 and the increase in working   
 mothers has meant a fundamental change
 in the activities of some families.   
 There is evidence that two- and       
 three-child families are most popular.
 There is also a growing proportion of 
 split-parent families. Children are   
 involved in various hobbies and       
 activities in the evenings; Girl      
 Guides, Scouts, Cubs and Brownies are 
 always popular. Badminton, Judo,      
 Karate, Football, Cricket, Dancing,   
 Gymnastics, Swimming and Lifesaving   
 Take place at Baths and Sports Centres
 in Crewe and Nantwich. The main form  
 of entertainment in the house is      
 television; computer activities and   
 listening to music are also popular.  
 The reading of books, and playing of  
 card and board games are less popular.
