		<title>11FARM DIARY: MILK QUOTA</title>
		<content> Note: Because of overproduction of    
 milk, the European Economic Community 
 introduced Milk Quotas. Each dairy    
 farmer had to apply for a quota of    
 milk he might produce in a year. These
 extracts reflect the concern felt by  
 the farmer at Gaitsgill Farm.         
                                       
 17 October                            
   At the auction Dad bought three     
 second calf cows. These will go with  
 the bull in November and will calve in
 August. If no milk quota is allocated 
 then they will be sold new calved in  
 August.                               
 29 January                            
   Dad has been to a tribunal to put   
 our case forward for a milk quota.    
 18 February                           
   We heard this morning that our case 
 for a milk quota has been turned down.
 We will have to see what happens now. </content>
