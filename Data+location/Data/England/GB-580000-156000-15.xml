		<title>15COBHAM MANOR RIDING CENTRE</title>
		<content> The stables have been owned since 1984
 by the Brumer family. The school is   
 open every day except Monday. The     
 busiest time is at the weekend. An    
 adult class lesson costs Â£6 per hour  
 or Â£6 for a half hour private lesson. 
 A child's class lesson is Â£4.50. There
 are more than 50 horses, some owned   
 and some liveried, cared for by 13    
 staff, 8 working pupils and 2 grooms. 
 Riders range from beginners of 2 to   
 elderly people. There are horses worth
 Â£4000 and Shetland ponies worth Â£50.  
 The horses are shod about every 5     
 weeks by the farrier Keith Barker who 
 lives locally. Tuition takes place at 
 the school and there are hacks to the 
 nearby Downs, picnic rides to         
 Harrietsham and summer 'pub' rides to 
 Hucking and Hollingbourne.
