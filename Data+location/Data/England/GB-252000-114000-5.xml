		<title>05BEAFORD; A WEEKEND ACTIVITY</title>
		<content>   Most weekends we go scrambling,     
 which is a motor-bicycle sport.  It is
 a fast moving sport.  The course is   
 mud or dust, with jumps and hills.    
   On Sunday 9th. June, 1985, Dad and I
 went to a scramble at Doddiscombleigh,
 near Exeter.  The course was rough and
 dusty, with a stream running through  
 the track that made it a bit boggy.   
 There was a very steep hill and some  
 riders fell off.                      
   Children take part in this sport,   
 using suitably powered bikes, and are 
 grouped by age:- 5 to 7 years; 8 to   
 10; 11 to 13; 14 to 15; and 16 to 17. 
 Winners of races receive a trophy.    
   When you are old enough you can     
 enter the men's motor-bike races.  A  
 brand new motor-bike, with a 500 c.c. 
 engine, would cost about Â£1500.
