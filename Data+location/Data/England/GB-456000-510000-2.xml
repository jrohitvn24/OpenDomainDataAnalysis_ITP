		<content> In the domesday block there is the    
 village of Great Ayton in which there 
 are three estates_{Linden,Rosehill}and
{Roseberry.}The most popular styles are
 detached and semi-detached. Most of   
 the houses are private. Many of the   
 houses were built in the 1970's. A lot
 of the houses are built of brick and a
 few are built of stone. The common    
 size is eight to eleven rooms. Most   
 private houses have a garage. The     
 average cost of a detached house is   
{Â£45,000.}There was a great leap in the
 housing industry from 1860 because    
{Roseberry Topping}was found to have   
 loads of{iron ore}in it. Part of Great
 Ayton was then named{California       
 because people came to the area for   
 jobs, the same as with the California 
  gold rush. In Great Ayton we have    
 one mansion called Cleveland Lodge.   
  It is now owned by the {Fry family.  </content>
