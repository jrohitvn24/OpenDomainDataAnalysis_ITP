 UP TO 1972 ALL THE TRAFFIC ON THE MAIN
 A604 ROAD FROM HARWICH TO COLCHESTER  
 PASSED THROUGH THE NARROW VILLAGE     
 STREET OF WIX. HOUSES WERE BEING      
 DAMAGED BY VIBRATIONS,CHILDREN WERE   
 AFRAID TO CYCLE AND OLDER PEDESTRIANS 
 WERE VERY NERVOUS OF WALKING BECAUSE  
 OF THE HEAVY TRAFFIC.A NEW BY_PASS    
 WAS OPENED IN 1973.SINCE THEN THE     
 VOLUME OF TRAFFIC HAS INCREASED EVEN  
 MORE.THE BUSIEST TIMES ARE IN SUMMER  
 WITH TOURISTS USING THE FERRIES TO    
 HOLLAND,DENMARK,GERMANY AND SWEDEN.THE
 BUSIEST TIMES OF DAY ARE JUST BEFORE  
 THE FERRIES DEPART AND JUST BEFORE    
 THEY ARRIVE.WE CARRIED OUT A SURVEY OF
 TRAFFIC PASSING BY DURING ONE         
 HOUR,FROM1-30pm TO 2-30pm ON THURSDAY 
 MAY  16TH 1985.THESE WERE OUR RESULTS:
 LORRIES:96 CARS:230 VANS:50 MOTOR     
 CYCLES :7 COACHES :1                  </content>
