		<title>03 KINGSWEAR COMMUNITY WEEK</title>
		<content> In Kingswear there is a special week  
 every year in May that is called      
 Community Friendship Week.There are   
 no cinemas or other entertainments in 
  Kingswear so once a year a series of 
 events is organized so that people can
 come out and enjoy themselves .Any    
 money that is collected is used in the
 village.One thing that the money has  
 been used for was a playing field for 
 the school and the community.         
  Constable Carthy the community       
 constable of Kingswear has organized  
 Community Week since 1981.            
  Some events are: a crab fishing      
 contest,a car treasure hunt,a         
 sponsored walk and a coin trail.      
  The first Community Week raised Â£2000
 and in 1985 it raised Â£1400.
