		<title>18BENENDEN WEALD, FIREPLACE.</title>
		<content> Four Wents House centres round its    
 large inglenook fireplace, which has  
 recently been rescued from layers of  
 red paint to show its fine brickwork, 
 with two unusual pairs of steps behind
 the fire. On the left is a shallow    
 cupboard and a small arched recess,   
 possibly for salt and spices. The     
 right corner has the old bread oven   
 which partly remains linking through  
 to the kitchen, its iron door and some
 tools still guarding it. Above the    
 main beam are two small nooks occupied
 by vases partly hidden by the festoons
 of hops. The fire now sits on a modern
 brick floor but these bricks tone well
 with the old ones and the whole room  
 is pervaded by the lovely scent of    
 wood ash. A metal canopy enables the  
 fire to heat the sitting room and much
 of the house very effectively.
