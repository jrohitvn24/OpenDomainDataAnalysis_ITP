 The old chapel at Finedon Hall has    
been converted into a home.We          
interviewed one of the people who live 
there.She said that when work started, 
the chapel was just a shell,with more  
nests in than the trees outside.There  
was no drainage,water,electricity or   
even a fireplace.It was only after     
looking at many drawings that they     
finally decided what to do.            
 One of the reasons they love their    
home is the carved blackbirds and      
leaves on the old ironstone columns at 
the front.                             
 Their garden is the old kitchen garden
of the Hall and the soil is very rich  
as much of it was carted in from the   
fens by the Squires of Finedon.        
 They hope that the rest of the Hall   
will be turned into flats as they would
like some neighbours.                  </content>
