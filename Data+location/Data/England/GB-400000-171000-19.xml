		<title>19  LOCAL NEWS - CALNE</title>
		<content> In the centre of Calne there was a    
 huge factory called "Harrises".They   
 made pork pies and sausages and things
 like that.One day they decided to stop
 people working there and to demolish  
 it.Whatever the reason was I still    
 disagree because it employed lots of  
 people and they had to find another   
 job and some did not succeed.Then the 
 time came to knock it down. I suppose 
 it is a good idea because it took up  
 so much room. Knocking it down is     
 dangerous, there is a lot of rubble   
 and dust. Large trucks take the rubble
 away.One day a large bit fell on the  
 main road and the crane had to come   
 and clear it.It only just missed a    
 car.What is going to take its         
 place?The Council have asked the      
 people of Calne for help and have made
 a competition to design the area that 
 will be cleared.                      </content>
