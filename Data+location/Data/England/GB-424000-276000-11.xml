		<title>11CHANGING TILE HILL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The main change in Tile Hill Village  
 in recent years has been the building 
 of Tanyard Farm Estate. Tanyard Farm  
 used to be a large, successful farm   
 run by two elderly ladies. One old    
 lady was attacked in the farmhouse and
 the farm was subsequently sold. About 
 6 or 7 years ago the farm was         
 demolished and a modern housing estate
 built. There has never been a chemist 
 shop in Tile Hill Village despite     
 demands from population but the       
 building of the estate also brought   
 the opening of a chemist shop. There  
 used to be a Mission Hall instead of a
 church and a small cafeteria where    
 people met after the Mission Hall     
 services. However, the Mission Hall no
 longer exists and the cafeteria has   
 now closed down. On the site of the   
 old Westwood Church vicarage there now
 exists Leigh Church of England School.</content>
