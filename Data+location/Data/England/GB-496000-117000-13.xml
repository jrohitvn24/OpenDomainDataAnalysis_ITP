		<title>13 - FARMING</title>
		<content> Farming in the area is mainly mixed.  
 There are water meadows near the      
 river Rother, liable to flooding, and 
 used only for rough grazing.          
 The higher land supports cereals,     
 potatoes, oilseed rape and maize.     
 Several smaller fields have been made 
 into larger ones so that the farmer   
 can fully utilise the modern          
 machinery, thus saving time and       
 manpower.                             
 Common Market support policies are    
 making it more profitable to grow     
 cereal crops than to produce milk and 
 beef. Despite this, there are still   
 two or three large dairy herds in the 
 area.                                 
 Pigs and sheep are present in the area
 but not in large commercial numbers.  
 There is a small market garden at     
 Burton Common.                        
                                       </content>
