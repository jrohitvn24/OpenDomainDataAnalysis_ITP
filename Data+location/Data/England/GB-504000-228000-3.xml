 Locally, the Clappers provide a       
 popular walking and picnic area which 
 is easily accessible by road. Recently
 more young beech trees have been      
 planted near the entrance, in the     
 picnic area. By following the path    
 around the top of the hill, a quite   
 outstanding view of the surrounding   
 countryside is obtained. Skylarks can 
 often be seen and heard flying over   
 the farmland neary. In the area       
 parsley piert, white mustard and      
 ploughman's spikehard can be found, as
 well as the sighting of many wall     
 butterflies. On the exposed sides of  
 the hill it can be very windy and when
 the wind is in a particular direction,
 experienced members of the Dustable   
 Hang-gliding Club, have special       
 permission to use the Clappers for    
 gliding.                              </content>
