		<title>17WEST FELTON ECOLOGY</title>
		<content>  THE AREA IS GENTLY UNDULATING AND    
 CONSISTS MAINLY OF FARM LAND ,WITH A  
 SMALL STRETCH OF WOODLAND BY THE      
 PRADOE ESTATE AND ROUND A DILAPIDATED 
 MANSION CALLED THE NURSERY.THE LAND IS
 GENERALLY WELL KEPT AND CAREFULLY     
 FARMED WITH VERY FEW PATCHES OF WASTE 
 LAND IN THE AREA.                     
   THE WEATHER TENDS TO HAVE A VERY    
 LOCAL PATTERN,OFTEN DIFFERING GREATLY 
 FROM THAT OF OSWESTRY,ONLY 5 MILES    
 AWAY,AND THE ELLESMERE AREA JUST TO   
 THE NORTH.USUALLY THE WEATHER IS NOT  
 SO SEVERE IN THIS AREA,AND THE SNOW   
 LEVEL APPRECIABLY LESS THAN THAT OF   
 OSWESTRY.                             
   THERE ARE MANY FOOTPATHS AROUND WEST
 FELTON,MANY LEADING TO THE CANAL,BUT  
 ONE LEADS FROM THE VILLAGE CENTRE TO  
 THE NOW-CLOSED RAILWAY STATION.MOST   
 ARE MARKED WITH YELLOW ARROWS AND     
 WOODEN SIGNPOSTS.                     </content>
