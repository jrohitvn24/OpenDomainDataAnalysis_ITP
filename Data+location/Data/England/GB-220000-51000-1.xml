		<content> The Looe Area is in South East        
 Cornwall.The coast  and countryside   
 are very attractive.In Spring,the     
 roadsides and woods are full of       
 primroses,bluebells and campion.The   
 coast is rocky with sandy coves.The   
 farms are mostly under grass for      
 grazing or hay,but corn and potatoes  
 are also grown.There are many holiday 
 caravans,camp sites,hotels and guest  
 houses.Looe itself lies on a tidal    
 estuary which divides it in two,with a
 bridge between.                       
 The area contains some historic       
 buildings,including Looe's Old        
 Guildhall,Trelawne Manor,St.Nicholas's
 and Talland churches,and there is the 
 site of a Celtic Monastery near       
 Hannafore.
