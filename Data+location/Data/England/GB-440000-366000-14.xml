		<title>14TEMPLE NORMANTON'S OLD FOLK.</title>
		<content> Temple Normanton is a small village   
 with no shops, doctor or church and an
 infrequent bus service.               
 Despite the lack of amenities most of 
 the elderly residents live contented  
 lives. This is mainly due to the help 
 given by caring families and friends. 
 The accommodation is controlled by a  
 warden who ensures that medical help  
 is promptly given in emergencies.     
 A mobile shop calls weekly but most   
 old people rely on families to shop   
 for them and collect their pensions   
 from nearby Hasland.                  
 Organised social activities are       
 restricted to a Senior Citizens' Club 
 offering bingo, snooker and outings.  
 They are also invited to school       
 concerts but many elderly people rely 
 on television and visits from family  
 and friends for entertainment.
