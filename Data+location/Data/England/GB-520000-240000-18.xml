		<title>18ST.NICHOLAS CHURCH HINXWORTH</title>
		<content>{The Church}in Hinxworth,dedicated to  
 St.Nicholas has stood for nearly 700  
 years; and it almost certainly        
 occupies the site of an earlier       
 church.No priest is mentioned in the  
 Domesday Book but rectors were        
 presented by the lords of the manor of
 Cantelupe early in the 13th century.  
 Through the centuries the villagers   
 have tended it and handed it down as a
 place of peace and hope. We still use 
 it today as they did of old. The      
 church is not often crowded but it is 
 well supported and has a thriving     
 Sunday School. We are ecumenical in   
 outlook - Christians of other denomin-
 ations joining in the work and worship
 of the Church.Fundraising by the      
 Friends of St.Nicholas help with the  
 cost of church repairs, the latest    
 venture was a community quilt raffled 
 to raise money to refurbish the bells.</content>
