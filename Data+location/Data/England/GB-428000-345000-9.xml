		<content>      Mr.Holbrook runs the Post Office.
 When he was a  small  boy,  he went to
 Turnditch  School.  His  parents  went
 there as well.He showed us the stamps.
 They start at 1p and go up to Â£5.Where
 the Post Office is now  used to be  an
 office for a haulage firm. The lorries
 used to park at the back.             
                                       
                                       
      The Post Office has been  in that
 particular place for 13 years.  Before
 that,it was across the road. Monday is
 the  quietest  day  and  Thursday  the
 busiest. There  was a  Post Office  in
 Windley until recently.If there wasn't
 a Post Office here, people would  have
 to go another two miles to Idridgehay.
