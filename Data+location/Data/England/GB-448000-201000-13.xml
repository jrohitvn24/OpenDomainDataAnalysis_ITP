   When our lunch break is over we come
back into school to continue our       
lessons. We have a wide range of       
activities including painting and      
pottery and work with our computer. We 
have study topics including history and
geography. During the summer months we 
practice country dancing outside, our  
favourite dances are Circassian Circle 
and Bridge of Athlone. We go by coach  
to Hinksey Pool near Oxford for        
swimming instruction during the summer 
term, we are awarded certificates      
showing the distance we can swim. I won
a certificate for swimming 20 metres   
this year. School ends at 3 p.m. and I 
cycle home.
