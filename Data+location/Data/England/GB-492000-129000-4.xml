  We live in a village in the country  
 with shops and houses.Most of the     
 children spend their time in school or
 playing.                              
  Most of us live in old quiet places  
 away fron all tha noise where it is   
 peace and quiet with not too many cars
 about.                                
  In the woods and by the fields there 
 are public footpaths.                 
  The farms are peaceful and quiet.    
  We travel in cars and buses and we   
 travel by bicycle and most of all by  
 feet.
