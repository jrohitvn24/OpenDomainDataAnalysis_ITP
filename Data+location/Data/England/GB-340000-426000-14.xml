		<title>14A SCHOOLTEACHER'S DAY</title>
		<content> I arrive for work at 8.30. Along with 
 several hundred other drivers I slowly
 make my way down the Lytham Road. All 
 the other drivers turn in to British  
 Aerospace, but I join my colleagues at
 Holy Family School. Our playground    
 runs parallel with the British        
 Aerospace runway; only a couple of    
 rows of houses separate us. This      
 morning while we were busy working,   
 the Crown Prince of Saudia Arabia and 
 Mr Norman Tebbit (Conservative MP)    
 were signing a multi-million pound    
 contract for the Tornado aeroplane.   
 This ensures thousands of jobs until  
 the end of the century and many of our
 parents will be relieved. The Red     
 Arrows, the Royal Air Force's         
 formation air team, are giving a      
 display to clebrate this contract.It  
 is phenomenal. Ribbons of blue and red
 smode thread their way across the sky.</content>
