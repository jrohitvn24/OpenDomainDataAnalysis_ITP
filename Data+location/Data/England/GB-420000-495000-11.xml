		<content> Residents free time intrests cover a  
 great variety of sport etcetera. Golf 
 is popular with both men and women as 
 is cycling. The ladies enjoy swimming,
 yoga, aerobics, keep fit, tennis,     
 badminton, and dancing. The men       
 participate in cricket, football,     
 rugby, squash, quoits, shooting,      
 hunting and jogging. Many of these    
 sports are popular with children as   
 are riding, gymnastics and ballet     
 dancing. Those who like to live life  
 at a slower pace enjoy bird-watching  
 or walking along the river Swale,     
 across fields and through woods or    
 standing watching the horse racing at 
 Catterick race course. Gardening is a 
 most popular past-time and this is    
 reflected in the riot of colour seen  
 in gardens during the summer months   
 and much appreciated by tourists.
