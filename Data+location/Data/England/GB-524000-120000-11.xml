		<title>11School Then and Now.</title>
		<content> we looked at the old log books &amp; found
 that children were often away with    
 scarlet fever, whooping cough or      
 measles or were kept at home to help  
 with harvesting, bird-scaring or stone
 picking. In 1894 one boy actually died
 at school but we do not know why.     
 NOW we come in at 9.am. after playing 
 in the yard. We  have the register and
 then Assembly, which is usually about 
 something like picking rubbish up or  
 the Ethiopian famine. Then we go to   
 our classes. We do maths. I am doing  
 grouping in 4's and 5's with unifix   
 cubes. We write stories or do         
 spellings and we do science. We did   
 some experiments about which soil grew
 seeds best and which holds most water.
 At play we go in the yard or the back 
 garden. There are trees and bushes to 
 play around and I like the climbing   
 frame. It is good fun.                </content>
