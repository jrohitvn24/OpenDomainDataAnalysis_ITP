		<title>05When we surveyed Peacehaven</title>

  Our group was taken to Peacehaven in 
the school mini-bus so we could        
interview people for our Domesday      
Project.                               
  We were given some duplicated        
questions so we would know what to     
ask. We did not find many people as    
most of them were at work. Some of us  
hid and let our partners go up and ask 
the questions because we were shy.     
  Not every one answered our questions 
(some gave excuses why they couldn't   
answer, some were quite rude to us and 
two of us were chased by a dog).       
  One man, working in his garden, said 
he thought the Domesday book was King  
Canute's idea! But most people were    
helpful and answered our questions.    
  When we finished interviewing we went
back to school and were late for       
dinner.                                </content>
