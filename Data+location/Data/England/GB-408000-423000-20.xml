		<content>  At{HALIFAX STATION}there used to be 4
 full platforms and a bay platform but 
 only 2 are used now.Halifax's goods   
 yard could have taken some of the     
 biggest freight trains used today.It  
 is now a carpark.The first passenger  
 service in Calderdale was opened in   
 1842 from Manchester to Leeds.It went 
 through Normanton,so passengers       
 wishing to go to Halifax had to       
 disembark at Sowerby Bridge.The line  
 as it is now was completed in 1854.   
 From Sowerby Bridge it goes through   
 Halifax and Bradford.Many of the lines
 were closed down in the 1950's.The    
 only passanger service still in use is
 the Manchester to Leeds via Halifax.
