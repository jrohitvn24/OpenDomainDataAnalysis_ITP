		<title>06Charlotte Street Market</title>
		<content>   Although more recently named after  
 George III's wife, it{dates from 1184,
 when Richard I gave a grant for a     
 market in Old Portsmouth.{From c.1750,
 this street has been the market place 
 It is now overshadowed by a concrete  
 car park, which adds to the untidy    
 appearance already created by crushed 
 boxes and vegetables. The market has  
 an average of{60 stalls,}of which most
 are wooden carts.                     
   The market days are{Tuesday,Thursday
 and{Saturday,}when shoppers can buy   
{meat, fruit and vegetables}etc. The   
 market is a profitable business: the  
 costs per site are Â£3.00 for the set  
 market days and Â£1.10 for any extra   
 days. The most important and costly   
 problem is keeping the street clean.
