		<content>{West Devon and North Cornwall Farmers 
  (W.D.N.C.F.) was formed in 1919 by   
 a group of local farmers at Holsworthy
 to supply agricultural needs to the   
 area.By 1965 (W.D.N.C.F.) had expanded
 to cover the whole West Devon,North   
 Cornwall area with eight offices in   
 different towns.                      
 The head office is in Holsworthy      
 employing 110 people plus 2 persons on
 the Youth Training Scheme. The        
 qualifications needed range from a    
 sales diploma to two O Levels.        
 Since 1979 the company accounts has   
 been fully computerised for speed and 
 efficiency. 95% of (W.D.N.C.F.) animal
 feed is produced at Holsworthy and    
 Launceston in their own mills,90      
 tonnes a day is produced.In 1984 the  
 company had a loss due to milk quotas 
 because farmers were not buying as    
 much animal feed.                     </content>
