		<title>16EDUCATION:LIFE AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The bell goes at 3.30.and we all      
 go home.I watch T.V.and have tea.Then 
 I go sailing .It is really good.I     
 go in a GP 14 which is a big boat for 
 four or less people .I go home and    
 then I go to bed .                    
     We are having a new school built  
 at the moment.Part of the new school  
 was built about 4 years ago and this  
 is now being extended.The builders are
 a firm called John Cox from Rotheram. 
 It is very messy around the school at 
 the moment as well as noisy.          
   When the school is finished we shall
 have a hall for P.E., a kitchen,which 
 will cook our dinners instead of them 
 coming by van from Buuxton,changing   
 rooms, a conservatory,2 classroom     
 areas, 4 homebays and a traditional   
 classroom.When the new school is ready
 in November the old school will close.
