		<content> We play games like football where you 
 kick and pass the ball to your team.  
 There are 11 team members and the aim 
 is to score goals. If you get into the
 top Divisions you might go to play at 
 wembly and win a cup.                 
   We also play cricket. One man has a 
 bat and he has to hit the ball which  
 the bowler throws at the wicket       
 (stump)                               
   In some people's leisure time they  
 like to read books, walk in the park, 
 swim or ride their bikes. In our      
 leisure time we do things we would not
 do normally                           
   For our entertainment we enjoy      
 dancing, listening to the radio and   
 playing records, watching television  
 and sports games. We also play board  
 games such monopoly, cluedo and       
 scrabble, and games on paper like     
 hangman and noughts and crosses.      </content>
