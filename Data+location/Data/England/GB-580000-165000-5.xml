		<content>In Rainham there are 3 types of        
employment in three main catagories:   
London commuting,those employed in the 
Rainham area and those employed in     
the surrounding towns.                 
   The local employment can be split   
into the {service industry},including  
shopworkers estate agents,banks, and   
building societies, those linked with  
the transport network in the           
surrounding urban areas and a few      
remaining agricultural workers.Rainham 
has a lack of{manufacturing industries}
with only one brickworks and some light
engineering.  Because of this lack     
of industry  in the area unemploymnet  
is about 13%.                          
   Most of those concerned  with       
various occupations live in the SW of  
the area whereas a strip along the N   
and NE is almost entirely agricultural.
