  The Bowling green is a great         
 attraction to holiday makers in the   
 summer, being surrounded by seats     
 spectators can sit at their leisure   
 and watch the bowlers in action. There
 is also a club house attached to the  
 bowling green. A small park near the  
 Manor provides entertainment for      
 children with the usual slides and    
 swings. The{Annual Flower Show}held in
 a Marquee on the lawn gives ample     
 opportunity for everyone to display   
 their talents. There are competitive  
 classes for a variety of hobbies, lace
 making, cooking preserves, dressmaking
 to name a few. There is a very active 
  Womens Institute and also a Towns    
 womens Guild.
