		<title>05EMPLOYMENT IN BROMYARD</title>
		<content>    In the{Bromyard}area there is more 
{unemployment}than there should be, but
 the problem is not as bad as it is    
 elsewhere.                            
    During the last twenty years the   
 main types of employment have changed.
 In 1966, 50% of  the school leavers   
 found jobs in{agriculture.}Now most   
 leavers find employment in            
{local service}and{manufacturing       
{industries.}Nevertheless a            
 considerable number still find work   
 in agriculture. As there is so much   
 agriculture in the area there is much 
 seasonal employment such as{strawberry
 and{hop-picking.                      
    Over half the 16-year olds from the
 Queen Elizabeth High School in        
 Bromyard go on to{further education;  
 either in Hereford or Worcester. Of   
 the other half, only six were left    
 without employment in 1984.           </content>
