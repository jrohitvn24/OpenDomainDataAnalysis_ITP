		<title>19HEALTH IN SHALBOURNE AREA</title>
		<content> It is important that people in this   
 area are reasonably healthy as there  
 are{no}practising{doctors or dentists 
 living in it.  There is no chemist's  
 shop. Great Bedwyn 2 miles away has 1 
 doctor, Hungerford 4 miles away has a 
 practice with 3 doctors, all treating 
 patients in this area, but for all    
 minor ailments people must go to town.
 With only a limited bus service, to   
 visit the surgery or collect a pre-   
 scription those without a car have to 
 rely on help. The nearest Maternity   
 facility is{Savernake Hospital}backed 
 up by{Princess Margaret Hospital}in   
 Swindon. Any form of health visiting  
 has to be arranged through the local  
 practices. There is a{Meals-on-Wheels 
 service but at present only one old   
 lady of nearly 100 takes it.{Church,  
{Good Companions and the shop watch    
{over the wellbeing of the elderly.    </content>
