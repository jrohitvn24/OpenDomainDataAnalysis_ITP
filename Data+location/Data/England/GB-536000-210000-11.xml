 The{LANDSCAPE}of the area is flat     
 except for a small portion which      
 slopes down to the New River canal.   
 Woodland is sparse and there are      
 scattered trees along the roads &amp; near
 habitations.{FARMING}occupies much of 
 the square. A single private field,   
 planted with barley, is leased.       
 Hillside Nurseries, a small market-   
 gardening enterprise is situated near 
 this field and consists of nine       
 glasshouses in which tomatoes,        
 cucumbers and lettuces are grown. One 
 part-time &amp; two full-time workers are 
 employed to supply Covent Garden and  
 Spitalfields markets. Bordering on    
 these nurseries, there is enclosed    
 rough grazing supporting a herd of    
 Friesian cows.
