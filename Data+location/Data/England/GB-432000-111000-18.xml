		<content>{Do you think Totton has changed for   
{better or worse?                      
 Shops have disappeared,especially     
 butchers shops.Rumbridge Street used  
 to have shops on both sides but now   
 most of them have gone.The Asda       
 Superstore has changed Totton a lot   
 and many houses in the centre have    
 been demolished.                      
{Do you think the Asda Superstore is a 
{help to the community?                
 It helps a lot of people but not the  
 shops.                                
{Do you agree with the new housing     
{developments?                         
 Yes,the houses are slightly smaller,  
 but they are not an eyesore, besides  
 there are so many homeless people.    
{Do you think Totton could improve?    
 No,I like it here,and so do most      
 people.Totton is a semi_rural         
 village/town with good amenities.     </content>
