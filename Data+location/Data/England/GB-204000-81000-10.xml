		<title>10POPULATION OF DELABOLE</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
        Delabole  is  a  Cornish slate-
 quarrying village  with  a  population
 of 1,100 people. A recent survey of   
 the village showed that there were as 
 many old-age pensioners in the village
 as there are school children. There   
 are two main reasons for this: many of
 the young people move out of Delabole 
 to find jobs and many of the old      
 people moved to Delabole when they    
 retired.                              
    Apart from this the population is a
 stable one.Out of 72 children who     
 completed a survey 53 have lived in   
 Delabole all their lives .Most of     
 these are Cornish children and many   
 have parents born &amp; bred in Delabole.
