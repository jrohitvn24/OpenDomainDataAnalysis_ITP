		<title>02     WHITLEY BAY (2)</title>
		<content>(4)RESIDENTIAL.A wide range of styles  
and quality of housing can be found.   
  Whitley Bay was founded by a group of
Anglian settlers around the year AD625.
The name WHITLEY means Blanch or White 
Lea or Land,that is dry open Pasture.  
The first recorded mention of W.Bay was
in 11OO when HENRY 1 conferred it on   
the local PRIORY at TYNEMOUTH.Up to the
17th century the towns growth was slow 
and based on AGRICULTURE.From 1665-188O
its growth was bound up with MINING    
mainly COAL.The population of the town 
has grown steadily over the last 2OOyrs
18OO-256 1881-2112 19OO-77O5 197O-37OOO
The opening of the NORTH TYNESIDE RAIL-
WAY stimulated the towns popularity.   
Since 188O W.BAY has been essentially a
RESIDENTIAL AREA for commercial and    
industrial workers and a HOLIDAY RESORT
for tourists from Scotland and day     
trippers from the Tyneside Conurbation.</content>
