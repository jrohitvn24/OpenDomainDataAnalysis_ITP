		<content> The firing range close to Market      
 Lavington ,Easterton and West         
 Lavington is called Lavington         
 Hill and is part of{Salisbury         
{Plain.}When the red flag is flying    
 you are not allowed up there,but      
 when it is down you can go up there   
 for walks as long as you walk only    
 on the tracks.As it is a firing       
 range you can often hear them,the     
 noise is mostly made by the Artillery 
 firing their guns.It is most noisy    
 when they are on exercise.You can     
 often see bright lights going up in   
 the air with smoke trailing,these are 
  called flares,but they do not make   
 any noise.Often there are lots of     
 helicopters flying around,but you get 
 used to them after a while.We quite   
 like it in Market Lavington with the  
 Army.
