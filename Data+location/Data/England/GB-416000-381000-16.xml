		<title>16FAMILY LIFE (CONT'D)</title>
		<content> Rachel goes off to Bradwell Junior    
 School and Mark and I head for Hope   
 Valley College.  Stuart will have been
 slaving away as transport foreman at  
 Laporte Industries (Eyam) for at least
 half an hour.  At approximately 5pm we
 are together again as a family and we 
 have our evening meal.  This can be a 
 lively affair with both children      
 demanding "our time" together, and    
 both of them insisting that they have 
 done more work, had more laughs and   
 moved more mountains than each other! 
 After a hectic hour doing chores and  
 three packed lunches for the next day,
 Rachel goes to her flute lesson and   
 Mark and I return to Hope Valley      
 College for a game of tennis.  I      
 return home to find Stuart mowing the 
 lawn after a leisurely time with the  
 newspaper!
