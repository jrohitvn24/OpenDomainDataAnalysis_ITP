		<content> This area rarely suffers extremes of  
 temperature or rainfall seldom having 
 a daytime temp higher than 80f or     
 lower than 32f. It is designated of   
 outstanding landscape value which     
 protects against development. Cover is
 chiefly grass &amp; deciduous woodland &amp; a
 number of ponds. Soil varies from clay
 to sand &amp; a number of sandstone       
 outcrops. Pockets of chalk carry      
 typical wild flowers of scabious      
 harebell &amp; spotted orchid. These are  
 decreasing due to drainage &amp; use of   
 herbicides. Rarieties still exist in  
 the limited wetland eg marsh orchid &amp; 
 spearwort. There is good cover of     
 hedges which means birds &amp; small      
 mammals are plentiful. Some hedges    
 have been removed to facilitate the   
 use of large machinery. There are     
 about l5 miles of footpaths.
