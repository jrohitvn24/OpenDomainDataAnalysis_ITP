		<title>04VETS LIFE IN KIRKBY</title>
		<content> The main categories of animals which  
 form the work of the local vet are    
{cows and sheep,}small animals form    
 only  10% of the work.There has been a
 change in attitude towards vets.Ten   
 years ago they were only called in    
 serious cases,there was a very low    
 rate of success.Today the emphasis of 
 the economically_minded farmer is to  
{prevent serious cases}developing and  
 so the vet is consulted at an early   
 stage and almost forms a{partnership  
 with the farmer to prevent serious    
 illness.there has been no change in   
 pet ownership over the last ten       
 years.The major problem vets face in  
 rural areas is{financial,}because of  
 the constant,heavy stream of          
 operations on small animals. Farmers  
 recognise the economic value of the   
 vet.; pet owners do not always do so.
