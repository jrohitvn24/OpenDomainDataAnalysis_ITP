		<title>03Population Syerston.</title>
		<content> Syerston has 51 households, about half
 of these have lived in the village for
 over five years.                      
                                       
 Sixteen of the families have children,
 four children live away from home and 
 are in full-time education. Fourteen  
 attend the local school and ten are   
 pre-school age.                       
                                       
 Approximately ten people have retired.
 The rest of the village is reasonably 
 young, which reflects in many of it's 
 activities.
