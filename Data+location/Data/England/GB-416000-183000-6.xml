		<content> Park North is a{residential}area.There
 is a mixture of all kinds of housing, 
 but the majority of houses are        
 terraced.Quite a lot of the houses and
 flats are rented from the council and 
 there are a few bungalows for{older   
{people}looked after by a part time    
{warden}.A lot of the houses and flats 
 are in need of{redecoration.          
 In nearly every road there are grass  
 verges or small grassed areas and a   
 lot of trees.This makes the area a    
 pleasant place to live in.There are   
 two large{grassed areas}and one       
 childrens{playground}.There is only   
 one shop selling sweets,groceries and 
 tobacco.The customers sometimes go    
 there several times a day to shop and 
 to chat to there friends.Most of the  
 population never go to{church},and    
 only a handful go regularly.
