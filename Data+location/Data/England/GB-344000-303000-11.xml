		<title>11PULVERBATCH VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Pulverbatch serves the needs of the   
 south-western corner of the survey    
 area but again is just outside the    
 survey.It has two pubs and a church as
 well as a village shop.               
   The people of Pulverbatch are very  
 loyal to their area and very much     
 regret the closing of their school and
 the amalgamation of their church into 
 the parish of Longden and Annscroft.  
   There is a small village nucleus    
 where the pubs are situated and a few 
 houses. The remainder of the village  
 is made up of scattered farm houses   
 throughout the mainly pasture land    
 area.                                 
   The area is hilly and contains many 
 picturesque walks and magnificent     
 views.
