		<title>03THE TWO PARISH CHURCHES</title>
		<content> The present parish church at{Aston    
{Ingham}dates from Norman times and is 
 probably built on the site of a much  
 older church. The only remaining      
 Norman structures are the west wall   
 aand the chancel arch, but although   
 the church was virtually rebuilt in   
 1890 many of the old features were    
 retained. The{lead font}is one of only
 38 in the country.                    
    The first church at{Cliffords      
{Mesne}was built in 1860 and served as 
 both church and school.A separate     
 church was built in 1882. There is no 
 record of there being an older church.
   Regrettably both parishes are now in
 the position of not having a resident 
 incumbent. Cliffords Mesne is joined  
 with Gorsley and Newent,whilst Aston  
 Ingham is part of a United Benefice   
 with Linton and Upton Bishop.
