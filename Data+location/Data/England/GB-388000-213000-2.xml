		<content>Buildings in our area (bounded by the  
settlements of Brockworth,Witcombe and 
Cranham) include {post-war private     
semis} and {detached};and {post-war    
council.} Suburban gardens are full of 
colour, scent, shrubs, trees and       
vegetables. Old {Cotswold stone}       
buildings appear in the more rural     
parts as does mellowed {red brick.}    
Some of the {bigger buildings} include 
a {public house} and Prinknash {Abbey} 
(a mixture of the ancient and the      
modern) as well as over ten {farms.}   
Eight disused {quarries} show the      
source of much of the local building   
material. Works land of the            
Glos.{Trading Estate} runs into our    
survey-area which is also divided by   
the A417 and the A46. The hills look   
down to the Severn and have evidence   
of a variety of {pre-historic} and     
{Roman} settlements.                   </content>
