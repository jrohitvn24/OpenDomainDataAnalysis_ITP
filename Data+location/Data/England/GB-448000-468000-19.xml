 The school I used to go to in Raskelf 
 opened in 1894 and closed in 1982. The
 population got smaller and smaller. On
 the last day there were only 18       
 children there.When it opened there   
 were only 6, but after 12 years over  
 300 were going.The school log book has
 stories of 10 year olds working in    
 brickyards and the master sending     
 children home to bring their money to 
 pay for schooling.There were 2        
 cloakrooms, 2 schoolrooms, a kitchen  
 and a pantry.It is now used as a gym  
 club and a meeting place for the      
 parish council.This school used to    
 belong to the parish church. When     
 anyone left they were presented with a
 copy of the Bible.
