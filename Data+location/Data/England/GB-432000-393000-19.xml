		<content> The Ecclesfield Riding Society(E.R.S.)
 is commonly called the pony club.It   
 is held every Tuesday night in a field
 on Chapeltown Road.It starts at 6.30pm
 and finishes at about 8.00 pm.One week
 it is a tuition night and the next it 
 is a fun night where you can jump or  
 practice your riding at the bottom of 
 the field.On tuition night there are  
 three groups.In the summer it is the  
 showing season.Sometimes on Sundays   
 there are horse shows on the E.R.S.   
 field.There are hand classes like the 
 Young Stock,Mountain and Moorland, and
 The Bonny Pony.There are the jumping  
 classes as well.Several children in   
 our area own horses and ponies and    
 stable them at local farms.
