		<content> In this area much local interest is   
 centered around farming.As a rural    
 area it's nature has changed with     
 fewer farm workers and more commuters 
 now living in the villages.  With the 
 majority of the area having been built
 some time ago there are many people   
 very keen to preserve the charm of the
 village. There are a lot of local     
 clubs and much effort is put into     
 helping maintain the area.Funds are   
 allocated to help run the village hall
 and church.
