		<title>08STONE CIRCLES, BODMIN MOOR</title>
		<content> A REMARKABLE PART OF LOCAL HISTORY IS 
 STONE CIRCLES.THERE ARE OVER 20 {STONE
{CIRCLES}IN CORNWALL CONCENTRATED      
 ALMOST ENTIRELY ON BODMIN MOOR AND IN 
 THE LANDS END PENINSULA AND           
 CONSEQUENTLY ALL BUT ONE ARE MADE OF  
 GRANITE.IT IS LIKELY THAT OTHERS HAVE 
 BEEN DESTROYED OVER THE CENTURIES. ALL
 CIRCLES ARE ENCLOSED EXCEPT STRIPLE   
 STONES ,WHICH WITH ITS ENDURING BANK  
 AND DITCH,IS CLASSED AS A HENGE.LIKE  
 THE OTHER CIRCLES ON BODMIN MOOR BOTH 
 IN DIAMETER AS WELL AS IN NUMBER AND  
 SIZE OF STONES,IT IS LARGER THAN THOSE
 AT LANDS END.SOMETIMES THE CIRCLES ARE
 NOT ALWAYS ROUND.THERE ARE 5 STONE    
 CIRCLES IN OUR AREA ROUGHLY 30 FT.    
 ACROSS AND WITH A CIRCUMFERENCE OF    
 75FT.MOST OF THE STONE CIRCLES HAVE A 
 MOUND AROUND THEM.ALL STONE CIRCLES IN
 OUR AREA ARE MADE OF GRANITE.
