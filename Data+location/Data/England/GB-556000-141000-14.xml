		<title>14BIDBOROUGH VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>  Bidborough Village Hall was built in 
1973. The money needed was raised by   
the local people who stage open days   
in the village when each club and      
society makes its contribution to the  
festivities and several gardens are    
opened to the public.                  
  In one month during the summer of    
1985 14 organisations used the         
excellent facilities of the hall, in   
addition to the regular use by the     
church and school.                     
  Meetings are organised by the        
Women's Institute, the Wives' Club,    
the Photographic Society and the       
Gardening and Drama Clubs. Classes are 
held for Keep Fit, Art and             
Dressmaking. The Welfare Baby Clinic   
and the weekly library use the Hall.   
The Badminton, Cricket, Bowls and      
Tennis clubs also used the Hall during 
the month.                             </content>
