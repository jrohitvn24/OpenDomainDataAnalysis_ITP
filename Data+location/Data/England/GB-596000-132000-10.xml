		<content>    During the week we are usually up  
 at about 6.30 a.m. in order for us all
 to wash, dress and have breakfast     
 before going to school or work. After 
 every one has left I settle myself in 
 my 'office'.My mother-in-law and I    
 usually have a cup of tea or coffee   
 mid-morning and then a sandwich or    
 snack at lunchtime (about 12.30 to    
 1.00 p.m.) This could be cold meat or 
 a spread of some description, or toast
 with baked beans or pilchards on      
 top,or perhaps some hot soup with     
 French bread (a long crispy loaf of   
 bread).We usually also have a piece of
 cake and a cup of tea.The children    
 take sandwiches to school for their   
 lunch also some cake and a piece of   
 fruit, which I prepare in the morning.
 They also take a drink in a flask (a  
 container designed to keep drinks hot 
 or cold).                             </content>
