		<content> The children of both schools have     
 greatly enjoyed finding out about the 
 area in which they live.It is a varied
 district near the Downs, the sea and  
 large towns.It is an old town and much
 of its heritage has been kept. It is a
 successful commercial port and        
 pleasant residential area.            
 It is, however, a changing town with  
 an expanding population served by an  
 airport, railway and major roads. The 
 increase in traffic has meant that the
 Norfolk Bridge over the Adur, has had 
 to be replaced and work is currently  
 taking place.
