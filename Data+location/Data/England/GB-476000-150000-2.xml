		<content> The population of Crookham Village is 
 697 persons on a broad social basis of
 mixed age groups from young families  
 to retired people. Crookham Village   
 was given its name in 1952 and the    
 main street comprises a ribbon        
 development of residential homes,     
 ranging from Grade 2 listed buildings 
 to modern houses erected in 1964. The 
 major part of the main street is in a 
 conservation area and an 18th century 
 forge still stands by the roadside.   
 The local Parish Council is           
 responsible for footpaths, rights of  
 way, street lighting and recommends on
 planning matters.
