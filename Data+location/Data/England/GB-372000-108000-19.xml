		<title>19Hazelbury Bryan Church</title>
		<content>   The church which stands next to the 
 school is isolated from the rest of   
 the village because of the ravages of 
 the Black Death in the fourteenth     
 century. It is dedicated to St. Mary  
 and St. James. Although the building  
 is essentially of the fifteenth       
 century, there is little doubt that an
 earlier Norman church was built on the
 site. Only the font remains. Alice de 
 Bryan was responsible for its         
 rebuilding, including the tower, the  
 nave, and the chancel. The tithe barn 
 is still standing, and is now a listed
 building. The walls are original, and 
 remnants of the old timbers are       
 visible. The Church House was used as 
 almshouses but fell into disrepair.   
 Miss Violet Cross, a generous         
 benefactor, made funds available for  
 its renovation.
