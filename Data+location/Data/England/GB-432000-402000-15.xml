		<title>15SAINT MARYS CHURCH</title>
		<content> The village is centred around its     
 church ,the Parish Church of Saint    
 Mary.The earlier parts of the church  
 are possibly{pre Norman}so part of the
 church we now see would have been seen
 by those conducting the first         
 Doomesday Survey.The church is made of
 local sandstone this causes problems  
 as in todays polluted atmosphere it is
 weathering quite badly and a great    
 deal of restoration has been done.The 
 church was the only church to serve   
 the people of Worsbrough for many     
 years and so as the population grew   
 the church was added to in the 14th   
 and 15th centuries.Inside the church  
 is a unique monument to{Sir Roger     
{Rockley},Knight,whose family lived at 
 Rockley Manor and were patrons of the 
 church.In recent years the church yard
 has been used by local schools to     
 perform{Mediaeval Mystery Plays}.     </content>
