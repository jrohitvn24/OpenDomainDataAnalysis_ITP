		<title>19The Big Waters, Seaton Burn</title>
		<content> The{Big Waters}is a lake surrounded   
 by  a wild life reserve park and      
 picnic area. At least two mute swans  
 and eight cygnets live there. They are
 endangered species due to lead weights
 and pollution. There are also         
 mallards, coots and moorhens. There is
 a road leading to a car park and some 
 picnic benches.There are seats, paths,
 stepping stones and bridges for       
 visitors to use.We saw a sparrow-hawk,
 swallows,crows,swifts,house martins,  
 sparrows, starlings,blackbirds and a  
 robin.Some young trees have been      
 planted including beeches an alders.  
 We saw marigolds, yellowflag, my      
 lady's slipper, clover and many other 
 flowers growing wild. The things      
 which spoil the area are the sewers,  
 the aeroplanes and the motorway,
