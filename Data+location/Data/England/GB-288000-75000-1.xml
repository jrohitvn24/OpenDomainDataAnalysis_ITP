		<content> GENERAL DESCRIPTION                   
                                       
 The area in this block is a landscape 
  broken up by river valleys,between   
 rolling hills.Heights range from near 
 sea level to around 200 metres.It is  
 predominantly farmland, and is a      
 landscape typical of rural DEVON with 
 a number of scattered farms and one   
 nucleated village at Ideford.There is 
 a long history of settlement in this  
 area,and many of the buildings        
 are 300-400 years old,although more   
 modern housing in Ideford has been    
 constructed since 1945.Much of the    
 area is under pasture for Sheep,and   
 Dairy and Beef Cattle,but arable land 
 is also found producing cereals and   
 fodder crops.Unlike some regions this 
 farmong area hasretained its          
 traditional hedges,giving character.
