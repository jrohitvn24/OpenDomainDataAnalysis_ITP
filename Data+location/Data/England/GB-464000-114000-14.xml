		<content>   About 100 people regularly attend   
 church services at{St Peter and St    
{Paul's Parish Church,Hambledon}and    
 this rises to about 260 for Christmas 
 or Easter services.                   
   There are 20 men, women and children
 in the choir, aged 9-72 years. There  
 are 10 bell ringers and bells are rung
 twice on Sunday.                      
  The church has links with the        
{Methodist's}Chapel in the village and 
 they go to each others' services.     
{Roman Catholics}have mass in the      
 church once a month.                  
   Mrs. Barratt, a church warden,      
 believes that the church will be used 
 more frequently in years to come, for 
 concerts and exhibitions for example, 
 rather than being mostly unused for 6 
 days a week.
