		<content> Principally the area is an urban      
 area.However the city has a long      
 tradition as a market and service     
 centre for agriculture.               
 The area of study is situated to the  
 east of the city.A large amount of    
 potential agricultural land has been  
 clear for industrial use.A substantial
 amount of land is waste or in marginal
 use, e.g.as a scrap yard.             
 As one moves east the river valley    
 merges into the Fens.Here begins      
 serious attempts of large scale       
 farming.                              
 Flag fen and Northey are areas of     
 arable farming.Here large fields,often
 over 10 acres,grow crops such as      
 wheat,barley and potatoes.            
 Despite 5 road signs warning of       
 animals few were seen.Nearer the city 
 centre there were 7 ponies being      
 grazed.                               </content>
