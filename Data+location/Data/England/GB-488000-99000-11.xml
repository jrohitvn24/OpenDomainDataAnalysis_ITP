		<content> Mrs.Ben moved with her family to      
 Hewarts Lane in 1938.It was very      
 countryfied then with only a few      
 houses and shops.There was a village  
 hall in Rose Green Road where the     
 Scouts,Guides and Sunday School met.  
 There was also a baker who sold hot   
 loaves for 4 old pence.Near by there  
 was a cafe,a butcher,a fish&amp;chip shop,
 a grocer and two green grocers.There  
 was farm land all around and cows     
 grazed on Avisford Park.East of       
 Carlton Avenue was marshland where    
 watercress grew.It had to be drained  
 before building could take place.     
 Children had lovely places to play.   
 They could wander for miles and be    
 quite safe.Mrs.Ben likes living in    
 Rose Green because her friends and    
 family are there.However she thinks it
 is now too large and busy.She liked it
 better as it was.                     </content>
