		<content> The buildings in the village of Firle 
 include houses, Firle Place, a shop,  
 St Peters church, a pub and the       
 school.There is lots of landscape -   
 The Beacon Decoy pond and a resevoir  
 which is now grassed over.The church  
 hall is locally known as the Reading  
 Room due to its previous use as a     
 library.                              
     The village of Beddingham is      
 smaller than Firle. It is close to a  
 chalk pit which bears its name. The   
 chalk pit is used by the army and the 
 police for exercises.
