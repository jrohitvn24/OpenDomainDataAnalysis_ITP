		<content> Near to the{A1}and its junction with  
 the{A19}the farm stretches right up to
 the urban recreational space on       
{Hedworth Estate.}The fields are       
 intensively managed in large divisions
 with boundaries of wooden posts and   
 barbed wire. Some of the remaining    
 hawthorn hedges are 150 years old.{   
{Friesian}cows feed on the pasture and 
 fields of grass are grown to provide  
 silage for the winter. The fields are 
 nearly flat with the heavy, black     
 soil of the River Tyne flood plain. A 
 stream called Calf Burn runs through  
 the farm. Most farm buildings are of  
 sandstone with slate roofs, with more 
 modern barns made of asbestos panels. 
 The original farmhouse was demolished 
 and replaced by a two storey brick    
 building.
