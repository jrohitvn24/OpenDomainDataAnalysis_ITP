		<content>      Until 1919 the Nevile family     
 owned all the land around Kinoulton   
                                       
 including what we now call{Vimy Ridge.
 Vimy Ridge Farm was called Pasture    
 Hills Farm and was farmed by the      
 Keyworth family.                      
      When the Nevile family sold off  
 the estate a man named{Sir Jesse Hind 
 bought Pasture Hills Farm.He had a son
 who went to fight in the 1st World War
 and was killed at the Battle of Vimy  
 Ridge. Sir Jesse Hind had an avenue of
 poplar trees planted in memory of his 
 son and this was called{Vimy Ridge}and
 Pasture Hills Farm became Vimy Ridge  
 Farm.The poplar trees can be seen for 
 miles around and are a well-known{    
 landmark.                             
      Vimy Ridge Farm is now derelict.
