		<content>The following data is taken from the   
1981 Census Enumeration. The infor-    
mation refers only to RQAT01 and       
RQAT04 of Ward 18 of that Census.      
Population structure: A large propor-  
tion of young and old people make up   
the population, 20% being aged under 16
years and a further 20% being aged 60  
or over.                               
Employment: From the 10% sample taken  
in the Census (40 people), none were   
employed in agriculture whereas about  
half were employed in SERVICES and a   
quarter in MANUFACTURING. There is no  
direct evidence of the number in the   
sample who commute to work outside this
area, though 85% travelled to work by  
private car.
