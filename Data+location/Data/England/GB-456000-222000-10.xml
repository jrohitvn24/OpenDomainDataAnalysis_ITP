		<title>10CHURCHES IN BICESTER.</title>
		<content>RELIGION:The town has a very impressive
parish church-St.Edburg's.It dates from
the 15th century but the first church  
on this site was built in Saxon times. 
It is surrounded by a large church yard
and the nearby vicarage was built in   
1226.                                  
CATHOLICISM:The suppression of the     
priory in 1534 made this almost non    
existent in Bicester until 1869 when   
the parish priest of Hethe came to say 
mass at what is now the Handy Stores.In
1943 Bicester became a parish of it's  
own and in 1963 a large modern church  
was built opposite St Edburg's.        
  The town also has a convent in Kings 
End in the building that was formerly a
hotel.It is staffed by the Presentation
Sisters.                               
METHODISM:The large Methodist church in
Sheep Street was opened in 1927 and it 
can accomodate 420 worshippers.        </content>
