		<content>      These are comments from children 
 in class 3IL at Thornham School,      
 Rochdale who were asked what it was   
 like to live here in 1985.            
{"There's nothing to do except sit and 
{watch the cars on the motorway. The   
{weather is dull, its usually raining"}
 "A big problem is drugs. Drugs are    
 being used by many people and the     
 problem's getting bigger"{            
{"People are gettong into the computer 
{age but I (as most people) have to go 
{to school to get an education"}       
 "More and more cars and transport is  
 being made and this crowding our world
 not to mention the pollution"{        
{"Life is better now but for the people
{who go around stealing, beating up old
{people, vandalising and taking drugs. 
{Families are suffering because of all 
{the loss of jobs." }
