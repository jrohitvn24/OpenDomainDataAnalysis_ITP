		<title>03A DAY IN THE LIFE OF TRACY 1</title>
		<content> THURSDAY 12TH JULY 1985               
 I got up at 7.30am,dressed and went   
 downstairs to have cornflakes for     
 breakfast.At 8.45 I left for school,  
 arrived at 8.55 and went in at 9.00.  
 First we had assembly followed by P.E.
 in the hall then we had playtime at   
 10.40.I played skipping with Gaynor,  
 Lisa and Penny untill 11.00 then we   
 came in and did language work.Next we 
 did singing and at 12.15 we played out
 for 15 mins. until 12.30 when we came 
 in for our dinner.My favourite school 
 dinner is chips,peas and fish fingers.
 When I had finished my dinner at about
 1.00,I went outside to play in the    
 playground.Me and my friends played   
 rounders with children from Junior 3  
 until 1.30.
