		<title>08TRANSPORT - THREE MOSSES</title>
		<content> Because of the nature of the area,    
 travel is in the main by private car. 
 The bus service travels in both       
 directions i.e. to Southport or to    
 Liverpool. This service is operated by
 the Ribble Bus Company, and runs on an
 hourly schedule. The bus service does 
 not travel through the whole area only
 through the main street of Haskayne   
 village, although at one time the     
 Cheshire Lines Railway dissected the  
 two lower portions to left and right  
 of the designated area.  The lines    
 were closed during the Beeching cuts, 
 the rails and sleepers were removed,  
 but the slight embankments and        
 cuttings are still in evidence, part  
 of these disused railway track is now 
 a Nature Reserve.
