		<content> The nettles grow very fast so we      
 borrowed two goats to eat them but    
 they liked the leaves on the trees    
 better. They were great fun and loved 
 to have the children visit them every 
 day. It was not a success in getting  
 rid of the nettles!                   
                                       
 We have also cleared a patch about 1Om
 by 1Om and dug out a pond.  Mr. Keys, 
 one of our school govenors helped us  
 and he gave us enough sand to line it.
 The P.T.A. have bought a thick plastic
 sheet to make the pond.               
                                       
 We are all busy finding out what      
 plants and fish will be suitable for  
 this sight.                           
                                       
 We found a nest of hedgehogs, mother  
 and five babies but we were careful   
 not to disturb them.                  </content>
