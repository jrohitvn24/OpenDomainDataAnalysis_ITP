		<title>15PRESTON SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content>     For the purposes of this survey we
 will look at the shops in the centre  
 of Preston i.e. not including Fulwood,
 Plungington and other outlying        
 districts. At the moment Preston      
 centre is a mixture of streets and    
 car-free shopping precincts. The      
 planners are gradualy moving towards  
 making Preston centre mainly          
 pedestrian, and a new shopping centre 
 is under construction near the railway
 station. Its area will be over 300,000
 sq. feet and the cost will be Â£16m. It
 will include Asda and Debenhams       
 stores. A recent survey showed that   
 shoppers liked its modern facilities  
 and its fairly wide selection of      
 services. The main complaint was the  
 problem of parking. In our class      
 survey, 30 families had used the      
 centre for shopping in the last week.
