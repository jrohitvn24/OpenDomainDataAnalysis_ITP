 WHICH HAVE BEEN BUILT OVER THE LAST   
 FEW YEARS WITH AN ESTATE OF ABOUT 25  
 HOUSES AT LT FRANSHAM CALLED LIME TREE
 CRESCENT AND A CUL-DE-SAC OF BUNGALOWS
 NEAR THE STATION, ALTHOUGH THIS HAS   
 SINCE BEEN CLOSED DOWN.               
                                       
 SINGLE HOUSES HAVE BEEN BUILT AND MANY
 OLD PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN - AND ARE    
 STILL BEING - RENOVATED, BUT GENERALLY
 BUILDING IS KEPT TO A MINIMUM TO      
 MAINTAIN THE COUNTRY VILLAGE QUALITY. 
                                       
 THE LOCAL FARMS HAVE A NUMBER OF TIED 
 HOUSES AND THERE ARE THREE SMALL      
 COUNCIL ESTATES, ONE AT BEESTON AND   
 TWO AT LITTLE FRANSHAM.
