		<title>05WARKWORTH VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Warkworth}village is pleasantly       
 situated{within a large meander}of the
 River Coquet, giving it the advantage 
 of{defence on three sides,}with the   
 fourth being protected by{the castle. 
 Almost all of the village is{untouched
{by modern development.}It possesses   
 many{ancient buildings}including the  
{castle, the church, and a market cross
 erected in 1830.{The division of land 
{in medieval times}can be clearly      
 recognised in the village with each of
{the plots extending from the building 
{on the main street down to the river. 
 The{bridge tower}which was built in   
 the latter part of the 14th century   
 is almost unique.{St Lawrence's Church
 was burnt down in 1174, fifty years   
 after it was first built, by William  
 the Lion of Scotland. The north wall  
 of the Norman church still remains    
 however in the present building.      </content>
