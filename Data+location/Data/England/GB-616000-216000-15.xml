		<title>15A short history of Clacton</title>
		<content>     The seaside resort of{Clacton}did 
 not exist until about a hundred years 
 ago, when the pier was built and      
 people travelled by cart down to the  
 beach from{Gt. Clacton.               
                                       
     Today the old church of St.John is
 still standing after a thousand years.
 Before the church stood there were    
 open fields and maybe a bit of        
 woodland and some winding rutted lanes
 and driftways. There were probably    
 havens across the coast that have     
 maybe disappeared beneath the waves.  
                                       
     Building needs were landed on the 
 shore from barges within living memory
 and earlier it was coal and chalk to  
 fertilise the fields.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
