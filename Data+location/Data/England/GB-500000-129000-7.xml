		<content>{The Jubilee of King George V was      
{commemorated by a plaque and a tree}at
 the top of Station Road. These were   
 donated by Miss Smallpiece, the       
 founder of the{Smallpiece Trust.}There
 is an interesting{village sign}nearby,
 which was given by the Parish Council 
 in 1984.                              
{The Olde Bakehouse}was built in 1912  
 and was still in use until 1976 when  
 it was converted into a house. It     
 still has the old flour shoot.        
{Hilltop Stores}was the first          
 off-license  in Loxwood and is 150    
 years old.                            
 At one time the road ran behind the   
 present Post Office and the house next
 door to it has, as a result, its front
 door at the back.                     
{Church Cottage}is over 400 years old. 
 The old church used to be on the site.
