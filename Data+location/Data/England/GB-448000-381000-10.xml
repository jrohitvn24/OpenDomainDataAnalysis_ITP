		<title>10MY DAY - BY KATIE LEONARD</title>
		<content> I get up at 07.30, have a wash, get   
 dressed and have breakfast. I pack my 
 bag and set off for school at 8.30.   
   At school we do all sorts of things.
 There are 34 children in our class    
 aged from 9 to 11. I like reading; I  
 have read 31 books in this class. I   
 like a lot of sports and P.E. I don't 
 like doing handwriting or difficult   
 Maths.                                
   We finish school at 15.30 and I go  
 straight home. Usually I play outside 
 with my friends Emma, Sally and       
 Nicola. We ride our bikes and play on 
 roller boots. At 17.00 we have tea    
 -sandwiches or maybe beans on toast.  
 After tea we watch T.V. I watch about 
 1 hour per weekday in the summer but  
 more in the winter. I sometimes play  
 tennis and go to Guides on Tuesday and
 Youth Club on Friday. I go dancing on 
 Saturday morning. Bedtime is 20.45    </content>
