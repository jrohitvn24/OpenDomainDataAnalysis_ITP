		<content> Irton Waterworks pumps and cleans 4   
 million gallons to Scarborough each   
 day.It comes from the River Derwent.It
 is raw water.It is also pumped from   
 4OO feet down into a well.The cleaning
 process is simple.Water flows to      
 settlement tanks where solids are     
 settled.Then chlorine is added as a   
 disinfectant and allum which makes    
 dirt cling together.The water flows to
 tanks,which at the bottom have a layer
 of sludge.The water flows through,but 
 the sludge stops the dirt getting     
 through.The water flows to rapid      
 gravity filters then it flows to      
 further tanks where it must percolate 
 through a layer of sand.This separates
 any more dirt.Sulphur Dioxide is added
 to control the chlorine.The water is  
 pumped to reservoirs.There are 2 main 
 reservoirs in Scarborough.This process
 is simple yet effective.              </content>
