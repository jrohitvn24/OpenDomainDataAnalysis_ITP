		<title>07Welbeck Pit in the 1950/60s</title>
		<content> In the 1950s there were many changes  
 to Mr. Moody's job as a miner at      
 Welbeck Colliery.Hydraulic props were 
 introduced and the introduction of    
 other machinery meant that 95% of all 
 coal was being loaded by machines.This
 was slow but it meant that 50% more   
 coal could be turned in 24 hours.There
 were also more breakdowns.            
  The pit held three world records for 
 deep mined coal output during this    
 period,the records being held for     
 several months at a time.             
  Eventually,the rundown in the mining 
 industry in the 1960s led to a lot of 
 job-losses,many pit closures and a    
 standstill in wages.Many men left the 
 pit for better paid,cleaner and safer 
 jobs outside the industry,and Welbeck 
 took on a lot of "Geordie" miners,who 
 came from "worked out" pits in the    
 North-East.                           </content>
