		<title>14Law &amp; Order Around Braydon</title>
		<content> This is a very scattered community and
 has no real problems with maintaining 
 law and order. The local police,      
 stationed in Purton village, patrols  
 Pavenhill on foot making his presence 
 known and stopping to talk to anyone  
 on his beat. He also patrols the      
 larger area but this is by car,       
 waiting at the crossroads to show a   
 police presence. There is great       
 emphasis on a local community police  
 force and generally the people of this
 area are very willing to accept the   
 regular presence of the police and    
 will talk to them willingly.
