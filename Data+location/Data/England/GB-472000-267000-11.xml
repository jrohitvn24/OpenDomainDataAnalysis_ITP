		<content> BECAUSE THERE ARE SEVERAL OLDER PEOPLE
 IN PITSFORD, THE POST OFFICE IS VERY  
 BUSY. OLDER PEOPLE PREFER TO USE A    
 CONVENIENT SUB POST OFFICE RATHER THAN
 TRAVEL TO A LARGER BRANCH. THEY       
 USUALLY COME TO CLAIM THEIR STATE     
 PENSION AND BUY QUITE A FEW THINGS    
 WHILST THEY ARE IN THE SHOP.          
 IN ADDITION TO PAYING OUT VARIOUS     
 ALLOWANCES, WE SELL TELEPHONE STAMPS  
 SO THAT CUSTOMERS MAY SPREAD THE COST 
 OF USING THE TELEPHONE OVER AN        
 EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.              
 POSTAGE STAMP SALES AND CERTAIN FORMS 
 OF SAVING SCHEMES ALSO REPRESENT A    
 SIGNIFICANT PART OF POST OFFICE WORK. 
 THE GENERAL POST OFFICE PAYS ME A     
 MONTHLY SALARY BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF 
 BUSINESS NORMALLY HANDLED.            
 EMPLOYEES IN A MAIN POST OFFICE       
 RECEIVE A SET SALARY INDEPENDENT OF   
 THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS.           </content>
