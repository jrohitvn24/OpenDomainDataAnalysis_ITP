		<title>15AN OLD LADY FROM TONBRIDGE:1</title>
		<content>  Selah was born in 1897 at 52 Ship_   
 bourne Road.It was a three bedroomed  
 house with running water but there was
 no bathroom and the toilet was outside
 the back door.The home had fires in   
 three rooms and was lit by oil lamps. 
 When they wanted hot water it had to  
 be heated in the kettle on the fire.  
  There were six children in her family
 and Selah shared a room with her sis_ 
 ter.Her father was a blacksmith and   
 worked 12 hours a day.Her mother also 
 had to work as a laundry maid.        
  The family had meat to eat every day 
 and all kinds of vegetables from their
 own garden and allotment.Her mother   
 bought apples and pears,and milk in a 
 jug from the farm.                    
  Selah now lives on her own but all   
 her children live nearby.Her daughter 
 helps her with the washing and shopp_ 
 ing and she goes there every Sunday.  </content>
