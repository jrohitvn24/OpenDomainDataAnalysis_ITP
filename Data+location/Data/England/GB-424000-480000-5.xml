		<title>05Quarrying in &amp; near Well</title>
		<content> Steetley Ltd. decided to pull out of  
 the quarry when permission to expand  
 was refused after vigorous protests   
 from Well villagers about 5 years ago.
   The supply of dolomitic limestone,  
 road stone and agricultural lime has  
 now finished;the ready mix concrete   
 business closes at the end of the     
 year.No jobs have been lost.The area  
 has been landscaped and will be       
 returned to agricultural use,1 large  
 shed to be left for the farmer.       
   A huge area of land around          
 Nosterfield is now a gravel quarry.   
 The locals ae concerned as the land is
 not being reinstated to its previous  
 standards and there is a large volume 
 of heavy traffic.Villagers have       
 opposed derestriction on B6267 for 21 
 years.On 21-AUG-85 a 30 min. survey   
 showed a total of 47 vehicles,mainly  
 heavy commercial,passing thru' village</content>
