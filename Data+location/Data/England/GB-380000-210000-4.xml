		<title>04WITHYGROW'S FARM - 2.</title>
		<content>  Mr and Mrs Whittaker have been at the
 farmhouse since 1947. They would not  
 change their farming life for         
 anything. The{farmhouse}was built in  
 1485 (and extended at later dates) and
 will therefore have seen many changes 
 over its 500 years. In 1985 it        
 represents a traditional farm both in 
 scale and scope - for example, the    
 keeping of its own ram is quite       
 unusual in these days of artificial   
 insemination. Some things will never  
 change - at the time of the survey Mr 
 and Mrs Whittaker were hoping that it 
 would stop raining!
