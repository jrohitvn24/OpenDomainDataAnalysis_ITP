		<title>07The May Queen</title>
		<content>   Every year there is a carnival      
called the May Queen which lasts for   
three weeks. When we have walked around
Beckenham we go to Beckenham recreation
ground where the May Queens are blessed
and crowned. After walking around Hayes
we go to Hayes Common where we parade  
round the green and the London May     
Queen is blessed and crowned. The West 
Wickham May Queen has a flower festi-  
val; we have one posie of flowers each.
We walk to a church where we are       
blessed and then go to an old people's 
home to give them the flowers.         
   In June or July we have the Mayor's 
tea party and attend a couple of fetes.
   Before you are a May Queen you have 
to be an attendant for so many years   
then a crownbearer and prince for one  
year each. When you are crownbearer you
cannot drop out of being the May Queen.
