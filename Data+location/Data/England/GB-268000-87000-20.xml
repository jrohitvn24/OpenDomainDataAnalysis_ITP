		<title>20TRANSPORT IN/AROUND CHAGFORD</title>
		<content> In an area such as this one's own     
 transport is something of a necessity.
 Public services exist in the form of  
{buses}to{Exeter, Okehampton and Newton
{Abbot,}but these are few and far      
 between.  The nearest{train}service is
 in{Exeter}where there is also an{Air_ 
{port.} A{Taxi}service is available in 
 Chagford but the traffic problems     
 referred to elsewhere illustrate the  
 fact that most people have their own  
{cars.}An occasional{bicycle}may be    
 seen (but the hilly nature of the     
 roads is not conducive to this mode of
 transport) as may a{horse.  Tractors,}
 too are not uncommon as a means of    
 getting around and have decided advan_
 tages in icy and snowy conditions.
