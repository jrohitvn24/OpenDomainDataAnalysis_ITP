   The Recreation ground is in the     
 centre of King's Sutton.   At one     
 end, the park is just grass, and that 
 place is for playing football or      
 games.   At the other end, there are  
 swings, a large slide, wooden climbing
 frames and rocking animals.           
   It is a very popular place.   Many  
 chidren go there to play.   It is also
 lovely for picnicking, partly because 
 it is surrounded by trees.            
   I think it is very unusual for there
 to be such a large playground in the  
 centre of a village, but everyone     
 enjoys it.   I think that it is a very
 good park, and it is well looked      
 after.
