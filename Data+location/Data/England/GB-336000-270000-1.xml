		<title>01SOUTH EAST OF BRAMPTON BRYAN</title>
		<content> This is a plain bounded to the north  
 by the River Teine. It is in a        
 beautiful unspoilt agricultural area  
 surrounded by tree clad hills.        
 Although farmed fairly intensively the
 land is divided into fields of five to
 twenty acres by hedges containing a   
 number of broad leaved trees. The     
 pretty village of Brampton Bryan is   
 renowned for its timber and thatched  
 cottages. The hall and cattle ruins   
 are surrounded by a huge undulating   
 yew hedge. The hamlets of Letton      
 Walford and Newton consist of farms   
 and cottages.
