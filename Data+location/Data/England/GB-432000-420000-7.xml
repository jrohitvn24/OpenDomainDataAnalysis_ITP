		<title>07STANLEY ROYD HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>     In a district like Wakefield we   
 have many hospitals and just on the   
 outskirts we have a psychiatric       
 hospital called Stanley Royd. In the  
 past year this hospital has become    
 well known because of an outbreak of  
 Salmonella poisoning. At first it was 
 a minor incident but it spread around 
 the hospital affecting both staff and 
 patients. It was a serious problem and
 a hazard to everyone. As time passed  
 many elderly patients died. Health    
 inspectors came from all over the     
 country checking the kitchens and the 
 environment of the hospital. The cause
 of the Salmonella was joints of beef  
 that had been cooked and left to stand
 in the warm sunshine for about twenty 
 four hours. These problems have now   
 been sorted out and the hospital is   
 back to normal.
