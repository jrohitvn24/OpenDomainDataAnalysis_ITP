		<content> Percy Cross Rig takes its name from   
 the 13th Century cross which marks the
 ancient Guisborough to Westerdale     
 Road.  Over 260 metres above sea level
 th ridge runs south west from Hutton  
 Moor to Garden Bank Wood in Kildale.  
 To the north lies the broad, flat dale
 of Sleddale with Gisborough grouse    
 moor beyond.  Marshy areas called     
 slacks and abundant springs feed      
 Sleddale Beck which forms the county  
 boundary between the parishes of      
 Commondale and Kildale.  Old field

 remains are evidence of mans          
 occupation of this now lonely area    
 within the North York Moors National  
 Park.  South west of the ridge lies   
 Lonsdale drained by Lonsale Beck and  
 farmed, with areas of managed         
 coniferous woodland on the highland.
