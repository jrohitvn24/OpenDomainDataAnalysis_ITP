		<title>04The almshouses, Hilmarton</title>
		<content> In Hilmarton there are a row of what  
 we call almshouses, but in 1976 their 
 name was changed to trust houses. The 
 residents are today called licensees. 
 The almshouses belong to the church   
 commissioners and were built by       
 William Henry Poynder in 1875 for     
 people over 65. Today Mrs Kirkpatrick 
 looks after the almshouses and        
 collects the rent. There are five     
 houses and there is one television    
 aerial between them. At the moment    
 there are five ladies who are living  
 there.These are Mrs Hemmings, Mrs     
 Dobson, Miss Hathway, Mrs Kirkpatrick 
 and Mrs Taylor. In 1976 there was     
 Â£24,000 of work done to the houses.   
 The Vicar and Churchwardens are also  
 responsible for the decoration,       
 brickwork and gardening. Mrs          
 Kirkpatrick pays for the water bill   
 and the common central heating system.</content>
