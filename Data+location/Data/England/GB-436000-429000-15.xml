		<title>15FOOTPATH WALKS</title>
		<content>   The Swillington area has a good     
 network of footpaths which provide    
 interesting walks through woodland,   
 open farmland and areas of industrial 
 activities.                           
   At the present time there are{26}   
{public rights of way}although some of 
 these have been affected by farming,  
 opencast mining, quarying activities  
 and housing development.These         
 footpaths are walked regularly by two 
 senior citizens who report any        
 obtructions, etc., to the Parish      
 Council. There have been cases recenty
 of local farmers ploughing up little  
 used footpaths and coming into        
 conflict with the Ramberlers          
 Association. A section of the{Leeds   
{Country Way,}a 60 mile recreational   
 footpath around Leeds completed in    
 1982, passes through the area.
