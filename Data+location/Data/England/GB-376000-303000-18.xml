		<content> The overall picture that is obtained  
 of the area is one of a very green and
 reasonably well wooded area.The       
 woodland is concentrated in hardwood  
 stands on the Hatton Grange Estate and
 on the ridges edging the study area.  
 The remainder of the hardwood consists
 of single trees set in hedgerows and  
 field boundaries.There is very little 
 softwood planting in the area.        
  The arera is remarkably flat with the
 only areas of high land being the     
 ridges bounding the SE corner.The     
 average height of the area is 80' with
 the ridges rising to 108'.There is    
 also the valley of the Worfe which is 
 cut down to 60'.                      
  The only barren areas in the study   
 area are the spoil heaps which have   
 come from the sand and gravel         
 quarrying which is no longer continued
 along the northern edge of the area.  </content>
