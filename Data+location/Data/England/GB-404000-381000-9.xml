		<content> Chinley nestled in its valley on a wet
 June Sunday and it looked like our    
 habitat.We moved in.The natives       
 watched us,but we didn't knock over   
 walls,the children went to the village
 school and we shopped in the village. 
   It was the{W.I.}who invited me in   
 first.Through them I helped to start  
 Meals on Wheels and helped in the     
 clinic. Next a lovely old railwayman  
 said I still had work to do for       
 Socialism and got me onto the Youth   
 Club managers. I canvassed the area at
 elections and became a school         
 Governor. Elected onto the Council I  
 looked after the public areas of the  
 Parish that was now part of me and I  
 of it. When my husband was critically 
 ill,their support was incredible.     
   Serve a Derbyshire village and you  
 know how real life brings the reward  
 of real happiness.{  Margot Annand    </content>
