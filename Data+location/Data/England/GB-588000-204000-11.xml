		<title>11  THE RIVER BLACKWATER</title>
		<content> The River Blackwater estuary from     
 Bradwell to Maldon is 2 km wide and   
 16km long.                            
   The Blackwater is supposed to be the
 saltiest river in Britain.There is a  
 saltworks on the river which produces 
 the famous Maldon sea-salt.           
   Maldon used to be a good fishing    
 port but the fish have gone for some  
 reason.Either the river was too       
 polluted or the fish just moved out   
 for some unknown reason.              
   The Blackwater is now used mainly   
 for leisure. The river is long and    
 sheltered and it only takes a couple  
 of hours to get down from London.There
 are a number of Yacht Clubs and some  
 Londoners keep their own boats on the 
 river or the canal.There are also     
 cottages and boats available for hire.
