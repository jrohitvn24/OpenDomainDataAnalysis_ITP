 In June some St.Laurence pupils went  
 to Brunel University,named after      
 Isambard Brunel,the famous engineer   
 .Mr.Mander,(Schools' liaison officer  
 ),showed us around the campus .As you 
 enter the University you will find    
 shops, a bank,a travel agency and a   
 supermarket.We found out that 5       
 students shared a flat,each flat      
 having a toilet and shower.The        
 University provides places for 3000   
 students,many being on sandwich       
 courses. Not all their time is spent  
 studying,for the University has a     
 large sports complex.The centre has a 
 rock climbing wall,nets for cricket   
 and courts for basketball,squash,     
 badminton,volleyball,five side        
 football etc.There is even a weight   
 training area.A floodlit all weather  
 surface provides for outside sport.   </content>
