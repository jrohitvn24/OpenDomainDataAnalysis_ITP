		<content>  The site also includes the mill      
 owners house,which dates from the late
 18th.Century.In was damaged in the    
 floods of 1852 and the front had to be
 re built.There is an entry in the     
 Alfrick School log for1929 which tells
 that children had to travel home in a 
 lorry, due to flooding in the area.   
 One of the outbuildings, used in the  
 past for storage, is now known as the 
 "elephant house" because in the last  
 war an elephant was kept there when   
 Chipperfields Circus was billeted in  
 Alfrick.                              
  On the Gunnicks mill site now is the 
 Knapp and Papermill Nature Reserve.   
 The old clover and flour mills and the
 mill owners house are all private     
 homes, not open to the public.The old 
 mill wheels and other items of        
 machinery are still intact,but again  
 are not available for public viewing. </content>
