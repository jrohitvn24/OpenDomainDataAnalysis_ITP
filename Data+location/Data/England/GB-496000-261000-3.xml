		<title>03THE RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The railway, now operated by British  
 Rail, runs through the area at two    
 different levels.  The{upper line,    
 running through a deep cutting, was   
 built first by a private railway      
 company to provide a link between     
 London and Derby.                     
 The lower line with the{tunnel}was    
 built later to provide an easier      
 gradient for the trains.  The         
 construction of the tunnel, one of    
 the longest in existence at the time, 
 resulted in the deaths of three       
 workers.  One of them, John Jones,    
 fell down number five shaft and was   
 found to be dead when brought to the  
 surface. Some of the railwaymen are   
 buried in Souldrop churchyard and one 
 of the graves is marked with an iron  
 cross.  It may be the ghost of one of 
 these workers that haunts the house   
 in Souldrop High Street.              </content>
