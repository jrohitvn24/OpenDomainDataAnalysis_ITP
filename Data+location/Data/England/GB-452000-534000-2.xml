		<title>02A Visit to my Gran</title>
		<content>{The Headland H/Pool By Chris Roose }  
 When I wentto visit my Gran she showed
 me pictures of my Grandad who is now  
 dead.She showed me several pictures of
 my Aunty dancing.She also showed me 3 
 scrolls of events that happened around
 1898-1932.She has a copy of the H/pool
 Mail,our local daily,dating from      
 1977-that year the{Queen came to visit
{H/pool.}She showed me pictures from   
 one of the{Headland Carnivals,}which  
 my mam was in,and also pictures of my 
 mam and dad's wedding.Sometimes my    
 Gran goes to the bowling green on     
 Friar Terrace where she sits on the   
 benches and watches the people playing
 bowls.On Sundays she goes to church   
 and comes to our house for dinner.The 
 next Sunday she goes to my Aunty's.   
 Sometimes she goes to the cemetery on 
 Sundays because that is where my      
 Grandad is buried.                    </content>
