		<content> Our language has been build in layers 
 and our words are all mixed together  
 so often in a single sentence that we 
 say words that come from different    
 layers.                               
{"MY MOTHER RECEIVED A GOOD TELEGRAM." 
{MOTHER}comes from an old word which   
        is of Indo-European origin     
{RECEIVED}is of Latin origin           
{GOOD  }is an old teutonic or Anglo-   
        Saxon word                     
{TELEGRAM}comes from Greek             
 Teutonic words are the framework of   
 our language. After the teutonic, the 
 most important influences are from    
 Latin or direct from French,Spanish or
 Italian. They are more polished and   
 polite than teutonic words. The       
 Normans who spoke French came over and
 conquered England and ruled over the  
 Teutonic people and the Anglo-Saxons  
 who lived here.                       </content>
