		<title>19LOCAL HISTORY_MRS DARK</title>
		<content>{ Mrs Dark}has lived in{St Merryn }for 
{33}years.The houses were not so modern
 when she first moved to St Merryn,they
 didnt have any central heating or any 
 electric gadgets as we do today.Mrs   
 Dark used to use oil lamps,open       
 fires,candles and a stove.At first    
 there were no{bungalows}at Harlyn     
 Road nor were there any bungalows at  
 Donkey Park or Parc Eglos.There were 2
 shops at the cross roads and the roads
 were not Tarmacked.Trethithic Estate  
 didn't exist until after the          
 Second World War and there            
 were no houses along the road by the  
 school.The cottages down at church    
 town and the cottages on the left as  
 you go to Trethithic Estate are the   
 oldest in St.Merryn.
