		<title>07A LOCAL FARMERS STORY</title>
		<content> The farmer we went to see had been    
 farming all his life and he has been  
 living in this farm for 28 years.     
 He told us in 1935 wheat was 3/6d     
 which is about 18p.You could buy one  
 cow for Â£12.00 in 1937 but if you buy 
 one now it is Â£500.                   
 Most of the crops grown around this   
 area are corn barley and wheat.       
 You can tell the difference between   
 different sheep because they have a   
 blue mark on the ear or both ears     
 split.Most farmers feed their animals 
 on grass and hay.                     
 The farmer we went to see had four    
 tractors and he uses them to plow and 
 work on the land.Two of the modern    
 machines that are used today are Flat 
 Eight and the Combine Harvester.Most  
 farmers have trouble with vandals.    
 They leave gates open and chase       
 animals around the farm.              </content>
