		<title>17MELSONBY-The Playing Field</title>
		<content>  The playing field  which covers about
 1\ acres  is  on  land  owned  by  the
 Richmondshire  District  Council.   It
 adjoins the land used as allotments.  
                                       
 There  are  no  longer  any  organised
 cricket  or  football   teams  in  the
 village but children &amp; teenagers  play
 these  and  other  games  there  on  a
 random basis.The primary schoolchidren
 also use  the  field  for  games  each
 week.                                 
                                       
  Recently, swings have been erected in
 one  corner of  the  field  for use by
 older children.  The  younger children
 have  also  been  given  new swings, a
 see-saw and  climbing frame  but these
 are sited in the  playing area off St.
 James' Close.  The field and play area
 are maintained by the District Council
