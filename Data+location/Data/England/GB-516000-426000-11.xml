 in{Hedon}are 500 per week about 100 of
 them are children.The smallest        
 congregation is for the Methodist     
 church.This is about 35 adults per    
 week.The largest is for the Roman     
 Catholic church but people come from{ 
{Hedon}and surrounding villages.This is
 about 200 per week.St Augustines is   
 about 150 per week but this is just   
 from{Hedon.}The sunday school goes on 
 for an hour except for the church of  
 England which goes on for an hour and 
 a half.The ages they start are three  
 years old for the Methodist church    
 three and a half for the Roman        
 Catholic church and four years for the
 church of England.They do pictures and
 paintings,read and write but as they  
 get older the work gets harder.The    
 congregations are stable but there is 
 a gap with the 15 to 30 year olds.    </content>
