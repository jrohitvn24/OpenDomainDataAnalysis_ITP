		<title>14St. William's Guides in Ince</title>
		<content>The 12th Ince Guide Company meets every
Tuesday in St. William's school. They  
meet from 7.00 to 9.00pm. Miss Southern
is the Leader helped by Mrs Halsall.   
Their activities include singing, doll 
making, story writing and games. Girls 
aged 10-14 are able to join the Guides.
Afterwards they can go on to be Ranger 
Guides until they are 18. All guides   
wear a blue uniform but each Group has 
a different coloured scarf. St.        
William's scarf is red. One of the     
guides' favourite outdoor activities is
camping. They have to put up their own 
tents and do jobs such as peeling pot- 
atoes, helping to cook meals and keep- 
ing everything tidy. At night they     
gather round the camp fire singing     
songs. The guides usually go on two or 
three weekend camps each year but in   
summer they sometimes go for a week.   
Camping is always popular.             </content>
