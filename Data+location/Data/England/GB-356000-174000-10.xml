		<title>10BRISTOL AVON GORGE CLIMBING</title>
		<content> One day in summer I climbed up the    
 Avon Gorge.It took two hours to       
 finish the climb.I climbed up with an 
 expert called Allen.We started off    
 with a rope going through my belt.Then
 we started to climb.Allen went up     
 first,and put little pegs into the    
 cracks in the rock,I then climbed up  
 and took out the pegs.If Allen fell,  
 all I could do was to hold the rope   
 and hope the pegs would'nt snap.It was
 not an easy climb and the rock was    
 very slippery.The last part was the   
 most difficult and the longest.The    
 rock was vertical and there was not   
 big enough cracks to insert the pegs, 
 but we made it.
