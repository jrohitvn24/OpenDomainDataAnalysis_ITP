		<title>18VILLAGE LIFE IN TRETHURGY</title>
		<content> With few exceptions, the majority of  
 villagers are the first generation to 
 live in Trethurgy. To them village    
 life offers the advantages of peace,  
 privacy, freedom and cheap housing.   
                                       
 Disadvantages include the lack of     
 amenities, this especially affects the
 youth. There is a village institute,  
 but this caters mainly for the older  
 generation, with the main event being 
 the annual Fruit and Vegetable Show.  
                                       
 Most people depend on China Clay,     
 either directly or indirectly as a    
 source of income. There are a number  
 of small holdings, with three family- 
 run beef farms, of about 25-50 acres, 
 but these do not bring in enough money
 and the owners have to work elsewhere 
 to supplement their income.
