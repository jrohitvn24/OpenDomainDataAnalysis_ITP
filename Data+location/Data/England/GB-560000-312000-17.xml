		<title>17Joanna's house.</title>
		<content> Joanna is a pupil at the local school,
 who lives in one of the better houses 
 in the area. Another pupil writes:    
                                       
 In Joanna's house you can see the     
 stairs. She has a big garden and a    
 stable. She used to have a horse - it 
 was white. Joanna has a brother and a 
 sister.                               
                                       
 When I went to Joanna's birthday party
 a long time ago, it was different to  
 now because she used to have a door in
 the room and you used to go through it
 and there were a lot of seats just    
 like you have on a picnic.            
                                       
 There are a lot of bedrooms in the    
 house and the bathroom is ever so nice
 and big. Joanna's mum is a teacher at 
 our school.
