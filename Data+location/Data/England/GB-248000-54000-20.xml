    Greenbank is the site of one of    
 plymouths ambulance stations. There   
 are plans for a central station by the
 end of the century. There are twenty  
 ambulances of various types, including
 a driver.The men work in groups of 6  
 to 8 men on one of four shifts.       
{GENERAL PRACTICE}                     
    We identified a total of nineteen  
 doctors working in ten practices. Only
 one had a purpose built surgery.      
    We also identified fourteen        
 dentists working in twelve practices, 
 three chiropracters working in two    
 practices, three chiropodists working 
 independently and four                
 physiotherapists also working on their
 own. The last three categories come   
 into the private sector.
