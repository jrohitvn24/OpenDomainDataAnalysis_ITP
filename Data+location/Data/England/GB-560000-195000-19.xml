		<title>19The Grid Substation,Hutton</title>
		<content> The grid  substation in our area      
 seemed a good place to visit.Nobody   
 works there full time but it is       
 visited regularly.It was built there  
 so that it would power the railway.   
  It is inspected once a month and each
 piece of equipment has a duplicate.   
 Sometimes electricity cables get      
 covered with ice and the poles fall   
 down due to the weight.These poles    
 which carry the cables are made from  
 red fir grown in Scandiniava and they 
 have to be creosoted for protection.  
 Each tree will have grown for between 
 40 to 50 years.One of the poles had   
 10m 29cm 1985 printed about 2m above  
 the ground.The first numbers say how  
 long the pole is and the last the year
 it was made.Each pole goes 2m into the
 ground.The transformers made a humming
 sound,the bigger they are the deeper  
 and louder the sound will be.         </content>
