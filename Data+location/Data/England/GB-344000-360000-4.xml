		<title>04Other landowners SW.Cheshire</title>
		<content> Beside the Grosvenor Estate the       
 other main landowners in the area     
 appear small even though they too     
 farm &amp; rent out land &amp; houses eg.     
 Coldharbour Farm is rented from a     
 Major Collier.The family of Lord      
 Woolley owns land around Hatton House 
 &amp; Hatton Hall, whilst Hatton farm &amp;   
 the 18 acres of Milners Heath farm are
 owned by another family &amp; operated as 
 one unit.Some of the houses are owner-
 occupied eg.some renovated cottages on
 Long Lane which retain some of their  
 original character &amp; in Gatesheath is 
 a row of smart 1960's detached houses 
 with garages but here also is a small 
 estate of semi-detached council houses
 owned by Chester City,all with the    
 same colour paint &amp; a separate garage 
 block.It is noticeable that people off
 the Grosvenor Estate will more readily
 give information about themselves.    </content>
