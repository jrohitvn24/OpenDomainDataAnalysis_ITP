		<content>        We are great supporters of     
 Preston North End Football Club. Our  
 names are Farouk and Sajid and we live
 in the Deepdale area of Preston, quite
 near to the football ground.          
        We are proud of our club which 
 has played good football since 1881.  
 They were the first club to win not   
 only the F.A. Cup, but also the the   
 League Championship in the same year, 
 1889.                                 
        In the 1950's they had a good  
 international player called Tom Finney
 who is now President of the club.     
        Today, however, Preston are    
 struggling. They are in the Fourth    
 Division this season for the first    
 time in their history.
