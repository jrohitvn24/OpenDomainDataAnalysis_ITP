		<title>01HALL GARTH</title>
		<content> In Hall Garth there are 8 houses and 5
 more are under construction. One of   
 the houses has 12 chimneys and once it
 was a very big farm house with 100    
 acres of land. The people who lived in
 it, when it was built had 12 fire     
 places and that is why it has 12      
 chimneys . A lot of people say that it
 is haunted by the lady that lived in  
 it when it was built. A long time ago 
 a young man fell in love with a young 
 lady and he asked her to marry him.   
 But the lady's father was a very rich 
 man and he said that he could not     
 marry his daughter until he had built 
 a house with 12 chimneys. So he did   
 and the lady  is said to have died in 
 it and now she haunts it.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
