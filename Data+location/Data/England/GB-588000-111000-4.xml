		<title>04PETT LEVEL RESCUE BOAT I</title>
		<content> Pett Level runs a totally-voluntary   
 inshore{rescue boat.} It was funded at
 the New Beach Club in 1970 and is now 
 a registered charity.  Annual         
 maintenance is Â£4000.  Friends of Pett
 Level Rescue Boat help by paying an   
 annual membership fee.  Each year a   
 money-raising Open Day is held at the 
{'Smuggler' Pub.} Now they have an Avon
 Searider boat with a 50 HP mercury    
 engine, a Landrover and launch        
 vehicle, a boathouse and ramp         
 constructed by crew members. The boat 
 is on constant call. Emergency calls  
 increase each year. They assist the   
 R.N.L.I. flank stations at Rye and    
 Hastings. Exercises are held with     
 R.A.F., R.N.L.I. and Coastguard.
