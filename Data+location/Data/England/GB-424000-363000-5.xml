		<content> My Mum's day starts at 7.00am. First  
 she milks the cows, then she wakes me 
 up. She takes me to school in the car.
 Back home she feeds the calves, cleans
 out the cow shed and washes down the  
 dairy. When milk has been collected   
 she cleans out the bulk tank. For some
 of the day she does the housework and 
 bakes or irons.  After tea she helps  
 Dad to milk, and feed the calves      
 again, and wash down the dairy.       
  My Dad is a fluor spar miner at      
 Stoney Middleton. When he works early 
 morning shift he gets up at 5.15am. He
 enjoys farming and loves the animals. 
 He does the walling and hedging, helps
 mum to milk the cows.                 
  I leave for school at 8.30am. My     
 brother, who goes to Lady Manner      
 Comprehensive school Bakewell catches 
 the 8.35am. service bus.
