		<content>   In March 1983 Mr Ted Windsor, a     
small holder converted his pig sties   
into 7 small industrial units. 5 rural 
industries operate from them.          
Floor Pride Textiles started in        
September 1983 and used three units.   
A. Thompson started Car Restorations in
December 1984. J.D.R. Fabrications came
in February 1985, followed by Gun Safe 
in March 1985. There is also a barn    
where a thatcher Mr.M.Davies, stores   
his raw materials of reed and sedge.   
Floor Pride Textiles makes sweat       
shirts. They design the garments and   
make the patterns. They cut the        
materials with an electric knife. The  
garments are overlooked by out-workers 
who live within a 35 mile radius of the
factory. At the factory designs are    
screen-printed on to the garments.     
Three ladies and four men work there.  
They make 3,600 garments weekly.       </content>
