		<content>  Shelford Manor and surrounding lands,
 owned by the Crown,but leased to the  
 Chatterton family for the last 45yrs.,
 is the only other historical building 
 of note in Shelford.                  
  Once a priory and later the last     
 Royalist stronghold to be burnt down  
 in the Civil War,the manor was        
 restored from the original stone in   
 1670.There are 22 rooms in the house, 
 although 6 on the top floor are no    
 longer used.                          
  The present occupants,father,mother  
 and two children,have lived in the    
 manor for 5yrs. They farm 450 acres   
 and keep a dairy herd,as well as      
 growing corn,potatoes and sugarbeet.  
 They keep horses for pleasure,not as a
 business proposition.The Chattertons  
 enjoy 3 day eventing and hunting with 
 the Belvoir hunt.
