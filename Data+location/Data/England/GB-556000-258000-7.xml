		<title>07A FEN EDGE FARMHOUSE</title>
		<content>    Chalk Farm, as its name suggests,  
 stands on an area of chalk soil, in   
 the north-west of the area.           
    The farm belongs to the Church     
 Commissioners and is leased to the    
 tenant farmer. His family have lived  
 in the area for about two hundred     
 years and have been tenants here for  
 about ninety years. The present tenant
 was born at Chalk Farm.               
    The farmhouse was built in about   
 1810 out of local Cambridgeshire      
 'white bricks' which are made from    
 gault clay. It has a slate roof and   
 sash windows.                         
    There are several large barns, one 
 of which contains a wall made out of  
 'clunch', the name given to hard white
 chalk blocks which are found locally.
