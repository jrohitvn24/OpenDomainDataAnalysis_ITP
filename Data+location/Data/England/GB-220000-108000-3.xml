		<content>  Scaghill Farm is 215 acres in size.It
 is mostly pasture with some barley and
 corn fields.The farm has 105 cows     
 mostly Friesians and 1 heifer, 52     
 sheep, 12 lambs, and some poultry.    
 There are 9 buildings and 25 fields.  
 The farm produces milk which goes to  
{Torrington.}It also produces meat     
 since{E.E.C}quotas have limited milk  
 production.Mr. Dingle like many       
 farmers is not happy about this.      
    The farm has a{herringbone parlour 
 which takes 6 cows at a time.It has a{
{computerized feeding system}which     
 gives each cow the right amount of    
 food and stops the cow overeating.    
 There is also a machine that shreads  
 the food for the cows.There are 3     
 tractors, a combine-harvester, a      
 bailer, a silager and a thresher.
