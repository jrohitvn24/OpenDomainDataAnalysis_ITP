		<title>02Geography of Weston and Area</title>
		<content> The{landscape}of this area is mainly  
 agricultural land with scattered      
 farms.  There are four small patches  
 of{woodland:}Weston Wood (which is    
 owned by the Forestry Commission),    
 Park Copse, Meizen Copse and          
 Blackleys.  The land is fairly flat   
 and low lying; the average height     
 above sea level being about 65 metres.
 There are several small{streams}which 
 drain southwards to the River Ray.    
 The underlying{soils}are mainly clays.
                                       
 The area is dominated by two busy{main
{roads;}the A43 Oxford to Northampton  
 Road and the A421 to Bicester which   
 branches off it just south of Weston. 
 The only other roads are quiet country
 lanes. The{railway line}from Bicester 
 to Oxford crosses the area as do many 
{public footpaths}including the Oxford-
 shire Way which passes through Weston.</content>
