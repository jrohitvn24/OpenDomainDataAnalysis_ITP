 used to be known dates back to the    
 Middle Ages, when mummers would       
 collect eggs as payment for their     
 performance.                          
   The "Pasch" or peace eggs were      
 brightly-coloured and held to be      
 symbolic of Christ's resurrection at  
 Easter.

 performance of the old-time mummers,  
 who, in one of the most ancient forms 
 of drama, mimed a primitive pagan rite
 of the renewal of life, as winter gave
 way to spring. From the Middle Ages   
 onwards, the heroes are St George and 
 the other patron saints; the villains 
 are the Turkish, or other East        
 Mediterranean, enemies in the period
