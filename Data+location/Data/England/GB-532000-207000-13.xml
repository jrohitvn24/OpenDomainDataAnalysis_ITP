		<title>13SAND PIT, HODDESDON.</title>
		<content> Situated immediately to the west of   
 the Al0 road &amp; north of the site of   
 Broxbournebury School the sand pit    
 owned by the St. Albans Sand &amp; Gravel 
 Company extends to approx. 60 acres.  
 The material excavated is a rough     
 hoggin. Excavation at the present     
 rate, 2 full-time &amp; 2 part-time men   
 are employed there, is expected to    
 continue for a further 4/5 years &amp; the
 Company do not have plans to extend at
 present. Nothing of interest, either  
 geologically or historically has been 
 uncovered but the Pit did provide     
 basic material used in l972/3 in the  
 foundations of the adjacent Al0 major 
 road. The excavation of this site     
 means that a valuable amenity becomes 
 available in the form of a land infill
 and rubbish disposal area.
