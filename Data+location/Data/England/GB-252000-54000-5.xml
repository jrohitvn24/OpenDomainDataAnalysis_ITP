		<title>05My Views on Plympton</title>
		<content>    I think there should be more shops 
 in Plympton. More clothes shops are   
 needed so people do not have to go    
 into Plymouth to buy clothes. I think 
 we should have more leisure centres.  
 We have a couple of parks and a youth 
 club in Plympton but no swimming pool.
   There are a lot of bungalows in     
 Plympton used by old people. There are
 also a lot of old peoples homes in    
 Plympton. These include St Vincents,  
 St Elizabeths, and the Castle         
 Barbican.                             
   There are lots of schools in this   
 area, but they are all very crowded.  
 We should have more schools in        
 Plympton, bigger schools and more     
 teachers.
