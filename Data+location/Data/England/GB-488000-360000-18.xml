 --------------------------------------
           Bassingham is a very old    
 established community.Many local and  
 American families have had links with 
 the area for generations.Visitors can 
 often be seen retracing the steps of  
 their{ancestors.}A churchyard worth   
 visiting is Aubourn.All that remains  
 of the nineteenth century church is   
 the clock tower.                      
       Bed and Breakfast is available  
 at a farmhouse on the A46-Fosse Way-  
 On leaving the Fosse Way the area is  
 criss-crossed with quiet country lanes
 making it ideal for{cyclists.}Fine    
 steaks and various bar{meals}are      
 available at the Five Bells Inn at    
 Bassingham.During recent modernisation
 a 200 year old well was unearthed and 
 this is now an integral feature of the
 very attractive lounge.               </content>
