		<content> Life/styles are increasingly being    
 invaded by computers. They put people 
 out of work because they do the job   
 better. There are various languages   
 for computers such as BASIC (beginners
 all symbolic instruction code),Fourth,
 Pascal,Logo and Hexadecimal.          
 We have colour television and watch   
 it a lot. Images are still produced   
  via electron beams which are fired at
 the screen.There are three electron   
 beams of different colours: red,green 
 and blue.                             
 We have thought a lot about cloning   
 and the prospects it may bring  around
 in the future.We have already cloned  
 rabbits and other animals but never   
 people but we may be able to clone    
 animals that are already extinct.
