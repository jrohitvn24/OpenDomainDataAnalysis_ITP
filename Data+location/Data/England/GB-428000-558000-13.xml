		<title>13FARMING: GATESHEAD</title>
		<content> The owner of{High House Farm,}Wardley 
 has 132 acres of land, 126 arable and 
 the remaining 6 meadowland.  The farm 
 only produces{wheat,}but at one time  
 reared cattle.  The two farm houses   
 have been standing since the 1850's.  
{Modern machinery}includes a large     
 tractor and a combine harvester.      
    The busiest time of year is in     
 August at harvesting time.            
    Five other farms surround High     
 House Farm, so most of the area is    
 under cultivation.                    
   {Springwell Village}is surrounded by
 a narrow band of farmland.  This land 
 is for grazing beef cattle or for     
 barley{production.} No cow's milk is  
 produced but a small amount of goat's 
 milk is.  A few free range hens are   
 kept and their eggs are sold in the   
 village.                              
                                       </content>
