		<title>15Sewage Works-Dorking NE</title>
		<content>  The sewage works are in Box Hill     
 Valley,so the sewage drains down from 
 high level places and is pumped up    
 from lower level places.              
  The works treat on average four-five 
 thousand cubic meters of sewage a day,
 from a population of 25,0000.20% of   
 sewage comes from a large abbatoir    
 and the the rest from domestic use.   
  The fumes from the works are often   
 smelt in the local area on hot humid  
 days.                                 
  At the screening house and pumping   
 station,rags and wood are removed.Then
 the{detritus}(sand and grit)is removed
 in a circular settling tank.Next,the  
 sewage is broken down by{microbes,   }
 leaving only gasses and water.The     
 microbes are removed in a final       
 settling tank,and the clean water     
 flows into the{River Mole.            
  The sludge is sent to local farms.   </content>
