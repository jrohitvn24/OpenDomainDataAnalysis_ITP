 One of the pillars is 951 years old   
and part of the original church. The   
present church is 758 years old. There 
is a pulpit where the priest speaks and
a lectern for bible readings. The font 
is still used for baptisms and you will
find it next to the round pillar in the
North aisle. There is a service each   
Sunday (at 11.00). The priest in charge
is Rev. Prof Frend and he wears a      
black coat under a white surplice with 
a university hood around his neck.     
Coming into church he follows the choir
into their places. Amy and Lizzy are in
the choir. There is a ladies choir and 
a mens choir. Under the East window is 
the altar with a white cloth and two   
candles on it. Princess Alice goes     
every week. I some times go to church.
