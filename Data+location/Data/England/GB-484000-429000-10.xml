		<title>10Customs.The Raft Race.</title>
		<content>  On August Bank  Holiday Monday, it is
 a tradition in Newport,for teams from 
 various local clubs,to make and enter 
 a raft for the annual raft race on the
 canal.Stalls are situated by the side 
 of the canal selling all manner of    
 produce.People are encouraged to buy  
 small bags of flour to throw at the   
 teams as they paddle the rafts towards
 the finishing line.A greasy pole put  
 across the canal,results in friendly  
 pushing with some people falling into 
 the canal.                            
  The local riding school brings ponies
 to give rides.To add to the carnival  
 scene,decorated floats are driven     
 through the village.They are decorated
 by local organizations,such as the    
 Brownies.The festival day finishes    
 with a fancy dress disco in the       
 recreation hall in the evening.The day
 raises money for local charities.     </content>
