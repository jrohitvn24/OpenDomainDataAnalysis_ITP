		<content>{Alex Arnell writes -}In 1979 we bought
 Hill House for Â£13000. It had two bed-
 rooms above two living rooms and had a
 chemical closet in a small garden shed
 It had mains electricity and rate-free
 water. An old range was used for the  
 cooking and heating. A wash house held
 a cast-iron tub with fireplace beneath
{We built an extension}- lounge, 2 bed-
 rooms, bathroom, shower-room, integral
 garage. We renovated existing rooms   
 and equipped the kitchen with electric
 cooker, dishwasher, 'frig and freezer,
 and washing machine. One of our two   
 wood-burning stoves heats water and   
 there is oil-fired central heating.   
 Walls, loft and under-floor are all   
 insulated. Today the house is worth   
 Â£50,000-Â£60,000. The extension cost us
 approx. Â£20,000 but it would have cost
 considerably more if we had not done  
 most of the work ourselves.           </content>
