		<title>11Religion in Middleton</title>
		<content> At one time, Middleton by Youlgrave   
 was a strongly non-conformist village.
 Now only the Anglican church remains  
 an active place of worship. Services  
 are held twice a month with one       
 evensong and one Holy Communion.      
 Experimental liturgy is being         
 introduced in the hope of reversing   
 the decline in attendance. The        
 presence of{Arbor Low}within the area 
 adds a further religious dimension.   
 Whether or not the stone circle was   
 originally a mystical site, it is now 
 used for certain rites on Midsummer   
 morning. As at Stonehenge, dawn on the
 summer solstice is greeted by ceremony
 in the druidic tradition. The former  
 Congregational Chapel is a house and  
 the former Primitive Methodist Chapel 
 was moved away to become a mine       
 office. The mine had much trouble     
 thereafter.                           </content>
