		<content> There has been a CHURCH in Whipsnade  
 since Anglo Saxon times,the present   
 one since the 16th Century.Standing   
 just off the picturesque village green
 it is built in brick,the earliest in  
 the Tower are Roman.Extensive         
 restoration work has been done in the 
 last few years costing over Â£35,000.A 
 new peal of bells has been installed. 
 There are 53 names on the Electoral   
 Roll &amp; each Sunday about 25 people    
 attend services.The TREE CATHEDRAL was
 the brain child of Maj.E.K.Blyth who  
 planted it in memory of 3 friends     
 killed during the l914-18 war.It is in
 the shape of a cathedral with nave,   
 spring,easter,winter &amp; lady chapel,   
 cloisters,all grown with appropriate  
 trees.There are services for any      
 denomination.It now belongs to the    
 National Trust with a part time warden
 &amp; voluntary workers keeping it tidy.  </content>
