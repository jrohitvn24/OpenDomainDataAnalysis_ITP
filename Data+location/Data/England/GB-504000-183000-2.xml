		<title>02Local History in Uxbridge</title>
		<content> The name Uxbridge means the bridge    
 over the Wixan.The Wixan were a saxon 
 tribe and the bridge was over the     
 River Colne,their boundary.The Crown  
 and Treaty inn dates back to the 16th 
 century and behind it is the Treaty   
 House,where the commissioners of      
 Charles I met representatives of      
 Parliament to sue unsuccessfully for  
 peace.A painting hanging in the Civic 
 Centre,shows a banquet that resolved a
 quarrel between the local townsfolk   
 and the Countess of Derby over market 
 tolls.In 1798 the Grand Junction Canal
 was opened increasing trade for       
 Uxbridge.In 1936 only one bus ran     
 through Uxbridge,unlike today.In the  
 1970s the new Civic Centre was built.
