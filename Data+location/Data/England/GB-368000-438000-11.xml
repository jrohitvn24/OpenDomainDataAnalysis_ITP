		<content>   As a Catholic, Richard Shireburne   
 was reported to Elizabeth 1 in 1591 as
 a recusant who did not attend the     
 Protestant Church and who was a spy   
 for the Lancashire Catholics. A house 
 (Stonyhurst College) was begun in     
 1594. Oliver Cromwell is reported to  
 have slept at Stonyhurst College on   
 the night before the Battle of Preston
 in 1648. The bridge over the Lower    
 Hodder still bears the name           
 "Cromwell's Bridge".                  
   In 1717 the male-line of the        
 Shireburnes died out and, on the death
 of Mary Shireburne, the estates passed
 to the Weld family of Lulworth. The   
 house remained empty for 40 years     
 until Thomas Weld, an ex-scholar of   
 the Jesuit Fathers, gave the house to 
 the Society of Jesus who had been     
 expelled from Belgium in 1794. This   
 was the start of Stonyhurst College.  </content>
