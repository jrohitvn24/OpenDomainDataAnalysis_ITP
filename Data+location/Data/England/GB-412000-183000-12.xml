 There are 4 areas of open land in Old 
 Town. The town gardens,Queen's park,  
 the Lawns and Croft woods. The town   
 gardens are kept by 20 gardeners and  
 it has a bowling-green, bandstand,    
 open-air theatre and kiddies          
 playground. On the Lawns are 2 lakes  
 with swans and ducks, large areas of  
 trees and open grassland left fairly  
 wild. A mansion-house stands in the   
 area and was mentioned in the first   
 Domesday Book. Queen's park has a lake
 and a heated greenhouse with exotic   
 plants.                               
 Bluebells cover the ground like a blue
 mist in Croft woods in the spring.    
 Building is taking place on the edge  
 but there is still a lot of woodland  
 left. Many people walk their dogs     
 there and children play and make dens.
