		<content>    The original Pelham Wood was oak   
 planted in 1787 north east of the     
 present Pelham's Pillar.              
    There are 150 deer living in the   
 wood, the original deer escaped into  
 the woods in 1940.A hole was blown    
 into the retaining wall during a      
 mortar shell practice.The deer escaped
 and bred to their present number.     
    Just before the D Day invasion the 
 U.S.A. army stored armed cars in the  
 woods.This area lies in the extreme   
 north-east of our block.Concrete roads
 were established and inspection pits  
 built for the maintenance of the      
 vehicles.Although the dump was not    
 secret few people knew of its         
 existance.The tenant of a local farm  
 was responsible for its organisation. 
    Race horses were trained on a ride 
 in the wood which stretched from      
 Pelham's Pillar to Foxdale Wood.      </content>
