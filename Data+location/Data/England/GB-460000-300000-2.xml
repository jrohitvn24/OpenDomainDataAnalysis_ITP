		<content>  Leicester City Wildlife Project is   
 part of Leicestershire and Rutland    
 Trust of Nature Conservation.It looks 
 after plants and animals in the city. 
  The city has become more important   
 for conservation since modern         
 agricultural machinery is ripping up  
 hedgerows,cutting down woods,draining 
 ponds,spraying herbicides and         
 pesticides in the pursuit of more     
 productive farming.                   
  Watch is a nationwide group for young
 people.It aims to help children be    
 more aware of the neighbourhood and   
 how man changes the environment.      
 Projects are hard work but good fun.  
 In Knighton Spinney Watch has planted 
 more hazel trees and has had a        
 sponsored bird watch.The next project 
 is a butterfly survey.
