		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MRS. ELSIE MOSS  
 The post brings my Community Health   
 Council papers to study, these include
 a document on Personal Health, with   
 the problem of Drug Abuse a prominent 
 paragraph; also a paper on Community  
 Care for the Elderly to cope with the 
 increasing numbers in the area.       
 Today is the annual dinner held in the
 Methodist Church, cooked and provided 
 by a Roman Catholic couple. The       
 proceeds are to help running costs of 
 the Church room which is used as a    
 Community centre for the Parish. My   
 job is to lay the tables and decorate 
 with roses and chrysanthemums.        
 This work took 7 hours but the dinner 
 was a great success and an excellent  
 slide show followed of early farming  
 practices in the upper dale, using    
 sepia photographs; ending with slides 
 of flowers butterflies and animals.   </content>
