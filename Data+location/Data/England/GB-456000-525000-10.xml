		<title>10A Headteacher's Day</title>
		<content> He gets up at approx. 7.20am then gets
 shaved, washed and makes the bed. For 
 breakfast he has toast, muesli, fresh 
 orange and black coffee. At 8.15am he 
 leaves for school.                    
 A typical day at school is hectic.    
 People coming with four things at once
 and the telephone always ringing. At  
 lunchtime he supervises dinners, has  
 his own, helps in the school bookshop 
 or sees people. He'll then have a five
 minute chat in the staffroom. He goes 
 home between 4.15 and 5pm. Then he    
 goes to his study to do some work. His
 wife likes cooking, so tea is very    
 varied, although his favourite meal is
 egg and chips. He then watches The    
 News till 6.30. The dogs are taken out
 until 7.30 then he'll return to his   
 study. The rest of the evening is     
 usually spent watching television or  
 gardening. He goes to bed at 11.15pm. </content>
