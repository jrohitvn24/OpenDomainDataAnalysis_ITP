		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JOANNE BATEMAN   
 Every morning from Monday to Friday I 
 get up at around 7.40am.I go          
 downstairs and have a cup of tea with 
 my family.My dad calls me for         
 breakfast.Usually I have one egg with 
 toast and a drink of Vimto.At 8.55am  
 I set off for school.When I get there 
 I am just in time for registration.   
 Today is Friday we did English Grammar
 and maths.We learnt how to do Venn    
 Diagrams.                             
        At 12.00 it is dinner time.I   
 have a packed lunch of sandwiches,    
 cheese,a biscuit and a drink.At 12.30 
 till 1.15 we have a dinner break.     
 At 3.15pm all the school meets in the 
 hall with the headmaster.At 3.45pm I  
 collect my little sister and we go    
 home.                                 
 I practise on my flute and violin then
 go out to play.                       </content>
