		<title>11The Community Centre</title>
		<content>      The community centre began as a  
 memorial to local people who were     
 killed during the Second World War,   
 and originally consisted of a football
 pitch, a cricket pitch, a few swings  
 and slides, and changing rooms. It is 
 now being extended to include tennis  
 courts and an all-weather playing     
 area. Plans for the future include a  
 village hall for Disco's, Whist       
 Drives, shows and other activities    
 which, it is hoped, will involve all  
 local people. The funding is being    
 raised mainly by the efforts of the   
 people themselves, one of the efforts 
 being a Gala which it is intended     
 will become an annual event, and      
 inludes a fell-race which the         
 organizers hope will eventually be of 
 national or even international        
 standard.
