      Village cricket has long been a  
 part of our country's tradition and   
 Kimblesworth is no exception.         
      A cricket team was formed in 1879
 and was known as The Kimblesworth     
 Miners Welfare Cricket Club. This team
 was one of the founder members of the 
 North-West Durham Cricket League.     
 There were 11 other village teams in  
 this league and all were connected and
 supported by the collieries of the    
 area. The Kimblesworth club have had  
 several successful years - being      
 League Cup winners in 1936, 1937,     
 1938, 1951 and 1958.                  
      During the 106 years this club   
 has been in existence it has had only 
 6 professional players, relying on    
 members born and living in the        
 village.                              </content>
