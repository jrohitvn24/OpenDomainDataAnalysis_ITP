		<title>18ROKEBY CHURCH</title>
		<content>    The present{church}of Rokeby was   
 built in 1750.There are only two other
 churches like Rokeby in the world.    
    This Georgian church is built with 
 the altar facing North,instead of     
 East,as is usual in other churches.The
 other churches similar in architecture
 and lay out are in Gwynedd and        
 Tasmainia.                            
    Mr.Harrison is not the rector but  
 only the priest in charge which he    
 became in 1967.He thinks of his church
 as small but impressive.The church    
 which is Church of England is in the  
 parish of Rokeby with Brignall.       
    The oaken font originally was a    
 torch holder and stands in a corner.  
 Some of the stones from the old church
 in nearby Mortham were used to build  
 the new Rokeby Church.
