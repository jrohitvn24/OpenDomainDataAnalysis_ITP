		<content>   We are surrounded by daisies and    
 buttercups ,I can hear a tractor      
 clattering ,about sixty birds have    
 just flown over .The tractor seems to 
 be coming closer by the sound.There's 
 about eight houses near us.A lorry    
 has just turned into a farm.To my     
 right there is a caravan site with    
 about fifty vans.In a garden near us  
 there is a man building a shed.       
                                       
 The roaring of a tractor's engine     
 broken by the speech of Mrs. Yates.   
 Crows squawking,I can see a caravan   
 park across the field and two old     
 sinks.Across the lane I can see Kestle
 Farm.I'm surrounded by hundreds of    
 daisies I can hear the rippling       
 stream,and the occasional sparkle of  
 the sun through the trees.I can see   
 the slates of a house.In my sight is a
 church and an old fashioned plough.   </content>
