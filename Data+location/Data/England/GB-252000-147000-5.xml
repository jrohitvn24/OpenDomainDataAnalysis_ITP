		<title>05    WATERMOUTH CASTLE</title>
		<content> Watermouth castle was built in the    
 1820s and has belonged to the present 
 owner,Mr Haines,since 1977.The castle 
 was in poor condition and Mr Haines   
 improved it and opened it to the      
 public in 1978.He is still making     
 changes today.When we visited,we saw  
 many interesting rooms.There was an   
 old music room,an old Victorian       
 kitchen,an old amusement arcade and   
 dungeons full of fairy tale and       
 smuggling scenes,that came to life    
 when you pressed a button.If you      
 stand in the castle grounds and look  
 across,you can see Watermouth         
 Cove,that once belonged to the castle 
 It was a famous smuggling cove but    
 today it is a harbour for small boats 
 with a yacht club.There is a large    
 caravan site open in the summer months
 and there are discos for visitors and 
 locals.                               </content>
