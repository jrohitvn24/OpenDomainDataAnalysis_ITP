		<title>06A Family Day.</title>
		<content> At 8'o clock I got up,washed and      
 dressed while my mum made the         
 breakfast.My brother and dad were     
 already up.I gave my brother his      
 birthday present and got packed for   
 the trip to the Lake District.My mum  
 left for work at 9'o clock while my   
 dad loaded up the car.At 11'o clock we
 left for the Lakes and arrived there  
 at 1.We had lunch and met our cousin  
 Bonnie,auntie and uncle.After lunch   
 William played in the lake while my   
 dad and I went to Howtown Outdoor     
 Activity Centre to ask permission to  
 film there.When we came back we had   
 tea and went to the pub.My mum came   
 back from work at 10'o clock had tea  
 and went to bed.At half past 10 we    
 came back from the pub and went       
 straight to bed.This was a half-term  
 holiday and father was a teacher,that 
 was why mother could not come with us.</content>
