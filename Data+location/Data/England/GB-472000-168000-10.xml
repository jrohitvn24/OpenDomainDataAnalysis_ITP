		<title>10DAY IN THE LIFE OF G.HUNTER</title>
		<content> I woke up at 7.30 a.m. and read until 
 about 9.00 a.m. For breakfast I had   
 toast.Mum was reading the paper while 
 dad was washing his hair upstairs.It  
 was very quiet without my sister who  
 was at camp with the Brownies. After  
 breakfast my mum saw a Didcot Railway 
 Museum advertisement in the paper.Mum 
 and I checked where it was on the map 
 then we set off.When we got there we  
 bought tickets then went on the steam 
 driven Blue Peter Train.After we had  
 walked around I went train            
 spotting.When the high speed train    
 went past it blew all my papers       
 around.It was starting to rain heavily
 so we went back to the car and had    
 lunch.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
