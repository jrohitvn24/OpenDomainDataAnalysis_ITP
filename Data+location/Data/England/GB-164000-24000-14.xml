		<title>14FARMING -LOWER NANSLOE FARM</title>
		<content> Most of the farms in this area are    
 involved in "mixed farming",that is   
 they keep some animals and grow some  
 crops.A typical farm in this area is  
 Lower Nansloe Farm,run by Mr David    
 Rowe.                                 
 He has two full-time workers and his  
 father to help him.His two sons are   
 still at school.The eldest son is     
 seriously thinking about going to     
 agricultural college.                 
 Much of the land is in grass for      
 grazing,hay and silage for the dairy  
 herd.They also grow some barley for   
 winter feed.The dairy herd is made up 
 of around 100 Friesians.There are also
 a few beef cattle.The Friesians       
 produce about 400 gallons of milk each
 day which is collected by tanker.     
 The farm also grows some potatoes for 
 the early market.Mr Rowe thinks his   
 most useful machine is the tractor.   </content>
