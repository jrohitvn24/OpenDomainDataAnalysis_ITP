		<title>17INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</title>
		<content>   In 1985 the age of modern technology
 has come.Many families have home      
 computers which are used for both     
 educational and entertainment         
 purposes.The range of computers is    
 getting larger and larger.In everyday 
 life the computer is also coming in.In
 some shops,instead of a               
 cash-register,they have small strips  
 over which a light pen is rubbed and  
 the price of the item comes up at the 
 till.In office and business           
 work,technology plays a big part.A lot
 of information is stored on disk for  
 computers.Letters are mainly printed  
 on word processors which are much     
 quicker than manual typewriters.In    
 factories computers and robots are    
 coming in more and more and replacing 
 the jobs of many workers.Industrial   
 work is worked alot by computers      
 as well.                              </content>
