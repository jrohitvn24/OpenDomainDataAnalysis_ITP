		<content> The main style of architecture in this
 area is 17th/18th Century brick and   
 flint, most of which has been well    
 maintained and sympathetically        
 restored.Several houses whose aspect  
 has been lest changed are now included
 in the Dept of the Environments list  
 of buildings of architectural or      
 historical interest.                  
 There has been some development in    
 this century, small groups of council 
 houses ad some in-filling with small  
 houses and bungalows.                 
 Being such a picturesque area within  
 easy reach of the sea on the South    
 coast. Stonehenge, Salisbury etc to   
 the north, this is a popular area for 
 tourists and there are several holiday
 cottages in the district, but         
 surprisingly perhaps few              
 establishments offering bed and       
 breakfast facilites.                  </content>
