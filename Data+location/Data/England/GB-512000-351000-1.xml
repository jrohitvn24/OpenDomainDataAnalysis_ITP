		<title>01NORTH KYME AND SURROUNDS</title>
		<content> The area that{North Kyme C.P.School   
 has been asked to survey contains the 
{village of North Kyme and parts of    
{Anwick and Ruskington Fens.}The area  
 is basically used for farming,mainly  
 arable with wheat, barley,potatoes,and
 sugar beet being grown. The land is   
 called{Black Fenland}being peat       
 silt.The{Witham peat fens}are the only
 place in Lincolnshire where this kind 
 of land is found.                     
      One of the most important        
 landmarks in the area is the{Car Dyke 
 which was built by the Romans. This is
 said to have been used to drain the   
 silt fens. The dyke actually runs from
 the Waterbeach in Cambridgeshire to   
 the River Witham near Lincoln,a       
 distance of 76 miles.Remains of a     
{Roman tumulus}have been found at the  
 south end of the village of North     
 Kyme.                                 </content>
