		<title>06Local Character-Mr.C.Cox</title>
		<content>    When we wanted to find out some    
 information about the local history of
 our area, most people suggested that  
 we talked to Mr. Charles Cox - and    
 they were right!                      
    For 23 years he served as a        
 councillor on the old Chelmsford RDC  
 and Brentwood DC. For 38 years he has 
 been a member of Ingatestone and      
 Fryerning Parish Council and has been 
 its Vice-Chairman, and a member of    
 many commitees. He joined the Boys'   
 Own Club on its formation in 1919 and 
 in recognition of his services was    
 presented to the Duke of Gloucester in
 1958 and to the present Duke in 1978. 
    He has always cared for the village
 of Fryerning and its Church and has   
 been a member of the choir for 40     
 years.
