		<title>17EDUCATION NEAR SEISDON</title>
		<content>   As there are no schools of any type 
in this block children of all ages have
to travel some distance to school in   
various directions, depending in which 
county they live.                      
   Those in Staffordshire, mostly      
living in Seisdon itself, are taken by 
bus to Wombourne where there are       
schools for all age groups, though     
older children have an alternative     
cnoice in Kinver.   The few children   
who live in the Shropshire half of the 
area have to be taken to school, the   
younger ones to Claverley and the rest 
to Bridgnorth, as there are no school  
buses for them.                        
   Further education is not available  
in the immediate area either and       
students have to travel to Bridgnorth, 
Wolverhampton or even to Stafford for  
this.
