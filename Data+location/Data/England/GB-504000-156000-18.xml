		<title>18RECREATION FACILITIES.</title>
		<content> The area has attracted many residents 
 interested in country pursuits. These 
 include walking, horse-riding,        
 gardening and boating and fishing on  
 the Wey Navigation. Sports facilities 
 range from cricket and tennis to      
 private swimming pools; nearby towns  
 offer many more. Children have no     
 special provision here except play    
 groups and a play ground on Ripley    
 Green, but they don't lack            
 opportunities for recreation nearby.  
 In Ockham there are regular Art       
 classes, Bell-ringing and shooting.   
 Residents are conservation minded and 
 clearing footpaths is one leisure     
 occupation.
