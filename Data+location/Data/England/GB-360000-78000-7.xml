		<content> BEING A CHILD IS MOST ENJOYABLE BUT IT
 HAS ITS PROBLEMS.FOR INSTANCE I HAVE A
 BROTHER AND HE IS ALWAYS GETTING INTO 
 MY ROOM AND MESSING THINGS UP,BROTHERS
 ARE LIKE THAT.I KNOW TWO OR THREE     
 CHILDREN WHO WILL BE GLAD TO LEAVE    
 SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY DONT ENJOY        
 IT.BEING A CHILD IS QUITE NICE,THOUGH 
 YOU OFTEN GET AN ARGUMENT OR          
 TWO,BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE GROWN UP YOU 
 CAN'T REALLY PLAY ON A GO-CART,CAN    
 YOU?I SHOULDN'T THINK GROWN-UPS WOULD 
 LIKE TO GO ON A SKATEBOARD,WOULD      
 YOU? BESIDES, GROWN-UPS DON'T GET SO  
 MANY PRESENTS AT CHRISTMAS TIME, NOT  
 THAT IT MATTERS ANYWAY. I THINK IT'S  
 RATHER AWKWARD TO BE A  PARENT        
 ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO DRIVE   
 THE CHILDREN TO PLACES AND GIVE THEM  
 MONEY ETC. WHAT MUMS AND DADS NEED IS 
 A REST BUT THE PROBLEM IS THEY NEVER  
 GET IT!                               </content>
