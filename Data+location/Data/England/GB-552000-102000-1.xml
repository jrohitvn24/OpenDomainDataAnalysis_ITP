		<content>  The area is predominantly chalk      
 downland  but includes the valley     
 of the River Cuckmere. The villages of
 Alfriston and Wilmington are in the   
 area along with churches at Wilmington
 ,Alfriston,Lullington and Folkington. 
                                       
 Most of the area is farmland,mainly   
 arable with sheep and cattle grazing  
 on the hills. There are many paths    
 over the downs including the South    
 Downs Way.                            
                                       
 Dominating the area is the Long Man   
 of Wilmington which overlooks         
 beautiful village of Wilmington.      
                                       
 There are many timber framed          
 buildings in both Alfriston and       
 Wilmington including the Old Clergy   
 House,Alfriston,the first             
 building owned by the National Trust. </content>
