		<content> The landscape is pleasant with gentle 
 slopes, tiny streams and wide skies.  
 Intensely farmed, it is rather too    
 neat and bare in places, hedges having
 been destroyed to allow for the use of
 ever larger farm machinery. To offset 
 this there is a large shaggy very wet 
 area of unimproved grassland in the   
 northwest corner and an old osier bed 
 has grown into a miniature wilderness 
 between Cratfield and Silverleys      
 Green. On one farm the planting of    
 trees in hedgerows and in odd corners 
 has greatly improved the view to the  
 northeast from Cratfield. Trees have  
 been planted along some road verges   
 recently, but they are as yet too     
 small to affect the landscape. An     
 increase in winter crops has made the 
 prospect in winter much greener than  
 it was and the acid yellow fields of  
 rape brighten the spring.             </content>
