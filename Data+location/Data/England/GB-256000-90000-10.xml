		<title>10TEN TORS TRAINING</title>
		<content> Local teams for the Ten Tors are lucky
 in being able to train on the same    
 ground as the final event. Often      
 weather during training is worse than 
 those during the weekend in May when  
 Ten Tors is held. 1985 was typical in 
 this respect, with the first training 
 session for the local Okehampton      
 College teams being in 'Artic'        
 conditions, in February snow,ice and  
 sleet combine with very strong, cold  
 northerly winds. The whole point of   
 the exercise was summed up by a team  
 members comment after this first day  
 training, "You find out a lot about   
 yourself up there". You also find out 
 a lot about your friends and how to   
 get along in a team. Over the weeks of
 training you also get to know the moor
 in all its different moods; rain, wind
 and shine. A pictures shows Okehampton
 College girls 35mile team finishing.  </content>
