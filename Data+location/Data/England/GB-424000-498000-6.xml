   I have lived at Orchard Cottage,    
 Ellerton, all my life.It is quite an  
 old house.It is built of brick and    
 stone.On the roof there are orange-   
 red tiles,a brick chimney stack and a 
 television aerial which is broken.Our 
 house has no dampcourse because it is 
 old.                                  
   Inside there are seven rooms.They   
 are the living room,the kitchen,three 
 bedrooms,a bathroom and Dad's         
 office.In my Mum's bedroom there is a 
 fire-place which has been blocked up. 
   We have a coal fire which also heats
 the water and the radiators.Another   
 radiator runs on calor gas.           
   Dad built the porch,and he also made
 the garden shed.                      
   We used to have a spare bedroom,but 
 Dad took it over for his collection of
 guns,knives and swords.               </content>
