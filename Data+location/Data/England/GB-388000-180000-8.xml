		<content> For many years Hullavington has had a 
 Carnival during the last week of June,
 culminating in a parade of decorated  
 vehicles leading to a Village Fete.   
 Most of the funds raised by this event
 went to maintain the Community Hall.  
 Unfortunately a lack of helpers led to
 the reduction of the Carnival to a    
 Village Fete &amp; Dance during 1985. A   
 very successful Fete took place at the
 new Primary School on July 6th. All   
 the organisations listed in the       
 Communications page joined in, as did 
 R.A.F. Hullavington &amp; The School.     
 Events included a{Childrens' Fancy    
{Dress Competition, a Pram Race,       
{Country Dancing, a Knobbly Knees      
{Contest &amp; Tug-of-War.}Sideshows &amp;     
 stalls varied from {White Elephant, &amp; 
{Coconut Shy to Hamster Racing &amp;       
{Skittles.}The profit was shared among 
 Hullavington's School, News &amp; Hall.   </content>
