		<title>13Housing in Pembury</title>
		<content> Since World War 2 there has been much 
 building of houses, both private and  
 council. By the early 1980s there were
 about 2000 private houses and 500     
 council houses in Pembury. In recent  
 years in the community there has been 
 much concern about maintaining a      
 balance between young and old, private
 and council, residents. Currently     
 there is concern about the number of  
 three bedroom houses in Pembury.      
  The number of new developments       
 increased considerably after 1960, but
 in recent years it has been felt such 
 development should be stopped.        
 Planning controls are enforced.       
 Pembury has benefitted from its       
 position on the edge of the Wealden   
 Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. No
 nibbling at the edges has been        
 allowed.
