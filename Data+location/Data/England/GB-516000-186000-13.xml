		<content> We usually wake up at about 7/00a.m.  
 and have breakfast which includes     
 cereals, egg, bacon or toast with     
 coffee, tea or fruit juice to drink.If
 we have pets, we feed them next. Then 
 we tidy our bedrooms and prepare a    
 lunch for school. We either go by car 
 or walk to {school} and play until    
 8.50 a.m. when we enter our classrooms
 and our teacher takes the register.   
 Then we have assembly when our        
 headteacher tells us about famous     
 people or traditions. We have {two}   
 lessons before lunch which include    
 Maths, English, Science or History.   
 After lunch we read and have another  
 lesson before our last playtime.After 
 this we have our last lesson and at   
 3.45p.m. we go home. We have music    
 lessons, go to  clubs or watch        
 television until 9.p.m. Most of us    
 live with our mothers and fathers.    </content>
