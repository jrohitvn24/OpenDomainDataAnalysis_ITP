		<title>11DE HAVILLAND COLLEGE</title>
		<content> De Havilland College, previously      
 Mid-Herts College was opened by       
 Princess Anne on 29 November 1960.    
 Originally it was built adjoining the 
 Welwyn Garden City main library but   
 the library grew too big and was moved
 into Campus West.  The name Mid-Herts 
 College was changed to de Havilland   
 College because de Havillands at      
 Hatfield was taken over by the Hawker 
 Siddeley Company and later was        
 nationalised and its name changed to  
 British Aerospace.  The college was   
 called de Havilland College to        
 commemorate Sir Geoffrey de Havilland,
 the founder of the aircraft company.  
 The current principal is G J Evans.   
 The college has 1,000 students and    
 runs business studies, computer,      
 engineering, technology and science   
 courses. The college also has two     
 refectories and a gymnasium.          </content>
