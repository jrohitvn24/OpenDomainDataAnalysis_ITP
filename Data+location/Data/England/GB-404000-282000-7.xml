 2nd category are intermingled &amp; less  
 densely packed.Virtually all Council- 
 owned houses in the area are in       
 Balsall Heath.{Moseley}is also a      
 mixture of housing types,having a     
 mixture of the 2nd &amp; 3rd categories.  
 Some parts have large houses &amp;        
 gardens,e.g. the{Parklands}area of    
{Cannon Hill;}there are also areas of  
 semi-detatched housing with quite     
 small gardens{.Selly Park}&amp;{Edgbaston 
 contain almost all 3rd category       
 houses.This is largely due to the     
 covenants imposed by the{Selly Park &amp; 
{Calthorpe estates}.These state that   
 each house must have grounds of no    
 less than one and a quarter acres.
