		<title>09London Airport - Heathrow</title>
		<content> The major airport for England is sited
 on the historic site, Hounslow Heath, 
 of highwayman fame.  There are still  
 in existence the row of very old      
 cottages known as Heathrow that gave  
 the name to the airport. They are     
 totally engulfed by the airport but   
 still lived in.                       
                                       
 The airport is the major source of    
 employment in the area.               
                                       
 A new terminal is due to open this    
 year, 1985, bringing the number to    
 four. There is also a debate as to    
 whether a fifth will be built.        
                                       
 The main objection to this is that it 
 may increase traffic movements, air   
 and surface, thus aggravating noise   
 and air pollution.
