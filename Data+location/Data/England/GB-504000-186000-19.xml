		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE OF PAULA</title>
		<content>  I get up at 7.40 and get dressed.    
 Then I have my breakfast.At 8.30 I    
 cycle to school, and after            
 registration we go to assembly.       
  My first lesson was combined         
 science,which was followed by my      
 break,when I chat to my friends.Next  
 was maths, which was followed by      
 French.In the afternoon I made cakes, 
 in our cookery lesson.After school, I 
 plonked myself in front of the tele   
 for about three quarters of an hour.  
 When I got up, I started my homework. 
 At 5.30 my mum arrived home from work,
 and started tea.I set the table, and  
 we usually have something like chips  
 and meat, with a vegetable.I then     
 carried on with my homework, and later
 watched tele, sometimes I listen to my
 Wham! records.At about 10.00, I get   
 ready for bed, and read until I fall  
 asleep at about 10.20.{PAULA RHODES,13</content>
