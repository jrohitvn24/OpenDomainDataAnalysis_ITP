 mainly for maintenance of common      
 land.They also care for footpaths,    
 bridleways and the graveyard. At the

 street lighting, planning applications
 and allotments. If they cannot deal   
 with problems they pass them on to    
{Hart District Council.}They have two  
 meetings a month, one main meeting    
 that the public can go to and an open 
 spaces meeting. A meeting can take up 
 to three or four hours. There are     
 eight members on the Parish Council.  
 Six are men and two are women. A clerk
 is not included in the membership.    
 They get about one complaint a        
 month.The issues that they deal with  
 are gravel extraction, the Eversley   
 by-pass and the handing over of       
 Blackbushe Airport to a large auction 
 company.                              </content>
