		<title>073 Farms,Bromley,S.E.</title>
		<content>The Green Street Green area has three  
farms.One of them grows only crops:-   
cereals and vegetables and some fruit. 
The other two are mainly grassland.One 
has recently changed from dairy        
farming to beef cattle,sheep and some  
cereals,because of the E.E.C.          
restrictions.The farmland shows various
features which often occur on the Urban
Fringe.Some of the original farm land  
has been taken for more recreational   
uses.Land is used for pick-your-own    
fruit and a few fields are used for    
horses.Some farmers would like to sell 
fields close to existing houses for    
building,while others would like to buy
back farmland already sold under       
compulsory purchase orders.
