		<title>14The Cattle Market in Banbury</title>
		<content>  In the cattle market the main animals
sold are cows, pigs and sheep. The cows
are kept both inside and out depending 
how much room they have. Each cow has a
clip in its ear with a number on. They 
were bleeding when we went to visit,but
it didn't hurt the cows. The numbers of
the cows are stored in a computer.     
There is quite a bit of computerised   
equipment around the cattle market.    
The cows have quite a bit of space for 
themselves.                            
  The pigs are kept inside all the time
because they do not like hot weather.  
Above the pigs' pens there are water   
sprays to spray on in the summer. The  
biggest pigs are kept to one side of   
the building ready to be sold. The     
smallest pigs are kept in pens four    
metres square with twenty at the most  
in a pen. These are male and female    
together.                              </content>
