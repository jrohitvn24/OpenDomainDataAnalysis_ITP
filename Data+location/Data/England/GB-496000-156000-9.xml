		<title>09GOLDSWORTH SCHOOL, WOKING</title>
		<content> The name Goldsworth refers to the     
 ancient Tithing of Golding which was a
 'Worth' or farmplace mentioned in a   
 boundary charter of 956 AD.           
 The present Goldsworth Schools were   
 opened on 29th August 1898.           
 A site for two new Goldsworth Schools 
 has been chosen and building is due to
 commence in 1987-88.The site is on the
 Goldsworth Park Estate at Arthur's    
 Bridge, Horsell.                      
 The new schools will have a sports    
 field but there is no provision for a 
 swimming pool.Parents are concerned,  
 since in the 1960's,the then parents, 
 provided the present schools with our 
 swimming pool.At a public meeting     
 members of the Education Committee    
 told the parents that the matter would
 be considered and any decision        
 reported back.                        
                                       </content>
