		<content>  There used to be{2 shops}in the      
 village, one on the corner of         
 Marlingford Rd, where household       
 accessories could be bought and the   
 other was on the corner of Dog lane,  
 selling sweets, flour and sugar etc.  
 This shop was situated in the family's
 living room. Now in Easton there is   
 only one shop,{'The Post Office'}which
 has changed hands many times, but is  
 now like a{small supermarket.         
                                       
  In early days the village had only   
{one petrol pump;}now there is a large 
 garage owned by Mr. Gooch.            
                                       
  In the early 19th century, the       
 village folk had to walk to the water 
 pump to get water, but now{every house
{has water direct from the mains       
{supply.}The water pump is now the site
 for the{village sign.                 </content>
