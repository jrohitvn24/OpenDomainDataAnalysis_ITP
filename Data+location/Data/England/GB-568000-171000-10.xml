		<title>10  PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> At the moment in our area the         
 favourite playground games are        
 football and cricket for the boys and 
 'french elastic' for the girls.       
 'French elastic' is when you put a    
 piece of elastic around two peoples   
 ankles. Then you jump on to the       
 elastic and make up a sequence. The   
 next person has to do the same        
 sequence. If they make a mistake, it  
 is the next persons go.               
  During the winter the most popular   
 game with both boys and girls is      
 'pom_pom'. In 'pom_pom' one person is 
 'on' and the rest go away and hide.   
 After the person who is on counts to a
 certain number they have to start to  
 look for you. While they are looking  
 you have to try and reach the         
 'pom_pom' post before they see you and
 get there first.
