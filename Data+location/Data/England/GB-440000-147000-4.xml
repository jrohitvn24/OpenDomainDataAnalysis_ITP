		<content>      Just outside the village of{St   
{Mary Bourne}can be seen what is said  
 to be the largest single site devoted 
 to the growing of{watercress}in the   
 UK, and possibly in the world. The    
 seventeen acre plot of watercress beds
 forms part of the large operations of 
{"Hampshire Watercress",}the country's 
 leading producer.                     
      At present the work includes     
 propagating and planting seedlings,   
 harvesting, packing and refrigerating 
 the freshly cut cress, and finally    
 distributing almost daily to          
 wholesalers and retail outlets all    
 over the country .                    
      The area also houses the group's 
 main servicing and machine-making     
 depot, and an extended packing complex
 is planned for the near future.       
                                       
                                       </content>
