 energy of committee members and other 
 voluntary helpers for much of the     
 year.                                 
 The carnival season really gets under 
 way early in September with a         
 'Nomination Dance' at a local hall    
 when contenders for selection as      
 carnival queen come forward.About 20  
 girls all of whom must be 16 or over  
 and live in the parish,are selected.  
 Those selected go onto a second dance 
 about a fortnight later.The number is 
 then reduced to about 10 from who the 
 queen and her attendents,as well as   
 reserves,are subsequently chosen at a 
 final Grand Ball a few weeks before   
 the big day.                          
 Meanwhile, as carnival day approaches 
 the village becomes the centre of     
 bustling activity.There are prizes to 
 be won and much good natured rivalry. </content>
