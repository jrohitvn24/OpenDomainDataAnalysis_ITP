		<title>03A SURVEY OF VILLAGE SHOPS</title>
		<content>  On 5th June 1985, we went to{Sandy   
{Lane}to ask the villagers what they   
 thought about the shops there.        
    The people said that the shops were
 reasonable and that they were very    
 handy and the shopkeepers were        
 friendly.                             
     Some said that the shops were used
 for daily shopping for things like    
 bread and meat.The rest of the things 
 they buy at supermarkets,although a   
 few use the{village shops}more.       
     "The quality and prices at the    
 shops are reasonable," some people    
 said, but a few more of them said the 
 goods were more expensive.            
      The shops in the village have    
 everything you need,although someone  
 said that{Sandy Lane}could do with a  
 chemist, but she doesn't think they   
 will get one in the near future.
