		<content>  The bigger pigs are in pens for one  
or two pigs and the size of the pen is 
about 50cm by 1m, but they don't mix   
male and female.                       
  The pigs all have a mark on their    
backs.Out of all three animals the     
pigs are the ones which get ill more   
often.                                 
  The sheep are like the cows, kept    
both outside and inside. They are in   
pens which measure about 1m by 2m. In  
each pen there are a lot of sheep.     
  There are a lot of vets and they all 
work at different times looking for    
diseases in the three different        
animals.                               
  There are also a lot of auctioneers  
selling the animals. We had to be      
careful not to let our fingers twitch  
in case we bought something.
