		<content> This area of Dorset is part of the    
 most beautiful landscape of England.  
 Small villages and hamlets nestle in  
 the curve of the hills while the river
 Stour winds its way along the valley. 
 Small streams trickle down the        
 hillside to join it and provide       
 habitats for a wide variety of plants 
 and creatures.                        
 The villages and hamlets seem to have 
 taken life slowly, showing little     
 outward change. Yet people are living 
 here, developing and changing ,and    
 their homes, their lifestyle and their
 environment reflect this .            
 Tourists come to gaze at the beauty of
 these places, and to enjoy the peace  
 and tranquillity of the countryside.  
 We who live here can also enjoy all   
 this, but for us it is forever        
 changing, and we are part of this     
 change.                               </content>
