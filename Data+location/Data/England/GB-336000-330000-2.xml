		<content> Early  development  was  restricted by
 the marshes to the high  ground of the
 hamlets  of Hordley and Tetchill  with
 Frankton's  development largely to the
 north of our area. The drainage of the
 moors saw the growth of outlying farms
 but it is the coming of the canal that
 really  shaped the landscape. The idea
 first proposed  was to link Shrewsbury
 with the Mersey at Ellesmere Port.Work
 on  the  Shrewsbury  line  stopped  at
 Weston in 1797, but Frankton grew as a
 canal  centre with lines  going to Mid
 Wales,Llangollen and to Whitchurch and
 beyond.The canal handled peat, bricks,
 coal, limestone  and  stone that would
 have  been  important  inputs  to  the
 landscape. The canals  were officially
 closed in 1944. Since the war,Tetchill
 has attracted new housing although the
 rest of the area  shows signs of rural
 decline.                              </content>
