		<title>15ST.AUGUSTINE'S HOME</title>
		<content>{St.Augustine's Home}is well known in  
 Jersey. It opened in 1886, founded by 
{Jeanne Jegou}who had already opened a 
 small house in Brittany in 1839 as the
 first hostel of{The Little Sisters of 
{the Poor.}                            
 In Jersey the home is very modern and 
 lovely to see standing on high ground 
 overlooking the town of St.Helier and 
 Elizabeth Castle. There are about 90  
 patients all over 60. The home is run 
 by 14 Sisters and domestic help       
 together with local doctors. Each     
 person is taken into the home on merit
 or need. The funds come from the      
 inmates, from legacies and benefactors
 and some from the general public. The 
 Sisters are{Catholic,}but people of   
 any religion are taken into the home. 
 Only the chapel and the nunnery are   
 original buildings, and all the rest  
 has been recently rebuilt.            </content>
