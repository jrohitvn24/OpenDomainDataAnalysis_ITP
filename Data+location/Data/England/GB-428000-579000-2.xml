 Outside the urban development is      
 farmland which is mostly devoted to   
 arable farming. Cereal crops, mainly  
 barley, are grown.                    
  There is one small burn called{      
{Maggie's Burn}which runs through a    
 relatively new housing development. At
 the present time the water is low and 
 it contains Canadian Pondweed and some
 Duckweed. Whirligig beetles, fresh    
 water snails and water-fleas are also 
 present. Frogs also breed there in    
 Spring. Pollution however is beginning
 to spoil the burn as there is quite   
 a lot of paper rubbish,cans and       
 plastic bags present, which obviously 
 comes from the housing estate.
