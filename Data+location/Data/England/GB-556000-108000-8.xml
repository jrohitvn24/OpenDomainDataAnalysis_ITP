		<title>08THE HAILSHAM FUN RUN</title>
		<content>   The Hailsham{Fun Run}started in     
 1983. The organisers,who are the      
{Hailsham Rotary Club,}thought it would
 be a good idea to have an annual event
 for the people of Hailsham and        
 District to watch and take part in. So
 far a total of 2420 have run the 9    
 mile course and have raised Â£2200 for 
 various charites.                     
   The chairmain  of the Fun Run is    
 also a magistrate and a local butcher.
                                       
   As well as the runners about 90     
 people are needed to help organise the
 race. It is intended to hold the race 
 again in 1986.                        
                                       
   I took part in the Fun Run and I    
 raised Â£10.I was number 361.Three     
 other children from our school took   
 part.We all finised and got a medal.
