		<content> Most of the cookers used are gas;a few
 are electric and two or three have gas
 hobs and electric ovens.              
 Just over half the houses have two    
 toilets;the others have one. Over half
 the houses have two children living in
 them,and just under half have three.  
 Most of the flats in which our        
 children live are between two and     
 four storeys high. Half are made of   
 brick and the others of concrete with 
 flat roofs made of tiles or           
 asphalt,and are around seventeen years
 old,built on the council estate       
 mentioned earlier.                    
 Several of our children are Travellers
 and live on a permanent council       
 caravan site with toilet blocks,and   
 their own warden.
