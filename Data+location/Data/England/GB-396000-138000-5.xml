		<title>05Family Life in Codford</title>
		<content>  My name is Stacey Rogers and I live  
 at Tethers End, New Road, Codford,    
 Warminster, Wilts. My dad works for   
 the County Council inspecting the     
 roads. He is a Clerk of Works. He     
 works at Trowbridge and leaves home at
 7.40am and arrives at work by 8.30am. 
 My mum is a housewife and she also    
 does typing for someone. My brother   
 Stuart is 13 years old and goes to    
 Kingdown School. He catches a school  
 bus every morning at 8.0am. I go to   
 Codford Primary School and leave home 
 every day at 8.40am and get home at   
 3.20pm. Dad gets home at 6pm and      
 Stuart gets home at 4.35pm. We all    
 have our tea together at about 6pm. We
 have two dogs which are Cavalier King 
 Charles Spaniels,Bonnie and Cassie. I 
 help mum with baking on Saturdays. On 
 Sundays we watch Dad play cricket.    
 Evenings I watch T.V.or read.         </content>
