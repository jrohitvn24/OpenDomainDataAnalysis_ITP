		<content>   Twelve horses are trained as        
{steeplechasers}by a licensed trainer  
 at The Farm, in stables adjoining the 
 house, where Mr. Price the tenant     
 farmer lives.                         
   This amalgamated 330 acre farm is   
 rented from Mercantile and General    
 Assurance Company.  58 acres are under
{wheat,} 32{barley}and the rest ley    
{grass}for 200{lambs}fattened from     
 December to March and{cattle}bought   
 from Dorset.                          
   Some 260 Hereford/Friesian cattle   
 sell to an abattoir in the Forest of  
 Dean at 15-18 months old. 40 Friesian 
 steers are fattened intensively under 
 cover as a barley-beef unit for 12    
 months: bought at Â£90 each, they sell 
 at Â£440, encouraged by subsidies.     
   The land has been improved using    
 heringbone clay pipe{drainage}systems 
 which has increased yields by 10-15%. </content>
