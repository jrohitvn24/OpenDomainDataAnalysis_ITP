		<title>16PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> There is a Parish Council in the      
 village for which elections are held  
 every two years. There are six elected
 members with one member acting as the 
 clerk and another as chairman.        
  They meet in the village hall once a 
 month and sometimes more frequently if
 there is something important          
 happening.                            
  The most important thing they have   
 done recently was to persuade the     
 County Council to cut down the high   
 bank by Lakes corner so that people   
 can see what is coming round the      
 corner and then it is safer. They have
 also rebuilt the bridge by the Brewery
 to prevent flooding.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
