 In the mid-1970's the District Council
 began a scheme to construct 15 Nursery
 Factory units of 75sq/m and 4         
 additional larger units of 135 sq/m.  
     The general scheme was to reduce  
 the effects of possible future loss of
 mining jobs , a future which          
 unfortunately has now become a        
 reality.                              
     The factories occupy a site which 
 was previously the site of the        
 original eight rows of terrace houses 
 which formed the nucleus of the       
 original mining village.              
     The site is now being extended and
 will hopefully alleviate to some      
 extent the job losses and economic    
 problems resulting from the closure of
 South Hetton colliery.
