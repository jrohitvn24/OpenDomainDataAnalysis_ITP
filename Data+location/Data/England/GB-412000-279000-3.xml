		<content> Thousands of people shop in the town  
 centres traffic free areas and the    
 main High Street.There is the         
 complaint that there is not a wide    
 enough range of shops and most of the 
 shopppers want central{Mell Square}to 
 be closed to traffic all week and not 
 just Saturdays. The council are       
 applying for planning permission to   
 extend the precinct into{George}and{  
{New Roads}but people living in houses 
 there are objecting a great           
 deal.Solihull is a successful area for
 trade as unemployment is low and there
 is plenty of money to be spent.       
   The council have been building new  
 and modern public buildings in recent 
 years.These include a police          
 station,library and magistrates       
 court.There are more new buildings    
 planned.
