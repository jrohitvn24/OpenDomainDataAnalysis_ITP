		<content> In studying the area,we have covered a
 variety of aspects,chosen both because
 of their importance in the locality   
 and in accordance with the personal   
 interests of the participating        
 schools. In researching this          
 project,we have discovered many things
 about our surroundings that would     
 otherwise have remained unknown to    
 us.We hope our findings will be of    
 value to anyone who consults the disc 
 in the future.                        
 The statistics,text and photographs   
 were compiled by the staff and pupils 
 of the following Runcorn Primary
