		<title>08Farming:Gillamoor Area</title>
		<content> The area consists of about 400 acres  
 of good farmland.The size of the farms
 range from about 35 to 100 acres.Four 
 farms are tenanted, being part of the 
 Ravenswick Estate and two are owned by
 the farmers.A 25 acre area at Lowna is
 owned by a farmer at Sinnington and an
 employee lives in the farmhouse.      
 The 100 acre farm employs 3 men and   
 the others are all family run. These  
 farms are all mixed, having land under
 arable rotation and growing wheat,    
 oats, barley,rape,turnips and potatoes
 A recent change here is less barley   
 sown in the spring and more winter    
 sown wheat and barley. One farm keeps 
 dairy cows but another stopped        
 dairying last year. Most farmers have 
 sheep, some have beef cattle and      
 one has pigs.
