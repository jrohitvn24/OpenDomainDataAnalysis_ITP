		<content>The RNLI has been saving lives since   
1824.Mr.Taylor's job is to look after  
spending and to make sure the whole    
station is in mint condition and ready 
to work at any time.He also makes sure 
that the station runs efficiently.Mr.  
Taylor's previous job was coxen at     
Cullercoats.                           
The N8 pulling boat was dropped in     
1937.There have also been sailing      
boats,power sailboats,modern power     
boats and many more.A while ago a      
lifeboatman just had to be sea bearing 
and know the area.Nowadays the men have
to know about radars,first aid aswell  
as knowing about the area.             
Most lifeboatmen retire at 45 but if   
they wish to stay on they must pass a  
medical every year until they are 50   
when they must retire.Lifeboatmen do a 
lot more jobs than they used to.       
Most types of rescues are pleasure     </content>
