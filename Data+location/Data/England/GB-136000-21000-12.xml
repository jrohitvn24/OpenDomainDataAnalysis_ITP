		<content> Mackerel, pickled in vinegar all the  
 previous winter, are used to bait     
 crab pots. They are roped together in 
 'strings' of six or seven and dropped 
 with enough rope between them so that 
 only one pot is lifted at a time. Each
 string is buoyed and flagged to show  
 its location and owner. A winch is    
 used to 'pull' the pots from the      
 sea-bed. Conger eels are sometimes    
 found in the pots. A special metal    
 hook is used to get the conger eels   
 out of the pots. Usually the congers  
 are not sold but are chopped up for   
 bait. The crab pots are left at sea   
 all the time in the summer. They are  
 brought in during winter because of   
 bad weather. Several trips to sea are 
 needed get in all the pots of one     
 fisherman. The information on pages 11
 &amp; 12 was supplied by Mr. Leslie       
 Trewern, who fishes from Porthgwarra. </content>
