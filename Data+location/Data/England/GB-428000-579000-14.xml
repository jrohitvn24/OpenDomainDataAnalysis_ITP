		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SIMON</title>
		<content>                                       
 During the week I get up at 7am and   
 make my own breakfast.I then get ready
 for school and read or play until I go
 for the school bus at 8.30am.School   
 begins at 9.00am. We have break at    
 10.35am and lunch from 12noon until   
 1.00pm. We then have lessons until    
 3.25pm. On Tuesdays instead of lessons
 we go swimming between 10.50 and      
 11.30am. When school finishes I go    
 home by school bus. At home I change  
 out of my uniform, have my tea and    
 watch television until 5.00pm. After  
 that I practise my brass instrument   
 for half an hour. I play in my bedroom
 or outside until 7 or 8pm.I usually   
 read until 8.30pm but sometimes stay  
 up later to watch certain television  
 programmes.
