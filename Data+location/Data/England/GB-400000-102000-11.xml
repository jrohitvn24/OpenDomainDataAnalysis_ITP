		<title>11DUMPTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{THE SCHOOL                            
{Dumpton School}is soon going to move  
 from its present position to Deon     
 House. This is so Sir Richard Glyn can
 relaim the school buildings which he  
 owns. The school was once called      
 Gaunts House. It is a prepartory      
 school.                               
{BOARDERS                              
 A majority of boarders do not get home
 sick. There are two kinds of boarders,
 the weekly and the full. Weekly       
 boarders are allowed home on          
 saturdays, full boarders stay until   
 the holidays, often as their parents  
 live abroad. The children sleep in    
 rooms with 7-8 single beds.           
{THE HEADMASTER                        
 The headmaster has been at the school 
 for five or six years. The school     
 itself looks rather like a castle.    
 There are around 140 children .       </content>
