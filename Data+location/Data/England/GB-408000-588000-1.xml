		<content>   This area is in the valley of the   
 River Font and is primarily devoted to
 farming and woodland. The farming     
 ranges from arable to rough grazing,  
 with a mixture of cattle and sheep.   
   Netherwitton Village, and the       
 surrounding land, is almost wholly    
 owned by one landowner, Raleigh       
 Trevelyan, whose family have run the  
 estate for many generations. He lives 
 in Netherwitton Hall which dates back 
 to the 15th Century. The other listed 
 buildings are Font House and an old   
 derelict mill.                        
    The population has diminished      
 during the last 100 years from a      
 flourishing community with their own  
 craftsmen and shops, and a local      
 industry at the woolen mill. The      
 present population is about 100, most 
 of whom work on the land. Others      
 commute to Morpeth or Newcastle.      </content>
