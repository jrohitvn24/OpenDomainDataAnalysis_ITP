		<title>03The Tower of St.Cleer Church</title>
		<content>   The tower is 97 feet high. There are
 69 narrow, dusty, stone steps. On the 
 first floor is the clock chamber which
 has the clock mechanism. There are two
 clocks outside on the south and west  
 sides. The bell ropes pass through the
 second floor. On the third floor there
 are 6 bells made of cast iron. Some of
 them were made in a field nearby. When
 we got to the top of the steps there  
 was a small door. The roof is covered 
 with lead. It slopes in the middle so 
 that the rain can drain away. There   
 are scratched initials from hundreds  
 of years ago. There are crosses on top
 of four pinnacles, and 20 battlements.
     In the ringing chamber there is a 
 trap door to open to make the sound of
 the bells louder. There is a hook for 
 the captain of the Tower to hook the  
 ropes on so that they do not hang down
 when they are not being used.         </content>
