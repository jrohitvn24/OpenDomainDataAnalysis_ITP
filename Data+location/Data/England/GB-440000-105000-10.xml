		<content> Hythe Court meets twice every         
 Wednesday and once every Tuesday. On  
 Tuesday it deals with domestic and    
 traffic offences. Hythe Court has     
 three Magistrates one of which is an  
 English teacher at Noadswood School.  
 The shortest sentence is one day and  
 the longest is 6 months imprisonment, 
 or you can go up to three lots of 6   
 months imprisonment. The highest fine 
 is Â£50,000 and that is when Esso spill
 oil into the sea, for example. The    
 fine for speeding in Hythe is Â£1.50   
 per mile over the speed limit, and if 
 they go 20 mph over the limit it is   
 doubled. You have three penalty points
 on your licence every time you are    
 fined for speeding. The most common   
 crime is petty motoring offences. All 
 crimes committed in Hythe are first   
 dealt with in Hythe, but more serious 
 crimes then go to the Crown Court.    </content>
