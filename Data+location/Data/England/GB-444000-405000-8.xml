		<title>08HARMONIC MALE VOICE CHOIR</title>
		<content>{Thurnscoe Harmonic Male Voice Choir   
 has provided many hours of enter-     
 tainment for villagers in Thurnscoe   
 for{60 years.}They practice on Sundays
 and Wednesdays and go to many         
 festivals. The don't just go to       
 festivals in England but also they    
 sometimes go abroad and show their    
 talents to other people.              
 Altogether there are about{60 men}in  
 the choir and they are from different 
 walks of life.                        
 In 1926 when the National Coal Strike 
 was on, the Choir had festivals and   
 all the money that was made was given 
 both locally and nationally to people 
 who were in need. After this they     
 disbanded during the Second World War 
 and reformed in 1948.                 
 The pianist is called Mrs Hill and her
 father Mr Clennel is the President .
