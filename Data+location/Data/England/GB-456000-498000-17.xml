		<title>17BILSDALE LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> The Bilsdale Study Group was formed in
 October 1982 to foster an appreciation
 of the dale through the study of local
 history, archaeology, geology and     
 natural history.The organisation is   
 informal, with no committee, just the 
 founders Dennis &amp; Wendy Proudman of   
 Hagg House and Ida Atkinson of The    
 Lonning, acting as chairman, treasurer
 and secretary respectively.There is no
 formal membership.                    
 It was hoped to encourage local people
 to take such interests and to report  
 their findings at monthly meetings; In
 practice, both locals and people from 
 out of the dale have attended.Those   
 present contribute 25p to cover       
 expenses.Funds have been helped by    
 several generous donations from those 
 unable to attend.The average          
 attendance is about 15,but 40 is our  
 highest and 8 the lowest.             </content>
