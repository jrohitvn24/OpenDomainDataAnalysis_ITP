		<title>09MONK'S PARK QUARRY,CORSHAM</title>
		<content>  The underground workings at Corsham  
 started following the Box Tunnel      
 excavation in the early nineteenth    
 century.  Mining is important to      
 Corsham because of the oolitic        
 limestone found in this area. There is
 now just one surviving mine,Monks     
 Park,Corsham. It is believed there are
 still vast quantities of the stone    
 underground. A lot of the stone       
 produced in the Monks Park mine is    
 used on the outside walls of          
 buildings.                            
  At the old stone yard in Potley, they
 receive all types of Bath Stone from  
 Monks Park. They are given the stone  
 in big blocks and then it is cut into 
 slabs with a frigbob. Even the dust is
 sold for cement.  At Monks Park there 
 are 33 acres of tunnels, although half
 of the underground area is now        
 occupied by the Navy.                 </content>
