           On  A  School  Day.         
                                       
       My sister  wakes me up at  eight
 o'clock  in the morning. I get up  and
 get dressed  and  have  a wash.  After
 that  I  walk   down stairs.   I  make
 myself  a  cup  of  coffee   and  some
 toast. when I have finished, I wash up
 my dishes.                            
       Then  I go into  the  lounge  to
 watch   either   T.V. A.M.   or   Good
 Morning Britain.  Usually  I  look  at
 the Teletext for the  sporting news.At
 twenty to nine I put on my coat.  Then
 I kiss  my  mum  good bye  and  go  to
 Gunnislake School.                    
       When  I  get  to  school,  which
 takes  from  five  to  ten  minutes, I
 play football  with  my friends  until
 five  minutes  to  nine, when the bell
 rings  and I go into the classroom.   </content>
