		<title>11       FARMING</title>
		<content> The area covered in our survey is     
 mostly farmland. There are four main  
 farms surrounding Vernham Dean,of     
 which the largest is managed for the  
 owner, Mr. Govett, by Mr. Johnson. The
 farm at Linkenholt is also managed for
 a trust. The other two farms are      
 farmed by their owners, Mr Richard    
 Mills and Mr John Herriot. The land is
 predominantly arable, crops being     
 winter barley, wheat and peas. Where  
 the land becomes steep on the         
 edge of chalk downland, grass         
 is grazed by sheep. On the lower ,    
 more level pastures there is          
 intensive dairying and silage is      
 made for winter feeding. None of the  
 produce is used locally except for a  
 small acreage of wheat grown for      
 local thatching, the grain is used    
 for stock feed..
