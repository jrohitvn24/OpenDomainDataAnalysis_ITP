		<content>The market in the saleyard began in the
1870's. Mr Flick and Mr Herbert        
Stanford of Halesworth, put their heads
together and that's why they have      
market day on alternate Wednesdays in  
Saxmundham.                            
There were stalls taking in rent for   
the squire of the manor before the     
present market actually started.       
The poor walked their animals to       
market,the rich carted them. They used 
to sell fat cattle, sows, poultry and  
geese. Now they only sell fat cattle   
and poultry.                           
The numbers of cattle have gone down   
because the little farms  in this area 
have died out.When the cattle have been
sold they are taken to an abatoir.
