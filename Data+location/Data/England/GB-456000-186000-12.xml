		<title>12Communications:Letters</title>
		<content>{Letter writing} is a method of getting
in touch with individual people. A     
letter is a message written on paper   
which is then sealed in an envelope and
posted in a post box. The letters in   
the post box are then collected by a   
postman who takes them to a sorting    
office. From there they are delivered  
buy train or lorry to the destination. 
A postman then delivers them to the    
final address. Letters are relatively  
cheap to send, but fairly slow. They   
are used for less important            
information, or where it is essential  
to have a written record. {Telephones} 
are used for instant verbal            
communication. It is possible to hold a
conversation with anyone in the world  
by telephone. The transmitter sends    
signals along wires to a receiver which
translates it back into sound. This is 
instant communication, but more costly.</content>
