		<content>  {Buckbricks, sandpits in Slough Lane 
 have been there 55 years and Mr. Trew,
 the man in charge has worked there    
 for 38 years.  The 14 full time       
 workers start at 7.30 am and finish at
 5 pm. They have to wear protective    
 clothing.                             
  {Every month Bucbricks}sell          
 approximately 12,000 tons of both     
 sand and gravel, but in May 1985 they 
 sold 17,617 tons. The sand is first   
 washed in a barrel which has different
 sized holes to sort out the different 
 grades. Some sand is used for         
 filtration and blasting.              
  {Bucbricks export}sand to the        
 Falkland Islands and to the Middle    
 East.                                 
  {During the years excavating}they    
 have found a{Roman well,}part of a    
{whale,}parts of a{furry elephant (a   
{mammoth)}and a{fossilized sea urchin. </content>
