		<content> Typical of many of the farms in the   
 area  are Fordbrook, Torre Hill and   
 Venn Farm.                            
 Fordbrook Farm is a small dairy farm  
 of 40 acres made up of about 10 fields
 used for grazing and kale for winter  
 feed. The herd of 20 Friesian dairy   
 cows (without a bull) are used for    
 milk. There are also a few sheep and  
 some poultry. Originally the farm was 
 a cider farm surrounded by its own    
 orchards.                             
 Torre Hill &amp; Venn Farms (totalling 500
 acres) are mixed farms owned by Mr.   
 Cane. The cereal crops of oats and    
 barley are used to feed his live-     
 stock. The livestock consists of about
 27 cows and 1 bull (mainly Friesians),
 150 sheep (mainly Devon Longwool and  
 Suffock Crosses), and pigs (Welsh and 
 Large White). The cows produce meat   
 and milk. The sheep provide wool.     </content>
