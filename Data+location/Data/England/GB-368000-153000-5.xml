		<content> sandwiches for dinner,but I could     
 have school dinners if I wanted.After 
 dinner,1:00pm,I do project,which is   
 when I am given a subject and have to 
 find information on it.Last break,    
 2:00pm-2:10pm,we then continue with   
 any work we have to finish.For the    
 last 10 minutes my teacher reads us a 
 story,this is until hometime which is 
 at 3:05pm.I sometimes stay to tidy the
 library but usually walk straight     
 home.                                 
   When I get home I help my sister get
 dinner for when my Mum and Dad get    
 home,at 6:30pm.We usually have cooked 
 dinner with meat,potatoes,cabbage,peas
 or carrots and gravy.After dinner we  
 all sit down and watch television,my  
 sister and I go to bed at 9:30pm.I    
 usually read for 10 minutes and then  
 go to sleep.
