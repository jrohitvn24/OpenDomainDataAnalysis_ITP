		<content>{  A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MR. P. WOOD}   
                                       
    Mr Wood woke up at 8.30am. and got 
 ready for work. He got his car out of 
 the  detached  garage  and  set  off. 
 Arriving  at  about  9.00am, he found 
 that he had got a lot  of work on his 
 desk to  complete, but  at the end of 
 the day  he went home, turned  on the 
 television, and made a cup of coffee. 
 After  he  had  watched The 6 o'clock 
 News. He  went  along  to  the  shops 
 to get something to eat. Mr Wood came 
 back 20 minutes later, with some fish 
 and chips. He ate his dinner  and, as 
 it was now 7.30, he decided to have a 
 shower  and  an  early night. He went 
 upstairs and got ready  for  bed. His 
 digital alarm set for 8.30, he jumped 
 into bed, read the evening newspaper, 
 and  finally  snuggled  under his new 
 continental quilt.                    </content>
