		<content>    The Farmyard and Adventure         
 Playground is open from the end of    
 March to the end of September and is a
 very busy place during this time.     
    The Farmyard has a large selection 
 of animals including cattle, sheep,   
 pigs, poultry, horses etc.            
    Many schoolchildren come in the    
 Spring and Summer to see the newly    
 born piglets and lambs and the active 
 bee hive. There are many breeds of    
 poultry and some wander around the    
 yards with you. The milking           
 demonstration at 3.30pm each day gives
 you an insight into where your daily  
 milk comes from.                      
    The Adventure Playground tests the 
 physical skills of all ages with a    
 commando slide, tree-houses, scramble 
 nets, ropes, poles, swings and a      
 secret tunnel.
