		<title>14Children's Games in Maltby</title>
		<content> Most of the usual games,such as       
 football,cricket,tennis and           
 rounders,are played but a few unusual 
 games are played.  Many of them       
 invented by the children themselves.  
 One of the most popular games is      
 called 'Slaps'. Two people play this  
 game. One person puts their hands     
 together and points them toward their 
 opponent who does the same. Whoever   
 has the first turn aims to surprise   
 the other by suddenly slapping them on
 the back of their hands. If they are  
 successful, they take another turn. If
 not,then it is the other person's go. 
 Another  game played by Maltby        
 children is called 'Squashed Tomatoes'
 A game for any number of people.      
 The players line up with their backs  
 to a wall except for the one who is   
 'On' who aims to hit one of the others
 with a small ball then they are'On'.  </content>
