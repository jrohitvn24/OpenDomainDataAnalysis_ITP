  The basic rocks are of {KEUPER MARL} 
below the escarpment and Lower Lias    
above, sloping to the South East.      
Local quarrying by the cement industry 
has been carried out for the shallow   
White Lias.                            
  The landscape of the 12 sq.km.grid is
dominated by the limestone escarpment  
which runs diagonally from the S.W     
corner to the N.E corner.From this     
there is a fine view over the arable   
farmland in the valley to the          
West.The escarpment itself is dominated
by the village &amp; about a sq.km. of     
woodland.From here the ground slopes   
gently Eastward &amp; once again becomes   
arable farmland.To the South earlier   
quarrying has left its marks in the    
shape of pools &amp; rough ground.To the   
North the GRAND UNION CANAL briefly    
enters the area.                       </content>
