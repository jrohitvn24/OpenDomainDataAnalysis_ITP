		<title>14Ollerton Village - Social</title>
		<content>       The character of the village has
 changed since coal was discovered at  
 New Ollerton and,indeed,it continues  
 to do so.New housing has added greatly
 to the size of the village, much of   
 this being occupied by retired people 
 and those in "professional" employment
 at,for example,the Dukeries Complex.  
       A focal point of social life is 
 the{Ollerton Village Jubilee Hall.}It 
 was first proposed in 1977 after money
 was raised for the Queen's Jubilee. It
 was decided that the{community spirit 
 this produced should be fostered, and 
 the resultant Â£20,000 raised over the 
 next 5 years shows how successful this
 has been. This money, together with   
 Â£60,000 in grants, was used to build  
 the Hall, which was opened in 1983.   
      Fund-raising still continues as  
 it is felt there is an{urgent need}for
 a children's play area.               </content>
