bulls;24 chickens (the eggs are eaten  
by the Clear family);12 peacocks;5     
horses;36 pigs;5 cats;and 7dogs.Mr     
Clear's prize cow is called California,
she is 6 years old,and has won lots of 
competitions.Each year about 170 calves
are born (100 male:70 female),and the  
male ones are sold to be slaughtered   
after one week.The cows each produce   
4000 litres of milk  over 10 months    
of the year.10 cows are milked at a    
time in a herringbone parlour, which   
takes 2 hours each time.The cows are   
fed according to the amount of milk    
they produce.No crops are grown.       </content>
