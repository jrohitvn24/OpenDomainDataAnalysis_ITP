		<content> Heanor Community Centre opened in     
 March 1984 and incorporated the       
 swimming baths named after a local man
 Sgt.W.Gregg V.C.D.C.M.MM. Its first   
 manager is Mr Murray Calladine who    
 feels the aim of the centre is to help
 educate the public in the use of their
 leisure time, and that the new        
 Britannia Park facilities will not be 
 a detraction. Swimming is extremely   
 popular and the pool is used by both  
 Heanor and Ilkeston Swimming Clubs and
 the Sub Aqua. The clubs using the     
 meeting rooms include the Rotary, the 
 computer club, mother and toddlers,   
 dancing, keep fit, discos, and they   
 are also of use for private functions.
 Numerous sports are available         
 including roller skating, badminton,  
 karate, bowls and volley ball whilst  
 in the outdoor area there is tennis,  
 football, hockey and netball.         </content>
