		<title>01 General Introduction</title>
		<content> This pleasant rural area,to the west  
of Northampton, is mainly one of arable
farms. The clay soil supports crops of 
wheat,barley, oats and oil-seed rape   
which paints the countryside bright    
yellow in spring. The production of the
latter is on the increase. To the      
south, around Harpole, where the land  
is a little wetter, there is more      
emphasis on animal production.         
 The block contains, in the north, part
of the village of Upper Harlestone &amp; to
the south a very small portion of the  
village of Harpole. To the east is the 
busy residential area of New Duston on 
the western outskirts of Northampton.  
The area is dissected by a Roman Rd. as
Duston was a Romano-British settlement.
Most people are employed in some form  
of agriculture e.g. farming, garden    
centres, nurseries or forestry; or     
travel to work in Northampton.         </content>
