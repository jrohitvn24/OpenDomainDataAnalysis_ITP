		<title>18SAINT GUTHLAC'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>   The tiny church of Astwick is       
 dedicated to saint Guthlac. It dates  
 from the 11th century but the church  
 tower is the oldest part.The church   
 used to be much larger originally .A  
 parish register from 1564 to 1717     
 still exists.                         
   The rector at present is Reverend   
 John Andre. He is also rector at      
 Arlesey.                              
   There is no electricity in the      
 church so now no services are held in 
 the winter because the only light in  
 the church is produced by candles.    
 There is no organ either.Hymns are    
 accompanied on a harmonium.Central    
 heating has only just been installed. 
 Before,the congregation had to wear   
 their warmest clothes!                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
