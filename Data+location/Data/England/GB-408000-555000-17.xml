		<content> The left column denotes traffic which 
 came up a bank and didn't pass our    
 check-point.Between{11-12 }was        
 quietest because people had gone to   
 work or school and lorries had setout 
 on their journeys.                    
        Buses were more frequent       
 between {8-9}and {4-5}when children   
 were going to and from school.        
        The traffic was noisy and      
 moved quickly through the village.
