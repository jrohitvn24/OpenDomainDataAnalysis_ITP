		<content> Ribble Bus Services operate in this   
 area but the number of journeys is few
 and they are little used as most      
 people rely on private cars for       
 transport.                            
{Scaleby}has five buses on each weekday
 to and from {Carlisle}in school       
 holidays and four buses in term time. 
 These go on to {Smithfield} and{      
{Hethersgill}and two per week go to    
 Noblestown.                           
{Laversdale}has four buses a day from {
{Carlisle;}These go on to  Brampton or{
{Irthington.                           
 On Saturdays there are two buses to   
{Scaleby} and three to {Laversdale.    
 There is no Sunday service.
