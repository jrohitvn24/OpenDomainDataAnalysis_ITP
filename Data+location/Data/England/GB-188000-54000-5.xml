		<title>05THE SUMMERCOURT SHOP</title>
		<content>   The shop is situated at the         
 crossroads on the main road, and has  
 been open for three years but was     
 closed for three years before the     
 present owners bought it. The shop is 
 a general store with an Off-Licence   
 and they sell coal, paraffin, camera  
 film, tobacco and there is a cold     
 cabinet with meats and cheeses. The   
 summer brings much more custom than   
 the winter but it is difficult for    
 parking being on the crossroads but   
 there is a small park by the shop.    
 There are only two workers in the shop
 its owners, Mr.and Mrs.Hall. Most of  
 their winter custom is local but a lot
 of the village people do their main   
 shopping elsewhere and just use the   
 shop for oddments. They also take     
 small adverts in the shop window      
 making it a centre for the village    
 community.                            </content>
