		<title>10A village school secretary</title>
		<content> The school secretary has lived here   
 for 58 years.Her grandparents lived   
 here from 1875 and then her father and
 mother.One of the things she does not 
 like is that there is very few        
 children actually living in Hankham   
 and that many of thw cttages have     
 been bought by retired people and made
 into a larger house.Her own hose is 80
 years old and as there is no village  
 shop she has to go to Langley once a  
 week.Her hobbies                      
 include,cooking,sewing,knitting,garden
 ing and visiting people especially    
 time spent with her grandchildren .She
 works at hankham school, which her    
 father  attended as a pupil as well as
 her self,as an ancillary and as a     
 secretary she has been there for 25   
 years.
