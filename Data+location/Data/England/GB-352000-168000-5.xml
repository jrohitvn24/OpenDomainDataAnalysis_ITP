		<title>05KATIE'S MONDAY AFTERNOON</title>
		<content> Monday afternoons are when we do Art. 
 Today we were doing self-portraits,   
 first drawing, then painting. This    
 took three lessons. My drawing was not
 too bad, but the painting was         
 terrible! At 2.15 p.m. Class 1 went   
 out for Break. At 2.15 the whistle    
 signalled In-time. I tried to salvage 
 my painting, but failed. My hair      
 became a muddy green, and my lips     
 became a reddy-blue. At 3.30 p.m.     
 school finishes and Mum was there to  
 collect me in the car. I had developed
 a headache so didn't go to Gymnastics.
 Instead I took a Paracetamol tablet   
 and fell asleep. A dropped mug awoke  
 me at about 8.00 p.m. I enjoy 'Wogan' 
 because he is entertaining and        
 amusing, but on this rare occasion I  
 missed it, and most of 'Fame', the    
 programme which follows , so I said   
 goodnight to everyone and went to bed.</content>
