		<title>11HUTTON ESTATE - HARDWOODS</title>
		<content> Hardwoods on the Hutton Estate fall   
 into three categories:                
 a){Mature:}Principally oak, but also  
    lime, beech and sycamore. There is 
 a number of specimen trees in the Hall
 grounds as well as a number of        
 commercial plantations. They are of   
 major landscape significance.         
 Important plantations include Cover   
 Wood and 14 Acre.                     
 b){Young:}Often planted among soft-   
    woods and sometimes under planted. 
 Mostly sycamore, often from natural   
 regeneration, but also oak, beech and 
 birch. The Kennel Wood, mainly oak and
 beech, is the most notable example.   
 c){Poplar:} Lord Inglewood planted    
  many varieties and hybrids. They were
 established for commercial reasons and
 now dominate parts of the landscape.  
 Being weak in wind, they are not being
 replanted as extensively.             </content>
