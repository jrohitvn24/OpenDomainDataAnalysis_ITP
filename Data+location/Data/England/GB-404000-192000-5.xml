		<content>  The Church of The Holy Cross stands  
 at the north west edge of the village.
  It has a Norman Chancel arch which   
 was widened and raised when William   
 Butterfield restored the building in  
 1877.                                 
  The drum shaped Norman font is       
 decorated with chevrons between rows  
 of leaves and honeysuckle.  The       
 pointed arches of the nave are        
 thirteenth century, as is the chapel  
 which has a fifteenth century window. 
  The tower is perpendicular           
 with battlements and gargoyles.       
  A nineteenth century marble monument 
 shows Charlotte Nicholas on her       
 deathbed surrounded by her family.    
  Around the Church and Church Farm can
 be seen the remains of the double moat
 which is a reminder of the monastry   
 which once stood there.
