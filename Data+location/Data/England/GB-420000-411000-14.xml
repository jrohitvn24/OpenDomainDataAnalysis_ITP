		<title>14CHILDREN'S CLUBS</title>
		<content>   The favourite club is the Youth     
 club, where you can play pool,        
 badminton and other games. It costs   
 between 15 and 30 pence.              
   The next favourite club is Guides.  
 Again they meet once a week and the   
 charge is about 20 pence. Here girls  
 learn to tie knots and study to pass  
 badges. They also play games.         
   Scouts is also quite popular. Scouts
 learn to canoe, cave and climb.They go
 camping every week in the summer.     
   Each village has its own football   
 club, and that club is in the league  
 and they can enter the cup each       
 season.                               
   Then there is horse riding. It costs
 from 2 to 5 pounds a lesson. There    
 are many clubs in this district. We   
 have Cricket, Karate, Cubs, Gym, BMX, 
 Rugby and Netball clubs.
