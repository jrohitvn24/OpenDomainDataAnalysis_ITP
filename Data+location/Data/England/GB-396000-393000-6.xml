		<content>   There are 33 shop units in the      
precinct and 3 blocks of 5 shops dotted
around the estate. All the units are   
not being used. Some shopkeepers are   
loathe to set up business because of   
the vandalism. "Damage has been caused 
by youths," say the residents.         
   A resident said the badly designed  
shopping precinct should have a gate to
enclose it. A pub is at one end and a  
chip shop at the other. People come    
from the pub through the precinct,doing
damage on their way to their chip shop.
   There is a Community Centre for     
various clubs-a Disabled Club,a Rainbow
Club etc. Community Routes is an       
excellent transport service but it is  
in some danger because of finance.     
   There is a Kenward Travel and Trust 
to help poor children to have holidays.
A Police Station which closes at 6pm.
