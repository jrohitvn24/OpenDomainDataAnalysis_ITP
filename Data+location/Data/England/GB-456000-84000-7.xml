		<content> This year there will be a dance       
 instead.  Each of 15 towns on The     
 Island has a{CARNIVAL}and each queen  
 goes on her float to each carnival.   
 We have a reception for the queens    
 afterwards.  We never have enough     
 helpers to collect the money.  We have
 seven bands and majorettes .  On the  
 day he has to put the procession in   
 order and to get the judges to choose 
 the best group in each section.  The  
{POLICE}like it to move at the right   
 time.  We spend all year meeting and  
 planning but it is enjoyable on the   
 day.  One year we had a sandcastle    
 competition but the tide washed them  
 away before the judges arrived.       
 Children who win the fancy dress get  
 Â£5 but it might cost more than that to
 make the costume.
