		<title>02FISHING IN NORTH SHIELDS</title>
		<content>{Fishing}has been an important {       
{industry}in{North Shields}for hundreds
 of years. It was made an important    
 trade as long ago as 1225 when the    
 Prior of Tynemouth had "sheels" or    
 fishermen's huts to be erected where  
 the Pow Burn ran into the River Tyne. 
 This was how North Shields first got  
 ots name and where the present Fish   
 Quay came to be built.                
 Employing a large number of people in 
 fishing itself and the many associated
 industries, the Fish Quay has declined
 in importance recently because of the 
 many new regulations concerning the   
 catching of fish in the North Sea, and
 the reduction in the number of fishing
 boats using the Quay.
