		<content>  Charlton Village is now part of      
Wantage.Its church,Holy Trinity,was    
built in 1848 for the people living in 
the eastern part of the parish of      
Wantage.                               
 The assistant priest (Father Simon    
Evans) is responsible for taking the   
services and for visiting people at    
home.He also comes into the two Church 
Schools to take prayers and to teach.  
He has started a youth group which     
meets on Sunday evenings at his        
house.About 20 people over the age of  
13 attend. He writes music and has     
composed a Wantage Mass which was used 
for the first time on St.Peter's Day   
1985.                                  
Over the weekend of Trinity Sunday a   
flower festival was held. There was a  
concert by local people in the church  
on the Saturday and a barbecue in      
Father Simon's garden on the Sunday.   </content>
