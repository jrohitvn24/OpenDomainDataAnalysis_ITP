 Infants School currently has 19       
 pupils. It was built in 1842 as a     
 National School. There are now 2      
 fulltime teachers, one part time      
 teacher, two cooks and a cleaner. Most
 of the local children begin their     
 school career here, leaving at 8 years
 old to attend Droxford Junior School, 
 (some opt for Ridgemede Junior School,
 Bishop's Waltham) followed by Swanmore
 Comprehensive school. The children are
 are transported to Droxford and       
 Swanmore on a school bus.The          
 designated 6th Form College is in     
 Eastleigh.  Our village school is     
 regarded as a most important aspect of
 our community. A Pre School Play Group
 is held 3 times per week in The Meon  
 Hall.
