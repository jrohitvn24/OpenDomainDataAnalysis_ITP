		<title>09POPULATION OF FRILSHAM</title>
		<content> In 1921 the population of Frilsham was
 233. In 1985 it is 240. There has been
 very little movement in or out of the 
 area. Population is mostly            
 concentrated in the village.{Young    
{people}tend to move out to find work  
 and live elsewhere. There is some     
 movement of retired{middle class}     
 people who buy houses here and settle.
 There are usually 3 or 4 planning     
 applications each year not a great    
 deal of new building. There are all   
 classes in the population. The{upper  
{and middle classes}live in houses     
 such as Hawkridge House or in the     
 larger ones. Some are{professional}   
 people. They send their children to   
 boarding schools. The bulk of people  
 are{working class.}Their children tend
 to improve in status over the years.  
 The{Berkshire dialect}is sadly dying  
 out owing to radio, TV and education. </content>
