		<title>02  THE MALTINGS</title>
		<content> Since 1975 the Farnham Maltings has   
 become an arts and community centre   
 but its history dates back to the 18th
 century. The earliest surviving       
 documents, dated 1729, show that the  
 building was used as a tannery. In    
 1830,a maltster set up business in the
 east wing. The tanyard was sold in    
 1845 for Â£1400 and converted into a   
 brewery.The whole property was bought,
 by the Lion Brewery,in 1899 and became
 a maltings.Courages bought the        
 property in 1925 and continued malting
 there until 1956. The building stood  
 empty for 12 years then plans were put
 forward to demolish and redevelop the 
 site. The Chairman of the Farnham     
 Society  proposed converting it into  
 a community centre.Courages offered   
 the property to the town for Â£30000.  
 The project was approved and money    
 raised for the purchase in March 1969.</content>
