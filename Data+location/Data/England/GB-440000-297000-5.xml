		<title>05Connections With Bosworth</title>
		<content>  Although the official site of the    
 Battle of Bosworth,at Ambion Hill is  
 outside our allocated area,there are  
 many connections with Bosworth around 
 Dadlington and Stapleton.The people of
 this area feel very proud of these    
 links,and some are trying to prove    
 that the actual battle took place at  
 Dadlington.                           
      Richard's Well,to the NW of      
 Ambion Wood,is supposed to be where   
 Richard III drank during the          
 battle.It is believed that on the eve 
 of the battle he slept in the church  
 at Stapleton,but it is also claimed   
 that he camped near Harpers Hill.     
 Historians believe that Henry Tudor's 
 troops pushed Richard's army as far as
 the Hinckley Rd,Stoke Golding.Many    
 soldiers are believed to have been    
 buried in the area,especially at      
 Dadlington and Stoke Golding.         </content>
