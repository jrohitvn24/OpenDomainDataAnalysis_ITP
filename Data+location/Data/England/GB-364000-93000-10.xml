		<title>10Gardening in Stratton</title>
		<content> The chalk subsoil means that acid     
 loving plants do not flourish in      
 Stratton.  Nevertheless the general   
 run of garden flowers and vegetables  
 are successful. Grapes flourish out of
 doors as do peaches and apricots on   
 sheltered walls. A number of the      
 larger houses have hens. Home bread   
 baking and wine making are popular, as
 is evident in the annual show.  Two   
 households keep sheep in order to spin
 wool, and there are several bee hives.
 The farmworkers no longer have a strip
 of a field planted with potatoes for  
 their own consumption.  The allotments
 have disappeared. The new houses have 
 tiny gardens incapable of holding more
 than a few potted plants.  The        
 traditional produce show is in dasnger
 of extinction.There are few large     
 trees, but hedges along the road give 
 a pleasant green impression.          </content>
