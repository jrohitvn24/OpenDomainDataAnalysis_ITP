 Hatfield Peverel is a very old village
 the site of the Roman road from       
 London to Colchester runs though the  
 centre. The word Hatfield means a     
 clearing in wild uncultivated ground, 
 and Peverel comes from Ranulph de     
 Peverel who owned the village after   
 the Norman Conquest. Ranulph de       
 Peverel married Ingelrica, a former   
 mistress of William the Conqueror.    
 Ingelrica built a priory in the       
 village where she lived for the last  
 fifteen years of her life to make up  
 for the misdeeds of her youth. The    
 original priory no longer remains but 
 the village still has its Norman      
 church. Legend has it that Ingelrica  
 would be caught by the devil whether  
 she was buried inside the church or   
 out, so she was buried in the walls.
