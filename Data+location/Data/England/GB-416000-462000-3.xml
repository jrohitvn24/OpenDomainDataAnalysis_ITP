		<title>03ECOLOGY - WOODLANDS</title>
		<content> Woodland covers about one-fifth of    
 our Domesday area and the Guisecliffe 
 Woods are what remains of the         
 primeval woodland, which were mainly  
 oakwood and were probably shown in    
 the first Domesday Survey.            
 Of the trees in the lower woodland    
 about 54% are silver birch, 28% are   
 rowan, 12% are oak and the remaining  
 6% are holly trees.                   
 Of the trees in the upper woodland,   
 however,  38% were holly, 22% were    
 silver birch, 18% were rowan, 12% were
 oak and the remaining trees were beech
 and elderberry (5% each).             
 The trees that were found in the      
 valley bottom were beech, sycamore,   
 alder, hazel, horse chestnut ,        
 ash, hornbeam and willow.
