		<title>20TRANSPORT:WOODTON AREA</title>
		<content> For many of the people here transport 
 means having their own car;only about 
 12% of families have no car at all,&amp;  
 of those who do have cars,nearly 40%  
 have 2 or more cars.Those dependent on
 public transport are fairly well serv-
 ed by the Eastern Counties Omnibus Co,
 which runs a service from Norwich to  
 Halesworth via the B1332,diverting    
 through Woodton Street.This service is
 roughly hourly on weekdays &amp; Saturdays
 but runs less frequently on Sunday.It 
 enables people to visit Bungay for    
 shopping or the doctor,&amp; Norwich for  
 shopping or entertainment,though the  
 latter is constrained by an inadequate
 evening service.There is a connection 
 in Bungay with buses for Harleston or 
 Beccles &amp; Lowestoft.The Woodton W.I.  
 offers a 'taxi' service in emergenc-  
 ies.(Researched &amp; written by Hedenham
