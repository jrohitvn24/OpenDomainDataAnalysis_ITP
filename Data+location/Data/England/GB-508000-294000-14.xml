		<title>14CHICKEN FARM:NORTH/ELTON</title>
		<content> A farm of 13 acres rearing chickens   
 for slaughter.   140,000 chickens     
 penned at anyone time.  Purchased as  
 day old chicks and sold for slaughter 
 at six weeks and supplied to a chain  
 of supermarkets.  The pens were heated
 by Calor gas and the annual heating   
 expenditure was approx. Â£25,000.  The 
 farmhouse was modern, detached and    
 owner-occupied.  The family consisted 
 of farmer, wife and three adult off-  
 spring.  He had lived there for 30    
 years, was born in the area as were   
 his parents. He owned two cars, and   
 shopped in Peterborough.  Main leisure
 pursuits were golf and television.    
 They enjoyed living there because they
 had no neighbours and considered there
 were no disadvantages.
