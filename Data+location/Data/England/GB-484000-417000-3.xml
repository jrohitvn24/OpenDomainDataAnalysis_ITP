		<content> The church of St  Andrew is much more 
 than a centre of religion for a great 
 many clubs and societies are based    
 there.For boys there are Cubs and     
 Scouts and for girls there are        
 Brownies and Guides.Apart from their  
 normal weekly meetings there are      
 special services and parades.For      
 older parishioners there is the       
 Mothers' Union and the Men's          
 Society.The Mothers' Union was founded
 in 1876 by Mary Somner,wife of the    
 rector of Old Almsford,Hampshire, who 
 was greatly concerned with the        
 Christian upbringing of both her own  
 children and those of other young     
 mothers locally.Members of the Men's  
 Society are committed church men and  
 find it helpful to discuss their      
 beliefs knowing that sincere          
 discussion helps to form sound        
 condition.                            </content>
