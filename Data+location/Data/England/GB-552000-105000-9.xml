		<title>09Arlington Village.</title>
		<content> A settlement which was well           
 established in Saxon times, later     
 becoming the most important village in
 the area, is today struggling to      
 survive.  It comprises a Saxon Church,
 a public house and a close cluster of 
 13 well-kept houses, occupied by      
 country-loving people who choose to   
 retire there, or are prepared to      
 commute as far as 50 miles to work.   
 There is very little employment in the
 immediate, mainly agricultural, area. 
 There are some 30 other dwellings     
 within a 2 miles radius of the Church.
 The greatest fear is that the houses  
 might be acquired by "weekenders".    
 Current disturbance comes from traffic
 speeding home from nearby Speedway    
 Stadium weekly meetings, using track  
 techniques on winding narrow lanes.   
                                       
                                       </content>
