		<content> On Friday June 7th 1985 it was Parkend
 County Primary School's Centenary.    
 There were  many activities and events
 on that day and during 1985.There was 
 a book published with details ofthe   
 history of the school many            
 photographs _ old and new, and        
 reminiscences of staff, puils and     
 friends.We mounted an exibition of    
 interesting artefacts ranging from    
 original childrens slates to the      
 latest in computer usage .There was a 
 party, a commemorative tree planting, 
 presentation of Centenary Medals, a   
 huge raffle, a rounders match, an old 
 fashioned PE lesson and a special     
 service to which past vicars and the  
 Bishop of Tewkesbury attended. A video
 was made of the whole celebration.
