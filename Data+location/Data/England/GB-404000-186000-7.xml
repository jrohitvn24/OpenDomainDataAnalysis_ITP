		<title>07Self Help Around Braydon</title>
		<content> The communities are spread over a wide
 area and sparsely populated. To an    
 onlooker they may appear isolated.    
 There is, however, a community spirit 
 in these area and neighbours help each
 other perhaps to a greater extent than
 in an inner city area. There is no    
 public transport but this problem is  
 overcome through community self-help. 
 This is in the form of car sharing,   
 doing shopping for neighbours and     
 generally caring for each other.      
    People can travel into Purton to   
 participate in one or more of the many
 clubs and interest groups. There are  
 clubs for sports, youths, gardening   
 and history as well as WI, National   
 Housewives Register and the Silver    
 Threads Club. The community spirit is 
 in evidence as one car driver brings  
 other neighbours to the clubs.
