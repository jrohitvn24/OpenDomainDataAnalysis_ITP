		<title>16WRITTLE,TRAVELLING PEOPLE</title>
		<content> Writtle, over the years has had a     
 number of travelling people pass      
 through.Because they live in caravans 
 these people are, sometimes           
 incorrectly called gypsies.But most of
 the families that stay in Writtle and 
 the surrounding areas are fairground  
 families.They usually arrive in the   
 Autumn and leave in the Spring for    
 the Summer season.                    
       They usually park their caravans
 at either Oxney Green or Hassenbrooks 
 and the same families return each     
 year.                                 
       When they are staying in Writtle
 the children usually attend Writtle   
 Junior School.
