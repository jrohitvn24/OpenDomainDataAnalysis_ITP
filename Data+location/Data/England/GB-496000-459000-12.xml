		<title>12Houses and Buildings</title>
		<content> There are approximately 97 houses and 
 farms in the area being surveyed.     
 There is no stone nearby apart from   
 chalk with the result that the oldest 
 buildings, apart from the church, were
 erected about 200 years ago. The      
 oldest farmhouses are Georgian but    
 most were built between 100 and 200   
 years ago. Farm buildings adjacent to 
 the farms are now out of date and     
 being replaced by steel and asbestos. 
 In the village the predominant style  
 is semi-detached, the best quality    
 being those erected in the 1900's.    
 Garton is not a development village so
 there are very few new houses. All the
 houses are made of bricks, either made
 locally or machine made. Roofing      
 materials consist of boxhill tiles,   
 concrete tiles and slate.
