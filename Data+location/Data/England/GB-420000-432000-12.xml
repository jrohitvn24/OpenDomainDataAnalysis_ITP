		<title>12FARMING AND AGRICULTURE</title>
		<content>   Local agriculture consists mainly of
 small arable farms.The main crops are 
 lettuce,cauliflower,cabbage,potatoes  
 and rhubarb.In days gone by rhubarb   
 was the main crop and a train called  
 the{Rhubarb Special}took it to London.
 The land is farmed intensively by a   
 small number of men who rely on       
 mechanisation,chemical fertilizers and
 weedkillers.This means that the number
 of people invoved in farming is quite 
 small.                                
    On the other hand allotments,where 
 vegetables and flowers are grown,are  
 still very popular.People tend to grow
 small amounts of various fruits and   
 vegetables for their own needs.Pudsey 
 people are also very keen gardeners.  
 The most popular flower seems to be   
 the rose.An elderly Pudsey lady has   
 over 120 varieties of rose in her     
 garden which delights her neighbours. </content>
