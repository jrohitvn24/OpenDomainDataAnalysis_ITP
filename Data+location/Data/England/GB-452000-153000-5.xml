		<title>05Local History of Hannington</title>
		<content> Hannington has its place in history,  
 it was claimed as the birthplace of   
 the famous Archbishop Warham in the   
 time of Henry VII &amp; VIII. Part of All 
 Saints church dates back to before the
 Norman conquest &amp; is mentioned in the 
 Domesday book.  A 100 year old C of E 
 Aided school for approximately 40     
 children existed until 1984 when it   
 was closed and is now awaiting plan_  
 ning permission for conversion to     
 housing.                              
 We also have a small Methodist Chapel 
 built in 1871.                        
 There are five remaining thatched     
 cottages, one of which is named Tyn_y_
 Bryn, recently authenticated as 14th  
 century origin, and is now a listed   
 building.  It stands opposite the     
 green which was once the village pond!
