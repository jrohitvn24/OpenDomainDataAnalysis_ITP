		<title>02William Hanbury 1725 - 1778</title>
		<content>   In {1749} William Hanbury's father  
 bought him the living of the          
 Langtons.He wanted to build a         
 hospital, cathedral and school here.  
 He grew thousands of trees and sold   
 them to land owners, investing the    
 money, some of which was used to build
 the original school in{1873.}This is  
 now a camp school where Leicestershire
 children can stay to learn about the  
 countryside. Of the two school houses,
 one is now the cook's house, the other
 is empty. The hall and caretaker's    
 house were  built in {1924}and the    
 present primary school in {1936.}Today
 the interest on his money (the Trust  
 Fund) still helps people at college   
 and old people at Christmas. The      
 casework of the organ he bought still 
 exists. He was buried in an octagonal 
 mausoleum and later reburied in a     
 vault under the vestry.               </content>
