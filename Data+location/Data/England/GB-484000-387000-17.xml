		<title>17Springthorpe Church. Outside</title>
		<content>{The Church of St. George and Lawrence.
  When we first got to the church we   
 saw the church cross next to the path 
 in the graveyard. Then we started to  
 look at the windows and doors to see  
 how old they were. At the bottom of   
 the tower there is a good herringbone 
 zig zag pattern in the stonework. On  
 the side of the tower there is a      
 narrow plain Saxon arch. This made us 
 think that part of the church might   
 have been built before the Norman     
 invasion of England. The church is    
 built from limestone and from the     
 outside we could see where the        
 original nave was. We could also see  
 a bit of the chancel from where we    
 were standing. When we went in the    
 porchway we could see a Norman arch   
 above the door. It is decorated with  
 a dogtooth pattern. The pillars at the
 side of the door are decorated too.   </content>
