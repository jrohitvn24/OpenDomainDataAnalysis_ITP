		<title>06THE BUILDINGS IN WOORE</title>
		<content> Almost all the buildings in Woore are 
 of{brick,}and are not earlier than the
 nineteenth century.                   
 There are a few large houses;{Woore   
{Manor}in the Square and Bulkeley Hall 
 on the Newcastle Road. {Dorrington    
{Hall Farm}has some interesting old    
 parts,and{Syllenhurst Farm}is near    
 the site of an old moat.              
 Though they may not be impressive, the
 ordinary houses, built towards the end
 of the nineteenth century, usually    
 have some interesting detailed work in
 the bricklaying.                      
 The{"Swan" Hotel}is an old coaching   
 inn, though many alterations have been
 made.                                 
 There is a good number of substantial,
 detached houses in the village, and a 
 development of modern detached houses 
 continues on Westfields and Grove     
 Crescent.                             </content>
