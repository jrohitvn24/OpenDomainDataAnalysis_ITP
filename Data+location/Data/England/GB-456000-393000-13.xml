		<title>13TICKHILL ANGLO-FRENCH ASSOC.</title>
		<content> In May 1984 the Tickhill Anglo-French 
 Association was formed.Tickhill's{twin
{town}is Ecquevilly which lies 15 miles
 north-west of Paris.The association   
 was originally for adults but recently
 I have helped to form a junior        
 section.In October 1983 a party of 22 
 visited Ecquevilly and in March 1984  
 members of the French section visited 
 Tickhill.During their stay in Tickhill
 the children came to a party at my    
 house.The next night there was a      
{French Evening}at the Parish Rooms.At 
 Tickhill Gala there will be a         
 decorated float entered by the        
 association.To raise funds,there have 
 been many functions including a disco 
 and a wine tasting evening.My family  
 and others have been invited to visit 
 Ecquevilly in August 1985 .Hopefully  
 these visits will continue for many   
 years to come.                        </content>
