		<title>10The "Boar Inn" at Gt.Ryburgh</title>
		<content>{The Boar}is on a corner opposite the  
 Parish Church, and probably dates from
 the 13th C, though the present front  
 is 18th C. Formerly called the "Blue  
 Boar" from a boar in the coat of arms 
 of the deVere family, it changed hands
 in 1777 for Â£300.                     
 The present landlord has been there   
 for 3 years.{ The restaurant,}which   
 provides about half the business,     
 serves lunch and dinner. {Bed and     
{breakfast}accomodation is also        
 available at Â£12.50 per night.        
 Opening hours are 10.30am to 2.30pm   
 and 6.00pm to 11.00pm.                
 Children are allowed in if accompanied
 by parents.  The pleasant garden with 
 tables and chairs is popular in the   
 summer. Only about 15% of the         
 customers are from Great Ryburgh      
 itself.                               
                                       </content>
