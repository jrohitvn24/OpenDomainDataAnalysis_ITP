		<title>15Wind-Surfing Club, Lound</title>
		<content> At Lound there is a disused gravel pit
 where you can go wind-surfing.  There 
 has been a wind-surfing club there for
 five years.  Before that it was used  
 for water-skiing.  The club opens     
 every day at lO o'clock in the morning
 and closes at dusk.  Between thirty   
 and eighty people visit the lake each 
 day.  The weekends are busy.  The     
 water is between ten and twenty feet  
 deep.  There are a lot of fish in the 
 lake, including some pike.  You can   
 have tuition which costs Â£lO.5O an    
 hour.  You are supplied with all the  
 necessary equipment.  They have a     
 simulated board on land for beginners.
 They also have small boards and sails 
 for children.  After you have had your
 tuition they supply a board, sail and 
 wet suit for Â£2.5O.  They have a race 
 night on Thursdays for the good       
 wind-surfers.                         </content>
