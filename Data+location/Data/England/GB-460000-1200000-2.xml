		<title>02Uyeasound Kirk.</title>
		<content> The Kirk was built in 1850 but shows  
 1843 above the door.The reason for    
 this is that in 1843,John Ingram of   
 Unst dismissed the General Assembly   
 Meeting of the Church of Scotland     
 because he disagreed with how         
 Ministers were chosen.He and 200      
 others walked out and set up the      
 United Free Church.In 1929 the United 
 Free Church became a unit of the      
 Church of Scotland.                   
   Rumour has it that the Kirk was     
 built with a grant from the Duchess of
 Sutherland.                           
   The current Minister has been the   
 Minister for this and St.John's Kirk  
 in Baltasound since 1982.The weekly   
 service in Uyeasound is held at       
 12.30 p.m. on Sunday.The building     
 seats 400 but the average attendance  
 at Sunday worship is 20.
