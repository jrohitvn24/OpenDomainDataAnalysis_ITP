		<content>     The library in Ruislip used to be 
 the Little Barn of the Manor Farm and 
 is now the central building of the    
 Manor Farm Leisure Complex. It has a  
 fox shaped weather vane.              
    It has a children's part and an    
 adult's part. The adult's part has got
 reading books that are pretty         
 difficult to read. There are about 5  
 areas where you can sit and read a    
 newspaper or book kept in the library.
 There is a part of the library where  
 juniors or seniors do their homework. 
 Also there is a photo-copier that     
 costs 10p. To take some books out of  
 the library you have to ask for some  
 tickets then you are a member.        
    There are some videos in the       
 children's section. The children's    
 librarian runs events during the      
 holidays. If you want to leave your   
 baby there for a while there is a cot.</content>
