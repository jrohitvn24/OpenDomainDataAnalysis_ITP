		<title>06Customs - Harvest Fair</title>
		<content> There are two fairs which are         
 important to our area: Harvest Fair   
 and Wendron Ram Buck Fair.            
{Harvest Fair} is held on the first    
 Monday in September and is when       
 farmers bring in hay, straw, corn and 
 barley from the feilds.   They go in  
 to Helston to a special fair.  People 
 enjoy having a go on all the rides at 
 the fun fair which follows the        
 Agricultural Show.  There are         
 competions of handicrafts, cookery,   
 vegetables, arts &amp; crafts, flower     
 arranging, photography and other rural
 hobbies.  These are open to adults and
 children and the competition is often 
 very fierce!
