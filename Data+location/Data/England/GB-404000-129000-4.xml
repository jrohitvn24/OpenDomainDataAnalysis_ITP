  The church was built at the same time
 as Salisbury Cathedral. It is made of 
 flint and stone, with a part old      
 tile,part slate roof. It is cruciform 
 with an Early English chancel. The    
 nave, central tower, south transept   
 and font are Perpendicular. The north 
 transept is later. The pulpit is C17. 
 The altar is formed from an old       
 Spanish chest and is elaborately      
 carved.                               
  The village cross is in the centre of
 the road, outside the church. It is an
 old preaching cross,  possibly earlier
 than Norman times. It is a stone shaft
 with a cross on top and with a square 
 base.
