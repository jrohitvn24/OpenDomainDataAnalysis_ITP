		<title>05Under Whitle, near Longnor</title>
		<content>     I live at Under Whitle, one and a 
half miles from Longnor.  It used to   
have 119 acres when Captain Finney used
to rent it out but now it has only 52. 
We had our mains water and electricity 
put in about two and a half years ago. 
                                       
     Just across our field there is a  
cellar which used to belong to a house 
called Slacks Bank.                    
                                       
     A quarter of a mile to the        
south-east is a half-fallen down       
cottage called Meah Dowl.  It used to  
be rented out by Captain Finney.  It   
has no mains supplies and no drive.    
                                       
     Captain Finney lived at Broad     
Meadow which was built in the early    
17th century.  He was an alcoholic and 
had to sell his land to buy more drink.
