		<content>  All land in the Block is owned by    
 either Mr.D.Weston or J.L.Roughton    
 both of whom own very large farms.    
 The land in the Block is almost ent-  
 irely arable and increased mechaniz-  
 ation has meant better yields but also
 the loss of small farms and a rise in 
 unemployment locally.                 
  Britain belongs to the European Econ-
 omic Community and controls and incen-
 tives are placed on certain crops each
 year.On Mr.Roughton's farm this year  
 the following was grown:              
{ Land allocated            Crop       
   297.186 hectares      Oilseed rape  
   905.868    "          Winter wheat  
   105.856    "          Potatoes      
   180.652    "          Winter barley 
  Many ordinary people have said how   
 wrong it is that these yields are     
 beyond our needs and are stored       
 instead of feeding the world's hungry.</content>
