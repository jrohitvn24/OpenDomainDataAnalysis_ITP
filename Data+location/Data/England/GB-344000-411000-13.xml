		<title>13LANDSCAPE IN BURSCOUGH</title>
		<content>  The landscape between Burscough and  
Newburgh is one of the large flat      
fields separated by hedges and ditches.
  Drainage has always been a problem   
and the whole area needs constant      
attention to prevent flooding.         
  Very few large trees exist as the    
area is regularly swept by strong      
westerly winds. Some of the oldest     
drainage ditches have been given names 
such as Ellerbrook and Blackbrook.     
  Some of the farm buildings date back 
to approx. the 17th century but        
definite dating is difficult.  Most of 
the buildings in Burscough are dated   
1850 onwards following the construction
of the canal and railway systems.
