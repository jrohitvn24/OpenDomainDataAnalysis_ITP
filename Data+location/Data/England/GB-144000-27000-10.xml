		<content>  In Newlyn there is a green where     
 people can stroll or sit.There is     
 also a beach.The beach is very pebbly 
 and rocky and people do not normally  
 go on it.Farther along the green there
 is a putting green and tennis courts  
 where people can play.There is also a 
 bowling club which people join.In     
 Wherry Town there is a park which has 
 a roundabout,swings and a climbing    
 frame.Farther along people can play   
 crazy golf and next to the crazy golf 
 there is an amusement arcade.Then     
 people can walk along the promenade   
 to Penzance harbour.At the end of the 
 "prom"there is an out door bathing    
 pool which has sea water in it.People 
 can walk around the side of the pool  
 and can dive into the sea if they want
 to.
