		<content>   did bills in his book and he has    
 also done poems.                      
   There was also a butcher who came to
 the Coach and Horses pub in Hemingby  
 to sell his meat and other food like  
 pies and other kinds of foods.        
   Miss Brader remembers when there    
 used to be a mill in Hemingby.Mr      
 Burnet used to be the baker. The mill 
 ground the wheat till it was flour    
 then the baker would bake bread buns  
 and bread loaves then he would go     
 round the villagers. But the mill     
 closed down because they found a      
 better method of grinding corn.After a
 while the mill burnt down but they    
 didnt know who started it or whether  
 it was natural causes.
