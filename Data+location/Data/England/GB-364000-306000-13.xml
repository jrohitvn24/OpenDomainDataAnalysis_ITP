		<title>13THE PUBS IN THE AREA 1</title>
		<content> There is a long tradition of public   
 houses in the area. Perhaps it is a   
 response to the industrial traditions,
 where people engaged in heavy industry
 need to drink to escape from hard     
 repetitive physical labour. There are 
 seven pubs in the area and in their   
 way they reflect the changes being    
 wrought upon new town communities.    
 They are also the only sources of     
 local entertainment. Each has its own 
 character; though they can be divided 
 into two groups: the 'locals' and     
 'service' pubs. The locals, 'The      
 Foresters Arms', 'Travellers' Joy',   
 the 'Cheshire Cheese', and the 'White 
 Horse', are all committed to serving  
 their 'locals', offering              
 entertainment, sport, and cameraderie 
 with their pub teams in darts, pool   
 and snooker, football and dominoes.
