		<title>03WALSDEN  Houses</title>
		<content>     In{Walsden}there are quite a few  
 different types of houses.{Back to    
{back}houses are the most common. These
 houses are called back to back because
 they are two houses with their backs  
 joined to each other.                 
     There are also some houses called 
{over and unders.}These houses are     
 built on hills and they have two      
 storeys. Each storey is a different   
 house and each has its own door. The  
 second storey has a door on top of the
 hill and the first storey has a door  
 at the bottom.                        
     There are also some modern houses 
 in Walsden, most are{bungalows}       
 although there are a few{detached}and 
{semi-detached}houses that are modern. 
 Some{flats}have been built fairly     
 recently and some people are          
 converting old houses into modern     
 flats.                                </content>
