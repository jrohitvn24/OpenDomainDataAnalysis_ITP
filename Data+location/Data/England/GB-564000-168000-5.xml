		<content> The village contains many terraced    
 Georgian buildings and also a lot of  
 houses built between 1910-1950.       
 Surprisingly,though,there are not many
 Victorian buildings.The Darnley Arms  
 is the only medieval building left-but
 the walls are concealed by a Georgian 
 facade.There are a fair number of     
 modern houses,but developement has    
 been limited.In the main street the   
 majority of the houses are terraced.  
 The modern dwellings are detatched    
 and semi-detatched houses and         
 bungalows.There has been no 'estate'  
 developement,and any proposals for new
 buildings has been carefully examined 
 to ensure that the character of the   
 village remains intact.               
     The vast majority of the          
 properties are owner-occupied.
