<title>20Water in the Vale of Allen 2011</title>
<content>

The water supply comes from Stanbridge Mill Water Treatment works, situated beside the River Allen. The works is owned by Sembcorp Bournemouth Water. The site was first developed between 1946 and 1950 when two 700mm diameter 92m deep boreholes were sunk into the chalk. This was expanded by the addition of two new 900mm diameter 152m boreholes in 1965. The site is licensed to provide a maximum of 12.5 million litres of water per day which is enough to supply over 80,000 homes (175,000 people).&lt;br />&lt;br />The station is unmanned and is operated automatically with remote control from the company's Alderney Water Treatment Works 11miles  away. Borehole pumps pump the water 1.5miles via a 70mm diameter steel pipe from the site to the 9.5 million litre Chalbury storage reservoir which is 100m above sea level. From here it gravity feeds potable water to the surrounding area including Cranborne, Verwood, Sixpenny Handley and Wimborne via a network of distribution mains.   &lt;br />
