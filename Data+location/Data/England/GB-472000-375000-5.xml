		<title>05FARMING LOCALLY</title>
		<content> A local farmer and his wife gave the  
 following information about their     
 farm. They own 480 acres of farm land 
 with 95 young beef cattle, 210 sheep, 
 4 horses and some ducks. They use     
 their cows for meat only. The best    
 harvest was in 1984.                  
  The average rainfall for this area is
 only 20-25 inches per year. This is   
 the lowest rainfall in Britain. The   
 crops that are grown on this farm are 
 wheat, barley, oilseed rape, sugar    
 beet, potatoes and grass for hay. All 
 these crops are very important to the 
 farmer, they are all needed as much as
 each other. They use 4 labourers on   
 the farm. The workers are used for    
 mending fences and machinery. They    
 have 4 tractors, 1 combine-baler, a   
 potato planter, potato lifter, some   
 drills, a sugarbeet lifter, ploughs,  
 harrows and a potato riddle.          </content>
