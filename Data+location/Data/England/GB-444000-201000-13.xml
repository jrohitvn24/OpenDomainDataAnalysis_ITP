		<title>13The Hamlet of Eaton</title>
		<content> Eaton is a small farming community    
 built  on  land belonging to St John's
 College.  The Manor House, now a farm-
 house,  was  built  in   1677  by  the
 college as a refuge for Dons trying to
 scape  the plague.  The five original 
  arms  are  now amalgamated into two -
  anor Farm and West Farm.             
     There are only 60 people living in
 Eaton,some farmers and some commuters,
 all over 50 years old.  The houses are
 too  expensive  for  younger people to
 buy. Only one house is recently built,
 it  being  very  difficult  to  obtain
 planning permission.                  
     An  excellent  closeknit community
 spirit   is  enjoyed  by  longstanding
 residents and relative newcomers.  The
 local  pub, 'The Eight Bells' , has  a
 darts team and an Aunt Sally team.  It
 is  reputed  to  be{haunted}by a ghost
 known as Libby.                       </content>
