		<title>09 GREAT EAST STANDEN MANOR</title>
		<content>  Great East Standen manor dates back  
 from 1086 when it was held by William 
 Fitzstur. In the Domesday book it is  
 called Standone. In 1503 Princess     
 Cicely, a daughter of Edward IV came  
 to live at the manor on her marriage  
 to Richard Keynes, an islander. In    
 1603 the Earl of Southampton, Captain 
 of the Island, lived here. He         
 constructed a bowling green on nearby 
 St.Georges Down. Regular meetings were
 held for local gentry including the   
 Oglanders from Nunwell and the        
 Worsleys from Appuldurcombe, all      
 famous Isle of Wight families.        
   The present manor house was built in
 1737, It has had alterations over the 
 years. Its secluded position made it  
 ideal for involvement in smuggling in 
 the 18th centry. The present owner    
 enjoys a quiet country manor only 3km 
 from the centre of Newport.           </content>
