		<title>01A DAY IN MY LIFE.ALEX AGE 8</title>
		<content> I usually wake up before 7.00a.m. i   
 sometimes watch T.V a.m. before my    
 breakfast.I have 2 Weetabix with sugar
 and milk for breakfast. At twenty to  
 nine I go to school. Register is taken
 at 9.00a.m. Then we do some solfa     
 singing for ten minutes After that we 
 do assignments.I choose what I want to
 do out of maths, storywriting, topic  
 work and study skills. Sometimes mums 
 come in to help us with art or sewing.
 After assignments we go out to play at
 half past ten. When I come in from    
 play it is time for swimming. We go in
 two groups of 15 children at a time. I
 can front crawl, back crawl and turn  
 head over heels. After swimming it is 
 dinner play. At twenty to one we wash 
 and go up to the hall for dinner.
