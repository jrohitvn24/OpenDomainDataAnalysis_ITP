		<title>18SCHOOL GAMES II BROOMFIELD</title>
		<content>  {45 Home}is a game played by at least
 three people.One person is 'it' and   
 the rest have to hide.There is an     
 objective post and the people hiding  
 have to get to the post and say "45   
 Home" before the person 'it' can say  
 "45 Fred."                            
    The person 'it' has to count to 45 
 before the getting to the post        
 procedure begins.                     
    If the person 'it' says "45 Fred"  
 before Fred gets to the post he       
 becomes 'had'.The first person in each
 game to be 'had' becomes 'it'.        
    If no-one is 'had'then the person  
 who was 'it' remains 'it'.            
    In some games however,the last     
 person to get to the post and not be  
 'had', says "45 Home save all!",and   
 all the people that were had, become  
 'unhad".                              
    There is no time limit to get home.</content>
