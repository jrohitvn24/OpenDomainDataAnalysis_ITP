		<title>20THE CHURCHES</title>
		<content> The villages of Windrush and Sherborne
 share the school,shop and Post Office,
 all situated in Sherborne,but each has
 retained its church.Sherborne,pop 350,
 has suffered much from the personal   
 tastes and alterations of more than   
 one generation of the Dutton family,  
 who met the costs themselves.Now they 
 no longer own the estate,it is in     
 serious structural condition,both     
 inside and out,and estimates of up to 
 Â£85,000 have been submitted.Promises  
 to meet much of this have been made by
 Americans who own flats in Sherborne  
 House.Attendance at Sunday worship is 
 small.Windrush is a smaller community 
 of 120,including weekend visitors,who 
 take a lively interest in the Church  
 and its activities,and the result is a
 well supported church,both in worship 
 and finance,and in good order         
 structually.     Colin McCarter,Vicar.</content>
