		<content> During the summer months many of the  
 gardens in the area are opened to the 
 public.Entrance fees are donated to a 
 named charity such as nurses' homes.  
 On June 16th, 1985, six gardens could 
 be visited for Â£1 in aid of           
 Conservative Party funds. Pembroke    
 Manor joined in this scheme. It       
 specialises in wildfowl and ornamental
 pheasants although wild mink living in
 the nearby stream constantly deplete  
 the stocks.Now one house, Pembroke    
 manor was originally three cottages   
 for farm workers at New Place Farm.   
 The house and garden are maintained by
 a family of four living in a nearby   
 converted stable block. In exchange   
 for their labour,for which they are   
 paid, they have full access to the    
 leisure facilities in the grounds.    
 These include a swimming pool, tennis 
 court, croquet lawn and billiard room.</content>
