		<title>11Oakley Church</title>
		<content> The church dedicated to St. Mary      
 is built in stone.   The tower is the 
 oldest part of the building dating    
 from the middle of the twelth century.
 The tower clock has only one hand and 
 is one of the oldest in this country, 
 built in 162O it still keeps accurate 
 time.   In the churchyard is part of  
 an old cross,  originally used as an  
 outdoor pulpit, now listed as an      
 ancient monument.   Anabel            
 Chamberlain, daughter of Sir Richard  
 lies buried in the wall of the church,
 for when she died she hadn't decided  
 where to be buried.   By the north    
 door is a parish chest, the lid       
 consisting of a roughly hollowed out  
 tree trunk.   The east window contains
 fragments of coloured glass, all that 
 was left after a scorching farm fire. 
  The font was built in the C15th and  
 is built out of stone.                </content>
