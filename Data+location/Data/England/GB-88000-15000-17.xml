   It was the first day back at school 
 after the Whit Holidays. I had just   
 got back from dinner when Graeme, my  
 friend, ran into school and said Kit, 
 James, and Robert had all been on the 
 same bike and had fallen off it.      
   They had to go to hospital. James   
 had a little cut on the head and Kit's
 nose was bleeding and Robert had a big
 cut on his forehead.                  
   Then we had to go into the infants  
 because Mr.Kirk was phoning people up 
 to tell them about the accident.      
   Robert had to stay at hospital over 
 night because he had concussion. Kit  
 had to go to the dentist the next day 
 because he had chipped his teeth when 
 he had fallen off the bike.
