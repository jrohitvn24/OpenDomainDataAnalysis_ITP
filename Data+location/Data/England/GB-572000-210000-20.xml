		<title>20WEATHER FLORA BOREHAM NORTH</title>
		<content> Winter 1984/85 was very cold with lots
 of snow,and hard frosts.Spring was    
 late and when we started the survey in
 April, the weather was cold the sky   
 was grey, and many trees were bare.   
 Now that we have finished in mid-July 
 the weather is warm and sunny,although
 we have had some very heavy rain      
 showers.Trees are in leaf and gardens 
 are gay with many flowers, including  
 roses in full bloom.The wheat is      
 almost ripe and beginning to change   
 colour.We found the survey            
 interesting,and we found out a lot    
 about the area. All the people we     
 approached were helpful.              
 Alison Baxter, Heather Buck, Edward   
 Cook, Guy Hammond, Adam Hibbert,      
 Samantha Newland, Kim Rayner, Emma    
 Riley, Mathew Starling, Katy Ward.    
 Our ages vary between 8 and 9 years.
