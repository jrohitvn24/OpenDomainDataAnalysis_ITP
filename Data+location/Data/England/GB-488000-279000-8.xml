		<title>08Warkton Church, Kettering.</title>
		<content>   Unlike many of the Northamptonshire 
churches St. Edmund's Church, Warkton  
has a tower rather than a spire.       
   The church dominates the village    
rising majestically above the          
surrounding stone cottages.            
   Since its Norman and Gothic         
origins the church has been restored   
twice.                                 
   Inside there are 18th.and 19th.     
century monuments to the Montagu family
of Boughton House. Two of them are by  
the rococo sculptor Louis Roubiliac and
are set in apses and decorated with    
many cherubs and urns.                 
    Some local people feel that the    
church should be associated with       
Weekley rather than being part of      
the Barton Seagrave group of churches  
    Others feel sad that the 5 bells   
are seldom rung except by visitors     
who have rung many peals.              </content>
