		<title>08THE EFFECT OF BROUGH BYPASS</title>
		<content> THE BYPASS HAS SPLIT BROUGH AND CHURCH
 BROUGH IN HALF.IT WAS BUILT NINE YEARS
 AGO.IT MAKES A GREAT DIFFERENCE.      
                                       
 BEFORE IT WAS BUILT THERE USED TO BE  
 TRAFFIC GALORE.THE SHOPS MADE GOOD    
 TRADE BUT SOMETIMES RAN OUT OF STOCK. 
 THE PETROL GARAGE WAS BUSY AS WELL AND
 WAITERS WERE RUSHED OFF THEIR FEET IN 
 THE CAFES AND NEVER ENOUGH SEATS TO   
 SIT DOWN.                             
                                       
 NOW EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED. THE SHOPS 
 ARE QUIET AND ALWAYS HAVE ENOUGH FOOD 
 AND THE CAFES ARE EMPTY AND ALSO ONE  
 PETROL STATION HAS CLOSED DOWN.       
                                       
 NOW YOU CAN TURN A CAR ROUND IN  THE  
 MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. BUT IF THE BYPASS 
 HADN'T BEEN BUILT A LOT OF PEOPLE     
 WOULD NOT HAVE GOT ROAD BUILDING JOBS.
