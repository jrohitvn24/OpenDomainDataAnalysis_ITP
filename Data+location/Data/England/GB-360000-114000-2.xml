		<title>02EMPLOYMENT, SHERBORNE</title>
		<content>  Though there is a high proportion of 
 retired people in the area, Sherborne 
 has a number of important employers.  
  Major factories are Marglass, descr_ 
 ibed separately, and Seymour's, a pro_
 ducer and distributor of soft drinks  
 for over a 100 years. There is also a 
 creamery and engineering works. Incr_ 
 easing use of machinery has resulted  
 in a drift of workers away from       
 agriculture.                          
  Woolworth's and Denner's department  
 stores are leaders in the compact but 
 comprehensive shopping centre. Local  
 schools with boarding facilities also 
 provide substantial local employment. 
  Male unemployment in the area is at  
 present 9.1%. School leavers are in_  
 creasingly resorting to the government
 sponsored job creation scheme which   
 can provide the opportunity for train_
 ing and perhaps a full_time job.      </content>
