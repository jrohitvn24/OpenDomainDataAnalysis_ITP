		<title>17POCKET MONEY SURVEY,HESSLE</title>
		<content> A survey amongst 9 year old primary   
 schoolchildren about pocket money     
 revealed the following results:       
     {8%}were given no pocket money    
    {14%}were given{20p}per week       
    {27%}were given{50p}per week       
    {28%}were given{Â£1} per week       
     {7%}were given{Â£1.20}per week     
     {9%}were given{Â£1.50}per week     
     {7%}were given{Â£2}per week        
 Inevitably the favourite purchases    
 were sweets - often from one          
 particular newsagents shop (Turnbulls)
 in Hessle Square, but the survey also 
 found that many children also saved   
 some of their pocket money by banking 
 it.
