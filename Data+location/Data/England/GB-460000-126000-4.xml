		<title>04History in Bramdean</title>
		<content> Bramdean was first placed on record   
 under the name 'Bradandene' in AD908. 
 The name means 'the broad valley'.  It
 was also mentioned in the original    
 Domesday Book as 'Brondean'.  It was  
 close to the Pilgrim's Way from       
 Winchester to Canterbury.  Centuries  
 later the Cromwellian forces occupied 
 the village.  In the early 19th       
 century the remains of a Roman Villa  
 were discovered, but the mozaic floor 
 has been lost with time.  The church  
 dates from the 12th century and traces
 of 2 Norman windows were discovered in
 1985.  There are several beautiful old
 manor houses and numerous cottages and
 residences of an interesting and      
 historical nature. The village retains
 its old world charm despite the       
 nearness of the busy A272 road
