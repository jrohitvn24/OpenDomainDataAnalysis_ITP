		<title>01INTRODUCTION - SOUTH SHIRLEY</title>
		<content> The south Shirley area is a classic   
 urban fringe-where town meets         
 country.It is fairly level,130 to 150 
 m.in height.In the eighties it is     
 changing fast.The countryside is being
 devoured by the relentless spread of  
 housing,industry and communications.On
 the following pages much can be seen  
 about the "old days",when the area was
 a farming area.                       
 Shirley is closely tied to            
 communications-the Stratford          
 Canal,Birmingham-Stratford railway    
 line and the main A34                 
 Birmingham-Stratford trunk road all   
 cross the area from north to          
 south.                                
 Today the people of Shirley are       
 generally affluent-most live in good  
 homes,are in employment(especially    
 tertiary)and they enjoy varied leisure
 facilities with frequent holidays.    </content>
