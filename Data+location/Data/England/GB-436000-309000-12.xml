		<title>12Churches at Heather</title>
		<content> The Church holds together past village
 history and Christian mission today.  
 It was founded as a Chapel for the    
 Knights of St.John, who held the Manor
 and lands of Heather and had a        
 Preceptory there from about the time  
 of Henry II, 1154-1189, until the     
 dissolution of the Order of the       
 Knights of St.John, 1535.  Four out of
 five Rectors of Heather were Priors of
 the Hospital of St.John from          
 1220-1301.  Coats of Arms in stained  
 glass windows link Heather with       
 Knights of the old Order and the      
 re-founded Order of St. John in       
 England.  Arms of the Prior of        
 Clerkenwell link a former Preceptory  
 to the Priory of Clerkenwell, now the 
 H.Q. of the Knights of St. John and   
 the St. John Ambulance Brigade, and   
 their flags hang in the Church.
