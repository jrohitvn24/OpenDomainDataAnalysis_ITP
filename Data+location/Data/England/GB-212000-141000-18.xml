		<content> on William de Marisco by Henry II     
 remained unpaid.In 1237 William de    
 Marisco was implicated in a plot to   
 murder Henry III.In 1242 a Norfolk    
 baron with 13 men managed to land on  
 Lundy in mist and William and his     
 followers were captured and taken to  
 London.William was tried-and then hung
 drawn and quartered.                  
 Marisco Castle has nothing to do with 
 the Mariscos (they lived at Bull's    
 Paradise).It was built by an agent of 
 the crown after the expulsion of the  
 Mariscos.                             
 In the late 1500s Lundy was a base    
 for several notorious pirates.In 1625 
 three Turkish pirates were in         
 occupation and in the 1630's the      
 notorious Captain John Nutt used it as
 one of his headquarters.              
 In 1643 Thomas Bushell became govenor 
 of the castle for King Charles.{(cont)</content>
