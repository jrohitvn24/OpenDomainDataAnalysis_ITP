		<title>05Local History-Medbourne Area</title>
		<content> Evidence in recent times has shown    
 that there were several large Roman   
 settlements in the area along the line
 of the Roman Road including a large   
 town where Medbourne now stands, the  
 name of which is Anglo Saxon - meadow 
 stream; unchanged since the original  
 Domesday book. Evidence of Saxon      
 occupation have also been discovered  
 in fields that have recently come     
 under the plough. The oldest house    
 in Medbourne is the Manor House dating
 from the late 13th. century.  The     
 ironstone for the older houses was    
 originally obtained from Nevill Holt  
 quarry - now disused. The valley was  
 famous for it's beef cattle brought in
 for fattening on the rich grass       
 pastures - many of the roads and lanes
 were originally used by drovers       
 walking the cattle to the pastures.
