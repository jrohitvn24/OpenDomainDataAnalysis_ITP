		<content> Part of the area north of the M57     
 motorway, is a large overspill estate 
 called Hattersley. The people who live
 there were rehoused from Manchester,  
 the first moving into their new houses
 over 14 years ago. The Housing policy 
 at the time, which moved people from  
 familiar, though very poor housing,   
 areas, was controversial. Some of the 
 people who moved there did so because 
 they wanted to. Some, however, were   
 forced by Local Councils to make the  
 move; i.e. they were rehoused outside 
 their own neighbourhoods.             
 Originally the area was farmland,     
 mainly pasture. Today there are still 
 dairy cattle in fields around the     
 estate, and some  arable land to      
 the north of the M57.                 
 Today there is a thriving Community   
 Group on the estate who try to support
 those who live there.                 </content>
