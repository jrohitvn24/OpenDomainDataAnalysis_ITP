		<title>09    BEBINGTON HOUSING</title>
		<content> The oldest and most tigthly packed    
 housing is the pre-1914 clustering of 
 houses by the junction of Old Chester 
 Rd and Kings Lane.  Here some large   
 Victorian houses have been converted  
 into commercial premises, and there   
 are terraces in Woodburn Boulevard. It
 is  clearly possible to visualise this
 as being the only{"built up"}part of  
 the whole area in 1900.  During the   
 interim period, with the development  
 of more suburbs whith semi-detached{  
{housing}rather than terracing the area
 developed in this way.  Only here and 
 there, along Kings Rd specially, are  
 there houses which are clearly of the 
 post 1945 period.  The large{Bebington
{Cemetary}was developed early in the   
 century and covers a significant      
 amount of land.It is hardly surprising
 that there are a large number of      
 schools built to serve the population.</content>
