		<title>13STREET NAMES IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content> We looked at the map showing all the  
 streets near school and then tried to 
 find out{how they got their}names.This
 is what we found.8 streets were named 
 after{famous poets}e.g.Tennyson Street
 Ruskin Crescent Bacon Street.Some were
 near Nunroyd Park,so they were called 
 Park Road or Park Grove.Cemetery Road 
 was near the cemetery,and Banksfield  
 Avenue was near the hill we call the  
 Banks.Southview Crescent and Close    
 were facing south.Some of the others  
 weren't as easy to work out.There     
 must have been lots of{forests}here   
 before they built the houses where we 
 live because there is Coppice Wood    
 Avenue,Hawthorn Road and Shaw Leys.We 
 found out that Ley meant a{clearing in
{the forest.}Newlands Avenue might have
 been in a clearing.Queensway is a     
 modern road called after our queen.
