		<content>{A DAY IN THE LIFE OF VANESSA}         
  On most Saturday's I get up and go   
 downstairs to have my breakfast.I turn
 on the television to make my cereal   
 more interesting.When I have had my   
 cereal,I put some bread in the        
 toaster.I stand watching T.V. until my
 toast pops up.When it pops up,I take  
 it over to the table,so I can spread  
 some butter on,and some peanut        
 butter.When I have had my toast,I go  
 to the fridge and get a carrot for    
  my guinea_pig.I then go up stairs to 
 get dressed.I put my riding clothes   
 on.I go into the bathroom to have     
 a wash,and to clean my teeth.I go     
 downstairs again and have a cup of tea
 or coffee.My mum is normally ready so 
 we go outside and get into the car.We 
 drive four miles down to where I keep 
 my pony.
