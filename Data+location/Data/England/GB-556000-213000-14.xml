		<title>14Churches in the Rodings</title>
		<content> There are four churches in our area,  
 three are Church of England Churches  
 and one is a Congregational Church.   
 St.Martin's Church is in White Roding,
 It was built nearly 900 years ago,    
 probably just before the Norman       
 Conquest. It is the largest of the    
 Roding Churches, and the name of the  
 village is usually attributed to the  
 white colour of the rubble of which   
 the Church was built. St. Micheal and 
 All Angels Church is in Leaden Roding.
 Leaden is thought to have been so     
 named because the church was the first
 in the area to have a lead roof. It is
 the oldest in the Roding's group some 
 of it dating from the latter part of  
 the 11th century.It is a small        
 building in the Norman style.The      
 Congregational Church is in White     
 Roding. St.Mary's Church in Aythorpe  
 Roding was bulit in the 13th. Century.</content>
