		<title>09BEAUMONT LEYS ESTATE</title>
		<content> Like all built up areas, Beaumont Leys
 was once open countryside used for    
 agriculture. Unlike other built-up    
 areas however it still retains many   
 remnants of that former countryside.  
 Fields, hedgerows and woods have been 
 retained within the development of    
 housing estates and industrial areas. 
 The open spaces support a great       
 variety of wild plants and animals and
 allow people immediate access to the  
 country.                              
 Beaumont Leys is a major growth point 
 situated to the North West of the City
 of Leicester covering 1900 acres. The 
 area is a plateau running from the SW 
 to the NE at a height of approx 90    
 metres above sea level. In the east   
 the land slopes down to the valley of 
 the River Soar.
