		<content>    There is no street lighting in     
 Grimley or Sinton Green. The mobile   
 library comes every 1st and 3rd Fri-  
 days of the month. During the summer  
 hedges are trimmed and verges and the 
 Green are mown. The refuse collection 
 takes place on a Friday. There is     
 mains water to most houses. Grimley   
 has septic tank drainage.             
    The roads are in reasonable condi- 
 tion, although few of them have pave- 
 ments so that walking is hazardous,   
 particularly for children. During     
 heavy rain the road near the Post Off-
 ice in Grimley frequently gets flood- 
 ed, although there are drains where   
 pavements exist. The roads are gritted
 in icy conditions.                    
    There is no recreation ground for  
 children, although impromptu games can
 be played on Sinton Green.
