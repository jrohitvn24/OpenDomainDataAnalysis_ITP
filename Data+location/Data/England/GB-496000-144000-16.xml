		<content> In 1945 the schools had their own     
 garden. The children who went to Moss 
 Lane had what is now Waitrose carpark.
 The children had to go to school until
 they were 14. School ended at 4.00pm. 
 The food used to be mostly the same.  
 There wasn't so many sweet and fancy  
 things. The bread used to be 2 or 3   
 pennies. There used to be lots and    
 lots of sweet shops but no            
 supermarkets. There were hairdressers 
 and in the barbers the men and boys   
 were given a short back and sides in  
 no time at all. People mainly         
 travelled by bus or horse and cart,   
 there were no cars. The population was
 much smaller. Boys wore short         
 trousers. Men wore leather shoes and  
 thick shirts and wide trousers. They  
 wore more hats and caps in those days.
