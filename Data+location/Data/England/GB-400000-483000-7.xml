 small goal posts as well.

 have to run to one of the posts and   
 back to get a run .Unlike rounders the
 bowler bowls when he is ready even if 
 the batsman is not  back.

 are four posts and you hit the ball   
 and then run round the posts to get a 
  rounder but some times you don't     </content>
