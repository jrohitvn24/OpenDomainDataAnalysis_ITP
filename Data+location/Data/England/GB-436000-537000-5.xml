		<title>05Wingate - Telephone Exchange</title>
		<content>    Recently a{new telephone exchange  
 was{opened}in Wingate.{Normally}the   
 automatic exchange building is        
{unmanned,}but often the manager and   
 his engineers are there installing new
 lines and checking for faults.        
    The exchange was{built in 1982.}It 
 took{three years to install the       
{equipment.}It was impossible to count 
 all the wires we could see. There are 
 about{two thousand lines}serving only 
 Wingate.                              
    It is{powered by special batteries 
 which run from the main electricity   
 supply, but it has its own{standby    
{generator}in case of a power cut. In  
 an emergency, 'phones always have to  
 be working.{Each line has a meter     
 which is{photographed when the bills  
{are due}so that any queries can be    
 answered. Until this exchange was     
 built it was an operator only service.</content>
