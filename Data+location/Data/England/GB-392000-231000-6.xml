		<content> When you go into the factory you have 
 to wear special protective glasses to 
 stop sparks going in your eyes.1300   
 people work there. Dowty's income     
 from selling pitprops is about        
 Â£70,000,000 a year .In the factory    
 where they were making pressure valves
 for the pitprops,there were robots    
 doing jobs.There were machines that   
 drilled holes in metal.Next we went   
 into the machine shop where they built
 the actual legs and pitprops.In the   
 paint room there were two big         
 vacuums to get out the paint fumes.   
 Afterwards we went to the room where  
 they pack the pitprops and load them  
 up onto lorries.Then we went to the   
 store room and there were four lifts  
 to get to the racks you wanted to.We  
 had a ride on them.It was really good.
