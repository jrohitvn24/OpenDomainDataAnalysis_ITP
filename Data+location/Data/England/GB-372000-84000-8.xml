		<content> Apart from main roads,there are many  
 minor roas &amp; bridleways.Parts of      
 Warmwell &amp; Broadmayne have no         
 pavements especially dangerous as     
 traffic often exceeds the 30mph speed 
 limit.The nearest railway station is  
 Dorchester:4 miles.Services connect to
 London &amp; Bristol.The decline in rural 
 bus servies is exemplified by their   
 infrequency.Warmwell only has a school
 bus.The last bus on Saturdays reaches 
 Broadmayne at 21.45hrs.No buses run on
 Sundays.More buses run on Wednesdays &amp;
 Saturdays.There are some workers'     
 buses &amp; some private contractors e.g. 
 Dorset Queen Coaches.Most households  
 own cars,many more than one,often in  
 consequence of living in a rural area.
 People need cars for employment,      
 recreation,taking children to school &amp;
 for a varied social life.
