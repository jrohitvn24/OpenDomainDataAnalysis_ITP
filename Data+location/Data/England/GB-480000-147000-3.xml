		<title>03TYPES OF HOMES</title>
		<content>   In our area we have 7 main types of 
 homes.Terraced,semi_detached,detached,
 maisonettes,local flint houses,flats  
 and bungalows.Most of our area is     
 filled with terraced and semi         
 detached.                             
{Terraced_ }We saw a lot of terraced   
 houses.They were made of bricks and   
 tiles.The gardens are small and some  
 have sheds.The sheds are made out of  
 gravel.                               
{Semi detached_  }The semi detached    
 houses are made of bricks and tiles   
 the gardens are a bit bigger than the 
 terraced.They have sheds as well sa   
 the terraced  they are made of gravel.
{Detached_ }some of the detached houses
 were made of bricks and tiles some    
 where stone some where flint.They had 
 big gardens.
