		<content> About half of the people in this area 
 are families who have lived in the    
 area for a long time.                 
 Others have moved into the area       
 because they have chosen to live in   
 the country. The small farms on the   
 hill have enough land for people to   
 keep horses, and when the houses are  
 modernised they are attractive to     
 town people.                          
 People are able to travel to          
 Kidderminster and Birmingham to work. 
 The usual number of children in a     
 family is two. There are many houses  
 which are occupied by retired people, 
 some who have previouly worked in the 
 area.                                 
 In Cleeton St Mary there are four     
 almshouses for elderly people, who    
 have lived in the parishes of Cleeton 
 or Nash.                              
                                      .</content>
