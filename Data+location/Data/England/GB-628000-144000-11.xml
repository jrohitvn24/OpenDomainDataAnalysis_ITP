		<title>11Hammonds Garage, Whitfield</title>
		<content>The building of the Dover by-pass has  
greatly expanded the garage business   
which started off modestly as a wooden 
shed over 40 years ago.                
The garage is open 24 hours a day. It  
faces Whitfield roundabout where 6     
roads converge. Average annual petrol  
sales of 65,000 gallons per week or 3.5
million gallons a year make it the     
busiest petrol station in Europe. Site 
storage capacity is 80,000 gallons     
maintained by 620 tanker deliveries a  
year. The self-service petrol and      
diesel pumps are positioned on 2       
forecourts. A computer link from pump  
to cash till indicates amount of each  
sale and can reveal how much petrol    
remains in storage. The garage business
has diversed to satisfy consumer demand
and includes snack bar and retail      
facilities for groceries, sweets, toys,
medicine, papers and camping gear.     </content>
