		<title>03LIBRARY AT WINDSOR CASTLE</title>
		<content> by David,Bradley                      
 Room 542 is the library at Windsor    
 Castle.It is on two floors with a     
 William IV ceiling,a long gallery     
 built for Elizabeth I to walk in on   
 rainy days.A half-spiral staircase    
 leads to the upper floor. This is the 
 third book collection begun in 1830.  
 King George IV gave the first         
 collection to the British Museum and  
 it is called the King's Library.There 
 are 50,000 books of historical topics,
 and a modern section of biographies,  
 works on the present Royal Family,the 
 Commonwealth.Books are not loaned very
 often;recently a bible belonging to   
 General Gordan of the Sudan was loaned
 to the National Portrait Gallery for  
 an exhibition.  Books are not         
 inter-changed with libraries in other 
 Royal residences.The library is not   
 open to the public:                   </content>
