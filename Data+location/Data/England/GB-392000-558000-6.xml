		<content> You would be wrong to think that there
 is not much to do here. There is a    
 thriving Young Farmer's Club,who have 
 a prizewinning Drama group, and a     
 Women's Institute who do a lot beside 
 making jam! The Shire football team   
 do very well in the League, and the   
 under-13s have a team too. There is   
 Saturday rounders in the summer, and  
 badminton and indoor bowls in the     
 winter. We have keen fishermen,bee    
 keepers,naturalists,and goat owners,  
 who do well at the local agricultural 
 shows.Some children have ponies, and  
 are members of the local pony club.   
 There is an annual sheepdog trial,    
 motor cycle scrambles are held on a   
 farm in the area, and there is a Keep 
 Fit class in the winter, and yoga all 
 year round. In September, the annual  
 Leek Show is held, when the keen      
 gardeners show their produce.         </content>
