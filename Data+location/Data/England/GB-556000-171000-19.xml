		<content>   St.Margaret's Church, Darenth was   
 built in 940.                         
   It is one of the oldest churches in 
 England.                              
   It has a porch, splayed windows, a  
 font, three arches, two carved stone  
 heads in the wall outside, a nave and 
 a bell tower.  There is St.Luke's Room
 at the side of the church.            
   People call it "The Little Church   
 Over The Hill".  St.Margaret's has    
 over a hundred graves. There are      
 faces on the posts to scare away evil 
 spirits.                              
   It has a Sunday School for children 
 to learn about God and Jesus.  About  
 twenty children go to Sunday School

 Sunday morning services.
