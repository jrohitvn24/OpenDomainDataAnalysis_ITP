		<title>14Transport &amp; services</title>
		<content> A{service bus}runs through Lastingham 
 &amp; Spaunton on Wednesdays &amp; every other
 Saturday to take people to the local  
 market towns. The same bus also       
 transports the children to schools    
 outside the area. A mini-bus service  
 calls at Cropton once a week. These   
 services &amp; a shared taxi arrangement  
 give independence to those without    
 their own transport. To some,this is  
 the only opportunity to leave the area
 although car owners are always happy  
 to offer lifts especially for visits  
 to the doctor. Cropton &amp; Lastingham   
 each have one general shop/post office
 &amp; there is a six day postal service.  
 Milk &amp; newspapers are delivered to the
 door &amp; mobile vans selling meat,fish &amp;
 bread call regularly. A mobile library
 visits the villages once a fortnight. 
 Most people need cars for work &amp; out  
 of village activities.                </content>
