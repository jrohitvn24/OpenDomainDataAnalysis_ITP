		<title>19OVERY STAITHE - GOOD &amp; BAD</title>
		<content> In winter Burnham Overy Staithe is not
 a pleasant place.  Not many people go 
 to stay in Overy in winter.  It is in 
 direct line with the North Pole, that 
 is why it is so cold in the winter.   
 You could say it is like a ghost town.
 In summer it is not like a ghost town 
 at all.  There are a lot of people in 
 Overy Staithe in summer.  Burnham     
 Overy is a beautiful place.  When the 
 tide is right people go crabbing, but 
 most people go down to the beach.     
 Almost everyone goes to see Gun Hill. 
 On a very hot day it is like being in 
 a pan of boiling water.  It used to be
 an enormous hill but now its just a   
 mound with a crater in the middle     
 which is very deep.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
