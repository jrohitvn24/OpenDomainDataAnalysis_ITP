This  block of land is situated where  
Birmingham's NE boundary changes into  
the rural farmland of Warwickshire and 
Staffordshire.                         
Most of the population lives in that   
quarter area of the block to the W and 
SW which is formed of residential      
housing being the NE part of Sutton    
Coldfield, a commuter suburb in NE     
Birmingham. Rail and road links to     
Birmingham city centre are good. It is 
regarded at best as an area of middle  
to upper-middle socio-economic status, 
well served by schools, having easy    
access to good shopping facilities     
locally, in Sutton's "Gracechurch      
Centre" and in the centre of Birmingham
The remaining three quarters of the    
block which form the central, northern,
southern and eastern sections are rural
farmland.                              </content>
