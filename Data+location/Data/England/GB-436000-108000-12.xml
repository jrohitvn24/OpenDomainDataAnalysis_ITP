		<content> The trains that go through Marchwood  
 do not carry any passengers because   
 the passenger line was closed about 20
 years ago.Instead it carries oil and  
 freight to and from the refinery.The  
 line was first built in the 1930's.It 
 is a single line track running from   
 Fawley to the main London to          
 Bournemouth line near Totton.2 years  
 ago, because the population had grown 
 so much, some people tried to get     
 British Rail to reopen the line but   
 they refused.                         
 Marchwood is also served by 3 bus     
 services.They are the services from   
 Southampton to Calshot, Fawley and    
 Lepe Beach respectively.Buses are     
 important to people in Marchwood      
 because many people work in Totton or 
 Southampton.Also Marchwood has few    
 shops and housewives without cars need
 buses so they can do their shopping.  </content>
