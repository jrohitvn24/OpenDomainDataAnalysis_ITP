		<title>06Hope Chapel, Blackboys.</title>
		<content> This Strict Baptist Chapel was built  
 in 1875. It stands near a main road   
 but once through the wrought iron     
 gates, the visitor is aware of the    
 peace of the environment. Apart from  
 one house adjoining the Chapel there  
 are no houses visible, only rough     
 pasture land and trees. There is a    
 small car park at the rear for the    
 congregation but on Sundays, when the 
 chapel is very well attended, people  
 have to park their cars on the grass  
 verges of the road. People from three 
 or four miles distance come to worship
 here. There are two services on Lord's
 Day, Sunday: one at 10.45am and a     
 later one at 1.45pm. On alternate     
 Wednesdays there is an evening service
 at 7.00pm while on Tuesday evenings   
 prayer meetings are held. A small     
 graveyard is neatly kept with horse   
 chestnut trees marking each corner.   </content>
