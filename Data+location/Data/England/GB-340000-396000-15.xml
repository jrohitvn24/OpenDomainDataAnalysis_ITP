		<title>15An afternoon at Kirkby C.E.</title>
		<content> School starts in the afternoon at 1.10
 at which time the afternoon register  
 is taken. The same 2 people who were  
 off in the morning were again absent. 
 Our teacher told us to change into our
 P.E. kit because we were to go into   
 the Hall to practice the sack race for
 sports day. After that we practiced   
 the flat race, egg and spoon and then 
 the sack race again but for these we  
 went out on to the field.             
 When we came back into the classroom  
 we got changed and a story was read to
 us called "Help I am a Prisoner in    
 the Toothpaste Factory."              
 At 2.30 we had playtime which lasted  
 for 15 minutes and I played tick with 
 my friends. When we came in we did    
 some work on plurals in our English   
 lesson. At 3.30 it was time to go home
 and I went to catch the 697 bus.
