		<title>09WAY OF LIFE, RANBY</title>
		<content>   In the days before the development  
 of a modern transport system, the     
 inhabitants of Ranby were employed for
 the most part in local agriculture.   
 Its isolation was broken with the     
 building of the Chesterfield Canal.   
 This bisects the village and must have
 made a great impact.                  
   The coming of motor transport has   
 had vital effects on the development  
 of the village. Its situation, within 
 easy reach of Sheffield, Worksop and  
 Retford has made it attractive to     
 commuters.                            
   This was enhanced when the Ranby    
 by-pass scheme was completed in 1966. 
 It eliminated through traffic from the
 village, dangerous bends, and the     
 notorious Ranby roundabout.           
   In 1974 further development was     
 approved and to a certain extent      
 Ranby has become a dormitory village. </content>
