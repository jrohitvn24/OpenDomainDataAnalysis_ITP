		<title>07TOWER'S FARM</title>
		<content> This farm is owned by Edward Towers.  
 At the moment he is having an open    
 season. People can come and watch the 
 milking of his goats. Also on sale is 
 his ewes milk and ewes cheese. This is
 the commercial part of his  farm, he  
 appeared on a television programme on 
 farming a while ago. This farm is a   
 subject of local interest as goats and
 ewes are not as widely spread         
 nowadays. Mrs Stevenson from Over     
 Kellet is employed in the dairy       
 section of this farm.The cheese, milk 
 and yoghurts are different from       
 ordinary products as they have a      
 sourer taste. The cheese is covered in
 wax to keep it germ free and fresh.   
 The wax is a yellowy cream colour. The
 cheese is sold to local villagers and 
 tourists he also sells it to the local
 shops.                         (cont)
