		<content> The Church of St.James the Deacon was 
  completed in 1971. Although          
 it is a modern Church there are many  
 features which are very interesting.  
 It is well worth a visit to see the   
 many features incorporated into the   
 building.                             
 The foundation stone is a medieval    
 coffin lid dated between 1400-1500    
 AD. It came from St.Maurices Church in
 York and was laid as the foundation   
 stone by Rt.Rev.Dr.Donald Cogan.      
 The high altar is made from blue      
 polished stone from Honiton in Devon  
 which came from the Church of the     
 College of St John, now defunct.The   
 crucifix and the everlasting light    
 came from St.Sampsons Church in York  
 as did the pews and the twelve        
 stations of the cross situated round  
 the walls.
