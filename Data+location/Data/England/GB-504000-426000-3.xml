		<title>03WEST HULL TRAFFIC CENSUS</title>
		<content>   THERE ARE THREE MAIN ROUTES INTO W. 
 HULL. THE AVERAGE WAS TAKEN OF THREE  
 CENSUS'S IN MID_AFTERNOON             
   ANLABY RD. HAD THE HIGHEST AVERAGE  
 OF CARS OF THE THREE ROADS WITH 274   
 PER HOUR IN EACH DIRECTION. THIS WAS  
 UNEXPECTED,ALTHOUGH IT IS A GOOD ROUTE
 TO MANY OUT OF TOWN COMMUNITIES. 80%  
 WERE LOCALLY REGISTERED CARS.         
   BOOTHFERRY RD. THE MIDDLE OF THE    
 THREE, LINKS DIRECTLY WITH THE M62 AND
 HAD THE HEAVIEST FLOW OF COMMERCIAL   
 VEHICLES WITH 233 IN AND 219 OUT PER  
 HOUR. ONLY 31% OF INWARD WAS LOCAL, A 
 THIRD WAS FROM THE SOUTH. A MORNING   
 SURVEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A HIGH % OF
 LOCAL TRAFFIC GOING OUT OF HULL.      
   HESSLE RD. TO THE SOUTH HAD 98      
 LORRIES PER HOUR OUT AND 66 IN; WITH A
 LOW 10% LOCALLY REGISTERED. 113 CARS  
 PER HOUR WITH ONLY 20% LOCAL.
