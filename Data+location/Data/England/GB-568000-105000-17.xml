		<title>17BIOGRAPHY, SHOP KEEPER</title>
		<content> THE LADY IN THE BIG VILLAGE SHOP TOLD 
 US THAT SHE HAD LIVED IN NORMANS BAY  
 FOR 50 YEARS, WHEN HER MOTHER HAD THE 
 SHOP BUILT. THERE HAD BEEN A FEW      
 CHANGES, LIKE A FEW MORE HOUSES, A    
 CARAVAN PARK AND ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO
 THE OLD CHURCH WAS PULLED DOWN. SHE   
 LIKES NORMANS BAY BECAUSE IT IS QUIET 
 AND THE PEOPLE ARE FRIENDLY. IN THE   
 1939-45 WAR THE ARMY TOOK OVER ALL OF 
 NORMANS BAY. THE SHOP WAS USED AS     
 THEIR CANTEEN, AND AT THE BACK WERE   
 THEIR OFFICES. SHE HAD TO GO AWAY     
 DURING THE WAR, AND WHEN SHE RETURNED 
 THE SHOP WAS IN A TERRIBLE STATE.     
 THERE WAS NO FURNITURE LEFT.ANOTHER   
 LADY,MRS SMITH,HAD A SEARCH-LIGHT     
 BUILT AT THE SIDE OF HER HOUSE DURING 
 THE WAR. THE ROAD IS VERY BUMPY; IT IS
 PRIVATE, SO THEY HAVE A RESIDENTS     
 ASSOCIATION TO RAISE MONEY FOR ITS    
 UPKEEP. THEY CULTIVATE SEA KALE.      </content>
