   In Stoke Doyle there are five       
 bells.These range from the treble to  
 the tenor. The bells are situated     
 above the clock, with the bell-ropes  
 situated in the belfry below. These   
 bells are fairly easy to ring because 
 they have new ropes and are very      
 light.This tower has better facilities
 than Oundle although Oundle has more  
 bells &lt;8>. In the Oundle tower you    
 have to climb lots of stairs to reach 
 the ringing chamber. Also the Stoke   
 Doyle bells are in places which are   
 easy to see when ringing methods. The 
 clock is a nuisance at Oundle as it ia
 in a awkward place in front of the    
 number 2 bell. At Stoke Doyle the     
 clock is above the chamber and so out 
 of the way. All in all Stoke Doyle is 
 a good place to go for a ring!
