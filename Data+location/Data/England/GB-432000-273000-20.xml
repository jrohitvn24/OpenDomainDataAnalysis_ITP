		<title>20THE VILLAGE SHOP</title>
		<content> The village shop is seriously         
 threatened. Each of the three housing 
 areas has a neighbourhood service     
 centre.The retail outlets deal mainly 
 with 'convenience' goods which require
 frequent short journeys.Prices tend to
 be higher than in the town centre     
 supermarkets.Therefore most people,   
 owning a car, will tend to prefer the 
 in-town shops.The  regular customers  
 are usually the old and the infirm who
 lack transport and purchasing         
 power.The local shop does however     
 provide a friendly personal service   
 which is also a social benefit for    
 these people.Baginton has an old type 
 combined store comprising a Post      
 Office, a newsagents and a grocers.
