<title>212nd generation works in the control room</title>
<content>I have been looking at the pictures and articles of Staffordshire police dog training,horses and control room. Its funny how things have changed so much. My dad was a P.c on the mounted branch and my mum worked in the police control room back in that time and i used to visit all the time as  kid and now i work in the police control room and it is so different. These pictures bring back so many memories as we used to live in one of the police houses on the Cannock road site which is slowly all being knocked down now for redevelopment&lt;br />
