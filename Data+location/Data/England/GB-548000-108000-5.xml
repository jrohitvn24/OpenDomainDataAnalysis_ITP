      The Summer Flower Show.          
 Summertime and the flowers are on     
 display again. This time it is a far  
 grander show on the local village     
 cricket ground. Many tears have been  
 shed by gardeners who cannot get their
 beens to grow straight and endless    
 cakes have been cooked to get the     
 perfect one. The committee erect a big
 Marquee in which the exhibits are     
 staged. There are numerous stalls and 
 side shows outside on the grass of the
 cricket pitch. The afternoon is fine  
 and the tea ladies have to cover up   
 the iced cakes to stop them melting. A
 good time is had by all...            
      The Harvest Festival.            
 The summer's produce is put on display
 in the church and thanks is given for 
 another good year. A choral service   
 is held in one of the two churches.   </content>
