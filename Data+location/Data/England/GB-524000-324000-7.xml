		<title>07SPALDING SLUICE GATES</title>
		<content>    The{Sluice gates }are needed to    
 control the fresh {water level }and to
 prevent the tide from running through 
 Spalding. The gates control the level 
 of the water by lifting the doors on  
 the sluice so that the water in the   
 Coronation Channel runs out to the    
 sea.                                  
    The{gates}are made of steel        
 and the base and walls are made of    
 concrete. The{gates}are controlled    
 either manually or by electric powered
 motors which move the gates up and    
 down.                                 
{   Mr A Newton}is responsible for the 
 gates. He has to work regular hours.  
 this is due to the tides and boats    
 that may wish to come through the     
 gates. There are three sets of gates  
 in the area which operate together.   
    The gates will still be needed in  
 20-50 years time.                     </content>
