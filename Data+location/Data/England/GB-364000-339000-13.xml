 The village hall was given to the     
 village by Sir John Corbet. Money was 
 raised by a trust fund.The village    
 hall also includes the ground around  
 it - the Green, car park and bowling  
 green.The activities in the club are  
 Billiards, Snooker, Darts, Table      
 Tennis, and Pool. It is run by a      
 village hall committee of 14 members  
 who are responsible for the upkeep of 
 the hall. The club has its own bar for
 drinks. The number of people who go   
 there is 300. The most popular night  
 is Friday because parties and Whist   
 Drives are held then. Luckily Adderley
 has a hall. We can all meet there and 
 have fun. I go to the Youth Club and  
 Judo Club and we put on our school    
 entertainments there every Christmas.
