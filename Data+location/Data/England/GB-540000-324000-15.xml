		<title>15LIVING ON A FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
 Working on a farm now in 1985 is a    
 lot easier than it was about 100 years
 ago.Now we have tractors instead of   
 horses, which can go faster and have  
 more power. Horses got tired easily,  
 but tractors don't, although they can 
 breakdown! Farmers now have combine-  
 harvesters, which can harvest about 50
 acres a day, but 100 years ago you    
 harvested by hand, doing barely an    
 acre a day. Then you had to bundle the
 straw up. But with a bailer (An       
 automatic straw bundler,) you can do  
 it in less than half of the time. A   
 hundred years ago, setting seed was   
 done by hand. They put the seed in a  
 pouch, with their hand they scattered 
 the seed across the land.
