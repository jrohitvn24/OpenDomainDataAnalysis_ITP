		<title>08THE CAMP SITE</title>
		<content>   A Midhurst dentist died and left    
 land to the Camping Club.  He         
 wished it to remain unspoilt and so   
 the marvellous walks attract the      
 campers.  The camp site was           
 established in 1947.  People come from
 all over the world for their holidays.
  In the season they have about 1000   
 people a week and we supply the people
 with water, showers and toilets.  They
 have more caravans than tents         
 and we allow dogs if they are kept on 
 leads.  There is a small playground &amp; 
 a small shop selling gas &amp; general    
 groceries.  Tree roots are a problem  
 to tents &amp; there is no electricity,   
 but a cable has been laid.  Washing   
 and toilet facilities were put in 3   
 years ago.  It is the only camp site  
 in the world that has a bronze age    
 tumulas on site.  There is a resident 
 warden for 7 months of the year.      </content>
