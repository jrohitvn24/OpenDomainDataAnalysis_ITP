		<title>01Cock Clarks/Purleigh</title>
		<content>   Cock Clarks and Purleigh are the two
 main communities within the 12        
 kilometre square block. In addition   
 the hamlet of Hazeleigh lies just to  
 the North. Apart from these, the area 
 is predominantly rural, the vast      
 majority of the land being given over 
 to arable farming. There are          
 substantial areas of woodland and     
 numerous public footpaths traverse the
 locality.                             
   Isolated houses, both old and new,  
 and many smallholdings are dotted     
 around the region.                    
   Although really very close to the   
 neighbouring towns of Maldon, South   
 Woodham Ferrers and Chelmsford, this  
 area is remarkably "cut-off" and its  
 development as far as modern          
 ammenities is concerned is            
 surprisingly retarded.
