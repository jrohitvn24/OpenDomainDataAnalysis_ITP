		<title>06A WEEKEND IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>{ Saturday:}I go{riding}so I have      
 to be up early.It only takes me ten   
 minutes to dress in my jodphurs and   
 shirt and I quickly eat half a bowl of
 cereal before going to the top of the 
 drive to be picked up by my friend.I  
 usually ride Happy or Snowy who are   
 both greys and my ride lasts for two  
 hours.We take my friend home after    
 riding and I get changed as soon as I 
 get home.I often then{ride my bike    
 around our yard,as I live on a        
 farm,usually with my friend Annabelle.
 We have a quick lunch of sandwiches at
 1.00 and then I watch television or do
 any{homework}until it is dinner time  
 which I hate because we all have to   
 sit round the dinner table and Dad    
 always takes a long time.When we have 
 eaten I watch television until 9.30   
 when I go to bed.
