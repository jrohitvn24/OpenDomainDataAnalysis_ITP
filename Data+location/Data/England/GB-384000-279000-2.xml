		<title>02EMPLOYMENT IN COOKLEY</title>
		<content>      Most of the people who live in   
 the area work locally. Some work on   
 the farms raising cereal crops or     
 sugar beet.A few are employed by the  
 nurseries, though this is largely     
 seasonal.                             
     The iron works, which was the     
 reason for the growth of the village  
 during the industrial revolution,     
 still employs a large number of       
 people.                               
    The Lea Castle Hospital, dealing   
 with the mentally subnormal, also     
 employs many of the villagers as      
 ancillaries, nurses, therapists and   
 doctors.                              
   There are also jobs to be found in  
 the shops and pubs that serve the     
 population.
