		<content>  Much of the livlihood and prosperity 
 of the area depends in some way or    
 other on the dairy industry.The block 
 lies on the northern edge of the      
 fertile North Shropshire plain, most  
 of the land being given over to       
 intensive grazing.                    
  Important offshoots of dairy farming 
 are the industrial firms providing    
 backup, in the form of milking        
 machines, storage tanks and of course 
 cheese production.                    
  In the last few years reductions in  
 the E.E.C. quota for milk production  
 have led to cutbacks throughout the   
 industry and have led to significant  
 job losses in an area which had, until
 then, not been greatly affected by the
 recession. The position has now       
 stabilised somewhat and there are     
 signs of an upturn in the industry.
