		<title>14MOBBERLEY PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>      The parish church of St. Wilfred 
 stands on raised ground in the centre 
 of the parish and dates from 1245.    
 The tower was rebuilt in 1533 and     
 contains a peal of six bells.  The    
 intricately carved rood screen dates  
 from c.1500.  The church is built of  
 stone and slate roof.  The interior   
 ceiling is heavily timbered and       
 patterned.  The oldest gravestone is  
 dated 1570 and burials still take     
 place today: some in family graves.   
 Douglas Gittins keeps the graveyard   
 mowed and tidy.                       
      Services are held each Sunday at 
 8.00am,10.30am and 6.30pm  There is   
 communion on the first and last Sunday
 in each month.                        
      Recent rectors include Canon     
 Randall who served from 1946 to 1980  
 with much distinction.  The present   
 rector is Rev F.D. Moss.              </content>
