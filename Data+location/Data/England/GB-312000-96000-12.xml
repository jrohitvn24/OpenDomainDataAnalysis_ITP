		<title>12ORCHID GROWING P WAKLEY</title>
		<content> Gittisham was the birthplace of John  
 Dominy, who made the first orchid     
 hybrid at Veitches of Exeter. Combe   
 House once had a commercial cut flower
 orchid collection. Mrs Marker is now  
 the Patron of the Devon Orchid        
 society. I, for my sins, am on the    
 committee and joint librarian.        
 Orchids are becoming more and more    
 popular. With modern forms of         
 propagation prices are either being   
 held steady or are coming down.       
 My greenhouse is an eight foot six by 
 ten foot half boarded cedar house.    
 Heat is supplied by a parafin boiler  
 feeding four inch cast iron pipes.    
 Temperatures are kept at a Winter     
 minimum of 50 F with a growing care at
 60 F. My main interest is species;    
 some are collected from the wild but  
 are mostly grown from seed or         
 propagated in nurseries.              </content>
