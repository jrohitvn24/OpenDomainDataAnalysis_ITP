		<content>  THERE ARE A LOT OF R.A.F. CAMPS IN   
 THE AREA OF SLEAFORD.THE NEAREST IS   
 CRANWELL.ONCE MY DAD HAD TO GO TO     
 BELIZE IN SOUTH AMERICA AND WAS AWAY  
 FOR ABOUT 4 MONTHS.                   
  DAD ONCE HAD TO GO TO NORTHERN       
 IRELAND JUST AFTER I WAS BORN.I       
 REALISE NOW THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN   
 KILLED                                
  THE GOOD THING ABOUT DAD BEING IN    
 THE{RAF}IS THAT I OFTEN MOVE SCHOOLS.I
 HAVE ALWAYS FELT AT HOME ON THE FIRST 
 DAY.                                  
  SO TO SUM UP I THINK IN A WAY THE    
 RAF COULD THINK OF THE WAY THE        
 FAMILIES THINK AND FEEL WHEN A PARENT 
 HAS TO GO AWAY FOR 1 WEEK EVERY SIX   
 WEEKS TO TROUBLESOME AREA             
                                       
{  BY TARA ALLAN AGE(13)               
{                                      
                                       </content>
