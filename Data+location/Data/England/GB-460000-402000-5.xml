		<title>05SANDALL BEAT (cont'd)</title>
		<content>{FLORA AND FAUNA:}In Sandall Beat wood 
 there used to be badgers and          
 nightgales.Now there are willow       
 warblers,ring necked plovers,three    
 types of woodpecker,the greater and   
 lesser spotted and the green          
 woodpecker.Kingfishers and            
 whitethroats,foxes,weasels,stoats,    
 hedgehogs, water and small voles and  
 brown rats.                           
{PIT HEAP ECOLOGY:}Gradually that part 
 of the Beat which is used for         
 spoil dumping by the pit is being     
 colonised by various types of low     
 plant life,some of which find         
 competition easier in this situation. 
 Among these plants are the rosebays   
 and the mugwort.One tree,the birch,is 
 also colonising the heap strongly.This
 is so exuberant that it has to be     
 controlled by pit and council         
 operations.                           </content>
