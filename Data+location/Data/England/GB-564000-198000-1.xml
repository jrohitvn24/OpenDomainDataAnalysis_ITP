		<title>01Ingatestone and district.</title>
		<content> The block contains the large village  
 of Ingatestone and the surrounding    
 farmland. Ingatestone has a           
 population of approximately 5000      
 people and lies roughly half way      
 between Brentwood and Chelmsford.     
 Ingatestone's main function is        
 residential - a substantial proportion
 of the working population are employed
 outside the area. Many people work in 
 London and commute daily by train.    
 The gently undulating landscape of    
 the area is typical of much of this   
 part of Essex with the majority of    
 farmland devoted to the growing of    
 crops. Field boundaries are not always
 well defined reflecting the general   
 absence of livestock. There are       
 occasional patches of woodland        
 especially in the north-east of the   
 block.
