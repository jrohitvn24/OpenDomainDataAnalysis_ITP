		<title>02Buckden Village</title>
		<content> Buckden lies five miles south of      
 Huntingdon and sixty miles north of   
 London on the Great North Road. No one
 Knows why the village has grown on    
 this spot but it is possibly due to   
 the crossing point of the Gt. Ouse at 
 Offord.                               
  Since the rapid growth of housing    
 estates in the 1970's along with the  
 building of the bypass the village has
 become a residential area for people  
 working both locally and further      
 afield. The village population having 
 grown to four thousand.               
  The biggest historical landmark is   
 Buckden Towers, once Buckden Palace   
 where Catherine of Aragon was         
 imprisoned in the 1500's.             
  Today Buckden is a lively village    
 with many events taking place for all 
 age groups throughout the year.
