   Mr David Pritchard is the vicar of  
Marcham, Garford and Frilford.         
   The vicar is responsible for quite  
a lot of things.  If the               
vicar is asked to marry, bury or to    
baptize people who live in the village 
he must do so. The vicar is responsible
for 3000 people in Marcham,Garford and 
Frilford.                              
  Christ Church is a college in        
Oxford. It  chooses who should be      
the vicar for Marcham. Christ Church   
also owns Dove Cottage which is next   
to the church.                         
     The church wardens are responsible
for looking after the church with the  
vicar. They also are responsible for   
Garford School which is closed down    
now.
