		<title>04A stranger visits Grindon</title>
		<content>June 20th, 1985.                       
     We went to Grindon and parked near
a church which had a graveyard.  The   
church was quite old.  It had gates in 
front.  It was called All Saints and   
was rebuilt about 100 years ago by     
Samuel Bradshaw at a cost of 4000      
pounds.                                
     We went further down the road and 
we walked past a house and some puppies
started to follow us.  We went past the
Cavalier pub which has got new owners. 
     Next we interviewed the postlady  
and we asked her questions.  After we  
had finished interviewing we went up   
the road and we met the two puppies    
again and we saw an old school which   
was used for playschool and the Parish 
Council's meetings.  The playground had
a swing and a seesaw - and the puppies 
were still following us!
