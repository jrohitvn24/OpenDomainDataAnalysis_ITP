		<title>12KID'S GAMES IN WIS. GREEN</title>
		<content> At school, the boys play football     
 nearly every day.Sometimes we play    
 "stuck-in-the-mud", what you have to  
 do is:                                
       One person is "it" and he chases
 the people who are not "it". If a     
 person is caught, he is "stuck". They 
 stand with their legs apart until     
 another person arrives to crawl       
 through their legs to "free" them.    
       At playtime in the Autumn most  
 of the girls play "French skipping".  
 For French skipping you need a long   
 piece of elastic.We skip to rhymes    
 like "England, Ireland, Scotland,     
 Wales" and "Tinker, tailor, soldier,  
 sailor".                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
