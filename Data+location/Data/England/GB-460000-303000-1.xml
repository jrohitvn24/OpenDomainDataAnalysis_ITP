		<title>01East Leicester _ Gazeteer.</title>
		<content> The block is east of Leicester's city 
 centre and main shopping area but     
 within easy reach of it, being well   
 served by public transport.The D block
 extends from busy terraced streets in 
 the inner city area, through 1930's   
 semis and council development to large
 detatched properties on the outskirts.
 It is a densely populated multi-      
 cultural area; a mix of established   
 communities and recently settled      
 ethnic groups. English mingles with   
 Asian, African and other European     
 languages. Mosques, Gurdwaras and     
 specialised shops are common. The area
 is very self contained,people working 
 within easy distance of their homes   
 and local amenities providing every   
 service required by people in their   
 everyday lives.
