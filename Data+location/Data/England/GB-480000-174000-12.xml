		<title>12The Weekend</title>
		<content>   It's great at the{weekend}because I 
 don't have to go to school!  We get up
 late, but not as late as Mum and Dad  
 so I get a chance to play on our      
{computer}.                            
                                       
   Most Saturdays we play in the garden
 on our{bikes}or on the{climbing       
{frame}. Sometimes we put our{tent}up  
 to play in.  Some Saturdays we have to
 go into{Maidenhead}to do the{shopping}
 - this is really boring but Dad says  
 we have to.                           
                                       
   On Sundays we often go out for the  
 day in the car if the weather is fine 
 and have a picnic.  We have been to   
 the{seaside,}the{Downs}and to the {   
{Windsor Safari Park}.  The only       
 trouble with Sunday is it's Monday the
 next day!                             
                                       </content>
