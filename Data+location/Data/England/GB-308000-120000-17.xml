		<title>17CLUBS</title>
		<content> Clubs are few in this area as the     
 villages are so small. All the        
 children have to travel to Wellington 
 to participate in club activities.    
 These clubs consist of a boys club, a 
 Youth club, a Gymnastics club,        
 Brownies, Cubs, Guides and Scouts     
 clubs. The first two are mainly clubs 
 where children enjoy games and        
 recreational activties. Whereas the   
 other clubs provide opportunities for 
 learning different skills, going away 
 to camp and enjoying canoeing, rock   
 climbing, and following different     
 nature trails. The adults have only   
 one club in the area which is called  
 the Langford Ladies. The ladies meet  
 at Langford School once a month.      
 Guests are invited to give            
 demonstrations of flower arranging and
 cooking as well as talks on local     
 history and many other subjets.       </content>
