		<content>{Burley Woodhead school}opened in 1860.
 Although it was put on the closure    
 list in 1944 it didn't close until    
 1976. The school closed because it was
 too small and the old heating system  
 made it too costly to run. In the     
 winter the school was very cold       
 because the only heating the school   
 had was three radiators and a boiler. 
 The school room was one big room which
 was used for assemblies and dinner    
 times. When the lessons started a     
 screen was pulled across to divide the
 room into two parts;two thirds for the
 older children and one third for the  
 younger children. There were also five
 toilets,three for the girls and two   
 for the boys. These buildings were out
 in the courtyard.
