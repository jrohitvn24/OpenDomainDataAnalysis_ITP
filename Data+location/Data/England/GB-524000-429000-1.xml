		<title>01THE VILLAGE OF BURTON PIDSEA</title>
		<content>     Burton Pidsea is a small village  
 approximately 10 miles to the north-  
 east of the city of Kingston upon     
 Hull, and about the same distance from
 the coast. It has a population of     
 close to 1000 people which has grown  
 rapidly over the past 10 years.       
     The village is surrounded by      
 arable farmland, the greater part     
 of which is sown with rape.           
     The village has a fine church     
 which dates back to 1180 and it is set
 in a pretty, quiet village which has  
 retained its friendly atmosphere      
 despite its rapid growth.             
     Many of its new inhabitants are   
 young professionals who commute to    
 Hull for their business, yet the      
 village remains essentially a family  
 village with many generations living  
 close together.
