		<title>12PARISH HALL, BERRINGTON</title>
		<content>{The Parish Hall}in Berrington, was    
 built in 1926 with funds raised by    
 local people. It is timber framed with
 corrugated iron cladding painted green
 with a black roof.{The land}on which  
 the Hall stands is leased from the    
 Church for an annual rental of Â£1. It 
 is run by{Berrington Room Management  
{Committee}who are elected members of  
 the public and representatives of the 
 organisations who use the Hall. It is 
 used as the dining room for the school
 (Â£300pa) and is available for hire by 
 groups or individuals. Charges vary - 
 Meetings Â£3, Clubs and Social Events  
 such as Bingo and Whist Drives Â£5,    
 Dances and Parties with Bar Â£20. This 
{income}is barely sufficient to finance
 the Hall. There is concern over its   
 future with intimations for a         
{Community Centre}in Cross Houses.
