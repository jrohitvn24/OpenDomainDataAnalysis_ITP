		<title>01LIVING IN LUDWORTH</title>
		<content>      Ludworth is a popular place, with
 those who live there.Most people like 
 it because it is a small friendly     
 village surrounded by countryside.    
      The general dealer, newsagent and
 post office supply most needs but not 
 all.                                  
      Most people like Ludworth but    
 some complain about things such as    
 stray dogs and vandelism. The bus     
 service is not as good as it used to  
 be especially at night, but some      
 people don't use it.Older people don't
 go out of the village a lot but many  
 younger people do.                    
      Most people went to Ludworth     
 school. Anyone over fifty to the old  
 Ludworth School, as the present school
 was not built until the 1930's        
      Of a population of about 2000,   
 more than half are over 35 years old.
