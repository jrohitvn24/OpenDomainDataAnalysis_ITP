		<title>19IMPROVING EAST MERSEA</title>
		<content>   There is only one bus from East     
 Mersea to Colchester in the morning   
 and two services from Colchester in   
 the late afternoon. In a survey of 55 
 householders 45% said a more frequent 
 bus-service would improve their       
 quality of life. Although the census  
 revealed that 86% of households had   
 access to a car, 48% had only one car.
 The problem is more acute for the     
 elderly,some 19 households in the     
 census, contained pensioners but had  
 no car. The deteriorating transport   
 provision in this rural area is       
 producing a significant minority of   
 isolated and lonely elderly people.   
   Other improvements mentioned were   
 more shops, better drainage, nearer   
 health facilities and street lights.  
 However a significant 18% of the      
 survey stated that they were entirely 
 satisfied and wanted no developments. </content>
