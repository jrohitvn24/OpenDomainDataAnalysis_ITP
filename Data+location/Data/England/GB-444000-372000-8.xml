		<title>08Saturday At School.</title>
		<content>   Every Saturday morning at 8.30am I  
 get up and prepare for school.  Normal
 school children don't go to school on 
 Saturdays, but I do. {I go to my own  
{school on Saturdays to learn Italian  
 because my mum and dad are Italian.  I
 stay their for 45 minutes to learn,   
 draw and speak.  Most of the pupils   
 have Italian parents but 3 or 4 have  
 English ones.                         
   We read for 10 minutes then write   
 for another 10 minutes.  After that we
 go out to play while the teacher has a
 rest.  When we come back in we answer 
 questions out of our book and draw.   
 After that we have a game of bingo or 
 a spelling game in Italian.           
 Altogether there are 6 children at the
 school.  Saturdays are not the best   
 day of the week for me!
