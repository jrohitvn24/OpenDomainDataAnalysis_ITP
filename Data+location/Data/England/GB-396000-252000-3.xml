		<title>03EDUCATION IN AREA</title>
		<content> State education in the area is based  
 upon a 3 tier system.  Children from 5
 to 9 years attend Flyford Flavell     
 School - mainly being transported by  
 bus from local villages.  Bishampton  
 sends the majority of children        
 (about 4O) whilst smaller numbers from
 Throckmorton, Abberton, North Piddle, 
 Grafton Flyford, Kington and Dormston 
 also attend.  At present about 7O     
 children attend Flyford School but    
 numbers have slowly fallen in recent  
 years owing to trends in population   
 and a fall in the national birth rate.
 At 9, children start at St.Nicholas   
 Middle School, Pinvin which they      
 attend for 3 years until 12. Again    
 they are transported by bus.  After 12
 children go to Pershore High School   
 until they leave  at some time after  
 they reach the age of 16. The 3 tier  
 system was introduced about 9 years   </content>
