		<content>{DUSTMEN}Refuse collectors come on a   
 Tuesday morning in a large dustcart.  
 One man puts sacks or bins of rubbish 
 by the side of the road.The other men 
 throw the refuse into the back of the 
 lorry where it is compressed.When they
 have cleared all the streets they go  
 to the refuse tip at Princess Drive,  
 Leamington and tip it out.Later       
 it is taken to Smith's Landfill Site  
  Bubbenhall.Some houses have a{POOLS  
{COLLECTOR}calling. He collects        
 completed football coupons (i.e.      
 betting on the results of football    
 matches)and the money.This saves      
 postage and cheque charges.If         
 you get 8 draws correct you could win 
 up to Â£lm.An{INSURANCE MAN}calls at   
 some houses to collect insurance      
 premiums on life policies.This is     
 becoming less common as many more     
 people have cheque accounts at banks. </content>
