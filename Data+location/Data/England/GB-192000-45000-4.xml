		<content>   The village of Tregony is cut into  
 two parts by the D-block boundary,    
 leaving the northern third in this    
 block.                                
   Tregony is situated 8 miles east of 
 Truro, the county town of Cornwall. It
 has a population of about 700 people  
 including a high proportion of old age
 pensioners.                           
   The parish church is situated about 
 half a mile away at Cornelly, so St.  
 Cuby's church, which is at the        
 northern edge of the village, is in   
 fact used as the parish church; there 
 is also a Methodist chapel on the main
 street. The affairs of the parish are 
 run by a ten-member parish council.   
   There are two schools: Tregony      
 Primary was built in 1835 but burnt   
 down and was later rebuilt; and The   
 Roseland School, a modern             
 comprehensive school (see pp.12 &amp; 13).</content>
