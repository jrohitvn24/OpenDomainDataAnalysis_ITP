		<title>12POLITICS, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> Rugeley is a small industrial and     
 market town in rural Staffordshire.   
 The political representation is mixed.
 Someone living in Rugeley may be      
 represented by all 3 major political  
 parties. In 1985, the Member of       
 Parliament is Conservative; the       
 constituency includes Lichfield and   
 Tamworth and the surrounding areas.   
 Members of all 3 parties represent    
 Rugeley on Staffordshire County       
 Council. When Rugeley was a separate  
 Urban District Council, it was mainly 
 Labour but now Liberals hold the      
 majority of seats in the town. Cannock
 Chase District Council consists of    
 Rugeley and Cannock together, the     
 majority party is Labour. The district
 council meets in Cannock and there is 
 a feeling that Rugeley is deprived    
 compared with Cannock which seems to  
 have more new amenities.              </content>
