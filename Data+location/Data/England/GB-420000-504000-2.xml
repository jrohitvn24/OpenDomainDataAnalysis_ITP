		<title>02Middleton Tyas Church</title>
		<content> The name of the church is{St. Michael 
{and All Angels.}                      
 The oldest gravestone is a lovely     
 grave cover like a canopy, beautifully
 carved in stone. It is about 13th     
 Century so it is some 700 years old   
 and belonged to a very rich man but we
 do not know who he was.               
 There have probably been two churches 
 on the same site and there is an idea 
 that there might have been a Saxon    
 church and certainly a Norman church  
 because there is now a beautiful row  
 of Norman arches. There was a Norman  
 church built round about the 13th     
 Century, then a little bit later, in  
 the 14th Century, it was extended.    
 In Victorian times it was heavily     
{restored by}a man called{Sir Gilbert  
{Scott.}
