		<title>18FOOD AND DIET</title>
		<content> For breakfast I had three sausages in 
 bread with tomato sauce and a cup of  
 tea. For dinner I had a salad         
 containing lettuce, tomato, luncheon  
 meat, cheese, cress and salad cream,  
 then an oatmeal biscuit and a cup of  
 Ribena. For tea I had cheese on toast,
 strawberries (tinned), cheese         
 biscuits, ice-pop and a glass of      
 lemonade. My diet is usually full of  
 natural foods except for sausages, my 
 drinks are also natural except for    
 fizzy drinks. I am not a vegetarian   
 but I will only eat certain meats     
 because I don't like the idea of      
 animals being fattened up to be killed
 for us to eat. So I hope that one day 
 people will realise that it is bad to 
 kill animals just to eat them and then
 they will stop it.
