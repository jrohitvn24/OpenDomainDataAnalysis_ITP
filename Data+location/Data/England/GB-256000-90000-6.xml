		<title>06THE LOOP ROAD</title>
		<content> The military 'loop road' on Dartmoor  
 above Okehampton is to be allowed to  
 decay to the point where it would be  
 unusable by private cars. The road is 
 owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, and   
 provides access to the army ranges    
 south of Okehampton Camp. The road    
 is open to the public when the ranges 
 are not in use. In 1983 the Duchy     
 announed that the road would be left  
 to decay by 'benign neglect' and so   
 let the northern moor return to its   
 former isolation.                     
 There has been opposition to the idea,
 as the road provides a unique way onto
 the moor for the disabled, and those  
 who prefer not to walk. The Town      
 Commoners' Association passed a       
 resolution expressing sorrow that the 
 Prince of Wales had not taken notice  
 of the local wish to maintain one of  
 the most scenic drives in the country.</content>
