		<content> The block consists of Wyddial village 
 and most of Wyddial parish plus a     
 western section of Anstey parish and a
 southern section of Barkway parish.   
  It is a rural area. Three-quarters of
 it is open fields which are cultivated
 for cereal crops and oil-seed rape. It
 has gentle, undulating landscape      
 dotted with trees and small woods. The
 river Quin drains the eastern side to 
 the south.                            
  Wyddial village is small, having only
 thirty-three houses. These included   
 Home Farm and Wyddial Bury Farm which 
 are still working farms. The map also 
 shows six outlying farms. Only Biggin 
 Manor remains as a working farm, the  
 land attached to the others having    
 been absorbed into larger units. There
 are seventeen other houses scattered  
 over the area in small groups.        
  Most people work outside the area.   </content>
