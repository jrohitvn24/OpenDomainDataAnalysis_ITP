		<content>      Many of the{farmhouses}are large 
 brickbuilt dwellings dating from late 
 18th/ early 19th century.  Others are 
 black and white timber-framed houses  
 dating from the 17th century and      
 characteristic of Cheshire.           
      The{villages}also have smaller   
 dwellings, again some in brick and    
 some in black and white timber.       
      More{recent development}has      
 taken place on the outskirts of       
 villages, including council estates at
 Lostock Gralam and Wincham built in   
 the 1950's, and private developments  
 in the past 10 years.                 
      Near Pickmere Lake there are     
 several wooden chalet-type houses,    
 formerly{holiday homes,}some of which 
 are now permanently occupied.
