		<content> With the building of the M.62 motorway
 which is able to connect Brighouse    
 with both the east and west coast and 
 the other major motorways of Britain, 
 many factories have been built on the 
 large industrial estate in the valley 
 bottom along the banks of the River   
 Calder.Many of the old textile mills  
 near the town centre have been closed 
 in recent years and many jobs can now 
 be found in the new factories.        
 The largest space in the industrial   
 estate is taken up by British Car     
 Auctions,one of the largest auction   
 centres in the north of England. Other
 industries on the estate include the  
 packaging of food, the making of hi-fi
 equipment, engineering and textiles.  
 There is also a marina for pleasure   
 craft which use the canal.Many roads  
 lead onto the estate from the town    
 centre via the Dewsbury/Brighouse road</content>
