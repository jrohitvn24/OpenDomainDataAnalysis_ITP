		<title>05Census studies in Wytham</title>
		<content>   According to the figures for the    
 1981 census Wytham had a population of
 152 people. Since 1943 when the       
 village became a University property, 
 the population has declined.          
   In 1881, the census recorded 271    
 inhabitants.  In the last 100 years   
 there has been a decrease of 40%.  In 
 1881 there were 91 males, 107 females 
 and 73 children.  In 1981 there were  
 78 males, 73 females and 19 children. 
 The noticeable change is in the       
 number of children in the village.    
   In 1881, 37% of the population was  
 employed in various ways.  In 1981    
 39% were at work.  More than 20% of   
 the population was of pensionable     
 age.                                  
   The present village of Wytham has a 
 relatively old population with very   
 few youngsters under the age of 16.
