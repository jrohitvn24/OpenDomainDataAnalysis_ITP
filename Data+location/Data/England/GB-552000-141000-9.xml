		<content>  In Penshurst there are cats, dogs,   
 rabbits, gerbils, foxes, fish, birds  
 including owls geese swans and        
 herons, farm animals, wasps and bees, 
 frogs, toads, newts and grass snakes  
 to mention just a few.                
  The game keeper said that he looks   
 after labradors, they cost Â£3 a week  
 to feed. He also looks after 2,000    
 pheasants each year. The pheasants are
 reared for Lord De L'Isle's shoots.   
 Some survive and are seen all over our
 area. The game keeper sees deer,      
 woodpeckers, cuckoos and nightingales.
 He also sees about 6 poachers who     
 seem to be very active from October   
 to February.
