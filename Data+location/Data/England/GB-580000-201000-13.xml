		<content>   There is a church in Cock Clarks and
 the village of Purleigh is served by a
 church lying just outside our block.  
 There is also a chapel and some       
 residents expressed regret at the     
 closure of another chapel.            
   In our survey we found that a third 
 of all the people we spoke to attended
 church at least occasionally. As      
 various activities seem to be tied to 
 the church, this may account for the  
 rather high proportion of people who  
 actually go to church.                
   We found a tiny, seemingly isolated 
 cemetery which was once attached to   
 the now demolished chapel. Although   
 most of the graves were old, the      
 eldest dated 1793, there was a recent 
 grave of 1980.
