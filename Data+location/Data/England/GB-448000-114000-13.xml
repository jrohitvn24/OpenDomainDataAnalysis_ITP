		<title>13CHALCROFT FARM</title>
		<content> Chalcroft Farm is over 400 years old  
 and covers 250 acres of land.It has 20
 fields and buildings.One field is     
 where Oliver Cromwell used to hang    
 people.Another used to have a church  
 in it.The buildings include an old    
 house and barn, made out of ships     
 timbers.There are 2 wells and a pond  
 which were used until 1954.Electricity
 was introduced in 1952.               
 Two types of cattle are kept.When the 
 beef cattle are 18 months old they are
 sent to market.The milk from the dairy
 cattle is the main income.Soft fruit  
 growing and the pork industry were    
 given up as they didn't make any      
 profit. Two of the brothers are in the
 milking business and the other does   
 meat.The farm has belonged to the     
 family since 1605.Only one job is done
 all year round,that is milking.Busiest
 months are May/August.                </content>
