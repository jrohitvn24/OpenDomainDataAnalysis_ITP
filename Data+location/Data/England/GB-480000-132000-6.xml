		<title>06The hamlet of Conford</title>
		<content> Conford lies hidden just off the B3004
 on a slight slope. Perhaps sought     
 after for its quiet situation, three  
 houses were having internal           
 alterations. An older inhabitant      
 remarked how the real villagers were  
 fast disappearing. The school 1873    
 provided by gentry, was given to the  
 village in 1970's. By local           
 determination and work it is the      
 Village Hall,also catering for holiday
 camps from London and of conservation 
 workers.The Old Forge, scene of a     
 prosperous edge tool business till    
 1915, alterations mellowed, has newish
 stables on its boundary. Near the Park
 gates with view of small lake, also   
 ford and footbridge, Conford House    
 c1600 stands simply, stone walls,     
 origigal roof,and wood framing visible
 one end, appreciated by its owner and 
 lovers of our heritage.               </content>
