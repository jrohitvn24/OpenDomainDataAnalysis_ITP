		<title>031POLO.2SAD &amp; SOLEMN OCCAS1ON</title>
		<content>1It is a game for as many children as  
you want.You have to choose one person 
to go to one end of the playground and 
the rest at the other end.The person at
the top turns his back to the group and
chooses a subject eg animals.Those at  
the other end each choose an animal.   
These names are called out.When they   
have finished,the one at the top turns 
around,and calls out one of them.The   
person who has that name,runs to the   
top and back and says POLO while the   
first person runs in the opposite      
direction.If you beat the person at    
the top,you take her place and restart.
2Players kneel in a circle.They bow    
down saying"SAD AND SOLEMN OCCASION."  
One child says something about someone 
else ,e.g:It is such a sad and solemn  
occasion that Sister Kate loves Lee.Sad
and solemn occasion.Anyone that laughs 
is out.                                </content>
