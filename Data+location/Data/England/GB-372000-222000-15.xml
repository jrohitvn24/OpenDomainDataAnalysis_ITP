 The farm has 4 full-time workers and 1
 student. They all live locally in the 
 Newent area and either walk to work or
 travel by car or motorbike. Some of   
 his workers have been fairly recently 
 appointed to work on the farm, only 2 
 months ago, whereas his longest       
 serving employee has worked on the    
 farm for 14 years. Some of his men are
 craftsmen and some do un-skilled jobs.
 The work they have to do involves     
 working a wide range of agricultural  
 machinery such as tractors, potato    
 harvesters, sugar-beet harvesters,    
 drills, planters, harrows and         
 spreaders. They also have to do       
 routine maintenance on the machines,  
 but get an agricultural engineer in   
 for the more complicated repairs. The 
 workers generally work a 40 hour week,
 but if busy will do overtime.         </content>
