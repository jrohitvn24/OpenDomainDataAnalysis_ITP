		<title>10HEDGEROWS AROUND CLOPTON</title>
		<content> The village of Clopton is surrounded  
 by farmland and rough grazing land.   
 The hedgerows lining the sides of the 
 roads are basically untended and there
 is evidence of a number of dead elm   
 trees. Where footpaths cross the road 
 they have mainly fallen into disuse   
 and many are not signposted and have  
 become overgrown. There are quite a   
 few oak tres growing in the hedgerows 
 that surround the fields along with   
 brambles, hazel, nettles, hogweed,    
 marshmallows, white campion, hemlock, 
 yarrow and shepherds purse. As the    
 farmers require larger fields these   
 hedgerows are being gradually dug up.
