		<title>17Dartmouth Pottery,Warfleet.</title>
		<content> The Pottery was a brewery &amp; factory   
 until 1946,it has 5 floors,with 20    
 workers and 4 potters.The clay is from
 Bovey Tracey,then it goes to Stoke-on-
 Trent to be treated.3 people fill the 
 moulds,which are made in Slapton,with 
 liquid clay and wait for them to      
 set.Then they pour out the slip,&amp; dry,
 fire and glaze the pottery shapes.They
 make about 8000 pieces and pack them  
 in 50-80 crates a day to send them    
 all over the world.We talked to 2 of  
 the workers,they paint and varnish the
 clay shapes sometimes,as well as      
 tidying up the factory and shop,also  
 they do fettling,which is when they   
 scrape the rough edges off the        
 shapes.When they started working there
 they were told to take their time and 
 do the job properly.It can be a very  
 stuffy and dusty job.They make vases,{
 ornaments,pots and gurgling fish jugs.</content>
