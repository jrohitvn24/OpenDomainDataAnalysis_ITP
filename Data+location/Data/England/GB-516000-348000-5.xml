		<content> Until September, 1984, pupils attended
 primary school in South Kyme. Now they
 travel to Billinghay, beginning the   
 term after their fifth birthday.      
  Selection still operates, so pupils  
 take a 2 part examination. Those      
 passing attend single sex schools in  
 Sleaford; others go to mixed secondary
 schools:-usually Billinghay Lafford,  
 but sometimes St. Georges, Sleaford,  
 depending upon parental choice,       
 transport and availability of place.  
  Compulsory schooling is now until 16.
 In the past, many left by 14 and knew 
 only the local school. Learning       
 opportunities and subjects studied    
 were far more limited then. For       
 further education, pupils transfer to 
 Sleaford, or colleges in Lincoln,     
 Grantham or Boston, or universities   
 outside Lincs. Under 5's can use      
 Billinghay playgroup-75p per morning. </content>
