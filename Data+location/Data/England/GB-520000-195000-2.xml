		<title>02Industry in Boreham Wood</title>
		<content> Some large national and international 
 companies are situated in Elstree Way.
 Hunting Surveys, Goodyear, Fyffes and 
 Christian Salveson are on the north   
 side. Opposite are GEC, Sellotapes,   
 Stanelco and Bonar Instruments.  There
 is an industrial estate behind Elstree
 Way. Some of the companies have moved 
 from sites which were closer to the   
 centre of London. They told us that   
 there were easier road communications 
 from Boreham Wood. Elstree Way        
 intersects with the A1(T) north and   
 southbound. These companies provide a 
 wide range of services and products   
 from cold storage at Christian        
 Salveson to Laings, an international  
 building company with interests as    
 far afield as New Zealand. Laings have
 a mainframe computer base here.
