		<title>18EDUCATION IN HONING AREA</title>
		<content> For educational administrative        
 purposes Norfolk is divided into 5    
 areas,and the boundary between two of 
 these,the north and east,runs through 
 this block. In response to falling    
 rolls generally, schools are being    
 amalgamated. Honing school closes in  
 1985 and the 12 remaining pupils will 
 transfer to local schools. Their      
 dispersal is complicated in that the  
 northern area maintains primary       
 schools for the 5-11 age range,the    
 east first and middle schools for 5-8 
 and 8-12yrs. Honing parish is being   
 ceded to the east,and from Sept.85    
 children aged to 8 will be educated at
 E.Ruston first school,then at Stalham 
 Middle and High schools. The remaining
 8 pupils could opt for their schooling
 to continue in the northern area-3 to 
 Nth.Walsham New High school,and 3 to  
 Manor Rd. Junior School, Nth. Walsham.</content>
