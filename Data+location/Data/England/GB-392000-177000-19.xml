		<content> Sutton Benger pupils interviewed Miss 
 Gladys Heath, age 89, the oldest      
 inhabitant to have been born in the   
 village.                              
 After leaving school she went into    
 service as a laundry maid, earning Â£23
 per year working for Lord Cowley on   
 the Draycot Estate.                   
 She remembers the piped water supply  
 and electricity coming to the village,
 but still prefers the old ways. "The  
 well in the front garden did not      
 freeze in winter the way that pipes   
 do."                                  
 Memories of World War II reveal that, 
 apart from having some evacuees in the
 village, it had little effect on daily
 life. Food rationing had a limited    
 impact as locals could obtain         
 pheasants from Draycot Park, as well  
 as growing their own vegetables.
