		<title>03St Ives coastguard interview</title>
		<content> The coast road runs to the North      
 Cliffs here.  The cliffs are high and 
 shaley - unsafe for amateurs -        
 although the professional climbers who
 restrict their climbs to the granite -
 rarely provide work for the           
 coastguard.                           
 Elderly people use the parking places 
 along the cliffs as a base for picnics
 and gentle walks.  There are three    
 small beaches which may be approached 
 by steep footpaths but are now only   
 visited by a few informed local       
 people.                               
 Seals breed along these cliffs and    
 fishermen from St Ives approaching by 
 sea, lay nets here and leave lobster  
 and crab pots.                        
 Hells mouth is a local suicide area.  
 At one place along this stretch people
 keep dumping rubbish and old cars.
