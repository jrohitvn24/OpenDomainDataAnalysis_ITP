		<title>07EAST MEON - CHURCH</title>
		<content> All Saints Church in East Meon is at  
 the foot of Park Hill,at the junction 
 of the 2 roads through the village.   
 Built of local flint &amp; with stone     
 dressed corners,the church was at one 
 time an important one,possibly being a
 Mother Church to others in the area.  
 The present building of All Saints    
 Church dates back to 1069,although    
 there is some evidence that there was 
 a wooden church building on the same  
 site in Saxon times.Its hilly site    
 raised above the level of the rest of 
 the village suggests the continuance  
 of a pagan site.Features to note      
 include the stained glass windows,the 
 organ,two fonts and several memorial  
 tablets.The building has been added   
 to over the centuries,including a new 
 lead roof in 1985.Sheep often graze in
 the churchyard,which is famous for its
 springtime display of daffodils.      </content>
