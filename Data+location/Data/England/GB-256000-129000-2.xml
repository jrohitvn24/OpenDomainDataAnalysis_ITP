		<title>02JASON SARGEANT'S DAY</title>
		<content> In the school holidays I go to work   
 with my dad. I get up at 4 a.m.,then I
 have my breakfast, usually cornflakes.
 Then about five we go to the depot at 
 Mother's Pride. We load up the bread  
 and cakes, from there we go to        
 Raymonds and get some more. Then we   
 start the round. First we deliver to a
 shop then to a cafe, they are both in 
 Barnstaple, then we go out to the     
 country and some more shops as        
 well as peoples' houses, we go out as 
 far as Exmoor and Bratton Fleming as  
 well as a few villages. This all takes
 about seven to eight hours.  When we  
 have finished the round we go to my   
 nan's and pick up my mum from         
 work. Then sometimes we go and play   
 Snooker, all our family like playing  
 this so we can all go together.       
 Finally we go home and go to bed ready
 for the next day.                     </content>
