 it was a special day for me as it was 
 my{birthday.}It was also special      
 because we had a{holiday}from school  
 as it was{Ascension Thursday,}a Holy  
 Day of Obligation.I got up at 7       
 o'clock and had some cornflakes for my
 breakfast.Then I got washed, brushed  
 my teeth and got dressed.I put on my  
 best black dress, my new short white  
 socks and my best black shoes.Then my 
 mum took me to St.Mary's Church for   
{Mass.}After Mass my mum took me to my 
 Nanna's while she got things ready for
 the{party.}She made sandwiches with   
 potted meat,egg and cheese.We also had
 crisps,biscuits,red jelly,pickled     
 onions,sausages on sticks,cheese on   
 sticks and cola and cream soda to     
 drink.My birthday cake was shaped like
 a number 8.After getting many presents
 and playing many games I went to bed. </content>
