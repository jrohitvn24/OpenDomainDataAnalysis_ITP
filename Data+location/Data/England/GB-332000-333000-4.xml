		<content>     Two thirds of his trade is made by
 local people. They get between{1,500  
{and 2,000}people per week.Just        
 recently they closed a craft centre   
 and a grocers shop because they had   
 too much work to do.{When they have a 
{party they go around cutting off the  
{bottoms of people's ties and pinning  
{them on a bar.}                       
    Their chef lives in a mobile home  
 on the premises. The most popular food
 is{steak}which costs between{Â£5 and   
{Â£9.                                   
    The{canal}no longer helps the trade
 because{11 miles}further up the canal 
 the banks have{collapsed}so the canal 
 users can't get very far.The Water    
 Board are hoping that it will be open 
 next year.
