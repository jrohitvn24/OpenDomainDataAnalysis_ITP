		<title>02NEWSPAPER STORIES (5.7.85)</title>
		<content> We looked at the front page of two    
 local newspapers to find out what the 
 main stories for the{fifth of         
{July,1985,}were.                      
 Looking at both papers, neither paper 
 had chosen to report the same story on
 the front page.                       
 One newspaper had a lengthy report    
 about{parking}fees in{Waltham Cross.  
 It had been hoped that parking fees   
 for the local multy-storey car park   
 would be abandoned, in order to       
 encourage more people to shop in the  
 area. But at a recent council meeting 
 it had been out-voted (15 votes to    
 13).                                  
 The other paper carried six shorter   
 stories. The main one was about the   
{West Essex Health Authorities}plan to 
 close{Honey Lane Hospital.}This is a  
 hospital which at present serves the  
 people of Waltham Abbey.              </content>
