		<content> The area is  North of Birmingham and  
 incorporates the northern boundary of 
 Sutton Park, an open amenity area of  
 about 2400 acres.The Park is one of   
 the best natural wild life regions in 
 the Midlands. Most of the area is     
 administered by the City of Birmingham
 District Council. Urban development is
 extensive around the Park. Much house 
 building has taken place since 1945   
 with private development being the    
 most obvious.The type of housing      
 ranges from expensive, exclusive large
 dwellings in the South East and North 
 West with upper and middle range      
 property apparent everywhere. Detached
 houses predominate. Social activities 
 are plentiful in this essentially     
 dormitory area.The people are socially
 conscious and are ambitious for       
 themselves and families.Most people   
 think it a pleasant place to live in. </content>
