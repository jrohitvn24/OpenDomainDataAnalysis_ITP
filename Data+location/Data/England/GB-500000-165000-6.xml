		<title>06SIR WILLIAM PERKINS SCHOOL</title>
		<content>      Sir William Perkins founded a    
 school in l725 for 25 boys, in Windsor
 St., Chertsey.  They were taught      
 reading, writing, arithmetic and all  
 about the Church of England.  Later he
 raised enough money to also educate 25
 girls.                                
      The school moved to its present  
 site in Guildford Road in l882.  Early
 this century it became a fee paying   
 Grammar school for girls but later was
 maintained by Surrey Education        
 Authority.  In l978 the school again  
 became independent and now educates   
 about 440 day girls aged between ll   
 and l9.                               
      The school takes part in many    
 sporting events, it stages drama      
 productions and musicals and has its  
 own orchestra.  The school is still   
 increasing in size with a recently    
 completed sixth form centre.          </content>
