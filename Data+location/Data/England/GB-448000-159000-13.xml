		<content>   Social life in the village centres  
 on the{Royal Oak}public house and the 
{Village Hall.}The eighteenth century  
 Royal Oak is popular with local       
 residents,holidaymakers and foreign   
 visitors such as the New Zealand sheep
 shearers on working holidays.         
   Occasionally there is some musical  
 entertainment from a pianist and a    
 double bass player who uses a broom   
 stick lashed to a tea chest as an     
 instrument.A number of{British Legion 
 meetings are held there.              
   The village hall is used for        
 meetings by various organizations and 
 private parties.                      
   Life for teenagers can be difficult,
 they have to go outside the village   
 for entertainment.Young people working
 in Newbury need their own transport,  
 since the first bus arrives there     
 after 9am,too late for most jobs.     </content>
