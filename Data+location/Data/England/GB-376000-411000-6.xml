		<title>06LOCAL HISTORY: The Bomb</title>
		<content>   If you have ever passed Whitehead   
 Gardens on Chapel Street near the     
 Printer's Inn you would be passing a  
 piece of history which literally shook
 Tottington.Whitehead Gardens looked   
 today a little like they did in the   
 early 1950's shortly after they had   
 been opened.                          
   Did you know that where this garden 
 is today there used to be houses? This
 is what hapened to the houses.On      
 Christmas Eve 1944 during the second  
 world war a flying bomb dropped on    
 Chapel Street.Across the road St.     
 Ann's Church the doors and windows had
 been blown out and the trees were     
 festooned with clothes.After the war  
 Mr. and Mrs. S.D Whitehead of Stormer 
 Hill bought the land where the bomb   
 had dropped and spent Â£5000 making the
 gardens out of the ruins.
