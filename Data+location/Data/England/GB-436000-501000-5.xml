		<content> When a wedding takes place the village
 children tie up the church gates to   
 prevent the bridal couple from leaving
 until they have thrown money over the 
 gates for them.                       
 A rhyme known in the area is:Tid,Mid, 
 Mitheray,Carlin,Palm &amp; Paste Egg      
 Day.The origin of Carlin Sunday comes 
 from a time of food shortage in the   
 area.A ship arrived on the R.Tyne two 
 sundays before Easter with a cargo of 
 dried carlin peas, thus saving the    
 population from starvation. They are  
 eaten only on this particular day with
 sunday dinner.Many children dress up  
 as ghosts on Halloween,and go around  
 houses in groups saying "Trick or     
 Treat".The opening meet of the        
 Hurworth Hunt takes place at the Duke 
 of Wellington on the 1st saturday in  
 November, and the huntsmen partake of 
 a glass of sherry before the hunt.    </content>
