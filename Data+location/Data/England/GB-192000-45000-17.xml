		<content> ST Creed parish church is one of the  
 six churches under the control of the 
 team rector.The churches are Grampound
 ,Grampound Road, Laddock, St Erme and 
 Probus.St Creed church is sited at a  
 small road juction(935472) but may be 
 easily missed.                        
   The church dates from Norman times  
 but it is mostly 14th and 15th century
 origin.                               
   There are two  aisles with a 13th   
 century font at the West end.The      
 church is in a fairly isolated        
 area,and is about three km from       
 Tregony.                              
   Tregony parish itself has no church 
 because St James's church,Tregony's   
 previous church was washed down by    
 a very heavy storm in the middle ages.
 Consequently,Tregony has become very  
 involved with St Cuby's parish church 
 even it is not a part of Tregony.     </content>
