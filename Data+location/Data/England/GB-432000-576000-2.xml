		<title>02Hartley Pans (continued)</title>
		<content> were placed at Flodden to stop salt   
 from going over the border into       
 Scotland. This did the salt trade a   
 lot of harm and was the beginning for 
 a black market in salt. Salt continued
 to be produced for a few more years   
 but this was all used in the Glass    
 Houses. The pans were finally closed  
 down in 1820 and no traces of them    
 remain. They were situated on the     
 right bank of the river, East of the  
 main road bridge and the salt drying  
 houses were on Rocky Island which was 
 known then as the{"Pans Close."       
           W. Coulson.                 
 Undoubtedly the most famous pit sinker
 of hos day, William Coulson had, at   
 the time of the disaster been 48 years
 in the work and had sunk 84 pits      
 including that of Hartley. His skilled
 work gained him praise and abuse.
