 family has owned{Manor Farm}since     
{1899.}Mr,Woodcock is a tena nt and    
 pays  Â£100 per week .Mr, Woodcock has 
 two different types of cows they are  
{Hereford}cows and{Friesian}Bulls.He   
 buys them when they are 3/4 months    
 old.He raises them for about 1 and a  
 half years  and then takes them to    
 be slaughtered.He buys them at        
{Penistone}auction,and uses them for   
{beef.}Mr.Woodcock has got 2 guard dogs
