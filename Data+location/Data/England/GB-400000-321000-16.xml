The people of Haywood are able to enjoy
many forms of recreation. Jogging is   
very popular, and fishermen are always 
seen sitting along the side of the     
Trent and Mersey Canal. The sport of   
'microliting' is becoming increasingly 
popular, the pilots taking off from Far
Coley Farm or nearby Shugborough Park. 
Hot Air Balloons are a common sight    
over the area. The youth of Colwich    
have their own Youth centre close to   
the church, and there are the usual    
Brownie, Cub Scout and Guide Packs in  
the villages. For adults there are     
several associations, including the    
W.I., Housewives Register, Haywood     
Society and Village Produce Guild.     
There are village senior and junior    
football teams, and other teams linked 
to the local pubs. There are two Public
Houses in Little Haywood.              </content>
