    We have four playtimes at school.  
The first is before school when we dont
play much but talk with our friends.   
    At morning break we have a quarter 
of an hour when we play games like     
boys after girls ,it, or chainy.       
    The third playtime is after lunch  
We play lots of games such as chainy   
orange balls,freeze,stuck in the mud   
British Bulldog,sun and shadow and     
grandmother's footsteps. During        
afternoon play we often dont play much.
    Chainy is my schools favourite     
game.You need at least 10 children and 
one person is it.He has to catch the   
other people.When he has touched some  
one they join hands and try to catch   
the others.When four are joined        
together they can make two pairs and so
on until one person is left.He is the  
winner.                                </content>
