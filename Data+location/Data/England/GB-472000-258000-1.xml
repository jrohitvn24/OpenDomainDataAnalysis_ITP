		<content>The changing scene in Northampton is as
prominent in the area covered by this  
survey as any other.The Development Cor
poration is now disbanded but the chang
es continue.The area is divided in two 
by the River Nene which has always had 
an important influence on the town.Even
today the residents of St.James End and
Cotton End(both in this area)hardly    
ever meet or want to meet;they are fore
igners to each other.Important landmark
s have sprung up recently-the Grosvenor
Centre,Northampton House,Barclaycard,  
the Express Lifts Tower(Northampton's  
Lighthouse)and the Derngate Centre.The 
population has expanded from 100000 to 
150000 in this decade,and is expected  
to reach 200000 by the end of this cent
ury.the population structure is changin
g too becoming more cosmopolitain with 
several ethnic and national groups repr
esented from all over the world.*******</content>
