		<title>07Cockfield Hall Farm (cont)</title>
		<content>  There is still evidence of a moat    
 which used to surround the house.We   
 saw a sundial on the front of the     
 house and noticed that no two interior
 doors in The Hall were alike.There is 
 a small orchard to the front of the   
 house containing some very old gnarled
 fruit trees.Old photographs of the    
 farm usually show geese.The farm land 
 extends to 104.5 acres but in 1979 82 
 acres were taken over for opencast    
 mining.The Bainbridges had a farm sale
 and retained very few animals.As their
 land is gradually restored to them    
 their stock will increase.Mr &amp; Mrs    
 Bainbridge have found the opencast    
 work very interesting and have a good 
 relationship with the site workers.   
 They have sold some of their badly    
 drained land to the N.C.B. and in     
 return will receive some flatter      
 better quality land.                  </content>
