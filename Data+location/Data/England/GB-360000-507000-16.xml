		<title>16ORTON - JUBILEE YEAR</title>
		<content>  In 1977, Jubilee year, there were    
 great celebrations in Orton. There was
 a sponsored walk around the Parish    
 boundary_just over 30 miles; streets  
 and houses were decorated with flags  
 and bunting; a community tea was held 
 _in the Market Hall for adults and in 
 the Waverley Room for children. In the
 evening there was a "Tramp's Ball" and
 village entertainment.                
  Every child received a commemorative 
 beaker and badge. Mr Jackson Allan    
 acted as Town Crier and travelled     
 around the area announcing the various
 events _ slow bicycle race, comic     
 football match, childrens sports and  
 tug-of-war across the village stream. 
  Exhibitions of local crafts and past 
 Royal events were held in the Church  
 and the School. Many artifacts of     
 local interest were on display and the
 children made a model Jubilee Street. </content>
