		<content> Apart from the large agricultural     
 community within the block there are  
 the 'commuters' &amp; those who go out to 
 work &amp; purely sleep in their homes.   
 There are the retired people, mothers 
 or fathers at home with their child-  
 ren, parents at home with children at 
 school/work or who have left home &amp; a 
 few unemployed youngsters. Most       
 inhabitants fall in the middle/upper  
 class bracket - the standard of living
 is fairly high. Most households have a
 car (or 2) - a car is almost essential
 in this rural area. There are those   
 who work hard to make ends meet &amp;     
 those who employ domestic servants,   
 gardeners &amp; chauffeurs! Many young-   
 -sters have their own ponies, attend  
 private schools or have nannies which 
 is an indication of the life-style.   
 They lead a good social life &amp;        
 are very fashion conscious.           </content>
