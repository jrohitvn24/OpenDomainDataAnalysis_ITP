		<title>15Mobile Library at Notgrove</title>
		<content> The Mobile Library visits fortnightly 
 on a Wednesday and is used by 6       
 villagers. It is a large blue van from
 Moreton-in-the-Marsh, with a driver   
 and Librarian, and carries many       
 hundreds of books on all topics from  
 Fiction, Biography, Reference Books,  
 a shelf full of large print book and a
 box of Childrens books. There is no   
 limit on the number of books borrowed 
 at one time, and books can be kept for
 several weeks before a reminder is    
 sent. Specific books can be requested,
 and should it be a popular title with 
 a waiting list, the red lable comes   
 into operation, whereby the book must 
 be returned at the next visit of the  
 Library to enable other readers to    
 have the book without too much delay.
