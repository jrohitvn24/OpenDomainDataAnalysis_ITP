 The significant fact that the area is 
 sandwiched between the M1 (west),A6   
 (east) and Luton (south) means that   
 the B579 and the minor road to Chalton
 take a heavy burden of commercial     
 traffic wanting access to the M1      
 junction at Toddington (020297).In    
 addition to the minor route is a      
 direct link for commuters from        
 Houghton Regis to Luton and Sundon    
 Park (0525) to the A6,so peak hour    
 traffic can cause conjestion.Public   
 transport exists along both minor     
 roads including two "country roads".  
 The London-Bedford, electrified line  
 has no significant effect though it   
 runs through the SW corner. Bramingham
 Rd also takes heavy triffic to the A6 
 and Bedford. The new development are  
 likely to necessitate a link road from
 (080265) to (040261).                 </content>
