		<title>11THE AIRPORT THREAT</title>
		<content> In 1964 a public meeting was held in  
 Takeley to organise opposition to the 
 proposal to make Stansted London's new
 airport.  The opposition was success- 
 ful and government was forced to drop 
 its proposals.  These were revived    
 again a few years later when an alter-
 native plan fell through. Again public
 outcry won the day and a second public
 enquiry went against expansion but the
 villagers of Takeley and NW Essex had 
 not fully bargained for the tenacity  
 of government who instigated a third  
 public enquiry in 1984.  This resulted
 in the announcement in 1985 that      
 Stansted would be allowed to expand to
 at first 15 million passenger         
 movements per year and finally to 25  
 million.  This would have to take     
 place within present boundaries and   
 with only the one runway, thus remov- 
 ing the threat of a second runway.    </content>
