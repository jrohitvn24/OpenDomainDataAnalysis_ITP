		<title>08Wright's Flour MIll 2</title>
		<content> At the turn of the century all the    
 millstones except those used to make  
 Imperial Wholemeal Flour were taken   
 out and a continental roller system   
 was installed.In 1909 the water power 
 which had always been used was stopped
 and electricity was then used.During  
 the 2nd World War the mill was        
 constantly under threat of bombing,as 
 it was on the edge of London.Nowadays 
 550 boxes are packed in one hour.The  
 mill now is much more efficient,two   
 new plants are capable of producing   
 three tonnes of flour per hour.The    
 mill has a storage capacity of 2500   
 tonnes of wheat and a 475 tonne bulk  
 storage plant for the finished        
 products.The mill also has its own    
 laboratories and bakery which tests   
 the flour to make sure it is of the   
 finest quality for making bread.
