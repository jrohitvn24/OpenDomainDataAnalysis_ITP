		<title>03      HOUSES.</title>
		<content>    Most of the {houses}in {Funtington}
 are {brick built}with {tiled}roofs.One
 house  was{timber_framed.}We were     
 surprised to find little use of flint 
 as a building material.               
    Many of the houses are{modern,}    
 built within the last forty years.One 
 pair of semi_detached houses were     
 being built when we made our survey.  
    Apart from the many{detached}houses
 in the village, we also saw six{      
{semi_detached,}one row of three{      
{terraced}houses,a lodge,a restaurant  
 but no flats.                         
    We think Funtington village might  
 be a retirement area.It would appear  
 to be quite a wealthy area because    
 most of the houses are privately      
 owned,detached properties with        
 large,secluded gardens.One even had   
 its own tennis court!
