I do not often get a chance to choose  
wht I want to eat. I do like what my   
mum and sister cook.  I do not like big
store food because it is'nt fresh. In  
my country Bangladesh my family has its
own cows,goats and chickens.We grow our
own vegetables and fruit.Since I came  
to this country I always went to shops 
to buy sweets which have made my teeth 
bad. When I was in Bangladesh I did not
eat sweets and we did not have frozen  
food like we do in this country. I eat 
rice and curry everyday  and never get 
bored of it.I don't do the shopping my 
mum,dad or big brother does it.        
Sometimes I eat so much I don't feel   
like eating anymore. I don't like meat 
a lot.I like cherries,strawberries and 
mangoes.
