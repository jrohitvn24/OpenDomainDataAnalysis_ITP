		<content> "I play football at playtime. We play 
 at the side of the school. There are  
 about 7 on each side. I play with the 
 big boys. Sometimes I play tiggy, we  
 run round the climbing frame. Simon is
 on most of the time, because he is not
 very fast".{         Michael, aged 9  
                                       
 "I like playing Dracula's Castle. You 
 must have two people to play it       
 because you have to pretend to go into
 a castle and hear spooky noises. Then 
 we pretend to go upstairs and that we 
 hear Dracula chasing us. We pretend to
 go into a room and lock the door.     
 Sometimes we get caught. I like this  
 game because it is exciting".
