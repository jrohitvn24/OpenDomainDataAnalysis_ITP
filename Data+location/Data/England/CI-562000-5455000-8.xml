		<content> During the 1970's the Parish{football 
 field and changing hut was the subject
 of an ambitious improvement project.  
                                       
 New changing facilities were the first
 improvements and were quickly followed
 by the addition of a{squash}court. The
 second phase added the Sir Billy      
 Butlin Memorial Hall,(a large {Sports 
{Hall),}a further squash court, a      
 lounge, a bar and a canteen.          
                                       
 An adjoining field was converted to a 
 grass playing surface and the Centre  
 now has outdoor facilities for{tennis,
{cricket}and{soccer.                   
                                       
 These amenities are well used by      
 members, the Parish{Youth Club}and the
 children of the Parish who have also  
 been provided with{swings,}a{see-saw  
 and an{adventure playground.          </content>
