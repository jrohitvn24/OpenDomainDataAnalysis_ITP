		<content> Felling of dead and over-crowded trees
 from a copse to open up views of the  
 church has led to an increase in      
 floral species from 13 to 42 in 3     
 years.The spread of the new species is
 being helped by selective hand-weeding
 of rapidly-growing undesirables such  
 as Ragwort,Elder and Creeping Thistle.
 8 species of bird nested in the copse 
 this year.                            
 Some nettles are being maintained to  
 provide breeding grounds for several  
 species of butterflies.               
 Access to village footpaths has been  
 improved by building new stiles.      
 12 mallard ,hand-reared from eggs     
 taken froma nest where the mother had 
 been killed,have been given a home on 
 a secluded village pool.
