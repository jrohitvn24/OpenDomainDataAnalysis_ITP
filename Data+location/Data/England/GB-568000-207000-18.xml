		<title>18Mayoral day, Chelmsford (2)</title>
		<content>   When the awards had been given the  
{mayoress}received her{second bouquet  
 of the day and soon after{18:00}we re-
 turned to the{mayor's house for tea.  
 Here the chains of office were removed
 and while the mayor chatted to us the 
 mayoress served a delicious tea. After
 tea it was time to prepare for the    
{evening engagement.}This took rather  
 longer than expected as our 3 girls   
 decided to have baths before changing 
 into fresh dresses.                   
   The Daimler conveyed us all to{Trin-
{ity Methodist Church}where the{British
{Red Cross Society}was holding a{music-
{al evening}in aid of{Bangladesh Cycl- 
{one Appeal.}Here we were joined by our
 teacher and enjoyed music well played 
 on{Piano,Oboe,Guitar and Recorder.    
   At the interval we said farewell and
 were driven home,realising how{busy}&amp; 
{varied (and tiring)the mayor's day is.</content>
