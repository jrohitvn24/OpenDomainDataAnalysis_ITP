Throughout history this area has been  
referred to as "The Deserts of         
Chiltern"; the most secluded and       
perhaps most beautiful part of the     
Chiltern HIlls. A section of the steep 
escarpment is at Howe Hill at the      
northern end of the area.  The rest is 
undulating countryside.  The soil is   
predominately chalk and was originally 
covered with beechwoods.  Some of the  
trees have now been cleared; arable    
crops and pig rearing are the main     
types of land use. The area contains   
the hamlets of Swyncombe, Cookley Green
and Russells Water and the farming     
communities at Greenfield and Lower    
Greenfield.   In total the number of   
houses is about 3-400.   At Swyncombe  
most people are connected with the     
estate.  Some of the population of the 
area work in nearby towns or London.   </content>
