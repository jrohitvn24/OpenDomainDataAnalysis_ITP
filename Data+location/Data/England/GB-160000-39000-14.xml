		<content> This area is almost entirely rural and
 therefore there is very little        
 industry to be found actually in the  
 area.The exception is the Milk        
 Marketing Board Creamery.This Creamery
 is situated near the Polstrong        
 roundabout and is clearly visible from
 the main roads.As well as producing   
 cream,the creamery produces powdered  
 milk.We were hoping to visit this site
 but this proved impossible owing to   
 the MMB regulations on visits.The     
 parents of several of the children in 
 this school work at this creamery.    
   All other industry which employs    
 people who live in our survey area is 
 outside of our survey area.
