		<content>The Games I Play at Home,Nicola Tripp. 
At home I play Hide and Seek.One person
counts whilst covering their eyes.The  
rest hide and when the person who is on
has counted to a hundred they come to  
lor you and the first person they find 
is on.                                 
  Another game that we play at home is 
Polo.One person is on and chooses a    
subject like colours and the others    
choose which thing they want like the  
colour red. Without letting the person 
who is on know which word belongs to   
each peron,one person calls out what   
all the words are.Then the person who  
is on calls out one of the words and   
has a race back and forwards with the  
person that the word belongs to and the
first person to finish and shout Polo  
is on.
