		<content> Round the back there is an old shed in
 which the verger used to keep the     
 tools for grave digging and for the   
 up-keep of the cemetery. Nowadays the 
 graves are dug by the funeral         
 directors. There are about 500 graves 
 in the cemetery but more people are   
 being cremated. Inside the church     
 there is a painting of the curcifixion
 by the pulpit and this was painted in 
 1870. By the font there is a painting 
 of an old family coat of arms. In 1906
 the old box pews were replaced by the 
 present oak seatsand the church could 
 hold a congregation of 116 adults. The
 front door was replaced at the same   
 time and is made of some kind of pine.
 A set of stairs is found behind a     
 doorway and is extremely old.         
 Apparently these used to lead to some 
 sort of platform. Other stairs are    
 kept locked up as they are dangerous. </content>
