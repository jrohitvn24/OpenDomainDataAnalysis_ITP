		<content>  Eighty years ago the area was        
 essentially concerned with farming and
 to a lesser extent, because of its    
 geographical position, with catering  
 to the needs of people travelling to  
 London from the North and vice versa. 
  Apart from modern housing, there are 
 examples of Medieval, Georgian and    
 Victorian styles of building which use
 local red brick with tiled or slated  
 roofs - some of outstanding beauty.   
  In the last fifty years and          
 particularly in recent years, farming 
 has given way to a significant amount 
 of residential growth. This has been  
 exacerbated by the proximity to London
 and the building of motorways nearby  
 which permits greater flexibility of  
 movement.
