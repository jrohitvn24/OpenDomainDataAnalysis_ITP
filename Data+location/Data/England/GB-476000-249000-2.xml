		<title>02Employment in the Villages</title>
		<content>                                       
Most of the people who live in these   
villages work in other towns and cities
and have to travel to work.{Transport} 
is difficult because the roads are all 
grade 3 and are not salted in winter.  
There are always problems in winter.In 
Hartwell there are jobs in the school, 
engineering,sales in the shop and whare
-houses,lorry driving,farming and      
forestry,so it is quite well off.The   
wood yard has just reopened and this   
has given more {employment} again.There
is no link to the M1 officially so that
there is a further difficulty about    
working away from the village.So far   
the housing has not got too expensive &amp;
young families are still able to use   
Hartwell as a dormitory base.Being     
close to development areas like Milton 
Keynes and Northampton firms do not    
want to come here. Jonathan Tibble,11. </content>
