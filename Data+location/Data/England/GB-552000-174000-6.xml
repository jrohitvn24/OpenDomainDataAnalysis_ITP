		<title>06  JOYCE GREEN HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>In 1901 two tempory hospitals were     
built, the Long Reach hospital which   
had 300 beds and the Orchard hospital  
which had 800 beds.  They were opened  
up because of the small pox emergency  
at that time.  On 28th December 1903   
Joyce Green Hospital was opened incase 
there was another emergency for        
infectious diseases as there had been. 
The Long Reach Hospital was completely 
rebuilt as a permanent hospital in     
1928.  Joyce Green then became an      
ordinary hospital taking in many kinds 
of diseases.  The Orchard hospital was 
then handed over to the goverment in   
1915 as a military hospital. Ther was  
strong local feeling about the         
hospitals as to the risk of infection  
to the town.  Joyce Green is however   
still serving a large part of the      
community today.
