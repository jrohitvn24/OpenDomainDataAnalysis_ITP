		<title>07The Mobile Library Service</title>
		<content>      For people living in very remote 
 areas the Somerset County Council     
 Mobile Library Service is a great     
 help.   The Library Service is        
 financed from the rates and is        
 available to everyone without charge. 
  Mobile libraries serve the rural     
 areas of the county calling in each   
 community at regular times.           
      There is the Mobile Libray which 
 visits with two members of staff and  
 also the Travelling library which has 
 only one librarian.                   
      It is a measure of the remoteness
 of this area and its scattered        
 population that the fortnightly visits
 from the travelling library make only 
 two stops in the whole block.   It    
 stops at 12.55  -  1.05 at Glasses    
 Farm and 1.10  -  1.15 at Langridge   
 Mill.
