		<content>{Village.}Friendly &amp; caring community, 
 offering many sporting &amp; recreational 
 facilities often involving the whole  
 family.                               
{Transport.}The limited bus service    
 restricts people who have no car      
 wishing to visit facilities outside   
 the village such as swimming pools,   
 large supermarkets and other shops.   
{Housing.}Cheaper housing but built in 
 character is needed to encourage      
 families with young children to settle
 in the village thus establishing      
 continuity of the villege school and  
 bringing new blood to the clubs &amp;     
 organisations run in the village.     
{Employment.}Many would like a cottage 
 industry or craft centre set up in the
 village offering local employment to  
 youngsters as most people commute to  
 work.                                 
                                       </content>
