		<title>11ALEXANDRA &amp; HOLLYWOOD PARKS</title>
		<content> There are two parks in our area. They 
 are Hollywood and Alexandra. Alexandra
 is a very clean park and it has a lot 
 of very pretty flowers in it. There is
 also a bowling green, crazy golf,     
 tennis courts, a playground and       
 padling pool. Hollywood Park is very  
 different because it is very hilly    
 whereas Alexandra is very flat.       
 Hollywood hasn't got as many things as
 Alexandra but it has got bowling      
 greens, playgrounds, and rope swings  
 which people have made and we have    
 lots of fun on them. Alexandra and    
 Hollywood are near enough the same    
 size as each other but we can't really
 tell. We enjoy going to Alexandra the 
 best because of the crazy golf and the
 other games to play. The gardeners    
 keep the gardens and greens in        
 beautiful condition for everyone to   
 enjoy.                                </content>
