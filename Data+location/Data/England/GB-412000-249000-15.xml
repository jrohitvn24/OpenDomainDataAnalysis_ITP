		<title>15DORSINGTON CHURCH</title>
		<content> Shaun Garrod and Paul Longford        
 investigated Dorsington Church.....   
 We found out that the whole of        
 Dorsington is based on the church and 
 it is the only organisation in the    
 village. Dorsington does not have a   
 Sunday school because there are only  
 73 people in the village.             
 Other vicars do work in the church but
 only when the Reverend Llewellyn      
 Powell is ill or on holiday.          
 The vicar holds services once every   
 Sunday. The church is one hundred and 
 eighty five years old. The roof of the
 church has been repaired once.        
 Reverend Powell is an archictect but  
 being a vicar takes up most of his    
 time. He was ordained in nineteen     
 seventy.                              
 He enjoys all services but mostly     
 those with young people.
