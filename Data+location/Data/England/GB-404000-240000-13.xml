		<title>13Royal Coat of Arms</title>
		<content>  The year 1985 has seen the completion
 of the restoration of the Royal Arms, 
 which are situated in the church os   
 St. John the Baptist.                 
  This restoration was begun with a    
 visit by a conservationist, Miss Anna 
 Hulbert, in January 1983. She said    
 that, although in poor condition,     
 these RoyalArms were among the most   
 interesting she had ever seen. They   
 are painted on boarding on the East   
 wall of the nave high above the       
 chancel arch, and measure about 2.25  
 metres high amd 6 metres wide. The    
 arms depicted are those used by the   
 four Stuart Kings and Queen Anne until
 1707. On the lion's side of the arms  
 is the Rose of England and on the     
 unicorns side, the Thistle of         
 Scotland. In a different kind of paint
 is the date 1661. This may have been a
 repainting or an insertion.           </content>
