		<title>14VEGETATION ON ASHWORTH MOOR</title>
		<content>   In the north-east of the area{(     
{ASHWORTH MOOR)}there is a type of     
 moorland vegetation which is typical  
 of much of the higher parts of the {  
{ROSSENDALE HILLS.}                    
   The extent to which this vegetation 
 is 'natural' is difficult to asses    
 because it must to some extent be a   
 response to centuries of grazing by   
 animals (mainly sheep).               
   A sample survey was carried out     
 using quadrant squares placed randomly
 at approximately 250 metre intervals  
 from just north of the Edenfield road 
 (altitude 950 feet to near the summit 
 of Knowl Moor (altitude 1200 feet).   
   In each square the percentage value 
 for ground cover was estimated for the
 main species.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
