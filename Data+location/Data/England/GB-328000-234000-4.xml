		<title>04THE TWO CHURCHES.</title>
		<content>   In our area there are two churches, 
{St.Mary's in Craswall,and St.Michael's
 in Michaelchurch.                     
  {Craswall Church}is tiny.Outside     
 there is a{preaching cross}which was  
 used before the church was built.On   
 the north wall of the church there is 
 a red line which was used for a game  
 called{5 Court}an old popular game in 
 Herefordshire.Inside there is an      
 unusual choir loft,like a minstrels   
 gallery.                              
  {Michaelchurch Church}is much bigger.
 It has a bell towewr and 5 bells which
 are not rung now as the structure is  
 dangerous.It has a famous{old plaster}
{painting}on one wall showing Christ   
 surrounded by tools used in the old   
 rural communities.                    
    The churches are quite well        
 attended in this area.
