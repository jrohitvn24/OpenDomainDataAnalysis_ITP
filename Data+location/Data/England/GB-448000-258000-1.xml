		<title>01Background to our block.</title>
		<content>Our block is in a very rural part of   
the East Midlands.It is almost equally 
divided between Northamptonshire and   
Warwickshire.The block contains almost 
the whole of one very small village,a  
hamlet,and several isolated farmhouses.
It contains some of the highest land in
both counties.(Beacon Hill in the north
of our block is 205m high).            
Of historical note are the moated      
church and an original fishpond of an  
ancient Priory at Lower Catesby.At     
Newbold is the site of a deserted medi-
eval village.                          
In the S.E.of the block,is one of the  
most important watersheds in the Mid-  
lands.From it,the Nene River flows     
east,the Leam flows north,and the Cher-
well south to join the Thames.         
Our block is an important area for     
mixed farming.
