		<title>02The Cheese Factory</title>
		<content>   Lovington Farmhouse Cheesemakers,the
 only factory in the area,was built in 
 1968 and employs 9 local people.      
   18 tons of Farmhouse Cheddar are    
 produced each week from the milk of 14
 local farms.Butter is made from the   
 cream.                                
   The cheese is manufactured in 4     
 hours but it must be stored at a      
 temperature of 11C for 7-12 months    
 before it reaches maturity.           
   Whey waste goes to feed pigs on     
 local farms. Care is taken to prevent 
 pollution of the nearby river Brue.   
   Stringent safety measures protect   
 the production team from accidental   
 injury from modern machinery at the   
 576sq.metre factory.                  
   Lovington Cheesemakers display their
 products at the Royal Bath and West   
 Show and are suppliers to Sainsburys.
