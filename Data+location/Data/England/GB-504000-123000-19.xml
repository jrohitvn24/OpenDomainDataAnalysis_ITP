		<title>19A MORNING ON THE FARM</title>
		<content> My dad gets up a 6 o'clock in the     
 morning and he goes to get the cows.  
 Then he milks the cows. When he has   
 milked the cows he goes and has his   
 breakfast. Next he goes and scrapes   
 the yard down to remove all the cows' 
 muck. When he has done that he starts 
 up the tractor and puts the trailer   
 on. He loads the trailer up with hay  
 and feeds it to the cows. Once a cow  
 fell in the river and my dad had to   
 put the winch onto the tractor to     
 pull it out.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
