		<content>  On Bank Holiday Monday May 6th, in   
 Beechcroft Road, a Street Party was   
 organised to Celebrate 40 Years of    
 Peace after the ending of the second  
 World War. After a short service of   
 thanksgiving, by the vicar, the       
 celebrations began. Several came      
 dressed up in the clothes of the time.
 Among them were soldiers, nurses and  
 evacuees. There were games too. A     
 Tug-of-war between neighbouring       
 streets, wheelchair races and other   
 children's games. After the games it  
 was time to eat. There was enough food
 for everyone on the long trestle      
 tables colourfully decked out with    
 bunting and flags. Everyone had great 
 fun and this was another example of   
 the good community spirit among       
 people.
