<title>21Marlowe House 2006 to 2009</title>
<content>I worked in Marlowe House for three years from 2006 working for Bexley Primary Care NHS Trust and the building is a distant memory of the dreams of 70s. The building was definitely very hot to work in, since any signs that it had air conditioning has long vanished. It was interesting to hear that it had a caretaker's flat on the ground floor as it now just functions as the security offices for the building. The Met Police were long term landlords at the time I was there. Most of the exterior walls had to have special cladding to prevent the asbestos from escaping, with annual checks on the cladding's viability. I had the good fortune to been able to have access to the roof which gave beautiful views of surrounding area, though the hum and proximity from mobile phone masts that dotted the roof space made my visits upstairs brief to say the least.&lt;br />
