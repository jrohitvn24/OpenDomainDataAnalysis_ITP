		<title>11THE ROADWATER PLAYERS</title>
		<content> THE ROADWATER PLAYERS  is an amateur  
 dramatic group who have been using the
{village hall}for ten years. You have  
 to be 9 years old or over to join.    
 Every August they have a meeting to   
 decide the next pantomime. They       
 practice 5 nights a week in the hall  
 but they have to be quiet. The money  
 from the tickets goes towards hiring  
 the hall. If you want to join,        
 membership is Â£1.00 and every year you
 pay Â£1.00 towards the costumes. People
 organize the show, some sell tickets  
 for the raffle. The people who play in
 the panto give the prizes. The players
 do other plays besides the panto and  
 each year they look at three or four  
 books to decide which play to do. This
 year they performed 'Joking Apart' by 
 Alan Aikbourne. If you want to join   
 you do not have to live in Roadwater.
