		<title>13The Cat and Man Legend.</title>
		<content>   Sir Percival Cresacre was returning 
 home to Barnburgh Hall from Doncaster 
 where he had been visiting the        
 Fraternity of Grey Friars. He was     
 mounted on his favourite mare,        
 Winifred, who had carried him through 
 many a severe chase and danger. His   
 journey led him through thick woodland
 where the cries of foxs and wolves    
 could be heard.                       
   When he reached Melton Hill he      
 paused and surveyed the scene. He saw 
 the thin light on the horizon, a      
 canopy of dark clouds, and the river  
 to the far right reflected a faint    
 light. He cantered down the hill,     
 through the trees towards Ludwell     
 Spring. Suddenly out of the darkness, 
 a huge wild cat sprang and sank its   
 sharp claws into Winifreds flesh.     
 Winifred reared and plunged madly     
 onwards,but the cat clung on.         </content>
