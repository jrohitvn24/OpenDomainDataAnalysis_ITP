		<content>  Coopers pig farm is in Morland Avenue
 and three of their children go to     
 our school,which is just across the   
 road from the farm.Mrs. Cooper gave us
 some strawberry milk shake made from  
 goats milk. It had a strong taste.    
  Mr Coopers pig farm has been in the  
 family for forty years. On the farm Mr
 cooper keeps a thousand pigs.They were
 mainly pink pigs but he also had a few
 saddlebacks.                          
  Mr Cooper feeds the pigs by using    
 big pipes that automatically fill with
 food.Then the food travels down the   
 pipes and fills the troughs.The pigs  
 squeal at feeding time and Mr Cooper  
 whistles to them to keep them quiet.  
  Most of the pork goes to Walls Meat  
 Company.The farm has regular          
 inspections to check that the pigs are
 healthy.
