		<title>09BEATING THE BOUND</title>
		<content> Beating the bounds happens every seven
 years.They  go round the boundaries of
 Benington.On every boundary they pick 
 someone up and hit them with the      
 shovel that they dig the cross with.  
 The cross is put there to remind      
 them where the boundary is.They dig   
 out the shape of a cross and then put 
 a wooden cross in.It starts at the    
 church where they have a service for  
 half an hour.It also finishes with a  
 cup of tea and biscuits or sandwiches.
 Anyone who knows about it can do it.  
 The people who did it this year, 1985,
 were Andrew Cummins,Robert Bell, Simon
 Clayton and Nicholas Ingamells. Most  
 of the places they went were near     
 dykes.
