		<content> A skateboard is a board curved up at  
 the front,on four wheels 4cm in       
 diameter.You can stand or sit on the  
 board.It is fast and some padding is  
 needed on knees and elbows.Skilled    
 children can negotiate the ramps and  
 steps and other hazards built for them
 out of doors.                         
 A rollerboot is a boot on wheels. A   
 stopper at the front can be used as a 
 brake.A rollerdisco is held indoors.  
 you pay to get in and can hire boots  
 as well.The boots are made of leather 
 or plastic in many bright colours.    
 Impossible ball is a small ball made  
 of foam.It is unevenly weighted so    
 that it will roll but when you throw  
 it in the air it wriggles about a lot.
 It is better to play with it outside  
 because it moves quickly in unexpected
 directions.
