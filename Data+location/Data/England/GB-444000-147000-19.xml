		<content>   There is a police station in        
 Whitchurch,but it is not manned all   
 hours during the week,it is open for a
 couple of hours on certain days of the
 week.If something serious happens then
 the police in Basingstoke must be     
 informed.The town used to be cared for
 by the Andover area.                  
   The town does have a doctor's       
 surgery and the area is looked after  
 by a group practice consisting of     
 three doctors.These look after the    
 health of not only the people in the  
 town but of the surrounding           
 villages.The surgery is open every    
 morning and afternoon during weekdays.
