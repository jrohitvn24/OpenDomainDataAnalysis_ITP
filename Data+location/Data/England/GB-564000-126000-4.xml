		<content> There are six people in my family - my
 father,mother,three brothers and      
 myself.My youngest brother and I go to
 primary school in Stonegate,whilst my 
 second eldest brother attends the     
 secondary school in the next village- 
 Wadhurst.My eldest brother goes to a  
 special school as he is disabled.Daddy
 works in London and Mummy looks after 
 the house.We have 16 ducks,one dog and
 one guinea pig.We like swimming, and  
 Mummy and I enjoy gardening.I have my 
 own piece of garden where I like      
 planting things.My eldest brother is  
 15 years old.He is very heavy and we  
 need to use a hoist to help him into  
 bed.He likes to eat chocolate and     
 Weetabix,and loves to watch trains.
