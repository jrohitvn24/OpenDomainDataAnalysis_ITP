		<content>   Rudhall Brook flows through our     
 area.It was from this brook the monks 
 of Eccleswall diverted some water to  
 form their fish pond.                 
   The brook was not in good condition,
 the sides were overgrown and there was
 mud everywhere.There was a waterfall  
 about half way down,you could just see
 it through the bushes.The water was   
 fast flowing and in some places the   
 water was about three feet deep.      
   We did not see any fish in the brook
 but if there were any in there it     
 would not be any good for fishing     
 because there were a lot of sticks and
 branches in the way and you would get 
 your line caught up.                  
   We found snakes'holes by the brook  
 on the bank.There was evidence that   
 people walked along the footpaths by  
 the brook;there were footprints and   
 bridges over the brook made of planks.</content>
