		<title>07Pinley Abbey Farm</title>
		<content> This is a fascinating farm because the
 buildings are very old; the farm house
 dates back to the thirteenth century  
 and it was added to in the sixteeth   
 century.  The main farmhouse is being 
 restored at the moment.  There are    
 some remains of the old chapel which  
 stood here in the twelfth century.    
 The map shows what appears to be a    
 lake on the site; this is really more 
 of a pond and is all that remains of  
 the moat which once surrounded the    
 Abbey.  The buildings attract a great 
 deal of interest from historians and  
 visitors to the area.                 
 The farm has 120 acres of land which  
 is mostly used for arable crops,      
 cattle and horses.  About 40 Arab     
 horses are kept here for breeding     
 purposes.  Some are exported to Arabia
 but not all.
