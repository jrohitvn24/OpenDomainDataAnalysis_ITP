 a sister and brother, on saturday i   
 get up at 7.30 and watch t.v.a.m. on  
 the television i have a  friend around
 i help dad do the garden, and mum do  
 the washing-up i sometimes clean my   
 bedroom .my mum has got a sewing      
 machine when she has time i sit with  
 her and make Barbies clothes.My dog   
 gets dirty and we have to give him a  
 bath when he gets back from his walk. 
 I have a bath on sunday and get ready 
 for bed. We have the jeep at the      
 weekend and often go on the moors.I   
 like playing darts and rounders with  
 my brother and sister and play        
 cassettes. My Brother sometimes allows
 me to spend my pocket money.
