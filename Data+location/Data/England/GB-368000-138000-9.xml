   Being on the{Roman road}from{Bath   
 to{Glastonbury}it was originally a    
{15th century coach house}and was      
 obliged to accept any person requiring

{skittles, alley skittles}and also a   
{fruit machine.                        
                                       
   The store house use to be a stable. 
 Some windows were blocked up during   
 17th century to avoid{window tax.}Two 
 were re-opened in 1980. A passage runs
 from the lounge to the  church yard.  
                                       
   Custom is now mainly local although 
 there are  occasional{tourists.       </content>
