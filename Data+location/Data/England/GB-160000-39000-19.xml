		<content> The survey area has many small        
 isolated communities and many narrow  
 roads and country lanes linking       
 them.The main line railway passes     
 through the area,but there are no     
 stations actually in our square.The   
 bus services provided by Western      
 National and the independent Grenville
 Bus Company tend to operate along the 
 major routes,and in any case would be 
 unable to negotiate many of the       
 accesses to villages and farms.       
 Therefore it would be true to say that
 a large proportion of the survey area 
 is without any effective form of      
 public transport within a reasonable  
 distance. In the more remote parts of 
 the area therefore a car would appear 
 to be a neccesity if any travelling at
 all is to be undertaken. This is a    
 common problem in rural areas and is  
 made worse by a lack of amenities.    </content>
