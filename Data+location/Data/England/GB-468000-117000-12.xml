		<title>12BUTSER ANCIENT FARM PROJECT</title>
		<content> The Iron Age farm is a working        
 scientific laboratory for research    
 into prehistoric archaeology and      
 agriculture.Opened in 1975 the        
 demonstration farm area of 14 hectares
 has two fields of crops giving        
 information about crop  yields per    
 hectare of ancient cereals such as    
 Emmer and Spelt wheat.Flax,woad and   
 Celtic bean are also grown.Several    
 traditional weeds of cornfields,now   
 rare,due to the use of herbicides,    
 have been introduced into one of the  
 fields.An extensive collection of     
 herbs from the pre Roman period is    
 grown on specially formed lynchet     
 banks.Soay sheep and Dexter cattle are
 kept in the paddocks as these animals 
 most closely resemble the ancient     
 breeds.The Dexter cows are being      
 trained in ploughing using the ancient
 ard.                                  </content>
