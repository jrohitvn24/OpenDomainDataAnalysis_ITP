		<title>14THE ROCHDALE CANAL</title>
		<content>                                       
      The Rochdale Canal passes through
 Castleton on its way from Manchester  
 to Yorkshire. When the canal was built
 in 1804 the village was called Blue   
 Pits. The canal meant that it was     
 possible to travel from the German    
 Ocean (the North Sea) to the Irish    
 Sea, crossing the Pennines. Previously
 goods could only be transported over  
 the Pennines by pack horse.           
      Many special engineering skills  
 were required and the Castleton       
 section of the canal cost half a      
 million pounds to build.              
      Where Gypsy Lane crossed the     
 canal the world's first skew bridge   
 was built and is remarkably still in  
 existence.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
