		<content>  We have done a land use survey of our
 area.We found out that most of the    
 farms had orchards in them even when  
 they grew grain products and hops.    
  The crops grown include wheat,grass, 
 oats,winter and spring barley,hops,   
 various vegetables and in one field   
 south of the Medway rape.             
  Most farms specialise in one main    
 crop except for the Hadlow College    
 Farms.These grow lots of products to  
 show the students how to grow them.   
  Our area used to be a very important 
 hop growing area,but now only a few   
 fields have hops in them.The area has 
 been known for its fruit for a long   
 time and still produces a variety and 
 quantity of fruit.                    
  The farm I visited grew a lot of     
 grass to turn into silage.
