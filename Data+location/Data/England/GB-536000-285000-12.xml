		<content>   The aim of the college is to provide
 both formal and social education.     
 Formal education takes place at the 40
 evening classes. The college hopes to 
 attract between 500-600 people after  
 September. The fees work out on       
 average at 70 pence per hour for an   
 adult student. The courses must be    
 self-financing and 25% of money raised
 goes to Cambridgeshire County Council.
   The college also runs several groups
 which help to develop secretarial and 
 managerial skills. One example is the 
 Mothers and Toddlers group. The Pre-  
 School Play Group has a large         
 committee which all members are       
 encouraged to join and contribute to. 
 In the summer holidays there is a     
 playscheme with 250 members for young 
 children aged 3-12. There is a day    
 centre for the elderly which meets    
 twice weekly. There are 100 members.  </content>
