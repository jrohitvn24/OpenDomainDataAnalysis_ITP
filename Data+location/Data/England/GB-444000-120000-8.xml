 up at 08 00, put on my school uniform 
 (grey shirt and trousers,green and    
 silver striped tie,green jersey) go   
 down stairs and feed my cat. After    
 breakfast I walk from Park Lane to    
 Otterbourne School. I cross the road  
 with the lollipop lady and arrive at  
 school at 08 40.I play until Whistle  
 at 08 55, then go to my classroom and 
 read until Assembly at 09 10. I am in 
 the choir. We sing songs and say      
 prayers. Then we have maths until     
 playtime at 10 30. We play on the     
 playground or the field.              
     From 10 45 to 11 55 we work. The  
 people who eat cooked school dinners  
 eat first, the sandwich eaters have   
 lunch at 12 35.
