		<content>  Recently we visited the {Post Office}
and asked some questions.              
  The owners have to be up at 05.00    
hours whilst the people who deliver the
letters arrive at 06.00 hours.Four     
ladies and one man deliver the         
post.Between 300 and 400 letters a day 
are posted.                            
   A first class stamp costs 17 pence  
and a second class stamp costs 13      
pence.Road tax for a car is 100 pounds 
a year.Family allowance is 6.85 a week 
for each child. Adult women use the    
{Post Office} most often.              
  The only change since 1980 has been  
the ending of telegrams.The owners     
don't forsee many changes except wider 
use of plastic money.                  
  At {Christmas} time they have to take
on extra help to deliver all the       
additional cards and parcels.
