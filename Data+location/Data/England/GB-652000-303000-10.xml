		<title>10The old railway line</title>
		<content> Since the old Yarmouth to Lowestoft   
 railway branch line was closed some   
 fifteen years ago the old railway     
 land has mostly been lying derelict.  
 The station area at the junction of   
 Victoria Rd and Lowestoft Rd has been 
 cleared of buildings and converted to 
 a pleasant grassed area, used by local
 children, and those walking dogs      
 especially. North of this, however,   
 the deep cuttings have degenerated    
 into rubbish dumps. The proposed inner
 relief road from the south into       
 Yarmouth is to be routed along this   
 track.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
