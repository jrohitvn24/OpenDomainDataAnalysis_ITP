		<title>08MIDDLE FARM - FELTWELL FEN</title>
		<content>   On Middle Farm they grow potatoes,  
 (288 hectares> sugar beet, (250       
 hectares) cereals, (400 hectares)     
 beans, (192 hectares) carrots, (l62   
 hectares) and grass (150 hectares) The
 carrots are sent off for canning,     
 freezing and for juices. The potatoes 
 are sent off for crisps, chips and    
 packing. The fields are worked many   
 times. First they are ploughed then   
 harrowed, rolled and drilled. Weeds   
 grow fast on the fen so the crops are 
 sprayed with weedkillers and pesticide
 and later hoed.                       
   They have a computer at Dairy One   
 which checks the cows body weights,   
 how much food it needs and tells the  
 dairyman everything he wants to know  
 about the cow. At Dairy two they      
 haven't got one because it's too      
 expensive. There used to be a lot more
 cows than there are now.              </content>
