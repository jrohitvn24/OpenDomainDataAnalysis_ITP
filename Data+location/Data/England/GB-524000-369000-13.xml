		<content>  BBC North, Yorkshire T.V. and Radio  
 Lincolnshire include our area. The    
 Lincolnshire Standard has a section   
 covering Horncastle but the Horncastle
 News is the only completely local     
 newspaper. 6500 copies of the         
 Horncastle News are printed in        
 Horncastle every week plus 300000     
 other papers for places throughout the
 country. There is over  Â£1,000,000    
 worth of machinery and Â£350,000 worth 
 of computers at the new factory which 
 provides employment for about 50      
 people. The paper, each roll measuring
 4 miles, is imported from Scandinavia 
 and Canada. There are 6 reporters who 
 rely on local correspondents and the  
 public to inform them of events taking
 place within a radius of about 10     
 miles. The paper was started in       
 September 1885 by Mr Morton and is now
 run by Mr Phillip Sharp.              </content>
