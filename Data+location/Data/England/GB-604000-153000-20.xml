		<title>20THE HERONRY</title>
		<content>   The Heronry in Chilham is very      
 important for the village because the 
 Heron has become the village emblem.  
 The Heronry is found in the casle     
 estate and it is very ancient, going  
 back to the original Domesday book.   
 There is a village legend that if     
 after their migration the Herons do   
 not return by Valentine's day(February
 14th.), something unfortunate will    
 happen to the Lord of the castle.     
 There are  about 6 to 8 nests in the  
 Heronry now and the Heron is quite a  
 common bird in the village. The Heron,
 with it's long, sharp, bill, long legs
 and neck can often be seen in the     
 castle estate. They can be seen around
 the castle lake and other ponds and   
 streams feeding on fish and frogs.
