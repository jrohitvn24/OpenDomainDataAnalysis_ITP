The main concern of the young people   
of Akeley is the fear that the County  
Council will consider the village      
school too small and close it.  Thus   
putting another nail in the coffin of  
their village: the church has gone, no 
shops and a very run down village      
hall - inadequate bus service.  Ahead, 
the fear of unemployment and nuclear   
war, come in that order.  Most people  
are mainly concerned with family wel-  
fare, their lonliness, perhaps how to  
pay their bills, but they delight in   
the beautiful area in which they live. 
On a fine sunny day, it's hard to      
visualise a nuclear wasteland when you 
can see the grass grows, no matter     
what.
