 1890 and 1970.Victorian and Edwardian 
 terraces are near the station.Larger  
 detached houses with big gardens are  
 in quieter secluded roads further     
 from the centre. Some are now used for
 flats, hotels and other purposes.There
 are three main{estates,}all on city   
 outskirts: Weeke (council housing)    
 (1950s), Teg Down (1960s), Harestock  
 (1970s). Many of these houses are semi
 detached with small/medium gardens.   
 Most post 1960 houses have garages.   
 During the last 20 years there has    
 been infilling. Brick and tile are the
 main building materials. Often people 
 move house within Winchester.Harestock
