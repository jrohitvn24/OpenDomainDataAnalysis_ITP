		<title>13     A BARRISTER'S LIFE</title>
		<content>      My name is Shaun Spencer. I am 41
 years old and have lived in Wighill   
 since 1976.                           
                                       
     I am a barrister by profession,   
 taking my degree in l965 and being    
 called to the Bar in l968. Since then 
 I have practised on the North Eastern 
 Circuit from my chambers in Leeds.    
                                       
      I work in court most days,       
 wearing robes of wig, gown, wing-     
 collar and bands. Robes are           
 oppressive in hot weather. Most of my 
 court work is done in Leeds, but I    
 also go to other cities.  About half  
 my work is criminal - the rest is     
 'civil'. The bulk of this is made up  
 of personal injuries claims where     
 compensation is sought. If I am not in
 court I do paper work in chambers. I  
 enjoy my work.                        </content>
