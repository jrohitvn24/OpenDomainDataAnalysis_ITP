The hurdle maker has died and his cottage is let to a woman who works at the public house in Gussage All Saints. &amp;#13;&amp;#10;See page 6 for a link to hurdlemaking in 2011.&amp;#13;&amp;#10;The land originally used for chicken and intensive pig rearing has been sold to a retired businessman.The land changed hands about in about 1995, is not farmed and is only part of the former estate together with some of the cottages.The land is part of an ELS/HLS scheme to cover the farmland at Bowerswaine for the sustainability of wildlife.The cottages are occupied by a retired groundsman and an employee of Bowerswaine Farmhouse. There is also a cricket pitch, small aircraft landing strip and tennis courts.&amp;#13;&amp;#10;The modernised farmhouse has had the front windows returned to the original appearance.   &lt;br />
