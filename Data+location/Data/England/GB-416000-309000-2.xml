Our Church was built in the 12th       
century, Norman.The large arch inside  
was Norman,dividing the Nave from the  
South Aisle until it was restored in   
1848.Sir Thomas Arderne companion in   
arms of Edward the Black Prince,resored
and enlarged the Church in the style of
that period.A century after Sir John   
Stanley made the South and also the    
Chantry Chapel dedicated to the Virgin 
Mary.The roses and portcullises on the 
South Aisle windows are supposed to    
mark the relationship of Stanley with  
Kig Henry the 7th who was believed to  
have had a secret meeting with Stanley 
the night before the Battle of Bosworth
persuading him to turn from Richard the
3rd.That is how we have our Church     
today.
