		<content>{McEWEN'S BOILERS                      
 At McEwen's Boilers they use a lot of 
 hand tools,such as dividers,spirit    
 levels,protractors,cold chisels and a 
 corking machine.The tools have        
 sometimes to be made at the shop      
 because they cannot be bought.They use
 only one type of metal,it is called   
 Carbon Steel.They buy it in tubes and 
 flat sheets. They have to shape the   
 metal at their workshop.There are only
 five employees,but they have to be    
 hard working.They make about three    
 boilers each month,but this depends on
 how big the boilers need to be.Most of
 the electrical parts are done by a    
 local electrician,Mr West.The business
 has been going for about seven        
 years.Boilers are made to fit.The     
 carbon steel sheets are shaped and    
 drilled using patterns and joined to  
 make the boiler the required shape.   </content>
