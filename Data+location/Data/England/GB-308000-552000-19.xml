		<content> The  Voluntary  Car  Service is now to
 charge  10p  per mile for each person.
 This is to try to  reduce the expenses
 of the service.  Three books by Hunter
 Davies were reviewed. These were:{Good
{Guide to the Lakes,  A Walk Around the
{Lakes,}and{Land of the Lakes. }Here is
 a poem from the magazine:             
                                       
 Of all the gay places of public resort
{At Brighton or Scarboro,at both or at 
{court,                           }    
 There is none like sweet Silloth of   
 which I can boast,{As charming the    
{sands, so healthy the coast,}         
 Rheumatics, scorbutics and scrofulous 
 kind,{ Hysterics and vapours,disorders
{of mind,                              
 By bathing and cleansing are made     
 quite anew, {As thousands have proven 
{and know to be true.                  
                                       </content>
