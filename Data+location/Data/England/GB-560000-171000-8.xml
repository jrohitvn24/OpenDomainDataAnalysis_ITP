		<title>08The Blue Lake</title>
		<content> The Blue Lake was formed in 1933 when 
 diggers in the area hit natural       
 springs 14 feet below the water       
 table. A lake was formed overnight. It
 was 33 feet deep in the shallowest end
 and 38 feet deep in the deepest.      
 Previously, there had been a Saxon    
 cemetery on the site. This was        
 accidentally discovered by men        
 excavating for chalk. The lake became 
 polluted in 1974 when the bearings on 
 the kilns in the cement factory broke 
 down, and instead of pumping out water
 they pumped out crude oil into the    
 lake. The owners, Blue Circle Cement  
 Works, have put the lake to many uses.
 These include a fishing lake, a water 
 supply to the factory and an emergency
 reservoir for water in a bad drought. 
 Many people have lost their lives by  
 drowning or committing suicide in the 
 lake.                                 </content>
