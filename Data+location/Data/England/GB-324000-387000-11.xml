 I woke up at forty_seven minutes past 
 seven.I went downstairs and had my    
 breakfast my cereal was 'START' ,I    
 also had some toast.After my breakfast
 I watched television for half an hour 
 then I dressed.At ten o'clock I went  
 with my dad to the Exhaust Centre to  
 get a new exhaust for the car.After   
 that I picked up my sister from ballet
 class.Then I went home and had my     
 lunch which was a salmon batch.In the 
 afternoon I playedwith my plastercine 
 and made an aeroplane.At four o'clock 
 my friends came for tea.It was a      
 buffet.We had crisps,sausage,lettuce, 
 carrots and eggs.After tea I played   
 outside in the street.Then I came in  
 and played on my computer.After that I
 watched some more televsion and I went
 to bed at half past eight.....
