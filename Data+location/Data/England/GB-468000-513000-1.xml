		<content>     Block GR04680513 is approximately 
 6 km E. of Guisborough just S. of the 
 A171. The S.E. corner is in the       
 N. Yorkshire Moors National Park. The 
 height above sea level varies from 450
 to 650 feet.  It is of predominantly  
 agricultural land mainly used for     
 livestock. A small area is wooded,    
 mostly flanking 2 streams lying N. to 
 S.                                    
     There are 2 farming villages,     
 Liverton, the smaller one, lies in the
 N.E. corner of the block.  It has a   
 Church, a Pub and a few houses.       
 Moorsholm is on the W. side of the    
 block situated on an unclassified road
 which is prone to subsidence.  This   
 road connects Moorsholm with Liverton 
 and then on to Loftus.  There is very 
 little through traffic. There are 2   
 shops, Post Office, Church, Chapel,   
 Village Hall and a Public House.      </content>
