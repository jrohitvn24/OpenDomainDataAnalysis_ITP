		<content>   {Sculptors}have been working in     
 Grizedale Forest since 1977. The      
 Sculptures are made mostly            
 of wood but also of other materials   
 such as metal and rock. The subjects  
 are mostly animals and figures, but   
 there are some abstract shapes too.   
    These are the names some of the    
 sculptures; Heron, Boar, Scale Green  
 Bird Man, Deer Hunter, Private        
 Meeting, Crows, Midnight Feast,       
 Waiting For Lunch, Cliff Sculpture,   
 Ting, The Seven Spires, Woodland      
 Winders. Most people like the Private 
 Meeting, the Scale Green Bird Man is  
 also popular. The sculptors come from 
 all over the country and stay in the  
 forest chalets when they are making   
 the sculptures. They are supported by 
 a grant from Northern Arts. My        
 favourite sculpture is the spider     
 Waiting For Lunch.                    </content>
