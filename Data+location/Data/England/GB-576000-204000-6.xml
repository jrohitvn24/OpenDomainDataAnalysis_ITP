		<title>06  DANBURY  PALACE</title>
		<content> Danbury Palace began to be built as a 
 home for Mr John Round in 1828 and was
 completed by 1832.The building was    
 known as Danbury Park at this time but
 the name changed to its present name  
 in 1845 when it became the Bishop of  
 Rochesters house.In its time the      
 Palace has been used as a Maternity   
 hospital and in 1945 the Queen        
 presented a layette to the 2,000th    
 baby born there.The Wigans who owned  
 the building at that time left in 1946
 and Essex County Council, who had     
 bought the property,used it as a Civil
 Defence training centre.In 1969 it was
 taken over for use by Mid Essex       
 Technical Collage and in 1972 the     
 Anglian  Regional Management Centre   
 was formed.The Residential unit was   
 completed and opened in the summer    
 1974.It is used for business purposes,
 and for social events.                </content>
