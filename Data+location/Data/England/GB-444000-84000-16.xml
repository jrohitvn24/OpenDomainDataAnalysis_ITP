		<content>   The day for one farmer's wife begins
 "seldom before 8 unless he needs a    
 packed lunch. Then I shower, dress my 
 little girl and get breakfast. The    
 day may be taken up with housework or 
 gardening. Two days a week I either   
 go to a friend's for the day or she   
 comes to me. Being isolated, my       
 daughter would seldom see children    
 otherwise." Keeping home and looking  
 after her two year old is a full time 
 job. Nevertheless, she finds time for 
 work with the NSPCC. "When I left work
 I picked one such society that I could
 support properly. Now that my time is 
 more flexible I can devote some of it 
 to this. I also belong to the Island's
 Conservative Ladies Association."     
   "I go to Aerobics when I can and    
 read a lot. It doesn't sound very     
 exciting does it? But its very        
 fulfilling and it keeps me happy."    </content>
