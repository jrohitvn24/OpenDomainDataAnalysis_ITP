<title>20The Town Centre, Corby</title>
<content>For many years Corby had a mediocre town centre with not very many shops, and most people went to other shopping centres in places like Kettering, Leicester or Northampton. In 2007, however, a new shopping area opened in the Town Centre called Willow Place with lots of new shops. We also now have a new theatre known as the Corby Cube, a 50-metre swimming pool and a planned restaurant quarter. Corby now has a town centre of regional importance.&lt;br />
