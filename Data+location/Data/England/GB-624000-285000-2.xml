		<content> The Views In Alburgh                  
                                       
                                       
  The flat land falls to the marshes   
 and river of the Waveney. Apart from  
 occasional wooded areas the landscape 
 is one of large fields interspersed by
 hedges in which rises the occasional  
 fully grown tree. Many hedges have    
 been removed in the cause of progress 
 though around the school, where, until
 recently dairying was carried out the 
 fields are small with many tall hedges
 surrounding them. This farm, not for  
 sale, must I am sure follow the       
 pattern of others and hedges make way 
 for large machinery and cereal crops. 
 In the valley it is proposed to build 
 a new bypass along the old railway    
 track to take traffic from the village
 of Wortwell.
