 for the start. Any more children make 
 a queue. The person in fourth square

 are out and go to the back of the     
 queue. The first person in the queue  
 goes into first square  and the rest  
 move on if they can.If they cant      
 they stay in that square.

 two people and someone is on it and   
 some other people hide and the person 
 on it has to find them. The person who

 is hiding, the person who is  on it   
 says freeze whatever their name is
