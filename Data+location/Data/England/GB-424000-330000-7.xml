		<title>07HOUSES IN ETWALL</title>
		<content> In Etwall there are lots of different 
 types of houses. Some of them are     
 council houses, some are very old     
 houses and there are also houses which
 are quite modern. There is an old     
 house on the corner of Sandypits Lane 
 which was built in 1879. There are    
 also houses which have just been built
 these are for the old people to live  
 in. There are still some houses being 
 built at the bottom of Belfield Road. 
 There are also quite a few council    
 houses on Belfield Road. These are    
 also going to be demolished. The      
 other type of house is a house which  
 is not very old. In my kitchen is a   
 microwave, a cooker, a cupboard, a    
 heater, a radiator. a spin drier and a
 washing machine. This is an average   
 kitchen at the moment.
