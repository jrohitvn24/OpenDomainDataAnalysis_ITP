		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AN ORDINARY CHILD
 The ordinary child rises at 7.30.     
 They would have a part wash,washing   
 face,neck and perhaps arms and legs.  
 The average breakfast consists of     
 cereal,toast and coffee.He or she     
 would come to school by car.In the    
 middle of the day the child could have
 school dinners or pack lunch.At 3.05  
 the child will come home and read or  
 play outside until tea.Tea is a cooked
 meal consisting of vegetables,some    
 kind of meat and salard.After tea the 
 child would amuse themselves by       
 watching television or playing outside
 again until 9.30 which is bedtime.The 
 child would read for a while until the
 child is relaxed and can get to sleep 
 or until the child would be told to   
 put the light out.
