		<content> THE OLD GRANGE DATES BACK TO THE 12TH 
 CENTURY &amp; NOW BELONGS TO MR A.SALTER. 
 A CISTERCIAN MONASTERY AT BRUERN      
 ABBEY BOUGHT 6 FARMS WITHIN A 10 MILE 
 RADIUS. EACH WAS A GRANGE BUILT OF    
 TIMBER THEN STONE.THEY BUILT FISH POND
 USING WATER FROM A SPRING. THEY DUG   
 OUT A RECTANGLE 10x40 YARDS, PUT IN A 
 SLUICE AND LET THE WATER IN.THE BASE  
 OF THE POND IS MADE OF IMPERVIOUS BLUE
 CLAY.TO THIS DAY WATER LEAVES THE POND
 TO JOIN THE RIVER SEVERN EVENTUALLY.  
 THERE IS ALSO A 13TH CENTURY DOVECOTE 
 IN THE GARDEN. A FAMOUS STORY IS THAT 
 DICK TURPIN STOPPED AT THE OLD GRANGE 
 TO REST BLACK BESS IN THE STABLE.THERE
 IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE GHOST OF A PAST 
 OWNER WHO WAS BURNT TO DEATH IN A FIRE
 BUT NOW 'WALKS' TO THE STAG'S HEAD AT 
 SWALCLIFFE EACH NIGHT FOR A DRINK.IN  
 1953 MR SALTER MOVED IN &amp; HAVE PUT IN 
 ELECTRICITY, RUNNING WATER &amp; TELEPHONE</content>
