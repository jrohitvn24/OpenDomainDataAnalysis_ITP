		<title>14LEISURE IN SWANMORE</title>
		<content> In Swanmore people who are different  
 ages like different things.  Most     
 elderly ladies like talking about     
 knitting, sewing and cooking.  At the 
 Lunch Club they can do all that as    
 well as read the paper.  Now for      
 someone a lot younger, the toddler.   
 The Playgroup is a place for toddlers.
 They paint, draw and make models, as  
 well as go on walks.  Now for someone 
 a bit older, the teenager, there is   
 the Friday Club, Youth Club, Swimming,
 Brownies, Guides, Cubs and Scouts as  
 well as Bowls.  Mum and Dad haven't   
 got much of a life.  Dad can go to    
 Darts, Pool, Golf and Cricket.  Mum   
 can go to the Women's Institute and   
 Saint Barnabas Wives, Keep Fit or     
 Evening Classes.
