		<title>10NORWOOD PARK - THE HOUSE</title>
		<content>    Today, Norwood Park is a dairy farm
 but in 1781 it was recorded as a wood-
 land area with good herbage supporting
 a large number of deer. At that time  
 the park was 172 acres and this stayed
 intact until the mid-19th Century.    
    Originally the park was a rural    
 retreat for the Abbots of Glastonbury 
 and was situated at a convenient      
 distance from the abbey for them to   
 walk to, for privacy and sport. The   
 house was built in the abbacy of      
 John de Selwood in 1457. His monogram 
 can be seen on the wall of the        
 house. Some of the original blue lias 
 stone building exists today but       
 additions have been made. Features of 
 the house include a wide wooden door  
 through which the sacred bull could be
 led to be locked away at night. Near  
 the door is a hole which could have   
 been a leper hole.                    </content>
