		<title>19THE RITZ, LINCOLN.</title>
		<content> On the  High  Street is the  old Odeon
 Cinema  renamed  the{ Ritz Theatre.}It
 opened  under its new name in February
 1985  and  shows live entertainment as
 well  as  films. However, it is       
 threatened with{closure}before the end
 of  the  year. Box  office takings are
 disappointing  and  the  theatre  is  
 losing  money  at  the  rate of{Â£500}a
 week. The  former  Odeon  closed  when
 cinema  audiences  dwindled. Now  it  
 seems  that  the Ritz is faring little
 better, despite  the  appearance  of  
 Hollywood  stars such as{Omar Shariff.
 Only{14}people  watched  a film on one
 night  in  May  and  the  owner  was  
 disappointed. He  is  quoted as saying
 that  the  cinema side of the business
 is  disastrous  and  if Lincoln people
 were  not  careful, the place would be
 a{parking lot}or a{supermarket}by this
 time next year.                       </content>
