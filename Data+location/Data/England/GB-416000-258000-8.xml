		<title>08A typical day</title>
		<content> As a housewife and mother, a daughter 
 studing for A levels and a son at     
 preparatory school my day begins      
 early. I take my son to school in     
 Warwick then come home to clean house,
 launder and work in the garden.       
 Lunchtime is usually spent either at a
 friends or entertaining at home.      
 After lunch an a chat its back home to
 iron and prepare the evening meal. I  
 enjoy cooking so I put a lot of effort
 into my meals.                        
 My son arrives home from school at 4pm
 we have a cup of tea and discuss his  
 day, play games or work with his      
 computer.                             
 My husband and daughter arrive home   
 at about 6.30pm and we have our meal. 
 After bathing my son I read him a     
 bedtime story.
