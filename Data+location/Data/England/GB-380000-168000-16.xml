 opened as a children's home in 1920   
 but previous to that,from 1907 to 1920
 it was a private house.In 1920 it was 
 a normal home for ophans,waifs and    
 strays as they were called then.Then  
 myself and Joyce were trained as      
 nannies.From 1969 and on it has been  
 for the mentally handicapped          
 children,lots of them grown up, so at 
 the moment their ages are from 11 to  
 21. Mealtimes are flexible because we 
 try to make home life as normal as    
 possible.
