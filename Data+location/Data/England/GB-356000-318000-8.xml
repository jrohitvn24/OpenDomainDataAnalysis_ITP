		<content> There is little through traffic,      
 except on the B5O63 and there are no  
 scheduled bus services.  Most families
 have their own cars; youths have motor
 cycles and children, as well as       
 adults, have cycles. Children of      
 school age are transported by special 
 bus to their schools in the nearby    
 towns and villages.  Voluntary Car    
 Schemes operate by which people       
 without their own cars can make       
 essential journeys, contributing      
 roughly the cost of an equivalent bus 
 fare.  Generally, people are more     
 mobile than town dwellers.  Roads     
 other than the B5O63 are narrow lanes,
 mainly used by farm vehicles, private 
 cars and occasionally heavy farm      
 equipment, such as combine harvesters.
