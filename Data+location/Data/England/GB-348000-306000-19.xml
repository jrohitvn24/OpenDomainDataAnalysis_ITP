   To play it,two people swing the rope
 and about three other people get in a 
 line.The first person in the line     
 jumps into the skipping rope.The other
 people sing,"Down Mississippi if you  
 miss a loop you're out you're in."On  
 "in" the next person jumps in.{       
{ Manfield Gardens.                    
   Two people swing the rope and the   
 third jumps it while the others sing, 
 "Manfield Gardens,what are you going  
 to have?"Then you start spinning the  
 rope and singing,"High,low,swing,     
 garlic, pepper."If you land on high   
 you have to jump bringing your knees  
 up to your chest.Low is crouching     
 down,swing is normal,garlic is round  
 and round with your eyes closed,and   
 pepper is just closing your eyes.If   
 you don't do ten skips you are out.
