		<content> Most of the houses in the area are    
 private, although there are some      
 council houses.The houses in the town 
 centre, in the village of Elworth and 
 out in the country are the eldest     
 houses.Outside the town centre and on 
 the outskirts of the village the      
 houses are generally newer.These      
 houses have been built since the      
 beginning of the 20th century.Most of 
 the houses are semi-detached,but still
 there are a lot of detached,terraced  
 and bungalows,but there are very few  
 flats.The size and design of these    
 houses varies greatly.                
 There is one small{new housing estate}
 being built at the rear of Elworth C. 
 of E. Cont.School.It contains detached
 ,semi-detached and terraced houses and
 some flats.
