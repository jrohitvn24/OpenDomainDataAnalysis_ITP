		<title>13THE VILLAGE CENTRE,OXSHOTT</title>
		<content> A little church was built in 1913     
 and in the 1950's a Village Centre was
 built on to the west end of the       
 church. There is a children's activity
 centre inside, a creche, playgroup and
 also a little theatre and canteen, so 
 it is a busy centre. Many local people
 take part in events.                  
 The{church}itself isn't very big, just
 a small place, very pretty, and quite 
 modern. Of course family services and 
 holy communions are all included. The 
 vicar helps out with the area and     
 takes all services.                   
 One big event of the year is the      
 Christmas fair in the Village Centre  
 in aid of nominated charities when    
 everyone takes part. Other            
 activities include: child health      
 centre, doctor's surgery, political   
 party meetings, county library and a  
 mothers' union.                       </content>
