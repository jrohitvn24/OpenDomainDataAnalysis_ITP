 The first houses were council built on
 farmland in the Blackwater Drive area 
 in 1974 by builders Greaves,other     
 developers include Wimpey.{The houses 
{are traditionally built,with few      
{bungalows,but the Community           
{Centre,Saxon Inn and Scout hut are    
{unusual buildings.}The newest homes   
 built in 1982,are on the old          
 Calmore Nursery site.On the estate,   
 fully developed except for            
 infilling.There are  about{1666 houses
{and 5000 people.}The estate is well   
 cared for,an attractive area.The      
 little vandalism is immediately       
 rectified by the{Local Authority.     
 There is only one shop,although a site
 was earmarked next to the {Community  
{Centre }for commercial development and
 there is now an interested developer.
