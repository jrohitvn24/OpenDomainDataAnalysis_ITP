 SOME GO BY CAR. MANY OF OUR OUR MUMS  
 ALSO WORK.FOURTEEN WORK PART TIME,NINE
 WORK FULL TIME.MANY OF OUR PARENTS ARE
 NOW AT WORK DURING THE DAY. WE NEED   
 TIME SAVING AND LABOUR SAVING         
 EQUIPMENT.IN OUR MODERN DAY AND AGE WE
 HEAR A LOT ABOUT MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY.
 WE HAVE MORE TECHNOLOGICAL  EQUIPMENT 
 IN OUR HOMES. WE USE THIS TO PROVIDE  
 ENTERTAINMENT FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPUTER
 AND TO SAVE TIME LIKE AN AUTOMATIC    
 WASHING MACHINE.WE HAVE THIS EQUIPMENT
 BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE MONEY. THIS MONEY
 IS PROVIDED BY OUR WORKING MUMS AND   
 DADS. IN OUR GRANDPARENTS' GENERATION 
 MANY OF THE WOMEN STAYED AT HOME TO   
 WORK. IN OUR GENERATION MORE OF OUR   
 PARENTS GO OUT TO WORK. SOME OF THE   
 EQUIPMENT WE HAVE IS A LUXURY BUT SOME
 IS A NECESSITY.                       </content>
