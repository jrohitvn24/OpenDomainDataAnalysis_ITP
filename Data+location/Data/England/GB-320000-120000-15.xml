		<content> Institute from which the following is 
 extracted..(copy held in Somerset     
 Local History Library in Taunton).    
 "..The name Trull is derived from the 
 Old English{TRENDEL},meaning a ring or
 circle...The roughly circular shape of
 the churchyard of All Saints Trull may
 be significant...The present parish   
 formed part of the huge estate given  
 by Aethelwulf,King of the West Saxons 
 to Ealhstan,Bishop of Winchester.The  
{Saxon charter}(A.D.854?)gives the     
 boundaries of this estate...Trull     
 church was probably originally built  
 to serve a different parish to the    
 modern area;and in fact the Trindle of
 the year 1207-1208 undoubtably        
 included the mill as well as the areas
 known as the tithings of North Trendle
 and Dipford..Trull is first mentioned 
 as a{parish}in 1534-5.."The 'Story of 
 Trull'has many excellent details.     </content>
