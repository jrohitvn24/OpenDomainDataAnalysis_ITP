 AT ONE TIME THE ONLY SHOP WAS A SMALL 
 ONE ON NORTH ROAD. IT WAS RUN BY A    
 LADY CALLED MISS HALL WHO SOLD TREACLE
 IN A BARREL OUTSIDE THE SHOP. MISS    
 HALL LATER BECAME A SCHOOL TEACHER AT 
 HOLME SCHOOL. THE FIRST CO_OPERATIVE  
 SHOP WAS SET UP BY MR ERNEST COLLINSON
 AND MR EVERARD PRILL WHO WENT TO      
 CARNFORTH TO SEE IF THEY COULD START A
 CO_OPERATIVE SHOP UP BECAUSE PEOPLE   
 WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE LACK OF    
 FACILTIES IN HOLME. LATER ON THERE WAS
 A TRAVELLING BAKER WHO CAME TO THE    
 VILLAGE. ON THE FIRST VISIT TO THE    
 VILLAGE ALL THE CHILDREN CAME OUT OF  
 SCHOOL AND THEY WERE ALL GIVEN A LOAF 
 OF BREAD TO TAKE HOME.THE CO_OP HAS   
 NOW CLOSED AND WE HAVE JUST GOT A     
 SPAR GROCERS,A POST OFFICE,A          
 HAIRDRESSERS AND A CYCLE SHOWROOM.
