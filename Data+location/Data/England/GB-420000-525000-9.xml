		<content> My name is Emma Giles and I am 10     
 years old. I live at 38 South Street  
 which is the largest house in our     
 street.I have a brother called Martin 
 who is 17 years old. My mother works  
 at the baker's shop in the town centre
 and my Dad works as a roofer. I go to 
 All Saints' School which is a Junior  
 Mixed and Infants School. On Monday   
 evenings I go to Drama group for 2    
 hours. We perform plays and also play 
 games such as musical statues. I am in
 a play called The Park Keeper playing 
 the part of a tramp! My favourite pop 
 singer at the moment is Paul Young. I 
 like to watch him on the VHS video    
 which we have at home. I like         
 collecting stickers and have over 300 
 on my bedroom door.I usually go       
 shopping with my mother on Saturday   
 mornings.I enjoy reading and borrow   
 books from the County library.        </content>
