		<title>13My Club-Cubs</title>
		<content> We meet at the Parish Hall Cleobury   
 Mortimer. To join you have to say a   
 promise which is,                     
 " I promise,                          
   That I will do my best,             
   To do my duty to God and the Queen, 
   To help other people and keep the   
   Cub Scout Law. "                    
 We wear a green jumper and cap which  
 is our uniform, and a red and yellow  
 necker which is for our pack only. The
 only rule is no fighting. Our pack    
 leader is known as Akela. We play     
 games like traffic lights, skittles,  
 cricket and football. We also have to 
 work for our proficiency badges such  
 as athlete, book reader or explorer.  
 We also go to camp in the summer. Each
 cub promises to obey the cub law "to  
 do his best, think of others before   
 himself and do a good deed every day".
