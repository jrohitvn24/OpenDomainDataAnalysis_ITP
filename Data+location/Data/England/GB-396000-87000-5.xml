		<title>05LONG ISLAND NEAR ARNE</title>
		<content>                                       
   Long Island lies to the East of the 
 Arne Peninsula and to the North of    
 Round Island to which it is linked by 
 a narrow spit of salt marsh. Long     
 Island is not populated.It is owned by
 Major Ryder of the Rempstone Estate.  
   The whole Island is very wild and   
 thus of scientific interest because it
 is so natural.The soil is sandy and as
 yet no fresh water has been           
 found,which is the main reason for    
 there being no inhabitants.The Island 
 is not part of the Nature Reserve but 
 the RSPB guard it because of its bird 
 colonies.                             
   The Island is not used for anything 
 specific but just leased out          
 occasionally for the use of camping or
 sailing clubs.This is unlike Round    
 Island which is private property and  
 to which the public have no access.   </content>
