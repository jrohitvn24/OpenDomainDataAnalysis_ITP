 During the Winter months we house the 
{dairy herd}in a Cubicle shed where we 
 have centre feeding facilities.They   
 are fed a mixture of silage and Barley
 nutrients.The cows are milked in a    
 Herring-bone parlour enabling twelve  
 cows in at one time.                  
{Our crops}are stored in various places
 around the farm.Silage is stored in an
 outside clamp supported by sleepers   
 slotted into girders.Straw and Hay is 
 kept under two Dutch barns,Grain is   
 stored on the loft floors and a grain 
 bin in one of the large sheds.Potatoes
 are mainly sold of the fields but are 
 sometimes stored in the large shed    
 where they can be protected from the  
 Frost by covering with bales of Straw.
 My work force comprises of myself,my  
 wife,a full-time worker and my two    
 sons,when they are not at school.     </content>
