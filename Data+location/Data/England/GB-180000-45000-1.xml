		<title>01General description of area</title>
		<content> The area is governed locally by       
{Carrick District Council,{Truro City  
{Council}and{Cornwall County Council.  
 There are also Parish Councils        
 involved in its administration, namely
 Kenwyn and St.Clement.                
                                       
 South of the block fringes on to the  
 northern part of the cathedral city of
{Truro.}In the N.W.there is the village
 of{Shortlanesend.                     
                                       
 The land is drained by two rivers,    
 from the north the{River Allen}and the
 west by the{River Kenwyn.}The two     
 rivers meet to the south forming the  
{Truro River,}which is tidal.          
 Eventually it flows into the River    
 Fal. The land is covered mainly by    
 farmland, mostly grazing although some
 fields are cultivated to the growing  
 of barley.                            </content>
