    Farming in this survey area is     
 mainly arable, and farm animals do not
 play a large part. There are no dairy 
 herds (just one house cow at Gallow   
 Hill farm). There are seven beef      
 cattle at Gallow Hill Farm. Westgate  
 Farm has 1000 pigs and Muckleton has  
 400. Sheep from nearby farms are      
 grazed at Muckleton in the summer     
 months. Gallow Hill Farm has twelve   
 chickens for domestic use and Westmead
 has two.                              
    Gallow Hill Farm has a Suffolk     
 Punch mare which is used on the farm  
 and which has won several prizes at   
 local shows. Muckleton Farm has four  
 racehorses and two ponies. The        
 racehorses are trained on the farm and
 have won many prizes at nearby        
 Fakenham racecourse                   </content>
