		<title>15MORE GAMES,WITHERNSEA</title>
		<content>  In Queenie,Queenie one person,with   
 his back to the rest of the players,  
 throws a ball over his shoulder.It is 
 caught or picked up by one of the     
 players,who hides it behind his back. 
 The players say the rhyme 'Queenie,   
 Queenie, who's got the ball;is he fat 
 or is he tall ?'The person with his   
 back to the players now turns and has 
 to guess who has the ball.If he is    
 right he stays as front person,       
 otherwise the person with the ball    
 takes over.                           
  In Block you have a base where one   
 player counts to 50 while the others  
 hide.The counter has to find the      
 others but when he sees one he has to 
 run back to base and count 1,2,3, also
 saying the name of the person seen. If
 this person gets back to base before  
 the finder then the finder has to     
 count again from the beginning.       </content>
