		<title>15TOURISM.</title>
		<content>{TOURISM}plays quite an important role 
 in our area,which is a short distance 
 from both the coast and Bodmin moor.  
 Tourists travel from all over Great   
 Britain,Europe,America and Canada to  
 N.Cornwall in a variety of ways eg.   
 car,bus,train,bicycle,hike etc. The   
 main attractions locally are:- the    
 beaches and all their amenities,the   
 moors,scenic walks and drives,fishing,
 golf and,perhaps most important of all
 -tranquility. Farms take in guests for
 bed and breakfast and many are open   
 all year.Small farm cottages and barns
 have been converted into holiday homes
 which are often only occupied for a   
 few months of the year.The only hotel 
 in our area also has a caravan and    
 camping site. Most visitors stay for  
 one or two weeks and often return to  
 the same accomodation year after year.
