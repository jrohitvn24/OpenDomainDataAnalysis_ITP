 on the ridge between the Goyt Valley  
 and Chapel-en-le-frith.It is easily   
 reached by road,the main drive leaving
 the A.5002 three miles north of       
 Buxton.                               
   Opened by Derbyshire Education

 wide range of courses for school      
 parties,students,teachers and private 
 individuals.Using a highly pressuried 
 National Park,White Hall has a        
 responsibility to ensure that those

 users,workers and recreationalists    
 alike.
