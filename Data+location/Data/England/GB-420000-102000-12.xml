		<content> In the week of June the 12th news came
 up in the Lymington Times, Western    
 Gazette and the Newforest Post.There  
 was a forest fire destruction which   
 swept across Setley Plain and         
 Latchmoor Hill on Monday 10th June    
 destroying 60 acres of forest land.   
 Trains were stopped for 30 mins until 
 firemen fought the flames.            
 Mrs Anne Powell was awarded a coveted 
 badge for the Red Cross.She lives in  
 Honey Lane and was a member of that   
 Society for over twenty years.She was 
 honoured with this badge on Wednesday 
 12th June.                            
 Sunday 9th June 1985 a car boot sale  
 was held at Burley Primary School.    
 Burley residents don't like to climb  
 the hill to the School for the county 
 council elections.The walk was too    
 much for the elderly people so some   
 did not vote. By Stephen.B and Chris.R</content>
