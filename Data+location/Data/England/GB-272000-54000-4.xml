		<title>04NEWS AROUND DIPTFORD</title>
		<content> The Parish Magazine is one of the     
 Information Services around Diptford  
 It contains local news.  There is a   
 childrens page and it tells you how to
 make things. It tells us when outings 
 are on and when things are happening. 
 The Vicar produces the Parish         
 Magazine. He is called Father Peter.  
 The School, the Post Office and the   
 Church are the places where people    
 meet to exchange news.  People        
 distribute the {Magazine} to all the  
 parishioners.  The public {Notice -   
{Boards}in the area of Diptford are at 
 the Post Office and at the school.Here
 notices of all events can be easily   
 seen. The school frequently notifies  
 parents and friends of all events     
 through printed{letters}sent home by  
 each child.
