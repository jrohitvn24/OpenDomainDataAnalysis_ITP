		<content> Most of the houses in the village are 
 owner occupied, apart from a small    
 council owned estate and a few houses 
 that are rented out which still belong
 to the old Estates. Most of the houses
 are old, stone built, though some have
 been rendered in recent years and     
 painted in pastel colours. There is a 
 small new development with a few      
 further houses currently being built  
 but little further building is planned
 for the village.                      
                                       
 The majority of the area consists     
 of very small hamlets each centred    
 around a farm. Several of the old     
 cottages and barns have been renovated
 and modernised by people who wish to  
 live in the country and can afford to 
 do so.
