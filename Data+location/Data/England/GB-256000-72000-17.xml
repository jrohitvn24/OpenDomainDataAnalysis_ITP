		<title>17Holiday Visitors</title>
		<content> Yesterday,15th July,our class went    
 into the village to do a survey among 
 the holiday visitors.Although it was  
 not a nice day there were lots of     
 visitors about. We asked them why they
 had come to Princetown.Nearly half had
 come to see the prison, a third to see
 the moors, a few to have lunch and one
 or two to see the church.We also asked
 people if they liked Princetown and   
 over half said yes, they liked it     
 because it is quiet, small and clean  
 and has a lovely view. The people who 
 didn't like Princetown said it was too
 cold or too isolated.Although they    
 didn't all like Princetown nearly     
 everybody liked the moors.They said   
 the moors were beautiful.We then      
 asked people if they would like to    
 live in Princetown.Some said yes but  
 most said no, they wouldn't because   
 the weather is so damp and cold.Cont'd</content>
