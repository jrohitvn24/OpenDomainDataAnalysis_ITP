		<content> I usually get up at half past seven   
 and then I get changed and go down to 
 breakfast which takes about 45 minutes
 and then I go and feed my rabbits.    
 Next I am off to clean my teeth and   
 then to go to school at about 8.45. At
 12.OO we go for lunch to the canteen  
 across the road.  After lunch when we 
 come back we will stay on for another 
 3 and a half hours at school and then 
 we go home. When I get home I have to 
 go and feed my rabbits and then get   
 changed and mess around and have some 
 tea then at about half past seven we  
 have supper. In the time between I    
 usually watch the television and watch
 through and after supper and I then go
 to bed at about half past 9.OO to     
 1O.OO.
