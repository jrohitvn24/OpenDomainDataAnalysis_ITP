		<content>{St.Michael's College financial reasons
{for closure. }Parents are generally   
 finding it more and more difficult to 
 find the money for Private Education, 
 especially for children under the  age
 of 13 years. The fees at closure of   
 the College were Â£1,100 per term for  
 boarders and Â£750 for day pupils and  
 all boarders, except four, received   
 bursaries and scholarships and it was 
 the lack of full fee paying pupils    
 which caused the closure.
