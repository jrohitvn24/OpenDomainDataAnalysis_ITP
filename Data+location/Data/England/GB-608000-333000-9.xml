		<title>09EDUCATION IN EDGEFIELD</title>
		<content> Long before the National Schools a    
 former Rector and his daughter ran a  
 school in the Rectory barn,but now the
 village no longer has its own school. 
 It closed about five years ago when   
 there were only 23 children: now there
 are a few more children of primary    
 school age but there is no chance of  
 re-opening the school as the building 
 was sold and the schoolyard is now    
 used for dog-kennels.                 
 School bus services take children to  
 the primary school in Holt, and the   
 secondary school in Sheringham. The   
 pre-school playgroup is well supported
 by Edgefield mothers but depends on   
 the availability of private cars. A   
 few of the older children go to       
 independent schools in Holt or Norwich
 or at 16+ to the Norwich City College:
 a private bus service is now supplying
 transport at suitable times.          </content>
