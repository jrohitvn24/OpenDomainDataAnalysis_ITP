		<content>From the very top of St. Michael's     
Church tower you can see some of       
the sights  of Stone  and Meaford.     
You can see Christ Church and St.      
John's Church.In the distance Meaford  
Power Station can be seen.St.Michael's 
Church dates back to the 7th century.At
that time it was called the Church     
of St.Mary &amp; St.Wulfad.It was changed  
to St.Michael's in 1758 but nobody     
knows why this was done.The original   
church was mentioned in the Domesday   
Survey in 1085.The Frank Jordan Centre 
used to be the old St.Michael's School 
before 1971.In 1971 St.Michael's C.E.  
Primary School was moved to the        
present  site in Weaver's Lane.The     
Frank Jordan Centre is used as a Sunday
School for St.Michael's Church and is  
also a community centre.The Sunday     
services are 8.00am, 10.30am &amp; 6.30pm. 
The Rector is Fr. Bill Spray.          </content>
