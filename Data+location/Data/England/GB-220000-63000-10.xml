		<content>   PROVISION FOR THE ELDERLY IS CENTRED
 ON DOBWALLS. THERE IS A BRANCH OF{AGE 
{CONCERN}WHICH PROVIDES A LUNCHEON CLUB
 ON THURSDAYS, WITH MEALS ON WHEELS FOR
 THE HOUSEBOUND. A CHIROPODY CLINIC IS 
 ALSO HELD THEN. THEY MEET IN THE      
 MEMORIAL HALL. MEALS ON WHEELS ARE    
 DELIVERED BY OTHER VOLUNTEERS ON THE  
 OTHER WEEKDAYS.                       
  A{GOOD COMPANIONS}CLUB MEETS ON      
 WEDNESDAYS FOR SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND A
{LADIES BRIGHT HOUR}FOR MORE RELIGIOUS 
 ONES,ON TUESDAYS.                     
  HEALTH PROVISION AND DAY CARE IS ALL 
 IN LISKEARD OR PLYMOUTH. LACK OF      
 TRANSPORT CAN THEREFORE BE A PROBLEM. 
 BOTH DOCTORS SURGERIES, THE DENTISTS  
 AND THE PHYSIOTHERAPIST ARE IN        
 LISKEARD,BUT ALL ARE GOOD AT ARRANGING
 HOME VISITS. ALTHOUGH SERVICES ARE    
 STRETCHED,PEOPLE ARE VERY AWARE OF THE
 NEEDS OF THE ELDERLY.                 </content>
