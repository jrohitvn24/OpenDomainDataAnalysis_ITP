		<title>05LOCAL HISTORY FAWKHAM 2</title>
		<content>A well known lovely Georgian manor     
dating back to l722 was the White House
near Fawkham Green and Speedgate Farm. 
Lying in a fold of the Kentish hills is
the old church of Fawkham built in ll00
to replace the old Saxon church.Built  
of rubble and wood in the mediaeval    
manner it is a beautiful church with an
octangonal spirelet of l5th century and
an ancient but solitary 400 year old   
bell.Also in the church there are some 
early l4th century stained glass       
windows-the west window and some       
monuments,tablets and brasses.It is a  
place of quiet beauty just two miles   
from the Rising Sun.Tales of a headless
solitary horseman and a nun wandering  
at midnight down the grassy paths add  
to the folklore and atmosphere of deep 
lonely antiquity.
