		<title>20Mortimers Provision for Aged</title>
		<content> Windmill Court is being built. It will
 be wardened, making provison for 16   
 heavily dependent residents, plus 37  
 sheltered residents. Heathfield will  
 continue to be an old people's home   
 (up-graded) although many will move   
 from there to Windmill Court. Mortimer
 House, formerly for blind,now also has
 sighted residents. It will be sold as 
 soon as Windmill Court is operative.  
 Glenapp Grange has just been converted
 to private flats for retired (Â£32,000 
 to Â£53,000). Burghfield Volunteer     
 Bureau (formed 1974) helps elderly    
 with hospital journeys, decorating,   
 shopping, etc. Mortimer Age Concern is
 active too in trying to meet the needs
 (mainly financial) of the elderly in  
 the village. Children from St. John's 
 regularly contact O.A.P.'s (especially
 those living alone) at times like     
 Christmas,Harvest Festival,and May Day</content>
