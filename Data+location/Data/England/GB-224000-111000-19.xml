		<title>19ALDERCOMBE FARM</title>
		<content>  Our farm house is one of the oldest  
 farm houses in Kilkhampton.It was     
 built in about 1595 but there were    
 probably other houses or buildings    
 before that time.In the past the farm 
 totalled 500 acres but now it is only 
 200 acres.Mrs thynne once owned the   
 the farm and used to let it to my     
 great-great uncle who then bought it. 
 In 1919 my great grandfather bought   
 the farm and it was then bought by my 
 grandfather.In 1936 the farm was split
 into parts leaving 200 acres at       
 Aldercombe.My father now rents it from
 grandfather.There used to be a        
 watermill down in the valley between  
 Aldercombe and Darracott which was    
 used by the villagers and farmers of  
 the parish
