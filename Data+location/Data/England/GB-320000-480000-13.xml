		<content>        The next certain fact about    
 Kirkby-in-Furness is as a manor       
 belonging to Furness Abbey-as did most
 parts of Furness.                     
        During the English Civil War,  
 such was the isolation of the Furness 
 Peninsula that it was not until the   
 war reached Lancaster that people from
 the area became involved. In 1643, a  
 Royalist army led by Lord Molyneux    
 plundered Furness,but then returned to
 Lancaster. This raid encouraged       
 Richard Kirkby,the eldest son of Roger
 Kirkby of Kirkby, to attempt to raise 
 a force in support of the King.       
 Although he seems to have had little  
 success, he was joined by a Royalist  
 regiment from Millom. They eventually 
 met a Parliamentary force at          
 Lindal-in-Furness, where they were    
 easily routed after one cavalry charge
 by the Roundheads.                    </content>
