		<content> Many of the people in our area work in
Stoke-on-Trent, Stafford or at the     
Stone Business Park.These people are   
employed in areas such as the pottery  
industry, tyre manufacture, glass      
making, coal mining, computers,        
education and medicine.(There are large
hospitals in Stafford and              
Stoke-on-Trent which is famous for     
the pottery industry.)                 
 In the area of land covered by our    
survey, employment is provided by      
G.E.C. Measurements who make           
instruments for electrical             
measurement, Doulton Industrial        
Products who make electrical           
insulators, the Trent Geriatric        
Hospital, shops, offices, hotels,      
schools, etc. Most land in the area is 
used for dairy farming and this gives  
employment to some of the people.
