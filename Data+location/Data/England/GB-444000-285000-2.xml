		<title>02WIBTOFT CHAPEL 1</title>
		<content> The proper name is The Chapel of the  
 Ascension of the Blessed Virgin Mary  
 (Church of England).                  
 First known to exist in 1004, Ulfic   
 spot gave it to another Viking        
 Athelric, in a will.                  
 Name of present vicar Rev. Haddelsy   
 The Chapel is in the diocese of       
 Leicester although it in Warwickshire,
 because, of the watershed. A stream in
 Wibtoft goes to the Humber via        
 rivers, other streams run into the    
 Bristol Channel. Toft is a            
 Scandinavian word. The Vikings went up
 river and stoped at Wibtoft. Wibtoft  
 is on the border of England and the   
 rest was Viking, (last village of old 
 England when it was divided between   
 England and Denmark).                 
 The population has not changed since  
 the first Doomsday Book, about 50.
