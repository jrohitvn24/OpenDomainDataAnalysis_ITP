		<content> Do you often use the park?            
 Well,I don't use it but when I take   
 the dog for a walk,we walk through the
 park and I watch the bowls or the     
 tennis.The kids can play on the       
 climbing frame.When I was small that  
 park wasn't there.The rec used to have
 swings in but there isn't any now.We  
 used to play but the swings got       
 vandalised and the council took them  
 out.                                  
 Do you like the surroundings around   
 your house?                           
 Well,I like where it is because it is 
 not too busy with traffic and the kids
 can play out and you're not worried   
 about them.It's pretty quiet.
