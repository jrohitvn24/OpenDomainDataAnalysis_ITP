		<title>19MORE CLUBS IN HENFIELD.</title>
		<content>            Gym Club by Cassie.        
   Gym Club is held on all different   
 nights.  It is held at the Village    
 Hall.  Everyone goes at different     
 times to suit their age and ability.  
 At Gym we work for different badges   
 4,3,2,1 and 0.  4 is the easiest and 0
 the hardest.  I have got my 4,3,2,1.  
 We also do floor work, beam work, bar 
 work and box work.  My favourite is   
 box work.  Now there is a Boys' Gym   
 Club.                                 
     Second Henfield Brownies by Amy.  
   Every Friday evening I go to        
 Brownies at the Guide Hut.  We play   
 games and work for badges.  In the    
 Summer holidays I went on Pack Camp.  
 Our theme was Carebears.  It was      
 great.  At Christmas our Brownies are 
 doing a play.  I am the vet.fire We   
 play ladders and firemen.I am working 
 for my Highway badge which is hard.   </content>
