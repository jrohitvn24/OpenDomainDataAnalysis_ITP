		<content> The old school which was built in 1830
 is constructed of stone with a slate  
 roof and has a wooden belfry where the
 school bell used to ring.Mr and Mrs   
 Vaughan use to teach there. The two   
 classrooms were separated by a        
 partition and were heated by open     
 fires. Another feature in the village 
 is the church.The church is called St 
 Mary and St Peter.The church which was
 built a long time ago,is used for
