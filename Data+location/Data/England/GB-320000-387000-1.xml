		<content>   This area has seen great changes in 
 lifestyles over the past 100 years.   
 The small{fishing}communities have    
 been affected by the silting up of the
 coast. All that remains of the fishing
 industry today is small scale         
 'cockling' and about 20 boats engaged 
 in part time, seasonal fishing.  Much 
 of the surrounding farm land has been 
 built over.                           
                                       
   The construction of the railway from
{Liverpool}stimulated the building of  
 large Victorian residences, many of   
 which are now converted to flats,     
 nursing homes and private schools.    
 The{seaside holiday}trade of the first
 half of the 20th. century has now     
 declined, and today is based mainly on
 day excursions.
