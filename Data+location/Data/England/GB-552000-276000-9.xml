		<content> Before the area was drained in the    
 seventeenth century movement in and   
 around the area was very difficult.   
 The landscape was marshy and difficult
 to move through, the main methods of  
 transportation were either by flat    
 bottomed boat or by horseback along   
 known shallower regions. The area was 
 isolated (part of the reason why the  
 monastry was established at nearby Ely
 1 mile away). A raised causeway was   
 built from Stuntney to Ely and the    
 main A142 follows the route of it     
 today. The railway passes through the 
 area as does the main A10(T) road. The
 general communications network is     
 adequate but there are areas not well 
 served by roads. One result of the    
 shrinking of the land is that the     
 river, roads and railways are all to  
 be found higher than the land, a      
 typical fen feature.                  </content>
