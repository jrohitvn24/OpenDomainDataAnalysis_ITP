		<content>  Many of the clubs and activities in  
 Hallaton are associated with the      
 Church. There is a fortnightly{Sunday 
{School.}Guides meet every Friday in   
 the Church Hut. On Monday mornings,   
 people gather for the{"Coffee Set"}for
 a chat or to listen to a talk at the  
 Rectory. On Wednesday afternoons, also
 at the Rectory, a{mothers and toddlers
{group}meets. In 1984 the Church       
{Bellringing Association}was revived   
 (there are six bells in the church).  
 An enthusiastic band of about 12      
 locals ring for Sunday services and a 
 midweek practice. The group also rings
 the eight handbells belonging to the  
 Church. Fortnightly on Thursday       
 afternoons the{Evergreen Club}for     
 pensioners meets at the Stenning Hall 
 for tea, bingo and whist. The club    
 also goes on many outings in the      
 Summer.                               </content>
