		<content> Offas Dyke the great earthworks       
 erected by King Offa in the 8th       
 Century stretches across this block.  
 Here is to be found one of the best   
 stretches of the whole 168 miles      
 length.  It may have been erected as a
 form of defence against the Welsh, or 
 what seems more probable in the light 
 of modern thinking, as a line of      
 de-markation in agreement with the    
 Welsh.                                
 It is now a long distance path        
 stretching from Chepstow to Prestatyn 
 used by many walkers.  This section of
 the Dyke has some of the most         
 spectacular views across the bare     
 grassy hills and fertile valleys with 
 probably the best preserved section of
 the whole Dyke.  The area is ideal for
 walking.
