		<title>07Old residents in Oakley</title>
		<content>Most of the old people have lived in   
Oakley all their lives.During this time
Oakley has got bigger.There was always 
a school but previously in School      
Lane.During the war no houses were     
bombed,but everybody had to carry a    
gas mask. The village hall was known as
the library and  was used for socials  
by the Oakley Brass Band,which no      
longer exists.Dances were held         
frequently.Nowadays the village hall is
situated in the  playing field and used
for the Darby and Joan club. The       
elderly have memories of the Doctor    
jogging  round to his patients !The    
old people miss the shops that used    
to be in Oakley in particular the sweet
shop,grocers,general store and         
bakers - now combined into a P.O.and a 
separate  supermarket.
