		<title>01The block-a brief outline.</title>
		<content> The block covers an area which is     
 predominantly arable farmland with a  
 significant amount of managed grazing 
 and paddocks,part of the studs which  
 surround nearby Newmarket.Most of the 
 land is owned by the Duke of          
 Sutherland.                           
  There are three villages in the      
 block;Stetchworth,Woodditton and Saxon
 Street.Although their postal address  
 is Newmarket Suffolk,they are,in      
 fact,in Cambridgeshire.               
  Stetchworth serves as a focal point  
 since it has a Primary School,Old     
 Peoples' Sheltered Housing and a      
 recently built multi-purpose          
 centre,known as the Ellesmere Centre, 
 containing sports facilities,community
 shop and rooms set aside for use as   
 Doctor's surgery and other health     
 care.The centre was built to serve the
 needs of the six surrounding parishes.</content>
