		<title>20Traffic in Carlton</title>
		<content> Although Carlton is only a small      
 village, an incredible amount of      
 traffic uses the main road every day, 
 going to-and-from the M62.            
 On average aproximately  364 vehicles 
 pass through the village every hour.  
 Starting from 572 between 8.OO a.m.and
 9.OO a.m., and falling to 47O between 
 5.OO p.m. and 6.OO pp.m.              
 The majority of the vehicles are cars,
 although vans and lorries come next on
 the list. This shows that a lot of    
 commercial vehicles pass through the  
 village.                              
 There will come a time probably in the
 near future, when Carlton will need a 
 by-pass.
