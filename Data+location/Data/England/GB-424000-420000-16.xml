		<title>16EMPLOYMENT IN DEWSBURY</title>
		<content> A study of employment was completed   
 based on data retrieved from a sample 
 of some 280 adults within the area.   
 Within the sample the figure for those
 without full time employment(male and 
 female between the ages of 16-65)     
 averaged 32% athough this varied      
 greatly from 17% in some areas to up  
 to almost 60% in others.              
 Of those employed full time(about 40  
 hours a week) over 80% had jobs       
 locally and a further 10% within 15   
 miles of the area.16% of the adults in
 the study were employed on a part time
 (less than 30 hours per week)basis. 5%
 of those in full time employment held 
 professional positions while the other
 main areas of employment included     
 textiles 24%, retail 16%, engineering 
 (including motor trade) 13%, building 
 and related industries 12%, public    
 services 10%.                         </content>
