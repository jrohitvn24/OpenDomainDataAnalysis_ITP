		<title>16Beckenham Place Park</title>
		<content> Beckenham Place was one of the private
 homes of the Cator family. It was     
 built in the eighteenth century on a  
 site where a Tudor farm may once have 
 stood. Peter Cator, who was the last  
 of the family to live, there died in  
 1873.He built many of the roads of the
 Cator Estate in Beckenham eg The      
 Knoll. Dr. Samuel Johnson planted     
 trees in the garden, and Coleridge is 
 supposed to have written "the Ancient 
 Mariner" under a magnificent tulip    
 tree there.                           
   It became a school in 1893 and one  
 of its early pupils  was one of the   
 first women to enter Oxford           
 University.                           
  A local girls' comprehensive school, 
 Cator Park, is named after the family.
 This school, which was then known as  
 Balgowan Senior School, was used as a 
 hospital during both World Wars.      </content>
