		<title>07CRANLEIGH VILLAGE HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>   The villagers of Cranleigh have just
 'saved' their hospital from closure   
 for the second time in ten years.     
   In 1859 the village surgeon decided 
 that a journey by rough cart to the   
 nearest hospital was often fatal and  
 thanks to the generosity of the Rector
 was able to establish the first       
 cottage hospital in England.          
   Now after extentions in 1922, 1930  
 and 1982, mainly paid for by local    
 people, it has about 24 patients,     
 mainy post_operative or elderly. The  
 patients are visited daily by doctors 
 of the Cranleigh Health Centre and    
 specialists visit to see outpatients. 
   The new extention houses a day      
 centre for elderly who are brought in 
 by ambulance.  They receive physio_   
 therapy, chiropody, occupational      
 therapy and general care while being  
 able to live at home.                 </content>
