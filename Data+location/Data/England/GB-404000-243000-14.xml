		<title>14BENGEWORTH CHURCH</title>
		<content> Everybody in Bengeworth is used to    
 seeing the tall church spire with its 
 clock telling us the time.  Mr. Banks,
 our vicar, is a busy man.  On Sundays 
 there are two Holy Communion services 
 in the morning and Evensong at half   
 past six.  During the week there is   
 one Communion Service.  Anyone can go 
 into the church at any time as it is  
 always kept open.  Besides taking     
 services the vicar visits people in   
 hospital and in their homes, prepares 
 for the Sunday services and goes to   
 all meetings in the parish.  On       
 Saturday mornings there is a Saturday 
 Club for under tens.  They sing songs,
 learn about Jesus, paint pictures and 
 make collages which are hung in the   
 church.  Those over ten go to the     
 Saturday Spectacular,although there   
 are only half a dozen members at the  
 present time.                         </content>
