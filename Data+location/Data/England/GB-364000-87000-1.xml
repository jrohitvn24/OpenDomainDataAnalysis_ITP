		<content>   The area covered by the grid        
 reference 03640087 is largely         
 agricultural land. It has only one    
 settlement of significance- the       
 village of Martinstown, the population
 of which is increasing due to housing 
 developments over the last six years. 
 The village is a linear one, following
 the South Winterborne and the B3159   
 for approximatley 1 kilometre West to 
 East.                                 
   The other important aspect of the   
 area is Maiden Castle, a large Iron   
 Age hill fort, whose future role at   
 the time of writing is very much in   
 the balance. More information may be  
 found by consulting the English       
 Heritage Commission.The main A354 road
 from Dorchester to Weymouth passes    
 through the bottom Eastern corner of  
 the area close to Winterborne Monkton
