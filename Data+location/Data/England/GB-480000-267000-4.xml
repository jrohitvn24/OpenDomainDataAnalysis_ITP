		<content>At school, we carried out a survey on  
where parents work and how they get    
there. We found that most fathers (15) 
work in Northampton, 4 work in         
Sywell near the aerodrome and 1 is a   
farmer. Three travel to Moulton Park,  
2 to Wellingborough and 1 to           
Kettering. One father commutes to      
London daily. Four are unemployed.     
Twenty-two dads travel by car, 3 cycle 
and 2 walk. Out of 33 mums, 14 do not  
go out to work, 7 work in the village, 
6 work at Moulton Park, 4 in           
Northampton and 2 at Overstone. Two    
walk to work, 3 cycle and the rest go  
by car. Nobody uses the bus service.   
Very few families are without a car.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
