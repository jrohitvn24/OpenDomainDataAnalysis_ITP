		<content> When we went to Stubhampton Bottom we 
 walked through two areas,Well Bottom  
 and Washers Pit. We saw lots of       
 flowers,trees,wild plants,insects and 
 birds.We also saw some squirrels and  
 rabbits.In Washers Pit we saw clear   
 tracks of deer prints and fox prints  
 but we did not see the actual animals.
 We saw some Oak trees,Hazel trees,    
 Beech trees,Deadly Nightshade and     
 Broom.There were birds happily singing
 in the trees and bushes,flying from   
 bough to bough.In Washers Pit the     
 trees look so nice surrounded by green
 plants and colourful flowers.At Well  
 Bottom the trees were overgrown in    
 places and it was difficult to walk.  
 In a clearing there was a wooden      
 look-out tower for seeing fires.
