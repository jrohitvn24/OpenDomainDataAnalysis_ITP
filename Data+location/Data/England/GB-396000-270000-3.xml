		<title>03A DAY IN MY LIFE PART 2</title>
		<content> tightrope walker when I grow up. It   
 will be very good practice for me. On 
 rainy days I carry an umbrella to keep
 my balance and also to keep the rain  
 off me. After church I go with my mum 
 and sister to the sweet shop 150 yards
 away from us. I have a 10p mix bag and
 so does Laura, my little sister. Then 
 we go home. I eat my mix bag at home  
 but Laura eats hers on the way back to
 our house. When we get home I go      
 upstairs to eat my mix bag while      
 Laurs, who has already eaten hers,    
 wails at mum for Superman on the      
 television. When I have finished my   
 mix bag, I go downstairs. I never walk
 downstairs. I slide down head first. I
 do it because its more fun than       
 ordinary walking downstairs. Then I   
 walk into the lounge and watch        
 Superman which I must have seen about 
 a billion times.                      </content>
