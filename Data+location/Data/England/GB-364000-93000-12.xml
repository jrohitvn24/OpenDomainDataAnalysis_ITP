		<title>12Media in Stratton</title>
		<content> Every house in Stratton has television
 and radio.  There is a delivery of    
 morning and evening papers. These are 
 concerned with world events rather    
 than local news.  Children especially 
 if isolated turn to television and    
 some in the village seem to spend up  
 to six hours a night  viewing.  2CR   
 local radio from Bournemouth can be   
 heard with difficulty.  Several       
 Citizens Band devotees are known -    
 these are attempts to break down the  
 remoteness of world news. Every house 
 also gets a copy of the Chalkstream,  
 the magazine covering the four        
 parishes.  Local events are thus      
 advertised. Use of videos and         
 computers is now widespread, though   
 their communication advantages have   
 not been realised yet.  There are     
 telephones in most houses, and a      
 public call box by the pub.           </content>
