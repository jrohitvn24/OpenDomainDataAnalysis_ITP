		<content> Square mellow red brick Victorian     
 houses nestle behind clipped hedges   
 next to strawberry pink or buff       
 Suffolk-washed cottages, their        
 thatched rooves capped with ornamental
 ridges. Small but stately Georgian    
 houses stand in their rose-filled     
 gardens across the foad from even     
 older yellow-washed flat faced        
 farmhouses with dormer windows in     
 their steep tiled rooved. 17th century
 pargetting recalls the wealth of      
 former years and brick and flint walls
 enclose neat gardens borders and      
 manicured lawns. Low whitewashed      
 cottages, upper windows peeping out   
 beneath eyebrows of thatch stand in   
 line with sturdy brick gabled estate  
 houses, bearing the date 1901 and the 
 cipher of the owner WHS. Several of   
 the houses are an unusual blue wash, a
 plough decorates a garden in one road.</content>
