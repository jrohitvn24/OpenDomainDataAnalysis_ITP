		<content> There is a wide variety of equipment  
in the homes in the area. The piece of 
equipment that most people want next   
was a micro-wave oven. The most used   
items were electric cookers, kettles   
and washing machines. Nearly every     
family owns a television,usually       
coloured. People prefer News and       
Current Affairs programmes, selecting  
from all channels. Not all households  
own radios. Music and The World at One 
were the most popular programmes. Most 
people listen at home, only a few      
listen at work.                        
 Cats and dogs, the most common pets,  
are kept mostly for company. The number
of horses and ponies is significant.   
 About half the people questioned said 
they went to Church only on special    
occasions. A quarter went frequently   
and usually locally. The rest never    
went to Church at all.                 </content>
