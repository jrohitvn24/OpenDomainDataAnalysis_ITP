tells people what you are.A Cub's motto
is"Be prepared" which means keep alert.
A cub is honest, thinks of others      
before himself &amp; never tells lies.He   
tries to do his duty to God &amp; to the   
Queen &amp; to help others to keep the Cub 
Scout Law &amp; attend regularly.Cubs play 
games, do work &amp; make things. When he  
gets his Link Badge he can join Scouts.
He has to work hard to become a Sixer  
or Seconder &amp; to get badges(G.Reddick).

follow Christ". We wear a hat,tie,     
white shirt, white knee socks, tunic,

like school but a little bit different.
