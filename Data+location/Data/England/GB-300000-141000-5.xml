		<title>05BINHAM MANOR FARM</title>
		<content> Binham farm is a good example of a    
 typical farm in this area.  It is 424 
 acres (171 hectares) in size and is   
 given over entirely to breeding for   
 milk production.  The farm has 240    
 cows in milk, all the fields being    
 used for forrage feed and winter feed 
 for the cows.  The entire area of farm
 land is given over to grass.  Nitrogen
 and potash are used on the land to    
 improve grass production and most of  
 the grass is put to sileage for winter
 feed.  Due to milk quotas from the    
 EEC, The farm produces 10% less milk  
 than l983 and they have to take great 
 care not to overproduce milk.         
 Therefore the farm is working on      
 breeds that produce less milk while   
 using the land to its full potential.
