		<content>{King's Worthy and Springvale}are two  
{villages}that have become merged into 
 one by the building of housing estates
 amongst them. The area contains some  
 interesting features including a      
 Norman church, a Saxon church which is
 in the same living but situated just  
 on the border of this area, an old    
 public house, once a coaching inn,    
 many old houses, a disused railway    
 line, a modern motorway and most of   
 the facilities required for life      
 today. On the edge of the area lie the
{villages}of{Easton and Martyr Worthy  
 along the banks of the Itchen. These  
 are residential and are linked to the 
 rest by farmland.
