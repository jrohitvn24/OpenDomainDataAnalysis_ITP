     From Maidstone East to Borough    
 Green the whole{railway journey}takes 
 about 20 minutes and it takes about 5 
 minutes to get to Barming.            
    The train is divided up into       
 first-class compartments at the front 
 of the train and the second class at  
 the rear - these are split up into    
 smoking and non-smoking.              
    The journey really begins after    
 passing over the River Medway. You    
 pass the Maidstone Industrial Centre  
 and later on you pass the path leading
 to St.Simon Stock School. You can also
 see houses and fields with cattle and 
 horses in.
