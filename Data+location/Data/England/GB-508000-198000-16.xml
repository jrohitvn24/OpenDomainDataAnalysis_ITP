		<title>16Life in Watford Mrs Richards</title>
		<content>We interviewed Mrs. Richards who is a  
local inhabitant.  She works in        
Holy Rood School. She has lived in this
area for nearly 18 years and she is our
School Secretary. Mrs Richards told us 
it is a busy but friendly area. All our
houses were built at the same time 18  
years ago and the people all moved in  
at the same time.  Local shops cover   
most needs but people go to Watford for
their main shopping. There are no      
leisure facilities near to Holy Rood   
School so people go to the Watford     
Leisure Centre at  Woodside. The M25   
has brought more traffic to this area  
but the residents are not bothered     
about the noise. Mrs Richards          
said,"This is a good place to live,    
friendly and not too near the main     
town."
