		<title>16Questionaire on Brereton.</title>
		<content> As a class, we decided that the best  
 way of finding out facts about        
 Brereton, was to deliver a            
 Questionaire to each household.We del-
 ivered approximately 130 leaflets and 
 we had 60 returned, so we felt that   
 the replies would reflect the thoughts
 of the majority of the local populace.
  The first question we asked was:     
{How many people are resident in your  
{house?}The total from the returned    
 forms was 180 people. We estimated    
 therefore that there are approximately
 360 people living in the area.        
  The second question was also to do   
 with population asking{:How long had  
{the family lived in the area.}We have 
 put the results into a chart,which we 
 felt were quite interesting.They show 
 that some people have lived here for  
 all their lives,and at least half of  
 them have lived here for over 10years.</content>
