		<content>{ Seaview}has a short{esplanade}with   
 many seats facing the English Channel.
 At the north end is{Seaview Yacht Club
 at the south end, a public slipway.   
 The upper shore is a platform of      
 eroded{Bembridge Limestone.}From      
 Seaview southwards the coast forms two
{sandy bays.}From the esplanade is a   
 short footpath that ends abruptly.    
 Because of difficulty of access{      
{Seagrove Bay}is mainly used by local  
 residents. In this bay, behind an area
 of broken sea wall, are wooden pillars
 and cables - the remains of{Seaview}  
{Suspension Pier}destroyed by storm in 
 1951. Nearby is the{Old Boathouse}    
 dated 1557. Many houses along this bay
 have collapsed due to{subsidence}     
 caused by{gault clay}known locally as 
 Blue Slipper.{ Priory Bay}is bordered 
 by woodland sheltering{The Priory,}an 
 hotel on the site of a{Norman Abbey.} </content>
