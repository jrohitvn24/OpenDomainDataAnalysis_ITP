		<title>01 Introduction To The Area</title>
		<content>  The area of land we have surveyed is 
a rural area around Weethley and Arrow 
in Warwickshire,bordering              
Worcestershire.                        
  Our project looks at many different  
aspects such as land use, tourist      
attractions and old historical places. 
We have conducted interviews with      
people connected with Ragley Hall near 
Alcester as a main tourist attraction  
and have a report on the architecture. 
Also included is an account of "a day  
in the life of" a family from Weethley.
We include a survey of housing types in
the area and a survey of animal and    
bird life.                             
  There is a custom of Morris Dancing  
in Weethley which is an annual event   
and we have a report on that.We also   
include other interviews with local    
people to discover in more depth social
and economic aspects of the area.      </content>
