		<title>13ENTERTAINMENT IN SLOUGH</title>
		<content>     Slough hasn't got a very big      
 entertainment scene.  The main source 
 for this is the Fulcrum Centre. This  
 is in the town centre and it houses   
 all kinds of activities such as plays,
 concerts and even sports like darts &amp; 
 wrestling which have appeared on TV.  
 The Fulcrum is under threat of closure
 from the council and judging by the   
 public reaction they do not seem too  
 bothered.                             
     The cinema is the other amusement 
 in Slough.  There are two cinemas and 
 the films that have the biggest       
 audiences are usually kept on for a   
 few weeks until their popularity dies.
     From our survey we found that     
 Slough's people don't really want any 
 more entertainment centres, but I     
 think there should be more for the    
 young, such as pop concerts with big  
 stars.                                </content>
