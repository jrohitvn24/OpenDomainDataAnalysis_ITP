		<title>05Quemerford Gate Farm</title>
		<content> My family, the Candys, have lived in  
{Quemerford Gate Farm}for ten years. We
 farm 40 acres of pasture land some of 
 which is cut for silage.              
                                       
 We raise 160{Hereford Cross beef      
{cattle,}have 40{hens}and 7{pigs.}The  
 pigs will soon be sent for slaughter. 
 Steers and heifers cost between Â£320  
 and Â£420 each.                        
                                       
 My father has 3 men working for him on
 the farm. We have four tractors, a    
 combine harvester, 2 ploughs, 2       
 rollers, a muck spreader and several  
 other implements. A new "John Deere"  
 tractor costs about Â£22000.           
                                       
 I like living on a farm because I like
 helping with the cattle, driving      
 tractors and having lots of space to  
 play in.                              </content>
