		<title>19HOW RESIDENTS SEE DENHOLME</title>
		<content> Many Denholme families have lived here
 through several generations for up to 
 2OO years.  They have seen{Denholme   
 change from being a{busy mill town}to 
{a functional village}with the decline 
 of the woollen industry, resulting in 
 derelict buildings and passing of the 
 railway, bank, cinema, cafe,          
 launderette, park band concerts.  The 
{change of local government}to Bradford
 Metropolitan D.C. in l974 still       
 disturbs many residents, feeling they 
 are paying{rates}for facilities out of
 their reach. But hobbies being mainly 
 home-based, old and young alike are   
 drawn to living here for its proximity
 to the{moors and countryside,}the     
 interesting and varied walks, the     
 sport and sailing facilities, the     
 park, the{friendly village atmosphere,
 and the happy, excellent First Schools
 and Nursery.                          </content>
