ST JAMES - Akeley was built in 1854 to 
replace the old thatched building and  
demolished as unsafe in 1981.  A foun- 
dation stone inscribed To the memory  
of William, son of Dr Smythe, 1691' was
found indicating an earlier building on
site.  Fossilised cockles and ammomites
found in the churchyard suggest area   
was once sea.  Services are held in    
church school but few attend, many are 
embittered by the loss of their church.
This church is 1 of 5 forming the North
Buckingham Parish, administered from   
Maids Moreton, so service times vary.  
                                       
AKELEY METHODIST - Services are held   
every Sunday in their own hall, also a 
Sunday School for youngsters.  Poor    
attendance threatens the future as well
as condition of building.
