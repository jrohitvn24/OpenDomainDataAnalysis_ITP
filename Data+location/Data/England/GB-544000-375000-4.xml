 Grammar, a Secondary Modern and a     
 Primary. The grammar school was built 
 in 1566. The headmaster is{Mr R.      
{Rundle.}It has 384 pupils, 23         
 teachers, 30 pupils in a class and 55 
 - 65 pupils in a year. Before the     
 grammar school was here it was in the 
 porch of{St. Wilfrids}church in       
 Alford. The children come from Alford 
 and the villages all around like      
 Mablethorpe, Sutton and other places. 
 They get into Alford by bus, car,     
 bicycle and some walk. There are 74   
 children in the sixth form. Everyone  
 in the fifth year takes O-levels each 
 year and nearly everyone in the upper 
 sixth takes A-levels each year. The   
 school has several benefactors,  three
 of whose names were taken and used for
 the sports houses,{Spanning, Cecil and
{Travers.                              </content>
