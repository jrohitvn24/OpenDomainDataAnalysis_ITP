		<content> The parish church of St.James stands  
 on high ground,a little way out of the
 village to the north,but near the     
 middle of the parish.                 
     The church,of architectural       
 interest,is built of local sandstone  
 rubble.The chancel dates from the     
 first half of the twelth century,as   
 does the base of the nave walls.The   
 nave was rebuilt in the second half of
 thirteenth century in early English   
 style,at the same time as the south   
 chapel and the solid west tower.This  
 is capped by an 80 ft wood shingled   
 broach spire,which is a considerable  
 local landmark.                       
    The tower contains six bells,the   
 oldest of which is pre_Reformation,   
 and still calls the parishioners to   
 church every Sunday as it has done for
 the last five hundred years.
