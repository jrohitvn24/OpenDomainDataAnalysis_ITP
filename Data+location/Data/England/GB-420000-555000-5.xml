		<title>05THE CAUSEY AND CAUSEY ARCH</title>
		<content>{THE CAUSEY}is a beautiful wooded area 
 in County Durham,2km N.E.of Tanfield  
 and 4km N of Stanley.It is a popular  
 picnic area owned by the National     
 Trust.It derives its name from an     
 elevated Roman road.                  
{THE CAUSEY ARCH}was built of stone in 
 1725/6 at the cost of Â£12,000,to carry
 coalwaggons across the ravine,from the
 Tanfield coalmines to the River Tyne. 
 Designed and built by Ralph Mason,at  
 the request of the local mineowners   
 known as the "GRAND ALLIES",the bridge
 has a span of 32m and is 34m high.    
 Fearing the bridge might collapse     
 Mason committed suicide by jumping    
 from the completed Arch.              
  This oldest surviving railway viaduct
 in the world has recently been        
 restored by Durham County Council.    
 A wooden waggon and track have been   
 added as it would have been in 1760.  </content>
