		<title>16The clipping at Tarset hall</title>
		<content> Tarset hall and Knoppingsholme are    
 both farmed by the Moore family.  The 
 labour force consists of 3 full-time  
 men and 1 casual worker who was there 
 for the clipping.  It was warm and    
 sunny.  The ewes-160 from Tarset hall 
 and 80 off K'holme- had been gathered 
 early and at 11am, clipping was well  
 under way.  There was a great bleating
 of ewes and lambs.  The wool is packed
 on the farm into huge wool sheets and 
 sent to a wool merchant at Hexham.    
 The Swaledale ewes are crossed with a 
 Hexham Leicester tip to produce Mule  
 lambs.  These ewes are good mothers   
 and thrive well both at home and on   
 the out-bye land at Sandy Sike.
