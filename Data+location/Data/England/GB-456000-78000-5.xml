		<title>05The Landslip-the GEOLOGY</title>
		<content> Starting from{Shanklin Chine}the cliff
 is made up of porous sandstone and    
 impervious rock.At the top is porous  
 rock and a hard bed of impervous      
 rock.The porous rock lets water       
 pass through and  impervious doesn't  
 let water pass through. When          
 it is quite windy the sand blows into 
 the air and hits the cliff and it     
 knocks off another bit of sand.Just   
 before{Horse Ledge}there was a bit    
 of cliff had got wet and it had fallen
 off and made a cone and there are many
 fossils to be found here.To the south 
 at{Luccombe Bay}there is a cliff that 
 had slipped and got wet and there is a
 mud flow now.At{Luccombe Chine}is a   
 path that leads to{the Landslip},which
 is an area of rotational slip.It is a 
 very interesting place to visit.
