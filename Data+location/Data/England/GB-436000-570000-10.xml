		<content>The main crime in our area is theft of 
and from vehicles.This is because of   
all the tourists.The Whitley Bay crime 
rate is average but is slowly          
increasing.This is happening all over  
Britain.                               
The high pay and security against      
unemployment are the good things about 
policing.The job is also interesting   
and rewarding.                         
The worst things about policing are the
unsociable working hours,the fact that 
they must work under stress and the    
heavy amount of paperwork.             
Policing isn't as glamorous as some    
people think.                          
The main highlight of the job is       
getting promoted.
