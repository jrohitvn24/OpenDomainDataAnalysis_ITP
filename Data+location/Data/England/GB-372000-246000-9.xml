		<content> This is an account of a day in his    
 life.He belongs to a{PROBUS}Club.This 
 means Professional and Businessmen's  
 club.There are altogether forty       
 members in this club.Before going to  
 this club he went to the library.He   
 said that reading was important in his
 retirement.At the club a fireman came 
 to tell them about safety in homes.   
 Then the fireman gave an extinguisher 
 to a man to have a go with.It was very
 funny because the man got foam        
 everywhere.He went home for lunch     
 which consisted of a pork pie.He has  
 only simple meals now that he has     
 retired.At about 4p.m.he went to      
 collect his wife from school.At       
 7.15p.m.he went to a Parish Council   
 meeting.He was back by 9.30p.m.This   
 was the end of a normal day in his    
 life during retirement.
