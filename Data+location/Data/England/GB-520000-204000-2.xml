		<title>02Swallow Holes at Waterend</title>
		<content>                                       
 Footpaths North East from{Waterend   }
 follow the line of the{Mimshall Brook,
 along which there are a number of     
{swallow holes.}A swallow hole is a    
 bowl-shaped depression where surface  
 water drains away, acting a bit like a
 plug hole in a bath or sink. During   
 dry, rainless periods the swallow     
 holes resemble small depressions;     
 when the rain comes the water         
 gradually drains away through the     
 holes.In times of excessive rain, the 
 swallow holes may not be able to cope 
 with the flow immediately and a small 
 lake may develop round about.The water
 will eventually drain away. The       
 Mimshall Brook actually disappears    
 under-ground at Waterend and it has   
 been shown that it flows North        
 under-ground and joins the{River Lea }
 at{Broxbourne.  }                     </content>
