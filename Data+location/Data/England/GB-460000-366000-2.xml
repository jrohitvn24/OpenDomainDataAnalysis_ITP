		<content>     90% of the Edwinstowe area is{    
{Bunter Sandstone}which is a bright    
 orange sand deposited in desert       
 conditions in{Permo-Triassic}times. In
 the valley of the {River Maun}is{Older
{Alluvium}and in the South-East corner 
 a Drift Deposit of{Glacial Sand and   
{Gravel.}The soils are weathered       
 sandstones of poor quality. During    
 dry,windy weather there are often     
 serious{dust-storms}causing damage to 
 crops and traffic hazards.            
     The soil is low in fertility and  
 drains rapidly so the most common crop
{potatos}have to be {irrigated.}This is
 why much of the land is once again {  
{Forest}but this time{commercial pine  
{forest.}The natural vegetation is     
{Climax Oak Forest,Birchwoods and Open 
{Heathland.}Collieries have lowered the
 water table which has resulted in the 
 death of many oak trees.              </content>
