		<title>06Pop Music</title>
		<content> Most young people like pop music but  
 parents often complain about what     
 their children listen to. It is the   
 fashion these days to walk about the  
 street with a large portable stereo   
 cassette player. More often than not  
 the volume is at full blast and that  
 annoys quite a lot of adults. Although
 many people criticize pop artists for 
 various reasons recently many         
 musicians have helped raise a great   
 deal of money for charity. In London a
 concert has been held to raise cash   
 for famine relief in Africa. Millions 
 of pounds have been given in by the   
 public. Most people in this area      
 watched at least part of this concert 
 on T.V. There are no record shops in  
 Winterbourne the nearest one being    
 several miles away. When local people 
 want to see live pop music they have  
 to go to the Colston Hall in Bristol. </content>
