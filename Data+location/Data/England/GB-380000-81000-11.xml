		<content> Apart from the Army Camp (see Armed   
 Forces) the homes are isolated one    
 from another and from shops. This     
 results in households becoming either 
 self-sufficient as much as possible,  
 or totally dependant on travelling to 
 major population centres such as      
 Bournemouth, Poole, Wareham and       
 Dorchester for their needs.           
 With no pressure on land use, large   
 gardens are used to grow vegetables   
 and keep chickens. Electricity and    
 mains water are available to all      
 homes.                                
 Television is the only source of      
 entertainment available within the    
 block which is not self-created.      
 Isolation can create difficulties in  
 periods of severe weather and it is   
 necessary to keep adequate stocks of  
 supplies available in the home during 
 the winter months.                    </content>
