		<title>05Clubs in South Bradford.</title>
		<content> There are many clubs,for both children
 and adults,within our block.There are 
 the usual clubs such as{scouts}and    
{guides}for the young and{sports}clubs 
 for all ages.Two of the faster growing
 clubs for young people seem to be the 
{majorettes}and the{computer}clubs.    
 There are several sports grounds in   
 the area available for clubs and two  
 indoor sports centres.Being on the    
 fringe of the city of Bradford there  
 are some large open spaces and two    
 such areas are occupied by two{golf}  
 clubs.Because of the{tragic fire at   
{the Bradford City ground}the club will
 have to play its next seasons matches 
 in our area at{Odsal Stadium}which is 
 now being improved in order to be used
 as a stadium for National and         
 International Speedway Championships. 
 Bradford Northern Rugby League Club   
 also play at this ground.             </content>
