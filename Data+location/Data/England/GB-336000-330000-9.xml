		<title>09How people have changed.</title>
		<content>  In  bygone  days, most  people  ended
 their education at school leaving age.
 Men usually  worked  on the farm while
 women worked  in the  farmhouse  or in
 seasonal  fieldwork. Today  farms  are
 more mechanised and so little work  is
 available. Farmers  often  dispose  of
 their tied  cottages  when they become
 available and other houses have become
 vacant  through  old  people dying and
 others moving on.This  has  led to  an
 influx  of  new  residents. Tetchill's
 population includes 2 factory managers
 and several houses have changed  hands
 quite frequently. Most people now work
 outside the area e.g. at Ellesmere    
 College or at the  MMB dairy. Families
 are smaller than they used to be (2 or
 3 is the norm) and most children go on
 beyond  S.L.A.  in  search  of  better
 qualifications.  This  results in them
 leaving the village in most cases.    </content>
