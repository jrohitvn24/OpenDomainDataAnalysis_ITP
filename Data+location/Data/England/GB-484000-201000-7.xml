The thing I find living 100 years or   
more away from whoever you are reading 
this, is that every day of my life has 
been different, and I am ten years     
old. I think it would be good living   
in Prestwood in 100 yrs. time because  
there would be many skyscrapers and    
computers. I wonder who would be Prime 
Minister, or the King/Queen. And, if   
they still make them, what would be    
the price of a Mars bar and a packet   
of Hubba Bubba? Nowadays Mars bars are 
17p and Hubba Bubba 10p a packet. Who  
knows,  they could be 70p and 50p or   
5p and 1p. I would like to go to       
school in 100 yrs from now in 2085. I  
would probably learn and understand a  
lot better. And what do {you} think? I 
will never know.
