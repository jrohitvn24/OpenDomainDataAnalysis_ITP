		<title>06LYNCROFT FARM,P. BROOK.</title>
		<content>    Lyncroft is a chicken farm in      
 Perrott's Brook owned by Mr and Mrs   
 Thomas. The farm covers 22 acres and  
 is 24 yrs old. The site was formerly a
 quarry, then a cattle farm before     
 becoming a chicken farm. A Dyke which 
 surrounded the town of an ancient     
 Roman tribe is on their land.         
     Mrs Thomas doesn't breed chickens 
 she grows them. They are bought from  
 Ross Hatcheries at 1 day old for Â£2   
 each. They are fed on chick meal or a 
 pullet grower. The 2 sheds are heated 
 by gas and each holds 9000 chicks. At 
 18 weeks they are sent to another farm
 to lay eggs.                          
     Mr Thomas is an R.A.F. officer.   
 They hope to expand the farm in the   
 future.
