		<title>13Austerfield Field Centre</title>
		<content>   The centre was built in 1882 as the 
 village school and at the turn of the 
 century had 60 pupils.The school was  
 closed in 1973 with the end of the    
 West Riding of Yorkshire and          
 Austerfield children now travel to    
 school in Bawtry or Finningly.        
  All aspects of the local environment 
 can be studied including its history, 
 geology and ecology.There are 2 full  
 time teachers and a technician on the 
 staff.The original building is used as
 classrooms and a field behind serves  
 as a campsite.One outside classroom is
 the camper's dining room while        
 another,larger mobile room is used to 
 house a variety of animals such as    
 snakes,spiders,rats ,gerbils,terrapins
 and guineapigs.Moths,butterflies and  
 caterpillars from the neighbouring    
 sand quarries are studied as are frogs
 and toads.                            </content>
