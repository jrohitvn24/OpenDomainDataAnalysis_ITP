		<title>14Our law abiding community.</title>
		<content> The nearest police station is at      
 Southwell and this is manned only on a
 part time basis. There is very seldom 
 a police presence in the villages.    
 On the whole, this is a very law      
 abiding community, with little crime  
 and very little vandalism.            
                                       
 Apart from the occasional{burglary,   
{there are a}few{minor offences}such as
 the theft of plants from gardens and  
 the fouling of pavements by dogs.     
 An excess of street litter, mainly in 
 Fiskerton, coincides with the influx  
 of summer visitors.                   
                                       
{Traffic offences}include illegal      
 parking, again mainly in Fiskerton by 
 fishermen, and motorists not adhering 
 to the 30mph speed limits in the      
 villages.                             
                                       </content>
