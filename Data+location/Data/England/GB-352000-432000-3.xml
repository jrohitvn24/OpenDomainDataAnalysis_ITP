		<title>03A Walk East of Fulwood.</title>
		<content> On Thursday the 20th of June 1985 we  
 walked down Sharoe Green Lane and     
 passed an old converted barn which was
 made into a farmhouse on Shire Bank   
 farm. We carried on down the road and 
 passed Fairways which has mostly      
 detached houses but has some          
 bungalows. Next we passed The Paddock 
 which has a laundry for people who    
 live in flats, a telephone, a Surgery 
 and a pond, which has fish and frogs  
 in it.We passed a house and orchard   
 called Fern Bank. Next to Fern Bank   
 are new detached houses that cost a   
 lot of money. We went on and were told
 that the bridge used to be the main   
 road. In five minutes we were standing
 on an old tram bridge which passed    
 over the brook. Then we went on to the
 golf course.
