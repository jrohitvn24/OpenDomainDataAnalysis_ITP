		<title>07SUPERSTITION IN CHERINGTON</title>
		<content> Nag's Head Lane is no place to be on a
 dark night for it is said to be       
 haunted by the ghost of the last man  
 to be hung on the Hang Gallows tree   
 there. Much superstition in this area 
 centres around the stones which marked
 the sites of ancient burial mounds.   
 Some stones have been moved from their
 original positions.  This happened to 
 the Long Stone which marked the mound 
 near Gatcombe Park gateway.  It is    
 said to have powers to cure ricketts  
 if children are passed through the    
 hole in its centre, but the hole is so
 small that no modern child could get  
 through.  The Long Stone is said to   
 run around the field on Midsummer     
 Night, barking like a dog.  The same  
 is said of Tingle Stone in Steps Lane 
 and this stone has been found after   
 Halloween, with embers at its foot and
 a berry wreath around its head.       </content>
