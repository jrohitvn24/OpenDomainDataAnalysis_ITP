		<title>16Events in Eccleshall</title>
		<content> Eccleshall's most important annual    
 event is the{Horticultural Show and   
{Gymkhana,}held in August. A hard-     
 working committee organizes the gym-  
 khana and marquees for the competitive
 exhibitions of vegetables, fruit,     
 flowers and craft-work. Stallholders  
 raise money for favourite charities   
 and entertainment is provided by a    
 funfair, Morris dancing, and a disco. 
 Regular get-togethers for townspeople 
 are provided by coffee mornings,      
 jumble sales and the recently innovat-
 ed car-boot sales. A summer{Victorian 
{street market,}held biennially,       
 attracts growing numbers of visitors  
 and provides an opportunity for fancy 
 dress and general fun. In 1985, to    
 commemorate 40 years of peace, a      
 fascinating display was mounted in    
 Holy Trinity church, and local sports 
 clubs held lively internal matches.   </content>
