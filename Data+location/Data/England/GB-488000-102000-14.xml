		<title>14HOBBIES AND PASTIMES  SURVEY</title>
		<content> Please specify which hobbies and      
 pastimes members of your household    
 practise regularly.                   
                                       
 All of the activities mentioned were  
 home based.   By far the largest      
 number of respondents said that they  
 considered gardening as a hobby (13 of
 33 replies) but as all respondents    
 owned a good sized garden this was not
 surprising.   Reading was the next    
 most popular pastime (4) followed by  
 knitting (3), painting and            
 Do-it-yourself (2).   Other pastimes  
 included sewing, cookery,             
 chair-caning, playing piano and       
 crosswords.
