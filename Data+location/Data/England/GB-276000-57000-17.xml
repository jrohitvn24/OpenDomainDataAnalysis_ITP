		<title>17"Incomers" to Harberton area</title>
		<content> With the possible exception of some of
 the farming community, most           
 inhabitants were born outside the     
 area. Some older members of the       
 community may have only moved across  
 parish boundries, but many young      
 families are from different parts of  
 the country.                          
 As with many country area you are not 
 considered "local" even when you have 
 lived here for several years.         
 The general attitude to "incomers"    
 seems to be that they are welcome     
 provided they are prepared to join in 
 village life but not if they try to   
 dominate it. Although the comment was 
 also made that often it is the        
 incomers who organise various events. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
