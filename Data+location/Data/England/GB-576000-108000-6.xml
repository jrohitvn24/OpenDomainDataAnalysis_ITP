		<title>06The Wreck of The Amsterdam</title>
		<content> In the muddy foreshore at Bulverhythe 
 is sunk a Dutch East Indiaman named   
 The Amsterdam.Only the ends of its    
 ribs now show above the beach at very 
 low tides.The ship has been there     
 since 1749,and attempts are now being 
 made to salvage her cargo and raise   
 the hull for preservation and display.
 Many artefacts such as wine bottles,  
 dressmaking pins and items of clothing
 have already been recovered,but much  
 more remains in the mud as yet.Divers 
 experienced in marine archaeology     
 worked during the Summer of 1984,and  
 are working now,in Summer 1985,but    
 foresee at least a further year before
 all the ship's contents are recovered.
 When the ship was beached in a storm  
 it quickly sank as the beach here was 
 unexpectedly soft.The Dutch government
 owns the wreck,but most of the cost of
 recovery is paid for by sponsorship.  </content>
