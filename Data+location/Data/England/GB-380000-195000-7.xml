		<content> The 1981 census counted 289 residents 
 in the whole Parish, consisting of 143
 males and 146 females.  The age       
 distribution peaked in the 30-34 age  
 band with 31 people, but above average
 numbers were found in the 5-19 range  
 and the 25-44 age range.  Our 1985    
{Housing}Questionaire accounted for 92 
 residents, about 45% of roughly 200 in
 the study area.

 12 new houses have been built since   
 the 1981 census, 6 of these are       
 included in our survey.  These 6 have 
 14 residents of whom 10 are in        
{employment}and only 2 are children.   
 If typical of all 122 houses this     
 suggests that the village population  
 has increased by about 30 since 1981.
