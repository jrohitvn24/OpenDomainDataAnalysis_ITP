 Then when we get back we go into the  
 hall to have dinner.After our dinner, 
 at 12:30,we go out to play.           
 At 1 o'clock we come in to maths.We do
 that for about 40 minutes.Then we do  
 music.I like doing music.I can play   
 the recorder and when Mr. Bagley says,
 "Let's have a 'B'," I play it.When we 
 do a round Mr. Bagley says,"The front 
 half of the class sing with Anna and  
 the rest sing with me." So music is   
 fun. At 2:15 we go out for our last   
 playtime. Then at 2:30 we come in for 
 reading. At 3 o'clock Mr. Bagley      
 usually reads a story aloud until 3:15
 when we go home.Some of us on the     
 school bus.
