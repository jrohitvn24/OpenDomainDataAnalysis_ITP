		<title>01Rawcliffe and District</title>
		<content> Our project area is on the north-west 
 outskirts of York and covers the      
 village of Rawcliffe (pop.3280) and   
 parts of Clifton (pop.2895) and Nether
 Poppleton (pop. 1570).                
   The River Ouse runs through and     
 separates the three villages. Clifton 
 was once Clyftone because of the cliff
 by the river leading to the low flat  
 land called the Ings which is often   
 flooded in Winter and Spring. The last
 fifty years have seen Rawcliffe       
 develop from a quiet rural area to a  
 rapidly expanding residential area.Now
 the 2nd world war airfield has housing
 and industrial development. The main  
 employers in the village are Clifton  
 Hospital and Armstrong's Engineering. 
 Nether Poppleton is a quiet farming   
 and residential community on the west 
 bank of the River Ouse.
