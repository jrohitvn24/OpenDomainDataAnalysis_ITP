		<title>07ALLERGIES IN SCHOOL CHILDREN</title>
		<content> A nurse who tests for allergies told  
 our teacher that this area of the     
 country is the worst for such         
 complaints.  Our class seems to prove 
 the point. As part of our Domesday    
 work we went for a walk on a hot day  
 on footpaths between fields.  Many of 
 us suffered so badly that 8 of us out 
 of 24 had to go a different way back  
 to school along the roads through the 
 village away from the fields.  Susan's
 eyes puffed up and Sheridan came out  
 in a rash.  Louise and Sarah had to   
 use their asthma spinhalers and Debbie
 was wheezing with her asthma. Elaine  
 did not even come because the grass   
 makes her eczema worse.  We found that
 the childrens' hayfever was worse on a
 footpath between a field of wheat and 
 a high hedge.
