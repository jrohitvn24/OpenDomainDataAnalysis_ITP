		<content>This area central to our block has a   
few houses. There is an inn, now known 
as the Wolseley Arms, which stands at  
the junction of the A513 and the A51.  
This inn is adjacent to the River      
Trent. Also there is a cafe and a      
craft centre. In another building, a   
17th Century threshing barn, is a      
display of a local artist's work. The  
barn was removed from its original     
location at Colton near Rugeley, where 
it prevented new farm buildings being  
erected, to the present site in 1984.  
It is one of the oldest farm buildings 
in Staffordshire and it is a pleasure  
to see that it has been saved for      
posterity. Wolseley Hall was demolished
during the 1960's which had been the   
seat of the Wolseley's for many        
generations. The estate is still in the
ownership of Sir Charles Wolseley. The 
Dowager Lady Wolseley lives locally.   </content>
