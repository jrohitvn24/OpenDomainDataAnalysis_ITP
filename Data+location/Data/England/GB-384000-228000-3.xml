		<content>{Abbots Court Farm}was taken over by   
 the Houlbrookes in 1957. The farm was 
 halved in 1958 with their son-in-law  
 and daughter who lived next door. At  
 that time 29 cows were milked until   
 1963 when disease 'abortion' broke out
 and the herd had to be destroyed. In  
 197O Mr. Samuel took over the whole   
 farm. At the present time the farm of 
 217 acres consists of arable, beef and
 dairy cattle.{Apperley Court}keeps    
 mainly{Simmental cattle}for breeding  
 purposes. Part of a vogue for         
 experimenting with imported           
 cattle,these Swiss cattle are sired by
 their own bull. They are shown at     
 County shows, the nearest being the   
 'Three Counties' at Malvern. The      
 cattle are fed on minerals and cake   
 and in summer are put out to graze.
