		<title>10FAMILY LIFE - WEST INDIAN</title>
		<content>   In four weeks I am going to         
 Barbados.  I have a granny there. It  
 has taken us a year to save the money.
 I am looking forward to going there   
 and seeing my granny. I wish my granny
 lived nearer.                         
                                       
   She lives in a big wooden house in  
 the country-side.  I hope she is well.
 My mum's sister is going too, and my  
 four sisters as well. It's our once in
 a lifetime chance to see her.  We are 
 all very happy.  I am also happy      
 because that is where my mum comes    
 from.  My dad comes from St.Andrews   
 nearby.
