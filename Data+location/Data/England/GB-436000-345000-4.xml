		<title>04KILBURN(DERBY)AREA HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> The majority of homes in our area are 
 ocupied by families, most with        
 children and some with only one       
 parent. In a high proportion of       
 families, other members of the        
 extended family live within           
 half_an_hours drive, many within a few
 minutes walk. Most home_life is       
 dominated by three things; food,      
 clothing and entertainment. Mothers,  
 in particula, spend much time buying, 
 preparing,                            
 and cooking food. The washing, ironing
 and repair of clothes, and in a large 
 minority of homes, their making, also 
 takes up time, particualy as the young
 are increasingly choosy &amp; fashion     
 conscious. Entertainment is dominated 
 by the television and the latest      
 invention, videos, for use with these.
