  Educational facilities in the Cannock
area are provided by Staffordshire     
County Council and the District is     
served by a wide range of schools      
which operate on a two tier            
co-educational basis.                  
  Due to falling rolls Sherbrook &amp;     
Chenet schools are to amalgamate in    
September 1986. This will create one of
the largest schools in the district    
with 1800 pupils.                      
  The new school will allow all pupils 
to benefit from the wide range of      
computer technology,audio-visual       
equipment and sports facilities which  
will be available when the schools     
amalgamate.                            
   At the moment the school is unnamed 
and the school uniform has yet to be   
decided.
