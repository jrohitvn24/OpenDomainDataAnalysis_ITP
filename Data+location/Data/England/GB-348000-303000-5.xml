		<content> It is thought that a murder was       
 commited in Condover  Hall.A squire   
 and his son had a fight and the son   
 killed his father.When they were      
 fighting the father made an imprint of
 a blood stained hand on the stairs.The
 son accused his butler,John Viam,of   
 the murder,and he was hanged at       
 Shrewsbury.Before he died he put a    
 curse on Condover Hall saying that no 
 heir to the Hall would live.This curse
 has been fulfilled.For years after,a  
 blood stained hand has appeared on the
 stairs leading to the basement.When   
 workmen chipped away the stone the    
 hand disappeared.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
