		<content> The A12 London to Ipswich road runs   
 through the north-western part of the 
 area. The dual carriage-way was       
 constructed in 1967. As there is no   
 alternative route, there is an ever   
 increasing volume of traffic:43000    
 vehicles per day during 1984, rising  
 to 52000 in August. The predicted     
 qrowth to 2001 is to between 54000 and
 65000 vehicles per day. 17% is heavy  
 goods traffic. The accident rate,     
 however, is low compared with other   
 major trunk routes.There are two bus  
 routes in the area, each having about 
 9 buses a day. The two routes are     
 Hatfield Peverel to Maldon and Witham 
 to Wickham Bishops. The railway line  
 ceased to operate in 1963, and was    
 dismantled in 1968, thus severing the 
 previously well used transport        
 connection with East London.
