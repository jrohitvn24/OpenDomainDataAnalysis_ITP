		<title>09Interview with Mrs Thornton</title>
		<content> Mrs Thornton has lived in Eastoft for 
 40 years.There is one shop which is   
 the Post Office.The Post Office sells 
 general things.A butcher,a baker and a
 fishman comes round selling things in 
 their vans.                           
    There are not alot of yearly       
 events.There used to be a gala but    
 that has died out.Now there is a      
 harvest festival,the church fete and a
 garden party.                         
    The main change is the farming.In  
 the old days everything revolved round
 farming,but now lots of people        
 have jobs at Scunthorpe.There are few 
 animals around Eastoft.It is mainly an
 arable area.There are no sheep because
 of the flat wet land which would cause
 foot rot.                             
    Eastoft has now more ameneties     
 including the sewerage processing     
 which was laid on 10  years ago.      </content>
