		<content> Cornwall is visited regularly by many 
 holidaymakers who visit not only the  
 beaches but inland areas. The         
 agricultural nature of this area      
 is attractive to tourists and in the  
 summer there are more cars on the     
 roads and lanes than at any other time
 of the year. Some people stay in the  
 local hotel or in bed and breakfast   
 accommodation or even camp in the     
 farmer's fields. There are no         
 amusement arcades, cinemas or public  
 entertainment places but people come  
 to see the attractive rural buildings 
 or countryside and drive down the     
 narrow lanes with the hedgerows full  
 of primroses, bluebells and, later on,
 foxgloves. Many people are involved in
 tourism in some way,either working to 
 provide bed &amp; breakfast accommodation 
 or selling the many items required by 
 visitors.                  (Sue Hall) </content>
