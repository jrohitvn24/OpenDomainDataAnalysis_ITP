 car,then brutally attacked by three   
 thugs as he walked home.A teenager's  
 happiness at having got engaged turned
 to terror when he was punched in the  
 face after being forced to stop his   
 car in the High Street.Seasalter      
 residents lack of interest for fund   
 raising events for a Community Centre 
 was blamed for a poor turn out at a   
 sponsored walk in which only 10 people
 came.A frieghter which has only just  
 returned to service has made its first
 appearance in Whitstable Harbour.

 disappeared in a cloud of dust and    
 rubble when the former St.Peter's     
 Church in Bexley St. was demolished.
