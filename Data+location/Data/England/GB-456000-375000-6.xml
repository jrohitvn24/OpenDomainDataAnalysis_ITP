		<title>06Worksop College Buildings</title>
		<content> There have been three chapels at the  
 college,with the first two being      
 temporary buildings.The final one was 
 built in 1911 with many splendid      
 designs including Kemp stained glass  
 windows.The most recent addition to   
 the buildings is the Churchill Hall,  
 constructed in 1975.                  
   The college used to contain a prep  
 school for children under the age of  
 thirteen but another Woodard          
 establishment was opened at Rauby,so  
 five years later the school was moved 
 from Worksop to Rauby.Now about fifty 
 percent of the Worksop College intake 
 have been to Rauby.                   
   At present there are sixty girls at 
 the College and two hundred and       
 eighty boys at the college.Pupils     
 mainly come from the South Yorkshire  
 and Nottinghamshire area.
