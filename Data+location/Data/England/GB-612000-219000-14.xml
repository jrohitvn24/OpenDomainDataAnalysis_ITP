		<content>   All of the old buildings which were 
 mentioned on pages 10 &amp; 11 were either
 built in the{nineteenth}century or the
 early{twentieth}century. This is apart
 from Rowheath Farmhouse. These        
 buildings are exceptions because most 
 of the buildings (about 50%) were     
 built after World War II and the      
 almost all the rest between the wars. 
   The large building increase is due  
 to the influx of people which one     
 local inhabitant said was considerable
 in the{'50s}and{'60s}.The reason for  
 this is probably the cheapness of     
 living in such a rural area despite   
 the fact that it is within 10 minutes 
 of Clacton.                           
   In the questionaire some said that  
 the expense was their reason for      
 living in the area. Others said that  
 it was peaceful and there were still a
 number of old buildings to see.       </content>
