		<content>{Chelford}has a lot of woodland and    
 pastures.Field boundaries are mainly  
 hedges and fences. There are lakes,   
 ponds and streams .There are two      
 streams one called Snape Brook and the
 other Bag Brook, both running         
 westward into Astle Lake.There is a   
 stream called the Peover Eye which    
 runs southward out of this artificial 
 lake.Throughout the block,there are   
 views of the Pennines to the East.It  
 is a beautiful place to live.Chelford 
 is almost flat being gently undulating
 with a few higher hillocks. It is very
 quiet away from the busy main roads.  
 There is a church yard and an old     
 private park called Astle Park which  
 belonged to Astle Hall.Apart from a   
 few outbuildings,this Hall is now     
 demolished. Withington Hall,to the    
 south of the block, is well hidden by 
 trees from the A535 road.             </content>
