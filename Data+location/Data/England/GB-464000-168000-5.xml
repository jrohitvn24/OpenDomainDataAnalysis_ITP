		<content> R.O.F. stands for Royal Ordnance      
 Factory. The factory used to be a farm
 and you can see the outline of the    
 farm house and orchard.  It is        
 surrounded by mounds of earth in case 
 of accidents.   There is a drain that 
 goes down to the River Kennet.   They 
                                       
                                       
 have to be careful not to throw       
 poisonous liquids down it.  They make 
 explosives for the Royal Air Force.   
 The Burghfield Factory covers 264     
 acres.  There is a 3\ mile fence      
 around the buildings.  Around the     
 R.O.F. Burghfield there are poles with
 wires that act as lightning           
 conductors.  They have a small        
 hospital and a firebrigade that put   
 out fires and help people who are     
 injured.  When they have thunderstorms
 they have to take cover under ground. </content>
