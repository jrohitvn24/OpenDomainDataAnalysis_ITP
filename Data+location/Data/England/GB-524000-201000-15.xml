		<title>15Mrs Teggin &amp; Osborne House</title>
		<content>   Mrs. Y. Teggin loves Little Heath.  
 She came from Knightsbridge, London,  
 and has three children. Her main hopes
 are for peace and better discipline in
 society.                              
   The house was built in 1701 and has 
 Georgian sash windows, panelled doors,
 an Adam fireplace, a Welsh dresser and
 bells which used to call the servants.
   Mr. and Mrs. Teggin have lived here 
 for 36 years and they built a high    
 brick wall around the garden. There is
 a Victoria post box in the wall. They 
 have always had dogs, first spaniels  
 then labradors.                       
   The Duke of Leeds and an M.P. for   
 Hertford have lived here.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
