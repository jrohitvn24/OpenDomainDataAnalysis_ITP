		<title>08QUEENS GARDENS HULL</title>
		<content> The area now known as Queens Gardens  
 was once the site of Hulls first      
 enclosed dock - excavated between 1774
 and 1778.  The dock was the first of  
 its kind outside London and covers a  
 total area of 11 acres.  The original 
 name of the dock was 'The Old Dock'   
 but it was re-named 'Queens' when     
 Queen Victoria visited Hull in 1854.  
 Today the site is an open amenity area
 with lakes and lawns.  There is a cafe
 and people, mainly shop and office    
 workers, enjoy lunchtime entertainment
 in the summer.                        
 At the north end of the gardens is a  
 plaque which depicts Robinson Crusoe  
 from the novel by Daniel Defoe.       
 Crusoe stated his illfated voyage from
 Hull and, according to the novel he   
 remained on his desert island for 28  
 years 2 months and 19 days, wishing he
 could return to Hull.                 </content>
