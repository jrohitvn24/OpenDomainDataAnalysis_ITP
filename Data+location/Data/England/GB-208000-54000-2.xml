		<title>02PEOPLE &amp; JOBS IN TYWARDREATH</title>
		<content> The{population}of the area is very    
 centred around Tywardreath. There is a
 mixture of age ranges.                
 There are older people in the village,
 in fact in 1905 "The Illustrated Mail"
 wrote an article about the amazing    
 ages that people lived until in       
 Tywardreath, but these are balanced by
 the middle-aged and young.            
 The {main employment}of the area is   
 working in some capacity for the China
 Clay firm of {English China Clay,}    
 either at the clay pits, at their     
 offices in St. Austell or at Par      
 Docks, where ships come from all over 
 the world to collect china clay.      
{Farms}cover a large section of our    
 area but they do not employ many      
 people. A few work for {British Rail} 
 which has a station at Par, others    
 work in the {village shops}or in St.  
 Austell, Truro or Fowey.              </content>
