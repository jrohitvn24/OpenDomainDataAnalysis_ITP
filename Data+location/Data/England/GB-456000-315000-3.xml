{Three Crowns. The Soar Bridge Inn}is  
 situated between the river and the    
 busy road to Quorn.Because of this it 
 probably gets more trade. The Inn next
 to the canal is named{The Navigation  
 as it was used by the navvies who     
 built the canal.{The Hunting Lodge}is 
 on the road to Sileby and is about 100
 years old. It was built as a house for
 Mr. Martin. He fed the poor during the
 war and as a result of his kindness   
 there is an avenue named after him in 
 the village.{The Soar Bridge Inn}used 
 to be called The Railway when there   
 was a railway over the road and before
 that The Boatman's Rest. It is about  
 three hundred years old. All the pubs 
 sell good food and drink.
