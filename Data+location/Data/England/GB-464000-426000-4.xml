		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AN ELEVEN YEAR   
 OLD.                                  
 I wake up at between half past six and
 seven o'clock, and have a cup of tea. 
 Then I go and make my bed and get     
 dressed. I usually have cornflakes for
 breakfast. After breakfast I get my   
 shoes on and go to school for nine    
 o'clock. At school we start with      
 Assembly and then have English until  
 break.After break we have recorder    
 lessons and maths until 12 o'clock,   
 when I go home for dinner. I like     
 scrambled egg. About 12.30 I go back  
 to school so I can play with my       
 friends for half an hour. At one      
 o'clock we have music, then we go to  
 the swimming baths. When I get home at
 3.30 I go and call on my friends until
 5.00.After tea I play out again then I
 go home and watch television until bed
 time.                                 </content>
