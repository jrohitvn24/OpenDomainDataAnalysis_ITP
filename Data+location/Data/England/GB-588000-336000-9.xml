		<title>09EGMERE MILL'S PRESENT NATURE</title>
		<content> The two mills are now capable of      
 producing up to 120,00 tonnes of      
 animal feed per annum. About 17,000   
 tonnes can be stored on site. Animal  
 feed making can best be likened to    
 cake making. Ingredients are held in  
 bins and then individually weighed.   
 After being put in the mixer for 4    
 minutes, it is either sold as meal or 
 made into cubes by adding steam and   
 extruding the mix through a cubing    
 machine.{Typical ingredients}are      
 wheat, barley, oats, peas, soya (in   
 various forms), meat and bone, fish-  
 meal, sunflower, maize - by-products  
 from all over the world. Today in our 
 intensive world we would use growth   
 promoters and drugs. Our{delivery area
 covers all Norfolk, to Colchester in  
 the South and Skegness in the North.  
 We have 105 staff and are now a fully 
 computerised organisation.            </content>
