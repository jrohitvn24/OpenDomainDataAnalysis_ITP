		<content>    Part of the valley of the River    
 Went has been designated a{Site of    
{Special Scientific Interest.          
{(S.S.S.I.)}This is known as the       
{Brockadale Nature Reserve}and is      
 managed by the Yorkshire Wildlife     
 Trust. It is made up of pasture,      
 woodland and limestone crags. There is
 also a scree slope. Many rare plants  
 may be found there, including several 
 kinds of orchids, and cowslips. There 
 is access for the public provided that
 they keep to the paths and observe the
 country code.                         
    This part of the valley may have   
 got its name from the old name for    
 badgers, "Brock" so "Brockadale" may  
 mean "Badgers' Valley."               
    Most of the land is owned by the   
 Forestry Commission and much of it has
 been planted with sycamores.The Y.W.T.
  hopes to replant with suitable trees.</content>
