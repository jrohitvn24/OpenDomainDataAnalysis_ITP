		<content> Before school starts we play football,
 and during morning play we play       
 football in the playground too.       
 Any one can join in but usually none  
 of the girls play.                    
 At dinner time we play football or toy
 scraps in the field.                  
 Before when we were not allowed to    
 play in the field we used to play semi
 or bulldog or toyscraps.              
 Semi you play like this: you have to  
 run from a half of a circle to another
 and someone tries to get you.         
 If they hit you you are it with them. 
 Bulldog is where you line up all      
 behind a line and someone is it.      
 We have races in the field.           
 One day we had a piggyback race and I 
 won but we got told off and we had to 
 stay in the play ground.Morning and   
 afternoon play last 15 minutes.       
 Dinner time is 1hour 15 minutes long. </content>
