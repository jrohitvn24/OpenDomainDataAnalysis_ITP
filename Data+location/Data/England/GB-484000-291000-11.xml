Oeople who live in this area have very 
limited choices of employment as nearly
all the land is used for farming.This  
means that they must either work on the
farm as has been traditional,though    
because of modern farming methods this 
is not always possible. Most people now
work outside the district,many in the  
new factories that are being built at  
present in Corby. There are other light
industries in some of the other nearby 
towns.
