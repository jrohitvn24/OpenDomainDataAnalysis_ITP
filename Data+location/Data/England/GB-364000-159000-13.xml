		<content>      This survey looked at three      
 different age groups in a systematic  
 way:girls of primary school age,girls 
 of secondary school age,and women up  
 to middle-age.Timsbury school-children
 helped us,together with Timsbury Girl 
 Guides,staff and parents.             
       Altogether,we looked at hats,   
 shoes,colours,clothes,belts,make-up,  
 socks and tights,latest fashion,      
 earrings and jewellery.               
{Jewellery.                            
       We found that the children      
 preferred plastic to expensive        
 jewellery,and also that that the      
 adults all preferred the expensive.   
{Earrings.}                            
        These were not popular with the
 adults,least of all hoop earrings.    
 The children and the teenagers loved  
 all earrings.{(continued).
