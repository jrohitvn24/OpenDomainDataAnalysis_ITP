		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA</title>
		<content>{Esher}and{Claygate}are affluent       
 residential areas with a strong sense 
 of community.{West End}village,to the 
 west of Esher,still has a semi-rural  
 charm.Small parts of{Hinchley Wood}and
{Hersham}extend into our area. The     
 dominant impression our area gives is 
 of wide,tree-lined roads with large   
 well-built houses. There are many     
 private roads and estates.            
  Over half of the area is not built   
 over.There are seven farms. Claremont 
 Park is run by the National Trust and 
 there are extensive commons and       
 woodlands. The River Mole snakes its  
 way northwards in the west of the     
 area.                                 
  Esher is the main focus of roads in  
 the area.The building of the A3       
 Esher by-pass has had a big impact in 
 the south of our area.Claygate station
 is on the Guildford-Waterloo line.    </content>
