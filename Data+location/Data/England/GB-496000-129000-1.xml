		<content> Between Northchapel and Plaistow the  
 Weald Clay has produced a wooded      
 undulating landscape where forestry   
 and farming predominate.   The ancient
 Wealden forest has been opened up by  
 settlers since prehistoric times.  At 
 Piper Copse are the remains of an Iron
 Age Camp.   Shillinglee Furnace and   
 Mitchell Park Forge are Tudor remnants
 of the iron industry.   Today most of 
 the woodland is managed by the        
 forestry commission.   Chiddinfold    
 Forest is one of the earliest forests 
 taken over by the commission in       
 1922.   Kingspark Wood is an area of  
 special scientific interest noted for 
 butterflies, moths, flowers, mosses   
 and liverworts.   Farmland is mainly  
 arable.   There is also pastures for  
 dairy cattle and sheep.  The Ashpark  
 Brickyard makes handmade bricks for   
 high quality restoration work.        </content>
