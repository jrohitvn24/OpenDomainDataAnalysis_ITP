 North Fareham are employed in         
 agriculture,either as farm owners,    
 farm managers or farm workers.There   
 are many self-employed market         
 gardeners involved in                 
 horticulture.Another major employer is
 Knowle Hospital.Many of the doctors,  
 nurses,catering staff,cleaners,       
 porters and teachers live in either   
 wickham or Funtley villages,or on the 
 northern outskirts of Fareham.Many of 
 the Funtley villagers work at Funtley 
 Abattoir(which is west of this block) 
 which slaughters and prepares animals 
 from local farms for the meat market  
 both in Britain and abroad.Pink's     
 sawmills also employ local labour to  
 cut transport and prepare timber.There
 are no other significant industries or
 employers.
