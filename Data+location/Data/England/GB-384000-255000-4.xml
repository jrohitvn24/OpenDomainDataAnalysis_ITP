		<content>                                       
   At this time the area seems to come 
 to life. The orange lights on the     
 lamposts give Warndon an{eerie        
 appearance. Around Warndon the        
 teenagers come out and the older men  
 nip down to the local pub. The punks  
 come out and hang around in groups    
 near walls with marker pens. Then they
 light their cigarettes and start      
 smoking, usually under lamposts. Some 
 start spraying cans of paint on the   
 walls. You can go to{the shops}and see
 it sprayed over the walls. This isn't 
 very nice but it gives the place a    
 character. The pubs get most business 
 from middle aged people who are mostly
 regulars. The favourite night is      
 Saturday night. When night settles in 
 the punks go home and the pubs close. 
 The Warndon area goes to sleep and all
 is quiet.                             </content>
