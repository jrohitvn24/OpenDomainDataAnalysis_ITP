		<content>   There is very little industry in our
 block as can be readily seen from the 
 map.                                  
{    The Northern area}                
                                       
  To the North of The Eyes lies the    
{abattoir}belonging to Gaskells the    
 area's local curers and supplier of   
 bacon. In the same location can be    
 found a number of small industrial    
 concerns chief among which is a       
 plastics factory.                     
    {The Southern area                 
                                       
   To the South of the Manchester Ship 
 Canal and just to the West of the old 
 village of Thelwall lies a recently   
 abandoned wire works. It is now being 
 refurbished as a collection of small  
 factories and warehouses although     
 their exact use is not known.
