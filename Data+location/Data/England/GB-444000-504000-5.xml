		<content> The River Leven full of fish,         
 put them back they're not for you!    
 Get a rod, get a net, catch a fish but
 don't get wet,                        
 Walk along the river side, watch the  
 fishes running by!                    
 The ducks come swimming by, on the top
 of the river lie,                     
 The fish start rising everywhere,     
 fishermen catch them right there!     
                                       
 The Village Hall is one of the main   
 assets of the village, it has been in 
 regular use since 1927 when it was    
 built. It was even used in the war    
 (1939_45) by the army to live in. The 
 committee arrange a Pantomime each    
 year, there have been 38 pantomimes.  
 This year 1985 they performed "Ali    
 Baba".
