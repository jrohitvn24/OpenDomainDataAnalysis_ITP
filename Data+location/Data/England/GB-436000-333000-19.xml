		<content> The residential area is a mixture of  
 pre-war houses (owner occupied) and   
 council property,built in the late    
 sixties,including semi's and flats.   
                                       
 There are a considerable number of    
 small firms set up in the last 10-15  
 years which seem well established.    
                                       
 The area is dominated by the          
 Chaddesden by-pass which has cut down 
 the amount of traffic on Nottingham   
 Road.However the by-pass is a busy    
 road and a worry to families living   
 near by.                              
                                       
 There is still a large amount of      
 uncultivated land with two railway    
 tracks cutting across.
