		<content>We think most people around Cofton     
school have a broad Birmingham accent  
and the only slang term regulary used  
is LOO meaning lavatory or toilet.     
Only English is spoken in most houses. 
Most people have lived in Birmingham   
all of their lives so there are not    
many accents or dialects in Cofton,    
Longbridge and West Heath. Quite a lot 
people speak bad lauguage because they 
think it sounds big, but it is not     
allowed in homes. People have different
ideas about which words are considered 
as swearing. We have a variety of      
sayings like when we ask out parents   
for money they reply that money does   
not grow on trees. Also if we ignore   
each other they say its like speaking  
to a brick wall  if you can't we find  
something which is not hard to find we 
are told  you are blind as a bat. There
are many such phrases.                 </content>
