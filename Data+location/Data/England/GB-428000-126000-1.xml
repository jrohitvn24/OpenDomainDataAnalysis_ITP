		<title>01The Village of Lockerley</title>
		<content> The overall impression of the village 
 of Lockerley is that it is a very     
 scattered community with two main     
 centres of population separated by    
 nearly a mile of countryside. The     
 Church stands between these two       
 centres acting as a kind of bridge,   
 and with its spire is clearly visible 
 from the two ends of the village; it  
 helps unite a widespread population of
 about 900 people.                     
 Lockerley is made up of at least four 
 greens, with houses grouped around    
 three of them. At Butts Green we have 
 the village institutions - the school,
 the village hall, telephone exchange  
 and the pub. Lockerley Green is the   
 commercial centre of the village with 
 Post Office, shop and garage. Top     
 Green is, as the name implies, on a   
 small hill and is a circle of houses. 
 Critchells Green is less inhabited.   </content>
