		<title>18RIVER AVON, SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>   The brook in Great Somerford that   
 joins the river Avon used to flood    
 into the fields around it.It is now   
 dredged every twenty years to stop    
 this happening.It was last done about 
 two years ago.When it was last dredged
 a lot of plants started to grow on the
 opposite bank.The seeds that were     
 under stones were disturbed and this  
 caused the seeds to float to the bank 
 and settle.In winter the river used to
 flood and  make a stream between Great
 Somerford and Little Somerford so that
 people going from one village to the  
 other had to wade or row across.The   
 Somerfords got their names from the   
 ford in summer.The main field by the  
 brook is now used for corn instead of 
 grazing so along the bank weeds grow  
 and are no longer eaten by cattle.
