		<title>08CLUBS IN WILLINGDON</title>
		<content>   There are many clubs in the         
 Willingdon area to which children may 
 belong. These exist both in schools   
 and in the community.                 
   At school children have a wide      
 choice of sporting activities as well 
 as Art and Drama. Outside school they 
 may join various organisations such as
 Cubs, Brownies, Guides and Scouts as  
 well as such clubs as St. John's      
 Ambulance, Red Cross, Majorettes and  
 Youth Clubs.                          
   Many local children belong to       
 Polegate Junior Disco which is held   
 every month on Saturday for a cost of 
 50p per session.                      
   A large number of children attend   
 music clubs or have lessons. They     
 learn to play the recorder at school  
 and some learn the guitar and piano   
 and belong to a singing club.
