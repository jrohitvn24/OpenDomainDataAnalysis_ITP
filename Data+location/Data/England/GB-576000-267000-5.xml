    Local Resident: "I remember during 
the war when they ploughed up the      
Heath.We used to go over to Icklingham 
to dances-there were lots of R.A.F.    
boys there and a gang of us girls used 
to go.I used to tell my mum that       
so-and-so was going so she wasn't      
worried then and we had to cycle there 
and back.We'd go up Lackford Lane to   
Lackford and sometimes we'd hear the   
German bombers coming over.And we'd    
put our lights out in case they could  
see them and then we couldn't see-and  
we forgot all about the furrows and we 
bumped along.Mostly we pushed our      
bikes.
