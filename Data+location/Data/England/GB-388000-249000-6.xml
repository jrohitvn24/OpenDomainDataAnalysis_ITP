		<title>06The Village of Stoulton</title>
		<content>     The small village of Stoulton is  
 in a wheat growing area.  It possesses
 an old Malthouse formerly used in ale 
 brewing - all the local pubs made     
 their own brew.                       
     Another interesting building is   
 the church with its typically Norman  
 arches and windows. Graveyard evidence
 shows that the richer people seemed to
 live much longer than the poor. Also, 
 the winter months claimed more deaths.
     From 1814 there was an annual     
 donation to Stoulton of 20 loaves of  
 bread to the poor.  The donation is   
 now five pounds sterling given to a   
 villager who has helped to serve the  
 community.                            
     The old coach house used to be the
 village pub called the Talbot which   
 became a girls' school called Mount   
 Pleasant - now a private dwelling     
 called The Mount.                     </content>
