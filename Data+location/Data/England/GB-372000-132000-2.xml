		<title>02Farming in the area.</title>
		<content>  Arable farming is predominant in this
 area but there is a little dairy      
 farming.Most of our area is hilly and 
 wooded and therefore unsuitable for   
 farming. There are seven farms in the 
 area and the farm houses themselves   
 are very old which means that there   
 has been farming in this area for many
 years. The fields are large and       
 spacious at the bottom of the woods.  
 The woods are plantations of          
 coniferous trees leaving no room for  
 farming although many trees are being 
 cut down and being used for other     
 forestry purposes including nature    
 trails.
