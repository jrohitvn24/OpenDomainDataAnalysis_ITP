		<title>14DIARY OF A MILKMAN.</title>
		<content>  I've been{a milkman}for thirteen     
 years.I have to get up at 4 o'clock to
 load the van from the old store; the  
 milk having been delivered by lorry   
 the previous afternoon.I set off at   
 5.a.m. in the summer I work seven days
 a week{delivering to shops,}hotels and
 houses.When I finish the round at     
 1.pm I start on my paperwork.In the   
 summer I deliver approximately 1,400  
 bottles of milk plus fresh cream      
 orange and eggs.                      
  I enjoy the job as it's much better  
 than being shut in a factory, but I   
 don't like getting up so early or     
 having to{work during the holidays}   
 like Christmas and Easter.            
  Unfortunately, because of the worry  
 of the fat content in dairy products  
 sales have gone down.However sales of 
 skimmed milk are now on their way     
 up.                                   </content>
