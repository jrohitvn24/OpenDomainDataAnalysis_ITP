  There is an outdoor pool which       
 looks rather sad at the moment,       
 because we go to Wisbech indoor pool  
 instead. The school has five classes, 
 two infant and three junior. Clubs are
 held in the lunch hour because a      
 lot of our children have to leave     
 promptly at 3.30 on the school buses, 
 so they cannot stay behind after      
 school. The list of clubs includes    
 football, netball, athletics, chess,  
 recorders and keep fit to disco       
 music.We play a good deal of rounders 
 in the summer, and involve ourselves  
 in all sorts of matches and           
 competitions with other schools.
