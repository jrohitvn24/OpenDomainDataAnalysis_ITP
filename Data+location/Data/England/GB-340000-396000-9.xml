		<title>09A Detached House in Kirkby</title>
		<content> My name is Tony and I live in a       
 detached house which has 4 bedrooms.  
 Our street has no telephone or post   
 box or places of work, but it         
 does have a corner shop and 2 small   
 greens which have 7 trees.            
 Inside our house the heating is gas   
 and electric and our cooker is        
 electric. We have a single garage and 
 a front and back garden. Altogether we
 have 9 rooms excluding the hall and   
 landing. The age of the house is      
 approximately 30 years. We have not   
 had any extensions built but we have  
 had a wall knocked down and double    
 glazing fitted.                       
 Our nearest amenities are the corner  
 shop, Ruffwood Comprehensive School,  
 which is the one I will be going to   
 next year and Kirkby Church of England
 School, which is the one I go to now.
