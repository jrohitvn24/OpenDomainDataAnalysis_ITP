 make room for a car-park and moved    
 out to where the people were living,  
 on the edge of town, in{Downley.      
   They have two{services}every Sunday.
 They sing hymms and choruses and have 
 a children's talk. While the children 
 are in their{Sunday School}classes the
 Minister preaches a sermon to the     
 adults. Before the evening service    
 there is a{prayer time}in the vestry.
