		<title>19WRITTLE,OUTLYING HAMLETS</title>
		<content> Oxney Green is one of the small       
 hamlets on the outskirts of Writtle.  
 In the original Domesday Book it is   
 described as an enclosure for oxen.   
     According to the 1924 Ordnance    
 Survey map it was above Chequers Rd.  
 and Eastview. It included Bulmer's    
 Farm up to the parish boundary. There 
 was a water tower at Oxney Green which
 supplied the inhabitants with water.  
 This was situated in Tower Rd. and has
 since been pulled down.               
         Oxney Green used to have its  
 own services and amenities but now it 
 tends to rely on Writtle for these    
 services. In fact this has happened to
 most of the hamlets surrounding       
 Writtle.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
