		<title>17QUEENS ARMS PUB</title>
		<content> Originally the Queens Arms was a      
 coaching Inn.It was the first stop on 
 the journey from Macclesfield to      
 London.The building has changed a lot 
 from the original althrough there is  
 still an oak beam above the bar which 
 probably came from an  old sailing    
 ship.The present building has one bar 
 and a main room.There is a smaller    
 room used for people who want to eat  
 the a,la carte food.A pint of beer    
 costs 66p and a pint of Guinness costs
 86p .The beer is brewed by Boddingtons
 at Strangeways breweries in           
 Manchester.The beer is kepted in a    
 cellar in barrels  at 50 degrees F.The
 publicans keep a toad in the cellar to
 kill beeltes.The pub is open every day
 at lunchtime and evenings.
