		<title>08 Interview With Mr.Grace</title>
		<content>    We held an interview with Mr.Bob   
 Grace who has lived in Tring all his  
 life and is a well known local        
 historian.                            
    First we asked him,"What is the    
 oldest building in Tring?"His answer  
 was,"Well the church is regarded as   
 the oldest building in Tring but there
 are several buildings  with very old  
 foundations." He also said, "At the   
 car park in front of Bishop Wood      
 school was once an old parsonage house
 and before that a manor house."       
   Next we asked him "What do you think
 is the biggest change in Tring?" His  
 answer was, "Well the biggest change  
 in Tring is the great number of houses
 that have been built."                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
