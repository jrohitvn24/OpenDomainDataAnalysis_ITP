		<title>10Old buildings and houses</title>
		<content>  This area does not have a good supply
 of bulding materials.The nearest stone
 quarries  are 17 km. away and so  only
 prestige buildings, such as  Hordley's
 church, were stone until the canal was
 built. Afterwards  even barns and farm
 walls were made of stone.             
  An  attractive  local building method
 is to construct a  timber frame and to
 fill in with  bricks. Several examples
 of this can be found on Tetchill Moor.
 In Hordley one has been extended using
 concrete as  well as bricks and timber
 but, from the  outside it is difficult
 to  distinguish  new  from original. A
 similar restoration  project  has gone
 on in Tetchill.                       
  Some quite old buildings in  Hordley,
 such as the old Tythe Barn, are  built
 completely  of  bricks,  although  the
 bricks  are smaller than  present  day
 ones.                                 </content>
