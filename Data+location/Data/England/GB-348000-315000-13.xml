		<title>13The District of Harlescott.</title>
		<content>  The district of Harlescott covers a  
 large area of land which was mainly   
 farm land, until the need for more    
 housing arose in the early nineteen   
 fifties.                              
    This was the start of two housing  
 programmes by the local council,, the 
 first part was the Sundorne side      
 (Meadows estate)and the other land    
 called Grange Farm.The site of the old
 farmhouse is where the anchor pub now 
 stands,and one of the churches by the 
 shops was a stable. At the back is the
 Grange which is a square sourounded by
 and sandstone wall here once stood a  
 large timbered house which has long   
 since gone.                           
     In addition to the housing esates 
 there are general industrial premises;
 one of which was the factory where the
 Sentinel Steam Waggon was built.
