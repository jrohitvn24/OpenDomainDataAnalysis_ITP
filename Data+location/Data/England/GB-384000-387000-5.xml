		<content>   MY DAY AT A CHEADLE PRIMARY SCHOOL. 
      AFTER REGISTRATION IT IS INTO    
 THE HALL FOR HYMN PRACTICE.I ARRIVE   
 BACK AT ABOUT 9.45 AM AND DO MY MATHS,
 MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT. AFTER 45        
 MINUTES THE BELL GOES. I GO OUTSIDE   
 AND PLAY KICKSTONE. AT 1O.45 BREAK    
 ENDS. IT IS ENGLISH NEXT MY WORST     
 SUBJECT. AFTER AN HOUR OF ADJECTIVES, 
 NOUNS AND VERBS THE BELL FINALLY      
 RINGS. I GO INTO THE CANTEEN AND EAT  
 MY PACKED LUNCH. AFTER LUNCH I PLAY   
 ROUNDERS UNTIL ONE O CLOCK. WHEN I    
 GO BACK IT IS TIME FOR READING WHICH  
 I LIKE. AFTER READING I USUALLY DO    
 TOPIC WORK OR GEOGRAPHY UNTIL BREAK   
 AT 2.3OPM. AFTER BREAK OUR TEACHER    
 READS TO US. THE CLASS READER AT THE  
 MOMENT IS THE GHOST OF THOMAS KEMPE,  
 BY PENELOPE LIVELY.                   
   I AM ELEVEN YEARS OLD, CALLED LISA  
 AND GO TO GATLEY PRIMARY SCHOOL.      </content>
