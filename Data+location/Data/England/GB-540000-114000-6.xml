		<content> On average they have 35 to 45 standbys
 a year.                               
   Barcombe fire station is manned by  
 ten fire men.Five of these are whole  
 units,which means they are available  
 all day and night.The other men are   
 three quarter units because they work 
 out of the village during part of the 
 day.                                  
   All the firemen are equipped with a 
 strong jacket and leggings made of a  
 fireproof material. They wear a helmet
 to protect their heads from falling   
 masonry and rubber boots because of   
 all the chemicals used in modern day  
 fire fighting.For special fire        
 fighting operations they have         
 additional equipment, like breathing  
 apparatus for entering smoke filled   
 buildings.
