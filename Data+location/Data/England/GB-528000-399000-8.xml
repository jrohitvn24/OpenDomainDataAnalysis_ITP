		<title>08OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school is called Tetney County    
 Primary School.It is housed in quite  
 new buildings which are very nice to  
 work in.The first part was opened in  
 1968,the second part in 1981.In       
 between,the school was on 2           
 sites,either end of the village.The   
 old school is now an old peoples home.
 We have a nice playing field where we 
 can play our games.We also have 3     
 ducks and 3 chickens which we look    
 after.                                
 We have 2 libraries in school,fiction 
 and non-fiction.They are well stocked 
 because the P.T.A.has raised a lot of 
 money.                                
 There are 5 classrooms,hall,small     
 hall,disused kitchen and a mobile     
 classroom.                            
 At lunchtime we eat sandwiches in our 
 classrooms because we don't have      
 school dinners.                       </content>
