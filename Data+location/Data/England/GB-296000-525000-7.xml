		<title>07UPPIES AND DOWNIES</title>
		<content> One of Workington's oldest traditions 
 is the uppies and downies game that   
 takes place annually around the Easter
 holiday time.The game is very similar 
 to the old football played in         
 Elizabethan times.The men and boys of 
 the town are divided into two teams   
 according to where they live.The      
 object of the game is for one team to 
 score a goal by taking the ball which 
 is a little smaller than a football   
 and very much harder and heavier and  
 place it in or on the opponents goal  
 .The ball can be transported in any   
 way kicking or carrying and basically 
 there are no real rules .To tackle a  
 member of the other team a man can    
 kick or punch to get the ball.The game
 usually has a large turnout of both   
 players and spectators .Unfortunately 
 there have been many accidents and    
 even some deaths.                     </content>
