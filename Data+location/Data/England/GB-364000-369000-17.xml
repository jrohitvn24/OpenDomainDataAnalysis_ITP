		<title>17Moulton Crow Fair</title>
		<content> The annual fair includes a dance      
 performed by villagers called the     
 Moulton Crows. Moulton Crows was      
 started by Fred Jackson in the 1930's.
 The original Crow Dance was danced by 
 the unemployed men for prize money.   
 The dance itself has changed slightly 
 but it is unique to Moulton. In the   
 1920's the Crow Fair was called       
 Moulton Carnival. The Crow Fair is a  
 very popular event there are games and
 books, cakes, sweets, bags, toys and  
 lots more are sold. There are also    
 games you can play like wet the cub,  
 wet the scout, beat the goalie. It    
 was held in the streets until 1979, it
 is now held on the school field. There
 are lots of people willing to help on 
 the stalls, lots of organisations are 
 willing to help and make it a day to  
 remember.
