		<title>18WHADDON CHASE HUNT</title>
		<content>  Many years ago all the land in       
 Whaddon                               
 was owned by the Selby Lowndes family.
 It was this family that started the   
 Whaddon Chase Hunt in 1890. There were
 60 horses stabled at Whaddon Hall and 
 all the hounds were kept at the       
 kennels across the road to Vicarage   
 Road. The Selby Lowndes family and the
 Rothschild family were part of the    
 Whaddon Chase Hunt, but keeping the   
 horses and hounds became difficult so 
 just before the war they were moved to
 Wing by the Rothschild family and     
 since then the Whaddon Chase Hunt has 
 been based at Wing. Many people from  
 Whaddon and Tattenhoe have much       
 interest in the hunt.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
