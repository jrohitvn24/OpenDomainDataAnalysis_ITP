 Most of the land around Ickford and   
 Worminghall is used for farming .It is
 fairly flat land ,ranging from 85     
 metres above sea level to just below  
 60 metres. Because of the fairly low  
 level some of the farmland floods at  
 times . In our area there are 15 farms
 marked.Most of the farms are involved 
 in mixed farming. In a survey we found
 that about one third of the fields had
 had wheat growing in them. One third  
 were used for hay and silage and one  
 third had sheep or cattle grazing.
