		<content> THIS IS A DOLOMITIC CONGLOMERATE WITH 
 A REDDISH TINGE WHICH WAS ONLY FOUND  
 AT{DRAYCOTT,}WHERE THERE WERE {THREE  
{QUARRIES}WHICH ARE NOW CLOSED. SOME OF
 THE {STONE}WAS POLISHED BY A MACHINE  
 USING CARBORUNDUM AND FINALLY BY HAND 
 USING {PUTTY POWDER}.  THIS POLISHED  
 STONE WAS CALLED {DRAYCOTT MARBLE}.   
 LARGE SLABS OF STONE WERE QUARRIED AND
 USED FOR LINTELS, GATE POSTS ETC.     
 WHICH CAN BE SEEN IN THE AREA NOW. THE
 OLDER BUILDINGS SUCH AS THE {CHURCH},{
{SCHOOL}AND {HOUSES} ARE ALL BUILT OF {
{DRAYCOTT STONE} WHICH CAN BE SEEN IN A
 WIDE AREA AND THERE ARE FOUR POLISHED{
{DRAYCOTT STONE PILLARS}IN {WELLS      
{CATHEDRAL}. THE FIRST AUTHENTIC USE OF
 THE STONE WAS IN LATE SAXON TIMES IN {
{CHEDDAR}.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
