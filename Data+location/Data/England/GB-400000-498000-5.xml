		<content> The Athletics field is 3 acres ,and it
 has a pavillion.There is a river      
 near                                  
 the pitch just over the wall.The      
 pavillion cost thousands of pounds to 
 build.We have to keep it in good      
 condition.Inside the pavillion there  
 is a sink and carpets and two separate
 changing rooms and proper seats.It is 
 going to have a toilet.Itwas built in 
 1983.On the field we play Football and
 Cricket.Reeth has an under 12s and    
 under 16s and a mens team.We also have
 a mens cricket team.Reeth under 12s   
 wear red with white pin stripes and   
 they play teams from Wensleydale.     
 Reeth men play the Wensleydale teams  
 aswell.
