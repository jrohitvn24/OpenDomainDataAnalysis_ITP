		<title>16WILDLIFE IN LITTLE BADDOW</title>
		<content>   The area surrounding the village of 
 Little Baddow is rich in wildlife.    
 This is mainly due to the many        
 unspoilt areas of woodland and        
 grassland.                            
   The large areas of deciduous        
 woodland provide homes for a host of  
 small animals including hedgehogs,    
 squirrels and badgers. A wide variety 
 of British bird life can also be      
 spotted; it is common to see Jays,    
 Woodpeckers, and many species of Owls.
 Keen amateur ornitholgists frequent   
 the area. As yet, however, there are  
 no permanent facilities for bird      
 watching.                             
   Equally, the grassland areas attract
 hares, stoats, foxes and rabbits.     
 Hopefully in the future there will be 
 enough interest in the ecology of the 
 area to create a nature reserve.
