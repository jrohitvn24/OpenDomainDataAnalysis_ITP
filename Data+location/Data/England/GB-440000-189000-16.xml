		<title>16THE DAIRY</title>
		<content>Basildon dairy is on the Wantage to    
Oxford road, next door to Elm Farm.They
employ about 100 people.At this dairy  
they make  cream and yogurt. The large 
tankers arrive everyday with the milk  
which is then made into cream and      
yogurt. Fruit is then added to the     
yogurt which is pumped into a machine  
which has the cups and lids waiting for
the yogurts, when the yogurts has been 
pumped into the cups the machine moves 
the cups on to have the lids put on and
heat sealed and then the sell by date  
stamped on.The finished  yogurt pots   
are then packed into a box of 12 and   
sent the cold store which is then sent 
out to the shops.
