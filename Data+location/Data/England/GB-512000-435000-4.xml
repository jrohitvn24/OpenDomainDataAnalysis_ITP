		<title>04Population Coniston/Swine</title>
		<content> Coniston's (1983) population of 270 is
 a peculiar blend of 'old' and 'new'.  
 The former are mainly agricultural    
 workersor of elderly country folk who 
 live in the heart of the village      
 itself. The 'new' element comprise a  
 more modern generation of Hull        
 commuters living in newer houses      
 bordering the main A165 Hull to       
 Bridlington road. Curiously the two   
 communities keep to themselves and the
 commuters rarely take part in village 
 activities or use its amenities. Swine
 is a dead end village with its (1983) 
 population of 170 country folk living 
 in attractive 18th and 19th century   
 brick cottages strung along its single
 street. The whole area is extremely   
 isolated,but all the inhabitants      
 appear to be content in living there  
 and none would admit to welcoming     
 change in its status or environment.  </content>
