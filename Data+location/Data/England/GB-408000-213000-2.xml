   There are 640 acres on this mainly  
 arable farm, 596 of these are farm    
 acres. 107 are permanent pasture. The 
 sheep (146 acres) are his own breed,  
 basically Cambridge cross Freisian, 24
 sucklers, 6 heifers in calf  and 24   
 calves at about 1 year old. There are 
 also 30 acres of woodland, 185 acres  
 of winter wheat, 201 acres of winter  
 barley and 98 acres of spring barley, 
 making a total of 484 acres of cereal 
 crop. Last year 36 tons of the grain  
 produced was for fodder, the rest was 
 sold. A lot of modern machinery is    
 used on the farm. There are 5         
 cottages, 3 of which are lived in,    
 with 4-5 staff. Colonel Jenkins has   
 farmed for 28 years and enjoys it, but
 does not know what the farming future 
 will bring.
