		<content> Very little exists in the way of      
 organised recreation and most people  
 of the block look to Barrow,Dalton or 
 Ulverston for this.The village hall is
 a social centre and in the case of    
 Leece has bingo sessions and films for
 children on Saturdays.At Xmas the hall
 is the scene of the Xmas party.The    
 only scout and guide groups are at    
 Gleaston.The tarn at Leece is used by 
 anglers and fish include perch,tench  
 and roach.The green near the tarn is  
 the site of the village bonfire and   
 the summer fete which has children's  
 sports and stalls.The church hall at  
 Dendron runs a Sunday school and a    
 branch of the Mothers' Union.The two  
 pubs near Leece and Gleaston provide  
 recreation in the form of cards,darts,
 pool etc.
