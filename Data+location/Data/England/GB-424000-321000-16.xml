		<title>16Burton Market</title>
		<content>     On Thursdays, Fridays and         
Saturdays the Market is held in the    
town.   The Market Place is in the town
centre, across the road from the       
Shopping Centre, and in front of St.   
Modwen's, the Parish Church.   On      
Market Days the place is filled with   
little stalls, each with their canvas  
covers, selling almost anything from   
buckets to bracelets, from sacks to    
saucepans.   There is a plan to        
"smarten up" the market, but this is   
opposed by some stallholders who think 
that this will threaten the tradition  
of the market, although many people    
think that it is about time something  
was done to improve the rather tatty   
appearance.   As well as the large open
market, there is also a covered Market 
Hall, and a separate but smaller Fish  
Market.
