		<content> Easington is divided into towo        
 villages, Easington Village and       
 Easington Colliery. They are connected
 by the B1203 road which is called     
 Seaside Lane. This is the main road   
 which runs through the middle of      
 Easington Colliery. Most of the shops 
 are on either side of Seaside Lane.   
 There are many different kinds of     
 shops. Easington Colliery is a mining 
 community. It is situated on the      
 Durham coast about half way between   
 Sunderland and Hartlepool. It has a   
 population of about 10000 people.     
 Until 1900 the land which is now      
 covered by the Colliery was entirely  
 farm land. A rough path led down to   
 the sea from Easington Village and    
 this later became Seaside Lane.
