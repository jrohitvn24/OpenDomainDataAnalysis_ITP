		<content> We are a fourth year class at Hunslet 
 Middle School.We did a survey to find 
 out how many people had an interest in
 making music.                         
  Five of us play musical instruments: 
 clarinet, organ, viola, violin,       
 trumpet, piano or recorder. Amanda    
 plays three different instruments.    
 Henry went to Germany this year with  
 the{South Leeds Music Centre}.He      
 stayed with a German family and played
 in a number of Concerts. The Music    
 Centre meets every Saturday at Hugh   
 Gaitskell Middle School during term   
 time.                                 
   Richard is a chorister in Leeds     
 Parish Church. This takes up a great  
 deal of his time as he has to attend  
 evening practices everyday. He sings  
 in many concerts and sometimes goes on
 concert tours.
