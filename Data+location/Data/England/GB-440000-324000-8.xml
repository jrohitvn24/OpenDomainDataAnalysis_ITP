		<content> Isley Walton is a small farming       
 community centred around the village  
 church. It is situated close to the   
 East Midlands Airport, Donington Park 
 Racing Circuit and the M1 motorway.   
 There are no amenities in the village 
 and residents must travel to          
 Melbourne, Breedon or Castle Donington
 for all their requirements.           
 Two farms in Isley Walton, High Barn  
 and Donington Park Farm offer         
 traditional English Farmhouse Style   
 bed and breakfast to visitors. Ease   
 of access to the many historic sites  
 in the East Midlands and to several   
 large country houses, which are open  
 to the public, is attracting          
 increasing numbers of tourists to the 
 area.
