		<title>09SIKH COMMUNITY CENTRE.</title>
		<content>   There are approximately 6 000       
 Asians in Leamington Spa, of whom 90% 
 are Sikhs.                            
   The Sikh community has a newly-built
 temple in New Street, and has recently
 bought a large Church Hall nearby.    
 Renovations cost Â£200 000 and the     
 centre now contains two large halls, a
 stage, a kitchen, a meeting room, a   
 classroom and an office.              
   The centre, which is run by a       
 committee, holds a variety of         
 activities for the Sikhs including a  
 day centre for old people where social
 activities are held and meals         
 provided. Classes in Bhangra dancing  
 and Indian music are held. Punjabi    
 language classes for young people held
 every weekday evening are particularly
 important and free of charge.Although 
 used primarily by the Asian community 
 it is open to everyone.               </content>
