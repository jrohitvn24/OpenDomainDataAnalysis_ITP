		<title>16An Ordinary Day (Cont.)</title>
		<content> youngest member is 14 and our oldest  
 is 50 and still teaching us a thing or
 two!                                  
                                       
 I usually have lunch with a           
 girlfriend, usually just a snack and a
 chat over coffee. The children eat at 
 school and I cook for all the family  
 in the evening.                       
                                       
 After lunch I drive down to the local 
 shops if there is anything  I need for
 today's meal, but the bulk of my      
 shopping is done in the supermarkets  
 in one of the nearby towns. Prices    
 there are very competitive and the    
 range of commodities available is much
 wider. I spend one whole day a week   
 shopping. After the supermarkets I    
 spend my time looking around the      
 numerous other shops for clothing and 
 other items for the family.           </content>
