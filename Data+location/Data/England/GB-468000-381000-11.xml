		<content> The Grt.N.Rd.was routed through       
 Retford in 1777 and brought travellers
 and merchants to our market town.They 
 needed somewhere to stay and so       
{coaching Inns}were built.More hotels  
 and Inns were built; Ye Olde Sun,Vine 
 Inn,Newcastle Arms and the White Hart 
 are still in business.                
 The Packet Inn and the Hop Pole       
 provide food and drink for adults and 
 children.Both places are{tow-path }   
 Inns with play areas for  children.   
 The only major hotel ,mentioned in the
 National Guides,is the West Retford   
 Hotel.It is Retford's{largest hotel}  
 and also provides morning coffee and  
{restaurant facilities}.               
 The coaching Inns are located near the
 Market Square beside the banks and    
 shops.The canal -side Inns are further
 out from the Square.The West Retford  
 is located on the A638,(Grt.N.Rd.)    </content>
