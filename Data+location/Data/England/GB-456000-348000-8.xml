		<content> Every June we have a{Pingle Party.    
 There are many activities that        
 you can take part in, for example     
 darts,treasure hunt and hit the mouse.
 Every year there are demonstrations   
 for the older ones,{BMX}etc.For the   
 younger ones there is a{bouncy castle,
{swings and Punch and Judy.}There are  
 cakes and drinks for{refreshments.    
 Every body enjoys themselves. This    
 year there was a BMX demonstration.   
 The bouncy castle and the swing boats 
 were supposed to come but they        
 didn't.The refreshments were in the   
 hall and a{jazz band}came.The band    
 were from Calverton and they played   
 many tunes. One game was to guess the 
 weight of the pig. The pig was small  
 but it was very heavy . This was 10p a
 go. The person who guessed the correct
 weight won.It was great fun.
