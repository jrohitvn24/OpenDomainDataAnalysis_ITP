		<content> THERE IS NO CHURCH IN THE GRID AREA OF
 SPRATTON BUT PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE    
 ATTEND THE ANGLICAN CHURCH IN THE     
 VILLAGE OR GO INTO KINGSTHORPE IF THEY
 ARE NONCONFORMISTS. ROMAN CATHOLICS IN
 THE AREA ATTEND EITHER THE CATHEDRAL  
 IN NORTHAMPTON OR THE CHURCH IN       
 DUSTON.                               
 HOLDENBY HAS A CHURCH BUT HAS NO      
 INCUMBENT ONLY OCCASIONAL SERVICES ARE
 HELD THERE SUCH AS CHRISTMAS AND      
 HARVEST FESTIVAL. THE ROOF HAS        
 RECENTLY BEEN RESTORED AND PAID FOR BY
 THE REDUNDANT CHURCHES FUND.          
 ATTENDANCE AT CHURCHES IS LOW BUT IN  
 PROPORTION TO THE POPULATION IS MUCH  
 HIGHER THAN IN TOWNS. THE CHRISTIAN   
 ETHIC IS NEVERTHELESS PRACTISED AS IS 
 EVIDENT IN CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND   
 PEOPLE IN DIFFICULTIES.
