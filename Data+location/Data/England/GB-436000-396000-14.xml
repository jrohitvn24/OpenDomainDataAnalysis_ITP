		<title>14A Walk To Harley</title>
		<content> It was a warm sunny{morning}as we set 
 off to{walk}to{Harley.}We had caught  
 the{bus}to{Wentworth}and now we were  
 going to do the rest on{foot.}We      
 turned left past the{village school   
 and walked down{Churchfield Lane.}It  
 was a very quiet lane that cars didn't
{normally}use. Hedges lined the lane on
 each side and over the hedges we could
 see fields of{wheat.}There was also a 
 field full of{peas.}After a while we  
 passed{Ashes Farm}and there were cows 
 out in the field. We were going down  
 quite a steep hill now towards{Oak    
{Tree Cottage.}The cottage has been    
 modernised and it looked very pretty. 
 Now the lane turned right to{Harley   
 We passed a field where they were     
 cutting{hay}and there was a strong    
 sweet smell.Trees grew on either side 
 of the lane as we at last reached     
 Harley. We all needed a rest now.     </content>
