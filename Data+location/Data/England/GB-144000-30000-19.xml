		<title>19INFANT SCHOOL-ASSEMBLIES.</title>
		<content>  At our Infant School we help to take 
 Assemblies on two days a week.All the 
 children come into the Hall and join  
 in.Those who help go to the front.We  
 sing hymns.We have a piano,and one    
 teacher plays a guitar.               
  We make up our own prayers to God.   
 Sometimes we act stories from the     
 Bible.We draw pictures and show them  
 to everyone.                          
  For the last Assembly before we go to
 Junior School,we remembered what we   
 did while we have been at this school.
 We remembered our first days at       
 school,and learning to read and write.
  We remembered the fun of Christmas   
 concerts and parties;going on Nature  
 walks and studying the trees in the   
 playground.                           
  We enjoyed a visit from actors who   
 acted"Alice in Wonderland".We gave God
 thanks for happy times at our school.L</content>
