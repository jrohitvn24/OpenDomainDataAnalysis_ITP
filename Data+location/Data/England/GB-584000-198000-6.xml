 The Three Rivers country club has 120 
 acres and  at the moment has up       
 to 2300 members.  There               
 are 20 staff that work full time .The 
 membership card costs the family Â£50. 
 The club was built in 1973 and        
 before that year most of the land     
 on which the club now stands was      
 used as farmland. The busiest days of 
 the week are usually  Fridays and     
 Saturdays.  The THREE RIVERS has      
 tennis ,golf ,swimming ,squash &amp;      
 snooker as their sports and  are      
 hoping to get bowling ,a gym,         
 badminton and indoor bowls .On 1      
 of the golf hills you can see three   
 rivers  which are the {CROUCH},the    
 CHELMAR and the{BLACKWATER}.Thats how 
 the THREE RIVERS got its name.
