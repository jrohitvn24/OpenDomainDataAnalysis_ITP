		<title>19Well House Inn, Chipstead</title>
		<content>     There are three{Puplic Houses}in  
 the area: two of them in Lower        
 Kingswood, but the oldest and most    
 popular is the Well House Inn near    
 Chipstead (to the east of Kingswood). 
 The pub takes its name from the well  
 in its garden. Although an old        
 building it has only been a pub since 
 the last century when a group of local
 farmers made a petition for the       
 original{tea-rooms}to be granted a    
 licence to sell alcoholic drinks,     
     Today the pub. can boast a{good   
{trade,}people travel from all over the
 locality to enjoy a drink in pleasant 
 historic surroundings. It is usually  
 quite full at lunchtimes (when{bar    
{meals}are served) and each evening. It
 is especially popular during the      
 summer months when customers like to  
 sit outside in the pub's attractive   
{garden}at the rear of the pub..       </content>
