		<title>11HONINGTON 40 YEARS AGO</title>
		<content>  The village of Honington had, until  
 1924, belonged to the family who lived
 at{Honington Hall.}After the village  
 had been sold off in small lots, the  
 Hall continued to provide employment  
 for the village.                      
  The{population}of Honington is about 
 120,the same as 40 years ago.         
  The village{houses}have changed      
 considerably.Three small cottages,for 
 example,were modernised and converted 
 into one house.Other cottages were    
 demolished and modern houses built in 
 their place.                          
  In 1945,the{village school}had two   
 teachers and about 20 children.In 1973
 it closed and the children from the   
 village now attend Shipston-on-Stour  
 Junior and Infant School.The school   
 building was sold and converted into a
 house.
