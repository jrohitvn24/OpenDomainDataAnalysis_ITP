		<content>           {New to Kenton              
{ }Its only my second day in Kenton and
 my first morning at school. My first  
 impression of Kenton was a quiet      
 village,I think I was right. At first 
 I didnt like the idea of going to a   
 small school now I think its nice. I  
 think the people here are friendly.   
 The fourth year girls have been kind  
 to me. I prefer Kenton from Shrewsbury
 because its quieter and it has nicer  
 surroundings. I prefer my house at    
 Kenton because its bigger and more    
 modern than my other house. I like the
 way you can walk into the country at  
 any time. We moved to Devon because of
 my Dads job. He works in a bank in    
 Exeter. Im looking forward to being   
 able to go to the sea because its so  
 close. Before we had to go to Wales to
 get to the seaside.
