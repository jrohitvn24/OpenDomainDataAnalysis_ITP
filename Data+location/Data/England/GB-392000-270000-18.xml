		<title>18THE MARKET, BROMSGROVE</title>
		<content>    The market area is a very old part 
 of Bromsgrove and plans are being made
 for its future. One of the plans to   
 modernise it was to have an under-    
 ground car park below a shopping      
 centre all under one roof. Then when  
 it was revealed in the papers, critics
 said that it was ugly. The council was
 trying to get a large retail firm to  
 take an interest in developing the    
 site, but local opinion favours       
 retaining the market in its           
 traditional form. There were a lot of 
 protests so it seems the plans have   
 been dropped for the time being.      
    I think the market should take up  
 the whole car park area as well. In   
 the basement should be a car park,    
 with a market with stalls as they are 
 now, and finally there should be a    
 cinema, supermarkets and other shops  
 above the market.                     </content>
