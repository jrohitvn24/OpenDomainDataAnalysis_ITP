		<title>13THE CITY</title>
		<content>Being on the outskirts of birmingham   
our area contains a lot recreation     
grounds. The houses are spread out and 
the roads are lined with trees. But    
however, some of these areas are under 
theat from constuction companies, who  
wa build car parks for the rapidly     
expanding Northfield shopping centre.  
If this did happen, the area would gain
trade, but loss some of it's character.
The Austin Leyland car factory in      
Longbridge is the pollutant of the air 
in the south Birmingham area. The      
leylan may be a heavy pollutant, but it
also provides the most jobs in the     
area. After 8.00pm when the men finish 
work the traffic slows up in the rush  
hour tot home.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
