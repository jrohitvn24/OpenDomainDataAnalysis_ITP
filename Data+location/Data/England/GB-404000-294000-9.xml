		<title>09   FARMING</title>
		<content> In the four most northerly squares    
 there are{seven farms.}This area has  
 been farmland for{many years.}One farm
 has a date stone inscribed 1799 built 
 into a wall and has been owned by the 
 same family for three generations.    
 Some of the fields are cultivated     
 grassland but the farmer also grows a 
 variety of vegetables and people pay  
 to graze horses too. Sometimes a      
 farrier comes on a Saturday to shoe   
 horses. Other farms also graze horses,
 sheep and cattle, and have some       
 cultivated grassland. One farm with an
 old black and white timbered farmhouse
 called The Old Hall, has 28 calves, 6 
 goats, 40 sheep, 36 hens and 15 pigs. 
 Another farm is a dairy farm, and has 
 l7,000 hens and 9 beef cattle. The    
 farmer runs a milk delivery service   
 and also sells milk and eggs to shops.
