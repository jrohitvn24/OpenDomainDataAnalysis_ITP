		<content> There was a small free school for the 
 poor children in the area in 1811.    
 This school was established by the    
 Turner family.                        
                                       
 In 1866 a new school was built by Mrs 
 Newcomen who also paid for the Parish 
 Church. Then in 1876 the management of
 the school was taken over by the      
 Kirkleatham School Board and then by  
 the Church. The Coatham Church of     
 England school was used as a school   
 until 1969 when it, together with     
 Warrenby School, was closed. A new    
 Primary School was built 200 yards    
 away.                                 
                                       
 This  school was opened by the        
 Archbishop of York on October 10th    
 1969. At present there are 198        
 children and 7 teachers. The          
 Headmaster is Mr. T. Reeve.           </content>
