		<title>12Teacher's Day in N.St Ives.</title>
		<content> Our teacher begins his day at         
 approximately six fifteen when he is  
 awoken by the chatter of his two      
 daughters.He baths his youngest       
 daughter,and then organises breakfast.
  He makes sure he has got everything  
 for  school by 8.00.Then its a 15     
 minute drive. When he gets there he   
 finishes work from the night before,  
 answers the telephone and chats to    
 colleagues.                           
 Lessons begin at 9.00 and he usually  
 teaches maths until 10.10.If he is on 
 duty he has his coffee on the         
 playground.Then its launguage until   
 12.00 and sometimes P.E or swimming.  
 After a quickly eaten sandwich he     
 marks books and prepares lessons.     
 He teaches projects in the afternoon  
 and finishes with story until 3.15.He 
 then  works until 5.15,when he returns
 home to work with his own children!   </content>
