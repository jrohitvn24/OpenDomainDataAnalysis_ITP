		<title>01Bakewell - An Introduction</title>
		<content>     Bakewell is  a  rural market town 
 situated in the High Peak district of 
 Derbyshire.    The  surrounding  area 
 included  in  this block consists  of 
 meadow which is used for agricultural 
 purposes.                             
     There is in the area  a fine late 
 medieval building, Haddon Hall, owned 
 by the Duke of Rutland, who also owns 
 a large amount  of  agricultural land 
 in the area. In Bakewell itself,  you 
 will find  many  examples of Georgian 
 and Jacobean architecture.            
     Today, Bakewell's  prime function 
 is  as  a  centre  of  trade  for the 
 surrounding villages and hamlets.     
     Its situation on the A6, the main 
 route way in  Derbyshire,  means that 
 it is  a prime market town  and  also 
 an important centre for tourism.
