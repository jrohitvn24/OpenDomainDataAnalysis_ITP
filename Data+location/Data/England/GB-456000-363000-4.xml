		<content>  The Scots pine and the Corsican pine 
 were planted in 1954 by the Forestry  
 Commission and deciduous trees were   
 planted in 1958 and 1960 to make the  
 wood look pleasant.                   
  At present the Forestry Commission   
 are clear felling crops of pine when  
 they are about 60 years old,so this   
 could happen to Intake Wood in        
 2000-2020.When the trees are small    
 about 25-30 years old the timber is   
 used for pulp wood and farm fencing   
 materials,At 60 years old the wood is 
 used for mining timber.
