 silent march in the dark,just like the
 Duke of Monmouth's men,to the         
 battlefield to see if there really    
 were ghosts on the field.No sighting s
 were reported!This was followed next  
 day by all of the children young &amp; old

 dancing ,pageant and battle           
 re-enactment.The day was rounded off  
 by presentation of special Somerset   
 Cider Mugs by the P.T.A.'s to everyone
