Our 2011 survey was confined to the children of Year 6 at the village school. All households have at least one car. Three had 4 cars, 4 had 3 cars, 20 had 2 cars, and only four had just one.  The most popular makes were Ford (8), BMW (5), VW (5), and Toyota (3).  Other makes were Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar, Jowett, Kia, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, MG, Nissan, Peugeot, Renault, Range Rover, Rover, Subaru, Suzuki, Vauxhall and Volvo.  Most parents use their cars to go to work outside the village.   &lt;br />
