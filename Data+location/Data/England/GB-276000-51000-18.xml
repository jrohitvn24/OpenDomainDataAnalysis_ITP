		<content> No provision has been made in either  
 Halwell or Moreleigh for an occasional
 surgery, therefore all residents have 
 to travel to Totnes,10kms,for medical 
 advice.  The Hospital Car Service is  
 available for those having to attend  
 Torbay hospital.  Health Visitors and 
 District Nurses visit inhabitants when
 necessary.  Dental treatment is       
 available in Totnes or Kingsbridge.
