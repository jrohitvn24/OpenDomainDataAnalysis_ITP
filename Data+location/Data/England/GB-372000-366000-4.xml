		<content>      Many years ago the vicar from the
 church in Holmes Chapel would ride on 
 horseback from his vicarage to church.
 Now he has a much more modern         
 house,and of course a car.The old     
 vicarage has been modernised and      
 extended and is now a hotel and       
 restaurant called "The Old Vicarage"! 
 There is a much smaller inn on        
 Middlewich Road which also serves     
 meals.                                
      The other notable building in the
 area is the animal feed factory. This 
 used to be a mill powered by the River
 Dane. Now the mill is no longer there,
 but has been replaced by other factory
 buildings and storage units.          
      There are also two churches in   
 the area, the Methodist Church and a  
 nineteeth century chapel. The church  
 is on the Holmes Chapel Cranage       
 border,the chapel is for the farms.   </content>
