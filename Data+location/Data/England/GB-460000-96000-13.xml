		<content>      Although not yet fully restored  
 to its former glory an enormous amount
 of work has been completed, including 
 a new landing stage which enabled     
 visitors to embark and disembark in   
 safety.                               
      There is a well where fresh water
 was obtained from a depth of over 400 
 metres and is still in working order. 
 Also you can see the Victorian cooking
 ranges, an old forge (which were still
 in use during World War 2).           
      On the second floor several of   
 the rooms have been converted into a  
 cafe.  You can take part in one of the
 conducted tours and come and lose     
 yourself in a maze of passages and    
 tunnels(the children loved it!)
