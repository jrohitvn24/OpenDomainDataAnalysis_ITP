 prefered{clubs}to pubs and that the   
 most popular local was the Rose and   
 Crown because of its cosy and friendly
 atmosphere.People went there to meet  
 their friends.The people have many    
{leisure activities}ranging from music,
 jogging,keeping fit to wine making,   
 golf,squash and even sea angling.Many 
 of the ladies like a frame of bingo   
 and most play once weekly.Only one    
 person interviewed did not have a     
{television}and quite a few have a     
 video which they use very often.Most

 hotel,others enjoy hiking,camping and 
 caravaning.The cinema has declined few
 people go regularly.Favorite T.V.     
 programmes are the "soap operas" such 
 as 'Dallas'.Sport is very popular.    </content>
