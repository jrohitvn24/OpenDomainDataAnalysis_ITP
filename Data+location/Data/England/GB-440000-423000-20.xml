		<content> In the River Aire fish have adapted   
 well to the polluted water which is   
 now clearing.There are various fish   
 like the bream,common perch,roach,    
 sticklebacks and minnows. The town    
 centre has increased its bird and     
 animal life.There are now house       
 martins and swifts nesting under      
 gutterings and slates.You may also see
 kestrels hovering overhead.Pit        
 closures have meant that the face of  
 stacks have been grassed over again.It
 has increased the wildlife there.You  
 may see hares,rabbits,kestrels,       
 skylarks and rats. There is also a    
 stream with frogs and small fish and  
 some of the stack has been taken over 
 by a farmer so his cows can graze on  
 it.
