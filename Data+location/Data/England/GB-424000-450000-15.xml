		<content>   Our local{Manor House}dates back to 
 medieval times,with reported remains  
 of a{Viking Dwelling.                 
{ }The house itself is now two storeys 
 high, but at one time had a third,    
 the local story tells of how the      
 lady of the manor wanted to follow    
 fashion, and had the third storey     
 removed.                              
  The house incorporates a{medieval    
{wall,}and when repairs were being     
 carried out, flattened bullets were   
 found in the mortar joints of the     
 exterior walls.  These are believed to
 have been from the time of the{Civil  
{War,}when there was a garrison at     
 Knaresborough Castle, who raided local
 houses in search of booty and         
 provisions                            
   The Kent family still live there as 
 their ancestors have done before them 
 for well over 150 years               </content>
