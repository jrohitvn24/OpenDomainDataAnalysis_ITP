		<title>12MY HOLIDAYS ---- JAKE</title>
		<content> We like camping holidays in tents.We  
 usually go to France and there is a   
 campsite we particularly like.We have 
 become good friends with the owners   
 there.Last time we went on holiday in 
 Corsica,an island off the coast of    
 France.It was very hot and we got a   
 very good sun tan! We stayed a week   
 and we went to the beach every day.At 
 one beach we could walk out to sea for
 two hundred metres.Holidays give the  
 mind a rest from working.They help you
 relax and that makes you feel better.
