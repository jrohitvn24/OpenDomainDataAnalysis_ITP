		<content>{ROLLS ROYCE, CREWE.}                  
 The Rolls Royce is one of the best    
 cars in the World.The factory that    
 builds them is one of the main        
 employers in Crewe.                   
 If you wanted to buy a Rolls Royce you
 would have to be rich or famous,-or   
 both,as they are very expensive       
 indeed. The reason they are so        
 expensive is because most of the car  
 is{handmade.}They are also built from 
 the{finest materials. A Silver Flying 
{Lady}is mounted on the radiator grill 
 of each car.                          
 In the mornings and evenings thousands
 of{cyclists}crowd the roads as they go
 to and from the Rolls Royce and nearby
{B.R.E.L.}works. There are more bikes  
 on the road in Crewe than anywhere    
 else in the country.                  
 Rolls Royce and the railways are what 
 Crewe is most famous for.             </content>
