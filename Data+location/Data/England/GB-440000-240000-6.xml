		<content>Tuesday is Scout night. I go to the 2nd
Banbury Group, because there is not a  
scout pack on the Bretch Hill Estate.  
We wear a uniform which is a green     
shirt, oak coloured trousers with a    
belt, green beret, and a neckerchief.  
The neckerchiefs are two coloured and  
each group has its own colours.        
Scouts start at age 11 and goes on     
until 16 when you can become a Venture 
Scout. At scouts we work to get badges.
There are many sorts such as the       
computer, cycling, camping, and        
sportsman badge. At pack meetings we   
also play games and somtimes visit     
other places such as the police station
Each Summer we have a pack holiday.    
This year we are camping in            
Warwickshire.
