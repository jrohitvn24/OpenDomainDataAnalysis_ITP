		<content> Much leisure time is now spent within 
 the home, television being the main   
 source of entertainment. Films have   
 become available on video and many    
 shops have opened in our area where   
 people can hire a film on tape for a  
 night or two and watch it at home on  
 their own machine.                    
  Local theatre is now totally amateur,
 and all local cinemas have either     
 closed down or become bingo halls.    
 Denton has a new swimming pool but    
 Hyde's has closed as it was old and   
 unsafe. There are snooker halls,karate
 and judo clubs,and several health and 
 fitness centres. Several local cricket
 clubs play in weekend leagues and Hyde
 United football team play in a senior 
 professional league.Many local public 
 houses provide live entertainment     
 especially at weekends.
