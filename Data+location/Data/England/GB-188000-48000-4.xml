		<content>  Ladock River has two branches. One   
 branch rises on Trefullock Moor and   
 flows past Brighton Cross and through 
 New Mills to join the other branch    
 just east of Ladock. This branch flows
 from Mitchell through Arrallas and    
 Ladock Woods. West of Ladock it       
 becomes Tresillian river which runs   
 past St.Clements to join the Truro    
 River at Malpas. This in turn joins   
 the River Fal and then flows into the 
 sea at Falmouth.                      
  By the Parish Hall we dropped a piece
 of wood into the water and it floated 
 down river. It took 2 minutes and 10  
 seconds to go 27 paces. At the bridge 
 by the chapel Irwin dropped a stick   
 into the water from the left arch on  
 the bridge. It took 1 minute 41       
 seconds. At Arrallas bridge it took 51
 seconds. We found out that the flow   
 gets slower as it goes down river.    </content>
