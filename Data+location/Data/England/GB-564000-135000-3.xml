		<title>03  Housing in Lamberhurst</title>
		<content>    The{Housing}in this village shows  
 great diversity in age and styles of  
 architecture.                         
  { The Charity}on School Hill is an   
 example of Wealden Hall House, built  
 in four bays between 1480 and 1550    
 with the centre chimney added later in
 the 16th century. The structural      
 timber framing is exposed on the front
 and side elevations. The northern     
 jettied end was the family living area
 with a dragon_beamed ceiling. The hall
 was in the centre two bays with the   
 domestic quarters to the south. In    
 1648 it became the parish workhouse   
 and in later years the cellar was used
 as the lock_up, the iron bars still   
 being evident in the side street.     
 Three families live there now.        
    The{Conservation Area}includes the 
 interesting Coggers Hall and Cottages.
