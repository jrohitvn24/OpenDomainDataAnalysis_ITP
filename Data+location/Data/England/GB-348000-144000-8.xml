		<title>08Worth House Hotel</title>
		<content>  The Worth House Hotel, which includes
 the Stable Door Restaurant, is        
 situated in Worth 4 kilometres from   
 Wells on the B3l39 road. Owned by the 
 Mason family it is typical of the     
 establishments which have lost their  
 previous farming functions and which  
 now offer food and accommodation for  
 the benefit of tourists in this part  
 of Somerset. It is surrounded by open 
 country and has extensive views of the
 Mendip Hills.                         
  The house itself retains the charm of
 a dwelling which, in part, is 4OO     
 years old, complete with beamed       
 ceilings and exposed stone walls. It  
 has first-class centrally-heated      
 accommodation, three lounges, colour  
 TV, a large lawned garden and ample   
 parking. The owners take pride in     
 offering fresh home cooking to their  
 guests.                               </content>
