 Here are some questions which we asked
 in order to get the information       
 on page four.                         
                                       
                                       
 1 Are you shopping here today?        
 2 How did you get here?               
 3 How often do you come here to shop? 
 4 Would you buy your daily needs here?
 5 Would you buy clothes here?         
 6 Would you buy your furniture?       
 7 Where do you live?                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
 In conclusion,we think there should be
 more shops in more places.
