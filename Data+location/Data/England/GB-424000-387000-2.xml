		<content> In the area around Dungworth there is 
 both a cub and brownie pack.In the    
 summer a youth club meets for a 7 to  
 11 age group and a 12 to 16 age group.
                                       
 Most of the employment is in farming.A
 few as labourers but generally as a   
 family or group of families working on
 their own or rented land and selling  
 their livestock,crops or milk         
 directly. A few of the inhabitants    
 work in Sheffield or Stannington.     
                                       
 In this area there are no schools or  
 colleges but there is a school just   
 outside the area in Dungworth where   
 younger children go. The number of    
 pupils is 40. The nearest             
 secondary school is in Bradfield.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
