		<content> On Monday at 17:30 I go to Brownies at
 Bainton with my friend Alexandra. We  
 do handicrafts, work towards our      
 proficiency badges, collect things or 
 play games. At 19:00 my mum collects  
 us in our Mecedes car. This year ,to  
 celebrate 75 years of Guiding, we went
 to Brownies Revels at Uppingham. We   
 had tea, played games and sang songs. 
 On Wednesday at 17:00 I go to Tap-    
 Dancing class at the Welland School of
 Dancing in Stamford. First we do a    
 warming up exerise and then do several
 routines to perform to our parents. On
 Friday I go to ballet classes in      
 Stamford. We wear leotards with net   
 skirts and ballet shoes. First we do  
 warming exercises at the barre. Then  
 we practice various steps and dance   
 routines. I am now in Grade 1 for both
 tap dance and ballet.
