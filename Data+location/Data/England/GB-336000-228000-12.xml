		<title>12FARMING</title>
		<content> Most of the farming in this area is   
{mixed,}with arable, dairy and sheep   
 together on the same farms. A lot of  
 the land is{hilly}and too steep for   
 tractors. Mr Lloyd is one of our local
 farmers. His 160 acre farm produces   
 many varieties of crops -{potatoes,   
{swedes, wheat and grass}- and he has  
 100{Friesian}cattle and 120{sheep     
 which he sells at{Hereford market.}Mrs
 Lloyd teaches at Ewyas Harold school  
 and they have 4 sons, two working on  
 the farm and two at school, but all   
 the family is needed to work the farm.
 Mr Lloyd usually gets up at 6 o'clock 
 and his first job is to feed his      
 calves, but most of his time is taken 
 up with his potatoes and corn crop. He
 usually works until 10 o'clock at     
 night but at busy times of the year he
 will get up earlier and work later.
