		<content> Inglesbatch is a small hamlet in the  
 parish of Englishcombe about two miles
 outside the Bath city boundary.       
  The hamlet is dominated by the two   
 farms: Homefarm and Inglesbatch farm. 
 The remainder of the houses are either
 owner occupied or tied houses         
 belonging to the farms; about sixteen 
 in total. Inglesbatch Farm house is   
 the largest house in the area and was 
 the former Manor house. Part of this  
 house is four to five hundred years   
 old. In a nearby field Roman platforms
 have been found.                      
  All the houses are of stone          
 construction under slate or tiled     
 roofs.                                
 The two farms employ about half the   
 working population. The remainder     
 travel into the city of Bath.         
 Large areas of the surrounding land is
 owned by the Duchy of Cornwall        </content>
