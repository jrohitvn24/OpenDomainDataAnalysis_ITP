		<title>05TEKELS PARK.</title>
		<content> Tekels Park consists of about 59 acres
 of land, grassland and houses. The    
 Estate was formed around a large      
 castle, built in the 19th Century,    
 called Tekels Castle. Squire Tekel,   
 the original owner,used the castle as 
 a hunting lodge until 1863, when 333  
 acres of the park (including much of  
 Camberley at that time) were bought by
 a Mr C. Knight. He built the Cambridge
 Hotel, and many roads in Camberley.   
 The Castle grounds held stables and   
 had peacocks and ornamental gardens-  
 although the castle was burnt to the  
 ground in 1910 most of the gardens    
 still remain, and traces of the       
 original castle too, although the     
 estate has diminished in size. The    
 park is now owned by the Theosophical 
 Society, who own a guest house on the 
 site.
