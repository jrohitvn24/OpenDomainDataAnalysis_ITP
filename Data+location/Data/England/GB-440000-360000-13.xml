		<title>13OUR PILSLEY PIG FARM</title>
		<content> I live on a farm in Pilsley but I go  
 to school in Tibshelf. My house has   
 got 22 rooms, not including the       
 cellars and attics. It was built in   
 the eighteenth century.               
 We keep pigs and cows. We breed our   
 own pigs. A sow can have any number of
 piglets - anything from four to about 
 twenty-four. The last piglet to be    
 born  is usually the weakest of the   
 litter and sometimes this one dies.   
 When the piglets are born they go     
 under a heat lamp to make them strong 
 and healthy.                          
 We have about 25 sheds full of pigs.  
 We have got four boars and they are   
 huge. The biggest one of them is about
 2\ metres long from nose to tail.     
 My dad works from about 5 o'clock in  
 the morning until ten at night in the 
 summer. I often help with the farm    
 work.                   by Claire (11)</content>
