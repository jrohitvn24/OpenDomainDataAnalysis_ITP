		<title>13How Whittlesey has changed</title>
		<content>   In just five years the town that I  
  live in has changed in many ways.    
   These are just some of the changes  
 that I have noticed.                  
   In 1980 there were more grave stones
 in St Marys churchyard than there are 
 now. They have been moved to the edge 
 to make a park.                       
   The buttercross has been repaired   
 and they have opened a small town     
 museum.                               
   Where I play now has changed since  
 1980 because it wasn't a park then, it
 was a road. The brick works is fairly 
 old but by it was a field 2 or 3 years
 ago, now it's a massive hole with long
 tunnels, large boulders diggers and   
 stack's of brick's.                   
   Between our school and the church   
 was a field where horses used to be   
 kept.  Now it has been used to build  
 houses on .                           </content>
