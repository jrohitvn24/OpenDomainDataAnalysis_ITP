		<title>02Farming survey - Stambourne</title>
		<content> With the co-operation of Toppesfield  
 and Stambourne farmers,we undertook a 
 farming survey.Of the 2145 acres sur- 
 veyed,almost 1300 (60%) were used for 
 wheat and a further 267 for other     
 cereals.Oilseed rape accounted for 320
 acres.Comparatively small quantities  
 of peas and spring beans (40 and 96   
 acres respectively) were grown.The    
 most unusual crop was lupins,grown for
 animal fodder.Practically all land is 
 drained.Each farm had at least one    
 combine harvester and from 2-8 tract- 
 ors at a ratio of approx.1:100 acres. 
 Stubble burning was less prevalent    
 than previously but only one farmer   
 had abandoned this completely. Two    
 farmers kept a total of 40 beef cattle
 plus calves.There were only 76 acres  
 of woodland.The largest farm employed 
 4 whole-time workers and the smallest 
 was run by the farmer single-handed.  </content>
