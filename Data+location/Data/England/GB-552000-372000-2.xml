		<title>02Chapel St.Leonards Tourism</title>
		<content> In Chapel St.Leonards tourism is very 
 popular with caravan sites and        
 camping sites because of the lovely   
 beach and the chalets along the top of
 the beach .We have caravans behind the
 Village Hall and there is usually a   
 camping exhibition. The biggest site  
 is the Robin Hood Camp which is just  
 out of Chapel St.Leonards.Most people 
 spend the days on the beach.If they   
 have children they have rides on the  
 donkeys.Most people have a car or came
 on a coach for a week.there's Millers 
 Amusement Centre in the Village with  
 many shops,food shops and toy shops.
