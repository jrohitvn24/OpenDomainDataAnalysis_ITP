		<title>08A Laceby survey</title>
		<content> A small survey of Laceby has shown    
 that most people came to live here    
 because they liked living in the      
 countryside and they liked living     
 here.Most people used the library but 
 half said they used it only           
 occasionally.All the people used the  
 local shops and most thought that they
 where conveniently situated and that  
 the prices compared very favourably   
 with town shops.People though there   
 was a need for a hardware shop and a  
 chemist shop.They were satisfied with 
 the local schools and said there      
 children were happy at school.They    
 used and supported the amenities found
 in the village but with most families 
 having their own transport the public 
 transport was only used by about half 
 of our survey.The state of repair of  
 footpaths and roads was a cause of    
 concern.                              </content>
