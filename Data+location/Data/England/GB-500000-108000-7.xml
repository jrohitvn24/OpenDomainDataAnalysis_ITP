		<title>07DOWNLAND AND THE ARUN GAP</title>

 The river Arun meanders through       
 the gap it has made for itself in the 
 chalk of the South Downs. Arundel town
 guards the gap at its south end and   
 four isolated farming hamlets on      
 cul-de-sac roads are dotted around the
 edge of the Downs overlooking the wide
 valley. Water meadows provide grazing 
 for cattle and large areas to the east
 on the Downs bear crops, mainly of    
 grain. To the west of the river the   
 Downs have been enclosed by one of the
 Dukes of Norfolk to provide a deer    
 park. There are no longer any deer in 
 the park, but it provides a           
 recreational area very little         
 different from the rest of the Downs. 
 Scheduled replanting preserves the    
 wooded areas.
