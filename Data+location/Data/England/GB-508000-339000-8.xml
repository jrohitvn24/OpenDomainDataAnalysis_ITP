		<content> Knives, forks, spoons and spears is a 
 game where somebody is "on". They say 
 "knives, forks, spoons and spears"    
 then when they say "spears" everybody 
 that is playing goes up into a        
 handstand. The last person who comes  
 down is "on". If two people come down 
 at the same time the person says it   
 again.The two people do a hand stand  
 and the last person to come down is   
 "on".                                 
    Dr. Dr. is a game which you  can   
 play anywhere. Everybody can join     
 in.Everybody who joins in gets in a   
 circle holding hands. One person goes 
 away so that he can't see the circle  
 of people. Then the circle of people  
 go under and over their arms and get  
 in a tangle, then the circle of people
 call Dr.Dr. and the person who has    
 gone off comes back. He tries to get  
 the circle back to normal.            </content>
