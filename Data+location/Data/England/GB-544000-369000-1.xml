		<content>  {   Willoughby and Claxby.}          
  These two villages are situated in   
 pretty countryside three miles to the 
 south of Alford,a small market town.  
 They are surrounded by rich agricul-  
 tural land and it is this that        
 provides the main source of income for
 the populace.                         
  This survey was conducted by pupils  
 in the top class,Class 3,of the small 
 primary school in Willoughby.The main 
 information was collected from a      
 questionnaire drawn up and delivered  
 to each household in the D-block.The  
 facts and figures contained in it     
 are as accurate as possible;but for a 
 variety of reasons may not tally with 
 one another.Time prevented            
 rectification - this is already       
 overdue!The whole village was done    
 even though it was not all in the     
 Block.                                </content>
