		<content>      Education is organized in three  
layers, children start Primary School  
at the age of five, they move on to    
Middle School at the age of nine and to
the High School four years later.      
      There are several activities     
available in the evenings.  Apart from 
sports clubs and uniformed groups there
Youth Club for those of the age of     
thirteen or over, and a weekly disco at
the Maltings for those sixteen and     
over.  Many young people go to Ipswich 
to support the football team.  However 
teenagers feel a great lack of a social
centre for those who do not wish to    
commit themselves to clubs.  They would
like a place to meet for discos or just
to talk.
