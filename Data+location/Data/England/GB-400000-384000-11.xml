		<title>11Farming in New Mills</title>
		<content> There are no crops growing on the     
 hills because they are too bumpy.     
 So it is used for enclosed rough      
 grazing.There are 37 farms in Newtown 
 and New Mills.If you walk along the   
 Sett Valley Trail you can see a good  
 view of the farmland.Our teacher lives
 on a farm called Brow Farm between    
 Hague Bar Road and High Lea Road.New  
 Mills is mostly residential and       
 farmland.                             
 Traditionally the area had been       
 largely grassland for grazing sheep   
 and cattle with very little grain     
 production, mainly of oats.Milk was   
 probably the most important farm      
 product of the 1850s although there   
 may have been a development of arable 
 farming to provide vegetables for the 
 growing population of the town.
