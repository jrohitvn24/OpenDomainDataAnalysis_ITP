		<content>   First the bricks are left to dry out
 and then they build a wall over the   
 front of the chamber, over which is   
 stuck a horrible slush - this seals   
 the bricks so no air gets in.  The    
 wall is called a 'wicket'.            
   Inside the chamber the bricks cook  
 for 100 hours at 980 degrees C.  The  
 bricks cook themselves as the clay    
 contains 8% oil which is made from the
 remains of small sea creatures trapped
 in the clay millions of years ago.    
   We looked through a hole in the roof
 of the kiln and saw the red hot bricks
 burning.   We were allowed to take    
 back to school as many finished cooled
 bricks as we could carry.             
   Some of the children's parents in   
 our class work at the brickyards,     
 often the Italian parents.  One boy   
 found a photograph of his grandad     
 working at his very own brick kiln.   </content>
