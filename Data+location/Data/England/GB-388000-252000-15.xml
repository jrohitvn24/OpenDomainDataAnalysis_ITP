 Local churches have joined together   
 together to welcome Irish children    
 from troubled Belfast to this area to 
 give them a holiday in peaceful       
 countryside for a number of weeks.    
{ROADS                                 
 The local cross-roads at Spetchley    
 were altered recently to make them    
 less dangerous, through the pressure  
 put on the local council by the       
 late Tommy Campden who was at  first  
 a 'link- length' man and then became a
 local councillor.                     
{HISTORY                               
 Local people have been interested to  
 contribute to this survey and         
 have expressed  concern for the       
 interest of future generations in the 
{heritage}of this area .
