		<title>05CASTLE AS TOURIST ATTRACTION</title>
		<content> We asked the tourists what had        
 attracted them to the castle.  We got 
 a variety of answers.  Some of these  
 answers were:                         
 1) Like visiting old English castles. 
 2) Interested in local historic       
    buildings.                         
 3) It is a fascinating place to visit.
 4) Interested in Roman buildings.     
 5) Interested in Norman buildings.    
 6) Afternoon out.                     
                                       
 Lastly, we asked them whether it is   
 important to maintain historic        
 buildings.  All said yes, stating that
 historic buildings are our heritage   
 and that they enable us to get a good 
 idea of what happened in our past.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
