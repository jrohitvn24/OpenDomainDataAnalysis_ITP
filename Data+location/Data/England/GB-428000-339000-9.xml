		<title>09 "FARMING"</title>
		<content>     The summer of 1985 has been one of
 the wettest in living memory. As a    
 result the harvest was three weeks    
 later than the average for the area.  
 Much of the grain had to be dried     
 prior to storage, the moisture content
 being very high.                      
   The majority of farms within the    
 area are still farmed as either dairy 
 or arable units, most farms becoming  
 highly mechanised over the last 20-30 
 years. Tractors are larger and in many
 cases 4-wheel drive. Combine          
 harvesters have become larger on the  
 predominantly arable farms. Round     
 bailers have appeared on the scene    
 recently to bail straw, hay and       
 silage                                
  The area has seen a limited removal  
 of some dividing field hedges but has 
 remained essentially unaltered over   
 the years.                            </content>
