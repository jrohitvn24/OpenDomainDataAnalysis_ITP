		<content>   We were excited when the{Manager    
 invited us to lunch.We were met by the
{Entertainments Manager}who showed us  
 the{dining room.}It was enormous _    
 nearer the size of our football field 
 but narrower.There were 699 people    
 having lunch at the same time.They sat
 down at rectangular tables with a     
 number on.The tablecloth was a        
 different colour for breakfast,lunch  
 and dinner.For{dinner}there are       
 candles. We had a lot of cutlery laid 
 out and a small plate with a roll.A   
 waitress served{lunch.}We had soup,   
 then because it was Friday it was fish
 day. The fish came in on a big silver 
 dish _ it had slices of lemon on      
 it.One girl didn't like fish so she   
 had an enormous salad.We all loved the
 dessert,ice-cream covered with        
 chocolate.
