		<content> There are few facilities specially for
 tourists, most come when the weather  
 is too bad for the beach, to visit the
 shops - Truro has the best shopping   
 centre in Cornwall - see the Cathedral
 -the only one West of Exeter,and about
 100 years old - and perhaps visit the 
 Museum - the largest in the County,   
 with a good coverage of local history,
 and a unique collection of minerals.  
 Trips on the River from Truro to      
 Falmouth and back are also popular    
 with visitors. The benefits of Tourism
 include more and better shops and     
 Restaurants, but there are severe     
 traffic and parking problems in Summer
 caused by the influx. Some jobs are   
 created by tourism, but they are      
 often only seasonal. Truro would be a 
 good holiday base for the County, as  
 it is fairly central, but most stay   
 outside it, nearer the coast.         </content>
