 I woke up at 7.30am and went and had a
 wash. I put on my blue jeans, my pink 
 sweat-shirt and my white ankle socks, 
 then went downstairs and grabbed a    
 bourbon biscuit. I put my trainers on 
 and went to feed my animals. I've got 
 five calves called Dolly, Dewdrop,    
 Tilly, Billy and Willy, two heifers   
 called Shona and Donna, and a cow who 
 was being milked by Dad who had 72    
 cows to milk by machine. I went in and
 had my breakfast which consisted of   
 Special K, fish fingers on fried bread
 and two cups of tea. After breakfast  
 Joanne and Andrew went to play in     
 their den and Mum did some cooking. I 
 went outside, called the two dogs Lucy
 and Scottie and went to feed our baby 
 ducks. They were all outside swimming 
 and making a noise. I looked at my    
 watch.       {(cont on next page)     </content>
