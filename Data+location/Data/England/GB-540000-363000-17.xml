		<title>17HALTON FISH FARM</title>
		<content> The Fish Farm which sells tropical,sea
 water and cold water fish,started as a
 hobby but soon became a fast growing  
 business.About 600-1000 fish are sold 
 each week.More pond fish are sold in  
 the summer and more tropical fish in  
 the winter.The smallest fish is called
 "Dwarf Rasbora" The biggest is a "Cat 
 fish" which is 80cm long with whiskers
 1metre long.10% of the water in the   
 tanks is changed once a month for     
 tropical fish and every three weeks   
 for sea-water fish.To keep the fish   
 healthy do not over  feed and do not  
 put too many fish together.Only eight 
 varieties have live babies, all the   
 rest lay eggs.The owner also keeps a  
 Tarantula and a Garter Snake. Plants  
 and accessories are also sold.
