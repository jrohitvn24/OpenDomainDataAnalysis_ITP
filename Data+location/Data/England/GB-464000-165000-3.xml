		<title>03BURGHFIELD-"NUCLEAR VALLEY"</title>
		<content> The Atomic Weapons Research Establish-
 ment (AWRE) at Aldermaston,a large    
 employer for the area,performs highly 
 secret research in the nuclear field. 
 The Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF) at   
 Burghfield was built during World War 
 II to produce ammunition and has been 
 used in that capacity ever since.It is
 also involved in the assembly of nuc- 
 lear war-heads and missiles.          
  As a result of all this,the area has 
 become a focus of contention for the  
 pro- and anti-nuclear lobbies.Mrs J.  
 Ruddock,former chairperson for the    
 Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND)
 ,lives in Burghfield Common.In 1983   
 there was a major demonstation against
 the presence of the various bases.Pro-
 testors unsuccessfully blockaded the  
 ROF and RAF Greenham and formed a     
 human chain between the two,involving 
 some 80,000 people.                   </content>
