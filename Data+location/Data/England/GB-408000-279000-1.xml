   According to documentary evidence   
 there has been a mill at Sarehole     
 since  1542. The first known building 
 to be erected on the site  was a corn 
 mill built by J. Bedell of Beoley.    
 In 1727 the mill was bought by the    
 Eaves family who rented it out. One of
 the tenants was Matthew Boulton who   
 may have changed the mill to metal    
 rolling. After Boulton's departure the
 mill was pulled down and monies raised
 by Eaves suggest that he rebuilt the  
 mill between 1764-68. At this time he 
 improved the water supply which fed   
 the overshot wheel. Further money     
 enabled Eaves to build a granary and  
 blade grinding workshop. In the early 
 19th century the mill once again      
 reverted to corn grinding. John       
 Andrews took the tenancy in 1858. In  
 1919 milling totally ceased.          </content>
