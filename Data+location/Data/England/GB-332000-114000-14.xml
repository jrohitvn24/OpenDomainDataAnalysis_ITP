		<title>14BRADFORDS OF ILMINSTER</title>
		<content>  This company was formed in 1770 by   
 a family named Bradford. They used    
 to deliver withies. Withies were used 
 for thatching, and they delivered     
 them by horse and cart. They also sold
 grain and fertiliser for farmers.     
  The firm grew, so now it has fourteen
 or more branches and subsidiaries     
 based in Somerset, Dorset and Devon.  
 The head office is in Yeovil, and     
 it is still directed and run by the   
 Bradford family. There is a branch    
 in Ilminster which now sells          
 bathroom fittings. They also have a   
 yard selling timber, stone and bricks.
 From the yard, they deliver locally   
 by lorries. It is possible to buy from
 Bradfords. All the materials required 
 for building a house.
