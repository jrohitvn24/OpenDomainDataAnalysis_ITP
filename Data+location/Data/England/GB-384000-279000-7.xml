		<title>07THE CHURCHES IN COOKLEY</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
     There are two churches and one    
 chapel in the area. The one church    
 really belongs to the village of      
{CHURCHILL}and so is not considered    
 here.                                 
    The most substantial building is   
 the Church of England ,St. Peters,    
 which now shares its vicar with the   
 parish of {Wolverley}.                
    The Methodist Chapel is a much     
 smaller building but seems to have a  
 lively congregation despite having a  
 circuit preacher.                     
    The two religious centres          
 unfortunately do not seem to involve  
 many of the villagers but are         
 supported by the stalwart few.
