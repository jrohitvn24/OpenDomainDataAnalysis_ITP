Our school is very nice. We are very   
lucky to have a lot of wild life in    
our grounds.We have a big  playground, 
which is marked out for lots of games. 
We have six classrooms.The teachers    
names are ,Mrs.James, Mrs.Wilson,      
Mrs.Bartlett,Mrs. Kitchener,           
Mrs. Osborn,Mr. Goodall.The school     
dinners are not bad.The school takes   
us on lots of school trips.The school  
took us to Scarborough &amp; Swanage.      
This year we will be leaving the top   
class and we will be going to Road     
school it will be very large to our    
little school and it will be very sad  
to leave all our other friends in our  
class and our teachers who taught us   
all the work .I hope we will settle    
down all right with our new friends.   
Sometimes people get a bit scared of   
getting lost. Alex Martin Aged 11.     </content>
