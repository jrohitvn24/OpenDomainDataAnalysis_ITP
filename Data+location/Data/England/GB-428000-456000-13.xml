		<title>13THE GRANBY CAMPUS</title>
		<content> The development of this campus began  
 in the early 1950's with the building 
 of{Harrogate Technical High School}on 
 land previously owned by Granby Farm. 
 In 1957{St. John Fisher R.C. Secondary
{Modern School}was built, later to be  
 followed in 1962 by{St. Robert's R.C. 
{Primary School.}Another school{Granby 
{Secondary Modern}was added in 1965.   
   Reorganisation of Education in      
 Harrogate in 1973 brought great       
 changes with St. John Fisher School   
 moving to a new site and the three    
 senior schools amalgamating to become{
{Granby High School.} This became the  
 largest school in the town - a        
 Comprehensive School with over 2000   
 pupils.
