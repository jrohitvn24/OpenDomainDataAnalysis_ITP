		<title>12SALMON FISHING :BERE FERRERS</title>
		<content>   Salmon Fishing is very strictly     
 controlled.  There was one licence for
 Bere Ferrers in the area upstream.  It
 was fished with a specified net from a
 rowing boat.                          
   "Mr Percy Eliot was fishing when we 
 walked along a wooded, riverside      
 footpath opposite Bere Ferrers.  He   
 was holding  one end of a non-treated 
 net, the other end being hooked to a  
 boat which was out on the river.      
 They were going against the tide. Then
 Mr Eliot shouted "stop." So the man in
 the boat rowed in, took the net from  
 the boat and started pulling it in. We
 were all watching in silence while    
 they pulled and pulled the sixty feet 
 of net.  Then they had to position the
 bunt (centre float) so they pulled on 
 one side until it was in the middle.  
 There was a splashing and they pulled 
 in a sea trout (peel).That made six.  </content>
