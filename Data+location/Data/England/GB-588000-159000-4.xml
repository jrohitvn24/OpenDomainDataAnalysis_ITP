		<content>In 1945 Shell established a research   
centre on the site of Woodstock Farm   
and a 180 hectares of surrounding land.
Kent was chosen because there are lots 
of orchards which allow their          
scientists to test chemical pesticides.
The site has 16 glass houses to store  
the plants after they have been        
sprayed,and experiments take 8 to 10   
years to complete.It is essential to   
take this long to ensure that the      
pesticides will not harm people,       
wildlife and the crops themselves.680  
people are employed and 6 000 guests   
visit the site every year.Woodstock    
club is a part of Shell research and   
has football,cricket,tennis,bowls and  
squash facilities for the workers.
