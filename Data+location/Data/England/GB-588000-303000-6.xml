		<content> Foxes are the largest animals resident
 in the village but they are rarely    
 seen. The old railway line being their
 favourite haunt. Hares are common on  
 the large open fields and in March can
 be seen playing in the growing corn.  
 Rabbits, Rats, House and Field Mice,  
 Moles and Shrews are all common and   
 the first few are considered pests and
 killed by various means. In summer    
 dusk brings out several bats. Frogs   
 and Toads are plentiful.              
 The village,being on top of a hill, is
 particularly affected by the wind,    
 only Church St. seems to escape, and  
 it is said to be "2 coats warmer" than
 the rest of the village. This winter  
 we endured 2 periods of a fortnight of
 very low temperatures followed by an  
 unusually dull spring and summer,     
 Autumn looks like being warmer than   
 usual.                                </content>
