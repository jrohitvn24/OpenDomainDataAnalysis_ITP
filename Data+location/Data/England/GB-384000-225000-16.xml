		<content>   Some of the larger houses had a     
 paddock for a horse or pony. We saw   
 dairy cattle, mainly black and white  
 Frisians together with sheep and goats
 grazing in the fields. The arable     
 fields had wheat and barley growing in
 them and the drier meadows were being 
 cut for silage or hay.(May/June).     
 Most of the other people in the       
 village unless they were retired,     
 seemed to work in Tewkesbury or       
 Cheltenham and a few in Gloucester.   
   To the west of the River Severn     
 there was some more low lying         
 meadowland which can only be used for 
 summer grazing or cropping for hay.   
 This year, the hay cutting was late   
 because of the very wet June. After   
 the 2 public houses by the Haw Bridge 
 there are no more houses until you    
 reach the village of Tirley.
