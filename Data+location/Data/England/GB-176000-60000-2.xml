		<title>02BIRDS ON KELSEY HEAD</title>
		<content> First we saw a flock of{Pigeons,}in   
 the flock was a black and white       
 Pigeon. Next we saw a{Kestrel}hovering
 above us. We saw a{Skylark}on the path
 and followed it, but it kept on       
 leading us away from it's nest. The   
 next birds we saw were some{Starlings 
 which rose from the pea field in a big
 flock.                                
 There were lots of Gulls about        
 including{Black-Backed, Herring Gulls}
 and the{Fulmars}which keep their wings
 stiff in flight and rarely 'flap'. The
 Gulls' nesting sites were on little   
 ledges in the cliff face.  At the top 
 of the cliff, in the earth just below 
 grass level, there were holes made by 
{Swallows, Swifts}and{Sand Martins}    
 which were their nests.  A{Raven}was  
 perched on top of a pole as a{Carrion 
{Crow}flew over and we later spotted a 
{Magpie.}                              </content>
