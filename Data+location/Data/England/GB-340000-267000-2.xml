		<content>           WIGMORE CASTLE              
                                       
 The remains of Wigmore Castle which   
 stand above the village to the West   
 are those of the Norman Castle built  
 in 1067.  There had been an earlier   
 castle standing on Green Hill, midway 
 between the ruins and the village.    
 The ruins still show signs of their   
 Norman structure.  The castle was a   
 formidable fortress giving protection 
 against the Welsh.  The Mortimer      
 family, who owned it during much of   
 the Medieval period, flourished and   
 the Castle was often used to host     
 royal visits. Edward IV  when Duke of 
 York, stayed there, and marched from  
 the Castle to the battle of Mortimer's
 Cross, which he won on 2nd February   
 1461.                                 
 The last person born in the castle was
 Sir Edward Harley in 1624.            </content>
