 stones).In the south of Wiltshire     
 people used to make houses out of a   
 kind of concrete made of chalk and so 
 they had big over hanging eves to keep
 the rain off the walls so they don't  
 wash away.On the slopes of Urchfont   
 hill there was a chalk pit that       
 provided chalk to put on the roads and
 fields because chalk has lime in which
 is good for the soil,and they put it  
 on the roads to try and stop them     
 wearing away.In Urchfont there are    
 still quite a few of these tracks     
 which are called hollow_ways because  
 they are sunken.There were two        
 brickplots in Urchfont which made     
 bricks for the community out of local 
 clay that they stamped,put in molds   
 and fired.                            </content>
