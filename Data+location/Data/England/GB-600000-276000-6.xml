		<content>With no shops in the area all families 
have to do their shopping elsewhere.   
There are limited shopping facilities  
in Botesdale, Redgrave and Hopton, with
each of these villages having at least 
one grocer's shop and a Post Office.   
However many families travel to Diss or
Bury St. Edmunds for most supplies, and
for some items to Norwich, Ipswich or  
Cambridge. Many families travel to town
to buy the bulk of their groceries and 
only use more local shops to 'top up'  
individual items they forget while in  
town, or if they need it urgently.Many 
families grow a proportion of their    
vegetable requirements in their garden.
Most households have pets with a large 
proportion having at least one dog; and
several keeping a pony.
