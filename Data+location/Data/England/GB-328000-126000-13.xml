		<title>13RECREATION ON THE CANAL</title>
		<content>  The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal is  
 already quite well used for           
 recreational purposes.                
  The British Waterways Board owns the 
 fishing rights and they license them  
 to the Bridgwater Angling Association 
 and the Taunton Angling Association.  
 The closed season is from March to    
 June.The main types of fish in the    
 canal are tench,roach,eels,pike and   
 carp.We saw men and boys fishing and  
 they had all made good catches.       
  At the moment there is only the very 
 occasional canoe or rowing boat on the
 canal.The plan is to make the canal   
 more suitable for boating.            
  The towpath is a public right of way 
 and local people enjoy walking their  
 dogs here.It has also been used for   
 sponsored walks.Along the path there  
 is one bench and this has been put up 
 as a memorial.                        </content>
