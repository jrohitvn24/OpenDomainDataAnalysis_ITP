		<title>15Housing in Normanby</title>
		<content> Travellers passing through the hamlet 
 of Normanby see the same picture that 
 they would have seen before the 2nd   
 World War.Building is very carefully  
 controlled.They have not wished to    
 enlarge the hamlet and so there has   
 not been any new housing built since  
 1936.The housing falls into 3         
 categories.Firstly there are Estate   
 houses built in 1936 and built to     
 blend into the rural landscape.       
 Secondly there is a small 1980's      
 development where late 19th century   
 stables were redesigned as homes but  
 retain their original appearance.     
 Thirdly there are privately owned     
 cottages built as long ago as 1805 but
 renovated with their external         
 appearance controlled by means of     
 preservation orders.
