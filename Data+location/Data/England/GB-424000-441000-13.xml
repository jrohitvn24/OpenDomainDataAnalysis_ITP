		<title>13Bramhope: Housing 1</title>
		<content> Bramhope's status as an affluent      
 residential area favoured by business,
 and professional people is directly   
 related to its superior quality       
 housing,almost all of which is        
 privately owned.The village's oldest  
 cottages,farmhouses and short terraces
 are substantially built of Yorkshire  
 stone.Some houses,like The Smithy,    
 exhibit interesting evidence of their 
 past usage.Others reveal their age on 
 wall inscriptions dating from 1671    
 onwards.The first 20th century housing
 development consisted of large        
 individual houses,generally standing  
 in extensive gardens.Such properties  
 have often been modernised,and some   
 now feature,{swimming pools}and       
{tennis courts.}Where recent private   
 infilling has taken place,these houses
 also support the luxurious image.
