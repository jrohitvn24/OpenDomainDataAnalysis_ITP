		<title>09Transport in New Mills</title>
		<content> Trains in New Mills carry two loads,  
 they are passengers and goods. There  
 are three railways:the goods, the     
 Buxton to Manchester line and the     
 Central Station which goes right      
 through the valley.Bus services:358,  
 360, 361, 362.Buses come to the train 
 station so if you get off at Newtown  
 you can get on the bus. New Mills has 
 it's own bus station.                 
 Every Monday we go swimming on a      
 coach. I think that Bowers is the most
 common coach service in New Mills. The
 canal is next to the Manchester to    
 Buxton line. There is no cargo carried
 on it but plenty of barges. I have    
 joined Furness Vale Sea Scouts. We    
 canoe on the canal. The A6 is a major 
 trunk road running through New Mills. 
 The A6 is next to the Manchester to   
 Buxton line which is next to the      
 canal.                                </content>
