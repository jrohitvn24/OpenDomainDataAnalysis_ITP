 I live in Station Lane Hornchurch.    
 There is a local parade of shops just 
 down the road with a chemist,         
 newsagents, two sweetshops and a car  
 parts shop.  There is a telephone box 
 and a pillarbox just across the road  
 and a local youth club at the school  
 every Tuesday night..  I go swimming  
 at Harrow Lodge Swimming Baths every  
 Monday night.  The town centre is     
 quite near and the bus routes run down
 our road.  We have a play park just   
 round the corner and I go there every 
 night.  There's a church quite near   
 and I go most Sundays.  We have a     
 station just down the road and a park 
 called Harrow Lodge.
