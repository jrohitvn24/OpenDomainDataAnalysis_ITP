		<content> Within this growing community we have 
 seen improved trading facilities for  
 the residents. There is something     
 for everyone. The village has its own 
 dairy, plus milk and dairy produce    
 from Stowey Court Farm. There are     
 several shops selling provisions and  
 greengrocery. An excellent butchers is
 situated opposite the post office. We 
 have a small antique shop connected to
 a haberdashery and bookshop. Another  
 store combines a newsagency and       
 ironmongery. There are two            
 hairdressing establishments. The      
 Castle Stores is also a newsagency and
 video film hire centre. There are     
 three public houses. There is a petrol
 filling station with a car repair     
 workshop. The village has a bank and  
 an estate agency. The well known old  
 village Bakery has recently closed due
 to the retirement of the local baker. </content>
