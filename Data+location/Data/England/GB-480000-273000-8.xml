		<title>08JIM`S BUTCHER SHOP,BROUGHTON</title>
		<content>ON 26th JUNE, WE WENT DOWN TO INTERVIEW
THE PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE BUTCHERÂ£S   
SHOP ON THE HIGH STREET IN BROUGHTON.  
THIS IS WHAT WE FOUND OUT.THEY GET A   
LOT OF CUSTOMERS BUT THEY WOULD LIKE   
EVEN MORE.THE PRESENT OWNER HAS        
OWNED THE SHOP FOR FOUR YEARS.IT       
OPENS AT 8.00a.m. AND CLOSES AT        
5.00p.m. TWO PEOPLE WORK THERE:THE     
BUTCHER AND HIS WIFE.THEY SELL         
GROCERIES AS WELL AS MEAT AND          
VEGETABLES.PEOPLE BUY BEEF,SUGAR AND   
MILK THE MOST.FRIDAY IS THE BUSIEST    
DAY.WEDNESDAY IS THE WORST DAY FOR     
TRADE. THE BUTCHERÂ£S WIFE DOES NOT     
LIKE GETTING MESSY AND HANDLING LIVER  
BECAUSE IT IS SLIMY.THEY LIKE WORKING  
IN A SHOP BECAUSE THEY ENJOY MEETING   
ALL THE PEOPLE.THEY ONLY GET BORED     
WHEN THEY ARE NOT BUSY.                
                                       
                                       </content>
