		<content>  Wards Mobility is a very busy place. 
 Part of it uses the buildings of an   
{old brewery.} They used to build a    
 standard{invalid tricycle}which the   
 government provided free for handi-   
 capped people.  Now the factory makes 
{all kinds of machines}to help those   
 with disabilities to lead a normal    
 life.  While they last old tricycles  
 are still repaired.  Now the factory  
 converts normal cars for use by the   
 disabled, but the{disadvantage}of this
 is that the government will not pay to
 maintain them after four years.       
  They make special{toilets, baths}and 
 individually-designed appliances to   
 help people move about the house, cook
 and look after themselves without     
 human help.                           
  Engineers go all over the{South-East 
 to{measure and design and service}the 
 machines that are then made here.     </content>
