		<content>     {Langtons}is a Registry Office in 
 a park.   It is a big mansion and it  
 used to belong to Mr "Varco" Williams.
 The mansion was built in the 18th     
 century and was given to the Urban    
 District Council when Mr Varco        
 Williams died in 1929 and is still    
 used as council offices.              
      The grounds of Langtons were used
 as a cricket pitch.   For over a      
 hundred years teams have played in the
 park.                                 
      Close to Langtons stands another 
 old house called{Fairkytes}which was  
 occupied for many years by a son of   
 Elizabeth Fry, the prison reformer.   
 The lovely old house still looks out  
 on the lake.                          
      The lake and grounds are indeed a
 very pleasant feature of present day  
 central Hornchurch.
