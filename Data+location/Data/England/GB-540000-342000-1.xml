		<title>01NORTH SEA CAMP</title>
		<content> Over 50 years ago boys from a centre  
 near Stafford marched to Freiston     
 Shore in order to build a Borstal     
 Camp so that they could be usefully   
 employed and reclaim land from the    
 Wash. This work is still going on and 
 has so far reclaimed about 950 acres  
 of land.The bank is made of clay and  
 silt and is built up using either hand
 labour,the boys from the Detention    
 Centre, or machinery, diggers,        
 drag-lines and a minature railway.    
 The railway goes out into the Wash    
 where there is a digger.The digger    
 scoops mud out and puts it into the   
 bogeys.They travel back,take the      
 bogeys up to the top of the           
 bank,travel half way along the bank   
 and are then tipped over the opposite 
 side of the bank.The bank has to be   
 high enough to keep out the tide      
 which can be as high as 8.5 meters.   </content>
