 The Finedon Dolben Cricket Club       
founded in 1836 will next year         
celebrate its 150th anniversary.The    
club is the second oldest cricket club 
in the Midlands.                       
 The present club owns a pleasant      
ground near the church, bordered by    
limes and elms.                        
 The club has 3 teams,an under 15's,   
under 18's and a first team.           
 Next to the cricket ground is a rough 
field known locally as the Tainty.This 
is now the site for an annual funfair. 
Tainty probably originated from        
Tenter. Tenter Lane is nearby and has  
historical links with weaving.
