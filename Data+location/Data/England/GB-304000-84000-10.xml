		<title>10 HOUSING</title>
		<content>There are plenty of picturesque,typical
Devon thatch &amp; cob cottages in East    
Budleigh,especially along the little   
altered High Street &amp; beside Budleigh  
Brook.Few are dated but many are over  
150 yrs old.Farm buildings occupy much 
of the village outskirts.A significant 
amount of new housing,in estates,has   
accompanied the population increase    
since 1971.Unusually,this has been in  
the village centre rather than on the  
edge.Hayes Barton is an Elizabethan    
Farmhouse famous for its association   
with Raleigh.Bicton House is prominent 
for its size,period &amp; gardens.An       
interesting change since 1978 has been 
the conversion of the old railway      
station at Otterton into a house with  
the platform as a patio,-on sale for   
79000 pounds.Houses in the area may be 
considered by people looking for holi- 
day homes. By J.Ross &amp; A.Kain          </content>
