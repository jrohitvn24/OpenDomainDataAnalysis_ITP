		<title>08My Pet - Snowball the Rabbit</title>
		<content>   My pet rabbit is called{Snowball.}I 
 sometimes call him{Snowy}.He is white 
 with a pink nose.Snowball likes       
 dandelion leaves and bran.Snowball is 
 very friendly and never bites you.He  
 is a dwarf rabbit and will not grow   
 much bigger than he is now.About four 
 weeks ago my daddy brought him into   
 the house and put him on my knee.I    
 stroked him for a while and then I put
 him down on the floor.                
   I love Snowball and Richard,Mummy   
 and Daddy like him too.When my cousins
 Matthew and Andrew come to see us they
 always stroke Snowy.Every Sunday      
 morning Daddy and Richard clean out   
 the hutch and I sometimes help.I am   
 usually worried that Snowball might   
 escape while we are doing his hutch.
