		<title>05CHILD'S VIEW OF E.ALLINGTON</title>
		<content> We asked all the junior school        
 children what they particularly       
 enjoyed about living in our area and  
 here are some of their replies----    
 It's so quiet and there is no traffic 
 noise like in a town...it's near the  
 sea...lots of fields to play in...it's
 peaceful and there are lots of        
 creatures to watch...there's lots of  
 really fresh air which doesn't smell  
 of car fumes...there's lots to do     
 because of the flowers and trees...you
 don't get bored if you live on a farm 
 because there are always jobs to      
 do...it's a place close to Nature and 
 you can sleep at night because the    
 traffic noise doesn't keep you awake. 
 Some of the things they did not enjoy 
 were..too far from shops..few friends 
 nearby...it sometimes looks untidy    
 because people leave litter..no       
 museums or zebra crossings..          </content>
