		<title>08Vegetables at Pullen's Farm</title>
		<content>   On Pullen's Farm they had rows of   
 polythene tunnels, in which           
{strawberries}and{lettuces}are grown.  
 There were two different types of     
 lettuces, which were Sitonian and     
 Crisp.  These were sold to            
 wholesalers, supermarkets and         
 hypermarkets.  The Crisp lettuces are 
 grown outside, the Sitonians inside   
 the tunnels.  Conifer trees are used  
 as protection around the tunnels.     
   Other vegetables, such as           
{cauliflowers}and{potatoes}are grown.  
 Cauliflowers are surrounded by an     
 electric fence which stops{rabbits}   
 from eating the plants.               
   Twenty women pick, wash and package 
 the vegetables.  After harvest, the   
 ground is destoned and rotavated.
