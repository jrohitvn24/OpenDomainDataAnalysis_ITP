		<content>{Bowes Castle} Bowes Castle was built  
 in the 12th century by the            
 Normans.King John visited it in 1206  
 and 1212 and his niece Eleanor,sister 
 of Prince Arthur, was detained        
 here.The keep walls were about 3 or 4 
 feet thick.It had a spiral staircase  
 on the inside of the keep.By 1314-22  
 the North of England was devastated by
 Robert Bruce,King of Scotland.There   
 was so much damage done to it that it 
 was considered of no value for defence
 and in the 17th century it was        
 dismantled.It is now an impressive    
 monument.                             
{St. Giles' Church}   The church is    
 dedicated to St. Giles.It is dated    
 from the Norman period.It was restored
 in 1865.The font is 12th century even 
 though it bears a date of 1622.There  
 are lots of old graves  including a   
 roman memorial stone (continued)      </content>
