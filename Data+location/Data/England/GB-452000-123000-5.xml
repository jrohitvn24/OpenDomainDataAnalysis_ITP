		<content>    When piglets are born they are     
 about fifteen cms long and about ten  
 cms high. They are born in farrowing  
 crates. The sows have about fifteen   
 piglets at a time.                    
    After about two and a half weeks   
 they stop drinking from their mother. 
 At two and a half weeks they go on to 
 cuckoo pellets. At about three weeks  
 they are weaned to a bigger pen.      
    Piglets sometimes get scowers. That
 is when white liquid comes out of     
 them. You have to throw some turf into
 the pen.                              
    At about six weeks the piglets have
 to be split up. When they are about   
 six weeks old they are porkers. At    
 seven weeks old they are sent off to  
 be killed. The owners then sell the   
 meat in the winter.
