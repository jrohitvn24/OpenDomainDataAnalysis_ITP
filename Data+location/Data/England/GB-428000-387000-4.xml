		<title>04LOXLEY VALLEY MANAGEMENT.</title>
		<content> The Loxley Valley Management Project  
 is to try and reconcile conflicting   
 uses and pressures on the valley,and  
 conserve its landscape quality and    
 unique industrial and natural history.
 The valley links the city and the open
 moorland of the Peak District.It is a 
 recreational area for the people of   
 Stannington,Loxley and Hillsborough.  
 The valley is part of the Green Belt  
 and is safe from residential(housing) 
 and industrial development.The project
 will help conserve and improve the    
  rural character of the area.         
 Improvements to the valley will depend
 on the actions of the City Council and
 the active support of farmers,local   
 residents,factory workers and school  
 children.Myers Grove School           
 Conservation Group works closely with 
 the project.
