		<title>03Old Peoples Ferrybridge (1)</title>
		<content> There are a lot of old peoples        
 bungalows near our school and we      
 decided to talk to some of the people 
 who live there.Most people said they  
 liked living in Ferrybridge.One of the
 old people said she liked it very much
 and said it was very clean and tidy.  
 Another said yes it's alright,I've    
 been living here all my life.Some said
 they would like to se more children at
 church.A few wanted to stop vandals   
 and to see less litter about.The only 
 thing one lady wanted was her hedge   
 cutting.This seemed the right time to 
 be good neighbours so some of our     
 class brought shears to cut it.A      
 couple of people said they would like 
 a few more seats in the park.I think  
 this is a good idea.
