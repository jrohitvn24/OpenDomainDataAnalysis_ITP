		<content> Lying below the northern escarpment of
 Rackham Hill, most of the area belongs
 to Parham Estate. Parham House, a fine
 Elizabethan manor, is the main        
 southern feature standing in a deer   
 park.  Most of the central area is    
 woodland and common, where the chalk  
 and clay soils give way to a greensand
 belt running east to west.  The river 
 Arun crosses the north-western corner,
 joined by dykes and drainage ditches  
 through the water-meadows there.  the 
 eastern ede of this area has the river
 Stor and the A283 road from the hamlet
 of Cootham to Pulborough through it.  
 the West Sussex Golf Course and the   
 Southdown Gliding club are the main   
 attractions here, together with the   
 Crown - a very old inn.  there are in 
 the whole area, two tiny churhes and  
 four farms.  there is no major        
 industrial employer.  People work     </content>
