 Coplands Boats was bought by John     
 McIntosh a sailing enthusiast in 1967.
 The factory is built on the old       
 Ventnor Railway Station. The first    
 boat they built was Uffa Fox's        
 International Flying Fifteen. They now
 concentrate mainly on small sailing   
 boats and commercial workboats. All   
 the boats are made of resin, glass    
 fibre and a hardener and put into a   
 polished mould. A glass fibre mat is  
 put in to reinforce it. Sailing boats 
 are sold in Britain but workboats go  
 to Africa and the Middle East. The    
 boats are taken to Cowes and put into 
 the water. They are sailed to         
 Southampton. If they are going abroad 
 they are winched onto the cargo ship.
