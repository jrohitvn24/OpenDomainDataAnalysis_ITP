 NORTH CAROLINA;OTHERWISE LITTLE HAS   
 CHANGED.                              
 . THE CLEAN COTTON FIBRE IS PREPARED  
 IN THE BEATER AND IS THEN CALLED      
 "STUFF" WHICH IS FED IN PIPES TO THE  
 HIGHLY SKILLED PAPERMAKER AT HIS VAT. 
 HE DIPS HIS MOULD INTO THE            
 STUFF AND SHAKES IT FORWARDS AND      
 SIDEWAYS TO LAY THE FIBRES ACROSS     
 EACH OTHER.EACH SHEET OF PAPER IS LAID

 PRESS.LATER THE PAPER IS DRIED.       
   THE INTRICATE WATERMARKS ARE ALWAYS 
 FASCINATING AND ARE FORMED BY WIRE IN 
 THE MOULDING FRAME.
