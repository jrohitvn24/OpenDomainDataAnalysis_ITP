		<content>    Some families would carry their    
 bread dough to the local bakers and   
 paid to have it baked in there.       
    Families used to bathe once a week 
 in a tub with water from the fire side
 boiler. They often had to bathe in the
 same water.                           
    During the 1914 War wounded        
 soldiers were taken to Royds Hall     
 hospital and convolessent home        
 because Huddersfield Royal Infirmary  
 was full. St.Luke's wasn't a hospital 
 at that time it was a work house.
