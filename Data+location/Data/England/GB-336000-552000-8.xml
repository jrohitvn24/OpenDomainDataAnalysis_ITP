		<content> Our school Morton Park is in the      
 middle of a very large housing estate.
 However the estate is situated right  
 on the very edge of the city of       
 Carlisle very close to open farm land.
 The farms in our area are all dairy   
 farms,that is they have herds of cows 
 which they keep for milking.The cows  
 are almost entirely black and white   
 Freisians.The fields around our area  
 are all grass fields used for grazing 
 and for growing winter feed.The       
 farmers grow some hay for winter feed 
 for their cattle mainly for the       
 calves.However nowadays the farmers   
  mostly cut the grass and make it into
 silage which they either keep in pits 
 or make into large round bales.There  
 are very few crops grown in the fields
 other than grass although one farm    
 regularly grows potatoes.
