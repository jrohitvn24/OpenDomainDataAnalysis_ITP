		<content> This{RURAL AREA}of{Dorset}is scattered
 with farms &amp; cottages &amp; part of the   
 small village of Gussage All Saints.  
 The River Allen &amp; the Cranborne-      
 Wimborne road runs NE-SW. The East is 
 part of the{Shaftesbury}&amp; the West of 
 the{Crichel Estates.}A modern dairy   
 farm &amp; small farming enterprises lie  
 between. The river gives domestic     
 water &amp; fish. There are 2 pubs, 1 in  
 the village, 1 at a cross roads &amp; 1   
 Social Club. No doctor, school, shop  
 or garage. Many{cottages}belong to the
 big estates, originally{tied}to estate
 jobs, but with reduced numbers of farm
 workers many are let to people working
 elsewhere. Some have been sold,       
 &amp; then they are usually modernised.   
 The chalk soil produces an abundance  
 of flowers, many, e.g.{cowslips,}are  
 now rare. Bird life, both game &amp; wild 
 including threatened species abound.  </content>
