		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> This block lies at the southwesterly  
 end of th CANDOVER VALLEY which runs  
 between BASINGSTOKE and ALRESFORD in  
 the county of HAMPSHIRE.              
 It is a very rural area with a low    
 population (160 people).              
 The only real commercial activity is  
 agriculture.                          
 The population is a mixture of middle 
 aged professional people, younger     
 people in "white collar" employment,  
 retired people and agricultural       
 workers.                              
 The standards of living are in general
 high and almost all the population    
 have chosen to live here because of a 
 liking for this rural area which has  
 considerable natural beauty.          
 There is a strong community feeling   
 and much local social activity.       
 Current planning policy should ensure 
 the retention of the status quo.      </content>
