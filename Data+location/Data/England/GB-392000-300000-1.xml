		<content>A mainly residential area that includes
2 sq km of farmland in the north east. 
Most houses are built in estates which 
are mainly council owned. They are     
mostly semi-detached with some low-rise
flats and a few terraced or detached   
property. Much of the housing in the   
north-west has been recently renovated 
though a lot of dereliction is still   
evident.There are many public services 
and untilites some of which are        
seriously vandalised! The only central 
place is the old settlement of         
Wednesfield. There is some industry,   
mainly at Fallings Park. There is a lot
of open space,some formal parkland or  
recreational areas. On the council     
estates there are many small open      
spaces. A major open area with many    
footpaths over it is Bushbury Hill.    
There are many signs of social stress  
and povery over much of the area.      </content>
