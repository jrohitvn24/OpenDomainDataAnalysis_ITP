		<content>    Culcheth Linear Park is an         
 interesting place to find out about   
 wildlife.                             
    There are many footpaths in the    
 Linear Park, and plenty of benches to 
 sit on. There is plenty of room to    
 walk around and to let your dog have a
 good run. There is a bridle-way for   
 horses and a pleasant stream along the
 side of the footpaths.                
    The Rangers help to conserve the   
 wildlife and nature around the Park.  
 The Rangers hold a Junior Rangers Club
 on Saturdays and Sundays and go on    
 litter patrols.                       
    It was built in 1983 by Warrington 
 Borough Council. It started to provide
 a nature park for the people of       
 Culcheth to enjoy in their leisure    
 time.
