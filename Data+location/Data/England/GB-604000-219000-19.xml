		<title>19Fingringhoe Nature Reserve.</title>
		<content> This covers a wide area on the west   
 side of the estuary about 2 miles from
 Colchester.  The reserve is based on  
 sandy soil and much had been developed
 for extraction of sand and gravel.    
 Therefore, there are small lakes      
 dotted about.                         
  The reserve runs down to the Colne   
 Estuary with its distinctive salt     
 marshes and mud flats.  Thus there is 
 a good variety of habitat.            
  Hides have been built and there is   
 primitive overnight accommodation.    
 Several walks are signposted and there
 are printed guides.  Open days are    
 held to attract the general public.
