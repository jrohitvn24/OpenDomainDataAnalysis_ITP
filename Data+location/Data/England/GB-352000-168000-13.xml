		<title>13SUNDAY WITH THE MARSHALLS</title>
		<content> I have an elder sister named Katie and
 a younger brother called Edward. On   
 Sunday we usually go to the woods. We 
 put our boots on and wander up the    
 lane. We get to the top of the hill   
 and look at the view, then if we're   
 lucky we sometimes see baby rabbits   
 scampering around. In the woods nearby
 we often see squirrels in the Autumn  
 and bluebell in the Spring. When we   
 reach a certain corner, Dad usually   
 says,"Watch out for the bear!" There  
 are some stacked tree trunks which we 
 all walk over. Sometimes we climb over
 a wall to what was once our den, made 
 from fallen trees. After that we sit  
 down and spot what colour car is      
 coming past next in the valley below. 
 Then we walk back to our house.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
