		<title>11The Canal, Wombourne</title>
		<content>                                       
  The Staffordshire and Worcestershire 
canal traverses Wombourne in a         
North-South direction. It was built by 
James Brindley between 1766 and 1772   
and planned to unite the Severn and    
the Trent thus providing an outlet for 
Black Country  coal. Today it has no   
commercial use as it is so outdated.   
The bridges are narrow and its lock    
width severely limits the size of boat,
the tradional narrow boat being  the   
largest craft to sail on the  canal.   
The speed limit is 4 mph while the     
numerous locks help to  reduce the     
effective speed still  further. The    
summit of the canal is at Compton and  
it ends at Stourport on Severn where   
it falls 294 feet through 33 locks.    
Ounsdale High School use it for        
canoeing and have built a canoe centre 
on its banks.                          </content>
