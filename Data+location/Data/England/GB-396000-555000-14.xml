		<content> The majority of families purchase the 
 bulk of their {groceries from         
{supermarkets in the local market town}
 of Hexham, supplementing this with    
 purchases from the{local shop.}Some   
 make occasional visits to the large   
 hypermarkets in the Newcastle area.   
 Others, mainly elderly people with    
 transport problems, make the bulk of  
 their shopping at the local shop or   
 from{travelling shops}which visit them
 at their door. Whilst the older       
 residents usually purchase specialist 
 items such as clothing and furniture  
 in Hexham, the remainder tend to visit
 Newcastle at some time to seek a wider
 range. The local shop is also the {   
{post office} and nearly everyone makes
 some kind of purchase there at some   
 time.
