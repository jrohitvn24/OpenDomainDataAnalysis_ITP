		<title>06Newcastle; Ouseburn Devel.</title>
		<content>    The Ouseburn flows South through a 
 deep{dene}to reach the Tyne East of   
 Newcastle.  In the north picturesque  
{Jesmond Dene}is a pleasant contrast to
  city life with bridges, walks,       
 waterfalls, historic buildings and a  
 restaurant.  Children enjoy Pets'     
 Corner and picnic and play on the open
 spaces.  The{Sunday Market}on the     
{Armstrong Bridge}industrial monument  
 is an outlet for local artists and    
 craft goods.                          
 Below the Bridge the Dene changes     
 character with a proposed flyover on  
 an area of allotments and pigeon{crees
 followed by redeveloped pottery works 
 and a newly landscaped area for       
 starter factories beneath the graceful
 concrete metro viaduct.  Beyond the   
{Byker city farm}a small basin off the 
 Tyne, overlooked by warehouses, is    
 used by a mixture of small boats.     </content>
