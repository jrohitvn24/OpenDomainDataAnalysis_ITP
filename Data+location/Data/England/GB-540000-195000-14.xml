		<title>14A day in the life of J.Gow</title>
		<content>  I wake up at about 7.30am, get       
 dressed, and I'm down in the kitchen  
 at about 7.55, when I feed the cats. I
 usually only have a glass of milk for 
 breakfast, and then I leave for{school
 at about 8.30am for lessons that start
 at 8.55.                              
  We normally start with maths or      
 English, or we finish the work from   
 the day before. Each day we have an   
 assembly when the whole school meets  
 together. We have a short break in the
 morning and the afternoon. I don't    
 like school dinners and so I have     
 sandwiches. After lunch we do Topic   
 work, which I prefer, and school      
 finishes at 3.30pm.                   
  When I get home I have a cup of tea  
 and watch T.V. or play on my BBC      
 computer. On Tuesday's I go to scouts 
 from 8pm-9.50pm. I get to bed,        
 normally, at about 9.30pm.            </content>
