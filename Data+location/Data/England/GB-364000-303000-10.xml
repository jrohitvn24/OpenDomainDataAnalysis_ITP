		<title>10MERRYTHOUGHT TOYS IRONBRIDGE</title>
		<content>  The company was started by Mr Holmes'
 grandfather in 1930, in a building    
 which had belonged to Coalbrookdale   
 Company. 60 people are employed at    
 Merrythought Toys. The jobs are       
 designing, cutting, sewing, stuffing, 
 finishing and packing. The best       
 selling toy is the green              
 hippopotamus. The special line is a   
 6'6"teddy bear. The toy they have made
 for the longest is the parrot, it was 
 first made in 1931. 25% of the toys   
 are exported, the main countries are  
 America, Canada and Australia. They   
 make 600 toys a day and 12,000 a      
 month. Merrythought means a wishbone  
 so it is their trademark. A famous    
 Merrythought teddy, Mr Woppit,        
 survived Donald Campbell's fatal      
 waterspeed crash. His daughter Gina   
 took the bear with her when she tried 
 to break the record.                  </content>
