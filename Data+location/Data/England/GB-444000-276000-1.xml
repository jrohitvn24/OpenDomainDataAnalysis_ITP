		<content>  The twelve Km squares allotted to    
 the Lawrence Sheriff School basically 
 consist of the following:             
    The majority of our area is covered
 by farm land, much of which is used to
 grow arable crops.The remainder       
 provides grazing for cattle and sheep.
    In these squares there are also    
 five villages.Harborough Parva and    
 Little Lawford are very small         
 -consisting of only a farm and two or 
 three houses-and are therefore not    
 included in our survey.Long Lawford,  
 King's Newnham and Church Lawford are 
 larger and are described in greater   
 detail later on in the text.          
    This information is illustrated    
 under specific titles on the following
 pages.
