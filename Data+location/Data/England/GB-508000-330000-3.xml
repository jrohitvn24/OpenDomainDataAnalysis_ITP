   Farming dominates local life. The   
 land is either flat fenland or gently 
 undulating and the soil is extremely  
 fertile.                              
   A hundred years ago Lincolnshire    
 Long Wool sheep, famous for the great 
 weight and long staple of their       
 fleeces, flourished in this area. The 
 Pointon Flock, bred and improved by   
 the Casswell family since 1771, was   
 dispersed in December 1912. The       
 highest price they received for a ram 
 was 500 guineas, an enormous sum at   
 that time and known as the Pointon    
 Record.Although there are still flocks
 of sheep in the area,arable farming   
 has now taken over.Hedges have been   
 ripped out and great fields of        
 wheat,barley,potatoes,peas,onions,    
 brassicas and rape dominate the       
 landscape.                            </content>
