		<title>09Wellhouse Hospital</title>
		<content> The building dates back to 1834, when 
 it was a workhouse, set up by the     
 Guardians of the Poor.                
 Many believe that Charles Dickens     
 wrote Oliver Twist as an example of   
 life in this Workhouse in 1835. In    
 1895 a sixty-bed infirmary was added. 
 It was now called "Wellhouse Home".   
 In 1913 six new wards were added and  
 it became the "Wellhouse Hospital"    
 Between 1914 and 1918 (during the     
 Great War), the building was used as a
 military hospital.                    
 In 1920 it returned to civilian use   
 once again.                           
 Several temporary huts (intended to   
 last 10 years) were added in 1939.    
 They are still there!                 
 The final change in its name occurred 
 in 1951, when it became Barnet        
 General.                              
                                       </content>
