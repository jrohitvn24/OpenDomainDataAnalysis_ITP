		<title>19Life Styles</title>
		<content>   On asking for change of life styles 
 since the 2nd. war, we had a          
 surprising answer from a prominent    
 local-retired councillor.             
   During the war he was stationed at  
 Cassino, south of Rome, and on gazing 
 up at the local monastery, and at the 
 dead bodies at his feet, wondered how 
 God could allow such use of one of his
 retreats, as an enemy base.           
   At that moment he decided to change 
 his life and start to dedicate himself
 to helping others in some way.        
   On returning home he eventually     
 became involved with the Parish       
 Council, and was nominated onto       
 Nidderdale Rural District Council.    
   On the re-organisation of local     
 councils, he was elected onto         
 Harrogate District Council although   
 now retired from it,he is still active
 at village level.                     </content>
