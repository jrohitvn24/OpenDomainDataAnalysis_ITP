		<title>11THE RAMS OF SALISBURY PLAIN</title>
		<content> In the ten acre Long Barrow field     
 there was a flock of{fifty}rams. These
 were of two breeds, Suffolks and      
 Dorsets, and each one will cover      
 between 35 and 40 ewes during October 
 and November, to lamb late March early
 April 1986.                           
 The rams are aged between 3 and 6     
 years. The Dorset breed produces lambs
 that mature early, of lighter weight, 
 which should fetch a good price at the
 beginning of the season, while the    
 Suffolk lambs mature much later,      
 producing a heavier carcase. Hopefully
 these will also catch a good late     
 market after the price has dipped and 
 picked up again.                      
 Although the farm has reduced its ewe 
 flock from 3,000 to 1,200 recently it 
 is possibly the largest flock to be   
 lambed under cover. Plenty of work for
 the shepherds as well as the rams!    </content>
