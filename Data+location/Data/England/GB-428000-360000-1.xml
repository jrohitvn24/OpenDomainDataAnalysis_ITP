		<content>{Matlock}occupies a central position in
 the county of{Derbyshire.}The town is 
 built mainly on the side of the valley
 of the River Derwent.The river has    
 eroded a wide, flat-bottomed valleyin 
 the shaley rock and this is overlooked
 by a steep, gritstone escarpment to   
 the East.To the West of the river, the
 limestone of the southern tip of the  
 Pennines is exposed.                  
 Most of the residential buildings are 
 built on the steep eastern escarpment 
 above the flood level of the river.The
 shops and business premises, however, 
 cluster around the bridge.            
 Four main roads converge on the       
 bridge.
