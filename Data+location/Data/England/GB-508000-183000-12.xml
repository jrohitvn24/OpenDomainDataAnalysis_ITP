		<content>  There are not very many shops in the 
 area,  but  here  are  some  of them; 
 grocers, the  bakery,  Wimpy  bar and 
 sweet shops.                          
  New measures  are currently proposed 
 that   may   stop  local  shops  from 
 displaying   their   goods   on  the  
 pavements.                            
                                       
           {Green-grocers.}            
  In 1985,  if  you went shopping in a 
 green-grocer's shop, you would expect 
 to find {Fruit}&amp; {Vegetables.         
{ Bananas}are a fruit  you  might buy. 
 They are about 10 cm  in length and 6 
 to 8 cm  round.  This  fruit grows in 
 tropical  climates. It grows on trees 
 and is picked  when  green. When they 
 are bought, bananas are yellow.       
   Other  fruits  that  you  might buy 
 include   peaches,   nectarines   and 
 cherries (about 65p/lb).              </content>
