		<title>10LEISURE SURVEY</title>
		<content> For this project, Neela and I did a   
 survey in Ickenham. We asked the      
 shoppers six simple questions:-       
  1) If you want to see a film, where  
 do you go?                            
  2) do you think there should be more 
 entertainment in Ickenham?            
  3)If so, what?                       
  4)For what age group would you like  
 the entertainment to be aimed at?     
  5) would you like a disco or         
 youthclub for younger people?         
  We discovered in answer to question  
 one that most people seemed to go to  
 London.Harrow and Rayners Lane were   
 also popular for cinemas.             
  Most people wanted more entertainment
 in Ickenham,(except for one           
 person).Sports, cinemas, and discos   
 were the most popular requests, with  
 clubs and bingo coming next.
