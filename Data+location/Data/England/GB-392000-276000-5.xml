		<title>05RECREATION CENTRE</title>
		<content>   {Belbroughton Recreation Centre}was 
 built on land purchased by {Public    
{Subscription }in {1920.}The land was  
 used as a playing field by the cricket
 and football clubs. Swings for the    
 children were provided by {George Vth 
{Silver Jubilee }funds.                
   The need for a recreation centre    
 became pressing. Funding came from the
{Sports Council, District Council}and  
{local effort.}The centre was opened in
 1980 at a cost of {Â£42,000.}It is run 
 by a committee of local people. The   
{Parish Council}gives a maintenance    
 grant of{Â£300}per annum for the field 
 and buildings. This is augmented by   
 lettings to the{football club}and the 
{youth club. }                         
   At its opening the centre was       
 described as {"the best thing that has
{happened in this village for over a   
{Century."}                            </content>
