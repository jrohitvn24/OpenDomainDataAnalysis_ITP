		<title>10Education in Saxilby Area</title>
		<content> Older children travel out  of  Saxilby
 for  secondary  education  (at present
 being re-organised) but Saxilby Church
 of England Controlled  Primary  School
 caters  for  the  5-11 year olds. This
 Autumn term 1985 there are 253  pupils
 on  roll  with  a  teaching staff of 9
 (including head teacher) supported  by
 a  caretaker,  cleaner, 4 midday meals
 supervisors, a welfare  assistant  and
 secretary.  This  roll  will  rise  to
 about 275 by the summer term 1986. For
 the 7 years 1974-1980 there were  more
 than  400  children on roll during the
 summer term. The school was built in 3
 separate phases between 1970 and  1976
 and  comprises  2 single storey blocks
 totalling 10 class areas without doors
 joined together  by  a  square  multi-
 purpose  hall. Most children live near
 the school, a few are transported from
 nearby hamlets like Broxholme.        </content>
