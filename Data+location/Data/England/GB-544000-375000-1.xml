 small town of{Alford,}the village of  
{Bilsby}and the surrounding            
 countryside.                          
 Alford is a{market town,}banking      
 centre, education centre and a town   
 where people come to work. It has a   
 central market place with shops around
 it. Three main roads run from the     
 market place with houses in between.  
 The village of Bilsby has grown during
 the last few years and has a pub,     
 church and a shop.                    
 The countryside is flat covered by    
 large fields which grow crops. We have
 one large dairy farm in our area.     
 The climate is quite dry but we get a 
 lot of low cloud and mist in summer.  
 Alford has become more important as a 
 tourist centre over the last few years
 with the start of the Friday{craft
