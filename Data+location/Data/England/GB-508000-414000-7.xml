 All the big lorries used to go through
 our village to get to the docks at    
 Immingham and the oil refineries. The 
 main road through the village was very
 dangerous and a lorry crashed into the
 telephone box and knocked it down. Now
 there is a new motorway link road and 
 most of the big lorries go round the  
 village. There used to be a fly-over  
 the railway at Ulceby Skitter but now 
 that has been taken away and there is 
 a level crossing with big gates. You  
 have to wait until the trains have    
 gone. The children who live at Ulceby 
 Skitter used to have to walk to school
 but the taxi brought them because the 
 road was so dangerous. This year they 
 were going to stop the taxi because   
 there are no lorries but some Mums got
 up a petition and the Council decided 
 to keep Mrs. Toyne's taxi anyway.     </content>
