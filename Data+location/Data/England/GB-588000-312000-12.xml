 THERE ARE 7 COUNCELLORS WHO MEET AT   
 INTERVALS TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS IN THE  
 PARISH AND TO KEEP AN EYE ON PLANNING 
 AND THE TIDINESS OF THE AREA.   AT THE
 MOMENT THEY ARE WORKING TO            
 RE-ESTABLISH THE FOOTPATHS AND        
 BRIDLEPATHS WHICH HAVE ALMOST         
 DISAPPEARED THROUGH LACK OF USE.      
                                       
 THEY ARE ALSO FIGHTING TO GET A SPEED 
 LIMIT ALONG THE A47 TRUNK ROAD AND    
 PASS ON COMPLAINTS OF ROAD CONDITIONS 
 ETC.                                  
                                       
 A YOUTHCLUB IS VERY BADLY NEEDED NOW  
 THAT THERE ARE MORE CHILDREN IN THE   
 VILLAGE AND A VOLUNTEER IS REQUIRED.
