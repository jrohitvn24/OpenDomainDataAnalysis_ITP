		<title>11FARMING AROUND SKELMERSDALE</title>
		<content>   Farming has always played a very    
 important part in the lives of people 
 in our area. Much of the land is used 
 for agriculture and the town of       
 Skelmersdale is built on land         
 previously used for farming.          
                                       
   Many farmers are tenants who pay a  
 rent to the landowner. One such farmer
 is Mr. Tom Hurst who works land       
 belonging to Lord Derby's estate.     
                                       
   The following is an edited version  
 of an interview with Mr. Hurst:       
                                       
 COULD YOU TELL US THE NAME OF YOUR    
 FARM? Yes, it is called Bullen's Farm.
 DO YOU OWN THE FARM? No,my brother    
 and I are tenants. The land is part of
 Lord Derby's estate.                  
 HOW LONG HAS YOUR FAMILY WORKED HERE? 
 Since 1693 at least,maybe longer.     </content>
