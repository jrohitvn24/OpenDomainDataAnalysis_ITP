		<title>16TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>  {Road}is the only means of transport 
 in this area.People really need to    
 have their own means of transport,as  
 public transport is now very limited. 
 Most families have at least 1 car and 
 some more.                            
{                                      
{  Public transport}is on most days    
 restricted to one bus to Northallerton
 in the morning and one bus making the 
 return journey in the evening.On      
 market days there is another bus put  
 on to allow people to reach the       
 market.                               
                                       
   Some of the minor roads are very    
 narrow and slow-moving farm vehicles  
 can hold up the traffic at times.
