		<title>01Location, Turvey</title>
		<content> The area is gently undulating,        
 attractive landscape, traversed by the
 upper reaches of the River Ouse.To the
 west is open landscape,predominantly  
 an arable farming area based on       
 Boulder clay above 200 feet and light 
 gravelly soils in the river valley.To 
 the east of the river is more arable  
 farming and some pasture,the most     
 outstanding feature being the parkland
 around Turvey. A band of Oolitic      
 limestone runs through the area,once  
 quarried and used for local building. 
 Many of the limestone buildings date  
 from 18th and 19th century. The       
 increasingly busy A428 road crosses   
 the area.Traffic travels fast even    
 through the villages.A by-pass for    
 Turvey is proposed which will pose    
 major problems through this area.
