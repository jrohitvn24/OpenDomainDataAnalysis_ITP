		<content>Being in the Vale of the White Horse,  
the land is very flat. Farms are the   
dominant feature of the landscape.     
They average 200 acres in size, and    
are primarily engaged in dairy farming 
and crop-growing. There are only two   
residential areas : the village of     
Charney Bassett and the smaller hamlet 
Lyford. The River Ock flows in a       
north- easterly direction, and after   
being joined by Land Brook and Childrey
Brook meets the River Thames at        
Abingdon.   Historic buildings include 
manor houses and almshouses. The most  
interesting is Charney Manor which is  
owned by Quakers and used as a retreat 
&amp; conference centre. Modern life in    
the area contains few amenities, but   
Charney Bassett has an active and      
varied social life. Public transport   
has decreased gradually over the years 
, and there are few buses.             </content>
