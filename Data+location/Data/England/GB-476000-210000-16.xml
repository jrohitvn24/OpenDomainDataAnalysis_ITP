There is very little un-employment in  
Stone. People do a wide variety of     
jobs.                                  
Some people from the village work      
locally, in the hospital,school, shops,
public houses and on farms.            
Many more work in Aylesbury in the     
factories and shops. Alot of the  jobs 
are dealing with high technology but   
also many are working in offices.      
Fewer people , but still quite a number
travel into London (25 miles) every    
day.They travel by train from Aylesbury
or Princes Risborough or by car along  
the M40.                               
Some people own their own small        
factories making a wide variety of     
goods.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
