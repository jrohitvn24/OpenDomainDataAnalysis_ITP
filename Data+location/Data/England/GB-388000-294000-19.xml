		<title>19Housing in Penn Area</title>
		<content>The area around our school is mainly   
residential. It consists of more or    
less entirely semi-detached houses. All
the houses are privately owned and none
are owned by the council.They have     
decent sized gardens and quite a lot   
have a garage. The houses are not      
terraced and only a few are detached.  
The house interiors range from two to  
four bedrooms and all have at least one
bathroom. They mainly have seperate    
dining rooms and lounges although some 
have just one big room. The kitchens   
are usually a reasonable size although 
some may be a bit cramped. A couple of 
the houses in the area have solar      
panelling but most houses have central 
heating. The area is a smokeless zone  
and so no wood or coal fires are       
allowed to be burnt, although a few    
houses use smokeless fuel.
