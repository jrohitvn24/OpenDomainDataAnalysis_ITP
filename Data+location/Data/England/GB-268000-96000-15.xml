		<content>   Spreyton School visited Andy Hampers
 in 1985 to find out what they do      
 there.It is only half a mile away so  
 we walked.                            
   We were told that Mr.Anderton       
 started the hamper business in 1963   
 with an investment of Â£60.Now it has a
 holiday business,a jewellery business 
 and the hampers and it is getting     
 bigger each year.                     
   At Spreyton they employ             
 twenty,mostly local people who they   
 train.Some of the young people who    
 have just left school go to Exeter    
 College to learn about office work,   
 computers and things, once a week.At  
 Hull,Andy Hampers employ twelve other 
 people.                               
   The customer pays money each week   
 throughout the year and at christmas  
 they get their hamper of meat,cakes,  
 wine,chocolates and all sorts.        </content>
