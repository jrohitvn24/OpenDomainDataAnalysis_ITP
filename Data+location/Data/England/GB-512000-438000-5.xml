		<content> Not many people from Skirlaugh work in
 the village, just a few at the Council
 Offices. Most people go into Hull to  
 work but some go to Beverley or       
 Hornsea or some other villages.       
 Not many people work on the farms but 
 there are a lot of teachers live here.
 We were going to make a chart of the  
 number of people doing each job but   
 there were too many with just one     
 person so people do all sorts of      
 different kinds of jobs but most of   
 them work in offices or shops or      
 schools.                              
 Most of the people go to work in their
 cars but some have got cars from the  
 firm.                                 
 A few people don't go to work because 
 they are too old or because they      
 can't get a job. My dad says some of  
 them are too lazy to work.
