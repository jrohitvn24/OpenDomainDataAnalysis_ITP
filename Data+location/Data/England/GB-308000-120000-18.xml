		<content> For breakfast most people have cereal,
 toast and a drink. Some people have a 
 cooked breakfast which consists of    
 bacon, egg, fried bread  and fried    
 tomatoes. The next meal that most     
 people have is their dinner, they eat 
 this at about midday. Quite a lot of  
 people have a cooked meal at this time
 six days a week. This would probably  
 consist of some kind of cooked meat   
 such as beef, lamb or pork served with
 two vegetables and gravy. In the      
 summer meat with salad including      
 lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber is     
 often eaten. The meal could finish    
 with a pudding or cheese and biscuits.
 The third meal of the day is tea at   
 about 5 o'clock. Often this is a snack
 of cheese or egg on toast or just     
 bread, butter and jam and cakes. At   
 weekends eating habits change         
 according to peoples activities.      </content>
