		<title>16WATER MAMMALS.</title>
		<content> Most water mammals grow up to be the  
size of a large rat such as the coypu. 
The coypu looks like a large plump,    
brown guinea pig with a long tail,     
webbed back feet and orange teeth.It   
escaped from a fur farm-belonging to   
South America.A very good swimmer and  
diver.It feeds on water side           
plants,burrows in banks.Coypu are      
controlled by trapping because of the  
damage they cause to the banks of the  
river.They sometimes eat crops.The     
Otter is another large mammal.ItÂ£s     
very shy and likes lonely places.Used  
to be common in the Broads but rare    
now.Glossy brown body.Flat head with   
lots of whiskers. Feeds on small       
fish.The water vole is very small and  
looks like a small rat, glossy brown   
coat and tiny ears.It eats             
plants,grass and minibeasts.
