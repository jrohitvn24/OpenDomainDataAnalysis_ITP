		<title>08The Northgate</title>
		<content> The Northgate is the only relic left  
 to Bridgnorth of the Old Town.  It is 
 a stone Gate-House.  It is not known  
 when it was built.  A Norman Arch     
 connected with the Gateway, but this  
 had been hidden by other buildings    
 until 1821, when it was demolished to 
 make room for some more buildings.    
 Now in 1985, there is a Museum over   
 the Northgate.  Small vehicles are    
 able to travel under the Gateway and  
 on one side, there is a restaurant and
 on the other a shop.  In 1645, on May 
 21st., Colonel Billingsley was ordered
 to bring soldiers and ammunition to   
 the Northgate to fortify it.  The     
 Parliamentary Forces from Shrewsbury  
 came via the Broseley Road and were   
 unable to enter the Town Via the      
 Northgate.  Shortly afterwards, the   
 same soldier was killed in attempting 
 to defend St. Leonards Church.        </content>
