		<content>      There are three different types  
 of school in the area. Goodwyns First 
 (120 pupils aged 5_8) and Goodwyns    
 middle (170 pupils aged 8_12) these   
 are funded by Surrey County Council.  
 St.Johns First (60 pupils aged 5_8)   
 gets some of its money from the       
 Church Of England. All schools need to
 raise money from sponsored            
 events,fairs,jumble sales etc. to buy 
 extras such as  musical,P.E,video or  
 computer equipment.                   
      Many teachers have been taking   
 action this year to protest about the 
 size of their salaries. Strikes have  
 affected both the Goodwyns schools and
 some teachers are refusing to attend  
 parent and staff mettings.            
      All staff interviewed think that 
 the greatest change in primary        
 education this year is the growing use
 of computers.                         </content>
