		<content> This part of North Devon is very hilly
 with the higher points just over 500  
 feet. The district is rural, sparsely 
 populated &amp; almost entirely devoted to
 farming. It contains 14 farms which   
 are mostly small family concerns of   
 about 100 acres. 9 of these are mixed 
 dairy &amp; the remainder deal mainly with
 beef &amp; sheep. During recent years 6   
 farms have ceased to exist with the   
 land being sold to neighbouring farms.
 The area is covered by a network of   
 narrow lanes with high banks &amp; hedges 
 which are so typical of North Devon - 
 the only major road being a short     
 stretch of the Bideford/Holsworthy    
 road which crosses the extreme South  
 East corner of the block. Particular  
 features of the area are the heavily  
 wooded oak escarpments &amp; the lack of  
 trees in the hedgerows due to the high
 winds.                                </content>
