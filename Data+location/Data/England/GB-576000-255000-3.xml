		<title>03THE CHEREDDEN GARDEN CLUB</title>
		<content>The name of the club is derived from   
the names of the villages - Chevington,
Chedburgh, Rede and Depden. The club   
was started in October 1979 with just  
6 members, today we have 62 members.   
We meet once a month at the Erskine    
Centre, Chedburgh, sometimes having a  
lecturer come along to talk on some    
aspect of gardening; we show slides and
have discussions, as well as, a        
competition, raffle and refreshments.  
Once or twice a year we have an outing 
to a well known garden. We also have an
'open' evening, usually in July, when  
we visit members gardens.              
Every September is our Show with 1st   
2nd &amp; 3rd prizes for every event; a cup
is given to the person with the most   
points. In October we elect Committee  
Members by voting.  At Christmas we    
have an evening with either a Dinner &amp; 
Dance or a Dinner &amp; Games.             </content>
