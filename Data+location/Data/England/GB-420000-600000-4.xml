		<title>04Acklington Cattle Market</title>
		<content>{The mart}has been at Acklington for   
 about 80 years. It is owned by a      
 company of Alnwick Farmers (approx.   
 150). At present it is open 3 days a  
 week and there are 8 full-time and    
 between 20-30 part-time workers.      
                                       
 The animals get carried to the market 
 in cattle waggons. Some come from as  
 far away as Scotland. The railway used
 to be very helpful for transporting   
 animals to the mart, but it is not    
 used for that purpose now.            
                                       
 Sheep and cattle are sold every week. 
 Prices can range from Â£5 to Â£1,000 per
 animal. Some of the livestock bought  
 will end up on dinner tables all over 
 Britain, even on the Continent.       
                                       
 The mart has its own canteen which is 
 always well used by the farmers.      </content>
