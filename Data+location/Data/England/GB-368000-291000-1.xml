		<title>01The Town of Bridgnorth</title>
		<content> Bridgnorth is a typical small Market  
 Town with interesting historical      
 associations.  There is evidence to   
 show that settlements existed in the  
 times of the Saxons and Danes and, in 
 and around Bridgnorth, there is a     
 wealth of inheritance from the Norman 
 Conquest.  Its first charter dates    
 from 1157, and the freemen, or        
 burgesses, of Bridgnorth played a real
 part in the government of the town.   
 Since 1835, Bridgnorth has had a Town 
 Mayor, and the Civic Regalia is used  
 on ceremonial occasions such as the   
 Traditional Mayor-making and Civic    
 Sunday.  A number of timbered building
 from the 17th. century are still in   
 evidence though much was destroyed by 
 fire at the time of the Civil War in  
 1646.  Much of the character of the   
 town has been retained and it is a    
 popular tourist centre in the Summer. </content>
