		<title>13Traffic on the Wickwar road.</title>
		<content> The only industry in our square is the
 Quarry which lies beside the B4060    
 road from Wickwar to Chipping Sodbury.
 This is an important road which takes 
 heavy traffic from Chipping Sodbury,  
 towards Wotton under Edge and there is
 a link to the M5 motorway at Falfield.
 It is a busy road.In only twenty      
 minutes 48 cars,20 heavy lorries and 5
 vans passed our survey point.Many of  
 the heavy lorries were going to and   
 from Chipping Sodbury Quarry.The      
 hamlet of Yate Rocks in the north-west
 of our square lies close to the main  
 road but most of the traffic,by-passes
 the houses.This is an interesting     
 place because of the Ford in the      
 middle of the village.The bus route on
 the B4060 is the Service 321 Yate to  
 Wotton-two buses each way per day-and 
 the 328 Bristol to Wickwar,via        
 Chipping Sodbury-two buses per day.   </content>
