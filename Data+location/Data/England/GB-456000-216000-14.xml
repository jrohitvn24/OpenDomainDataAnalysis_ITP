		<title>14ASTLEY BRIDGE FARM (3)</title>
		<content>At Astley Bridge Farm the wheat and    
barley is sown in the Autumn.It is     
harvested in August using the combine  
harvester.At the front of the combine  
there is a large revolving wheel and   
a cutting blade which cuts the corn and
gathers it into the machine.The ears of
the corn is separated from the stalks. 
The straw comes out of the back of the 
combine.It is baled later,loaded onto a
trailer and stored in the barn.This    
straw is worth about 100 pounds a ton. 
It can be used as winter feed for the  
cattle.Some of the wheat and barley    
they grow is sent to the mills to be   
ground into flour.Rape is a recent     
crop that has been grown.It is used to 
help make margarine and cooking oil.
