		<title>2017th.c.FAIRE,BRILL,JUNE,1985</title>
		<content>Last week we were celebrating the 300th
anniversary of the windmill on the     
common.It lasted for 2 days.Most people
from Brill were dressed in 17th.c.     
clothes.The faire opened at 10am.but   
most people arrived at the common early
afternoon.There were lots of stalls    
such as a biscuit stall which raised   
money for Brill school.There were lots 
of shows such as recorder and maypole  
concerts and dancing.Lots of people    
bought clay medallions with windmills  
on the front.There were also games     
including the slippery pole.The dances 
started at eight but the pig was eaten 
at ten.Then the final moment came.The  
windmill was lit up and the fireworks  
were set off.Everyone sang Happy       
Birthday to the windmill.              
     This report was made by class 4   
children at Brill School,June,1985.
