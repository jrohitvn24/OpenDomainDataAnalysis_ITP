		<content> We play many different games, some{   
{competitive,}like football, netball,  
 basketball, cricket, and rounders, but
 others, like skipping, crocodile,     
 polo, double-ball, stuck-in-the-mud,  
 and British bulldog are{just for fun. 
 The fun games are usually played in   
 our school playground, but sometimes  
 we play them at home.{Laggy}is played 
 by stretching elastic between two     
 people's legs, and a third person     
 trying to move the elastic with their 
 own feet. The games{crocodile, polo, }
 and{ice cream}are all played in a     
 similar way. One child stands near a  
 wall facing another group of children 
 who stand in a line about 2 metres    
 away. The idea is to reach the wall   
 without being seen. We also play many{
{chasing games,}like{kiss-chase,       
{stuck-in-the-mud,}and{British bulldog.
