		<title>02The Farmland.</title>
		<content> The soil is chalk, limestone or clay  
 and crops grown include barley, wheat,
 sugar-beet, oilseed rape,( recently   
 popular) and potatoes. Many hedges and
 fences have been removed and few trees
 now grow in the fields used for crops.
 Few farm labourers are employed full  
 time because farms are small and      
 modern. Farm machinery such as combine
 harvesters, tractors and ploughs,     
 sprayers and tillers are used in the  
 fields which are much larger now, so  
 that these machines can be used over  
 large areas without obstacles. The    
 farms are mostly mixed being arable   
 but also having sheep and cattle. The 
 Uffington C of E school children enjoy
 special visits each year to watch the 
 sheep lambing and later on the sheep  
 shearing and dipping at Croft Farm,   
 near the school, in the village of    
 Uffington.                            </content>
