		<content>   There are patches of waste land     
 round the back of St. John's, near    
 Clammerclough Road, Lark Hill and     
 Primrose Street.  In some places,     
 especially near St.John's School where
 houses have been demolished the land  
 has been grassed and trees planted.  A
 long seat has been put near Gerrard   
 St.on a new grassy mound.  A          
 children's playground with swings,    
 climbing frame, grass and bushes has  
 been built on waste land at the end of
 Lord Street.                          
                                       
   New Park is a large area of land    
 overlooking the river Irwell. It has  
 been planted with deciduous and       
 evergreen trees and contains rabbits, 
 foxes and all sorts of birds and      
 butterflies. The ferns of Farnworth   
 also grow here. Some can be found in  
 St. John's school grounds.            </content>
