 was overcrowded so another town was   
 needeed to provide both housing and   
 jobs.

 30 years old and was the first part to
 be built.We have done a survey in our 
 class to find out where the children, 
 and their parents and grandparents    
 were born.Most children were born in{ 
{Ascot}at our local hospital,but a lot 
 of parents and grandparents were born 
 in{London.
