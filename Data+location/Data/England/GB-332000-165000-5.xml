 In early July the saltmarsh is rather 
 nice, the plants are really colourful 
 and you can see right out to Flat     
 Holm.  There are many plants such as  
 Sea Aster, Cord grass and Grasswort.  
 As you go further out on the saltmarsh
 the grasses turn into mud.  There are 
 a lot of channels going out to the    
 sea, some of them have water and some 
 do not.                               
 There is an abundance of wildlife on  
 the marsh and in the mud there are    
 ragworms and crabs that live in the   
 trenches.  There might even be        
 musk-rats living in the banks.        
 Shelduck are to be found in quite     
 considerable numbers on the fringe of 
 the marsh.
