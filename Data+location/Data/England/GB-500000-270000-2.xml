SMITH'S CONTAINERS is at the bottom of 
Thorpe Street. It makes plastic        
containers and the factory itself is   
very large and modern. It is two floors
high and employs many people.          
                                       
COGGIN'S factory is up the top of      
Marshalls Road and is about half the   
size of Smith's. They make shoes and   
the factory is an old brick building.  
                                       
THE TANNERY is in Wellington Road and  
the factory is very large. It makes    
shoe cuttings and leather to send to   
shoe factories.                        
                                       
There are many other factories in      
Raunds that have closed down now. Two  
of these are Spire Shoes and James     
Chambers, which have closed because of 
the economic depression.               </content>
