		<title>15HEALTH AROUND POOL FARM</title>
		<content>Health is a very important part of our 
life.The handicapped people around here
have no place where they can meet,go on
day trips or just talk to each other.  
There are not enough {health visitors} 
around {Pool Farm} to check up on the  
people who have children but do not    
take care of them.DaveÂ£s Health Factory
is a very good place where people can  
enjoy getting healthy and keep that    
way.Dave tells you what to do if you   
are if you are suffering from something
but want to do something about it.Hayf-
ever sufferes are not helped because   
around Pool Farm there are too many fi-
elds and bits of grass.When it gets cut
then that is when the people suffer.The
clinic in Pool Farm provides a useful  
service for the many families on the   
estate.It is good because it is near to
many homes.By children of St.Pauls     
School.                                </content>
