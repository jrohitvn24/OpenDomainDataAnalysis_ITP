		<title>05ST.GEORGE'S CHURCH,RODINGTON</title>
		<content> THE LADY WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO THE   
 CHURCH KEEPS THE KEYS TO IT. SHE LIKES
 TO KEEP THE CHURCH LOCKED BECAUSE SHE 
 IS AFRAID OF VANDALS SPOILING THE     
 BEAUTY OF IT. ST. GEORGE'S HAS ONLY   
 ONCE BEEN VANDALISED. SOME BOYS BROKE 
 INTO THE CHURCH, AND MADE A MESS WITH 
 CIGARETTE ENDS, BUT DID NOT STEAL     
 ANYTHING. SHE IS HAPPY TO OPEN THE    
 CHURCH TO ANY VISITORS, LIKE THE LADY 
 WHO HAD EMIGRATED TO AUSTRALIA BUT    
 CAME BACK TO SEE THE CHURCH SHE HAD   
 BEEN MARRIED IN YEARS BEFORE. A NEW   
 RECTOR CAME IN JANUARY. HE HAS THREE  
 OTHER PARISHES BESIDES RODINGTON. HE  
 BELIEVES THE CHURCH SHOULD BE OPEN TO 
 EVERYONE.THE RECTOR TAKES 4 SERVICES  
 ON SUNDAY, BUT NOT ALWAYS IN RODINGTON
 THE RECTOR'S FAVOURITE SERVICE IS HOLY
 COMMUNION. ABOUT 26 PEOPLE REGULARLY  
 ATTEND CHURCH, BUT THERE ARE OFTEN    
 LESS THAN 18 PEOPLE AT A SERVICE.     </content>
