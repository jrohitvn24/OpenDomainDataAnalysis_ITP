		<title>16Recreation in Woodford</title>
		<content>  As Woodford is a village most of the 
 recreation is on a community basis.If 
 the residents wish to go to the       
 cinema,dancing or to the theatre they 
 either have to go into Stockport or   
 Manchester.                           
  Entertainment in the village is      
 centred around clubs and associations 
 which meet in either the British      
 Legion Hall or in Woodford War        
 Memorial Community Centre.Many of the 
 children who attend Queensgate Primary
 School have connections with many of  
 these clubs.                          
  Scouts and Guides both meet in the   
 British Legion Hall on a weekly       
 basis.On Thursday 20th June 1985 the  
 guides held a special 75th anniversary
 camp fire on the field adjacent to the
 hall.This field is owned by the people
 of Woodford.
