		<title>10Agriculture in The Lee</title>
		<content> There are 11 farms covering this area,
 of which Church &amp; Home Farm combine to
 form the Manor Estate. Use of land is 
 evenly divided by arable &amp; pasture. 1 
 farm has a milking herd of 80 cows &amp;  
 other pasture for store cattle &amp;      
 sheep. Work is mainly done with       
 tractors, &amp; some hedges have been     
 removed to make larger fields. The    
 largest farm has 5 tractors; a farm in
 Lee Common has very little land but   
 rents where possible &amp; 2 brothers do  
 contract work with their machinery.   
 Apart from the Manor, farms are under 
 150 acres. There is a small area of   
 factory farming; there are broiler    
 houses in Swan Bottom. Several small  
 paddocks, separate from the farms in  
 various locations, provide pasture for
 horses. The woodland, owned by the    
 Liberty Estate, is well managed larch 
 &amp; beech.                              </content>
