		<content>Origins                                
Henry Prince First School was built 136
years ago.The Reverend Charles Layard  
owned some land and genorously gave    
some to build a school on.The          
Derbyshire Advertiser at that time     
 said At an early hour of the morning  
on Thursday 19th.April the bells of    
the pretty village of Mayfield,on the  
banks of the silvery Dove,rang out a   
joyous peal to announce to the         
inhabitants the opening of the elegant 
and substantially {erected school.' The
school cost  only 780 pounds.The money 
was raised by people of Mayfield.Henry 
Prince,himself,was a farmer.In his     
will he left 200 pounds to help the    
school.The next vicar gave another     
piece of land and they built a         
school house for the Headmaster to     
live in.There have been 8 Headmasters  
so far.                                </content>
