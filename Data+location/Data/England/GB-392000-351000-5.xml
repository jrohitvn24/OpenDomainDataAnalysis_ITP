		<title>05The Plough Car Park Problem.</title>
		<content>    The Plough public house in Endon   
was given permission,by the local      
district council,to extend by building 
a carvery and a new porch.The number of
patrons increased considerably.However,
when the car park was full,motorists   
would leave their cars on the roadside 
next to the Plough.This often caused   
homeowners'drives to be blocked and    
complaints ensued.The brewery applied  
to buy Clifton House,a fine Victorian  
dwelling,next to the Plough.They were  
intending to demolish it to make room  
to enlarge the car park.Many local     
residents' thoughts were against this  
because of the dwelling's architectural
and historical merits.After much       
discussion the district council gave   
permission for the scheme in January   
1985.The brewery agreed to pay the     
owners 60,000 pounds to purchase       
Clifton House.                         </content>
