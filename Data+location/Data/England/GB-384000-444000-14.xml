		<content>My is name Keith and my mum is on a    
diet, but instead of losing weight she 
puts it on.                            
                                       
I am  fair healthy but I am a little   
colour blind.I go to the health        
clinic once a year to have my eyes     
tested.My Doctor is doctor G.H. Cooper 
but I know some other doctors called   
Dr.Brown and Dr.Chapman.               
                                       
A year ago I was playing tennis and as 
I struck, the bat hit my front tooth   
and it broke in half.Next day  I went  
to the dentist and they put a cap      
on.I went back to school but it came   
off while I was playing out,so I had   
to go to dentist again.They put a      
stronger cap on.Now I go for a check on
my teeth at least every two months.
