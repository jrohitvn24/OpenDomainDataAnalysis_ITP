		<content>   The countryside around Donington is 
 mainly taken up with farming. When we 
 went out to do our surveys we found   
 that the land is very flat, with no   
 hills at all. The land is divided in  
 to fields. Some have hedges as        
 boundaries but in many cases the      
 hedges have been removed. Most of the 
 fields are surrounded by ditches to   
 help the land to drain.               
   Some of the things we saw growing   
 were potatoes, cabbages, cauliflowers,
 wheat, barley and bulbs. There are    
 also some very large glass houses     
 covering several acres where          
 cauliflowers and cabbage plants are   
 started off and where tomatoes and    
 cucumbers are grown in the summer.
