		<content>{Mr Corkill}is the Salisbury Playhouse 
 Theatre Manager. His training took    
 about eighteen months. He had to visit
 other theatres, to learn all about    
 them. During his training, he worked  
 in every department, except wardrobe. 
 He did not like the acting part of his
 training, but he found all the        
 departments interesting. He came to   
 Salisbury in 1966, and has been       
 Manager for nine years. {Mr Corkill}is
 in charge of front of house, and the  
 Director is in charge of back-stage.  
 Fifty people work in front of house at
 Salisbury Playhouse. There are two    
 theatres in the Playhouse, the Main   
 Theatre and the Salberg Theatre. There
 is a loop system fitted in the main   
 theatre for the deaf and hard of      
 hearing.
