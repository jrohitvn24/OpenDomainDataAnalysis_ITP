		<title>05Dairy Farming</title>
		<content> Dairy farming,though not a major form 
 of farming is very important in this  
 area particularly:on the Weald Moors  
 at Preston,on Kynnesley Moor,Sleap    
 Moor and Crudgington Moor.In some     
 cases attempts have been made to turn 
 this land to arable use,but it seems  
 to be too difficult to drain          
 adequately.                           
  Fresian cattle are used for milk     
 production,they spend most of the     
 summer months grazing in the fields   
 but large amounts of silage(grass cut 
 when green and placed in heaps called 
 clamps)are made for winter feed.      
  Milk is collected daily by MMB bulk  
 tankers and taken to Crudgington      
 Creamery.                             
  Farms in the area are on average     
 200-450 acres in size.                
  Some Hereford,Hereford Cross and     
 Charlois cattle are reared for beef.  </content>
