		<content>I like living in Low Hill because you  
always have something to do. I think   
that in some places in Low Hill it is  
not kept tidy.I think that it is the   
fault of the people themselves. I don't
like the vandals in Low Hill and the   
trouble they cause.I saw one vandal    
throw a stone through my next door     
neighbour's window and it hit a 3 year 
old girl.I think that our street,Fourth
Ave, looks like the countryside because
there are lots of trees about.There are
plenty of parks near my home,eg Fowlers
Park,The Old Park (Adventure           
Playground)and the Bike Park.I think   
there should be play streets like      
Sharman Road,so there won't be as many 
accidents as there are now.When I was  
coming from school one afternoon I saw 
a boy knocked over by a car and I      
watched as he was taken to hospital.
