		<title>20Caldecote Farm</title>
		<content> When we arrived at Caldecote Farm my  
 first feeling was disappointment      
 because it was not a farm at all. It  
 was a riding stable. Not a stable that
 gave lessons but somswhere for horses 
 to stay on either half or full        
 livery. Full livery costs fourteen    
 pounds per week and for that the      
 grooms feed,exercise,and clean the    
 ponies. At the moment there are forty 
 nine ponies there so the grooms are   
 very busy. They have indoor training  
 rings,exercise paddocks and a jumping 
 ring for the ponies who are in        
 competitions. The owner is called     
 Roger and he lives in an old converted
 dairy. He has to get up at 6 am. to   
 get through the hectic routine. I     
 thought the horses were well looked   
 after and if I had a horse I would put
 him there.
