		<title>03TOURISM IN LITTLEPORT</title>
		<content>   There is very little tourism in     
 Littleport, apart from visitors       
 to Washingtons{caravan site}at        
 the New River, Littleport. Most       
 holiday people stay there for the     
{fishing,}and they stay there at any   
 time of the year. Littleport has three
 caravan sites _ Kiama, Kings and      
 Washingtons. Residential caravans are 
 often bought by Americans, who work at
 the local{USAF bases}at Mildenhall    
 and Lakenheath, and they own the      
 caravan as well as the land on which  
 it stands. Washingtons has only       
 recently become a caravan site,       
 although the Washington family have   
 owned the land for a long time.They   
 converted the grass land to a suitable
 site by building washing facilities   
 and toilets there.
