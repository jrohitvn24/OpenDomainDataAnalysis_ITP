 YEARS. HE ORIGINALLY CAME TO START A  
 BUS BUSINESS. HE FEELS THAT THE ROADS 
 HAVE CHANGED BUT LOCAL BUSINESSES HAVE
 CHANGED THE MOST. HE NOW USES A CAR   
 FOR HIS TRANSPORT. MR. TWINE WOULD    
 LIKE TO SEE EASTBOURNE AND POLEGATE   
 MORE SEPARATE.HE WORKED IN POLEGATE   
 WHICH WAS THEN A SMALL PLACE. THE     
 ORIGINAL TRANSPORT WAS THE RAILWAY.HE 
 ATTENDS A LOT OF POLEGATE CLUBS. HE   
 SAID PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN     
 POLEGATE BECAUSE IT'S NICELY SITUATED 
 AND NEAR EASTBOURNE AND ITS           
 FACILITIES.PEOPLE WOULD MAINLY COME   
 TO POLEGATE TO VISIT RELATIVES. HE
