		<title>06A past Mayor of Beverley</title>
		<content> One of Beverley's most notable        
 citizens is Councillor Harry Flynn.He 
 has been the mayor three times,       
 in 1957,1969 and in 1983.  He would   
 like to see changes in the governing  
 body, for he thinks that all the      
 members of the council do not come    
 from Beverley,so they do not know much
 about the state of the roads and local
 problems.  We asked him his funniest  
 moment and he told us about the time  
 he had to mend a broken doll in       
 Railway Street where a childrens home 
 used to be.  He was touring around the
 home when a little girl with a broken 
 doll came crying up to him.  He       
 thought that the elastic inside the   
 arm had snapped,and as there was      
 nothing else to do, he mended it for  
 her.  He has been to                  
 Canada,Scotland,America,Mexico,Poland,
 Asia,Africa and Sweden.               </content>
