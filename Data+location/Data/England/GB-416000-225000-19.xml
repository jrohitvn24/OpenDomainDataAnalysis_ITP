		<title>19SETTLEMENTS NEAR STOW</title>
		<content> Stow Parish is very small, including  
 only the original built-up area. In   
 the first edition of Domesday Book it 
 comes under Maugersbury which is now  
 just a hamlet 1km from Stow. It has a 
 Manor House and several farms and     
 covers a much larger area than Stow   
 Parish.                               
  The Swells, at the foot of the slope 
 to the west of Stow are two more      
 independent Parishes. Each has an     
 ancient Parish Church, but they share 
 their Parish Priest with Condicote and
 Longborough. Lower Swell is larger    
 than Upper Swell with a shop, a       
 school, a pub and a small hotel. There
 is a blacksmith whose work is well    
 known over a very wide area. Some new 
 houses are being built in Lowere      
 Swell, but they will probably be too  
 expensive for ordinary young couples.
