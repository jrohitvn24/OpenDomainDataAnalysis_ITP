		<title>17Hellifield Railway Station</title>
		<content>    The dark entrance to the curving   
 subway is roofed with iron girders.   
 Thin black cracks, oozing mud, line   
 the once white tiles.                 
    The station platform, silent and   
 deserted, is covered with a slanting  
 glass roof. Every red rusty pillar    
 says M.R. for Midland Railway. Lacey  
 patterns of wrought iron are a        
 playground for flying wyverns.        
    All the doors and windows of the   
 station are boarded up. The old       
 loading bays are piled up with rubbish
 and partly hidden by weeds and trees. 
 A haze of purple lupins is all that   
 marks where the old loco sheds were.  
    A train comes. The engine noise    
 rises to a shriek. The platform shakes
 and wobbles like a jelly. Several     
 carriages flash past, clickety-clack, 
 clickety-clack. Then it is gone. The  
 station returns to its quiet dreams.  </content>
