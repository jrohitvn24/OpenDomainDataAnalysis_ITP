		<title>11THE RAILWAY</title>
		<content>The Railway first came to Didcot in    
1844.  90 Full-time staff work at the  
station itself.  It has recently been  
modernised.  The platforms have been   
raised.  A completely new and          
attractive front and forecourt were    
completed in 1985.  Some drivers have  
worked at Didcot for 46 years.  Mr     
Alder has worked there for 30 years and
he is retiring in 1986.  He tells that 
the sheds were built with scraps from  
London roundabout 1933.  Fewer trains  
come through Didcot now, although it is
a major junction for Westbound trains  
from Paddington, London and for        
Northbound trains from the South coast.
One of the first engines to come       
through Didcot was one of Stevenson's. 
In the 1950's it cost 4s6d to go to    
London by train from Didcot.  In 1985  
it costs 6 pounds.
