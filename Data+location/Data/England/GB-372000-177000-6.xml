		<content> FOOTPATHS AND BRIDLEWAYS              
                                       
                                       
 Many public paths were not well       
 maintained, so even in June were muddy
 as well as narrow. Some were so       
 overgrown that they could rarely be   
 used. Gate ways were often surrounded 
 by nettles. The bridleways seemed     
 little different from the footpaths   
 and would be difficult to ride along. 
 The farms have long dirt track lanes  
 leading to them ,separated from the   
 fields by wire fences, or occasionally
 by only a small strip of grass.
