		<title>10Arts and Crafts - Hedging</title>

 Hedging is becoming rather rare with  
 the development of modern hedge       
 trimmers, but when a hedge has not    
 been trimmed for some years it has to 
 be "laid". This is done by cutting and
 thinning it down, choosing tall       
 straight young hawthorn to lay        
 sideways at an angle of 45 degrees.   
 Each stem is chopped half through at  
 the base so that it will bend, and    
 when several are laid, stakes are     
 inserted to secure them in place. The 
 following years young shoots will     
 appear growing upwards and eventually,
 these can by trimmed by machine.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
