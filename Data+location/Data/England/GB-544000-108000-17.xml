		<title>17GLYNDE RECREATION GROUND</title>
		<content> Beside the Cricket Club is Glynde     
 Recreation Ground. It has five swings,
 a roundabout, a may pole, a slide, a  
 seesaw and some poles to climb on. It 
 is by the swimming pool. All of this  
 equipment is about ten years old. The 
 slide is about eight metres high. The 
 swings are very squeaky. The climbing 
 bars are hard to get up on but we     
 managed. The sand pit hasn't much sand
 in it but has enough for long jumps.  
 Some children jumped to the other side
 but no one jumped right over it. The  
 park is never full of children        
 because so few children live in       
 Glynde.
