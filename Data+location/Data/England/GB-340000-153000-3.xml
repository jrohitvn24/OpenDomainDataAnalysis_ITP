		<title>03A FAMILY HOLIDAY.</title>
		<content>{Our family holiday}is an economical   
 one, we tow our own touring caravan   
 behind the family car.                
{The caravan}sleeps 4 people and is    
 very comfortable being double glazed  
 and well insulated.It weighs 10.3 cwt.
 and is 14ft. long.We have a toilet    
 compartment and so can use any site   
 with a water supply. Bottled gas is   
 used for cooking but we also take a   
 barbecue for outdoor use when the     
 weather permits. A 12 volt battery is 
 used for lighting and also powers the 
 portable T.V.                         
 We take{games}such as Swingball,      
 Scrabble, card games and Ludo.        
 Buckets spades and fishing nets are   
 a must for seaside activities.        
 We prefer to take our holidays        
 at quiet seaside resorts or in the New
 Forest. The cost per night for a      
 family of four is approx. Â£5.00.      </content>
