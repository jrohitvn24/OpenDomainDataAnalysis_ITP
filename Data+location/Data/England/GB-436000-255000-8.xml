		<content> The{National Hunt}racing stables in   
 Bishops Itchington are housed in what 
 used to be two cottages built in 1889 
 and which belonged to the big house   
 further up the lane.  One of these    
 cottages used to be a dairy.  The     
 buildings are of red brick and inside 
 the walls are planked with wood.      
 There are eight horses which are      
 looked after by Mr. Wilmer Mann and   
 his son Robert.  When the stables are 
 busy Mrs. Betty Mann and Robert's     
 wife, Sue help out.  They work from   
 6.3O a.m. - 5.3O p.m. every day. The{

 Northend.  He has been coming for     
 seventy years and is now helped by his
 son.
