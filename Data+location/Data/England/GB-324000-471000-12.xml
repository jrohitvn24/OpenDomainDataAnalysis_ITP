		<content> My name is Richard Wilson, I am nine  
 years old. I live at Bay View, New-   
 biggin. I wake up at 8.o'clock each   
 morning and have my breakfast in bed  
 I have Weetabix, fruit juice and hot- 
 chocolate. Next I go to the bathroom, 
 clean my teeth and wash my hands and  
 face. After that I go to the bottom   
 of the garden and collect the two pint
 bottles of milk for my mum, which the 
 milkman has left. I take them into the
 house, put them into the fridge,      
 collect my school bag and walk to the 
 main road in front of my house to     
 catch the mini-bus to school. It      
 leaves at 8.45am. I come home at 4.00 
 p.m. then play out on my bike before  
 my tea. My favourite meals are, cheese
 sauce and cauliflower,nut and cheese  
 burgers, soft boiled eggs or cheese   
 and egg buns. I have my mid-day meal  
 at school. It is a hot cooked meal.   </content>
