		<title>17PUBLIC HOUSES</title>
		<content> There are six public houses in our    
 survey area: The Plough &amp; Harrow,     
 New Leathern Bottle and Three Legged  
 Cross in Warfield, and The Jack       
 O'Newbury, Stag &amp; Hounds and Victoria 
 Arms in Binfield. The population of   
 Warfield and Binfield is just 4,700   
 and, as there are other pubs in the   
 area, those listed rely on lunch time 
 trade from Bracknell and local custom 
 These country pubs offer between them 
 everything from modern entertainment  
 to a traditional 'old world'          
 atmosphere e.g. The Stag &amp; Hounds     
 became a public house in 1727         
 and is mentioned in William Cobbett's 
 "Rural Rides".                        
 The revenue from the sale of food has 
 become an important source of income  
 for publicans and between them the    
 pubs offer everything from bar snacks 
 to full meals.                        </content>
