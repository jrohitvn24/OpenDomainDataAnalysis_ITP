		<content> When I go out to play with my friends 
 we play games .One of them is called  
 stony .To play stony you get ten      
 people and a stone. The ten people cup
 their hands then you choose somebody  
 to run then you go along the line and 
 you give the stone to somebody. They  
 run to a wall and run back and the one
 who wins gets the stone. We also play 
 other games. One is called Tippy Shy. 
 In this you use a cricket bat and ball
 and wickets and the idea is to hit the
 ball away and if the fielder catches  
 it he bats but if he drops it he has  
 to throw it at the wickets. If he hits
 them he bats. There are other games we
 play like tig in which you choose     
 somebody to be the tigger and who ever
 he tigs is it.
