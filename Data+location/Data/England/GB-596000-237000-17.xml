		<title>17 Support for the Church.</title>
		<content>  In addition to the usual duties of   
sidesmen,many parishioners share the   
duties of grass cutting in the         
churchyard, cleaning the church, and   
providing altar flowers.Bell ringers,  
young and old,take pride in ringing the
bells on Sundays,practise during the   
week,and ring special peals for        
important occasions.                   
  A great concern of the moment is the 
Church Fabric fund,and many events,    
plays (one about Maria Marten)         
concerts,collections of scrap metals   
and old magazines have been organised  
to raise the considerable sums         
required to preserve the church for    
future generations.Six thousand,four   
hundred pounds has recently been       
paid for repairs to the roof.The       
Rectory has been sold(with its ghost   
tales)replaced by a small modern house 
in nearby Boxford.                     </content>
