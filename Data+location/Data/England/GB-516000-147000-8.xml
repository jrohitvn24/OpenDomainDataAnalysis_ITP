		<title>08DORKING HIGH STREET - SHOPS</title>
		<content>  On the 12th July my friend and I     
 surveyed Dorking Town High Street to  
 find out how useful Dorking is to the 
 average shopper.Our conclusions are as
 follows:-                             
  Dorking's High Street is very good   
 for people who want Building          
 Societies,Banks,Estate Agents and     
 Men's clothes shops,as the majority of
 the shops consisted of these.         
  Dorking has quite a good selection of
 food stores,like J.Sainsbury,Waitrose 
 and Tesco's.There are also plenty of  
 shoe shops and well known shops such  
 as W.H.Smith and Woolworth.Department 
 stores Littlewoods and Marks and      
 Spencers are not present.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
