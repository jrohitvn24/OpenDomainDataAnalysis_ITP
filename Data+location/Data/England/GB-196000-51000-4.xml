		<title>04China Clay Production</title>
		<content>  The Blackpool China Clay Works is a  
 key area in the production of China   
 Clay from central Cornwall. It is the 
 third largest pit out of the 21 pits  
 within the group and produces over    
 7,500 tonnes of speciality clay each  
 week. Most of this clay is used by the
 Paper Industry, both as a Filler and  
 as a Coating Clay.                    
  There are 49 people employed at the  
 Blackpool China Clay Pit and 46 at the
 associated Refining Plant. The nearby 
 Blackpool Slurry Plant employs 46 to  
 produce around 1,652 tonnes of high   
 quality Coating Pigment each week. At 
 the Burngullow Tube Press, Dry Clay   
 Filler is produced at the rate of 2800
 tonnes per week with a workforce of 17
 people. The debris ratio is around 7  
 tonnes of waste material for each     
 tonne of useful product. The waste is 
 dumped at Blackpool Tip.  (Mike Yates)</content>
