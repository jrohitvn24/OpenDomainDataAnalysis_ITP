entertainment in Hanley town centre eg 
a theatre, two cinemas and discos.One  
disco has an 11+ club and inside it is 
like three living-rooms put together

disc-jockey there plays the 'Top 40'.  
Northwood stadium is on the outskirts  
of Hanley, near to Bucknall.The        
interior of the stadium consists of    
three squash courts, four badminton    
courts and visitors can play

international sports track constructed
