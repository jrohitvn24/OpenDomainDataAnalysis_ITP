 Mr.A.Foster, Riddlesden C.E. School,  
 Headmistress Mrs. Dawson, Strong Close
 Nursery, Headmistress Mrs. Thwaites   
 and a play school which does not have 
 a head teacher.                       
                                       
   Grange, because it is a Middle      
 School has a uniform and does exams.  
 The others, having younger children,  
 do not have uniforms or exams.        
                                       
   Grange has 12 classes, 3 in each    
 year and we do French, art, woodwork, 
 home economics, rural studies, world  
 studies, computers as well as English,
 maths, sports and swimming.  We have a
 goat, ducks, hens, geese, rabbits and 
 two greenhouses.
