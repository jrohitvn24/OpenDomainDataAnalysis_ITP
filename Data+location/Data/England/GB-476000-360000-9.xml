		<title>09Watermill Farm at Norwell</title>
		<content>{ }The farm stands on the outskirts of 
 Norwell village, in 15 acres, with the
 Beck flowing close by. It is the site 
 of the old{watermill}of which there is
 now little evidence.                  
  {Mrs. Foulds}runs a business from    
 here buying, renovating and selling   
{tractors.}She employs 2 men and there 
 are about 60 tractors in stock, in    
 various stages of repair. She mainly  
 deals with Ford tractors but does     
 stock some others.                    
   She buys tractors by private        
 sale,from dealers, farm sales or      
 auctions. Most of the tractors are    
 exported, mainly to{Third World       
{Countries. }                          
   In order to meet with strict hygiene
 laws abroad, the tractors must first  
 be steam cleaned, then sand blasted.  
 They are then painted with a rust     
 preventative before spraying.         </content>
