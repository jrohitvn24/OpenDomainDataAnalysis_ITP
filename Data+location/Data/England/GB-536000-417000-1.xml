		<content>{ LOCAL AREA}We are near the southern  
 tip of what was the East Riding of    
 Yorkshire.It is a low, flat area,     
 which separates the cold North Sea    
 from the mighty River Humber.         
{ GEOLOGY }The underlying rock is      
 mainly thick clay which was deposited 
 by an ancient Scandinavian Glacier.   
 Evidence for this can be found on a   
 local beach where Norwegian rocks can 
 be found washed out from the cliffs.  
{ FARMING }This clay is very fertile   
 and is used for arable farming.The    
 main crops are wheat,barley,oats,and  
 rape.Farming is our main industry.    
{ EMPLOYMENT}The other main occupations
 are North Sea Gas extraction and      
 tourism.                              
{ ISOLATION}We are an isolated area    
 and have our own dialect and customs.
