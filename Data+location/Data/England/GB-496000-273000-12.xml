The A 605 goes through Ringstead and   
is a busy traffic route.One way is     
to Raunds and then to Stanwick,        
Rushden, Wellingborough and            
eventually Northampton.The other way   
is to Thrapston from where traffic can 
go to Huntingdon,Kettering,Oundle and  
Peterborough or Corby.A new road is    
being built called the A 45 which will 
by-pass Ringstead and take all the     
heavy traffic.Ringstead will be a lot  
quieter as a result.We are also very   
near the proposed A1-M1 link road.This 
is still being planned,but will by-pass
Thrapston and the A 45 will link to it.
When these are built Ringstead will be 
a nicer place to live in and the people
living here will be able to travel more
quickly to other towns for work and    
shopping,and to motorways so perhaps   
more people will want to live here.    </content>
