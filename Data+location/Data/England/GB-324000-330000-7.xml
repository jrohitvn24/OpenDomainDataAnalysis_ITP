		<content> The majority of people in this area   
 either worked in{farming,}or{commuted 
 to their jobs in Oswestry. In recent  
 decades increased mechanisation on    
 farms has brought about a reduction in
 the number of labourers employed. At  
 peak periods such as sheep-shearing   
 and harvest part-time labour is sought
 on farms. Many people worked outside  
 the area. Some were employed in shops 
 and offices in the nearby town of     
 Oswestry. Of several teachers living  
 in the area one taught chemistry in   
 Weston Rhyn at a girls' boarding      
 school. Another had left the profess- 
 ion to become a freelance journalist. 
 A couple living in an isolated cottage
 had give up their teaching jobs in the
 south of England and had set up a     
 cabinet_making business at home,      
 selling their products in Oswestry.
