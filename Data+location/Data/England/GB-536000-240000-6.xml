		<content> cattle are kept, and in the summer    
 months about 20.The cattle supply a   
 local butcher and are also shown at   
 various{agricultural shows}across the 
 country.There is a range of{wildlife }
 on the farms.We saw hares, pheasants, 
 partridges,skylarks and swallows.There
 were also grouse nesting.Mr Hoy also  
 keeps two horses.The grain is stored  
 in 14{grain silos.}Twelve of them hold
 120 tons.The grain is cleaned and     
 dried with hot air and then           
 transported to local merchants.Many   
 different{machines}are used on the    
 farms.Mr Hoy has 8 tractors,2 combine 
 harvesters and several ploughs,harrows
 and seed drills.These have helped to  
 reduce the{labour force}to three farm 
 workers as opposed to 18 in the past.
