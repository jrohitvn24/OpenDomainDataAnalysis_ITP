		<title>06The Village of Trewoon</title>
		<content> I live in Trewoon which is a village  
 about a mile from St Austell on the   
 A3058 road which goes to Newquay.This 
 means that it is a busy road          
 especially in the summer when people  
 are  down here on holiday.In Trewoon  
 we have most things that we need,a    
 garage,dairy,electrical shop,a post   
 office,a grocery store,a hair dressers
 and  a fish and chip shop.There is a  
 chapel ,a social club, a  park with a 
 village hall.We are close to the      
 railway line which goes across the    
 main road on a bridge.The children can
 catch a bus to St.Mewan school and    
 Penrice school.We have a greengrocer's
 van which comes on Wednesdays and     
 Saturdays and also a fish van and a   
 bakers van.                           
 Trewoon is a nice friendly place to   
 live and not far from St. Austell and 
 also near to the sea.  (Jeremy Blythe)</content>
