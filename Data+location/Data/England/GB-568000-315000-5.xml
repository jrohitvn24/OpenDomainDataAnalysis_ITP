 In the church there are also two very 
 old pews which were first made in the 
 fifteenth century. they are so fragile
 that if anyone sat on them they would 
 break.                                
 Rev Bell and his wife live in the     
 Vicarage in Middleton. The Vicarage   
 has only been built a few years and is
 next to the church. The old Vicarage  
 is a lovely old building but it was   
 too big and very expensive to look    
 after so the church had sold it and   
 decided to build a new onewhich is    
 much easier and cheaper to maintain.
