		<title>12Shopping around Hungerford.</title>
		<content>   Our survey of Hungerford people     
 shows a strong desire for more clothes
 shops ,especially selling children's  
 clothes and a shoe shop.There was     
 also a sizeable number  who  would    
 like to see one of the chain stores   
 e.g. Woolworth.                       
     Not surprisingly for goods not    
 easily obtainable in Hungerford or for
 greater choice people travelled most  
 often to Newbury or Swindon ,the      
 nearest towns, although some travel as
 far as London .Only 2% used a shopping
 catalogue.                            
    The International at Hungerford is 
 the most popular shop for weekly      
 shopping .Only one person travels as  
 far as Andover every week             
   In deciding where to shop people    
 rated choice ,lower prices ,quality   
 convenience and service as equally    
 important.                            </content>
