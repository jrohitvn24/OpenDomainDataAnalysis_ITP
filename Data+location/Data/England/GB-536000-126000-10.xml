		<title>10The Bus Service</title>
		<content>     There is one bus service through  
 the village, Southdown route 170, and 
 it goes to East Grinstead (46 mins.)  
 and Haywards Heath (17 mins.) It runs 
 every two hours, starting at around   
 7.30 a.m. The buses do not run on     
 Sundays. The adult fare is about Â£1.20
 to Haywards Heath.                    
    Many people rely on the bus service
 for work, shopping and to get to the  
 nearest secondary school. Some people 
 in the village do not use the buses   
 because they think they are not very  
 convenient; the people who do use them
 often say we need a better service.   
 Some say the buses do not run often   
 enough, that it takes too long for    
 them to get to their destination, or  
 that the last bus leaves too early in 
 the evening. Most local people have   
 their own cars because they do not    
 want to use only the bus service.     </content>
