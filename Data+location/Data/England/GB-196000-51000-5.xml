		<title>05Disused Pits and Tips</title>
		<content> Much of the area to the north of the  
 villages of Trewoon and Lanjeth has   
 been involved with the China Clay     
 Industry. A large proportion of the   
 area is now no longer used. There are 
 many old pits, tips and buildings     
 which are now disused or derelict.    
 The waste product of Clay production  
 is mainly sand, which is dumped on    
 tips, or a fine sludge which is left  
 to settle in large lakes. Both of     
 these materials are almost pure white 
 which is why the 'White Pyramids' area
 is used so often for Science Fiction  
 films. In recent years much research  
 has been done into how to reclaim or  
 restore the landscape to its natural  
 beauty. Many old tips in the area are 
 now covered with green plants which   
 can grow in such conditions. Even the 
 lakes can be refilled and re-used for 
 agricultural purposes.    (Mike Yates)</content>
