		<content>   Nearly 3000 semi-detached houses &amp;  
 bungalows, have been built since 1950.
 Some detached properties have existed 
 since 1930 &amp; occasional small sites   
 are still being developed. Most of the
 properties are privately owned,       
 including those on a small council    
 estate. Three parades of small shops, 
 totalling 22, independantly owned,    
 provide most of the immediate needs of
 the community. Dartford, Swanley and  
 Bexleyheath provide more extensive    
 facilities. There is a very modern    
 church. Most residents commute to     
 London by train and/or car            
   A residents association, community  
 centre, Nursery School, playgroup,    
 Senior Citizens group, women's clubs, 
 scout, guide, cub &amp; brownie packs &amp; a 
 football club thrive. Adult education 
 &amp; recreation facilities are provided
