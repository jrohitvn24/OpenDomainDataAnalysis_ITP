		<title>13DARTMOUTH: NOSS WORKS</title>
		<content>   Interest has been shown in a{Port   
{Development}within the ancient harbour
 of Dartmouth for some years. The      
 proposed port at{Noss Creek}would     
 provide a modern fish quay for the    
 local{fishing industry}as well as     
 facilities for handling containers,   
 dry bulk, near bulk and general cargo.
   The depth of water at berth is 10m. 
 suitable for vessels of up to 7,000   
 tonnes. Its main impact to Dartmouth  
 would be that of providing{employment 
 for 83 people directly and 205 people 
 in associated businesses.             
   It is estimated that it would cost  
 about{Â£6,000,000}but would have       
 an expected turnover of Â£1,750,000    
 within 2 years and Â£3,500,000 in 5    
 years. Dartmouth is on a primary{trade
{route}for sea traffic moving along the
 English Channel with connections to   
 the main trunk roads to{London.       </content>
