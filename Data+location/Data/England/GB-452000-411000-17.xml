		<title>17Street Games:"KINGY"</title>
		<content> A favourite street game is{KINGY.}You 
 can have as many players as you want, 
 and you pick one person to be 'on'.   
 All the players stand in a circle with
 their legs apart. The King then       
 bounces a ball. The person whose legs 
 the ball passes through is ' on'. That
 person then counts whilst the others  
 flee. When he has finished the agreed 
 count, he tries to hit the others with
 the ball aiming for the body below the
 waist to the feet. He can only move by
 bouncing the ball. If he hits someone,
 they are then 'on' with him. They may 
 then pass the ball between them before
 aiming at someone. When every one has 
 been caught you then have to start a  
 fresh game. The first one caught in   
 the previous game is 'on'. The players
 can only run within an agreed area or 
 else they are 'out'.
