		<content>  The D-block from which we obtained   
 our information is located in the     
 southern part of the Lake District and
 is therefore largely rural. The       
 inhabitants are centred chiefly on the
 three villages of Backbarrow. Bouth   
 and Haverthwaite, each of which is of 
 long-standing. Backbarrow contains the
 site of an ironworks which was founded
 at the beginning of the 18th century. 
 John Wilkinson, the iron master, often
 described as the "Founder of the      
 Industrial Revolution" spent the early
 part of his career living in the      
 village at Bare Syke.                 
  Another notable feature of the area  
 is the presence of the Bigland family 
 in their family seat at Bigland Hall. 
 It is believed that the family is one 
 of the few in the North of England to 
 have been in residence since the      
 Norman Conquest.                      </content>
