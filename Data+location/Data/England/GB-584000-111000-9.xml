		<content> There are two schools in the          
 Fairlight, Guestling, Pett area of    
 East Sussex. They are                 
 Guestling-Bradshaw County Primary and 
 Hillcrest Comprehensive Schools.      
                                       
 The school year is divided into three 
 terms of about eleven weeks in        
 length.  The year starts at the       
 beginning of September and ends about 
 the middle of December.  The second   
 term lasts from January to Easter, and
 the third term goes from Easter to the
 third week of July.                   
                                       
 The school day at Guestling-Bradshaw  
 goes from 8.55am to 3.30pm. The school
 takes children from the age of 4\ to  
 ll\ years, both boys and girls. Most  
 of the children stay at school for a  
 school lunch or to eat their          
 sandwiches as they live so far away.  </content>
