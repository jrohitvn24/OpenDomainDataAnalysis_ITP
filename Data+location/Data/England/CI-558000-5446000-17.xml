		<title>17EATING OUT</title>
		<content>  Here in Jersey we are spoilt for the 
 number and quality of good eating     
 places. Most of the pubs offer meals  
 at set times of the day and in our D  
 block alone we can choose between     
 Greek, Chinese, Italian, French or    
 English restaurants. Sea food always  
 features strongly on the menus, much  
 of it caught by local fishermen. A    
 typical meal in the evening might be:-
 Moules Mariniere (mussels in garlic,  
 white wine, and cream): consomme :    
 Steak (perhaps flambee'd at your      
 table) with a selection of fresh      
 vegetables, Jersey new potatoes are   
 famous for their taste. Black Forest  
 Gateau with cream is one of the most  
 popular desserts. With wine and coffee
 a good quality meal for two costs     
 about Â£25. Amongst local residents,   
 eating out is one of the most enjoyed 
 evening entertainments.               </content>
