		<content>The North of England has lots of houses
that have backyards.They were mostly   
built about one hundred years ago,at   
the turn of the century.They are       
terraced with alleys running in between
the rows of houses. The Ridge on the   
South side of the river has dirtyish   
yards. Skerton on the other side of the
river has cleanish yards. The  total   
number of streets with backyards is 24 
the total number of backyards in the   
streets is 684. 75% of all the houses  
looked at have backyards. The area of  
an average yard is 9sq.m. The surface  
area of all the yards put together is  
4070sq.m. On average people have lived 
in their houses for 19 years. People   
find their backyards useful for various
reasons such as hanging out washing    
putting dogs and kids in, sheds, and   
toilets which are useful for old people
who can't get upstairs very easily.    </content>
