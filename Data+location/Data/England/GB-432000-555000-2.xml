		<content> Mr. Storey lives in a small isolated  
 cottage by the dismantled Sunderland  
 to Durham railway line. The house     
 was originally a gate keeper's cottage
 first inhabited in 1852 by Mr.        
 Storey's great grandparents. Mr.      
 Storey has lived there for 74 years.  
 The cottage is a stone built 2 storey 
 building having one bedroom upstairs  
 and a living room and kitchen down-   
 stairs. It is about a mile from the   
 nearest transport or shops and        
 "Wilfie", has to walk everywhere. The 
 house has a cold water tap but no     
 other amenities. Mr. Storey uses calor
 gas for lighting, heating and cooking.
 He also has a coal fire on which he   
 can heat water. He uses a zinc tub as 
 a bath. Mr. Storey likes living there.
 He has plenty of friends who call in  
 but he sometimes gets lonely at night.
