		<content> The present school was built in 1972. 
 The old school has been converted into
 a house.Ours is a small school with   
 four classes and 96 children.Our      
 headmaster is Mr Newton. Our school   
 has a large playing field with two    
 rounders pitches and two football     
 pitches.The field also has a sandpit  
 for long jump. We have a BBC Micro B  
 computer,a record player which can be 
 connected to a tape recorder and two  
 televisions. We have got a mascot     
 called Pandora and a hamster called   
 Tetley.We have a small hut called a   
 pratten which we use for music and    
 Rising Fives which is a group for     
 children under five.Behind the school 
 field there is a small piece of land  
 called the rough ground.In the summer 
 we sometimes go there to look for     
 insects,birds and wild plants.
