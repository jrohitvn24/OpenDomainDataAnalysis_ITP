		<title>15FARMING</title>
		<content> Farming is the only industry in our   
 grid.The whole of our area is farm    
 land.The village takes up less than a 
 square.There are about twelve large   
 farms,we visited all of these.        
 The land slopes steeply down from the 
 Downs leveling out into the flat lands
 which take up eight of our squares.The
 soil on the slopes is Chalk and thin  
 soil,the flat lands are a mixture of  
 Rich Loam,Clay,Oxford Clay,Chalk and a
 special old Black soil.               
 Farming is mixed on all the farms we  
 visited the were some corn            
 crops,cows,either dairy or            
 beef,sometimes both,a few sheep and   
 one kept pigs.There is one specialist 
 chicken farm,although other farmers   
 kept chicken for eggs mostly for      
 themselves.There were two very small  
 farms one buys and sells calves,the   
 other fattens calves in two large barn</content>
