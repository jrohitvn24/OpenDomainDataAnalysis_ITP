		<content> Rural charm much of our block may     
 have, but for all that stone houses   
 are rare - a mere 3.3%. If you should 
 fancy that country cottage, then      
 Sunniside (2l60) with 26% stone houses
 is the best bet.                      
  The recent vintage of most of our    
 houses is also evident by the small   
 number of slate rooves (l5.2%) - tile 
 being more common. Only in Sunniside  
 (2l60-50%, 2058-35%) is slate still   
 prevalent.                            
  In houses built this century shifts  
 in fashion are apparent. On Whickham's
 new estates (2060) garages (8l%) are  
 nearly as common as gardens (93%). On 
 Lobley Hill's estates (2360) started  
 before the war gardens (9l%)          
 seemed a must for former terrace      
 dwellers but garages (20%) were not   
 yet a necessity. In the block 87% of  
 houses have gardens, 43% have garages.</content>
