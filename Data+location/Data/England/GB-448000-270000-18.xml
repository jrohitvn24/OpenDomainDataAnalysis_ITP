		<title>18Onley Sewage Works,Rugby</title>
		<content> This Sewage works was built to serve  
 Onley Prison and its estate.A local   
 farm is also linked to it. The prison 
 was built in an isolated area and too 
 far from the nearest town to use the  
 main sewers. Sewage is lifted by pump 
 to the first collecting tank. Gravity 
 does all the work of moving sewage    
 from one tank to another.Small flies  
 breed in the filter beds and encourage
 certain bacteria which purify the     
 water. No chemicals are added to the  
 sewage. After leaving the filter beds 
 the water is 75% pure. Before being   
 discharged into a stream,the water is 
 passed via a tank into a well.        
 Three people maintain the plant-a     
 Works and two prisoners. To prevent   
 flooding the pump-room grill is       
 cleaned every day.                    
 The plant serves about 1000 people.
