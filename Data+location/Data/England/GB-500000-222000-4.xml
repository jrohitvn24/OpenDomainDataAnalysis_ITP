 Chalk and clay can be found and       
 quarried in Houghton Regis,Luton &amp;    
 Dunstable but Houghton Regis is made  
 of mostly chalk.In and around Luton &amp; 
 Dunstable is the main industrial      
 area.The growth of towns has left its 
 mark on the countryside.As more food  
 has been produced from less land its  
 physical appearance has               
 changed.Houghton Regis became a town  
 in the early 1980's after population  
 and industrial growth.Houghton Regis  
 has shops from Bedford Square round to
 Air Call.The Cement Works had two     
 chimneys and the larger of the        
 chimneys was built without planning   
 permission and have been in use since 
 1964.From a quarry by the A5 chalk was
 transported by a train to the Cement  
 Works.
