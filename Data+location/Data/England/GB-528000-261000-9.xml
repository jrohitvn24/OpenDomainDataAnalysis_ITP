		<title>09Emma Sims: A Day in Elsworth</title>
		<content> I'm eleven years old and an only      
 child. My mother teaches at Elsworth  
 School and my father works for the    
 British Oxygen Company at Harlow. He  
 leaves about 07.00 and returns at     
 about 19.00.                          
 I'm woken up at 07.15. I usually have 
 breakfast in the kitchen and have     
 cereal. I arrive at school at about   
 08.30 and school starts at 08.55. We  
 begin with assembly as we're a Church 
 School.                               
 I play out sometimes on my bike or    
 roller-skates or practise the piano or
 oboe or guitar or recorder.I usually  
 make a cup of tea for my mum when she 
 comes in from work. We all have our   
 meal together usually. Sometimes we   
 cook it in the microwave.             
 I go to bed at 21.00. My bed is easy  
 to make because I have a duvet.
