		<title>09FAMILY LIFE IN THE EIGHTIES</title>
		<content>   My family is a family of five, my   
 sister, my brother, my dad, my mum and
 me. I share a bedroom with my sister. 
 We have got bunk beds by the window   
 and the wardrobe opposite. I sleep on 
 the top bunk. My Mum has a phone that 
 we can all use if we pay for the call.
   We also have three rooms downstairs.
 One is a dining room with a table and 
 chairs and a piano which my sister    
 plays. Then there is my living room   
 which has a settee and two armchairs. 
 We have a television in there. There  
 is a computer which everybody uses    
 apart from my mum. My dad has got all 
 his tape recorders and record players 
 in there too. We have got a lot of    
 things in that room. Then we have the 
 kitchen.                              
   The things we do together are       
 playing games in the living room like 
 'Scrabble'.                           </content>
