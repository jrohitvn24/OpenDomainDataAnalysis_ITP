		<content> Once farmland, the Woodgate Valley    
Country Park has been put aside for    
conservation use. The park is          
maintained by a team of rangers &amp;      
volunteers. The area covers scrubland  
with a stream running through it,a pond
&amp; a marshy area. This provides a       
habitat for insects &amp; amphibian        
creatures, birds, hares &amp; foxes.       
Recently signs of badgers were found.  
Wild flowers abound.                   
 The park is used by local inhabitants 
for recreational purposes &amp; by school  
children for projects.There are        
opportunities for riding &amp; facilities  
for disabled people. The classroom,    
stables,goats &amp; donkey carts are based 
at Hole Farm. Much still needs to be   
done to educate people to the proper   
use of the area but the rangers are    
working to overcome this by contact    
with schools &amp; working with children.  </content>
