		<title>03Castle Cornet, Guernsey</title>
		<content>    Dominating the approaches to       
 Guernsey's main town and harbour,     
 Castle Cornet has stood guard for     
 nearly eight centuries.               
    The Castle is open daily from April
 to October and receives some 60,000   
 visitors annually.                    
    A daily guided tour is available   
 and as well as the structural layout  
 of the Castle visitors can see a      
 selection of museums such as the      
 Armoury or the museum of the R.A.F.   
 201 squadron. There are also a castle 
 shop and refectory.                   
    The firing of the noonday gun is   
 performed each weekday by a Castle    
 keeper in colourful uniform. Perhaps  
 appearing a little severe by day the  
 Castle makes a beautiful sight when   
 floodlit on a summer night.           
    Future plans include creating a    
 display area for the Roman wreck.     </content>
