        Northbrook andecclesdon frams  
 still survive although other single   
 settlements have vanished.  Woods have
 shrunk even further.  However the main
 difference is that of the amalgamation
 of all the settlements into one       
 massive housing area, except for the  
 two squares in the north west.        
                                       
 WHY THE CHANGES TOOK PLACE            
 l) {Growth of population}due to       
 improved  medical knowledge           
 2) {Population 'booms' in Worthing    
 after both World Wars.  Many council  
 houses were built for the families of 
 the soldiers who couldnot afford their
 own houses. The Maybridge Estate was  
 built after the 2nd World War for this
 reason.  Also {evacuees}returned to   
 settle on the south coast.            </content>
