		<title>13Pebworth Health</title>
		<content> Residents must travel 5 - l0 miles to 
 a doctor's surgery, transport being   
 arranged for the elderly or disabled. 
 Most Pebworth families attend Bidford 
 Health Centre, which has four doctors 
 and provides  Community Health        
 services ( antenatal care, speech     
 therapy and chiropody). Pebworth Post 
 Office acts as a distribution point   
 for some prescriptions.  Long Marston 
 families go to Quinton or Mickleton   
 where one doctor serves two surgeries.
 Family doctors immunise children and  
 visit patients as necessary. A health 
 visitor and district nurse also attend
 patients.  Hospitals serving this area
 are Stratford, Warwick, Evesham and   
 Worcester. Small local maternity units
 e.g. Stratford's Monroe-Devis,are     
 closing in favour of larger ones at   
 Leamington &amp; Worcester, both over 20  
 miles away.                           </content>
