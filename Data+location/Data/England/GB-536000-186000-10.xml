		<title>10THE BAKER'S ALMS HOUSES.</title>
		<content> The present{Almshouses }on this site, 
 adjoining Lea Bridge Road in Leyton,  
 were built in 1857 for the Pensioners 
 of the Company of London Master       
 Bakers.                               
 The design by T.Knightley was for 50  
 villas,each having 2 storeys and a    
 small private garden at its rear were 
 to house a man,a woman or a couple who
 were to be partly cared for by a      
 resident warden.The buildings ,on 3   
 sides of a square,face inwards on a   
 circular communal garden and access   
 road. In 1973 the G.L.C. bought the   
 site for a road widening scheme,which 
 was later abandoned.The houses were   
 then refurbished and converted into   
 one bedroomed flats. As a result of   
 this the Almshouses once again serve  
 as homes for pensioners.              
 A beautiful landmark in Leyton.
