<title>26Homes and Housing</title>

<content>



The housing stock remains traditionally constructed. Within Scotton development includes; Scotton Court 1995 (21), Percy Court 1999 (9), Manor Farm Way 2002 (6) and on the periphery of the village the Appleby Estate (on the former Scotton Banks Hospital site) of over 100 dwellings was constructed in 1997. More recently (2010) 5 houses were constructed on the Ripley Road, on the former Scotton Garage site. Nearly all the former Council houses are now privately owned. In addition there has been a small number of in-fill development/ farm building conversions across the area.   &lt;br />
