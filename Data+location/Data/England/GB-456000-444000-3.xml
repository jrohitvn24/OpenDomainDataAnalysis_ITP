		<content> Acaster Malbis originated as a Roman  
 station on the Ouse,and the river has 
 played an important part in its life. 
 Fishing declined in the 1930s,and at  
 the end of the second world war,      
 tourism took over,with 9 caravan and  
 camping sites,and a large residential 
 caravan site.In the last ten years    
 there has been some housing develop-  
 ment and the commuters have moved in. 
 There are eight working farms in the  
 Parish and community spirit is still  
 strong,fostered mainly by those who   
 worship at the fourteenth century     
 church and the 100 year old Methodist 
 Chapel.Conserving our Rural heritage  
 must be our priority for the future.
