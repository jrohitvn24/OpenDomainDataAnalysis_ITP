		<title>05THE CRUSHER PLANT</title>
		<content>                                       
     The crusher plant was opened in   
 1949 and, up to 1980 it had crushed   
{112 million tonnes of limestone.}It is
 capable of crushing{1000 tonnes of    
{limestone in an hour.}There are also  
 two smaller crushers. The primary     
 crusher can crush stones as big as a  
 person down to pieces as small as a   
 hand.                                 
     The machine is bell-shaped, and it
 weighs {25 tonnes.}It is remotely     
 controlled from a control panel by    
 operators who can see what is         
 happening on two {closed circuit T.V. 
{monitors. }                           
     It is very dusty in the crusher   
 plant, so special clothing has to be  
 worn. It is also very noisy, so ear   
 muffs are essential.
