		<content> I dont think that the leisure         
 facilities are adequate because you   
 cant do an awful lot and you get board
 very easily.  You should have         
 something else worth going to.  You go
 to Barnsley baths and when you get    
 there it isn5 worth the bus journey.  
 If we had more to do it would keep    
 older children off the streets.  I am 
 sick of disco's because that is all   
 the council seem to be able to        
 organise.  Surley they could organise 
 something different so that we could  
 have something to do.  It would cost  
 alot to have a swimming pool or cinema
 built in Monk Bretton or Lundwood but 
 it would be well worth doing.  As I   
 have said before the facilities are   
 not very good.  There is quite alot to
 do but it is not through swimming     
 pools or things organised.
