		<content>{POPULATION                            
 ALTOGETHER IN PEATLING MAGNA THERE    
 ARE 133 PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF        
 18. WE FOUND THIS OUT BY LOOKING      
 BACK AT THE ELECTORAL ROLL WHICH TELLS
 US THE NAMES AND ADRESSES OF PEOPLE   
 WHO ARE ALLOWED TO VOTE.              
                                       
 IN 1863 THE POPULATION OF PEATLING    
 MAGNA WAS 272 PEOPLE, IN 1877 IT      
 DECREASED BY 44 PEOPLE TO 228.        
                                       
 WE THINK THE POPULATION HAS DROPPED   
 BECAUSE LESS PEOPLE WORK IN PEATLING  
 MAGNA AS THE FARMERS NO LONGER NEED   
 SO MANY WORKERS AS THEY HAVE MANY     
 MACHINES NOW. ALSO MANY PEOPLE HAVE   
 MOVED OUT TO FIND BETTER JOBS IN      
 BIGGER TOWNS.
