		<title>11VEHICLES ON ST.MARTINS</title>
		<content>   There is only one main road on      
 St.Martins,it runs from the quay      
 through the three hamlets down to a   
 beach at the western end of the       
 island.The road was built with        
 cement by the island men,it was       
 started in the 1960's.Nearly everybody
 has a vehicle such as a van or        
 tractor.Because of the simple road we 
 don't have to pay raod tax and the    
 vehicles don't have to pass the       
 M.O.T.The vehicles are mainly used    
 for getting oil,coal,fertilizer,      
 groceries,visitors luggage and post   
 from the quay,also for carrying       
 flowers for export.But on June 25th   
 1985,one of the vans was used to ferry
 H.R.H.Prince Charles from the quay to 
 Middletown,so he could see the        
 S.W.E.B.men laying the mains          
 electricity cables.
