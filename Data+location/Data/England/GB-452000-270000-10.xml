   The Under 10's train on a Saturday  
 from 10.30-11.30a.m. The under 10's   
 have got about 15 members. There are 2
 people in control: Mr.Rose and        
 Mr.Mills.                             
  {Under 11's}                         
   The under 11's train at the same    
 time as the under 10's. It is run by  
 Mr.McGuire and Mr.McMahon. The fees   
 are 20p for training and 30p for a    
 match. It costs Â£1.50 to sign on. We  
 play in the Daventry League. The      
 players all come from Kilsby or Barby 
 except one who comes from Braunston.  
 Most boys come from Kilsby. Nearly all
 the Barby team play for Kilsby School.
  {Next Year                           
   Next year we will play in the Rugby 
 League. The club's under 13 team has  
 had to stop because of lack of        
 support. We are quite a good team.    </content>
