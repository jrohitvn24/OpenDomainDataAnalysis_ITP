		<title>01BOWNESS-ON-SOLWAY. SUMMARY.</title>
		<content> A village of some 170 residents,      
 Bowness lies on the South side of the 
 narrowest part of the Solway estuary. 
 Built on the site of the Roman fort,  
 Maia, it marks the traditional Western
 extremity of Hadrian's Wall.  Its     
 narrow winding construction clearly   
 illustrates its defensive origins.    
 Approach roads are marked with warning
 signs of tidal flooding which at      
 times cuts off the village, albeit    
 briefly.  The traveller in the area   
 will be delighted by the variety of   
 wading birds, the abundance of wild   
 flowers, and the amazing sunsets, but 
 will be disappointed that there are   
 few signs of its Roman history.       
 Bowness has a church, chapel, school, 
 P.O., Tel., pub &amp; regular buses to    
 Carlisle.{(BOWNESS-ON-SOLWAY HEREAFTER
