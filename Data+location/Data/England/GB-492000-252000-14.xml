		<title>14Lacemaking in Turvey</title>
		<content> Turvey was a commercial lace centre,  
 producing and receiving lace made in  
 surrounding villages. Dealers met here
 to buy and sell. In 1981 interest in  
 lacemaking was revived with an        
 exhibition of old lace bobbins,       
 laces,threads and journalswhich had   
 been found in the loft of a cottage.  
 Classes meet weekly, some members are 
 experienced and follow traditional    
 Bedfordshire Lace designs,beginners   
 start with a Torchon design. Bobbins  
 and threads are bought at lace shops  
 in Bedford or Olney or at annual Lace 
 Days. Lace pillows were made of straw,
 but now polystyrene is often used     
 instead. Bobbins vary in price from 9p
 for a plastic one to possibly Â£180 for
 an antique rarity such as 'a hanging  
 bobbin' - commemorating a local       
 hanging                               
                                       </content>
