		<title>07FISH MARKETING</title>
		<content> In the past the catches were taken to 
{Falmouth}where the fishermen received 
 a penny or two for a crab; very little
 by today's standard. Later, fish was  
 taken to{Billingsgate Market}in London
 by rail. Today the fish is taken to   
{Newlyn}for auction, or sold to        
{wholesale fish merchants}who pay a    
 price approximating to market prices. 
 Dwindling catches mean that 2 men     
 today must work 150 pots and 40 to 50 
 nets to catch a similar amount as two 
 men years ago working only 60 pots and
 4 to 6 nets. The size of the catches  
 nowadays are much smaller, but this is
 offset by the higher prices obtained  
 for the fish.                         
 Coverack boats are registered in      
 Falmouth, their numbers being         
 preceeded by 'FH', the first and last 
 letters of the port of registration.
