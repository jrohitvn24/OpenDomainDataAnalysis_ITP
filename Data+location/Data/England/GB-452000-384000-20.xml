 three of which were only small. Today 
 in{Gildingwells}we found only one{farm
 there.All the others have been merged 
 into{houses}and the disused{farms}have
 been converted into homes for         
 businessmen.                          
 In 1927 all{farms}had to milk cows as 
 well as arable fields.Today there are 
 not any milk cows in the village.     
 The whole of Gildingwells was built in
 the early 17th century in limestone.
