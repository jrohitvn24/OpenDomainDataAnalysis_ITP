		<content>   The village of Swimbridge, with a   
 population of approximately 850 is    
 situated on the A.361 trunk road from 
 Barnstaple to Taunton.{It is a large  
{attractive settlement with a General  
{Stores, Post Office, Butchers shop and
{Public House.                         
   There is a resident sign-writer and 
 thatcher with many other interesting  
 characters.                           
   Although a few people are still     
 engaged in agriculture Swimbridge has 
 developed into a commuter village for 
 Barnstaple, four miles to the west. As
 a result{house prices}are relatively  
 high by North Devon standards. There  
 has been some {housing}development    
 during the past two decades but the   
 village retains much of it's charm.   
    There is no  play area although    
 the School uses the Glebe Field for   
{sporting activities.                  </content>
