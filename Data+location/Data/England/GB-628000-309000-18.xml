 Davids. It was built in 1955 and      
 opened on 1st October. The{church}is  
 built of brick and there is a{plaque  
 near the door saying "This stone was  
 laid by Mrs. A. M. Kirby". The vicar  
 of the church is Rev. Hilton          
 Francis. There is a service every     
 week. Every 3rd week there is a family
 service. The other two weeks there    
 is family communion at 9a.m. During   
 the week the church is used as a      
 hall for village{activies}such as     
 parties, meetings etc. and in the past
 for a youth club. At the back of      
 the church there is a field which     
 the church rents to a local farmer.   
 The church is Church of England.
