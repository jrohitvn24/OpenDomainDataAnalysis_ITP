		<title>17British Rail, Peterborough</title>
		<content>  Peterborough is a major junction,    
 with the London to Scotland main line 
 crossing the Birmingham/East Anglia   
 route. The trains on the main line run
 at speeds of up to 125 mph and travel 
 between London and Edinburgh in 4\    
 hours. The last five years have seen a
 huge growth in commuter travel and no 
 other city has as many fast trains to 
 London travelling a comparable        
 distance. By 1987 the line from London
 to Peterborough will be electrified.  
 Like elsewhere in the country, there  
 is a close tie between the Post Office
 and British Rail with one of the      
 largest depots for the carrying of    
 Post Office parcels. There is little  
 originating freight traffic, the      
 largest customer being Ketton Cement  
 who forward twenty-five wagons each   
 day.
