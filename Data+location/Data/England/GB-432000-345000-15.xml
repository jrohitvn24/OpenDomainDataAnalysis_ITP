		<content>{Belper,Milford and Hazelwood}are      
 surrounded by farmland, mostly owned  
 by the{Duke of Devonshire}or the      
{Strutt Estate.                        
 The farmland near the{River Derwent}is
 lush, but the uplands have only a thin
 layer of{topsoil}on a{sandstone bed.  
 Apart from cattle,most farms grow     
 winter wheat, spring barley,grass for 
 silage and the new lupin crop.        
 The{silage grass}is first cut in June,
 fertilized and cut again 3 weeks later
 it is then stored for winter cattle   
 feed.                                 
{Outside contractors}bring in expensive
 machinery and extra manpower at       
{harvest time.                         
 The milk from the dairy cattle is     
 collected daily by tanker lorry and   
 sold to the{Co_op or Northern Dairies 
 in Nottingham.
