		<title>11GOOSTREY SCHOOL_CHANGES</title>
		<content> There has been a school in Goostrey   
 since the early seventeenth century.  
 The present building was built in 1856
 and remained relatively unchanged for 
 many years.One of the local farmers   
 remembers attending the school in     
 the 1950's when there was just the old
 part with its pointed gables,high     
 ceilings, and windows deliberately    
 placed above eye level.               
  As the village population grew,the   
 school was extended. In the late      
 1960's still more space was needed so 
 temporary classrooms were put in the  
 playground. The situation was resolved
 in the early 1970's by the building of
 a combined Infant School and village  
 hall.                                 
  The school is now on a split site    
 with the Junior department in the old 
 building and Infant classes "across   
 the road and round the cow field".    </content>
