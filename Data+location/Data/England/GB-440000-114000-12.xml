		<content>     This is a built up, inner city    
 area situated north of the city       
 centre. Portswood Rd. runs roughly    
 North to South and is a busy route to 
 the city with four bus services.      
     Portswood is a mainly residential 
 area with a majority of the housing   
 being Victorian or Edwardian terraced 
 houses. There is a mix of council and 
 privately owned properties. Some      
 houses have garages but many people   
 have to park their cars in the road.  
 Some demolition is taking place on the
 East side of Osbourne Rd. to make way 
 for a road to link with the M3        
 motorway.                             
     Portswood Rd. is an important     
 suburban shopping area with a variety 
 of shops serving most needs, though   
 there are not too many ladies clothing
 shops.
