		<content> Eggy Peggy is a game for players and a
 caller. The players shout Eggy Peggy  
 lost a leggy, caused by what?  The    
 caller chooses a player to decide with
 him a group name e.g. animals. The    
 player goes back and tells the others 
 to choose a member of the group each. 
 The caller now shouts the name of a   
 member of the group e.g. lion and the 
 player who had chosen lion is now the 
 caller.                               
 Piggyback Attack: at least 4 people   
 can play. The rider tries to unseat   
 his opponent. It's good fun if 1O     
 people play.                          
 In French Elastic a loop of elastic is
 stretched around two people's legs.   
 The player jumps in and out or over   
 the two bands of elastic to a rhythm. 
 When the tricks are completed the     
 elastic moves up to the knees then    
 thighs and the exercise is repeated.  </content>
