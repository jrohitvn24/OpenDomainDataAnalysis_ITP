		<title>07Waddingham Village</title>
		<content> One of the interesting features of the
 village is the Waddingham Green.The   
 Green is for the general use of the   
 public. The green would have been     
 called the common land before         
 enclosures and people would have used 
 it for their animals. Often people sit
 on it and play games. In the middle of
 the green there is a huge oak tree.   
 The tree was presented to the parish  
 by Mr Hird and planted by Mr Kirby on 
 behalf of Mrs Kirby to commemorate the
 coranation of King Edward the 7th and 
 Queen Alexander June the 26th 1902.The
 green is shaped in a triangle. At one 
 side there are some shops,at another  
 there are the old and new schools and 
 on the third side is a detached house.
 The old school is another interesting 
 feature of the village,but it is no   
 longer in use.
