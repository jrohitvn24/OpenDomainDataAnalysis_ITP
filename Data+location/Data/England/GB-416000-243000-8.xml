		<content> Comments by Mr M Stowe,local resident.
 The bus service to nearby towns was   
 much better,but people who worked out_
 side the village often had cars.Trains
 were used more.Pebworth Halt was still
 in use by villagers.                  
 A lot found employment in market      
 gardening.Few do now.Most people have 
 to travel outside the village for work
 Several estates of houses have sprung 
 up in the village.They bring in more  
 retired people from outside the area. 
 Mickleton had its own policeman with  
 his bycycle,and a doctor lived in the 
 village.                              
 Films were shown once a week in the   
 village hall and a Youth Club met in  
 the Band of Hope Hall(now Joseph Webb 
 Hall).Outlying houses had earth       
 closets and no electricity.Several    
 orchards and many roadside trees,esp. 
 elm,have gone.                        </content>
