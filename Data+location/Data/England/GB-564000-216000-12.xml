		<title>12FORD END CHURCH.</title>
		<content> There is a church in our village.It is
 called{St. John the Evangelist.}The   
 church is over 100 years old.The      
 chancel is been knocked down but they 
 have to take the bricks down one by   
 one or the whole church will come down
 because the foundation was not very   
 good.The current work is costing      
 Â£40,000.It was first demolished just  
 20 years after it was built in 1881 at
 a cost of Â£5,000 but that time it was 
 decided to restore the chancel.Work   
 started at the beginning of the year  
 1985 and Rev.G. Sanders is hoping to  
 have his church back by September.At  
 the moment services are being held in 
 the village school.
