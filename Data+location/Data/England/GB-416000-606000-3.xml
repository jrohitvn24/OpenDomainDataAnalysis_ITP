 My Dad has a car. I go on holiday on  
 it. I help my dad by washing the car. 
 When his car is broken sometimes he   
 takes it to the garage to get mended. 
 My Dad teaches my Mam to drive. On    
 Sundays he takes me for a run out in  
 the car. Sometimes he takes me to     
 Chatton to see the lambs. My Dad      
 sometimes gets his petrol at Alnwick. 
 My Dad's car is light blue. It is a   
 Honda. Sometimes on Saturdays my dad  
 takes all the family to Morpeth. He   
 goes to work in the car. His car is   
 not second hand. It was a new one.
