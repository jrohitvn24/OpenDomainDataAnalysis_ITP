		<content>  There are different kinds of houses  
 in our village.Some are very old over 
 a hundred years and some have been    
 built only a few years ago.           
  In the main part of the village they 
 are mostly built of big blocks of grey
{limestone.}Sometimes they are in      
 terraces of four or five and others   
 are built on top of banks and         
 shops.Also there are houses standing  
 on their own or in twos.              
  Around the edge of the village are   
 several{council estates.}Hillside is  
 only a few years old.The houses are   
 made of{mock stone}but look very      
 attractive and are well equipped with 
 fitted cupboards and central heating. 
  Some houses are built for people with
 special jobs like the policemen.For   
 old people there are{bungalows,}new   
 blocks of{sheltered housing}and a     
 big house converted into small flats. </content>
