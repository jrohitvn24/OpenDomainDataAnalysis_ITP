		<content>     My name is Mohammed Ashraf Miah. I
 am 15 years old. I am a Muslim. Islam 
 is a complete way of life. The        
 guidance is from Allah, the creator of
 the universe. I believe in the prophet
 Mohammed and in one God, Allah. The   
 Mosque is a place of worship for      
 Muslims. The Mosque is on Middleton   
 Road, Westwood, which is near my      
 house. I should go to the Mosque and  
 pray five times a day. I go at the    
 following times, 4am, 7pm, 9.30pm,    
 llpm. I will also go at 2pm when I    
 leave school. When I get to the Mosque
 I pray to God and read the holy       
 Qur'an. The Mosque consists of two    
 houses. There are nine rooms which    
 have been made into two big rooms. The
 cost of the alterations was met by the
 muslims and the local council in early
 1980.                                 
                                       </content>
