		<title>09FULNECK VALLEY-A NATURE WALK</title>
		<content> A stroll down{Sisters' Walk}at Fulneck
 leads you through parallel lines of   
 Elm and Sycamore trees,some of the    
 former having died of Dutch Elm       
 Disease.Underfoot is pasture including
 buttercups,daisies and clover.        
       This walk leads into{Sisters'   
{Wood,}a cool beechwood allowing shafts
 of light to fall through the branches 
 onto nettles and old beech leaves and 
 nuts on the floor.                    
       The wood falls gently onto a    
 manicured golf course sloping further 
 still down towards{Fulneck Beck.}The  
 Beck is overgrown with grasses and    
 flowers.In the beck trailing green    
 hair swirls round the meanders,with   
 surface insects in abundance.In the   
 water are the larvae of midges and    
 mayfly as well as leeches and snails.
