		<content>   Adrian Wigley of Brownhills has an  
 unusual way of raising money for      
 charity. He plays the organ with his  
 nose and tongue.                      
   He noticed that it had never been   
 done before and so he gave it a try,  
 first of all using his nose. Following
 this success he then learned to play  
 the organ using his tongue.           
   His work has received public        
 recognition. He appeared on BBC       
 Television on 1st March 1984, and in  
 1986 his achievement of playing the   
 organ six hours with his nose and two 
 hours with his tongue will be included
 in the Guinness Book of Records.      
   He has raised money for many        
 charities and this year the proceeds  
 will be given to the Childrens'       
 Hospital in Birmingham. He hopes      
 shortly to play the organ with his    
 elbow.                                </content>
