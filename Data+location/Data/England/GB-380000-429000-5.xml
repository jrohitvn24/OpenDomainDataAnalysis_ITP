The biggest use of land in the built up
area is for housing, and the vast      
majority of houses are of the Victorian
terraced variety. These were built to  
house the mill workers when Burnley was
a prosperous cotton-town. The occupants
of these houses own their own homes and
many would wish to live in no other    
sort of house.                         
                                       
There is however a large estate of     
1970's semi-detached, privately owned  
houses, and an equally large council   
estate of all-but derilict property    
with about one house in ten still      
inhabited. The rest are subject to     
vandalism, with the area being         
regarded as unsafe.
