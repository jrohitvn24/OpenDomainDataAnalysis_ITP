		<title>08THE PONTESBURY OPTICIAN</title>
		<content> The Optician holds a surgery in       
 Pontesbury and has a shop and workshop
 in Shrewsbury.  He treats around 70 to
 80 patients a week.  80% of his       
 patients are adults and 20% children. 
                                       
 He works 55 hours a week and he does  
 house to house calls as well.  The    
 biggest eye problem he deals with is  
 long sightedness.  In his opinion the 
 biggest eye disease of the eighties is
 tunnel vision.                        
                                       
 The Optician makes all his own glasses
 on the premises in his workshop.  The 
 way in which he tests eyes now is with
 a computer which gives a readout.  The
 average age of his patients is 45     
 years old.  He says that carrots can  
 help to improve eyesight as they      
 contain Vitamin A!
