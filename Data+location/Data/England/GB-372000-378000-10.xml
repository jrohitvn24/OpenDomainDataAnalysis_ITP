		<title>10HISTORIC BUILDINGS KNUTSFORD</title>
		<content>   Knutsford's oldest buildings date   
 from 1688.  The Chapel was built for  
 dissenters who were allowed to carry  
 on their worship by the Toleration Act
 of 1672.                              
   Along King Street there are 17th    
 century cottages near the site of the 
 old Town Stocks.                      
   At the corner of Stanley Road and   
 Toft Road is a nineteenth century     
 house which was the residence of the  
 prison governor. It is now the Town's 
 tourist office.                       
   La Belle Epoque restaurant is a     
 nineteenth century building designed  
 by Richard Harding Watt who was       
 fascinated by Italian and Moorish     
 (North African) architecture and      
 Knutsford is famous for his work. His 
 designs can be seen on the memorial   
 tower to Mrs. Gaskell and the houses  
 in Legh Road, Drury Lane and Moorside.</content>
