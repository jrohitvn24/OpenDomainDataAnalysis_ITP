		<content>{ Some forty years ago}the specified   
 lands were used by four Dairy Herds,  
 several herds of Lincoln Red cattle,  
 goodly numbers of fattening cattle and
 herds of breeding sheep.              
  With the development of agricultural 
 machinery and technical husbandry     
 knowledge,most grassland was put to   
 the plough,so greater arable-crop     
 viability caused livestock to become  
 almost non-existent.                  
{ Today:}no Dairy Cows;only one herd of
 Lincoln Reds producing Pedigree Bulls 
 and Heifers for herd replacement:a few
 store cattle kept as a sideline by two
 people,and only one flock of about 100
 Cross Bred Ewes grazing some of the   
 low-lying,badly-drained fields,useless
 for any other purpose.                
  A few store lambs are sometimes      
 brought in to fatten on arable        
 by-products,such as Sugar Beet tops.  </content>
