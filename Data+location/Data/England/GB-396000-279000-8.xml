		<title>08FRANKLEY - A LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> Frankley as an area has grown greatly 
 in the last ten years.Since the middle
 of the seventies it has been an over  
 spill area for the overcrowded city of
 Birmingham.In this time many families 
 have moved to the new estate which    
 spreads south from the old country    
 part of Frankley.The new part seems to
 be the mid-point between the urban    
 area of the West Midlands and the     
 countryside of Hereford/Worcester.The 
 housing is mainly semi-detached or    
 terraced brickbuilt houses with some  
 blocks of low flats.These contrasts   
 with the older detached houses in the 
 area.Also purpose built for the estate
 are two First,two Middle and one High 
 School.The latter is a community      
 school and its sports hall,theatre and
 library are used by the public and    
 have increased the area's facilities.
