		<title>11 CUDHAM - THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Cudham is situated on the North Downs 
and was once called Coedham or Coldham 
meaning a cold village.  The parish    
covers an area of 5,925 acres and has a
population of 4,620 (1961). Most of the
housing is spread along Cudham Lane and
consists of large and small houses and 
bungalows with a few terraced cottages.
 Some of the flint cottages are over   
300 years old and the church,also flint
,is nearly 1,000 years of age.         
 The village is peaceful, surrounded by
lovely countryside with plenty of quiet
footpaths. Several amenities exist in  
the village including a public house,  
Post Office/Store, recreation ground,  
and garage. The village has a parish   
hall used by the various organisations 
and clubs such as Youth Club, Residents
Association, Womens Institute, and the 
Village Club. A popular village housing
is very expensive.                     </content>
