		<content> The ten farms in this area are all    
 dairy farms.  Eight of these also grow
 corn for their own animal feed and to 
 sell to large corn merchants.  The    
 size of farms range from 2,OOO acres  
 to 4O acres.  Nowadays dairy farming  
 is intensive - cows (mostly friesian) 
 calve at approx. 2 years, and continue
 to reproduce until their 12th year.   
 The corn grown here is mainly barley  
 and wheat, less of oats and maize.    
 Cash crops are Christmas trees, corn  
 on the cob and potatoes.  Other crops 
 grown are for cattle fodder - namely, 
 turnips, kale, rape and mustard.  The 
 soil here is mostly chalk-of which    
 the high acidity content requires lime
 to create a good balance for grass    
 growth (lime being obtained from the  
 hills surrounding Shillingstone).
