		<title>04Wendover Carnival.</title>
		<content>Wendover Carnival is one of the few    
events which inspires a feeling of     
community spirit in the village. It    
has been held annually in the Pebble   
Brook School grounds since 1969. It    
started as a fund-raising event to     
finance the building of the open air   
swimming pool in Wendover, but now it  
is used to fund various village        
projects and local charities have      
stalls there. Each year the Carnival   
is preceded by the increasingly popular
Coombe Hill Race, which is as well     
supported as the actual Carnival.      
Annual carnival attractions include a  
highly esteemed dog show, an art show, 
a funfair, a Fancy Dress Competition   
and The Miss Wendover Beauty Contest.  
Past memorable events have included    
Parachute Jumps, Hot Air Balloons,     
Morris Men and Gymnastic displays by   
Apprentices'at RAF Halton.             </content>
