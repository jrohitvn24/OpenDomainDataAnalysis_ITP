		<content>   Cheddleton is still without a       
 resident doctor. Surgeries are held   
 twice a week in St.Andrews Church and 
 a doctor attends the clinic from Leek.
 Leek or Cheedle provide dentists and  
 opticians. In 1903 CPC were asking a  
 doctor to live in their parish. Years 
 ago families were much in the hands of
 doctors who visited from leek, tales  
 are told of the generosity of these   
 doctors who waved fees after attending
 mothers giving birth to their children
 and seeing some of the children off to
 the fever-hospital. With the coming of
 the NHS in 1946 this burden was lifted
 from the family and in oculations have
 largely reduced serious children      
 illnesses. Now that mental illness is 
 more widely accepted, patients are    
 treated in the community,and St.      
 Edwards Hospital faces closure before 
 the end of the century.               </content>
