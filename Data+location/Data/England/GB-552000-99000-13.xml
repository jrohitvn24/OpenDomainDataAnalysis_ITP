		<title>13Friston Forest Ecology</title>
		<content> Friston Forest forms a 796 hectare    
 area of woodland,circa 1926,mainly of 
 beech in rows 6 feet apart,alternating
 with rows of pine (now being felled)  
 originally planted to protect young   
 beeches,also some sycamores.It is a   
 water catchment area for Eastbourne   
 Waterworks,who lease the land to the  
 Forestry Commision.The undergrowth is 
 bramble and elder with a proliferation
 of flowering plants of the chalk      
 downlands growing on the woodland edge
 It is a joy to see the re-emergence of
 many species of butterfly -small      
 skipper,gatekeeper, marble white,     
 grayling,red admiral,chalkhill blue,to
 name but a few. The smell of fox was  
 quite strong in parts,evidence of     
 rabbits abounded and one suspected the
 elusive badger enjoyed the protected  
 habitat.High winds had brought down   
 branches;these were to be collected.  </content>
