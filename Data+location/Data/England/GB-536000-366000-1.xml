		<content>     Our D_block area is to the west of
 Spilsby. It is situated in the south  
 east corner of the Lincolnshire Wolds;
 a range of chalk hills extending from 
 the Humber to the Fens. The appearance
 is of rolling hills, lightly wooded in
 places but otherwise covered with     
 crops and pasture and scattered with  
 farms. There are three small villages 
 and a market town.                    
     Traditionally, this is an area of 
 cattle and sheep, due to the thinness 
 of soil over the chalk. However, this 
 has recently been changed with the    
 advent of oil based fertilizers and   
 pesticides. Now the land is arable and
 produces wheat and other cash crops.  
     Most people think of Lincolnshire 
 as everlasting flat lands. For this   
 reason, the beauty of this area comes 
 as a suprise and delight with its     
 rolling hills trees and hidden valleys</content>
