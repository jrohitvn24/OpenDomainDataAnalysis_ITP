		<title>04The Archaeological Dig</title>
		<content>   On the outskirts of Dorchester a    
 site is being excavated by the Trust  
 for Wessex Archaeology, using MSC     
 labour. It was decided to dig here    
 because artefacts were found when     
 the railway was laid in the 19th      
 century, and more recently when the   
 Trumpet Major car park was extended.  
   The diggers have found many things, 
 including an{Iron Age}settlement,     
{Roman}granaries and some cemeteries   
 which were in use for 3-4 thousand    
 years! Most of the bodies were buried 
 facing South, and some showed burial  
 rituals such as coins on eyelids or   
 tongue. Many were in coffins, and one 
 had wrists and ankles tied and a      
 stone was clasped between the hands.  
   Soon, 500 houses will be built on   
 the site of the 'dig' so it will be   
 obliterated.
