		<content> Mr Bert Uden owns High Knock Farm in  
 St Mary's Road.It is 120 acres.1 acre 
 of farm land costs about Â£2000.Mr Uden
 spends about Â£3000 on sheep &amp; lambs a 
 year.His flock is made up of about 500
 ewes &amp; 400 lambs of the Romney Marsh  
 breed.A ewe at Ashford Market can     
 fetch Â£65 &amp; a ram Â£300,if it is a good
 one.A sheep dog called Canary Dog     
 works the flock.Mr Uden's sheep are   
 marked with his sign - HU - Herbert   
 Uden.The sheep are sheared every year,
 when each animal gives about 7 pounds 
 of wool.Sheep are in danger from such 
 diseases as footrot,scab,tetanus and  
 pulpa kidney.They are regularly dipped
 in disinfectant as a precaution.Foxes 
 sometimes steal the lambs.People      
 walking through the farm must remember
 to keep their dogs on leads and to    
 shut the gates.2 workers help Mr Uden 
 with the farming.                     </content>
