		<title>02ARABLE FARMING HARDWICK AREA</title>
		<content> The area is mainly arable,growing     
 winter wheat,barley &amp; some sugar beet.
 A few fields of freezer peas,field    
 beans,oil seed rape,strawberries &amp;    
 mustard(Colmans)are grown &amp; 1 apple   
 orchard.Hay is made for winter feed,  
 the first crop was spoilt by          
 continuous rain,better quality was    
 made in August.Average yield of wheat 
 was 2-2\ tons per acre,3/4 ton less   
 than last year's record;winter&amp; spring
 barley yielded 1 3/4 tons.Most straw  
 was baled for use as winter feed &amp;    
 bedding or fuel,very little was burnt 
 on field.Harvesting started early     
 August,was interrupted by rain,       
 finished mid September,but was speeded
 up where grain dryers were used,wet   
 conditions spoilt quality.1 farmer is 
 carrying out a nationwide trial on the
 effect fungicides have on wildlife.
