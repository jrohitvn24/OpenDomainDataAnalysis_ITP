		<title>02HENHAM STEAM RALLY</title>
		<content>     Henham Steam Rally is a kind of   
fete which at the moment is held once  
a year in Henham Park.This year it was 
fairly hot on both Saturday and Sunday 
.It is best to come in the morning     
when it is not so crowded.There where  
almost 120 stalls and 30 steam engines 
this year.There are fairground rides,a 
steam boat, and machines all run by    
steam.The galloping horses is the best 
ride.I won three cuddly toys which I   
called Felix,Jeremy and Pinkers. My    
mum ran the CND stall.I spent five     
pounds on rides,stalls and a hot dog a 
sausage in a bread roll.About twelve   
thousand people came from all over     
East Anglia to the rally.The new earl  
sent a tape recording from Australia   
to open the rally.There were rides in  
a helecopter  costing eight pounds for 
five minutes.There were very long      
traffic jams on the A12.               </content>
