		<title>17TILEHURST STATION</title>
		<content> The {station master }did not know the 
 exact number of trains which pass a   
 day. He said, however,that {2}        
 intercity sleepers passed a day and   
 about{800}people pass through the     
 station. It is a commuter station     
 which means it is mainly used by      
 people who go to work.Only{2}people   
 work there. they are in the ticket    
 office. Most of the trains are through
 trains and do not stop at the station.
 The most expensive train journey is { 
{Â£230 }and it goes to Wick {(1st       
{class).}Sometimes steam trains go     
 through to Reading.The latest one was 
 on the {1st of June 1985}it came from 
 Didcot.
