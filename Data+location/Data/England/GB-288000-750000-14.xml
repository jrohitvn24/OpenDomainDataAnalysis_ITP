		<title>14A Pupil on holiday</title>
		<content> Last year in the{summer holidays}of   
 1984 my sister Gemma,and I,went to our
 Granny's.She lives in a little town   
 called Golspie on the north east coast
 of Scotland.On the 16th July I got up 
 at 9.15 to go{golfing}with my third   
 cousin. We took about an hour and a   
 half.After we had finished we went to 
 the clubhouse for some refreshment and
 a game of pool.In the afternoon after 
 lunch I went{swimming}and after that I
 played{tennis}with some friends I made
 the day before.Once I came back to the
 house Granny asked me would I go      
 shopping before dinner.It took me     
 about half an hour to get everything  
 she wanted.After tea I watched        
 television and read the paper.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
