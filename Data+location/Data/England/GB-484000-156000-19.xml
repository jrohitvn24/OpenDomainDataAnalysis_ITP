 straddles two counties and includes   
 both private and maintained schools.  
 Surrey has one of its largest         
 comprehensives and a middle school,   
 whilst Hampshire has a number of      
 infant,junior, and comprehensives,as  
 well as a 6th form college each of    
 which serves its local community.     
 Within the area is also situated the  
 Farnborough Hill Convent private      
 school which caters for girls age 11  
 to 19 in competition with the local   
 comp. schools.The Greencroft school   
 completes the variety. It exists to   
 help approx 70 children with learning 
 difficulties. It draws upon an area   
 100 sq miles and pupils are           
 transported to the school by bus,     
 mini-bus, and taxi.
