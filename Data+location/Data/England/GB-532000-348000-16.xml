		<title>16Music people like</title>
		<content> We did a survey on what{music people  
{like.}We asked{35 children, parents   
{and grandparents.}We went to an old   
 peoples home, we went door to door,   
 then we asked children.               
 The old people didn't play instruments
 at school.                            
 Some of the children play instruments,
 mostly the girls. The girls played    
 recorders. The boys don't seem to play
 instruments as much. Sometimes        
 children get together and make little 
 tunes at dinnertimes and playtimes.   
 Only 3 parents played instruments, a  
 guitar, cello and recorder.           
 Nowadays more people seem to play     
 instruments than they did when our    
 grandparents were small children.     
 The grandparents and parents favorite 
 inst. were mainly piano but the kids  
 liked drums, synthesisers and         
 recorders.                            </content>
