		<title>14Transport</title>
		<content>    There are frequent{buses to Norwich
{and Ipswich}along the A140 road, but  
 elsewhere in the area transport       
 services are minimal. The{Eastern     
{Counties Bus Company}has closed routes
 and some residents have to rely on an 
 infrequent community bus and an       
 irregular service run by a private bus
 company which calls at Fritton.       
    Car ownership is therefore very    
 high with residents depending on their
 vehicles for all social, shopping and 
 work journeys. Roads are generally    
 very narrow and subject to{flooding at
{fords}in rainy periods and to{blockage
{by snow}in Winter. Many people        
 continue to use cycles for most       
 journeys. Transport is therefore a    
 significant expense for all           
 families.Pupils have transport to     
 school and workers to their factories.
