 Nine members make up the Parish       
Council under the chairmanship of Mrs. 
Atterbury who has been a councillor for
39 years. The Lighting Committee has   
been looking at the street lighting and
at their recommendation the Council    
has brought the total of lights to 41, 
this over the past few years.          
 The Council decided that the battle   
against damp and must was being lost so
the contents of the Parish Chest have  
been transferred to the  County Record 
Office in Northampton.                 
 Last year we decided to put new life  
into the Tidy Village Competition by   
presenting our own prizes for the      
prettiest hanging basket and window    
box. This was so successful that we    
have extended it to small tubs this    
year and hope for an even bigger entry 
than the 25 to 30 we had in 1984.      </content>
