		<content> Some fields have been joined to ease  
 machinery working with the consequent 
 loss of hedgerows.But generally this  
 has not,so far,spoilt the traditional 
 appearance of the countryside.Modern  
 large farm buildings for crop storage 
 and machinery are general and few     
 isolated farm cottages remain.Grant   
 aid has persuaded land owners and     
 farmers to improve efficiency and     
 output by{underdraining}and{access    
{road}construction.Livestock is still  
 kept on a few farms,mainly{store      
{cattle}and some{sheep.}Few{poultry}or 
{pigs}are kept.Horses and ponies are   
 kept by a few families for riding.But 
 there is only one riding school.A few 
 cottages and farms in village areas   
 and on the busiest roads offer flowers
 and produce for sale according to the 
 season.The total number of farms using
 the land in the block is 19.          </content>
