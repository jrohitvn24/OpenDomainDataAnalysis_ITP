The Pump House is situated in Sywell   
Park and was completed in 1906 It was  
built near site of the old mill which  
had been in existence about 600 years. 
The pumps were the final process of    
the reservoir. Water came through the  
valve tower into the outlet basin, and 
from there into 3 filter beds. It then 
went into clear water tanks and        
suction wells.                         
                                       
The water was then pumped into 11 inch 
delivery mains which fed the water     
towers in MEARS ASHBY, SYWELL, ECTON   
and EARLS BARTON. Most of the water    
was pumped to RUSHDEN and took three   
and a half hours to travel 9 miles.
