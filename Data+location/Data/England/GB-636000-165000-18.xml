		<title>18THE SAN CLU HOTEL</title>
		<content> Some distance along the Victoria      
 Parade is the San Clu Hotel built     
 in 1833.It was first called the Saint 
 Cloud although the block had          
 originally been called Granville      
 Terrace-it was renamed in 1920.       
 In 1926 it opened as a hotel and for  
 many years was the biggest hotel in   
 Ramsgate.It had five storeys and over 
 70 rooms.                             
 In 1928 only two years after opening a
 very bad fire destroyed the western   
 end costing Â£20,000 damage.The        
 shell still stands today just as the  
 firemen left it.The cause of the fire 
 is still unknown but it destroyed 20  
 rooms leaving 54 rooms today.         
 The hotel can cater for 101 people and
 32 staff are employed.The hotel always
 has enjoyed a good reputation and is  
 very much a typical medium sized hotel
 in a small seaside holiday resort.    </content>
