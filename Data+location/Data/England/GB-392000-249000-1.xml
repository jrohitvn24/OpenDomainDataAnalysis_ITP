		<title>01Pinvin and Peopleton.</title>
		<content> The villages of Pinvin and Peopleton  
 lie on gently undulating{fenland,}with
 a fine view of the Malvern hills to   
 the West, and Bredon Hill to the      
 South.                                
    The land is fertile and is used    
 mainly for arable crops and for the   
 keeping of livestock. The fruit       
 farming influence of the{Vale of      
{Evesham}is also apparent as there are 
 several orchards in the locality.     
    Both Peopleton and Pinvin exhibit a
 contrast in building styles.          
 Timber-framed houses with thatched    
 rooves and white painted wattle and   
 daub walls stand out from the post war
 developments. Both villages have been 
 "filled out" with modern houses and   
 bungalows. Peopleton is a nucleated   
 village with a definite centre whereas
 Pinvin's ribbon development has made  
 it a rather straggly village.         </content>
