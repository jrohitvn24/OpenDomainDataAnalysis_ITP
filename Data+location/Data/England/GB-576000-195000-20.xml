		<title>20RETTENDON SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   The School was built in 1878. The   
 role numbered 85, similar to the      
 present role.  The School now has its 
 own hall built in 1976, previously the
 pupils crossed a busy road to use the 
 village hall for lunch and P.E.  The  
 School is central to village life. The
 School- Master until recently, lived  
 in the school-house and played an     
 active part in the village.  The      
 annual jumble-sale and summer fete are
 great village events. The O.A.P.s are 
 the recipients of the annual Harvest  
 Festival gifts, the children          
 delivering bags to every pensioner in 
 the parish.  The School is used in the
 evening for Brownies, Guides and      
 Keep-Fit.  The School swimming pool   
 was bought by the parents, 'The       
 Friends of Rettendon School', raising 
 large amounts of money from social    
 events to buy extras like computers.  </content>
