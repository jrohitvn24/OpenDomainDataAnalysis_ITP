		<content>                           Birds -     
 Predatory &amp; Water Bird Populations.   
      The magpie  population is        
 increasing greatly with heavy         
 predation of fledglings and young     
 birds.  Little owls breed and tawny   
 owls have returned.  The barn owl     
 moved its nest site, due to           
 disturbance, rearing only l young,    
 after 2 in l983 and 3 in l984.        
      An adult female and juvenile     
 buzzard have remained from l984 and   
 kestrels are seen.                    
      At Broomy Pool 5 pairs of Tufted 
 Duck bred last year but only l pair   
 succeeded in competition with  a pair 
 of Canada Geese.  Since farm effluent 
 outwash into streams is forbidden     
 watercress has grown in the Gamber.   
 Increased fish population has brought 
 the return of the heron after 4 years 
 and kingfisher.                       </content>
