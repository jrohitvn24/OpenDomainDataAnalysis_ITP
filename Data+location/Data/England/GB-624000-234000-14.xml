		<content>  Partly in our block is the former    
Royal Navy training base,which was     
known as "H.M.S.GANGES". It still has  
the tall mast which cadets had to      
climb . Since the Navy left ,the       
grounds and buildings have been used   
as an international residential        
sports and leisure centre. Parties     
stay here for coaching in a wide range 
of sports and for general training.    
  The Village is very large,covering   
over 150 acres,of which 26 acres of    
playing fields are available for rugby,
soccer,hockey,cricket and other games. 
  There is a gymnasium,two sports halls
and a 25 metre heated indoor swimming  
pool. There are courts for tennis,     
squash and netball and archery and     
shooting ranges, both indoors and      
outdoors. When we visited there were   
150 people learning judo and Millwall  
football club were training there.     </content>
