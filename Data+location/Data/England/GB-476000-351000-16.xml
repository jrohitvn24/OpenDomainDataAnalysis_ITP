		<title>16Farndon Harbour near Newark</title>
		<content> The harbour was started in 1966 but it
 was a gravel pit before. To help them 
 they employ 3 men &amp; 2 directors. The  
 boats have had masts snapped under the
 bridge if they haven't assessed the   
 proper height. Most of the boats come 
 from Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire,   
 Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire 
 and as far away as Birmingham. The    
 largest boat was owned by Mr. Mason.  
 It was 160ft. long and 20ft. wide.    
 There are about 150 boats in the      
 harbour. The land around the harbour  
 has many trees in it which are        
 willow, alder and sycamore. There are 
 lots of birds mainly water birds.     
 There are many varieties of duck,     
 Canada geese, grebe, swans and herons.
