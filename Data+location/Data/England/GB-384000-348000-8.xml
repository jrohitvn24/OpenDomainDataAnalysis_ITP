		<content>   We interviewed some children from   
Ellison Jr School,who organised the    
clean up of Morris Square,the shopping 
precint in the High Street.It was      
always untidy and full of rubbish.On   
the wall was a big metal Phoenix,which 
was corroded and the paint had come    
off.Richard Holland and David Spence   
got the idea first,and all the other   
children agreed.So class 1E wrote to   
TheNorth Staffs. News and a reporter   
came and took their story and their    
photograph.Afew days later it was on   
the front page of the paper.Then new   
bins arrived instead of the old ones   
which had holes in.Quite a lot later a 
new Phoenix was put up.So their        
campaign had worked.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
