 three buildings, the{Village Hall,}the
{School}and the{Methodist schoolroom,  
 which are all used by various         
 organisations.The Village Hall is run 
 by a committee which includes         
 representatives from local            
 organisations.As it has an            
 entertainments licence it is the most 
 widely used building.Dances,          
 whistdrives,concerts etc. are held    
 there and the{Guides, Brownies}and    
{Senior Citizens Club}are among the    
 organisations using it. The Methodist 
 schoolroom is used by the{playgoup    
 among others. The school is mostly    
 used for school functions or by the

 which is more central to the area     
 covered.
