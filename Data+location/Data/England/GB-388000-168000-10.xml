 I like to play{horses.} Normally two  
 people play.  You need two people  to 
 play because the person who touches   
 the wall first is the winner and the  
 other loses.  It is like a race.  I   
 like horses.

 I play{cars}and I play{bulldogs.} Some
 one is on it and you have to run      
 across the playground without being   
 had.  I play with my friends at play  
 time.

 We play{hopscotch.} You need a stone  
 to play with and you throw it.  You   
 have to hop.  You need about four or  
 five people to play with.
