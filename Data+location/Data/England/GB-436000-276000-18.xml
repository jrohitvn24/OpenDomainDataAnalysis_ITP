		<content>{KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN}               
 Some days my Mum and Dad buy Kentucky 
 Fried Chicken. They always buy a big  
 bucketful because there are six of us.
 A Kentucky meal consists of one leg of
 chicken,a portion of chips,and a drink
 of your choice. The chicken is coated 
 with seasoning. Also in the big bucket
 you get a hat and a napkin. The shop  
 in on Ball Hill.                      
{FISH AND CHIPS}                       
 My favourite food is Fish and Chips.  
 We get ours from Hipswell Highway     
 Saloon. They also sell Roe,Potato     
 Scallops, Sausages,Pies,Pickled       
 Onions and Pork which is expensive.
