		<title>17NORTON POST OFFICE.</title>
		<content>   Norton Post Office has existed in   
 one form or another for nearly a      
 century and is situated in a quiet    
 country lane.                         
   It started life as a bakery, but has
 now been converted into a post office 
 and grocer. The present owners, Mr &amp;  
 Mrs A.T.Mabbett have been in residence
 since September 1980. As well as      
 running the Post Office they supply   
 Norton with things such as tinned     
 foods, soft drinks, fruit, bread      
 confectionary, and various other      
 household items as well.              
   On a normal day, one of the Mabbetts
 will run the shop, but on Thursday,   
 their 'busiest' day of the week, three
 people have to lend a hand in running 
 the shop. It is busier than usual     
 because all of the older inhabitants  
 of Norton go to collect their         
 pensions.                             </content>
