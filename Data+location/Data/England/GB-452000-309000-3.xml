		<content> My mum works at home.  She makes socks
 on a sock machine.  It makes a loud   
 noise.  Socks are a sort of clothing  
 that you put on your feet.  My mum    
 does ankle socks and long socks.  When
 my mum doesn't want to do machining   
 she does pairing.  She has to check   
 the socks to make sue there are no    
 marks on them and thenshe has to put  
 them in twos and tape them and then   
 place them in bags to be sold to      
 someone who wants to buy them.
