 West.It comprises 60 acres of land,an 
 arena, daily parades of shire horses, 
 a restaurant which seats 200 many     
 country craft shops &amp; demonstrations. 
{Kitley Caves}These were accidently    
 found by local quarry men blasting for
 limestone in 1880. After being        
 neglected they were cleared and       
 illuminated in the 1970s, and opened  
 to the public.Inside are strange rock 
 formations and pools.Recent           
 excavations have discovered bones of  
 hyenas,bears bison and deer. The caves
 are open Easter to September, free to 
 local residents.

 rhyme was written by Sarah Catherine  
 Martin in 1804 while on a visit to    
 Kitley House.The character of Mother  
 Hubbard was based on the Housekeeper. </content>
