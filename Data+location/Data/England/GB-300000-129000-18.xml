		<content> The area is popular with tourists but 
 fortunately it remains unspoilt. The  
 people who come here do so to enjoy   
 the countryside.                      
 There are few tourist facilities and  
 since the roads in the area are narrow
 there is not too much traffic.        
 Some of the farms also do bed and     
 breakfast for around Â£8.00 per night  
 or Â£10 per night to include an evening
 meal. The pub at Lowtrow Cross sells  
 coffee and snacks and has an outdoor  
 childens play area.                   
 In the field next to the pub there is 
 a small caravan site where you can    
 park your caravan  for Â£3.00 per night
 between March and October.            
 Some cottages may be rented during the
 summer, the cost per week for one     
 sleeping five people is about Â£100 in 
 he high season.
