		<title>18Shopping in Kingswood.</title>
		<content> Most families use the Kings Chase{    
{shopping precinct}at least once a     
 week, usually to shop for food at one 
 of the{supermarkets.}The adjacent car 
 park makes it easy to load shopping   
 straight into a car, but many people  
 dislike having to pay to use it.There 
 are a lot of{banks}nearby.Children and
 adults use{Building Societies}for     
 saving.There is a choice of{shoe shops
  but most people like to go to Bristol
 to buy clothes.Adults make regular    
 visits to use the{greengrocers,       
{bakers,chemists and hairdresser.}     
 Children like to use the{toy shop, the
{sports shop and the book and record   
{shop.}About 1/2 of the people         
 questioned use the fish and chip shops
 but parking restictions limit their   
 use during the day. People usually buy
 petrol at a local{garage}and have     
 their car serviced there.             </content>
