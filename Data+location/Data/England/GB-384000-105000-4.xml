		<title>04Bryanston School</title>
		<content>   1985 was a difficult year in schools
 because of{pay disputes.}Bryanston was
 not directly affected, being private. 
 The Governors gave a{pay increase}to  
 staff to match salaries in comparable 
 schools after discussion with the     
 Head. Staff were much concerned with  
 preparing for{the new exams at 16+.   
   The School launched{an appeal}for   
 money to build new craft &amp; technical  
 centres.The architect, Richard Burton,
 produced an overall plan &amp; the support
 of the designer Sir Terence Conran was
 given; both are former pupils.        
   Privilege creates conscience. Plans 
 were made in the summer term for an   
 autumn{Charities Fair}to involve all  
 the pupils &amp; staff. A barbecue, discos
 and a Valentine's Ball raised money to
 go to various charities.Pupils made a 
 sponsored parachute jump in June. The 
 African famines had a great impact.   </content>
