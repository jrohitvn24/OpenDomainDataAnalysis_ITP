		<title>11THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> There has been a church in Witheridge 
 since 900 years ago , but little of it
 remains.The present church was built  
 about 1428 , and it is called  St John
 the Baptist church.On the outside of  
 the church there's a scratch-dial     
 which isn't very common.              
 In the church yard there are rhymes on
 grave stones , really old trees ,     
 crosses , children's graves and       
 different shaped graves with angels   
 on.                                   
 Inside the church there is an angel   
 shaped lectern holding a bible.Also   
 there is a pulpit in the church which 
 has St Peter holding some keys , St   
 Paul holding a sword and bible , Jesus
 being crucified with Mary and John by 
 him and two more unnamed saints.There 
 was a tower known for its strength    
 with a spire attached to it , but it  
 got taken because lightning struck it.</content>
