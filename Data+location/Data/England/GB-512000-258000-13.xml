		<content> This is a magnificent avenue of lime  
 trees which start at Hinwick House and
 flank either side of the road going   
 south towards Harrold. The avenue     
 stretches for over one mile. The trees
 were originally planted in 1873 by the
 occupants of Hinwick House. The trees 
 are about 50ft. in height and form a  
 long tunnel effect over the road. The 
 trees are extremely attractive at all 
 times of the year, but are at their   
 most splendid during the Autumn, with 
 their orange and golden leaves. In the
 spring, the scent from the flowers of 
 the limes is quite heady. These trees 
 are a magnificent featurein the       
 landscape, which it is hoped will     
 never be lost.
