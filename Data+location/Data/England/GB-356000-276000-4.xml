		<content>     We asked people in our block      
 about their shopping habits.          
     Most people go shopping once a    
 week.There aren't any shops in        
 Bitterley so we think that when people
 go shopping they get a good store of  
 food in.It would seem that  people    
 shop on Friday because it might be the
 day when they have their wages and    
 they go out and spend it.Most people  
 use the breadman because it's an      
 important food and if it isn't fresh  
 it will go stale.Nearly as many people
 shop for people outside the immediate 
 family as don't.Twenty two people shop
 for people outside the immediate      
 family because some people might have 
 old friends and neighbours who are too
 old to shop for themselves.Most people
 travel 5 miles to Ludlow because      
 it's the most convenient place to     
 shop.                                 </content>
