  On Tuesday June 4th 1985 we walked   
 down Coppice Hill to take some photos 
 of the views.At the chair factory we  
 photographed the delivery van,which is
 a replica of a 1930's van,the owner   
 came out and lent us some bowler hats 
 to make the picture look better.Then  
 we walked along the canal tow path    
 which led us to the Roundhouse. After 
 that we walked up Marle Hill and back 
 up to school.                         
   Then we all got into the cars and   
 went on the road to Cirencester,up    
 Cowcombe Hill,and we took a photo of  
 a church.Next we went to Oakridge and 
 France Lynch and took a lot of photos.
    After all this it was time to go   
 back to school for lunch.Some of the  
 photos will be used in this Domesday  
 Project.                              </content>
