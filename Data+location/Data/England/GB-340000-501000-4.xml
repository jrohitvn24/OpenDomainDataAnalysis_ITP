		<content> The contrast between village life past
 and present is striking. The history  
 of the village up to the 185O's is to 
 do with family 'networks', Brownes,   
 Birketts, Longmires, Atkinsons, for   
 example, and to do with farming and   
 slate quarrying. There were wide      
 variations in both wealth and status, 
 but poverty was common. By 185O most  
 of the population were small farmers, 
 some from old families, and a number  
 of small craftsmen and their families.
 But the coming of the railway to the  
 area in 1847 meant that 'offcomers' or
 strangers were to become part of the  
 scene. The tendency for relatively    
 wealthy settlers to live in the area  
 but work elsewhere is a pattern       
 established in that period and it     
 continues to the present day. There is
 little scope for building and most of 
 the old farms are now private homes.  </content>
