		<content>{A School Day - a pupil's view}        
 I would be dragged out of bed by my   
 mother and be washed and dressed by   
 8.00. I would have a breakfast of     
 cereal and milk. I pack my bag and I  
 am ready to leave by 8.30. I walk     
 about half a mile to get to school.   
 School begins at 9.00 and after       
 registration we have a half hour      
 assembly in the hall. The morning is  
 filled with lessons in English,       
 maths, science and reading. There is a
 break at 10.30 during which I eat     
 crisps and play with my best friend.  
 Dinner is at twelve midday. There is  
 another short break at 2.30 p.m.      
 During the afternoon we do more       
 lessons and work and sometimes have   
 games or if it is in the summer, we go
 swimming. School finishes at 3.35 p.m.
 I walk home and either read a book,   
 do some homework or watch television. </content>
