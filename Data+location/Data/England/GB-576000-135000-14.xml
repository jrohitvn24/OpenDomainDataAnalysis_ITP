		<content>In Kent there are two main local       
newspapers and one BBC local radio     
station.The two papers are called The  
Kent Courier and The Kent Messenger.   
Each covers a great deal of local      
news.At the time of this project there 
is a  strike and we have no            
information on the Courier.According   
to our survey the Messenger was the    
most popular paper.It is over 125      
years old and has always been owned by 
the Boorway family.45,000 coppies of   
the paper in 4 editions are sold every 
week.It is politically independent     
,informative,entertaining and          
encourages reader involvment           
(competitions,letters).The radio       
station is"surprisingly"called Radio   
Kent but when it began in December 1970
it broadcasted under the name of Radio 
Medway.On the 2nd July 1983 the name   
was changed.40 people are employed     </content>
