		<content> The church is Church of England but as
 it is the only church in the village  
 it welcomes other denominations. It   
 has a choir of 12 and an organist.    
 Services are held every Sunday and    
 there is also a Sunday school unless  
 there was a family service. A young   
 peoples' group is affiliated to the   
 church and meets on Sunday evenings.  
 The vicar has been there six years and
 has no assistants. Although he lives  
 in Shepreth he conducts services in   
 Barrington village and leads religious
 education at Barrington school. The   
 church itself was built in 1635,      
 though it may have had earlier        
 origins.
