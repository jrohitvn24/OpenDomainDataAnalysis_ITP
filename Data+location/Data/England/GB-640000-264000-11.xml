		<content> At Theberton is an Anglican church    
 with round tower and thatched roof. It
 is one of a group of 4 in a 34 mile   
 territory served by one rector so     
 services are not regular. No social   
 group is attached, such as Mothers'   
 Union or girl guides or boy scouts.   
 Some Anglicans with children attend   
 Saxmundham church, for this with      
 larger congregation offers other      
 activities and youth groups. However, 
 in Leiston there is a Quaker meeting  
 house, a Methodist church in Kelsale, 
 a Baptist church near Aldringham and a
 Catholic church at Leiston - none far 
 away for a car owning community to    
 attend the place of their choice. A   
 proportion of the population attend   
 church regularly, whilst some are just
 nominally christians, but most live by
 Christian ethics.
