		<content> The main changes in the village that  
 people remarked on were that there    
 were{more houses and more people,}and 
 that there were{not so many young     
{people,}as the{younger villagers had  
{moved away}to find work other than    
 farming.   With fewer young people,   
 the village was{much quieter. }Most of
 those we asked{work locally,}and the  
 next biggest group are{retired.  }The 
 rest of those we spoke to - except for
 one who is unemployed - work in       
 Hereford.  {Most}of them{use a car}to 
 get to work, though quite{a lot walk. 
 Not many go by bus because the service
 is so bad (see PEOPLE'S LIVES 2).     
 The same is true of{journeys into     
{Hereford,}to go{shopping},to go to    
{market,}or for{entertainment  -       
 practically everyone we spoke to goes 
 by car, even though many would use a  
{bus if the service was better.        </content>
