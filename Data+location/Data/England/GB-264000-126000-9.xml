		<content> There are nine bedrooms in Castle     
 Hill.  The main living rooms are the  
 drawing room, her own sitting rooms   
 and the dining room which isn't used  
 much.                                 
 Mrs. Methan, Mr. Partridge and Emma   
 who is in the office and herself live 
 in the mansion now.                   
 When she married she lived in         
 Newmarket and came down to Filleigh   
 a lot.                                
 Her ancestores designed the gardens   
 and planted the trees on the estate.  
 Lady Margaret likes camelias because  
 of the acid soil.  The Triumphal arch 
 was built by her ancestors 200 years  
 ago to be part of the landscape.      
 When she was young there were lots of 
 horse and carts.                      
 They had a boys school up at the      
 mansion during the war because most   
 schools had been evacuated.           </content>
