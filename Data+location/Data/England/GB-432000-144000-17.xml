		<content> In our school we found that about 1/6 
 of our dads worked in the army.  The  
 second most popular was working in a  
 factory.  Just over 1/l0 of our       
 fathers work in an office and another 
 1/l0 were self employed.  Other jobs  
 undertaken by our fathers were        
 policemen,school teachers, aircraft   
 worker, civil servant, manager,       
 cleaning, air force, crane driver and 
 baker.  The most unusual job was a    
 submarine pilot.
