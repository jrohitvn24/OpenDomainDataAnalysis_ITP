 and the final one, yet to come, will  
 be called Three Score.  The housing is
 mixed private and local authority, and
 built to a much higher density than   
 nearby New Costessey.                 
                                       
 At present there are two schools,     
 Clover Hill First, and St Michaels    
 Middle;  pupils feed into the Norwich 
 City Comprehensive Schools system at  
 the age of 12.                        
                                       
 There is concern at present because,  
 being a new housing area, there is a  
 much higher than average number of    
 children of school age, and the local 
 authority wishes to use up spare      
 capacity in middle schools in less    
 favoured areas nearby ratther than    
 build further capacity at Bowthorpe.  </content>
