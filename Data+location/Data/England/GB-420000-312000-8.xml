		<content>    After collecting her daughter from 
school the Farmers Wife likes to       
garden.She prepares the                
evening meal which she serves at 6     
o'clock. She then washes up.           
  During the evening she sometimes does
office work for the farm.The wages have
to be done weekly and the V.A.T.       
returns monthly.At 9 o'clock she likes 
to have an hour or two to herself when 
she hopes to be able to do some        
knitting, sewing, or crochet before    
going to bed at 11.00p.m.
