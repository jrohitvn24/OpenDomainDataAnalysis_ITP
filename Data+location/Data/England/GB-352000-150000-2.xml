		<title>02PRIDDY: EASTWATER FARM</title>
		<content>  Eastwater Farm is run by Mr and      
 Mrs.Gibbons who breed beef cattle. The
 farm consists of 200 acres which is   
 mainly grassland but is also cut for  
 silage and hay. Silage making takes   
 place in late summer on this farm     
 which is much later than most farms.  
 This is because of the cooler climate 
 at this altitude.                     
  The cattle are black Herefords and   
 are bought when they are ten months   
 old. They are then fattened up until  
 they are two to three years old, then 
 they are ready for market.            
  As well as cattle,there are also     
 sheep and poultry. Older ewes are     
 bought and on average each has one and
 a half lambs! The lambs are kept      
 until fat enough for market. In the   
 first week of june the sheep are      
 sheared. The fleeces are taken away   
 and turned into jumpers!              </content>
