		<title>07Changing Face of Uxbridge</title>
		<content>      Uxbridge is becoming an important
 business centre,with road links to the
 West(M25 and M4) and London (M25).The 
 buildings already constructed or      
 planned for the town centre between   
 1980-1990 are mainly modern office    
 blocks.These are rented by companies  
 mainly concerned with industry or     
 technology.Some of the offices are    
 used by expanding firms,from the local
 industrial estate.There are plans to  
 expand the pedestrianised shopping    
 area and car parking facilities.A new 
 Bus Station was recently completed.   
 There are also plans for a new leisure
 and entertainment facilities,e.g a new
 library.Listed buildings have been    
 refurbished e.g the Regal Cinema.The  
 Local Planning authority aims to      
 conserve  and protect the remaining   
 areas of Uxbridge,while ensuring new  
 development compliments the area.     </content>
