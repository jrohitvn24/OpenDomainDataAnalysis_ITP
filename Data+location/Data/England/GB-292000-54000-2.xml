    One of the beaches in Brixham is   
 called the Breakwater Beach. It was   
 formed when the Breakwater was built  
 to stop the sea smashing up into the  
 Town. At Breakwater there is a slipway
 where most of the boats launch from.  
 Every year the Swimming Club has a    
 Breakwater Swim, when people swim     
 along the length of the Breakwater.   
                                       
       SWIMMING CLUB                   
 The Swimming Club has a heated ,      
 indoor,swimming pool on Ranscombe Rd. 
 just opposite the Community College.  
 Members of the public can use the Pool
 as well as the members of the Club.   
 The Swimming Pool has been there      
 about twelve years and was built by a 
 group of local townspeople led by Mr. 
 Tomlin. It was opened by the Mayor.   </content>
