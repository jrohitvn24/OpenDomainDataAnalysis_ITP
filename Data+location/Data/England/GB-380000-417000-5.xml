		<content> People living in Scoutmoor found the  
 countryside scenic and tranquil,and it
 was this that attracted them to the   
 area.                                 
   Many people,especially the aged     
 ,found the bus service inadequate ,as 
 there is only one bus every two hours.
 However,people are prepared to travel 
 long distances for shopping,leisure   
 and entertainment.They do buy everyday
 items in one of the local villages.   
   Some children have to travel 17     
 miles to Risworth near Halifax to go  
 to school,which caused a problem.     
   Elderly people found facilities in  
 the village adequate e.g clubs and    
 fund raising events,but there         
  was little for young people to do.   
   Reopening of the quarry on Scoutmoor
 caused disturbance,mainly due to the  
 noise from lorries.The noise from the 
 animal santuary brought no complaints.</content>
