		<title>13TEYNHAM CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> Teynham is the smallest village in    
 Kent to hold a proper carnival. This  
 year it was held on Saturday 13th July
 at 7 p.m. It started in Frognal Lane, 
 came along Station Road, went along   
 the London Road and back down Frognal 
 Lane. These roads were closed to      
 traffic. I don't think the crowd was  
 as big as last year. Alan Kemp from   
 our school was dressed as a chimney   
 sweep and he won a prize. I liked the 
 marching bands and the majorettes.    
 There were carnival queens from other 
 towns. Teynham Community Playgroup    
 were on a float and there was a       
 yellow submarine from British Telecom.
 My favourite float was one with       
 Romans on, from the Fox Inn. Some of  
 the Guides were dressed as circus     
 people on a float. The money collected
 goes to local charities. After the    
 procession there was a dance.         </content>
