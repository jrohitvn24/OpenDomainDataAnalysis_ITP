   In the first Domesday book Scissett 
 was merely a large woodland           
 area. Gradually the woodland was      
 cleared away. Space was needed for    
 Nortonthorpe and Wood Street mills in 
 the early 1800's. Later in that       
 century more of this wood was cleared 
 to make way for pasture land for Lower
 Busker farm.                          
  In 1825 Joseph Norton purchased most 
 of the land on which the village now  
 stands. He used water power to drive  
 scribbling and fulling machines       
 and his business supplied yarn to out-
  weavers from whom he collected       
 finished goods. At that time the main 
 A636 road was the Denby Dale to       
 Wakefield Turnpike.                   
  Joseph Norton built a row of houses  
 known as The Fleet.                   </content>
