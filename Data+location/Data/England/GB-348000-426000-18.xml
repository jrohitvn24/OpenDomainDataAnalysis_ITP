		<title>18STREET NAMES</title>
		<content>Street names may tell us something     
about the local history of our D-block.
{Priory Lane} got its name from an old 
priory.We think it may have a          
connection with Kingsway, Queensway    
,and Princess Road because castles were
often built near monasteries.          
{Howick Cross Lane} has a cross at the 
entrance to it as a memorial to those  
who died in World War One.             
Nearby each other we have Howick Cross 
Lane,Howick Moor Lane,Howick Park Close
and Howick Park Drive telling us that  
Howick used to be an important area.   
{Riddingwood} and {Blashaw Lane} are   
both named after nearby woods.         
Most street names end with Road,Close  
,Grove ,Avenue ,Drive ,or Lane though  
in our D-block we have found sreet     
names ending with Wood ,Way ,Gate ,and 
End.
