		<title>12History of C M beach</title>
		<content>      The river Umber flows into the   
 sea at one side of the beach.  Before 
 piped water was available, the houses 
 at Seaside drew water from the river  
 via the steps which are still there   
 although there is no access to the    
 beach from them.                      
      Prior to 1914 all incoming and   
 outgoing goods were carried by sea.   
 Strawberry growing used to be a major 
 industry and the bulk of the crop went
 by boat across the Bristol Channel to 
 Swansea.  Coal was brought back and   
 unloaded on the beach into horse drawn
 carts.                                
      The main Harbour Beach used to   
 be privately owned but was recently   
 bought by the Parish Council. Newberry
 Beach is still privately owned.       
 "Saltdene" the only remaining thatched
 cottage in the village is on the      
 cliffs at the side of Newberry Beach. </content>
