   Burton Salmon School is 99 years old
 but it is in very good condition. It  
 has two classrooms and two            
 playgrounds,one grass and one         
 concrete. There are 28 pupils and 3   
 teachers, but one of them is          
 part-time. The childrens' parents work
 around Burton Salmon or in it. The    
 older children enjoy maths and craft. 
 Most of the girls want to be air      
 hostesses when they grow up and the   
 boys want to be driving instructors or
 stuntmen. The children like being in a
 small school. The school has quite a  
 lot of equipment, even though it is a 
 small one. It has a lot of sports     
 equipment, an outdoor climbing frame, 
 a television and a computer as well as
 essential items such as blackboards   
 and tray units.                       </content>
