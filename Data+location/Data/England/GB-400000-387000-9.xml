		<title>09DAIRY FARMING IN THORNSETT</title>
		<content> The farmer showed us a milking parlour
 where he milks ten cows at a time.The 
 milk goes straight into  glass        
 containers through pipes.The cows are 
 milked early in the morning and at    
 half past seven at night.The cows are 
 fed during milking to keep them       
 happy.The tanker comes at twelve      
 o'clock to collect a tanker full of   
 milk.The farm has a lot of warm pens  
 called winter pens and a large barn   
 where silage is stored for feeding the
 cows in winter. A lot of machinery is 
 kept in another barn- a small combine 
 harvester,potato planter,two tractors,
 a plough and lots of others.There was 
 also a cow which had a lame leg so it 
 had a stable of its own in the        
 corner.There were seventy cows on the 
 farm,all fresians.Some of their calves
 were brown and white because the dad  
 was a hereford bull.                  </content>
