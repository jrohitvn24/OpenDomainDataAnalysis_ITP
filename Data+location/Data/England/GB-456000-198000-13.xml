		<title>13NEW FARM, TOOT BALDON</title>
		<content>Ernie and Annie Greenaway rent 68 acres
from Oxfordshire County Council.  He   
buys calves to fatten up to sell as    
beef-cattle.  His real interest is 5   
horses which his youngest son rides    
successfully in competitions.  He is   
semi-retired having sold his milk herd.
His day starts at 7.30 a.m.. After     
putting the cows in with the calves, he
breakfasts, then feeds the horses and  
mucks out. Ernie also rents 29 acres   
for grazing.                           
The house was built in 1928 and they   
have been there for 22 years.          
The land farmed by Ernie and Mr. Brook 
was acquired from Queens College for   
the returning servicemen of the First  
World War. Originally it was divided   
into 5 parts.                          
The Greenaways are an old Marsh Baldon 
family. Ernie was one of 8 children,   
all involved in farming.               </content>
