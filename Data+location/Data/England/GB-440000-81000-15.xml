		<title>15BRIGHSTONE HOLIDAY CAMP.</title>
		<content>  The holiday camp is situated between 
 the cliffs and the Military Road. It  
 was built in 1939 when it had 17 acres
 of land. The rapid erosion of the     
 cliffs has left it with only 8 acres. 
  The camp is made up of a number of   
 chalets around a grassy area. There is
 a putting green on the grass. The camp
 also offers crocquet,bowls, netball,  
 basketball and crazy golf.There is    
 bingo, dancing and live entertainment 
 in the evenings.                      
  We were allowed to use te indoor     
 heated swimming pool. It was quite    
 large with a big curved slide! The    
 pool was not being used by the        
 residents at that time as most of them
 were Old Aged Pensioners. The owner   
 told us that most of the visitors were
 old but that he had some families with
 young children staying.               
  Over 60 people are employed here.    </content>
