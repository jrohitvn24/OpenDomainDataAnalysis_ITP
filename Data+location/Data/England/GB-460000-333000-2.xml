		<content>{The Church of St. Mary the Virgin,    
{Plumtree, Nottinghamshire.}           
 St Mary's is one of the oldest parish 
 churches in Nottinghamshire and was   
 recorded in the original Domesday     
 Book. Saxon stonework can be seen at  
 both ends of the nave. The tower is   
 early Norman, of the 11th century, and
 built up against an earlier Saxon     
 wall. The tower holds three, regularly
 rung, seventeenth century bells. The  
 treble, cast in 1609, the second cast 
 in 1620, and the tenor, cast in 1621  
 were products of the Oldfield family, 
 owners of Long Row bell_foundry, the  
 major bell-founding centre of the     
 midlands in the sixteenth and         
 seventeenth centuries. The North aisle
 was originally 13th century, but was  
 entirely rebuilt with stone from the  
 old Trent Bridge.
