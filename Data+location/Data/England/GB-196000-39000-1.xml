		<title>01Caerhays - General Review</title>
		<content> This area starts at Dodman Pt. where  
 there are remains of an iron age      
 promontory fort and goes along the    
 coast to the unspoilt Hemmick Beach.  
 Over the fields above Percunning Cove 
 to the beautiful Porthluney Beach,    
 which is overlooked by Caerhays Castle
 ,set among acres of woods and parks.  
 Further along the coast is Portholland
 a small cove with a cluster of houses.
 The area is mainly farmland with      
 farmhouses and hamlets at Boswinger,  
 Penare,Treveor,Trevessen and          
 Caerhays.There is a large Hostel and  
 Methodist chapel.There is a village   
 school built in 1969 and cricket      
 ground.Much of this area is protected 
 by the National Trust and Countryside 
 Commissions in the Heritage Coast     
 Project.So the coastal footpaths,tiny 
 coves and sandy beaches can never be  
 spoilt.                               </content>
