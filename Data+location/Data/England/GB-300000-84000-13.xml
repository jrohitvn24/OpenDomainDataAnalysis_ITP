		<title>13THE ROYAL MARINES</title>
		<content>  Some of Woodbury Common is used by   
 the marines for military training.It  
 has been used for this since the      
 second world war.The marine camp used 
 to be situated on the common, but now 
 is at Lympstone.                      
  The sort of training carried out is  
 combat skills,patrolling,section and  
 troop attacks and defence exercises.  
 Fitness training is done in most of   
 our area,especially using the country 
 lanes.The endurance course runs across
 Lypmstone Common.                     
  Live ammunition is not used on the   
 Common except on the Grenade Range    
 which is out of our area.Weapons used 
 are Self Loading Rifles,General       
 Purpose Machine Guns,and occasionally 
 Carl Gustav anti-tank guns.           
  The land the marines use is leased   
 from Clinton Devon Estates.
