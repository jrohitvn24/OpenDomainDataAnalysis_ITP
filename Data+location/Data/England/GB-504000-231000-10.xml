		<title>10PULLOXHILL PLAYERS</title>
		<content>  The Players originated from a small  
 group of women meeting to put on      
 entertainments in a shelter in the    
 village.From such small beginnings,   
 now a group of about 45 men,women and 
 children meet every Thursday evening  
 to put on plays,variety shows and     
 pantomimes.The Pulloxhill Players can 
 create their own scenery,costumes     
 and props.from within their           
 membership.Occasionally they perform  
 outside the village when requested-   
 this is called "Outside Broadcasts".  
 Junior members often stay on to become
 full adult members. Currently adult   
 membership is Â£2.00p.a. and Juniors   
 pay 50p per performance.              
  The Players now use the village hall 
 where there is a small stage and a    
 tiny dressing room for everyone to    
 share.Ashed houses the props.
