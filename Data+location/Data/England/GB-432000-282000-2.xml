		<title>02INTERVIEW WITH MRS HELLIER.</title>
		<content>{by CHLOE TOAL age10,VICTORIA WAIN     
{age10,KAREN PIEROTTI age10.}The house 
 Mrs.Hellier lives in,{3,PARKSTONE RD},
 was rebuilt in 1946.She has lived in  
 the area for 60 years.In 1941 there   
 were lots of craters in the roads     
 caused by the bombing.In the war when 
 trams went into the depot,the wires at
 the top of the trams sparked.Thats the
 reason people believed there was so   
 much bombing along the road.After the 
 war, buses replaced trams because the 
 roads were in such bad condition.Mrs  
 Hellier said that Coventry has changed
 over the last few years;Foleshill Rd, 
 Old Church Rd.and Beresford Ave.used  
 to be lovely areas.At the bottom of   
 Clinton Rd.there were fields. The     
 children used to swim in the canal.   
 Then they built a factory.The only    
 bother she gets from the factories is 
 the sawing from the timber-yard.      </content>
