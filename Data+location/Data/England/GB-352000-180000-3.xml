		<content> Most people are of the opinion that   
 the motorway has split the village in 
 half and that the industrial area is  
 creeping ever nearer, bringing with it
 pollution and more traffic. One       
 persons attitude was that this area   
 was a dirty place to live in. Anothers
 that with all the heavy traffic in the
 area, there would be a tragic accident
 before long.                          
 CLUBS
