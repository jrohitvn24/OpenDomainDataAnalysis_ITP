		<content> The main employers of labour in the   
 area offering permanent jobs are      
 small{building contractors}and        
{farmers.}The{hotels, restaurants}and  
 other establishments concerned with   
 tourism usually offer only temporary, 
 part-time work for perhaps three      
 months of the year, which is generally
 taken up by women. A number of people 
 are{self-employed,}and these offer a  
 variety of services such as{gardening,
{boat maintenance, welding, general    
{house maintenance, etc. But such jobs 
 in so sparsely populated an area are  
 limited. The majority of employed     
 people travel outside the area for    
 their work. The nearest large         
 employers to Coverack are the{British 
{Telecom Satellite Communications      
{Centre on Goonhilly Downs, five miles 
 away, and the{Royal Naval Air Station 
 at Culdrose, eight miles distant.     </content>
