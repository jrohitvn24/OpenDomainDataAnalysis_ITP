		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> When dinner time came, I went to      
 wash my hands. We sat down to wait    
 for the other children. We all had    
 our dinner. After dinner we went      
 out to play. My brothers and sister   
 go to town to get their dinner. In    
 the afternoon we practiced for{sports 
{day.}When we had finished sports,     
 we had to play, then we did some      
 work. Then came time to go home. My   
 mum collected Debbie and I. We        
 waited for Derek, Stephen and Esther. 
 We all went home together. After a    
 time we were playing out in the       
 garden. Derek and Stephen were play   
 fighting, I was{flying the kite}I     
 made and Debbie was with the dog.     
 Derek noticed that Auntie Dosh and    
 Uncle Joe and our cousins had come.   
 We did not know how they knew where   
 we lived.
