		<title>16THE STEYNE - SW.BOGNOR REGIS</title>
		<content>{The Steyne}is one of the most         
 interesting roads in our area. The    
 area is subject to a{preservation     
{order}and ,therefore, the exterior of 
 the houses remain as they were in     
{Georgian}times though many have been  
 converted into flats.Down the centre  
 of the roadway is a{communal garden   
 which is now maintained by the        
 council.In{The Steyne}is{Bath House   
 where in the late{1800's}sea water    
 baths could be taken.Hot baths cost 2s
 and cold 1s.At the sea-end of the     
 Steyne is a{drinking fountain}which   
 was built on the Promenade to         
 commemorate the{Diamond Jubilee of    
{Queen Victoria.}It was moved to{The   
{Steyne}in 1969 after being rescued    
 from a council yard.Today's residents 
 are concerned about the number of cars
 being parked there by shoppers  and   
 about the dogs fouling the gardens.   </content>
