		<content>{Agriculture}is the only{productive    
{industry}in the area. This may be due 
 to local opposition encouraged by the 
 planning authorities. There are{a few 
{small businesses}mostly to meet local 
 needs.  Several builders with their   
 allied craftsmen operate from the     
 village.  They have developed special 
 skills in the restoration &amp; extension 
 of graded and other dwellings.  Other 
 businesses comprise an old established
 signwriting firm, motor body repairers
 &amp; a firm offering accounting services,
 &amp;, via an agency, the usual facilities
 of a Building Society. There is also a
 partnership of property consultants   
 and publishers.  The number of people 
 employed by these concerns is minimal 
 and not many are recruited from the   
 local population. The majority commute
 either to nearby towns or London which
 offer a broad spectrum of{employment. </content>
