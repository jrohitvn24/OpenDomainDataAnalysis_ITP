		<content>  The Domesday Book records that Wedvne
 was held by 5 brothers as co-heirs and
 they could go where they pleased. The 
 name means "hill where wheat is       
 grown".                               
  Mr. Brunt was born in 1908 and has   
 lived all his life in Whaddon. His    
 young interviewer learned this:       
  The Manor House was then empty but   
 its new owner arrived by horse and    
 carriage in 1909. In 1939 the Manor   
 became Wynstones School. Dutch elm    
 disease caused the 250 year old elm   
 trees around the green to be cut down 
 a few years ago. The only shop in the 
 village was the Post Office stores. It
 does not have even that now.          
  Electricity came to Whaddon only     
 in 1951, just after the arrival of    
 mains water. The village pump still   
 stands. The old "Bull" pub is now     
 called "Tillstones", a house.         </content>
