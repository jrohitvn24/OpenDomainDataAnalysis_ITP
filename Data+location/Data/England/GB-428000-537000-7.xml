 Most of the people in Bowburn have    
 computers some people have an Atari   
 games machine.Most of the computers   
 that people have a ZX 48K Spectrum and
 a few have Vic 20 computers.Our school
 has two BBC Acorns.My computer is a   
 Vic 20 and I have seven games for     
 it.We have just bought an 8K and a 16K
 ram pack.This gives the computer a    
 larger memory and now we can type in  
 programs out of computer books we have
 just bought.Stuart Haigh has also a   
 VIC 20 so we usually swap games.We are
 thinking of selling our computer and  
 buying a Spectrum 48K,but we changed  
 our minds and we are keeping our VIC  
 20 instead because,there are a lot    
 more programs which we have not typed 
 in yet.
