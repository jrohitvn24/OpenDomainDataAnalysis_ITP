		<title>17THE CHANGING POPULATION</title>
		<content> There are distinct social groupings.  
 Some farms belong to old Devon yeoman 
 families where they have remained for 
 generations e.g.Yellands, Beetor      
 (since 1720) and Shapley. But many    
 have been bought by middle class      
 non-Devonian "escapees" e.g.Hole,     
 Middlecott. Often only a few acres are
 kept with the house and the           
 rest sold. This has fragmented the old
 farm units and led to destruction of  
 the old compact community life.       
 Lettaford is an example of a dying    
 community where there are now only    
 holiday cottages looked after by the  
 farmer's widow, whose son drives an   
 ice-cream van. Batworthy, once        
 boasting a baker, blacksmith, and     
 brewery (until 1920),now has 3        
 derelict cottages in which the young  
 occupants of the mill would like to   
 establish a craft centre community.   </content>
