		<content>Our local vicar has wavy grey hair and 
wears spectacles.His face   is a bit   
wrinkled.When we went to see him he was
wearing  a clerical collar,a grey suit 
and black shoes.He is kind and truthful
and works hard.When he is giving out   
books to the children at Sunday School 
he wears a purple cloak with a gold    
cross.He is in charge of three         
churches,he is Priest in Charge of     
Bradley,The Rector of Church Eaton and 
the Vicar of Moreton.On a Saturday     
morning he goes to the prison.When     
someone rings up his wife she is always
pleased to say that he is in prison and
they wonder what he has done.He goes to
prison to see the people who are ill or
in trouble.On Friday he takes his wife 
shopping.Sometimes he works in the     
garden.He takes wedding,funeral and    
christening services,weekly services   
and visits people in their homes.      </content>
