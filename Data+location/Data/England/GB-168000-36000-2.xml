 The population of Four Lanes and      
 surrounding area is estimated to be   
 two thousand people,80% of these live 
 in the village The village people are 
 one third Cornish,two thirds          
 "foreigners".It is noticeable that the
 newer,younger people live in the more 
 modern houses, the Cornish families   
 occupy the older more traditional     
 granite built dwellings.The community 
 is quite a changing one due to        
 R.N.A.S.Culdrose and cheaper housing  
 than in Redruth, three miles          
 away.Outside the village some of the  
 smallholdings are bought by up-country
 people to raise a few animals and live
 a self-help life style few last       
 long,other properites are used as     
 holiday or second homes and stand     
 empty for quite long periods.
