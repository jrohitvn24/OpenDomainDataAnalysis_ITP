 Mr Dixon, the Butcher, whose shop is  
 in Main Street was interviewed.  His  
 house dates back to 1770 and it used  
 to be called Pinfold Cottage until his
 grandmother planted a Walnut tree in  
 the garden and it became known as     
 Walnut Cottage.  It is now known as 35
 Main Street.                          
 Somewhere in the line of Dixons is a  
 Lord Mayor of London.                 
 Mr Dixon still does his own           
 slaughtering in the yard at the back  
 of the shop. He works a very long day 
 but he wouldn't change his job.       
 Fillet steak is the most expensive cut
 of meat, and breast of lamb the       
 cheapest.  Some of the tools he uses  
 are; cleavers, skewers, saws, and a   
 variety of knives.
