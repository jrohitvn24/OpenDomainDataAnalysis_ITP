		<title>14FARMING.</title>
		<content>{ Hill Farm Elsfield,}is owned and     
 farmed by Mr Garson. Mr K. Bradford,  
 the farm manager since{1968,}is       
 responsible for{750}acres of farmland 
 on which crops are grown, including   
 barley and wheat. There is a five year
 crop rotation, with different fields  
 rotated, sown and harvested.          
  It is a modern farm, machinery-wise, 
 with{7}tractors and{2}combine         
 harvesters which cost over{38,000}    
 pounds each. They have lots of farm   
 animals including{cows, bulls,}       
{chickens,}etc.                        
  They also run a{'Pick Your Own'}     
 system, with fields reserved for      
 people who want to pick their own     
{fruit,}or{vegetables.}                
  The farm, however, does not get much 
 of its income this way but from       
 selling the{various crops}grown.
