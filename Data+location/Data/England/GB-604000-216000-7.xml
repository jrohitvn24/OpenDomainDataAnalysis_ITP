		<title>07BRIGHTLINGSEA TOY FACTORY</title>
		<content> The toy factory was started as a      
 cottage industry in 1960 by Susan     
 Wynter.The business earns its income  
 by constructing educational toys for  
 the blind,handicapped,and pre_school  
 children,such as dolls houses,building
 kits,and jigsaws.These toys are made  
 from different woods,hard beech from  
 Romania,soft pine from the U.K,plywood
 from Russia,and a compacted paper     
 board,called Medite from Ireland.     
 12 men work in the factory,and the    
 company has recently combined with a  
 firm in Southend. The wood is kept    
 with care so it does not warp.In the  
 process of toy-making the wood is     
 ripped,planed,sanded,and then sprayed 
 with non-toxic paints,and decorated by
 hot foil pressing,or silk screen      
 printing.The toys are sold to         
 companies in Britain,such as Galt,and 
 also firms in America.                </content>
