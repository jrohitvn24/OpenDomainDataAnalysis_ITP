area we are studying.I am eight years  
old and I live with my mummy and daddy 
my two brothers,David who is six years 
old and Terry who is one years old.My  
daddy works with computers and he often
works away from home. I go to Whaddon  
First School with my friends who live  
in Whaddon, Nash and Beachampton.There 
are thirty nine children in my school. 
In September I am going to Great       
Horwood Combined School with seven of  
my friends. Abus will take us to our   
new school.My daddy is going to work to
work in America for a little while and 
we are flying out to join him for a    
holiday.
