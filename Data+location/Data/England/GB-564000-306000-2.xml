		<title>02Shouldham-A typical weekend</title>
		<content>{JUNE 1985} Most children got up by    
 9.30am and watched television. Others 
 read and played and some went shopping
 to Downham or King's Lynn. Much of the
 Saturday was spent in these activities
 whilst the parents were doing jobs    
 like washing, decorating or gardening.
  A few went to visit relatives; the   
 furthest journey being made by road   
 was to Hatfield.                      
  Sport or physical activity played a  
 small part - some went for a cycle    
 ride, swimming or horse riding.       
  The evening was spent watching       
 television or reading and most        
 children were in bed by 9pm. although 
 some did not go until 11pm.           
  The Sunday followed much the same    
 pattern but there was more emphasis on
 family activity such as walks or a    
 ride out in the car.Bedtime was on    
 average earlier.                      </content>
