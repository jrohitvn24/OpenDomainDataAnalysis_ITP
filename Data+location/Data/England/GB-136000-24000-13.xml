		<content>{Sennen Playgroup}is a group for two   
 three and four year olds to learn     
 about things.At{playgroup}they get    
 them ready to go Sennen School.When   
 they come to the School they will know
 the teachers because the teacher goes 
 to see them before they go to Sennen  
 School.When they go on to Sennen      
 School they stay until they are eleven
 years old.At the playgroup they have  
 drink and biscuits at ten o,clock in  
 the morning and it starts at  nine    
 o,clock and finishes at 12 o,clock. It
 is good for little people because they
 like to play and  paint and take their
 picture home for their mums to stick  
 up on the wall and for their older    
 brothers and sisters to see.
