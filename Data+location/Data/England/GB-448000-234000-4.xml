		<content>     There is supposed to be an        
 underground tunnel to the church from 
 the house but they have not found it  
 yet.                                  
     In King's Sutton long ago there   
 used to be several lepers.   Leprosy  
 was an extremely bad skin disease.    
 In the Manor there are two holes      
 situated in the cellar.   The people  
 of the house left scraps from dinner  
 and the lepers would collect them.    
 It was important that the people did  
 not touch the lepers.   The window was
 sometimes called The Alms Window.     
 Alms means charity.   We had never    
 heard of leprosy and one of our group 
 thought it was a story about leopards!
        There are several old doors    
 made of thick oak. Some are covered in
 green baize.  The doors are very thick
 so the noises from the kitchen could  
 not be heard.                         </content>
