		<content>   The surveyor marks out the site with
 wooden sticks. Trenches are then dug  
 to a depth of about one and a half    
 metres with a JCB which is a kind of  
 mechanical digger.                    
   Builders fill the bottom of the     
 trenches with concrete. This concrete 
 is delivered to the site in huge      
 mobile concrete mixers. The bricklayer
 next builds two walls, with a gap     
 between them, up to ground level.     
 These are covered  with a damp        
 proof course, made of a plastic       
 material, to prevent damp rising.     
   Two layers of concrete are then laid
 over the inside of the house with a   
 sheet of polythene between them. This 
 makes the ground floor.
