 CHEMICALS.                            
        I think that the S.C.M.        
 chemical works in Immingham is very   
 ugly and dirty even though people     
 still work there. Some of the         
 buildings are new but most of them are
 old. There are lots of chimneys out of
 which comes polluting smoke. There are
 a lot of waste chemicals which are    
 burnt and that is how we get polluted 
 air. The buildings look horrid; some  
 are low but most are high, at least 50
 metres. There are lots of pipes but   
 not many windows; part of it looks    
 like a giant vacuum cleaner. There are
 lots of fences, sheds, warehouses and 
 oil tanks with lots of traffic making 
 it oily, smelly and noisy.
