		<content>   Other than a dozen dwelling houses  
 there is no housing developement      
 except for the conversion of old      
 estate buildings to dwellings and the 
 erection of two houses on the site of 
 Membland Hall.                        
                                       
   The whole of the block presents very
 much the same picture as it must have 
 done{9OO years ago}at the time of the 
{original Domesday survey}when it      
 consisted of the Domesday Manor of    
 Lambside Farm in the block, and part  
 of the Domesday Manors of             
 Battisborough and Membland whose      
 centres are outside the block, except 
 that the layout of the field pattern  
 may have been different with much more
 rough grazing and rocky outcrops.
