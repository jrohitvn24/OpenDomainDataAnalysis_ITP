		<content> A wide variety of clubs and           
 organisations exists for children and 
 adults. Scouts, Cubs, Guides and      
 Brownies, together with a village     
 Youth Club, Pantomime Group and       
 Women's Institute group, all meet in  
 the village hall which is run by a    
 committee.                            
                                       
 This committee raises funds throughout
 the year, through dances and sporting 
 events, to help support the various   
 groups. A village firework display in 
 November is a popular annual event.   
                                       
 Other groups, such as the 'Searchers' 
 youth group and the 'Tatworth Wives', 
 are affiliated to the Parish Church   
 and meet in the Church Room.
