		<title>04The Industrial Estate</title>
		<content>  The{estate}was opened in the 1940's  
 but got underway in the 1960's.Since  
 then it has grown conciderably and    
 there is a good diversity of business.
  We walked the estate today,June 24th 
 1985 to see the extent and type of    
 factory there is.There are{5 main     
 categories.{a) Double glazing.        
{b)Engineering(large and small).c)Food 
{and food distribution.d)clothing and  
{footwear.e)Auto spares.               
  We visited four of the doubling      
 glazing factories.People today are    
 very aware of the need to conserve    
 heat and energy.                      
  Everest is the most well known double
 glazing firm.They took us on a tour of
 inspection.                           
  Frozen foods,food preparation and    
 food distribution are well to the     
 fore;as these are also a modern aspect
 of the industrial scene.              </content>
