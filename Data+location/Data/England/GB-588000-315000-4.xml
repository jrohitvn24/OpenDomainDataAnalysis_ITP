		<title>04LOCAL HISTORY CHANGING TIMES</title>
		<content>A lot of young people take no interest 
in the older members of society,and    
find them boring and over talkative of 
times gone by.Favourite lessons seem to
follow a pattern of art, craft and PE  
and punishment in school includes      
detention,which is gained by being     
rude,talking and fighting.             
For old people in times of war,evenings
were spent darning clothes to be used  
again,it was a fact that new clothes   
were difficult to obtain,and some women
knitted comforts for the forces or     
listened to the radio .Nobody could    
remember being bored.There are mixed   
opinions of today's young people,some  
are good,some are bad.Most people are  
agreed on blaming a home-life of       
insecurity for the problems like       
football,hooliganism.All in all,times  
have changed a lot over the last fifty 
years.......                           </content>
