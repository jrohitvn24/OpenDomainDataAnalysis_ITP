 Infant school, a Junior school and    
 Bohunt Community Centre and School.   
 Bohunt also has a playgroup for young 
 children below five years old, after  
 going to one of the playgroups        
 children move onto Liphook Infant     
 school. This has three years and about
 300 pupils.After going there the      
 pupils move to the Junior school which

 are 11 years old they move to Bohunt.
