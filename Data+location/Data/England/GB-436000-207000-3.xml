		<title>03House Building Techniques</title>
		<content> We found out how a house is built. The
architect draws up the plans, and then 
the quantity surveyor works out what   
materials are needed and what it will  
all cost. The plans are given to the   
builder who marks out the site with    
wooden pegs and tape. The top soil is  
taken away, trenches are dug and the   
foundations are laid using concrete.   
 Now there are new methods of building:
Wimpey build the inside walls of wood  
and put in doors and windows.Then they 
put on the roof. Last they build up the
outside walls. Cranbrook build in the  
traditional way and build the outside  
walls first and put the roof on last.  
The newer method is much cheaper.      
All the new houses have wooden windows 
and doors. In any one street there are 
different sizes of houses and different
styles. Most of the houses are built of
reconstituted stone with some of brick.</content>
