    Edingale is a small village in the 
valley of the River Mease. It is       
surrounded by very fertile land on     
which the farmers grow various arable  
crops.                                 
    Long ago, on the site where the    
village now stands there was a Saxon   
encampment.The population of the       
present village is about 450 so most of
the villagers know one another well.   
    There is a great variety of housing
amongst the 157 dwellings in the       
village and recently new houses have   
been built in Moorescroft.There are 42 
semi-detached houses, 13 old cottages  
38 detached houses, 28 bungalows, 9    
terraced, 13 link-detached houses and  
10 flats.
