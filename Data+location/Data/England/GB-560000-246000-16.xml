		<title>16THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> An early stone church was built  1150,
 although there may have  been a church
 there previously.The firt vicar was a 
 Master Roger 1235. Of special interest
 in the church are the Norman tiles in 
 the chancel and south porch, and some 
 good examples of early Elizabethan    
 bricks.The remaining stained glass is 
 of medieval origin.There is one       
 famous brass, much favoured by brass  
 rubbers.The church is in need of much 
 restoration. A programme was begun in 
 1983,aiming to repoint the tower, and 
 repair lead and beams.The original    
 estimate was put at Â£25,000, but so   
 far stage 1 of a 3 stage plan has     
 alone cost Â£20,000.At present there is
 an interregnum but the new rector Rev.
 Girard will soon be responsible for   
 the 3 parishes of Horseheath, Balsham,
 and West Wickham. Services_ Sun.8_15  
 attend.Fam. serv.(monthly) 25 attend. </content>
