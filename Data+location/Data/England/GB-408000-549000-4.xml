		<content> In the main families shop in Consett  
 at one of the{supermarkets.}Some      
 families do travel out of town to do  
 their shopping at{hyper-markets}.There
 is very little opportunity to do much 
 shopping in Delves or Grove areas(but 
 Blackhill does have more shops) so    
 these people must{travel to shop.     
    In recent years a new bus stand and
{covered market}have been opened in    
 Consett and a{shopping precinct.}The  
 main shopping area is gradually       
 becoming traffic free. The local      
 traders do not like this market. The  
 number of shops have been reduced in  
 recent years since the closure  of the
 steelworks in 1980. Others have moved 
 location. The Co-op which had an      
 expansive site which it had occupied  
 for many years has now moved into the 
 pedestrian way.
