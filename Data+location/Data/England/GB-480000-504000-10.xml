{Grosmont}is a small village which has 
 only two shops - the CO-OP and a post 
 office. However, it attracts a large  
 number of tourists each year who come 
 to see the{'NYMR' steam trains,}which 
 run between{Grosmont}&amp;{Pickering.     
                                       
 Other attractions in the village      
 include the{'Loco Sheds'}where        
 visitors can go and watch the steam   
 trains being renovated, a local garden
 centre and a{BMX circuit.             
                                       
 The village started life in the year  
{1200}when land was given to build a   
 priory. Later on the village expanded 
 with the discovery of{iron ore.}The   
 mine workings closed long ago.
