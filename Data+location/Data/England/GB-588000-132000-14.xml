		<title>14TENTERDEN HIGH STREET</title>
		<content> In Tenterden High Street it is very   
 busy, especially when you go to       
 school. The only problem is that      
 people park their cars every where.   
 Quite a few of the shops like the     
 Gallery Book Shop are old. At half    
 term we go to the market and one day  
 we went up the St. Mildred's church   
 tower and took a photograph of it. On 
 the field next to the recreation      
 ground there are sometimes fairs or   
 the circus. On the recreation ground  
 we have swings, a slide, climbing     
 frame,and a see-saw on which we can   
 play all the rest of the year. On     
 Saturdays during the winter the       
 Tenterden Football Club play matches  
 on the field next to the rec. The     
 Cricket Club play at Small-hythe and  
 there is a 9 hole golf course on the  
 Woodchurch Road.
