		<title>04RIVER EHEN OF CLEATOR MOOR</title>
		<content> As far as rivers go,the River Ehen    
 which runs through Cleator Moor is    
 not very long. It flows from Lake     
 Ennerdale to the Irish Sea.It contains
 eels,brown trout,sea trout and salmon 
 which swim up the beck to spawn.      
 Fishing was not too good last year,as 
 there was not enough water for the    
 fish to swim up the beck, until late  
 on in the season. Another hazard was  
 the wild mink which roam the banks of 
 the river. Poaching is also a serious 
 problem. The water is very clear and  
 runs very quickly.A lovely part of the
 beck is under Wath Brow Bridge where  
 people stay and have picnics in the   
 summer,dogs splash and paddle while   
 children skim stones,and swim in the  
 deep pools.
