 The Rawcliffe Bridge Youth Club is    
 held twice a week on Mondays and      
 Thursdays from 7 o'clock to 9.30. At  
 the youth club you can play snooker,  
 pool, and badminton. The youth club is
 held at Rawcliffe Bridge school and   
 youth lounge. If you are a member of  
 a youth club you pay 10p to get in but
 if you are not a member you pay 20p.  
 You can buy crisps and pop and other  
 things like that. On hot days in      
 summer the people play cricket and    
 rounders or just mess about on the    
 field. In winter the people from this 
 youth club go inside and play         
 badminton, they dance to the music and
 after they have danced they have      
 a drink and something to eat. On      
 Monday they buy a bag of chips from   
 the Nippy Chippy.
