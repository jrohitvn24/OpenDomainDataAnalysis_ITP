		<content>     There are quite a few species  of 
 tree around school. Around the mansion
 and along the drive there are at least
 12 different species. Many were       
 planted by the Minet family from      
 (1900) and some are even older. These 
 trees include Wellingtonias which are 
 now 50 metres, Horse Chestnuts 30m    
 as well as Cedars, Corsican Pines and 
 Scots Pines. Lime trees are well      
 represented as in the 1950's an avenue
 of elms down the drive were replaced  
 by 20 Lime trees, these are now 10m   
 high. The newest tree is a disease    
 resistant elm which is part of Pitney 
 Bowes Elms across Europe project; an  
 attempt to replace some of the lost   
 elms. It has a 50 year diary to chart 
 its progress.
