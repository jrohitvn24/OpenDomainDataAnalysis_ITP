 THE FOREST IS BEING REORGANISED. OUR  
 LOCAL SECONDARY SCHOOL WILL BE KNOWN

 (1985) WITH NEW STAFF AND A NEW       
 UNIFORM BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE         
 BUILDINGS ARE NOT COMPLETE.LAKERS IS  
 MADE UP OF TWO SEPARATE SCHOOLS       
 BERRYHILL SECONDARY SCHOOL AND THE    
 ROYAL FOREST GRAMMAR SCHOOL. PART OF  
 THE OLD GRAMMAR SCHOOL IS GOING TO BE 
 A SIX FORM COLLEGE. THE NEW SCHOOL    
 UNIFORM CONSISTS OF BLACK OR GREY     
 TROUSERS OR SKIRTS, RED JUMPERS AND   
 BLACK AND RED STRIPED TIES.ALL THE    
 BOYS AND GIRLS FROM ELLWOOD SCHOOL    
 WILL GO TO THE LAKERS IN              
 FUTURE.EVENTUALLY THERE WILL BE OVER
