		<title>07TRANSPORT IN HEDON</title>
		<content> Transport is an important aspect in   
 the life of people living in Hedon    
 because most of them need to travel   
 every day.                            
 The bus service connecting{Hedon}with{
{Hull}runs between every half hour to  
 an hour.The first bus is at 7.00am and
 the last one leaves{Hull}at 11.pm. The
 journey takes about 30 minutes.There  
 is no Sunday service.The adult fare is
 70p and the cost for a child is 38p.  
 Most people who need to travel to {   
{Hull}and other places to work use     
 their cars.This results in long lines 
 of cars leaving{Hedon}and a stream of 
 traffic in the evening rush hour. {   
{Hedon}has a one way system to try and 
 prevent traffic jams in the narrow    
 town streets.                         
 People have been talking about        
 building a by-pass for a number of    
 years.                                </content>
