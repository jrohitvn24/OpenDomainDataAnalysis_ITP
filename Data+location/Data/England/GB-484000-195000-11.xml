		<content>    There is a nucleus in all villages 
of houses built before 1939.But the    
builing boom in housing began here in  
the late 1950s,accelerated in the '60s 
&amp; 70's but has slowed down as available
building land has become scarcer.The   
improvement in roads,especially the    
building of the M40, has made this a   
desirable commuter area.               
    In a survey of 175 houses two      
thirds are on planned estates and more 
than 90% are owner-occupied.Almost a   
half are detached,35% are semi-detached
and 18% are terraced houses.78% of the 
houses have either 7,8 or 9 rooms,some 
newer ones incorporating 2 bathrooms   
and 2 garages.Many are built as open-  
plan estates,though some owners have   
planted hedges,following the older     
trend to have more privacy.            
    Possibly more land will be released
for housing in the near future.        </content>
