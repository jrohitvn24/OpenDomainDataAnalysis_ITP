		<title>06FARMING: CROPS</title>
		<content> The farms in this area are fairly     
 small. There are parts of 15 farms in 
 this block (though only parts of one  
 or two fields in some cases). Most of 
 the block is shared by eight farms.   
  The farmland is mainly arable, with  
 cereals predominant. A{Little Bytham  
 farm (not entirely within this block) 
 has 319 acres of wheat (appropriately 
 named Norman and Longbow), 54 winter  
 barley, 8 spring barley, 20 oilseed   
 rape and 11 acres of grass.           
  A{Careby}farm has 57 acres of winter 
 barley, 31 oilseed rape, 30 of field  
 beans, 64 spring wheat for bread-     
 making, 140 winter wheat (some for    
 bread and some for feed), a 3 acre    
 grass paddock and 3 acres devoted to a
 nursery for garden plants.            
  Small quantities of potatoes, maize, 
 sugar beet and kale are grown in the  
 area. Another nursery covers 10 acres.</content>
