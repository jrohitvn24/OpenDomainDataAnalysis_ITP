		<content> Tholthorpe village is built along both
 sides of the main street, one side of 
 the back lane and around the green    
 which has a pond in the middle.  This 
 is fed from a spring.  The water is   
 rich in nutrients and supports        
 numerous plants, fungae, fish and     
 frogs.  Eugleane Sangunea, the most   
 dramatic fungus responds to sunshine  
 by changing from bright green to red. 
 The undulating land in the area, a    
 terinae moraine, varies from a very   
 light sand which is sometimes blown   
 byy the strong springtime winds to a  
 silty clay prone to water logging.    
 Hedgerow trees are mainly Oak, Ash, &amp; 
 Sycamore.  Hawthorne, Blackthorne,    
 Elderberry, Wild rose &amp; Bramble form  
 the hedges.  Alder &amp; Willow are common
 along the beckside and together with  
 reeds, rushes, willowherb &amp; grasses   
 create a habitat for fowes, rabbits,  </content>
