		<title>01The Winster area</title>
		<content> This valley in the centre of the area 
 is a predominately rural land, with   
 one small township called Winster. Two
 rivers flow through it from North to  
 South, the Winster and the Gilpin, and
 there are several tarns, springs and  
 wells. The terrain is mixed woodland  
 and grass divided by stone walls and a
 few hedges. There are guest houses,   
 one public house, bed and breakfast   
 houses and self-catering accomodation 
 and holiday homes. The population of  
 the whole area is estimated at 500,   
 but not enough young children for ther
 to be a primary school. It is an ideal
 place for leisure, natural history    
 pursuits  but there are no houses for 
 young people, no work and no public   
 transport, which reduces it to farming
 and holidays, with one shop, one      
 village hall and one public house.
