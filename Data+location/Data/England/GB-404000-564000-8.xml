		<title>08LOCAL HISTORY OF AREA</title>
		<content> THIS IS A VERY HISTORIC AREA WITH MUCH
 OF IT LYING ALONG THE ROUTE OF {      
{HADRIANS WALL }MANY OF THE FARM       
 BUILDINGS AND WALLS ARE MADE FROM     
 ROMAN STONES,BECAUSE IT WAS READILY   
 AVAILABLE AND ALREADY CUT TO THE RIGHT
 SIZE AND SHAPE.THIS IS ONE REASON WHY 
 SO LITTLE OF THE WALL REMAINS TODAY.  
 THERE ARE TWO RUINS IN THE AREA,ONE A 
 MILL AND THE OTHER OF LONKINS HALL.   
 A {LEGEND }EXISTS ABOUT {WHITTLE DENE}
 WHICH STATES THAT DURING THE {JACOBITE
{UPRISINGS OF 1715 OR 1745 }A NOBLEMAN 
 HID THE FAMILYS JEWELS AND TREASURES  
 IN THE STREAM WITHOUT TELLING HIS     
 FAMILY WHERE THEY WERE.UNFORTUNATELY  
 FOR THEM HE NEVER RETURNED FROM THE   
 FIGHTING AND THE JEWELS  ARE STILL    
 SEARCHED FOR TODAY,MAINLY BY SMALL    
 BOYS.
