		<title>08The Kennels, Exford.</title>
		<content> The Devon and Somerset Staghounds     
 moved to Exford in 1875.The huntsman  
 is in charge of the Kennels where all 
 the hounds are kept. He has about 70  
 couples,he knows them all individually
 and they come when he calls their     
 name.Local farmers give carcases (cows
 struck by lightning etc.)to feed the  
 hounds flesh and otherwise they eat a 
 pudding made from cereals and fat.The 
 puppies are looked after by hunt      
 supporters until they are old enough  
 to be trained.This is done by the     
 huntsman and requires a lot of time   
 and patience.When the hounds get older
 their feet flatten and they           
 cannot keep up with the pack.They make
 a babbling sound which is an attempt  
 to keep the young ones back,so then   
 they are not allowed to hunt anymore.
