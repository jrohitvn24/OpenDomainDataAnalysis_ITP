 The Sun Inn, at the top of The Peth,  
 where the Rendezvous Cafe is now, and 
 at the other side of the archway The  
 Royal Arms.The Wheatsheaf was there   
 and next door,facing the Market Place 
 was the Seven Stars.On the corner of  
 Ramsey's Lane(Strangeways Shop) was   
 The White Horse and on the site of    
 Bryson's the bakers was yet another   
 inn. The Anchor Inn is an original    
 Wooler establishment.                 
    Most of the inns were supplied by  
 the Coldstream Brewery plus the local 
 ale from the St.Magnus Brewery in     
 Brewery Lane.The latter is now a      
 social club.Today there is also The   
 Black Bull,the Red Lion,the           
 Tankerville Hotel and the Ryecroft    
 Hotel.
