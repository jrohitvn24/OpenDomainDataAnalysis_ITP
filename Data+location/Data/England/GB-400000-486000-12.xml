		<title>12FARMING IN WENSLEYDALE</title>
		<content> Douglas started farming in 1956 and he
 has seen many changes. When he began, 
 heavy horses were used in this area;  
 now there are no horses. He has three 
 4-wheel drive tractors. Silage has    
 changed winter feeding; the self-feed 
 silage face saves a lot of work. Stone
 field barns are typical of our area;  
 they were used until recently for     
 storing hay and for milking. Cows were
 milked by hand and milk was carried in
 back-cans to churns near the farm     
 entrance. The churns were emptied     
 daily by the Creamery. Now many of the
 barns are unused and are becoming     
 derelict. There are suggestions of    
 converting some barns into homes.One  
 of the greatest recent changes is in  
 farm buildings which are now clustered
 around the farmhouse.The milking is   
 done by machine in milking-parlours   
  and is piped untouched into a tank.  </content>
