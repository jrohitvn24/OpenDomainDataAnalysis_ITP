 the breakfast of toast and marmalade  
 for the family, before going to work  
 in Horticulture. He takes me to school
 at 0845.My Mummy does the housework,  
 washing and shopping and looks after  
 my baby sister.On two evenings a week 
 I go to gymnastics and brownies.Daddy 
 plays with us in the evenings then he 
 does gardening or sleeps in front of  
 the television.On Sundays Mummy makes 
 the breakfast then she washes and     
 dresses my baby sister before we both 
 play with my friend who lives         
 opposite.Mummy cooks the lunch which  
 is usually chicken.Daddy takes        
 Grandma to church.After lunch we all  
 go to Appledram stables where I go    
 horse riding.Later we visit our       
 cousins,go walking,or sometimes we    
 have a picnic.
