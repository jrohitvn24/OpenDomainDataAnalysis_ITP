		<title>02The Kielder Forest Drive</title>
		<content> The Kielder Forest Drive is a toll    
 road connecting Kielder village with  
 the A68 road just south of{Byrness}.  
 The eastern end of the Drive is at {  
{Blakehopeburnhaugh}(the longest place 
 name in England).                     
 The toll for the drive is 50p, and the
 road is open to the public from Easter
 to September, or later if you are     
 lucky! The Forestry Commission have   
 made the journey through the forest   
 most interesting by the siting of     
 picnic spots,walks and trails, as well
 as explanatory descriptions of trees  
 planted and the various stages of     
 maturity reached.                     
 Those fortunate to traverse the route 
 in quieter times of the year may      
 disturb roe deer on or by the road.   
 There is a speed limit of 25mph, and a
 lot of potholes to enforce it!
