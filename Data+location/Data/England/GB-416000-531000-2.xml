		<content> Although the North East is regarded   
 as an unemployment blackspot,we found 
 that relatively few people in our     
 block were unemployed.In the 1981     
 Census 9.2% of people were            
 unemployed.In this rural area there is
 not a lot of industry.Although farming
 is carried out, few people actually   
 work on the farms due to improved     
 farming techniques and advanced       
 machinery.There has always been a     
 strong tradition of mining in the     
 block, but since the mines closed down
 in the 1920s and 1930s the miners and 
 their descendants have had to learn   
 new skills and travel to nearby towns 
 for work.There is no longer one main  
 occupation but a general range of jobs
 eg factory workers,joiners,nurses,    
 electricians,bricklayers,farmers and  
 Waterboard workers.
