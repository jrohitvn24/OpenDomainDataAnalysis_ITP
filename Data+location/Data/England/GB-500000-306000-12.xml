 The state primary schools are:        
 Bluecoat County Primary, Malcolm      
 sargent C.P., St Georges C of E, St   
 Gilberts C of E, St Augustines R.C.   
 The state Secondary moderns are: Fane,
 Exeter.                               
 The independent schools are Stamford  
 School, Stamford High School and      
 Priory College.                       
 At present all the junior schools have
 11 plus exams from which 90 children  
 from the local area are selected to   
 take up county bought places at the   
 two endowned schools, Stamford School 
 and Stamford High School. Falling     
 rolls in the area have meant that     
 there are no longer enough children to
 fill the two secondary modern schools.
 A task force has been set up to       
 resolve this problem                  </content>
