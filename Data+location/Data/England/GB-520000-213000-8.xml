		<title>08TRADE IN WELWYN GARDEN CITY</title>
		<content> Trade in Welwyn Garden City is very   
 good.  In the town centre there is a  
 great variety of shops.  Some are     
 small businesses but there is also a  
 large department store belonging to   
 John Lewis.  It is a large shop       
 containing a sports department, a toy 
 department, a clothes department for  
 children and separate departments for 
 men and women's clothes, as well as   
 a branch of Miss Selfridge.  Other    
 shops which sell clothes include      
 Dorothy Perkins, Burtons, Fosters     
 Menswear and Stadium Sports.  Lots of 
 people shop in Welwyn Garden City and 
 so they need money.  In our area there
 are branches of three banks, Barclays,
 National Westminster and Lloyds, and  
 two Building Societies, Nationwide and
 the Woolwich.
