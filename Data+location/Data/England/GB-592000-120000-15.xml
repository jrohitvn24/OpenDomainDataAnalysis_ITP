		<title>15Pubs,Inns and Clubs in Rye</title>
		<content>  Rye has a great number of pubs for   
 such a small area. Most of them date  
 back in history and some have secret  
 passageways which were used by        
 smugglers. One pub called the Hope and
 Anchor has a tunnel going down to the 
 Strand, which smugglers used to       
 smuggle brandy through. The Mermaid   
 Inn has an upstairs floor where the   
 famous Hawkhurst Gang used to meet.   
  There are also a very large range of 
 clubs_for Brownies, Cubs and Camera   
 Enthusiasts and the Friends of Rye Art
 Gallery. There are the well known Rye 
 Singers who give marvellous concerts. 
 There are clubs for Drama and Nature  
 Conservation. With sports clubs and   
 two Women's Institutes plus many      
 others, everyone should find something
 to suit them.
