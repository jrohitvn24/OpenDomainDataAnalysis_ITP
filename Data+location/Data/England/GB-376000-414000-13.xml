		<title>13DEFENCE IN HAWKSHAW</title>
		<content> Occupying a large area of upland      
 grassland to the north of Hawkshaw is 
 the{Holcombe Moor Training Camp.}This 
 is owned by the{Ministry of Defence  }
 and is used for the training of the   
 armed forces. The camp has barracks,  
 firing ranges and an{assault course.} 
 This assault course has national fame 
 in that it is used in the T.V. quiz-  
 The Krypton Factor; were contestants  
 have to complete the demanding course 
 in record time.                       
 The Ministry of Defence has recently  
 bought another 70 hectares of land    
 adjacent to the camp. Local residents 
 in Hawkshaw are pleased about this as 
 it will mean that the land will not be
 used for property development and     
 hence the semi-rural nature of the    
 area will be maintained.              
 The{landscape}of the area is ideal for
 the training of troops.               </content>
