		<title>06A HOUSING SURVEY</title>
		<content> Housing in the Acton area.            
                                       
 The housing type, size and ownership  
 patterns are very mixed. Semi-detached
 is numerically the most important, but
 there are many terraced houses and    
 flats and maisonettes in the area,    
 plus some which are detached and some 
 which are bungalows.                  
                                       
 Most of the semi-detached houses are  
 inter-war, and of mock tudor design.  
 The terraced houses are mostly pre    
 1914 and are near the centre of Acton,
 although some are modern.             
                                       
 Flats and maisonettes include large   
 pre 1914 subdivided houses and the    
 post 1960 tower blocks of the South   
 Acton Estate
