		<title>08FAILAND FARM</title>
		<content> In Failand there is a farm at the     
 bottom of a valley.There is a mud     
 track leading and going from it.There 
 were a lot of buildings which         
 contained machinery such as tractors, 
 or animals, but the main farm house   
 was on the top right corner and was   
 built of stone.The animals were       
 allowed to roam free.The cows were    
 leaving little messages all over the  
 place.There was a manure dump covered 
 over with black plastic sheets        
 weighted down with old car tyres.The  
 farmer told us a story about two      
 peahens he had that both were eaten by
 foxes.A lot of the machinery was left 
 lying around the farm.There was a     
 sheep dog which was not very happy    
 with our arrival.
