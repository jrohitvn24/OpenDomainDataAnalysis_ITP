		<title>19FAMILY LIFE IN EDENBRIDGE</title>
		<content>     The average number of children    
 per family is between two and three,  
 with about a two year gap between     
 them. Most fathers work and most mums 
 have a part_time job. Children usually
 leave home at about twenty. Each      
 family usually has a car though       
 some have more, and it is accepted    
 that each household will have such    
 things as a television, radio, stereo,
 fridge, cooker and a washing machine. 
 Such things as computers, video       
 recorders and microwave ovens are not 
 as commonplace. Much of the housing in
 the town is council_owned but the     
 residents do have the option of       
 purchasing their property. Most people
 prefer to do their weekly shop at the 
 bigger towns of East Grinstead,       
 Tunbridge Wells or Oxted as facilities
 are better....by Sally Le'Avy.
