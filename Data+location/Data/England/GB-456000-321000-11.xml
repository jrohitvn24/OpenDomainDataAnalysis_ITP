		<content>    Domesticated ducks have been       
 "released" on the banks of the River  
 Soar, at and near Barrow-Upon-Soar:   
 new Mallard cross breeds have         
 established themselves including      
 Aylesbury ond Khaki-Campbell mixtures.
    The Barn Owl is becoming scarce in 
 this area as old farm buildings are   
 being demolished and are replaced by  
 Dutch Barns. Tawny Owls and Little    
 Owls are also affected. Kestrels are  
 common but Sparrowhawks and other     
 hunters are rare : the wide use of    
 insecticides is one of the factors in 
 their demise, chemicals are taken in  
 through the food chain and infertile  
 eggs result.
