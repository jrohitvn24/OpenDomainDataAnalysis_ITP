		<title>14Local Superstition</title>
		<content> True Portlanders are very             
 superstitious about saying "rabbits". 
 Never will a Portlander say this, they
 call them bunnies, long ears,         
 bobtails, furry things, wuffers,      
 underground mutton or wilfreds.       
 The superstition about rabbits is that
 a long time ago the rabbits were so   
 numerous that their burrowing in the  
 quarries used to cause landslides     
 which lead to men being injured or    
 killed.  The superstition is so strong
 that some people would turn around and
 go home again if they saw a bunny when
 on their way to work.  Other          
 Portlanders have been known to take to
 their beds because the word "rabbit"  
 was said in their house.  Some        
 fishermen will not go to sea for the  
 same reason.
