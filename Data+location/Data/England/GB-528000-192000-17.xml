		<content> Close to our school there is a road   
 called High Road. This usually means  
 the main road, but when the           
 redevelopment of the council estate   
 took place the main road was re_sited 
 and is now called Station Road. The   
 old High Road is still there with some
 of the original buildings and new ones
 added.                                
 Redevelopment is still taking place.  
 The old 'pub' The Northern Star still 
 stands in its original position. There
 is a new public house the John        
 Lawrence which stands on the site of  
 the original of the same name.
