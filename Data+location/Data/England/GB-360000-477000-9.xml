		<title>09TRANSPORT IN THE KIRKBY AREA</title>
		<content> Transport facilities in the Kirkby    
 area are poor.There was once a{railway
 line with a station near Cowan Bridge 
 but it closed to passenger traffic    
 many years ago and is now completely  
 disused.There are only two regular{bus
{services}each day;one goes between    
 Sedbergh and Kendal;and the other to  
 Lancaster,each catering for the school
 children.In summer a coach comes from 
 the Morecambe area on market days.A   
 car is essential as a means of        
 transport and this intensifies traffic
 problems.A{by-pass}was built to the   
 town in the 1920s.Many of the         
 surrounding{roads and lanes}are narrow
 ,only suitable for one vehicle and in 
 summer virtually overgrown.A few      
 people ride{horses}for pleasure but   
 none are used on the farms for        
 agricultural purposes.                
                                       </content>
