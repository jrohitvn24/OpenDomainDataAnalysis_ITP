		<title>09A Warden's Day</title>
		<content>   The Warden lives in a lodge at one  
 of the two official entrances to the  
 Park.  The Park usually opens at 8 am 
 and closes at dusk, however, due to   
 the size of the area it is impossible 
 to keep people out of the Park outside
 of these times.Providing they are not 
 causing damage to the plant life or   
 wildlife then it tends to be accepted 
 that people can walk or jog through   
 the Park early in the morning or late 
 at night.                             
   There are many jobs to do during the
 day such as repairing paths and       
 fencing, carrying counts of wildlife, 
 checking the level of water in the    
 lake and showing organised parties of 
 visitors around.                      
  The warden often patrols in the      
 middle of the night with his two huge 
 dogs. This is definitely not a nine to
 five job.                             </content>
