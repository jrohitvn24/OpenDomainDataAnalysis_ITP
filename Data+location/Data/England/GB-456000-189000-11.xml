		<title>11My Dad's a Postman.</title>
		<content>My Dad work for the Post Office in     
Wallingford. He starts work at 4.10 in 
the morning. First he sorts the letter 
which have arrived in a van from       
Oxford. This sorts  the mail into 24   
different rounds. He next takes the    
letters for his round from the sorting 
frame and puts them into the order of  
the houses on his round. He then       
delivers the mail by walking, cycling  
or by van.                             
The number of houses on each round     
varies between 300 or 600 depending on 
whether it is a town or rural route.   
The number of letters can vary too,    
from 250 to 1000. After the first      
delivery he goes back to the sorting   
office ready for the second delivery.  
Sometimes he finishes at 10.30 and at  
other times it can be 2.00pm and he    
does this for 6 days each week.
