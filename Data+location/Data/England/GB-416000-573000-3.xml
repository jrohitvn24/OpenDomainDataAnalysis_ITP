		<title>03A Ponteland Boy - David</title>
		<content> I am a boy who was born in 1975 which 
 makes me nine years old.I have a      
 sister called Sarah who is seven.I    
 live in the village of Ponteland near 
 Newcastle upon Tyne.My motheris a     
 social worker and my father is a      
 teacher.On Saturday I like to go to   
 the city with my mother and we look   
 round the big shops called department 
 stores.My father likes to play golf,I 
 am interested too.I enjoy swimming but
 there is not a swimming pool in       
 Ponteland we hope to have one         
 soon.The local newspaper is called the
 Ponteland Observer.In this you can    
 read about local news,sports events   
 and farming.Ihave about three hundred 
 books because I enjoy reading a lot.On
 a Sunday I like to help in the garden 
 and if is raining I will do some      
 drawing or write stories which I      
 illustrate as well.                   </content>
