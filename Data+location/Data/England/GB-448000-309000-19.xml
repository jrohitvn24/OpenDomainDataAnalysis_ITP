		<title>19FARMING NEAR  MARKFIELD</title>
		<content> My dad gets up at 5a.m. He puts on his
 overalls.He goes into the kitchen and 
 makes himself some coffee.His wellies 
 have been next to the radiator so they
 are nice and warm to put on.The cows  
 are waiting for him outside.They go   
 into a barn and some go through to be 
 milked. The cows' udders are washed.  
 When the cows have been milked the    
 pigs are fed on scraps and pig food.  
 My dad then goes in for his           
 breakfast.In the winter he must clean 
 out the animals between the milking   
 and his dinner. In the summer he would
 do some combining or some             
 silaging.After dinner he would carry  
 on with his silaging which would take 
 up to 7p.m.A helper does the evening  
 milking. My dad is very tired then and
 he comes in for his tea and a rest.
