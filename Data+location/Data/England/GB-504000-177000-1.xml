		<content> This Domeday Survey block is in the   
 far west corner of Greater London.Most
 of it lies within the Borough of      
 Hillingdon.                           
     The block is divided into two     
 distinct halves by the M 4 Motorway   
 which takes traffic from London to the
 West of the country. North of the     
 motorway lies the busy town of West   
 Drayton, often congested with traffic 
 making its way to and from Heathrow   
 Airport just south of the block. South
 of the M 4 lie the quiet villages of  
 Harmondsworth and Sipson. Gravel      
 extraction is the major industry of   
 this area, while farming is still of  
 great importance.                     
     Transport is a major theme. The   
 new M 25 motorway will be open in late
 1985 to add to the M 4, the Great     
 Western Railway and the edge of       
 Heathrow airport - all in the block.  </content>
