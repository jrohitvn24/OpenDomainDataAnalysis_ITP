		<content>    Victoria Road is the main street in
 Whetstone.There are a few shops,houses
 and some pubs.Behind Victoria Road    
 there is  a lot of houses,some modern 
 and some old.It is a quiet place.There
 are only two bus stops.There are no   
 doctors or dentists in Whetstone.     
 Whetstone looks a bit dull.There are  
 quite a few factories,but not much    
 else.                                 
    We asked a few locals about what   
 they thought of their village,and most
 were dissatisfied with the facilities 
 there were.Many of the inhabitants use
 the large neighbouring village of     
 Blaby for shopping.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
