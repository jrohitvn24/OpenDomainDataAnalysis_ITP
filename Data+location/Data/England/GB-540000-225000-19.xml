		<title>19NARROW ROADS</title>
		<content>  The roads are very narrow often with 
 high banks. The long grass is no      
 longer cut by the council and it is   
 difficult to see round the corners and
 there are many bumps between cars.It  
 is difficult to find the way as roads 
 are not always signposted and houses  
 just have a name and no other details.
  In winter the roads are quickly      
 blocked during snowfalls particularly 
 where the snow blows across the fields
 and there are no hedges.              
  Farm tractors try to keep roads open 
 but it is not always possible and     
 sometimes the roads become impassable 
 and then the school is closed.        
 Sometimes it snows heavily during the 
 day and then every one rushes home    
 when the day is finished.
