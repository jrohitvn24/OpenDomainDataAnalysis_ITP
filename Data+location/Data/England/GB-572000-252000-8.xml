		<title>08WICKHAMBROOK CHURCH AREA</title>
		<content>The Church dates from the 12th century.
It is well preserved and well kept,    
with a congregation of about 50 on     
Sunday (Family Eucharist).  A small    
Parish Room is next door and this is   
used not only for Church events but    
for Parish Council Meetings.           
The Old Vicarage is now a private      
house and the Vicar lives in a modern  
vicarage.                              
Two Almshouses provided by Thomas      
Sparrow are still lived in.  The       
building is well thatched with Norfolk 
Reed.   Originally the Trust stated    
that 12 people should live in this     
accommodation.   The White House, now  
a Doctor's home, was formerly a pub.   
Along the road towards the A143 is the 
Manor House which has fine chimneys.
