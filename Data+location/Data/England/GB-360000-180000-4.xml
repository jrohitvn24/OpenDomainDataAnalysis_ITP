		<title>04NEW STADIUM AT STOKE GIFFORD</title>
		<content>    There are plans for a new sports   
 complex to act as a regional centre.  
 Sport 2000 want a sports stadium with 
 15000 seats for athletics,greyhound   
 racing and a pitch for Bristol Rovers 
 FC. Also they want a covered tennis   
 school and club with coaching for     
 hockey and cricket,and a sports hall  
 for martial arts,basketball etc.      
   They want to build here because it  
 is close to Parkway station, and the  
 M4 and M5 motorways. It's also very   
 much cheaper land.                    
   The local people are against it     
 because of noise,vandals damaging     
 property, heavy traffic and lower     
 house prices. They sent 649 letters of
 complaint to the planning committee.  
   Local people are now forming        
 petitions,action groups are writing to
 local MP's. A Q.C. will fight their   
 case in the Courts.                   </content>
