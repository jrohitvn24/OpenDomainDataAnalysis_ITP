		<content> In our area {Blantyre/Bothwell}we     
 found that just over 50% of the people
 own cars. These were not concentrated 
 in a single area and fairly evenly    
 spread. Somewhat surprisingly less    
 than 1% own motorcycles, and over 40% 
 own bicycles.                         
                                       
 In{Blantyre}there is a train and taxi 
 station, and several bus services form
 a network across the entire area. The 
 majority of people use public         
 transport quite regularly and the bus 
 seems to be the most popular. Most    
 people find public transport in       
 general too expensive. Judging from   
 most peoples responses, bus services  
 in our area are the most reliable form
 of transport.
