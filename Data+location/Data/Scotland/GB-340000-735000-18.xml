		<title>18TEALING AIRFIELD</title>
		<content> No.56 Operational Training Unit was   
 moved from Sutton Bridge to Tealing in
 March 1942. Hurricanes, Masters and   
 some Lysanders were used for pilot    
 training. Later in the war the unit   
 was reorganised into the chain of     
 Tactical Exercise Units and often     
 played host to larger aircraft such as
 Dakotas. The Hurricanes (veterans of  
 the Battle of Britain) were replaced  
 by Spitfires. In May 1942 a Russian   
 TB-7 bomber landed at Tealing carrying
 the Russian Foreign Minister Molotov  
 on a top secret mission. The site is  
 not ideal for an airfield being a     
 frost and fog hollow and during the   
 war the hills to the NW made night    
 flying impossible. This may in part   
 explain why it was not chosen as the  
 site for Dundee Airport. The airfield 
 was closed in 1945 and electricity    
 power cables cross the area now.      </content>
