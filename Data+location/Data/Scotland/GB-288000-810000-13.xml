		<title>13CHANGING TIMES CONTINUED</title>
		<content> Little change followed until the      
{Beeching Cuts }of the early 60s,many  
 railway employees lost their jobs.    
 Fortunately this co-incided with the  
 development of ski-ing on a large     
 scale in the Cairngorm Mountains and  
 the subsequent opening of hotels at   
{Coylumbridge }and{Aviemore Centre.    
 Much employment,for both men and women
 was created.Since then, Aviemore has  
 expanded rapidly,many new shops,      
 houses,restaurants,pubs and leisure   
 facilities have been built to cater   
 for the all year round tourist trade. 
 Some of the older,{local residents    
 who we interviewed during our survey  
 are of the opinion that the village   
 was better as it used to be,quiet and 
 peaceful,everyone knowing everyone    
 else.Most however are happy to accept 
 the changes which progress and        
 development have brought.             </content>
