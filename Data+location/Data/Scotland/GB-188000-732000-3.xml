		<title>03CONNEL BRIDGE,CONNEL</title>
		<content> This bridge was built during the years
 1900 and 1903, when Queen Victoria was
 reigning.She died before completion of
 it.It is a cantilever type and is made
 of metal.Cecil Booth,the engineer who 
 supervised the work,later became known
 as the inventor of the vacuum cleaner.
 It used to be a road and railway      
 bridge,but in 1966 when the trains no 
 longer travelled from Oban to         
 Ballachulish,the rails were lifted and
 it became a road bridge.It is single  
 track and traffic is controlled by    
 lights.They are now automatically     
 controlled.The maximum height for     
 vehicles crossing is 13".All boats    
 which sail down Loch Etive have to be 
 small enough to pass under the bridge.
 Every five years the bridge is painted
 and repaired.
