		<content>{Question}What time do you get up in   
 the morning?                          
{Answer}Sometimes it's half past six   
 but if I'm gathering it's four o'clock
 because if you go in the afternoon you
 would get very hot and tired and so   
 would the dogs and the sheep.I        
 sometimes have two breakfasts,one     
 before I go out and one when I come   
 in.                                   
{Question}How do you feel about        
 climbing hills                        
{Answer}I usually like to get a lift up
 now Ha Ha Ha.It's a steep climb from  
 sea level to over 3000 feet. Sometimes
 you can't manage a vehicle in some    
 places and you have to walk to each   
 hirsel.There's too many trees now and 
 fewer sheep.There's fewer deer as well
 because of the plantations.There's big
 money for investment in trees and they
 get the preference.                   </content>
