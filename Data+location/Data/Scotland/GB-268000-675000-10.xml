		<content>     We were talking to Mr Paton,the   
 manager of Nuttall's. It was built in 
 1972 at Kilsyth because of it's       
 location in relation to the motorways 
 and trunk road systems.               
     They employ 35 workers at their   
 Kilsyth depot, one of whom is a lorry 
 driver.                               
     Mr Paton told us they built       
 bridges, tunnels, dams, roads and     
 hydro-electric schemes all over the   
 world. Scottish projects Nuttall's    
 have worked on include Friars Bridge, 
 Inverness, Camphill Reservoir,        
 Strathclyde and an aircraft servicing 
 platform.                             
     They have had many awards,among   
 them a Saltire award for the South    
 Ford Causeway in Benbecula.           
     Just now they are working on      
 thirteen different contracts.
