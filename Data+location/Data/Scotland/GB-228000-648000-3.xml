		<content>{The Garnock Valley Task Force}was set 
 up to alleviate the increased         
 unemployment problem caused by the    
 closure of Glengarnock steel works. In
 its 5 years, more than 150 projects   
 were assisted and over 1500 new jobs  
 created, with a projected expansion to
 over 2800 by March '86.               
{The Development Executive}took over, a
 year ago, consisting of a consortium  
 of financial institutions, British    
 Steel, S.D.A. and Local and Regional  
 Authorities. 42 projects have been    
 helped, with a new job potential of   
 168. Aid is offered to set up or      
 expand businesses in Dalry, Beith or  
 Kilbirnie.                            
 As a special development area,        
 attractive financial packages and a   
 wide range of premises are available. 
 Companies training people who are     
 unemployed qualify for generous grants</content>
