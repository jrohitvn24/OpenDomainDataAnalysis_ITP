		<title>01General review Papa Westray</title>
		<content> The island of Papa Westray is one of  
 the most Northerly of the Orkneys.It  
 has a population of 80 in 1985. The   
 North end of the island is an R.S.P.B.
 bird reserve and contains the largest 
 piece of maritime heath left in the   
 islands.                              
  There are many archaeological sites, 
 the main one of which is the Knap of  
 Howar which dates from about 3500B.C. 
  The main occupation is farming, both 
 beef cattle and sheep.There is also   
 some crab and lobster fishing and     
 building. The services include a      
 general store, post office, hostel and
 guest house.                          
  The island has a resident teacher and
 nurse but shares a minister and doctor
 with the neighbouring island of       
 Westray.Transport is by both boat and 
 plane from Kirkwall on the Orkney     
 mainland.                             </content>
