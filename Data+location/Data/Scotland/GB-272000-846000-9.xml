 Culloden, Culloden Moor and Balloch.  
 She has a car with her job.The nurse  
 uses the Culloden Clinic for people   
 to phone and make appointments to see 
 her.She visits about 14 people a day. 
 The nurse has no employees to help    
 her with her daily work.She does a lot
 of house visits.The doctor at the     
 Clinic informs her to visit a certain 
 patient who is needing help. The      
 duties of her work are dressings,     
 bathings, injections etc.The people   
 she visits are mostly babies.If there 
 is anything that is too serious she   
 gets them straight to hospital or they
 just phone their doctor and send for  
 an ambulance.
