		<title>19KILMARNOCK IN 2086</title>
		<content> This is what I think life will be like
 in 2086. People will have a           
 computerised home. E.g. a control     
 button to lock doors and windows.     
 Crime will grow at an alarming rate.  
 People will have lazer lights across  
 doors and windows to prevent          
 burglaries. Vandalism will be worse   
 and I think there will be much more   
 spray paint over the walls. More      
 people will be divorced and more      
 children will be taken into care.     
 People will travel in cars which have 
 videos and push buttons for food. The 
 5p coin will have disappeared. Roads  
 will be much bigger. There will be    
 a lot more pollution. I think 2086    
 will be worse than 1986.
