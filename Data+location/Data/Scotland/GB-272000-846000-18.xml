		<title>18GUIDES' 75th ANNIVERSARY</title>
		<content> The Guides started 75years ago and now
 in 1985 every Guide in the world is   
 celebrating the{75th}birthday. Several
 activities will be taking place. One  
 of these activities is a Candlelight  
 Ceremony. Every Guide will have a     
 candle and so will the Guide Leaders. 
 The County Commisioners will have     
 their candles lit by Guide Leaders    
 even higher up and they will light    
 all the Guides in the worlds candles. 
 At the ceremony there will be a'Penny 
 Fayre' where lots of games are played 
 and you pay a penny to play them.     
 Every Guide Company in the world, will
 be having a Birthday Party. At the    
 parties the Guides and Brownies will  
 be entertaining Parents and Friends.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
