		<content>       Damhead is a hill farm of one   
 hundred and sixty acres. It has been  
 farmed by the Robson family for twelve
 years and is a rented farm belonging  
 to the Charteris family. The farm is  
 mixed with one hundred sheep (grey and
 black faced), one hundred and twenty  
 beef cattle (Hereford,Fresian,        
 Charolais, Limousin), and cereals. The
 excess sheep and cattle are sold at   
 Lockerbie market. The cereal crop     
 grown is barley. Some of this is kept 
 for winter feeding, the surplis again 
 being sold. Much of the farmland is   
 used for either grazing or the growing
 of grass for silage (winter feeding). 
 The farm also has eleven hens which   
 provide eggs for the family.
