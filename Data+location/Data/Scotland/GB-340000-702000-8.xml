		<title>08School pupil's day.</title>
		<content> A typical weekday would involve rising
 at 7.30 am and getting ready for the  
 bus which arrives at 8.20 am, I don't 
 take breakfast as there is no time.   
 Since the population of Upper Largo is
 not large one bus goes to all the     
 stops at the surrounding villages. The
 pupils from my area either attend     
 Buckhaven or Kirkland High. I go to   
 Buckhaven as do around 20 others. The 
 bus journey takes around half an hour 
 covering about 6 or 7 miles.I arrive  
 at school at around 8.45.The morning  
 until break at 10.35 consists of going
 to classes such as French,Geography,  
 Maths and English. After break I go to
 other classes till lunch at 12.55. I  
 do not travel home for lunch as it is 
 too far but visit my Gran who lives   
 locally or have school lunches.
