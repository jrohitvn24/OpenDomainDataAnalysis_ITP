		<content>   Keepering in this area is done by   
 three keepers sharing the duties.     
   Red deer are culled; stags from     
 September to 20th October by paying   
 guests, and hinds by the keepers until
 15th February.                        
   Grouse are shot from 12th August    
 until September on the hills with     
 varying bag sizes eg 15-50 brace.     
   Pheasants here are wild bred and    
 these are shot in the woods and low   
 fields.                               
   Roe deer are shot in the woods; the 
 bucks by paying guests in June/July   
 and the does by the keepers in the    
 winter months until February.
