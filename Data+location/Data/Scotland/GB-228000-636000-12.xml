		<content> On 24-6-85 our class went for a visit 
 to the Beach Park. We went to the Trim
 Track which includes such things as   
 hurdles,vaulting,log lifting,monkey   
 bars,Tarzan ropes,maze, press up bar, 
 sit up bar,swings, a boating pond,    
 a putting green,beam walking and the  
 shows were there (but not permanently)
 The shows were very expensive _ most  
 of which were 35p for one go.Side     
 shows only cost 20p.Most of them      
 offered a prize even if you lost.     
 We went for our lunch at the boathouse
 then went to the shows.Later we went  
 into the Magnum to have a hot drink.  
 After that we went outside to have a  
 game of rounders.Mrs Armour's team got
 beaten 50-15.Then the boys played the 
 girls at football, the score was 1-0  
 to the boys.Then it was time for the  
 walk back home over the Low Green.
