		<content> There are six Primary Schools in      
 Johnstone, three of which are Roman   
 Catholic - St Anthonys, St Davids, and
 St Margarets. The remaining are all   
 non-denominational - Auchenlodment,   
 Fordbank and Cochrane Castle. The two 
 Secondary Schools are Johnstone High  
 School which is non-denominational and
 St Cuthberts which is a RC School. The
 REctor of Johnstone High feels that in
 the near future upper school pupils   
 will not only be able to sit 'O'Grades
 and Highers but also modules in the   
 vicinity of the schools. Unlike other 
 schools Johnstone High's roll is      
 likely to decline only slightly from  
 1525 in 1986 to 1350 in 1990. Apart   
 from the development of the new       
 Standard Grades to replace 'O'Grades  
 the new developments are likely to be 
 Health/Drug Education, Religious      
 Education and Computer Education      </content>
