		<title>10HISTORY OF THE RAF STATION</title>
		<content> The station was opened in 1917 for    
 several reasons; the favourable       
 situation for defending the east coast
 of Scotland, the suitability of the   
 surrounding terrain and the climte    
 which gives, (apparenty),clearer      
 skies!. The 3rd Statisical Account    
 tells us that the camp grew           
 considerably between the wars as farms
 and parts of Tentsmuir wre taken      
 over. During the 2nd World War, it was
 important as a bomber and fighter     
 station as well as a training centre. 
 Luckily it escaped any bombing and by 
 the early 1950's the proximity of the 
 station had helped to make shopkeepers
 and tradesmen in the village more     
 prosperous. Much of the communities   
 entertainment and social life is      
 closely connected with the camp       
 functions.
