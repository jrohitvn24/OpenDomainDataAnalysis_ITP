		<content> The{Loch Ness Monster }is supposed to 
 be one of the following,Gould's Giant 
 Newt,Plesiosaur,Dinsdale's            
 Monster,Holiday's Great Orm,Costello's
 Long-Necked Seal,Mackal's Giant       
 Amphibian and Scott and Rine's        
 Nessiteras rhombopteryx.Of course the 
 Monster may be none of these but      
 something completely different or it  
 may only be one of these things,a     
 rock,a seal,alog,an up turned boat or 
 an otter or something else.The monster
 (for example a plesiosaur)probably    
 would be extinct by now , so how was  
 it preserved.In the Ice Age it may    
 have been caught in the ice so it was 
 preserved in ice ,but this is only one
 explanation there could be hundreds of
 other explanations.On the other hand  
 it may not have been frozen in the    
 ice,there may be others of this kind  
 of animal,this is only one mystery.   </content>
