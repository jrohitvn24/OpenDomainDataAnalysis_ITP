		<content> Gardening is a popular outdoor        
 activity in Greenock.  There are      
 annual gardening competitions.  Each  
 area holds heats and many people take 
 part.  The winners from these heats   
 progress to a National Competition.   
 Not everyone gardens competitively,   
 many simply garden for pleasure or to 
 help the household budget.  For young 
 people play schemes are organised     
 during the summer.  These schemes take
 place in St Lawrence's School and are 
 run by the Tennants' Association.     
 They take young people for day trips  
 and also let them enter competitions. 
 This is a good opportunity to meet    
 people of the area, you can make      
 friends with children from different  
 schools.  The Wellpark is popular with
 residents. Young people play there and
 old people walk there when the weather
 is good.                              </content>
