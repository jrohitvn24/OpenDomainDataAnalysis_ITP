		<content>{FORESTRY}has been a feature of this   
 district since the Forestry Commission
 started to plant Wauchope Forest in   
 the years before World War Two. About 
 25 years ago the Forestry houses were 
 built in our block,and operations were
 directed from an office in the village
 which closed due to re-organisation   
 some two years ago.A tree nursey      
 produces young plants to establish new
 forests elsewhere.At one time there   
 were 26 forestry workers living in the
 village but now there are only 10-12. 
 A lot of Forestry work has been taken 
 over by private firms now.Most of the 
 8 000 hectares of Wauchope Forest are 
 outside our block,and Forestry workers
 in the district can be asked to go    
 further afield than previously.Wood is
 often sold to a contractor for        
 felling.
