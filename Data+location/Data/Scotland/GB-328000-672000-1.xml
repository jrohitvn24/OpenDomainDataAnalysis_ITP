		<content> Our D block covers much of{East       
{Edinburgh.}It takes in a large sector 
 of the city's{outer housing areas}_   
 Duddingston, Craigentinny, and        
 Willowbrae _ and has a resident       
 population of some 35,000. At its     
 centre is{Portobello,}an area         
 of considerable character and local   
 identity reflecting its former status 
 as a separate burgh and its growth in 
 the nineteenth century as a spa and   
 later as a popular{seaside resort.}In 
 the late 1970's parts of Portobello   
 and Duddingston village were          
 designated{Conservation Areas.}       
  Nearly 1/5 of the block is{open space
 to which there is public access,      
 notably part of{Holyrood Park, Figgate
{Burn Park}and various public golf     
 courses. Within the boundaries of     
 this parkland are{Duddingston Loch,   
{Dunsapie Loch}and the{Figgate Pond.   </content>
