		<content> OUR LOCAL SHOPPING EAST KILBRIDE      
   The St. Leonards shopping area has a
 few shops in it. These shops include  
 Safeway supermarket, Safeway wines and
 spirits, Fourbuoys newsagent/Post     
 Office, Bank of Scotland, Gemini hair 
 fashions, St. Leonards Pharmacy,      
 Muirhead butchers  and Emanuel's chip 
 shop.                                 
   There is also a library nearby and  
 the Bonnie Prince Charlie pub.        
   There are no clothes shops in the   
 shopping area. People usually go to   
 the town centre  for clothes.         
   Most people think the St. Leonards  
 shops are good for every day things   
 like food, drink, and (if needed )    
 medicines. There is usually a fish van
 that sits outside beside the car park.
   The shops are under cover which is  
 good on wet or cold days. The shops   
 are convenient for our community.     </content>
