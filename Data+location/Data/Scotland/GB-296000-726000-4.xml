		<title>04Schooling:Glenalmond College</title>
		<content> This is a totally{boarding school}with
 an average of 380 pupils.  It is      
 unique as it has a beautiful situation
 (Scottish countryside) and is within  
 one hour of four major university     
 towns.  In 1985, construction was     
 started on a design and technology    
 centre.                               
 It is{academically strong}in both arts
 and sciences as is shown by awards for
 both.  However, many extra-curricular 
 activities also take place.  It is    
 felt that these educate the 'whole    
 man'.                                 
 It also has a Combined Cadet Force,   
 which helps boys in three ways:       
 discipline, learning of new skills and
 responsibility for junior boys.       
 Due to confusion, the postal address  
 of Trinity College Glenalmond has been
 changed to Glenalmond College, but    
 remains the above officialy.          </content>
