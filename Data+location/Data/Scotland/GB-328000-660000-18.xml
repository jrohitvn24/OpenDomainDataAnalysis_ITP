		<content>   The two settlements are so different
 in social and economic character that 
 it is not surprising to find          
 contrasting views among their         
 inhabitants.                          
   In Carrington,the major concern     
 centres on the recent closure of the  
 Primary School because the roll of the
 one teacher school had fallen to 2    
 pupils. The nearest primary school is 
 in the neighbouring village of        
 Temple,a mere 1.3 miles (2.1km) away  
 by direct road. This was acceptable   
 but the Lothiam Region has failed to  
 make safe a bridge on that road, and a
 diversion involving 5.3 miles (8.5km) 
 now adds considerably to the journey  
 time between the two villages, not to 
 mention cost and inconvenience. Also, 
 since the school closure, families    
 have moved into Carrington and there  
 are now 10 pre-school children.       </content>
