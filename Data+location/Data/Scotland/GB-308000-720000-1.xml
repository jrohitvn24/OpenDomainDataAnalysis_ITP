		<title>01Beautiful South-West Perth.</title>
		<content>  The{south-west of Perth}is very      
 attractive having a wide variety of   
 geographical features, including      
 rolling farmland, woodland, hills and 
 valleys. Our area is bounded by the{  
{River Tay}in the east and the{River   
{Earn}to the south. From the highest   
 point can be seen some excellent      
 recreational facilities, namely the{  
{Inch}(a spacious tree-lined park),    
 bowling greens, tennis courts, golf   
 course and a large pitch and putt     
 course. The buildings in this area are
 mainly residential; modern and old    
 blending together. The imposing prison
 was built during the{Napoleonic Wars. 
  Thousands of{tourists}who drive north
 along the Edinburgh Road or the {M90},
 must gain a favourable impression as  
 their journey through the {Scottish   
{Highlands}begins.
