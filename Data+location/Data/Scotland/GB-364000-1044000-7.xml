		<title>07MAMMALS</title>
		<content> In our area there are many different  
 species of wild mammals.The most      
 obvious are the{rabbits}which roam    
 around the links in their hundreds.   
 Another mammal which we see quite a   
 lot of is the{hedgehog,}but many are  
 killed in crossing the road. Hedgehogs
 were introduced less than ten years   
 ago.There are plenty of{rats}roaming  
 around; they spend most of the winter 
 in barns of straw and hay with their  
 relation, the{house mouse. Woodmice   
 and{Orkney voles}are lurking around   
 and some scientists believe that      
 Sanday has its own sub-species. There 
 are dozens of{Atlantic (grey) seals   
 and{common seals}also.They are mostly 
 found near the rocky coasts of the    
 Holms of Ire. Occasionaly{whales}are  
 seen in the shallow waters around our 
 coast.A 17-metre male{Sperm whale}was 
 stranded at Backaskaill Bay in 1984.  </content>
