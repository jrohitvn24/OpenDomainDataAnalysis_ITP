		<content>    Sorbie Creamery was built in 1891. 
 The small{industry}produced very good 
 Scottish{cheese}and butter.The nature 
 of the area was also ideal because it 
 included several {dairy farms}.Sorbie 
 creamery was awarded the Scottish     
 cheese graders trophy in 1960.        
    70 people are employed by the      
 creamery.Up to 35 {tankers}collect and
 deliver milk to the creamery,from     
 farms in Dumfries and Galloway.       
    The milk is pasteurised for 15     
 seconds at a temperature of 161       
 degrees fahrenheit  to kill off any   
 organisms.It is then cooled and forms 
 a solid substance,which is heated     
 until it curdles,and becomes cheese.  
 Salt is added to preserve it and to   
 improve its flavour. The cheese is    
 packed into blocks. The whey is spun  
 -the cream for butter, with the liquid
 being sold to pig farmers.            </content>
