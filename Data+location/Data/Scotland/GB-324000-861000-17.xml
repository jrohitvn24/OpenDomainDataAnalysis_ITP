		<title>17 FARMING_LHANBRYDE</title>
		<content>    There are different types of farms,
 mostly{mixed.}Barley,wheat and oats   
 are grown. Barley is used as cattle   
 food or to make whisky.Oats are used  
 for cattle food or making porridge.   
 Wheat is ground into flour to make    
 cakes and biscuits.                   
    Dairy farms like Barmuckity supply 
 milk to the Elgin area.               
    Small herds of cattle are kept.    
 Calves are fattened for slaughter or  
 sold for breeding.                    
    There are a few small flocks of    
 sheep bred for lamb or mutton.        
    Recently a{mushroom}farm has been  
 started at an old sawmill.They are    
 grown in long,dark polythene "tents". 
    Most farms are worked by the farmer
 and his family. They may employ       
 workers part_time or at busy times.   
 Some farms employ a contractor to lift
 the harvest.                          </content>
