		<title>08Memories Of A Grandfather.</title>
		<content>    A grandfather tells of considerable
 changes over his lifetime encompassing
 50 years.Early memories were of a     
 thriving self-sufficient, rural       
 community.Basic requirements were peat
 fuelled open fires for all cooking,   
 washing,bathing purposes until Hydro- 
 Electric arrived in the 1960's.Prior  
 to then, Paraffin &amp; later Tilley lamps
 gave light.Water was carried from     
 nearby streams or wells until the     
 luxury of indoor  cold taps  in the   
 1930's.Outside, dry  toilets were     
 housed in wooden huts until the       
 1950's.Bathing was in a zinc bath in  
 front of the fire.Flagstone floors    
 preceded cement downstairs. Chaff(corn
 husk),feather or horse hair beds      
 preceded mattresses.Wholesome diet    
 from local produce included dairy     
 products,oatmeal,potatoes,vegetables  
 &amp; meat until preserved foods appeared.</content>
