 At the top of the backroads where the 
 county depot is today there was an old
 wooden gate.This was a private gate   
 that was suppossed to be kept closed  
 but it would mysteriously swing open. 
 Some men watched the gate and at 10.30
 pm a strange old lady dressed in black
 opened the gate and went off towards  
 the school.Nobody knew why she did    
 this and she could not be followed.   
{The Mermaid                           
  One summer's day a man was sailing   
 past the island of Eilean Hoan and he 
 saw a beautiful lady sitting by the   
 water.He went a wee bit closer and,   
 as she dived into the water, he       
 realised she was a mermaid.           
{The Devil                             
 One day the Devil was seen at Smoo    
 Cave. He had cloven hooves,two horns  
 and a horse's tail                    </content>
