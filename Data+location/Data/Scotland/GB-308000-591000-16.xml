		<title>16Accident Blackspot - One</title>
		<content>   The long straight section of the A74
 which runs through Johnstonebridge is 
 regarded by many as a very dangerous  
 road. There have been many fatal      
 accidents.                            
   Many road users appear to think that
 it is Motorway, when it is only a     
 piece of Dual carriageway sandwiched  
 between the M74 to the north and the  
 M6 to the south. Because of this      
 drivers may meet slow moving traffic  
 like tractors, bicyles and pedestrians
 which they do not expect.             
   One of the major hazards is when a  
 vehicle crosses from the Northbound to
 the Southbound or vice versa. Traffic 
 may indicate turning right,so vehicles
 behind assume that the driver is going
 to overtake, when in actual fact he   
 will be slowing down to cut across the
 central reservation.
