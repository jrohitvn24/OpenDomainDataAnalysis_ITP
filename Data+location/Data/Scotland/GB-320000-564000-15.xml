		<title>15COMPUTERS,ANNAN</title>
		<content> In the past few years home computers  
 have become very popular with         
 children.In a survey carried out      
 amongst the top three classes in our  
 school it was found that more than    
 half of the children owned computers. 
 The most common type is the ZX        
 Spectrum which is cheaper than other  
 makes.                                
 We were interested in finding out what
 use was made of computers.We found    
 that nearly one half of those with    
 computers rarely use them.Those who   
 did, used them solely for playing     
 games.The most popular game at the    
 moment is"In Aid of Africa".This game 
 is being sold to raise money for      
 famine victims in Ethiopia and Sudan. 
 Will computers maintain their         
 popularity or will they be just be a  
 passing craze like skateboards and    
 hula hoops? Only time will tell.      </content>
