		<title>03PLANT LIFE ON LINKS &amp; DUNES</title>
		<content> Many plants grow behind newly built-up
 dunes where they are protected from   
 salt water and wind.Examples are      
 HARE'S FOOT CLOVER,PURPLE MILK VETCH  
 and the rare BLUE FLEABANE which only 
 grows on one other site in Scotland.  
 The links, though mowed, also contain 
 many plants. The minute CURVED SEDGE, 
 only recently discovered, is so small 
 that it is untouched when the fairways
 are mowed. In wet hollows of the      
 links,there are patches of BALTIC     
 RUSH,and in acid sandy soil HEATHER   
 thrives.(The 6th Hole of the Old      
 Course is called "Heathery" for this  
 reason).GORSE or WHIN form patches of 
 scrub around the courses, with        
 striking yellow "pea" flowers in early
 summer.  The other large bush growing 
 along the edge of the links is the    
 TREE LUPIN with its sweet- scented,   
 pale yellow flowers.                  </content>
