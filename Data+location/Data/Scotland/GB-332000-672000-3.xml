		<title>03FISHERMANS WALK</title>
		<content> Fisherrow is on the west side of the  
 River Esk.  Fisherrow was once a great
 centre of the herring industry.  The  
 fishermen in Fisherrow are still      
 active today even although their boats
 are berthed in different harbours.    
 Fisherrow is best known though for its
 annual Fishermans Walk.  They         
 celebrate this walk at the end of what
 is meant to be the end of the herring 
 season.  The fishermen wear an apron  
 over a puffed skirt which is called a 
 coat.  Then there is a blouse which is
 called a shargoon, then a brightly    
 coloured shawl.  The walk starts at   
 the Coast Mission down by Fisherrow   
 Links, then the walk progresses       
 through the town to Pinkie Playing    
 Fields where they have sports and fun.
  They return to the Coast Mission in  
 the evening, then a dance.
