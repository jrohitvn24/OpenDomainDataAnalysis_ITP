		<content> Today it is raining so my father can't
 work on the{roads,}as the rain ruins  
 the tar. He will go and repair a      
{telephone}instead,as some channels are
 off. He has to go and read electricity
 meters for the{Hydro-Board}and try to 
 find the cause of the power-cuts. He  
 should go to the{lighthouse}and{Muckle
{Skerry}today to check the equipment   
 but the sea is too rough for the boat.
                                       
 Every day{Donnie}goes to the water    
 supply at the{dam.}He checks to see if
 the water is pure and then he pumps it
 into the big green reserve tank and   
 from there into the taps of the whole 
 isle. He works at the{salmon farm}and 
 at the{lighthouse,}checking to see if 
 the light is working. He takes out his
 small boat and sets{lobster}pots and  
 he comes twice a week to teach{wood_  
{work}in the school.                   </content>
