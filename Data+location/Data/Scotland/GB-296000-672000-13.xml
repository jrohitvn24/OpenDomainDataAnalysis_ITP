		<title>13Health Service in Torphichen</title>
		<content> Torphichen suffers from a lack of     
 medical services. The village has     
 neither a doctor nor a chemist and    
 the nearest health centre is Bathgate 
 or Armadale. Every Tuesday a doctor   
 from Armadale, which is about 6 miles 
 away, comes out to the village. If    
 anyone needs him a message is left in 
 the Post Office. The doctor visits all
 the people on the list. If a          
 prescription is required it is left at
 the Post Office and then sent to the  
 chemist in Armadale. The medicine is  
 sent through the post to Torphichen   
 Post Office where it can be collected 
 on the Thursday. If a child breaks his
 arm the nearest hopital is Bangour but
 because there is not a resident       
 Paeditrician all they can do is x_ray 
 the arm, put it in a sling and send   
 the patient to Edinburgh or Leith     
 which is about 20_25 miles away.      </content>
