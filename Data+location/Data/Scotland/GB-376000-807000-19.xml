		<title>19SKENE HOUSE</title>
		<content>{Skene house}is one of the oldest      
 stone built houses still existing.The 
 square tower can still be seen amongst
 more modern building.The{walls}were{12
{feet thick}and were built,using       
 run-lime.This was done by building a  
 wall of stones,packing the outer walls
 with clay to retain the liquid lime   
 which was poured on the top of the    
 wall and ran down through the stones  
 until it came up to wall-top height.  
{Run-lime}is harder than cement and the
 combination of the 12 feet thick walls
 made for good defence from attack in  
 the troubled times of long ago.The old
 tower was built in the 12th century.  
 Much building went on at Skene house  
 in the Earl of Fife's time;the        
 Stables,Laundry and Gardens were built
 between the 1840's and the 1850's.
