		<content>   The farms of upper and lower        
 Ingliston are owned by the same family
 and are farmed as one unit.  They are 
 situated in the south easterly part   
 of our area.  They cover 250 acres and
 were bought by the Morrison family in 
 1933.  Two brothers farm the land     
 without employing any other labour.   
   The main enterprise is fattening    
 sheep although they also fatten about 
 50 cattle per year and grow nearly    
 100 acres of barley.                  
   The Messrs Morrison permanently     
 have 50 breeding ewes and 9 tups.  The
 lambs from these Suffolk and North    
 Country Cheviots are joined by 300    
 lambs bought in at the end of the     
 harvest for fattening during the      
 winter.                               
   The fattening cattle are bought in  
 as store cattle at a year old. The    
 barley is sold as grain or for malting</content>
