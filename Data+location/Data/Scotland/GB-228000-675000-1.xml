		<content> The East End of Greenock is divided   
 almost equally between residential and
 industrial land-use, the industry is  
 confined to the flat land of the      
 raised beach along the Northern limit,
 as too are the main lines of          
 communication, the A.8 road and the   
 railway to Glasgow.  Much of the heavy
 industry has declined.  The shipyards 
 now depend on  oil rig construction.  
 Most port facilities are unused,      
 sugar being the only regular cargo.   
 Housing is almost entirely local      
 council rented by tenants. It consists
 of modernised old tenements, inter-war
 council built houses, post war high   
 and low rise flats,&amp; a few privately  
 owned houses.  The housing generally  
 is south of the industry on the lower 
 slopes of the Renfrew Heights.  Though
 a low amenity area attempts are being 
 made to improve the environment.      </content>
