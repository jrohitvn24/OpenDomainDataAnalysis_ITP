		<title>03ATTITUDES IN CALLANDER</title>
		<content> Most of the {inhabitants}of this area 
 put a high value on their             
 quiet,residential life style.They     
 really appreciate the beautiful {     
{scenery}which surrounds them and are  
 generally tolerant of the             
 tourists,accepting them as an         
 inconvient necessity.                 
 On the whole people are found to be   
 very friendly and helpful,although    
 there is sometimes a slight rivalry   
 between 'locals' and 'newcomers'.It is
 jokingly said that one has to be      
 resident for at least 40 years before 
 being fully accepted.                 
 Dislikes about Callander are few.The  
 Amusement Arcade is unpopular,except  
 with its clients;underage drinking is 
 worrying and the closing of the       
 railway is thought to be a mistake.A  
 few people are worried about their    
 lack of privacy in the{small community</content>
