  The only buses from Glass into town  
 are those of Jack Keir and they come  
 about 3 times a day  so the transport 
 into Huntly is bad unless a car is    
 owned.The traffic on the B_road is    
 heavy because of large Distillery     
 lorries and sheep floats.      {      
{QUESTION                              
  Q.What is the traffic like on the    
 road?                                 
  A.Far too fast and dangerous for dogs
 and children.                         
  Many people have cars.The produce is 
 transported by lorry e.g.             
  Potatoes,sold locally                
  Barley,to Peterhead                  
 Fish transported by freezer lorry.    
 Sheep and  cattle  weekly by          
  float to                             
 Huntly mart which is well attended by 
 local farmers.                        </content>
