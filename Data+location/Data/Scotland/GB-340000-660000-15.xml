		<content> Blackshiels, which adjoins Fala, so   
 that they would appear to be all the  
 one village, contains four houses,    
 farm buildings and a substantial      
 sixteenth century building which is   
 now a guest house..                   
 On the other side of the main road is 
 the village cemetery,which replaces   
 the burial ground at the church. The  
 cemetery is on the side of a          
 right-of-way which crosses Fala moor  
 to the village of Heriot on the A7.   
 For the first mile of the path, there 
 are on both sides narrow stretches of 
 cultivated woodland, some of which was
 recently replanted after destruction  
 by gale force winds in the winter of  
 l983.
