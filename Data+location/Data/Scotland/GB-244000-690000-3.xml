		<content> In the Milton of Buchanan the old     
 school used to be over the Balmaha    
 Road,in the school house. There used  
 to be 4 teachers. Before they used the
 school house they used the Memorial   
 Hall as a school. When the primary    
 school was over in the school house   
 there used to be a high school where  
 the primary school is now but there is
 only a general purpose room and       
 a kitchen. The toilets were outside   
 next to the high school. All the      
 primary children had to cross the road
 to go to the toilet. Mrs Gilmour used 
 to be the lollipop lady but now she is
 the cook. The road was getting very   
 busy and it was very dangerous for the
 children to cross . The road is so    
 busy because Loch Lomond is just up   
 the road,and all the tourists go      
 there. All the high school children   
 went to Balfron High School.          </content>
