 In the year 1566 Mary Queen Of Scots  
 came to Jedburgh to preside over      
 a Justice Ayres or Circuit Court .Her 
 first stay was at the Spread Eagle    
 Hotel.She left when a fire broke out. 
 She found other accommodation in what 
 is now known as Mary Queen Of Scots'  
 House ,a bastel house built to repel  
 invaders.While staying there she went 
 a ride of 30 miles each way to        
 Hermitage Castle to see Bothwell her  
 lover.Mary fell ill on her return to  
 Jedburgh.Before Mary was executed she 
 was reported to have said,"Would I    
 had died at Jedburgh".In 1817 a watch 
 and horse_shoe which are thought to   
 have been Mary's were found in a      
 bog.The House was lived in for many   
 years but is now a museum.
