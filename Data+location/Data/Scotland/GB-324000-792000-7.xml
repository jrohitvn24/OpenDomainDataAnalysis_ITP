		<content> Crathie church was built in when Queen
 Victoria was at Balmoral.I go to      
 Sunday school at Crathie church. I sit
 opposite the Queen. There are glass   
 windows with coloured pictures on     
 them. There is a special door that the
 Royal Family uses. The organist and   
 the choir sit above the main door.    
 There are plaques that show which     
 soldiers were up with the Queen. Mr   
 Angus is the minister and when he is  
 absent Mr Gardiner takes over. The    
 church officer looks after the pulpit 
 for Mr Angus. When the Queen comes up 
 there are a lot of tourists to see    
 her.The police put up barriers so     
 there are no accidents. Some tourists 
 go in to church hoping to see the     
 Queen. When the Royal Family is not   
 here a cover is put over their seats.
