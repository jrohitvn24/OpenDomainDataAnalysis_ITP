		<content> Princes Street is Edinburgh's main    
 shopping area. Many chain stores{trade
 there. The Waverley Market represents 
 the new style of shopping in the      
 eighties. It is made up of small units
 under one roof and the plants and     
 fountains give a relaxed atmosphere.  
 People can hire barrows for a month at
 a time to sell their{arts and crafts. 
 Many of the shops in the centre       
 reflect people's changing{attitudes}  
 e.g. the Body Shop sells cosmetics    
 tested without cruelty and the        
 Marathon Shop caters for the ever     
 increasing{recreation}of jogging and  
 marathon running. The Waverley Market 
 won an award for its shop fronts,     
 mirrored walls and beautiful          
 fountains. It is situated at ground   
 level so that the view to the High    
 Street is not interrupted.
