		<title>09A day of a farmer's daughter</title>
		<content> Every weekend Natasha Grant from      
 Boreland of Kelton gets up at around  
 9.30 pm. As soon as she gets up she   
 usually helps her mother around the   
 house and also her father on the farm,
 such as feeding the animals etc.      
 Usually family outings can be quite   
 difficult in getting as the family    
 work very hard most of the time.      
 She enjoys working on the farm very   
 much and has decided to work on the   
 farm when she is older.               
 As she is so busy most of the time she
 only gets into Gelston sometimes to   
 meet her friends.                     
 She gets to school in the car, it is  
 about 2 miles away from Gelston.      
 In her leisure time she enjoys        
 watching television.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
