		<title>04Kinnoull Hill-a popular walk</title>
		<content> Kinnoull Hill is a very popular climb 
 with the people of Perth and visitors 
 too.From the top you can see the whole
 of Perth and much of the surroundings 
 on a good clear day.There are many    
 ways to get to the top so there is    
 always some new path to try.You may be
 lucky and see a red squirrel or even a
 deer in winter.However do not get to  
 close to the edge at the top as there 
 are very dangerous cliffs and a sheer 
 drop to the bottom!                   
 There's a ruined watch tower at the   
 top but when you realise that it was a
 folly built by someone who admired the
 castles above the Rhine,it doesn't    
 make it so exciting!                  
 Kinnoull Hill is only 923m high so its
 not too far to the top and well worth 
 the effort.
