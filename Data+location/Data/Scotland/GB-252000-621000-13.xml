   This is a selection of items from   
 the local newspaper for a week in June
 1985.                                 
   "Project Highhouse" has transformed 
 a pit which once employed 300 miners  
 into a series of six small workshops  
 with an initial combined workforce of 
 about 25.                             
   Householders in Auchinleck have been
 warned to be on their guard against   
 thefts from meters.                   
   Coal thefts are still taking place  
 from houses in spite of good weather. 
   Auchinleck Talbot clinched their    
 second trophy within 5 days by beating
 Kilbirnie in the McEwan's Lager Cup.  
   Local councillor expresses concern  
 at the lack of local men being        
 employed at the new Opencast site at  
 Darnconner.
