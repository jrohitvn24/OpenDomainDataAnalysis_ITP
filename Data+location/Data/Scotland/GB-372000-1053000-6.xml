		<title>06NORTH RONALDSAY'S CREELING</title>
		<content> Fishing for shellfish is carried out  
 round the island.The fishing season   
 usually begins in late May or early   
 June,and depending on weather         
 conditions,can last up until November 
 or even into December.Approximately   
 100 creels are worked by each of the  
 two lobster boats. The fishing during 
 the summer season is mainly carried   
 out on the North side of the island.  
 This area extends from the afters of  
 Linnay to Dennis Taing.Towards the end
 of September the creels are shifted to
 the East side,which cover from Dennis 
 Taing to the point of Twingness       
 including the Reef dyke.Each boat has 
 two of a crew and each man has his own
 colour of bouyhead.The creels are set 
 singly and usually have about 20      
 fathom of close corked rope.It takes  
 from 5_6,hours to complete the days   
 with the best creeling.               </content>
