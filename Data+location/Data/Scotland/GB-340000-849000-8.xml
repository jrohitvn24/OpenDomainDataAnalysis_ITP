		<title>08 Keith Railway Station</title>
		<content> Keith Railway Station lies on the     
 north side of the town near the River 
 Isla and adjacent to Kynoch's Wool    
 Mills. The railway station stands on  
 the main Aberdeen to Inverness railway
 line. A branch line also runs from    
 Keith to Dufftown but this is mainly  
 used by distillery traffic and there  
 is no passenger service although in   
 summer, excursion trains from         
 Aberdeen run occasionally.            
 The station is operated by British    
 Rail. On average, around 20 trains    
 arrive and leave Keith each day.      
 Approximately five freight wagons     
 arrive at Keith daily carrying a      
 variety of goods including mail,      
 parcels, newspapers, coal, timber and 
 raw materials for the distilleries.   
 Between 50 and 70 passengers travel   
 from Keith daily, making it busy for a
 small town station.                   </content>
