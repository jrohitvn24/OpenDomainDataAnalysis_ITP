		<content> For the boys and men there are junior 
 and senior football teams,which play  
 on the pitch at the Inn. There is a   
 darts club. Clay pigeon shoots are    
 held in the field beside the Inn and  
 competions are held throughout the    
 year. Some men go out shooting wild   
 duck and hares: others go hill walking
 and climbing. A young boy of 12 has   
 about 45 Munros (peaks over 3000 ft ) 
 to his credit and his father has      
 conquered about 153. A few are members
 of the Lonach Society whose centre is 
 in Strathdon 12 miles up the glen. The
 Lonach Gathering and Games ,held every
 year in Strathdon are the oldest in   
 Scotland.  Social events held         
 throughout the year raise funds for   
 all these groups.One highlight of the 
 year is the vintage car rally which   
 takes place in June. Discos are held  
 at the Inn for young people.          </content>
