		<title>11Falkirk Tryst Cont'd</title>
		<content> It is still an{event}today,the Tryst{ 
{fair}which comes to Tryst ground in   
 September.Local people regard it as a 
 part of their heritage.One girl       
 wrote"Every year when the tryst comes 
 I go there all the time.I would never 
 miss it.I go on as many attractions as
 I can and stay out till late."The     
 tryst children go to the local primary
 and secondary schools."When the tryst 
 boys come into our class for two weeks
 they were shy,then,after a few        
 days,they played and were just like   
 the rest of us.They have lovely names 
 like Rennie and Ryan and D'Aroy.I     
 heard the council is going to allow   
 houses to be built on tryst land.That 
 would be a terrible thing to do.They  
 have enough houses and children's fun 
 would be spoil,"was one pupil's{      
{attitude} to this{tradition.
