 Craigendarroch Hotel &amp; Country Club   
                                       
 This is a new development brought into
 Ballater and Upper Deeside.It involves
 a hotel which has been refurbished. It
 is named after the Craigendarroch hill
 where it is placed.There is also a    
 luxury country club with a swimming   
 pool, spa bath, games room, snooker   
 room, trimnasium, health &amp; beauty     
 salon, squash courts and a ski slope. 
 At 450-500 people the local membership
 is now full. To maintain high         
 standards it is thought wise not to   
 use it as a community centre.The      
 majority of staff employed are        
 local.Some difficulty was experienced 
 in finding accommodation for incoming 
 staff. Local opposition to the        
 development is still a talking point  
 in the village.                       </content>
