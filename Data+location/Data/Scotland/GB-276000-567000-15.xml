		<title>15Fishing in the Urr</title>
		<content> In the Urr there is  good fishing and 
 a good selection of fish - salmon,    
 trout, eels, pike and other small     
 fish. The fish that is mainly sought  
 after is the salmon. The Urr is       
 usually packed with eels that will    
 take any bait that is set for the     
 salmon, trout or pike.                
 About a hundred people a year come to 
 fish in the Urr from all over Britain.
 A few of the local people also fish.  
 They are allowed to fish for salmon   
 from April to August, trout from May  
 to August, eels and pike all the year 
 round.                                
 You can get a yearly permit from      
 Tommy's Sport Shop in Castle Douglas  
 for Â£4. To fish in the Croys stretch  
 you can get a free permit at Croys.
