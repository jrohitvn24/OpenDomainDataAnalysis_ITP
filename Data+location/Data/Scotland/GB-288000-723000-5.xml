		<content>   Gilmerton is situated 2 miles from  
 Crieff.  It has developed very slowly 
 over the years and is now like two    
 hamlets joined together with the old  
 and new housing areas.  Many of these 
 new houses, owned by the council, are 
 occupied by young families with a few 
 being the homes of retired couples,   
 many of whom were farmers.  It is     
 purely a residential area with        
 virtually no services or industries.  
 In the village there is a hotel, a    
 Post-Office/grocery/general store and 
 a phone box.  Bus services are however
 regular but often not frequent enough 
 for some residents.                   
   The village is built on a hillside  
 and is surrounded by fertile farmland.
