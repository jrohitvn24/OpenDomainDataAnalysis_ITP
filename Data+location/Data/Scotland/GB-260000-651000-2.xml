		<content>    In East Kilbride an outbreak       
 of Meningitis has come.Six people have
 died and a few are seriously ill in   
 hospital.Health board spokesmen cannot
 see the cause.                        
    The Dollan baths in East Kilbride  
 have been closed because of Asbestos  
 in the walls and ceiling of the       
 building.It has been stated that it   
 will be closed for six months.        
    A lot of people in East Kilbride   
 have put their names down for a house 
 or flat.Over 3000 applicants are      
 waiting for one of the two.Just a     
 short while ago there were roughly    
 2ooo applicants but over the past few 
 months more people have put their     
 names down.                           
    Asbestos has been discovered       
 round the water tanks in some  houses.
    Tenants are concerned about this.
