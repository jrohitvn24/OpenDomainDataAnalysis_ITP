		<title>11VANDALISM PAISLEY</title>
		<content> In some part of our area vandalism is 
 a big problem.Youths smash telephone  
 boxes,windows and spray graffiti over 
 walls and pavements.                  
{Jenny's Well Road}is a popular haunt  
 for these people. The police have     
 caught several youths spraying        
 graffiti there and they have been     
 fined.There is an old abandoned       
 railway line which used to carry      
 trains from Glasgow to Gourock which  
 is now popular among glue-sniffers.   
 They spray the area around the line   
 with graffiti.A tunnel under which the
 railway used to run is covered with   
 graffiti. Other derelict buildings    
 have been given the same treatment for
 example the old mill which was closed 
 because asbestos was found in the     
 building.The youths probably do these 
 things because they have nothing to   
 occupy their spare time.              </content>
