		<title>10SHAWHEAD VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>   In 1909 Mr and Mrs Adamson gave two 
 generous donations adding up to Â£120  
 towards the building of the hall. The 
 total cost of building the hall was   
 Â£500. Mr James Clark McGeorge donated 
 the land that the hall was built on.  
                                       
   The hall was opened as a public     
 library as well as a hall on the 22nd 
 December 1911. The hall used to have 4
 fireplaces and the benches were kept  
 in a hut that belonged to the hall.   
                                       
   The hall is used for a lot of things
 now. There is a playgroup on Tuesdays 
 and Thursdays, badminton on Mondays   
 and Wednesdays, bowling on Thursdays  
 and football on Saturdays. The Youth  
 Club meets in the hall on Fridays     
 during the winter months.
