		<title>14CLUBS IN GARTMORE</title>
		<content>   The{Village Club}is where winter    
 activities take place with a full-    
 size{snooker}table and a{Summer Ice}  
 table. Summer Ice came to the area    
 when Irish labourers were building the
 Glasgow water tunnels, and is played  
 on a 22foot table with Steel "Stones".
 It is the indoor version of Curling,  
 and it is also played in America as   
 "Shuffle board".                      
   The{Curling Club}started in 1864 and
 its members play at Stirling Ice Rink.
 Gartmore has often won the local cup. 
 There is a thriving fishing club who  
 have competitions on local lochs and  
 go out fishing nearly every weekend.  
   The{Football Club}has been an       
 institution for many years and the red
 and white strips can be seen at the   
 local games where they have had their 
 share of trophies.
