		<title>06The Square</title>
		<content> The{SQUARE}is protected because it is 
 an example of early village planning  
 and contains many listed buildings.   
 The most dominant of these is the {   
{BELLIE CHURCH}on the south side. In   
 front of the church is a fountain with
 park benches along side a large area  
 of lawns and trees.                   
   Through the middle of the square    
 runs the{A96}trunk road creating a    
 need for the anciliary bus shelter,   
 public toilets and telephone booths.  
   In the summer of 1985 the shelter   
 was badly affected by graffiti and    
 four senior art pupils created an     
 attractive mural to cover the work of 
 the vandals.                          
   The square is the site each summer  
 of the main items of the{GALA WEEK    
 when funds are raised to support many 
 of the community projects run by the {
{Amenities Committee}through the year. </content>
