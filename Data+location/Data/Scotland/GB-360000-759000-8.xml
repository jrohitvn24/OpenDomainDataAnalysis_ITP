		<title>08How I Spend Saturdays</title>
		<content> On Saturday morning I usually go to   
 Football Training at Damacre Community
 Centre.It is 25p to get in to the     
 Centre for two hours.After Football   
 Training I go home and have my lunch.I
 have a sausage roll,a glass of milk,a 
 cream cookie and a snowball.          
    I then go up the street with my    
 friend.We go into Fine Fare to buy    
 sweets and a bottle of juice.We then  
 go to the Glebe and watch Brechin City
 playing Football.There is a Tuck      
 Shop so that you can buy something    
 to eat at the Football.               
    After the Football I go home for my
 Tea.On Saturday night my Mum and Dad  
 usually go out and my sister and I    
 stay at my cousin's house.We normally 
 watch Television there.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
