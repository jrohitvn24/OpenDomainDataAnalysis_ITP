		<title>15Living on a Farm</title>
		<content>  I live on a farm near Banff. We have 
 210 acres of land. About 170 acres are
 in barley, the rest is in grass and   
 turnips. My dad works a 7 year shift. 
 The field is in grass for 3 years, in 
 barley for 3 years and turnips for 1  
 year. We feed the cattle turnips,     
 barley and straw. My dad has 110 cows 
 in the summer and 150 in the winter.  
  My dad and a friend of his do        
 contracting: they do silage, spraying,
 sowing, combining and baling. We start
 work at 7am and stop at 5pm. We have  
 over 100 sheep on the farm. We breed  
 Suffolk Cross lambs and sell them to  
 Buchan Meat (a meat company). It is   
 good fun living on a farm because     
 there is hardly any traffic to worry  
 about and plenty to do.
