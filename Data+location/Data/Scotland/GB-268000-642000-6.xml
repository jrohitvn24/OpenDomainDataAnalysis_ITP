 questions :-1)WHAT IS THE MOST COMMON 
 CRIME IN STRATHAVEN?------The most    
 common crime is theft,mainly          
 housebreaking and shoplifting.

 last three years there has been an    
 increase.                             
 3)SINCE IT BECAME COMPULSORY TO WEAR  
 SEATBELTS HAS THERE BEEN A DECREASE IN
 SERIOUS ACCIDENTS?-----In Strathaven  
 there has been a definite decrease in 
 accidents.

 A survey of the public indicated that 
 they wished to see more policemen on  
 the beat and felt that not enough was 
 being done to combat crime due to     
 light sentences by courts.            </content>
