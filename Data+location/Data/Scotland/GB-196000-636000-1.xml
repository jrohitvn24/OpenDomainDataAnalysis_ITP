		<title>01GLEN ROSA TO GLEN SHURIG</title>
		<content> At the bottom of Glen Rosa the valley 
 floor is broad and flat, and so it is 
 used as a campsite. However because   
 the water level in the burn rises very
 rapidly, the campsite is easily       
 flooded during wet weather. Further up
 the glen is the Garbg Alt waterfall.  
 There is a small dam in the burn, and 
 this is the main water supply for     
 Brodick, the water being piped away.  
 The land north of Glenrosa water and  
 the Garbh Alt is owned by the National
 Trust for Scotland. Glen Shurig runs  
 across the south of this area, and on 
 the south side of the glen is the     
 string road, running from Brodick to  
 Blackwaterfoot. There are a few houses
 in the lower part of the glen. The    
 western area is moorland which is wet 
 and boggy in places. Part of the area 
 is a site of special scientific       
 interest.                             </content>
