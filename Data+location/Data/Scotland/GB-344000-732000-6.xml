		<title>06     DOUGLAS LIBRARY</title>
		<content>    Douglas library opened in 1969 and 
 it is quite modern.In the library     
 there is an area for children.Douglas 
 school is right next to the library   
 and it is handy for people from the   
 school because if they're doing a     
 project they can go across to the     
 library and get books to help them    
 with it.The library is where books are
 given out but you must have tickets to
 get them out.With children's tickets  
 you can borrow 2 books,adults can     
 borrow 4 books.Books can be borrowed  
 for up to 2 weeks.If you are late in  
 handing your books back,you have to   
 pay a fine.Some libraries have many   
 thousands of books,and most have a    
 reference section for looking up      
 things.These books cannot be taken out
 of the library.
