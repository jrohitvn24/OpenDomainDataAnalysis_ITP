		<content> SPORT IN ABERDEEN.                    
                                       
 Aberdeen is particulary well off as   
 far as sports facilities are          
 concerned many of which are in our    
 area.                                 
                                       
 For the athlete we have Linksfield    
 Stadium (close to the Aberdeen F.C.   
 ground) and within the university     
 grounds, a cricket pitch, squash      
 court, and a swimming pool. Linksfield
 Community Complex can offer a         
 gymnasium with wait training          
 equipment, and a pool ideal for the   
 learner.                              
                                       
 Moving towards the beach there is the 
 Links golf course - owned by the      
 Council - and various 'novelty' games 
 like crazy golf and putting.
