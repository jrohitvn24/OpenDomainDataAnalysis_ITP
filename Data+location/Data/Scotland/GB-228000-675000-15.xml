		<content> The town's main industry is           
 shipbuilding.  Most of the            
 townspeople work for Scott Lithgow    
 shipbuilders.  Near the shipbuilders  
 there is Lamonts and Kincaids who     
 repair the ships and provide the      
 necessary parts.  A few months ago    
 Scott Lithgow was under threat of     
 closure due to lack of orders and     
 failure to complete work to contract, 
 but fortunately the company was taken 
 over by Trafalgar House. The collapse 
 of shipbuilding would mean disaster   
 for Greenock. In the East End the     
 small shopkeepers still thrive. Their 
 prices  may be a bit higher but they  
 are near at hand, saving the costly   
 bus fares.  The police and fire       
 station are situated in the East End. 
 They do not provide  many jobs but do 
 provide a very useful service.
