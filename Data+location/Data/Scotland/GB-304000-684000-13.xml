		<title>13CROSSFORD GALA 1985</title>
		<content> Each year, usually nearing the first  
 week of June, the village of Crossford
 has its own Children's Gala. In 1985  
 this week began on Saturday 25th May  
 with a kick-start competition, local  
 children negotiating their cycles over
 a variety of obstacles. The first     
 major event however, fast becoming    
 traditional, was the family day       
 barbeque on the 26th, in the grounds  
 of the Keavil House Hotel. These      
 grounds were also used for discos on  
 the 30th. A car treasure hunt for all 
 the family, followed by a country and 
 western night at the Pitfirrane Arms  
 Hotel, were the Wednesday night       
 events, but the 5-a-side football     
 competitions remained the principal   
 attraction for many. Preliminary      
 rounds, for junior and senior boys and
 for junior girls, were held during the
 week, finals on Gala day itself.(p.14)</content>
