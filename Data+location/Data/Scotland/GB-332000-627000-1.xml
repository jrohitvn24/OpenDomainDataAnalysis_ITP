		<content> The area in general is not bery high, 
 the highest hill in the area is       
 Welshie law at five hundred and four  
 feet. There are several fields under  
 crop in the south east quarter. There 
 are also houses and farms in the south
 east quarter. The only populated area.
 The land in the other quarters is     
 basically dry moor and heath. Through 
 this populated area runs the A708, and
 the Yarrow water alongside it. There  
 are some earth works in the south west
 corner. About a hundred yards from the
 A708 stands the yarrow stone, grave of
 two princes, and although the epitaph 
 is weathered away, faint lines are    
 still deciferable. There is quite a   
 lot of enclosed pasture visible There 
 are two burns, the Wurlus and the     
 Whitehope which run into the Yarror   
 water.
