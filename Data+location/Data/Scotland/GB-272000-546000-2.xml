		<title>02Dundrennan Abbey</title>
		<content> The Abbey is the most prominent       
 building in our village.              
   People from all over the world come 
 to visit it while they are on their   
 holidays.They have come from Germany, 
 France,Denmark,India,America and      
 China.                                
   There are three custodians who have 
 to make sure people pay to look       
 around.                               
    Every few years parts of the Abbey 
 need repairing.People from the Church 
 of Scotland carry out this work.The   
 Abbey lawns are cut every week by the 
 custodians.                           
    There is a cemetry which is still  
 used for burials of people who have   
 relatives buried there.               
    This summer about 330 visitors are 
 expected,including six school parties 
 and one party of pensioners.
