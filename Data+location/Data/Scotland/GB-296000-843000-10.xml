		<content>    In the winter months indoor bowling
 is a favourite pastime of the locals. 
 Apart from the weekly practices,      
 competitions within the club and in a 
 local league are held in the Community
 Hall. Special functions take place in 
 the hall such as concerts, talks or   
 occasionally dances.                  
                                       
     There are also regular            
 meetings of the Women's Guild, Women's
 Rural, Badminton Club and the Rifle   
 Club ( held in the purpose-built rifle
 range attached to the hall.)          
                                       
     The nearest cinemas and theatres  
 are ten to twenty-five miles away.    
                                       
     There are no local Brownie or Cub 
 packs but some parents take children  
 to Forres to attend Cubs.
