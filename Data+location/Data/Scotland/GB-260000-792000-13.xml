		<title>13Shopping in Laggan</title>
		<content> In the past most people had to travel 
 to Newtonmore to do some of their     
 shopping.They now do all their        
 shopping at the local village shop in 
 which they all have a paid share.This 
 store is called The Laggan Community  
 Trading Limited and is a cooperative  
 formed by the people with the help of 
 the H.I.D.B. now all deliveries are   
 made by the Cooperative Wholesale     
 Society.By 1984 private ownership had 
 been proving unsuccessful for owners  
 and customers,and the practice of self
 help already applied by the population
 to maintain their T.V reception (see  
 Media) was once again brought into    
 use.The shop is run by a manager under
 the guidance of an elected committee. 
 This is proving beneficial to all.From
 the birth of the idea 1984 to the     
 appointment of manager took only 3    
 months of hard work &amp; cooperation.    </content>
