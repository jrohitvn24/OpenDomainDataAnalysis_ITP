		<content> Castle-Douglas H.S moved to its       
 present site on Dunmuir Rd in 1956. It
 is a secondary school catering for    
 11-17 year old boys and girls. The    
 Headmaster is Mr Campbell.            
 The school has a roll of 460 pupils   
 and 43 teachers. The roll of the      
 school will decline over the next few 
 years because of the declining birth  
 rate. The school was upgraded to a    
 five year school in 1979.             
 There are 3 buildings: the main       
 building, an extension which includes 
 the library, and a games hall.The main
 subjects taught in the school are     
 Maths, English, Modern Languages and  
 Social Subjects. Senior pupils sit    
 examinations for the Scottish         
 Certificate of Education with a large 
 measure of success.
