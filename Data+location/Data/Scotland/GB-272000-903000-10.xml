		<title>10Rogart - Trade (Miss Pirie)</title>
		<content>  Miss Pirie owns a tweed shop in      
 Rogart. The building is over a hundred
 years old and Miss Pirie has always   
 worked there.                         
  She sells cuddly toys,silver and gold
 jewellery, woollen jerseys, tweed,    
 tartan and lots of souvenirs. She     
 doesn't make any of the items sold in 
 the shop herself, but most of the     
 items are made in Scotland by Scottish
 craftsmen.                            
  Most of her customers are people she 
 knows. Many tourists call in,         
 including foreign visitors.           
  Perhaps her most famous customers are
 the family of Robert Maclennan,       
 the Socialist Democratic Member of    
 Parliament for Caithness and          
 Sutherland.                           
  Miss Pirie would hate to live in the 
 city. She loves living in the country 
 and enjoys meeting people.            </content>
