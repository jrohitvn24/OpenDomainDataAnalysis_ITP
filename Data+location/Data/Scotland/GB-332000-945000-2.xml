		<title>02Development of the Village</title>
		<content> Originally the village was situated at
 Sarclet. The people earned their      
 living by fishing and crofting. By    
 1906 only a Post Office,Smiddy,Police 
 Station and Station house had been    
 built. The railway line ran parallel  
 with the Main Road and it was here the
 village began to develop. After the   
 war people from Sarclet and the       
 surrounding district squatted in the  
 empty Air Ministry Camp site houses at
 Tannach and in 1948 the first council 
 houses were built along the roadside  
 at Thrumster. Today there is no Smiddy
 railway or Police Station and the P.O.
 is a combination shop.There are now 56
 council houses and 6 private bungalows
 Eight council tenants own their own   
 homes.In 1960 modernisation began with
 the replacement of stone fireplaces,  
 flag floors,cavity wall insulation and
 finally in 1982 the Caithness slates. </content>
