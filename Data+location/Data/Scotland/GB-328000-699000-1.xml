		<title>01Glenrothes and Markinch</title>
		<content> The area we studied was an interesting
 mixture of old and new and town and   
 country.The eastern section of the    
 area is devoted almost exclusively to 
 farming.This area of Fife is one of   
 the richest pieces of farmland in     
 Scotland and the local farmers take   
 good advantage of the fertile soil and
 the low even contoured landscape.     
    The western half of the area       
 contains a pleasing mixture.In the    
 north lies the town of Markinch with  
 most of the qualities and features we 
 assosciate with a traditional Scottish
 small town.In the south we have the   
 eastern outskirts of Glenrothes       
 Newtown with its tightly planned      
 housing schemes and the peripheral    
 industrial estate which is such a     
 feature of the planned town.In the    
 extreme south is the village of       
 Coaltown of Balgonie.                 </content>
