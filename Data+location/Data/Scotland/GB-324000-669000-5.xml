		<content> The building company Gilbert Ash      
 thought of the idea of a Shopping     
 Centre at Cameron Toll.More commonly  
 known as the Savacentre,it was opened 
 on 2 October 1984.It covers 26 acres  
 and cost Â£32.5 millions. It took      
 2years 1month to build. It employs    
 1200 people,250 of whom are part      
 timers. The Centre has 45 shops,the   
 most popular being the SAVACENTRE and 
 the least used the optician. Other    
 facilities include a restuarant and a 
 car park which holds 1000 cars.So a   
 family can do a week's shopping in a  
 compact covered are,have a meal,      
 and fill the car with petrol.It is    
 also on several bus routes. The main  
 centre is open 7 days a week,from 9   
 until 8,except Sundays from 9 till 5. 
 The Centre won an award for the       
 best centre opened in Europe in 1984. 
 It was competing against 24 others.   </content>
