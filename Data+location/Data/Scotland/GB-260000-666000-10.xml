		<content> ]There were 4 huge locomotive works in
 Springburn-the St Rollox Works of the 
 Caledonian Railway Co.;North British  
 Railway Co.Works at Cowlairs;Hyde Park
 Works of Neilson and Co;Atlas Works of
 Sharp Stewart and Co.They are gone and
 the only works in the railway industry
 is British Rail Engineering Limited,  
 set up to repair,service and modify   
 carriages and rolling stock.1800 are  
 employed.As BR make economies in many 
 areas the engineering works will have 
 to do the same.By 1987 the workforce  
 has to be cut to 500.Much information 
 is being given by the media as to how 
 Springburn was once the locomotive    
 capital of the world,building engines 
 for the railway companies in Britain, 
 and for export to many countries.The  
 workforce at the"Caley"is preparing to
 fight to keep the work and skills that
 for long have been in Springburn.     </content>
