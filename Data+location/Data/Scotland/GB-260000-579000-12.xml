		<title>12HOME LIFE IN DALRY(KIRK)</title>
		<content>    In this rural community, family    
 life centres round the domestic hearth
 or, more accurately, the television   
 set. The climate, albeit fairly mild, 
 is not conducive to 'living in the    
 street', although in the morning the  
 shortest errand can take an hour, with
 passing the time of day with the      
 neighbours. Everyone knows everyone   
 and stops to talk. In the summer,     
 gardening is the main activity,Dalry  
 gardeners are keen and competitive,and
 much use is made of their produce for 
 freezing,preserves and home made wine.
 The long winter evenings provide time 
 for handicrafts of all kinds. Some of 
 the womenfolk create beautiful        
 embroidery, patchwork and knitting.   
 They are also known for their baking, 
 and find an outlet for these skills   
 in the many 'bring and buy' sales     
 and in home entertainment.            </content>
