		<title>04GLENLIVET FEED PLANT</title>
		<content>   This factory was built in the  early
 1970's to  make  animal  feed from the
 waste  materials of  whisky distilling
 - pot ale and draff (which is itself a
 good animal feed). These are processed
 in the  factory  to  form  dark  grain
 pellets which are rich in protein. The
 plant is highly  mechanised  and  only
 requires an operating staff of 12 men.
   The pellets are sold to agricultural
 food firms to be used as part of their
 compounds  and  a  small percentage is
 sold directly to local farmers but the
 export  market,  particularly  Germany
 buys most.                            
   The plant is owned by  the  Canadian
 company, Seagrams, and  waste material
 from  many  of  their  distilleries is
 processed here.                       
   Housing  is  available locally along
 with the distillery workers.
