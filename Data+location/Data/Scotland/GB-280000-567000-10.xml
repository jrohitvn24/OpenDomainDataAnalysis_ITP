		<title>10Farm Worker</title>
		<content> My dad is a farm worker on "Larglea". 
 Every morning he has to get up at 7.45
 to go and work in a parlour where     
 cows are milked.  The parlour is      
 different from an ordinary byre as it 
 is automated and you don't need to    
 feed each animal by hand.  There is   
 an "ogre" which is a long tube that   
 comes from a tower which stores the   
 feed that supplies the parlour.       
 Another main job is feeding young     
 calves.  If they are under two weeks  
 they get their mothers' milk.  If they
 are older they get powdered milk.     
 Then they can go into the fields to   
 feed themselves.  They are not ready  
 for milking until they are at least 3 
 years old. Every night my dad has to  
 clean the parlour with the pressure   
 hose. It is the easiest job of all.   
 This time of year is busiest because  
 it is time to harvest the crops.      </content>
