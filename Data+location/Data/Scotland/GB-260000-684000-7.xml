		<content> I make tablet in my workshop (the old 
 farm bothy), helped by two ladies from
 the village.                          
                                       
 It was originally made for sale in the
 milk bar, when it opened in 1956. It  
 now sells throughout Scotland.        
                                       
 Tablet is a Scottish speciality, (akin
 to fudge) and although recipes differ,
 the ingredients are much the same -   
  { sugar, condensed milk, butter      
{   milk, syrup and vanilla essence.}  
 Our{recipe is one my mother used.} The
 strange name{tablet}can only describe 
 the shape in which it is sold.        
                                       
 We opened{Scotland's 1st farm milkbar.
 It very soon became a village feature,
 but the modifications necessary to    
 meet new EEC regulations led it to    
 close in 1982.                        </content>
