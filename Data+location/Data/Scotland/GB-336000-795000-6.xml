		<content> "Colin has been cooking today, chef's 
 day off. 2hrs off in afternoon;busy in
 the garden.We have a polythene tunnel 
 - lettuces ready mid-May. Next spring 
 hope to have 3 Shetland ewe lambs &amp; a 
 couple of pigs (weaners). At 5.00     
 Colin off again to Inn; he checks     
 menu, lays tables, ready to open at   
 7.00. Popular dinner meals are; home  
 made pate, venison or steak, fresh or 
 smoked salmon, home produced ice-cream
 At height of season we can do 30 meals
 a night. I put children to bed.       
 Colin is usually back by 11.30;       
 working over 80 hours per week. I swap
 one evening per week with him. Maybe  
 its just as well that the season is   
 only 7 months long. We close the Inn  
 during the winter, in common with     
 other hotels &amp; guest houses in        
 Ballater.
