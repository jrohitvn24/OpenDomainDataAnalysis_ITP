		<content>{Council Housing }There are approx.1100
 council houses in Maybole. The oldest 
 stock is below the{High Street,}the   
 newest above. The new stock is all    
 2/3/4 apartment with central heating  
 suitable for tenants with families.   
{Sheltered Housing }There is only one  
 sheltered housing complex,situated in 
{Crosne Street.}It opens onto the{High 
{Street}near most of the shops.This    
 makes it easier for the old people to 
 do their shopping without having to   
 walk far.                             
{Housing Maintenance}The need for this 
 has increased due to property ageing  
 and therefore requiring more repairs. 
 Council tenants today also expect a   
 higher standard of accomodation and so
 more repairs/upgradings are necessary.
 Vandalism in Maybole is limited and   
 does not create a serious problem.
