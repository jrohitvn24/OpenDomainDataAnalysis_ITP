		<title>10Past and Present in our Area</title>
		<content>  There are some historic buildings to 
 be found in our area to the north of  
 the town. Mains Castle, built around  
 1500 AD, fell into disrepair and be-  
 came a ruin. Now it has been renovated
 and restored and is lived in as a     
 private house as was shown on a recent
 television documentary.               
  Lymekilns is a building with a very  
 different fate. Until recently this   
 large house with about 12 stables was 
 used as a riding school but with the  
 plans for house building in the area  
 it has had to close to be demolished. 
  Castle Hill and Rough Hill are both  
 fortified sites but nowadays there is 
 little to see. The best links with the
 past are to be found in the village;  
 the Montgomerie Arms built in 1719 and
 still in use, with the skyline of the 
 area dominated by the clock tower of  
 the parish church built in 1774.      </content>
