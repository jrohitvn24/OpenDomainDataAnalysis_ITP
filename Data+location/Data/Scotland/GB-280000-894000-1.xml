		<title>01Entrance Loch Fleet, Dornoch</title>
		<content> Before the road was built at the head 
 of Loch Fleet the main route north and
 south was the ferry between the two   
 headlands.  The entrance is very      
 narrow and consequently the tides rip 
 through and are quite dangerous.  The 
 houses on the north bank are once     
 again family houses and include the   
 daughter of the last ferryman.  There 
 are many walks through the woods,     
 dunes ad sandy beaches.  The area is  
 good for birdwatching and is on the   
 edge of a nature reserve.  There is   
 one large farm on the south side      
 behind the dunes around the shore.    
 This is a mixed farm, mainly barley,  
 sheep and beef cattle.  There is a    
 further plan for a railway bridge     
 across the narrows.
