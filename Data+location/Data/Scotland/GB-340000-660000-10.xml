		<title>10FALA VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Fala Village is in this block.The     
 village comprises nineteen houses, a  
 church, a school and a village hall.  
 The hall is a corrugated iron         
 structure,which was brought from Fife 
 where it had been used by the military
 in the first World  War.              
 There is no shop in the village now,  
 but there is a sub-post office.       
 Although Fala is a rural area, only   
 three men, resident in the village,   
 work on the land. Several people      
 commute to Edinburgh and there are ten
 retired people. In the village itself,
 there are thirteen children up to the 
 age of sixteen. There are twenty      
 children enrolled in the school,      
 fifteen of whom live outwith the      
 village.                              
 Fala Church, of the Church of         
 Scotland, is linked with Crichton and 
                                       </content>
