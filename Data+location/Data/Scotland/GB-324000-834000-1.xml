		<content> This block includes the summit Ben    
 Rinnes Scurran of Lochtelavdoch 840m. 
 Ben Rinnes is the highest hill in     
 Moray District and is a notable       
 landmark from the Moray Firth         
 coast and sea. Alongside the B9009 and
 below the peak of Ben Rinnes there are
 Glensinnes primary school, Alta       
 Bhainne Distillery and a small public 
 hall. The primary school has 15 pupils
 and one teacher. The distillery was   
 opened in 1975 employs 8 workers and  
 is in full production making half a   
 million gallons of whisky annually.   
 The small hall (built as Dill Hall in 
 1883) is used by the public and by the
 school. There is sadly depopulation in
 the glen due almost entirely to bigger
 farm units by amalgamation of small   
 farms.
