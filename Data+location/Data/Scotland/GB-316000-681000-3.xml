		<title>03Local events Dalgety Bay.</title>
		<content> Many interesting events take place in 
 Dalgety Bay throughout the year. The  
 main organising body is the Sailing   
 Club which organises raft races across
 the bay, barbeques on the foreshore   
 during summer evenings, discos        
 throughout the year and a bonfire and 
 firework display on November 5th. On  
 occasions the club organises special  
 excursions to Inchcolm, an island in  
 the Firth of Forth formerly inhabited 
 by monks who lived in the 12th century
 Abbey of Inchcolm. All that remains   
 there now are ruins and an abundance  
 of bird life. Many events organised by
 the club are also open to non members.
 During August the Dalgety Bay Gala    
 takes place during which the Gala     
 Queen, a primary seven pupil chosen   
 from either of the two local primary  
 schools, is crowned.
