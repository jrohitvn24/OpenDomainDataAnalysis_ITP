		<title>12THE NEW CHURCH.</title>
		<content>                                       
 The church is in the centre of        
 Burnfoot at the top of Fraser Avenue. 
 It is a replacement of the old hut    
 church in Fairhurst Drive. The new    
 church was built in l955. It has the  
 usual things like pulpit, communion   
 table, lecturn and baptismal font. To 
 the left of the lecturn is the door to
 the vestry where the minister changes 
 into his robes and cassock. Because of
 the movable chairs it is not only used
 as a church but as a theatre and      
 badminton hall. The modern church is  
 used throughout the week. As well as  
 its normal use there are bible        
 classes, Girls Brigade. Sunday School,
 play school and services. The modern  
 church gets more use than the old one 
 did.
