		<title>16NICK NAMES</title>
		<content> Eyemouth was for many years a close   
 knit community and inter marriage was 
 quite common,resulting in certain     
 surnames being common to many         
 families.Lough,Aitchison,Dougal,Collin
 and Patterson are still predominant   
 names in the area.Nick-names became   
 the easiest way of distinguishing     
 between people with the same          
 surname.These nick-names stuck to them
 through youth and middle age and have 
 been passed on to children and        
 grandchildren.Many local married women
 are still referred to by their maiden 
 name.The christian name of a person   
 was often associated with that of     
 their wife or mother,hence"Betty's    
 James"etc.Christian names such as     
 "Jamesina" and" Davida" are associated
 with the Disaster when several baby   
 girls were named after deceased       
 fathers.                              </content>
