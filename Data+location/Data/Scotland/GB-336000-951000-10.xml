		<title>10Staxigoe W.R.I.</title>
		<content> The Staxigoe W.R.I. has been running  
 in Staxigoe for many years. At present
 there are about 25 members who meet in
 the local hall on the second Tuesday  
 of every month. They have a President,
 Vice President, Secretary and         
 Treasurer. Each year they organise a  
 trip and try to visit as many         
 different places as possible. At the  
 last meeting a lady came and showed   
 the members how to make bread in      
 different shapes and with various     
 ingredients. She had taken butter and 
 jam with her to spread on the bread so
 that everyone could get a taste. The  
 W.R.I. normally has competitions. Last
 month the juniors had to bake 4       
 meringues and the seniors had to bake 
 a savoury flan. They have craft       
 competitions as well. After the       
 demonstrator left they had a break and
 a business meeting.                   </content>
