		<content> We took a traffic census at the       
 junction known as Denny Cross}from    
 l0.30am till ll.30am. We found the    
 volume of traffic surprising          
 considering that the M80 motorway     
 bypasses our area. 230 vehicles went  
 North towards{Stirling,}166 South     
 towards{Glasgow,}280 East to{Falkirk  
 and{Grangemouth}and 206 came West from
 a ring route around part of Denny. 106
 and went west from and 160 went East  
 to the junction. The{motorway}which   
 bypasses our area and which does not  
 afford Denny or Dunipace direct access
 was also subjected to a census of an  
 hour at the same time of day as the   
 other census. 530 vehicles were       
 counted on the Northerly route; 352   
 cars, 146 lorries, 18 buses and 14    
 others. On the Southerly lane were 382
 vehicles, 260 cars, 106 lorries, 2    
 buses and 14 other vehicles.          </content>
