		<content> A local man who claims that his       
 village is 'under siege' by a local   
 broiler house firm is to raise a      
 petition which will be presented to   
 the local M.P. Sir Hector Munro. The  
 protest is against the siting of ten  
 broiler houses next to the A74 at the 
 Braes Farm, Kirtlebridge. The planning
 application by the firm who already   
 operate four broiler houses in the    
 area was approved despite objections  
 from ten local residents. It is       
 maintained that the broiler houses    
 already give off dust and noxious     
 fumes in the mild weather and a       
 further ten houses would only increase
 the problem. The question of road     
 safety was also stressed and the      
 danger of slow-moving lorries and     
 tractors entering the A74 trunk road  
 would cause a traffic hazard.
