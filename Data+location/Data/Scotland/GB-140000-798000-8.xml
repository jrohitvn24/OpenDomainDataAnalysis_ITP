		<title>08FUEL SUPPLIES ON RHUM</title>
		<content> Living on an island means that many   
 things other people take for granted  
 are not so commonplace to us. For     
 example, fuel supplies have to be     
 ordered and organised.                
                                       
 The Lochmor carries a 45 gallon drum  
 of petrol whenever this is required.  
                                       
 The gas boat comes about three to four
 times a year and brings about 30      
 bottles of Calor gas.                 
                                       
 The Puffer comes a year and brings 80 
 tons of coal. This is stored in a     
 large coal dump and is delivered to   
 homes as required.                    
                                       
 The Western Isles will bring diesel,  
 which is needed for the Landrovers,   
 when it's needed.
