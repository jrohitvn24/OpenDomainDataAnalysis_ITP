  Some leisure activities in Inver-    
 moriston are a natural off-shoot of   
 country life,eg.fishing and shooting. 
 An Olympic standard shooting range was
 opened at Blaraidh in 1981 and one of 
 the leading lights in the gun club is 
 Martin Girvan ,an Olympic Bronze Medal
 winner in 1980.                       
   Various organisations exist eg.youth
 club,badminton club,darts team and a  
 recently-formed football team which   
 plays at Riverside Park where there is
 also a children's playground.         
  Many of the village women are        
 interested in traditional homecrafts. 
 Reading interests are catered for by  
 the fortnightly Mobile Library service
 and most people enjoy radio,records,  
 and television.
