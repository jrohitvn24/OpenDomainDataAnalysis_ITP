		<title>02AN INTRODUCTION TO DUNDONALD</title>
		<content> Life in our area centres around the   
 small village of {DUNDONALD}(Pop.3000)
  Dundonald is set amongst farmland    
 about 4km from the sea. The village is
 dominated by an ancient castle built  
 in the 13th Century and from which    
 Scotland was ruled for a time. There  
 are quite a few other interesting     
 buildings near the area including, Old
 Auchans Castle, Dankeith House and    
 Coodham House. Also to be seen locally
 is the site of an Iron Age fort on a  
 nearby hilltop.                       
  Dundonald village itself is made up  
 of four housing areas, old and new.   
  In the early 1960's some factories   
 were built providing employment       
 locally. Unfortunately most of these  
 have now closed and there is a lot of 
 unemployment in our area.
