		<content> it can be nice on land but there      
 might have been a storm at sea and the
 breakers can be wild.  Drownings are  
 infrequent although there is a        
 treacherous coastal current and the   
 sandy beach at Shandwick is very      
 popular                               
        There  is a Guide and Brownie  
 Pack but the Scouts and Cubs have     
 folded for lack of leaders. The       
 Balintore football team plays very    
 successfully in the Welfare League.   
 The Seaboard Improvements Association 
 is a womens group which meets         
 regularly for social occasions and    
 also acts as a ginger group. The      
 District Council have appointed a     
 Recreation Officer  who is responsible
 for the encouragement of participating
 in all forms of sport.
