		<title>08KILDRUMMY CASTLE GARDENS</title>
		<content> Close to the castle ruins, in the     
 grounds of the new castle,(now run    
 as a hotel)there are beautiful        
 gardens.In 1904 the owner decided     
 to lay out a garden in and near the   
 quarry, in the Back Den of Kildrummy. 
 A japanese firm constructed the water 
 garden, and a yorkshire firm          
 constructed and planted the beds      
 against the quarry face. Work on the  
 garden is still continuing.  One of   
 the main features is a bridge which is
 a replica of the famous 13th cent     
 Big O' Balgownie. In 1968 a Charitable
 trust was formed to run the gardens.  
 The present Hon. Director of the trust
 lives nearby. The gardens, open       
 between April and September, draw many
 visiters, both horticulturalists  and 
 families enjoying a visit to the      
 coutryside. There are special open    
 days twice a year in aid of charities.</content>
