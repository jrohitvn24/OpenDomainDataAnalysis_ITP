		<title>06FARMING CHANGES</title>
		<content> Over time small crofts have been      
 collected to-gether to make larger    
 farms.  This means that fewer people  
 are working on the land.  Fewer houses
 have been needed so slowly the number 
 of houses lying disused increased.    
 Some unused buildings have been bought
 and turned into modern homes.  The    
 Government's grants have helped people
 to 'do up' houses which might have    
 gone to waste.                        
                                       
 Mechanisation has meant that fewer    
 people can do more work.  One farmer  
 said he can do almost all his work    
 in his tractor.                       
                                       
 The usual 'square' bales have almost  
 disappeared from this block, &amp; have   
 been replaced by the new big 'round'  
 bales.                                
                                       </content>
