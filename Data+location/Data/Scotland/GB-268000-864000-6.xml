		<title>06HERB NURSERY</title>
		<content> Our group from Newhall Primary School 
 visited Poyntzfield Herb Nursery which
 used to be part of the kitchen garden 
 of Poyntzfield House. This was built  
 in 1857 and the garden which is about 
 three quarters of an acre in size was 
 then used to grow vegetables for the  
 big house. The nursery is only about  
 half of the original kitchen garden,  
 the other half is left to grow wild   
 just now. We found out that Mr. Ross  
 grows over 300 plants and herbs as    
 well as vegetables for the restaurant 
 in the big house. Some of the plants  
 are grown from seed, others are grown 
 from cuttings. We were very surprised 
 to find that some seeds came from as  
 far away as Germany, Ireland, America,
 China, Canada, India and other        
 countries.
