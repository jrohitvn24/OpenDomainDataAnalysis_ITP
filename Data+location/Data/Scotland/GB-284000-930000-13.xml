		<title>13Gold - Strath Of Kildonan</title>
		<content> Gold is found in most of the          
 tributaries of the Helmsdale River.   
 In 1868 gold was discovered in the    
 river and by the end of the year there
 were five hundred gold prospectors in 
 the Strath! Many of them lived in     
 wooden huts at Baile an Or (Gaelic for
 the town of gold) They found          
 considerable amounts of gold. After   
 two years the landowner forbade any   
 prospecting because of complaints from
 farmers and sportsmen. The Kildonan   
 gold rush was over! Nowadays many     
 tourists come to look for gold. To pan
 for gold you put soil or gravel       
 together with water into your pan and 
 swirl them round. After repeated      
 washings the heavier minerals lie in  
 the bottom of the pan and if you are  
 lucky you will find gold there. Gold  
 panning is an interesting pastime but 
 you need time and patience.           </content>
