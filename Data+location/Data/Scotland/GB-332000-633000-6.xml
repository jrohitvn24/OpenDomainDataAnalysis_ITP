		<content> THE CHEESE WELL.                      
 ONE HOT SUNNY DAY IN JUNE, SIX OF US  
 IN TRAQUAIR SCHOOL P3 WALKED UP TO THE
 CHEESE WELL. WE SET OFF UP A TRACK    
 WHICH HAS BEEN A ROAD FOR SEVEN       
 HUNDRED YEARS. THE TRACK IS VERY      
 ROUGH, BORDERED BY WILD FRUIT AND     
 FLOWERS. IT CLIMBS STEEPLY THROUGH    
 FIELDS THEN WOODS OF LARCH, SPRUCE AND
 PINE, THEN OVER OPEN HEATHER AND      
 BLAEBERRY COVERED HILLSIDE AT THE     
 TOP, TO JOIN THE VALLEYS OF THE TWEED 
 AND YARROW, THE ANCIENT ROUTE FROM    
 TRAQUAIR TO SELKIRK. IN THE OLD DAYS  
 BEARS, WOLVES AND ROBBERS WOULD HAVE  
 ROAMED THE FORESTS AND HILLSIDES. AT  
 THE PIPERS KNOLL WE LISTENED FOR THE  
 SOUND OF THE LONE PIPERS. WE CLIMDED  
 TO THE TOP OF THE HILL AND SAW THE    
 BRIGHT YELLOW OF THE WILD DAFFODILS,  
 GROWING BY THE CHEESE WELL. TWO STONES
 MARK THE WELL ON THE RIGHT OF THE PATH</content>
