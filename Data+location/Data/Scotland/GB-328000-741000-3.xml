 Newtyle is best known for the         
 railway.The Dundee to Newtyle railway 
 ran over part of the Hatton Hill and  
 down to what is now the Bulb farm.It  
 was opened on the 16th.December 1831. 
     The first carriages were two old  
 stage coaches,one called{"Tally       
{Ho",}and they were fitted with wheels 
 to suit the{gauge}of 4ft.6.5in.       
     Horses pulled the train on the    
 level parts and stationary steam      
 engines pulled the train up and down  
 the three inclines.                   
     The first steam engines which     
 replaced the horses in 1833 were built
 by the{Carmichael brothers of Dundee  
 and cost Â£3,700.They were called the  
{Earl of Wharncliffe and the Earl of
