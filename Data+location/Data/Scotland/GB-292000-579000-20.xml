 All the 532 people living in the area 
 are native to Britain, 106 are        
 children and 138 are retired.         
 The majority of retired people lead a 
 very active life with wide interests. 
 For the less able Meals On Wheels are 
 available and social service care is  
 augmented very often by good          
 neighbours.                           
 The teenager tends to find more going 
 on in the near by town Dumfries,      
 meeting their friends in leisure      
 centres and public houses.            
 There is a good cross section of      
 people in the community although      
 neither the parish minister nor the   
 local headmaster live in the area.    
 The information given has had to be   
 more condensed than one would wish.
