		<content> Throughout the rest of the summer     
 months{specialist days}were arranged. 
 Music lovers could attend on a Tuesday
 to meet a{piper}and discuss his music.
 Wednesday could boast a{glass engraver
 or{horn carver.} On Thursday a        
{spinister}demonstrated her wheel and  
 talked of wools and dyeing. {Food}was 
 Friday's topic and oatcakes could be  
 sampled after seeing them cooked on a 
 smokey peat fire in the Blackhouse -  
 somethng to be remembered I'm assured.
                                       
 Regularly featured are life sized     
 models of a tinker mending pots, a    
 farmer's wife working in the field    
 and a spinister at her wheel.  Various
 wheeled vehicles have been lent by    
 local residents including a traction  
 engine, milk delivery cart and horse  
 drawn carriage.                       
                                       </content>
