 My dad is a shepherd and has to feed  
 the sheep in winter with hay. We have 
 five dogs. Two are collies and they   
 round up the sheep for dad. We have   
 three fox terriers that dad puts down 
 fox holes to chase the foxes out and  
 then he shoots any foxes that run     
 away. He does a lot more besides being
 a shepherd. He shoots red deer stags  
 and hinds. If the deer are low down on
 the hill near the road, he fires a    
 shot from his rifle to frighten them  
 back up the hill again. He fixes      
 fences and also looks after the boat  
 we have on the loch. It is used to    
 carry any deer that he has shot by the
 side of Loch Ericht.He also has to be 
 on the look-out for poachers. He has a
 ferret to catch rabbits. We like      
 eating venison, trout and rabbits.    </content>
