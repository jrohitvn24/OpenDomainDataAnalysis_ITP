		<content>    There are two sizeable settlements 
 in the area.  Glamis, population      
 approximately 230, and Charleston with
 45 houses occupied and several holiday
 homes.  There are also some 50 people 
 living in scattered farms throughout  
 the area.                             
    There are no large families of     
 young children as was common a        
 generation ago.  Half of the          
 forty families with children at Glamis
 School have two children,             
 approximately a quarter have one or   
 three children, and there are only two
 families with four children.  This    
 reflects a continuing trend to two    
 children families.                    
    The majority of families still have
 local roots, but a growing number of  
 families have come into the area, both
 from the surrounding area and from    
 much further afield.                  </content>
