		<title>16THE KNIGHTS OF ST. JOHN</title>
		<content>   The name Knightsridge comes from its
 association with the Knights of St.   
 John. These Knights began as a        
 religious order of the Roman Catholic 
 Church and were founded in the 11th   
 century by a man named Gerard. They   
 were based in a monastery in          
 Jerusalem.                            
   The Order came to Scotland in the   
 12th century and built a priory at    
 Torphichen, near Bathgate. This priory
 was dedicated to John the Baptist and 
 they were called the brothers of      
 St.John. At first their work was      
 limited to caring for pilgrims and the
 sick. Later the Order fought in the   
 crusades and took the name, Knights of
 St. John. These knights owned a       
 stretch of land from Torphichen to the
 present-day Howden area of Livingston 
 where Knightsridge now stands.
