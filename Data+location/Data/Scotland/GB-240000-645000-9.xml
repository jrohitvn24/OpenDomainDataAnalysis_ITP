		<title>09FARM LAND USE IN STEWARTON</title>
		<content> This year many farms have not been    
 able to make hay into dry hay bales as
 the weather has been so wet. Farmers  
 now in September take any opportunity 
 to cut the hay and are making it into 
 big bales covered with black polythene
 to feed as wet silage in winter.      
 Though well mechanised with varied    
 machinery  it has been difficult to go
 on the land as fields are rutted and  
 muddy this year. There was only one   
 field of barley in the area at        
 Lainshaw Mains. Silage is made in     
 silos, pits or large polythene bags.  
 About half the land is in permanent   
 pasture and most of the remainder is  
 grassland either to be harvested as   
 hay or silage for cattle feed in the  
 winter.
