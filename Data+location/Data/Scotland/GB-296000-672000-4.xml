		<title>04The Knights of St. John</title>
		<content> Torphichen has ancient links with the 
 hospitaller Knights of St. John.      
 The preceptory, parts of which still  
 stand today, was the headquarters of  
 the Knights of St. John in the 12th.  
 century. The order of the Knights of  
 St. John is still in operation today. 
 The members raise money for many      
 different types of charities. In      
 Lothian Region they raise money for   
 an old folks home, in Central Region  
 they raise money for a home for the   
 blind and in Grampian they raise money
 for the mountain rescue team. The     
 Order of St. John is open to anyone   
 and nine people in the village who are
 members take part in fund raising     
 events. The minister of Torphichen is 
 a Chaplain in the Order of St.John and
 he conducts a service each year in the
 Preceptory on the Sunday nearest St.  
 John's Day, the 24th. June.           </content>
