		<content> One day in June we went to{Banff Links
 which is about 14 miles from here.    
 when we got there we all asked if we  
 could go into the sea and have a swim 
 which we were allowed to do. We did   
 not stay in long as it was very cold  
 and the tide was going out. After we  
 dressed we went on the swings and     
 roundabout. At 12:00 we ate apples,   
 sausage rolls, currant buns and       
 drank juice. After that a man came and
 asked if we wanted to be taken by a TV
 crew for a news programme about a     
 Miniature railway that had just       
 been built.  We all ran over and got  
 on the train. The train went to the   
 town of Banff and back again. When we 
 got off we got our things and went    
 home on the bus.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
