 This block is located in the Highlands
 of Scotland - in Easter Ross. It lies 
 on the coastal lowlands between the   
 Cromarty Firth and the hills of the   
 North west Highlands to the north.    
 The A9 (the main road through the     
 Highlands which runs WSW - ENE through
 the area) divides the area into two   
 unequal parts.                        
 There is no central settlement though 
 a nucleus is developing at Newmore due
 to recent private building. However   
 two of the four major towns in Easter 
 Ross are close by - Invergordon 2km.  
 to the south,Alness 3km. to the       
 west. The area is essentially an      
 agricultural area but industry exists 
 in Forestry and quarrying; and the    
 now closed aluminium smelter.         
 3 buildings dominate the area:Rosskeen
 Church,Kincraig House and the smelter.</content>
