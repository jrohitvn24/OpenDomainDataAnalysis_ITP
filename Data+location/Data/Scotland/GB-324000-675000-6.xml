 characteristics once familiar in the  
 inner city areas throughout Scotland -

 New enterprises have been born, ugly  
 gap-sites have been developed or land-
 :scaped and transformed into small    
 parks.   Old buildings have been given
 a new lease of life and the quality of
 the housing is improving and          
 expanding.
