		<content>  With the lack of evening or day      
 classes in our block, hobbies are     
 mostly confined to the{home. }Popular 
 hobbies include knitting, sewing,     
 T.V. and videos. {Outside hobbies     
 include fishing, shooting, beekeeping,
 going to ploughing matches, and       
 parachuting nearby at Fordoun.        
 Gardening is popular, and an          
 increasing number of greenhouses are  
 being built. People travel up to 25   
 miles to the theatre and to evening   
 classes of their choice. Reading as a 
 hobby is made available to all by the 
 weekly library van calling at the shop
 and council houses. The van also      
 carries a stock of records. The women 
 can meet once a month at the S.W.R.I. 
 The children enjoy playing outside -  
 weather permitting - and bicycling is 
 very popular.
