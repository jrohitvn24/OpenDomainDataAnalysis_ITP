		<title>06Local History-  Lochgelly</title>
		<content>        The name Lochgelly is of Gaelic
 origin, either the bright lake or loch
 of the leeches.                       
        In the early 19th Century this 
 was a weaving village but after the   
 discovery of large deposits of coal,  
 Lochgelly at one time was one of the  
 most important mining towns in        
 Scotland.                             
        Lochgelly lies 182 metres above
 sea  level, which makes it the highest
 town in Fife.                         
        The main shops are located in  
 Bank St. and Main St. but for a       
 greater variety people will travel to 
 Kirkcaldy, 18km S.E. and Dunfermline, 
 13 km S.W.  Edinburgh 32km S can be   
 reached by road and rail.             
                                       
        A focal point in the town is   
 Lochgelly Centre which hosts a wide   
 variety of activities.                </content>
