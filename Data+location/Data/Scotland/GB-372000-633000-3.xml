		<content> Computers in Kelso are coming in fast.
 Many people use them. They may be good
 for doing some things but there are   
 many people out of work because of    
 computers. The people who make them   
 have got a job. There are more        
 electronic devices getting built now  
 than there ever were before. That is  
 probably why so many people are in the
 electronics business. Keltek and Neves
 are two electronics factories in      
 Kelso. I know a lot of people who work
 in these factories. Their main job is 
 assembling computers and printing     
 electronic circuits. One of the       
 factories makes sound consoles for    
 recording studios. Many businesses in 
 Kelso use computers these days for    
 much of their office work. All the    
 schools in Kelso have computers.      
 Our school, Broomlands, has three     
 computers which we use every day.     </content>
