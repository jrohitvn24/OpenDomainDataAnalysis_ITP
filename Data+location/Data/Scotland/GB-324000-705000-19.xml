 Our village lies at 250ft above sea   
 level.The Palace was used as a hunting
 lodge during the Stuart period by the 
 knights and squires who resided at    
 Newton, which is where the ale used in
 Falkland was brewed.Falconry and boar 
 hunting were very popular when Royalty
 came to the palace.The name of our    
 village comes from this pastime which 
 was carried out in the vast forests   
 which then surrounded the village.
