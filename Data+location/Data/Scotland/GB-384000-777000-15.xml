		<content> On Fridays I spend my leisure time in 
 the youth club where I can play       
 snooker or play on the television     
 games. There is also table tennis. I  
 buy things at the tuck shop which     
 sells crisps, sweets, and cans of     
 juice. The youth club is a brilliant  
 way to spend your leisure time and it 
 is held in Catterline Primary School. 
 At other times I spend my time playing
 with my toys in the house and         
 sometimes I help to do the garden. I  
 like to watch television programmes or
 play about on the grass outside my    
 house. I sometimes go shopping with my
 mum on Saturdays. Other people        
 sometimes like to go for a cycle run  
 or play down at the shore.
