		<content> Loch Glow is very popular with        
 anglers. The Loch is controlled by    
 Rosyth Civil Service Sports           
 Association's Angling Section.        
 Approximately 50 members take out     
 season tickets which enable them to   
 fish at any time. Day permits are also
 available to members of the public    
 through club members, agents and      
 commercial outlets. Charges at June   
 1985 are Â£2 per adult and Â£1 for      
 juniors and old age pensioners.       
 Approximately 1000 adult tickets and  
 500 child/pensioner tickets are sold  
 annually.                             
   Because of the pressure of fishing  
 the Loch must be stocked artificially.
 Brown Trout and Rainbow Trout are     
 injected in mid-season and in October.
