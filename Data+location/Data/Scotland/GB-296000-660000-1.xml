		<title>01THE BREICH VALLEY</title>
		<content> The area inside this grid is commonly 
 referred to as The Breich Valley.It is
 made up of three villages namely      
 Addiewell,Breich and Stoneyburn.The   
 main stretch of water flowing through 
 the area is The Breich Water.         
     Although the villages are close   
 geographically the people have never  
 associated much.This is probably      
 because Breich lies on a different bus
 route from the other two.In the case  
 of Addiewell and Stoneyburn the 2     
 villages have long been rivals because
 they were in different counties until 
 Local Government reorganisation in    
 1975.                                 
     The population of the area is     
 roughly 3500.
