		<title>13FARMING : Oilseed rape</title>
		<content> One of the major changes in the       
 farming landscape of this area over   
 the last two years has been the       
 introduction of{OILSEED RAPE}as a     
 major new cash crop.                  
 The plant has a long growing season of
 12 months. It is planted in August and
 harvested the following July/August.  
 Many fields of bright yellow flowers  
 in late Spring have an obvious impact 
 on the eye.                           
 The oil is used as a vegetable cooking
 oil but has to be mixed with other    
 oils before it is usable. The waste   
 matter has certain limited value as   
 cattle feed. The crop yield can be    
 increased by almost 15% if beekeepers 
 locate their hives in the field. The  
 plant is a valuable source of pollen  
 and nectar although the granulation   
 qualities of the honey are not totally
 desirable to all apiarists.           </content>
