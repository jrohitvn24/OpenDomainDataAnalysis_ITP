 If you go past old Linthill House you 
 might get a right fright, for they say
 the ghost of the woman murdered in    
 1751 still hangs about in a blood     
 stained dress.  Mrs Home, the lady    
 that stayed in the big house had gone 
 to bed one night and had just shut her
 eyes, when a man crept out from under 
 her bed where he had been hiding.  He 
 hoped to get the keys of her safe out 
 the pocket of her nightie, but she    
 jumped up and gave such a yell that he
 panicked and stabbed her over and     
 over again with his clasp knife.  The 
 poor woman managed to pull her bell   
 rope before she died. The murderer,   
 her own servant, broke his leg jumping
 from the window but dragged himself   
 into a field of peas where he was     
 found in the morning. He was the last 
 man to be hanged in chains in Scotland</content>
