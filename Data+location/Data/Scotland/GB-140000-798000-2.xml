		<content> In the summer of 1983 the Nature      
 Conservancy Council uncovered a       
 scatter of flaked stones whilst       
 ploughing one of the fields to the    
 north of Kinloch on Rhum. This        
 suggested that there might be evidence
 surviving from some of the early      
 inhabitants so in 1984 a team was     
 organised from the National Museum of 
 Antiquities of Scotland, financed by  
 the Scottish Development Department,  
 to examine the surviving remains.     
                                       
 The first season of work established  
 that in one area of the field there   
 were indeed the remains of the tools  
 used and the pits dug by the early    
 inhabitants. During April / May 1985  
 further excavations took place to look
 at the site in more detail.
