		<title>19The Chaplain:Glenalmond Coll</title>
		<content> He enjoys the country and likes to be 
 away from towns.  He lives with his   
 wife and mother in a school house.  He
 has been at Glenalmond since April    
 1985. He has been here for too short a
 time to make concrete conclusions     
 about it, though many things impress  
 him including the individual care and 
 attention put to things, but finds    
 parts of the Chapel service           
 unattractive, including the lack of   
 involvment of boys.  He finds it      
 difficult to think what to put into   
 the Divinity curriculum and likes to  
 see the boys working out their own. He
 thinks the Bible is the wrong place to
 start teaching about Christianity and 
 prefers working here to in a parish as
 he had to be a member of many         
 organisations. He is concerned that so
 few boys attend Holy Communion, but   
 enjoys having Chapel daily.           </content>
