		<title>01Upper Ettrick Valley</title>
		<content> This upper stretch of the Ettrick     
 Water, running SW to NE is flanked in 
 the north by hills rising to 600mts   
 and is cut through by many deep burns.
 The land to the SE of river and road  
 is mainly planted with conifers,      
 except for the high tops which are    
 unplanted and ungrazed.  Two farms    
 each of about 1000 acres account for  
 the other with Blackface sheep,       
 producing top quality lambs for sale  
 in September.  Lambing is late in the 
 upper valley, starting late April and 
 lasting at least six weeks.  The sheep
 are worked on a 6 year cycle with the 
 oldest ewes sold to farms at a lower  
 level for a final crop of lambs.  The 
 wool is clipped off the sheep in July.
 Hill cows, graze the lush growth of   
 the summer hills, but fodder has to be
 bought in for winter which can be     
 severe.                               </content>
