 The building of{St Magnus Cathedral   
 began in 1137,by Earl Rognvald 1 who  
 was Earl Magnus's nephew.He built the 
 cathedral in memory of his uncle      
 Magnus.It is built of{red and yellow  
 sandstone, carved by master masons    
 from Durham.It took nearly three      
 hundred years to complete during which
 time the design changed greatly from  
 the original plan.It is owned by the  
 people of Orkney, which makes it      
 unique.{Tankerness House}was built    
 opposite St Magnus and housed the     
 clergy and choir boys in the 12th _   
 13th C. It is now a Town Museum.      
{The Bishop's Palace}was built for the}
 bishop of the Cathedral to live in.   
 Later in history Earl Stewart let his 
 musketeers live in it.It is now in    
 ruins and looked after by the         
 Department of the Environment.        </content>
