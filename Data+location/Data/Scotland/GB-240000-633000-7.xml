		<content> To find out all about{Entertainment}we
 had to make up a{questionaire.}We went
 out into the streets of{Shortlees,    
{Bellfield}and{Riccarton}to interview  
 people to find out which entertainment
 they enjoyed most. Out of one hundred 
 people we interviewed, 28% of the     
 people watched the television,26% read
 books etc. 10% went to clubs and 10%  
 went to discos. 8% went to pubs and   
 lounge bars. 6% went to dances and    
 only 2% saw films at the cinema. The  
 remaining 10% enjoys bingo, amateur   
 productions ie. musicals etc. knitting
 and gardening. From our survey you can
 see that the most popular form of     
 entertainment is watching TV and      
 reading is the 2nd most popular. The  
 reasons for this may be because of    
 age,unemployment or simply that they  
 enjoy the comforts of their own home.
