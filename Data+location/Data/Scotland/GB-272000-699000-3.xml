		<content> The village of Doune is made up of a  
 variety of houses. Some are council   
 houses, some privately owned, some are
 flats and some Victorian mansions.    
 One, possibly the oldest in the       
 district, is a fortified house,       
 Newtown of Doune, where Sir Walter    
 Scott once stayed and Bonnie Prince   
 Charlie called at in 1745, and another
 two have recently been converted from 
 a disused church. The centre of the   
 village around the cross is made up of
 terraced cottages hundreds of years   
 old, some of which were still thatched
 until 50 years ago; on the edge of the
 village a national builder has        
 constructed detached villas and       
 bungalows and attracted many new      
 familes often with school age         
 children,                             
 all within the last 15 years.
