		<content> One Hall Russell built vessel         
 currently in the news is the 'Rainbow 
 Warrior',the flagship of the          
 environmental pressure group          
 'Greenpeace'.Built in Aberdeen in 1955
 and christened 'Sir William Hardy' she
 was Britain's first electric diesel   
 trawler. M.A.F.F.used her for research
 work into advanced catch handling     
 techniques at their Torry Research    
 Station.Sold to Greenpeace in 1978 she
 has been at the forefront of their    
 campaigns against whaling by Icelandic
 and Russian fleets and nuclear dumping
 from Sellafield on the Cumbria coast. 
 Tragically she was blown up and sunk  
 in Auckland Harbour this month killing
 one crew member. Sabotage was the     
 motive probably because she was on an 
 anti-nuclear mission in the Pacific to
 have culminated at Muruoa Atoll where 
 the French are testing a H-bomb.      </content>
