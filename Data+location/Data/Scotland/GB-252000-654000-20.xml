		<content>      These pages of text were written 
 by pupils of Eastwood High School,    
 Kirkhill Primary School and St Cadoc's
 Primary School.                       
                                       
                                       
      Those in Eastwood High School    
 were in the Sixth Year Studies        
 Geography Class and in the Sixth Year 
 Studies English Class.  They paid     
 visits to the oldest class in Kirkhill
 Primary School when they were writing 
 their pages.   Pupils of St Cadoc's   
 were writing their own pages, with the
 help of their teacher.
