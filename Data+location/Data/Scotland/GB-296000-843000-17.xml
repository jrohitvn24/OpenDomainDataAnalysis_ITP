		<title>17OUTDOOR PURSUITS IN FERNESS</title>
		<content>                                       
    The area around Ferness is suitable
 for hiking, orienteering and is also  
 used occasionally for scout camps.    
 Forest paths provide routes for riders
 from the nearby riding school.        
   On the hills grouse shooting is a   
 major activity, while pheasant        
 shooting takes place in the wooded    
 areas. Some roe deer stalking is      
 available from the Forestry           
 Commission. The River Findhorn        
 provides excellent salmon fishing     
 while its rapids give good sport for  
 canoeing.                             
   The wildlife of the area is rich and
 varied, and attracts birdwatchers and 
 botanists alike. The local teacher at 
 the turn of the century was an        
 authority in this field and in 1900   
 wrote a book on the natural history of
 the parish.                           </content>
