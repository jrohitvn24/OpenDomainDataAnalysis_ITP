		<content>   Our new town is designed with the   
 safety of the pedestrian specifically 
 in mind. The town roads branch in a   
 free flow system from the main spine  
 which bisects the town  and they then 
 form a grid system. The roads curve in
 order to discourage through traffic   
 and also to keep speed down.          
   The pedestrian footpaths linking all
 areas of the town are entirely        
 separate from vehicular traffic       
 routes. Underpasses and footbridges   
 are provided where roads have to be   
 crossed. Bus stops are situated where 
 pedestrian paths meet the roads. We   
 can walk freely everywhere without    
 worry. Most of our streets are        
 cul-de-sacs which discourage traffic  
 even more. As we are unused to        
 crossing roads we have to be careful  
 in older towns. Traffic lights and    
 Green men are alien to us!            </content>
