		<content> In the classification of farms used by
 agricultural economists the farms of  
 Lindean include these types:Hill      
 Sheep,Upland,Rearing and Livestock-   
 with-arable.The single example of a   
 Hill Sheep farm extends to 400 acres  
 and ranges from 200 to over 300 metres
 above sea level.60 acres are          
 cropped.The remainder is "rough       
 grazing".It is worked by the tenant   
 farmer with occasional casual         
 labour.In reply to a question about   
 his stock he replied: "I've 386 North 
 Country Cheviot ewes and 111          
 gimmers.The ewes were crossed with    
 Suffolk tups (rams) and I have 450    
 lambs to sell as stores".The exactness
 of his reply illustrates not only the 
 intensity of his husbandry but also   
 the narrowness of the margin between  
 his profit and loss.
