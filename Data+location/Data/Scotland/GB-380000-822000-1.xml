		<content> Much of the parish of Bourtie, roughly
 5500 acres, rising to 500 feet or more
 and consits of predominantly hill     
 farms, but where the land falls       
 between the hills there is good       
 agricultural round where all major    
 crops can be grown.  The Burreldale   
 Moss is one area in which the         
 traditional job of peat casting       
 (digging) is still carried on.        
 Although modern farming methods       
 influence the ways of Bourtie farmers,
 their lifestyle is essentially one of 
 continuing the traditions of father   
 and grandfather and many go regularly 
 to the little church in Kirkton of    
 Bourtie, where services are held on   
 the first and third Sundays of each   
 month.  The Kirkton is in fact no more
 than the kirk (church) the Old Manse  
 (minister's house).
