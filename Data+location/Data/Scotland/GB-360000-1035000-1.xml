		<title>01THE SOUTH END - INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> The{South End}is a very{sparsely      
{populated}area: it contains only{35   
{people,}most of whom are farmers or   
 fishermen. It is the most hilly area  
 of the island and has by far the{best 
{views,}of Sanday and of the           
 neighbouring islands. There are many  
 sandy beaches, which make good walking
 places with spectacular views and lots
 of wildlife. On the east side of Hacks
 Ness, which extends south of this     
 block, there are some exciting{caves. 
 There is also an{archaeological       
{excavation}which is another main      
 attraction to this end of the island. 
                                       
 A walk, in late October or early      
 November, down to the tip of Spur Ness
 itself (beyond our block), takes you  
 to a remote spot where you will find  
{Grey seal pups.
