		<content> A good tourist trade gives many local 
 people a good living.  The weather is,
 on the whole, dry and sunny with a    
 fresh wind off the sea.   The beaches 
 at Roome Bay and the harbour are      
 populaar with parents and children.   
 Several golf courses are within easy  
 reach.  There is a great deal to      
 interest students of history.         
 Booklets can be had at the new        
 Information Office, or a close study  
 of the museum can yield much. Two     
 caravan sites and several hotels cater
 for visitors .  Local people take     
 summer visitors and there are also    
 houses to let.  Special entertainment 
 during August, includes a Fair, and   
 lunch time music in the church.
