 in the North_Eastern part of Garioch, 
 with a number of housing developments

 is building houses at Dunnydeer Park, 
 and just off Western Road, Span

 Recently finished is the sheltered    
 housing at Foundland Court for the old
 age pensioners.Presently under con_   
 struction is a development for senior 
 citizens in Denwell Road.             
  The older houses are made of either  
 granite or stone and lime but the more
 modern houses are made of timber and  
 blockwork and are called,"Kit Houses".
 About a year ago the houses in Church 
 Terrace were modernized because their 
 window frames were rotten and they    
 were not very warm.New doors and      
 windows were fitted,as was central    
 heating.The residents were very happy.</content>
