		<content>  If you don't feel like making chips  
 you just go along to the chip shop.   
 The chippy is nearly always busy. It  
 is very noisy with people shouting,   
 the sizzling of greasy chips and the  
 sound of Space Invaders. You have to  
 wait in a queue. The smell of onions  
 and vinegar tingles your taste buds.

  It is mostly women who go to the     
 Bingo because the men go to the club. 
 The hall is noisy and smoky and you   
 have to have your own pen. When the   
 Bingo is finished, you see people     
 waiting at the bus stop or hurrying up
 the road to watch 'Dallas'.

  My gran goes to the Bingo on Tuesdays
 in Lochore Institute. She gets dressed
 up and takes her handbag. I don't     
 think she has missed a Bingo night.
