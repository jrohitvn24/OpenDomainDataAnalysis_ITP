		<content>  Built in{1822,}the church stands on  
 an ancient holy site where several    
 thousand bodies are buried in the     
 cemetery. There is an{iron coffin     
 which was used to keep a new corpse   
 safe during the time of the           
 Bodysnatchers. The church has a small 
 bell tower with a weather cock. A     
 toilet was added but a balcony has    
 been removed.There are{no stained     
{glass windows}but a beautiful         
 embroidered alter cloth was made by   
 the Laird's wife.                     
  Banchory-Devenick communion plates   
 are kept in The Bank of Scotland.     
 Communion is to celebrate The Last    
 Supper and to confirm your faith.     
  About{65% of the 212 members attend  
 regularly travelling from different   
 parts. Within this area live members  
 of Maryculter Church and Portlethen   
 Church also.                          </content>
