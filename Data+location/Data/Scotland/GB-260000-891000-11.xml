		<content> In early summer the{sheep}are{clipped.
 Usually two people work togher. First 
 of all you put the sheep in a pen and 
 you have to take one at a time. You   
 might use eletric or hand shears. You 
 need to cover the ground to keep the  
 wool clean. When the sheep is shorn   
 you roll up the fleece and tie it.    
 Then the sheep is marked and released.
      You have to{dip}the sheep in a   
 special solution to get rid of flies  
 and ticks. When you dip them you have 
 to push them in the dipper and keep   
 them under the dip for a minute. Sheep
 have to be dipped twice a year by law.
      You have to{dose}them just in    
 case they have some infections. When  
 you dose them you have to get a dosing
 gun and sticks it down their throats  
 and make sure that they  swallow the  
 dose.                                 
                                       </content>
