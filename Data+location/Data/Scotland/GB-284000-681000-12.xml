		<content> Stenhousemuir's{football}club is      
 called "The Warriors". They started   
 playing as a club in 1884 and have    
 continued since then and are now 5th  
 in the 2nd Division. The team         
 play in maroon and white strips and   
 have a good name as friendly players. 
 UNfortunately the team is poorly      
 supported, but the supporters have a  
 good reputation and rarely cause      
 trouble. The chairman would like to   
 see a new stand and new toilets, to   
 improve facilities for the supporters.
 One of the ball boys thinks that a    
 bigger shop selling more "sweeties"   
 etc. would bring in more money. The   
 football ground was built on Tryst    
 ground. The{cricket}club started      
 there(1876) and there is also a{golf} 
 club(1885), one of 3 in the area.     
 There are 3 bowling and 1 tennis club.
