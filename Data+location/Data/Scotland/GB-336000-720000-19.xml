		<content> At our school we don't wear school    
 uniform at all but we have to wear    
 sensible clothes. Girls might wear a  
 dark skirt and a blouse and jersey to 
 go with it. The boys mostly wear      
 corduroy trousers. They hardly ever   
 wear shorts and then only in the      
 summer. They wear a tee shirt with a  
 jersey on top and trainers on their   
 feet. When I go out to play I put on  
 jeans, an old jersey and sandshoes.   
 When I am going out somewhere special 
 I put on my good clothes such as my   
 pink suit and a cardigon. When the    
 boys go out they wear a shirt and     
 a tie and good corduroy trousers with 
 an anorak on top. At night the girls  
 wear nighties in the summer and in the
 winter pyjamas but the boys always    
 wear pyjamas all the year round.
