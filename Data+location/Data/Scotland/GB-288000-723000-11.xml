		<content>   During the day it was found that    
 most of the younger generation were   
 working and those remaining in the    
 area were OAPs or young women with    
 children.  Of those questioned most   
 had lived in Gilmerton for less than  
 20 years.  Many people lived there as 
 it was pleasant and convenient for    
 their work.  Crieff is used more than 
 Perth as a shopping centre as it is   
 nearer.  There is a Youth Club and a  
 W.R.I. in the village and most people 
 feel this is enough.  There is also a 
 play area for the younger children    
 behind the estate.  Some of the       
 complaints from the residents were of 
 bad bus services, especially in the   
 morning, and of a need for a crossing 
 for the A85 which runs right through  
 the village.
