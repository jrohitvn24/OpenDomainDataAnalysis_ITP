		<title>16Inverkeithing, the coastline</title>
		<content> The coastline of this area is one of  
 contrasts, with wide sandy beaches,   
 rocky shores, mudflats and high       
 cliffs, perfect habitat for all kinds 
 of bird and animal life.              
                                       
 There are many coastal paths offering 
 beautiful seaside walks around        
 Inverkeithing and Dalgety Bay.        
                                       
 Old ruins such as gun emplacements are
 scattered along the coast (as the     
{railway bridge}and{Rosyth dockyard    
 were prime targets in both the World  
 Wars).                                
                                       
 Sandy beaches such as the ones at St  
 Davids Harbour and Port Laing were    
 once perfect 'day-out' spots, but now,
 sadly, they are severly polluted.     
 A reflection on our times ?
