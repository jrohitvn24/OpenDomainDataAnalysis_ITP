		<title>13SELF-SUFFICIENCY NEAR HOWNAM</title>
		<content> Living in an area about eleven miles  
 from the nearest big town,as the 12   
 resident families around Hownam do,   
 means that being self-sufficient comes
 high on the agenda.The area consists  
 of narrow roads and hills,so being cut
 off in winter weather is quite likely 
 accentuating the need for a good food 
 store.All 12 families make their own  
 cakes and biscuits,grow most of the   
 vegetables they need, and make jam.   
 Most houses now have a deep freeze    
 which greatly  assists in vegetable   
 storage.9 of the families also grow   
 fruit,and 8 make preserves.3 ladies   
 can make their own bread, though not  
 all the time.8 ladies knit clothes for
 their families and 5 make sewn ones   
 too.4 households provide their own    
 milk,and 7 their own eggs. One family 
 keeps five hives of bees, which supply
 a lot of people with honey.           </content>
