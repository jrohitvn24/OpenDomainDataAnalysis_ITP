		<content> Pitreavie Housing Estate.             
 In the early 1960's Pitreavie Housing 
 Estate was built upon farms which were
 called Easter Pitcorthie and Wester   
 Pitcorthie.                           
 The house builders were called Wimpey,
 Barratt, Fairclough and Miller, so    
 there was no real owner and there were
 no shopping facilities on the site.   
 In 1969 Pitreavie Primary School (our 
 school) was built.  It started with   
 200 pupils and then went up to 700    
 pupils.  In 1975 houses were still    
 being built for the new families in   
 the estate and Canmore Primary, which 
 is an open plan school, was built and 
 half of our pupils went there.        
 Since 1980    houses to the northwest 
 of our school have been put up but    
 there are still no shopping facilities
 in the area.
