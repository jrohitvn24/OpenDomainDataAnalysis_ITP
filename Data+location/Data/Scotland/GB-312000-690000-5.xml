		<title>05Majorettes in Cowdenbeath</title>
		<content> In July 1977 a well known instructor  
 of majoretting in Fife set out to     
 form a majorette troupe.He obtained   
 the use of the Y.W. / Y.M.C.A hall for
 the girls to practise in then         
 advertised for girls 5-12 years of    
 age.The response was tremendous,almost
 100 girls turned up for the audition  
 from which 36 were chosen.There are   
 eight committee members this year,one 
 committee member makes all the        
 uniforms herself.We have lots of      
 outings for the majorettes.On Saturday
 22 June 1985 the majorettes went to   
 North Berwick.They did a very good    
 display and everyone enjoyed it.For   
 working hard over the year we always  
 receive medals from our trainer.The   
 one who has been best over the year   
 wins the majorette of the year award.
