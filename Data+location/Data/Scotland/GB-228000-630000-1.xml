      There are many sailing boats tied
 up at the pontoons in Troon Marina.   
 Some people leave their boats there   
 all the year round.  Other people who 
 come to Troon for a holiday stay in   
 their boats for a week or two then    
 sail off somewhere else.During the    
 month of June 500 boats are berthed   
 in the inner basin.Round the World    
 Yachtsman ,Robin Knox Johnston ,      
 was the inspiration behind the idea.  
 Attached to the Marina is a most      
 attractive Chandlery selling a large  
 variety of nautical goods.Another     
 pleasing feature of Troon Marina is   
 a magnificent eating place named      
 Scoffs. In the month of July an       
 open day is held so that the people   
 of Troon can enjoy the facilities.
