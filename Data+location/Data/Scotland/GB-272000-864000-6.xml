		<content> My dad and uncle run a garage in      
 Jemimaville. They do repairs on all   
 vehicles like cars, lorries, buses,   
 tractors and other things. The garage 
 is just opposite the road up to Udale.
 The garage  was first a sawmill then a
 church then it was converted into a   
 garage. My granda built it a long time
 ago. It has two ramps, two offices    
 only one of which is in use, a work   
 bench, a machine for taking wheels off
 cars, lots of tools and two tops of   
 container lorries for store rooms. My 
 dad and uncle are the only people who 
 work there but they used to have      
 another worker called Mackie but he   
 broke his leg and couldn't come to    
 work in the garage again. We sell     
 petrol and diesel there too . Their   
 main suppliers for spare parts are    
 MacRae &amp; Dick's firm in Inverness.
