		<content> It is becoming increasingly common in 
 this area to supplement the natural   
 rainfall (of approximately 28 inches  
 per annum) by artificial watering     
 systems.                              
 This has a beneficial effect on the   
 yields of root crops and vegetables,  
 and also helps to combat certain plant
 diseases which are prevalent during   
 particularly dry seasons. Potato scab 
 is a disease which can be greatly     
 reduced by adequate watering at       
 certain times.                        
 Unfortunately, the main source of     
 irrigation water in this area is the  
 Kenley Burn, and as a result of water 
 being pumped on to the fields, the    
 level of the burn can become          
 dangerously low, and the concentration
 of agricultural chemicals from field  
 run-off has consequently increased to 
 unacceptable levels.                  </content>
