 THE AREA COVERED BY THIS BLOCK        
 CONSISTS OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN       
 GOUROCK AND CENTRAL AND WESTERN       
 GREENOCK.                             
 GOUROCK IS A SMALL TOWN WITH A        
 POPULATION OF JUST OVER 11,000. IT    
 STANDS ON THE SOUTH BANK OF THE RIVER 
 CLYDE ABOUT 40KM WEST OF GLASGOW. IT  
 WAS ONCE A TOURIST RESORT, BUT IS NOW 
 BASICALLY A COMMUTER TOWN. ON ITS     
 EASTERN EDGE IS THE MUCH LARGER TOWN  
 OF GREENOCK WHICH HAS A POPULATION OF 
 OVER 59,000. GREENOCK IS STILL VERY   
 MUCH AN INDUSTRIAL TOWN. THE          
 TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES OF SHIPBUILDING
  AND SUGAR REFINING HAVE BEEN IN      
 DECLINE FOR SOME TIME NOW, BUT HAVE   
 PARTLY BEEN REPLACED BY THE           
 ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY.                 
                                       
                                       </content>
