         Travelling people are living  
 just off Kilbowie Road. Last week     
 Clydebank District Council told them  
 they had to move because they were    
 living on a site earmarked for next   
 month's fair.                         
                                       
          This time there is nothing   
 the council can do about moving the   
 travellers__despite objections by     
 local residents.                      
                                       
          They are obliged to let them 
 stay on that site until an official   
 one has been created somewhere within 
 Clydebank or Bearsden and Milngavie.  
          The  two District authorities
 plan to get together as soon as       
 possible to decide on a site big      
 enough to hold 12 caravans.
