		<title>02A typical day in my life</title>
		<content>  After I get up about 7.30 and dress,I
 go down for my breakfast.My first     
 chore of the day is to take some milk 
 out to the lambs and feed the sheep   
 while my brother feeds the dogs.      
  My father prepares for his work on   
 the Badcall fish-farm.                
  My mother is busy preparing breakfast
 for the guests.                       
  At 9.00 we leave for school.         
  After a busy day in school we do our 
 home work which takes about fifteen   
 minutes. We are allowed to play with  
 our computer till 5.00, when we have  
 our tea.If the weather is good we play
 outside while my mother makes dinner  
 for the guests.                       
  At half past eight we are put into   
 the bathroom and have to emerge well  
 scrubbed. I go to bed at 9.00 and read
 till 9.30                             
  Another day in my life is over.      </content>
