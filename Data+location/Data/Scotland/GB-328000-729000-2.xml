		<content> The livelihood of the people in the   
 surrounding area is closely related to
 agriculture. In many cases local farms
 are handed down from generation to    
 generation and despite the problems of
 inclement weather and traditional     
 farming problems most farmers would   
 not wish to change their way of life. 
 Although not on public service routes 
 in many cases people living outwith   
 the village nearly always have their  
 own transport for necessary visits to 
 the city. Mobile shopping vans serve  
 outlying areas on a regular basis. Any
 disadvantages are outweighed by the   
 benefits of having a rural and        
 contented way of life with the true   
 values of the country dwellers. In    
 recent years the village population   
 has been increased with a number of   
 families moving into new Council      
 houses ,and coming mainly from Dundee.</content>
