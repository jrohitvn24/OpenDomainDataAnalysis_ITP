		<title>13GLENLUCE GHOSTS</title>
		<content> In Glenluce most people do not believe
 in ghosts,but we schoolchildren hear  
 most of the stories and when we are   
 telling the tales we sometimes add    
 more bits on. One story is about a    
 well near a caravan park where a girl 
 was said to be pushed down. Every     
 night her hair is supposed to float in
 the well. I don't know whether to     
 believe this.{DO YOU?                 
 Glenluce is also called the{Valley of 
{Light.}It is said to be the name      
 derived from the Latin{Vallis Lucis   
 given to the area by the{Cistercian   
{monks}who stayed at the abbey which   
 was founded in{1192. Castle of Park   
 built by the Dalrymple Hay family in  
 the{16th century}was said to have used
 stones from the abbey in its structure
 The area is known for being one of the
 earliest Neolithic{settlements in     
{Britain.                              </content>
