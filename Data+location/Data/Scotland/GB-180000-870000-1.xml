		<content> The block is mainly uninhabited,      
 boggy, heather moorland, dotted with  
 small lochs (known locally as the     
 "Fairy Lochs") and interspersed with  
 rocky outcrops most prominent of which
 is Sidhean Moor 225 feet in height.   
 At the eastern boundary the main road 
 to Gairloch follows the river Kerry   
 through a steep gorge, bordered on    
 either side by coniferous trees.  The 
 river flows through Gairloch Dam then 
 turns notth and passes under a humped 
 back granite bridge which connects a  
 minor single-trach road to the main   
 road.  In the north easytern corner is
 the beautiful Shieldaig Bay which,    
 with its aafe anchorages and          
 magnificent sunsets, provides and     
 ideal setting for a hotel catering for
 tourists on hunting and fishing       
 holidays.
