 One wednesday afternoon we went down  
 to the home.  We went to see what the 
 old people would say about Selkirk in 
 the olden days  .We spoke to the      
 matron Miss Cookman and she show'd us 
 around the home.  After that we went  
 to see the old people and we asked    
 them questions.  They have meals at   
 12.30 for lunch,5.00 for tea and 8.00 
 for supper,and all the old people     
 liked the staff.  They found it easy  
 to have a bath in the home than at    
 their house.  Most of them lived in   
 selkirk all their life,most of the old
 people went to knowepark and the argus
 as the high school,then they all have 
 enough to eat.                        
 The home serves Selkirk and the       
 surounding area and although not      
 within our area some of the people    
 in the home come from our area .      </content>
