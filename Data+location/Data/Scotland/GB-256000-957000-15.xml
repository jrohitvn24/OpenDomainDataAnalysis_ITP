		<title>15Playgroup and Youth Club</title>
		<content> There is a group of young mothers in  
 the area who have started a playgroup 
 and joined the National Playgroup     
 Association. They hire the village    
 hall for two aternoons a week and     
 cater for about twenty children.      
 Various functions are held to raise   
 money for equipment for the children  
 whose ages range from2 to 5 years.    
 For the children who live in the more 
 isolated areas  the playgroup is a    
 very good chance for them to become   
 used to being with other children     
 before they start school.             
 A Youth Club also uses the village    
 hall one evening a week when there are
 two sessions, one for the under       
 twelves and the other for teenagers.  
 There are all sorts of indoor activit 
 ies e.g. darts, pool,indoor football, 
 table tennis.                         
                                       </content>
