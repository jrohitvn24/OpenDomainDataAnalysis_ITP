 As stated on page 1, housing in N.W.  
 Kilmarnock is of two types:           
                                       
 (1) Rented accommodation provided by  
 Kilmarnock and Loudoun District       
 Council, subsidised by Rates based on 
 the Assessed Rental of all properties.
 (Onthank_ 1,450   :    Altonhill_340) 
                                       
 (2) Privately owned houses,detached   
 and semi-detached, built individually 
 and in housing estates.               
                                       
 Council Houses which had been abused  
 and were in a state of disrepair,     
 having been sold to a firm of         
 house-builders, are being restored,   
 modernised and sold to private owners.
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
