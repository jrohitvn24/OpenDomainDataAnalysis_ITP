		<content>                                       
                                       
  The lands surrounding Auchinleck are 
 gently rolling green fields separated 
 by rows of trees, hedges or           
 fences.They are ideally suited for    
 grazing or arable purposes.           
  Most of the farms are dairy farms    
 with breeds of Ayrshire and Hereford  
 but there are also herds of beef      
 cattle such as Charolais and          
 Simmental.The crops are mainly        
 grass,hay and silage for feeding, with
 a few root (potatoes,turnips) and     
 grain crops.                          
  Milk is collected from the farms by  
 tankers and taken to the local dairy. 
  Animals can be bought or sold at the 
 weekly market at the nearby town of   
 Ayr.
