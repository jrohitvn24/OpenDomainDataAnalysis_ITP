		<content> In 1642 the council retained a piece  
 of ground for a public market place   
 and fair area. This was the start of  
 the Ferry Fair,held during the second 
 week in August.                       
  This depicts the landing of Queen    
 Margaret,after her ship crashed on the
 rocks at The Binks at the foot of the 
 Loan.With her were her sisters,       
 Princesses Agatha and Christine,and   
 her brother Prince Edgar.The Moubray  
 and Atheling families are featured in 
 the Tableau.                          
 The Burry Man's origins are unknown.It
 is good luck to give him a donation   
 to ward off the evil spirits.He tours 
 the burgh,visiting  streets,shops,and 
 industry,with his two helpers,who have
 covered him in burrs.He is preceded   
 by a bell ringer and children         
 chanting,"Hip,hip,hooray!It's the     
 Burry Man's day!"                     </content>
