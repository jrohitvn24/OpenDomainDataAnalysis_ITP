		<title>15ROAD SAFETY IN CARBOST</title>
		<content> Traffic is quite heavy on the single  
 track road through our village, with  
 heavy lorries travelling to and from  
 the distillery, coal yard,            
 garage,petrol pumps and shop.This     
 creates many problems and many        
 tourists were adding to the problem by
 travelling much too fast through the  
 area.                                 
 The Community Council put up a speed  
 limit sign to see if that would help  
 ease the situation.Recently the road  
 has been improved but is still really 
 single track and too congested.A new  
 pavement was made running almost the  
 full length of the village to add some
 safety for pedestrians.Street lighting
 was also erected making quite a       
 difference to the place especially in 
 the winter months.
