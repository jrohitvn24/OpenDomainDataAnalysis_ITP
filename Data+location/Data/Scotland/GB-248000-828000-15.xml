		<content> There are two big farms on the low    
 ground in the area, both specialise in
 rearing{beef cattle.}The farms have   
 both autumn and spring calving herds  
 and the calves are sold at the local  
 market in{Inverness}and sent for      
 fattening to{Aberdeenshire}and        
{Perthshire.}Balmacaan farm grows      
 grass for grazing and cutting as      
 silage for winter feed whilst         
 Drumnadrochit farm has more variety   
 growing{barley, turnips, hay}and      
{silage}as{fodder}crops.               
  On the high ground the land is       
 divided into{crofts}which are small   
 farms specialising in{sheep.}As the   
 farms are so small the crofter often  
 has a{2nd job}ie. forestry worker,    
 postman, roadman etc. The sheep are   
 brought close to the farm for feeding 
 in winter. The lambs are sold in the  
{autumn}for fattening further South.   </content>
