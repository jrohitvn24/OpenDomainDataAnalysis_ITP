		<title>06LOCAL SERVICES IN MIDMAR</title>
		<content> In Midmar there are not many 'fixed'  
 shops.There is only a nearby post-    
 office, although there used to be     
 several others.There is no newspaper  
 delivery to houses, but the shop      
 stocks them.Because there are not many
 'fixed' shops, there are plenty       
 travelling shops.We have a baker, a   
 butcher, a fishmonger, an ale van and 
 a library.We have the post delivered  
 to our houses, and a refuse collection
 takes place every Tuesday.A milkman   
 comes round on Mondays, Wednesdays and
 Fridays.We have no bus within the area
 , so we go  to school in a privately  
 owned mini bus.There are no  permanent
 medical centres or doctors surgeries  
 in the area either, but there is a    
 nurse who visits sick people.Many     
 houses still have a separate well     
 water supply,and septic tanks and     
 cesspits are still in wide use.       </content>
