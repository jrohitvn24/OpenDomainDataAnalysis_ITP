		<title>12LUNAN BAY, SALMON FISHING.</title>
		<content> There are two firms carrying out      
 salmon fishing at Lunan Bay. Both     
 employ full time managers who live    
 close to the beach, one being a fourth
 generation salmon fisher. The rest of 
 the fishers are employed on a seasonal
 basis.                                
 The salmon fishing is carried out by  
 Stake Nets. The stakes are embedded   
 into the soft sand and nets are slung 
 between them. The salmon swimming     
 close inshore get caught in the       
 pockets formed by the nets. In spite  
 of darkness, gales or icy nets, twice 
 daily, at Half Ebb Tide the men walk  
 out along the nets to collect the     
 salmon.                               
 The season commences on February      
 16th.and ends on the 31st. August.    
 There is no fishing carried out from  
 12 noon Saturday until 6a.m. Monday   
 morning.                              </content>
