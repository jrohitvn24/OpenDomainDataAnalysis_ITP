		<content> Much of this land is bog land, poorly 
 drained and flooded much of the year. 
 The land which is on higher ground is 
 used for rough grassland for grazing  
 of dairy cattle.  The land to the     
 Eastern side is of better quality and 
 wheat is grown.  The farms have       
 characteristic grain silos.  Wind     
 pumps can be seen which drain the land
 by pumping out water.  Many drainage  
 dykes (Burns) have been built and     
 enlarged, showing as straight lines on
 maps.  The ground is hillocky and     
 where grassed, contains much gorse and
 thistle bushes.  Some cheviot (pure   
 white with long upright ears) sheep   
 and some suffolks (black headed       
 compact sheep) are also seen grazing  
 the poorer quality grassland, usually 
 in between the unmanaged deciduous    
 woodland.                             
                                       </content>
