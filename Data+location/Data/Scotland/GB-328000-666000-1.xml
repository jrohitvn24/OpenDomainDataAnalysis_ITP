     This area covers the south-east   
 suburbs of Edinburgh and the "green   
 belt"area that lies to the south of   
 it.It includes the former village of  
 Gilmerton which is now conservation   
 area within Edinburgh's boundary.The  
 housing is mostly council housing in  
 the form of semi-detached houses and  
 low rise flats dating from the{195Os  
{and 6Os.}                             
     The countryside beyond is gently  
 rolling and is used for arable        
 farming,especially cereals but also   
 dairying and market gardening.        
  {Coal minning}was formerly important 
 but the only site presently worked is 
 a small open-cast one.{Sand and gravel
 are quarried near by.                 
   An industrial estate on the north   
 edge of Loanhead occupies the S.E of  
 the block.                            </content>
