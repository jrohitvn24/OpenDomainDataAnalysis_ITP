		<title>18Johnstone: New Houses</title>
		<content> Between the railway station and       
 Overton Road, 112 houses are presently
 being built by Wimpey. These are      
 timber framed houses and, once the    
 foundations are laid each house is    
 erected in about four hours. The roof 
 is assembled on the ground and then a 
 crane lifts and holds this structure  
 while the walls are put in. Each house
 is double glazed and fully insulated  
 because the houses are on a direct    
 flightpath to Glasgow Airport and     
 adjacent to the railway line.         
 We spoke to the site agent who was    
 from Ireland. He supervises the       
 workmen and makes sure that everything
 proceeds efficiently. At the end of   
 the work he moves to somewhere else in
 the country.
