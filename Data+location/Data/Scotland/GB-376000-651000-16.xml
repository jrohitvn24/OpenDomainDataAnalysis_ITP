      WE FOUND THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF  
 CRIME IN DUNS IS DOWN FROM LAST YEAR .
  THE MAIN CRIME IN DUNS HAS BEEN      
 THEFT AND VANDALISM.WHEN SOMEONE IS   
 CAUGHT THEY USUALLY GO TO COURT BUT IF
 THEY ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 16 THEY     
 WOULD GET LET OFF WITH AN OFFICIAL    
 POLICE WARNING .THERE HAVE BEEN TWO   
 MURDERS ONE WAS IN {NEWTOWN STREET} IN
{1976 }AND THE OTHER WAS AT{CHEEKLAW } 
 IN {1965}OR{1967  .}THERE WAS ONE MAN 
 CAUGHT FOR EACH OF THE MURDERS AND    
 THEY WERE SENT TO PRISON FOR LIFE.THE 
 SHERIFF COURT MEETS ON WEDNESDAY EVERY
 WEEK EXCEPT DURING THE HOLIDAYS, AND  
 THE DISTRICT COURT MEETS EVERY MONTH. 
        THE SOURCE OF OUR INFORMATION  
 WAS INSPECTOR ANGUS OF DUNS.
