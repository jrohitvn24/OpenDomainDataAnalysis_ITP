		<content> The metamorphic mica schist rock of   
 this area was carved out by Glaciers  
 about 12000 years ago. This created   
 flat hill tops, steep sided hills and 
 a deep loch. The receding sea level   
 has left raised beach deposits - used 
 for farming, sand and gravel, roads,  
 settlement and a caravan site.  Arable
 and livestock (cattle) farming        
 continue up to a height of 150 metres.
 Surrounding the farm and up to 300    
 metres there are forestry plantations,
 mainly of jitka spruce. Above 300     
 metres the land is given over to sheep
 farming; here the landscape is wind   
 swept and marshy - an inhospitable    
 environment. As the hills are "low"   
 they are only used by the outdoor     
 centres in the area for recreation.   
 Loch Long provides an ever changing   
 scene of wind and waves.
