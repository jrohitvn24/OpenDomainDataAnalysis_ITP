		<title>10C.P.S. INFANT SPORTS DAY</title>
		<content>                                       
  Yesterday we had our sports day.There
 was a ski@ping race for the big girls.
 For the boys and girls there was a    
 relay race. We had a hoop race and a  
 dolly race and a flat race. All the   
 people thet were running did a flat   
 race.                                 
 In the hoop race, Katherine was my    
 partner and we finished  fourth. In   
 the dolly race, Katherine was my      
 partner again and we won!             
  The dolly race was a race that       
 somebody ran and got a dolly and then 
 ran back to the start to get their    
 partner  and gave the other person the
 dolly and then held hands and ran to  
 the finish line.                      
  This year our sports were held in the
 market Park, instead of at the High   
 School sports fields.
