		<content> The village Primary School closed in  
 1966, the few remaining pupils        
 transferring to the school in the     
 adjacent housing development of       
 Kelloholm. When Fauldhead Colliery    
 closed in 1968 many families moved to 
 other coal-fields(Nottingham,Lothian  
 and South Yorkshire) causing a severe 
 decline in school rolls. Three years  
 later, in 1971, Kirkconnel Junior     
 Secondary was closed and the pupils   
 transferred to Sanquhar Academy. Prior
 to this only those pupils who were to 
 follow 'Ordinary' or 'Higher' Grade   
 Examination courses had to make the   
 6km journey, by 'bus, to the Academy. 
 Current financial restraints have     
 severely curtailed Further Educational
 activities and the only class meeting 
 currently is in Dress-making. In past 
 years Motor Engineering,Woodwork and  
 Commercial Subjects were also offered.</content>
