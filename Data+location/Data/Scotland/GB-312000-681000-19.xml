		<title>19Inverkeithing road works</title>
		<content> A new{roundabout}has just been        
 completed at the west entrance to     
 Dalgety Bay,{traffic lights}at a      
 problem junction to the east of       
 Inverkeithing, which now both relieve 
 conjestion, especially on Fridays when
 the factories at{Donibristle.}Now a   
 new roundabout is being built at the  
 west junction to{Inverkeithing,}which 
 was a very bad junction previously.   
 Another issue is the{Hillend          
{Bypass.}                              
                                       
 Something which is less important than
 this perhaps, is the lack of things to
 do in Dalgety Bay for young people. It
 is fine if you grow rhubarb or paint  
 pictures but if you are almost normal 
 there is very little to do out of     
 school. You must travel to            
 Dunfermline, Kirkcaldy or even        
 Edinburgh !                           </content>
