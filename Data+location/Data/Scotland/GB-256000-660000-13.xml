		<title>13Teenagers' Slang</title>

 In the 1980's, we school children in  
 Shawlands have accustomed slang names 
 for objects or people we usually see  
 everyday.  For example, somebody who  
 is really stupid and annoying we would
 call a "tube".  If we had a carry on  
 somewhere it would be called a        
 "rammy".  If someone was sour-faced   
 about something someone might say "who
 stole your scones?" or be sarcastic by
 saying "why are you so happy?"  If    
 someone was being ignorant somebody   
 might say "don't be iggy" meaning     
 don't be ignorant.  If someone was    
 talking a load of nonsense they would 
 be "rambling or rabbling".  Someone   
 who is embarrassed would either have a
 "beamer" or a "brassneck".  A daft    
 person would be known as "mental".
