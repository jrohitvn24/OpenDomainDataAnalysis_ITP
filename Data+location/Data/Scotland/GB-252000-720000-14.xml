		<title>14FORESTRY IN BALQUHIDDER GLEN</title>
		<content>   The acquisition in 1940 of part of  
 the Lands of Ledcreich by the Forestry
 Commission was the start of           
 afforestation in Balquhidder Glen.    
 Kirkton Glen and, more recently in    
 1975, Auchtuhbmore Hill have also been
 planted by the Forestry Commission.   
 Larch and other coniferous trees with 
 some broad leaved varieties makes the 
 landscape interesting and colourful.  
 As land use changes from sheep farming
 to forestry, private companies are    
 also involved in planting trees,      
 mainly on the south side of the glen. 
 Notably on Muirlaggen Hill and behind 
 Stronslaney.                          
   Public opinion differs on the       
 desirability of the change of use of  
 the land from hill farming to         
 forestry. Undoubtedly the landscape   
 today is very different to the heath  
 and moorland of fifty years ago.      </content>
