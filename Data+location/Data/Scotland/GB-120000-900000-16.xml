		<content> The library and the church are both in
 the same place _ the school.{Church}  
 There is no Church of Scotland        
 minister here. So every so often the  
 minister or one of his missionaries   
 come from Tarbert.They either go round
 the houses and have a small service in
 each or sometimes they have a service 
 in the school. The church has always  
 been held in the school. There is a   
 small pulpit there like any other     
 church and chairs and hymmbooks too.  
{Library}The library is in the school  
 as well. When necessary the library in
 Stornoway sends over boxes of books.  
 These contain over a hundred titles   
 covering all tastes _ romances,       
 westerns, mysteries, religious and    
 juvenile. When these have been read   
 they are returned to Stornoway and    
 replaced by a further selection.
