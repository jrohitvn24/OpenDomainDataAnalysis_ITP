		<title>03Farming In Jedburgh</title>
		<content> The farms grow mainly cereals and     
 grass.Barley is the main cereal and   
 in recent years winter barley has     
 taken the place of spring barley.     
 On the grassland Blue Grey sucklers   
 predominate.These are mated with      
 Charolais bulls.Calves are sold fat   
 &lt;50%> or store.The sheep stocks are   
 mainly Grey Face ewes.                
   One farm in addition to cereals     
 grows some vegetables .One of the     
 larger farms has recently had a new   
 owner and farming policy has          
 completely changed.Most of the land   
 has been sown down to cereals where as
 formerly it had cheviot sheep and     
 suckler cows.                         
   Machinery is very up to date.Many   
 traditional farm buildings still exist
 but in recent years many large cattle 
 or multi_purpose sheds have been built
