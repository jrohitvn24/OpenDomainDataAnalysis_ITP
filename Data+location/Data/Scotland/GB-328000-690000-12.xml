		<title>12RAVENSCRAIG PARK</title>
		<content> Sir Michael Nairn donated Ravenscraig 
 Park to the public in 1929. The park  
 was part of his private estate.       
 One of the main attractions of the    
 park is the trees that come from all  
 over the world. The Californian       
 redwood, western hemlock and the      
 maidenhair tree are only some of the  
 many beautiful trees. There is a      
 nature trail which covers the whole   
 park. On the trail you can see a bird 
 aviary. There are some lovely flowers 
 in the flower beds.                   
 In the summer bands play on the big   
 bandstand.                            
 There is a bowling green with two     
 greens, a pitch 'n put course and a   
 putting green.                        
 There are four tennis courts and      
 facilities for table tennis and       
 trampolining, with a play area for    
 children. The park is beside the sea. </content>
