		<title>16IMPACT OF OPENCAST MINING</title>
		<content> KINNINMONTH FARMHOUSE WAS BUILT TEN   
 YEARS AGO WHEN THE OLD FARMHOUSE WAS  
 COVERED BY OVERBURDEN FROM THE        
 WESTFIELD OPENCAST.THE OLD FARMHOUSE  
 WAS FOUR OR FIVE TIMES BIGGER THAN THE
 NEW ONE WHICH IS WARMER AND MORE      
 CONVENIENT TO MANAGE.                 
  ORIGINALLY THE FARM LOST ABOUT 108   
 ACRES BUT THE FARMER SAYS HE IS LOSING
 MORE LAND ALL THE TIME.AS YET HE HAS  
 NOT RECEIVED ANY COMPENSATION.DURING  
 OPERATIONS ABOUT 50m OF OVERBURDEN WAS
 REMOVED AND THE THICK COALSEAMS WERE  
 WORKED IN THREE STAGES,HEADING NORTH  
 UNTIL KINNINMONTH FARM WAS REACHED.   
  MINING IN THE AREA ROUND HAS CEASED  
 AND EVENTUALLY THE OPENCAST WILL BE   
 PARTIALLY INFILLED WITH THE OVERBURDEN
 THE PROBLEM REMAINING FOR THE FARMER  
 AT KINNINMONTH IS WHEN WILL HIS LAND  
 BE REINSTATED?                        
                                       </content>
