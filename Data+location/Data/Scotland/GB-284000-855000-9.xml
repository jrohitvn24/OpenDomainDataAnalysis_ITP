		<title>09NAIRN:THE BEACH</title>
		<content>    Nairn's beach is very important for
 recreation for locals and visitors.It 
  spreads along to the North- West     
 where the{golf course}faces out to the
 Black Isle.The beach is{sand-stone    
 rock covered in seaweed.The{council   
 has dumped large rocks at the shore to
 stop the sea eroding it.              
   From the{Golf club house}there runs 
 a{sewage pipe}which flows out to the  
 sea.Near the golf club there is an old
{sand-stone}quarry once used for       
 building.A path runs along the beach. 
 It is quite new as bad{storms}last    
 year eroded the old one.              
  To the East,the swimming pool area   
 used to be a sand-stone quarry,now a  
 picnic area with a putting green and  
 two public toilets. This part of the  
 beach is sandier and the council have 
 dumped rocks here as well,though most 
 of them are covered in sand.          </content>
