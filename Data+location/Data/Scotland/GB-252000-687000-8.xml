 netball and compete for local trophies
 with the other rural{primaries.       
    Some pupils learn to play the      
 recorder and take part in the Day of  
 Recorders, while others learn modern  
 or Scottish Country Dancing. The choir
 competes in the Falkirk Festival of   
 Music each year and has won first     
 prize on several occasions.           
    The High School is a rural, fully- 
 comprehensive{Secondary School}with 10
 "feeder" schools. In this decade, when
 falling rolls are the general rule,   
 Balfron High School is the exception, 
 with about 750 pupils at present and  
 an expected increase in the future.   
    The original{school building}dates 
 back to 1880's and the newest part was
 completed in 1982. Accommodation is   
 still inadequate and the playground   
 contains 16 temporary classrooms.     </content>
