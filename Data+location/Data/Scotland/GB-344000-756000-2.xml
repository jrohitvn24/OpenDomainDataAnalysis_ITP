{The old school stood in the centre of 
{the village close by the mill.The old 
{school building is now used as a      
{private house.There used to be a lade 
{in the Bog Burn.This lade powered the 
{Meal Mill which stood at the junction 
{of the Bog Burn and the South Esk.    
{ Tannadice was once a thriving        
{village.Most of the villagers worked  
{for the nearby farmers.The village    
{population exceeded one hundred people
{at the turn of the century but today  
{only about thirty residents           
{remain.Today Tannadice is a           
{picturesque but sleepy village on a   
{quiet country road,the B957 which     
{meets the main North-South trunk      
{route,the A94,a mile to the east of   
{the village. }
