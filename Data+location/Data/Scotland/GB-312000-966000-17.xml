		<title>17MY COMPUTER GAMES by Suzanne</title>
		<content>   Computer games are very popular and 
 I spend a lot of time playing them at 
 home.                                 
  {'Hangman'}is a spelling game in     
 which you choose one of eight groups  
 of words. After choosing, several     
 dashes come up on the screen and you  
 have to guess the letters in the word.
 You only get nine chances before you  
 are hanged.                           
  {'Bat and Ball'}is similar to tennis.
 You get a little ball that moves about
 the screen and you have to hit it.    
  {'Dare devil Denis'}is a brilliant   
 game. The player  is Denis. First of  
 all Denis is skiing, then on a bike   
 and lastly on a speed boat. He has to 
 go as fast as he can jumping and      
 avoiding obstacles on a course. As    
 levels are completed harder courses   
 are tackled including ones with       
 policemen who try to stop Denis.      </content>
