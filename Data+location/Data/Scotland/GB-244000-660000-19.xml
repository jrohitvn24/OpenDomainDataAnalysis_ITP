		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE OF</title>
		<content> On Wednesday I got up at 6am. I had my
 breakfast, Weetabix and toast, and got
 dressed. I took my dog out for a walk 
 and tidied my room when I came in. At 
 8.30am I set off for school and met my
 pal on the way.                       
 Registration is at 9am and the first  
 lesson starts at 9.05am, Maths on     
 Wednesdays. Each period lasts 1 hour  
 and I have 3 classes in the morning   
 and 2 in the afternoon with lunch in  
 between from 12.25 - 1.15pm.I bought  
 my lunch at the shop across from the  
 school. I don't like school dinners.  
 On my way home in the evening I went  
 into Glenburn Library and borrowed a  
 book about 'The Hardy Boys',a         
 detective mystery. After I got changed
 I cut the grass in the garden and I   
 got 50p for doing it. After tea at    
 5.30pm I went out to play on my bike. 
 I went to bed at 10.30pm.             </content>
