		<title>05CAIRNEYHILL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Cairneyhill is an old linear          
 settlement on the main Dunfermline to 
 Kincardine Bridge Road. However in    
 recent years the character of         
 Cairneyhill has been drastically      
 changed with the growth of new housing
 estates which have brought in large   
 numbers of young married couples and  
 their families. Building is still     
 going on in the village, but problems 
 of drainage, which have in the past   
 caused flooding to a large part of one
 of the new estates, will probably     
 ensure that little more development   
 will occur. Residents say it is a     
 neighbourly village, and proof of this
 is shown in their recent efforts to   
 raise thousands of pounds to send a   
 local boy, Ian Skinner, to America, to
 enable him to have a life saving      
 operation.                            
                                       </content>
