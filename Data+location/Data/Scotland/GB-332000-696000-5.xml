		<content> East Wemyss has had a connection with 
 the production of cloth for centuries.
 The manufacture of linen was both the 
 most important industry and the       
 largest employer of men and women     
 until the development of the coal     
 mining industry in the late 1800s.    
 From 1750 linen manufacture became the
 main industry of East Wemyss and was  
 carried out mostly in the home with   
 hand operated looms. The Johnston     
 brothers established their linen      
 manufacturing business in East Wemyss 
 in 1828. The factory is still in      
 operation today employing 160 people. 
 Linen is still the principle fibre,   
 although in some of the fabrics linen 
 is blended with newer man-made fibres 
 to produce the hard wearing materials 
 the company now specialises in. The   
 factory is now owned by a Dundee firm 
 and called Wemyss Weavecraft.         </content>
