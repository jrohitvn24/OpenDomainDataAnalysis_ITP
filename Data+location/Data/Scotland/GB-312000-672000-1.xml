    The area is dominated by Edinburgh 
 Airport whose main runway almost      
 halves the block in a south-west to   
 north-east direction.This runway was  
 extended in the mid 1970's and the old
 Newbridge School which served the     
 villages of Newbridge and Ratho       
 Station was replaced by Hillwood      
 School,officially opened in June      
 1976.The other main village in the    
 block is Kirkliston. The Royal        
 Highland Showground is the permanent  
 home of the most important            
 agricultural show in Scotland. Modern 
 industrial sites have been developed  
 to provide local employment. Factories
 include a combine manufacturer's, a   
 home security firm, a multiple fruit  
 supplier which serves many of         
 Edinburgh's supermarkets, a whisky    
 bond and a chicken factory.           </content>
