		<title>14THE STORY OF CULBIN</title>
		<content> Culbin was a very rich and fertile    
 estate, so productive it was called   
 the Granary of Moray.In the 1660's    
 great Sandunes built up off           
 Culbin.Steadely the sand was blown    
 over Culbin until almost all the      
 Estate was covered, to a great depth  
 at some points, by sand and sand      
 hills.Farms, cottages, walls, fields  
 and the Manor House were all          
 covered. The sand deserts covered an  
 area 6 miles long by 2 miles wide at  
 places.Culbin sands was known as a    
 silent eerie place constantly changing
 with each storm.Reclamation started in
 the mid 1800's with tree planting     
 round the edges.In 1922 the Forestry  
 Commission started planting Culbin.To 
 protect the young trees cut branches  
 were placed butt end towards the      
 prevailing wind in the sand.Now there 
 is a large forest.                    </content>
