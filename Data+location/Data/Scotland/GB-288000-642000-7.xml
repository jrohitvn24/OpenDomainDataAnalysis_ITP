 Over the past five years there has    
 been an increased awarness in the     
 District Council about the need to    
 stimulate {Tourism}with the           
 appointment of a Tourist Manager in   
 charge of Clydesdale ,Hamilton and    
 Motherwell Districts. This move has   
 resulted in more visitors to the area 
 in particular to {New Lanark},which is
 known internationally as one of the   
 most important places for the         
 development of industrial relations.  
 In Lanark itself tourists usually come
 to view the {Lanimers }or simply to do
 their shopping.Some potential to      
 attract tourists to Lanark has been   
 lost due to the lack of a             
 museum.Finally on the subject of {    
{Tourism }mention must be made of the  
 fine walks around Lanark Loch and the 
 Race Course.                          </content>
