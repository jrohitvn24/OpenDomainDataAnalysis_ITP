		<content> The second land use in the area is {  
{FORESTRY.}Approximately 350 hectares  
 of land owned by the FORESTRY         
 COMMISSION lies within this section.  
 The main trees grown are Sitka spruce,
 Norway spruce,European larch and      
 lodge-pole pine. The forest was first 
 planted in 1930.  Since then trees in 
 various stages of growth are tended.  
 First returns on capital outlay are   
 thinnings sold as Christmas trees or  
 contracted out to wood-merchants for  
 the highest bid.                      
 Seeds culled in autumn just before the
 cones open are sent to  laboratories  
 to be tested for viability,then sown  
 and reared for two years in nurseries.
 The two year old plants in this forest
 however come from America/Canada.     
 A forester can plant about 1000 trees 
 per day.About 240000 trees are planted
 in the Gartly area per year.          </content>
