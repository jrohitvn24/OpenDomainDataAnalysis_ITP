		<title>05THE CLIFFS</title>
		<content> Cliffs mark the Northern edge of      
 St.Andrews from the Golf Links        
 eastwards to the Castle and beyond.   
 They are made of sandstone with layers
 of shale. At present the sea is       
 undercutting them and there was a     
 substantial rock fall two years ago   
 about 300 yards East of the Step Rock 
 Pool. The cost of protecting them     
 from further erosion is very high and 
 Fife Regional Council has so far      
 declined to accept financial          
 responsibility for this. Geological   
 study suggests that after further     
 erosion of about 10 yards the cliffs  
 should stabilize naturally and that   
 the houses on the cliff top are in no 
 immediate danger. There is a cave,    
 accessible at low tide, called the    
 Piper's Cave which is said to haunted 
 by a phantom piper.
