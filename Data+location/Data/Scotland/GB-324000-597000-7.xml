		<content> A backward glance over the past decade
 highlights the vast growth of the     
 forestry industry in south western    
 Scotland and particularly Eskdalemuir.
 Its intrusion "sounded the death-knell
 of many hill farms with darkened      
 landscapes and abandoned houses       
 derelict in an ocean of trees."       
  This gloomy picture of a sheep       
 farming region turned forest has been 
 considerably lightened by the         
 knowledgeable management of the       
 Economic Forestry Group of large      
 investments of private companies and  
 individuals in some 15000 hectares of 
 poor hill terrain.                    
  The area was considered ideal for    
 good growth of Silka Spruce ,about 80%
 of the trees being of this type.The   
 majority of plantations are fertilised
 by aircraft to this end Eskdalemuir   
 has a small airstrip.                 </content>
