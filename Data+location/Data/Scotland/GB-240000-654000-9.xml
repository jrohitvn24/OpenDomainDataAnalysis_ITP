   Mrs. Black lives in the sheltered   
 housing in the village.Her day begins 
 with breakfast and the Glasgow Herald.
 By bus she goes to the chiropodist in 
 the Health Centre in Barrhead,then    
 along to the chemist or Presto for    
 some shopping.Next she goes to the    
 chippie for a cup of tea till her son 
 comes to pick her up.                 
   At home she reads,listens to Radio 4
 or watches television,any programmes. 
   If she is at home in the morning she
 might go to a coffee morning in the   
 church.On Sundays she goes to church. 
   Her one hobby is gardening when the 
 weather is suitable.                  
   What annoys her is when the big boys
 come and play football on the grass in
 front of her house,or start shouting.
