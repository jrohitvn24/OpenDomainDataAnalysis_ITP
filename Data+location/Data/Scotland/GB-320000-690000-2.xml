		<title>02COMMENT ON AUCHTERTOOL</title>
		<content>                                       
 The village of Auchtertool has been   
 described "as a place everyone passes 
 through and nobody stops". This must  
 have been true at the end of 19th     
 century when the American             
 Ornithologist Alexander Wilson visited
 the parish and wrote a poem about his 
 experience.                           
   My March I pursued,                 
   Till I came to a hill top, where    
                     joyfully I viewed.
   Surrounded by mountains and many a  
                            white pool.
   The small working village of old    
                           Auchtertool.
   An inn I inquired out and lodging   
                               desired.
   But the landlady's pertness seemed  
                      instantly fired .
   For she saucy replied as she sat    
                          carding wool.</content>
