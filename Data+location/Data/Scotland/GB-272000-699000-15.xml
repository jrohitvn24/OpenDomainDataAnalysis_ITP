		<content>  We asked householders in Doune to    
 fill in a questionnaire so that we    
 could find out{how many people        
{actually worked in the village itself 
{or the immediate area,}and to         
 discover{how far people travelled.}As 
 we expected, a very small percentage  
 actually work locally. Most travelled 
 to the following places daily,        
{Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Stirling  
 and the other surrounding towns.      
 Generally these were to electrical and
 chemical linked companies. We were    
 surprised to find out that many men   
 travelled from here to the North of   
 England and all over Scotland to      
 represent their firms. Some people    
 work locally on the big estates of    
 Moray and Argaty where they tend sheep
 and cattle. Most of the female workers
 find employment in Stirling and       
 Falkirk or in local shops.            </content>
