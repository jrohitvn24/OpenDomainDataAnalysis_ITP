		<title>10Attitudes</title>
		<content>  A survey carried out by the pupils to
 test attitudes showed that the        
 majority of people preferred country  
 life to town life. Among the reasons  
 given were fresh air, freedom and     
 space. Although there are fewer       
 facilities in the country, people     
 prefer to travel to work, shop, and   
 even follow leisure activities.       
   Concern was expressed at the smaller
 number of farm jobs, which was forcing
 young people with families to leave   
 the area and causing a decline in the 
 school rolls.                         
   There was also concern about the    
 decrease in bus services, and some    
 dissatisfaction with the present      
 system of local government compared   
 with the former county councils.
