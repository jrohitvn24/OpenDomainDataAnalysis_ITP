		<title>17Transport in Pitreavie.</title>
		<content> In our area there is quite good       
 transport.  We have one railway       
 station in the south of our grid,     
 which handles forty-three trains every
 twenty-four hours, except for coal    
 trains.  There are 11 bus sevices in  
 this area, 5 follow Queensferry Road  
 and the others link housing estates   
 with the City of Dunfermline.         
 There are lots of private buses used  
 for taking people to work and there is
 a free service to the supermarket as  
 well as buses to Perth and the north  
 and some buses to England. A lot of   
 people are now hiring mini-buses to   
 suit their life styles.
