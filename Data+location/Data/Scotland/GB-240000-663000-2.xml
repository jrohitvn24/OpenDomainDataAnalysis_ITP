		<title>02Lilias Day in Kilbarchan.</title>
		<content>{Lilias Day}is a historical pageant    
 which takes place on the first        
 Saturday in June each year.{Baron     
{William Cunningham }named it Lilias   
 Day in honour of his daughter of that 
 name. A colourful parade of historical
 groups and decorated lorries moves    
 through the village to the steeple    
 where it is joined by the legendary   
 piper {Habbie Simpson.}When the parade
 reaches the park, the School Queen who
 has been chosen by the pupils of      
 Primary 7 is crowned by Miss Lilias.  
 Miss Lilias then declares Lilias Day  
 open.In the park there are stalls     
 where you can buy or win things.There 
 are also competitions going on        
 throughout the day, and events to     
 watch in the arena. At night people   
 walk in procession  to the steeple to 
 see Habbie return to his resting place
 until Lilias Day next year.           </content>
