		<title>11EMPLOYMENT AND THE Y.T.S.</title>
		<content>    The unemployment rate in our area  
 is about 1/3.  This can cause problems
 because there are few amenities here. 
   The nearest job centres are in      
 Easterhouse and Parkhead.  There are  
 more young people working than older, 
 because of the{Youth Training Scheme. 
 66% of those on the Y.T.S. are given a
 permanent job at the end of their     
 time.  If they do not accept a Y.T.S. 
 place they have little chance of a    
 job.  Less than 5% people get jobs    
 through relatives.                    
   We could stop unemployment from     
 going up by asking the government for 
 money to fix the roads.  The          
 government has little to do with the  
 Y.T.S, they just give them money if   
 they need it.  It is the Manpower     
 Services Commission which runs the    
 Y.T.S.
