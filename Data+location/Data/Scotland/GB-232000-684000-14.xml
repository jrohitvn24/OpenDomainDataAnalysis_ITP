		<title>14Roads of Arden</title>
		<content> The A82 is the main road in Arden.    
 Two smaller roads lead off it, the    
 B831 and the B832.  They both meet at 
 the Cross Keys.  The A82 is a trunk   
 road.  It was built about 1746 by     
 Major Caulfield because the Jacobites 
 were causing trouble.   The A82 is a  
 twisty road.   It has very nice       
 scenery, cottages and farms.   In a   
 few years time it is going to be      
 widened and straightened because it is
 too narrow and twisty for the big     
 lorries, coaches and holiday traffic. 
 The Glen Fruin road is a narrow road  
 with passing places.  There is a local
 service bus which runs along the A82  
 from the Vale of Leven to Luss and    
 back six times a day.There are also   
 three long distance buses which each  
 run three times a day in both         
 directions.                           
                                       </content>
