		<title>18EDUCATION TODAY: DUNDONALD</title>
		<content>  Children in the village of Dundonald 
 begin their school career at the local
 Primary School when they are five     
 years old. After seven years they will
 have to travel to the nearby town of  
 Troon to continue their education at  
 the local secondary school, Marr      
 College.                              
  The present Dundonald Primary School 
 was built in 1897 but as the          
 population of the village increased,  
 additions and improvements have been  
 made in the way of new classrooms,a   
 modern kitchen and a gymnasium. The   
 present number of pupils is about 324 
 but this number is slowly dropping    
 year by year and the number of classes
 and teachers becoming less.It is a    
 fact that there are now more          
 pensioners in the village than        
 children of primary school age!
