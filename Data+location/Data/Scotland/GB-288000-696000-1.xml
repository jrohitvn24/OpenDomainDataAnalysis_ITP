		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO ALVA</title>
		<content> The area covered by this section is   
 situated in Central{Scotland,}7 miles 
 east of Stirling and approximatly 40  
 miles from both Edinburgh and Glasgow.
  Almost half the{landscape}in the     
 section is taken up by the Ochil Hills
 which dominate this part of Scotland. 
 They are made up of rock,gorse,and    
 rough grazing,except for Wood         
 Hill.About another third is arable    
 land,which extends south from the foot
 of the Ochils.Parts of two{settlements
 come into the section.                
  At the western end is the burgh of   
 Alva and at the eastern end is        
 Tillicoultry.Burns rising in the      
 Ochils run through deep glens and     
 eventually join the River Devon,a     
 tributary of the{River Forth.}
