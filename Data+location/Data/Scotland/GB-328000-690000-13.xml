		<title>13LINKS MARKET</title>
		<content> The Links Market started in 1305 as a 
 trading market. At that time it was   
 called the Spring Fair. It was held on
 the links along what is now the       
 Esplanade. People from all over came  
 to buy and sell their goods.          
 The Links Market now is the biggest   
 street market in Europe.              
 There are very few trading stalls now 
 and it is purely for fun. There are   
 about 60 large machines such as the   
 meteorite and speedway; about 150     
 stalls and about 30 roundabouts for   
 children under five. The Market is    
 about one mile long on both sides of  
 the Esplanade.                        
 The hobby horses, about 80 years old, 
 are the oldest roundabout: they were  
 renovated a year ago. Most popular    
 among young people are the big        
 machines. About 100,000 people come   
 during the six days it is in Kirkcaldy</content>
