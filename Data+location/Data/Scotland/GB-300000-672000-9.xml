		<title>09ARCHERY and CLIMBING.</title>
		<content> The facilities for outdoor sports at  
 our local Country Park are very good. 
 One can try target or field           
 archery,rock_climbing,canoeing,sailing
 ,fishing or orienteering.The target   
 archery is hidden in the woods.there  
 are 12 targets and distances are from 
 10 to 90 metres.                      
  The area has been felled and covered 
 with grass.It is fenced off so that   
 passers_by are not hurt by wild       
 arrows.Field archery is in a fairly   
 thickly wooded area which is          
 completely fenced off from the public.
   Rockclimbing is another activity.   
 The climb is in a half man made and   
 half natural quarry. The rock face has
 a place called a chimney and one has  
 to climb up to the top and try and    
 haul oneself up and stand up.         
 Instructors take groups of six people 
 for three hours at a time.            </content>
