		<content> There are supposed to be{ghosts}in    
 the{dungeons}of Law Castle. There is  
 also a{tunnel}from the castle which   
 leads down to the shore.However the   
 tunnel is impassible due to a build up
 of water.{Law  Castle}is said to be   
 haunted by an  archer. He was         
 fighting a battle when suddenly an    
 arrow with a white handkerchief tied  
 to the end of it came shooting at him 
 from nowhere.The arrow  went through  
 his neck, embedding itself in the wall
 behind. He comes at night and if you  
 see him with a white handkerchief in  
 his hand it means he is challenging   
 you to a fight.                       
 The back road that leads down to      
 Seamill  is{haunted}by an old man. He 
 comes out at night, dressed in black  
 and carrying an old walking stick. If 
 you flash your car lights on him he   
 will disappear.                       </content>
