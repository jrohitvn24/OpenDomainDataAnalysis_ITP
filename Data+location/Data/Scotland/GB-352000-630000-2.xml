		<title>02BOWDEN VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Bowden is a small village with        
 a population of approx. 200.There     
 are marginally more old people than   
 young.The village is a designated     
 conservation area with the majority of
 the houses grouped around the         
 village green.                        
 There are very few facilities.There is
 a small general store/post office     
 selling most necessities except bread 
 and meat,although twice a week        
 there are butchers and bakers vans.The
 mobile library calls once a week with 
 a comprehensive selection of books. As
 there is no train service and the bus 
 service is local and not very         
 frequent,it is necessary for most     
 families to provide their own         
 transport particularly if they wish to
 travel to the larger centres of       
 population.
