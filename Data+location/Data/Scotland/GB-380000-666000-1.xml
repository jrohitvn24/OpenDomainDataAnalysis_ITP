		<title>01Penmanshiel Moor,Grantshouse</title>
		<content> The general appearance of the area is 
 predominated by Penmmanshiel          
 moor,which lies 800 ft above sealevel.
 The moor itself extends 9m above      
 settlement of Grantshouse and is      
 relatively flat with high levels of   
 soil water, making the ground very    
 boggy. The semi natural vegetation on 
 the moor, includes several types of   
 mosses and heaths, which attract a    
 variety of wildlife. The predominant  
 feature of the area is the fine view  
 across the eye valley to the Lamermuir
 hills due to its relatively high      
 location and moorland vegetation, the 
 predominant land uses are sheep       
 grazing. The only farm within the area
 is Howpark, situated in the valley of 
 Howpark Burn, where best land of the  
 area is situated.
