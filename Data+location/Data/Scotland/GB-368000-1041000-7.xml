		<title>07MUSIC TEACHER</title>
		<content>{Mrs McArthur}is an 84 year old music  
 teacher who teaches nearly 30 pupils  
 for violin lessons and 1 for piano    
 lessons. She teaches every day except 
 Sunday and all day Saturday.          
                                       
 Her small orchestra meets every week  
 and consists of all the pupils.It is  
 called{"Strings and Things".}Annual   
 concerts are held every summer and    
 Christmas. The orchestra has also     
 performed the{Toy Symphony,}by Haydn, 
 in Kirkwall and has taken part in the 
 Orkney folk festival.                 
                                       
 There are{examinations}held every     
 summer with an examiner coming from   
 the south of England.It is cheaper to 
 pay an examiner's expenses than to    
 send all of the pupils to Kirkwall.
