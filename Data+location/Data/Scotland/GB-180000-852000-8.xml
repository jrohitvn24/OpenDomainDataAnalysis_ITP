		<title>08CHURCHES OF SHIELDAIG</title>
		<content>    THE CHURCH HAS ALWAYS PLAYED AN    
 IMPORTANT PART IN HIGHLAND LIFE.      
 THIS CAN BE SEEN BY THE NUMBER OF     
 CHURCHES IN SMALL VILLAGES SUCH AS    
 SHIELDAIG.                            
 SHIELAIG HAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN    
 CHURCH HISTORY.   IN 1877 A           
 PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH WAS BUILT IN THE  
 VILLAGE.   THE FIRST MINISTER REV. D. 
 MACDONALD OPPOSED THE ACT OF          
 UNIFORMITY OF THE CHURCH IN 1895.   HE
 WAS ASKED TO LEAVE THE CHURCH AND     
 MANSE. FROM THEN ON HE HELD HIS       
 SERVICES BEHIND A LARGE WALL, STILL TO
 BE SEEN BESIDE THE SCHOOL.  A FREE    
 PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH WAS BUILT IN 1897.
    THE OLD CHURCH WAS NEVER AGAIN USED
 FOR SERVICES AND HAD A LIFE OF ONLY   
 TWENTY YEARS.   IT IS NOW A GARAGE.   
   THE VILLAGE ALSO HAS A CHURCH OF    
 SCOTLAND, BUT NEITHER CHURCH HAS A    
 RESIDENT MINISTER.                    </content>
