   The Hamilton-Strathaven line which  
 joined Meikle Earnock, Blantyre, etc. 
 was closed in 1964. So the nearest    
 railway station to our area is        
 Hamilton Central approximately 2 miles
 to the north.                         
{BUS ROUTES}                           
   The area is crossed by a number of  
 bus routes. Four separate bus routes  
 to Strathaven use the A723. Another   
 leaves Meikle Earnock and goes through
 Hamilton to Coatbridge.  A long dista-
 nce coach from Edinburgh to Kilmarnock
 also uses the A723.                   
   Two services join Eddlewood to      
 Hamilton, then Glasgow. The other     
 areas have local services running     
 through them.                         
   Most people interviewed were "happy"
 with public transport.
