		<content>{Town Yetholm}and{Kirk Yetholm,}two    
 delightful villages set in a valley,  
 under the Cheviot Hills, on either    
 side of the{Bowmont Water}are grouped 
 round pleasant greens and right on the
 border with England at the end of the 
{Pennine Way.                          
 The former, larger and more built up  
 supports the only shops but the area  
 as a whole has suffered the           
 curtailment of services which has     
 affected most rural areas. One shop, a
 public house and police station being 
 the most recent casualties. Kirk      
 Yetholm, the former capital of the    
 scots gypsies, is situated at the end 
 of the{Pennine Way}and is quieter and 
 more rural. The area itself is one    
 with a great wealth of beauty, rich in
 wild-life and folklore with some of   
 the best picnic sites imaginable      
 amongst marvellous rural countryside. </content>
