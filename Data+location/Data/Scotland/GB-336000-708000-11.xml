		<title>11WALK AND NATURE TRAIL</title>
		<content> There was once a Craighall Castle but 
 its ruins were a danger to the public 
 and they were demolished. The site of 
 the former Castle and the Den around  
 it have were gifted some years ago to 
 the District Council and have been    
 made into a pleasant walk and nature  
 trail. There is a Car Park at the     
 entrance to the Den and copies of a   
 booklet about it are available from   
 several places in the village of Ceres
 to which the Den belongs rather than  
 to Craigrothie.
