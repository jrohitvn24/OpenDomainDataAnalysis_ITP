		<title>05INCHBRAKIE CASTLE 2</title>
		<content>     On the day of the{witch burning   
 the laird of Inchbrakie tried to save 
 her but his attempts were to no avail.
  The fire was lit and she bit a blue  
 bead from her necklace and said that  
 as long as it was kept within the     
 walls of Inchbrakie the estate would  
 not be alienated.                     
     After a few years, the bead, which
 has been made into a ring, was found  
 in another house and the first sites  
 of the estate were sold.  Now there is
 no longer an{Inchbrakie Estate.
