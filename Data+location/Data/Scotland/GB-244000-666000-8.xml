		<title>08THE LIFE OF A PEDIGREE EGG</title>
		<content> My name is Engelbert.I am only a few  
 hours old.I reside at a well known egg
 farm near Inchinnan.There are 5000    
 hens one of whom is my mother,but I   
 was snatched away from her in the     
 first seconds of my life.I am a       
 pedigree egg who is not reluctant to  
 rub shells with the lower grades of   
 eggs.                                 
    Sometimes I feel sorry for the     
 farmer as he has to rise at 6.30am and
 he goes to bed about 9.30pm.          
    Most eggs only live for a few      
 weeks,and my time is nearly up.       
    Some fruit is grown on the         
 premises,including strawberries,but I 
 have no contact with the fruit of the 
 farm.There are also odd looking sheep.
 I think they are called Jacobs,from   
 the Middle East.
