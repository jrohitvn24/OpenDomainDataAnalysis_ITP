		<content> Scallops. These are shellfish which   
 are caught by putting a frame with a  
 net on it (called a 'dreg') into the  
 water behind a boat. It is pulled     
 along and it picks up the scallops    
 from the bottom of the sea. Scallop   
 fishing is mainly a part-time job.    
 Mink. There is a mink-farm in Aith. It
 is a one person business. The man who 
 runs it has about 300 mink which he   
 rears to sell for their skins. The    
 skins are sent to the mainland to be  
 made into coats etc.                  
 Sheepskins. One person cures          
 sheepskins to sell. About 1500 are    
 made per year. The average price is   
 about Â£18 but coloured ones are more  
 expensive.
