		<title>14A FERRET PET IN MILTON.</title>
		<content>     In towns,dogs,cats and fish may be
 kept as pets,but village home life is 
 different.A boy in Milton has a pet   
 ferret.It is thin like a weasel,it's  
{body}being 35cms long and it's tail   
 12cms,and it has creamy fur,a pointed 
{face}and pink{eyes.}A clean hutch in  
 the garden is it's{home.}The owner,an 
 18 year old boy,{feeds}it bread and   
 milk with a little meat.Ferrets are   
 not suitable pets for young children  
 because they can be{vicious. }        
   This one is a good{rabbit hunter.}It
 is taken to the wood,muzzled and put  
 down a rabbit warren.The ferret chases
 the rabbits and when one pops out a   
 hole,the boy shoots it with his gun.He
 skins the poor rabbit and either feeds
 it to his dog or gets his mother to   
 make it into rabbit stew.Sometimes a  
 ferret will escape and become{wild.}It
 will then kill chickens and hens.     </content>
