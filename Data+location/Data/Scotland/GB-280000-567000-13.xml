		<content> Fishing is a very popular pastime in  
 our area. To kit you out you would    
 need about Â£100. Also you would need  
 permission to fish in a stretch of    
 water. That means you would need to   
 buy a permit which costs between Â£5   
 for a junior and Â£12 for an adult. The
 fines you can get are your permit     
 taken away, tackle confiscated or a Â£5
 fine for a Junior. When lead weights  
 fall off the line they are swallowed  
 by swans which causes lead poisining. 
 The new weights are made of tungsten. 
 The job of the Water Bailiff is to    
 keep poachers off the water and to    
 check that people have their permits. 
 The best places to fish in the area   
 are the Mill at Springholm and the    
 waterfall at the Glen of Spottes. The 
 kind of fish in our water-ways are    
 salmon, rainbow trout, brown trout,   
 seatrout, perch and eel.              </content>
