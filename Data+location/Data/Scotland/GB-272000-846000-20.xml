		<content> Our class enjoy playing records in    
 their spare time.  Favourite pop stars
 include Midge Ure, Madonna, Bruce     
 Sprintstein, Sister Sledge, Queen and 
 Tina Turner. 'In' things at the moment
 are training shoes and Kickers and    
 many boys would like Dr Martin boots. 
 Hairstyles include Mohican, crew cuts 
 and streaked and highlighted hair     
 (although nobody has any of these!) . 
 BMX bikes, Walkman stereos and snooker
 tables are also popular. Many children
 have hand held electronic games (Manic
 Miner, Firefox, U-boat) and some have 
 computers, these include Dragon 32,   
 Vic 20, Commodore 64, Spectrum Plus   
 and Acorn Electron.
