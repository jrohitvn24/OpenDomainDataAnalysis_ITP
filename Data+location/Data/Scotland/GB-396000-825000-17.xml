		<content> This is an open coastal area.It is    
 unpolluted.You can see this because of
 lichen growing on walls.It can be very
 windy because it is such an exposed   
 part of the coast.This also means     
 there are few trees.There are many    
 types of wild flowers.Here are the    
 species,Clover,Daisy,Rose Baywillow   
 Herb and Broom.

 Culterty.It is part of the Department 
 of Zoology.It started in 1958.It      
 researches in birds, mammals,fish and 
 small invertebrates.Culterty is well  
 known in the world of science.They try
 to find what controls the population  
 of animals.They set traps for small   
 animals.When they get them they weigh 
 and mark them.The most common small   
 mammal is the field vole microtus.The 
 rarest is the water shrew of which    
 only 2 have been caught.              </content>
