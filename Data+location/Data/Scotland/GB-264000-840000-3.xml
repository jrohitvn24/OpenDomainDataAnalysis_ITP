		<title>03FISHING AT NESS SIDE</title>
		<content>    Ness Side is a beautiful estate    
 with the River Ness flowing beside    
 it.At this part the river has several 
 salmon pools which belong to the owner
 of{NESS SIDE HOUSE.}                  
    From 16th January to 15th October  
 is the fishing season. We saw at Ness 
 Side House a fish larder,where        
 fishermen put the salmon on a cold    
 slab. Each salmon's weight, the name  
 of the fly which caught it, and the   
 fisherman's name are all recorded in a
 book.                                 
    If it weighs under 8 pounds it is  
 called a grilse. An average of 300    
 salmon are caught in a season. We saw 
 waders, rods and flies. Three boats   
 are used on this stretch of river.    
    We also saw a game larder for      
 hanging pheasants, ducks etc. It was  
 very cool.
