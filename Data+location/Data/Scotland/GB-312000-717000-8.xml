   There are two groups of housing in  
 B.ofE.First the houses built in the   
 local red sandstone during the 18th   
 and 19th century.These include single 
 storey cottages in rows;three storey  
 terrace houses and villas with        
 gardens,and larger detached houses    
 with big gardens.                     
   Recent housing,mostly built within  
 the last twenty years,in the form of  
 estates-both council and private.     
 Building is still going on.           
   There are 500 people in the new     
 housing in Kintillo.It is felt that   
 the community spirit is being ruined  
 by commuting incomers.
