		<content> Long ago in the mists of time, a boar 
 went devouring cattle and sheep. One  
 brave warrior from Ireland came to    
 look for the boar and he found it on  
 one of the faces of {Ben Loyal. }The  
 warrior and the boar started to fight.
 They fought on and on and then the    
 warrior lunged forward and drove his  
 sword deep into the boar's heart. The 
 great beast died instantly. It fell   
 down the rocky face, and as it fell , 
 it left a great scratch down the      
 mountainside. The warrior walked over 
 the beast to measure it, but he died  
 because the boar's poisonous bristles 
 pierced his feet.                     
 The mark can still be seen on the face
 of Ben Loyal and is known as the      
 Boar's Scratch.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
