		<title>06PLAYGROUND GAMES IN ALVES</title>
		<content> Some playground games boys play  are  
 football, British Bulldogs,hide and   
 seek and Cut the Cake. My favourites  
 are football and British Bulldogs. In 
 football we change the rules a bit.   
 There is only one goalmouth and one   
 goaly who is also the referee. There  
 are two teams which play each other   
 and when they stop playing the team   
 with the most goals wins.             
 British Bulldogs we play on the grass 
 because it is quite a rough game. One 
 person is "it", then he names someone 
 and that person tries to get past the 
 catcher. If he does get past the rest 
 of the people then charge. If the     
 catcher gets someone down that person 
 is then  a catcher too. This goes on  
 until everyone is caught.
