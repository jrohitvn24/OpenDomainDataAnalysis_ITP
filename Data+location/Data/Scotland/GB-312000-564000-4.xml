		<content>  Cummertrees Church belongs to the    
 Church of Scotland.We are joined with 
 Ruthwell and Mouswald.   Our minister 
 is called Mr Nichol.                  
 The last time we had a minister to    
 ourself was in 1969 and his name was  
 Mr Cowie. That was sixteen years ago. 
  The congregation is mainly older     
 people, but there is a Sunday School, 
 and a Woman's Guild.                  
  The building is a very simple one,but
 there is an interesting lych gate.
