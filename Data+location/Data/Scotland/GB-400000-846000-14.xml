		<title>14Kirsty's Weekend</title>
		<content> On Saturday morning,I woke up,early.I 
 had my breakfast and watched          
 television.After that I went to call  
 on my friend{Kelly.}She was still in  
 her pyjamas.After she got dressed we  
 went out to play and as usual we      
 played with the skateboard,the stilts 
 the rope,the crate and the little     
 ramp.First we played with the         
 skateboard.We tied the rope round {   
{Kelly's}waist and I pulled her down   
 the hill.{Kelly }ripped two of her    
 skirts but I only ripped one of mine. 
 So we stopped playing with the        
 skateboard.Then we went to play on the
 stilts.We had races and went up and   
 down the kerbs.Then it was time to go 
 to the school barbecue,I had a        
 hamburger.After that I went into {    
{Peterhead}to get a present for{Laura, 
 my friend{Johan's}sister.We went to   
 their house and stayed till 10.30. {  </content>
