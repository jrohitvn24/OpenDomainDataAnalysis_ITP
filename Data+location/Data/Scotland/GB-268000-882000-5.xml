		<title>05THE VILLAGE SHOP - EDDERTON</title>
		<content>{The Village Shop},the only one in the 
 village,is over 100 years old.It sells
{Confectionary,Food and General        
{Household Goods.}There is also a{Post 
{Office}in the shop.Three people       
 including the owners work there.They  
 all live in the village.It is open 7  
 hours a day but is closed on Wednesday
 and Saturday afternoon and all day    
 Sunday.Thursday is usually the busiest
 day because the pensions are paid that
 day.To stock the shop the owner goes  
 to Inverness to a cash and carry and  
 buys the goods in bulk.He also orders 
 over the telephone and has it         
 delivered to the shop by lorry.Most   
 people come to buy food.The problems  
 with running a small shop are not     
 enough trade,competition from the     
 supermarket in the towns,lack of      
 population and people wanting credit. 
 There is very little passing trade.   </content>
