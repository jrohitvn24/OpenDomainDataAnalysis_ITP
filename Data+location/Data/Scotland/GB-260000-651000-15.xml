		<title>15Events_E.K. Mini_marathon</title>
		<content> My dad has run the mini_marathon three
 times and has always finished it.It   
 is 12.2 miles long.It starts at the   
 Greenhills shops,and goes along the   
 Greenhills Road and into the country. 
 The runners jog along enjoying the    
 pleasant scenery.There is a wide range
 of ages from 16 years of age to over  
 50. Some just do it for fun but others
 treat it like a race.A lot of people  
 line the route cheering fathers,sons, 
 husbands,daughters,grampas,wives etc. 
 There are tables with cups of water   
 for the runners.At the tables the     
 Scouts help give out the water to     
 the runners.If you are hungry you can 
 get something to eat at the community 
 centre.Every person that completes the
 run will get a medal but the winner   
 gets a special medal,so does first    
 woman and first over 50.It is         
 enjoyable but exhausting.             </content>
