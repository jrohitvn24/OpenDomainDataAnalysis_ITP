		<content> Our block is situated in the part of  
 N.Scot. known as the Black Isle. This 
 is not a true island but is surrounded
 on three sides by the sea and on the  
 fourth side it is joined by a narrow  
 neck of land.The countryside is fairly
 flat, rising gradually from the       
 shoreline towards the hill known as   
 Mount High which is the highest part  
 of the Black Isle.It is a farming     
 community consisting of farmhouses    
 and cottages dotted about and a small 
 village, Jemimaville. The land is     
 mainly  used for agricultural         
 purposes with  some patches of mixed  
 woodland stretching to the Forestry   
 Commission plantations on the summit  
 of Mount High.
