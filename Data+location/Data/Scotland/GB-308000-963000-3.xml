 APART FROM GEISELITTLE FARM NEAR THE  
 A882 THE OTHER FARMS IN THE AREA ARE  
 OWNED BY ONE FAMILY.   THE FARMING IS 
 MAINLY CATTLE FARMING WITH CROPS GROWN
 FOR FEEDING.   THE MOST ARABLE LAND IS
 AT BUCKIES AND GEISELITTLE.   THE AREA
 IS GENERALLY POOR FARMING LAND AND THE
 LAND IS MOSTLY ROUGH GRAZING.   ALL   
 THE FARMERS HAVE COMMENTED ON THE     
 EXCEPTIONALLY BAD WEATHER THIS SUMMER 
 WHICH WAS THE WETTEST SUMMER RECORDED 
 AND EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE       
 RESULTING VERY BAD HARVEST.   CROPS   
 HAVE ROTTED IN THE FIELDS AND THIS    
 WILL RESULT IN LACK OF FODDER FOR THE 
 CATTLE OVER THE WINTER.
