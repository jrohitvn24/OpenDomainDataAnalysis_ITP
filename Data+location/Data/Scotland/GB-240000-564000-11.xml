		<title>11THE NEWTON STEWART CINEMA</title>
		<content>   Originally there were about five    
 cinemas in our area.Now there is only 
 the one in Newton Stewart left.       
   Our cinema has always been{privately
 owned.Like many other cinemas it is   
 struggling to stay in business.       
   Films are shown every evening{except
 Sunday and Monday but there are now no
 matinees.The same film may be on for  
 five days or even for as long as ten  
 days.                                 
   Each evening there is a short film  
 first,followed by local adverts and   
 then the main film.                   
   The admission for adults is Â£1 for  
 the stalls and Â£1.50 for the circle.  
 Children have to pay from 50p to Â£1.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
