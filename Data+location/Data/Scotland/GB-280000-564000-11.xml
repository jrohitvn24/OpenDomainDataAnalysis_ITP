		<content> I am a member of the Haugh of Urr     
 Guides and we meet every Wednesday    
 Night at 7.00 in the School.  There   
 are two packs called Swallows and     
 Robins.  I am in the Swallows.We have 
 recently completed a concert.  We were
 singing songs, acting comedy sketches 
 and presenting a fashion show.  We    
 also made our own crepe paper dresses 
 for the final song.  Our concert was  
 for funds so that we may go to the    
 county camp at Gatehouse of Fleet in  
 July.  There are other patrols coming 
 from all over Dumfries and Galloway.  
 When at the camp we will be taking    
 part in activities such as nature     
 trails, swimming, orienteering and    
 investigating history in local        
 graveyards.  These are the names of   
 the people that are in the Guides:-   
 WENDY, KIRSTY, LISA, ELAINE, LOUISE,  
 SIMONE and myself CLAIRE.             </content>
