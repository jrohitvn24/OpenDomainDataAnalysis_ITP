		<title>13Caledonian Canal: 1</title>
		<content>{The Canal and its use}                
      The Caledonian Canal passes      
 through Banavie. At this point it     
 rises (or falls, depending on         
 the direction of travel) 64 feet,     
 through a series of 8 locks known as  
 "Neptune's Staircase" - quite a feat  
 of engineering and a great tourist    
 attraction.                           
      The canal gets its water from the
 lochs it passes through and these are,
 in their turn, fed by the many        
 highland burns.                       
      The canal, at this point, employs
 only three men, and is not very busy. 
 During the summer months there is a   
 steady traffic of mainly tourist      
 yachts- around five yachts per day;   
 while in the winter only the          
 occassional fishing boat, saving      
 herself the trip around Cape Wrath,   
 makes the passage.                    </content>
