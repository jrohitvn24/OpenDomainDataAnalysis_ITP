 There are beaches, cliff walks and    
 country walks in this area for people 
 to enjoy.  Eyemouth has an indoor     
 swimming pool, a cinema which seats   
 200, a bowling club, golf club, tennis
 club, sub-aqua club, breakdance club  
 and squash club.  Boat trips can be   
 arranged, and permits are available   
 for fresh water fishing.  These       
 pastimes are enjoyed by tourists and  
 locals.  Other popular pastimes among 
 local men are going to the local pub  
 or brewing beer at home, watching tv, 
 gardening and D.I.Y.  Women enjoy     
 bingo, gardening, cooking, knitting   
 and sewing.  An example of local      
 sewing is to be seen in the form of a 
 tapestry commemorating the fishing    
 disaster of 1881.  It was completed in
 1981 and is on display in Eyemouth    
 Museum.                               </content>
