are the wool mills and the             
distilleries.There are three whisky    
distilleries in Keith-Strathisla,      
Glenkeith and Strathmill.My brother    
Paul,works  as a stock checker.His job 
is to check all the   warehouses in    
the Keith area to see that the casks of
whisky are all secure and that nothing 
is missing.Another friend who works in 
a distillery is Michael Donald.His job 
is rolling the casks onto lorries which
take the spirit away to be blended or  
bottled.Some distilleries in the local 
aea are being closed down because of a 
drop in the demand for whisky.         
There are two wool mills in Keith -    
Kynochs and Laidlaws.Mr.and Mrs.Donald
