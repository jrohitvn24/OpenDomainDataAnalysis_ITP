		<title>10EAGLESFIELD &amp; DISTRICT GALA</title>
		<content>  For fifty years at the beginning of  
 this century the village had its own  
 Eaglesfield Show on the first Saturday
 in September. As with many other small
{agricultural shows}this one gradually 
 petered out as more people got cars   
 enabling travel to the towns for      
 shopping and more sophisticated forms 
 of{entertainment.                     
  In 1972 the Eaglesfield &amp; District   
 Playing Field Association saw the     
 culmination of five years of          
 fund-raising with the opening of the  
{Playing Field,}which provided the     
 village with a football pitch and     
 childrens swings and chute(slide).    
  The fancy dress parade and sports    
 held that day became an annual event. 
 Within a few years a Gala committee   
 was formed to take over the running of
 these events, and the{festivities}were
 extended to become the present Gala.  </content>
