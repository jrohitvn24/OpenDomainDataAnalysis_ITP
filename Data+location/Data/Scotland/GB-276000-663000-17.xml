		<content> FROM OUR SURVEY WE DISCOVERED         
 INTERESTING FACTS ON HOW PEOPLE SPEND 
 THEIR LEISURE TIME. FOR EXAMPLE FEW   
 PEOPLE GO OFTEN TO THE CINEMA. THERE  
 APPEARED TO BE TWO REASONS FOR THIS.  
 FIRSTLY THE NEAREST CINEMA IS 12 MILES
 AWAY. THE SECOND REASON IS THE RISING 
 COST OF GOING THERE."IT'S TOO DEAR"   
 AND "IT'S TOO FAR AND TOO EXPENSIVE TO
 TRAVEL" WERE COMMON STATEMENTS. IT    
 WOULD APPEAR THAT IN AN AREA OF HIGH  
 UNEMPLOYMENT COST IS A BIG PROBLEM.   
 FOR SIMILAR REASONS FEW PEOPLE ATTEND 
 THE THEATRE. THE MOST POPULAR         
 ENTERTAINMENT WAS WATCHING TELEVISION 
 THOUGH NOT MANY WATCHED VIDEO FILMS.  
 GOING TO THE "PUB" WAS OBVIUOSLY A    
 POPULAR PASTIME. MANY MADE COMMENTS   
 LIKE "I CAN MEET MY FRIENDS" AND "IT  
 GIVES ME SOMEWHERE TO GO AWAY FROM THE
 HOUSE" BINGO WAS ALSO VERY POPULAR.
