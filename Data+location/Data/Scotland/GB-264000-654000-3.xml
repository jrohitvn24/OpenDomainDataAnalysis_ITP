		<content> EAST KILBRIDE AND THE CHURCH.         
    The local church provides many     
 activities for the community.These    
 include the SUNDAY SCHOOL and CHOIR.  
 "At 12 o'clock Mrs Shanks raises her  
 hands for quietness and we raise ours 
 to show that we are listening.Our     
 first hymn is"Lord Jesus,be Thou with 
 us now" Mrs Shanks goes on to read a  
 story from the BIBLE and later we go  
 into groups to answer questions and   
 colour the pictures in our Sunday     
 School book.At the end,one member     
 makes up a prayer and says it aloud.We
 say good_bye at 1pm and go home"      
 The Choir takes place on Friday nights
 and we practice songs for the operetta
 "Princess in Poppyland"  The actual   
 performance occurs in April and we    
 dress up in costumes and wear make-up.
 Our parents come to see us on stage.
