		<content> The post office has been in four      
 different places over the years. The  
 present postmistress has run it since 
 1968.It opens for business each day at
 9 o'clock and closes at 5.30pm.On     
 Thursday and Saturday the post office 
 is open only in the morning.On Sunday 
 it does not open at all.Stamps and    
 other supplies are sent from the Head 
 Office in Dumfries.                   
  The busiest day of the week is       
 Thursday, because that is pension day.
 The busiest time of year is before    
 Christmas.There is one delivery and   
 one collection of mail each day.There 
 is a danger that the post office in   
 our village may close because not many
 people use it.
