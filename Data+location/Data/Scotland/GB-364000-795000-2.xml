		<title>02INCHMARLO HOUSE</title>
		<content> Inchmarlo House, a listed{Georgian    
{building, }was formerly the Laird's   
 house on the estate of the same name. 
 It has beautiful woodland {gardens}and
 formal walled {gardens }adjoining it. 
 At present over 120 homes are being   
 built in the grounds for people of    
 retirement age.   The large house will
 be renovated to form a{health care}   
 and administration block.   A         
 bar,restaurant, lounges and community 
 facilities block are also being       
 constructed to create an almost       
 self_contained community for the      
 elderly in remarkably attractive      
 surroundings.   Inchmarlo will        
 therefore be catering for some of     
 Britain's growing number of older     
 people requiring a small, easily kept 
 home of their own with the added      
 security of staff at hand to help when
 an emergency occurs.                  </content>
