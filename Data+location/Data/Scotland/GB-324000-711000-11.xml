		<title>11PROPOSED 'MUCHTY BY_PASS</title>
		<content> An interview with Mr. E. Titterington,
 Liberal councillor for Auchtermuchty, 
 revealed that the proposed plan is to 
 develop a by_pass to the south of     
 Auchtermuchty. The new section of     
 road, to be started in 1987 or 1988,  
 will follow a line southwestwards from
 the existing A 91 at the lay_by at    
 Rossie, crossing fields belonging to  
 Rossie Farm and pass between the      
 cemetery and the factory (Russell PH  
 Electrodes Ltd.) and then crossing    
 what is locally called the 'Muchty    
 Green. A report is currently being    
 prepared by the Scottish Development  
 Department. The present A 91 road     
 through Auchtermuchty is very narrow  
 and twisty in places, with the houses 
 and vehicles in close proximity. Road 
 traffic management bans or restricts  
 the parking of vehicles along this    
 stretch of road.                      </content>
