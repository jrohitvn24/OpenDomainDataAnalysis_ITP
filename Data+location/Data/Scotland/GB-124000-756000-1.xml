		<title>01SECTION OF COLL COASTLINE</title>
		<content> This block contains a section of the  
 SE coast of the isle of Coll in the   
 Inner Hebrides. The percentage of land
 in the block is twenty percent. The   
 sea included in the block is part of  
 thr passage between Coll and Mull. the
 land is almost worthless bog, peat,   
 rock and heather, where sheep from    
 Gallawach farm on the north west coast
 of Coll are grazed in small numbers.  
 the history of the island shows that  
 this section of Coll was inhabited by 
 people who scratched a living fishing 
 and working the rough ground. Some    
 evidence of early nineteenth century  
 houses are still to be found which    
 were evacuated during the highland    
 clearances. Some birds nest on the    
 shore but this inhospitable           
 environment supports very little      
 wildlife.                             
                                       </content>
