		<content> I LIVE IN A PART OF CUMBERNAULD CALLED
 ABRONHILL. I LIVE ON THE TOP OF A     
 HILL.FROM MY HOUSE YOU CAN SEE THE    
 CAMPSIE FELLS.MOST OF THE HOUSES HAVE 
 MODERN DESIGNS. THE HOUSES ARE BIG,   
 THERE IS A LIVING ROOM,A DINING ROOM, 
 A KITCHEN, TWO TOILETS AND THREE      
 BEDROOMS IN EVERY HOUSE.OUTSIDE THERE 
 ARE SOME SHRUBS AND BUSHES WHICH MAKE 
 THE PLACE EVEN NICER. NEAR OUR HOUSE  
 THERE IS A SWING PARK.THERE ARE 6 BABY
 SWINGS AND SIX BIG SWINGS. THERE ARE  
 TWO CLIMBING FRAMES, ONE IS SHAPED    
 LIKE AN INDIAN TEEPEE. THE OTHER ONE  
 IS SHAPED LIKE A SPIDER, IT HAS A BIG 
 BODY WHICH YOU CAN SIT ON. THAT IS WHY
 WE NICK NAME THE PARK THE "SPIDER     
 SWINGS". AT THE BACK OF MY HOUSE THERE
 IS A WOOD WHICH IS GOOD FOR BUILDING  
 DENS. I HAVE A SHOPPING CENTRE NEAR MY
 HOUSE WHICH HAS 8 SHOPS IN IT.(NEW
