		<title>12DISCUSSION WITH A FARMER</title>
		<content> BUT WITH THE NEW TOWN OF GLENROTHES   
 COMING INTO BEING IN 1948 AND THUS    
 ITS GROWTH, THE AREA TO THE NORTH OF  
 GLENROTHES HAS BEEN USED TO HOUSE     
 PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST 15  
 YEARS THE INFLUX OF PEOPLE TO THIS    
 AREA HAS INCREASED.  MR BURGESS ALSO  
 SAYS THAT 30 YEARS AGO THERE WERE 6   
 LARGE FARMS - EACH ABOUT 1000 ACRES - 
 BUT NOW THERE ARE ONLY 3 SMALL FARMS -
 EACH ABOUT 300 ACRES - THIS IS DUE TO 
 THE EXPANSION OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN 
 THIS AREA.
