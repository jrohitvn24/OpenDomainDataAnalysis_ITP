		<content> On the 7th of November 1985  I        
 interviewed{Miss S. Macleod.          
 I asked her how long she has been     
 involved with{mail order shopping.}She
 said for nearly three years and said  
 that she uses{John Noble and Freemans.
 She has ten customers and sends       
 the money away every month. Then I    
 went on to ask her whether she        
 prefered personal shopping or mail    
 order. She answered immediately, "The 
 catalogues because you don't have to  
 go out of the house".                 
 Near the end of the interview I asked 
 her, "How long do the items take to   
 arrive?" and she said that the larger 
 items take longer.                    
 Finally I asked her if she was pleased
 with the variety avalible. She said it
 was like a new world all together and 
 she also said{that the prices are     
{tremendous.                           </content>
