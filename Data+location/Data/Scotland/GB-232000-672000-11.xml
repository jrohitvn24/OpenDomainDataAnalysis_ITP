		<title>11PHYSICAL GROWTH OF P.GLASGOW</title>
		<content> Port Glasgow grew up on the banks of  
 the{River}Clyde. The shape of the land
 here was relatively flat. In physical 
 terms this is known as the raised     
 beach. Behind the{raised beach,}the   
 land rises steeply. This tended to    
 inhibit the physical expansion of the 
 town in a nucleated pattern. Instead  
 the town tended to develop in a linear
 fashion along the banks of the River  
 Clyde.                                
       But, as the town grew{sites}for 
 expansion were at a premium. For this 
 purpose the high plateau above the    
 raised beach started to be developed, 
 firstly for housing and then for      
 industry. And today, it is this area  
 which is still being expanded.        
 Physical and human have interacted to 
 give the present{landscape.
