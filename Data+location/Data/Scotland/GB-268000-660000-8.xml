        Some people round about my home
do not take care of their gardens and  
just neglect them and let rubbish coll-
ect. Most do look after their garden   
and there are some which are really    
nice and colourful. Popular flowers are
pansies, tulips, roses and daffodils.  
Some grow shrubs and trees if they have
room. Vegetables are usually grown in  
back or side gardens.                  
        People in Uddingston without   
gardens can get an allotment to use.   
Large houses there have big lawns and  
some have orchards and men hired to    
work in them.                          
        I think that people in Viewpark
would like to have some small public   
gardens as in Uddingston. These would  
help to make the place look much bett- 
er.
