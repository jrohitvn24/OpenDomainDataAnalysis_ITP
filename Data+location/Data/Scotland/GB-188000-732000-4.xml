		<title>04DUNSTAFFNAGE CASTLE,CONNEL</title>
		<content> Dunstaffnage Castle, built in the 13th
 century by the MacDougalls,is on a    
 promontory jutting out into Loch      
 Etive.In 1309 it was taken over by the
 Campbells.Inside the castle is a house
 dating back to 1725.                  
 The Captain of Dunstaffnage who lives 
 in Dunstaffnage House is the heredit_ 
 ary keeper of the castle.To retain his
 title he must spend one night each    
 year in the castle.                   
 The stone stairway up to the gatehouse
 is about 100 years old.There used to  
 be a drawbridge.Flora MacDonald was a 
 prisoner in the castle.It is said that
 the Stone of Destiny lay here before  
 being taken to Scone.                 
 To the south west of this ruined      
 castle are the ruins of an ancient    
 chapel beside which is the burial     
 ground of the Campbells of            
 Dunstaffnage.                         </content>
