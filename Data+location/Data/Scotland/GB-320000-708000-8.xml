		<content> The Skene Works were built in 1846.   
 Local people,who did the weaving in   
 their homes,took their cloth along to 
 the Skene Works where the owner bought
 it from them.Here the cloth was       
 pressed,cut up and sewn into such     
 things as sheets and pillow-cases.In  
 1850,the owner decided that he could  
 just as easily weave his own cloth.He 
 installed 2 huge boilers to produce   
 the steam that was needed to work the 
 machinery.During the 1920's and 1930's
 around 60 men and women were employed.
 They started work at 6 o'clock with a 
 break at 8 o'clock for breakfast.There
 was a short break at 12 o'clock for   
 lunch and they finished at half-past 5
 to 6 o'clock.For a whole weeks work   
 women were paid the same as 25p in our
 time,the men,37 and a half pence and  
 the foreman 50p.
