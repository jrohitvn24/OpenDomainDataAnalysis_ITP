		<content> Alves Primary School, situated in the 
 west end of the small village of      
 Alves, consists of two separate       
 buildings.One being the main teaching 
 block and the other being the hall and
 kitchen.Primary 3 to 7 are taught in a
 semi_open plan area, which has a      
 library,a G.P. room and a remedial    
 area adjoining.Primary 1 and 2 are    
 taught at the opposite end of the     
 building.Across the corridoor from    
 them the Playgroup meets.Surrounding  
 the buildings is a large tarmac       
 playground.Adjoining this there is a  
 playing field with a full size        
 football pitch and a sand pit for long
 jump.The school was a Junior Secondary
 and as the roll has dropped in the    
 last few years there is plenty of     
 room. Officially it can accommodate   
 150 pupils.
