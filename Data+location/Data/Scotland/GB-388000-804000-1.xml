 countryside beyond. Within the        
 section there is great variety, from  
 residential areas to open space and   
 farmland.The residential areas range  
 from council estates to prestigious   
 private developments such as those    
 around the great granite hole of      
 Rubislaw quarry. Industry can be large
 scale as in Mastrick Industrial estate
 or small scale as in the Hebridean    
 Workshop. The section is rich in
