		<title>06HOUSING in GLAMIS</title>
		<content>    The houses in Glamis are a mixture 
 of old stone built houses, mainly     
 owned by Strathmore Estates Holdings  
 Ltd and dating from the mid 1700's,   
 and modern housing schemes built by   
 the Local Authority in the 1960's and 
 1970's.  Both types of house are now  
 being sold to private householders.   
 The houses in Charleston are now      
 mainly owner occupied.  There are a   
 number of scattered farm houses and   
 farm cottages.                        
    Only a few occupied houses in      
 the area have not been modernised to  
 include inside toilet and bathroom.   
 There is no serious problem of        
 overcrowding or housing shortage in   
 the area.  There are no current plans 
 for further housing developement.
