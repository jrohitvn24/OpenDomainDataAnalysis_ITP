		<content> TROON CRUISING CLUB WAS FOUNDED IN    
 1955.Two TROON men CHARLES McKINNON   
 and GORDON HINDMARSH were the first   
 members and were soon followed by     
 other enthusiastic sailors.In 1950    
 TROON DOCKS BOARD charged fees for    
 berthing.It was decided to form a     
 club.In 1960 TROON SAILING CLUB WAS   
 formed.This was sited at the NORTH    
 SHORE.However the cruising boats      
 required deeper berths and thus they  
 moved to the harbour area.In 1976 the 
 MARINA was excavated and the CRUISING 
 CLUB were asked to leave.They took    
 their case to Parliament in LONDON and
 were given 1400 feet of the           
 basin.All the boats are racing boats  
 and on WED.evenings meet for pursuit  
 races.A yearly event is the CARRADALE 
 WEEKEND which is a racing and social  
 weekend.
