		<title>07MY HOUSE IN THE ALVES AREA</title>
		<content> My house is a typical modern bungalow 
 of these times and stands in half an  
 acre of ground which is quite  a lot  
 for a modern bungalow. It is a wood   
 frame construction enclosed with      
 concrete blocks and has a tiled roof. 
 Being quite a large bungalow it       
 consists of four bedrooms, two        
 bathrooms, a sitting room, a kitchen  
 and a sun porch. It is heated by      
 electricity which is common for houses
 like this. Most of the house is       
 furnished with modern furniture and we
 have quite a lot of labour saving     
 electrical appliances such as a deep  
 freeze, a T.V, a music centre and an  
 electric carving knife. The house was 
 built by my dad eight years ago.
