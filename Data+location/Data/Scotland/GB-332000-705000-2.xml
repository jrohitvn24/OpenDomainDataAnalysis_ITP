 The NW corner of this area is part of 
 a large market gardening enterprise   
 spreading over a large part of the    
 Howe of Fife.On a series of           
 neighbouring farms intensive market   
 gardening is practiced.This involves  
 growing crops such as lettuce and     
 cabbage,calabrese,beetroot etc.The    
 ground is rigorously prepared before  
 planting and small drills are formed  
 for the plants.Over these perforated  
 plastic sheeting is placed to reduce  
 frost damage and improve growth.The   
 crops are also regularly watered by   
 means of a large sprinkler.The        
 products are sold to the public from  
 the farms but the bulk are marketed   
 through chain stores such as M+S.This 
 type of farming has only become       
 important in the last 7 or 8 years.   </content>
