		<content> A few years ago Gordon District       
 Council relaxed their strict planning 
 control to encourage rural            
 repopulation. This along with a new   
 sewage treatment works has led to a   
 marked increase in housebuilding. Many
 new houses come in quickly erected    
 kit form. The traditional house has a 
 slate roof and is built of granite,   
 some of Syllavethy granite from the   
 now disused quarry. Many council      
 houses have been sold to their        
 tenants. Now approximately half the   
 houses are privately owned and half   
 rented. This year pensioners' houses  
 were built and two years ago sheltered
 housing was completed. A warden is on 
 call and church services, hairdressing
 chiropody and social activities are   
 organised. This enables the elderly to
 stay in the community in comfort but  
 with privacy if so desired.           </content>
