		<content> The surrounding countryside is rich   
 and varied.The farms to the east and  
 north lie on the western edge of the  
 Carse of Stirling which encompasses   
 some of the finest arable farmlands in
 Scotland.To the south,spreading down  
 from the Campsies into the valley are 
 hill farms,where the emphasis is on   
 stock farming.                        
 The Stirling family,which tended the  
 Garden estate for centuries,were tree 
 planters,hence the landscape is       
 dominated by venerable                
 oaks,chestnuts,beeches,sycamores and  
 elders,which grow on the margins of   
 the fields and by the roadsides, and  
 by the small clumps of pine woods     
 planted in more recent times.The      
 fields generally are surrounded by    
 stout hedges of thorn,beech and holly 
 and the overall impression is both    
 rich and colourful.                   </content>
