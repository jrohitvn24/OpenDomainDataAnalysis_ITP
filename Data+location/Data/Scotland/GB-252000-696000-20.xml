		<title>20CUSTOMS IN GARTMORE</title>
		<content>   The{Fairy Steps}are on a roadside   
 verge. If you stand on them and make a
 wish it is supposed to come true and  
 the dust which is on them brings luck.
   At{Halloween}we go guising (in      
 disguise). We go to peoples houses and
 say or sing poems and they give us    
 sweets and fruit.                     
   Not long ago the children had a week
 off for{Tattie Howkin'}(lifting       
 potatoes). Now it is mostly done by   
 machinery.                            
   Mr Cairney the{village composer}has 
 written about 15 songs about the      
 Gartmore area to keep alive memories  
 of the past or a special event. "The  
 Grand Bonspiel" was about a curling   
 championship when the Lake of Menteith
 froze in 1982. "Baron of Buchlyvie"   
 is about a famous local stallion and  
 "The Silver Broom" is about a curling 
 championship held in 1985 in Glasgow. </content>
