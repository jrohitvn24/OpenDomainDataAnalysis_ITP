		<title>04CANNICH AREA: GETTING THERE!</title>
		<content> The most important method of          
{communication}in the Cannich area     
 is probably the{telephone.}In an      
 outlying country area such as this it 
 is not a luxury - it is a necessity   
 for most of the inhabitants.          
                                       
 A post bus once a day is the only     
 method of{travel}in and out of the    
 village unless by car or bike. Because
 of the poor/non-existent{public       
{transport}it is again considered a    
 necessity - not a luxury - to own a   
 car.                                  
                                       
 Recently the only petrol station in   
 Cannich closed. Now local residents   
 and those in the outlying areas must  
 ensure that they have sufficient      
 petrol in their tanks for a return    
 journey before leaving the nearby     
 towns.                                </content>
