 Quarrywood lies on the north side of  
 the A96 just west of Elgin.  In 1949  
 the Forestry Commission bought the    
 wood from Elgin City Council.  Most of
 the trees were planted in 1951 or 1952
 with some later planting in 1959.     
 There is a mixture of deciduous and   
 conifer trees.  There are more        
 Japanese larch than anything else.    
 There are also Scots Pine, Lodgepole  
 and Western Hemlock.  Roe-deer, red   
 squirrels and rabbits are very common.
                                       
 Stone from one of the old quarries was
 used to renovate old buildings in     
 Elgin.  There are lovely walks        
 throughout the wood.
