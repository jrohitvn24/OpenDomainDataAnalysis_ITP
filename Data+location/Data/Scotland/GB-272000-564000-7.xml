		<content> There is quite a number of farms in   
 our block, but few farmers employ     
 local inhabitants, although in summer 
 they use extra workers for silaging   
 and harvesting.                       
 There are no industries so you have to
 find a job in a larger settlement or  
 set up your own business, which some  
 people have since their former        
 employers cannot find enough money to 
 pay them.                             
 There is a car body shop, a petrol    
 station and a haulage contractor.     
 There is a pub and two shops in       
 Crossmichael. One of them does Bed &amp;  
 Breakfast. Some people work for the   
 Forestry Commission.
