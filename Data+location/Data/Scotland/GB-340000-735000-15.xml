		<content> In our block there are a few{SMALL    
{HOLDINGS}which are now too small to be
 farmed economically and are used for  
 other purposes. One such holding just 
 inside our boundary is being used as{ 
{LIVERY STABLES}for horses. The 4.85   
 hectares of land are sown in grass and
 divided up into 5 fields and 2        
 paddocks. There are 13 stables and 13 
 horses and ponies, 3 of which are     
 foals. When a horse or pony is stabled
 here, hay, straw and hard feed e.g.   
 oats, barley, beetpulp etc. are       
 provided. The horses and ponies are   
 fed at 7am and 8pm in summer and 7am  
 and 7pm in winter.                    
 Throughout the summer 6 horses are in 
 at night and 7 out all the time.      
 During the winter only one horse is   
 out all the time. The rest are in and 
 are only put out occasionally e.g.    
 when the stable is being 'mucked out'.</content>
