		<title>16A Small Dundrennan Farm</title>
		<content> Barend is a small family farm         
 consisting of 12 fields.It has 2      
 fields of barley and 3 of hay.The rest
 of the fields are rough grazing.It is 
 half and half livestock.One cow is    
 usually milked but sometimes when the 
 cow is low a Guernsey is milked as    
 well.There are about 12 cows in the   
 byre.                                 
      Due to a shortage of grass,some  
 cattle are still being fed and some   
 are still inside.                     
       At the moment all the work is   
 done by the farmer,his wife,his son   
 and his daughter.The farmer works from
 7.00 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.The others vary.
      Before breakfast he milks the    
 cows and feeds the calves.After that  
 he goes to the sheep and then he goes 
 spraying.After spraying he powerhoses 
 the byre.He then does the cows again.
