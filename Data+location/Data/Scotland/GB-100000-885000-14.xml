 craft fairs on the mainland.Much of

  Wool is spun on machines in mills in 
 Stornoway and is then delivered to the
 5 weavers in our area to be woven into
 cloth.The finished tweed is then sent 
 back to the mills in Stornoway.From   
 there it is sold all over the         
 world.Weavers are trained in college  
 in Stornoway and then they buy their  
 own looms and work at home.They       
 produce 2 or 3 tweeds in a week.
