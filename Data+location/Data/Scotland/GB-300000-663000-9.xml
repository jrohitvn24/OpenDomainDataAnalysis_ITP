 The estate is in Harburn,West         
 Calder.The house was built by George  
 Ferguson who was born in 1743.The     
 house was built on a dreary           
 countryside and stood on its own until
 the village grew to meet it.The house 
 was built in 1797 as George wanted to 
 live there with his wife and family.It
 stood for 176 years before it was     
 destroyed by fire.Today the house is  
 being rebuilt and converted into      
 flats.The rebuilding began in 1984 and
 should be completed by the end 1985.  
{The Five Sisters                      
 Although not a building they are an   
 interesting landmark.These hills      
 sprang up at the time of shale mining 
 and are made of excess shale.They are 
 not hills as we know them but man made
 "bings."
