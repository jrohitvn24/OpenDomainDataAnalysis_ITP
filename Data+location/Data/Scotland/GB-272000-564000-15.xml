		<content> We visited William Neil, the poet.    
 Before he retired he was an English   
 teacher in our school, and before that
 he was a navigator in the R.A.F. He   
 lives just outside Crossmichael with  
 his wife, who is also a retired       
 teacher.                              
 He was quite old when he went to      
 Edinburgh University to study English 
 and Celtic languages. He is an unusual
 because he writes in the 3 languages  
 of Scotland - Scots (Lallans), English
 and Gaelic. In 1969 he was crowned    
 Bard at the Gaelic Mod. He loves      
 living in the country and he writes   
 many poems about our area. He is also 
 concerned about the condition of      
 Scotland and of Europe, and he writes 
 about this as well. He is editor of   
 "Lallans", the Scots language         
 magazine. His latest book of poems is 
 called "Wild Places"                  </content>
