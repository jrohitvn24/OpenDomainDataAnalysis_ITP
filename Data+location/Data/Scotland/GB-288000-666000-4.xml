		<title>04Buildings in Blackridge</title>
		<content>     In Blackridge we have a lot of new
 buildings.  Most of our old buildings 
 have been knocked down. We have       
 different kinds of buildings including
 houses. We have semi-detached and     
 detached. We have bungalows and       
 cottages, and flats.  In our          
 playground there used to be an old    
 church. Opposite the public swingpark 
 there was a{Police Station}with cells.
 13-14{Mclean Terrace}was a police     
 station too. There was a hall built in
 1910-1911 and it was knocked down in  
 1977, it was called{Paulo's Hall}and  
 it had films on Saturdays and         
 Wednesday. It had an upstairs  and    
 downstairs. The downstairs was called 
 the{Lesser Hall}it was 6d at night for
 downstairs and it was 1/_ and  9d for 
 upstairs.                             
   In{Drummond Place}there were        
 terraces and railway cottages.        </content>
