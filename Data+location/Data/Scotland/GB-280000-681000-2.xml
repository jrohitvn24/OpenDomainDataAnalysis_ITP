		<content>  Until the Industrial Revolution,     
 Denny and Dunipace were separate      
 villages in a very rural area and     
 there was no major road through       
 them. People worked the land.         
 Towards the end of the 18th century   
 there were several woollen and linen  
{mills}on the River Carron. The linen  
 mills closed causing unemployment but 
 the supply of pure water brought a new
 industry, calico printing. This also  
 failed after a time but from it grew  
 the paper_making trade.The importance 
 of this industry increased for a      
 century but today there is only one   
 paper_mill left.                      
     Large amounts of{mineral wealth   
 brought{employment}to the area.There  
 was iron_ore,coal and fire_clay. All  
 brought prosperity.Today there is     
 great unemployment but Denny people   
 never lack courage and hope.          </content>
