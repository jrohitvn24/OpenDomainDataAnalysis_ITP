		<content> At various points within our area, we 
 discovered a disused railway track.   
 The lines had been lifted, but where  
 they had been was clearly observed. On
 enquiring, we discovered that this was
 the original Perth-Crieff-Balquhidder 
 Railway. This line opened in two      
 stages, Crieff to Methven Junction,   
 which was built in 1864-65 and        
 Lochearnhead-St. Fillans-Comrie, built
 in 1897. This line formed what was    
 known as a "Link-line" for the        
 Dunblane-Doune and Callander Railway. 
 The main function of this line was for
 the transport of agricultural produce 
 from the area and to bring in         
 fertilizer, lime etc., for the many   
 farms. One interesting feature of this
 old line was that a steam bus used to 
 run between Methven and Perth. This   
 was discontinued in 1937.
