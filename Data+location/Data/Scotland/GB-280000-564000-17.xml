		<title>17FAMILY TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> My family has two cars.  A 'Maestro'  
 and a 'Mini'.  My dad and mum can both
 drive and my big sister can as well.  
 My big brother is learning to drive.  
 My sister takes the 'mini' to college 
 to save her bus fares.  I have a bike 
 but it isn't road worthy so I play    
 with it instead.  For Christmas this  
 year I hope to get a bike so I can try
 to pass the Cycling Proficiency Test. 
 It is run by the Police.              
 It is quite handy to have two cars    
 because you can go with somebody while
 the others go somewhere else.  We     
 usually take the 'Maestro' to Dumfries
 on Saturdays to do some shopping.  We 
 shop in Dumfries because there is a   
 good selection of shops there.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
