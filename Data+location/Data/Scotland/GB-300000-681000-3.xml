		<title>03IRONFOUNDERS IN BO'NESS</title>
		<content> Ballantine iron works were first      
 started by two brothers in 1836. The  
 first iron works in Bo'ness started in
 1750. Bo'ness was a popular place for 
 building iron works because there was 
 both iron ore and coal in Bo'ness. Now
 there are only two iron companies     
 left. Ballantines is known all over   
 the world because they make fancy     
 railings, lamp posts, gates and drain 
 covers. Some Arabs put in an offer for
 railings and lamps like the ones at   
 Buckingham Palace and the Mall in     
 London. So the manager went down to   
 London and measured the lamps.
