		<title>05HOUSING IN NEWTON MEARNS</title>
		<content> In this area owner-occupied           
 semi-detatched villas predominate.    
 There are also detached villas of     
 various styles and single storey      
 bungalows. These are of traditional   
 brick cavity wall construction with   
 slated or tiled roofs.                
   A small percentage consists of local
 authority housing. These houses rented
 to people who do not wish, or are     
 unable, to own their own house.       
   The majority of houses in Newton    
 Mearns were built prior to 1939 but   
 since 1946 there has been a large     
 increase in the number of houses built
 for sale. In recent years new housing 
 estates have been built on former farm
 land.
