		<content> We were visting the Thorn Brae in     
 Johnstone when we met Jim Leighton;   
 the Scotland and Aberdeen football    
 team goalkeeper, and former Saint     
 Cuthbert's pupil. We asked him if he  
 enjoyed the previous night's World Cup
 game against Iceland. He told us he   
 enjoyed the game very much, and that  
 he had arrived home that morning and  
 was still feeling sleepy.             
 I asked him how he enjoyed the penalty
 save against Iceland and he said that 
 he knew where the ball was going.     
 Before going to Aberdeen, Jim played  
 for Johnstone United; the local under 
 16's boys football club.              
 Mr Bryant took a photograph of the    
 "Team" and Jim Leighton.
