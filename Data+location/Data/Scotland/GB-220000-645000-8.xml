		<title>08WEST KILBRIDE SCHOOL (2)</title>
		<content> At present there are{19 classes}in our
 school and{21 teachers,}plus visiting 
 teachers for needlework, art, violin, 
 piano and cello. Most classes have    
 less than 30 children in them_the     
 maximum number of pupils should be 33.
 All of the classes, except the three  
 primary 7s, are accommodated in a     
 semi-open plan building. This means   
 that most of the "bases" do not have a
 fourth wall. Instead, they look out on
 to a central activity area. Some of   
 the teachers complain that it is too  
 noisy in the new school but others    
 prefer it because it is bright and    
 modern.                               
 At the present time there are very few
 extra_ curricular activities because  
 Scottish teachers are involved in a   
 pay dispute with the Government.      
 Teachers in our school have also been 
 on{strike}because of this.            </content>
