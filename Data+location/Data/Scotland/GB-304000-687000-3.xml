		<content>{A DAIRY FARM                          
 The milking starts with the farmer    
 cleaning the cows teats ready to fix  
 on four rubber tubes.These tubes start
 to suck out the milk which then goes  
 in to a small tub. When this small tub
 is full a van comes and the milk gets 
 taken to the dairy.The cows that we   
 saw getting milked are then put into  
 a shed.The farmer told us how the cows
 dung gets stored in big containers.   
 Then it gets sprayed in the fields.   
 Dung  helps the grass  grow. The      
 farmer then took us to see the        
 calves.The farmer got the milk we gave
 them it in big plastic bottles.They   
 were fast drinkers.Their mouths were  
 watering because they liked the milk. 
 We had to hold the bottles tight      
 because they could pull the bottles   
 out of our hands .We had a great time 
 and we all wanted to take one home.   </content>
