		<content> "A day in my life is very uneventful.I
 attend Corseford Residential School   
 for the disabled.I am 16 years old and
 I've been attending the school for    
 several years and I will be leaving in
 three weeks time.                     
 During the last year I have found it  
 very annoying as it was not possible  
 for me to do what an able bodied 16   
 year old normally does.My school is   
 some distance from a built up area and
 we seldom meet with people living in  
 the community.I find it difficult to  
 keep in contact with my friends as my 
 home is in Dumfriesshire.             
 I hope that when the people of the    
 future will read this,there will be   
 more intergration of the disabled into
 normal schools.I hope by that time the
 prejudices that face us are           
 abolished."
