   My mum works at an Esso Filling     
 Station at Johnstonebridge on the     
 south bound lane of the A74 which     
 links Glasgow and London.There is also
 a Filling Station on the north bound  
 lane. The Filling Station on the south
 bound is open 12 hours per day -8.00am

   There are three petrol pumps and one
 diesel pump.The diesel pump has only  
 been there for about a year.The       
 Filling station has been there for    
 about 25 years.There is also an Esso  
 shop.
