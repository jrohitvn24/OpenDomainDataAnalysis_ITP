		<content>  Auchinleck Red Cross organised       
 nightly dances which were very popular
 with both the troops stationed at     
 Pennylands Camp and the villagers.    
   The large number of troops with     
 their regular pay  helped local trade 
 and also regularly attracted many     
 street traders from as far as Glasgow 
 to sell their wares from suitcases.   
   Rationing existed during and after  
 the war but the amount of money spent 
 in the village  by the troops created 
 a market for 'luxury'goods,resulting  
 in a letter from a repatriated Pole to
 a local trader saying 'he could have  
 bought a horse and cart in Poland for 
 what he paid for pepper in            
 Auchinleck'.                          
   Some Polish soldiers stayed to marry
 local girls and there are still       
 families of Polish extraction in the  
 village.                              </content>
