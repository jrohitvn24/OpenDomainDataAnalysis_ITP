		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO HOUSTON</title>
		<content>{HOUSTON}is an expanding village,      
 situated in the West of Scotland, 30km
 from the city of{Glasgow.}It is a     
 lowland rural area and the river      
{Gryffe,}a tributary of the Clyde,flows
 through it.It is essentially an       
 agricultural area,but in recent years 
 the village has expanded,replacing    
 farmland with residential development.
 Today, many of the inhabitants are    
 employed in service industries        
 and work outwith Houston.             
 Settlement in this area goes back to {
 Neolithic times and ancient burial    
 grounds can still be seen at North    
 Mound and South Mound. Houston itself 
 only began to develop as a significant
 settlement towards the end of the 18th
 century. The village was given to Sir 
 Hugh de Padvinan in the 12th century  
 and became known as{"Hugh's Town",    
 then Houston.                         </content>
