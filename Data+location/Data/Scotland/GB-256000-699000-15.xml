		<content> In order to keep the lake stocked 8   
 ponds have been made to breed the     
 trout.The fry are bought in and fed on
 high protein pellets. As they grow    
 they are selected and separated into  
 different ponds according to their    
 size until they are big enough to be  
 put into the lake.Over 1000 fish in   
 excess of 2 pounds are put into the   
 lake every week during the fishing    
 season. The brown trout is native to  
 this country but the most popular type
 today is the rainbow trout which has  
 been introduced from America and New  
 Zealand.                              
  We watched some trout being moved    
 from the breeding ponds to the        
 floating cages in the lake.These cages
 are designed to protect the trout from
 predators such as pike or herons until
 they are big enough to be released    
 into the lake.                        </content>
