		<content> MARCHMONT WAS BUILT IN 1750-1754 WITH 
 THOMAS GIBSON AS ARCHITECT, NOT THE   
 FAMOUS ADAM FAMILY AS HAS COMMONLY    
 BEEN BELIEVED. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHO WAS
 RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REMARKABLE        
 PLASTERWORK, POSSIBLY DUTCH OR ITALIAN
 CRAFTSMEN. THE HOUSE WAS ALTERED IN   
 THE SECOND DECADE OF THIS CENTURY     
 UNDER THE HANDS OF SIR ROBERT LORIMER 
 WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THISTLE   
 CHAPEL IN EDINBURGH CASTLE &amp; HE MUCH  
 ENLARGED IT. IT IS NOW BECOMING A SUE 
 RYDER HOME FOR SICK &amp; DISABLED,       
 HOUSING ABOUT 40 RESIDENTS. IT        
 CONTAINS A FINE MUSIC ROOM &amp; ORGAN    
 WHICH ARE IN DEMAND FOR CONCERTS; A   
 SMALL ROMAN CATHOLIC CHAPEL DEDICATED 
 TO ST. JOAN OF ARC WHICH WAS OPENED IN
 1936 &amp; HAS BEEN IN CONSTANT USE EVER  
 SINCE, WEEKLY MASS BEING SAID BY THE  
 LOCAL PRIEST FROM DUNS.
