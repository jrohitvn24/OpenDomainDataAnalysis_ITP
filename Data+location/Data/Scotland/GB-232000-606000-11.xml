		<title>11AN OLD AGE PENSIONER</title>
		<content> An elderly lady of over 70 years of   
 age has lived in the village of       
 Kirkmichael all her life.When she was 
 young there were houses in only two   
 streets and a few situated along the  
 side of the Dyrock Burn.The only      
 transport was the horse and cart and  
 she remembers going round the village 
 using this to deliver milk from a     
 large can.She thinks the village has  
 changed a lot with the recent housing 
 developments and more people living   
 here has helped the community greatly.
 Her day starts about 10a.m.when she   
 gets up and does some housework.She   
 goes for a walk,does shopping and     
 visits a friend.In the afternoon,if   
 it is fine,she goes walking. If not,  
 she knits and watches television.She  
 has her main meal in the evening and  
 goes to bed at 10.30p.m.              
                                       </content>
