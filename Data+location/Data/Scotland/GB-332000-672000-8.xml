		<title>08A FISHY BUSINESS</title>
		<content> Mr Clark's fishshop is situated       
 opposite the harbour.  It is the only 
 fish business left in Fisherrow.      
 Fishing boats used to land fish at the
 harbour regularly and the Co-op garage
 used to be the fish market several    
 years ago.                            
                                       
 Here are some questions the group     
 asked Mr Clark                        
                                       
 Have fish stocks declined over the    
 years.  Yes, unfortunately they have  
 declined drastically.                 
                                       
 How much does a box of Haddock cost   
 now compared to 15 years ago.  Now    
 Haddock cost Â£36 a box but then it    
 only cost Â£6-Â£7 in new money.         
                                       
 Is this still a profitable industry.  
 Yes if you are prepared to work at it.</content>
