		<content> Hallyard Palace                       
 On the N.W. perimeter of Auchtertool  
 there can be found the ruins of       
 Hallyard Palace. Built in the 11th    
 Century as a hunting seat for King    
 Malcolm Canmore,(1057-99) his son     
 David 1st gave Hallyard to the newly  
 erected Bishopric of Dunkeld in 1127. 
 Successive Bishops used the Palace as 
 one of their chief residences.        
                                       
 In 1526, the Palace and lands were    
 given to Sir James Kirkcaldy,         
 counsellor to James the 5th. Shortly  
 after James the 5th was defeated at   
 the Battle of Solway Moss, he spent   
 the night at Hallyard's before going  
 on to Falkland Palace and his death.  
 The Kirkcaldy's were staunch          
 supporters of the Protestant cause and
 were believed to be implicated in the 
 death of Cardinal Beaton in 1546(cont)</content>
