		<title>10Sheep farming in Rhenigidale</title>
		<content>{SPRING}At this time the lambs are     
 born. It is a very busy time. Usually 
 every year there will be 1 or more    
 orphan lambs that have to be fed by a 
 bottle of milk. Nearly everywhere     
 there are lambs jumping about. Some   
 are born early and some late.         
{SUMMER}This is the time for shearing. 
 In Rhenigidale they don't use electric
 shears but the old hand shears. They  
 are not as quick and easy to use but  
 they work just as well.               
{AUTUMN}All the sheep get dipped at    
 this time. The dip mixture is mixed   
 with water in a tank. The sheep are   
 caught and  put into the tank. The    
 whole body is pushed under for one    
 minute. After that the sheep climb    
 onto a dripper platform to dry out.   
 The female sheep go to the ram towards
 the end of November.
