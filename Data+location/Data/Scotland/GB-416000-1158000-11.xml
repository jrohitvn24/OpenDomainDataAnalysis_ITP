		<title>11Medical Care on Papa Stour.</title>
		<content> If you have a minor illness you have  
 to ring the doctor on the Mainland,   
 because there is no resident nurse.   
 The doctor may prescribe medicine     
 which can be dispensed by a lady on   
 the island.                           
   In an emergency you may need to be  
 transported to the hospital in Lerwick
 (on the Mainland).The{Aith Lifeboat}  
 may be called upon to make the trip   
 across St.Magnus Bay,or a small plane 
 may attempt to land on our unsurfaced 
 air-strip.                            
   Last year a helicopter was used for 
 the first time in an emergency.A      
 school-boy with suspected head        
 injuries was taken to hospital on a   
 black and windy night.All the tractors
 on the island went to the air-strip   
 and illuminated the landing place with
 their headlights.Fortunately,we are a 
 healthy lot and accidents are rare.   </content>
