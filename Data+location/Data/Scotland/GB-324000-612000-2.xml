   In Ettrick there are people who     
 work in the valley community,people   
 who work on the land and people who   
 travel out of the valley to work.     
   The people who work in the community
 are the shop owners and the school    
 cook.The farmers and the shepherds    
 work on the land to make their        
 living.Other people only live in the  
 valley because they like it here and  
 they have to travel as far as Glasgow 
 to work.                              
   The main work in the valley is the  
 farming and the shepherding.
