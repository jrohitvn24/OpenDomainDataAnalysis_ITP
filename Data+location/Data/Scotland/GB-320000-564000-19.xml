		<content> Most pets are bought in the pet shop  
 and can be expensive to buy.We came to
 the conclusion that a dog is the most 
 popular pet Pet dogs are usually tame 
 but sometimes they are not properly   
 trained and become wild.              
 Some parents look after their pets on 
 their own,but children sometimes help.
 Most pets are well looked after       
 because we found that very few had    
 injuries or illnesses.Those which did 
 have illnesses were taken to the vet. 
 Some even go to the bother of         
 travelling to other towns to get      
 treatment for their pets.Unfortunately
 there are some owners who never take  
 their pets to the vet.
