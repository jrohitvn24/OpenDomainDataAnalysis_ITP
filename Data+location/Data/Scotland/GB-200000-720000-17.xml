		<title>17THE END OF AN ERA.</title>
		<content> On Thursday 4th June 1985,the whole of
 our community was saddened by the     
 death of Mrs. Bella MacIntyre Bolton. 
 She was 95 years old and the oldest   
 member of the community. Until a few  
 months ago she lived in the house in  
 front of the school and next door to  
 the local shop which was built by her 
 father. She celebrated her 95th       
 birthday in February and was delighted
 to hear a birthday wish on her        
 favourite radio show. Bella was blind 
 and could no longer watch TV or read  
 books. Bella attended our school in   
 1895 and could describe clearly to the
 present school children, her strict   
 head teacher and the conditions in the
 school room. She also remembered the  
 drovers bringing the cattle from the  
 north to cross Loch Awe to go to      
 market in Stirling or Falkirk. We all 
 learned a great deal from Bella.      </content>
