 has a football pitch which is used by 
 the Keiss Football Club, who play     
 regular fixtures there in the summer.

 also the nearby swing park.           
   The Youth Club has up to 30 members 
 meeting in its own hall. The Keiss

 hall is used by the Brownies, the Girl
 Guides, SWRI and the Badminton Club.  
   The Hotel is a social gathering     
 place.                                
{CHURCHES}The area has 3 churches. Two 
 are in the village - the Church of    
 Scotland Parish Church which is a     
 charge linked with Canisbay, and the  
 Keiss Free Church. In both the number 
 of attenders is much smaller than it  
 used to be.                           </content>
