 Primary 6/7 have noticed in our every_
 day school work, is the increased use 
 of the computer in the classroom.Our  
 school has two computers,a Commodore  
 Pet and this BBC micro which most     
 classes make use of.                  
 The school uniform which,although not 
 compulsory,is worn by most children   
 and comprises of white shirt,grey     
 skirt/trousers,a black and gold       
 diagonally striped tie and a grey     
 jersey. School dinners are cooked on  
 the premises and today's menu         
 consisted of Sweet &amp; Sour Pork or     
 Mince &amp; Doughballs,Creamed potatoes   
 and carrots followed by a choice of   
 Baked Chocolate chip sponge and       
 raspberry sauce or Pancakes &amp;         
 syrup.57% of all pupils have a school 
 lunch,32% bring a packed lunch and 11%
 go home for their lunch.              </content>
