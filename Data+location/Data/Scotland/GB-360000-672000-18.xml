{                                      
  We are lucky to live here.Although we
 are in the country it is not too far  
 from Edinburgh.We can easily get into 
 Edinburgh by train,bus or car.We go to
 shops,theatres,art galleries,museums  
 and to the Edinburgh international    
 festival which is held every year in  
 the Autumn.                           
 However people from Edinburgh and much
 further afield come to our area to    
 visit a small art gallery which is    
 becoming quite famous.                
 The art gallery is a pub aswell.5     
 years ago Mr Angus McAulay bought the 
 pub because he loved paintings and    
 decided it was a good location for an 
 art gallery.                          
 Many famous people exhibit at our     
 gallery.The paintings are good and    
 sell well.                            </content>
