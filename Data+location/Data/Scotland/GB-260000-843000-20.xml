		<title>20THE SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content>    We usually do most of our work in  
 the mornings.Some things we have after
 lunch are Art, Project, Singing,      
 Geography, or Needlework. When we     
 have P.E, we have to move the         
 furniture so we can have room for     
 running. If it is nice we go outside  
 and play rounders. We have specialist 
 teachers who come to the school and   
 they give us Music, Art and           
 Needlework. The local Minister visits 
 the school and we sing hymns and hear 
 stories. We enjoy all of these things.
 My favourite is Needlework.           
    Six children get a lift to school  
 in a taxi as they live more than two  
 miles away. When we leave Kirkton     
 School at the end of Primary 7, we go 
 to Charleston Academy in Inverness. It
 is about 4km away and a bus takes us  
 there and back.
