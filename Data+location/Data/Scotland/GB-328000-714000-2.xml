 Most of the houses in Letham are old  
 and are built of stone.   There are 67
 houses altogether and many of these   
 have been modernised and extended.   3
 have been built recently.   The       
 majority are terraced but there are   
 also detached and semi-detached       
 houses, flats and bungalows.   14 of  
 the houses are owned by the Regional  
 Council.   Most of the rest are       
 owner-occupied.                       
    There                              
  is a Primary School,                 
 Village                               
 Hall and a General Shop, Post Office. 
  The Council own a small depot and    
 there is also a Park where children   
 may play safely.   Opposite the park  
 is the Police Station.                
    Last year Letham won the Best Kept 
 Village award for North East Fife.    </content>
