		<title>03WILLIAM TOWRIE CUTT</title>
		<content> William Towrie Cutt, was born on      
 Sanday, in 1898. He was the seventh   
 son of a lobster fisherman and they   
 lived at Kettletoft. He emigrated to  
 Canada at the end of the First World  
 War. There he taught in a remote      
 frontier school in the Peace River    
 district of Alberta. Later he was to  
 write books on the Indian - Orkney    
 settlers of the early days, e.g., 'On 
 The Trail of Long Tom', and 'Carry My 
 Bones Northwest'. His other books:-   
 'Faraway World', 'Seven for the Sea', 
 'Message From Arkmae', and 'The       
 Hogboon of Hell', are based on his    
 childhood memories of the life on an  
 Orkney Island. With a donation of     
 money received from Mr. Cutt, before  
 his death, the local community was    
 able to set up a library which is kept
 in the school premises.
