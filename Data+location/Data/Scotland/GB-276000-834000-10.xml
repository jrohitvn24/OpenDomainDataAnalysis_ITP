  I woke at 7.00a.m. and went          
 downstairs to have a wash. I dressed  
 myself and had cornflakes for         
 breakfast. I read my comics until     
 Aunty took my two friends and me      
 swimming. The lady at the pool        
 wouldn't let us in so we went into    
 Woolworth's, bought some Hubba Bubba  
 and went home.                        
                                       
  The hobbies of Moy School children   
 are swimming, playing, roller skating,
 collecting posters, computer, cycling,
 drawing, horse riding, records, stamp 
 collecting, collecting models and     
 reading.                              
  The most popular hobby is swimming.  
 We also watch a lot of programmes on  
 television.
