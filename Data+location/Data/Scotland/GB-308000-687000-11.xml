		<content> There are two nursery schools in our  
 block and both of these form part of  
 a primary school.  There are seven    
 primary schools in our block, three of
 which are built to the same design.   
 One of the seven primary schools is   
 Headwell, which is for handicapped    
 children.                             
    There is one Roman Catholic primary
 school in Dunfermline.  At the age of 
 twelve its pupils go to the Catholic  
 High School, St. Columba's, which is  
 also in our block.                    
    There are two other high schools in
 our block, to which pupils transfer   
 after seven years at primary school.  
 After four years at High School,      
 pupils sit 'O' Level examinations and 
 then 'A' level examinations.  Some    
 pupils go on to tertiary education.
