		<content> Forestry accounts for some 24 percent 
 of the ground cover in this 12km      
 block. About 20 privately owned small 
 blocks of woodland are integrated with
 the agriculture &amp; the NE corner of the
 area includes C.200 hectares of a     
 large block of production forest      
 planted in 1983. Smaller woods provide
 shelter for farm stock game &amp; wildlife
 &amp; will provide a significant volume of
 timber. The plantations are mostly    
 coniferous less than 40 years of age. 
 Several are in the thinning stages &amp;  
 producing a first crop of timber which
 is sold mainly to chipwood pulpwood   
 markets. A small proportion is used   
 for fuel. The woods therefore form an 
 important part of the ecology of the  
 area &amp; along with neighbouring        
 blocks provide employment locally.    
 Total area of woodland in this area is
 C.290 hectares.                       </content>
