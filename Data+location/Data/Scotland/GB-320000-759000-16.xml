		<title>16Farming in Glenisla. contd.</title>
		<content> Only two farms are privately owned,   
 the other four being tenant farmers.  
 These farmers have been resident in   
 the Glen for an average of sixteen    
 years. Employment on the farms is low 
 although four farms use casual labour 
 for lambing and harvesting. On the    
 whole the farmers enjoy their work and
 list the good points as _ healthy     
 outdoor life, job satisfaction,       
 especially during spring and summer   
 months and the pleasure of watching   
 nature at work. The unpleasant aspects
 are listed as _ severe winter         
 conditions making the feeding of      
 animals difficult and the loss of     
 early lambs a problem. All the farmers
 appear dissatisfied with the present  
 government policies giving a poor     
 return for their long hours and hard  
 work.                                 
                                       </content>
