 .AFTER WOODSIDE CAME AUCHMUTY AND THE 
 NEED FOR 2 MAJOR ROADS.ONE WAS THE    
 QUEENSWAY WHICH WOULD CONNECT WITH THE
 TOWN CENTRE AREA AND FORM THE         
 FIRST PART OF THE NEW A911 CONNECTING 
 WITH LESLIE,INSTEAD OF THE OLD ROUTE  
 BY CADAHM.THE OTHER WAS WOODSIDE ROAD 
 WHICH WOULD FOLLOW ROUGHLY THE OLD    
 WAROUT RIGHT-OF-WAY.THE NEXT AREAS TO 
 BE BUILT WERE RIMBLETON AND SOUTHPARKS
 WHICH WERE BUILT OVER THE PERIOD FROM 
 1958-1965.WITH THESE PRECINCTS CAME   
 NEW DESIGNS.THERE WERE CULDESACS,     
 PENDHOUSES AND PEDWAY ROUTES.THERE    
 WERE NOW DIFFERENT OUTSIDE CLADDING   
 MATERIALS WHICH GAVE MORE TEXTURE AND 
 COLOUR TO THE APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSES
 IN 1955 WORK WAS STARTED ON BUILDING  
 SHOPS IN THE TOWN CENTRE AREA.HOWEVER 
 FOR THE MOMENT WOODSIDE HAD TO BE     
 USED.                                 </content>
