        WIND BREAKS

 This small amount of trees are called 
 Wind Breaks.  These grown trees are to
 stop the wind from the sea from       
 ruining the farmer's crops. The trees 
 breaks down the wind when blown across
 the land.  Rows of trees are scattered
 all over the country. The rows of     
 trees are at different angles on the  
 map as it depends on which way the    
 wind is blowing.                      
 When the wind is high, this is a bad  
 time for the crops, that's why they   
 were put there by the people who      
 stayed there years ago.  These wind   
 breaks take up a lot of farmland, but 
 farmers still have a lot of famland to
 plant crops.                          </content>
