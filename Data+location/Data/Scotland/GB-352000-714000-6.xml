		<title>06THE COASTGUARD</title>
		<content> This stretch of coast is the          
 responsibility of the coastguard whose
 area covers Montrose to the Borders.  
 The cliffs in this area are used as a 
 training ground for auxilliary        
 officers, especially in the use of    
 rescue apparatus. Not only do they    
 practise cliff rescues but they also  
 use the area for coastal searches.    
 Coastguards are called out rarely,    
 although emergency calls peak in the  
 summer months with the advent of      
 holiday makers:scuba divers, lilos and
 small boats cause most trouble. The   
 coastal walk has also caused some     
 problems, as the area is now freely   
 accessible to the public, yet poses   
 access problems for vehicles when help
 is needed, and the coastguard has to  
 rely on farm tracks leading close to  
 the shore. In dire emergency, R.A.F.  
 helicopters are close at hand.        </content>
