		<content> This block consists mainly of the     
 River Forth but a small strip of land 
 is included in it. This land forms the
 eastern part of the burgh of Bo'ness. 
 The area was once three small villages
 Carriden, Grangepans and Bridgeness   
 which are now part of Bo'ness.        
 Grangepans is so called as salt was   
 panned from the R.Forth here. Most of 
 the foreshore is an industrial area   
 although there is a right of way      
 beside the river.The industries are   
 foundries, engineering &amp; woodyards.   
 Two items of historical interest are  
 in this area.The Scottish Railway     
 Preservation Society who have their   
 headquarters and rolling stock here.  
 The other is Antonine's Wall.It began 
 at Carriden and ran through Bo'ness.  
 There are 5 primaries in Bo'ness; the 
 Grange and St.Mary's are in this area.
 There is 1 secondary, Bo'ness Academy.</content>
