		<title>14EYEMOUTH MUSEUM</title>
		<content> This small folk-museum was opened in  
 October 1981,as a memorial to the     
 local fishermen who lost their lives  
 in the Great Fishing Disaster of      
 1881.It records the history of the    
 town and surrounding area and is      
 housed in what was formerly the old   
 parish church in the centre of the    
 town.Exhibits include a Victorian shop
 window,a fisherman's cottage as it was
 100 years ago and many of the tools   
 used in local industries and farming  
 over the past 100 years.Special       
 exhibitions are held regularly and    
 local schoolchildren are encouraged to
 carry out project research within the 
 museum.The museum contains the 15ft   
 long Eyemouth Tapestry,worked by local
 women to commemorate the Disaster.It  
 took 2 years to sew and has 400       
 different shades of wool.
