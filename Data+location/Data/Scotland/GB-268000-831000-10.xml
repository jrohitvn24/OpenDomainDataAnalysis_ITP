		<content>{Barn owl                              
 The barn owl eats small mammals up to 
 the size of a rabbit.In the day he    
 sits under trees or in old barns      
 sleeping but at night he comes out to 
 catch food.He lets out a screech to   
 warn all the animals that he is coming
 to hunt.There are quite a lot of owls 
 that have different colours of eyes.  
 Yellow eyes are best at night,orange  
 for twilight and brown for day.       
{Peregrine falcon                      
 The peregrine is becoming quite rare. 
 Farmers spray their crops with        
 chemicals and then little birds eat   
 the crops and then the perigrine eats 
 the birds and dies.Also they were shot
 during the war for killing carrier    
 pigeons with messages.                
 They have lovely blue feathers and    
 a striped breast.People now keep them 
 for hunting game.                     </content>
