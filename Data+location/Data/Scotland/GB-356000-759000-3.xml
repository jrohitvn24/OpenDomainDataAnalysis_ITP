		<title>03CROP CHANGES NEAR BRECHIN</title>
		<content> In recent years agricultural land-use 
 has seen the upsurge of several new   
 crops including oil seed rape,peas and
 flax.These are slowly replacing the   
 more traditional crops such as        
 turnips,grass and soft fruits although
 flax was previously grown in the      
 district until the mid 19th century.  
 This year Broomfield farm has 15 acres
 of flax with an expected yield of 1.5 
 tons per acre.This will be sold to    
 Tayside Flax in Arbroath for linen    
 production.The farmer has also sown a 
 field of peas to use as cattle fodder.
 Several farms in the block have oil   
 seed rape.This crop gives a very      
 distinctive yellow colouring to the   
 landscape in early summer.The crop is 
 harvested by contractors using        
 specialised machinery and sold to     
 margarine companies.
