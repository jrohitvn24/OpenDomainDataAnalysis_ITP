		<title>09Kirkconnel:St.Conal's Church</title>
		<content> St.Conal's Church( Of Scotland )  was 
 built in 1729 with an extension being 
 made in 1896. The original St. Conal's
 whose ruins lie to the north of Kirk- 
 connel at NS71,0272.3/0615.1 dates to 
 the  6th Century, St.Conal having been
 a disciple of St.Kentigern(also known 
 as St. Mungo).                        
 The present church,under the charge of
 the Reverand Harold Mudaliar also     
 accomodates the former congregation of
 St. Mark's which served Kelloholm     
 until falling attendance forced an    
 amalgamation of the two. Over the last
 two years the attendance has increased
 and now is at a healthy level.The     
 church organises a variety of clubs;  
 Young Worshipper's League, Bible Club,
 Girl's Brigade,Boy's Brigade,Young    
 Women's Club.Mr.Mudaliar is Chaplain  
 to Kelloholm Pr. School. He spends    
 much time visiting his parishioners.  </content>
