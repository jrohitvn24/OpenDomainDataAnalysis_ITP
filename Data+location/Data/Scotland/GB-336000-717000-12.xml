		<title>12FARMING..MYRECAIRNIE</title>
		<content>   Myrecairnie is a mixed arable farm  
 growing mainly wheat, barley,         
 potatoes, oats and peas. The most     
 prolific crop is barley which is sold,
 via a merchant, for Â£110 per ton.     
 (this is a reduction from Â£120 per ton
 last year).                           
  Machinery is very important on the   
 farm and accounts for the reduction in
 the number of farm workers employed.  
 Chemicals too are a necessity, both   
 for improving yield and dealing with  
 weeds and pests. The farm requires no 
 artificial drainage or irrigation     
 although it would be possible to      
 instal it if necessary.               
  All the tractors, combine harvesters 
 and farm vehicles have a C.B. radio   
 fitted. A C.B. set in the house means 
 that Mrs.Smith can contact her husband
 or the farm workers at anytime, thus  
 saving valuable time.                 </content>
