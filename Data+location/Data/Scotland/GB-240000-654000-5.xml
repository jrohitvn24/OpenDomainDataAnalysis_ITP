    As the land in the area is not the 
 best of agricultural land, a variety  
 of farming uses are made of it.       
    The majority of farms are beef     
 farms but four of the farms in the    
 district produce milk,though only one 
 has a milking parlour. The milk is    
 then collected by tanker.             
    In one of the local farms, Mid     
 Uplaw,where the acreage is too small  
 to support the family, the farmer     
 stables horses and lets out two of his
 fields for their pasturing. The farmer
 has purchased a sophisticated drainage
 machine and contracts his labour to   
 nearby farmers whose waterlogged      
 fields require much drainage.         
    With horseriding being a favourite 
 local pastime,several farmers are now 
 letting fields for the pasturing of   
 horses.                               </content>
