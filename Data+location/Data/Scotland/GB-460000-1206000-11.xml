		<title>11Unst Football-in general.</title>
		<content> The Unst League started in 1922 with  
 teams from Baltasound, Haroldswick and
 Uyeasound. Each team had a 'B' team so
 there were 6 teams in the League. As  
 people left the island football fell  
 away a bit but in the 1950's with the 
 RAF camp being built teams from there 
 began to compete.There have also been 
 works teams such as a team from the   
 firm Knockbreda who were up building  
 new council houses in the mid-70's. A 
 combined team from Unst also plays in 
 inter-island competitions such as the 
 Parish Cup, as well as playing as RAF 
 'A'and 'B',Northern Rangers(Harolds-  
 wick) and Baltasound United for the   
 Spence Cup which is only for Unst     
 teams. Generally Northern Rangers and 
 the RAF have been the most successful.
