		<content>{At School}we play racing, cricket,    
 rounders, football and horses. British
 Bulldog and toy fights are banned     
 because the are too rough, but we play
 them at home. For PE we play indoor   
 cricket, chain tig, hockey, pirates,  
 dodge-ball and non-stop cricket. We   
 practice athletics. The boys play in  
 football tournaments and the girls    
 play in net-ball tournaments against  
 other schools. We go swimming and are 
 taught to swim properly. We can win   
 badges if we can swim well enough. In 
 the Summer we have a Sports Meeting   
 with two other small country schools. 
 We can also go sailing and            
 orienteering.                         
{At home}we also play swing-ball and   
 tennis. We also play with our pets. If
 it is raining we play on the computer 
 or play cards, houses, schools or     
 Scrabble.                             </content>
