		<title>01Hills south of Grantshouse</title>
		<content> The majority of this block has land   
 over 700 ft with the road running     
 along the foot of the upland ae in the
 good quality agricultural land. The   
 are is predominated by 5 large        
 farms,all of which utilise the land   
 for farming and forestry.A noticeable 
 feature is the removal of hedgerows   
 and fences to make larger fields for  
 more effective farming techniques,    
 also double the normal width of gates.
 Despite the presence of various Iron  
 Age archaeology sites on the upper    
 slopes, the area has not developed    
 much and there are no services due to 
 its location close to Abbey StBatrans 
 and Duuns. At the top of Drakemire    
 hill, good views are afforded to the  
 south to the cheriot hills, across the
 intensiey farmed valley, which        
 contrasts with the new forestry on the
 margna lands of the upper area.       </content>
