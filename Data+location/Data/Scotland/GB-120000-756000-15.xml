		<content>   The roadman's day starts at 9.00am. 
 His day could consist of checking the 
 roads, getting rid of the weeds beside
 the road, clearing ditches, sweeping  
 roads and repairing any damage.       
   Other tasks from time to time might 
 be tarring and chipping the road,     
 sanding the roads during the icy      
 weathers, repairing damage to roadside
 walls and fences.                     
   The roadmen do not have any heavy   
 equipment therefore they have to hire 
 tractors from local farmers and any   
 other heavy equipment has to be       
 brought in from Oban on the boat. From
 time to time a coaster brings in chips
 and tarry metal for the roads.        
   althougth there are two roadmen     
 employed they find it very hard to    
 mentain the roads to the required     
 standard and they would like to see   
 more improvements made to Colls roads.</content>
