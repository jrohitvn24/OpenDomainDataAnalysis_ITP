		<content> Kinbrace is a small rural school with 
 one composite class catering for five 
 to twelve year olds. It was built in  
 1883 and was modernised in 1971. We   
 have television and a microcomputer   
 which even the infants can operate.   
 There are only eleven pupils on the   
 roll and we are more like a family    
 than a school. Midday meals come from 
 Helmsdale a village 27 kilometres     
 away. Pupils travel distances of upto 
 38 kilometres each day. At Christmas  
 we have our party. Santa Claus brings 
 us marvellous presents. In June we    
 have our school sale which is a great 
 success. We sell mouth watering       
 gateaux, begonias, plants, Arran      
 woollens and bags of peat. We have    
 school trips in connection with       
 projects and have visited Culloden    
 Battlefield,Clynelish Distillery,     
 Dornoch Sheriff Court,Dunrobin Castle.</content>
