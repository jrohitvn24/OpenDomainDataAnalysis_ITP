		<title>18TOURISM &amp; ITS IMPORTANCE</title>
		<content> Tourism is an increasingly important  
 aspect of our life here. The last few 
 decades have seen vast improvements in
 facilities enabling the advancement of
 tourism as an industry. Advertising   
 has bought people to our area, the    
 season now lasts for some 8 months the
 busiest two months being July &amp;       
 August. There all types of            
 accommodation from self-catering      
 caravans to luxury hotel rooms. Many  
 people are affected and employed      
 because of Tourism. We are well served
 by a Tourist Office in Lochinver that 
 operate many schemes for helping the  
 Visitors enjoy themselves. The next   
 page is an unashamed advertisement for
 the area of Assynt, justified because 
 of this area's natural unspoilt       
 beauty, and because it will give a    
 better idea of what the area is about.
