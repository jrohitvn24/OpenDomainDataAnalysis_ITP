		<title>05HOUSING IN LAMLASH NORTH.</title>
		<content> The houses at the north east area of  
 the village are mainly old,big and    
 made of sandstone.These houses are    
 used mainly for boarding etc.The      
 situation and area they take differs a
 lot to the more modern                
 establishements,being fairly close to 
 the coast and taking up a fair amount 
 of land.                              
 Moving along the village the houses   
 spread out more and make a            
 considerable change being much smaller
 and further away from the sea.There   
 are some areas in the centre of the   
 village that are crammed together a   
 bit more such as the Hamilton Terraces
 built for the clearances.These houses 
 and terraces continue to carry on a   
 south westerly direction while the    
 road where most of the other houses   
 previously followed goes in a more    
 southerly direction.                  </content>
