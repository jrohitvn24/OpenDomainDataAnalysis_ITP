		<title>13EMPLOYMENT IN LEUCHARS</title>
		<content> Leuchars and district is dominated by 
 the local RAF station, which is the   
 main employer.  Approximately 2000    
 people are employed on the base, most 
 of whom are servicemen.  On the other 
 hand many local people are employed in
 ancillary jobs, in stores and canteens
 in the grounds.  Naturally the RAF was
 not very forthcoming with information.
 At present large numbers are also     
 employed in a major building programme
 on the airfield.  The village shops   
 and services provide work for about 35
 full-time staff and a few part-time   
 staff.  The local primary school      
 employs 12 teachers and 7 other staff,
 most of whom travel to work.  In      
 common with most villages of this     
 size, a number of people travel to    
 work by car to work in Dundee, St     
 Andrews and Cupar.
