		<content> Seven churches can be found within    
 Erskine, two of which are Roman       
 Catholic churches, St. John Bosco and 
 St. Bernadettes.  The other five are -
 The New Baptist Church,The Church of  
 the Nazarene,The Scottish Episcopal   
 Church,The Church of Scotland and The 
 Old Parish Church.  The churches are  
 well attended, except for the Scottish
 Episcopal Church which has only a     
 small congregation each Sunday.  Two  
 of the churches meet in Bargarran     
 Community Centre to hold their        
 services.  The oldest of the church   
 buildings is the Old Parish Church in 
 Ferry Road, Bishopton.  Unfortunately,
 the churches do not meet the religious
 requirements of foreigners who come to
 Erskine.
