		<title>02INDUSTRIES IN BO'NESS</title>
		<content>  There are quite a few industries in  
 Bo'ness along the foreshore. There are
 3 woodyards, Robinson &amp; Dunn, Walker  
 Timber and the Smith Brothers. The    
 woodyards were originally built in    
 Bo'ness to be near the docks so the   
 wood could be easily transported from 
 other countries.                      
  Stephen Dolton Shipbreakers is now   
 closing down. It has been working for 
 80 years.                             
  Shieldness is a potato factory. It   
 makes frozen chips and potatoes but it
 only caters for restaurants and cafes.
  There are 2 foundries Ballantine and 
 Bo'ness Iron Company.                 
  Robertson the builders who have built
 many houses in Bo'ness and much of    
 Central Scotland have a factory here. 
  E.J.S. and Cochranes engineering     
 firms have factories in the area.
