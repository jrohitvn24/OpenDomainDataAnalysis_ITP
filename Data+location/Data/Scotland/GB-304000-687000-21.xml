We surveyed all the pupils in our school and asked them what their favourite meal was for school dinners.  &lt;br />&lt;br />The most popular food was "hotdogs" and pizza was the 2nd  most popular food. Macaroni and baguette were the 3rd most popular foods and beef burgers being the 4th most popular food.&lt;br />&lt;br />Baked potatoes were the least popular food for school dinners. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
