		<content>    There is{one primary school}in the 
 area,{Stracathro School.}In the first 
 half of the 20th century, the roll was
 over 100, but with the building of a  
 dual-carriageway, the A94, 3 km to the
 south,{transport facilities to the    
{town are increased}and those who live 
 by the road or beyond it, travel to   
 Brechin for their schooling.          
    The{decline in the number of farm  
{workers due to automation and changes 
{in land-use,}have contributed to the  
 fact that the{school roll is now 15,  
 11 boys and 4 girls. Of these, 4 live 
 outwith Stracathro School catchment   
 area.
