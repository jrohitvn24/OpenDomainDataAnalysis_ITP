		<content> Forestry - extensive coniferous       
 monoculture of Sitka Spruce with      
 European larch at boundaries. Main    
 A850 Broadford/Kyleakin road runs     
 through this area and has been        
 recently modernised (1981-82).  The   
 rough grazing to the north of the road
 and bordering the shoreline are       
 utilised by a flock of mainly Scottish
 Blackface sheep (being improved, with 
 a weaving percentage of 85-90), and a 
 herd of spring calving suckler cows,  
 Aberdeen Angus and Hereford cross.    
 The shore is used by people to        
 supplement their income by gathering  
 whelks (Cittorina Littorea) mainly in 
 the winter.  The large sea area is not
 rich in Pelagic or Demersal fish      
 stocks but there is a thriving        
 commercial shell-fish fishery included
 in this section.  There are no human  
 habitations in this area.             </content>
