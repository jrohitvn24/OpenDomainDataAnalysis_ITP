		<title>04Tv Reception in FINTRY</title>
		<content>{Official television reception dates   
{from 1981,}when a relay station was   
 built at Hill of Balgair to transpose 
 the frequency and re-direct the signal
 from the Killearn transmitter. The    
 village now enjoys 3 channels on the  
 625 system. Channel 4 is scheduled for
 1987. Potentially 95% of households   
 are able to receive good tv reception.
 Just two houses are excluded by       
 natural obstacles. Interference from  
 the Burntisland transmitter for some  
 is a problem.                         
                                       
 Prior to all this tv viewing was for  
 the lucky few who received pictures   
 bounced off the hills. One enthusiast 
 is still at work. Using a dish aerial 
 he has proved that perfect reception  
 from{satellites}transmitting across   
 the breadth of Russia is available in 
 the village.                          </content>
