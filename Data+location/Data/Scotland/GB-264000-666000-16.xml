		<title>16TRANSPORT - THE MICROBUS</title>
		<content>   This is a new kind of Local         
 Authority transport which replaces the
 usual 75-seater double-decker buses   
 with{12-seater mini-buses. }These     
 Micros, unlike the normal buses, do   
 not follow fixed routes.  Their routes
 are from{Easterhouse Shopping Centre  
 to wherever the passengers wish to go 
 ( within the limits of the local      
 boundaries ).                         
   The demand for Micros arose due to  
 the distance passengers had to walk   
 from bus stops to their homes, and    
 also the high cost ot Taxi fares.     
   A fixed fare of 50p is charged      
 (comparing very favourably with the   
 Â£1.50 plus charged by taxis).         
   A group of neighbours may book the  
 Micro to uplift them at a given time  
 and return to collect them when their 
 shopping is finished.
