		<content>    There is now no police house in    
 Milnathort or anywhere in our         
 block.{Police patrols}regularly and   
 frequently visit the village and      
 travel the rural roads. When doing    
 night patrols the two-man crew will   
 leave their car in the middle of      
 Milnathort and patrol on foot. Their  
 personal radios keep them in touch    
 with{Kinross Police Station,}and they 
 can use their car's radio to relay    
 messages to Perth, or even Dundee.    
    The road patrols have often been   
 called to accidents on the A911 Mil-  
 nathort to Leslie(Fife) road, many of 
 these having been at Channel Bends,   
 4km from Milnathort.                  
    The local police are pleased to be 
 involved with the community. This has 
 helped to maintain the low crime rate 
 in this part of{Tayside.}Co-operation 
 between police and public is very good</content>
