		<title>10HEALTH PROVISION IN BARR</title>
		<content> The village of Barr is too small to   
 have it's own resident doctor.Most of 
 the people in the area go to          
 Dr.Robertson who lives and has his    
 main surgery in the village of Dailly.
 On certain days of the  week the      
 doctor uses the village hall as a     
 surgery.The doctor also dispenses     
 medicines,which is handy as there is  
 not a chemist in the village.         
 There is a health visitor who usually 
 visits new-born babies and old-folk.  
 The mobile dentist's caravan visits   
 the school twice a year to check the  
 school children's teeth.Four times a  
 year the chiropodist's caravan comes  
 to the school playground-this time for
 the adults.                           
 The nearest hospital is at Girvan.    
 There are limited facilities,in Girvan
 for the mentally and physically       
 handicapped.                          </content>
