		<content>       GIRVAN has a wide choice of     
 places of worship including two       
 Churches of Scotland,one Roman        
 Catholic,one Methodist,one Baptist,one
 Church of England,one Jehova's        
 Witness,one Plymouth Brethren and one 
 Christian Scientist. The vast majority
 of worshippers are Church of Scotland 
 and Roman Catholic.                   
       Although there was considerable 
 antagonism in the past there is little
 sign of any acrimony today. This is   
 borne out by the fact that although   
 the large Girvan Primary is next door 
 to Sacred Heart,incidents are few and 
 far between.                          
      Local clergy act as chaplains to 
 the local schools,making visits to    
 speak to the children.Terms often end 
 with a Church service.
