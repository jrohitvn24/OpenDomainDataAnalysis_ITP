		<title>11A Mackie Academy School Day</title>
		<content> The school day starts at 08:55 with   
 registration. This lasts ten minutes. 
 Then there are 6*20 minute modules of 
 classes before interval. Interval is  
 11:05 to 11:20 and the tuckshop is    
 busy then. Favourite buys are Mars    
 bars, Yorkie bars, Crisps, Coca Cola  
 and Fanta. After interval there are   
 4*20 minute modules of lessons. Lunch 
 is 12:40 to 13:50. Many school lunches
 are eaten in the three dinning halls. 
 Some pupils bring a packed lunch of   
 sandwiches, fruit and yoghurt (and    
 crisps!) and eat this around the      
 school. Some pupils go in to          
 Stonehaven town and buy pies or local 
 sausage rolls from the local bakers'  
 shop. After lunch there are rather a  
 lot of food wrappers lying around (tin
 cans, plastic bottles, paper bags,    
 plastic bags, cardboard cartons and   
 plastic film) from 13:50 to 13:55     </content>
