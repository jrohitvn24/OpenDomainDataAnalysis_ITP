 This is played with two teams, a bat  
 and a ball. One team bowls and fields 
 the ball while the other team bats.   
 The batsman hits the ball as far as he
 can and runs past several posts around
 the outside of the game area. He stops
 when the fielding team retrieve the   
 ball.  If he is between posts, he can 
 be 'out' if a fielder hits the next   
 post with the ball before he can reach
 it.  The team take it in turns to bat,
 adding 1 point for each uninterrupted 
 run round the course.  A team is out  
 when either no-one is left in to bat  
 or one of the fielding team catches   
 the ball before it reaches the ground.
 When a team has built up a score of 5 
 rounders, we play that they can buy   
 back a player who has been caught out.
