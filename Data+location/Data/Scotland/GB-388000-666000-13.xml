		<title>13A HISTORY OF OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> OUR SCHOOL WAS BUILT IN 1886 THE      
 ROLL WAS THEN 120 PUPILS,AGED         
 BETWEEN 5 AND 14 YEARS. THE           
 HEADMASTER WAS MR. ALEXANDER GIBSON   
 AND THERE WAS ANOTHER INFANT TEACHER  
 . THE PLAYGROUND WAS ALL MUDDY AND    
 THERE WAS A SCRAPPER AT THE DOOR SO   
 THAT THEY COULD CLEAN OF THE MUD.     
 THERE WERE TWO ENTRANCES, ONE FOR     
 THE GIRLS AND THE OTHER FOR THE       
 BOYS. THE TOILETS WERE OUTSIDE AND    
 IN WINTER THE TEACHER HAD TO BREAK    
 THE ICE BEFORE THEY COULD BE USED.    
 IT WAS COLD BECAUSE THERE WAS ONLY    
 ONE COAL FIRE AND A VENTILATOR IN THE 
 FLOOR WHICH LET IN VERY COLD AIR      
 .THERE WAS NO ELECTRICITY AND THEY HAD
 TO DO THINGS LIKE SINGING WHEN IT     
 GOT TOO DARK IN WINTER.YOU LEFT       
 SCHOOL ON THE DAY YOU WERE FOURTEEN   
 YOU HAD TO SIT IN ROWS AND YOU WERE   
 NOT ALLOWED TO TALK AT ALL..          </content>
