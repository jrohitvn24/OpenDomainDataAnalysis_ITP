		<title>10FERRY SERVICES TO RHUM</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Caledonian Macbrayne ferry, The   
 Lochmor (passenger ferry only) sails  
 from Mallaig 4 times a week stopping  
 at Canna, Rhum, Eigg and sometimes    
 Muck. It calls at Rhum on a Monday and
 a Wednesday afternoon, and on a       
 Thursday and Saturday morning. In the 
 summer the Lochmor runs twice on a    
 Saturday. Each year the Lochmor goes  
 off for servicing and is replaced by  
 the Pioneer for several weeks.        
 The Lochmor also carries mail and     
 freight for delivery to the islands.  
                                       
 During the summer there is a small    
 tourist boat from Arisaig that comes  
 to the island on a Tuesday and        
 Thursday afternoon. This boat, called 
 the Shearwater, allows tourists to    
 come for several hours on these       
 afternoons.                           </content>
