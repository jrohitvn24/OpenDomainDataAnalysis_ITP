		<content> Unemployment in Port Glasgow has      
 increased in the last few years due to
 the decline in the shipbuilding       
{industry.}Despite of this the majority
 of the male{population}in Port Glasgow
 are employed in the shipyards.The     
 industrial estate employs a number of 
 people but a large number of their    
 employees come from outside Port      
 Glasgow.A number of people work       
 outside Port Glasgow in the           
{electronics}industry in Greenock and  
 the munitions factory in Bishopton.For
                                       
 school leavers the future is very     
 bleak and the majority of 16_18 year  
 olds are unemployed,although the      
 government has set up a college       
 programme for this age group which    
 alongside the YTS is helping to keep  
 the unemployment figures from         
 rocketing.                            </content>
