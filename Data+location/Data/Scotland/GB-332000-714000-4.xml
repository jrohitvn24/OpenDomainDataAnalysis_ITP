		<title>04ECOLOGY..ABANDONED QUARRY</title>
		<content> In our area there are several small   
 abondoned whinstone quarries . One of 
 these is on the slopes of Mount Hill  
 and lies about 700 metres West of     
 Mount Farm. The pool which has formed 
 in the quarry covers an area of about 
 600 square metres and it is surrounded
 by shrubs,trees,gorse and reeds. The  
 site offers an excellent habitat for  
 plants and animals including wild     
 duck,moorhen,frogs,newts and insects. 
 The waters in the pool seem quite     
 clean though there are traces of oil  
 pollution. This is unfortunate because
 parts of the site are marred by a dump
 for local farm rubbish. Boulders,     
 scrap metal, plastic and old fencing  
 have been allowed to despoil the      
 site.Hopefully in the future the site 
 will be cleaned up and preserved as a 
 small but valuable local wildlife     
 habitat.                              </content>
