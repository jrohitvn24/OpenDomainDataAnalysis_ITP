		<title>20Ballingry: Credits</title>
		<content>  This D-block was surveyed by pupils  
 of Rooms 8,9,10,11,and 12 at Benarty  
 Primary School, Ballingry. Although   
 several of them have been named       
 individually at the ends of text      
 pages, many more were involved in one 
 capacity or another and deserve credit
 for their hard work and helpful       
 suggestions.                          
                                       
  The work was co-ordinated by Miss A  
 McBride, with valuable assistance from
 other teachers, in particular Mrs J   
 Martin, Mrs M Lyall, Mr G Gibson, Mrs 
 E Gow and Mr S Napier.                
                                       
  Thanks are also due to some parents  
 and other members of the community who
 helped in small or large ways to      
 gather information.
