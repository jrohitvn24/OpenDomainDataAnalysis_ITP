		<title>07Riding Of The Marches</title>
		<content>  {Annan Riding Of The Marches}has been
 going strong since the 1930's. It is  
 hoped that it will carry on going     
 strong in the years ahead of us.      
   The talent contest which is held    
 each year in the Victoria Hall is full
 of excitement. There are lots of ride 
 outs before Riding of the Marches Day.
   At the Riding Of The Marches there  
 is usually a band on the big stage.   
   Down the High Street the horses     
 gallop round the town boundaries until
 they stop for a rest. If you hold a   
 horse you are given a ticket and with 
 the ticket you can get a packet of    
 crisps and a bottle of lemonade.      
   Annan majorettes are going on stage 
 for the crowning of the Queen Of The  
 Border. It is on the 24.6.85.The queen
 is usually a pupil of Annan Academy.  
 Riding Of The Marches Day is always   
 the first Saturday in July.           </content>
