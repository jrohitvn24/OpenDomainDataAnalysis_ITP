		<title>04Housing south: FINTRY</title>
		<content> The oldest part of the village occurs 
 around the road junction at Gonachan  
 Cottage. What remains of the original 
 settlement has been modernised. This  
 is the site of Fintry's first school. 
                                       
 The stretch by the Kirk, saving the   
 old manses, also consists of cottages 
 improved and modernised. Even the     
 Clachan Hotel had such a humble start.
                                       
 The Main Street which traverses Fintry
 Cross used to be New Town Fintry. It  
 has also been largely modernised or,  
 as in the case of the council flats,  
 rebuilt. There has also been some     
 infilling with new properties.        
                                       
 Over the bridge on the Kippen Road the
 council estate extends into this      
 square. Completely post-war built some
 houses are now privately owned.       </content>
