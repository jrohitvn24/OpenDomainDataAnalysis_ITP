		<content> On May 3,1891 the Honourable Company  
 of Edinburgh Golfers opened their new 
 course at Muirfield .In 1892 the first
 Open to be held at Muirfield was won  
 by H.H.Hilton. The course record of 63
 is held by Asao Aoki.                 
 Women and children can only play golf 
 if accompanied by a member,women are  
 not normally allowed into the club.As 
 the club is anxious to preserve the   
 course it therefore only encourages   
 competitions such as the Open and the 
 Ryder Cup.                            
                                       
 Greywalls Hotel was built in 1901,the 
 architect was Sir Edward Lutyens.The  
 hotel has maintained its original     
 family house atmosphere.Sports        
 facilities available include tennis   
 and croquet.                          
 Food requirements are obtained country
 wide and wine is bought {(cont. P11)  </content>
