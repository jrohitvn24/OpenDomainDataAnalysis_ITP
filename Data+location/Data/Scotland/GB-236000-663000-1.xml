		<title>01BRIDGE OF WEIR - SOUTH WEST</title>
		<content> Most of the land in this block lies   
 above above 76m with a few high points
 up to 165m.The land is mainly used for
{dairy farming.}                       
  The small town of{Bridge of Weir}-   
 population circa 7,000 - is situated  
 in the North West corner of the block 
 and straddles the{River Gryffe.}A     
 high percentage of the people work in 
 the{nearbye city of Glasgow}or in     
 neighbouring towns.                   
  Most people own their own houses and 
 these are attractively built on a     
 steep hillside on one side of the     
 Gryffe. Others live in pleasant houses
 rented from the  District Council.    
  There is very little{industry}in the 
 area but there are two leather works  
 which are the only remaining evidence 
 of small industries including cotton  
 mills which flourished along the      
 Gryffe in the early 19th century.     </content>
