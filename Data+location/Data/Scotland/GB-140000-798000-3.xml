		<content> C14 determinations obtained from burnt
 hazelnut shells in one of the pits    
 showed that the earliest human        
 activity on the site was infact some  
 of the earliest evidence of people    
 anywhere in Scotland. As the climate  
 improved at the end of the last Ice   
 Age, 8500 years ago, people were      
 already visiting Rhum to make camp for
 at least part of every year. These    
 people did not farm the land, the     
 island would have provided plenty of  
 food: animals, birds, fish, shellfish,
 plants, nuts and berries. They visited
 Guirdil on the west coast to collect  
 Rhum Bloodstone which was flaked and  
 shaped to provide sharp edges for     
 cutting, arrowheads for hunting, and  
 many other tools. They did not use    
 metals but there has been found much  
 waste from making stone tools as well 
 as debris from using/resharpening them</content>
