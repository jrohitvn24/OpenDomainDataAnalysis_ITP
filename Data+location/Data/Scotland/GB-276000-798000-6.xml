		<title>06FARMING IN BADENOCH - 3</title>
		<content> As the farms here lie close to, if not
 in, the flood plain of the Spey Valley
 the risk of{flooding}is constant.  The
 Spey waters are held back at{Spey Dam,
 some 14 miles up river and if the     
 overflow gates are opened due to a    
 build up there a sudden heavy flow    
 ensues. In such circumstances the     
 police are notified and a{flood       
{warning telephone system}instigated.  
 A call at{4 am}is not unusual and     
 farmers may have to venture out to    
 ensure the livestock will be safe.  To
 round up and count 70 head of cattle  
 on a dark and stormy night requires a 
 special{dedication}and of course his  
 whole livlihood depends on this       
 commitment. His work is a 7 day week  
 job although, once the livestock is   
 attended to time can be found for     
 market, shopping or a game of{curling.
