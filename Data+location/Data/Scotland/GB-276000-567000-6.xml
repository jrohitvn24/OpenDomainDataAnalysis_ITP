		<content> After breakfast there are many        
 jobs that may need done.              
 Machinery may need to be fixed.       
 If it is the winter he will take      
 hay to the cows in the fields. If it  
 is summer he will have to look after  
 pregnant cows. When a cow has had a   
 calf, the calf and mother must be     
 separated. This is a difficult task   
 and will need everyone to help.       
 After lunch crops must be seen to and 
 then at four o'clock the milking must 
 be done again. Mr Edgar goes to bed at
 10 o'clock after he has checked the   
 animals. Sometimes if a cow is calving
 or sick he does not go to bed.
