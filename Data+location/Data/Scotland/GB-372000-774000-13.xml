		<content> The main bus service has stops at     
 Fordoun twelve times a day, six on the
 way north to Aberdeen via Stonehaen   
 and six on the way south to Dundee.   
 Since the building of the dual        
 carriageway th secondary school bus   
 comes down the A92 from Stonehaven to 
 Inverbervie and crosses from there to 
 A94.  In a ten minute period during a 
 weekday the following vehicles went   
 past Fordoun: 44 cars, 24 lorries, 12 
 vans and 2 trains.  Trains pass very  
 close to Fordoun.  The station is now 
 disused.  Very near our area is a     
 airfield which  is discused except for
 a light plane which flies at the      
 weekend, sometimes carrying parachute 
 jumpers.
