 and Dundee District,  BEAT have       
 already constructed a{playpark}and{a  
{specially designed wall}in Union St; a
 mosaic picture in Tait's Lane was     
 designed by children.                 
  There complementary scheme under     
 which artists are commissioned:       
   Peter Flynn's fences in Lochee are  
{89 six foot squares}which have been   
 stained and dyed to avoid the problems
 of graffitti.In Belfield St there are 
{4 decorative tiled panels}on the wall 
 of the coach depot,made by Kenny Munro
