		<title>20Agriculture in Laggan</title>
		<content> There are 4 farms in the given area.  
 All the farms have beef cattle and    
 hill sheep. Farmers have been very    
 successful in finding new methods of  
 cultivating and harvesting crops. The 
 Laggan Machinery group have helped in 
 doing this. The spring and summer are 
 the busiest seasons. In the spring the
 lambing takes a while. The sheep      
 clipping and hay-making take up a lot 
 of the time in the summer. An old     
 tradition in Laggan is that everybody 
 in the farm helps with the hay and    
 potato picking. Sheep have to be      
 thouroughly dipped early in the year. 
 Crops grown are barly, grass, oil-seed
 rape and turnips either for silage or 
 fodder. Our climate is very severe and
 the farmers fight a constant battle   
 with the weather.
