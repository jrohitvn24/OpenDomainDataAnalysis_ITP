		<title>16  RAILWAY_ MAUD JUNCTION</title>
		<content>    The London &amp; North Eastern railway 
 station used to be the main part of   
 local activity.Five trains each way   
 per day brought papers &amp; post,        
 commercial travellers &amp; calves. Maud  
 was the junction where the carriages  
 from Aberdeen split into two sections 
 one heading for Peterhead &amp; the other 
 for Fraserburgh with goods sidings    
 too, a bookstall &amp; refreshment rooms. 
    Now Willowherb grows out of the    
 platform, broom &amp; snowberry bushes    
 encroach on the one time track.The    
 station buildings are boarded up &amp;    
 used by children as hutties to play   
 in.                                   
    The railway came to Maud in 1870   
 and the Station Hotel was built at    
 about this time.It has been owned by a
 Hendry for about a 100 years.The      
 railway closed in 1963 for passengers 
 and goods trains stopped in 1978.     </content>
