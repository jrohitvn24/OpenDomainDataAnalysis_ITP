		<content> Stroma is an island in the Pentland   
 firth. 3 kilometers north west of John
 O'Groats in Caithness.                
 The island is 3 kilometers long and 1 
 1/2-2 kilometers wide. It was         
 inhabited until the 1960's when its   
 economy declined and it was abandoned.
 There are several crofts and a school 
 all of which are now derelict. The    
 only inhabitants on Stroma now are    
 three lighthouse keepers in the       
 lighthouse at the north of the island 
 at Swilkie Point.  Access to Stroma is
 difficult becaue there is no longer   
 any boat service.                     
 This area of the survey includes the  
 north of Stroma there is a singl rod  
 running north-south along the island  
 with several derelict crofts nearby   
 At the northern tip is the Stroma     
 Lighthouse which marks the passage    
 through the Pentland Firth.           </content>
