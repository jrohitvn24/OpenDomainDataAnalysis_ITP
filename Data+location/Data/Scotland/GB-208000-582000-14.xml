		<title>14Home Life in Ballantrae.</title>
		<content> In this mainly agricultural area,few  
 homes have human domestic help.Most   
 own vacuum cleaner,fridge,clothes     
 washing machine and electric iron.Many
 have long term food freezers and food 
 mixers.Cooking mainly by electricity  
 or butane gas.There are few microwave 
 cookers.Much food is bought canned,   
 frozen or dehydrated,although there is
 increasing tendency to popularise     
 unprocessed food,especially grains and
 vegetables and eat less meat.All are  
 well clothed and fed.A few houses have
 full automatic oil or propane gas     
 central heating.Others have partial   
 central heating from living room coal 
 fire.Personal home safety is largely  
 ignored but household fires must have 
 metal guard where there are young     
 children.Dogs,cats,rabbits,guinea     
 pigs,hamsters,birds,fish are pets.Most
 houses have gardens and colour TV.    </content>
