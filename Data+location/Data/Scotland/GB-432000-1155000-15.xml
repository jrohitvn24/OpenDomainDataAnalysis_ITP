		<content> The{church}belongs to the Church of   
 Scotland. About 30 children go to the 
 Sunday School and about 15-30 people  
 go to church services.                
 There is no minister living in Aith   
 anymore so the minister from Walls, a 
 village near by, takes the services.  
 The{school}is a Junior High.It was    
 opened in the summer of 1982. It      
 has a swimming pool, a multi-court,   
 football and hockey pitches. There    
 are 16 teachers including visiting    
 ones. There are 76 primary pupils and 
 64 secondary.                         
 The{hall}was built in 1927 but after  
 52 years it had to be rebuilt. The    
 rebuilding was finished in April 1982.
 Now the hall is in use regulary for   
 badminton, the S.W.R.I., the R.N.L.I.,
 weddings, etc.
