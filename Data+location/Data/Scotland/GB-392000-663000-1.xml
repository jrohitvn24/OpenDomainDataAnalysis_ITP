		<content>{INTRODUCTION TO EYEMOUTH}             
 Eyemouth is situated on the North Sea 
 coast 44 miles east of Edinburgh and  
 61 miles north of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
 The town grew up due to the rare      
 opportunity on this rocky coastline of
 a natural harbour surrounded by       
 relatively low lying and fertile land.
 The town grew steadily as a market and
 a port for the surrounding            
 agricultural area.  Fishing has always
 been the traditional industry of the  
 town with men employed on the boats   
 and women in the fish curing.  The    
 unique arrangement of buildings and   
 spaces in the harbour area,           
 Church Street, Market Place and High  
 Street, tightly clustered for shelter 
 and defence is a characteristic of the
 old town.  Narrow two storey building 
 with pitched roofs, slates, pantiles, 
 stone and render are typical.         </content>
