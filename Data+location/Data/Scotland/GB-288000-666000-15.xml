		<content>   The{library}was opened in 1975 by   
 our Regional Councillor William       
 Drummond.                             
   At present the library has 667      
 members. On average each members takes
 44{books}out in a year. This year the 
 libraries output went up slightly     
 because of unemployment.              
    Every year  a letter comes         
 through our doors asking people       
 who haven't joined to join. The{      
 library comprises of two sections,one 
 for under fourteens and another for   
 over fourteens. The librarian likes   
 ordering new books and recommending   
 books to readers. One librarian has   
 been there for 23 years. She hates    
 working late nights and on Saturdays. 
 The other librarian has been there for
 6 years. She likes reading books out  
 of the library and she hates cheeky   
 children.                             </content>
