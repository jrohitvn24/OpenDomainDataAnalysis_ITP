		<title>16FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content>  In Gordon most families are together 
 at night and in the morning.The       
 children set off for school and the   
 father to work.The mother is          
 left on her own to do the daily chores
 or else go to work.At lunch the family
 might meet again. At night when       
 everyone's home they have dinner and a
 family chat.Later at night when the   
 dishes are washed and so on the family
 will sit down beside the fire and     
 watch T.V.Some of the family might    
 play a board game or they might       
 make something.Mother might go to the 
 rural or to a sale of work and father 
 and children might watch T.V, play a  
 game or something.When mum comes home 
 the children would go to bed and later
 mum and dad would come.At the weekends
 families might go on a day trip       
 somewhere because everyone's at home. 
 On Sundays they might go to church.   </content>
