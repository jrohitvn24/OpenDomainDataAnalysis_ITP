		<content> At the bottom end of one of the lakes 
 is a monument to a member of the      
 Queensberry family.This monument      
 stands in the middle of the family    
 burial ground on Gooley Hill.         
                                       
 The monument is said to commemorate   
 one of the family who died in         
 sucpicious circumstances in one of the
 lakes.Also in this area of the grounds
 is a quaint little{summer house}which 
 in the hey-day of Kinmount circa 1900 
 was used for all night parties or for 
 drinking tea in the long summer days. 
 There is also on the lake,the remains 
 of a {boat house}used to store the    
 gondalas of the early 20th century.   
                                       
 As you walk up to the house along the 
 long winding drive you see what you   
 think is a well preserved relic of    
 Scotlands ducal past.                 </content>
