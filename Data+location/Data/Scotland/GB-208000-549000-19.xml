		<title>19LANDSCAPE AT SANDHEAD</title>
		<content>    The most obvious feature of our    
 block is the sea and its beach. One   
 rarely looses sight of it because of  
 the rise of the land away from beach  
 level. A second very prominent feature
 is an escarpment, which is called "   
 the raised beach " because it is said 
 to have been left as the last Ice Age 
 receeded and the sea level dropped.   
 Once on top of the escarpment the view
 is of gently rolling grasslands, with 
 the occasional small wood, mainly     
 conifers, planted where the ground is 
 not suitable for cultivation. Trees   
 are obviously planted on the " STEEPY 
 ", as the slope of the escarpment is  
 called, and they shelter the village  
 nestling at its foot. At the south end
 of the village and high above it, is  
 the school and the Stairmount housing 
 scheme, deriving its name from the    
 steps to be climbed to reach it.      </content>
