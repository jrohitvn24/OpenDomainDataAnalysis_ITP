 In Cummertrees Parish smuggling was   
 very common.Houses were specially     
 built for smuggling goods.Hill house  
 has still got cellars that were used. 
 The people that lived in Hill House   
 boasted that they had brandy porridge 
 for breakfast.People even gave a name 
 to a track called Brandy Loaning which
 leads from Powfoot to the main road.  
 In 1894 a company from Liverpool      
 called Bell and Burnie decided to open
 up a factory here,and built 4 brick   
 terraces for their workers.There were 
 great plans to make Powfoot into a    
 holiday resort which failed due to the
 fact that the vital sea wall was never
 built,because of objections from the  
 fishermen.There are still fishermen at
 Powfoot today.                        </content>
