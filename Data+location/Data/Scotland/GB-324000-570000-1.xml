       On 17th of December,Kirkpatrick 
 Fleming Primary 6 and 7 put on their  
 showing of Dick Whittington at the    
 village hall.It was Mrs Jonstone who  
 made the costumes they were each      
 measured to fit.I played Dick,it was  
 good fun but I got a bit nervous on   
 the night.Some of the boys had to wear
 tights and I wore my mum's boots. I   
 could not walk to start with but I got
 used to it.We hardly did any work so  
 that was an improvment.               
                                       
                                       
                      Richard          
                          Burnett.
