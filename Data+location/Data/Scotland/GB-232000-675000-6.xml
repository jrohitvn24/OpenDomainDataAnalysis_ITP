		<content>      The Cardross farms we visited    
 were mixed farms. At the first farm   
 the family have been farming there for
 82 years. Both farms had Friesian     
 and Ayrshire dairy cows. The first    
 farm milked their cows at 08:30,and   
 the second farm milked their cows at  
 04:00.The smaller farm is 250 acres   
 and the cows produce 156 gallons of   
 milk per day. The milk is collected by
 the Scottish Milk Marketing Board     
 tanker and taken to Millerston in     
 Glasgow. The main crops grown are hay 
 and barley:hay is harvested in June   
 and barley in August. Both farms also 
 keep beef cattle, 70% of which are    
 slaughtered and the remaining 30% sold
 at markets either in Stirling or      
 Paisley. Both farms also kept sheep,  
 one having a flock of 500. The sheep  
 are sheared in June.Summer is the     
 busiest time of the year.             </content>
