		<content> The first week of May is the most     
 important month of the whole year in  
 this district.Artificial and natural  
 manures are spread on the grass and   
 the cattle which have been kept inside
 for six months are put out to feed.The
 farmer sows barley which is used for  
 winter feed.Cutting of grass for      
 silage starts in June. Some of the    
 fields of grass are kept for hay and  
 others for summer feed of cattle.     
 Practically every farm is given over  
 to beef cattle production.In August   
 the barley is cut and dressed with a  
 chemical called 'propcorn' to prevent 
 it going mouldy.At the beginning of   
 November the cattle are brought in and
 fed every day and the byre cleaned.   
 From the middle of February until May,
 calving keeps the farmer busy.
