		<content> Newtown and St.Boswells have many     
 historical connections.Standing in the
 shadow of the Eildon Hills we are     
 reminded of the Roman connection. On  
 Hill North was the Iron Age settlement
 of the Selgovae tribe which later gave
 way to a Roman signal station.Dere    
 Street, the Roman road,forms part of  
 the present A68.                      
     Some Newtown inhabitants have been
 known to be incensed by the commonly  
 held belief that,as its name implies, 
 it is a recent settlement.In fact     
 records from as far abck as 1530      
 establish Newtown as a thriving       
 settlement.Both villages do have      
 connections with abbeys.St.Boswells   
 with St.Boisil who came with St.Aidan 
 to Melrose,and Newtown with Dryburgh  
 Abbey whose tenants brought grain to  
 Newtown Corn Mill.
