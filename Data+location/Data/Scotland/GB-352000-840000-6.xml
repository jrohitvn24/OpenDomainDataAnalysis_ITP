		<title>06WOODLAND NORTH OF HUNTLY</title>
		<content> The block to the north of Huntly is   
 appropximatly one third coverd by     
 woodland,most of which is owned by the
 Forestry Commision.The main forests   
 are the Bin Forest and the Hill of    
 Greenfold.                            
 The most common tree on the Hill of   
 Greenfold and the Bin section of      
 Buchan Forest is the Picea Abies      
 (Norway Spruce).The Forestry Commision
 harvest the trees when they have      
 reached the age of maximum growth,for 
 Norway Spruce it is on average 55-60  
 years.When the trees are  years old   
 they are thinned to allow the stronger
 trees to have a better chance to      
 grow.The land was bought by thee      
 Forestry Commision in 1927.
