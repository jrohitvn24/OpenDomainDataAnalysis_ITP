		<title>16FAMILY LIFE IN PENICUIK</title>
		<content> There are two children in my family,  
 my brother called Kenneth aged 13 and 
 me.  I am a girl called Karen and I am
 12 years old.  Both my mum and dad    
 work.  My dad is employed by the      
 Institute of Geological Buildings.    
 About three times a year he goes out  
 to sea collecting rocks.  My mum is a 
 cleaner at Mauricewood Primary        
 School.It is a part-time job.  We live
 in a semi-detached 5 apartment house  
 in a private housing estate called    
 Mauricewood.  We have a V.W. car.     
 Every Monday and Thursday we go to    
 Penicuik Harriers which is an         
 athletics club.  There is lots to do  
 but we prefer just to run. Most       
 weekends we are away to different     
 places to run.  We have two colour and
 one black and white television.  We   
 have a Dragon 32 computer at home.
