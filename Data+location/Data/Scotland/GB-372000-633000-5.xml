		<title>05The Great Tweed Raft Race</title>
		<content> Every year in Kelso there is a Raft   
 Race on the River{Tweed.}The race is  
 six miles long and it starts in Kelso 
 and ends in England which is out of   
 our block on our map. There are two   
 separate races; the{Fancy Dress race  
 and the{Speed race.}The fancy dress   
 rafts go off first because they are   
 slow. It takes at least three hours   
 for all the rafts to come down the    
 Tweed. Lots and lots of people from   
 all over Britain take part every year.
 The fancy dress rafts are often very  
 funny. Some of the best ones have been
 elephants, Donald Duck and once there 
 was even a 25 metre long battleship!  
 Thousands of people gather every year 
 along the banks of the Tweed to watch 
 the race. A lot of factories in Kelso 
 enter rafts for the race. The Kelso   
 Laddies Association and the Round     
 Table organise the raft race.         </content>
