		<content>{Rippin_Structural Steel Buildings.    
 Rippin's main market in Fife is on the
 agricultural side. Their structures   
 are used by farmers for trctor sheds, 
 barns, potato stores and grain stores 
 to name but a few. Each building is   
 custom made to each buyer's           
 requirements and in the case of       
 farming Rippin tries to make its      
 buildings blend in with existing      
 structures, as well as with the       
 countryside. Ninety percent of the    
 farms within a 80 km radius of        
 Auchtermuchty will have at least one  
 Rippin structure.                     
 1984 was a good year for Rippin's. Its
 output of steel structures rose from  
 6000 tonnes in 1983 to 7000 tonnes and
 already the prospect is for yet       
 another increase in output to between 
 8000 and 8500 tonnes in 1985.
