		<content> An awareness of the ecological value  
 of the area has prompted conservation 
 minded pupils at Loudoun Academy to   
 mastermind many projects.They have    
 planted trees at several schools in   
 the valley;which improved the         
 appearance of the schools;they        
 transformed an old rubbish tip on the 
 verge of the Glasgow Road into an     
 attractive picnic area,and erected    
 several bird tables in the Cessnock   
 Gardens and at Kirklandside  hospital.
 The Club also constructed a Nature    
 Trail which can be used by all schools
 and Youth Organisations.The Club then 
 cleared overhanging vegetation and    
 drained water from an old pond,       
 transforming it into a deep pond,ideal
 for the study of plant and animal     
 life.Water diviners were used to find 
 a spring which now runs into the pond.
