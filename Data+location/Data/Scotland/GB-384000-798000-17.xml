		<content> Maryculter Eagles are a junior        
 football team formed of children from 
 Maryculter East Primary School and the
 early years of Cults Academy Secondary
 School. They play league fixtures and 
 this year have won the Drum'Culter    
 Trophy.Perhaps the most unique feature
 is the 2-hour training session held by
 ex-international goalkeeper Bobby     
 Clark each week. Children of all ages 
 and both sexes turn out for this. Mums
 and Dads watch too. The children have 
 a series of exercises and warm-ups,   
 finishing with a short game. The      
 football strip is a yellow T-shirt    
 with a magnificent flying eagle on the
 back. There is also an eagle mascot   
 which is carried aloft to matches. It 
 was made by one of our Mums.
