		<content> Squares 1,2,3,6 &amp; 7 are taken up      
 purely by afforestation again         
 belonging to the forestry commission. 
 This is some of the poorest if not the
 p@oorest ground in the area under     
 trees being a large blanket bog.      
 However the trees are responding very 
 well to sound structural techniques   
 and are all at the post thicket stage 
 now.   .45 of sq. 5 .25 of sq. 6 all  
 of sq. 10 in the main inby ground for 
 Chivmorrie Farm, the buildings being  
 in 09.9.   Laggish farm takes up all  
 of blocks 8,11 &amp; 12.   However blocks 
 8.11 &amp; 12 have since been sold and are
 due for afforestation.   The ground is
 very exposed although very fertile &amp;  
 contains large areas of arable quality
 within the farm areas.  Luggish and   
 Chirmorrie are both very famous in the
 area for high class breeding of       
 Blackface Rams.                       </content>
