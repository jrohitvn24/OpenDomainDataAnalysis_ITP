		<title>18FUND RAISING</title>
		<content> Every year,in the summer term,we have 
 a Coffee Morning for the School Fund. 
 This year it was on Saturday June 1st.
 There was a plant stall,cake stall,   
 juice &amp; crisps stall,gift stall and an
 ice-cream stall.This year we raised   
 more money than ever.In one room there
 are the stalls and in the other tables
 are set where they have their coffee  
 or tea and cakes.The money raised goes
 to the school fund which helps to pay 
 for school trips,Christmas Party,visit
 to the pantomime,prizes and entrance  
 money for entries to the Annual Perth 
 Festival.Parents and some pupils bake 
 cakes,scones,pancakes and make sweets 
 for the stalls.One of the grandads    
 grows lots of plants from seed in his 
 greenhouse for the plant stall.Pupils 
 and parents knit or make gifts for the
 gift stall. Everyone in the school is 
 involved and we all have a lovely time</content>
