		<title>01Ingalee Skerry Strongay</title>
		<content> Ingale Skerry is a small outcrop of   
 rock 1 Kilometre south of Stronsay,   
 between Stronsay and Auskerry.  It is 
 about 200 mtrs in length and 50 mtrs  
 wide lying in a north-west-southeast  
 direction.  There is no vegetation on 
 ingale skerry apart from seaweed, as  
 it is completely covered by water     
 during high tide.                     
 The skerry is a frequent resting place
 for the seals, which live around      
 Orkney, during low tide.  Other       
 visitors include oystercatchers and   
 morants.  The tides around Ingale     
 Skerry are strong, consequently it is 
 difficult and dangerous to attempt a  
 landing by Boat.
