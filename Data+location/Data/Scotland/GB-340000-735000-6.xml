		<content> The cropping pattern table shows that 
 the main crop is{BARLEY.}Most of this 
 grain is sold for{MALTING}to make     
 whisky. Barley for malting needs a    
 moisture content no greater than 16%. 
 Larger farms, therefore, have{GRAIN   
{DRIERS}but some use the large new     
 drying shed at Inveraldie. Barley     
 which is not good enough for malting  
 is used as cattle feed. Some barley is
 winter sown. Turnips and grasses are  
 used as fodder and to make{SILAGE.}   
 Peas and beans are also used as fodder
 but some may be sold for processing.  
 The{FRUIT}shown in the table means    
 raspberries and strawberries sold for 
 jam in Dundee. School pupils earn     
 pocket money from 'berry picking'. In 
 a good year{POTATOES}fetch high prices
 and there is an important potato      
 grading station near Shielhill Farm.  
 Oil Seed Rape is sold for cooking oil.</content>
