		<content> Today few people live in the valley.  
 Fewer work in it.  Only one colliery  
 row still has families living in it.  
                                       
                                       
 We counted nine inhabited houses.  Two
 of these are quite recent and a third 
 has been extended. Of all these homes 
 three are on farms and all but one are
 within easy reach of the B741 which   
 threads the valley.                   
                                       
                                       
 The school was demolished after mining
 subsidence made it unsafe.  At the end
 it served only children with          
 pronounced learning difficulties.     
 Some of these children travelled long 
 distances daily by contract transport.
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
