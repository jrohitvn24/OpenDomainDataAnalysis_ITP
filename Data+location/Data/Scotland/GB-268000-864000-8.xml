		<content> The village of Jemimaville was        
 originally built about 1822 as estate 
 houses for the Poyntzfield estate  and
 called Jemimaville after Jemima       
 Poyntz, the laird's wife.             
   Then it was a thriving community    
 with its own doctor, dancing master,  
 various tradesmen and a hotel. It even
 had a hand loom weaving industry for a
 time. There was a village hall and two
 churches.                             
   Then the trade died away and the    
 estate dwindelled. Many of the old    
 buildings decayed. Now one church is  
 just a ruin on the shore. The other is
 now a garage and petrol station. Some 
 of the buildings were turned into     
 private houses, one of which , the old
 store and warehouse, belonged to Jane 
 Duncan, the Scottish authoress.
