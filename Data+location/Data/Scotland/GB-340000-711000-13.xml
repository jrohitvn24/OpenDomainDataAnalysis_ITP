		<content>  In Ceres School playground the pupils
 play  lots  of  games.  One of them is
 called "Buzz Off".  Players hide while
 someone counts up  to  sixty  and then
 goes to search. If the counter finds a
 player  then  he runs  to the  den and
 calls his  or  her  name  followed by,
 "One, two, three!"    That  person  is
 captured.  When it  is clear  a player
 can run to the  den  and  shout, "Buzz
 off!"  If half of the players  succeed
 in  calling  "Buzz off"  then the game
 begins  again  with  the same counter.
   The game ends  when  all the players
 are captured.  The first player caught
 counts in the next game.              
  Another  game  is  "High  Tig".   One
 person chases while the others run.  A
 player can be caught only if he or she
 is at  ground  level.  He  or  she  is
 "het" and chases in the next game.
