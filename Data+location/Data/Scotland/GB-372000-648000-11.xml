		<title>11WATER IN POLWARTH</title>
		<content> POLWARTH IS WELL WATERED.             
 FLOURISHWALLS BURN &amp; RUMBLINGSTONE    
 BURN BOTH RUN INTO THE SWARDEN (NOTED 
 FOR ITS TROUT &amp; THEIR GUDDLEABILITY), 
 WHICH RUNS INTO THE KIRK BURN THEN THE
 HOWE BURN, THE BLACKADDER, THE        
 WHITEADDER &amp; INTO THE TWEED. THERE    
 MANY WELLS, AS THE BLACK WELL AT      
 POLWARTH, &amp; SPRINGS, SOME BEING FOUND 
 WHEN BUILDING THE BIG BARN AT         
 WOODHEADS IN 1983. MUCH DRAINAGE &amp;    
 CHANNELLING WAS DONE IN THE 18 CENTURY
 WNEN THE WATER SYSTEM FOR MARCHMONT   
 WAS INSTALLED. THAT IS STILL SPRING   
 WATER &amp; NOT MAINS, SO THAT NO WATER   
 RATES ARE PAID ON IT OR ANY OF THE    
 ADJACENT HOUSES. THE WATER IS QUITE   
 HARD &amp; IS SAID TO BE GOOD FOR THE     
 DIGESTION &amp; THE TEETH OF GROWING      
 CHILDREN.
