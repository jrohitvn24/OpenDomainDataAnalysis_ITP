		<title>01ECOLOGY OF SANDHEAD</title>
		<content> Sandhead and its environs are situated
 on the southernmost tip of the        
 Scottish mainland. Our block is almost
 as far south as Durham City, and      
 totally south of the Anglo/Scottish   
 border. Lying 10 kilometres south of  
 Stranraer, the village is the centre  
 of activity for a community supporting
 an agricultural area. The area is very
 fortunate in that it has a good record
 of sunshine despite its westerly      
 situation. Couple this to the effects 
 of the Gulf Stream and its being      
 almost surrounded by sea and one finds
 winters of amiable mildness with snow 
 being an unusual event. The village is
 at the head of Luce Bay, which is the 
 last bay on the north side of the     
 Solway Firth and pollution is rare,   
 the beaches being clean and pleasant. 
 The area has escaped, {SO FAR,}any but
 the mildest exploitation.             </content>
