		<content> THE MOST NOTEWORTHY ACHIEVEMENT OF THE
 COUNCIL WAS THE ISSUE OF THE CLOSURE  
 OF THE SCHOOL. IT WAS SAFED FROM      
 CLOSURE MAINLY WE BELIEVE ,BY THE     
 EEFORTS OF THE COMMUNITY COUNCIL .HAD 
 THEY NOT BEEN THERE ,OPPOSITION TO THE
 CLOSURE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO EASILY 
 MOBILIZED, NOR NEARLY SO EFFECTIVE.THE
 SCHOOL NOW SEEMS TO BE THRIVING .     
 OTHER ISSUES INCLUDE ,THE PATHWAYS UP 
 TO DOWNFIELD, IMPROVED STREET         
 LIGHTING,RESURFACING OF THE ROAD TO   
 THE PLAYING PARK AT CRAIGMILLS AND    
 PROVISION OF CAR PARKING FACILITIES AT
 BRIDGEFOOT COTTAGES.                  
 THE COUNCIL ALSO ACTS AS A SOCIAL     
 FOCUS FOR THE COMMUNITY .THERE ARE    
 REGULAR SOCIAL EVENTS , AT LEAST      
 ANNUALLY RUN BY THE COUNCIL.
