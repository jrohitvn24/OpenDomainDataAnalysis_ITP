		<title>14WILDLIFE IN THE AREA</title>
		<content>   There is a varied selection of      
 wildlife in this area, of which the   
 bird life is more easy to spot and    
 identify.  The land slopes heavily and
 rises to about 1000 ft, the top 300 ft
 of which are mainly moorland and      
 heather.  The land is open and barren 
 with few trees and only ground cover. 
 This provides an ideal area for oyster
 catchers, curlews and lapwings        
 inhabit.  Grouse are normally present 
 in large numbers here but in recent   
 years Central Perthshire has seen a   
 sharp decline in their numbers        
 although they now seem to be returning
 slowly.  Amongst the animals seen     
 were hares,rabbits and deer.  Other   
 birds found further down the hill were
 crows, pigeons, cuckoos, various hawks
 and jackdaws.
