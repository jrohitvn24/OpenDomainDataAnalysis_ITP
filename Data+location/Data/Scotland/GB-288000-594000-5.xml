		<title>05Thornhill Station.</title>
		<content> One of the main points of Thornhill is
 the station which was built about 1790
 and closed down in 1962.While the men 
 were on duty they made gas for lamps  
 and kept a look out for passing       
 trains.About 10 trains stopped at the 
 station and 20 passed through in a    
 normal day.There hasn't been any      
 accidents at the station but a train  
 driver died whilst driving a train.   
 Their uniform is a navy blue suit with
 a matching long sleeved waistcoat. The
 Duke of Buccleuch opened the station. 
 In the snow, dark etc,they all wear   
 orange, reflective jackets. The men   
 have to get up very early, about      
 6.00am and work until 2.00pm. They    
 might get called out because there are
 sheep on the line. On a single line   
 the trains travel about 15mph on a    
 double line 30mph.
