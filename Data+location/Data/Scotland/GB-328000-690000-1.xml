		<content> Our area is the original part of      
 Kirkcaldy with at least seven twelfths
 of the area covered by sea.  The area 
 has the busiest shopping area         
 including the new Mercat shopping     
 centre.  It takes in six of the main  
 industries in our town.  Our area has 
 a lot of entertainments;  two         
 discotheques, a cinema, bingo and     
 amusement arcades.  Our area has two  
 harbours, Dysart and Kirkcaldy on the 
 coast of the Firth of Forth.  The     
 Links Market comes in April.  It is   
 the longest and oldest  street fair in
 Europe. The area takes in Ravenscraig 
 Castle and Park. Along at Dysart is   
 Pan Ha', a number of houses recently  
 renovated by the National Trust. On   
 the whole our area is a mixed one with
 shopping, industries, residential,    
 parkland, sea and wasteland all in    
 different parts of the area.          </content>
