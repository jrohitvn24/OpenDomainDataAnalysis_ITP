		<content> NEWLANDS SCHOOL IS VERY OLD. IN 1976  
 WE CELEBRATED OUR CENTENARY WITH AN   
 EXHIBITION AND ACTIVITIES. THERE HAVE 
 BEEN 7 HEADTEACHERS AND OVER 1000     
 CHILDREN ENROLLED DURING THE PAST 100 
 YEARS. AT NEWLANDS WE WILL SOON HAVE  
 OVER 50 CHILDREN AS WE AMALGAMATE WITH
 LAMANCHA AND KIRKURD SCHOOLS. WE WILL 
 NEED 3 PRIMARY TEACHERS. AT THE MOMENT
 WE HAVE 3 VISITING SPECIALIST         
 TEACHERS, 1 FOR ART, 1 FOR CRAFT AND 1
 FOR MUSIC. WE ALSO HAVE A TEACHER WHO 
 HELPS OUT FOR HALF A DAY PER WEEK AND 
 AN AXILIARY FOR 1 WHOLE DAY. THE      
 HEADTEACHER TEACHES THE OLDER CHILDREN
 AND DOES THE OFFICE WORK AS WELL.     
 CHILDREN BEGIN SCHOOL AT 5 YEARS OF   
 AGE AND LEAVE AT 11 TO GO TO HIGH     
 SCHOOL IN PEEBLES. ABOUT HALF OF OUR  
 CHILDREN WALK TO SCHOOL, THE OTHERS   
 COME BY CAR OR BUS.
