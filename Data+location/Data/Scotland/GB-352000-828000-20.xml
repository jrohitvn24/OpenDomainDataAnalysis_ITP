		<title>20Games Past And Present.</title>
		<content> Nowadays children seem to spend most  
 of their spare time watching          
 television, playing computer games,   
 listening to music or playing with any
 of the many fantastic toys which have 
 been provided by modern technology.   
 Playground games seem to be dying out.
 Some of the games which used to be    
 played in school playgrounds were: hop
 -scotch, beware of the bear, tacky,   
 high-tacky, shadow-tacky, all-over,   
 one-after-all, hide-and-seek, skipping
 with ropes and playing marbles. Most  
 of these games are chasing games. The 
 boys never played games with the girls
 because that would be soppy and the   
 girls wouldn't want to play with them 
 anyway because they're always dirty   
 and rough and they call girls names   
 and tease them. Nowadays we just walk 
 about at playtime or listen to a radio
 but we still dont play with the boys. </content>
