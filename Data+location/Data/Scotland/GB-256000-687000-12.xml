		<title>12Making films in FINTRY</title>
		<content> Partly due to the unspoilt scenery and
 absence of pylons and partly to its   
 proximity to Glasgow (BBCtv and STV), 
 the Fintry area has often been used   
 for location filming.                 
                                       
 This has varied from relatively small 
 advertising work to major productions 
 such as{"Eagle of the Ninth"}filmed on
 the moor behind Harvieston Farm.A Fort
 and Stadium were built, which could be
 seen from Aberfoyle, 15 miles away. A 
 chariot race was shot in the stadium  
 and the highlight of the filming was  
 the finale when all was destroyed by  
 fire. It was all greatly enjoyed.     
                                       
 Winter scenes in a Russian village    
 have been made here, and once a castle
 exterior shot was used in a thriller, 
 as a high grade establishment of      
 ill-repute.                           </content>
