		<title>09FAMILY LIFE IN WEST KILBRIDE</title>
		<content> Most families in West Kilbride are    
{small}and are quite{well off          
 financially. People live comfortable  
 lives. Most families live in{private  
{houses,}own at least one car, and have
 holidays abroad each year.            
 A{typical day}might be similar        
 to the following:-                    
          A family would usually get up
 about 7am, wash and dress and then the
 adults would go to work at about 8am, 
 whereas the children would leave at   
 8.30am to go to school.               
 Many mothers are housewives and, as   
 West Kilbride is a small village, they
 would shop for small amounts of       
 messages each day. Most children would
 go home for lunch at 12.30. The family
 would eventually all get together     
 again for their evening meal and then 
 spend the evening watching T.V. or    
 pursuing various hobbies.             </content>
