		<title>09EDAY AIRSTRIP</title>
		<content>    Eday airstrip which was built in   
 1970 is in the very centre of the     
 island. It is the only one in the     
 isles which is a links rather than    
 just a field. Many of the other       
 islands have cattle grazing on their  
 airstrip when it is not in use but not
 in Eday.                              
    At the airstrip there is a small   
 area of tarmac where the plane unloads
 its passengers and the people of Eday 
 have painted a court there on which   
 they play tennis in the summer time.  
    Loganair runs the ambulance        
 service. Since Eday is an island it   
 would take too long to take people by 
 boat to the hospital in an emergency. 
 The plane acts just like an ambulance 
 and flies to the island for anyone    
 needing hospital attention.           
    The plane is a small eight seater  
 which comes from Kirkwall twice a day.</content>
