		<title>09Roads in East Kilbride</title>
		<content>   The dual carriageways which take the
 through traffic are built for speed   
 and safety. By keeping pedestrians off
 these roads traffic can pass through  
 at 50 mph. Pedestrians are separated  
 from the roads by fences and can only 
 cross at bridges or underpasses.      
  Smaller gently curving roads like    
 West Mains Road take cars through the 
 neighbourhoods at 30 mph. To get to   
 housing areas cars have to turn into  
 much narrower and winding roads where 
 they must travel more slowly. Many    
 people actually live in cul-de-sacs so
 cars cannot pass through. In all cases
 roads are separated from pavements by 
 grass verges for maximum safety.      
  The area where this pattern breaks   
 down is the village area which is a   
 conservation area and thus the narrow 
 roads with shops on each side must    
 remain as they are. (see Photo B)     </content>
