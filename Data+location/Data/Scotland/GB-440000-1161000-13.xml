		<title>13Boats and Yachts in Voe.</title>
		<content> The Delta Dawn is a small fishing boat
 which is based at Voe.It is 7.5 metres
 in length and 2.5 metres wide. The    
 boat's registration number is LK 23.It
 is powered by a Perkins diesel engine 
 which can make the boat travel at     
 speeds of up to 8 knots.              
 The boat is quite well equipped.It has
 an echo sounder to help locate the    
 fish.It also has a CB and a VHF radio 
 aboard.                               
 This boat is used for pleasure        
 fishing.Lobster pots are set in the   
 voe and queens and scallops are also  
 fished for.                           
 In the summer season other boats can  
 be seen moored off in the voe.At the  
 moment there are two yachts,a speed   
 boat and a Shetland model.            
 These boats are overhauled each spring
 before they go in the water.
