		<content> This area has no centre of population 
 sufficiently concentrated to be self- 
 sufficient for cultural activities.   
 There has never been a village hall   
 and the elementary school, which could
 have been used for meetings was closed
 in 1953 and is now a dwelling house.  
 The primary school pupils go to either
 Ferryden or Inverkeilor schools whilst
 those of secondary school age attend  
 either Montrose or Arbroath Academies.
 It is also to these areas that the    
 population turn to for social         
 activities, for example, clubs for    
 senior citizens, women, men, and the  
 young people can be found at          
 Inverkeilor, whilst bridge clubs,     
 bingo, theatre and the cinema can be  
 found at the larger towns. The hotel  
 does not serve the area as a local    
 public house.
