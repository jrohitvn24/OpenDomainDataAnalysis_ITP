		<content> A recent development in Renfrew has   
 beeen the opening up of a number of   
 large supermarkets which has had an   
 adverse effect on the small traders in
 the area. A number of small corner    
 shops have closed as a result. The    
 supermarkets have ,however, created   
 employment particularly for young     
 people. Presto is a large store in the
 centre of town occupying an excellent 
 site at the Cross. Tesco, a much      
 larger store, was built on the site of
 the old Renfrew Airport and very close
 to the M8 motorway which increases its
 catchment area. The other development 
 has been the growth of 'take away'    
 food shops, especially Italian and    
 Indian, but the traditional 'Chippie' 
 (Fish and Chip shop) retains its      
 popularity. There are no department   
 stores because of low population. The 
 nearest large shopping area is Paisley</content>
