		<title>06A Secretary's Day</title>
		<content> Alison Jardine starts at a quarter to 
 nine and finishes at a quarter to     
 five.                                 
    As a secretary, she takes a lot of 
 telephone calls during the day. She   
 also orders things for the school in  
 February and September. The school    
 gets an allocation of money from the  
 Regional Council.                     
    To start off with in the morning   
 the secretary opens all the school    
 mail. Some of that mail is for the    
 Rector or for other teachers. This    
 goes into the pigeon holes in the     
 staffroom.                            
    She also does the registration     
 procedures. The names of the pupils   
 who are absent are filled in. She does
 a lot of typing including audio       
 typing. There is quite a lot of typing
 to do for both teachers and the       
 Rector.                               </content>
