At the break of day,about 7 o'clock,I  
get up,have my breakfast,get my clothes
on and get ready to go and help my Dad.
At the farm Dad would sharpen the combs
and cutters for the shearing machine.We
would then get in the landrover and go 
up to Harecleugh to get the clipping   
machines.I would help to load up the   
landrover.When we get back we would set
up the machines.Douglas would have the 
sheep in.Dad goes out and starts the   
generator.My job is to roll the fleeces
and pack them in the wool bag.Sometimes
I go in the wool bags and jump in the  
corner to pack in the wool.At the end  
of the day I go home covered in wool   
and mucky with the grease out of the   
fleece.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
