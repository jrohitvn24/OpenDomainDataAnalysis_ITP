		<title>12Dumfries Rowing Club</title>
		<content> In Dumfries there are many sports     
 clubs and one of them is the Rowing   
 Club. It has many regattas and        
 sponsored rows each year. Recently the
 club raised Â£1000 in a sixteen mile   
 sponsored row. Soon the club is going 
 to have a regatta on the River Nith in
 Dumfries (22nd June 1985). Quite a few
 are expected to come from all over the
 south of Scotland and the north of    
 England.                              
    Many schools have boats at the club
 for their pupils. There are about     
 twenty boats in all: three eight-crew 
 boats, seven four-crew boats, two pair
 boats, seven one-man boats and a new  
 learner boat for one person that helps
 beginners get used to rowing. Not all 
 of the boats are Nithsdale's - some   
 are borrowed and others are kept there
 but have certain owners.
