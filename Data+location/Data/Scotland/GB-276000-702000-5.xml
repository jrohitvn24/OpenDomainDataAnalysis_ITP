  Whitecross is in the outskirts of    
Dunblane and originally consisted of   
a big house and a few cottages.        
Dunblane expanded and a number of      
private houses were built along the    
A9. Later a council house estate was   
built extending it to its present      
size. On the west side is the new      
cemetry where a number of boys and     
staff from the school are buried. There
is also a sand quarry.                 
  It is here that about the last piece 
of single lane carriageway on the A9   
exists and as a result there is a      
bottle neck which causes congestion.   
Traffic also tend to travel too fast   
down the dual carriageway and as a     
result several fatal accidents have    
occurred here.
