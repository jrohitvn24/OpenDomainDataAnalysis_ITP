 There is a large Playing Field        
 adjacent to the school. Nearest the   
 school there are two sets of two      
 swings, one merry-go-round and a newly
 -erected 15 feet high "Geo-drome"     
 climbing frame. These are very popular
 with all ages of children.            
                                       
 Further down the field there is a full
 size football pitch with permanent    
 goal posts. There are two sets of     
 smaller moveable goal posts too.      
                                       
 Along the west edge of the field runs 
 a burn which offers an endless source 
 of interest and recreation.           
                                       
 All children in the area spend most of
 their free time in the Playing Field, 
 which is just as well as there is     
 nowhere else to go.                   </content>
