 passed on our walk along the{Murieston
{Trail.}The owner supplied us with     
 imformation.                          
 Skivo Farm has been there since{1588  
 or maybe earlier.{Mid Calder Parish   
{Church}has a record about a man called
 John Anderson at the above date. The  
 present owners have been there for 7  
 years and bought the farm from Miss   
 and Mr Morley. Five or six people work
 on the Farm, four of which are family.
 They keep horses,dogs,cats,rabbit and 
 1 duck on 36 acres of land.Most of the
 horses were bought at private sales   
 expept one which was bought from a    
 horse dealer. Each horse costs around 
 Â£400.It costs about Â£250 to run the   
 farm per week.Workers are paid Â£50
