		<content>      The West Linton Health Centre was
 built in 1982. The government provided
 the money. It is a very attractive    
 building and has rooms for the doctors
 nurses,physiotherapist,chiropodist,   
 baby clinic and the dentist.          
   We have three doctors, two fully    
 trained and one under training and two
 nurses who are here all the time.     
  Local charities like the Kenny Paul  
 Trust and the Whipman Play have       
 donated money so that the doctors     
 could buy a radio link system. This is
 useful as the doctors have a wide area
 to cover. Extra equipment that one    
 would only find in a hospital has also
 been donated eg. nebulisers for       
 asthmatics and chest patients.        
   When patients need hospital         
 treatment  they are sent to hospitals 
 in Edinburgh which is nearer than our 
 own area hospital in Galashiels.      </content>
