		<title>15RASHFIELD SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>   Rashfield school is a primary school
 for children age 5 to 11.The children 
 are usually divided into primarys 1-3 
 and primarys 4-7 but this can change  
 according to the numbers in the school
 each year.                            
   School begins at 9.30am to allow the
 school car to make several journeys to
 collect children from the various     
 areas.                                
   The school has no sports facilities 
 or gymnasium and classrooms had to be 
 cleared for P.E. Now the children     
 are taken to a gymnasium in Sandbank  
 each week. They also visit the        
 swimming pool each week for one term. 
   A visiting music instructor comes   
 weekly to instruct some pupils to play
 wind instruments. The school also has 
 recorder groups.
