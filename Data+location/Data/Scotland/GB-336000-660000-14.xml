 woman who was believed to be a witch  
 nicknamed Camp Meg who appeared on the
 hill above Mayfield.She had previously
 lived in Dumfries in Galloway before  
 she moved to the Camp Hill.Her real   
 name was Margaret Hawthorn.She was a  
 very wealthy woman who was married to 
 an important rich man who died leaving
 Margaret with a young son.One day a   
 man tried to take her money and the   
 land that her husband had left her.She
 shot the man, left her son and fled to
 Lothian and found Warston House a

 Her cottage was very basic: tree      
 stumps and stones for tables and      
 chairs. She was believed to have slept
 on a  bed of fir trees (continued)    </content>
