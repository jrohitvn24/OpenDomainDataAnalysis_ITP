		<title>01Area around River Ayr Gorge</title>
		<content> This is a mainly farming area         
 specialising largely in milk          
 production but also producing barley  
 &amp; a few sheep. The area around        
 Coilsholm includes the River Ayr Gorge
 which is designated by the nature     
 Conservancy Council &amp; the Scottish    
 Wildlife Trust as a "site of special  
 scientific interest". This should     
 ensure the conservation of the richest
 area of wildlife in Ayrshire which    
 exists as a river gorge with many     
 levels providing habitats for many    
 species of plants &amp; animals. A large  
 part of this area is owned by one     
 landowner, the owner of Barskimming   
 House, which lies to the east of this 
 block &amp; as a result much of the land  
 has remained as deciduous woodland or 
 as small conifer plantations.
