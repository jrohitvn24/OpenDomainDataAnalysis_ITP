{ SPINNING:}The wool is first{carded   
 (combed) between flat boards with a   
 mat of sharp teeth called{cards.}It's 
 then made into a{rolag}(approx. 9"    
 roll) and is ready for spinning. As   
 the{bobbin}revolves on the pedal-     
 powered wheel the wool is twisted into
 a yarn.  The yarn is wound onto a     
{niddy-noddy}and forms a{skein}(hank)  
 which is washed before being made into
 a ball and knitted.                   
{ STRAW-WORK:}Articles are made from   
 golden straw which has been hand or   
 binder cut. The outer skin is removed 
 and the straw passed through a ring to
 keep an even tension. Rounds of straw 
 are sewn in place, each being secured 
 to the previous row using a sailmakers
 needle and cotton twine.              
{ Hand-knitting, embroidery, wood-work,
{macrame, sewing}and{crochet}are done. </content>
