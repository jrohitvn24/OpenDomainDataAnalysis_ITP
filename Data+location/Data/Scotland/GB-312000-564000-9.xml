 CUMMERTREES                           
                                       
           Cummertrees got its name    
 because it was where people from      
 Cumbria met with the local people.    
 Cummertrees Village was built to house
 the workers from the Hoddam and       
 Kinmount Estate . At one time, the    
 whinstone houses were built in a      
 square,which came to be called        
 Parliment Square because people met to
 talk about politics there. These      
 houses were pulled down,and nowadays  
 only a wall remains.                  
      Cummertrees used to have its own 
 railway station and petrol pumps,but  
 these are no longer there.
