		<title>13DAISY PARK GALA DAY</title>
		<content> The Gala is organised by Mrs A.       
 Thomson with the help of the Tuesday  
 Club.  It is usually held in          
 Motherwell Stadium on a Saturday in   
 August.  In the Gala there are Sports,
 Majorette Displays, pony rides, home  
 baking, soft goods and grocery sales. 
 In the past any profit has gone to the
 Deaf Unit at Glencairn School.  There 
 is usually a float and fancy dress    
 competition for two age groups.  A    
 Queen, a Handmaid and a Page-boy are  
 chosen by lottery.  There has been a  
 Gala every year for the last six years
 but not this year, because the        
 organisers decided to have a year off 
 to see if they could involve any more 
 of the young mothers, who ought then  
 to be able to take over the running of
 the Gala.
