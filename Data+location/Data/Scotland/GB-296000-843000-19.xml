		<title>19RIVER FINDHORN AT FERNESS</title>
		<content>    The river flows through the north- 
 west corner of our area,on its 60 mile
 course from the Monadhliath mountains 
 to the Moray Firth near Forres. In    
 these middle reaches it has cut some  
 spectacularly beautiful gorges in the 
 granite rock. The Findhorn is subject 
 to sudden and dramatic flooding, the  
 worst on record having occurred in    
 August 1829. That year the road bridge
 near Ferness was completely submerged 
 in the spate but survived unscathed.  
 Another footbridge across the river   
 from Ferness to Ardclach Church was   
 washed away in 1958.                  
    The Findhorn is famous for its     
 salmon fishing which is owned by      
 Glenferness Estate. The wooded banks  
 of the river are much enjoyed by the  
 walker, while the rapids provide good 
 sport for the canoeist.
