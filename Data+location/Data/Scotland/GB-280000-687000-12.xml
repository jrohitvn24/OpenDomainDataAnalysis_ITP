		<title>12SOCIAL CONCERNS  PLEAN/COWIE</title>
		<content>   The people in this area are         
 represented by a socialist member of  
 parliament and socialist councillors. 
 There are also two community councils 
 in this area. The villages of Plean   
 and Cowie have been designated as     
 socially deprived areas and therefore 
 qualify for Urban Aid funds.          
 Committees have been set up to try to 
 think of projects to improve the      
 quality of life in the two villages.  
 Unemployment in the villages is high. 
   The villagers of Plean have been    
 trying for years to get a community   
 hall. Apart from the Miners' Welfare  
 Hall which is now licensed premises   
 there is nowhere for groups in the    
 village to meet. The playgroup has    
 been looking for accommodation for    
 some time. The Community Council have 
 difficulty in finding a meeting place.
