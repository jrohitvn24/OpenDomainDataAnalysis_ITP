		<title>14      Bawbee Bridge</title>
		<content> The River Leven is crossed by the     
 Bawbee Bridge.So called because until 
 1870 the fee for crossing the bridge  
 was one Bawbee (Bawbee_Scots word for 
 ha'penny,L.S.D.).                     
   The original was a suspension bridge
 built in 1821 it was replaced by      
 another bridge in 1839.About 120 years
 later in the 1950's traffic was       
 growing,the bridge was narrow and only
 one car could pass at a time,also the 
 bridge required a lot of repairs so it
 was decided to build another bridge.  
   Work was started in 1955 and this   
 bridge was finished in 1957 at a cost 
 of Â£200,000.It was declared opened by 
 the Secretary of State for Scotland at
 the time Mr John.S.Mackay and is still
 being used as the main communication  
 link from Leven to Methil.
