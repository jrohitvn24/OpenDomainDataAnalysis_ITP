		<content> There are 4 types of housing in the   
 given area.1-Privately owned 2-Rented 
 council homes 3-Tied houses 4-Croft   
 houses.There are nine private         
 houses-(2 bungalows 7 traditional     
 stone).The 8 council houses were built
 35 years ago when electricity came to 
 the village.The tied houses accomodate
 the farm workers although both teacher
 and Doctor have tied homes too.In     
 Balgowan (east of block) there are 6  
 crofts only 4 of which work their     
 land. The rest are worked by nearby   
 Cluny estate (Landlord to the         
 crofters).Most homes in Laggan are    
 granite buildings with wooden window  
 frames,solid fuel stoves and modern   
 sanitation.
