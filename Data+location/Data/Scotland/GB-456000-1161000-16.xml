		<title>16THE HANSEATIC BOD,SYMBISTER</title>
		<content>  Between the 13th &amp; 17th centuries    
 merchants from the Hanseatic ports of 
 Europe traded with Shetland.          
  They sailed here in spring with      
 fishing gear,food,drink and household 
 goods which they traded for fish and  
 other produce. They arrived in late   
 spring and stayed until late summer.  
  The Bod or "booth" was a trading     
 warehouse belonging to merchants from 
 Bremen.It was built sometime in the   
 16th  century at the same time as the 
 old harbour.The trade declined and    
 ended when the Scottish parliament    
 intervened to stop it in the late 17th
 century.                              
  Recently the booth has been used as a
 store but by the 1970's it was in     
 disrepair.It has now been restored by 
 a trust who plan to have it open this 
 year(1985) as an exhibition and       
 visitors centre.                      </content>
