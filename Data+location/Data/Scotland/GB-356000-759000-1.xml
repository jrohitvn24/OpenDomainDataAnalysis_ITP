		<title>01REVIEW OF BRECHIN BLOCK</title>
		<content>   The block lies in the centre of the 
{Strathmore Valley}in eastern{Angus.   
 The relief is gently undulating       
 lowland. The topography,soils and     
 climate are ideal for{arable farming  
 and this covers the western 3/4 of the
 block. The rural landscape is divided 
 into a dozen farms. Brechin Castle,in 
 its wooded grounds,lies in the south  
 east corner.The other 1.5 sq.klm.     
 contains the centre of the historic   
 burgh of{Brechin}and the northern and 
 western suburbs of the town. The town 
 centre with its market place,         
 cathedral,sandstone buildings and     
 narrow streets has retained much of   
 its old character. The suburbs are    
 mainly residential but contain a large
 High Shool opened in 1970. The A94    
 trunk road,with a bypass,bisects the  
 block. Below the fields gas and oil   
 pipelines flow from the North sea.    </content>
