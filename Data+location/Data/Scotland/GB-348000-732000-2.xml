		<title>02HOUSING DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content>   During the past years there has been
 a steady increase in house building   
 for private ownership.Types of houses 
 are cottage,villa or bungalow style.  
 Few tenements exist.Furnished rooms   
 are scarce,houses are often let.      
   Grangehill,Adderley,Fothringham and 
 Broomhill are large housing estates on
 the hilly slopes north of the High St.
 In the field above Grange School a new
 building site,30 houses to begin with,
 is being developed this year 1985.    
   Hamish lives in a bungalow built in 
 1973.It has been extended making it T-
 shaped and the garden smaller.His poem
 written in class expresses his feeling
                                       
   Clang!Clash!Thud!Thud!Clang!Clash!  
   The digger dashes against the rock  
  working all day long clashing on and 
  on and on.To lay foundations in the  
  earth continual clashing on and on.  </content>
