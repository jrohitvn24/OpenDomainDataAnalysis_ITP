		<title>11ARTS AND CRAFTS.</title>
		<content> Someone had the bright idea of        
 inviting talented craftsmen and women 
 to demonstrate their skills at the    
 park centre for four consecutive      
 Sundays at a time. This has proved to 
 be very popular.                      
 The crafts demonstrated are           
 water-colour painting by a local      
 artist, John Forgan. Paul Boyle, Val  
 Corry and John Malone show how to make
 pottery. Wood carving is the work of  
 John Donaldson. One artist, Dave      
 Hickman, uses things found in the     
 woods to produce relief printing.The  
 local deer are used as models for     
 acrylic painting by William Ramsay.   
 Two other skills, decorated furniture 
 and corn dolls, are taught by David   
 Rickard and Frank Cooper.             
 Pyrography,or poker-work, is          
 beautifully done by Helen Bisset.
