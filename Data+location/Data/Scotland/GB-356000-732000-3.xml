		<title>03Fishing from Westhaven</title>
		<content>   Westhaven is a small fishing        
 community east of Carnoustie.A few of 
 the men from the area go out daily to 
 check their creels for crabs and      
 lobsters.These are the main catch for 
 the fishermen.Each week the fish-     
 merchant comes from Arbroath to buy   
 the lobsters and crabs.               
   There are seven small boat sheds at 
 Westhaven but often you can see the   
 creels,boats and nets lying on the    
 shore above the high tide line.This   
 lets the men mend and bait the creels 
 more easily.Fish-heads are used to    
 bait them.The creels are weighted so  
 that they sink to the bottom but they 
 must also have a buoy to mark where   
 the creels are and allow the men to   
 retrieve them.                        
   This fishing is done only as a      
 paying hobby.Cod here is caught by the
 men of the Arbroath fishing industry. </content>
