		<title>09Religion in Denny &amp; Dunipace</title>
		<content> Our area is served by 6 churches - The
{Church of Scotland,}which was once the
 dominant religion of Scotland, has 4  
 buildings,{the Roman Catholics}have 1 
 and{the Baptists}have 1. St Alexanders
 with its membership of 3570 Catholics 
 has recently had to be extended to    
 cope with the large congregation. Much
 of the work was done by the parish    
 priest and his parishioners. Although 
 different in their approach to        
 religion members of these churches    
 frequently come together for joint    
 services of worship. Over the last    
 decade the{ecumenical movement}has    
 been quite strong here. In June 1985  
 we had a walk from Dunipace to Denny  
 ending with an open air service of    
 praise and hymn singing.Members of the
 clergy and parishioners of all six    
 churches took part.
