		<content> The area is a wild, open expanse of   
 rolling upland. Dominating the skyline
 of this region is the cheviot (815m)  
 which is  clearly visible from afar as
 a flat pleateau standing above its    
 neighbours. The broad flat top of the 
 cheviot is nearly always waterlogged, 
 even in summer. Most of the           
 surrounding hills have similar poor   
 drainage, and the whole area is       
 covered with peat hags. This is a     
 wild, inhospitable place, where only  
 the hardiest survive. Grouse, sheep   
 and the occasional fox are the natural
 occupants of this region. The only    
 people likely to be seen apart from a 
 farmer herding a few sheep are fell   
 walkers covering the last few miles of
 the Pennine Way.For those seeking
