    Most of the farming in the area is 
 a mixture of arable and stock breeding
 for meat production. There is also a  
 small amount of fruit farming.        
    The increased use of machinery and 
 contractors to do such jobs as        
 ploughing and crop spraying has meant 
 a decrease in the number of farm      
 workers. Chemical fertilisers are     
 commonly used nowadays.

 the smaller family farms.

 employed to help with potato          
 lifting, and the schools close in
