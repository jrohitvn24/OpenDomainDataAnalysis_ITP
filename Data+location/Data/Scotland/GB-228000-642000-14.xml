 Francis Love stayed in Kiwinning many 
 years ago. He decided to emigrate to  
 America to earn money. He emigrated to
 the New World under the assigned      
 passage scheme between the wars. He   
 left penniless and made his money by  
 becoming a glazing contractor. He     
 donated $ 100 to build a hut or hall  
 to be named{"The Love Memorial Hall". 
 This was to be in remembrance of his  
 brother William who was killed during 
 the war. He agreed that  to every     
 additional pound gained by the        
 Corsehill people he would add another 
 pound to the collection.              
 The Hall now provides recreation for  
 Corsehill people. Recently they have  
 built a new bowling green. Most people
 like it.
