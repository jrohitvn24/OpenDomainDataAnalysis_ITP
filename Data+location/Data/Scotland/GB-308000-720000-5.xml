		<title>05Craigie Clips- Part 1.</title>
		<content>  We visited{Mr.Darling}whose family   
 had a{grocer's shop}here from 1913. He
 told us that in the nineteenth century
{Western District (Craigie)}was a rail-
 way village. Small houses for large   
 families were built near the engine   
 sheds and lines, for{railway workers. 
  There used to be two  bakeries,      
 chemists, dairies, cobblers and many  
 other shops. On{market days}cattle    
 came in on trains and little, local   
 boys with big sticks, liked to 'help' 
 the{drovers}take them along{cobbled   
 streets to the market behind our      
 school.Gardens thrived!               
  From a{horse and cart,}children took 
 milk in{churns}to people's doors and  
 poured the amount needed into jugs.   
  Parents thought highly of{discipline,
 and although strictly brought up the  
 children were happy and respected     
 adults and the{law.                   </content>
