		<content>{Sangomore Church                      
 Built in 1891 it joined with the      
 Durine church in 1929 to become the   
 parish church.There is a weekly       
 service plus a monthly evening        
 service.On Wednesdays there is a Bible
 study and on Sundays a Sunday school  
 class.Nothing has changed much in the 
 church except for the electric lights 
 and heaters.There was no organ before 
 1940.Singing before then was          
 unaccompanied.The bell no longer hangs
 in the belfry because,apparently,on   
 V.E day the R.A.F men from the radar  
 station pulled the bell so hard that  
 it fell down.                         
{Durine Church} Built in 1843 to       
 replace the ancient Balnakiel church, 
 this building is now a joiners        
 workshop. It was originally the       
 Established Church of Scotland and    
 was closed in 1945.                   </content>
