		<content>   In our area there are several clubs 
 for children.                         
   The{Y.M.C.A.}and the{Boys' Club}    
 are two clubs which are for boys and  
 girls. These clubs are situated in the
 middle of two housing areas.          
   Both clubs have games, which include
 judo, tennis, pool and football.      
   Members can also go on trips, at    
 home and abroad. There are also       
 exchange visits with foreign Y.M.C.A. 
 clubs.                                
   Both clubs have leaders, who try to 
 look after you, although some shout at
 you and tell you off.                 
   It can be good to go to these clubs,
 to enjoy these activities, and to get 
 out of the house for a little while.
