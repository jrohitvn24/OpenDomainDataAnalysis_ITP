		<content>  Farr school is the only school in our
 area.Between ten and twenty pupils    
 attend our school at the moment but   
 there has been as many as seventy     
 since it was built in 1877.Subjects   
 studied are Maths,English,Geography,  
 Nature,History,Art,Gym,Music,Science, 
 R.E and craft.                        
  The people from our school live in   
 our area and three kilometres north   
 and two kilometres south of our       
 area.All those except the people next 
 door get transport to school in the   
 winter but in the summer they have to 
 cycle or walk.                        
  School is in at 9:30, there is a     
 playtime at 11:00.We start our lunch  
 break at 12:45 and return at 2:00.    
 School is out at 4:00.In the winter   
 school is out at 3:30 and we have a   
 shorter lunch break to allow children 
 to get home before it is dark.        </content>
