		<title>16Gourdon Dialect</title>
		<content> The origin of the name of Gourdon     
 possibly derives from the Gaelic.     
 Probably goats grazed on the Gourdon  
 slopes long ago and the name means    
 "Goat-hill". In the early 14th century
 the name{"Gurden"}appears as a farm   
 and fisher town. There are in fact at 
 least 8 different ways of spelling the
 name in old documents, maps,          
 newspapers and tombstones. The form of
 spelling was to become standardised   
 about 200 years ago to its present    
 form, with non residents pronouncing  
 the village name as Gourdon whilst    
 villagers to this day continue to use 
 the ancient form of Gurden. The       
 villagers are still very apt in their 
 choice of nick names for local        
 residents especially amongst the      
 fishing fraternity.
