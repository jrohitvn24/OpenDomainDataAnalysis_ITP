		<content>   I live in a detatched, renovated    
 croft house which was completed in    
 1985.The steading has been converted  
 to a double garage and our drive has  
 been evenly tarmacademed.We have oil  
 fired central heating,while our       
 neighbours use calor gas,there being  
 no natural gas.My mum often uses the  
 microwave to cook our meals,which she 
 takes from the freezer.The winter goes
 on for almost six months so my dad    
 bought my mum an automatic washing    
 machine and tumble dryer,because he   
 works on the rigs now.We have a log   
 burner too because we get lots of     
 strong wind and snow which makes the  
 electricity go off.Last winter we had 
 no power for 13 days!I don't like it  
 then because I can't play on the      
 computer or watch Ghostbusters on the 
 video or go to the Disco in the       
 Village Hall.                         </content>
