 Canna has a variety of wildlife       
 including golden and sea eagles       
 although these do not breed here.     
 There are a great number of rabbits   
 and these are a pest to the farm.     
 Birds of prey ,such as the eagles and 
 buzzards keep the population down but 
 they still become a nuisance. Domestic
 cats and goats that have become feral 
  roam around the island. The cats live
 on brown rats and rabbits.

 157 species recorded 71 breed here.

 kittiwakes manx shearwaters, plovers  
  and shags.Canna is one of the last   
 breeding places of the corncrake.The
