		<title>03B.M.X.TRACK AT CRIEFF</title>
		<content> Last night June 18th 1985  the Crieff 
  B.M.X. Track was opened.The track was
 built by Perth and Kinross District   
 council and designed by Clare Brodie's
 dad.The track consists of bumps and   
 jumps called{whoops}and{tabletops.    
  We have found out that 5% of Crieff  
 Primary have B.M.X. bikes.            
  The track was built to keep the      
 children from doing stunts in         
 dangerous places .The track was built 
 in the disused coalyard .             
  In about two years the council is    
 going to build a freestyle arena,with 
 ramps and quarter-pipes so that the   
 children can do more daring stunts.
