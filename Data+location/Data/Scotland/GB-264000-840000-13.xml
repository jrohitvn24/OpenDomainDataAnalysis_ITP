 Secondary school which moved to new   
 buildings at Culduthel, on the        
 outskirts of Inverness,in August,     
 1979.However, despite the newness of  
 the buildings, it is a school with an 
 ancient history, and can trace its    
 background to 1223 with the founding  
 of a{DOMINICAN PRIORY}in the Friars   
 St. area. Advancement in Education has
 made 3 different moves necessary to   
 give the school the room to expand.   
                                       
    The school building is very modern 
 with language labs, microcomputer     
 labs, a lovely lecture theatre and    
 lots more. It has a well_equipped     
 gymnasium, blaize pitches and grass   
 playing fields. Some of the classes   
 are held in 9 huts which are hoped to 
 be omly temporary.
