		<title>19The Gardens of Bargany</title>
		<content>   The woodland gardens of Bargany     
 contain a large variety of rare and   
 common species of coniferous and      
 deciduous trees.                      
   The property originally belonged to 
 the{Kennedy's}as long ago as 1530,    
 passing into the hands of the present 
 family, the{Hamilton's},in 1630.      
   Landscaping the parkland began in   
 the 18th century when landowners      
 became enthusiastic about obtaining   
 new and rare trees from abroad, and   
 some of these trees can be seen today,
 such as the{Giant Redwood and Noble   
{Fir.}                                 
   A large, formal walled garden was   
 laid out in 1833 but only small       
 gardens are now tended, the centre    
 being laid out in grass. Nearby is    
 another garden mostly of special      
 trees,{walnuts, cherries,etc.}with    
 some interesting memorial plaques.    </content>
