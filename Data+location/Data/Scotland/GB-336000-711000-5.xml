		<content> The abattoir was built in{1968}and at 
 first was a family business.It was    
 built for{slaughtering horses.}It has 
 now been taken over by a larger firm  
 in{Motherwell.}From employing 45      
 people it only employs 13.            
 The animals,mostly accident cases,    
 come from farms in{Perthshire,        
{Kinrosshire and Lothian.}The animals  
 they deal with are all kinds of farm  
 animals except horses.There are strict
 health and hygiene rules.Before the   
 meat goes to butchers the meat        
 inspector comes round and passes the  
 meat for human consumption or for pet 
 meat.The hides go to hide brokers.    
 A special machine separates the       
 liquids from the blood and the        
 remaining solids are dried into high  
 protein blood meal for cattle feeding.
