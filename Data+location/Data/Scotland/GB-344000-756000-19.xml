 These tree-dwelling rodents are very  
 common in the woods around Tannadice. 
 Their colouring and fast movements    
 make them difficult to seein the      
 trees.                                
 Hedgehog                              
 A very common inhabitant of the woods 
 and hedgerows. Eats slugs, snails and 
 insects and is generally a friend to  
 the farmer.                           
 Weasel                                
 Probably the most efficient predator  
 hereabouts. Will kill and devour      
 animals many times its own weight.    
 Makes its home in natural rock        
 crevices or drystane dykes.           
 Roe Deer                              
 These attractive but shy animals      
 abound in the area. They inhabit the  
 woodlands and will eat almost any type
 of vegetation.                        </content>
