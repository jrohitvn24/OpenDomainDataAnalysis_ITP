		<title>08     LOCAL FARMING</title>
		<content>   Most of our 12 km/sq block is,in one
 way or another as farmland.As the land
 slopes up from the Kelvin Valley to   
 the tops of the Kilsyth Hills,so the  
 land is used for different types of   
 farming.                              
   The lower slopes are more fertile,  
 and are used mainly as rich pasture   
 for dairy cows and sheep.Some of this 
 land is also used to grow cereal crops
 (eg corn,barley) and vegetables(eg    
 potatoes,turnips).Fodder crops are    
 also grown.                           
   The upper slopes is mostly marshland
 and is used for herding the sheep and 
 returning the sheep back to the pens. 
    There are five farms in our block  
 and they all have animals and crops   
 because most of the farms are quite   
 large.
