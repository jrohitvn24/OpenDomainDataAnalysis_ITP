		<content>   In our area are to be found the very
 oldest houses which pre-date the New  
 Town. These village houses are mainly 
 of stone with slate roofs. Between the
 wars houses made of brick covered in  
 roughcast were built but still with a 
 slate roof. These are mostly four in a
 block houses with back and front gar- 
 dens. These were built around the vil-
 lage and because of their age have re-
 cently been renovated inside and out. 
   New Town building consists mainly of
 terraced and to a lesser extent semi- 
 detached houses with a variety of     
 building materials. There is only one 
 block of multi-storey flats in our    
 area. Private houses are built mainly 
 on the outskirts, usually in estates, 
 (a mixture of semi-detached and de-   
 tached), the latest of which is to be 
 2000 houses at Stewartfield which was 
 Green Belt Area until very recently.  </content>
