		<content> Recreational activity in the rural    
 community is almost totally dependant 
 on voluntary organisations.Small      
 committees emerge to form meetings,   
 competitions and social outings       
 amongst their own members or between  
 similar groups in outlying areas. All 
 age groups are well catered for.      
    There is a mums/toddler group for  
 pre-school children. Older children   
 are geared towards brownies, beavers  
 and cubs, as well as a roller-skating 
 club and a youth club.                
    Adults might choose the Womens     
 Institute, over 60's, carpet bowls,   
 bridge, billiards, embroidery group   
 and a Scottish country dancing group. 
 These all meet regularly throughout   
 the year in either the village hall or
 one of the two church halls nearby.   
    Additional organisations meet in   
 one of the two public houses.         </content>
