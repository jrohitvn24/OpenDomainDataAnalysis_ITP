 From April to September they play     
 outdoor bowls as members of the Junior
 Bowling Club.Also in the Community    
 Centre,which used to be Crosshill     
 Primary School,are facilities for     
 playing table tennis, pool,board games
 and records.Discos are held on special
 occasions but these are not always    
 well attended.Watching television or  
 video tapes of horror films,at home,  
 seems a more attractive proposition.  
 Teenagers can also be seen sitting in 
 groups at the War Memorial.Others ride
 round the village on motor bikes.     
 In Kirkmichael parents run a youth    
 club on a Friday night which involves 
 table tennis,snooker,badminton,darts, 
 record playing,card playing,reading   
 and watching films.In the evenings in 
 Spring and Summer teenagers hang about
 the pubs in groups.                   </content>
