  " I think it's a very beautiful area 
 but too quiet for me"                 
                                       
  "I would prefer to live in our town  
 than in our patch.It's too lonely     
 there.Imagine living in a deserted    
 place with not another house for      
 miles."                               
                                       
  "I think I'd rather live in our Patch
 because there would be peace and quiet
 and hardly any traffic"               
                                       
  "I like our Patch a lot. There are   
 beautiful views and an old castle.    
 There is a mobile library which brings
 books for the lonely houses"          
                                       
  "I would rather live here closer to  
 the shops and my friends "            </content>
