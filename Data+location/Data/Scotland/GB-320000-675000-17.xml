		<content> The most notable event in our area has
 been the changes made in our housing. 
 For many years the local houses were  
 all rented and for various reasons    
 they were allowed to fall into        
 disrepair. The{West Pilton}area got a 
 bad reputation for dampness,          
 vandalism, break-ins and untidiness.  
 The local council has sold off a lot  
 of houses (see "Housing in West       
 Pilton") to private developers. Many  
 of our school friends have had to move
 away from the area. Many of our houses
 are now being renovated  and the      
 scheme is looking much nicer. In{West 
{Granton}the ramps are being removed   
 and steps are being built. Entry      
 phones will cut down vandalism.       
 Some families have moved into the new 
 houses so we have new children in     
{Craigmuir Primary School.}There have  
 been many changes to our local area.  </content>
