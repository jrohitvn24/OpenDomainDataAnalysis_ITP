		<content> Most people have to go outside the    
 parish of Cummertrees to do work.Most 
 people have a car or motorbike or get 
 a lift.If you can't drive or can't get
 a lift you can get a bus or taxi.You  
 could cycle to your work if you have  
 a bike.                               
                                       
 In the parish you can work at the     
 village's playgroup, which quite a few
 children go to. When you work at the  
 playgroup maybe twice a year you have 
 to take the children out for a        
 trip.Most people that stay in the     
 parish to work are farmers or farm    
 workers. Farm workers need a          
 driving licence because a lot of farm 
 work is tractor driving.There are lots
 of old people so there are home helps.
