		<content>   As a result of our interviews we    
 discovered that most of those recently
 moved into the area did so because of 
 employment opportunities within the   
 Aberdeen catchment area.  They decided
 to live in Inverurie because of ease  
 of access to work and because our area
 offers a pleasant, healthy living     
 environment.  Many of these people had
 previously lived in high density      
 housing areas and therefore           
 appreciated the unpolluted air and    
 open countryside.                     
   There is still however a small      
 nucleus of original inhabitants.      
 Most of these people enjoy meeting    
 and conversing with newcomers but are 
 regretting the disappearance of the   
 local dialect and are sorry that what 
 was previously a close knit community 
 is rapidly becoming a dormitory town.
