		<content> Pitreavie Community Hut.              
 When the houses were built there was  
 nowhere for meetings and activities   
 so, due to social concern, it was     
 decided there should be a community   
 hut.  The community hut was built in  
 the school playground and that is     
 where the activities take place.  Here
 are some of the activities:-          
 The Alana Brown School of Highland    
 dancing,which takes place on Tuesday  
 teatime. The 20th Dunfermline Guides  
 takes place on Tuesday 7p.m.-9p.m.    
  The Mothers and Toddlers Group on    
 Mondays and Wednesdays)from newly born
 till 3 years old).  Pitcorthie        
 Pre-school Playgroup, Keep Fit; Youth 
 Club on Sundays 7p.m.-9p.m.           
 Sometimes discos and parties take     
 place there.  Kate Lynch.
