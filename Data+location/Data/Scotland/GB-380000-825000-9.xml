		<title>09Oldmeldrum Trunk Routes</title>
		<content> Oldmeldrum lies on the ede of the     
 Thanage of Formartine and the Earldom 
 of the Garioch (pron. Geeree) and has 
 always been a crossroads for east-west
 and north-south traffic.  Goods       
 vehicles from the east coast (Ellon   
 and Peterhead) travel through the town
 on the A.920 to Huntly and the        
 distillery district and on the B.9170 
 to Inverurie.  Traffic also pours     
 through the town from Banff and the   
 north coast on the A.947 turnpike to  
 Aberdeen.  Because of increased       
 traffic in the last decade, plans are 
 underway to upgrade the Oldmeldrum-   
 Inverurie road (B.9170) to category A.
 Residents have recently written       
 concerned letters about the quantity  
 of heavy traffic causing vibration and
 damage to 200 year old buildings in   
 the town centre but there are no      
 immediate plans for a bypass.         </content>
