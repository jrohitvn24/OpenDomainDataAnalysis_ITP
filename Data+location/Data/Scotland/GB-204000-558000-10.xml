		<title>10ATTITUDES - STRANRAER</title>
		<content>  There are many topics that the people
 of Stranraer feel strongly about. To  
 generalise however, a cross section of
 the population felt that:-            
  a) Generally,{amenities}and{services 
 were adequate, although there is a    
 need for{improved train}and{bus       
{services.                             
  b) There should be{more}playgrounds  
 and recreational facilities for both  
 children and adults. One of the major 
 public issues in 1985 is the lack of a
{public swimming pool}or{sports centre.
  c) The council should be doing more  
 to attract{modern technological       
{industries}to the town.               
  d) The town needs a{modern hospital  
 and{shopping centre.}In 1985, it is   
 necessary to travel over fifty miles  
 before reaching a large shopping      
 centre or large general hospital i.e. 
 Ayr, Dumfries or Glasgow.             </content>
