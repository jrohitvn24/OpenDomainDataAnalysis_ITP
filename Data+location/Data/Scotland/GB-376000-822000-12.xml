		<content>   The farm of Lofthillock in the south
 east of our block is one part of a    
 large unit of 1,300 acres owned by the
 Mitchell family for the last 29 years.
   As Lofthillock is the unit nearest  
 the town of Inverurie a large part of 
 the acreage is used to grow vegetables
 to supply their shop in the town.     
 They grow Swedes, Carrots, Cabbages,  
 Brussel Sprouts, Cauliflower, Peas and
 different varieties of potatoes.      
   The other main crops are grass,     
 spring and winter barley and winter   
 wheat.  These crops are grown in      
 rotation with other units outwith our 
 area.                                 
   The main building at Lofthillock    
 houses a huge grain drier and animal  
 food mixer.  The grain from all the   
 farms comes here to be dried and to be
 mixed with vitamins and mineral       
 additives to feed their 800 cattle.   </content>
