		<title>07LONGFORGAN - THE KNAPP II -</title>
		<content> The buildings of the Knapp evolved    
 under Rossie Estate's control long    
 before local Authorities exercised    
 such powers. The burn once turned 12  
 water wheels within 1 mile, and the   
 pre-industrial revolution mill        
 buildings, dwellings and farm         
 steadings comfortably marry           
 traditional forms with a Tudor style. 
 The materials used have developed     
 through rubble with red (Rossie)      
 sandstone dressings to, at the turn of
 the century, one of the earliest uses 
 of mass concrete in Scotland. Much of 
 the village core is so constructed    
 although clever detailing conceals    
 this, to retain the overall character.
 The now "Conservation Area" tries to  
 protect and enhance the appearance of 
 the district, without cold            
 preservation killing off lived-in     
 clutter.                              </content>
