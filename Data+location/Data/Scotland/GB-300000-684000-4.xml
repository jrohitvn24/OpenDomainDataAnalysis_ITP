 High Valleyfield is a mining village  
 set between the River Forth and the

 that time, although some are employed 
 in other pits in the area,            
 unemployment is high.                 
 There are plenty of amenities in the  
 village. It serves the surrounding    
 villages in many ways. There is a     
{Health Centre}with four doctors and a}
