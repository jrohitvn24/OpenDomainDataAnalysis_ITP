		<title>20The Tavern in Kirkfieldbank.</title>
		<content> In the village of Kirkfieldbank is a  
 public house called "The Tavern".   It
 is opposite the War Memorial and      
 Mr.Riley's butcher shop.   There are  
 two parts to the "pub" - the lounge   
 bar and the public bar.   Local       
 residents usually go to the public    
 bar.   Newcomers to the village and   
 holidaymakers most often go to the    
 lounge bar.   The lounge bar is the   
 most comfortable of the two places,   
 having soft chairs and polished wooden
 tables.   Here you can order and enjoy
 a drink with your friends, or eat a   
 bar snack of fish and chips for       
 example, or even have a three course  
 meal in good company.  The bar is open
 from 11am. in the morning until       
 2.30pm.and again from 5pm. until      
 11.30pm in the evening.               
                                       
                                       </content>
