		<content>{Kirkton of Auchterhouse}is the village
 that grew up around the{church}or{kirk
 and is about six hundred and fifty    
 feet above sea-level. The present     
 school is the fourth school standing  
 in the village. At the northern end of
 the village is the{War Memorial.}     
 Joined to it is a drinking trough for 
 horses but no longer used of course.  
 Next to the War Memorial is an old{   
{Wishing Well}which is still running.  
 Nearby is an old{lion's head pump}that
 is no longer in use. There are        
 ninety-six houses in our area         
 including the village and most are    
 owner-occupied. Many of the old farm  
 cottages have been modernised and     
 extended. In addition we have the     
 whole of one large farm, one small    
 farm and parts of two others. To the  
 north the slopes of the{Sidlaws}rise  
 to 1400 feet.                         </content>
