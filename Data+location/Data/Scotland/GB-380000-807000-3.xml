		<title>03Farming in Westhill (cont).</title>
		<content>   Both of the farms use fertiliser    
 on their land to give it better       
 quality.Between them their{crops}     
 consist of turnips,potatoes,corn,     
 barley,grass and hay.                 
                                       
 The rising times of the farmers are   
 between 6.45 am and 7.00am.           
                                       
 Both of the farmers would like their  
 children to continue the farming      
 business,so that their children can   
 continue what their fathers and       
 grandfathers started.                 
                                       
 Both farmers like living in Skene     
 because of its friendly attitude as   
 they have lived here all of their     
 life.
