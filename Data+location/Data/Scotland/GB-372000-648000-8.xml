		<content> MANY FORMS OF TREE FLORISH. THERE ARE 
 SEVERAL SOFTWOOD PLANTATIONS WHICH    
 HAVE BEEN PLANTED AT INTERVALS, BUT   
 THE MOST TYPICAL TREE  IS THE BEECH   
 WHICH GROWS TALL &amp; STRAIGHT. ONE      
 UNIQUE SPECIMEN IN THE LONG AVENUE AT 
 MARCHMONT WAS USED FOR SEED BY A      
 FORESTRY CONSULTANT WHO ACQUIRED THE  
 BEECH MAST, THE TREE BEING TOO TALL &amp; 
 STRAIGHT TO CLIMB, BY SHOOTING IT     
 DOWN. THE LONG AVENUE STRETCHES FOR   
 1.25 MILES IN FRONT OF MARCHMONT &amp; IS 
 A FINE EXAMPLE OF A BEECH AVENUE. IT  
 WAS PLANTED IN 1740 BY THE SECOND EARL
 OF MARCHMONT, 10 YEARS BEFORE HIS SON,
 THE THIRD EARL, BUILT THE HOUSE. THERE
 IS ALSO THE REMAINS OF A CROSS AVENUE 
 OF EVEN OLDER TREES, SOME SPANISH     
 CHESTNUTS, WHICH LED TO THE 17 CENTURY
 HOUSE OF REDBRAES, BESIDE WHOSE RUINS 
 IS A BOX HEDGE OVER 300 YEARS OLD &amp; 20
 FOOT HIGH &amp; ALSO ANCIENT YEW TREES.   </content>
