		<content> The train is left behind and the minor
 road, with tracks to farms crosses the
 area of farmland with sheep and cattle
 grazing peacefully.   They are        
 disturbed only by the train on the    
 single track railway on its way to    
 Stranraer or Glasgow.   There are     
 areas of mixed woodland &amp; heathland   
 with rocky outcrops and streams.   A  
 major road crosses the outer fringe   
 in the west and a minor road in the   
 east, on these are the only shops,    
 farm shops supplying meat to local &amp;  
 passing trade.   The buildings are    
 farm houses and cottages, one farm    
 Kilkenzie Castle dates from 16-17th   
 century, one cottage a dealer in scrap
 metal, rusting bodies of cars         
 surrounded by the sounds of running   
 water and birds.
