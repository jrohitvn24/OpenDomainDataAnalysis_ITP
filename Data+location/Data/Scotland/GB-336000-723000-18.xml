		<content> Gauldry was originally a gallows      
 village.It was first called "The      
 Gallows".This is a very descriptive   
 name as the site where the gallows    
 were can still be visited.Later the   
 name changed to "Gallows Rode".Rode is
 spelt this way in most old books.After
 that the name "Gallows Roa"came into  
 being and then "The Gallery".The final
 change was to Gauldry,but locally the 
 village is still known as "The        
 Gauldry"by many.You can get to the    
 gallows by this route.From the Post   
 Office,follow the main road to        
 Windmill Road.Down this road to Priory
 Road,up Priory Road where you will    
 find gallows field.A grim reminder of 
 the past.
