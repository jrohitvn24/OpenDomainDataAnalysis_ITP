		<title>18TRANSPORT TO SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Because most people live quite far    
 away, they travel to school in a      
 mini-bus and a car.The dinners are    
 cooked at Echt school and the car     
 takes them to our school.In winter    
 there are lots of storms.Last year the
 snow was eight feet deep.The school   
 was closed for two weeks.All the roads
 were blocked and no-one could get out 
 for food.The children from the farms  
 have "storm-addresses" near the school
 in case  they are unable to reach     
 home.Food supplies are delivered for  
 the winter, should anyone have to     
 sleep in the school.When we reach the 
 age of 11 or 12 we go to Alford       
 Academy.It is fifteen miles away so we
 travel by private bus.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
