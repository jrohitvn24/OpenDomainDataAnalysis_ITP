		<content> Main feature of this plot is the town 
 of Largs overlooking the firth of     
 clyde and Backed by hills up to 500m  
 which are grazed by sheep and cattle. 
 This town of 10,000 attracts fewer    
 resident holidaymakers than of late   
 but still attracts many day trippers. 
 The firth, a major waterway, is       
 sheltered and scenic and clyde        
 cruising is popular, today only one   
 paddle steamer remains but there are  
 myriad smaller craft, other maritime  
 connections include a marina,         
 lifeboat, pilot boat, part time       
 fishing boats and ferry connection to 
 the holiday island of Cumbrae.        
 Redundant tourist facilities are being
 converted to accomodation for the     
 growing number of senior citizens who 
 retire to Largs.  This process has    
 recently been accelerated by hefty    
 rates increases.                      </content>
