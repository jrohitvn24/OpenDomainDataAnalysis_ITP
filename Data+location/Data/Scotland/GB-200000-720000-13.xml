		<title>13THE FORESTS AND WILDLIFE.</title>
		<content> The Forestry Commission are the       
 predominant land owners with the      
 earliest plantations in 1955.         
 Three forms of land use can be seen   
 over the last 200 years _Crofting,    
 in the still identifiable township of 
 Collaig,hill sheep farming and        
 forestry which is mainly conifer but  
 still with many of the oaks,ashes,    
 rowans, hazels, alders etc. which     
 covered the land before the advent of 
 sheep. The area abounds with large    
 mammals _the native red and roe deer  
 together with the occasional sika and 
 its hybrids with red deer. These      
 are culled by the forest ranger who   
 also stalks with clients on day       
 permits,this providing extra revenue  
 and sport. Foxes and badgers breed at 
 Achachenna. The golden eagle hunts    
 the high corner of the area and the   
 osprey fishes the loch.               </content>
