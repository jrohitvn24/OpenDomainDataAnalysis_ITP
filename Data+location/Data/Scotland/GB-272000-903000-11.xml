		<title>11Rogart - Trade (Bookshop)</title>
		<content>   There has been a Christian bookshop 
 in Rogart for five years. It sells    
 stationery, cards, Tearcraft goods,   
 Bibles and many Christian books. The  
 shop is open from 14.00 to 17.00 hours
 every Tuesday and Friday.             
  When she's asked, Mrs Woods, the     
 manageress, will provide a bookstall. 
 She's often asked to do this by       
 churches in the area.                 
  The Christian bookshop is in Rogart, 
 because there isn't another one in the
 county of Sutherland and Rogart is    
 quite central for anywhere in         
 Sutherland.                           
  The best-selling book is the Bible.
