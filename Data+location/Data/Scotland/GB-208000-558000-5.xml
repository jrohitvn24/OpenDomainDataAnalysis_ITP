		<content> The{Old village}originally had 14     
 houses mainly for Stair Estate        
 workers. There was no electricity,    
 inside toilet or water supply.The     
 water was obtained from a pump which  
 was situated at what is now the Stair 
 Estates Sawmill.There was a shop and  
 sub Post Office run by three spinsters
 named Patterson.There was also a busy 
 railway station.                      
                                       
 The{New village}has 11 private houses 
 and 93 council houses. There is little
 industry but we have a shop and an    
 estate sawmill. We have no doctor,no  
 policeman and no fire station.They    
 have to come from Stranraer which is 3
 miles away. Castle Kennedy School has 
 52 pupils and 3 teachers.It was built 
 19 years ago. The main railway line   
 from Stranraer(which links to Belfast)
 to London runs through the village.   </content>
