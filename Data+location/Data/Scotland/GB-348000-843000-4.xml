    In the centre of the Parish of     
 Cairnie is a builders yard. The owner 
 used to employ 7 or 8 men but now     
 works on his own. Most of his work is 
 done locally not extending beyond     
 Huntly and Keith.                     
                                       
    He makes bungalows and farm        
 buildings. He also does house         
 extensions but most of his work is    
 concerned with the general maintenance
 and repair of existing buildings.     
                                       
    In the yard he makes concrete      
 blocks and artificial granite blocks; 
 concrete lintels and window-sills. All
 other work is done on the site.       
    Although he does use some locally  
 grown timber, most of the timber he   
 uses is imported red or white pine.   </content>
