		<title>17School: Teacher/Pupil Survey</title>
		<content> Most of the pupils in the school like 
 it here because the teachers aren't   
 too strict and everyone gets along    
 with them. Pupils also like it because
 we have longer dinner breaks when     
 sport is taking place and because we  
 now have a tuckshop. Pupils who said  
 they didn't like the school don't like
 school at all. The most liked lessons 
 were P.E. &amp; Music and the most        
 disliked were Art &amp; Maths because they
 can't do the work and they don't like 
 the teachers. The teachers said they  
 did like the school because it's      
 small, it's in the country and because
 pupils and teachers get along both    
 during and after school. The teachers 
 said that the only things they don't  
 like are the weather and the poor     
 facilities. Some of the teachers have 
 been here as long as 29yrs and some as
 short as 5 months.                    </content>
