 owns Parknowe- a Dairy/Arable Farm.The
 Breed of cows he has is Friesian. He  
 owns three bulls.He also has 120      
 milking cows.The  give the cows dairy 
 cake while they are being milked. One 
 cow can produce bout 2200 litres a    
 day.My dads milk is collected by the  
 Scottish Milk Marketing Board so he   
 does not know where it goes. My dad   
 has 12 calves because he has sold a   
 lot. They are sold at the farm most of
 the time . Roughly 160 calves are born
 in a year. My dad also has 200 other  
 dairy heifers. Some of the illneses   
 that cows can get are - Tuberculosis, 
 Brucellosis,Pneumonia,Mastitis,
