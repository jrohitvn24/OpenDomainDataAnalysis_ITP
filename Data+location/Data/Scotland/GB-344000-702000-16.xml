		<content>   There is one 'police house' in      
 Colinsburgh with one "local bobby",   
 although he works from the larger     
 police station base of Anstruther and 
 so has to deal with wider problems.   
 Similarly 'outside ' police may have  
 to deal with any Colinsburgh fracas,  
 which are few.                        
   In North East Fife District of Fife 
 region, much of the local government  
 is done by the District.Wider         
 issues,(education,police etc) are the 
 oversee of the Region.                
  The currently elected M.P. is        
 Conservative.                         
  The villagers can air direct         
 grievances to the monthly Colinsburgh 
 and Kilconquhar Community Council and 
 occasionally this body can bring      
 successful pressure to bear.
