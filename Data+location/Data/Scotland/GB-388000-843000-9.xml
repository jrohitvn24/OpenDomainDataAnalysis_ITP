		<title>09My House near New Deer</title>
		<content>   My house is a big old farmhouse     
 called{South Mains of Auchmaliddie.   
 Parts of the house are over{200 years 
{old}and some parts, like the back     
 porch, are new.                       
   My mum and dad moved into the house 
 before I was born and they{modernised 
 the house. They did a lot of the work 
 themselves helped by our neighbour,   
 who they bought the house from. They  
 also had some of the work done by     
 masons, electricians and plumbers.    
   We now have{oil-fired central       
{heating and double glazing}which my   
 dad put in and the house is much more 
 cosy.                                 
  {Lots of the houses round about have 
{been renovated}in recent years so the 
 people who live in them are not so    
 cold in the winter.
