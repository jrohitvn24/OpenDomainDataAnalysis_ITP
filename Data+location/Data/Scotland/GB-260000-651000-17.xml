		<title>17Health E.K.Health Centre</title>
		<content>   We all think the health centre is a 
 place of great  use.It opens at 9am   
 and closes either at 5.30pm or 6.00pm.
 30 people work in the centre and they 
 all say they enjoy it.Inside it is    
 split up into different parts.One part
 is for the chiropodist and one section
 for the dentist.The four doctors share
 one big section.The waiting rooms are 
 spotless and on the posters you can   
 read all about the diseases you can   
 catch.At the baby clinic they use a   
 Manchester Rattle to test the babies' 
 hearing.The sphygmomanometer tests the
 babies heart rate.There is a room     
 called the slimmers room for          
 overweight people and there is also a 
 speech therapy room for children.Our  
 class visited the centre and we       
 learned all about it.It was very      
 interesting and enjoyable.
