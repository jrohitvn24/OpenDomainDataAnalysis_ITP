		<title>03Arbroath housing.</title>
		<content> In our "D" block there is a wide      
 variety of housing, privately-owned   
 and many types of council houses.There
 are small houses specially for        
 old-aged pensioners and single people,
 there are semi-detached and terraced  
 houses but no multi-storeyed flats as 
 Arbroath is such a small town.        
       One of the very interesting     
 projects that is taking place is that 
 the council is renovating old houses  
 in the centre of the town instead of  
 just building further and further out.
 This means that the character of the  
 centre of Arbroath is being retained  
 and people are being kept nearer to   
 the shops, etc.                       
        The houses that we looked at   
 beside the library were very nice     
 indeed.
