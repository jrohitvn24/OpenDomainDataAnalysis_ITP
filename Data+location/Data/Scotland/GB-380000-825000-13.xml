		<content> The gala sports day held in Oldmeldrum
 each year is usully opened by an      
 entertainment celebrity. In the last  
 few years these have included Diana   
 Dors, an international star; Selina   
 Scott, a Yorkshire girl who spent two 
 years with Grampian Television in     
 Aberdeen before joining BBC-TV        
 Breakfast Time; and Jane Franchi, a   
 local girl who gained popularity      
 through her television work for BBC   
 Scotland.  Part of the celebrity's    
 duties at the Sports is to award the  
 prize to the winning youth group in   
 the float parade.  This event involves
 young people from all the local clubs 
 and sports groups who decorate their  
 trailer float to a given theme and    
 perform their chosen drama while being
 towed around the field by a tractor.  
 Prizes for the three winning entries  
 are Â£5, Â£10 and Â£15.                  </content>
