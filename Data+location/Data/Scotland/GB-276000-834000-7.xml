  Moy is a quiet place. It is far away 
 from shops. We have to travel 12 miles
 to Inverness to go shopping. We have a
 grocer's van, a post van, a mik van, a
 coalman and  mobile library.          
  People here like the peace and the   
 freedom. Children usually play out of 
 doors or watch television. The Rockery
 is a favourite place to play.         
  Most of the houses are old and have  
 two storeys with gardens. They are far
 apart. The average family size is 4.  
 Most people have their own cars, two  
 have motor bikes. Children cycle to   
 school.
