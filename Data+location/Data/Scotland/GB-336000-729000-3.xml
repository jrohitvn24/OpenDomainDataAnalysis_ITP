		<title>03THE TAY RAILWAY BRIDGE</title>
		<content>   The present bridge connects{Aberdeen
 with{Edinburgh and the South;}        
 passengers cross both the Forth Bridge
 and the{Tay Bridge}on this journey.   
   Built on a curve to counteract the  
 strong currents, this bridge was      
 opened on{July 11th 1887}because in{  
{1879},a train carrying{75}passengers  
 plunged into the river as the first   
 Tay Rail Bridge collapsed at the      
 height of a great storm. All were     
 killed; only{46}bodies were recovered.
   This first bridge, at the time{the  
{longest bridge in the world,}collapsed
 because of cheap engineering after    
 only 19 months of operation.          
   It is possible the slang word{      
{"Botch"}comes from the name of the    
 architect,{Thomas Bouch.}             
   The new bridge was designed by{W.H. 
{Barlow,}with ironwork by{Sir William  
{Arrol;}it was completed in{1886.}     </content>
