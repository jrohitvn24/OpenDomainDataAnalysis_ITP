		<content> Like pupils of 1985, she played with  
 plasticine but instead of pencil and  
 paper of today she used a slate and   
 pencil. Desks used to be in tiers with
 very severe discipline; today desks   
 are in small groups round which       
 children are busily occupied and no   
 belt is used for discipline.  Children
 used to walk to school in large groups
 down the middle of the road but today 
 taxis transports children along a now 
 very busy road. One girl used to come 
 to school on a pony! In the playground
 the Fife dialect was predominant but  
 today English is heard in both the    
 classroom and the playground. Singing 
 games, chanting, marbles, rope and    
 ball games were more popular in her   
 childhood in the playground; marbles  
 are used today from time to time but  
 the playground, which slopes to a busy
 road, precludes ball games.           </content>
