		<title>02TOURISM IN THE BARR AREA</title>
		<content> In the summer months many tourists    
 travel into the Carrick hills to visit
 the conservation village of Barr.There
 are two hotels in the village and both
 are geared to the tourist trade       
 providing meals,refreshments and      
 accommodation.Tourists are usually in 
 the area to take advantage of trout or
 salmon fishing in the river Stinchar  
 or coarse-fishing in the many hill    
 lochs in the Carrick Forest which is  
 part of the larger Glen Trool Forest  
 Park.Hill-walking is a most popular   
 outdoor activity with most spectacular
 views of many of the highest Southern 
 Upland peaks and views across the     
 Firth of Clyde from Auchensoul Hill   
 (310m)1km.W.N.W.of the village.       
 Villagers benefit from the passing    
 tourist trade by baking for the Tea   
 Room,waiting at the tables and        
 selling locally made crafts.          </content>
