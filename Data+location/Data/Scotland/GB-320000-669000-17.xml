		<title>17SAUGHTON PARK GARDENS</title>
		<content>  Saughton Park Gardens can be found at
 the junction of Gorgie Road and       
 Balgreen Road. In 1652 there was a    
 mansion built there with large private
 gardens. In 1900 the Edinburgh        
 Corporation bought the house and      
 gardens for the sum of Â£52,900, which 
 was alot of money in those days. Three
 hundred years after it was built the  
 Corporation burnt the house to the    
 ground as it had dry rot and was      
 threatening to collapse. The stone    
 work was used to make roads but the   
 gardens were tidied up and the Park   
 was made.                             
  The majority of people who visit the 
 park live near it, some even as near  
 as Balgreen Road and Stevenson Drive. 
 Some people we spoke to live as far as
 Penicuik and Livingston but one person
 lived as far away as Girvan.
