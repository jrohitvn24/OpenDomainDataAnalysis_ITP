		<title>09Farming in the Alford area</title>
		<content> Farming is the most important industry
 in the area.Most are large mixed farms
 growing cereals and raising beef      
 cattle.Falling demand for beef from   
 the cost and health conscious house-  
 wife has resulted in fewer cattle     
 being raised. There is one dairy farm.
 Crops grown are spring and winter     
 barley and wheat,oats,turnips,potatoes
 grass for hay and increasingly silage.
 This year some have grown oil seed    
 rape,linseed and protein peas. A      
 combination of these crops spreads the
 work more evenly through the year.    
 Barley is the main crop. Some goes for
 seed, some for malting, some for      
 animal feedstuffs and some to the EEC 
 grain mountains.Modern machinery means
 a costly investment and fewer men are 
 employed.
