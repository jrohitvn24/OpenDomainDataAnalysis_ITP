		<title>12A DAY ON THE DOLE</title>
		<content>{  Elizabeth is 21 years old and is    
{unemployed.  Her husband works.       
                                       
 "I get up at 1pm. every day and I     
 clean the house.  I usually go around 
 to my mother-in-law's for my niece and
 I have her all day.  I also go to my  
 mother's; in there I talk and watch   
 the baby.  At 5pm I take the baby down
 the road and go up the road to my own 
 house and make the dinner for my      
 husband coming in. At 6.30 I do my    
 dishes, then watch TV, play cards and 
 go out to my sister-in-law's.         
   I also go back down to my mother's, 
 and at 10.30 I go back to my own      
 house, watch more TV and make my      
 husband something to eat.  At 11pm we 
 play cards again and we also watch the
 TV so we don't get bored.  We go to   
 bed about 1am."
