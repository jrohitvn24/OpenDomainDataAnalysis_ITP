		<title>04NOW, A BOY'S LIFE</title>
		<content>  In Letham a boy has plenty to do.For 
 instance there is a park where you can
 play football and just next to it     
 there is a Cub hut where the Cubs meet
 on Tuesdays, and Scouts on            
 Fridays. Discos and jumble sales are  
 held for funds.                       
  I wake up at 7.50am in the morning   
 and leave for school at 8.30am.At     
 10.45 there is an interval for 15     
 mins.At 12.25 we get out for lunch    
 and return at 1.40.School comes out at
 3.30pm,I don't have far to go home.On 
 Thursday and Sundays my friends and I 
 have a club called "THE WARLOCK       
 CLUB"where we exchange role playing   
{adventure game-books}to see who can   
 get through the difficult adventures. 
  Living in the country we can also    
 fish in the burn and climb trees.
