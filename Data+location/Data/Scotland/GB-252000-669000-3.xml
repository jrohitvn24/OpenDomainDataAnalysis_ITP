		<content> MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS AREA       
 FEEL VERY BAD ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF THE
 TORY GOVERNMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT    
 OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SECURITY.        
 MOST YOUNG PEOPLE BLAME THE           
 GOVERNMENT FOR UNEMPLOYMENT.          
 AS A RESULT OF UNEMPLOYMENT MANY      
 PEOPLE IN THE DRUMCHAPEL AREA HAVE    
 LOST HOPE. MANY PEOPLE HAVE TURNED TO 
 CRIME AND DRUG ABUSE.                 
                                       
 BEARSDEN AND KNIGHTSWOOD ARE HARDLY   
 AFFECTED BY SUCH PROBLEMS.            
                                       
 ON THE POSITIVE SIDE,THE MAJORITY OF  
 PEOPLE MAINTAIN A CHEERFUL APPROACH TO
 LIFE DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES.        
                                       
 THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF THE        
 DRUMCHAPEL AREA.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
