		<content>      Separating Hardgate and Faifley  
 from the rest of Clydebank runs the   
 busy A82 which is a dual carriageway  
 known locally  as "the boulevard".It  
 carries all traffic north up the west 
 coast of Scotland or east to the      
 centre of Glasgow.It also connects    
 with the Erskine Bridge to take       
 vehicles down to the Firth of Clyde or
 to Glasgow Airport.                   
      Half the population have cars and
 use these routes frequently for       
 business and pleasure.                
      There are no train services in   
 this area but the residents are well- 
 served by buses connecting Faifley    
 etc. with the centre of Clydebank.    
 Other bus services provide easy access
 to Glasgow which is only 20 minutes   
 away.
