		<content> New Lanark is one of the most         
 important sites in Scotland for       
 industrial archeology. It is famous   
 for its associations, during the      
 industrial revolutin, with Robert Owen
 who put into practice some experiments
 to see how men and women would sdjust 
 to the new machines and the factory   
 life. The cotton mills were built in  
 New Lanark on the River Clyde deep in 
 the wooded gorge of the river close to
 the beautiful Falls of Clyde nature   
 reserve, which is upstream of the     
 village. In the village you can see a 
 store, a nursery for 300 poor children
 and a school. There is also a building
 called the Institute for the Formation
 of Character. The working conditions  
 in New Lanark were considered to be   
 very good for their times.
