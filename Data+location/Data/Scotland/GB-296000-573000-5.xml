 west of the Maxwelltown area in       
 Dumfries. It is made up of a big show 
 field, a small cattle and horse farm a
 grazing field and a paddock. A lady   
 called Mrs Bell owns the small farm   
 and Dumfries and Galloway Agricultural

 owns the  grazing   field and paddock.

 used for cattle and horses, the farm  
 is only used for cattle and horses,   
 and the showfield is used for special 
 events such as  the circus, the       
 vintage car show and any other        
 spectacular events like that.
