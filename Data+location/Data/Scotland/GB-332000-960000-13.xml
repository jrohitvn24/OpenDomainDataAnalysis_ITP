		<content> LIBRARY SERVICE                       
 A{mobile library}comes to the village 
 once a fortnight, on Tuesdays.  The   
 stock of books it carries is limited, 
 but any book may be ordered from the  
 Librarian.  It is quite common for    
 books to arrive more quickly when     
 ordered from the Library van than when
 ordered from the main Library in Wick.
                                       
 REFUSE COLLECTION                     
 The bin men come on Tuesday mornings. 
 They don't always follow the same     
 route around the village.  Having the 
 wind blowing on their backs ensures   
 that ashes caught by the wind are not 
 blown into the men's faces.
