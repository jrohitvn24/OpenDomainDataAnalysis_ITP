		<content> The{landscape}of this area is very    
 much a result of{human interference.  
 This is shown by the large areas of   
 housing and wasteland.  There is a    
 wide variety of housing types         
 resulting from the early development  
 of this area.  Prior to 1914 this     
 consisted of linear or ribbon         
 development along the{A722}(West to   
 East- Kirk Road, Cambusnethan Street  
 both Wishaw and Manse Road, Newmains).
 As well as this there were a number of
 nodes especially around Newmains Cross
 housing the workers of the Coltness   
 Iron Works{(GR. 823553),}Coltness     
 Colliery, Bailliesmuir Pit No. 1{(GR. 
{825566)}and Moss Colliery as well as  
 the numerous clay pits.  Another node 
 is Bonkle Village{(GR. 836569),}a     
 village connected with the local      
 estate.
