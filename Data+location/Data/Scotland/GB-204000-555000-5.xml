		<title>05PILTANTON BURN</title>
		<content> When the burn enters the study area it
 is 1/3 of the way along its course. At
 this point the{PILTANTON}is full of   
 reeds, the water is reasonably clear  
 and the muddy bottom is visible. There
 is also a large amount of slime. As   
 the burn continues on its course the  
 reeds remain plentiful and the water  
 becomes murky obscuring the bottom.   
 The visible stones are covered in     
 mosses and slime. As it passes a      
 derelict dam the burn develops a fusty
 smell, but this soon disappears. When 
 the burn runs under the bridge at{    
{LOCHANS}village the water has cleared,
 due to an increase in width and a     
 reduction in depth, this allows the   
 bottom to come into view. The burn    
 there is polluted with rubbish such as
 wheels and cans. The number of reeds  
 has decreased but there is still alot 
 of slime.                             </content>
