		<content> This is a general descripiton of our D
 block.                                
{New Farm Loch}is a very new Council   
 housing  estate in Kilmarnock, which  
 was built approximately fifteen years 
 ago. The A77 from Ayr to Glasgow runs 
 past New Farm Loch.                   
 In our D block there is a railway     
 line that is one of the main railways 
 to London.                            
 Our D block has approximately 66% open
 space and grass land and 34% housing. 
 In our D block 50% of the houses are  
 private and the rest are council      
 houses.                               
{Crookedholm and Hurlford}are two small
 villages which are in very close      
 proximity to Kilmarnock. The river    
 Irvine runs through a part of         
 Hurlford. In our D block we have a    
 hospital for old people.
