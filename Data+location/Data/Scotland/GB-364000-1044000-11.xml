		<title>11RABBITS</title>
		<content>{Mr.W.Sichel}of Upper{Breckan}has an   
 occupation which is unique in Sanday. 
 In May 1983{Mr.Sichel}started breeding
 rabbits for their meat.He started out 
 with 3 does and 1 buck,and has now got
 44 pure bred{Californian}does and 5   
 bucks.                                
 Originally the rabbits were kept in a 
 caravan,but recently a huge shed has  
 been erected to house them.The shed   
 contains 101 cages,and is 64 feet     
 long,24 feet wide and 10 feet high.   
 To make it a profitable business each 
 rabbit must have a litter of at least 
 10 young.The young rabbits are killed 
 from 11_12 weeks and are sold either  
 in{Sanday}or{Eday},although he hopes  
 to expand his market to the whole of  
 Orkney and hopefully{Shetland}in      
 September 1985.                       
 1 pound of farm bred rabbit meat      
 retails at a price of{Â£1.20.          </content>
