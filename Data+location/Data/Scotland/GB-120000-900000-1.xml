		<title>01Location of Rhenigidale</title>
		<content>{RHENIGIDALE}is a small remote village 
 in the Western Isles, which are to the
 north-west of the mainland of         
 Scotland. There are four occupied     
 houses, a hostel and a school. Twelve 
 people live here and there is also a  
 radio telephone link. There is no road
 to this village at present so the only
 way in or out is by sea or on foot.   
 Rhenigidale is on the eastern  coast  
 of the island of Harris which is not  
 actually a complete island since      
 it is joined to the larger island of  
 Lewis.When the weather is suitable it 
 is quite easy for a boat to come in   
 and out. Unfortunately when the South 
 Westerly wind is blowing as is often  
 the case it is not possible to land   
 anything. It is four miles to the     
 nearest road by the footpath which    
 joins the road two miles from Tarbert,
 the nearest shop to Rhenigidale.      </content>
