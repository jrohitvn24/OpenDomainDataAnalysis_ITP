		<content>    One of the most interesting names  
 is {Hospital Road.}This is the road   
 where our school is. The road used to 
 lead to the Isolation Hospital at {   
{Springbells.                          
    When it was built it was a long way
 out of the town, as it was a fever    
 hospital. Now it is surrounded by new 
 houses and it has not been used as a  
 hospital for a long time.             
    The buildings have been used for   
 several purposes, such as a Children's
 Home, which has also now closed. Now  
 it is used as a Nursery School and as 
 houses for old age pensioners, while  
 some of the buildings are empty at the
 moment.                               
    This building is across the road   
 from our school. There is a suggestion
 that it should now be used a hostel   
 for homeless people.
