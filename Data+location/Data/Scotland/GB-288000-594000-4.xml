		<content> In the Thornhill area the wildlife    
 consists of deer,birds,rabbits,hares, 
 badgers,squirrels,frogs,toads,voles   
 and shrews.                           
 Deer are one of the fastest animals   
 around here and are one of the        
 strongest,they can jump very high.    
 There are lots of birds around here   
 like sparrows,robins,bluetits etc.    
 Birds of Prey around here mostly live 
 in the hills but the owls will stay in
 the woods and hunt. You can get lots  
 of owls like Barn Owls, Snowy         
 Owls,Tawny Owls and Long-eared Owls.  
 Kestrels mostly live up high on hills 
 and you don't see many on low ground. 
 Buzzards are big birds and are very   
 sharp eyed which is how they find     
 their prey.                           
 Badgers are the rarest around here.   
 They are very shy and nocturnal.
