There is only one remaining Public Call Box in the Village, located by the Bright Water Centre near to the old CalMac Slipway.  The Post Office closed a couple of years ago, though we currently have a PO Service from Broadford several times a week.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are two Post Boxes in the Village, one by the former Camerons Shop and the other on Old Kyle Farm Road.  The Ferry has been replaced by the toll-free Skye Bridge and there is a good bus service serving all parts of the Island and Mainland.   &lt;br />
