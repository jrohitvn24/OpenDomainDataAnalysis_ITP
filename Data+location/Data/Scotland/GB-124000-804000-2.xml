 The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) 
 have owned the island since 1981. They
 are therefore the landowners and      
 employers of the majority of the      
 population. Everyone depends on them  
 in some way.                          
 During the summer the NTS bring work  
 parties of approximately 10 people    
 who do various maintenance activities 
 on the island and have a holiday at   
 the same time. They stay in Tigh Ard  
 for a small fee. Tigh Ard is also let 
 for self_catering holidays. There is  
 also a bothy that can sleep 6.        
 Other summer visitors are people from 
 visiting yachts who use the sheltered 
 harbour and some campers. There are no
 facilities on the island for these    
 people. In the winter there are few   
 visitors to the island so the         
 population remains stable.            </content>
