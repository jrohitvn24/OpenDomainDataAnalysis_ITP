      As well as heather, its close    
 relatives, cross leaved heath and bell
 heather are found, as are blaeberry,  
 cowberry and crowberry.               
      In more fertile parts, there are 
 swards of sheep's fescue grass with   
 thyme, self-heal and purging-flax.    
      Many woodland plants flower      
 before the trees above them come into 
 leaf. Wood anenome, wood sorrel,      
 common violet, lesser celandine,      
 primrose and blue-bell are all to be  
 found flowering in late spring.       
      The humid climate is particularly
 favourable to mosses and liverwarts   
 which often completely cover boulders.
 Lichens too, do well in the clean air.
      Where there is lime in the soil  
 more demanding species can be found ie
 ash, wych-elm, dogs mercury and       
 woodruff.                             </content>
