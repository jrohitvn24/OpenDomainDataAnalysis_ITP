 Family size in our area ranges from   
 small to very large.  We believe that 
 the average size family is 5 including
 parents.  Most families live in farm  
 houses or farm cottages although not  
 all familes are associated with farm  
 work as in the past.  In the Muir of  
 Fowlis area there are many new houses.
 Living in the country is becoming less
 popular for economic reasons e.g. the 
 rising cost of travel.                
 Approximately 59 people live in the   
 village of Muir of Fowlis but a       
 greater number of people live in      
 isolated outlying areas.  Most people 
 have to travel for amenities -        
 shopping, dentist etc., either to     
 Alford (5 miles) or Aberdeen (25      
 miles). Most families have a car and a
 large percentage have more than one.  
 Most women in the area can drive.     </content>
