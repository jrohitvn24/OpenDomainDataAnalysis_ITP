		<content> We play quite a lot of games but the  
 the most common game is football even 
 the girls play. At school we play     
 cricket, rounders,British bulldogs and
 many other things. We also play dodge 
 ball which is very good and mini      
 volley ball. The girls play netball or
 badminton. At nights we play on our   
 bikes.                                
 Football is a team game.You cannot    
 touch the ball except for the         
 goalkeeper.The object of the game is  
 to put the ball at the back of the    
 net. Cricket is easy. There is a      
 bowler, batters and fielders. The     
 batters have to hit the ball with a   
 bat. You can be caught out or stumped 
 out or even L.B.W. which means leg    
 before wicket . A fielder gets the    
 ball and throws it back so that his   
 team can get the batters out.
