		<title>01KEISS VILLAGE AND AREA</title>
		<content>  This area is located on the north    
 east coast of Caithness, on the shores
 of Sinclair Bay. The area comprises   
 the village of Keiss, bounded to the  
 north,west and south by flat farmland.
   The village of Keiss gets its name  
 from the old Norse word 'keis' meaning
 "a rounded ridge".   The village is   
 30m.above sea level while the highest 
 point of the block is 60m. above sea  
 level,and the lowest point is at sea  
 level.  Some 400 people live in the   
 area                                  
   The village harbour,built in the    
 1850's,is used for crab fishing, while
 the farmland is used for rearing      
 sheep and cattle and growing winter   
 feed.                                 
   There is a rich historical tradition
 with 3 brochs and two castles in the  
 block.
