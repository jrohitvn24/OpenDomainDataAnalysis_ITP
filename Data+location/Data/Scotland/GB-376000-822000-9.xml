   Bructor farm is run in conjunction  
 with a neighbouring farm - Coutens.   
 Together they cover 400 acres and are 
 farmed by Mr E. Booth and his grandson
 Mr E. Simmers.                        
   The chief enterprise is fattening   
 cattle of which they own 400.  Until  
 10 years ago Bructor had been a dairy 
 farm retailing milk to the nearby town
 of Oldmeldrum, but due to increasing  
 production costs changed to fattening 
 cattle for beef.  Approximately half  
 the land is used for growing barley   
 which if of an adequate standard goes 
 for malting to be made into whisky.   
 If the grain is not of an acceptable  
 standard then it is sold as cattle    
 fodder.                               
   Mr Booth employs three men on his   
 farm besides his grandson, two        
 tractormen and one cattleman.         </content>
