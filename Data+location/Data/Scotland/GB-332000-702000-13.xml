 Kennoway are the{Carriston and Donald 
{Rose Reservoirs.                      
  Carriston was built in 1885 and has a
 catchment area of 1056 acres, a       
 surface area of 24 acres and a        
 capacity of 45 million gallons with a 
 maximum depth of 6m.                  
  Donald Rose was built in 1929 and has
 a surface area of 19 acres and a      
 capacity of 100 million gallons with a
 maximum depth of 16m.                 
  The Milldeans Burn feeds both        
 reservoirs and can be diverted to feed
 either or by-pass them altogether.    
  Constructed by the{Wemyss and        
{District Water Trust}to supply water  
 to the Buckhaven and Methil areas,    
 today they are kept in reserve        
 following recent improvements in      
 Regional water supplies. Both are     
 maintained by{Fife Regional Council.  </content>
