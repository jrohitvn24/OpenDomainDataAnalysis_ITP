		<title>12Shopping at Kylesku</title>
		<content>  Shopping has changed greatly in      
 the last sixty years. In the 1920s    
 goods were delivered to Kylesku by    
 boat, from Orkney. Because these boats
 called infrequently, large orders had 
 to be placed.                         
  As roads improved there was not the  
 same need for the boat.Vans served the
 area on a regular basis. When more    
 people became car owners, the number  
 of vans decreased until now only three
 vans come round, a fruit van, a fish  
 van and a draper's van.               
  Nowadays most people travel the      
 ninety miles to  Inverness, to stock  
 up with food at the supermarkets.     
  Many tourists stop to wonder and     
 buy from our "immobile", mobile shop  
 which has been part of the community  
 for the last twelve years, supplying  
 fresh milk and bread. Luckily for us, 
 it also supplies ice-cream and sweets.</content>
