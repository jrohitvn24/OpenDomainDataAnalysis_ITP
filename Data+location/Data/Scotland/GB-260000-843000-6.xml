		<content>   In our area most people have a car. 
 Among the school pupils all the       
 families have a car except one. They  
 usually cycle to town. There is a bus 
 service with the buses running eight  
 times a day to Inverness and twice on 
 a Saturday. In our school when we have
 outings we hire buses to take us to   
 various places.                       
   If you want a taxi you have to phone
 to Inverness for one. Most taxis are  
 just normal cars with taxi signs on   
 them. There is a train line running   
 through our block but the station at  
 Bunchrew is now closed and the trains 
 run straight through from Inverness to
 Beauly.
