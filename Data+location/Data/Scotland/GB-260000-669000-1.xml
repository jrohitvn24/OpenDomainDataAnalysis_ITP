		<content>{Bishopbriggs}is a dormitory suburb of 
 Glasgow, approximately 6 km. from the 
 city centre on the North side of the  
 city.                                 
 It has grown considerably to its      
 present population of between 25,000  
 and 30,000 within the last 20 years.  
 There are few employment opportunities
 within the settlement and many people 
 travel into Glasgow to find work.     
 It lies within a convenient location  
 having the facilities of a large city 
 on its doorstep, but is within easy   
 reach of the countryside especially   
 the Campsie Fells which lie only a few
 km. away to the north.
