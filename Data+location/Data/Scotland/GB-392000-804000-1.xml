		<title>01OUR D-BLOCK</title>
		<content> Our D-block is mainly a residential   
 area with a fairly high concentration 
 of commercial properties and includes 
 the areas of Rosemount,Albyn and Union
 Street.The majority of buildings are  
 of granite and were built in the 19th 
 century.The exceptions are the new    
 housing and office properties which   
 have been built since the oil boom in 
 the sixties.Much of this development  
 has been in response to the tremendous
 influx of oil workers.Although much of
 the harbour area is located in this   
 block we decided to include all the   
 text about it in our adjoining D-block
 which is predominately sea and        
 harbour. This has therefore allowed us
 to focus more on the characteristics  
 of the city centre and the residential
 areas which typify such a large       
 percentage of this D-block.
