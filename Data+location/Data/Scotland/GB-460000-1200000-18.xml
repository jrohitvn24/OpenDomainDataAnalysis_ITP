		<title>18Uyeasound Shopping.</title>
		<content> Many people in Uyeasound shop at      
 Harold's.The old folk in the Sheltered
 Housing need a local shop so they can 
 buy things they need without having to
 walk too far.The shop opens at 9.30   
 and closes at 6.00,everyday except    
 Sunday when it does not open at all   
 and Thursday when it closes at 1.00.  
 You can buy everything at this shop.  
   A mobile fish van visits Uyeasound  
 on Tuesdays.It is a new van and most  
 people find this a useful service.    
   If you do not have a car you can    
 take the Overland bus to Lerwick.     
 People occasionally shop in Lerwick   
 where things are cheaper and there is 
 more choice.Going to Lerwick is a full
 day's outing as it takes at least 2   
 hours to get there and 2 hours to get 
 back.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
