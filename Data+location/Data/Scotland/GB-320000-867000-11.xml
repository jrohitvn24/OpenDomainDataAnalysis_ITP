		<title>11ROADS IN LOSSIEMOUTH AREA</title>
		<content>   There are three major and secondary 
 roads in this area, the A941, the     
 B9135 and the B9103. The A941 goes to 
 Elgin, the B9135 runs past the RAF    
 camp and then joins the A941, and the 
 B9135 joins the main road to Aberdeen.
   The busiest road with traffic       
 leaving Lossiemouth is the A941       
 because of the shops in Elgin and     
 because many people work there. The   
 B9135 is quite busy because of people 
 going in and out of the RAF camp to   
 work. The B9103 is least busy.        
   There is only one bus service from  
 Lossiemouth, running to Elgin.        
 Buses run every quarter or half hour, 
 depending on the day and time of day, 
 but on Sundays they run every two     
 hours.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
