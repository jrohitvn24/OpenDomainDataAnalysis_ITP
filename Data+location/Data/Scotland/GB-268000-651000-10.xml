{TYPES OF HOUSING}                     
   Older developments are grid pattern 
 Semi-detached. Then we move on to cir-
 cular patterns (Eddlewood, Fairhill)  
 followed by the latest trends at      
 Woodhead with segregated traffic and  
 pedestrians.                          
   Few if any shops built in areas.    
 Garages only built in later develop-  
 ments (Meikle Earnock, Woodhead).     
   Housing is typically Local Authority
 terraces, semi-detached, low rise     
 flats. No tower blocks. Some Meikle   
 Earnock housing was built for letting 
 at "Economic" rents. Many of these    
 have now been purchased by their      
 tenants. Most people seemed  happy    
 with their housing, but{not}with their
 rent and rates.
