		<content> Up Helly Aa is a fire festival which  
 is usually held in January or         
 February.This festival is held to     
 celebrate the end of winter.Up Helly  
 Aa is held all over Shetland but the  
 biggest festival is held in           
 Lerwick.                              
   The first Uyeasound Up Helly Aa was 
 held in 1911 when there were 20       
 assorted guizers. Guizers are people  
 who dress up and take part in the     
 celebration. With a dwindling         
 population in South Unst during the   
 1930's, Up Helly Aa became a smaller  
 celebration until the whole of Unst   
 joined in.                            
   In 1985 there was a new galley which
 was followed in the procession by 24  
 squads of guizers carrying lighted    
 torches.After the bonfire,the guizers 
 performed their acts in the Village   
 Hall and dancing continued all night. </content>
