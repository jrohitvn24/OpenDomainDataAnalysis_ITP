		<title>14A Pupil's Day</title>
		<content> A usual  day for me would be to get   
 up at 8.00am. I have breakfast of     
 cereal and pure orange juice. Then I  
 walk to school. The school opens at   
 9.15am. I usually arrive at 9.00am. At
 school in the morning we usually do   
 mental arithmetic and maths. Our      
 playtime starts at 10.30am and ends at
 10.45am. I play Buzz Off with my      
 friends Laurae and Susan. After       
 playtime we spend the rest of the     
 morning doing maths and sometimes     
 using the computer. We have lunch at  
 12.20pm. I usually have a sandwich or 
 chips and a cup of coffee. After lunch
 we have our project and sometimes     
 sports. We have playtime at 2.15pm    
 until 2.30pm and go home at 3.30. When
 I get home I get changed and play my  
 violin. After my tea I watch T.V. My  
 favourite programme is Spitting Image.
