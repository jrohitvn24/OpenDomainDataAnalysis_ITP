		<content>{The Market Park.}The recent arrival of
 the Sunday Market (in the premises of 
 Kinross Motor Auctions just outside   
 the study area) is a reminder of the  
 days when the Market Park,opposite the
 Green Hotel,was the site for 3 annual 
 fairs.These were the March Fair,the   
 Apple Market,so called because of the 
 large quantities of apples sold,and   
 the Jooley Fair.The last of these was 
 the year's main event where cattle    
 were sold and people were entertained 
 at side shows such as boxing or bought
 items at the stalls.The Fairs dwindled
 and eventually stopped in 1977. Refer 
 also to page 20.
