		<content> St. Andrews attracts many visitors all
 year and as a result the weather is an
 important factor to take into         
 consideration. Being on the East      
 coast, summers are warm and winters   
 are cool. Rainfall is fairly          
 light,averaging 680mm/year, and is    
 evenly distributed all year. Hours of 
 sunshine, however, are not as high as 
 one might expect. One of the weather  
 phenomenon experienced in St. Andrews 
 is the East coast haar. Especially    
 after a warm sunny day, sea breezes   
 build up in the afternoon and the     
 colder air from the sea brings in a   
 sea fog which is decidely             
 chilling. Winter snowfall is very     
 slight and it is unusual to have snow 
 lying for any length of time.
