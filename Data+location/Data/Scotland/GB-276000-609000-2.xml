		<title>02An adults day</title>
		<content> Slumber shattered by the alarm at 7am.
 Walk the dog and collect daily papers 
 for breakfast reading, after which I  
 feed the dog. Now I check and water   
 the plants in the greenhouse, and then
 I wake the children. Its now 8am and I
 am at the office to open for the day's
 business. Check Workshop Lists for the
 day and order spare parts not in      
 stock. The mail is delivered and      
 opened, accounts paid by clients are  
 processed and banked with cash taken  
 during the morning. 12 noon and lunch.
 Afternoon is the time to check usage  
 of spare parts and petrol-pump sales. 
 There may be a Taxi Hire and a jaunt  
 out of the office. At 4pm the day's   
 work is over so I go home. An hour in 
 the garden before tea and then some   
 decorating afterwards. 10pm and the   
 dog has a walk before being kennelled.
 A quick supper and then off to bed.   </content>
