		<title>11HEALTH CARE ON RHUM</title>
		<content> The doctor comes to visit Rhum once a 
 month if the weather allows. He comes 
 from Eigg. He will only stay for one  
 night and in that time he sees        
 everyone on the island. If anyone's   
 ill and the doctor isn't on Rhum to   
 attend to them he is phoned up for    
 advice. If the illness is minor then  
 the doctor prescribes medicine stored 
 in the Chief Warden's office. If it is
 very serious then a helicopter is sent
 to take the patient to hospital in    
 Inverness. After any births a district
 nurse, based in Mallaig, may also     
 call.                                 
                                       
 The dentist comes from Fort William   
 twice a year. The castle has an       
 equipped dental surgery. Patients are 
 checked in the castle. Any treatment  
 required is given if possible.
