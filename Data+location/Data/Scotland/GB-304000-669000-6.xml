		<title>06LIVINGSTON - MOTORWAY ACCESS</title>
		<content>   The M8 motorway passes to the north 
 of the town close to Deans and Houston
 Industrial Estates. From there it is a
 distance of approximately 25          
 kilometres to Edinburgh and 18        
 kilometres to Edinburgh Airport.      
 Glasgow is about 50 kilometres to the 
 west. These cities can be reached     
 quickly from Livingston - Glasgow     
 with its airport in less than an hour 
 and Edinburgh in around 30 minutes.   
   This easy access makes the town     
 attractive to a variety of industries 
 as the motorway means that raw        
 materials and manufactured goods can  
 be moved quickly.                     
   The motorways and road links also   
 help to attract people to the town    
 both to live and to work. Some people 
 live and work in Livingston but many  
 who live in Livingston work in        
 Edinburgh or Glasgow.                 </content>
