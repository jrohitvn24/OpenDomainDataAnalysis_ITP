           {GALA WEEK}                 
    June 1st-June 7th is one of the    
 busiest weeks of the year in West     
 Kilbride. It is because it is Gala    
 Week. The people of the village pick  
 the Gala Queen. Activities range from 
 discos to shows and trips to bonfires.
 Money is also raised for local        
 charities.
