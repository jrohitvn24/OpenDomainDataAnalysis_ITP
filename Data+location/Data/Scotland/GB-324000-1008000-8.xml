		<title>08OATCAKE FACTORY</title>
		<content> This local business is owned by the   
 Stockan family who moved to new       
 expanded premises in 1982.The family  
 work and employ 16 local people to    
 make ther traditional shape of oatcake
 _ a quarter circle.                   
 To make the oatcakes they need        
 oatmeal,flour,veg.fat,salt and        
 sugar,raising agents which all get    
 mixed together and baked at a moderate
 heat .All the ingredients are imported
 .Of the half million oatcakes produced
 each week many are exported to small  
 stores in Aberdeen and Inverness or   
 even to Dumfries ,although the company
 does not advertise.Despite high       
 freight charges ,Mr Stockan sells 36  
 packets for Â£5.30.He's up at 6.45 for 
 each busy day's work.It's worth it,for
 although not the most popular oatcake 
 in Britain,in Orkney more of them are 
 sold than rich tea biscuits.          </content>
