 The NTS are the main employer on the  
 island. They employ estate workers on 
 the farm, a handyman for maintenance  
 of properties and a NTS representative
 to look after visitors to the island. 
 They are also running an Oyster Farm  
 pilot scheme. The other 2 main        
 employers are the Education Authority 
 who employ a teacher and the Post     
 Office.                               
 (see next page for employment chart.) 
 There are other part time jobs such as
 telephone engineer, auxilary coast    
 guards, pier master, B&amp;B, lobster     
 fishing and collecting winkles by     
 which islanders supplement their      
 income. Some islanders have crofts and
 therefore can also supplement their   
 income by the sale of sheep and       
 cattle.
