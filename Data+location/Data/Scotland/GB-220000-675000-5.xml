		<content> The two main sources of employment for
 the inhabitants in the area are       
 shipbuilding and electronics.Over the 
 years the work force in the "Yards" As
 they are locally known has declined   
 drastically.Like all the other        
 Shipbuilders in the U.K. the Upper    
 Clyde Shipbulders have suffered from  
 the effects of a decline in World     
 Shipping.Their inability to compete   
 with the Shipbuilding Countries  in   
 the Far East for a share in a very    
 limited market has also been a major  
 factor in the decline.At present the  
 work force are building an Oil Rig but
 there are no orders on their Books and
 this could result in a complete       
 closure of the Yards.The huge         
 I.B.M.Complex contnues to thrive and  
 is by far the healthiest industry in  
 the area.
