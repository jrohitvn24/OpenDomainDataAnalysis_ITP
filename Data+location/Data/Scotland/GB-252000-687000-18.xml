		<content>    Usually my Mum comes into my room  
 to wake me up. I dress in my school   
 uniform which is brown trousers and a 
 yellow shirt with a striped tie. I go 
 downstairs into the kitchen where I   
 have{breakfast-}cereal with milk, and 
 toast and peanut butter and tea. When 
 I have combed my hair,brushed my teeth
 and packed my school-bag, I set off   
 for school with my brother. We go to  
 the lollipop lady who takes us across 
 the road. When the bell rings at nine 
 o'clock we go into our classes. We say
 The Lord's Prayer and{lessons}begin.  
 We have{playtime}at 10.30am, when the 
 boys play football or play Bulldog    
 or Line Tig. After the interval we    
 have Art till lunch-time at 12.15pm.  
 In the afternoon we have project and  
 poetry and after the interval we have 
 a chapter of our serial and prepare   
 homework. School finishes at 3.30pm.  </content>
