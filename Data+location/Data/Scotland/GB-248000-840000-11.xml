		<title>11EMPLOYMENT IN KILTARLITY</title>
		<content> The area is mainly agricultural and   
 most employment is farming            
 based,though some forestry related    
 work is carried out.An old sawmill in 
 the village was recently modernised   
 and now provides some local jobs.     
 Tourism also provides seasonal        
 employment for many local people.There
 are a number of building-related      
 businesses and a unique crafts company
 which exports hand painted pewter     
 miniature figures world wide.         
 There is a garden centre which        
 specialises in growing lilies for mail
 order.                                
 Many people in the area,however,do    
 travel to the larger centres of       
 population such as Inverness for      
 employment.Unemployment in the area is
 low compared with the Regional        
 average.                              
                                       </content>
