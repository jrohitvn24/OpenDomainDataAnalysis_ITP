		<content> In the eventide home there are 25     
 members of staff. 48 old people live  
 there altogether. 11 of them are men  
 and 37 are women. Most of the staff   
 have worked there for about 20 years. 
 In the house there are 11 single      
 bedrooms and 15 double bedrooms. There
 is also an annexe which has more      
 rooms. The old people each have a     
 bathroom in their bedroom. A year ago 
 23 members of staff worked there, and 
 there were only 45 old people living  
 there. the eventide home was built in 
 1937. It was a private house before it
 was an old folks home. Round about the
 eventide home there is a beautiful    
 wooded garden and a large lawn. The   
 school has  lots of visits to the     
 garden. The eventide home is owned by 
 the Church of Scotland.
