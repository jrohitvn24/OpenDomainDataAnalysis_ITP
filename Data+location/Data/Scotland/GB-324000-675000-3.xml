		<title>03RON BROWN MP</title>
		<content>{RON BROWN}who is the labour MP for    
 Leith, was elected in 1979 to Parlia- 
 :ment.  He doesn't think of himself as
 an important person, but as an every- 
 :day man who was fortunate enough to  
 be selected to be an MP.  Before go-  
 :ing to Westminster he worked as a    
 shop steward in Parsons Peebles.  He  
 was  once involved in a bad accident  
 and had to have skin grafts on his    
 face. He has two children who attend  
 Ainslie Park High School.             
 Ron Brown lives in a small flat in    
 Kensington when Parliament is sitting,
 but his main home is in Edinburgh.  As
 an MP he has travelled to many        
 countries, including Afghanistan and  
 Libya.  When asked if he would like to
 be Prime Minister he said if he were  
 chosen to be Prime Minister he would  
 accept - but he's happy as he is!
