		<content>                                       
 THE EAST MONKLANDS IS ESSENTIALLY A   
{MARGINAL FARMING}AREA. ITS ELEVATION  
 OF OVER 200 METRES MAKES IT RATHER    
 EXPOSED AND WET. MOST OF THE AREA HAS 
 A HEAVY CLAY SOIL WITH A LOW ORGANIC  
 CONTENT, WHILE TO THE NORTH EAST, THE 
 LAND IS BADLY DRAINED PEATY MOORLAND. 
 THERE ARE A FEW EXCEPTIONS OF         
 FREE-STONE SOIL WHICH USED TO BE      
 DEVOTED TO THE CULTIVATION OF POTATOES
 AND CEREALS. MOST OF THE FARMS IN THE 
 AREA ARE RELATIVELY SMALL AND IN THE  
 PAST WERE{SELF-SUFFICIENT MIXED FARMS}
 CONCENTRATING ON{DAIRY FARMING AND    
{POULTRY.}MOST OF THE MILK PRODUCED WAS
 TO MEET LOCAL DEMAND. SOME FARMS      
 CONCENTRATED ON THE GROWING OF HAY    
 E.G.DRUMSHANGIE FARM (777688) TO      
 SUPPLY THE HORSE POPULATION OF GLASGOW
 WHEN HORSE TRANSPORT WAS STILL AT A   
 PEAK.                                 </content>
