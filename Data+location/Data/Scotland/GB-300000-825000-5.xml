		<content>    Grantown contains a wide range of  
 house sizes and styles. Originally it 
 was an{18th Century planned town.}The 
 first houses were built around its    
{central Square.                       
    These were of stone with slate     
 roofs in contrast to the turf huts    
 common locally then.                  
    From then, Grantown has developed  
 through large Victorian villas to     
 modern bungalows and semi-detached    
 houses, both local authority and      
 private. These newer housing schemes  
 tend to be mostly on the outskirts.   
    The oldest housing is in the centre
 and, like Victorian villas, is of     
 stone. Newer housing is of concrete on
 a timber frame. An interesting        
 development of the 1980s is the       
 modernisation of old 18th and 19th    
 Century properties in the centre of   
 the town.                             </content>
