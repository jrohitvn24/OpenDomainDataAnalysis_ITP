		<title>17LEISURE IN PETERHEAD</title>
		<content> There are over thirty clubs and       
 activities which take place in the    
 community centre during the week and  
 at weekends.They range from ladies    
 keep fit,table tennis and gymnastics  
 to carpet bowls,workers education     
 association and machine knitting.     
 The centre also has clubs for disabled
 people such as the Disabled group     
 which takes place once weekly and the 
 Blind group.The swimming pool is      
 regulary used by schools in and around
 Peterhead and by the public.There are 
 also swimming clubs such as Sub Aqua  
 and the "Water Babies."Vandalism in   
 the centre is very high.The front of  
 the centre and the coffee bar are     
 frequently being repainted because of 
 graffitti written by marker pens,     
 tip-ex and spray paint.Some people we 
 asked thought the centre could be     
 improved.                             </content>
