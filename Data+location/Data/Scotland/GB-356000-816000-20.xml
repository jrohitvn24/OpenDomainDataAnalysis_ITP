		<content> In 1983 Malcolm Bruce was elected     
 Liberal MP for the Gordon constituency
 The MEP for NE Scotland is Ian Provan,
 a Tory. We have elected represent-    
 atives on Grampian Regional Council   
 and Gordon District Council. Closer to
 the grass roots each parish is        
 represented on Donside Community      
 Council, which keeps the Regional and 
 District Councillors in touch with    
 local concerns.Alford College Council 
 is a locally elected body whose role  
 is to make the Education Committee of 
 the Region aware of the views of the  
 locality on education matters. The    
 Water and Roads depots for the area   
 are in Alford as is the Council's     
 local office which is the base for the
 Registrar, Community  Education,      
 Social worker, etc.
