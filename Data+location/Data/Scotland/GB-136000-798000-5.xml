		<content> On the island of Rhum there are 20    
 highland ponies.There is also a       
 stallion called Mac.                  
                                       
 In the winter the ponies are fed both 
 in the morning and at night. During   
 the summer they graze.                
                                       
 They are used for carrying culled     
 deer. Several of the ponies are broken
 in for riding. The island children and
 adults are allowed to ride them. The  
 newest foal ,Sarah, was born on 7th   
 May 1985. The oldest pony, Mary (aged 
 21), gave birth to her.               
                                       
 Some of the ponies are sold on the    
 mainland.                             
                                       
 On several occasions the ponies have  
 been used for mountain rescues.
