		<title>17To Bypass or not to Bypass!</title>
		<content>{That is the question!                 
                                       
 Hillend is a small village, northeast 
 of Inverkeithing. It lies on the main{
{A92}road, a vital contact between east
 and west Fife. As a result, heavy     
 traffic is constantly travelling along
 the small main street of Hillend. A   
 vigourous campaign is underway by the 
 inhabitants to have a bypass          
 constructed.                          
                                       
 A protest is carried out regularly    
 with citizens standing at (and        
 crossing often) the pedestrian        
 crossing, with banners stating 'Go    
 slow!' and 'Keep to the speed limit'. 
 This results in very annoyed drivers  
 in a two-mile tailback, but has       
 seemingly not had much success in the 
 intended area.
