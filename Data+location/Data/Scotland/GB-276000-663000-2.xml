		<content> THE LOCAL JOB CENTRE IN GRAHAM STREET 
 INFORMS US THAT JOB DEPENDANCY IN     
 AIRDRIE AT THE MOMENT IS CENTRED      
 MAINLY ON INDUSTRIES RELATED TO METAL 
 ELECTRONICS AND PHARMACEUTICALS. THERE
 ARE FEW AGRICULTURAL WORKERS AS MOST  
 OF THE FARMLAND HAS BECOME ERODED.    
 THERE SHOULD BE POSSIBLE GROWTH IN THE
 FUTURE IN INDUSTRIES RELATED TO THHE  
 MANUFACTURE OF BOTH MECHANICAL AND    
 ELECTRICAL/ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS. THE 
 OLD INDUSTRIES OF THE AREA SUCH AS    
 IRON AND AND STEEL AND WHISKEY        
 DISTILLING, HAVE BEEN BADLY HIT HERE  
 AS ELSEWHERE ALONG WITH THOSE         
 DEPENDENT APON THEM LIKE MALTINGS AND 
 DISTRIBUTION CENTRES. THE DECLINE IN  
 THE BRITISH STEEL CORPORATION HAS     
 CAUSED A"KNOCK ON SYNDROM" WHICH HHAS 
 AFFECTED LOCAL "NUTS AND BOLTS"       
 PRODUCERS.                            
                                       </content>
