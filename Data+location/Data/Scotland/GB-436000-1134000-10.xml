		<title>10CROFTING</title>
		<content> THERE ARE MANY CROFTS IN SHETLAND.ONLY
  A CROFTER KNOWS HOW MANY HOURS ARE   
 PUT INTO IT. BEFORE NOW,EVERY FAMILY  
 OWNED A CROFT BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY 
 WAY THEY COULD GET MEAT,VEGETABLES    
 ETC. THEY KEPT LOTS OF ANIMALS AND    
 GREW LOTS OF VEGETABLES. TODAY WE     
 HAVE MACHINERY TO WORK WITH,LIKE      
 TRACTORS AND PLOUGHS. BUT, IN THE     
 OLDEN DAYS THEY ONLY HAD HORSES TO    
 PLOUGH. WE ALSO HAVE THINGS LIKE      
 COMBINE HARVESTERS AND CORNCUTTERS BUT
 THEY ONLY USED SYTHES TO CUT THE GRASS
 ETC. THE FAMILIES ALSO HAD TO MAKE    
 THEIR OWN FLOUR ,SO FIRST THEY CUT THE
 BY HAND,PUT IT INTO A HAND THRESHER,  
 GROUND IT ON BIG STONES IN A MILL AND 
 THEN IT WAS READY TO MAKE BREAD WITH. 
 LIVING  ON A CROFT THEN WAS HARDER    
 WORK THAN TO LIVE ON ONE NOW.
