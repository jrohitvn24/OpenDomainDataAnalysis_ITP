		<title>13Care for the elderly</title>
		<content> Sanquhar is a close knit community    
 which cares for its elderly. A block  
 of 9 Sheltered houses with resident   
 warden has been provided by the       
 District Council. The health board    
 supervises health visitors, a nightly 
 "bedding" service and a geriatric     
 hospital and day centre 12 miles south
 of town. The Social Work department   
 organises meals-on-wheels (21 daily), 
 employs home-helps for 64 persons and 
 runs an Old Folks' home 12 miles away.
 This department provides occupational 
 therapy and aids for the elderly, as  
 well as special support for the blind 
 and deaf. Local people have organised 
 a Pensioners' Club, a Luncheon Club   
 and a Friends &amp; Neighbours Club, and  
 there are branches of WRVS, ARC and   
 Crossroads (Care Attendant Scheme).   
 Recently a "Wheels Appeal" provided a 
 mini-bus for the aged and disabled.   </content>
