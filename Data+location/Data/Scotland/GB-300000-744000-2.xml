		<content>  centre there are no way marked paths 
 through the woods, and members of the 
 public are only allowed to drive up   
 the rough road to Mill Dam if they    
 have purchased a license to fish for  
 trout in season.   Pulney Loch may    
 also be fished by permit.   The woods 
 are actively managed and there is a   
 small sawmill on the old main road    
 with of the village.   There are only 
 a handfull of houses away from the    
 road, mostly used by tenant farmers or
 estate workers such as the gamekeeper 
 at Bikerburn, who culls the roe deer, 
 which are hard to spot beneath the    
 bracken in summer until you get up    
 wind of them, and they start to jump. 
 A few red deer come ffrom further     
 north in winter.
