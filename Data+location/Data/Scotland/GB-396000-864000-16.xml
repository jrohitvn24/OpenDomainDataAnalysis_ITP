		<title>16The Climate of Fraserburgh</title>
		<content>   Despite its apparently exposed      
 location at the extreme north-easterly
 tip of the Buchan area, Fraserburgh   
 clearly benefits from its proximity to
 the Moray Firth with its relatively   
 mild climate.                         
   The sea air prevents snow from lying
 for long in winter and the annual     
 average temperature is high enough to 
 let farmers harvest their barley up to
 two weeks ahead of the people of      
 central Buchan, just 20 miles inland  
 but a few hundred feet above          
 sea-level.                            
   The summer sees holiday-makers      
 enjoying the sand and sea at          
 Fraserburgh Bay whilst staying at the 
 Links caravan site or at a boarding   
 house or hotel. The waves at the beach
 are often of such size as to provide  
 good surfing conditions.
