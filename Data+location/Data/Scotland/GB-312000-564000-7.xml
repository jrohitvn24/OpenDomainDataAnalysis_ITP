		<content>  This subject gives you a few facts   
 and figures on what goes on in farming
 around this area.                     
                                       
 CROPS                                 
   The main kinds of crops that farmers
 plant are grass and barley.  You could
 call hay and silage grass in some ways
 because  they both start off as grass.
 Wheat,turnips and potatoes are also   
 quite common.Lots of people have      
 turnips to keep their sheep on,quite a
 lot of people have potatoes and sell  
 some of them.                         
 Carrots are not really all that common
 but some people do grow them.  Out of 
 all the farmers that we surveyed,40%  
 of them used  all their crops at home,
 20% sent them all away,and 40% did    
 both.
