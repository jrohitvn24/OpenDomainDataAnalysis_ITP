		<title>12LONGFORGAN - HOUSING -</title>
		<content> Housing in Longforgan is typified by  
 the single storey cottages which line 
 the former Dundee-Perth turnpike road.
 These cottages were built of sandstone
 with timber raftered roofs which were 
 originally turfed or thatched, but are
 nowadays slated, although two examples
 still exist today on the north side of
 the village street. Usually the stone 
 walls were whitewashed and internally 
 were of two rooms and date back to the
 18th century. In the 19th century some
 large stone built villas were built,  
 for example, the Croft (1895) with its
 large stone chimneys, diamond paned   
 glass and receding roofs on each      
 storey. To the southwest of the       
 village is Castle Huntly, built in the
 mid 18th century in the style of an   
 L-shaped tower house, and also Rossie 
 Priory which is an example of building
 in the neo-Gothic house style.        </content>
