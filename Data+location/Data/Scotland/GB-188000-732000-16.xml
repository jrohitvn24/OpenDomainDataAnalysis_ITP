		<content> While there are many old houses built 
 mainly of granite there are also      
 modern homes.While many of the houses 
 are privately owned there are also    
 council houses. There are around 253  
 houses in the area,some of which are  
 bungalows while others are of the     
 villa type.While the council houses   
 are semi_detached most of the private 
 houses are detached.A private housing 
 development of luxury type homes is   
 going ahead on the south side of      
 Connel Bridge.In North Connel there is
 a modern private housing development  
 on one side of the Loch Nell Arms     
 Hotel while on the other side is a    
 council estate.
