		<title>17PEAT CUTTING IN BACK</title>
		<content>{GENERAL DESCRIPTION                   
 Peat is the decayed remains of        
 moorland vegetation. When cut and     
 dried correctly it makes an excellent 
 domestic fuel.It ranges in colour from
 brown to black,the black peat having a
 calorific value equal to that of coal.
{METHOD OF CUTTING }                   
 The turf is skinned away from the moor
 with a spade and the peats are cut    
 with a {TARAISGEAR}or peat iron. They 
 are laid out to dry and collected into
 piles as they dry out. When ready they
 are taken home by tractor. Cutting    
 usually starts in April, and depending
 on weather, they are home by July.    
{NEW METHODS                           
 The new method of cutting peats is    
 with a machine which cuts the peats   
 into a cylinder shape. {
