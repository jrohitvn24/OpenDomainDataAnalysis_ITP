		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SUSAN</title>
		<content> My name is Susan and I am twelve years
 old. I attend Dolphinton Primary      
 School. There are fourteen pupils in  
 the school - 9 boys and 5 girls. We   
 have two teachers. I attend the school
 from 9am to 3.30pm. Today it is the   
 Carluke Upperward Sports, and I am    
 entered for three events - the 100m,  
 200m and the standing longjump. the   
 competitors from our school are all   
 dressed in black tracksuits with red  
 stripes, which is the school colours. 
 We went to Carluke by bus, and when we
 got there we were joined by other     
 small schools. I won my three events, 
 breaking the record for the standing  
 longjump by 2cm by jumping a distance 
 of 197cm.  After we got home I had tea
 then went for a ride on my bicycle.   
 Later I went to the hall to play      
 badminton which I enjoy very much. I  
 had my bath and went upstairs to bed. </content>
