		<content>{Stoat                                 
  The stoat is about 12 inches long    
 with a 4 inch tail.It is brown in the 
 summer but is white in the winter.    
 which allows it to catch its food more
 easily.The tip of its tail remains    
 black.                                
  They feed on small mammals like      
 voles,shrews,mice and some times baby 
 rabbits.They have been seen on the    
 moor and at Inverarnie.               
{Fox                                   
  The fox eats rabbits,hares,grouse and
 lots of other game.                   
  They are quite hard to spot because  
 they stay under cover in the day and  
 come out to hunt in the night.        
  The parents dig a hole in the ground 
 where the female has her cubs.        
  The home they have is called a den.  
  Two of our boys have been with a game
 keeper to hunt a fox.                 </content>
