		<title>15No Leisure Centre</title>
		<content> Brechin chances of getting a Leisure  
 Centre are zero at present, Mr William
 Robertson, chairman of the Community  
 Council, told last night's Meeting.   
   Members studied a letter from Mr    
 Kenneth Dron Rector of the High       
 School, on behalf of the School       
 Council, suggesting that if there     
 could not be purpose built Centre the 
 School' P.E. block could be converted 
 into a self contained Community Block,
 of which the school would have        
 generous use during term time.        
   One of the facilities which should  
 be provided the Community Council     
 felt is a swimming pool.The High      
 School pool, it was suggested, is not 
 only used to capacity, but is too     
 small.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
