		<content>   At school we all go swimming every  
 week in Stirling. After school some   
 people visit the new leisure pool in  
 Falkirk, shortly to be officially     
 opened by the Queen. Our teacher      
 sometimes takes us to the dry ski     
 slope at Polmont. Many of us enjoy    
 horse riding. In the villages of Plean
 and Cowie there are amateur football  
 teams. The older men keep racing      
 pigeons and have contests.            
   The West Plean and Auchenbowie      
 Women's Club is still going strong    
 after 60 years. The club meets        
 fortnightly and has guest speakers,   
 various demonstratons and whist       
 drives. Teenagers in this area join   
 the Young Farmers Club.
