		<title>17HOWNAM HALL:A SOCIAL CENTRE</title>
		<content> The hall at Hownam,in Scotland,is like
 many others in the borders;a redundant
 village school,now put to good use by 
 the local community.It was last used  
 to educate in the 1940's,with rolls up
 to 20.It lies at the end of the street
 detached and somewhat forlorn looking,
 a one roomed building with bare boards
 and high windows, but what fun goes on
 within it's walls in the 1980's. It   
 hosts the S.W.R.I. and the indoor bowl
 -ing club regularly throughout the    
 darker evenings;sees children parties 
 whist drives;domino tournaments,and   
 sales of work spread over the years.It
 is used for polling at General        
 Elections,and was used as a base for  
 the mountain rescue squad. Apart from 
 a small grant it is entirely funded by
 local events. Everyone who lives in   
 the area uses   it at least once,and  
 many up to 35 times in the year.      </content>
