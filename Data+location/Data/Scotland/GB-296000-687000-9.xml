		<content> A quarter of our area is under        
 forest.The Devilla Forest belongs to  
 the Forestry Commission. The whole    
 area of forest is under conifers. They
 are mainly Sitka Spruce with some     
 Lodge Pole Pine and Larch. The forest 
 was planted in 1923. When felled the  
 trees from this area are supplied to a
 company called Cable Board. This      
 company is outside Stirling at        
 Cowie.Cable Board use the wood from   
 the forest mainly for chip-board and  
 conti-board. Some Noble Fir and Norway
 Spruce are grown but these are purely 
 for selling as Christmas Trees.       
{9.6.hectares are under heath land and 
{nursery.
