		<title>17Saugh Hill-Uses of plants</title>
		<content>   Many of the plants growing on the   
 Saugh Hill were widely used in the    
 past.                                 
  {Softbrush}is a grass with long stems
 which were used as wicks for oil lamps
 in the days before electricity.       
 Another grass,{heathbed straw},was    
 often put in mattresses and was said  
 to be very comfortable to lie on! It  
 also smelt like mown hay when dried   
 which would have been a pleasant smell
 in old houses.                        
   Several plants were medicinal. For  
 example{heath speedwell}was used as a 
 tonic,{tormentil}soothed aches and    
 pains and{sphagnum moss}was used as a 
 dressing for wounds ( and by Eskimos  
 for nappies! ).                       
   There are also some edible plants   
 including{sorrel, bilberries and      
{milkwort}which curdles milk.
