		<content>{Camperdown Wildlife Centre}has many   
 reasons to be proud of its            
 achievements.  Peraps the proudest    
 moment came when the Centre became the
 first place to hatch a Golden eagle in
 captivity.  They are also very proud  
 of their Brown Bear, Jeremy. Jeremy is
 a twenty year old female (yes, female)
 who became famous as the Sugar Puffs  
 bear in adverts on television some    
 years ago.  She also eats dead guinea 
 pigs!!                                
 Mr Reid, the Ranger in charge of the  
 Centre, gets very angry at the way    
 some "fools" mistreat our wildlife,   
 smashing eggs and so on,and sees his  
 job as helping people to understand   
 more about our wildlife.  He also     
 wants to help people to take a more   
 responsible attitude towards animals. 
 We agree with him.
