		<title>07The Lightkeepers</title>
		<content> The only people living on Inchkeith   
 today are the lightkeepers. There are 
 at present three lightkeepers on      
 Inchkeith, a Principal and two        
 Assistants. The families of the       
 lightkeepers no longer live on the    
 island but are housed in Edinburgh.   
 They can, however visit quite often,  
 coming out on the supply boat or pilot
 boat. The men are keep busy           
 practically 24hours a day. During the 
 day cleaning and maintenance is done  
 and a watch is kept for fog. At night 
 there are shifts for keeping a watch  
 on the light, this is made easier by a
 mirror which has been strategically   
 placed in the drying green at the rear
 of the living quarters, which are now 
 in a separate building from the       
 lighthouse. This enables the keeper on
 watch to keep an eye on the light     
 simply by glancing out of the window. </content>
