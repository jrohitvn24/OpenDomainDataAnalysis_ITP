		<title>14Rogart - Farming (Crofting)</title>
		<content>  Crofting is hard but enjoyable work. 
 Mr Macdonald has 15ha. of rough       
 grazing and 8ha. of arable land. On   
 this land, he keeps cows and sheep. He
 has his own rams but hires a bull from
 the Department of Agriculture and     
 Fisheries for Scotland.               
  Daily, Mr Macdonald has to care for  
 his animals. In spring and summer, he 
 has to cultivate his land. July is the
 busiest month. Then he has to clip and
 dip his sheep, gather in his peats and
 gather in his hay.                    
  All Mr Macdonald's family help him on
 the croft. Even though he is so busy  
 on the croft, he has a full-time job  
 as well. Mr Macdonald is one of the   
 local postmen.
