		<title>05The Church in Strathmiglo</title>
		<content> The parish church of Strathmiglo was  
 built in 1784 and is situated at the  
 east end of the village.It replaced an
 earlier church dedicated to St.Martin.
 In early writings Strathmiglo was     
 referred to as "Eglismartin" meaning  
 "Church of St.Martin".Above the       
 porch of the church is a stone with   
 the inscription ,"Jesus Christ is the 
 door and he that enters in be him shal
 be saved. John 10 9 1647".The stone is
 all that remains of the original      
 church.The church has a membership of 
 about 350.A service is held every     
 Sunday.A Sunday School is held for    
 children up to 12 years old.Children  
 over 12 can go to Sunday at Six where 
 topics of general interest are        
 discussed.The grave yard is divided   
 into 2 parts,old and new.The oldest   
 grave is dated 1681.There is also a   
 Free Church of Strathmiglo.           </content>
