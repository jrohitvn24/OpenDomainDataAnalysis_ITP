 In 1883 there was a bowling club      
 formed.It is in the Links near        
 the Rope Walk.It is called Seafield   
 Bowling Club.It was really opened in  
 1884 on the 9th of May.We spoke to the
 club secretary who had been there for 
 thirty years and lived nearby. He said
 that it cost 30 Pounds for under 65yrs
 old and for over 65 it cost 20 Pounds.
 It cost 10 Pounds for non competitors.
 I asked how many members they had. He 
 told me that there were 136 members.  
 The green is made from natural grass  
 and is used for club and national     
 tournaments. The club also takes part 
 in district competitions.             
 The members use wooden, Henselite and 
 Tynolite Bowls.
