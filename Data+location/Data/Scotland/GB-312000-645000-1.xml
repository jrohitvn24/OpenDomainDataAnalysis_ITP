		<content> OUR COUNTRSIDE HAS A GENTLE BEAUTY:   
 SOFTLY ROLLING HILLS, A SMALL         
 MEANDERING RIVER, QUIET SIDE-ROADS AND
 ONE BUSY HIGHWAY, THE A701, LINKING   
 THE HAMLETS OF ROMANNO BRIDGE AND     
 BLYTH BRIDGE, AS IT RUNS FROM         
 EDINBURGH TO MOFFAT.                  
 ON EITHER SIDE LIE FIELDS GRAZED BY   
 CATTLE OR SHEEP OR PRODUCING FODDER.  
 THE FARMS ARE WELL ESTABLISHED AND ONE
 IS A FARMING RESEARCH STATION.        
 THERE ARE TRACES OF ROMAN AND         
 PRE-ROMAN SETTLEMENTS AND OLD DROVE   
 ROADS. THERE ARE LEGENDS OF DISPUTING 
 MONKS AND WARRING GYPSIES. THE RAILWAY
 CAME AND WENT AS DID WAR-TIME         
 EVACUEES.                             
 NOW OUR CHURCHS AND SCHOOLS HAVE      
 AMALGAMATED. MANY PEOPLE TRAVEL TO    
 WORK IN EDINBURGH BUT ENJOY LIVING IN 
 THIS HAPPY RURAL COMMUNITY.
