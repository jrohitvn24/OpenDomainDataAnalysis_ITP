		<title>08TRAFFIC ON THE ROADS</title>
		<content> "Over the past fifty years I have seen
 a great deal of changes in{Crathes.}  
 One of the biggest changes is the     
 amount of trafficon the roads,{       
{Banchory}and{Aboyne}being commuter    
 villages for{Aberdeen.}The result is  
 that the main road is extremely busy  
 especially around{8am}and{6pm.        
 The road is now the only way to travel
 since the railway was closed by{Dr.   
{Beeching}over 20 years ago. The trains
 used to carry the mail and papers from
{Aberdeen,}however these now come by   
 van.                                  
 When I was young the castle was owned 
 by the{Burnetts}of{Leys}who employed  
 many servants _ a chauffeur, butler,  
 footman, lady's maid, nanny, keeper,  
 cook, 2 kitchen maids and 3 gardeners,
 plus lots of farm workers. Nowadays   
 the castle is owned by the {NTS}who   
 employ just 12 people."               </content>
