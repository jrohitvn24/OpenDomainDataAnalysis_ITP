 DEANSTON VILLAGE                      
 Housing here consists of tenement type
 buildings along the main street which 
 was the original village. The stone   
 facades have been retained while the  
 interiors have been renovated to      
 provide modern accommodation.         
 Newer Council built semi-detached     
 houses overlook the old village.      
                                       
 RURAL AREA                            
 Privately owned houses are of bungalow
 or villa type. Farmhouses and cottages
 have kept their originality outwardly 
 but most have been added to and       
 modernised.
