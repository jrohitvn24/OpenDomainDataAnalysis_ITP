		<title>11FARMING THE CARTVALE</title>
		<content>  The valley of the Cart is{undulating 
{land}broken by small hedge or tree    
 lined fields.Clay soils produce a good
 grass for{dairy farming.              
  The largest farm in the area is      
 Flenders Farm run by the Miller       
 family.The farm is 240 acres with 24  
 acres of silage,60 of hay,35 of barley
 and the rest is grass.Flenders is a   
 dairy farm with 210 cattle including  
 calves.The farmer gets 16.72p per     
 litre for the milk.He uses many labour
 saving machines for milking,ploughing,
 muck spreading and combining.He sells 
 his produce at{Paisley market.        
 Mr.Millar feels that{E.E.C. membership
 has led to lower prices and quotas for
 milk.In spite of this he feels farming
 will continue in his family.The labour
 force consists of three family members
 and two others, all full-time and two 
 part-timers.                          </content>
