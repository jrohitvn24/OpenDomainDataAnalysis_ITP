		<content>     Kilsyth &amp; District Victoria       
 Memorial Cottage Hospital was built in
 1903 for the miners and their         
 families.                             
     After one terrible mining disaster
 there were so many casualties that    
 they were lined up on stretchers      
 outside.                              
     The first ambulance was bought    
 from money recieved when Mrs Margaret 
 Gentles left her entire estate(Â£580)  
 to the hospital.                      
    Although they used to perform      
 operations here they don't nowadays.  
 Most of the patients in the two wards 
 are old people suffering from cancer, 
 arthritis or strokes. Treatment was by
 drugs and physiotherapy.              
     The casualty department treats    
 minor injuries but seriously injured  
 people have to go to Stobhill         
 Hospital.                             </content>
