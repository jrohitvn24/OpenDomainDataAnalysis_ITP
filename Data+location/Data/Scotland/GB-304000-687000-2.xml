		<content>{HOW WE FELT IN THE FOREST             
 It was wet and damp in the forest     
 and all I could here was the sound of 
 birds,twigs snaping and slight        
 movement behind the trees. We felt the
 midges in our faces and hair. We kept 
 having to scratch ourselfs .We found  
 plucked feathers lying in a group and 
 cone that have been half eaten. Some  
 of the trees were swaying because it  
 looked like things were up in the     
 trees. We found paw prints that looked
 quite big. We thought they were foxes 
 paw prints. It looked liked everything
 was watching us. Quite a lot of small 
 feathers were lying on the ground next
 to the path. The ground was covered   
 with gnawed wood and roots. We  walked
 down to the small stream to see if    
 there was any fish.
