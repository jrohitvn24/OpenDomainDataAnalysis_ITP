		<title>17THE CUMBERNAULD DOVECOTE</title>
		<content> Near the east gate to the park of     
 Cumbernauld House, there is the site  
 of a stone-walled fruit and vegetable 
 garden built in typical Scottish      
 style. The walls have since been      
 pulled down and the site landscaped,  
 so there is little left of the        
 original garden today.It has been     
 replaced by another one nearer the    
 house. There is a traditional dovecote
 (pronounced "doocot") in the          
 south-east corner of the old garden.  
 It takes the form of a tall           
 stone-built tower with a conical roof 
 of the pepper-pot type (common in 16th
 century Scottish architecture). It was
 used for storage and was entered from 
 the garden. Sometimes pigeons had     
 there nests in the dovecote.
