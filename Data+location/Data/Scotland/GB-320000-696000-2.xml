		<content> The landscape of the area is          
 characterised by two{river valleys}   
 which are separated by a{ridge of low}
{hills.}The trend of the landscape is  
 from the west to the east. The        
 northern-most of the two valleys      
 contains the{Lochty Burn,}a tributary 
 of the{River Ore,}which flows in the  
 southern-most valley. The{valley   }  
{floors}are relatively flat and average
 in height about{76 metres}above sea   
 level. The ridge of hills which lies  
 between the two valleys rises up to a 
 height of{138 metres at Ballfield}    
{Plantation.}The north facing slope of 
 this ridge is gently sloping but the  
 south facing slope overlooking the    
 valley of the River Ore falls away    
 very rapidly in a series of crags     
 which are most marked at Balgreggie   
 and at Auchterderran.
