		<content> Torphichen, which means Hill of the   
 Ravens, is a small village with a     
 population of about 600 people. The   
 village is a conservation area and is 
 almost equidistant from Glasgow,      
 Edinburgh and Stirling. Regular bus   
 services link up with the neighbouring
 towns of Bathgate and Falkirk and the 
 railway network from the station in   
 Linlithgow. The land around Torphichen
 is mainly farmland, much of it lying  
 200 metres or more above sea level. As
 a result most farms are hill and      
 upland with some stock and arable. The
 only large forrested area, of just    
 over 2 square kilometres, is in       
 Beecraigs Country Park which is owned 
 by West Lothian District Council. The 
 park, set in the Bathgate Hills, is   
 open to the public and offers         
 facilities for many outdoor           
 activities.                           </content>
