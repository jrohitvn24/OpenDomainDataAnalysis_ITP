		<content> There are many small businesses       
 (see employment) During early 1985 a  
 new supermarket at Scotstoun near the 
 M9. it was a controversial issue.There
 is no large store at present in       
 S.Queensferry.At public meetings local
 people welcomed competitive prices and
 greater varieties of goods without    
 having to travel into large towns.    
 There would be employment for 300     
 people in the store,garden            
 centre,bowling alley etc which was    
 planned.14 local shop keepers were    
 interviewed.8 were against and 6 were 
 for the supermarket.Those against felt
 that the rural landscape would be     
 spoiled.They also feared that loss of 
 trade would mean the inability to pay 
 the new high increase in rates.
