		<title>15A Schoolboy's Day</title>
		<content> I am a schoolboy aged eleven years. A 
 typical day in my life would be as    
 follows.I get up at 7.00 a.m., get    
 washed, dressed and have my breakfast 
 of cornflakes, toast and tea.I am     
 finished by 8.00 a.m. and watch T.V   
 until 8.35 a.m. then I go for the bus 
 which takes the children who live in  
 the housing scheme to school.  We get 
 off the bus where a Lollipop Lady puts
 us safely across the road. When I get 
 to school I talk to my friends until  
 the bell rings. We go into the        
 classroom and do a selection of work  
 like English and Writing and          
 Mathematics. We have a playtime at    
 10.40 a.m. and lunch at 12.30 p.m. At 
 lunchtime I play with my friends in   
 the playground. We finish school at   
 3.30p.m. I watch T.V. at night after I
 do my homework. I go to bed at 10     
 o'clock.                              </content>
