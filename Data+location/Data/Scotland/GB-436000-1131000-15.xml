 PUPILS.IT  LAY EMPTY FOR A NUMBER OF  
 YEARS AND THE COMMUNITY COUNCIL HAD   
 THE IDEA TO TURN IT INTO AN OUTDOOR   
 CENTRE.THE SCHOOL COUNCIL WANTED IT   
 FOR TEACHERS HOUSING.EVENTUALLY THE   
 COMMUNITY COUNCIL GOT THE LEASE OF IT 
 FROM THE EDUCATION COMMITEE FOR A FEW 
 YEARS AND IN COOPERATION WITH SHETLAND
 ASSOCIATION OF YOUTH CLUBS IT BECAME  
 A TEMPORARY OUTDOOR CENTRE. NO MONEY  
 WAS AVAILABLE AS IT WAS A TEMPORARY   
 LEASE SO IT WAS DONE UP ON A TIGHT    
 BUDGET WITH VOLUNTEERS PAINTING IT AND
 FURNITURE WAS ACQUIRED FROM THE CAMPS 
 AT SULLOM VOE. AN INDOOR TOILET WAS   
 PUT IN AND IT NOW HAS SIX CANOES
