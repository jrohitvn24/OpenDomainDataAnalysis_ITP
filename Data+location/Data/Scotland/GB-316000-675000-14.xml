		<title>14CRAMOND :Dunfermline College</title>
		<content> continued                             
 This year there are about 350 students
 at the College. They wear purple and  
 green professional clothes. First-year
 students have to live in College in   
 well-equipped single study bedrooms in
 the Tower Blocks whose names          
 perpetuate the time the College was in
 Aberdeen. The College was first built 
 in Dunfermline in the 1920s as a      
 Health College for men and women. The 
 Cramond buildings date from 1964.     
 There were draining problems on the   
 grounds so rafters had to be put under
 the building. The flat roofs and      
 the window frames are difficult to    
 maintain. There is a night security   
 guard so there is little vandalism but
 the public, especially young boys,    
 often try to use the playing fields.  
 The Scottish Education Board owns the 
 College.                              </content>
