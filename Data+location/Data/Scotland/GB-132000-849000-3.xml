		<title>03EDINBANE - GESTO HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> In 1869 Kenneth Macleod paid for the  
 building and equipping of Gesto       
 Hospital. He paid for a resident      
 doctor and nurse. At one time         
 operations were performed in this     
 little cottage hospital, but no longer
 for Gesto is now a geriatic hospital. 
 There are nineteen patients from all  
 over Skye. Most of the elderly        
 patients are able to be up for part of
 the day and spend their time in a     
 comfortable day-room. In addition to  
 resident staff, the doctor and a      
 physiotherapist care for the patients 
 on twice weekly visits. The           
 physiotherapist plays games with them 
 as well as helping them to exercise.  
 School children, guides, Portree choir
 and other groups enjoy visiting the   
 patients who are so cheerful and      
 friendly. They enjoy Gaelic programmes
 &amp; chatting with other Gaelic speakers.</content>
