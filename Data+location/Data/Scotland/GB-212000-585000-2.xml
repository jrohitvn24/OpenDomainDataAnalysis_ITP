		<title>02Employment in Colmonell</title>
		<content> The past hundred years has seen a     
 fundamental change in the employment  
 pattern in Colmonell.                 
 This major change has come about as a 
 result of improvements in agricultural
 methods and subsequent decline in     
 manpower requirements.Local farms and 
 estates employed large numbers of     
 laborours before the coming of        
 mechanisation,now they employ only a  
 few skilled men.                      
 Out of a total working population of  
 approximately 45 only 21 work in and  
 around the village.These include local
 council workers,shopkeepers and a     
 number of self employed tradesmen and 
 agricultural contractors.             
 The majority of workers who travel    
 outwith the village work in Girvan,a  
 distance of 12 miles away, or Ayr some
 35 miles distant.                     
                                       </content>
