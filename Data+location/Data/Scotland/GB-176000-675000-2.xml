		<content> Achahoish Church is situated on the   
 Ellary road. It is surrounded by trees
 and an old stone wall, and has a burn 
 flowing past it. It is part of the    
 parish of South Knapdale, founded in  
 1734, so it celebrated its 250th      
 anniversary in 1984 with a special    
 service.                              
 The church itself is small and made of
 stone with a slated roof. It has a    
 tower leading to a gallery inside the 
 church but this is now unsafe. Inside,
 the seating is on wooden benches. The 
 baptismal font came from St. Columba's
 Cave which is situated further along  
 the Ellary road. Extensive renovations
 took place in 1984, and public worship
 takes place there every second Sunday.
