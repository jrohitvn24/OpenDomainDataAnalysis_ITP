		<title>03THE ROAD TO LESWALT</title>
		<content> The main Stranaer road leads past the 
 large dairy farm of Auchneel with,    
 above, The Dindinnie Reservoir.  On   
 the right is the Craichmore Golf      
 Course, founded in 1902 and host to   
 many competitions.  The road arrives  
 at Craigencross roundabout, once the  
 property of the Knights of St. John.  
 The left hand branch leads to Smithy  
 Hill where once John Biggam, a local  
 worthy and Blacksmith, served the     
 needs fo the local farmers and cured  
 childern's ailments.  Straight on, the
 road passes, on the right, a former   
 R.A.F. coal depot and, on the left,   
 the wide stretches of Challoch        
 (Blacksmith) Farm, house and steadings
 of considerable age.  The village     
 church dates from 1828, the school    
 from 1873, and the old church yard    
 has the Agnew Vault, the principal    
 landowners.                           </content>
