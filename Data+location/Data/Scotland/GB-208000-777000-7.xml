		<title>07   Glen Laragain: Forestry 1</title>
		<content>{The Forest and its History}           
      In the late 1960s Glen Laragain  
 was acquired by the present owners,   
 West Highland Woodlands,from 'Lochiel'
 -local laird, Lord Lieutenant to Her  
 Majesty, and Chief of the clan        
 Cameron. Previously the hill was      
 marginal grazing for sheep and deer.  
      Glen Laragain as it is today is a
 large forest which covers 468 hectares
 and has a boundary fence approximately
 seven miles long. Within the forest   
 there are nearly one million trees    
 growing, which were planted between   
 1968 and 1969, mainly Sitka Spruce,   
 but some Lodgepole Pine and Larch too.
      To give access, and also in the  
 years to come to enable lorries into  
 the plantation to haul the timber out 
 to the sawmill, a network of          
 approximately four miles of roads have
 been built within the forest.         </content>
