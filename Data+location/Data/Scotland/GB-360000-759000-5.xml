		<content>    On Thursdays I always go down to my
 grandads with my mum to make his tea. 
 After a while we go home and have a   
 night in watching the T.V.            
    On Friday I somtimes go to guide   
 swimming. I enjoy guide swimming      
 because it is only 30 pence for 1     
 hour.                                 
    On Saturday I go to my dancing from
 11 o clock to 12.45 pm. After my      
 dancing I go up the street with my    
 friends or just play about.           
    On Sunday I just laze about all day
 watching T.V or I go out the back and 
 play .                                
    In the winter we go out to the top 
 of a hill with our sledges and whizz  
 down. We also throw snow balls and get
 dressed in thick clothes.             
    In the summer we go for picnics and
 play in the paddling pool in our      
 swimming costumes.                    </content>
