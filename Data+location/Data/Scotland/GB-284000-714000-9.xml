{St. James Episcopal Church} is close  
 by the village school and Parish Kirk.
 It was built in 1836 following a long 
 difficult period. After the 1745      
 rebellion, when the Episcopal Church  
 was known to support the Stuarts,     
 penal laws were passed forbidding     
 baptisms by it.There is an entry in   
 the register for 1750 recording the   
 baptism of a child under cover of     
 trees in the park of Lord Rollo of    
 Duncrub to prevent discovery, as this 
 put the minister in danger of         
 imprisonment. The church was visited  
 by {Queen Victoria} at a service in   
 1842. The present congregation is     
 small and is served by a Rector who   
 also has the charge of Crieff and     
 Comrie.It is a small but beautiful    
 church with some interesting memorial 
 plaques referring to the above.       </content>
