		<title>18Donibristle House</title>
		<content> The estate of{Donibristle}was given to
 Thomas Randolph,1st Earl of Moray by  
 Robert the Bruce as a reward for      
 capturing Edinburgh Castle.           
                                       
 The first building was ruined by fire 
 in{1592}when the Earl was murdered.It 
 was rebuilt in the 18th century.This  
 building was gutted by fire in{1858}  
 and demolished c.1912. The only part  
 to escape destruction were the        
 servants quarters.Of the surviving    
 buildings the most striking feature is
 the wrought iron screen between the   
 two wings.The west wing was damaged by
 fire in{1984.}                        
                                       
 Northwest of the house stands the     
 private chapel of the Morays.Now an   
 unsafe ruin,there are however{17 lead 
{coffins,}the last of which was buried 
 in 1895,in it's crypt.                </content>
