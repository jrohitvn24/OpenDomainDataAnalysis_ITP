		<title>16Language in Ballantrae.</title>
		<content> The accent is typical of the West of  
 Scotland though some vowel sounds are 
 broadened.Standard English is widely  
 spoken as the reduction and replace-  
 ment of traditional occupations have  
 caused the use of the vernacular to   
 diminish.Local population changes due 
 to movement and the introduction of   
 persons retiring from elsewhere also  
 affect the language used.The          
 vernacular is heard mainly among older
 residents, farmers using the jargon of
 their trade,but young people are heard
 using idiomatic words and phrases when
 in conversation among themselves.Radio
 and TV have affected children's speech
 as they are exposed to these from an  
 early age but Burns Federation School 
 Competitions for singing,reciting     
 Scots songs and poems keep alive the  
 knowledge of Ayrshire idioms.
