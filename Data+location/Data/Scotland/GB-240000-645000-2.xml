 The summer of 1985 has been the       
 wettest in the memory of even the     
 older members of the community.Farm   
 crops are still in the fields         
 unharvested and ground conditions are 
 extremely soft and wet.There have been
 few weeks when more than one day has  
 had no rain.The temperatures have     
 however been almost the normal        
 experienced in the area.The prevailing
 southwest winds have been mild,moist  
 and warm.Children at school have      
 rarely had the normal summer lessons  
 outdoors since the beginning of June. 
 The rivers in and around the town have
 many times this summer been brown     
 rushing torrents and the banks have   
 been flooded.The wet weather is still 
 continuing even now in the middle of  
 September.                            </content>
