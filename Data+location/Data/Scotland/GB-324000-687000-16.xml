		<content>{SEAFIELD TOWER :}The ruin of Seafield 
 Tower stands on the beach just south  
 of Kirkcaldy. It is a square tower    
 whose walls are 1.65 metres thick. It 
 had a wheel stair, and was surrounded 
 by a fosse moat. The tower was the    
 home of the Moultray family, the last 
 of whom was killed in 1715.           
{PITEADIE CASTLE :}The castle was a    
 square keep and dates from the mid    
 16th. century. It was the home of     
 William Calderwood of Piteadie, an    
 apothecary to the people of Edinburgh.
{STANDING STANES}: These 2 stones stand
 19ft. apart in a field to the north   
 of the Jawbanes Road. Their origin is 
 uncertain, but they may be graves or  
 the remains of a Druidical temple.    
 They are quadrilateral boulders,      
 facing due east-west, the one to the  
 east being of whinstone and the other 
 of a quartz grained material.         </content>
