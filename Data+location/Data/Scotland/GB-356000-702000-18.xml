		<content> Mr Michael Welch, our school violin   
 teacher has published a book about the
 history of the Anstruther Lifeboat    
 from 1865 to 1985 after 18 months'    
 research.  It costs Â£2.               
                                       
 A sponsored cycle from Anstruther to  
 St Andrews was held to mark 1985 as   
 International Youth Year.  It was     
 organised by Dr Barnardo's and the    
 RSPCC.  Eight members of the Youth    
 Club took part and some guest stars   
 from TV were involved.  Sgt Berwick   
 had enough energy left to cycle back  
 to Anstruther!                        
                                       
 The first Kilrenny and Anstruther     
 Community Council Children's Gala will
 take place on Wednesday 17th July.    
 There will be side-shows, races, a    
 picnic, majorettes, pony rides, pillow
 fights and a fancy dress competition. </content>
