		<content> A group for mothers and toddlers meet 
 in the Scout Hut on Thursday mornings.
 The group started in 1983 with only   
 two mothers. Now there are 24 mothers 
 and 27 children from 0-3yrs. old. The 
 aim is for mothers to meet and gain   
 support from other mothers, as they   
 discuss their problems in a relaxed   
 atmosphere. It is also good for the   
 children to play with others. It was  
 the first group of this kind in the   
 district. The children play with soft 
 toys, books,puzzles, push chairs etc. 
 Sometimes they go to the Swimming Pool
 at Camphill. Funds are raised by means
 of a workstall in Stonehaven square.  
 They have a Christmas Party, Easter-  
 get-together and Summer Picnic.
