 heating before going to work on a farm
 about 4 miles away.  Later, daughters 
 get ready for school, eldest one      
 catches the bus to St Andrews for     
 Secondary School, younger daughter    
 only has a few yards to go to Dunino  
 Primary School.  Mother checks School 
 as she is the caretaker.  At around 9 
 a.m. mother does the washing, tidies  
 the house and prepares the evening    
 meal.  At mid-day mother goes to serve
 the school meals.  In the afternoon,  
 mother takes the dog for a walk and   
 does some weeding in the garden.      
 Around 4p.m. daughters come home from 
 school.  Mother goes back to work at  
 the school.  Girls watch T.V. for a   
 while and play with the dog.  Father  
 arrives home from work about 5p.m.
