		<title>05VINTAGE TRACTORS IN SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>   We went to see Mr Harvey's farm. We 
 saw the Case LA which is an American  
 tractor and it was made in 1942. It   
 runs on petrol and paraffin and it    
 uses 40 gallons a day. It used to     
 belong to a man in Carlisle but Mr    
 Harvey bought it for a lot of money   
 (Â£650). It can only go at 14mph. It   
 has got no cab and you have to start  
 it by hand.                           
                                       
   Then we saw another tractor. It is  
 called a Field Marshall. It is a      
 British tractor and it was bought for 
 Â£1200 in 1950. Then Mr Harvey bought  
 it. It can pull 16 tons and it can    
 pull a caravan and other things. It   
 uses 3 gallons of diesel in a day. It 
 has got 8 forward and 2 reverse gears 
 and it can go at 9mph. It has a handle
 start and poor brake. You start it    
 with paper soaked in saltpetre.       </content>
