		<content> Four out of the five farms surveyed   
 kept a total of 247{BEEF CATTLE.}These
 are fattened for market in Dundee. One
 farm kept 50 breeding cows. The       
 largest farm kept 580{SHEEP}(240 ewes 
 and 340 lambs). The sheep are grazed  
 on upland pastures on the Sidlaw Hills
 in summer and wintered on the farm. A 
 few farms with fodder to spare keep   
 sheep only in winter. The sheep are   
 kept for both{MUTTON}and{WOOL.}       
 Horses and farm labourers have now    
 been replaced by machines. Four-furrow
 ploughs speed ploughing and combine   
 harvesters and grain driers shorten   
 harvest time. Potatoes are sown and   
 harvested by machine. The potato      
 harvester has a stone separator.      
 Silage is also collected and          
 maintained by machine. One farmer     
 remarked 'a good mechanic is now more 
 valuable than a horse on the farm'.   </content>
