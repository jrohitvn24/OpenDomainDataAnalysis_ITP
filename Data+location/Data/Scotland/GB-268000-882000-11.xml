		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE IN EDDERTON</title>
		<content> In the morning I wake up about 8.00   
 am.I go down stairs and get           
 dressed.After that I go and get my    
 breakfast which is usually a cereal.  
 I wash my self and brush my teeth.My  
 mam brushes my hair for me because l  
 cannot reach the back.After I get my  
 school bag packed.I go to see my      
 pony.Usually by the time I have fed   
 him the school bus has arrived.The    
 time is about 9.05 a.m,by the time we 
 pick up some other pupils the time    
 will be 9.20 a.m.I get out of school  
 at 3.40 p.m.About 20 minutes later the
 bus comes and takes me home.When I get
 home I run in the door and watch T.V  
 until supper.After supper I usually go
 up stairs to my bedroom and listen to 
 some music.Then I go out and ride my  
 pony until 8.00 p.m which is bed time 
 for me.I read a book and then I sleep.
