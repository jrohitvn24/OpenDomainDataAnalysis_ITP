 The sewage plant is a place were the  
 sewage from the loo goes.In the olden 
 days they used to throw it out of the 
 window and said,"GARDY LOO" and if you
 happened to be below you did not look 
 up.You see they did not have indoor   
 toilets so they had to do it in a     
 basin and threw it out the window     
 because the drains were in the        
 middle of the street. Nowadays you    
 just flush the toilet and thats       
 the end of it.Sometimes a big         
 sewage lorry comes and collects       
 it all in its tank its just like a    
 petrol tanker.And it takes it to the  
 sewage plant and they treat it so it  
 cant harm sea life. It is then pumped 
 onto a ship called the 'Gardy Loo',   
 and dumped out at the edge of the     
 North Sea.                            </content>
