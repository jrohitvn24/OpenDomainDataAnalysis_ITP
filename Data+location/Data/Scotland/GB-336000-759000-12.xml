 caught and small pens erected for     
 laying.Pheasant drives are improved by
 trimming trees and sowing gamecrop.   
    Egg laying starts in April.The eggs
 are put in incubators and hatch in 24 
 days.Gradually the{chicks}are moved   
 from heated to cooler pens until as 8 
 weeks old{pullets}they are released to
 larger pens in several woods and are  
 fed to keep them close-by.Shooting,by 
 paying guests,begins at the end of    
 November and continues until the      
 beginning of February when the whole  
 procedure starts again.

{game predators}are kept under control.
