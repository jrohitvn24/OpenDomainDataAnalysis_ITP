		<content>  {Linwood}and its surrounding area was
 once tree covered. Monks from{Paisley 
{Abbey}used some of the area as        
 farmland. The whole area eventually   
 became farmland with a few scattered  
 farm holdings. However, as the years  
 passed, the population grew with      
 people coming from the nearby small   
 town of{Inkerman}. Despite the fact   
 that the village had only two main    
 streets, its population continued to  
 grow. By the late 1960s a new car     
 factory was built and new housing had 
 to be built to house the incoming     
 workers. The increase in population   
 left Linwood short of amenities. This 
 was overcome by the building of a new 
 library, community centre, shopping   
 centre and sports complex. However, in
 1982 disaster struck when the car     
 factory closed, making 3000 people    
 unemployed.                           </content>
