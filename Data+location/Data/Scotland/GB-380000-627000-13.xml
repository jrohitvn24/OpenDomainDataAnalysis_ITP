		<title>13Yetholm Farms</title>
		<content> The hill country, covered with lush   
 green pasturage is ideally suited for 
 sheep farming, cattle rearing and     
 associated crop production. The seven 
 farms in this block generaly practice 
 mixed farming using modern machinery  
 and methods. Soil conditions, climate,
 impose limits within which farming can
 be developed although increased use of
 fertilizers is common. Breeds of sheep
 include Gray face, South Country      
 Cheviots and over 60 Dorset Downs at  
 Lochtower kept for thier thick wool   
 and quality meat. Small herds of      
 cattle are kept on the majority of    
 farms. Lochside, a dairy farm has over
 235 friesans. 2,500 litres of milk are
 produced a day from this 311 acre     
 farm. Land is now being converted to  
 crop productions because of EEC milk  
 quotas. A rare breed of cow the       
 British White is kept for intrest.    </content>
