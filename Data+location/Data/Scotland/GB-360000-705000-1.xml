 The Ancient Royal Burgh of Craill     
 is a delightful town in the far east  
 corner of Fife. It nestles round a    
 sheltered harbour on the north coast  
 of the Firth of Forth,open to the     
 winds of the south and east.  Most    
 important pursuits are farming and    
 fishing for crabs and lobster. Many   
 older people retire here some brought 
 as children for holidays and have     
 happy memories of playing on the      
 beaches and scrambling over the rocks.
  New houses have been built and more  
 are expected.  Tourism is very        
 important to the area with three      
 caravan sites and several hotels.     
 The local people are jealous of their 
 inheritance.  Much is done to protect 
 the old style of architecture.
