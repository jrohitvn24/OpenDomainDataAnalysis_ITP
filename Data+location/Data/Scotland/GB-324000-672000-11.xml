		<title>11Edinburgh Festival</title>
		<content> The Edinburgh Festival{events}take    
 place all over Edinburgh in theatres, 
 halls or outside. There will be over  
 1000 shows and some breakdance etc.In 
 1985 there were more theatres than    
 anything else.The performers come from
 Africa,S. and N.America, and from all 
 over Europe. People come from all over
 the world for the{entertainment}      
 supplied in the festival or fringe,   
 especially Americans because the      
 dollar beats the pound and they get   
 more value for their money.           
 In the Eighties{politics}are playing a
 big part in the future of the         
 Festival.The District Council threaten
 to cut the grant unless more attention
 is paid to catering for the{recreation
 of the citizens.They want events to be
 put on away from the city             
 centre,things which ordinary people   
 will enjoy.                           </content>
