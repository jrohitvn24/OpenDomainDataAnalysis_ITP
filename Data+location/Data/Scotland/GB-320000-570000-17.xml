		<content> Mr Crouch was workshop manager of a   
 Youth Training workshop. About 5 years
 ago he decided to set up business     
 making pine wood furniture and small  
 items. He has had no training and     
 learned through experience. He has an 
 Enterprise Allowance of Â£40 a week for
 a year.                               
 Mr and Mrs Crouch decided that as     
 women usually buy furniture it might  
 be a good idea to have furniture      
 parties, on the same lines as         
 Tupperware parties. This seems to be a
 success.                              
 The wood used is Scandanavian Red     
 Pine. The best wood comes from Russia 
 but is too expensive. The colder the  
 climate the better the wood, as slow  
 grown wood is best quality. All the   
 wood is kiln dried.
