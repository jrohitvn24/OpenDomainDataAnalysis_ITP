		<content> During the 19th century,with an       
 increasing population,Limerigg        
 numbered many people of the Roman     
 Catholic Faith. Naturally they wished 
 for a church of their own and by 1885 
 a church was completed and consecrated
 Barnsmuir,near the Black Loch. It was 
 named "St. Mary's". The first         
 Christmas Eve Mass was celebrated in  
 the new chapel in 1885. The celebrant 
 at the Midnight Mass was the Rev. C.  
 C. Mackenzie from St. Francis Xavier, 
 Falkirk. The first priest to carry out
 regular duties travelled from Falkirk,
 but later moved into the new Chapel   
 House.                                
 However,as the mining population began
 to decline so too did the number of   
 members at "St. Mary's". In 1955,     
 the Rev. Bernard G. O'Donnell became  
 parish priest. At first he occupied   
 the Chapel House.                     </content>
