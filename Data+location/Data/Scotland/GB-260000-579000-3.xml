		<content>    The area, one of an equable though 
 damp climate with frequently more than
 50 inches of rain a year, is noted for
 its wild life. It is under the flight 
 path of migrating birds, notably      
 geese and swans.These are often seen  
 grazing on their flight to and from   
 the Arctic. As pesticides are rarely  
 used, there is a wealth of indigenous 
 wildlife. The flora includes orchids, 
 broom and many varieties of fern. The 
 rich fauna includes foxes, rabbits,   
 moles,feral mink and the occasional   
 otter.There are also airborne animals,
 such as butterflies and bats, and many
 birds of prey such as henharriers and 
 eagles.                               
    The Southern Upland Way, from      
 Portpatrick to Cockburn's Path,crosses
 the Ken by footbridge, upstream from  
 the older and often flooded crossing  
 place at the 'Stepping Stones'.       </content>
