		<content>{Auchterhouse}is a happy community     
 where people are willing to help each 
 other. There is very little           
 unemployment, with most people        
 commuting to{Dundee}to work. There    
 is a good social atmosphere. The{     
{Community Council}organises a{Sports  
{Day}each June when the highlight is   
 the race from the park to the top of  
 the hill and back again, a gruelling  
 race in which children of six years to
 adults over fifty years compete.      
 Four years ago{Mr. G.Stewart}formed a 
{Pipe Band}for young people. He has    
 trained a very successful group of    
 twenty young pipers and drummers who  
 play at functions all over{Tayside.}  
 Each year they hold a{fund-raising    
{Barn Dance}at{Scotston Farm}which is  
 attended by over five hundred people. 
 This popular yearly event is supported
 by people from far and wide.          </content>
