		<content> The people of{Hillside}see themselves 
 as a different community from Montrose
 and value the green fields that lie   
 between the village and the town.The  
{adult population}is about 900 and     
 could be split into Hospital          
 workers,commuters,retired,and those   
 who live and work in the village of   
 whom there are only six!There are two 
{shops.A grocers and a newsagent}which 
 is also the Post Office.The primary   
{school and Church}are next to the     
{Village Hall}where a variety of clubs 
 meet.eg.WRI,country dance,Young Wives.
 There is a football club,Hillside Lads
 that plays in the public park.A       
 bowling green and tennis courts are   
 also well used in the summer months.In
 Hillside,everyone knows everyone else 
 and is interested in their neighbour. 
 This "noseyness" creates a sense of   
 community and a separate identity.    </content>
