		<title>16HOUSING, MUTHILL.</title>
		<content> The housing in Muthill is a mixture of
 terraced, detached, semi-detached, and
 there are still "pre-fabs", erected   
 shortly after 1945, now modernised,   
 and well liked by their occupants.    
 Many of the {older stone built  houses
 date from 1720 onwards, some with     
 walls 70 to 100 cm thick.             
 The rebuilding of Drummond and        
 Willoughby streets followed a horrific
 incident in January 1716.An order to  
 destroy Muthill,Crieff and Dunning    
 subsequent to the 1715 rebellion led  
 to 50 soldiers, based at Drummond     
 Castle, setting fire to the houses.   
 Guns were pointed at those trying to  
 save their possessions, and they were 
 left to their fate in the snowy night.
 Many had left the area before Govern- 
 ment compensation was paid in 1722.   
 The most recent building scheme is    
 Ancaster Way, built in 1981/1982.     </content>
