		<content> The land round Renfrew is extremely   
 flat - no part is above 8 in ASI. The 
 area consists largely of the flood    
 plain of the River Clyde and its      
 tributary the White Cart. Large tracts
 of land are still liable to flood in  
 periods of exessive rainfall. The     
 River Clyde is the main feature of the
 physical landscape. It is largely a   
 man made waterway: embanked and       
 canalised 200 years ago to enable the 
 passage of shipping. Today the        
 landscape is a mixture of townscape   
 and farmscape. The main plantations of
 woodland are found around the farms to
 act as shelter belts.The south bank of
 the Clyde is becoming increasingly    
 derelict because of declining industry
 and is overgrown within weeks of being
 abandoned, especially by the          
 widespread willow herbs.
