		<content> The{Angling Club}was started in 1930  
 by Lord Stair. Lord Stair is the      
 President of Soulseat Loch fishing and
 of two other lochs. Anglers can catch 
 three different kinds of fish, perch, 
 roach and trout.Two different kinds   
 of trout are available. These are     
 brown trout and rainbow trout. The    
 session starts on the 15th. March and 
 finishes on the 6th. October.There    
 are several competitions including the
 Alf Steel Rosebowl and the annual     
 bait competition. In 1985 there       
 were 39 competitors for this.A water  
 bailiff walks round Soulseat Loch to  
 make sure no-one is fishing illegally.
 You can float fish and spin  and use a
 weight to fish from the bottom. The   
 baits most used are worms, maggots and
 casters. If you catch a salmon you    
 must return it to the water.
