		<title>10DEPOPULATION IN EDAY</title>
		<content>    On a tour round Eday one cannot    
 help but notice the number of ruined  
 and derelict houses scattered around  
 the island. These are a direct result 
 of depopulation in the Orkneys.       
    In 1851 there were 947 people      
 living on Eday. This was the maximum  
 population the island had. By 1961    
 there were only 198 people and now in 
 1985, there are roughly 140 people    
 living on Eday.                       
    Many of the old ruined houses are  
 now used for storage by the crofters, 
 perhaps for their winter hay, or as   
 hen houses or they may have been      
 converted into implement sheds. Some  
 are left as ruins to crumble slowly   
 away.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
