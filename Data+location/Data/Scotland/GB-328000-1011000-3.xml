		<content> The rocks of the area are Old Red     
 Sandstone which makes execellent      
 building stone.In the olden days all  
 houses and farm buildings were built  
 of this stone.There are two disused   
 quarries in the area where stone was  
 excavated for building purposes.The   
 best stone would have been brought in 
 from quarries in other parishes.Not   
 only were the walls built of stone but
 also the roofs were made of thick     
 flagstones and the floors.After the   
 2nd.World War many houses were built  
 out of old army huts and concrete     
 blocks were built around them.Many of 
 these are still in use today.Houses   
 nowadays are built of blocks with     
 tiled roofs.Farm buildings today are  
 generally built of steel.
