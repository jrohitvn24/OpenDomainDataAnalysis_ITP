		<title>20NEW HOUSING, CARNOUSTIE.</title>
		<content>   Many of the{houses}in Carnoustie    
 were built about 100 years ago and are
 made of{stone}with traditional{slate  
{roofs.} When these houses were built  
 very few had garages.  Nowadays,      
 however, with the great increase in   
 the number of cars more garages are   
 being built. This is noticeable in one
 of the biggest housing developments   
 in the area, built by Charles Gray    
 (Builders) Ltd., at Carlogie Green.   
   100 houses are already completed,   
 18 are still under construction, with 
 future plans for another 38.          
   The houses are timber-framed with a 
 brickwork or blockwork outer wall and 
 a roughcast finish.  The roofs consist
 of concrete interlocking tiles on     
 insulation board on roof trusses.     
   As the company's advertising slogan 
 goes --- Quality Homes in Ideal       
 Locations.                            </content>
