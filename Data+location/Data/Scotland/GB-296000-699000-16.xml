 The majority of the residents of      
 Muckhart,an area of scenic beauty and 
 great landscape value,have either     
 settled or stayed here from their own 
 choice.Those who commute to more      
 commercialised areas,some distance    
 away,find peace and tranquility on    
 their return.One stated"It is like    
 going on holiday every weekend."Most  
 residents have cars and are in a      
 position to utilise the amenities     
 which exist in neighbouring areas of  
 the Central Belt.A strong community   
 spirit exists.Involvement in the      
 Britain in Bloom competition has      
 enhanced the appearance of the        
 village.Attitudes are against change  
 and there is a general acceptance of  
 the idea of conservation.
