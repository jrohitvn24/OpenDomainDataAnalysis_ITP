		<title>05AT WORK IN MOFFAT</title>
		<content>   Tourism is the main industry        
 providing employment for many         
 inhabitants of Moffat.Some of these   
 work in hotels and boarding houses    
 whilst others are sales assistants in 
 mill shops selling a variety of       
 garments to coach loads of tourists of
 many nationalities including          
 Americans,British,Australians, Dutch, 
 and Germans.During the summer  months 
 Moffat mills  employ about 120        
 people,while in the winter months it  
 is about half of this number.         
  Other sources of employment in Moffat
 are  the farming and forestry         
 industries.Moffat's seven farms employ
 people during the winter and more in  
 the lambing and shearing seasons.The  
 Economic Forestry and the Forestry    
 Commission are major employers of     
 labour in the forests around the town,
 having offices in it,or nearby.       </content>
