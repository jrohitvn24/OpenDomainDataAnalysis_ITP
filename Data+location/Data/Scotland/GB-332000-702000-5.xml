		<content>  The{High Hearth Stone}is situated    
 within Balgriebank farm, but is not a 
 part of the farm itself.              
                                       
  It was given to a family by the name 
 of{Geddies}by{Edward 4th}because they 
 uncovered a plot to assassinate him.  
                                       
  The High Hearth Stone was the highest
 inhabited point in the Kingdom of Fife
 some 205m above sea level.  It was    
 last inhabited in the early 1950's.   
                                       
  The owners now live in the Kilmarnock
 area of Ayrshire and the land is used 
 for cattle and sheep grazing.         
                                       
  The views to the east, south and west
 are amongst the most beautiful in     
 Fife.
