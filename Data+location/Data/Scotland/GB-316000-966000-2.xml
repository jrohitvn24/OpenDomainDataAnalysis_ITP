		<title>02CASTLETOWN</title>
		<content>  The origin of the village's name is  
 not known,but it may be so called     
 because Shelly Hill was mistaken for a
 ruined castle.                        
   Castletown as it now stands came    
 into being at the end of the 18th     
 century when{James Traill}opened up   
 the{Quarries}to produce good quality  
 flagstones.Small houses made of{      
{flagstone}line the main street.       
   In the 1920's the quarries closed   
 down.The village is now largely a     
 dormitory village for{Thurso}and{     
{Dounreay}.There is new housing in the 
 form of council houses and private    
 bungalows.There is also an estate of  
 houses belonging to the{American Naval
{Bases}which are sited at{Forss and    
{Murkle}.Castletown now has a          
 population of 1 000 .The village also 
 has its own {Police station},primary  
 school,garages and a few shops.       </content>
