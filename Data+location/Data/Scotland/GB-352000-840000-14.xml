		<title>14THE GORDON SCHOOLS</title>
		<content> Gordon Schools were built in memory   
 of Elizabeth Brodies husband "The     
 Duke of Gordon" from which it gets its
 name,Huntly Gordon Schools.           
  Huntly school has been open to people
 from 1839.                            
  It started off as the Simpson        
 building which is now used for music, 
 drama and home economics.             
  Then around 70 years later a large   
 school was built so more subjects     
 could be taught.                      
  Most people start school at the age  
 of 5 and stay in primary for 7 years  
 then at the age of 12 or 13 they go to
 the secondary.                        
  In the secondary the years go from   
 1st to 6th.There are roughly 1200     
 people in the secondary and the       
 special unit.There are 21 classes with
 roughly 35 in each,in the secondary.
