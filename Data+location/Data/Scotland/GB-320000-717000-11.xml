{Pimpernel.                            
    Every summer we go on a camp in    
 tents. It is great fun but very hard  
 work too. Last year (1984) we were in 
 groups called{Sparta, Delta}and       
{Athens.}These are Greek names as it   
 was an Olympic year.                  
    For children of 7-10 years there is
 a Brownie Guide company. For girls    
 aged between 10 and 15 years there is 
 the Girl Guides. Finally, for girls   
 between the ages of 15 and 18 years
