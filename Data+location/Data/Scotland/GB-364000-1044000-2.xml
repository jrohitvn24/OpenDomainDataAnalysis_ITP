		<content> Of all the areas affected by the      
 influx to the island of{'incomers'    
 from outside Orkney,Burness,and this  
 part in particular,has been affected  
 the most.The term 'incomers' is used  
 for those coming from beyond Orkney   
 and there has been a steady growth in 
 their number since the{early '80's},to
 the extent that over half of the      
 residents come from elsewhere.Most are
 family groups with middle aged parents
 who leave the towns in order to 'have 
 a quieter life' and they augment any  
 savings by keeping usually small      
 numbers of livestock.There are 17     
 under 18's who are all{English}.At    
 14,children go to school in{Kirkwall. 
 Unless further generations of incomers
 settle or a job creating industry     
 arrives,Sanday will probably reach the
 year 2000 with an old or ageing       
 population or a less numerous one.    </content>
