		<title>02Red Sandstone Quarry/Creca</title>
		<content> Corsehill quarries were in use for 80 
 years before the Second World War     
 supplying all the local free stone and
 exporting to Ireland, U.S.A., Sweden  
 and Canada.                           
 High export tariffs and the cheapness 
 of brick discouraged the use of stone.
 The people of Creca and Brydekirk     
 depended on the quarry for employment.
 In 1982 the quarry was re-opened to   
 build the National Portrait Gallery in
 Edinburgh. Recently stone has been    
 shipped to Dubai for a sheik's palace.
 Many other buildings have stone from  
 these quarries. The Lanes, Carlisle,  
 the Clydesdale Bank, Ayr and various  
 buildings have red sandstone facings. 
 The quarry company is private and pays
 royalties per tonne to the Annan      
 District Council. 3 or 4 men are      
 employed.
