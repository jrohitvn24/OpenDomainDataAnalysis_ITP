		<content>{Employment is the work that people do,
 in our D-block. The people in         
 Bellfield, Shortlees and Riccarton are
 employed in various jobs including:   
 canteen assistants, labourers,        
 policemen, storemen, shop assistants  
 school cleaners, farmers and farm     
 workers. But many of them travel out  
 of our D-block by car, bus or train to
 their work. We found that almost 28%  
 of the people in our area are         
{unemployed}and that 44% have retired  
 some, through early retirement because
 they were made redundant.Our D-block  
 employs mainly shop assistants, home  
 helps, school- cleaners, pump         
 attendants and farm workers, but these
 jobs do not include work for everyone.
 Dairy Farming is important in our area
 as farmers employ workers to help on  
 the farm land and to feed and look    
 after the animals.                    </content>
