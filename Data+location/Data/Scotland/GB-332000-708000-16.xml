		<content> Football is by far the most popular   
 game amongst the boys in the          
 village.We play in school in the      
 playground and down the park with the 
 bigger boys.                          
 Sixty is a game that we play at       
 night.It is very like 'hide and       
 seek'.We have all sorts of hiding     
 places round the village.             
 Sometimes we go into the woods and    
 play Geronimo.It is an adventure game 
 where we hide up trees and behind     
 bushes.There is a bike track out of   
 the village.My friend and I made it   
 up.It goes through the limeworks and  
 over a field.We have a lot of fun     
 doing 'times trials' there.
