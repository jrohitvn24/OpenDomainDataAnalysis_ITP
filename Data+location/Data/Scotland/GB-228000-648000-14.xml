 many animals, competitors, and        
 visitors.  The horse and pony events  
 consisted of jumping, games, showing  
 Clydesdales, and a driving turnout    
 class.  Classes of cows, bulls,and    
 calves of every breed were judged.    
 In the pets class, old sheepdogs,     
 hamsters, goldfish and greyhounds were
 among the entries.  There were a lot  
 of sheep on the showfield, including  
 Border Leicester, Suffolk and         
 Blackface breeds.  The Highland       
 dancers, aged 4 to 15, were very      
 popular.The boys and girls danced     
 to pipe band music.  The "industrial" 
 tent was filled with baking, home-made
 jams, floral arrangements, knitted and
 sewn articles and children's exhibits 
 of best dressed vegetables and flowers
 in egg cups. A lot of hard work was   
 done to make a very successful Show.  </content>
