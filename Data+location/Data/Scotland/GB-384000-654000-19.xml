		<title>19CHIRNSIDE:PEARLIN JEAN</title>
		<content> One of the most interesting ghost     
 stories must be that of Pearlin Jean  
 of Allanbank. There are several       
 versions of the story but this is the 
 most well-known. In the early 1700s   
 Allanbank House, near Allanton, was   
 owned by a Sir Robert Stuart who was  
 rather a wild person. Sir Robert      
 travelled a great deal and, once, on a
 trip to France, he met and fell in    
 love with a girl named Jeanne who was 
 very beautiful, but unfortunately not 
 wealthy. He brought her back to       
 Allanbank but would not marry her as  
 she wasn't rich. The villagers gave   
 her the name Pearlin Jean as she wore 
 a lot of lace, and the old Scots word 
 for lace was pearlin. A baby girl was 
 born to them, and they appeared happy.
 Then, on a visit to Edinburgh, Sir    
 Robert met  and married a wealthy     
 lady.                                 </content>
