		<content> I farm Nether Dallachy myself with    
 casual labour at weekends and contract
 labour for lambing and shearing.(90   
 fleeces bring in about Â£4.50 each.)   
{Work is spread over the year.}Sowing, 
 Lambing, Shearing,Dipping, Haymaking, 
 Ploughing.                            
{General farming spreads income over   
{the year to some extent}but is still  
 very seasonal. Expenditure is heaviest
 in spring. (Seed, fertiliser, diesel.)
{Capital}Investment:Machinery Â£27 000  
                    Stock Â£26-Â£42 000  
{Major Outlays:}    Diesel     Â£1 400  
                    Fertiliser Â£7 500  
                    Rent       Â£5 200  
{Rent} is reviewed every five years    
 against inflation and may rise 30%    
 next year.With reduced Common Market  
 prices fixed for farm products this   
 means increasing production or reduced
 income. Last year's income was Â£7 500.</content>
