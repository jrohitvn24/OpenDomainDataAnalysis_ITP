		<title>14HOW WE USE THE LAND</title>
		<content> As we said in the opening page this is
 a rural area and almost all of the    
 land is in the form of farms. The     
 farming is mixed and the crops grown  
 change from year to year. Among the   
 crops you would see are:              
 Oilseed Rape,Potatoes,Cereal Crops,   
 Root Crops and Grassland for Sheep and
 Cattle.                               
 In spite of all the farmland it does  
 not give a lot of employment in the   
 area. Machines have taken over from   
 people and quite a lot of the farm    
 cottages are let to people who do not 
 work on the farm.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
