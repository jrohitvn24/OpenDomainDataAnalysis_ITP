		<content>  From August to September 1974,people 
 in Fife and beyond became the world's 
 first consumers of{SUBSTITUTE NATURAL}
{GAS.}The importance of this to the    
 American Gas Industry was enormous    
 for, while American natural gas is    
 running out, vast reserves of coal lie
 waiting to be tapped.                 
  In October 1974, 'The Lurgi' became  
 officially known as{WESTFIELD DEVELOP-
{MENT CENTRE}and has since then been   
 used solely for experimental work. Its
 importance is illustrated by the fact 
 that the British Gas Board spends Â£15m
 a year on this vital work which could 
 help to ensure future energy supplies.
  Of a workforce of about 150, about   
 two dozen come from Ballingry.        
  Enquiries are under way to establish 
 the cause of a recent explosion where 
 one man died.           Blair McQuade,
