		<content> The B9076 road bisects this 3 X 4km   
 block                                 
 and runs from the south west to the   
 north east of the area following a    
 shallow valley. West of the road are  
 three hills, Fraw Houll, South Ward   
 and North Ward.   The latter being the
 highest at 82m.   The block is mainly 
 grazed by sheep although the waters of
 Sullom Voe are at the western edge of 
 the block.   To the south east of the 
 road the land rises steeply to a point
 of 180m at the hill of Trondavoe.     
 There are scattered dwellings along   
 the route of the road which is built  
 to a high standard to carry the heavy 
 traffic en route to Sullom Voe oil    
 terminal.   The most significant      
 feature in this block is Scatsta      
 Airfield which was re-built and       
 modernised in 1978 and provides an    
 essential service to people commuting </content>
