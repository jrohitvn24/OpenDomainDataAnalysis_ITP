		<title>01Our Block-East of Girvan</title>
		<content> Our Domesday Block lies immediately   
{east of the town of Girvan,in south   
{Ayrshire}Through the northern part of 
 our Block flows the River Girvan which
 is quite wide and slow flowing as it  
 nears the sea.                        
  The land on either side of the river 
 is low lying although it rises quite  
 steeply to the south to form hills    
 such as{Brae Hill,Saugh Hill and      
{Camregan Hill.} Down these hills run  
 fast flowing burns such as the        
 Penwhapple Burn which joins the River 
 Girvan near{Old Dailly.               
  The main land use in the area is     
 farming,with dairy and beef cows      
 grazing on the valley bottom and sheep
 on the higher slopes,but there is also
 some industry in the northwest corner.
  Apart from the farms the only        
 settlement is the hamlet of Old Dailly
 although{Penkill Castle}is occupied.  </content>
