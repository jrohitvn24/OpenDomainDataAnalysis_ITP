		<content> In Catterline we would like to see    
 shops in the village which we don't   
 have just now. In the village we would
 like to have an adventure playground  
 for the children and also a local     
 swimming pool. There could be a       
 circus that comes every year.Nobody   
 knows what might happen far off in the
 future. There could be a leisure      
 centre  in the village and there could
 be a ski slope for the winter. There  
 could be a real football pitch that   
 football clubs could play on,  with   
 seats for people to watch the match   
 and there could be amusements. We     
 don't know what Catterline will be    
 like in the future but these are some 
 of the things we would like to see.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
