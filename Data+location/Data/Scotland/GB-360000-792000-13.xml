 now have many more toys which may be  
 very sophisticated technically.{Lego  
 and other constructional toys have    
 taken over from building bricks, there
 are{battery operated or remote-control
 models,tho'small boys still play most 
 with the miniature models of{cars,    
{lorries and farm machinery}whilst the 
 girls play with{dolls}from life-size  
 baby to miniature teenage with dresses
 and hairstyles to be endlessly varied.
{New are video and computer games}with 
 most having a personal radio/recorder 
 to listen to pop music and sometimes  
 TV in the bedroom.Bicycles are used   
 more for play than transport, with one
 boy's{BMX}the dream of the rest.{Card 
{and board games}are family favourites.
