		<content>{                                      
 Locharbriggs is in a Northerly        
 direction from Dumfries.  Most people 
 living in this area would not like to 
 move into the town.  Most people say  
 that the Uniroyal does cause a lot of 
 air pollution but nobody suffers any  
 illness.  The houses are said to be   
 warm but there are some complaints of 
 dampness.  The style of the new houses
 are liked but there are some people   
 that prefer the old style of house.   
 There is quite a lot of shops         
 scattered over the area in            
 Locharbriggs.  There is very little   
 entertainment, the area is fairly busy
 near the main road but the housing    
 schemes are quiet.
