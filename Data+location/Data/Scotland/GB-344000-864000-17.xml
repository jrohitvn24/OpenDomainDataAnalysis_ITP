		<title>17ALL MY HOBBIES AT PORTESSIE</title>
		<content>      MY FIRST HOBBY IS SWIMMING.  I   
 LIKE SWIMMING BECAUSE I ENJOY IT.  I  
 LIKE THE WATER AND THE FLOATS.        
      MY SECOND HOBBY IS WATCHING      
 CARTOONS.  MY FAVOURITE ONE IS ROAD   
 RUNNER.  IT IS ON EVERY SATURDAY, ON  
 SATURDAY SUPERSTORE.                  
     FOR MY THIRD, I PLAY FOOTBALL.  I 
 PLAY WITH MY BROTHER AND SOME OTHER   
 CHILDREN.                             
      ROLLER BOOTING IS MY FOURTH      
 CHOICE.  IT IS GOOD FUN.              
      I LOVE PLAYING ON MY BIKE. I     
 ENJOY PEDALING AND GOING OVER RAMPS.  
      MY SIXTH HOBBY IS PLAYING HIDE   
 AND SEEK.  I LIKE HIDING FROM PEOPLE. 
      I HAD A "CARTIE" AND I USED TO GO
 FOR RIDES BUT IT WAS WRECKED SO I AM  
 GOING TO BUILD ANOTHER ONE.           
      MY LAST HOBBY IS TO HAVE PILLOW  
 FIGHTS WITH MY BROTHER.
