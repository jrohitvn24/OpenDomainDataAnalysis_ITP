		<content> It is of interest to note that the    
 block comprises part of what was      
 originally two estates owned by the   
 Dunbars of Hempriggs and the Sinclairs
 of Ulbster.                           
 Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster compiled 
 the first statistical account of      
 Scotland.His estates included Tannach 
 Mains Farm which was exchanged over   
 100 yrs.ago with the Dunbars for      
 Strathmore lodge which is still held  
 by his descendants.Though a listed    
 building the farmhouse is derelict and
 was last occupied in 1980.            
 Thrumster House was built by Brodie in
 1710 for the Sinclairs and passed out 
 of their hands in the 19th.century.It 
 is privately owned and in good repair.
 Hempriggs House was built in 1692 for 
 Wm.Dunbar of Ackergill.It was held by 
 his descendants till recently.It is   
 privately owned but unoccupied.       </content>
