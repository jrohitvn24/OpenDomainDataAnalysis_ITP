		<title>16Early Christianity in Irvine</title>
		<content> The first news of{Christianity}was    
 brought to Irvine by a monk called{St.
{Inan.}For his first church, he chose a
 site on a hill overlooking the River  
 Irvine. The hill was close to a ford  
 in the river known as the{Puddle Ford}
 or{Puddley Doodley}as it's known      
 locally. Towns people from across the 
 river could use the ford to make their
 way to St. Inan's church. The present{
{Irvine Old Parish Church}is built on  
 the same place and our school is built
 on the church ground -{The Glebe.}Near
 the school, down a lane beside the    
 river, is{St. Inan's well}where the   
 monk got his water. St. Inan is the   
 Patron Saint of Irvine.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
