 .    Nine tenths of the area allocated
 for study by our group consists of    
 sea.Denbeath is situated in the       
 remaining grid square in the N.E.     
 corner of the area.                   
      Denbeath, which is now dominated 
 by the R.G.C. Offshore Fabrication    
 Yard , was originally a mining        
 community, growing up round the       
 Wellesley Colliery, which was sunk in 
 1906 and finally closed on economic   
 grounds in 1967. The R.G.C. yard is   
 now on the site of the former         
 colliery.                             
      The Wemyss Coal Co. built houses 
 in various styles to accomodate their 
 workforce.The Randolph Wemyss Memorial
 Hospital and Denbeath Public School,a 
 secondary school then but a primary   
 school now, were also built at that   
 time.                                 </content>
