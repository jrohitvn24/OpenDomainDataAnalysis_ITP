 This is a one-teacher school. The     
 large classroom has a partition which 
 used to divide the area into two. Now 
 it is a bright open-plan classroom.   
 The 12 children come from all over    
 the island. In summer it is possible  
 to cycle but in the winter everyone   
 isbrought by car.                     
 We have lots of modern equipment      
 including a photocopier and a         
 computer..Our project books come from 
 the library in Kirkwall by boat. Our  
 techer Mrs Gordon, teaches P1-P7 and  
 visiting specialists teach music,art  
 and P.E.                              
 Our cook makes our dinner each day    
 and serves our milk and fruit at      
 play-time. The janitor cleans the     
 school and puts on the heaters before 
 schools starts at 9 o'clock.
