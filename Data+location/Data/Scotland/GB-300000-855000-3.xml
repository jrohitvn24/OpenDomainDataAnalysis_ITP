		<content> The most common animals in our area   
 are hares,rabbits,red squirrels and   
 roe deer.There are quite a few rarer  
 animals too:badgers;pinemartens ;     
 goshawks ;peregrine falcons and       
 ospreys.Some students have been       
 studying bats in this area and have   
 found four different kinds:Natterer's 
 Bat ; Pipistrelles ;Long_eared and    
 Water Bats.The nearest recorded       
 sighting of the Natterer's Bat is at  
 Glasgow.Present day estate owners make
 a studied effort to protect the       
 wildlife on their estates unlike their
 Victorian ancestors whose main        
 interest was to hunt and display      
 collections of their trophies.Although
 the osprey has only recently started  
 to breed in Britain and is considered 
 very rare there are several breeding  
 sites in the area.
