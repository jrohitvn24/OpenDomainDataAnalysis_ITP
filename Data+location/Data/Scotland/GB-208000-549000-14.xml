    Just outside our Domesday Block,   
 but still very near to our school, is 
 a Royal Aircraft Establishment called 
 R.A.E. West Freugh. Luce Bay is used  
 as a bombing and a gunnery range and  
 there are camera posts sighted all    
 round the shores of the bay, one of   
 them being in our block at the north  
 end of the village. Fighter and bomber
 squadrons from all over the British   
 Isles come to use the range and the   
 noise is sometimes quite frightening -
 especially when they drop bombs. Over 
 300 people work at West Freugh, a lot 
 of them from Stranraer and district,  
 which makes " The Freugh " as the     
 locals call it, one of the biggest    
 employers in the district. A few      
 planes are based at The Freugh for    
 equipment trials. There is an Andover,
 a Buccaneer and a helicopter.         </content>
