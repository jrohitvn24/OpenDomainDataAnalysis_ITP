		<content>  As well as having displays of        
 domesticated animals at Letham Glen   
 and Silverburn Estate, Kirkcaldy      
 Distric Council also offers to        
 schools the opportunity to be visited 
 by the "Pets Corner Roadshow."        
  The Pets Corner Roadshow is usually  
 set up within the school playground.  
 The participating children are given  
 ample opportunity to handle the       
 animals (with supervision)and to      
 experience an old fashioned form of   
 transport-they are given a short ride 
 round the playground in a cart pulled 
 by a pony.Feedstuffs and grooming     
 materials are also demonstrated.      
 Usually 3 classes (approximately 30   
 children per class) are covered per   
 visit.If a class is doing a particular
 project help may be given.
