		<content> The{Bairds}livestock varies quite     
 considerably. There are two crosses of
 cattle.{Charolais}and{Friesians,      
{Highlanders}and{Simmental.}There is   
 one{Dexter}cow. Most of the ewes have 
 lambed. They are a cross between{North
{Country Cheviots}and a{Suffolk}ram.   
 The ewes have produced seventy-five   
 lambs which will be fattened and sold 
 in the local market. Another breed of 
 sheep is the{Wensleydales.}They have  
 only been at the farm for about a     
 year. The{Bairds}have four pet goats  
 whose milk they use. The poultry,     
 about sixty, lay enough eggs to sell  
 locally. They also sell duck eggs.    
 They keep{bantams, guinea fowl}and one
{Canada goose.}The{Bairds}have an      
{incubator,}a heated box for hatching  
 eggs, that they use to maintain their 
 stocks of poultry. It can incubate 36 
 eggs at a time.                       </content>
