		<title>09COMMUNICATIONS AT TEVIOTHEAD</title>
		<content>{TEVIOTHEAD,}BEING RURAL, IS POORLY    
 SERVED WITH ONLY ONE POSTAL DELIVERY  
 DAILY FROM HAWICK AND ONE COLLECTION  
 OF MAIL FROM THE POST BOX. THE        
 POSTMAN, WHO DRIVES A RED VAN, ALSO   
 DELIVERS PAPERS FOR A SMALL CHARGE.   
 MANY TAKE LETTERS TO A FARMHOUSE WHICH
 IS ALSO USED AS A{POST OFFICE.}HERE   
 THEY CAN BUY STAMPS AND POST PARCELS. 
                                       
 MOST OF THE LARGER HOUSES AND SOME OF 
 THE SMALLER ONES HAVE TELEPHONES. A   
{PUBLIC PHONE-BOX}IS NEAR THE SCHOOL   
 AND TAKES 10P COINS. EMERGENCY CALLS  
 ARE FREE, SO TOO ARE CALLS TO THE     
 OPERATOR. THIS IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN
 SUCH A RURAL AREA WHERE THERE ARE NO  
 SHOPS OR PUBLIC-HOUSES TO OBTAIN      
 CHANGE. TELEPHONES ARE BEING USED     
 INCREASINGLY IN RURAL AREAS TO CUT    
 DOWN THE FEELING OF ISOLATION.
