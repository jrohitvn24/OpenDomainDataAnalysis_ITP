 There is not much in the way of       
 organised entertainment in this       
 area. We have a community hall,which  
 is very much in need of extensive     
 renovation.                           
 The hall is used by the local Youth   
 Club every Saturday during the school 
 term. The parents take turns to       
 supervise. Every three or four months 
 a ceilidh- a social gathering- is     
 held. These are very well attended and
 enjoyed by all who attend; young and  
 those not so young alike. Occasionally
 a film is hired to show to the younger
 members of the community.
