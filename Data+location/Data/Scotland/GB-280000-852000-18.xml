		<title>18WILDLIFE IN GOLLANFIELD</title>
		<content>   {Foxes} around our area are killing 
 many birds.There have been three      
 cormorants killed by foxes;they also  
 give trouble to the {farmers}by       
 killing their sheep and lambs.        
   {Frogs                              
  There's a well beside the {loch}in   
 which the frogs live.Sometimes they   
 get eaten by the {heron}.First the    
 heron stays very still until a frog   
 comes along then the {heron }jumps on 
 him and the frog is killed.When spring
 comes the frogs lay their eggs.       
  {Panther}                            
  There is a panther going around with 
 its baby.The panther has killed 18    
 lambs from a farm.It has been roaming 
 around for about a year and a half.
