		<title>18COASTLINE AND CAVES</title>
		<content>                                       
 The coastline around Catterline is all
 rocks;there is no sand just stones.The
 bay has suffered a lot from erosion . 
 The road to the bay is often closed   
 because of landslides. One big rock   
 called Dunnie Woof is called the      
 Dumpling by local people.It stands in 
 the middle of the bay.People can climb
 to the top where there is grass.At one
 time the Dumpling would have been part
 of the cliff but it has been worn away
 by erosion.There are two smugglers'   
 caves in the bay to the north which is
 called Trelong. The only way you can  
 get into the cave is by boat.
