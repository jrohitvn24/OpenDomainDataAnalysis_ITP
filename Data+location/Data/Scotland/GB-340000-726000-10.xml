		<content>   TNT: TNT is a mini theatre          
 organisation for children, who have to
 audition to be a member. It is run    
 twice weekly in Newport in a large    
 hall with a stage. They put on shows  
 for the local people to come and see. 
 The group has been running for over   
 four years now  and puts on two plays 
 each year which are very well         
 attended.                             
   There is also a dancing class for   
 children in Wormit. It is held in a   
 small local hall on a Saturday        
 morning. There are three different    
 meetings for different age groups but 
 all combine yearly to put on a dancing
 and singing production which again is 
 very well supported.
