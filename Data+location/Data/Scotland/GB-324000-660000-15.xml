		<title>15A PENICUIK TRAFFIC CONCERN</title>
		<content> One of the controversial issues in our
 area at the moment is the barrier at  
 the bottom of Mauricewood Road.  This 
 barrier was erected to protect        
 children going to Mauricewood Primary 
 and Beeslack Secondary School. It runs
 along both sides of the busy Edinburgh
 to Penicuik road.  The problem arises 
 when the barrier turns the corner at  
 each side of Mauricewood Road.        
 Drivers coming out of the road can't  
 see because the barrier blocks their  
 view of oncoming traffic.  The height 
 of the barrier has already been       
 lowered but it is still causing an    
 obstruction.  At the bottom of        
 Mauricewood Road there is a bus stop  
 and people coming from Edinburgh can't
 cross onto the opposite pavement      
 because the barrier goes all the way  
 round the corner. These people have to
 walk on the busy road.                </content>
