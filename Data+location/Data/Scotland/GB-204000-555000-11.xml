		<title>11COTTAGE STUDY</title>
		<content>  The cottages in the area surrounding 
 the Lochans were studied to discover  
 their use and the occupations of the  
 inhabitants.                          
  The majority of the cottages were    
 privately owned and although they were
 situated in a farming community       
 surprisingly few were used as farm    
 cottages.                             
   These cottages were probably built  
 for use as farm cottages and have been
 bought and renovated for the use of   
 people who live in the area and       
 commute to Stranraer to work.         
                                       
  A good example of this is{COLFIN     
{COTTAGE}where the lady works as a     
 nurse in Stranraer and her husband    
 works on the ferry also at Stranraer. 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
