		<content> On the main road leaving the town     
 there us the Oban Woollen Mill where  
 they make up skirts, jumpers, coats   
 etc. with a small museum at the back. 
 On the right of the main road are     
 houses all the way out to a hotel and 
 on the left there are a couple of     
 Hostels and a school for disabled     
 children. Then there is the Soroba    
 council estate and a small private    
 estate. On the outskirts of Oban, to  
 the west there is a small cottage     
 hospital. The countryside to the South
 of Oban is mostly grazing land with   
 some sheep and cattle. It is sparsely 
 populated. The scenery is lovely to   
 look at, with lochs and patches of    
 trees. There are occasional farms,    
 private houses and cottages. As well  
 as this there is a cave  where bone of
 pre-historic man were found recently.
