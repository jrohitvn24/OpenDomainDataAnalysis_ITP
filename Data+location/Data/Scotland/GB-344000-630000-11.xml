		<title>11BRIDGLAND QUARRY</title>
		<content> The south bank of the Ettrick river   
 has a gravel extraction quarrry run by
 a local builder the unsightly nature  
 of the workings forced the owner to   
 line the workings with trees          
 Despite people preferring them not to 
 work the river the planning aproval   
 necessary to allow such a scheme had  
 been granted some considerable time   
 ago.                                  
 Just to the west of the quarrry is the
 local refuse tip which at this time is
 very nearly full.  The Region are in  
 some difficulties at present as       
 they are finding it difficult to find 
 suitable holes in the ground to dump  
 their refuse in.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
