		<content> A survey of how people spent their    
 leisure time was conducted on 24th May
 1985.The more passive pursuits were   
 the most popular.Watching television  
 and videos,reading and computers were 
 conclusive favourites with many asked.
 Included in the list of places visited
 were Bingo halls,theatres,clubs,pubs, 
 hotels,cinemas and football grounds.  
 Most of these were visited regularly. 
 Of the people questioned few took part
 in sport,although some played,in order
 of popularity,bowls,football,jogging, 
 tennis,and swimming.                  
 The Dockland Community Centre,which is
 in the area,was used by very few of   
 those involved.Facilities are provided
 at the Centre for badminton,indoor    
 football,basket-ball,abseiling,pool   
 and computer games.Visitors can get a 
 cup of tea or light refreshment.
