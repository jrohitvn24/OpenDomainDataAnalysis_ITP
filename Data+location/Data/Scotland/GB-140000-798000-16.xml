		<title>16CATTLE AND GOATS, RHUM</title>
		<content> There are about 40 Highland Cattle on 
 Rhum. They are fed only in the winter.
 In the summer they graze. Calves are  
 born at the end of March and right    
 through April. The Cattle are         
 sometimes brought in to the village   
 for the vet to examine or else he goes
 out to see them. Only the best Cattle 
 are sold; the Spanish John usually    
 comes over for them and they are sold 
 in Fort William in the Cattle market. 
                                       
 There are about 150-200 feral Goats on
 Rhum which graze the whole year round 
 in the mountains. They also scavenge  
 the beach amongst the seaweed.        
 This year (1985) some research and    
 surveying of these animals is being   
 carried out.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
