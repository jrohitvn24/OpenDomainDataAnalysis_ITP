		<content> At Boarhills Primary School the       
 children participate in a variety of  
 activities and subjects.Every day it  
 is compulsory to do English and       
 Mathematics,however in the afternoons 
 they can decide whether to do art or a
 particular project which includes     
 studying a country and its people.    
 Occasionally they participate in a    
 nature or history lesson.In their free
 time they play an active game of      
 football or in the case of the        
 girls, hockey or skipping.The         
 school is now open until 4.30 p.m. for
 local children to continue with their 
 sport as Boarhills has no recreational
 facilities of its own.The children are
 able to go swimming in St.Andrews once
 a week and do gymnastics with an      
 outside instructor.
