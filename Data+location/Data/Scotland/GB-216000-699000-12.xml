		<content> Pole Farm is run by Jim Jackson and   
 his son Davy.They have{3200 Scottish  
{Blackface Sheep}on{3240 hectares}of   
 mainly hill ground.They breed         
 Blackface sheep because they are hardy
 and require little concentrate feed.  
 They are most suitable for this type  
 of environment. Of the lambs born     
 about 20% are twins.650 lambs are kept
 for breeding stock and the rest are   
 sold.They keep the ewes for 5 years   
 and then sell them because they are   
 too old for hill ground.The average   
 price for one is about Â£35.Another    
 source of income is wool for which    
 they receive approx. 90p./kg.         
 Some carse land is used to grow crops 
 which are used mainly for feeding the 
 sheep.(e.g.rape,cabbage,hay).They buy 
 in feeding such as{beet pulp,bruised  
{barley,hay and turnips.}They keep a   
 jersey cow for milk and hens for eggs.</content>
