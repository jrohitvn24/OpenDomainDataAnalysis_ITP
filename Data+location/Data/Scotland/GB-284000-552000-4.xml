		<content>   There is no industry and little     
 building in this area so people are   
 anxious to preserve wild life.        
   Rough Island,in the estuary of the  
 River Urr is a bird reserve owned by  
 the National Trust.It is about 1km.   
 long by 0.5km wide and at its highest 
 point is about 30m.above sea level.   
   People are not allowed to go on the 
 island in May or June when the birds  
 are nesting. Oyster-catchers,seagulls,
 terns and plovers nest on the island. 
 An oyster-catcher's egg is greyish    
 with black spots. They look like the  
 pebbles on the beach so you must be   
 careful not to stand on them.         
   When it was low-tide we walked      
 across the mud from Rockcliffe and    
 climbed to the cairn. If you do not   
 carry up a stone for the cairn,you    
 might have bad luck!
