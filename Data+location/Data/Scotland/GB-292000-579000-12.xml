 Houses range from from listed and more
 traditional buildings to a relatively 
 modern Council housing scheme at Holy-
 wood and new private bungalows in the 
 Newbridge area. Many of the Council   
 houses are for pensioners as are six  
 in the converted Old School. 14 of the
 73 Council houses are now owner       
 occupied. There are still some tied   
 houses but some farmers let their un- 
 occupied on a short lease basis       
 or occasionally as holiday lets.      
{Gribton Mansion}sub-divided into flats
 while{Dalawoodie House}has been con-  
 verted into a private nursing home and
 can take 22 residents with a staff of 
 2 fulltime nurses and parttime trained
 and ancilliary staff. The home is     
 government subsidised. The majority of
 properties are owner occupied and all 
 but 8 derelict cottages are adequate. </content>
