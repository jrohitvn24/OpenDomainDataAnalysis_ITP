		<title>14Travelling through Linwood</title>
		<content> Much traffic passes through{Linwood } 
 and one of the busiest roundabouts is 
 the {Clippens }roundabout.Traffic     
 passing around this roundabout is     
 travelling to and from{Glasgow,       
{Paisley, Johnstone, Bridge of Weir,   
{Houston}and{Linwood.}We went to the{  
{Clippens}roundabout to find out how   
 much traffic passes.We chose a quiet  
 time because it would be easier to    
 count traffic then.We found that in 10
 minutes, 44 cars, 1 taxi, 3 lorries,  
 13 vans, 1 tractor and 1 bicycle came 
 into{Linwood.}In that same 10 minutes,
 55 cars, 1 taxi, 7 lorries, 1 bus and 
 13 vans went out of{Linwood.}Many     
 people travelling around this area are
 going to work in{Paisley}and{Glasgow.}
 Many of the lorries and vans are      
 carrying produce from nearby farms.   
 Just think what the traffic would have
 been like at the rush hour!           </content>
