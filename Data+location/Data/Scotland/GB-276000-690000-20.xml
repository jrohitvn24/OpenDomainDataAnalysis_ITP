{Batterflats}is a red brick building , 
 with white window frames.Surrounded by
 it's own grounds full of trees and    
 grass.There is a slope at the front of
 the house so wheelchairs can go up and
 down with ease.Batterflats is a       
 sheltered home which means that the   
 people inside are not able to take    
 care of themselves.A matron looks     
 after them in small groups.At the     
 moment there are 31 beds and 1        
 vacancy. There is not lower age limit 
 but they are hesitant to accept people
 under 60.The patients are mainly      
 stroke victims or very old people.    
{Westerlands}is similar type of home   
 where the elderly pay for their care. 
 If they become bed_ridden they have to
 go to a{geriatric ward}in the         
 hospital.Some old people stay on their
 own or with their children.(A.CURLEY.)</content>
