		<title>07WEST KILBRIDE PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our{old school}was{built}in{1875}and  
 it stood till its 100th anniversary in
 1975. However it didn't stand for much
 longer as in{May 1980}it was{burnt    
 down. Now in 1985 we still don't know 
 the cause of the fire _ whether it    
 was an electrical fault or whether it 
 was deliberate. In February 1981 the  
 first turf was dug for the new school,
 and in{1983}our{new school}was comple-
 ted. The main building holds the P1's 
 - P6's. The P7's are in{huts}outside. 
 There are about 500 pupils in the     
 school altogether and every year about
 70 pupils from P7 leave for Ardrossan 
 Acadamy.                              
 School begins at 9.00am.We get our    
 morning play -time at 10.40am to      
 11.00am. The next is for lunch. We get
 out at 12.20pm till 1.30pm. The next  
 interval is at  2.30pm till 2.40pm, we
