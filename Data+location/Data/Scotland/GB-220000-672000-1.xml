		<title>01LANDSCAPE OF KIP VALLEY</title>
		<content> The land in this area runs from the   
{Firth of Clyde}at Lunderston Bay      
 eastwards through moorland and a large
 U-shaped valley. Running along the    
 shore is a raised beach about 1/4Km   
 wide which provides a flat coastal    
 plain.   The area north of the valley 
 rises to 130m and is used for rough   
 grazing and forestry with a small     
 housing area.   Running through the   
 valley is the{A78}trunk road and a    
 railway line.   On the valley floor   
 industry and education are found in   
 the form of an{International Business 
{Machines}factory and{Greenock High    
{School.}  The south side of the valley
 rises to 200m.  Running along the top 
 of the valley is a man-made aqueduct, 
 known as "the Cut", which formerly    
 supplied water to{Greenock.}          
 Surrounding it is an area of moorland.
