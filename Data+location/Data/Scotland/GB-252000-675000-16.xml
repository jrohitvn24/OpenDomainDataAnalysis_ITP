		<title>16MILNGAVIE WATER WORKS</title>
		<content>{Mugdock}and{Craigmaddie }resevoirs    
 supply water for the city of Glasgow. 
 Mugdock resevoir was opened in 1859   
 and Craigmaddie resevoir 37 years     
 later.The water for these resevoirs   
 is brought by a pipeline for 25 miles 
 from Loch Katrine.                    
    We visited these resevoirs and     
 found it a nice place for walking.    
 There were lovely flower gardens and  
 trees by the resevoirs and we noticed 
 a sign saying "Exhibition".Inside     
 there were pictures showing you the   
 history of the water works and how,in 
 olden days this lovely clean water was
 so much needed.Dirty drinking water   
 often caused cholera outbreaks.       
    As we were leaving, we looked at a 
 statue of the engineer of the  water  
 works and drank some of the delicious 
 water.
