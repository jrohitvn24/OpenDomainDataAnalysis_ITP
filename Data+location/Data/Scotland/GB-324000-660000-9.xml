		<content> The land which  is now the barracks   
 was owned by Mrs. Cooper who sold the 
 land for Â£10,000. In 1804-1837 the    
 land was a French Prisoner of War     
 Camp.   After that it was a Military  
 Prison. The men who died there were   
 buried where the old station was and  
 there is a monument to them.  From    
 1881-1960 it was a Royal Scots Depot. 
 It was closed in 1960 and opened in   
 1964 as a depot for the seven Scottish
 Regiments.                            
 There are over 500 men in the barracks
 at present.  They stay there for 16   
 weeks initial training then they go to
 different battalions stationed        
 throughout the world.  The regiments  
 which the men can join are First Royal
 Scots, Royal Highland Fusiliers,      
 Queen's Own Highlanders, King'S Own   
 Scottish Borderers and the Argyll and 
 Sutherland Highlanders.               </content>
