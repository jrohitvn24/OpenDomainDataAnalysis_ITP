		<content> WE SOMETIMES PLAY BALL TIG.   YOU GET 
 TWO BALLS AND YOU THROW THEM AT       
 PEOPLE'S LEGS BELOW THE KNEE, AND ONCE
 IT HAS HIT THEM THEY ARE OUT UNTIL THE
 NEXT TIME.   WE ALSO PLAY FOOTBALL.   
 THE TEAMS ARE USUALLY BOYS AGAINST    
 GIRLS.   IN THE SUMMER WE PLAY        
 ROUNDERS AND NETBALL.   WE PLAY A GAME
 THAT WE CALL POCK BALL.   YOU GET TWO 
 BALLS AND THE PERSON WHO HAS THE BALLS
 RUNS ABOUT WITH THEM.   SOMEBODY HAS  
 TO CATCH YOU, BUT BEFORE THEY CATCH   
 YOU, YOU HAVE TO GET RID OF THE BALL. 
  IF THEY CATCH YOU BEFORE YOU GET RID 
 OF IT YOU HAVE TO STAND WITH YOUR LEGS
 APART.   YOU CAN GET FREED IF A BALL  
 IS PASSED BETWEEN YOUR LEGS, BUT THE  
 PERSON WHO CAUGHT YOU CANNOT FREE YOU.
