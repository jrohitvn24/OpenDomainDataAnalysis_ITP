		<content>   I live on my own in one of          
 the cottages in the main street of    
 Carrington. I am widowed. I can't walk
 without the aid of my zimmer and my   
 eyesight is very bad.                 
   I have a homehelp who comes each day
 at 9 o'clock. First she makes my      
 breakfast and then helps me out of    
 bed. While I eat my breakfast she     
 kindles my fire. My homehelp has to do
 most of my housework such as, dusting,
 hoovering, washing and ironing.       
   She is only able to stay for 2 hours
 each day as she has more houses to    
 visit.                                
   A grocers van from Gorebridge brings
 messages to my door every Friday, as  
 there are no local shops.             
   During the day I pass my time       
 reading, watching TV and knitting.
