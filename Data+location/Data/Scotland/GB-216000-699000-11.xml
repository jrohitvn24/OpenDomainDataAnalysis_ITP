		<content> The narrow roads into the village are 
 sometimes blocked with snow whoch     
 disrupts bread and milk deliveries. If
 the roads remain blocked for several  
 days bread,milk,etc. are brought to   
 the village by boat.In case of a      
 medical emergency in bad weather a    
 helicopter is used to take the sick   
 person to hospital.                   
 The Royal Navy,which has a base at    
 Douglas Pier,just outside the         
 village,contributes greatly to the    
 traffic using the loch as do the many 
 pleasure craft.                       
 The remnants of the old pier and the  
 surrounding huts at Pierhead are all  
 that remain of the days when the      
 steamers were the main form of        
 transport.The only steamer which      
 visits the loch is the Waverley but it
 does not stop.
