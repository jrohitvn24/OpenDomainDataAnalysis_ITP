		<content> Although there is no town or village  
 here,a lot of people live in our      
 block.Most of them are quite friendly.
 Mainly Scots live here,but in the last
 few years, many newcomers have        
 arrived.They have come because of the 
 oil industry.We now have Dutch,German,
 Canadian,American,French and Filipino 
 families here as well as extra Scots, 
 English,Irish and Welsh people.Many of
 the foreign families live in Woodlands
 Park estate.Some have become part of  
 the community,while others keep to    
 themselves.There are a lot of younger 
 people,some with small children.There 
 are not very many old people.Many of  
 the mothers stay at home during the   
 day.There are really two groups of    
 people living here now.First there are
 the older folk who have lived here for
 many years.Second,there are the       
 younger people from other places.     </content>
