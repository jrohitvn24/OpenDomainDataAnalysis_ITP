		<title>10Education on Papa Stour.</title>
		<content> The present school on Papa Stour is   
 100 years old and up to 56 pupils have
 been recorded.In 1970 the school      
 closed because there were no pupils.  
   It reopened 4 years later,and the   
 present roll of 4 pupils is aged      
 between 7-11 years.The sole teacher   
 is helped out on 2 afternoons a week  
 by her husband who teaches Art.       
   At the age of 12,the children go to 
 the Mainland for their secondary      
 education.This means that they live   
 away from home in a hostel or lodgings
 They can usually come home at weekends
 between Easter and October but during 
 the winter the weather prohibits this.
   In 1900 Mr.Robertson wrote in the   
 school log,"On Wednesday the ink-wells
 were so closely frozen over that copy-
 writing had to be postponed for the   
 day".I wonder what he would have      
 thought of "Fred" our micro?.......   </content>
