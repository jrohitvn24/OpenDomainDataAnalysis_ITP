		<title>01 Principal Features E.K.</title>
		<content>    In our block there is a wide range 
 of shops of high quality.They are well
 laid out for maximum efficiency.E.K.  
 has one main shopping centre in the   
 middle and other smaller neighbourhood
 shops round about.                    
    My family mainly use the large     
 shops because it is cheaper and have  
 more variety.If we just need the odd  
 thing or two we use the Greenhills    
 Shopping Centre which has recently    
 been renovated.                       
    In the block there is a lot of     
 footpaths and bridges.It is laid out  
 so the majority of the paths are away 
 from roads for safety.                
    Around E.K. there is a Green Belt  
 that keeps E.K.separate from Glasgow. 
 I am getting worried because the Green
 Belt is shrinking.I hope it stops now 
 because if it does not we could become
 part of Glasgow.                      </content>
