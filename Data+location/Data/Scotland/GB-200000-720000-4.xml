		<title>04THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church is situated on a hill      
 overlooking Kilchrenan Village with   
 lovely views of Ben Cruachan, the     
 surrounding hills and Loch Awe.       
  It is a Presbyterian Church of       
 Scotland. We share our minister for   
 the linked charges of Muckairn,       
 Kilchrenan and Dalavich.              
   Being a presbyterian church the     
 financial and pastoral affairs are    
 managed by a "Kirk Session" composed  
 of lay members. The kirk session is   
 represented at the Presbytery of Lorne
 and Mull which is responsible to the  
 Synod of Argyll, which in turn is     
 responsible to the General Assembly   
 of the Church of Scotland.            
  Many people visiting this area have  
 signed the visitors' book. Some have  
 come from other parts of the world    
 to search for their ancestors.
