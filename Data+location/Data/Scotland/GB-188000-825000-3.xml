		<title>03DORNIE PRIMARY SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> Our school lies on the eastern shore  
 of Loch Long in the village of        
 Dornie.It consists of two classrooms  
 separated by a busy road.There are 29 
 pupils in the school,20 boys and 9    
 girls and there are two teachers. One 
 class has the children from primary 1 
 to 4 and the other 5 to 7. The school 
 starts at 9.30am and finishes at      
 4.pm.There are breaks in the morning  
 for half an hour, lunch time for an   
 hour and then in the afternoon for 15 
 minutes. Lunches which are made in    
 Lochalsh School are served in the     
 canteen which is part of the school   
 house. There are no playing fields at 
 the school,just two tarred playgrounds
 and a small grassy patch. Games are   
 therefore limited.
