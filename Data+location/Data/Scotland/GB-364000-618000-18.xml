		<title>18Law and Order in Jedburgh</title>
		<content> The police station, a sub_station of  
 Hawick ,is open during office hours.If
 unmanned,when required,one must       
 telephone Hawick who radio to the     
 nearest P.C. to attend .There are     
 eight burgh constables and three      
 traffic department constables .One    
 inspector and three sergeants are     
 shared by Kelso .One sergeant is      
 always on duty.Because of the nature  
 of the town,the police deal mainly    
 with motoring  offences ,domestic     
 disputes,and petty crime involving    
 juveniles. There has been an increase 
 in house breaking ,however. The High  
 Court sits in Jedburgh,if required.   
 The Sheriff Court sits on Thursdays if
 needed.The District Court presided    
 over by justices can deal with minor  
 offences but seldom sits now.
