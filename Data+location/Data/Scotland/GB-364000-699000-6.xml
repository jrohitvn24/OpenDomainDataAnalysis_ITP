		<content> The Isle of May has been a place of   
 note for over a thousand years. the   
 name of May or Maia seems to have some
 affinity with the Maeote, the name of 
 a tribe of Picts. It is probable that 
 a colony of these people first took   
 possession of the island and gave it  
 the name Maia. The Maeote were people 
 who dwelt between the walls of Hadrian
 and Antonine. Another possible        
 derivation of the name is             
 Scandinavian, as it also occurs in    
 Caithness, where most of the place    
 names are derived from that language. 
 The Scandinavian meaning refers to the
 luxuriant plant life of the place.
