		<content> Each July a Herring Queen and Court of
 6 are chosen from girls at the local  
 Secondary School.At one time they all 
 had to be the daughters of local      
 fishermen but this no longer applies. 
 The week long Festival which marks the
 towns one time importance as a herring
 port,opens with the Queen and Court   
 being brought by fishing boat from the
 nearby port of St Abbs.Once ashore the
 Queen is crowned by the retiring Queen
 and after various welcoming speeches  
 she presents awards and prizes.Later  
 at the head of a convoy of cars and   
 floats she tours Eyemouth.            
 Foe the rest of the week she attends  
 various civic functions,including     
 parades,dances and football matches,  
 making welcoming speeches and handing 
 our awards.
