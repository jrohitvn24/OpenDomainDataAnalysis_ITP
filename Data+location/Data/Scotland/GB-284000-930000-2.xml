 In 1864 Queen Victoria built Balmoral 
 Castle. Rich people followed her      
 example and bought estates in         
 Scotland. The Strath of Kildonan is   
 divided into six estates -Achentoul,  
 Badanloch, Borrobol,Suisgill, Kildonan
 and Torrish. Some of them are owned by
 well known personalities. The land in 
 our block is owned by the Rt. Hon.Sir 
 Anthony Nutting who was Under         
 Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
 1951-54 and by Viscount Leverhulme who
 has a large estate in Cheshire.       
 Barbara Cartland, the famous novelist,
 is also part owner of an estate. Most 
 of the propietors have land in England
 but come to Scotland to fish and      
 shoot.
