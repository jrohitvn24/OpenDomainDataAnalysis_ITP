		<title>16BALMEDIE MUSHROOM FARM</title>
		<content> In Balmedie there is a mushroom farm. 
 It is the only inhabited farm in our  
 immediate area and has 17 staff (12   
 ladies and 5 men). The ladies pick the
 mushrooms, and the men prepare compost
 and sow seeds. It wasn't a mushroom   
 farm until 1978. Before that time it  
 was only a farm building. They have   
 asbestos sheets on the roof and       
 special trays in which they prepare   
 the mushrooms. The mushrooms need     
 compost to grow. They need to be      
 watered once a week in summer and     
 twice a week in winter. Mushrooms to  
 grow well need chicken and horse      
 manure. Mushrooms need an atmosphere  
 with a temperature of 60F. Mushrooms  
 are usually 5cms high and 5cms across 
 the top. Before you eat them you must 
 wash them carefully in water and then 
 fry them gently in butter.
