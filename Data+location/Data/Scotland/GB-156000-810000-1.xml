		<title>01Gauscavaig Bay Tor and Loch</title>
		<content> The above aea has a very varied type  
 of land cover.  Firstly th area is    
 about two thirds sea, which is at the 
 mouth of the sea, loch Lock Eishort.  
 On the lower quarter is the upper half
 of the township of Tarskavaig where   
 some of the crofts are still worked,  
 the main crops being hay and potatoes.
 Although some of the crofts are now   
 partly returning to rushes and        
 bracken.                              
 The midle area round Loch Gauscavaig  
 is covered by moorland and heath with 
 rock breaking through in  some ares.  
 The area round Gauscavaig Bay mostly  
 surrounded by naturl woodland, mainly 
 birch, hazel Towan and oak.           
                                       
 Around Gauscavaig bay is the small    
 township of Tokavaig where the crofts 
 are little used. The ruins of         
 Dunsgaith Castle are still accessible </content>
