<title>21Update on Crawford Arts Centre</title>
<content>

The Crawford Arts Centre became an independent, non-profit making organisation in 1988 following a withdrawal of funding from St Andrews University. Still based within university buildings, it continued successfully in this form until June 2006 when its buildings were required by the university.  It moved as an office based agency to St Andrews Town Hall, was renamed Fife Contemporary Art &amp; Craft, and continues to operate a diverse programme of contemporary visual art and craft exhibitions and projects across Fife (submitted July 2011).   &lt;br />
