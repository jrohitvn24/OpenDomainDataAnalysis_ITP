		<title>04Farming around Colmonell</title>
		<content> Colmonell is in an area of mixed,dairy
 and hill farming.                     
 The village itself has two farms which
 stand on the main street.             
 Clachanton at the eastern end of the  
 village is a typical mixed farm. It   
 has areas of hill ground used for beef
 cattle and sheep and lower down on the
 valley floor areas used for silage and
 barley production.Clachanton also     
 diversifies by providing a drainage   
 service to local farms.               
 Boghouse,at the western end of the    
 village,is also a mixed farm but they 
 also have a dairy herd in addition to 
 beef cattle and sheep.Like Clachanton 
 Boghouse uses their low lying ground  
 near the river for silage and barley  
 production.
