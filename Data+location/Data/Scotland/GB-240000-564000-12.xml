		<title>12N.S.AREA STREET NAMES</title>
		<content>   Many people who visit Newton Stewart
 notice that the main streets have     
 names linked with royalty.This is     
 because at about the middle of the    
 nineteenth century a local minister   
 renamed these streets giving them     
 names connected with{royalty,}for     
 example{Arthur Street,Queen Street}and
{Windsor Road.}In the year of the      
 Queen's Silver Jubilee two new streets
 were named{Elizabeth Crescent}and     
{Philip Avenue.}This shows that giving 
 royal names to streets is still as    
 popular as before.                    
   Many other local street names are   
 connected with the Galloway family,a  
 branch of the royal house of Stewart. 
 This group includes{Stewart of Garlies
{Road(Garlies being the eldest son of  
{the Earl of Galloway),Garlies Cresent,
{Dashwood Square,Lady Galloway Court   
{and Countess Court.                   </content>
