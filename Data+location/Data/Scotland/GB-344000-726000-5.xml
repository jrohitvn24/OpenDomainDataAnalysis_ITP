		<content> Tayport was a transport centre, it    
 grew from the ancient{ferry}across the
 river Tay,which was one of the most   
 popular and safest on the river,      
 Macduff,thane of Fife, is said to have
 crossed the firth by this ferry when  
 he escaped from{Macbeths}court to     
 England.                              
   The fare for one person was 2d which
 in our money would be five sixths of  
 one pence.                            
   A small passenger steam ferry boat  
 plied on the passage and it was bought
 by the railway company when the       
 railway came to Tayport.              
  {Trains}used to carry the goods from 
 Tayports factories to other places,but
 when the railway was closed down the  
 factories suffered because there was  
 no transport to carry the goods to    
 other places.                         
                                       </content>
