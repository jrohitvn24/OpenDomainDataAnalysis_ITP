		<content>  Acredyke Nursery School is situated  
 in Northgate Road,Balornock.The       
 nursery is in an "Area of Priority    
 Treatment".This means that the nursery
 gets extra money to buy equipment.It  
 also means that children who live in  
 the immediate area are given places in
 the nursery first.After this children 
 with special needs are given priority 
 eg hearing or speech difficulties.At  
 the moment the school has a roll of 95
 children and also a full waiting list.
 The school is run by the headmistress 
 Mrs Ferguson and staff.Mrs Ferguson is
 the only teacher in the school but    
 there are 4 full-time nursery nurses  
 and 2 part-time.The nursery is split  
 into 2 ends.There is the quiet end    
 where children can read,draw,do jig-  
 saws and hear stories and the noisy   
 end where they paint,bake and take    
 part in physical activities.          </content>
