		<content>    This part of{Kirkcaldy}is a mixture
 of both town and country.             
    To the east is the town which is   
 not only the historic centre but also 
 the shopping and business centre.     
   {Kirkcaldy High Street}with its     
 fine shopping arcades is the main     
 shopping centre for much of the county
 of Fife.                              
    Between the High Street and the    
 station can be found the{War Memorials
{and Gardens,}the{Museum and Art       
{Gallery,}the{Public Libary,}the{Adam  
{Smith Centre}and the{Town House.      
    Across the Railway can be found the
{Beveridge Park}with its gardens,      
 playing fields, boating pond,         
 children's farm and playground.       
   The{Raith Estate}with its farms and 
 woodlands forms a background for this 
 part of the Burgh of Kirkcaldy.
