		<title>10Old Gilmerton.</title>
		<content>  The oldest houses in this south      
 fringe of {Edinburgh}are found in     
 G .Ref 2968 in the old village of     
 Gilmerton.}                           
  Along Ravenscroft st and Drum st the 
 houses are built of sandstone and     
 roofed mainly in Welsh slate. Some are
 small single-storey cottages roofed in
 red, clay tiles.There is also two     
 storey terraced housing.In Ravenscroft
 St there are a few substantial        
 georgian-type villas rather in need of
 a face-lift.There is little evidence  
 of planning in the lay-out of old{    
{Gilmerton.}                           
  The parish church  and war memorial  
 are in Ravenscroft St.which was       
 formerly the main Street.Drum St and  
 newtoft St are rather narrow for the  
 amount of traffic with which they have
 to cope.Hopefully the new by-pass will
 solve this problem when its finshed.  </content>
