		<title>16A LARGE SUPERMARKET</title>
		<content> "Fine Fare"is a large supermarket sit-
 uated on the main road to Longside.In 
 November 1985 it will have been open  
 for four years so it is still quite   
 new. Since it first opened more people
 have moved into the area thus bringing
 more custom to the shop.It is a large 
 store with seven departments each with
 a separate manager or manageress.They 
 also employ another hundred and fifty 
 people,eight of whom are on the Y.T.S.
 Their customers come from all over the
 place .Many of them use the free bus  
 service provided which goes all round 
 Peterhead,Fraserburgh,Cruden Bay,     
 Turriff and the rest of Banff and     
 Buchan.On average eight thousand      
 customers visit the store for their   
 weekly  shopping-not surprising       
 because it sells everything from      
 clothes to food.
