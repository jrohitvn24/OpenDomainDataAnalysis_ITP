		<content> In this area there are many farms with
 the same name .e.g.{North Ythsie}and  
{South Ythsie.}This is because at one  
 time these farms were all one large   
 farm.It was split up because it was   
 uneconomical. It was easier to sell   
 parts of the farm than to sell it     
 whole, but now this trend has changed 
 because larger farms prove more       
 economical. There is a hollow called  
{Gallows Ring}in which the local people
 would go to see hangings. It was like 
 a theatre where everybody stood around
 to watch. Many centuries ago this area
 must have been a turbulant place where
 there were{forts.}An{iron sword}has   
 been found and it is still possible to
 find{flint arrowheads.}There are also 
 what seem to be religious sites, for  
 example :{stone circles,cist and      
{cairns.                               
                                       </content>
