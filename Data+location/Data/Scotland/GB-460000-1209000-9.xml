		<title>09The Minister in Unst</title>
		<content> Reverend Kenneth Ross,the Church of   
 Scotland minister,has lived in this   
 area for three years.He preaches in   
 two churches-St.John's in             
 Baltasound,and Uyeasound. His "parish"
 is the whole of Unst. The average     
 church attendance is 40-50 adults and 
 30-40 children per week.Christian     
 instruction for young people is       
 provided at the Sunday School,a Bible 
 class and at the Boy's Brigade(for    
 boys six years and over) Rev. Ross    
 also visits pupils in Baltasound      
 School every week.For adults there is 
 a Kirk Bible Study and for women,the  
 Women's Guild and Young Women's Bible 
 Study.A minister working in Unst has  
 to be flexible-as well as             
 unpredictable events(like sudden      
 deaths),there are always new people   
 coming to join the congregation.
