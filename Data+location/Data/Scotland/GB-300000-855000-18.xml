		<title>18EMPLOYMENT West Forres</title>
		<content> Although the land is mainly used for  
 farming and forestry the use of modern
 machinery means that very few men are 
 now employed in this way.Most people  
 living in the area travel to Forres to
 work in schools,shops,offices etc. or 
 are employed at RAF Kinloss.There are 
 several small firms mainly family     
 based e.g. Grovita Farm,a small market
 garden; Hizzet Trailers; Christie's   
 Tree Nursery and a small sawmill at   
 Balnageith.Two recently developed     
 sources of employment are the         
 Elizabethan Inn which has 24 part time
 staff and Mundole Court a function    
 suite,shop and bar on the Mundole     
 Caravan Park.A water bailliff looks   
 after the River Findhorn and          
 gamekeepers and a Forest Ranger are   
 employed by the estate owners.
