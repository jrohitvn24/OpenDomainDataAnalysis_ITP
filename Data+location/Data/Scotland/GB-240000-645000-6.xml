		<title>06NEW HOUSING IN STEWARTON</title>
		<content> Four new developments of private      
 housing estates are on the outskirts  
 of the town.Rush and Tompkins have    
 built and are still building villas   
 and bungalows in the Ravenscraig      
 area.These sell as they are           
 completed.Green Park Homes have built 
 bungalows in the Kirkford area where  
 the old established mill of Thomas    
 Mackie's was knocked down early in the
 year.Private sites are being developed
 with a variety of houses at the top of
 Bowes Rigg.In St Columba's Church     
 Glebe there is a small estate of      
 bungalows.In the centre of the town a 
 factory has been converted into       
 Springwell Flats.These new            
 developments and the practice of      
 council tenants buying their homes    
 means that 80% of the houses in the   
 town are owner occupied.
