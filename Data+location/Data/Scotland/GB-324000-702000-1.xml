 TO THE NORTH OF GLENROTHES.MUCH OF    
 THIS IS FARMLAND,USED MOSTLY FOR      
 CEREALS,ALTHOUGH AREAS ARE USED FOR   
 FORESTRY.THE SOUTHERN AREA OF THE     
 BLOCK CONSISTS OF BOTH PRIVATE AND    
 COUNCIL HOUSING SCHEMES,ALMOST ALL    
 CONSTRUCTED DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS.  
 DURING THE COURSE OF THE SURVEY A     
 NUMBER OF TOPICS WILL BE RESEARCHED.  
 RESIDENTS OF THE AREA WILL BE         
 QUESTIONED ON THE AREA TO DISCOVER    
 THEIR OPINIONS REGARDING SUCH         
 AMENITIES AS SHOPPING AND LEISURE     
 FACILITIES.RESEARCH WILL BE CARRIED   
 OUT TO DETERMINE THE AVERAGE AGE AND  
 SIZE OF FAMILIES IN THE BLOCK,AND ALSO
 ON HOW THESE PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED.     
 TRANSPORT SERVICES IN THE AREA WILL   
 ALSO BE STUDIED.AT SOME POINT AN      
 IN-DEPTH PERSONAL INTERVIEW WILL  BE
