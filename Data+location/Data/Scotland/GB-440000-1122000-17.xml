		<title>17ISLAND OF MOUSA-SANDWICK</title>
		<content>   To the east of Sandwick lies the    
 island of Mousa which is about 3miles 
 long and 1/2mile wide. We went on the 
 "Solan" from Sandsayre to visit the   
 uninhabited island. The boat could    
 carry 12 passengers and took 20       
 minutes  for the crossing. We saw     
 seals, porpoises and lots of birds    
 during the crossing.                  
   When we reached Mousa we walked     
 along the west shore till we reached  
 the broch which is very famous. It was
 built about the end of the last       
 century BC-first century AD. It is    
 50Ft(15m) in diameter and 43.5 ft     
 (13.3m) high. It is a tower like      
 structure built using the             
 flagstonesfrom the shore nearby.      
   We climbed up the steps between the 
 double wall structure to the top of   
 the broch.                            
                                       </content>
