 Musselburgh is situated a few miles   
 along the coast east of Edinburgh.    
 It's population is 16,600.  Before the
 second world war the main employers   
 were Bruntons (wire mill) with 2,500  
 employees, Inveresk Cotton Mill with  
 600 workers and the fishing industry  
 with about 200 workers.  Today the    
 cotton mill has closed down and       
 fishing has moved away to bigger      
 ports.                                
                                       
 There are about a dozen bus services  
 operating via Musselburgh linking     
 Edinburgh and East Lothian.  Housing  
 consists of older houses in           
 Musselburgh and the new housing       
 estates of Stoneybank, Stoneyhill and 
 Whitehill.
