		<content> The water for our area comes from the 
{BACKWATER RESERVOIR.}This reservoir   
 covers 182 hectares and has a capacity
 of 25 million cubic metres.Using      
 hydraulic engineering,the water       
 services planned the route for the    
 pipe so that the water could reach all
 the surrounding area.The new pipes are
 made of polypropelene which is cheap  
 and easy to manipulate.The pipes are  
 laid  at a depth of 1 metre to prevent
 them from freezing.The daily demand   
 for water is 59,000 cubic metres.None 
 of this water is recycled.It goes down
 the sewer pipes and into the{RIVER    
{TAY.}This causes major pollution      
 problems on the beaches.There are no  
 plans for water recycling although the
 water services would prefer this as it
 would be less costly in the long run.
