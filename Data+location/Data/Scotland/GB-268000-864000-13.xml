 There are lesser numbers of bartailed 
 godwits, knot and dunlin, and plovers,
 greenshanks and ruffs are all         
 occasional visitors. For those        
 interested in bird life , Udale Bay is
 most rewarding and many people visit  
 here regularly, both independantly and
 with field study groups.              
  Local sportsmen also spend some of   
 their leisure time here as the Black  
 Isle Wildfowlers Association have an  
 agreement for acces to shoot wild     
 geese during the shooting season.     
 Accurate records of shooting are kept 
 and a strict watch is observed to see 
 that spotsmen abide by the rules.
