		<title>19SOCIAL CONCERNS RAFFORD AREA</title>
		<content> The main concern in the village of    
 Rafford is the safety of children.Many
 of the houses are near the main road  
 and as there is no speed limit,       
 lorries and car speed along the road. 
 Many people would like to see at least
 a 40mph speed limit on the            
 road.Another wish is for a path       
 through the village so that older     
 people would not have to use the main 
 road.                                 
  There is need in the area for a local
 general store and this would save     
 people having to go to Forres for     
 essential supplies.                   
  In our local paper we read that the  
 people in the Rafford area have       
 protested to the local council about  
 its refusal to allow Finefare to build
 a supermarket in Forres.
