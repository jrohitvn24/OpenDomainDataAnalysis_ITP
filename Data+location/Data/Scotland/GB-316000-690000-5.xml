		<content>   There are two main events which take
 place during the year in Cowdenbeath. 
 These are the Civic Week and the      
 Highland Games. The Civic Week is     
 organised by the Civic Week Committee,
 a branch of the local council. During 
 Civic Week there are activities which 
 go on such as the sports day and      
 primary school football tournaments.  
 The Highland Games is organised by a  
 committee made up of promoters of the 
 games. It is sponsored by firms who   
 pay for the use of the school's       
 facilities and produce prizes for the 
 winners of the day's events. Also this
 year, only this year, there as been a 
 visit by the Dick Saunders "Way to    
 Life Crusade". This is held in a tent 
 with a 3000 people capacity. It is    
 self financed to represent the        
 Protestant Churches.
