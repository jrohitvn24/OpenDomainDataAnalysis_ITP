		<title>08An Insch Farmer's Day.</title>
		<content>  My day begins at 7.30am,unless it is 
 lambing or harvest time.After break_  
 fast I go out and discuss the weather 
 and then the kind of work that can be 
 done with our farm worker.            
  I then check the sheep to make sure  
 that all is well and that none of them
 has landed on it's back.              
  After the cattle have had an early   
 morning feed and digested it,Alex,Jock
 and myself select animals which are   
 fat and ready to be sold.We pen them  
 up ready for floating to the mart for 
 11 o'clock.                           
  After reaching the mart they are     
 inspected by the graders,numbered and 
 put into pens.                        
  I usually go home for lunch,then     
 return to the mart to watch the sale. 
 After that I go home and take the     
 tractor,sprayer and chemicals and head
 for the fields to be sprayed.         </content>
