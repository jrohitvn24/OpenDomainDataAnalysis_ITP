		<title>01SUMMARY OF BALFRON AREA</title>
		<content>    Balfron (population c.1500) is     
 situated some 15km east of Loch Lomond
 in{West Central Scotland.}The village 
 is on a south facing slope, looking   
 towards the Campsie Fells and is      
 equidistant from Glasgow and Stirling 
 (approximately 30km).                 
    The name Balfron originates from   
{Balfruin- village of sorrow.}Legend   
 has it, that one day when the         
 villagers were away from home, wolves 
 came down from the hills and devoured 
 the children.                         
    Nowadays many villagers describe   
 Balfron as quiet, peaceful and        
 unspoilt. They also remark on the     
 friendliness of the people.           
    The main services for the area are 
 centred in Balfron which could also be
 described as a{"dormitory village"}for
 Glasgow. The main industries are rural
 ones like agriculture and tourism.    </content>
