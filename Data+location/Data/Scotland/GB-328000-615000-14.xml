		<title>14TRANSPORT - ETTRICK VALLEY</title>
		<content> Being a rural area the inhabitants    
 depend mainly on their own cars for   
 shopping trips and work.              
 A school bus takes local pupils to the
 primary school in Ettrickbridge,and   
 connects with the service bus into    
 Selkirk.This also carries pupils to   
 Selkirk High School.                  
 Every Tuesday there is a shopper's    
 bus.This connects in Ettrickbridge    
 with the Ettrick and Yarrow Community 
 Bus,which travels to Selkirk.         
 Farms have to bring in supplies by    
 road, e.g. feedstuffs and fuel,and    
 transport out their livestock to local
 markets, e.g. Hawick and Lockerbie.   
 As there is a high proportion of      
 forestry in and around the area cut   
 timber is often transported through   
 the valley to its various markets.
