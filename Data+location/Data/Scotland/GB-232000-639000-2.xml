		<title>02Pedestrianisation in Irvine</title>
		<content>   Most of those interviewed liked the 
 High Street{pedestrianisation}because 
 they said the absence of traffic made 
 walking safer and made it much easier 
 for parents with young children to    
 move about. The rest did not like     
 pedestrianisation because they said   
 the bus routes were too far from the  
 shops. They also did not like the     
 increased traffic in Bank Street and  
 East Road. The majority of people     
 agreed that the roads now used for    
 through traffic are unsuitable.
