		<content>  The LINDEAN block lies between 100   
 and 300 metres above Ordnance Datum on
 Silurian Age sedimentary rocks and    
 contains both hard and soft strata    
 with acid-neutral shales and          
 greywackes and some more limey fine   
 shale bands. The landscape has changed
 greatly since the Mesolithic settlers 
 had their flint "factory" above the   
 Tweed at Rink: the native forest has  
 entirely gone, its demise hastened by 
 the use - since medieval times - of   
 the valleys as sheep-pastures.        
 Nevertheless some herb-rich stands    
 occur on river terraces and           
 streamsides. The 350-400 flowering    
 plants grasses and ferns support a    
 wide range of insects and the usual   
 range of mammals and birds. The       
 numbers of water voles and otters are 
 declining. Badgers are unvarying.
