		<content>                                       
 Dalmally Primary school was built in  
 1975 it is of a semi open plan design 
 with a sizeable playing area,both     
 grass and tarmac surrounding it.      
 Within the school there are two closed
 classrooms and one open area for      
 teaching. In addition we have a dining
 hall/gym staffroom two offices and a  
 school kitchen. The school is large   
 enough to accomodate 100 pupils but   
 the role at the present time is 42    
 children. There are two teachers at   
 the school at the present time,Mrs    
 Parkes and Miss Mathieson. We are also
 lucky enough to have Mrs MacIntyre our
 auxillary to assist in the school.    
 When the children have completed their
 seven years (from age 5) at this      
 school they must travel to Oban each  
 day (25miles) to attend Oban High     
 School.                               </content>
