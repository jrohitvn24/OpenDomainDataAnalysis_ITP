		<content> Postmen are generally highly          
 respected.This is well earned as the  
 Larbert office operates a medical     
 prescription service for mature       
 citizens since the closing of the only
 chemist's shop in Larbert.As nation   
 wide,local residents are loathe to use
 their{postal code}.When asked,several 
 people did not know that they had     
 them.Some of the public complained    
 that their{postal address}was         
 Falkirk,and all their mail had to be  
 delivered from there.That is purely   
 because of their house location,and   
 has little to do with the fact that   
 they are nearer to Larbert.           
 Stenhousemuir hes not got a delivery  
 office. One local resident complained 
 that his letters, if 1st class,go out 
 from Larbert that day. If 2nd class   
 are delivered via falkirk in 3 days.
