		<content> This 12 sq. km. area lies between two 
 small towns -some 4 km east of        
 Auchtermuchty and 6 km west of Cupar. 
 It lies on the north side of the      
 valley of the Howe of Fife. The land  
 slopes gently from 106m in the north  
 down to 46m.                          
 It is generally fertile land underlain
 by the glacial outwash sands and      
 gravel. Farmscape is dominant with    
 arable farming being the major land   
 use. There is an enclosed field       
 pattern.                              
 Quarrying, forestry and recreation are
 other land uses in the area but are of
 much lesser significance.             
 Apart from the scattered farm         
 population there is the small village 
 of Collesie. Like many rural areas the
 lack of public transport and the      
 closure of rural primary schools are  
 important issues.                     </content>
