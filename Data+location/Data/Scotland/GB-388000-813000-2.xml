		<title>02IMPACT OF OIL ON DYCE</title>
		<content>  When we surveyed a hundred pupils and
 staff at random in Dyce Academy, we   
 found that sixty-six of the hundred   
 had a close relative who worked in an 
{oil related industry. Most of them had
{moved to Dyce to find work.           
  Half of the pupils thought they were 
 better off since their parents had got
 a job in the oil business. Twenty-six 
 people out of the sixty-six said they 
 had a{large house},a bigger percentage
 than people with small or medium sized
 houses. Jobs in oil were thought to be
 the reason why so many families had   
 large houses.                         
  Most of their relatives worked in a  
 manual job, only a few in clerical    
 jobs.                                 
  The survey shows how the oil industry
 has made Dyce more{affluent}since     
 1975.
