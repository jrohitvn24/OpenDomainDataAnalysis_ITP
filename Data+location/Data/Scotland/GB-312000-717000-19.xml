		<content> Bridge of Earn grew up because the    
 road from Edinburgh to Perth crossed  
 the River Earn at this point, but it  
 has recently been by-passed by the M90
 which has an exit and entry point less
 than a kilometer south of the vilage. 
 This makes commuting very easy..      
 The railway station in Bridge of Earn 
 closed in 1965 and the land used for  
 specialised potato storage sheds.     
 The single track line from Fife into  
 Perth through Bridge of Earn is still 
 used infrequently for freight.        
 Service buses linking Perth with Fife 
 run through Bridge of Earn at         
 approximately 1/2 hour intervals.     
 Many of these buses also provide a    
 service for the Hospital. Service has 
 improved over the last ten years      
 particularly through Kintillo.
