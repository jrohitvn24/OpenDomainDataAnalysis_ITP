 Cumbernauld is a{New Town}which lies  
 on a hill 100-150m above sea level    
 between Edinburgh and Glasgow and has 
 excellent communications.             
    The original design was such that  
 all the residential areas could be    
 served by the one nucleus which was a 
 large indoor shopping complex. But as 
 the town grew the outlying areas      
 formed their own nucleus as the       
 distance from the Town Centre had     
 increased beyond a reasonable walking 
 distance.                             
    The industrial areas of the New    
 Town are separated from the           
 residential areas to prevent pollution
 and unwanted noise.Abronhill and      
 Wardpark Industrial Estate are in the 
 north-east corner of Cumbernauld and  
 will be discussed in greater detail in
 the following pages.                  </content>
