		<title>04A football fans Saturday</title>
		<content> Saturday morning - 9.30am, I get up,  
 wash, put on my casual clothes (no    
 school uniform today) and have cereal,
 toast and tea while watching breakfast
 television. After breakfast I go out  
 to meet my friends and we have a game 
 of football or "tig". I'm back in the 
 house at 12.00 for a snack lunch of   
 soup and sandwiches, after which it's 
 a four mile trip by bus to go and     
 watch the local junior football team. 
 At half time we visit the chip shop   
 for something to eat. After the match 
 we're home in time to see the football
 results on TV and then we have our    
 dinner at 5.00pm. I watch my favourite
 television programme then it's off out
 again - this time to the Junior Disco.
 The disco finishes at 10.30pm, so it's
 off home to watch the late night      
 football on TV, and one last programme
 before bed about midnight.            </content>
