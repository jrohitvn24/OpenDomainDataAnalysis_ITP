		<title>18SHOPS IN BRODICK</title>
		<content> The shops in Brodick attract many     
 customers from other parts of the     
 island.This is due firstly to their   
 number and secondly the variety of    
 goods sold. All supplies are          
 transported to the island by ferry    
 from the mainland if the product      
 cannot be made on the island.         
 Consequently prices are higher here.  
 Within our area of study are the Arran
 Craft Shop, an antique shop and four  
 food shops.  Wooley's, the bakery,    
 sells its own bread and cakes but     
 wrapped bread from the firms on the   
 mainland arrive on the first sailing  
 each day as do the newspapers for     
 Curries, a general store and food shop
 Coopers Finefare and the Co-op each   
 have a branch in Brodick though these 
 supermarkets are much smaller than    
 those on the mainland.Chemist,medicine
