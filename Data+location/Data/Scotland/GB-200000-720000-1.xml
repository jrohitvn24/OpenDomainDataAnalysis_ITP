		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO BLOCK</title>
		<content> This block is situated in the Lorne   
 area of Argyll and Bute, which is a   
 division of Stathclyde Region.        
  With the exception of the south      
 eastern corner of the block, the land 
 lies on the northern bank of Loch Awe,
 the longest fresh water loch in       
 Scotland. The landscape is dominated  
 by Ben Cruachan, the mountain at the  
 top of the loch.                      
  It is a sparsely populated area.     
 Agriculture, forestry, and hydro-     
 electricity are the main uses of land 
 and water.                            
  Many people living in the block are  
 employed in these industries but      
 others choose to live in the area     
 because of the beauty and peace and   
 commute to Oban,19 miles to the west  
 or even further afield for employment.
  Tourism is the only other major means
 of employment but is only seasonal.   </content>
