		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> Most of our area is countryside.The   
 rest is coniferous forest.There are no
 villages or towns in our area and the 
 only places of residence are          
 farmhouses.The forest is called       
 DEVILLA and has been planted by the   
 FORESTRY COMMISSION.Each of the farms 
 locally are about 200 acres in size   
 and grow crops mainly.Some farms keep 
 beef cattle but only one farm has a   
 dairy herd of 60 cows.There is a mine 
 in our area which is not in operation 
 although not officially closed        
 down.The mine has a precarious history
 which is dealt with in another        
 section.
