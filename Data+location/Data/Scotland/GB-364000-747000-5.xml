 The improvement in machinery over the 
 years has made the job of a farmer    
 much easier.During the course of this 
 century, combine harvesters,          
 forklifts, tractors and other         
 machinery have taken the place of     
 horses and the number of farm workers 
 has gone down.                        
                                       
 Over the years farm work has changed  
 a great deal since machinery came.    
 Tractors have taken the place of      
 horses and other machines can do jobs 
 better and more quikly than men.This  
 means the number of workers has gone  
 down.Nowadays a farm will employ only 
 a very few men,and the "{bothy}" will 
 not be used.(The bothy was a farm     
 cottage where the single men catered  
 for themselves)
