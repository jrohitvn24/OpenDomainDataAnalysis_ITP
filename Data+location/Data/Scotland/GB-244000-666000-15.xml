		<title>15RED SMIDDY KENNELS</title>
		<content> The Red Smiddy is a well known local  
 landmark.The house is to be found to  
 the north of the area and is just off 
 a busy roundabout,about three miles   
 from Inchinnan.                       
    The building has been used for many
 ventures since it was built-from the  
 original blacksmith's shop to the     
 present day breeding and boarding     
 kennels.                              
    The present owners have been there 
 for three years and breed rough haired
 collies-"Janman".At the moment they   
 have one dog-called Tommy-and four    
 bitches.The dogs are bought by people 
 wishing a dog for show,or merely as a 
 family pet.Prices range from Â£85 to   
 well over Â£100 for a top dog.         
    The boarding kennels at this moment
 are being extended and eventually it  
 is hoped to board up to 40 dogs at a  
 time.                                 </content>
