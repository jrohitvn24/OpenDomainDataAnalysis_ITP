		<title>13A Kelso Policeman's Work</title>
		<content> The first thing a local policeman does
 when coming on duty is to sign on, in 
 an official book. Their{shifts}are,   
{6:00am - 2:00pm}early shift,{2:00pm - 
{10:00pm}back shift, and{10:00pm -     
{6:00am}night shift.{50%}of the police 
 walk the beat and{50%}use vehicles. In
 Kelso the crime rate is relatively    
 low, not many burglaries and violent  
 crime; but some{vandalism.}They wear  
 the normal black and white uniform and
 carry a baton, notebook and whistle.  
 Kelso has no major traffic problems   
 although the Square and surrounding   
 streets can be very busy at times. The
 local police cover a large area: Kelso
 Burgh, the outlying villages and farms
 within a radius of roughly 8 miles. In
 the past month the policeman we       
 interviewed had made 3 arrests, all   
 usually during night shift.
