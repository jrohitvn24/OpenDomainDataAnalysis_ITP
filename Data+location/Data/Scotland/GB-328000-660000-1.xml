		<content>{    ROSEWELL and CARRINGTON           
 Nearly all of the grid squares that   
 we studied were used for crop farming 
 with the exception of the small       
 rural village of Carrington and the   
 larger town of Rosewell.              
   Carrington, an attractive,tidy      
 village, was voted Britain's best kept
 village three years in succession from
 1977 to 1979.                         
   In complete contrast Rosewell is an 
 ugly, run-down community where the    
 principal employer- National Coal     
 Board- has closed the mine and has    
 allowed many of the houses to become  
 empty and derelict. Rosewell was      
 declared a conservation area recently 
 to preserve the character of the      
 'mining company' village.
