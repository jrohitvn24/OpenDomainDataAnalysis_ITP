		<title>17Thrumster Masts</title>
		<content> The skyline of the area is dominated  
 by three masts,These structures form  
 part of the very important Brit.Tele- 
 communications network.All trunk calls
 for Caithness,Sutherland and the      
 Orkneys have to pass through the      
 Thrumster station.The site was chosen 
 because it lies in a direct line from 
 Mormond Hill near Fraserburgh to Olrig
 Hill near Castletown.It receives and  
 transmits all radio signals and saves 
 the use of costly underground cables. 
 The station which has secret status is
 automatic and began operations in 1956
 The B.B.C.station also lies within its
 perimeter fence.There are two masts   
 supported by metal stays and sunk into
 10ft.deep concrete. The taller mast is
 405ft.the smaller 105ft.Each has two  
 dishes and accept different frequency 
 signals.The tower 90ft is for communi-
 cation with the North Sea Oil Rigs.   </content>
