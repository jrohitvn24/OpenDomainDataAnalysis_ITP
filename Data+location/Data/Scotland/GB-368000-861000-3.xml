		<title>03Temple of Venus</title>
		<content> The Temple of Venus was built by the  
 first Earl of Fife for his wife,round 
 about 1760. It was built on the Hill  
 of Doune,which overlooks the towns of 
 Banff and Macduff.Its height is 15.3m 
 and its circumference is 15.8m. It has
 five arches round it but there are    
 lots of cracks and moss on the stone  
 walls. The temple,it is said,was used 
 by sun-worshippers; it was also used  
 as a place of shelter and as a        
 look-out point.If you look to the     
 north,you will see the sea. If you    
 look to the east,you will see the     
 Dounemount Hotel and lots of          
 fields.Looking to the south you will  
 see Duff House,the Golf Course and the
 River Deveron.To the west,lies the    
 town of Banff and the beach.
