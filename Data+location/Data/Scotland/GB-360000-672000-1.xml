  The 12 square km. of land we are     
 studying is mainly arable farmland.   
 There are 9 farms, the biggest is the 
 fruit farm where I live.              
     There is 1 village called{STENTON 
  with a population of approx. 120     
 which is increasing.{WHITTINGHAME,}a  
 smaller hamlet nearby also has an     
 increasing population.                
  {EAST LOTHIAN}is a beautiful all the 
 year round even in the snow. The      
 fields are like patchwork and there   
 are green rolling hills and the       
 farmers say the soil is very fertile. 
 It is sometimes called "The garden of 
{SCOTLAND".                            
{        }We think we are very lucky to
 live here in 1985, and help to write  
 the new {DOMESDAY BOOK}.
