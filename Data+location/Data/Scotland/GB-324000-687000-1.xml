		<title>01KIRKCALDY-KINGHORN &amp; WEST</title>
		<content> This area of south east Fife is very  
 largely taken up by arable farming,   
 and contains no fewer than eighteen   
 farms.                                
 The landscape is gently rolling, and  
 overlooks the North Sea to the east   
 and the Forth Estuary to the south.   
 It incorporates the southern most part
 of Kirkcaldy, and the upper half of   
 Kinghorn, as the two main residential 
 parts of the area.                    
 Apart from farming, there is very     
 little industry in the area, the main 
 exception being Seafield Colliery on  
 the outskirts of Kirkcaldy. There is  
 also a confectionary factory at the   
 edge of Kirkcaldy, and a small tannery
 just outside Kinghorn.                
 Inland there is Kinghorn Loch which is
 currently being developed for leisure 
 activities.                           
                                       </content>
