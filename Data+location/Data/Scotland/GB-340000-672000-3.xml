		<content> The area is fortunate not to have a   
 high unemployment rate.Mining was at  
 one time the main occupation.Now all  
 deep mines in EAST LOTHIAN are closed.
 400 miners work in MID-LOTHIAN pits.  
 Women are employed in local shops or  
 travel 6 miles to Haddington to       
 factories or hospitals.Most workers   
 travel to Edinburgh.The nearest job   
 centre is Musselburgh and they could  
 not supply us with specific           
 unemployment figures for TRANENT.     
 Figures for 9th May 1985 show 2306    
 males and 1293 females in EAST LOTHIAN
 122 male and 106 female school-leavers
 The Youth Training Scheme has placed  
 nearly 500.When interviewed most said 
 that while it was better than roaming 
 the streets they would rather have a  
 real job.They were fed-up being moved 
 about with little chance off permanent
 employment.                           </content>
