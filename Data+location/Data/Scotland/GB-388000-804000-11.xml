		<title>11A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A D.J.</title>
		<content> Robin Galloway, Radio DJ, Northsound. 
 Interviewing him changed our views on 
 a DJ's lifestyle. His is an intense   
 schedule; he rises at 7.00 am, and    
 starts work at 8.45. He is allowed 4  
 two minute breaks per hour. The       
 playing of each disc is accompanied by
 the completion of a detailed music    
 return. Robin lives with his          
 girlfriend and doesn't drive. The myth
 of fast cars and women doesn't apply  
 here! He became a DJ because of his   
 love of music. His favourite artist is
 David Bowie. Robin enjoys working with
 Northsound (local commercial radio).  
 He never works from scripts and has   
 made no blunders on the air.          
 Loneliness is not a factor as he's    
 communicating constantly. He is well  
 paid but not to plug particular       
 artists. He complains only of having  
 no time to play his favourite sports. </content>
