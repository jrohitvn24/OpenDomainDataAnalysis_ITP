		<title>08MIDLEM VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Midlem}is a Border village in the     
 parish of Bowden with an adult        
 population of 92, lying on a southward
 slope above the valley of the river   
 Ale. There are 44 houses and cottages 
 round a rectangular village green,    
 most houses opening on to the roads   
 round the green, with large gardens   
 behind them.                          
{It is}sheltered by rising ground and  
 woodland to the north, but exposed to 
 the prevailing westerly winds. To the 
 south there is a magnificent view over
 farmland and woodland to the Cheviot  
 Hills and the English Border.         
{Many}of the houses are modernised     
 cottages, and there is a former manse.
 Most of the people own their own      
 houses, but there are three council   
 houses. A blacksmith's shop stands on 
 the village green, and there is a     
 village hall.                         </content>
