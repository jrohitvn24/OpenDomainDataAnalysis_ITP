		<title>09MIDLEM VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content>{The village}has a blacksmith's shop, a
 sub-post office, and a glass engraver.
 The rest of the workers travel to     
 Selkirk, Galashiels or Hawick. The    
 primary school children go to         
 Lilliesleaf and the older ones to     
 Selkirk High School by school bus.    
 Many of the population are retired,   
 some from local towns and farms.      
{The Post Office}stocks sweets and     
 cigarettes, and vans come with fish,  
 vegetables, meat and groceries. A bank
 opens in the village hall once a week.
 A Library Van comes once a fortnight. 
{The Village Hall}is used for Women's  
 Rural Institute, whist drives and     
 fund-raising events for charity.      
{The Post Bus}takes passengers to and  
 from Galashiels every day.            
{The Border Courier}goes from Midlem to
 Peel Hospital on Tuesdays and         
 Thursdays, by Selkirk and Galashiels. </content>
