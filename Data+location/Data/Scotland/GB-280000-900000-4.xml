		<content> We asked our local newspaper about    
 production methods,local infomation   
 gathering and circulation.            
{The Northern Times uses modern        
{photo-setting equipment for setting up
{the paper and print the newspaper on a
{flat bed preferring this slower method
{as it can also be used for a whole    
{variety of other types of printing.   
{Local information is gathered from all
{over Sutherland,which has an area of  
{over two thousand square miles,by     
{local unpaid correspondents in all the
{different communities.                
{The paper has grown in circulation    
{from the time it was first printed in 
{1899,from about 200 copies then to    
{today where it is read in every       
{household in Sutherland and is read as
{far away as Australia,Nepal and       
{Ceylon. }
