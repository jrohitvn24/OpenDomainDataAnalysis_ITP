		<title>02Geologists Paradise</title>
		<content> Most of our area is unclassed serpent-
 inite with narrow bands of mica schist
 , gneiss with calcsilicate bands      
 and siliceous and quartzo-feldspathic 
 flags, as well as limestone which lie 
 to the west of the  thrust line which 
 runs North and South near the western 
 boundary of the area.Such a variety of
 minerals are to be found in Unst that 
 it has been called a "geologist's     
 paradise", but they are rarely found  
 in quanities sufficient for commercial
 exploitation.However early in this    
 century chromite was mined and shipped
 south from the pier at Baltasound till
 the shipping slump of the early       
 twenties.The chromite quarries at     
 Hagdale are on the Eastern border of  
 this area.From this same pier talc has
 been shipped out from World War II    
 until now  from a quarry North of this
 area. It is shipped from the pier.    </content>
