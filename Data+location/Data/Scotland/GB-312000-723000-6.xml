		<title>06A Local Councillor</title>
		<content> Mr Doig is not only a milkman but he  
 has been a councillor for nine years  
 too.He likes to be a councillor       
 because he likes to have a say in     
 what's going on and he feels that he  
 is giving something back to the       
 community because it is where he earns
 his living.The main problems he feels 
 are vandalism and litter.Some people  
 are never pleased with what he does   
 for them and always want more.He feels
 that money doesn't always help when   
 some people want one thing and other  
 people might not want it at all.His   
 interests are leisure and recreation  
 and town planning.Mr Doig is an       
 independent councillor so he can do   
 what he thinks is best and doesn't    
 have to listen to anyone else.
