		<title>14Farming-Dairying-Old Bourtie</title>
		<content>   Old Bourtie is one part of a much   
 larger family unit.This part of the   
 unit is totally given over to         
 dairying.All Mr J Cooper's land is in 
 grass,approx.half for silage,the rest 
 for grazing for his herd of 100       
 Friesian cows.                        
   Mr.Cooper has a computerised herring
 bone milking parlour where the amount 
 of milk a cow yields is recorded      
 automatically and the correct amount  
 of concentrates is deposited in a     
 trough for the cow to eat.            
   The huge custom built shed for      
 housing the cows has two main areas,a 
 feeding area and a sleeping area.Here 
 the cows wander about at their ease.  
 The silage is taken to troughs by a   
 conveyor belt.The slurry is           
 transported from a huge pit under the 
 floor by a giant hose to a storage    
 tank outside for use as fertiliser.   </content>
