		<content> The Torphichen Parents Association is 
 a group of parents and teachers who   
 help raise money to buy equipment for 
 the school. They have organized events
 such as Christmas Fairs, Barbecue and 
 video nights. The Association has also
 held social events for parents and    
 children such as quiz and bingo       
 nights. The pupils from the school    
 spent their craft time working hard   
 for the Cristmas Fair making things   
 such as macrame plant holders, soft   
 toys, Christmas decorations and spice 
 ropes. The parents also helped and the
 fair was a great success. Almost Â£300 
 was raised. The Barbecue was really a 
 social event because although only    
 Â£54.00 was raised one hundred and     
 forty tickets were sold which is      
 almost one fifth of the population    
 of the village. It was a very popular 
 event which is sure to be repeated.   </content>
