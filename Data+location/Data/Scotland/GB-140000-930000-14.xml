		<title>14STORNOWAY S. SHERRIFF COURT</title>
		<content> The Sherriff Court is 100-120 years   
 old. There are three people employed  
 there full time; a procurator fiscal, 
 a clerkess and a sherriff clerk. The  
 court assembles about five times a    
 month, three times the first fortnight
 and two times the next fortnight. In  
 1780 the first sherriff was appointed 
 and most of the legal work was carried
 out in what was called the Town House 
 or toll booth. The procurator fiscal  
 is the local prosecuter and the       
 present fiscal has been in office     
 since 1969. The largest fine so far   
 was Â£20,000 for illegal fishing.In    
 1985. About 80% of crimes dealt with  
 by the court are related to road      
 traffic offences. The other 20% are   
 largely made up of breaches of the    
 peace and assaults.
