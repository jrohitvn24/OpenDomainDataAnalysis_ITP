		<content>   There are not a lot of businesses in
 a rural area. Mr Chalmers is a civil  
 engineer who has a business: Chalmers 
 Construction Ltd.                     
                                       
   He drains fields and builds sewers  
 and manholes out of concrete. He has 8
 men and 3 can drive. His machinery is 
 a JCB which is tracked and a JCB 3CT  
 which is wheeled. He also has a       
 tipping lorry, truck, transit van,    
 dumper, car, cement mixer and a       
 Portakabin for tea breaks.            
                                       
   If it takes more than an hour to get
 to the site they do not accept the    
 job. Their only communication is two  
 way VHF radios which are in the lorry,
 the van and at the base. It is hard to
 store supplies because their site is  
 on agricultural land and they did not 
 get planning permission for a yard.   </content>
