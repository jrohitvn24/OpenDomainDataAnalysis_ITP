		<content> An agricultural Machinery business has
 been in West Huntingtower for eighteen
 years. It is a family concern and the 
 sight was chosen for its country      
 situation and because premises were   
 available. There are five other       
 branches in Central Scotland. All     
 types of farm machinery are sold and  
 serviced. Fifteen people are employed.
 A filling station is near the village 
 and it has been open for over fifty   
 years. Two types of petrol are        
 available and Calor Gas is supplied.  
 Cycle repairs are carried out and five
 people are employed.                  
 The whole area is covered by Methven  
 District Council.
