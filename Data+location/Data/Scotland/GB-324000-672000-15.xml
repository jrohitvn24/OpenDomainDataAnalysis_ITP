		<title>15Tenements in Edinburgh</title>
		<content> Tenement Housing started in the{Old   
{Town} of Edinburgh in the Middle Ages.
 The 'high rise' buildings eventually  
 reached to over 12 storeys and were   
 among the tallest buildings in Europe 
 in the 17th century. The burghers of  
 Edinburgh built 'up' rather than 'out'
 due to a wish to stay within the      
 security of the city walls. All social
 classes lived in these overcrowded and
 often unsafe buildings.               
 When building commenced in the        
 Newington, Marchmont and Bruntsfield  
 areas in the 19th century, the        
 tenements of the Old Town were the    
 inspiration, but these new tenements  
 were lower, around 5 storeys, and more
 spacious, with large airy rooms, bay  
 windows, high ceilings and intricate  
 plasterwork cornices. These flats are 
 in demand because of their solid stone
 construction and central location.    </content>
