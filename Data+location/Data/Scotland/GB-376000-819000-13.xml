		<title>13THE BASS INVERURIE</title>
		<content> At the foot of the Bass stood a Kirk  
 (Church) but it has disappeared.      
 However, in the cemetry which is      
 situated round the Bass, there are a  
 number of old gravestones including   
 four Pictish stones.                  
                                       
 One of the old gravestones is the     
 "Marjorie Elphinstone Tombstone". The 
 stone bears the date 1620 and the     
 added inscription "from the inside    
 wall of old church". The story of     
 Marjorie Elphinstone is that she was  
 buried in the churchyard twice. The   
 first time grave robbers were cutting 
 off her finger to steal her ring when 
 she came alive again and sent them    
 running off petrified. She had been   
 buried unconscious, not dead.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
