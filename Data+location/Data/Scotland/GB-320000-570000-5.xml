		<content> Creca SWRI formed in 1928 has thirty  
 members, who pay Â£2.50 yearly. We     
 invite speakers to talk about crafts; 
 and show films on travel, public      
 service and Nature. These give us all 
 'food for thought'. We have many      
 talented members and have won cups at 
 local shows. We also have competitions
 each month, for a handicraft and      
 household article, for which          
 prizes, and a Cup, are given for the  
 highest points. Three members provide 
 refreshments for each meeting, during 
 which the SWRI magazines from HQ are  
 handed out. They cost 25p and make    
 enjoyable reading. We have parties for
 members' children , a Social Evening, 
 Coffee Evenings and an evening trip in
 June. At our May Business Meeting we  
 appoint a new Committee of 12 members.
 Meeting are held from September to May
 , with members from a wide area.      </content>
