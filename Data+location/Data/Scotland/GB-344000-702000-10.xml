		<title>10ENTERTAINMENT</title>
		<content>    There is no organised entertainment
 in the village.  There is a library,  
 The Galloway Library, which was a gift
 to the village in the early part of   
 the century.  It has the limited      
 opening hours of two hours on Tuesday 
 and Thursday evenings and two on      
 Saturday mornings, but it is well     
 patronised in those times.  The books 
 are supplied by the North East Fife   
 District Council and the selection    
 renewed at regular intervals.         
   The village hall, complete with     
 stage was built in 1894.  It still has
 the ornate Victorian canopy meant to  
 protect people alighting from their   
 carriages. Concerts,pantomimes and    
 entertainments are held there. A      
 committee of villagers runs the hall.
