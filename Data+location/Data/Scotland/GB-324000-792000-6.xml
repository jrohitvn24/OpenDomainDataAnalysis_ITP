		<title>06Balmoral Estate</title>
		<content> Balmoral Castle and Estate were       
 purchased by Queen Victoria in 1852.  
 Since that time members of the Royal  
 Family have improved and cared for    
 this vast Estate of natural beauty.   
 The grounds surrounding the Castle are
 open to the public from 1st May to    
 31st July each year. Visitors are     
 welcome to walk the paths around the  
 Royal Home. They may visit the        
 beautifully laid out gardens and the  
 conservatory. They may wander the     
 policies inspecting statues, monuments
 or visit the ballroom in the Castle   
 itself or see round the stable yard   
 and shop. The estate itself extends   
 for just over 50,000 acres including  
 heather clad hills used for shooting  
 game, forestry and farm lands on the  
 lower ground. I am fortunate to live  
 on Balmoral Estate because my parents 
 work for the household.               </content>
