   Although Colinsburgh was one of the 
 first places in the region to have gas
 supplies, it was also one of the first
 places to go "all electric".No regular
 gas supply is piped to any house but a
 few people have invested in calor gas 
 tanks in their gardens to supply their
 needs.A few have oil fired central    
 heating.  Solid fuel is most popular, 
 on its own or to supply central       
 heating.                              
   The electric supply is by overhead  
 power cables suspended from creosoted 
 pine telegraph poles.  These are      
 frequently demolished by speeding     
 traffic, thus interrupting the power  
 supply. This is a constant source of  
 complaint and the villagers           
 desperately seek underground power    
 cables,from the safety aspect as well.</content>
