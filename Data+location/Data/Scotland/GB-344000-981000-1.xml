		<title>01Burwick to Ham Geo</title>
		<content> The extreme southern tip of South     
 Ronaldsay Orkney, from Burwick Bay in 
 the west to Ham geo in the east.      
 Mostly low lying but gradually rising 
 to the east the land is farmed either 
 intensively for grass to raise cattle 
 and sheep or as rough grazing, with   
 some unenclosed moorland and areas of 
 exposed rock. A very strong tide race 
 is seen off old head (12knts) Ham Geo 
 has a beach accessible by footpath,   
 from the cliff bound fields above,    
 and lobster fishing, once pursued from
 it is now discontinued.  There is a   
 coastguard station at Brough Ness,    
 Seldom manned, and a hut nearby       
 storing coastal rescue equipment.There
 are five inhabited dwellings of which 
 four are farms and one a retirement   
 home. The coast from near banskhead to
 Broughness is of stepped rock strata. 
 Seals can be seen in the water,       </content>
