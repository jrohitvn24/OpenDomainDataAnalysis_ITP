		<content> THERE ARE FOUR PRIMARY SCHOOLS IN OUR 
 AREA. OUR SCHOOL IS CALLED 'BALMORAL' 
 AND SERVES A HOUSING ESTATE OF THE    
 SAME NAME. THE SCHOOL ROLL IS GROWING 
 AS THE HOUSES ARE BEING MODERNISED AND
 FAMILIES ARE MOVING INTO THE AREA. THE
 OLDEST SCHOOL IS 'THE BURGH' WHICH IS 
 ALREADY ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD. ANOTHER
 SCHOOL SERVING A HOUSING ESTATE IS ON 
 THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TOWN AND IS  
 CALLED'GLENDINNING TERRACE'.THESE     
 THREE SCHOOLS ARE ALL                 
 NON-DENOMINATIONAL SO SERVE THE HOUSES
 AROUND THE SCHOOL.THE ONE OTHER SCHOOL
 IS ST.MARGARET'S WHICH IS A CATHOLIC  
 SCHOOL SO ITS CATCHMENT AREA IS THE   
 WHOLE OF THE TOWN AS WELL AS THE      
 VILLAGES AND TOWNS NEARBY.IT IS THE   
 ONE BUILDING WHICH WAS BUILT SINCE    
 1970.ALL THESE SCHOOLS HAVE LADIES AS 
 THEIR HEADTEACHERS.
