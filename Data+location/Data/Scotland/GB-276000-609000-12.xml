		<title>12Sanquhar Today</title>
		<content> Since 1953 Sanquhar has continued to  
 grow in size and population - new     
 housing being a reason for this. The  
 town now has 7 policeman, 3 doctors   
 and a number of nurses to look after  
 the community. In 1976 the primary and
 secondary schools were split into two 
 separate units, and in 1981 the       
 primary school moved into brand new   
 premises. In agriculture, yields and  
 quality are greatly improved, but     
 numbers employed therein are greatly  
 reduced. As in the rest of the country
 new breeds of livestock, which have   
 replaced our native stock, have been  
 successfully introduced.  With the    
 closure of the two local pits, the    
 town lost its most traditional form of
 employment, there are still miners who
 live in the town, but they have to    
 travel up to 60 miles daily to the two
 mines in the nearby Ayrshire coalfield</content>
