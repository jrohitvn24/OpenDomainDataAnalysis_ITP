		<title>10Customs Festival in Jedburgh</title>
		<content>  Each July a festival is held in      
 Jedburgh.A Callant is chosen to lead  
 the festvities.The Callant is a young 
 man born in Jedburgh.His name is kept 
 a close secret till Declaration Night.
 His task is to lead the cavalcade of  
 horses.The Callant rides with his     
 right and left hand men and his       
 herald.His herald rides on horseback  
 in front of him,his right and left    
 hand men at his sides.These men were  
 once Callants themselves.The rideouts 
 lead to villages round about such as  
 Southdean,Lanton,Ancrum, Morebattle   
 and outlying districts. Redeswire is  
 an important rideout because it leads 
 to an ancient battle field.All these  
 festivities are to remind people about
 past rides round our marches to check 
 that our lands were safe from         
 encroachment.
