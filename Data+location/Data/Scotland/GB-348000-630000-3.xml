		<content>    Of the 48 houses in LINDEAN all but
 4 are privately owned.The exceptions  
 are a block of 4 "Cruden" houses built
 in 1949 by the local authority as     
 accommodation for agricultural        
 workers employed on neighbouring      
 farms,today none are so used.         
 The privately owned houses cover a    
 wide range of architectural styles and
 dates.They include a "baronial-type"  
 mansion built about 1850, two         
 attractive and well-sited estate/ farm
 houses,three substantial farmhouses,  
 a short row of combined cottages-and  
 -workshops,now "protected", a scatter 
 of farm cottages attached to farms ,  
 and a wider scatter of unpretentious  
 houses built by the board of          
 agriculture in 1913 (p.12).The former 
 school and schoolhouse , the disused  
 cornmill and an "outby" shepherd's    
 cottage have been converted.          </content>
