		<content>{Auchterhouse}is a small village on the
 slopes of the{Sidlaws,}seven miles    
 north of{Dundee.}Our area is mostly   
 farmland and hills with a population  
 of two hundred and fifty-seven. A     
 hundred years ago the hill was covered
 with trees but these have been cut    
 down and nowadays only a few remain.  
 Near the top is an old{sanatorium,}put
 there for the people who had TB. It   
 was thought the fresh air and smell of
 pines would do them good. It later    
 became a convalescent hospital for the
 people of{Dundee.}It is now being     
 converted into flats. Over the past   
 twenty years many houses have been    
 built on the hill. There are three    
 roads,{Old Whisky Rd., Parkside}and{  
{Pipers' Way,}all three names having   
 been taken from history.
