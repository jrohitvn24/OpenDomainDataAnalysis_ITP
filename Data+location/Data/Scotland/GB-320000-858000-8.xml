		<title>08Free Time At Birnie.</title>
		<content>  I have recently moved to the Birnie  
 area_ I have been there for only 3    
 months. I sometimes  get quite lonely 
 up there because there are no cinemas,
 swimming baths or children my age. But
 in the summer evenings it is nice and 
 quiet when you can only hear the birds
 singing. You can have barbeques       
 without people staring at you. Our    
 garden is \ an  acre of land so we can
 play a lot in it. When I go out I play
 with my sister or my dog. When my     
 friend Deborah  comes up we go bicycle
 runs or take my dog for a walk. I     
 quite often go into Elgin for         
 different activities like Guides and  
 Gymnastics and I also help at         
 brownies. All in all I feel I enjoy   
 living in the country as I can also   
 pop into Elgin in a few minutes.
