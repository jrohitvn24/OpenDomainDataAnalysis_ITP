		<title>09KILDRUMMY CHURCH.</title>
		<content> The present church was built about    
 1805,but there are very ancient stones
 in the graveyard surrounding it       
 Closeby are the remains of a 13th     
 cent Church. It is unusual in         
 appearance and has been described as "
 you can make a kirk or a mill of it". 
 The story that the architect mixed up 
 the plans with those of a mill,still  
 survive, but is probably untrue!  The 
 church belongs to  the Church of      
 Scotland.  During the 19th cent. the  
 church had a great influence in the   
 district,the session clerk being the  
 teacher in the school, which was      
 founded by the church.    With a      
 dramatic fall in population and other 
 factors attendance at church has      
 fallen although attendance at Sunday  
 school is excellent.   Kildrummy and  
 the village of Lumsden share one      
 Minister.                             </content>
