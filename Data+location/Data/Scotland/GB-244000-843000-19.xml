		<title>19CROFTING-TEANASSIE AREA</title>
		<content> Crofts are common in our area.Crofting
 is hard work and there is little time 
 for leisure.Sheep are kept and their  
 lambs are sold for around Â£30 each.A  
 fleece is sold for about Â£7.Cows are  
 kept on a croft for milk.Hill cattle  
 are also kept and are sold for about  
 Â£400-Â£600 per animal.Clydsedale Horses
 used to do most of the work on the    
 croft but now crofters use tractors.  
 Most crofters have about 10-30 acres  
 of land.In a crofter's family nobody  
 is idle.Everyone helps with the       
 harvest. Barley,oats and wheat are    
 grown.Women usually feed the lambs and
 the chickens if any are kept.On the   
 croft in spring crofters have to      
 plough and sow the land.If they grow  
 potatoes the majority are sold but    
 they keep some for their own use.
