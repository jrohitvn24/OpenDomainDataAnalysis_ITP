		<content> Nowhere on the May Isle is there ay   
 great depth of soil and the vegetation
 has been strongly influenced by salt  
 spray and seabirds (especially gulls).
 Until the 1960's much of the surface  
 was covered by a thin turf of fescue  
 and bent grasses, with clumps of sea  
 pinks and sea campion which flowered  
 profusely in May and June. However,   
 since then the rapid increase in the  
 number of gulls and the spreading of  
 colonies inland radically altered the 
 vegetation in a very short time. As   
 the gulls advanced so the vegetation  
 declined partly from the effects of   
 gull droppings and tramplingand partly
 from the wholesale tearing up of      
 plants by gulls for nest building and 
 courtship display. However there are  
 still areas, in the south, of ground  
 carpeted with sea campion. There are  
 trees on the island and few bushes.   </content>
