		<title>11FISHING IN SANDWICK</title>
		<content>   A long time ago Sandwick was one of 
 the important fishing areas in        
 Shetland.Fishing boats were moored and
 there were several fishing stations at
 Broonies Taing where fish curers      
 processed the fish caught. People     
 travelled from all over Shetland to   
 work for the fish curers and stayed in
 wooden huts built near the harbour.   
   A new pier was built in 1903 at     
 Broonies Taing to accomodate the      
 fishing boats.                        
   Part of the slipway was demolished  
 during the first world war as it was  
 thought the pier would be vulnerable  
 to enemy attack.                      
   Nowadays there are no fishing boats 
 but several fiahermen in the area.    
   Many small craft are used for       
 leisure time fishing and fishing      
 competitions.
