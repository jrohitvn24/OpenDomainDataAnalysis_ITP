		<content> The area is mainly rural and          
 agricultural. There are several farm  
 estates. The ground level is very flat
 compared to other areas. There are    
 some woods but not many. There are no 
 large forests. The land is used for   
 two things, one crops and two cattle. 
 There are several main roads and most 
 fields can be entered from the roads. 
 In the winter some of the area has no 
 protection from the wind and snow.    
 this can cause trouble because the    
 snowplough by clearing the road,      
 blocks up the private roads and       
 entrances. The area is fairly near to 
 main towns and cities.
