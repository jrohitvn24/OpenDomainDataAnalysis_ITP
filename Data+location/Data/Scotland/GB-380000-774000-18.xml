		<content> Most homes are{heated}by coal or wood 
 fires, with electric heaters in       
 bedrooms.  Some have central heating, 
 but few cottages have that comfort.   
{Cooking}is mostly by electricity,     
 including microwave. Some houses have 
 solid fuel or gas cookers -beneficial 
 during power cuts. Breakfast is       
 porridge or cereal, toast and tea or  
 coffee, then to work at 7.30am. Lunch 
 (called dinner) is the main meal -    
 homemade soup, meat and vegetables,   
 milk pudding, fruit or jelly. For     
 working wives it may be convenience   
 food in the micro-wave. High tea may  
 be bacon and eggs, sausages, fish or  
 salad with bread and butter, homemade 
 jam, biscuits or cake. Children like  
 chips, beans and juice. Eating habits 
 are changing, and French onion soup   
 with croutons may be served, or       
 Chinese, Greek or Italian dishes.     </content>
