		<title>10LUNAN AREA, EMPLOYMENT.</title>
		<content> Agriculture provides the main         
 employment in this area, though since 
 farm mechanisation fewer full time    
 farm workers are required. At the same
 time they have to be of a high        
 standard and able to cope with the new
 machinary. Women and school children  
 can find part time agricultural       
 employment at potato harvest and fruit
 picking time.                         
 Salmon fishing also offers employment 
 though this is mostly seasonal.       
 The Tourist Industry. The Lunan Bay   
 hotel also employ a small number of   
 men and women throughout the year.    
 Many of the indigenous population     
 commute to work in the nearby towns.  
 Although there is little unemployment 
 in this area, redundancy and whether  
 there will be work for school leavers 
 appears to be a great worry in 1985.
