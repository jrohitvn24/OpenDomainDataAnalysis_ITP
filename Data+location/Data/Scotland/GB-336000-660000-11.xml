 old 14th century fortification,built  
 on a hill over looking Crichton       
 Glen.It is now a ruin owned by the    
 National Trust.It is kept beautifully 
 and visited reguarly by tourists.     
   It began as a tower house in the    
 14th century and was enlarged         
 gradually as the Crichton family,     
 became more influential in Scottish   
 affairs.The family lands and castle   
 were forfieted in 1483 for treason.

 owners since.Many famous people have  
 stayed there including Mary Queen of  
 Scots.                                
   It was laid to siege and finally    
 taken by Cromwell in the Covenanters  
 War.Now it is a National monument.
