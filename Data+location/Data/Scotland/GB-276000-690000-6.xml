		<title>06HISTORIC MONUMENT ST.NINIANS</title>
		<content>{Robert the Bruce,}riding his bronze   
 charger, is situated on a spot two    
 miles from{Stirling.}This monument    
 commemorates a battle, fought in 1314 
 which the Scots won. King Edward ran  
 back to England.                      
 The Head of the Bruce Family, the{Earl
{of Elgin}raised money for the fifty   
 four acre site to house the statue in 
 1964. He then added a visitor's centre
 with an audio-visual film telling of  
 the battle.This was opened by{Queen   
{Elisabeth}on the twentyfourth of June 
 1967. A rotunda, with a flag pole in  
 the centre, has also been added and   
 surrounding everything is a large     
 grassy area on which children may play
 and picnics are eaten. If you wish to 
 purchase a souvenir there is a shop in
 the{Heritage Centre}for pencils,      
 keyrings, honey, tablet etc. The N.T.S
 now look after the site.(C.SIBBALD)   </content>
