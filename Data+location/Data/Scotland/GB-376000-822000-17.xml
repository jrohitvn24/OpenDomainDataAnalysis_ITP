		<content>   Hillhead and Smithycroft are owned  
 by the Beaton family and are part of a
 unit which also includes Airyhillock. 
 These 313 acres have been in the      
 family for 22 years.                  
   Although the unit is run as a mixed 
 farming unit,the main enterprise is   
 poultry.They keep 17 500 Warren breed 
 hens which eat 16 tons of food per    
 week and produce 83 000 eggs per week.
 The hens are bought in at 18 weeks old
 and are housed in cages for their     
 laying life which is approx.11 months.
   Mr Beaton also keeps 350 fattening  
 cattle which he buys as calves at ten 
 days old and keeps for 18 months      
 till slaughtering.Barley to feed the  
 cattle and grass are the main crops.
