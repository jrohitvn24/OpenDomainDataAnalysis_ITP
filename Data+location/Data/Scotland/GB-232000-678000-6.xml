		<content>{FAMILIES}HAVE CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS.
 THEY ARE SMALLER, MOST HAVING NOT MORE
 THAN TWO CHILDREN. THIS LEAVES THE    
 WOMENFOLK WITH MORE TIME, AND MANY    
 HAVE TAKEN A JOB OUTSIDE THE HOME.    
{GADGETS}ALSO CONTRIBUTE AND MANY ARE  
 CONSIDERED NECESSITIES. NO LONGER IS  
 MONDAY 'WASH DAY'! AUTOMATIC WASHING  
 MACHINES, TUMBLE DRYERS AND NON-IRON  
 MATERIALS SEE TO THAT. MANY MEN HELP  
 WITH THE CHILDREN AND THE HOUSEWORK.  
{FOOD}HAS UNDERGONE A REVOLUTION, BUT  
 MAY BE COMING FULL CYCLE. IN RECENT   
 YEARS CONVENIENCE FOODS HAVE BEEN     
 WIDELY USED, BUT ARE COMING UNDER     
 SUSPICION! THE COMBINATION OF FREEZER 
 AND MICROWAVE OVEN IS FASHIONABLE.    
 WHOLEFOODS ARE IN DEMAND.             
{PETS -}CATS AND DOGS ARE POPULAR. A   
 FEW FAMILIES HAVE PONIES.             
{HEATING}IS MAINLY BY GAS, ALTHOUGH    
 THE COAL FIRE IS RE-APPEARING.        </content>
