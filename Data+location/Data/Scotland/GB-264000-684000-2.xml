		<content> I started to become interested in     
{birdwatching}when I was 9 years old.  
 Most often I go at weekends in summer.
 I set off at 5.30am to 7.0am and I'm  
 usually back by lunch time.           
                                       
 I wear walking boots and carry a bag  
 with my snack, notebook, pencil and   
 waterproofs. Round my neck I carry my 
 binoculars.                           
                                       
 My usual places for birdwatching are  
 the Carron Reservoir, the Endrick, the
 Lade and Culcreuch Woods. I use my    
 notebook to write a small piece and   
 draw a rough sketch of what I've seen.
                                       
 My favourite birds are great crested  
 grebes, redshanks, tree creepers and  
 buzzards. One of the best sightings   
 this year was the kingfisher, which I 
 saw by the Endrick. I am now eleven.  </content>
