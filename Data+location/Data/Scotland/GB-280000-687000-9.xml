		<title>09THE M9 MOTORWAY  PLEAN/COWIE</title>
		<content>   The M9 motorway affected the area   
 when it was opened. The Sauchenford   
 smallholdings were divided in half by 
 the motorway. The local people        
 unsuccessfully objected to their      
 community being split into two. A     
 local service station lost trade      
 selling petrol but has made a new     
 business by recovering crashed and    
 broken down vehicles on the motorway  
 and now employs about 15 people.      
   Building has commenced at the site  
 of a farmhouse now demolished at the  
 Pirnhall roundabout, and next year    
 there will be a Motel, a restaurant   
 and a filling station.
