		<title>02A LITTLE VILLAGE:MENSTRIE.</title>
		<content> Menstrie has a mass of approximately  
 thousands three,                      
 We live in estates which have started 
 many a family tree.                   
 It has a pub near the burn and hotel, 
 And when the wind blows there's a     
 yeasty smell;                         
 In our little village called Menstrie.
                                       
 It houses a company; the D.C.L,       
 Which has labs, vats and tennis courts
 as well.                              
 Against a blackcloth of hills so      
 grand,                                
 The Devon flows past near at hand;    
 To our little village called Menstrie.
