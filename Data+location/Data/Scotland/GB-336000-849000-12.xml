		<title>12Seed Potato Export _ Mulben</title>
		<content> When I was visiting a Farm at Mulben I
 saw a field of patatoes,and I asked   
 the farmer about them.  He told us    
 that when they are harvested in       
 Autumn, they are not sold to be eaten,
 but are exported as {seed potatoes    
 They are grown to be exported to hot  
 countries as seed for their potato    
 crop.The seed potatoes are sent to    
 Portugal, Cuba, Ceylon, Israel,       
 Morocco, Algeria and Italy.           
 The seed potatoes are packed like     
 apples in boxes for export.  They are 
 taken from Keith, by train, to  Leith,
 and from Leith to their destination by
 ship.                                 
 Seed potatoes from the North of       
 Scotland grow very well in hot        
 countries.  The seed potatoes are a   
 Dutch variety. They are inspected by  
 the Dept. of Agriculture before       
 planting and when they are growing.   </content>
