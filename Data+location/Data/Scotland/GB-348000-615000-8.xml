		<title>08KATHERINE ELLIOT CENTRE.</title>
		<content> The Katherine Elliot Centre is one of 
 the main day centres in the Borders   
 caring for handicapped people. It is  
 situated just off the main A7 Hawick  
 to Edinburgh road, close to the town  
 centre. The centre was opened in l973 
 and it was named after a local        
 landowner Baroness Elliot, who        
 contributed some of the funds, and it 
 has since been visited by a number of 
 important people, including the Queen.
 We interviewed Mr. Norman who runs the
 centre and also spoke to his deputy   
 manager. The centre is used to look   
 after both mentally and physically    
 handicapped adults. They come from as 
 far away as Melrose, Kelso and        
 Jedburgh and travel in a minibus. Most
 members come five days a week but some
 come in less than this. The centre    
 opens at 9 a.m. and the members arrive
 after this and leave at 4 p.m.        </content>
