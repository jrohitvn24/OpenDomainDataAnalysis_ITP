		<content> The oldest gravestone is dated 1727.  
 In 1841 the death of local farmer John
 Ritchie, cattle breeder, is remembered
 by his memorial stone showing a cow,  
 curling stones and brooms - his hobby.
 A sheaf of wheat is shown too.        
 The roof of the church has crow steps 
 and a bell dated 1484-1515 and the    
 "Thomes Potter me made". The bell is  
 rung by a chain hanging outside the   
 church.                               
 In the field next to the church is a  
 boundry stone marked K on one side and
 C on the other.                       
 The name Tibbermore comes from the    
 Gaelic - well of Mary. The Lady Well  
 has been filled, and no trace remains.
