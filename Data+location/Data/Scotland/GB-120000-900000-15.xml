		<title>15Fishing Around Rhenigidale</title>
		<content> Included in this block are some areas 
 of sea. {Loch Seaforth}and {Loch      
{Trollamarig}are extensively used by   
 the{Scalpay, Harris }fishing boats.   
 They fish for prawns, clams and       
 lobsters in the more sheltered waters 
 and for white fish elsewhere. The     
 fishing boat that usually brings in   
 our supplies{The M.V. Girl Morag,}sets
 creels to catch prawns in the area    
 around the village. Small fish called{
{'cuddies'}can be caught in the bay at 
 Rhenigidale using a fishing rod and a 
 line and it is also possible to go out
 in a small boat and use lines with    
 feathers to catch mackerel and smaller
 white fish around the shore line and  
 the reefs. Some of the sheltered areas
 are being used to cultivate mussels.  
 Ropes are hung onto wooden rafts and  
 mussels grow on the ropes for 2 years 
 until they are big enough to be sold. </content>
