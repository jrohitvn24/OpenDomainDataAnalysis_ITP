		<title>04FARMING IN 1985</title>
		<content> The main difference between farming in
 1911 and now is that all farms have   
 electricity and machinery.{Tractors   
 have replaced horses and there are    
 fewer farm workers. In Shapinsay only 
 three farms have servants.            
 The main crop is{silage}but some      
{barley}is also grown.The first cut is 
 usually in the last week of June.     
{Combining}takes place  from the end   
 of September to  1st or 2nd week in   
 November.Small farms are done by      
 contractors.                          
 Until 20 years ago there were only    
{Aberdeen Angus}beasts at cattle shows.
 After that{Herefords}were popular but 
 now most people buy{Charolais}because 
 they are fast growers .At 15-18 months
 the calves weigh more than a 2 year   
 old Aberdeen Angus.
