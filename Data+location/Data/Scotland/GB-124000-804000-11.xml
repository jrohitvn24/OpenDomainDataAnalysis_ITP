    Despite the fact that householders 
 pay rates, all of the domestic        
 services are provided by the estate.  
                                       
     WATER                             
          Water for each household is  
 supplied from one of the naturally    
 occurring springs on the hillside. One
 spring is utilised on Sanday, four on 
 Canna. Water can be in very short     
 supply during the summer and          
 occasionally the springs dry up       
 altogether. The NTS are trying to     
 improve the water supply by increasing
 the volume of the holding tanks and   
 replacing the old asbestos supply     
 pipes with polythene pipe. If more    
 houses are built there is still likely
 to be a problem though.
