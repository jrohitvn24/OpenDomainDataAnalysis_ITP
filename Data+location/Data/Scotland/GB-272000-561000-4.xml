		<title>04Threave Estate</title>
		<content> Threave Estate used to belong to Major
 A E Gordon. It was presented to the   
 National Trust in 1948. The late Major
 Gordon insisted that the wildfowl     
 should be preserved. In winter, lots  
 of birds such as geese and ducks come 
 to the River Dee.                     
 The National Trust has put up a new   
 bird hide because the old one was     
 beginning to rot.                     
 In summer, ducks, pheasants and       
 pigeons nest on Threave Island.       
 One year the island was flooded and   
 most of the rabbits were drowned. Now 
 there are only a few rabbits left on  
 the island.                           
 The estate itself includes four dairy 
 farms and 94 acres of woodland.
