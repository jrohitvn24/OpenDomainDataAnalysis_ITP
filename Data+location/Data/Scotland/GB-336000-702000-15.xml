		<content>  For anyone with an interest in       
 animals,Leven is an ideal holiday     
 centre.As well as the resident four-  
 legged attractions(like retired       
 racehorse,Big Ginger)at Letham Glen   
 and Silverburn,there are occasional   
 appearances by celebrity animals such 
 as Glen Michael's terrier Rusty.      
  By far the best known animal star to 
 visit Leven,however,is Hercules the   
 Bear.A European brown bear,he will be 
 at Letham Glen from the 9th of June   
 and will be there every Tuesday until 
 the 20th of August.He will join in    
 teddy bears parades and he will be    
 wrestling with his owner Andy Robins. 
 Hercules weighs just over half a ton. 
 His favourite food is baked beans.    
 Believe it or not, he is frightened of
 caterpillars_Big Softy!
