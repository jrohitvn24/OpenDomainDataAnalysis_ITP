		<content> My house is situated in Lindsay Drive,
 Wick. It stands on it's own in a      
 private housing scheme with 4 other   
 houses, and more being built. We have 
 2 living rooms, 3 bedrooms, 2 toilets 
 and 1 utility room. There is a big    
 garden, with a vegetable patch and a  
 green house with tomatoe plants. My   
 room and my sisters room has got built
 in cupboards to store our belongings. 
 The kitchen is where we have our meals
 unless something is good on T.V., when
 we go into the small living room. I   
 have a snooker table in the loft      
 because it is floored. My house is a  
 very modern one with electric central 
 heating. The windows are double glazed
 to keep in the heat. We have one gas  
 fire which warms up the living room.
