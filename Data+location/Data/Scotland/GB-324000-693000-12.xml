		<title>12Begg Farm, Kirkcaldy</title>
		<content> The {Begg farm}is of 550 acres most of
 which is grazing for cattle. About one
 quarter is for wheat, barley, oats,   
 peas and potatoes. There are four     
 kinds of cattle : Ayrshire, Holstein, 
 Fresians and Romanola. Bullocks and   
 lambs are brought in for fattening    
 over the Winter. In another part of   
 the farm is a disused milking parlour 
 which had to abandoned when the       
 European Community decided to cut the 
 amount of milk that farmers were      
 allowed to produce. This would reduce 
 the European 'milk lake'. Cattle from 
 the farm have won prizes at           
 agricultural shows throughout         
 Scotland. A new crop that is being    
 grown is oil-seed rape which has a    
 very bright yellow flower. The crop   
 produces oil for using in cattle food.
