		<title>01The Principal Features</title>
		<content>    The lighthouse is an impressive    
 sight. It dominates the river mouth   
 guiding the ships in. Another         
 principal feature is the hill,        
 commonly known as the Braes, sloping  
 steeply up along one side of the river
 South Esk. The Anat Bank is a         
 dangerous shallow sandbank on which   
 many ships have been wrecked.         
    The Montrose side of the river is  
 quite sandy but the other side is     
 rocky. On the North side of the river 
 is the Glaxo chemical factory, the    
 biggest employer in Montrose. Still by
 the river is the lifeboat station. It 
 is no longer used but it is still     
 interesting to look at. The lifeboat  
 is now moored in the river.           
    Perhaps the most striking feature  
 is the Links, the biggest tourist     
 attraction. It has two golf courses   
 and a pitch and putt course.          </content>
