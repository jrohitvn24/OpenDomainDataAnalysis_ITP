		<content> The scale of recent changes in farming
 practices is evident countrywide.The  
 most conspicuous of those that have   
 affected the Lindean area may be      
 summarised thus:1.Two dairy herds have
 been sold.2.Many farm workers have    
 been replaced by travelling           
 contractors.3.Rotational cropping has 
 been abandoned in favour of winter    
 barley.4.A small estate has been      
 dismantled and partly sold in small   
 lots.5.A local "smiddy" no longer     
 exists.6.A local joiner's workshop is 
 now a house.7.A local corn mill has   
 gone out of business and has been     
 converted to use as a glass factory   
 and house.8.Outlandish breeds of      
 cattle and sheep have to some extent  
 displaced traditional breeds.         
 9.Artificial fertilisers and          
 chemical sprays are now commonplace.
