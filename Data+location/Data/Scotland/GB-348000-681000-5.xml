		<title>05A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ......</title>
		<content>   My name is Alastair and on a typical
 day I will rise at 07:00 to find a cup
 of tea at my bedside.When I get up I  
 may play on my computer before having 
 breakfast;toast,cereal and coffee.    
   School starts at 09:00 and finishes 
 at 15:20.During that time we work at  
 Maths,English and Environmental       
 studies among other things.           
   On returning home I either work on  
 my computer or I watch television.    
   On Monday evenings I go to badminton
 club where we play each other and     
 occasionally we have tournaments.On   
 Tuesday evenings I go to swimming club
 where we swim,dive and race each      
 other.                                
   Other evenings are mainly spent     
 golfing,computing and playing tennis. 
   At night as 21:30 is approaching,so 
 is bedtime.                           
                                       </content>
