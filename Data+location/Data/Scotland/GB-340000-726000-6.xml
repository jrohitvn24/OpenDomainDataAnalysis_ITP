		<content> There is one police station in our    
 area with eight policemen and one     
 sergeant. They cover Newport on Tay   
 section by car in case of emergencies.
 The most common crime committed is    
 malicious mischief. The police deal   
 with this as well as licences, sheep  
 dipping, dead bodies etc..            
 Car crashes occur quite often because 
 of the A914 nearby. Unfortunately,    
 policemen can't teach children road   
 safety, as they can't say for certain 
 whether they would be able to attend  
 reglarly.                             
 There are no special squads but the   
 air base at Leuchars is near our area 
 with emergency air-sea rescue         
 equipment at hand.
