		<content> Most ghost stories in Port Glasgow are
 centred round Newark{Castle,}one of   
 the oldest buildings in the town. This
 has a 'menagerie of spooks' and white 
 ladies.                               
       Another story is that of the    
 "Bogle Stane" a large piece of granite
 in the Port which people say the      
 druids danced about worshiping their  
 heathen gods.                         
              Maybe the most famous    
{supernatural}story of Port Glasgow is 
 that of the Highland warrior, Wallace.
 He, it was said, was chased by the    
 English to a tree which is now in Holy
 Family church grounds, and was speared
 to death with arrows. You can still   
 see today the shackles on the tree    
 that held him as he died. And every   
 year on his anniversary it is said you
 can hear the brave Scotsman die.
