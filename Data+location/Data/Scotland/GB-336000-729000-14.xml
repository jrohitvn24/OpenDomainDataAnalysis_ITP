		<title>14MORGAN TOWER, DUNDEE</title>
		<content>{ Morgan Tower}was built by{Samuel Bell
 in 1794.Tradition has it that the     
 oriental features were at the request 
 of its original sea captain owner,    
 Morgan.The thickness of the walls, the
 survival of huge blocks of red        
 sandstone at the rear,the survival of 
 the well and a peculiar U-Shaped      
 building behind the adjacent terrace, 
 together with an early legend that    
 Morgan converted rather than built his
 own tower and the knowledge that this 
 corner of Dundee was at the far       
 western extremity within the town of  
 1548,all lead to the possibility that 
 the history of this corner may be more
 interesting than the accepted dating  
 of the late 18th century suggests.    
  A{five-storey bow}projects into the  
 pavement; it has{Venetian windows, a  
{Saracen's hat roof}and a{Muslim moon  
 as a weathervane.                     </content>
