		<title>16TRAFFIC COUNT</title>
		<content> We counted the traffic on the road    
 from St Andrews to Cupar, the time    
 1415 hours to 1515 hours.  There have 
 been many accidents on this road and  
 it is fairly busy all the time.  The  
 result of this traffic count was 674  
 vehicles going to and from St Andrews.
 There was a total of 527 cars, 40     
 commercial vehicles, 77 light vans, 6 
 buses, 6 taxis, 5 coaches, 4 motor    
 bicycles, 3 scooters, 2 cars and      
 caravans and 4 bicycles.  This road is
 used for commercial use quite often as
 it is midway between the city of      
 Dundee and St Andrews.
