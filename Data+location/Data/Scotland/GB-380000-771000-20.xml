		<title>20Health in Inverbervie Area</title>
		<content> The health of the people in our area  
 is looked after by{three doctors, four
{nurses and two health visitors.}Their 
 base is at the Health Centre,         
 Kirkburn, Inverbervie, formerly an old
 school. The doctors hold daily        
 surgeries seeing on average fifty     
 people each day. They also make       
 roughly twenty house calls per day.   
 The nurses' duties include doing      
 dressings, giving injections,         
 assisting doctors and visiting the    
 elderly while the health visitors look
 after the pre-school children.        
 As well as antenatal, child assessment
 and "well baby" clinics, we can have  
 treatment from the Chiropodist, advice
 from a dietician and physiotherapy,   
 the last being financed by a trust so 
 only those resident in Inverbervie get
 this treatment free. Our nearest      
 hospitals are in Aberdeen and Brechin.</content>
