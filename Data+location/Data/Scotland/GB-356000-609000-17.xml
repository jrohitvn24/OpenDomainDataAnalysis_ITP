 animal feed and for cash sales.{      
{TURNIPS}are grown to feed sheep in    
 winter,and{GRASS}is stored as hay or  
 silage.Silage pits have become an     
 increasingly common feature in recent 
 years.{BARLEY}is a main crop in our   
 block,being used for feeding stock, or
 the better yields sold for malting to 
 the brewers and distillers.The straw  
 from the barley is baled to use as    
 bedding.Contractors with Combine      
 Harvesters are hired when needed,and  
 tractors with round or square balers  
 are owned by the farms.               
 The  summer of 1985,this year         
 of our survey,has been the wettest in 
 living memory and many farmers have   
 suffered heavy losses. Although no-one
 in this block has gone out            
 of business, many others elsewhere    
 have.                                 </content>
