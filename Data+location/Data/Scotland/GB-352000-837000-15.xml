		<title>15THE BY-PASS HUNTLY</title>
		<content> The Huntly by pass is the main road   
 that runs past Huntly diverting       
 traffic away from the town.  The      
 by-pass prevents traffic running      
 through Duke St, a main street in     
 Huntly. I asked some shopkeepers in   
 that street if this had affected their
 trade any. Centra (SUPERMARKET),"No,  
 not at all". Newsagent, "There is a   
 slight differance in the              
 summertime,but other times not at     
 all". Co-op (SUPERMARKET),"No,no      
 difference at all" Small newsagents   
 ,"Good, as the one way traffic can    
 stop and there are no large vehicles  
 shaking the building". So the opinions
 are mixed. The By-pass was officialy, 
 opened in 1979. The Garden centre,    
 built beside the By-pass, has a       
 restaurant,car park and allows bus    
 parties, so really,it takes its trade 
 from the By-pass.                     </content>
