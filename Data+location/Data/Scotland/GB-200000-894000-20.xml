		<content>                                       
    BECAUSE OF ITS WINDSWEPT POSITION  
 BETWEEN 2 ARMS OF THE SEA,SCORAIG HAD 
 VERY FEW TREES AND SUPPORTED THE KIND 
 OF WILDLIFE USUALLY FOUND ON MOORLAND 
 AND ROCKY SHORE.IN THE LAST 40 yrs    
 THOUSANDS OF TREES WERE PLANTED. THIS 
 HAS CHANGED THE ENVIRONMENT ROUND THE 
 CROFTS.HEDGEHOGS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED 
 AND THERE IS A GREATER VARIETY OF     
 SMALL BIRDS.THERE ARE FEWER STARLINGS 
 AND,BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED HUMAN    
 POPULATION,BUZZARDS AND OTHER BIRDS OF
 PREY ARE LESS EVIDENT.FEW PESTICIDES  
 OR CHEMICAL FERTILISERS ARE USED ON   
 SCORAIG.RED DEER WERE A PROBLEM TO    
 CROFTERS.THEY USED TO BREAK IN.THEN A 
 DEER FENCE WAS BUILT ACROSS THE PENIN-
 SULA ABOUT 250m FROM THE TOP OF THE   
 HIGHEST CROFT.THE POPULATION OF RABBIT
 DROPPED SINCE MYXOMATOSIS.WILDCATS AND
 FOXES ENDANGER POULTRY AND LAMBS.     </content>
