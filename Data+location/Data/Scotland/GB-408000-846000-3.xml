  The week starts on a Sunday at       
 midnight.The partner boats  set off to
 their fishing grounds at Flugga,at the
 speed of 10 knots.The journey will    
 take approximately 21 hours.During    
 this time there is constant contact   
 with other boats at sea.When they     
 reach the grounds the two boats take  
 it in turns to shoot the net.This     
 takes 15 minutes.The two boats stay   
 quarter of a mile apart and start     
 towing at a speed of three and a half 
 knots.The fish are then brought       
 aboard,gutted,washed and put into the 
 fish room.This operation goes on with 
 the crew snatching a few minutes sleep
 whenever they can.When all the fish   
 are sorted out the boat is thoroughly 
 cleaned and is scrubbed with          
 detergent.The boat then returns home  
 and the fish are sold at the market.  </content>
