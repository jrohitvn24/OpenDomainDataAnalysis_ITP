		<title>11THE COMMON RIDING</title>
		<content>  The patrols of the Town's lands were 
 carried out on an regular basis as and
 when it was felt necessary.  The      
 patrols became known as a rideout and 
 the whole event became formalised in  
 a Common Riding.  The frequency of the
 rideout diminished until it was only  
 an annual event.  Until this year     
 (1985) only the North Marches were    
 ridden, however the 450th anniversary 
 of the granting off the Royal Charter 
 was used as reason to send riders once
 again round the traditional route.    
 Most of the route covered is within   
 this block of the Domesday project.   
 Common Ridings are a unique feature of
 the Border towns and many people ffrom
 all over the world will return at the 
 time of the Common Riding.  The       
 Standard Bearer is elected from       
 amongst the local young men and must  
 be unmarried.                         </content>
