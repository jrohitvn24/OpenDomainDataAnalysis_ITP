		<content>{Kings Glen Primary School} begins at  
 9.10 every morning from Monday -      
 Friday.  We all sit at desks and we   
 have a teacher called Miss Urie.  We  
 use jotters to write in and we use    
 pencils or pens.  We use lots of      
 books. Our teacher uses chalk to write
 on the blackboard.                    
 Some of the {subjects} we do are      
 arithmetic, reading, writing,         
 spelling, music, art, environmental   
 studies, religious education, P.E. and
 our most recent acquisition is a BBC  
 micro{computer}                       
 We have 2 intervals when we go out to 
 play.  At lunchtime some people go    
 home, but most people have their lunch
 in school.                            
 The boys play football and marbles.   
 The girls play with skipping ropes and
 often play at tig.
