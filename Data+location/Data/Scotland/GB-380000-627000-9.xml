		<content> Yetholm, has a vibrant, active        
 community with thirty clubs or        
 societies for all ages. Clubs meet in 
 the school, the Wauchope Hall, the    
 Scout Hut or the pavilion. The Social 
 Club, formed in 1980 meets monthly    
 from October to March with a          
 membership of 150. Good management    
 ensures the presence of Scotlands top 
 country and western and folk music    
 performers. The ladies support the    
 Rural and Guild, the leek and flower  
 show clubs provide keen male intrest, 
 and both support the badminton. The   
 Youngsters attend cubs, brownies and  
 guides. Football and cricket teams    
 play in organised leagues but are     
 forced to import players. Festival and
 Spittal Trip are highlights in a busy 
 summer.All clubs are self supporting  
 and a feature of village life. The    
 Mission hold two meetings a week.     </content>
