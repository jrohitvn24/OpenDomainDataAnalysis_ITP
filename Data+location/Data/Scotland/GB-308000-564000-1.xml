		<title>01Sea-Lochar Estuary &amp; Solway</title>
		<content> More than 50% of this square consists 
 of the mouth of the Lochar, the merse 
 (saltings) &amp; the Solway Firth itself. 
 The hinterland is farmed on reclaimed 
 peat moss &amp; the merse provides grazing
 for cattle.   The shore line changes  
 over the years sometimes the sea makes
 inroads on the land and them recedes. 
 There is no fishing industry but the  
 local people still 'tramp' flounders  
 for their own use.   Local History:   
 There are interesting remains of salt 
 pans along the shore.   Salt-making   
 was until the end of the last century 
 a considerable industry here, the     
 right having been conferred by Robert 
 the Bruce.   Recreation: This is      
 wildfowling country - pink-feet geese 
 and greylag coming in quantities; but 
 the sport is well regulated by the    
 local association.
