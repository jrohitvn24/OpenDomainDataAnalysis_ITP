		<title>02Survey Of Local Attitudes</title>
		<content> A survey completed specially for the  
 Domesday Project questioned local     
 people about life in Britain in the   
 1980's and asked for their views of   
 the "state of the nation". 50% wanted 
 the electoral system changed to some  
 form of proportional representation , 
 40% wanted independence for Scotland, 
 95% were happy with the role of the   
 Royal Family in modern society, 85%   
 thought our society was too violent   
 and uncaring,95% thought the courts   
 were too lenient with law-breakers and
 80% wanted the Death Penalty          
 re-introduced. The general feeling was
 that society's values have changed.   
 People are more mercinary and "for    
 themselves",they  complain too much to
 authority and want too much done for  
 them, instead of striving to do things
 for themselves.
