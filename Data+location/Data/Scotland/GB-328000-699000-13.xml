		<title>13Children's Games in Fife</title>
		<content> In our schools there are many         
 different games that we play.In winter
 the most popular games are sliding on 
 the ice,sledging and having snowball  
 fights.If the weather is really bad we
 stay indoors and play chess or draw.In
 summer one of the most popular of     
 girl's games is skipping.Two people   
 each take an end of a rope and turn it
 in a wide circle by swinging their    
 arms.Somebody else stands in the      
 middle and skips over the rope.If they
 trip up that means they are out.Other 
 popular summer games are hide and seek
 and rounders.Most of us also have     
 bicycles and we play on them almost   
 all the year round.Another game which 
 never seems to lose its popularity is 
 marbles.In addition to these football 
 is played all year round by most boys 
 anywhere they can find to play it.
