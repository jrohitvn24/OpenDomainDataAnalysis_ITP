		<content>  One of the many pastimes people do   
 for profit is to gather "Tangles".    
  "Tangles" is the name that Orcadians 
 use for the kind of seaweed otherwise 
 called kelp or oarweed.               
  The tangle gatherer collects the     
 tangles which have been thrown up on  
 the beach by the sea.The gatherer then
 puts a steel rope around a bunch and  
 it is pulled up over the beach by a   
 tractor.It is then put together into  
 bigger piles and left to dry.When it  
 has finished drying the weight will   
 have decreased to about half the      
 original, and will have shrunk        
 to half the size of before drying.    
  The tangles are then transported to  
 the south of Scotland or England.     
  The tangles sell for approximately   
 Â£100 per ton.
