		<title>12THE HOLMS OF IRE</title>
		<content> There are 2 holms (tidal islets), the 
{"Outer Holm"}and the{"Inner Holm"}both
 stretching out from the north_west tip
 of Burness.Each one is joined by tidal
 rocks which are covered at high tide  
 making it possible to cross at low    
 tide only.Every person in Burness has 
 an equal claim to the Holms but at    
 this moment{Mr.J.Dearness}of{Scar}has 
 sheep grazing there.The{Inner Holm}is 
 smaller than the{Outer Holm}in width  
 and length.Together they stretch for 2
 miles.There are many buildings there  
 made from stone,one of them being a   
 small chapel where{St.Columba}was     
 supposed to have sent his missionaries
 The other buildings are small shepherd
 shelters where they stayed until it   
 was possible to get back across.It is 
 now a very isolated place where there 
 are thousands of{sea birds.}
