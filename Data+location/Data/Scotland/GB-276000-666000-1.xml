   THE EAST MONKLANDS LIE TO THE EAST  
 AND NORTH EAST OF THE TOWN OF AIRDRIE 
 AND COVER A LARGE SECTION OF{RURAL}   
 NORTH LANARKSHIRE. IT IS AN AREA WITH 
 A PROUD INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE IN        
{COALMINING}PARTICULARLY DURING THE    
 19TH AND EARLY 20TH CENTURIES. THE    
 AREA'S WEALTH LAY IN ITS ABUNDANT     
 SUPPLIES OF A VARIETY OF COALS AND    
 BLACKBAND IRONSTONE. THE INCREASING   
 DEMAND FOR COAL TO SUPPLY THE IRON AND
 STEEL INDUSTRY AROUND COATBRIDGE (IRON
 BURGH) TO THE WEST OF AIRDRIE, SAW THE
 NUMBER OF COAL MINES REACH A PEAK OF  
 ABOUT 100 IN THE 1830'S. RAILWAYS WERE
 CONSTRUCTED (NOW ALL DISMANTLED) E.G. 
 THE BALLOCHNEY RAILWAY TO TAKE THE    
 COAL TO THE IRONWORKS AND TO THE      
 MONKLAND CANAL FOR TRANSPORT TO THE   
 GLASGOW MARKET.                       </content>
