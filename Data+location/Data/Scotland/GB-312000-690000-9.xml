		<content> When the primary 7 pupils leave our   
 school they attend Beath High School  
 .Pupils come from 9 local schools to  
 be taught there.The pupils are divided
 into 4 houses with a guidance teacher 
 for each one .The  houses are named   
 Aitken, Glencraig, Kirkford and       
 Lindsay.They are named after          
 collieries which used to be used in   
 this area.Pupils are supposed to wear 
 school uniform  and the school colours
 are blue and pale grey.At Beath High  
 we will get extra subjects which we   
 don't get here,such as Science,       
 Biology, Home Economics,French and    
 Woodwork.1st and 2nd year pupils go   
 to Beath Junior and from 3rd year     
 upwards they attend Beath Senior which
 is a short distance away.
