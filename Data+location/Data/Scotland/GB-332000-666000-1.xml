		<title>01Gazateer entry for Dalkeith</title>
		<content> The area covered has as its focus the 
 town of Dalkeith, with a population at
 the 1981 census of 11,156. The        
 remainder of the area is a mixture of 
 farming land and estate land covered  
 by trees. The town of Dalkeith lies   
 approximately seven miles south of    
 Edinburgh and acts as a centre for    
 shopping, medical provision, education
 sporting activity and some employment 
 for its people and those living as far
 away as ten to fifteen miles to the   
 south and west. However many of the   
 population work in Edinburgh and      
 travel each day by either bus or      
 private car.
