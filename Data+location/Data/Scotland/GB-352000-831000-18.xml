		<content> A number of old customs have died out.
 Hogmany used to be the night for Santa
 Claus for some lucky children.Now all 
 youngsters are visited on the night   
 before Christmas."First-footing" by a 
 dark man is still practised as the New
 Year starts, but few carry a lump of  
 coal or peat.(It is now more likely to
 be a bottle of whisky). Burn's suppers
 are a very common feature of January. 
 April Gowk day is now the universal   
 April Fools' Day.Hallowe'en is still  
 kept with fancy-dress parties and     
 guizing (children dressing up and     
 carrying turnip lanterns)from house to
 house and providing a short entertain-
 ment in return for a small present.   
 Guy Fawkes is the same as elsewhere.  
 Birthdays call for "dookin" the       
 birthday child (wetting or splashing) 
 and "ruggin"(tugging )the hair the    
 same amount of times as years.        </content>
