		<title>02Kirkconnel:In my young days</title>
		<content> In 1928 the majority of boys leaving  
 school worked in the local pits.Others
 went to farms,learned trades or got   
 jobs in shops as message boys or      
 trained as grocers with the Co-op.    
 In the streets were water pumps in the
 shape of lions' heads with the water  
 coming from their mouths.The petrol   
 station used to be the{toll-house}and 
 it cost an old half-penny to use the  
 road which was then known as the Great
 Road.                                 
 During the war German bombs fell on   
 the railway line and the Co-op but    
 apart from these and of course the men
 who fell in battle, Kirkconnel escaped
 the worst.                            
 The men used to meet in the           
 Queensberry Arms or in the Reading    
 Room to talk about current events,    
 sport or politics.
