		<content> The harvest was slow, providing fun   
 and community spirit for all          
 participants, and lasting for weeks   
 whereas latterly she would see the    
 field on the morning of a school day  
 and by evening only bales were left - 
 quite a shock!                        
 The community used to have a moving   
 population - farm workers would be    
 employed for a year from either the   
 May or November term. If a man was    
 jobless then the community would team 
 up and help the family. Depopulation  
 has meant total loss of community     
 spirit which existed in the form of   
 Womens Guild, WRI, Whist Drives,      
 Dances, etc. Church roll and          
 attendance has not changed            
 significantly. Attendance used to     
 depend more strongly on the weather   
 when members walked to the service    
 whereas today the car is used.        </content>
