		<content> In 1977 a husband and wife-American   
 and Swedish-partnership of glass      
 designers/blowers set up a studio in  
 the disused Lindean corn mill using   
 techniques gained mainly in Sweden.The
 high quality of their skills was      
 quickly recognised by the acceptance  
 of exhibits for display in museums and
 galleries in Britain and Scandinavia  
 and by contracts with stores as far   
 afield as London,Japan and U.S.A.where
 40% of their products are sold.Another
 husband and wife team of painters in  
 water colour,with a particular        
 interest in plants and natural        
 history has established a reputation  
 for pictorial studies of prestigious  
 houses with borders of local wild     
 flowers-"personalised weeds".A local  
 farmworker is recognised as a master  
 craftsman in the decoration of        
 shepherds' crooks.                    </content>
