		<title>01The Parish of Ythanwells</title>
		<content>                                       
 The district gets its name from the   
 fact that the river Ythan starts here,
 flowing eastwards into the Northsea at
 Newburgh.It consists of gentle hills, 
 rising to about 1000ft above sealevel.
 It is mostly good farmland, with some 
 plantations of firtrees and only small
 strips of natural vegetation of whins,
 broom, rushes and heather left. It is 
 sparsely populated, as many crofts    
 have been amalgamated to make viable  
 farming units for a family. Most of   
 the farms are rented from the Bognie  
 Estate.Each farmhouse lies isolated in
 its own fields.In recent years several
 old crofthouses have been restored by 
 people in oilrelated industries, who  
 commute to Aberdeen.
