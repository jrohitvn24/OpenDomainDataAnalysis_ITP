		<title>11MUGDOCK COUNTRY PARK</title>
		<content> The land for this park was donated by 
{Sir Hugh Fraser}in 1980 to Central    
 Regional Council.People can walk      
 around,fish,have picnics,and see the  
 country side.It is open to the public 
 and noone has to pay to get in.There  
 are two rangers who can take you for  
 tours,guide you on nature trails or   
 talk about the history of the two     
 castles;Mugdock Castle and Craigend   
 Castle                                
      There is a loch called Mugdock   
 Loch which has a large variety of     
 water life.Above it stands Mugdock    
 castle dating from the 13th century   
 and ones owned by the{Dukes of        
{Montrose.}In recent years the old     
 buildings have become unsafe and much 
 repair is needed.A stone mason has    
 been employed so that the castle can  
 be repaired.
