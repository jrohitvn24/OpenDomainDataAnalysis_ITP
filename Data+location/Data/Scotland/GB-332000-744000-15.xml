		<title>15EASSIE SCHOOL AND CHURCH</title>
		<content> Our school was built in 1929, when the
 roll was 138. At that time the old    
 school was still being used to        
 accomodate the infant department.     
 Children completed their education    
 here and left school at the age of    
 fourteen.Eassie School is now a       
 primary school and we go on to        
 Webster's High School, Kirriemuir,    
 aged twelve. The roll just now is 28. 
                                       
 Eassie Church was built in 1833. In   
 1936 there was a linkage with Kirkinch
 and in 1966 it was linked with        
 Newtyle.The Communion Roll is now 92.
