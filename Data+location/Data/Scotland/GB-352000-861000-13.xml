		<title>13LIFE  STYLES  IN  FORDYCE</title>
		<content> Life in Fordyce has changed a little  
 since a licensed Restaurant opened in 
 1984,for this has brought more        
 visitors in from surrounding towns and
 countryside to a village well hidden  
 and off the beaten track.People who do
 not own a private car,must travel     
 mainly by taxi-cab based in Portsoy,  
 for there is only one regular weekly  
 bus which runs each Thursday,leaving  
 Fordyce at 9.4o a.m. for Banff and    
 returning at l2.30 p.m. Passengers may
 use the school bus which leaves for   
 Banff each weekday at 8 a.m. and comes
 back  at 4.30p.m. The Post Office van 
 visits each day except Sunday,there   
 being one delivery and one collection 
 daily. Visits are made by Bakers,     
 Butchers,Fishmongers,Dairy and Drapery
 vans and a mobile library calls each  
 fortnight. Policemen,based in Portsoy,
 only occasionally visit the village.  </content>
