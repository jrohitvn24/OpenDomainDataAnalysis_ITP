		<title>15Linwood Shopping Centre</title>
		<content>   Linwood has a wide variety of shops,
 though many are now lying empty.      
 Several shop units have never been    
 leased and others such as{Woolworth   
 and{Spar}have given up their leases.  
   The{shopping centre}is located at   
 the centre of the old village but now 
 lies on the outskirts of the new town 
 due to the growth of new housing. Most
 of the shopping facilities required   
 are available in the centre and many  
 of the shops provide{work experience  
 for pupils from both the local        
 Secondary schools.                    
   Due to the high level of            
 unemployment in Linwood since the     
 closure of the car factory, a{Job     
{Centre}has been opened in the town.   
 Other shops include{supermarkets, Post
{Office, Newsagent, Banks, Chemists,   
{Electrical Shop, Bakery, Cafe,        
{Butchers, Hairdressers}and{Baby Shop. </content>
