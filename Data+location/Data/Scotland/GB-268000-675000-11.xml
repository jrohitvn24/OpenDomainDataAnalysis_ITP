		<content>     Kilsyth Main Street is quite a    
 long street. There are several side   
 streets leading from it. It has four  
 empty shops but some new ones have    
 been built at the top of the town.    
 There is one public bar,the Scarecrow,
 which is also a restaurant.           
     A stream runs through the town and
 there is the remains of an old railway
 bridge too.                           
     Many Kilsyth people do their      
 grocery shopping in West Burnside     
 Street,at the supermarket. Other shops
 sell confectionery, hardware and      
 stationery. There are about five      
 bakeries. Although there are some     
 clothes shops,most people prefer to go
 to Glasgow, Kirkintilloch, Falkirk or 
 Stirling for clothes.                 
     Some people use a mail order      
 catalogue because it is more          
 convenient.                           </content>
