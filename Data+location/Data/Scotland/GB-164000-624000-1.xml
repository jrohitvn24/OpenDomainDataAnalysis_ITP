		<title>01Coast &amp; Farms W Kintyre</title>
		<content> This is an area of great natural      
 beauty where wildlife exists in       
 abundance.   The land has been farmed 
 for many generations by the same      
 families using largely traditional    
 methods, modern techniques only       
 adopted where not precluded by the    
 demands of the area.   The dairy farm 
 is the main feature locally but sheep 
 &amp; beef rearing are also prominent with
 some arable usage for winter feed     
 forestry commission plantations appear
 on the upper slopes.   The shore is   
 beaten by atlantic gales.             
 Practically uninhabited &amp;             
 uncommercialised it attracts the      
 discerning visitor all year.   There  
 is a strong community identity and    
 little will have changed in the last  
 twenty years despite the presence of  
 RAF &amp; US naval personnel nearby.      
 Kilchenzie is a residential hamlet    </content>
