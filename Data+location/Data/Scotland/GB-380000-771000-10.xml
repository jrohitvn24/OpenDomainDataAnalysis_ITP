		<title>10Local History in Inverbervie</title>
		<content> We visited an old age pensioner who   
 has lived in Inverbervie for forty    
 five years. He lives in Market Square 
 opposite the{Market Cross.}The last   
 time the{town crier}made a            
 proclamation there was for the Queen's
 Coronation in 1952.                   
 Before retiring he used to drive a    
 flax lorry for one of the{nine flax}  
{mills,}only one of which is in use    
 today. He also used to be a magistrate
 who dealt out punishment to petty     
 criminals.                            
 As a boy he played football, hoops and
 golf on a small six hole golf course  
 in front of Peattie Farm.             
 He also told us that the site on which
 the school is now once belonged to the
 Church of Scotland and the minister   
 grazed his horses on what is now our  
 playing field. He can also remember   
 greenhouses where Hillview Gardens are</content>
