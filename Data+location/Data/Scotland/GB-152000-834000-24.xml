<title>24Gaelic Lanuage on Raasay 2011</title>
<content>

On Raasay there are not a lot of people who speak Gaelic, round about forty people speak it. In Raasay Primary School the teacher teaches Gaelic because she speaks Gaelic. There are a lot of Gaelic signs, they usually have the English at the top and the Gaelic at the bottom.Sometimes the Gaelic is the wrong way round in English but in Gaelic it&amp;#39;s the right way round! This is because in Gaelic the noun is before the verb.We have Gaelic singers visiting the island and the school and some of them perform in the new hall. We leave Primary School with a knowledge of basic Gaelic and French. Jennifer P5   &lt;br />
