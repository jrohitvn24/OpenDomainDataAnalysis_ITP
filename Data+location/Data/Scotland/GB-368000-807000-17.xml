 Christmas gives all the children a    
 present.We also have a Hallowe'en     
 party.We bake cakes and biscuits and  
 duck for apples.We have a fancy-dress

 Primary VII spent a week at the       
 Ballater outdoor centre on a field    
 course and environmental project.Some 
 children go for a week's ski-ing      
 instruction.In summer we go           
 on hill-walks.We have various         
 educational outings connected         
 with project work.We often have       
 concerts.We had one for the senior    
 citizens when we sang and recited     
 poetry learned for the annual Burns   
 competition.In summer we enter the    
 inter-school sports and compete in    
 football, netball and badminton       
 matches.
