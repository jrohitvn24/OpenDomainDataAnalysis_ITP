		<title>06LONGFORGAN - THE KNAPP I -</title>
		<content> The Knapp village known locally as    
 "the Knapp", consists of a dozen or so
 houses. Formerly an estate village,   
 most houses are now privately owned by
 professional people who work in       
 Dundee.It is rural in character and   
 yet only 15 minutes by car from the   
 city. This makes it a very much sought
 after residential area. The Knapp     
 village has partly lost its sense of  
 community. Its size and lack of a     
 natural meeting place such as a shop  
 or bus stop, and the dependence on    
 cars have isolated its residents. As a
 result all social activities are held 
 in the larger surrounding villages.   
 The Knapp burn and the areas mature   
 woodland, part of which has been very 
 recently harvested and replanted still
 supports a variety of wildlife, and   
 makes it a very pleasant place in     
 which to live and raise a family.     </content>
