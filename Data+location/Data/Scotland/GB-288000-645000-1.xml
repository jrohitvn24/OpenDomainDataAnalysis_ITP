		<content> The block is mainly farmland with most
 of the interesting features in the    
 four southerly squares. The River     
 Mouse runs through these four squares 
 in a step and often dangerous gorge   
 with many cliffs. Most of the gorge is
 an area of special scientific interest
 and is owned by the nature conservancy
 council. There is a wide variety of   
 trees in the gorge. There are three   
 glasshouse establishments growing     
 mainly tomatoes for which the Clyde   
 Valley is famous. Two of the three now
 grow using the hydroponic system. The 
 only community is a Cleghorn where    
 some are employed at the metal and    
 welding works at Cleghorn junction.   
 Most people who are employed travel to
 Lanark or further afield for work.    
 Temporary labour is hired for the     
 tomato glasshouses late spring to     
 early autumn. Conifers are found      </content>
