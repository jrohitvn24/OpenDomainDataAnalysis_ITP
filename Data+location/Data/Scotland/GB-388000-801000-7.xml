 Primary School,was officially opened  
 in 1974.It is intended to serve the   
 needs of the local community by       
 providing various facilities.It offers
 a wide range of social,educational and

 The running of the centre is          
 undertaken by a management committee, 
 whose membership is composed of centre
 users acting in a voluntary capacity.

 is open Monday-Friday at 10.00am -

 member to make use of these           
 facilities.
