		<title>05Pitgaveny in Bourtie</title>
		<content> Pitgaveny hill in bourtie stands, at  
 773 feet, the highest point of land in
 the parish, visible 20 miles away from
 the outskirts of Aberdeen. On occasion
 it has been named Lawel Hill by       
 mapmakers, and there is a farm on its 
 south side which still oes y the name 
 of Lowhillside, but its original      
 derivation is Pictish, pict-goval-ny, 
 meaning the settlement of the high    
 priest of the Picts.  No official     
 archaelogical excavation has ever been
 carried out here, but in dry summers  
 the crop marks of the foundations of  
 two settlements can be clearly seen on
 the north slope of Pitgaveny.  Flint  
 tools are regular finds.  Hillfarm    
 subsides are provided for the farmers 
 who use the top of the hill of sheep  
 grazing, but the lower slopes provide 
 excellent soil for crops of silage    
 winter barley.                        </content>
