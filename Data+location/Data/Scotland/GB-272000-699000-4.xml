		<content> Mrs Brown's house is a{modern flat    
 which is 8 years old.There are 6 rooms
 in her flat which includes 3 bedrooms,
 a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom. 
 Mrs Brown likes the situation of her  
 house as she looks on to the park and 
 can hear the voices of young people   
 playing. She has central heating which
 is under the floor. The garden is     
 communal which means the flats are not
 very suitable for families with pets  
 or children.                          
 Mrs Gallacher's house is a{modern     
{semi-detached council house}with 3    
 bedrooms, lounge, kitchen and         
 bathroom. She likes the house apart   
 from the glass front and back doors   
 which slam in the through draught, and
 the warm air central heating          
 system. The house is in a good place  
 for the sun, especially the back      
 garden.                               </content>
