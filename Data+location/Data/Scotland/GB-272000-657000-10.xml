		<title>10ROMAN BATH-HOUSE</title>
		<content> The Romans came to this area about{140
 AD.  They built a fort with a garrison
 of about{500-600}soldiers on a hill   
 overlooking the South Calder Water.   
 The Bath House was discovered when a  
 digger driver, making paths in the    
{Strathclyde Country Park,}dug up some 
 red tiles.  Further investigation     
 revealed a carved drain cover, thought
 to be the best preserved of its kind  
 in Europe, which is now in a museum in
 London.  Archaeologists are not       
 allowed to dig at the site of the fort
 as it is in a protected habitat for   
 wildlife.                             
 This Bath House is the only standing  
 stone Roman remains in Scotland and is
 one of four bath houses open to the   
 public.  It is important to this area 
 as it is used for study by researchers
 and is also a very good tourist       
 attraction.                           </content>
