		<content> The unemploymet in our area is mainly 
 made up of youngsters.  There are a   
 few unemployed elders.  A few people  
 are out of work due to disablement.   
 The elders that are employed have a   
 range of different jobs.  There are a 
 few council workers.  There are also  
 gas, electricity and water board      
 workers. Quite a few people in our    
 grid are self employed.  Farming      
 provides a good deal of employment as 
 well.                                 
 In our grid there are 2 shops for the 
 whole area and 14 farms.  There are a 
 few home helps in our area.  There are
 also a couple of house-to-house       
 hairdressers.  There are some factory 
 workers in our area although the      
 factories are out of our grid.
