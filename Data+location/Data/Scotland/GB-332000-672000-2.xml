 This is one of the version s of how   
 Musselburgh got its motto of the      
 "honest toun".  The Earl of Mar, the  
 most important earl in Scotland went  
 to Wemyss Castle to have a feast.  But
 he never realised that it was a plot  
 to kill him.  While his guards and    
 himself were being served by servants,
 a monk poured a slow actin poison into
 his wine.  When he was passing        
 Wallyford the poison began to take    
 effect.  His guards went to get the   
 magistrates from Musselburgh.  They   
 rushed him to Pinkie House.  The towns
 folk looked after him but he died.  He
 was taken to St Michael's Kirk.  His  
 nephew awarded the town the title     
 "the honest toun"
