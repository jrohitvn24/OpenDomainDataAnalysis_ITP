		<content> There are two teachers in our school  
 and thirty five children The          
 headteacher who is our teacher is     
 called Mrs Dutton. She brngs in her   
 puppy, who is called Kim, every week  
 day. Our first interval is from       
 10.45am. to 11.15am. while our lunch  
 lasts an hour from 12.30 to 1.30pm.   
 After lunch we do a little bit of work
 e.g. crossword or dictionary and the  
 teacher tells us our homework.        
 On Tuesday mornings we have art with  
 our art teacher Mr Dunn. Unfortunately
 we do not get him every term. On      
 Tuesday afternoons we go to sewing    
 which the boys do not like. On Friday 
 after dinner we get Mr Burgess our    
 music teacher. School ends at 2.30pm. 
 The mini bus will pick up the first   
 lot of children, then it will come    
 back for the second lot of children   
 to take home.                         </content>
