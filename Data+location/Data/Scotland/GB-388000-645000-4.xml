		<title>04Boat Building  in Norham</title>
		<content> Douglas and his son Ian Simpson       
 continue Norhams tradition of building
 small open Angling and Salmon fishing 
 boats.                                
    They build two types of Angling    
 boat, one having a narrower stern than
 the other. These, as well as the      
 Salmon coble which they also build,   
 are of a very old design, being of    
 clinker construction.                 
    The bottoms of the boats are built 
 in Larch and the tops in white Pine,  
 to make them lighter.                 
    The Simpsons have been building    
 boats in Norham since 1904 and as well
 as this they are the local Joiners/   
 Undertakers.                          
    The boats are used on Salmon rivers
 all over the United Kingdom.
