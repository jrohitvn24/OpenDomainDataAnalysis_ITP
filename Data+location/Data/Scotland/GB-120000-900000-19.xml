		<content>{Animals}The main animal in this block 
 is sheep. Everyone here keeps sheep.  
 They also keep hens for eggs and there
 is 1 cow which provides most of the   
 milk for the village. The dogs are all
 sheepdogs and there are a lot of pet  
 cats.                                 
{Fuel}Each household cuts{peat}for     
 their own use. They are cut by a group
 of people usually. One uses the{peat  
{iron}to cut blocks (8inx8inx3in) and  
 another takes them and throws them out
 of the bog onto the area  around to   
 dry there. Once they have dried for a 
 week or so they are{lifted.}This means
 that about six of them are stacked    
 into small pyramids. Later they are { 
{gathered}into larger stacks and when  
 they have completely dried they are   
 put into bags or a{creel}and taken    
 home. They are then stored in a shed  
 or built into a{peat stack.}          </content>
