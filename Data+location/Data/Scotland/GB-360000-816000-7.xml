		<content> Forbes Estate owns the fishing rights 
 on the River Don for approximately 3  
 miles upstream and downstream of Keig 
 Bridge. The water is divided into six 
 beats which are let during the season 
 which runs from 11 February to 31     
 October for salmon and 15 March to 6  
 October for brown trout.              
 Two anglers are allowed to fish each  
 beat at any given time. Catches during
 1985 were good (approx. 90 salmon) as 
 the heavy rain kept the river level   
 high and allowed the fish to make     
 their run upstream from the river     
 mouth.                                
 Dedicated fishers come from all parts 
 of the U.K. to the Don, usually       
 booking the same beat for the same    
 period each year. Some French anglers 
 fish the river regularly as do several
 U.S. citizens visiting the area.
