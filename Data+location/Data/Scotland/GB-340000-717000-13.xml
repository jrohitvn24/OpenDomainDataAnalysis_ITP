		<content> My name is Jane Pickthall I live in   
 Osnaburgh Court in Dairsie in a timber
 framed house.It was built in 1974.    
 We have a garage for one car. I live  
 with my mum,dad,sister Claire and     
 Henry our dog. We have two gardens one
 at the front and one at the back. Our 
 back garden is fenced all round       
 because there is a field next door and
 Henry might escape. Our front garden  
 does not have and hedges or fences    
 only a lawn and flower beds. In our   
 house we have three bedrooms,a kitchen
 bathroom and dinette. Pauline lives   
 next door. Her house is exactly the   
 same but she has two split bedrooms,a 
 diningroom and a living room. Outside 
 she has not got a shed or patio and   
 she does not have her back garden     
 fenced in.
