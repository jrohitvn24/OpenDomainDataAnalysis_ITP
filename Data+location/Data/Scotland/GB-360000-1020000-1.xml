		<title>01ROTHIESHOLM HEAD</title>
		<content> Rothiesholm Head is practically all   
 covered in heather but there is some  
 cultivated land and rough grazing.    
 There are quite a few peat banks on   
 the Head. Peats are cut from the banks
 then are left to dry and are then     
 collected. Peats are like a substitute
 for coal, but many people use both    
 coal and peat. It is a Stronsay       
 tradition that only the people who    
 live in Rothiesholm can take peats    
 from the banks. There is a loch called
 Stranie Water which is said to be     
 bottomless but it is more likely that 
 it has a sinking bottom from the      
 peats.
