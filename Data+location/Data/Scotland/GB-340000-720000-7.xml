 One of the highlights of life in      
 Balmullo is the Sports and Gala Day   
 which takes place on the first        
 Saturday in June.  This is a new      
 tradition, having taken place only for
 the past six years, but it is now     
 established as a very popular day for 
 local inhabitants.                    
                                       
 There has been a Sports Day for       
 several years at which various races  
 and sports are enjoyed.  One of the   
 main features is the Hill Race, in    
 which the young people of the village 
 run up the nearby hill and back to the
 playing fields, where the sports day  
 is held.
