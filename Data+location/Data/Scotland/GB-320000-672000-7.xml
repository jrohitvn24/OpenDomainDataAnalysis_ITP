		<title>07HAYMARKET STATION,EDINBURGH.</title>
		<content>   Although train pessengers might     
 think Haymarket Station is just a     
 grimy structure,it is a listed        
 building.When it was first opened it  
 was the main station on the Edinburgh 
 to Glasgow route.Originally Haymarket 
 was a terminus,but when a tunnel was  
 built to take the line through to     
 Waverley station it became a small    
 secondary station serving the west of 
 Edinburgh.                            
                                       
   In steam days the crack locomotives 
 for London bound trains were serviced 
 in the nearby marshalling yards,but   
 now the yards are used for light      
 industry.                             
                                       
   In our school we found that out of  
 58 children in Primary Five,4 come to 
 school by train,using Haymarket       
 Station.                              </content>
