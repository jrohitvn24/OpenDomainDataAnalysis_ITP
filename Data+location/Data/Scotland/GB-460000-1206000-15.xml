		<content> The{Unst Pony Breeders Association    
 holds its annual show every other year
 at the Show Park in Baltasound - the  
 alternate year it is held in          
 Haroldswick. Sheep were added to the  
 show about 5 years ago, and pets were 
 added last year to create an interest 
 for youngsters. Pony numbers are      
 steady at around 60 - 70 with all     
 classes at the shows well-filled, but 
 the introduction of sheep probably    
 saved the show.Prizes are given either
 in cash or trophies and there are     
 about 8 trophies for ponies and sheep.
 Judges are invited from outwith       
 Shetland if possible. The show is held
 at the end of August/early September  
 along with the{S.W.R.I. Gala}which is 
 in the local hall with a display of   
 crafts,knitwear,vegetables,flowers and
 baking with prizes.A concert followed 
 by a dance is held in the evening.    </content>
