		<title>08Garvald Parish Church</title>
		<content> The church is pleasantly situated in a
 valley at the east end of the village 
 surrounded by an old kirkyard. It is a
 simple T shaped sandstone building    
 with just a belfry. The lower walls   
 are topped by a Norman stringcourse,  
 dating back to the 12th century.      
 Around c.1800 three galleries were    
 built and it seated over 500.  In the 
 1960's it was modernised and now has  
 attractive pink sandstone walls, light
 wood work and deep blue carpet,       
 curtains and stained glass window and 
 seats about 150. In 1980 it was no    
 longer possible to have a resident    
 minister and the manse was sold,      
 however the outbuildings were retained
 and converted to a meeting room,      
 vestry, kitchen &amp; toilets. Members of 
 the congregation made furnishings and 
 refurbished furniture.  Sunday school,
 kirk, &amp; social functions are held here</content>
