		<title>09CERES PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>{Ceres Parish Church was built in 1806 
 and is easily seen from all around    
 standing on a hill in the centre of   
 the village.The church is famous for  
{its box pews}which are used in{Long   
{Table Communion}to this day. These box
 pews are separated by pieces of wood  
 which come out to make a long row of  
 tables on either side of the main     
 aisle.The{spire}was added to the      
 church about{1870.}The clock belongs  
 to the community not the church. The  
 bell,pulled by a rope,is rung every   
 Sunday to call people to church at    
 11a.m.There are special services for  
 weddings,baptisms and funerals.{The   
{stone figure of a Crusader lies in    
{the vestibule and was probably the    
{main part of a monument in the earlier
{church.}In the churchyard there are   
 many interesting old tombstones.
