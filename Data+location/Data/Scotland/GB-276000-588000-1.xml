		<content> Moniaive is a very attractive village 
 in the Nithdale District of           
 Dumfriesshire.It lies at the junction 
 of three glens down which flow        
 CAIRN,Craigdarroch and Dalwhat        
 Waters respectively.These merge and   
 flow S.E.as the Cairn to join the     
 River Nith just north of Dumfries,the 
 main town of the region.The village   
 itself is a very lovely place and many
 people come to live here because of   
 this.Often this means that people who 
 have holidayed here decide to retire  
 here and,this in part,accounts for the
 population of approximately 850 having
 a majority of people over the age of  
 55.The primary school roll is 58,the  
 secondary school roll is approximately
 30 and there are roughly 25 pre school
 age children in the village.This may  
 give an indication of various age     
 groups within stressing the elderly.  </content>
