		<content>  The people of {Lanark}are concerned  
 about many issues affecting their     
 lives to a greater or lesser          
 degree.One issue,which has caused much
 debate is the question of a new{Road} 
 through the centre of the town.Some   
 planners and some of the landowners   
 want this ,but the inhabitants are    
 against it.Another source of lively   
 debate has been whether the {District 
{Council }should rewire the Memorial   
 Hall in{Lanark} rather than other     
 smaller halls as it is used for a     
 great deal of functions.Another hotly 
 debate subject is the question of the 
 Coop Building,which has lain derilict 
 for years and is an eye sore.Also     
 people in {Lanark }are angry about the
{Strathclyde Region's }decision to take
 away a class room at the Lanark       
 Primary School without thinking about 
 the consequences of such a move.      </content>
