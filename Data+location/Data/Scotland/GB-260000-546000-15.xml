		<content> There is only one public place of     
 worship in the village of Borgue.  It 
 is a large stone built Church of      
 Scotland, which was extended in 1896. 
 The money came from a bazaar held over
 two days in Borgue Academy. Sadly the 
 Church is now too big for the local   
 population, and only a small part is  
 used.                                 
 A service is held every second Sunday 
 at 10.30am.  Occaisionally, even      
 services are held in the privately    
 owned Kirkandrews Hall, which was     
 built by the Brown family, a local    
 landowner in 1908.  The builder of    
 this hall left it to be used by the   
 parishioners for any service, social  
 or political meeting.                 
 The present minister, Mr Bruce        
 Ritchie, has another two parishes     
 besides Borgue to administer.
