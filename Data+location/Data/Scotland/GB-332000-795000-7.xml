		<content>      The area is very sparcely        
 populated, with what houses there are 
 concentrated in the valley bottom near
 the North and South Deeside roads and 
 near the roads in Glen Gairn. At one  
 time nearly all the cottages would    
 have been tenented farms, but now a   
 lot of farms have been ammalgamated   
 and the farm houses bought by         
 non-farmers - retired people or people
 workng in Ballater.  On the South     
 Deeside Road, however, the majority of
 the houses still belong to one land   
 owner.  Apart from farming there is   
 little employment in the area.
