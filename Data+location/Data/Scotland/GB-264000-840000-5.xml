		<content>    This hotel has an enclosed swimming
 pool in the garden. It is surrounded  
 by woods. It used to belong to Ness   
 Castle Estate which included North    
 Lodge, South Lodge, Mid Lodge and West
 Lodge.                                
    All the Lodges were sold and The   
 Honourable Mrs. Smythe, who had an    
 estate called Ashington Court, in     
 Bristol, bought Ness Castle for her   
 country home.                         
    She was a Liberal supporter and {  
{Lloyd George}stayed at Ness Castle    
 during a Liberal fete in Inverness.   
    There is supposed to be a ghost    
 called The Green Lady which haunts the
 castle, walking the corridors at      
 night.
