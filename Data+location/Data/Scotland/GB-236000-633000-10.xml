		<title>10DANKEITH FARM _ DUNDONALD</title>
		<content> It is 5.30am in the morning and my dad
 is going to our grandparents' farm to 
 do the milking which takes about 2    
 hours.                                
   At about 10 o'clock we all do our   
 chores.John lets out his bantams and  
 collects the eggs,Anne feeds the      
 kittens and I put out the goat and I  
 give her water and feed her.          
  After dinner my dad goes out. He     
 fixes the fences and checks that the  
 cattle are all in their correct       
 fields.At 4 o'clock once again my dad 
 goes to do the milking.               
  At night John shuts in the bantams to
 protect them from the fox and Anne    
 feeds the kittens and I put in the    
 goat safely till the morning.         
  Life on a farm can be very hectic,   
 especially during the harvest, but it 
 is always good fun!
