		<title>18My Village</title>
		<content> My village Kilmany is a typical old   
 fashioned Scottish village.The white  
 church is small and friendly and is   
 surrounded by a very old grave yard.  
 One stone dates back to the Tay Bridge
 disaster;many are older than that.Most
 of the houses are farm cottages owned 
 by Lord and Lady Kilmany.Nearly       
 every house in the village stands on  
 the road side with the main gardens at
 the back.The post office and sohool   
 both closed about three years ago.    
 There is a disused railway line,a     
 siding and buildings.It is good fun to
 play up the railway among the trees   
 as there is no-one to stop you.The    
 railway closed in 1948 .Beside the    
 burn there is a great variety of bird 
 life.The road running up to the A914  
 is thought to have been an old roman  
 road.
