		<content> This areais predominantly grazing land
  for sheep and cattle with very little
 population. Apart from the A70 it has 
 very quiet country roads. It includes 
 the Corehouse Nature Reserve which is 
 managed by the Scottish Wildlfie trust
 who promte nature conservation. There 
 are 3 waterefalls which collectively  
 are called the Falls of Clyde. A      
 Hydroelectirc power station situated  
 below Corra Linn waterfall diverts    
 water from above Bonnington Linn thus 
 reducing their flow greatly. West of  
 Hyndford there is a sand and gravel   
 quarrry which also manufactures       
 concrete blocks. This working is not  
 obvious fromthe main road but takes up
 an increasing amount of land (1km at  
 present). Victorian observation       
 buildings and overgrown gardens in    
 Corehouse, deserted farm dwellings,   
 and the old fording point at Tilliford</content>
