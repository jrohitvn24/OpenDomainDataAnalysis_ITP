		<title>02TRANSPORT FOR SANDHEAD</title>
		<content> by Diane McColm aged 12               
   Around this area we have very little
 Public Transport. Three buses per day 
 pass through the village on their way 
 to Stranraer. They come at 8-30am,    
 11-30am, and 5-10pm. On Sunday the    
 buses don't even run. A private coach 
 hirer and two taxi firms are used     
 extensively by both people with cars  
 and those without.                    
      Obviously cars in this area are  
 very important. What would people do  
 if  they couldn't get to their work in
 the morning? They couldn't all get    
 taxis every morning and the bus comes 
 too late for the factories. Many      
 people share the cost of travelling to
 and from Stranraer with car-owning    
 friends.                              
         Our local town of Stranraer   
 has a population of 10 000 and in the 
 area we have 5 dealers for new cars!  </content>
