		<content> No automatic washing machines in those
 days!These were hard-working times.   
 Two or three families gathered heavy  
 bed covers and blankets and went to   
 the river.Men carried the cooper-made,
 white,wooden,handled-tubs to the river
 and built a stone fireplace.A fire of 
 sticks and peats was lit under a big, 
 river-water filled,iron pot to boil   
 the water.This water,two blankets,    
 washing powder and soft,green soap    
 were put into each tub and children   
 trampled them, bare-footed, until all 
 the dirt was out.They rinsed them down
 by the banks of the Ullapool River.   
 To wring the water out of them,two    
 people,one at each end,folded the     
 blanket and a third held a big stick  
 in the centre while the ends of the   
 blanket were twisted round it.The     
 blankets were then spread out on the  
 grass,in the sun, to dry.             </content>
