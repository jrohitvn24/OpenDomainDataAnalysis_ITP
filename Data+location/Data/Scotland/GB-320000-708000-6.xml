		<content> Strathmiglo Primary School was built  
 over a hundred years ago.It has twice 
 been renovated since, the last time in
 1961.Despite its age the building is  
 in very good condition.Heating for    
 the school is provided by a coal-fired
 boiler.Sometimes,during the winter,the
 system breaks down and children have  
 to be sent home.At the moment, the    
 school role is 72.There are 4 classes 
 and 4teachers.The Headteacher takes   
 primary 7. Specialists visit the      
 school to teach art,P.E.,music and    
 drama.Activities after school include 
 country dancing,creative dancing,     
 computer club,recorder and football.  
 At the end of primary 7 children      
 transfer to High School.The nearest   
 High School is Bell-Baxter in Cupar   
 and most choose to go there. Transport
 is provided and the journey,by bus,   
 takes 25 minutes.                     </content>
