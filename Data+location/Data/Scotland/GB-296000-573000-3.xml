		<title>03Dumfries Fire Station</title>
		<content> Dumfries fire station was opened on   
 the 28th November 1958. Dumfries and  
 Galloway fire brigade covers a 9 mile 
 radius and fifteen retained stations  
 cover the rest of Galloway. In        
 Dumfries they have a water ladder,    
 water tender, turntable ladder and    
 emergency ladder. Dumfries fire       
 station is becoming more sophisticated
 because of the Euro-route between     
 Ireland and Europe. Each fire         
 appliance holds a maximum of 300      
 gallons of water, which does not go   
 very far. The average number of calls 
 a year is around 2000. There are 17   
 men on a shift. After an incident     
 a report is written out. Each person  
 has his own locker. Also in the       
 station they have a dormitary, mess   
 room, lecture hall, kitchen, control  
 room and a smoke chamber and tower.
