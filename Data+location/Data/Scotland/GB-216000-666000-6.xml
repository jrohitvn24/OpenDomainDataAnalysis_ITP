		<content>  In January 1976 the doors shut on    
 Skelmorlie's first school,a red sand- 
 stone Victorian building opened in    
 September 1876 by Professor Thomson,  
 and new doors were opened on a modern 
 bright building.                      
  The school is a primary school for   
 children of all denominations.Most    
 children are Christian,either Protest-
 ant or Catholic and at present we have
 one pupil who is a Hindu.             
  Children begin school between the    
 ages of 4 and 5 and stay in Primary   
 School for 7 years.There are 7 classes
 formed on an age basis.The biggest    
 class,P2,has 33 pupils and the small- 
 est class,P6,has 15 pupils,all of them
 girls.

 full-time teachers,1 part-time teacher
