		<content> Buses were the main form of transport.
 The three family bus companies were   
 Robertsons, Curries &amp; Bannatynes. Only
 important people like the doctor &amp;    
 minister had cars. Lorries delivered  
 visitors' luggage to the place they   
 were going to stay - local boys       
 getting a penny to unload. People     
 didn't come on holiday in cars because
 there weren't any car ferries.        
   Horses were still used to do work on
 the farms as well as tractors.        
   Shops have changed a lot. There was 
 a shop at Shedog that sold anything   
 you needed. Part of the Kinloch Hotel 
 in Blackwaterfoot was a shop &amp; post   
 office. What was the grocer's shop, is
 now a hairdresser &amp; a sports shop.    
 The present day grocer's shop was then
 a branch of the Bank of Scotland.     
   Children stayed at the two-teacher  
 Shiskine School till they were 14 yrs.</content>
