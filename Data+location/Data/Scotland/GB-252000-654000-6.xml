		<title>06FAMILY LIFE IN NEWTON MEARNS</title>
		<content>   A typical weekday for a Newton      
 Mearns family would begin at about    
 7.30am. By 8.30am most working adults 
 are travelling to their places of     
 employment while the children make    
 their way to school where they remain 
 till 4pm. Most families are reunited  
 by 6.30pm to enjoy an evening meal and
 spend the evening together or in some 
 form of recreational activity.        
   Many parents will encourage and help
 their children with their schoolwork  
 in the evening as there is a high     
 degree of motivation towards education
 in the area.                          
   It could be said that many of the   
 people in this area are involved in   
 the 'rat-race' and 'keeping up with   
 the Jones's' can be quite important to
 some families.
