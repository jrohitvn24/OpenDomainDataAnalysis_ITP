		<content>{Stromness}is a small rural{town with a
{character}of its own. It is built on  
 a slope jutting down to the sea.Its   
 historic sights are a wonder to see   
 and the sea is a sanctuary for birds  
 and a perfect environment for the     
 occasional seal who cares to drop in. 
 The houses are a mixture of old and   
 new techniques and designs _ a true   
 display of good quality workmanship   
 and architecture. Some of the older   
 ones still retain their individual    
 piers from which in olden days the    
 inhabitants caught their dinner.The   
 sea provides a fertile area for       
 fishing from which Stromness          
 fishermen bring their catch. The land 
 around the town provides many farmers 
 with their livelihood. Venues for     
 recreation of various types add to the
 attraction of the town.
