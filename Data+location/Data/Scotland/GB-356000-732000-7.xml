		<content>    In High Street and in Station Road 
 on Saturday the 8th of June 1985, 25  
 people were asked whether they would  
 prefer to ride a bike or use a car in 
 the Carnoustie area.Here is a table of
 the results:                          
                                       
                                       
 NUMBER :  2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16         
 CYCLES :{ ||||||||||||||||            
 CARS   :{ |||||||||||}                
                                       
   Bicycles were chosen because they   
 cost less to run.Only 4 of the people 
 spoken to did not have bicycles.On the
 other hand,only 2 of the people asked 
 did not have cars.Cars were chosen    
 because travelling was quicker.       
   Many of the people who chose to use 
 bikes said that bikes didn't cause air
 pollution.This is something that      
 people should think about in future.  </content>
