		<content> An interesting animal kept at Viewhill
 Farm is the Friesian horse.The        
 Friesian horse of the Netherlands,is  
 always black,dates back some 3000     
 years and its ancestors are said to   
 have survived The Ice Age.The breed   
 lost favour as a general purpose horse
 and was actually in danger of dying   
 out.By 1903 there were only three     
 stallions left and in 1978 there were 
 only 26 stallions registered in the   
 Stud book.A new breed society was     
 formed and the numbers have increased 
 to their present level as the Friesian
 regained popularity.Viewhill Farm,    
 Culloden intends to establish the     
 Friesian in Scotland. The farm has a  
 stallion and 3 brood mares.It has     
 imported 15 colts and intends to sell 
 them to be used at stud.{
