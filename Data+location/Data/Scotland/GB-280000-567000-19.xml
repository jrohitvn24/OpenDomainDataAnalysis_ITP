		<content> Saturday the 1st of June started for  
 me at 9.00 am. My dad was already     
 outside working on the farm, and mum  
 was doing the washing. She made       
 breakfast of boiled egg and toast. My 
 mum wanted to do some small bits of   
 shopping in Castle-Douglas so my      
 sister and I decided we would go      
 swimming there. We had our lunch in   
 town. We went back home and planned to
 go to Dumfries. This was around 1.00  
 pm. My mum did the big week's shopping
 in Presto's. We bought my sister a new
 pair of shoes in Dumfries, went to see
 my Gran in hospital. On our way home  
 (this was around 6.00 pm), we bought  
 fish and chip suppers for eating at   
 home. The rest of the night was spent 
 watching T.V. (I watched Kenny Everett
 then Dynasty and then I watched       
 Cheers). I went to bed at 10.30 pm.
