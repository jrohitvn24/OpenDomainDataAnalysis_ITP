		<content> Once a year the local community meet  
 to form a committee to organise a     
 Village Fair.  This Fair has many     
 varied stalls. eg. cake and candy,    
 local produce etc... Teas are served  
 in the village hall.  At night a dance
 is held in the Hall.  The proceeds of 
 this Fair are divided in two - half to
 Church funds and half to defray       
 expenses of the Village Hall.         
 At the end of August the Annual Flower
 Show is held, again in the Village    
 Hall.  This is a very comprehensive   
 show of flowers, vegetables,          
 handicrafts and baking.               
 The first Flower Show was held over   
 100 years ago, but was cancelled      
 during the second World War.  It was  
 revived again by Mrs Ad    Grey from  
 Ingleston, after the 2nd World War and
 has been held annually ever since.
