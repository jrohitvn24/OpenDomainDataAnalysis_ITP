		<title>17FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> My name is{Blair Thompson.}Usually my 
 family rises about 7 a.m.Normally I   
 dress before breakfast. Our family    
 have breakfast at different times. At 
 about 8 a.m. my Dad leaves to work in 
 Edinburgh for British Telecom. We     
 chose to stay in Livingston because it
 lies between Glasgow and Edinburgh. My
 Mum works in Whitdale Primary as a    
 teacher and at 8.30 we all depart for 
 school. My school,{Meldrum Primary,}is
 a semi-open plan one. We have lunch at
 12.15 p.m. and I usually eat at the   
 school cafeteria. At 3.15 we go home. 
 In our area there is a wood and I     
 spend a lot of time there with friends
 while my parents work around the home.
 We have dinner in the evening and     
 later watch television or play on the 
 computer. I am a Scout and my little  
 brother,Scott,is a Cub Scout.
