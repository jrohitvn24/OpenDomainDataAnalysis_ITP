		<title>15DALMELLINGTON CHURCH-1</title>
		<content> Three churches serve the village of   
 Dalmellington.  Two are sited outwith 
 our survey area but the parish church 
 lies just within it.                  
                                       
 In 1846 this became the third         
 post-Reformation church to serve the  
 parish.  It is built of a hard local  
 sandstone which has weathered to a    
 grey colour. Externally it is         
 decorated with Romanesque arcading in 
 relief. The pinnacled tower carries   
 one of the two public clocks in the   
 village; the other is on the front of 
 the primary school at the other side  
 of the township.                      
                                       
 The church is sited on high ground on 
 the north-east edge of the village so 
 it overlooks the settlement and is a  
 landmark in the district.
