		<content> Mr.John Lang of Hilton of Carslogie   
 has invested heavily to drill 3       
 boreholes to supply irrigation water  
 to all parts of his land.The three    
 wells are each 220 feet deep and in   
 total they produce up to 240 gallons  
 each minute.The water comes from a    
 deep layer of white sandstone which   
 has excellent water retention         
 properties.The boreholes are 8 inches 
 wide and are unlined.Each borehole    
 costs about Â£2,500, and in addition   
 there is the cost of supplying a      
 piping system to relay water to all   
 fields.The well water comes to the    
 surface at a temperature of around 4  
 degrees Celcius which is a bit cold as
 it can chill crops and soil. However, 
 the advantages are considerable and   
 outweigh other factors.
