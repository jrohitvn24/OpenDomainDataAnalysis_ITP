		<title>06POLICEWORK IN CUMNOCK (1)</title>
		<content>   A policeman's work usually begins by
 finding out what went on during the   
 previous shift as he might have to    
 follow up such enquiries.  If there is
 nothing to complete, they are         
 instructed to attend to new enquiries.
 These duties can vary from attending  
 to found property such as a stray     
 dog, a slight, serious or fatal road  
 accident to non-suspicious sudden     
 deaths and even murder.  Most serious 
 crimes such as a large theft, house   
 breaking and murders are dealt with by
 CID.   Sometimes a policeman has to be
 in court to give evidence in a case.  
                                       
   Public co-operation plays an        
 important part in a policeman's job.  
   Visits to schools and other         
 organisations, help spread public     
 awareness of the role of the police. {
