		<title>20LONGFORGAN - SPORTING LIFE -</title>
		<content> Team sports in the village are darts  
 and football for the male population. 
 The football team is 2nd top of the   
 Dundee Welfare Division IV. Matches   
 are played at Longforgan and teams    
 come from Dundee and district. The    
 darts team is made up of mainly the   
 same people, and centres around the   
 public houses in the Carse of Gowrie. 
 Being a rural community, clay pigeon  
 shooting, rough shooting, wild fowling
 and fishing are indulged in by local  
 residents, and there are horse riding 
 stables in the village. The bowling   
 club is successful with both team and 
 individual competitors in competitions
 and they have a well maintained green 
 and a modern well equipped clubhouse. 
 There is also a cricket club at nearby
 Rossie Priory. There are tennis courts
 in the park, with a pavilion, and both
 are in a dilapidated condition.       </content>
