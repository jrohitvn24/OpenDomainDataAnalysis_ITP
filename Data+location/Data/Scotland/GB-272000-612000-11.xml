		<title>11Kirkconnel:Traditions Kept</title>
		<content> In common with most other parts of the
 U.K. the usual annual festivals are   
 celebrated.                           
 Hallowe'en:children dress up in order 
 to conceal their identity and visit   
 the houses of their neighbours and    
 friends.{'Are you hawd'n Hallowe'en?',
 they ask. If the answer is 'Yes' the  
 children go in and entertain there    
 hosts with a song,poem or joke. More  
 often than not jokes are told which is
 sad since the true tradition called   
 for more substantial entertainment.   
 The children's efforts are rewarded by
 the giving of sweets,nuts or fruit.   
 Here again the tradition is being     
 corrupted as more hosts give money    
 rather than home-made sweets etc.     
                                       
{hawd'n}=holding (keeping or observing)
