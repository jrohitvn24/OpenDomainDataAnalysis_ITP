		<content> Secondary school pupils from East     
 Wemyss, Coaltown of Wemyss, Buckhaven 
 and other surrounding villages all    
 attend Buckhaven High School. The High
 School is just outside this Domesday  
 square on the A.955 to Leven. The     
 villages all have their own primary   
 schools but the only one within this  
 area is East Wemyss Primary.          
 East Wemyss Primary School also houses
 the Wemyss Environmental Education    
 Centre (W.E.E.C.) in the basement. The
 centre has carried out several        
 projects in the Wemyss area and there 
 is now a considerable amount of       
 interpretive material available to the
 public. The aim of the centre is to   
 develop an interest in the environment
 and an attitude of care. Many primary 
 schools visit on educational trips and
 the centre is also open to the general
 public.                               </content>
