		<content> I hardly know anyone in the village   
 today.Eighty years ago we knew every- 
 one and neighbours helped each other  
 in every possible way.Today with so   
 much home entertainment on television 
 and video,people don't 'ceilidh'-visit
 as much as they used to because the   
 pattern of life has changed.          
 When I was a girl most families had a 
 cow and half an acre of land in or    
 around the village.A horse and plough 
 turned the ground and everyone helped 
 to plant potatoes and some corn for   
 feeding the cows.Some of our calves   
 were bought by Kenny'Drover'Macrae for
 5 shillings or slaughtered for veal.  
 A youth was employed as a herd boy to 
 take the cows to the common grazing up
 the hill and bring them home at night.
 All the owners would give a few pence 
 per week so that the youth would be   
 paid half-a-crown for his work.       </content>
