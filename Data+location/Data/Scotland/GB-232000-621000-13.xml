		<content>{  Holmston}School, where I went, was  
 founded in 1885 for the education of  
 the poor.  Lessons were on slate _    
 there were no buses, everyone walked _
 dinner was a carried piece.  I got a  
 penny for fetching the Master's dinner
 and spent it in Corbett's sweet shop. 
 Next door was Watson's grocery and a  
 fishmonger.  Apart from Hourston's    
 haberdashery the{High Street}was tene_
 ments.   Attitudes to clothes nowadays
 are vastly different and relaxed _ no 
 high button boots and starched petti_ 
 coats. {Holiday visitors}came to Ayr  
 in thousands by train and steamer.    
 Entertainment would be a band on the  
{Low Green,}a pierrot concert in the   
{Town Hall}or a visit to{Bolton's Tent 
{Theatre.} Sunday afternoon outing was 
 by tram to Banks O' Doon Tearoom or   
 Belleisle.  Rowing boats were hired   
 for a penny at{North Harbour Wall.    </content>
