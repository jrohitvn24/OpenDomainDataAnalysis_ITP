		<title>01LANDSCAPE OF SOUTH INVERKIP</title>
		<content>  The area lies on the eastern side of 
 the Firth of Clyde between the        
 villages of{Inverkip}and{Wemyss Bay.  
 The altitude ranges from sea-level in 
 the extreme northwest near Inverkip,  
 to 276m in the southeast.  The        
 low-lying western part is used mainly 
 for dairy farming while the upper     
 slopes in the east are mainly heather 
 moorland, which is used for sheep     
 farming with some areas of forestry.  
 The{Daff Resevoir}lies to the north   
 east.  This is part  of the aqueduct, 
 known as the{Cut,}which formerly      
 supplied{Greenock's}water.  The only  
 settlement, apart from farms is the   
 Southern part of Inverkip village and 
 the Langhouse Hotel.  Communications  
 are limited to minor roads connecting 
 the various farms in the area, except 
 for the A78 in the northwest which    
 joins Inverkip and Wemyss Bay.        </content>
