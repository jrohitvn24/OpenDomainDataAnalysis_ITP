The houses in the area are a mixture of council houses and privately owned houses. Lots of new houses have been built in this area. In 1998 Milesmark Hospital was knocked down and over 300 privately owned houses "Milesmark Gardens" were built by Beazer Homes. 80 other privately owned houses were built on fields by Stewart Milne at "The Castings" in the 1990's. Another small privately owned housing estate was built on the south side of Rumblingwell; Whitemyre Court. This land belonged to the sawmill but it was knocked down in 1990 and over 23 houses were built. Opposite Whitemyre Court a few houses were built where the offices of the sawmill stood, these houses are called Backwell Court. In Rumblingwell, there are still a few tenement blocks, which were built in the Victorian times. &lt;br />&lt;br />        &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
