		<title>11STRONVAR HOUSE BALQUHIDDER</title>
		<content> Stronvar House was built in 1850 for  
 David Carnegie of Gothenburg in       
 Sweden. It was designed by David Bryce
 and took 2 years to build. David      
 Carnegie owned all the farm land on   
 both sides of Loch Voil and built     
 Stronvar on the south side of Loch    
 Voil. He also built the church and a  
 new school in Balquhidder. David      
 Carnegie lived in it until his death  
 in 1890, leaving Stronvar and a       
 fortune of Â£500000 to his only son,   
 James. The estate remained in the     
 Carnegie family until 1952 when it was
 broken up. The house was later sold to
 the Scottish Youth Hostel Association 
 and for 20 years it was a very popular
 Youth Hostel. The land was sold off as
 farms. In 1974 Stronvar was bought by 
 Mr and Mrs Donald Hopper who have run 
 it as a guest house since then. In    
 1985 it is on the market again.       </content>
