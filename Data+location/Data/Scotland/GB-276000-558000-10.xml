		<title>10GELSTON CASTLE - HISTORY</title>
		<content> Sir William Douglas,who built Gelston 
 Castle,was born in Galloway,brought up
 by an uncle,and started work as a     
 pedlar.He then emigrated to           
 Virginia,where he made a fortune,and  
 returned to Galloway to invest in the 
 cotton industry.                      
   He bought a large estate in the     
 parish of Kelton,and there erected the
 stately Gelston Castle                
   The castle continued as a private   
 home until the 1939-45 war,when it was
 used as a school for evacuees.        
   After the war it was stripped of    
 most of its fine interior,and was     
 eventually used as a grain store.     
   The castle is now unsafe,and        
 people are discouraged from venturing 
 too close.                            
   Nearby buildings on the estate have 
 been converted to holiday flats,and   
 there is a tennis-court and a pool.   </content>
