		<content> Having your own transport for         
 shopping,visiting the doctor etc. is a
 great asset in this area, for it is   
 often very difficult , especially     
 in winter, to get up to the main road 
 to catch the bus.                     
                                       
 There appears to be no emergency      
 provision from the urban areas to     
 check up on the elderly in rural areas
 during severe winter weather. Some,   
 although loving the area, dread the   
 winter, especially after the winter of
 1984, when many could not get up to   
 the bus stop. Unable to light their   
 fires through frozen pipes with their 
 food stocks running low they were glad
 of the help they received from        
 neighbours but would rather not have  
 to rely wholly on them.
