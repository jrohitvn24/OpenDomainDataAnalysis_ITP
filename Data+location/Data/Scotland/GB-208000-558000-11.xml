 This has been going for about seven   
 years.It was started by boys from the 
 village so they could play football   
 in the Sunday League.So far they have 
 been League champions three times. The
 club has been financed through        
 sponsored walks,fetes and prize draws.
 Some of the money is used to give     
 elderly people from the village a     
 night out once a year.                
{THE BOWLING CLUB.}                    
 The new club house,in Castle Kennedy  
 Gardens,was opened by Lady Stair in   
 April,1982. The club has about thirty 
 members and plays once a week.You do  
 not pay to watch but yoy must pay to  
 play.You must also wear flat shoes or 
 you will spoil the bowling green.     
 After the game you can buy tea and    
 biscuits.
