		<title>07HOUSING STRONE/MAUKINHILL</title>
		<content> In the {Strone/Maukinhill}area of     
 Greenock 90% of the houses are owned  
 by the Council and 10% are privately  
 owned.There are 1374 council houses.  
 The oldest houses were built in 1934  
 and there is an ongoing private       
 development at the moment. At present 
 there are 76 empty houses.            
 The biggest and main problem regarding
 housing in this area is {vandalism}.  
 Very few of the houses have dampness. 
 A large majority of houses have been {
{modernised}. Central heating has been 
 installed in many and windows and     
 kitchen units have been replaced.  The
 exteriors have been painted.          
 Although the {Housing Department}     
 receives very few complaints about    
 housing conditions, there is still a  
 low demand for houses in the          
 Strone/Maukinhill area of Greenock.
