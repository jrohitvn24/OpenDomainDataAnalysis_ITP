		<content>{Keep Motherwell District Tidy Campaign
 started in Spring 1983 and will last  
 at least 5 years and may be extended. 
 It was started by Motherwell District 
 Council with help from{Keep Scotland  
{Tidy}and{Keep Britain Tidy.} There are
 48 workers; half work in schools and  
 half in the local communities.  It was
 started to help keep Motherwell       
 cleaner and to make it more attractive
 to new industries.  The two main      
 problems are the dumping of rubbish   
 and dog-fouling.  Motherwell District 
 Council fund the project, though local
 companies, over 100 so far, sponsor   
 bins, prizes for competitions and give
 the campaign free use of equipment.   
 The campaign has been a success so far
 but Motherwell will be clenaer still  
 in 5 years and, hopefully, even better
 in 15 years time.
