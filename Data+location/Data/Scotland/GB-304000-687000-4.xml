		<title>04A DAY IN THE LIFE OF STELLA</title>
		<content> I woke up at 7.30am,got dressed and   
 ran downstairs to have my breakfast of
 cereal and tea.About 8.30am I picked  
 up my coat and schoolbag and called   
 for Alison.It took us ten minutes to  
 walk to school,and at 9am I began work
 by reading my library book.Then I did 
 Maths and finished with Handwriting.  
 At break we all went out to play.I had
 a packet of sweets.After break I read 
 Elidor and then wrote an adventure    
 story until lunch.In the afternoon we 
 played non-stop cricket and finished  
 with some quizzes.When I got home I   
 had a drink of lemonade.At 6pm I had  
 my dinner with my family.After that I 
 watched a James Bond film called Dr No
 on the video before going to bed.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
