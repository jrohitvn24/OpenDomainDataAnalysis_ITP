		<content>  The average family size is           
 2.5 children, and, in general the     
 children's ages are relatively close  
 together. Very few of the younger     
 families are without domestic pets.   
  All members of the community have a  
 pride in their homes and gardens. For 
 heating and cooking they use          
 electricity, coal, oil and bottled    
 gas(there is no piped gas in the      
 area) It is mainly a simple way of    
 life with few worries,although 30%are 
 concerned about the "acid rain"effect.
  The parents and grandparents are     
 very interested in their children's   
 education.                            
   50% of the adults work locally, 15% 
 are self-employed and the remaining   
 35% either work in Castle Douglas, our
 nearest town, which is 14 Kilometres  
 away or are in employment away from   
 home.                                 </content>
