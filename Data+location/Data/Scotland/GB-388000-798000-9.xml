		<title>09CHILDHOOD ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content>  Every child between 5 &amp; 16 years old 
 must go to school. At weekends and    
 holidays I (a boy aged 11) go         
 shooting, make racing carties or      
 underground huts, muck about in cars &amp;
 6 motor -bikes, see if there's any    
 stock car for sale and practice stunts
 on my BMX bike. I buy old bikes, do   
 them up and sell them. I play with my 
 horses Sooty &amp; Pepper and my Mum's    
 horse &amp; foal.                         
  Girl's activities include watching   
 T.V., reading books, comics, annuals, 
 cycling, playing on swings or playing 
 an instrument.                        
  In days gone by children played      
 adventure games outside when they     
 could or read books and make things   
 inside. Girls played with dolls and   
 boys collected toy cars etc. Children 
 used to work on the farms a lot.
