		<title>02Shopping Centre _ Kennoway</title>
		<content>  The shopping centre in Kennoway is   
 situated to the east of{New Road,}the 
 main road through the village. It was 
 built in the early 1960's to meet the 
 needs of a growing population.        
  The centre is set back from New Road 
 and  comprises a suite of shops on the
 ground floor with two floors of       
 residential housing above, in the form
 of flats. Between the shops and the   
 main road is a landscaped area        
 incorporating a{car park}and a{bus    
{stance,}which buses, both local and   
 long-distance, use frequently.        
  The facilities to be found in the    
 centre include a{library, dentist,    
{Chinese take-away, butcher, rent      
{office, mini-market, chemist and      
{hairdresser.}Near-by is a{health      
{centre}and a number of other shops.   
 Although useful, the centre does not  
 meet all the needs of the community.  </content>
