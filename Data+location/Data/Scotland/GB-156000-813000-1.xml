		<title>01Loch Slapin and Suisnish</title>
		<content> All of this block with the exception  
 of one twelfth of Sea Loch Slapin     
 Suisnish headland is a derelict       
 crofting area, mostly empty of        
 habitation since the last century, the
 last resident left about 20 years ago.
 The surviving croft house in square 3 
 is used by the crofter/shepherd at    
 lambing time.  The remainder of the   
 buildings have fallen into disrepair  
 with the exception of the sheep pen   
 and a storage shed.  There is a rough 
 track leading to Suisnish Township    
 from the road but this is only        
 suitable for a Land Rover, it turns   
 into a footpath along the cliffs in   
 square 4 and is very popular with     
 summer visitors.  The land is now     
 uncultivated grassland and moorland   
 with a rocky coastline and cliffs.    
 Suitable only for sheep grazing and   
 bird watching                         </content>
