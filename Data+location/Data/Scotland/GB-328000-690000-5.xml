		<content> Mr. B. gets up at 7.10 a.m. and has   
 his breakfast at 8.20 a.m. He opens up
 his shop at 9 a.m. Mr. B. is a leather
 merchant. He closes his shop at 12.30 
 p.m. and has his lunch between then   
 and 2 p.m. when he returns to open    
 his shop. He works until 5 p.m. and   
 has his tea about 5.50 p.m. He usually
 works in the evening but on two nights
 a week he goes out on his boat. He    
 keeps his boat at Port Edgar Marina   
 below the Forth Road Bridge. He does  
 not keep it at Dysart Harbour which   
 would be much handier because Dysart  
 is restricted because the entrance to 
 the harbour is silted up. Although he 
 occasionally fishes, his motor boat is
 used mainly for pleasure. Mr. B.      
 usually goes to bed at 11 p.m. but the
 lights never go out util 11.40 p.m. as
 he likes to read for a while.
