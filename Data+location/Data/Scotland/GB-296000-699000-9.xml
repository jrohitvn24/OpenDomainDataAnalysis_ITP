		<content> This is a scattered, mainly           
 agricultural area of Scotland.        
 In the rural area between Dollar and  
 Muckhart there are family owned farms,
 each with a large traditional Scottish
 farm house and one or two smaller farm
 cottages which in some cases are      
 occuppied by farm hands and in other  
 cases, younger members of the family. 
 At the western end of Muckhart there  
 are 13 houses rented out by           
 Clackmannan District Council. Over the
 years 4 of these have been purchased  
 by the occupants. It is proposed that 
 approx. 7 houses will be built by the 
 Council in the future.                
 The area supports mainly private      
 housing but no further ground is to be
 made available in the foreseeable     
 future for housing development of a   
 private nature.
