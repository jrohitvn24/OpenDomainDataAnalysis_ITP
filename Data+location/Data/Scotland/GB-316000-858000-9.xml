		<content> They come from the local nursery which
 is one of the best in the country.When
 they are planted they are only about  
 5cm tall but after 4 or 5 years they  
 will grow to about 5 metres.          
 Specially made helmets,boiler         
 suits,boots and gloves are distributed
 to every forester as a safety         
 precaution.The men use "Skidders" to  
 pull heavy loads and they run on      
 diesel and can operate automatically. 
 One tyre costs over Â£100 and the      
 Skidder itself costs about Â£50,000.   
 Monoughty Forest has three nature     
 walks_the red(0.5ml),the blue(1ml) and
 the green(1.5ml).There is a picnic    
 area with special seats which leave an
 open end for people confined to       
 wheelchairs.
