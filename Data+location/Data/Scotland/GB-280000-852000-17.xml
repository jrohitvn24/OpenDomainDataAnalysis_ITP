		<title>17THE A96. GOLLANFIELD</title>
		<content>  Going straight through{Gollanfield}is
 the{A96.}It has had people pleading   
 for improvement for many years,but not
 much has been done about it. Infact,  
 quite a majority of schoolchildren    
 used to have to cross the{A96}to get  
 to school,but because of the amount   
 and speed of the traffic they were    
 switched to a taxi.That was in 1982.  
 Still nothing has been done.          
  It has actually come to a district   
 councillor writing to the P.M,Mrs     
 Thatcher, saying how many accidents   
 occur in a year.The reply was         
 disappointing, a secretary from       
 Downing street said that they are     
 sorry but they cannot help. But there 
 are minor improvements due to be      
 carried out on the road.Can't we even 
 turn for help to the highest          
 authorities?
