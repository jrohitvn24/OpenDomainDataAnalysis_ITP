		<title>17The Battle of Camperdown</title>
		<content>{Camperdown Park}takes its name from   
 Viscount Duncan of Camperdown. On the 
 28th of May 1797 Admiral Duncan       
 received orders to blockade the Dutch 
 fleet under Admiral de Winter.        
 Although his ships were quite         
 inadequate to risk an engagement,     
 Duncan succeeded in keeping the Dutch 
 locked in for several weeks. However, 
 eventually he was forced to return to 
 harbour because his supplies were     
 running out. On his return he found   
 the Dutch out of the trap and ready   
 for him. A fierce battle ensued and,  
 despite their superior numbers,the    
 Dutch were finally defeated. De Winter
 was compelled to surrender and gave up
 his sword to Admiral Duncan on board  
 the "Venerable". The importance of the
 victory was at once acknowledged and  
 Admiral Duncan was honoured nationally
 and locally.                          </content>
