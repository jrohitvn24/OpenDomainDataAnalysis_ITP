		<content>  There are the sites of several       
 bronze-age standing stones, e.g. at   
 Auchendreich, and one remaining stone 
 from a circle at Millplough. Also, two
 Kists have been found in the area, one
 near Mill of Allardyce, and one on the
 Law. An aerial photograph taken in    
 1976 shows crop marks of two ramparts 
 of a prehistoric camp or fort of      
 Castle Dykes at Kirkton.              
  Mr Watt(text p.4) tells the story of 
 a stone thrown by the Devil from Gobbs
 to Kinneff, which split, one part     
 landing towards Barras and the other  
 at Largie. The stone is known as the  
 Devil's Stone with the imprint of the 
 Devil's elbow and hand visible on the 
 stone.                                
  There are many agates to be found    
 especially in the disused quarries,   
 e.g. near the Post Office, and        
 children enjoy searching for them.    </content>
