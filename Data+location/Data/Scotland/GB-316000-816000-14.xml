		<title>14MY GRANDAD'S FARM</title>
		<content> My name is Raymond Irvine and I live  
 at Inverlochy Farm, just outside the 2
 small blocks that we are doing for the
 Domesday Project.  At the weekends    
 however, I go over to work on my      
 Grandad's Farm at Fordmouth.  It is   
 only a few lOO yards from Tomintoul   
 School, down by the River Avon.       
 Sometimes in the winter my Grandad and
 I have difficulty getting to the sheep
 to feed them.  We feed the sheep some 
 special feed called Draff and Barley  
 mixed together which gives the sheep a
 lot of milk to feed the lambs over the
 winter.  This keeps them strong.      
 Sometimes when a cow is calving we    
 take her into the barn but if we      
 cannot manage to calf her we phone my 
 Dad or the Vet.  The Vet comes from   
 Grantown-on-Spey.  When the calves are
 big we sell them at Tomintoul Mart.
