{HAY}is dried grass which is baled and 
 stored. {Silage}is grass which is cut 
 and stored when it is green. Both are 
 fed to animals. In our area there     
 are seven fields of {Turnips} and     
 twenty fields of {Potatoes.}Some of   
 the potatoes go to shops, but many are
 used for {Seed, }an important product 
 in our area.                          
 One farmer grows {Peas}. They are cut 
 by a pea viner,( or by combine) and   
 are processed as high protein animal  
 feed.                                 
 There are twelve areas of woodland,   
 some of which are all {Coniferous},   
 others are mixed {Deciduous.}         
 In general, the soil is fertile, apart
 from some of the upland areas, which  
 are used for grazing sheep. The most  
 important crops are {Barley} and {Seed
{Potatoes.                             </content>
