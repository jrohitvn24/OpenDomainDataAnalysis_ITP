 At local weddings the old custom of   
 'CREELING'is still observed.When the  
 couple return from the church the     
 newly wed husband has a creel with    
 stones placed on his back.He carries  
 this until his new wife kisses him in 
 front of the villagers.Only then is   
 the creel allowed to fall.The creel   
 represents the willingness of the     
 groom to accept marital               
 responsibilities and the kiss the     
 wife's willingness to stand by her    
 husband.
