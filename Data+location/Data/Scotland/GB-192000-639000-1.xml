		<title>01Glen Iorsa and Hills</title>
		<content> Glen Iorsa is the main physical       
 feature of this area.  It is a very   
 remote glen and nobody lives or works 
 here.  However, it is popular with    
 hillwalkers, and there is a           
 well-defined footpath running         
 alongside Iorsa water.  The valley    
 floor is extremely boggy, and there   
 are a few small lochans very close to 
 the burn itself.  The area is a site  
 of Special Scientific interest, and   
 the majority of it is owned by the    
 Dougarie Estate.  A small part of the 
 eastern section is owned by the       
 National Trust for Scotland - their   
 boundary follows the Parish boundary  
 along the high ridges here.  The      
 highest land here is Beinn Tarsuinn at
 825 mts, and a district footpath runs 
 along the ridges of Beinn Nuis and    
 Beinn Tarsuinn.
