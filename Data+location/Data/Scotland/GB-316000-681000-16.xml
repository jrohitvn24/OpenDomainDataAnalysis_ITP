		<content> There are now no plans for the        
 development of Donibristle House.     
 People in the area think something    
 ought to be done with it. Some        
 children suggested that the remains of
 Donibristle House should be converted 
 into an old world inn called the      
 "Earl's Inn". Downstairs there would  
 be a bar serving real Scottish ale as 
 well as spirits and upstairs a        
 restaurant which would serve          
 traditional Scottish dishes. The decor
 would have to create an atmosphere of 
 the mid nineteenth century. The       
 bedrooms would contain modern         
 furniture and a television and video. 
 A small area would be set aside for a 
 heated indoor swimming pool which     
 could be used by the people of Dalgety
 Bay. Another suggestion was to make   
 the house into a wax works museum     
 portraying scenes from the past.      </content>
