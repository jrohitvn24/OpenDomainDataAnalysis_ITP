		<title>03The Contented Milkman</title>
		<content> Mr Doig has been a milkman for 37     
 years.He rises at 3:30am each morning 
 to deliver 2500 bottles of milk to his
 900 customers.He sells other products 
 like rolls,yoghurt,juices,cream,eggs, 
 butter and even potatoes.The advantage
 of being a milkman is that you have   
 the whole world to yourself so early  
 in the morning.Mr Doig does not mind  
 icy roads but he hates snow as it's   
 easy to get stranded up a side road   
 when there's a lot of snow.Breakdowns 
 are a nuisance too when you are       
 anxious to get the milk delivered on  
 time.It is a family business with his 
 wife,son and daughter all delivering  
 milk.They take great pride in being   
 effeciant and reliable.He is not too  
 bothered about supermarkets selling   
 milk.
