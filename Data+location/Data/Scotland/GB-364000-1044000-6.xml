		<title>06THE STONE AT SCAR</title>
		<content> At Scar there stands a huge glaciated 
 mass of rock.It originally stood 2    
 miles away at Saville,but was moved   
 under the orders of the Laird of Scar.
 It was pulled by horses,many of which 
 were strained in the process.There is 
 no rock like it,geologically,on Sanday
 and it is thought to have broken away 
 from a glacier in the ice_age,possibly
 from Iceland or Norway.               
 The rock is 1.17 metres high,1.02     
 metres wide and 1.10 metres long.     
 Over the years,the sheer weight of the
 rock has made it sink into the ground,
 so that only approximately 7/8 of it  
 is visible and measurable.            
 It stands in the corner of a small    
 field which is in front of the        
 house,once in full view of the laird. 
 The island no longer has any lairds.
