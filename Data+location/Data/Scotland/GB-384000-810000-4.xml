		<content>    The area is predominantly          
 Agricultural with the exception of, in
 the North-East corner, the Airport and
 Kirkhill Industrial Estate and, in the
 North-West corner, Kirkhill Forest.   
    The proximity of the Urban Market  
 combined with the nature of the soil  
 and terrain, have resulted in a       
 greater emphasis on Pastoral rather   
 than Arable farming.                  
    A large proportion of the          
 Agricultural land in this area is     
 owned and farmed by the Rowett and    
 Craibstone Research Institutes which, 
 although world-renowned, are not      
 representative of the farms in the    
 surrounding area, being involved,     
 among many other things, in the       
 raising of such exotic species as     
 deer.
