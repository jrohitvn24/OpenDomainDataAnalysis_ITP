  IN THE 19TH AND EARLY 20TH CENTURIES 
 THE EAST MONKLANDS' FORTUNE LAY IN THE
{RICH SEAMS OF COALS}E.G.HUMPH COAL FOR
 DOMESTIC USE AND THE MAKING OF BRICKS,
 MUSSELBAND AND PYATSHAW COALS FOR     
 STEAM ENGINES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,   
 SPLINT COAL FOR USE IN THE IRON AND   
 STEEL INDUSTRY. WITH THE              
 EVER-INCREASING DEMAND FOR COAL AS THE
 INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION TOOK OFF, THE   
 EAST MONKLANDS GREW AND PROSPERED. BY 
 THE 1830'S THERE WERE OVER 100 MINES  
 IN THE AREA AT RAWYARDS, AIRDRIEHILL, 
 BALLOCHNEY, WHITERIGG, DARNGAVIL AND  
 STANRIGG, ETC. MANY SMALL VILLAGES    
 GREW UP AROUND SOME OF THE LARGER     
 MINES - SOME FROM EXISTING HAMLETS,   
 OTHERS BUILT BY THE COALMASTERS NEAR  
 THE PITHEAD.
