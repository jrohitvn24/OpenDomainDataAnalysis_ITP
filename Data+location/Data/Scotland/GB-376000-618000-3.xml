		<title>03HOWNAM CHURCH AND PARISH</title>
		<content> This parish has suffered depopulation 
 during the last forty years, and three
 ministerial changes in twelve years   
 gives indication of this unsettling   
 influence.In 1956 it was linked with  
 Yetholm and united with Morebattle in 
 1972.These three parishes now share a 
 minister with Linton.Services are held
 fortnightly with an average of 10     
 people,but on Christmas Eve the church
 built in 1752 to seat 226 is full with
 other parishes attending.In the summer
 the Kelso Laddie and followers visit, 
 ensuring a large congregation. Holy   
 Communion is celebrated 4 times each  
 year and since 1970 11 children from  
 the parish have been baptised. Hownam 
 women are invited to join Morebattle  
 Women's Guild, and the children asked 
 to Morebattle Sunday School.There are 
 some thirty members and adherents on  
 the congregational roll.              </content>
