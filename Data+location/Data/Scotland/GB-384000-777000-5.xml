		<title>05HOUSES IN CATTERLINE</title>
		<content> There are twenty nine houses in       
 Catterline village and some people    
 live on farms  round about. On the day
 I am writing this, a builder has      
 started building seven new houses.    
 Three people live down at the old     
 mill. There is a holiday house which  
 lots of people go to in the summer.   
 There is an old cottage on a cliff,   
 which has been turned into an artist's
 studio but it was built for a watch   
 house for smugglers. At the front of  
 the village three old cottages have   
 been turned into the Creel Inn, a bar 
 where you can get a meal. Catterline  
 is a nice place and everyone likes    
 it.                                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
