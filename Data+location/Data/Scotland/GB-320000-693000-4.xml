		<title>04The Miners Strike</title>
		<content> I was at school the day the strike    
 started. When I came home at          
 lunch-time and saw my mother sitting  
 in the chair with her head in her     
 hands. I asked her what was wrong. She
 told me dad had been sent home from   
 work. The union had called a strike.  
                                       
 At first we thought it would be only  
 for a little while but it went on and 
 on. Money was very short and the bills
 kept coming in. Mum and dad used their
 holiday money to buy new school       
 clothes for me. I didn't want them to 
 use it but they insisted. Sometimes I 
 didn't feel well as I thought the     
 strike was never going to end.        
 Christmas was a sad time for mum and  
 dad because they couldn't give us the 
 gifts they wanted  to give us. My two 
 older brothers helped out when they   
 could but I felt so helpless (cont.)  </content>
