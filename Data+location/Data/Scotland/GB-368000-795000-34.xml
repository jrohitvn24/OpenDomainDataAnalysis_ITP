<title>34Games we play at Banchory Primary School</title>
<content>

One game we play at Banchory Primary School is called Tag. To play Tag you decide who is going to be it or the tagger. The other players run away from the tagger, the main idea is not to get tagged by the tagger , so the tagger chases them and to tag someone he must touch him with his hand and say tag, now that person is it, and this just keeps going.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are different versions of this such as freeze or when if you get tagged you are it with the tagger, but I will talk about freeze. Freeze is played by when one person is it but when one of the people gets tagged, they are frozen, the main idea is to tag all the people so that they are all frozen, to free someone you have to touch them, but the tagger is not allowed to guard them.   &lt;br />
