		<content> There is a wide variety of foodshops  
 in Huntly,ranging from supermarkets to
 small businesses.Mace,Spar,Co-op and  
 the Centra are examples of modern self
 -service shops.They provide a great   
 variety of products,some of them      
 incorporate a bakers shop.All shops   
 reported that their busiest days were 
 Thursdays to Saturdays when many      
 people from the surrounding areas are 
 in town.When these shops provide      
 special offers there was an increase  
 in the sale of that product.Our       
 butchers shops and bakers shops are   
 family run concerns.
