		<title>05A Perth riverside walk</title>
		<content> Start at the corner of the North Inch 
 below the Perth Bridge where you can  
 see the Tay's flood markings of past  
 years.You may see salmon fishermen    
 standing in the river trying their    
 luck.Walk along Tay Street,a street of
 lovely old sandstone buildings.       
 Crossing the railway bridge is good   
 fun,looking down through the cracks in
 the wood to see the rushing rapids!   
 Steps lead down to Moncrieff Island.  
 Duck under the Queen's Bridge into the
 lovely Norrie Millar Park with it's   
 ornamental pool.                      
 This will lead you back to the Old    
 Bridge passing a council scheme of    
 houses which has won many awards, as  
 it was specially designed to fit this 
 beautiful spot by the bridge.
