		<content>  The most prominent feature in the    
 landscape of our area is the Eildon   
 Hills.These are three peaks rising    
 from the Tweed valley.                
  The rest of our area is mostly rural 
 farmland.Bowden is the only reasonably
 sized residential area.There are three
 large farms in our area,all of them   
 have rough grazing land for sheep and 
 some have a few fields in which they  
 grow turnips,potatoes,oilseed-rape and
 other crops.One farm also has a herd  
 of 200 beef cattle.                   
  Here and there can be seen groups of 
 coniferous trees and a few clumps     
 of deciduous trees.There are many old 
 disused quarries and an ancient       
 earthwork,there are also a few old    
 wells.
