		<title>02Antiquities in Bourtie</title>
		<content> Farming methods have not yet          
 obliterated major features of         
 antiquity.  The farmer at kirkton of  
 Bourtie, although provided with no    
 compensation for avoiding it with the 
 plough, carefully preserves the 5000  
 year old stone circle with stands on  
 his land.  it is one of the earliest  
 Neolithic recumbent stone circles in  
 aberdenshie, the recumbent stone      
 weightin roughly 15 tons.  It is used 
 as a sighting point for the seasons   
 and the sunset points on the horizon  
 from the circle for midsummer and     
 midwinter are still as dramatic as    
 when the circle was built.  Full moon 
 rise points are studied locally from  
 another stone circle, a mile further  
 east at Shieldon of Bourtie.  This    
 circle has no recumbent stone and was 
 probably built much later, in the     
 Bronze age.                           </content>
