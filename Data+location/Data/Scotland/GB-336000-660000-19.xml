		<content>  My name is David Ross.I am 35 years  
 of age and I live in Borthwick Mains  
 Cottages near Middleton.I am married  
 and my wife is expecting a child in   
 Sept.I am a music instrutor and       
 my main instruments is the flute      
 although I play many more.I travel    
 around primary and secondary schools  
 working with various age groups.      
  I enjoy living in this remote,lonely 
 area.I wouldn't like to live in a     
 built up city again it's beautiful    
 here.No pollution,noise or crowds of  
 people.It does have it's drawbacks    
 though.In winter we can be snowed in  
 and we must plan our visits to town   
 carefully as we just can't pop out to 
 the shops easily.A car is essential as
 were not on a bus route.On the whole  
 we really enjoy it here.
