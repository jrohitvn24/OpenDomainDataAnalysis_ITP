		<content> Although the{Strathspey and Badenoch  
{Herald}covers the whole of the Spey   
 Valley,the Editor has discovered that 
 many stories reported happen in       
 Aviemore,probably because continued   
 development of the area as a tourist  
 attraction causes{conflict}between    
 the conservationists and the tourist  
 industry.A recent example of these    
 problems arose when local residents   
 petitioned the {District Council      
 complaining about disturbances out-   
 side the nearby fish-and-chip shop in 
 the early hours of the morning.They   
 wanted the council to restrict the    
 shop opening hours but to do so would 
 require a licencing system which does 
 not exist.Eventually a compromise was 
 reached with the shop owner agreeing  
 to close at 2am and the police        
 offering to patrol the area regularly 
 to keep disturbances to a minimum.    </content>
