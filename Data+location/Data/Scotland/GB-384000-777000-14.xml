		<title>14SHOPPING</title>
		<content> Catterline has only one shop and it is
 situated next to the main road. It has
 petrol pumps and sells almost         
 anything,from wellington boots to     
 cough mixture. Most people buy their  
 Sunday papers there. Down in the      
 village we get a butcher's van which  
 comes from Inverbervie. A lot of      
 people use the butcher's van. Also we 
 have a fish van which comes from      
 Gourdon. A library van comes from     
 Stonehaven and quite a few of the     
 older people use this van. The village
 people are beginning to use the big   
 supermarkets in Stonehaven and        
 Aberdeen. Supermarkets are just very  
 large shops which sell quite a lot of 
 things. So you can see Catterline     
 people have quite a few ways of       
 getting their shopping.
