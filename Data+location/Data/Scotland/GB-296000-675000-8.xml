		<title>08Racal A Radar Factory</title>
		<content>  In 1977 the Radar Systems Division   
 of MESL rented the factory,that Racal 
 is now in,from the SDA.Racal moved    
 into Linlithgow because MESL was      
 expanding and needed more space.      
   Racal employs 115 people and 40% of 
 these live in Linlithgow.Racal makes  
 ASMI,secondary,military and Miss      
 distance radars.They supply the       
 Ministry of Defence,British           
 Aerospace,the Civil Aviation Authority
 and also foreign countries.           
   Although they have no firm plans yet
 Racal would like to expand in         
 Linlithgow.They take on YTS and had   
 one in 1984 and one in 1985.There is  
 also an apprentice scheme.There are   
 three Racal firms in Scotland.        
   60% of the workforce in Linlithgow  
 are engineers but they also employ    
 inspectors,draughtsmen,accountants and
 managers.                             </content>
