		<title>11"Kelso in Bloom"</title>
		<content> In recent years,{Kelso}has had a very 
 impressive record in the{"Britain in  
{Bloom"}competition. The parks, gardens
 and other flower displays in the town 
 are always impressive and beautifully 
 laid out. This is mainly due to the   
 dedicated work of the{Roxburgh        
{District Council Parks Department.}All
 the flowers are home-grown and five   
 gardeners are employed to do the work.
 The displays take 2-3 days to plant   
 and great care is taken over their    
 arrangement.{Kelso}recently won the   
{"Best Small Burgh in Scotland"}prize  
 and also was runner-up to the{"Best   
{Small Town in Britain."}It also won   
 3rd prize in the{"Europe in Bloom"    
 competition. The only annoying problem
 the{Parks Dept.}faces is vandalism.   
 Overall, however, the displays are    
 appreciated by locals and visitors    
 alike.                                </content>
