		<content>      Dyce {police station}was opened  
 in 1981 after being closed for 12     
 years during which it was used as a   
 house.                                
      The station was reopened because 
 of the needs of the growing community.
 The police are involved mainly with   
{vandalism, theft and housebreaking.   
{The police told us that most of these 
{crimes are committed by people under  
{19 years of age.                      
      There are 3 people employed at   
 the police station and it is open for 
 8 hours a day. There are no cells in  
 the station. Cases are passed on to   
 the large police station at Bucksburn.
      Between 1990-1995 the police     
 station will grow in size and will be 
 open 24 hours a day with a larger     
 staff.
