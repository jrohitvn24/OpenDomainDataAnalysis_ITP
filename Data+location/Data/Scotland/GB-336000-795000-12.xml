		<title>12BALLATER GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content> This is a fine 18 hole course set     
 beside the River Dee. The club was    
 first formed in 1892. It serves as    
 an important tourist amenity from May 
 to September. There is a local        
 membership of 713 but relies heavily  
 on visiting players and parties from  
 home and abroad.                      
                                       
 National tournaments are often hosted 
 at Ballater and the club runs its own 
 annual package holiday for golfing    
 enthusiasts. Many of these visitors   
 come from south of the border. This   
 course with the surrounding hills and 
 mountains is one of the most scenic   
 golf courses in Scotland.
