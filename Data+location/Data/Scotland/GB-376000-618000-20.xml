		<title>20THE S.W.R.I. AT HOWNAM</title>
		<content> There is a small but active branch of 
 the S.W.R.I.in the area.Hownam W.R.I. 
 was orriginally founded in 1929.In    
 1934 another was founded at Towford,  
 farther up the Kale valley,but with   
 the outbreak of war all rural         
 activities ceased,till in 1954 some   
 enthusiastic ladies formed a fresh    
 institute combining the 2 orriginal   
 branches under the name of Towford,   
 meetings alternating between Hownam   
 and Towford.For more that a decade all
 the meetings have been at Hownam, and 
 membership varies according to        
 population,at present standing at 20. 
 Members meet 10 times in the year,with
 the sylabus including cookary and hand
 crafts demonstrations,travel talks etc
 A festive dinner is held in December, 
 and summer outings to places of local 
 interest.Members compete at institute 
 and federation level regularly.       </content>
