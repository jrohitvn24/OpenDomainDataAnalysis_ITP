		<content>{Hegglie Ber Jetty}is a small concrete 
 structure measuring 3m 35 cm in       
 length,2m 20cm in width and 3.5m in   
 height.There are 27 steps leading down
 to it.It is built on the{south west   
 side of Sanday,{opposite}the{Calf of  
{Eday,}a neighbouring island.          
 It was{built}in{1980}by Lesley Wilson,
 a local builder, and John Sinclair. It
{cost}about{Â£2000}to build, and        
 although very{rarely used now,}it     
 is still used to transport the{vet to 
{and from Eday.}It was also sometimes  
 used to bring{tourists}to the island  
 during the{summer}and the short       
 journey takes place in the midst of   
 some of the most{spectacular scenery  
 on Sanday.                            
 But during the{winter}and even in the 
 summer, due to the meeting of many    
 different tides,{very strong currents 
 often{prevent mooring of boats.       </content>
