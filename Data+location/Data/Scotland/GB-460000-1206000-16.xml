		<title>16The Ghostly Soldier</title>
		<content> This incident happened in the First   
 World War.There were no cars,but      
 people at this time used gigs,pulled  
 by horses.A man was passing St.Johns  
 kirk,going towards the crossroads when
 suddenly the usually friendly horse   
 pulling the gig shied.It was obviously
 very frightened.The nearest building  
 to the gig was the kirk,so the man    
 riding in the gig looked towards      
 it.Standing there was the faint       
 outline of a soldier.The soldier was  
 wearing a New Zealand or Australian   
 uniform.The man in the gig had to look
 away from the soldier for a while as  
 he had to turn at the crossroads.When 
 he looked back to where the soldier   
 once was standing,in his place stood a
 phantom headless cow.The soldier had  
 died in action at the same time as he 
 appeared and as he used to live in    
 Unst,the horse knew him and shied.    </content>
