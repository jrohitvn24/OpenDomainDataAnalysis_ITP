		<content>  The E quarter is clothedd in Scots   
 Pine &amp; Spruce, an important source of 
 employment.  To the W &amp; S all is      
 heather dominated moorland &amp; upland   
 crags, culminating in the heights of  
 Meall Mor (402m) in the S.  Along the 
 N edge is a band of deciduous         
 woodland, consisting of Rowan, Ash &amp;  
 Silver Birch.   In the NE corner,     
 sandwiched between the deciduous &amp;    
 coniferous woodlands, is a belt of    
 rough grazing which feeds sheep and   
 beef cattle.   At the very N edge is  
 the hamlet of Eskadale, where there is
 a RC Church and a small hatchery.     
 The latter handles 200,000 salmon per 
 year, which are released into Scottish
 waters.  Running through Eskadale, E  
 to W is a minor road (single track    
 with pass in places). Another road    
 crosses this section, running from NE 
 to SW.  Again it has passing places   </content>
