		<title>11Crops in Bourtie/Keithall</title>
		<content> Land over 500 feet within the parishes
 of Bourtie, Keithall and Kinkell      
 includes Hilbrae, Pitgaveny and the   
 Hill of Crimond.  Here farmers qualify
 for a hillfarm subsidy an use the land
 predominantly for the grazing of      
 sheep, although some cattle are also  
 grazed.  The animals find grass       
 between natural stands of gorse and   
 broom and intermittent scrub birch,   
 ash and gean (wild cherry).  On the   
 lower pastures the largest crops are  
 winter-worn barley and grass for      
 silage.  There are, however, smaller  
 harvests of winter wheat, spring      
 barley, some oats and some turnip for 
 cattle feed.  Many grain crops are    
 udersown with grass, so that cattle   
 may us the fields after the main crop 
 has been harvested. Sheep are left out
 all year round, but cattle are kept   
 inside in byres between mid Nov-April.</content>
