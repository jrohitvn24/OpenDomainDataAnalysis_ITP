		<title>12Level Farm.</title>
		<content>  Level Farm situated 4km south of     
 Elgin is owned by Eagle Star Insurance
 Company and rented by Mr Campbell. The
 farm occupies 224 acres. The name     
 level comes from the gaelic labael    
 meaning boggy. It has several byres   
 and a silage pit made of railway      
 sleepers. Barley is grown for malting.
  Mr Campbell normally works an 8 hour 
 day but 16 in harvest. He has 250     
 cattle bought in for Â£300 and sold a  
 year later for Â£450. He buys Limousin,
 Charolais and Simmental at 9 different
 marts from Oban to Elgin. Winter food 
 is silage,hay,propcorned barley and   
 some cattle cake. In winter he runs   
 400 sheep. Farming has become more    
 expensive but much easier with all the
 modern machinery which he owns.
