		<title>15HOUSTON HOUSE HOTEL</title>
		<content>   Houston House is a 16th century     
 mansion and is situated in Uphall near
 Broxburn. It is used by its present   
 owners as a hotel. Originally the land
 was owned by Hughston of Strathbrock  
 and was passed to many people until in
 1526 Sir James Hamilton of Fynart     
 built a mansion on the land. This was 
 called after its first owner but it   
 was changed and instead of 'Hughston' 
 it became known as 'Houston' House and
 it has stayed like that to this day.  
   Inside, the house is beautifully    
 decorated with angels and monsters    
 carved into the ceiling and walls. The
 bedrooms have four-poster beds and the
 furnishings are bright and colourful. 
 Many people visit the house and the   
 large garden behind it which is full  
 of flowers,  adding to the beauty of  
 Houston House.
