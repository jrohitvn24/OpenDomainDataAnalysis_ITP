		<title>07CROFTING</title>
		<content> In Durness the agricultural land is   
 divided up in small farms known as    
 crofts.Traditionally a crofter kept   
 sheep,cows,horses,chickens and grew   
 oats,barley,potatoes,turnip,cabbage,  
 carrots and grew hay.Crofters today   
 don't follow the traditional ways.Only
 a very few people still make their own
 hay and no one grows oats.Potatoes are
 only grown for domestic use.Most      
 crofters have a full time job as well.
 Crofts are used almost exclusively for
 grazing North Country Cheviot sheep.  
 The Crofters Commision is a government
 organisation elected to look after    
 crofting property.The Grazing Committe
 is a local committe elected by the    
 crofters to carry out all the         
 important work connected with sales.  
 They look after the distrubution of   
 income from the sale of sheep. They   
 also look after the common grazing.   </content>
