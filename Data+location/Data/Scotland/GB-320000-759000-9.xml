		<title>09Employment in Glenisla.cont.</title>
		<content> There are two pony-trekking centres in
 Glenisla which provide seasonal       
 employment. These centres encourage   
 people to come to the Glen and they in
 turn use the hotels' facilities thus  
 enabling these establishments to      
 remain open. Since job opportunities  
 are limited, some people have to      
 travel out of the Glen for work. Some 
 women such as nurses and secretaries  
 have to travel as jobs such as these  
 are simply not available. Young people
 leaving school also find it necessary 
 to go out of the Glen to seek         
 employment and most do so. Farm       
 mechanisation has, over the years,    
 resulted in the need for fewer farm   
 labourers. Population has therefore   
 decreased and it seems unlikely that  
 this trend will change. Fewer jobs    
 equals fewer people.
