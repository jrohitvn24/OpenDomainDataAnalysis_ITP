		<title>15LANDSCAPE..FARM BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> The 75 acre farm at St. Mary's lies   
 tucked away discreetly in the lowest  
 part of the valley.The buildings which
 date from the middle of the 19th      
 century are in a good state of repair 
 and the whole farm has been put under 
 a conservation order as a list"B"     
 building.The layout of the courtyard, 
 the attractive red pan tile roofs, the
 original roof timbers and the total   
 absence of modern structures combine  
 to make the farm most interesting.    
 Originally the land was worked by the 
 farmer and one labourer,the 75 acres  
 being the area they could manage with 
 horse and plough.The original fields  
 are still in existence though the land
 is now owned and worked by a          
 neighbouring farmer.It is to be hoped 
 that St.Mary's will still be intact in
 50 years time.
