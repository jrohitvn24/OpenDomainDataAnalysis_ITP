		<content>   {Mayfest}is an annual celebration of
 dance, music and drama.  This was its 
 third year and it took place from 6th 
 to 18th May.  Many of the performances
 were carried out by both children and 
 adults with no previous experience.The
{ "Steps Out"}Scottish Ballet team of  
 five dancers and one musician worked  
 with sixty people from our local area 
 to produce a performance called "The  
 Garthamlock Award Ceremony".  Those   
 taking part ranged from 5 years to    
 30 years old, and included children   
 from six of the local schools.  After 
 four rehearsals the final show was    
 performed in Garthamlock Community    
 Centre. Each group of dancers         
 "nominated" a film, dancing to the    
 music from it.  The primary group won 
 with their{"Ghostbusters"} dance while
 other nominations included "East Side 
 Story" and "Killer Thriller".         </content>
