		<title>06STRATHTYRUM ESTATE</title>
		<content> The farm land to the West of the town 
 is part of the Strathtyrum Estate. It 
 has been the property of the Cheape   
 family since 1780 and the present     
 owner is Mrs Cheape, a widow without  
 children. Strathtyrum House was built 
 in the 18th Century and has a very    
 impressive frontage added by Robert   
 Balfour in the early 19th century.    
 There is a 17th century doocot in the 
 grounds and a family mausoleum.       
 Balgove and Strathtyrum Farms are     
 managed by a Chartered Surveyor,      
 D.Reid of Cupar and the farm houses   
 are let. The land is used for grazing 
 both sheep and cattle and for a range 
 of arable crops. This year, as an     
 experiment, 2 fields on  Balgove Farm 
 have been set aside to grow wheat and 
 oats by organic methods. The owners of
 Strathtyrum retain the right to dig   
 for shells on the Old Course.         </content>
