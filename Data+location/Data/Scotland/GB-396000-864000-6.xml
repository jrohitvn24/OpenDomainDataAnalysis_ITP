		<content>   My father is fisherman on a purse   
 net boat.He catches{mackrel}or{herring
 (depending the time of year). They    
 stop fishing at the start of summer   
 for about one or two months to repaint
 or repair the boat. After this break  
 they go to the{herring fisheries}and  
 they have to change their nets for    
 this.When they are at sea they search 
 for shoals of herring in the fishing  
 grounds and once they have found the  
 herring they first of all shoot a bow 
 called the{"dan".}Then they shoot the 
 whole net going round in a circle.    
 Then they pull both ends together to  
 form a large bag and put a{pump}in the
 net to pump the fish into the tanks.  
 they chill the water to make the fish 
 stay fresh longer.
