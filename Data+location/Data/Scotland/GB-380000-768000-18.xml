		<title>18Gourdon Bowling Club</title>
		<content> A meeting organised by{Gourdon        
{Community Council}was held in 1979 to 
 try to set up a committee for a       
 Recreational Club, with the purpose of
 starting{carpet bowls.                
 A sponsored walk was proposed for fund
 raising and this was a great success. 
 The sum raised was Â£316.99 which was  
 used to pay for two sets of bowls.    
 Sidlaw Industries kindly gifted two   
 bowling mats.                         
 The bowling opened on the 3rd Oct     
 1979. There are around 40 to 50       
 members every year who play for a     
 singles, doubles and mixed doubles    
 trophy. The club has a pool table     
 which attracts younger members who    
 also enjoy taking part in the bowling 
 competitions. The season runs from    
{October to April,}meeting on Wednesday
 and Friday evenings.
