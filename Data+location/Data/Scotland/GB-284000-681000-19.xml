 a{mental hospital.}"A group of primary
 school children visited Bellsdyke{    
{psychiatric hospital}to see what it   
 was like and found that the main aim  
 is to rehabilitate patients as fast as
 possible-{short term patients}.For the
{long term patients},the aim was to    
 make their lives as happy and         
 fulfilled as possible.The hospital has
 a village atmosphere with well laid   
 out grounds and a vast range of       
 activities-putting,art,disco          
 dancing .Patients are encouraged      
 to go on holiday,support football     
 teams,have their hair done at the     
 hospital salons.They can help in the  
 hospital,or grounds or with the soft  
 toy,picture framing,hut making etc.The
 visitors were impressed by the sincere
 care,concern and enthusiasm of the    
 staff they met.                       </content>
