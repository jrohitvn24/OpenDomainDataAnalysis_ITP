		<title>16POULTRY FARM (PURRELDEGGIE)</title>
		<content>     On every farm there are{4}units of
 sheds.  Each end of the shed contains 
 20,000 chickens.  There are at least  
{160,000}chickens on every farm.       
     When the chicks arrive they are   
 only 1 day old.  Before they arrive,  
 we have to prepare for their delivery,
 by filling each  shed with wood       
 shavings.                             
     The chickens are reared from when 
 they are 1 day old to when they leave,
 approximately 9 weeks later, unless   
 they contract{"Foul Pest"}a fatal     
 disease common among chickens.  To    
 prevent disease spreading visiting    
 vehicles are disinfected along with   
 visitors footwear.                    
     After the chickens are sold we    
 await another batch to start the      
 process over again.
