		<content> Rolling uplands, nearly all over 500  
 feet, lies east of the Leader valley  
 and north of the Tweed valley, and    
 includes the east side of the Allan   
 valley.  Nearly all productive,       
 chiefly as rough pasture with sheep   
 and some cattle, but with many fields 
 of managed grassland or barley; many  
 small woods, chiefly conifers with    
 some Scots pines, planted often in    
 strips as wind-breaks.  Mostly worked 
 from valley farms, but there are two  
 substantial farms near the centre of  
 the block.  Apart from these and      
 associated cottages, no inhabitants   
 and no roads except the one to these  
 two farms.  Two lochans, one shown on 
 the 50,000 OS map and the other on the
 20,000.  Good walking country,        
 traversed by the Melrose-Lauder       
 section othe the Southern Upland Way.
