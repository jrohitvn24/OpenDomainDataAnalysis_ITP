		<content>   Birdlife is quite remarkable for    
 such a small area.The{great crested   
{grebe}and the{sedge}and{garden}       
{warblers}are to be seen at Loch Libo, 
 as are large flocks of migrant{whooper
{swans}throughout the winter.          
  The woods of Caldwell Law are visited
 autumn and spring by large flocks of  
{redwing}and{fieldfare}.The{buzzard}has
 been a summer visitor and the{black}  
{grouse}is an ex-resident.             
  {Roe deer ,moles}in plenty,{shrew,   
{hare}and{rabbits}are common wildlife. 
{Foxes}are still active but they are no
 longer a threat to farms as there is  
 little free-ranging poultry.          
   Recently our{badger}colony was wiped
 out by gun- and terrier-toting vandals
 though we hope the badger setts will  
 be recolonised from outside the area.
