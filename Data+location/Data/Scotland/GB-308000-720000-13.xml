		<title>13Bell's Whisky Loses Battle.</title>
		<content>  Until Friday 23rd August, Perth was  
 the world headquarters and home of    
{Arthur Bell and Sons,}distillers of   
{Bell's Old Scotch Whisky}since 1825.  
  Over the past{160 years}Bell's have  
 contributed to the commercial and     
 social life of Perth. The former by   
 bringing business to the town and the 
 latter by funding local{charities}and 
 events; building{housing}for their    
 employees at Gannochy and creating the
 large{Bell's Sports' Centre,}Cricket  
 Pavilion and new tennis courts.       
  After a bitter ten week struggle, the
 Irish brewers,{Guinness}succeeded in  
 their takeover bid at a cost of Â£350m.
  Perth citizens must now wait to see  
 what long term effects this change in 
 ownership will have on them, if any.  
 Sufficient to say we are seeing the   
{end of an era,}but Perth people will  
 always have cause to{thank Bell's.    </content>
