		<content> In Parkneuk there are mostly council  
 houses and the remaining few are      
 private.Most of the council houses are
 flats and the others are terraced.On  
 one side of the road there are mostly 
 private houses.In Clunivar Street     
 there are all flats.In the flats there
 are two houses upstairs and two       
 downstairs.These flats are on one side
 of Blackburn Avenue.And from the end  
 of them there are terraced villas.    
     In Carnock about half of the      
 houses are modern and private and the 
 remaining half are quite old.The      
 housing there has grown in the past   
 twenty years.
