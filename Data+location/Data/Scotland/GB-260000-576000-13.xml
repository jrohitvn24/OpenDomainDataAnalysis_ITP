		<content>  Approximately 50% of the  adult male 
 population is involved in forestry,   
 from planting to processing. There is 
 a sawmill at Glenlee.10% are farmers. 
 9% work at the Galloway Hydro_electric
 Board and 8% are involved in tourism, 
 i.e.Hotel owners and publicans.       
 Another 3% work on the 2 Fish         
 Farms, one at Kenmure and the         
 other at Glenlee. 70% of  the women   
 interview are involved in tourism_    
 mostly in hotel work or caring for the
 holiday homes.10% work at the local   
 knitwear factory and another 4% work  
 in the local shops. Untilrecently, a  
 small proportion of women worked in   
 fish processing but the fish are now  
 transported directly out of the area. 
 U nfortunately, there are few openings
 in forestry and the unemployed are    
 mainly early school leavers(not sons  
 of farmers)for whom Y.O.P.tries to aid</content>
