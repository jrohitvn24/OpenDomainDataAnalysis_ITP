		<content> The most common trees (apart from     
 those on forestry land) are alder,    
 elder, rowan (locally-rodden),birch,  
 sycamore,beech,ash, willow and a few  
 white-beam. There are no oak trees in 
 the area. Bog plants proliferate e.g. 
 water speedwell. The germander        
 speedwell is also found in            
 profusion.Until recently there were   
 vast numbers of giant hogweed plants, 
 but now few are left since the        
 eradication programme started a few   
 years ago.                            
 A new sewage works ,using the         
 settlement-tank method,was built by   
 the side of the Bogie in 1978/79. The 
 effluent is pumped to an old quarry by
 the road where twin tanks allow       
 settlement. The clean water is pumped 
 back to the Bogie. Till that date raw 
 sewage flowed untreated into the      
 river.                                </content>
