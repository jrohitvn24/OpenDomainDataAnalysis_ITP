		<title>13RELIGION - TEVIOTHEAD</title>
		<content> THERE IS A PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH AT     
 TEVIOTHEAD. THE KIRK HAS A MEMBERSHIP 
 OF ONE HUNDRED BUT THE AVERAGE NUMBER 
 ATTENDING THE FORTNIGHTLY SERVICE IS  
 TEN. THE CHURCH IS LINKED WITH THE OLD
 PARISH CHURCH IN HAWICK. THE MINISTER 
 LIVES IN THE MANSE IN HAWICK AND      
 SERVES BOTH CONGREGATIONS.            
 RECENTLY A SUNDAY SCHOOL WAS SET UP.  
 ATTEMPTS AT SUCH A VENTURE IN PREVIOUS
 YEARS FAILED DUE TO POOR SUPPORT,     
 HOWEVER THERE ARE MORE YOUNGSTERS IN  
 THE DISTRICT NOW.                     
 A DOZEN OF THE LADY MEMBERS FORM THE  
 WOMEN'S GUILD WHO MEET MONTHLY DURING 
 THE WINTER IN EACH OTHER'S HOMES.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
