		<title>02Landscape In Jedburgh</title>
		<content>  The main feature of the area is the  
 River Jed.It flows north through the  
 western part of our block.The A.68    
 more or less follows its course along 
 part of the valley.In many places one 
 bank rises very steeply whereas the   
 other is flat ground known as a haugh 
 in Scotland.Just outside the town the 
 escarpments,referred to locally as    
 scaurs,reveal the red sandstone       
 underlying the area.There are numerous
 small wooded glens with tiny streams. 
 When one has climbed out of the valley
 there is rolling countryside to the   
 east.The urban landscape is dominated 
 by the Abbey,on its small rise facing 
 south,and by the Castle Jail sited    
 high above the town.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
