		<content> burial chamber.  This area is mainly  
 crofting and forestry. The crofting   
 land around Glaick is used to grow    
 crops or grass for cattle. To the     
 south of Ardross is a castle: it has  
 recently been bought by a big firm    
 based in London. They are now         
 renovating and restoring the castle.  
 To the south of the castle is the     
 River Averon. This runs past Ardross  
 and through to Alness where it flows  
 into the Cromarty Firth. It is a clean
 river frequently used for fishing, but
 permission must be sought for this.   
 All the land on both sides of the     
 Averon is privately owned.  Ardross is
 a rural farming community with        
 mountains in the distance and green   
 fertile hills surrounding the small   
 farmhouses and buildings.
