		<title>13TRANSPORT FROM N.S.</title>
		<content>   Newton Stewart has four main roads  
 radiating from it.One leads north     
 towards Glasgow,one south through     
 towns and villages to the coast,one   
 west towards Stranraer,and one east   
 towards Dumfries.The road which       
 runs east to west is the{A75}         
 Euororoute.Newton Stewart was bypassed
 in recent years because of the large  
 lorries coming through.In Newton      
 Stewart we have no railway.We had one 
 running from{Stranraer to Dumfries,  }
 passing through Gatehouse,Castle      
 Douglas,and other places.It was closed
 down in the 1960s because not enough  
 people were using it.Our two nearest  
 stations are Barrhill,about 17 miles  
 to the north,and Stranraer,about 25   
 miles to the west.Stranraer is one of 
 the two ports on Loch Ryan,and{Sealink
 do a short sea crossing to{Larne}in   
 Northern Ireland.                     </content>
