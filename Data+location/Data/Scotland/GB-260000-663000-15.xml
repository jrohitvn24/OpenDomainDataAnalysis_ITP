		<content> Mr Maitland Kerr, aged 8l, lives alone
 in a rented 3-apartment cottage flat. 
 He has no close relatives, no home    
 help, and looks after himself, in     
 spite of breaking his back in North   
 Africa during the war and being       
 completely blind for the last six     
 months due to cataracts.              
 He usually wakens at 7 a.m. He studies
 Physical Culture and exercises each   
 morning. He then makes a hearty       
 breakfast of porridge, egg and bread. 
 Every day, summer and winter, he goes 
 out for long walks. After lunch he    
 visits friends, one of whom has a     
 broken shoulder bone at present.      
 Sometimes he does some gardening and  
 he is a keen rose grower. After tea if
 he is not out visiting he spends his  
 evenings reading and listening to     
 classical music before going to bed at
 midnight.                             </content>
