		<content> Hazlehead Golf Courses, Aberdeen.     
 There are excellent facilities for    
 golfers at Hazlehead which boasts two 
 eighteen hole and one nine hole course
 covering an area of 100 acres with an 
 overall length of 3600m. All 3 courses
 are a pleasure to play being situated 
 in picturesque woodland and giving the
 less keen golfer the opportunity to do
 a bit of wild life spotting as deer   
 and rabbit inhabit the area. Some     
 holes have recently been improved,    
 greens have been enlarged, new bunkers
 dug and trees planted. The cost of a  
 round of golf ranges from Â£1.65 to    
 Â£3.60. The Nineteenth hole is very    
 popular with club members as          
 refreshments can be obtained there.   
 Attached to the club house is a shop  
 which sells souvenirs and golfing     
 equipment.                            
                                       </content>
