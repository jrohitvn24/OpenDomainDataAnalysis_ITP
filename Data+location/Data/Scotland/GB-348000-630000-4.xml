 In the recent past it would have been 
 true to describe home life at LINDEAN 
 as unexceptional in so far as there   
 were no divorcees or single-parent    
 families in the area.As national      
 statistics for these categories now   
 show marked increases in both and as  
 there have been no comparable changes 
 in the survey area, LINDEAN must now  
 be described as "exceptional".24      
 households comprise family units of   
 parents and children living           
 together.In addition,there are 6      
 instances of one or more grandparents 
 of these families resident within the 
 block.These figures suggest a         
 close-knit community.In fact they     
 represent a minority of the total     
 number,the majority of families being 
 best described as "bed-and-breakfast" 
 householders.                         </content>
