		<title>17FARMING AROUND LAMLASH.</title>
		<content>    The type of farming that exists in 
 Lamlash consists mainly of dairy      
 farming with some smaller areas used  
 for arable crops.                     
    Lamlash grew as an area for farming
 due to the quality of the soils which 
 are derived from boulder clays,       
 moraines and old beaches.The farmers  
 favour the climate because Lamlash    
 receives the right amount of rain     
 and it is sheltered from high winds.  
    The farming 'Belt' lies in a       
 diagonal of grid squares parallel with
 the beach.There is a contrast in the  
 type of farming that takes place in   
 the northern areas.Here the farming is
 more concentrated on arable farming,  
 whereas the farming in the southern   
 parts is mainly dairy with some arable
 crops.
