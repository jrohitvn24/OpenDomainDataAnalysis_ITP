		<title>01Scottish Border Hill Country</title>
		<content>    This is the hilly land of the      
 Border Country, sharply broken hills  
 with little burns running in all      
 directions before feeding into the    
 White Esk which runs South.  It rises 
 three feet from a few days of rain and
 falls just as quickly.                
    The fishing is good, but better a  
 valley or two further south where the 
 water is more constant and the fish   
 bigger.  Holiday makers are welcomed, 
 there are a few holiday cottages to   
 rent but it is not popular enough to  
 influence the economy.                
    The hills are dominated by the     
 conifers of the Forestry Commission,  
 but the bottom land where the road and
 the scattered houses are is rich      
 cultivated pasture and despite the    
 ubiquitous pines the countryside is   
 varied, colourful, ever changing and  
 strikingly beautiful.                 </content>
