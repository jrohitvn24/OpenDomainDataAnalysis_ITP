		<content>     {THE PIPER OF WINDY HA}           
  Long ago on a farm in the Caithness  
 parish of{Olrig}lived a lazy boy named
 Peter Waters,whose job was to look    
 after the kye.One day while looking   
 after the kye on the{Fairy Hillock}at 
 Sysa,he fell asleep.                  
  Suddenly he was awakened by a        
 beautiful lady,dressed in green ,who  
 offered him two gifts-{pipes}to make  
 him a great piper ,or a{Bible}to make 
 him a great preacher.He decided to    
 take the pipes. However,the green lady
 told him that he must return at sunset
 in exactly seven years time.          
  In time he became so rich that he had
 to make a{kist}in which to keep all   
 his money.In seven years time he      
 returned to Sysa and was never seen   
 again.Some travellers say that they   
 have heard muffled piping coming from 
 underground.Could it be Peter?        </content>
