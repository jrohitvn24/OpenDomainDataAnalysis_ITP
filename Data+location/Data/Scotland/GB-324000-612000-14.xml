		<title>14ETTRICK VALLEY SERVICES.</title>
		<content>   The valley of Ettrick is about 18   
 miles away from Selkirk our closest   
 town and because we are so remote all 
 the services we get have to come a    
 long way.                             
   On Monday,Wednesday and Friday the  
 Milkman comes from Galashiels 27miles 
 away selling milk,cream and bread.    
   On Wednesday the Baker comes 19miles
 from Hawick,he sells bread,cakes and  
 groceries.                            
   Each week on a rota a Postman brings
 post and papers 18miles from Selkirk  
 to the families in the valley.        
   Once a fortnight on Friday a Library
 Van comes 27miles from Galashiels in  
 the van there are shelves with books  
 for people with different tastes.     
   On a Tuesday a courier bus takes the
 people who need transport to Ettrick- 
 bridge where another bus takes them to
 Selkirk.                              </content>
