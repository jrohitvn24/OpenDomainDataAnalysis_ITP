		<content>    The majority of houses in the area 
 are either privately owned or         
 privately rented. The only Council    
 houses are situated in Wellbank.      
    The largest village in the area is 
 Wellbank, which contains a variety of 
 house styles, including local         
 authority houses, older style villas  
 and cottages, and a fairly large      
 housing estate.                       
    Other smaller communities are to be
 found at Kellas, which consists mainly
 of individual detached houses, and    
 Westhall Terrace, which is a group pf 
 terraced houses built originally to   
 accommodate workers at the now disused
 Duntrune Quarries.                    
    There are plans for further        
 building of private houses at Kellas, 
 where two modern bungalows are at     
 present being built, and at           
 Bucklershead.                         </content>
