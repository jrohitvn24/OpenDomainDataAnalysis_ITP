		<title>15Crime in Linlithgow</title>
		<content>   Being a community town,Linlithgow   
 does not have a high crime rate.There 
 are ten officers stationed here and   
 they work a system of three eight-hour
 shifts.They can have assistance from  
 headquarters in Livingston.           
   Perhaps the most common crime is    
 break-ins-to cars rather than to      
 houses or shops.Vandalism is prevalant
 but frequently is not reported to the 
 police.                               
   Parking in Linlithgow is a major    
 problem,but traffic wardens from      
 Bathgate take some of the pressure off
 the police.A parking offence will cost
 the offender a fine of Â£10 with three 
 weeks to pay.                         
    Glue-sniffing is not popular.      
 Youngsters here seem to realise the   
 danger.Shoplifting does not occur     
 often as there are only two large     
 stores in the town.                   </content>
