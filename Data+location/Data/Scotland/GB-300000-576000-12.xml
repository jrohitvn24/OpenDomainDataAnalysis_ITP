 There used to have a wall up the      
 middle of the playground to separate  
 the boys and girls. Now we play       
 together.                             
 Where our football pitch is now, it   
 used to be a huge garden.             
 They had very little sports then, but 
 we have sports all the year round.    
 They used to have two coal fires. Now 
 we have storage heaters in each room. 
 The toilets used to be outside. Ours  
 are inside.                           
 We have no prize giving now.          
 There were no school dinners then, but
 we get a two course meal daily for    
 55p.

 Children went to school with shorts   
 and clogs. They had bare feet in      
 summer.
