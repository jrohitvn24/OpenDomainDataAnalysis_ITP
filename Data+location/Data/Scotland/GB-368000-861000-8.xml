		<title>08Banff Primary School</title>
		<content> I am a pupil in Banff Primary School. 
 Our school is an old building and is  
 situated on a hill to the west of the 
 town.Below us is a car park to which  
 the school buses bring pupils who live
 far away. The building that we use was
 first built in 1849. It has been used 
 for a museum, a school for the        
 mentally handicapped and was also used
 as Banff Academy at one time.The      
 school is in two blocks: there is a   
 lower block with primaries 1-3 in it  
 and a higher block with primaries 4-7 
 in it.We do not have playing fields at
 our school ; instead we have to go    
 down the hill to Duff House playing   
 fields.The school has a front sloped  
 garden where, in summer, you can sit  
 out and do your work. I enjoy being at
 my school because there us a nice     
 atmosphere.
