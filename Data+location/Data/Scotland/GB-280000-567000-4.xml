		<title>04Springholm Primary School</title>
		<content> Springholm's new primary school was   
 opened on the 20th October 1969,and Mr
 Bailey,the Director of Education,was  
 present for its opening. There were   
 five teachers and a Headmaster,and a  
 role of 120 children. Among the pupils
 attending were from Kirkpatrick       
 Durham,Crocketford,and of course      
 Springholm. Today Springholm has a    
 total of around 80 children. It has   
 four teachers including Mr Doherty who
 teaches P6/7 and is also the Head. One
 of the new subjects which has been    
 introduced is Computer Studies. They  
 have 2 computers and they give the    
 children keyboard experience which    
 will help in Secondary School. At the 
 moment the primary has no Extra       
 Curricular Activities because the EIS,
 the main teaching union, have asked   
 all teachers to withdraw their        
 goodwill since August 1984.           </content>
