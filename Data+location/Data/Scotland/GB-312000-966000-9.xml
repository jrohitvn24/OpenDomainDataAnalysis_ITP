		<title>09RURAL PETROL PRICE SCANDAL</title>
		<content>   Recently our local newspaper        
 highlighted the terrible cost of fuel 
 in our part of the country.           
  {Caithness Courier 12th June 1985.   
{  'The price of petrol in some rural  
{areas has been described as crippling 
{by the RAC and they are trying to     
{bring the problem to the attention of 
{the Government.                       
{  The RAC claimed that motorists are  
{now sharply divided according to      
{whether they live in the town or      
{country and point out that rural      
{drivers face more wear and tear to    
{their cars because they have to use   
{bumpy roads on which spending has sunk
{as low as Â£1 per kilometre in some    
{areas. But, according  to the RAC, the
{most serious problem is the cost of   
{petrol'.}e.g. Petrol at Â£2 per gallon 
 in Cities and South is Â£2.10 in       
 Caithness and Â£2.26 on some islands.  </content>
