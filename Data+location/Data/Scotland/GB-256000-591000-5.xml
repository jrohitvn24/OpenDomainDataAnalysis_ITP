		<content>{SPEANING}Speaning starts in about     
 August.(Speaning means separating the 
 lambs from their mothers).This is done
 by driving them from the pen and      
 through a race .A man at the end      
 separates the ewes into one pen and   
 the lambs into another.               
{DRAFT EWE SALE}The ewes are dipped at 
 the same time for the draft ewe sale  
 at Castle Douglas in September.(Draft 
 ewes are 5 years old).The price for a 
 fairly good ewe is around Â£35-Â£40.    
{LAMB SALES}From August onwards, lambs 
 are sold either store or to kill. {   
{WINTERING}In about October the        
 stock ewe hogs go to a farm on lower  
 ground, for the winter.Ewes are kept  
 on the hill.The tups go out with the  
 ewes from mid November until the new  
 year.Unless there is heavy snow, the  
 ewes are not fed until about six weeks
 before lambing time.                  </content>
