		<content> In June 1985 a BBC Television Team    
 filmed P7 pupils of Drumoak  School   
 for a television series{Odyssey.}The  
 producer first visited the class and  
 did a radio recording of the pupils in
 which  they spoke about the use of    
{local dialect words}in our everyday   
 speech.A week later he returned with a
 Television Crew and filmed members of 
 the class using dialect words still   
 in use in the North East. Some of the 
 words are:'pints' - shoe laces,'beets'
 - boots, 'loon' - boy. A sentence     
 using these words might be:{'The loon 
{broke the  pints o his beets fan he   
{pit them on'}-' The boy broke his boot
 laces when he put them on'. After     
 filming in the classroom,two pupils   
 were filmed at Drum Castle telling the
 story of a Scots ballad - The Laird o 
 Drum. The programme called{'The Mother
{Tongue'}is due to be shown Oct. 1985. </content>
