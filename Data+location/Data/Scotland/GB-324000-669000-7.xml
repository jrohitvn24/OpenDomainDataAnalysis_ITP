		<content>{Skipping}is a girls game where 2      
 people hold a rope at each end and    
 turn it round (this is called         
{"cawing").}Somebody stands in the     
 middle of the rope when it is turning 
 and jumps with the beat of the rope   
 while everyone usually sings little   
 rhyming song.A favourite game of the  
 moment is{"Chainy".}It is very like   
 "Tig".At least 3 people are needed.   
 One child is designated to be on and  
 after counting to 21 he/she runs after
 the remaining players whereupon they  
 form a chain by holding hands.These 2 
 games are usually played in the       
 playground most of the yeare round.   
 Other games can be seasonal like      
{"conkers".}Conkers drop from the      
 Horsechesnut tree in the Autumn.They  
 are each attached to string for       
 hitting other conkers.A strong one    
 wins by breaking the weaker conkers.  </content>
