		<title>06Paisley Girls' Fashions</title>
		<content>  A survey of girls at our school      
 showed that they have fairly definite 
 ideas about fashions today.{Trousers  
 are by far the most popular, with     
{skirts}following closely. Dresses are 
 unpopular.The favourite trousers are  
 jeans, but people also wear "catpants"
 and baggy styles. The favourite skirt 
 style is straight,medium length.      
 "Minis" are popular, with few liking  
 long, full skirts.{The choice of      
{material}is varied, the most popular  
 being plain and checked. A number of  
 people liked striped, spotted or      
 slogan-printed material. Flower prints
 currently in vogue with fashion       
 designers, are not so popular.People  
 prefer a subtle look - pastel shades, 
 blacks and greys, instead of bright   
 colours.{Favourite shops}have a wide  
 range of clothes and cater for the    
{young casual look.                    </content>
