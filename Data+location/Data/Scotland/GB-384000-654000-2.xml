		<title>02HOUSING IN CHIRNSIDE</title>
		<content> The population of Chirnside is about  
 1100. Most of the older houses were   
 built on either side of the Main      
 Street and down the Crosshill. There  
 is a mixture of privately owned and   
 council properties. In the south of   
 the village, a large new council      
 scheme was built from 1971 onwards.   
 This provided housing for an influx of
 workers who were employed by the local
 paper mill which had been re-opened   
 that year. The rent for a 4-apartment 
 council house is Â£25 per week.        
 A private estate of 19 detached houses
 has been built at the east end of the 
 village, beginning in 1973. Several   
 other private houses have been built  
 throughout the village.               
 The Loaning,a development of sheltered
 housing, built by Kirk Care Housing   
 Association and Berwickshire District 
 Council, was opened in 1984.          </content>
