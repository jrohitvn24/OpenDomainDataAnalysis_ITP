		<content> Our local{conservation group}(the SCV)
 has been working for 3 years helping  
 their environment. The volunteers,with
 different backgrounds,do a{range of   
{work from fencing to pond creation}The
 skills to carry out these tasks have  
 been built up over the years through  
 training courses.In 1985 the group was
 working for Cambusbarron community    
 council erecting posts to mark rights 
 of way in the vicinity of the village.
 The group have also been asked to     
 build stiles to protect fences        
 belonging to the farmers whose land   
 adjoins the rights of way .This task  
 was undertaken because the community  
 council felt that it would be encour- 
 aging people to walk in a responsible 
 manner.We have got a wildlife site in 
 our area called{Polmaise Estate.}It's 
 main points of interest are relict    
 deciduous woodland and ponds.         </content>
