		<title>08Balmullo Gala Day</title>
		<content> Mrs Scott, who stays in the village,  
 remembered how much happiness was     
 created by Gala Days in her village   
 when she was a child, and so she      
 decided to organise a similar event in
 Balmullo.                             
 Two years ago it was decided to       
 amalgamate the Gala Day with Sports   
 Day.   Preparations take several      
 months to ensure a full and smooth    
 programme of events on the day. A Gala
 Queen, a Herald, two attendants and a 
 Page Boy are elected by the primary   
 school pupils.   For several weeks    
 before the Gala, these pupils attend  
 rehearsals and have their costumes    
 fitted.                               
 This day is also used as a            
 fund-raising occasion for the various 
 societies in the village.   People can
 buy plants, toys and snacks for       
 example and try competitions.         </content>
