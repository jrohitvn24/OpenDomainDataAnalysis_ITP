		<content> On Wednesday 22nd of May at 1.30pm, I 
 interviewed Mr.S. The newsagents has  
 been there for 75 years and Mr.S has  
 been in the newsagent business for 21 
 years now.                            
 He works from Monday to Sunday, twelve
 hours a day. He gets up each morning  
 at 6.00am to make up the runs for the 
 newspaper boys.                       
 He has two assistants, his wife and   
 daughter, without whom his life would 
 be very hard.                         
 Mr.S's shop sells practically         
 everything, including a vast range of 
 magazines, from Beanos and Dandys to  
 Harpers and Queens.                   
 He has half an hour for his breakfast 
 and an hour and a half for his lunch. 
 His spare time is spent playing bowls 
 and attending to his 85 or more racing
 pigeons.                              
                                       </content>
