		<title>04Stoneyburn Farm.</title>
		<content> Mr Henderson owns about 450 acres.    
 150 acres of arable land and the rest 
 is hill grazing.He owns cattle and    
 sheep.He has about 400 ewes,50 hogs   
 and the remainder are lambs.In May he 
 usually puts the cattle out to grass  
 but they can't go out yet as the grass
 is late this year.                    
 Mr Henderson usually goes to Lanark   
 Market but sometimes he goes to Biggar
 or Thornhill.                         
 Mr Henderson said that a day on the   
 farm starts at 6:15am.He feeds the    
 cattle,gets tractor work done,then    
 feeds the cattle again at night.He    
 told us that to be a good farmer you  
 need to be a good stockman to tell if 
 any animal is ill and be able to look 
 after the crops.
