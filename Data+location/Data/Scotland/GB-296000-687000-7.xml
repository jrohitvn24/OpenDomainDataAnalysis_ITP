		<title>07MINING</title>
		<content> A mine is a road way driven from the  
 surface at a pre-determined grid. The 
 road ways of the Bogside Mine travel  
 under our area. There are a few air   
 shafts which are shown on our Ordnance
 Survey Map which indicates the extent 
 of the planning consent of the        
 mine.The mine is no longer producing  
 coal but a staff of forty three still 
 maintain the mine. The coal still     
 contained under ground is reckoned to 
 be of high quality. Also in our area  
 are two bings. Bings are heaps of     
 residue from mine workings. These are 
 unsightly to look at but the N.C.B.   
 have plans to landscape the area again
 once the mining is exhausted. Pathways
 follow up the bings to deposit the    
 residue on the top until the bing is  
 completed and conical in shape.
