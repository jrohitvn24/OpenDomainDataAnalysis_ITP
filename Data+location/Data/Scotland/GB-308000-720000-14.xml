		<title>14M90 By-pass Relieves Perth.</title>
		<content>  With{two trunk roads}in our area, the
{A90}from the south and{A9}from the    
 west, the{completion}of the southern  
 half of the{Western by-pass M90,      
 linking both, should have eased some  
 of the{traffic chaos}in{Perth.}Not so,
 as during the{tourist season}most     
 north-bound visitors must pass through
 the town. It can be chaotic especially
 at week ends.                         
{ This October,}however, the{final     
{phase}of the western by-pass will be  
 completed. It will link the M90 south 
 of Perth with the A9 northbound. At   
 Broxden interchange there is a link-up
 with the A9 for west bound traffic. A 
 mile or so further on a slip road will
 lead on to the road to Crieff. This   
 was only built as the result of public
 pressure on the Scottish Secretary of 
 State.
