		<content>  There are two Fire Stations in our   
 area one soley for airport use and the
 other for local use.                  
  The men at the airport work a shift  
 system of seven men during airport    
 hours. At nights one shift will be "on
 call" in case of an emergency. Quite  
 a few of the men live outwith our     
 area.                                 
  At the local fire station the men are
 part_time and are only at the station 
 for drills and in the case of         
 emergencies.                          
  The Castguards are only auxiliary,   
 but are called out in emergencies and 
 also, visit the "hut" from time to    
 time.                                 
  The two hotels and the Sumburgh      
 Social Club employ people seasonly for
 part_time and full_time work.         
  The traditional industries of farming
 and fishing employ fewer people today.</content>
