		<title>07COAL AND OIL</title>
		<content>  Houses in Lismore have welcoming coal
 fires, because{coal}is the one thing  
 actually{cheaper}than on the mainland.
  Coal comes from a port near a coal   
 mine by{puffer,}and there is no coal  
 merchant on the island.               
  A{COAL CLUB}has two unpaid officials 
 who order the coal and collect the    
 money.                                
  When the{coal boat}comes in all the  
 tractors and trailers on the island   
 go to the pier: people collect their  
 own coal, and deliver to those with no
 vehicles.                             
  The coal boat comes{once a year,     
 usually in{May,}and its load is{120   
{tons.}All coal weight is approximate. 
  Some houses and the school have      
 oil=fired central heating.{Oil}comes  
 by{tanker}lorry from Oban and is much 
 more expensive.{Diesel}for tractors   
 comes in this way too.                </content>
