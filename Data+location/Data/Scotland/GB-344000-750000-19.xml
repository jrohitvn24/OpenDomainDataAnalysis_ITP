		<title>19EMPLOYMENT CHANGES IN FORFAR</title>
		<content> The grave stones in Forfar Parish     
 Church show many{Weavers,}Tailors and 
 Dyers.This is because Forfar was a    
 very important town for making cloth. 
 There used to be 3,000 weavers in     
 Forfar making linen.                  
 The weaver's{pay}was just over a pound
 for a woman and just under 2 pounds   
 for a man.                            
 The{hours}were very long:56 hours a   
 week. Hooters were used to tell the   
 workers it was time to get up,time for
 lunch or going home time.Most of the  
 jute mills have now gone.The factory  
 chimneys which were seen all over the 
 town are gone as well.In their place  
 are modern polypropylene factories,   
 supermarkets and housing schemes.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
