		<content>    At our school, the girls play      
 different games to suit the weather,  
 but the boys' all year round favourite
 game is football. Boys occasionally   
 play shinty and sometimes join the    
 girls for British Bulldogs or Hide and
 Seek.                                 
    Girls enjoy hockey and made up     
 games based on T.V. programmes like   
 Grange Hill. Handstands are popular or
 just chatting. Skipping games are     
 played to rhymes partly made up by the
 girls.                                
    When snow comes, everybody can have
 snowball fights on the pitch or use   
 plastic sacks to slide down the slope 
 at the back of the school.            
    When the weather is cold and wet   
 we stay in the corridors where the    
 boys practise breakdancing. In the    
 girls' cloakrooms, they sometimes play
 Bom Bom Be A.                         </content>
