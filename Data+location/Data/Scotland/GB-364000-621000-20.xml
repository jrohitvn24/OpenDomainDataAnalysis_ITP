		<content>  {Bonjedward}lies about a mile to the 
 north of Jedburgh,and is said to have 
 been an old{Roman}settlement.The      
 cottage in the "island" of roads is   
 now a{Craft}Centre,but until about    
 1930 it was a{Smiddy. }Iron rings can 
 still be seen in the wall,and a huge  
 driving wheel in the attic probably   
 drove a wetstone at ground level.     
  {Petrol}was sold at the cottage after
 the Smiddy closed.The road level was  
 much lower then.                      
   The{B.P.Filling Station}is run by   
 Mounthooly Farm using the shop as an  
 outlet for their fresh vegetables with
 groceries,sweets,frozen foods,cigarets
 car spares etc.In the summer 34,000   
 litres of petrol per week are sold    
 with 20,000 in the winter.            
   The busiest day for selling petrol  
 is{Friday,}and{Sunday}is the busiest  
 day for foodstuffs.                   </content>
