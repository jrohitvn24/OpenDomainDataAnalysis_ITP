		<title>07DAIRSIE SHOP AND POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The Dairsie shop is on the main road  
 between Cupar and St.Andrews. The shop
 is run by Mr.Nicol and his mother. It 
 has been here for ten years since     
 Mr.Nicols father built it. They have  
 two assistants Mrs.Ednie and Mrs.     
 Ainslie. The shope sells groceries,   
 fruit and vegetables. There is also a 
 Post Office in the shop where pensions
 and family allowances are available.  
 Mr. Nicol owns a mobile van that goes 
 all round Dairsie selling groceries   
 and cakes. Mr.Connell drives the van  
 and also serves customers. He gets    
 cakes and rolls from Ian Rodgers the  
 baker in St.Andrews. Most of the      
 people who come to the shop are       
 passers-by and elderly people. The    
 purpose of having the shop is so      
 people dont have to go far when they  
 want groceries.         Julie Nicol
