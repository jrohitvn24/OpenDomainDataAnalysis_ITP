		<title>01THE ISLE OF CANNA</title>

 The island of Canna is the most       
 westerly of the Small Isles of the    
 Inner Hebrides. It is almost 5 miles  
 long and 1 mile wide. The island of   
 Sanday, which is connected to Canna   
 by a footbridge, is nearly 2 miles    
 long and up to 0.75 miles wide. The   
 two islands are hereafter referred to 
 collectively as Canna.                
 The population of Canna is currently  
 17 people (June 1985). The majority   
 of those employed work for The        
 National Trust for Scotland who were  
 given the island in 1981 by the       
 previous owner Dr John Lorne Campbell.
 Canna has been treated as a bird      
 sanctuary since 1938. The whole island
 is farmed but is designated a Nature  
 Conservancy Site of Special Scientific
 Interest .                            </content>
