		<title>11BRONZE AGE BURIAL GROUND</title>
		<content>   A retired librarian came and took us
 on a visit to the place where the     
{coffins}of the{Bronze Age}were found. 
  The{burial ground}has been there for 
 more than{2000 years.}The{coffins}were
 found{100 years ago.                  
  As we reached the place we passed the
{Bishop's Burn}and we saw a{Baggie     
{Minnow}which is a{small fish.}We were 
 then taken across the road to the     
{special school,}where we walked along 
 and he told us in times gone by that  
 the{bark of the Silver Birch tree}was 
 used to make{parchment}for writing on.
  He pointed out the spot where the    
{Codger's well}had been.{Codgers}were  
 people who went round with a{horse    
{and cart}and went to{farms to buy hens
{and ducks.}This was because the       
{farmer's wife}couldn't go to{market}to
 sell them there.
