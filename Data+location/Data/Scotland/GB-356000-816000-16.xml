		<title>16Personalities in Alford</title>
		<content> Both our local personalities are      
 natives of the Vale of Alford.        
 William MacDonald joined his father at
 Montgarrie Mill as an apprentice      
 miller in 1930. 54 years later he     
 retired and his son,Donald,took over  
 as miller.He has held several         
 positions of influence in the Vale,   
 master of the freemasons, a trustee of
 the Murray Memorial Trust and chairman
 of the trustees of the Murray Park    
 which the poet Charles Murray gave to 
 the people of Alford.                 
 Madge Robb,SWRI member and hallkeeper,
 is a familiar figure in Alford riding 
 her bike and giving everyone a cheery 
 wave and shout.Over the years she has 
 cared for many old people and at      
 present is home-help to four. She     
 makes fine preserves and home baking, 
 and enjoys bowling and country dancing
