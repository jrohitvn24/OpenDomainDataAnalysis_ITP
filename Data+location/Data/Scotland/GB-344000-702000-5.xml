		<content>   {COLINSBURGH CHURCH}is a            
 Presbyterian Church of Scotland and   
 lies in the parish of Kilconquhar. The
 present building was built in 1840.The
 village clock is set in the steeple.  
 It is now part of a linked            
 charge,sharing its minister with      
 Kilconquhar and Elie Churches. This   
 means that services are not held every
 Sunday in Colinsburgh, although the   
 Sunday School is weekly.  The minister
 is also the school chaplain.          
   The small number of Roman Catholics 
 attend the Church of Christ the King  
 in Pittenweem, five miles away.       
   Jehovah's Witnesses,Mormons and some
 close Brethern sects often call round 
 the doors trying to encourage their   
 persuasions.
