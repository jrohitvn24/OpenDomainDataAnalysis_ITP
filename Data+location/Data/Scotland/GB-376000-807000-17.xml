		<title>17SKENE ESTATE</title>
		<content>{Skene Estate}remained in the hands of 
 the Skene family for over 500 years.  
{Skene House}was the home of the Laird 
 of Skene.When the Skene line came to  
 an end,the{Duke of Fife}inherited the 
 Estate.He gave the Estate to a member 
 of his family as a wedding present.The
{Hamilton family}ran the Estate for    
 over 100 years but the Hamilton family
 came to an end in the 1940's when the 
 only son of the Laird was killed in   
 Crete during World War II.His mother, 
 Lady Hamilton became involved with the
 Forces services after this and she was
 asked to provide accomodation for     
 members of the armed forces.She       
 converted what is now the west wing   
 into three apartments;however only one
 was ever occupied.Lady Hamilton       
 eventually closed up most of the house
 and coverted 3 appartments back into  
 one dwelling in which she lived.      </content>
