		<title>12Housing in Milnathort</title>
		<content>    Housing in Milnathort ranges from  
 18th c. cottages and family houses to 
 modern bungalows and villas. In the   
 main streets many houses are on the   
 first floor above shops.              
  {Burleigh Estate}takes its name from 
{Burleigh Castle.}It is a very modern  
 development of between 30 and 40 homes
 on the eastern edge of Milnathort.    
 Building began in 1981 and is continu-
 ing still(summer 1985). They are quite
 expensive, which may be why they were 
 slow to sell at first.                
   A group of local authority (District
 Council) houses form a street on the  
 higher land of the village. This is   
 Viewfar Road, where many of the houses
 are let to fairly young families.     
   This group contrasts sharply with   
 some of the large, private houses     
 nearby which have spacious rooms and  
 secluded gardens.                     </content>
