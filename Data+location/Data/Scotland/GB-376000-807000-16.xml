		<content> Mr Forbes,a retired mill worker was   
 born in 1901 and has spent all his    
 life in the{parish of Skene.}         
 The families were a lot bigger when Mr
 Forbes was a boy,some families had as 
 many as twelve children.There were    
 quite a few changes on the estates.   
 Lord Cowdray has owned the estate for 
 66 years and brought many{modern}     
{changes}to homes and villages.At the  
 south side of the loch,Lady Cowdray   
 had a temple built and also towers    
 which are still standing today.       
 The water from the loch of Skene was  
 used to power a{cotton mill}but this  
 was closed many years ago.Large Estate
 homes e.g.Skene house have been       
 converted into flats.                 
 It is the opinion of Mr Forbes that   
 all the changes over the years have   
 been for the better.
