		<title>12Bristows Helicopters</title>
		<content>    They are the largest operators at  
 the largest{Heliport}in the world,    
 Aberdeen. The scale of operations is  
 huge. Bristows alone operate 63       
 flights a day, about 1200 men, mostly 
 going to the oil rigs in the North    
 Sea. Even though chances of crashing  
 are infinitesimal there are quite a   
 few warning lights to warn a pilot of 
 a malfunction, 137 in all. No wonder  
 then that it takes 9000 flying hours  
 and Â£60,000 to train a man to be a    
 pilot. And as he sits in his          
 technological nest does he reflect    
 that the rotor blades above his head, 
 spinning at 500 mph,cost Â£40,000 each?
 But that is just a fraction of the    
 Â£1.5 million cost of the whole        
 helicopter. And as more oilfields are 
 discovered in the North Sea, the      
 future of the world's largest{Heliport
 looks very bright indeed.             </content>
