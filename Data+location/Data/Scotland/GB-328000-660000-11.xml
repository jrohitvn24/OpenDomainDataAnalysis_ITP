   All of the recreation clubs in      
 Carrington take place in the village  
 hall. The hall was completed in 1984  
 and was built at a cost of Â£92,000.   
   The hall is used by the citizens of 
 Carrington and the neighbouring       
 village of Temple.                    
   Many different organisations use    
 the village hall. Badminton, bridge,  
 bowling, table tennis and pool clubs  
 all meet regularly. There is a Womens 
 Rural Institute that also meets every 
 month.                                
   A playgroup is held in the hall.    
 Only 10 children attend this          
 playgroup.When these children are     
 older they will have to attend the    
 primary school in Temple.
