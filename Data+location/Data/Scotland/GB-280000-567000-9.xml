		<title>09Fund Raising Activities</title>
		<content> There are many different ways of      
 raising money in our area. Here are   
 some of them. Guess the weight of the 
 cake is designed to raise funds for   
 local charities. The idea is that you 
 feel the weight of the cake, write    
 your guess in a book, and the person  
 who is nearest to the exact weight of 
 the cake wins it. Another competition 
 is name the teddy where you pay some  
 money to guess the name which has been
 chosen by the maker; whoever guesses  
 the right name wins the teddy bear.   
 There are another 6 fund raising      
 activities in our area including guess
 the birthday of the doll and sponsored
 walks, silence and slim. Guess the    
 birthday of the doll is the same as   
 the teddy. In the others you are      
 sponsored for how many miles you walk,
 run, how long you are quiet or how    
 many pounds you lose.                 </content>
