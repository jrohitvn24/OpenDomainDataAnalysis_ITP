 There are no large,intensive farms in 
 this area.Many of the farms are small 
 holdings.The main type of farming is  
 in fact dairying with crops being     
 grown to be used on the farms not as a
 profit making concern.                
                                       
          {FORESTRY}                   
                                       
 A large proportion of our block is    
 covered with forestry.The forested    
 area is land which has been drained   
 and reclaimed from the moss.It has    
 been planted out with quick growing   
 conifers.However a few patches of     
 deciduous trees can be found.The areas
 of woodland are privately owned and   
 have no connection with the Forestry  
 Commission.                           </content>
