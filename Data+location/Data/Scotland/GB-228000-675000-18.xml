		<content> The average family  consists of four  
 to five people and they live in busy  
 towns and cities.  Most families are  
 close-knit though divorce is          
 increasing.The day starts at 7.30     
 or 8 am.  Mother is usually out of bed
 first to prepare breakfast.  Father   
 goes to work, the children go to      
 school or nursery and mother begins   
 her round of household chores -       
 washing dishes, making beds,          
 hoovering, dusting and preparing the  
 evening meal.  There are many labour  
 saving devices around the house       
 washing machine, tumble dryers, food  
 processor, dish washer etc.  These    
 leave women more free time for leisure
 activities though more women today are
 in part or full time jobs. The family 
 returns for meals,talk together and   
 relax.
