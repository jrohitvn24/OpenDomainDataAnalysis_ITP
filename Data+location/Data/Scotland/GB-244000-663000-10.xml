		<title>10Council housing in Paisley..</title>
		<content>    In Paisley there is a council {    
{waiting list}of 20,000. However,there 
 is no new council building because of 
{financial limits.}Some{sheltered}     
 housing has been built and there has  
 been renovation of old houses.        
   The most desired council housing in 
 our area is in{George St.}It takes 20 
 years to get a transfer. The least    
 sought after area is{Ferguslie Park.} 
 This is a poor area and there is much 
 vandalism.Some houses have had to be{ 
{demolished.}To help tenants an {area  
{office}has been built in Ferguslie.   
   Few tenants in our area have{bought 
{their own council houses.}Prefered    
 houses for this are semi-detached or  
 "cottage"type.There are few of these  
 in our area.                          
   Problems occur with some houses.    
 Dampness caused by{condensation}is    
 perhaps the worst.                    </content>
