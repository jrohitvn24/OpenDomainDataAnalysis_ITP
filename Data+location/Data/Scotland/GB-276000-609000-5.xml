		<title>05Housing in Sanquhar</title>
		<content> The majority of houses in Sanquhar are
 owned by Nithsdale District Council   
 and the Scottish Special Housing      
 Association, to whom the tenants pay a
 weekly rent. Nearly all the council   
 houses have been built since the war, 
 and recently some of them have been   
 extensively modernised, many more     
 houses will be improved in the future.
 Many of these houses are brick-built  
 with a pebble-dashed exterior,        
 although some still have a metal      
 coating. There are however quite a few
 privately-owned houses, and these are 
 to be found mainly in the older parts 
 of the town, and in an estate built   
 within the last 15 years. These houses
 are mainly stone-built - some being   
 detached and others terraced. The most
 recent housing development has been   
 the construction of sheltered housing 
 for the elderly citizens of Sanquhar. </content>
