		<title>20DOMESDAY GROUP BISHOPBRIGGS</title>
		<content> The information collected in the      
 Domesday Block centred on Bishopbriggs
 was a joint effort on the part of 4   
 schools in the area. Of the text      
 pages, pages 2-6 were the work of     
 Wester Cleddens Primary School, pages 
 7-11 were written by St. Matthews     
 Primary School, Meadowburn Primary    
 School wrote pages 12-15, and Turnbull
 High School were responsible for the  
 others as well as acting as the final 
 co-ordinating group for the collation 
 and onward transmission of the        
 collected data. Each school was       
 allocated 3 Grid Squares for data     
 collection which was then transcribed 
 onto the final submission in Turnbull 
 High School. Photographs A and C were 
 taken by pupils at Wester Cleddens    
 P.S. and Photos B and D were taken by 
 St. Matthews' pupils.
