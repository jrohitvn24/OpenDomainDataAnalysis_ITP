 The community centre is enjoyed by all
 the old people.In the community centre
 there is quite a selection of         
 activities including badminton, bingo,
 bowling and table-tennis.Bowling      
 seemed to be the most popular.

{PRIMARY SCHOOLS                       
 Peterculter Primary School is quite   
 large compared to Milltimber          
 School.Culter has 480 pupils and      
 Milltimber has 190.The pupils all seem
 to like their area but they would     
 mostly like to see more shops and     
 outdoor activities.The children who   
 lived in Milltimber didn't like their 
 school as much as those in            
 Peterculter.
