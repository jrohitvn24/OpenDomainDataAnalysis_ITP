		<title>02PORT OF MENTEITH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Port of Menteith church belongs to
 the Presbyterian Church of Scotland   
 and its minister is responsible for   
 the Parish.                           
  The present building was erected in  
 1878 on the site of an earlier        
 building and it is thought that this  
 has been the site of a church since   
 long before the Reformation.It is     
 situated on the eastern shore of the  
 Lake of Menteith and is a well-known  
 landmark.It is particularly attractive
 as seen from the road from Callander  
 as one comes over Cockhill and sees   
 the Lake spread out before one's      
 gaze.The old grey sandstone building  
 with its small spire seems to nestle  
 so comfortably by the curve of the    
 Lake.                                 
  There are some very old tombstones in
 the churchyard some dating from 1600.
