		<title>13The River Nith in Dumfries</title>
		<content> The{River Nith}rises in the{Doon      
{Valley}area in South-West Scotland and
 flows down past{Kirkconnel}then       
{Sanquar}then{Thornhill}and through the
 middle of{Dumfries}to flow out into   
 the{Solway Firth.}In Dumfries the Nith
 flows along the{Whitesands.}There are 
 mostly shops at the 'Sands', and since
 it floods a lot they find it difficult
 to take out an insurance policy,      
 because the insurance company would be
 paying out too much money for repairs.
 There is a road and a parking space,  
 (including a space for a bus company),
 between the Nith and the shops. There 
 are four bridges across the Nith. The 
 first is called the{Buccleuch St      
{Bridge,}the second is the{Devorgilla  
{Bridge,}the third is the{Suspension   
{Bridge}and the last is St.Michael's   
{Bridge.}The only traffic bridges are  
 the first and fourth.                 </content>
