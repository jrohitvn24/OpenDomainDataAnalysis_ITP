		<content> CASTLE.One of the main castles on the 
 Borders,it was a favourite residence  
 of many Scottish kings .At times it   
 fell into the hands of the English.   
 When a new jail was needed in 1820 it 
 was built on the site of the old      
 castle and was in use for 60 years.It 
 is now open as a museum.              
 ABBEY.Jedburgh's show piece,founded   
 in 1138 by King David,was built by    
 Augustinian Canons from France. They  
 became an important order in Scotland.
 It suffered much damage from English  
 invaders and was finally abandoned in 
 1545.The Abbey church was patched up  
 by the townspeople and used as the    
 Parish Church until about 100 years   
 ago.Archaeologists in the past year   
 have been uncovering more remains.    
 Excavations are also being made on    
 the site,near to the High Street,of a 
 16th cen.Franciscan Friary.           </content>
