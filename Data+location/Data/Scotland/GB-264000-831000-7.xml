  The osprey nests in pine forests near
 water.The female lays 2 eggs heavily  
 marked with a reddish brown. The male 
 and female both sit on the eggs for   
 4\ weeks. After six weeks of being fed
 by both the male and the female the   
 chicks leave the nest. They feed on   
 fish up to 14 pounds of weight from   
 our lochs. {

 to nest on  quarry faces.It lays 4-6  
 white eggs which are sat on by the
