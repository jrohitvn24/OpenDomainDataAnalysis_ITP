		<title>12Coast - Lobster Fishing</title>
		<content> On the shore in both East Wemyss and  
 Buckhaven there are a number of small 
 boats on the beach. The locals use    
 these for lobster fishing during the  
 summer. The traps used to catch       
 shellfish vary considerably in shape  
 and size. The traps or 'creels' as the
 Scottish ones are called may have     
 wooden, metal or plastic bases with a 
 netting cover. Creels are weighted to 
 keep them on the sea bed and baited to
 attract the lobsters and crabs which  
 enter through the 'eyes' in the       
 netting. The eyes are funnel shaped   
 sections leading into the centre of   
 the creel. The funnel shae makes it   
 impossible for the lobsters and crabs 
 to retreat once they are in the creel.
 Creels may be fished singly or in a   
 series of up to 60. Here they are     
 normally fished singly or in a short  
 series as their boats are small.      </content>
