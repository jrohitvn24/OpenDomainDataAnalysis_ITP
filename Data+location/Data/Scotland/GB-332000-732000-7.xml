		<title>07THE VILLAGE OF LIFF</title>
		<content> This village has changed dramatically 
 over the past 20 years. Instead of the
 old farmsteads which used to occupy   
 the area there are now modern houses  
 which are occupied by commuters who   
 travel to Dundee.                     
      The School,which was built in    
 1860,lies about half a mile from the  
 main housing area.                    
      The most dominant building in the
 area however is the Hospital which    
 used to be named Westgreen. This      
 Hospital caters for the mentally      
 infirm and people who have suffered   
 from nervous complaints.              
        In the village itself there is 
 a most impresive Church,which was     
 built in 1839.There is an equally     
 impressive Manse which requires some  
 structural attention.
