		<title>13HOUSING West Forres</title>
		<content> In recent years some housing          
 development has taken place.At        
 Mannachie and Red Craig small private 
 housing estates have been built.At Red
 Craig the connecting road is part of  
 the old Forres Airfield runway and it 
 has badly deteriorated over the       
 years.Residents have repeatedly asked 
 the council to repair this road but   
 with little success.A very small part 
 of the Thornhill Estate encroaches on 
 this area.Mostly semi-detached and    
 terraced houses,planning permission   
 has been obtained to extend this      
 estate in the near future.Other       
 housing is mainly scattered and much  
 of it is the property of Darnaway or  
 Altyre Estates.No longer needed for   
 workers these are mainly let to young 
 couples awaiting housing in Forres or 
 RAF personnel.The renovation of old   
 cottages has become very popular.     </content>
