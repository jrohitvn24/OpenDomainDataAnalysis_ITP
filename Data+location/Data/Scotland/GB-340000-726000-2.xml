		<content> The Scanner Bonanza was held in the   
 Blyth Hall in Newport on Saturday,    
 8th. June.It was held in aid of the   
 C.A.T. Scan Appeal.(C.A.T. stands for 
 Computer Assisted Tomography.)        
   The money raised, which was Â£3224,  
 will go towards getting a C.A.T. scan 
 machine for Tayside. The machine is   
 mainly used for looking for cancer in 
 the early stages, so that it can be   
 treated.                              
   The Coffee Morning lasted for two   
 hours and some of the stalls were;    
 tombola, raffle, treasure hunt and    
 buzz, cake and candy, the Forgan Arts 
 Centre Plant Stall and the pancake    
 stall. As well as that, upstairs,     
 there was a coffee room which had a   
 large queue. There was also a drawing 
 and painting competition for the      
 children; the theme was cats.
