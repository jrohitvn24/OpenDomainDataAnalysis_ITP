		<title>10Lunardi's 1st Balloon Flight</title>
		<content>  A plaque is to be erected in October,
 near the spot on which Vincent Lunardi
 landed, to commemorate the bicentenary
 of his first Scottish flight.  It will
 be    unveiled    by    the    Italian
 Consul-General in  Scotland,  Dr Carlo
 Marsili.                              
   Lunardi   was   an   Italian,   vain
 and adored by women.   He  always wore
 flamboyant clothes.                   
  On 5th October, 1785 he rose from the
 grounds   of   Heriot's   Hospital  in
 Edinburgh in his hydrogen balloon  and
 drifted  towards  Ceres  and  when  he
 arrived the workers below thought that
 something was falling from heaven!    
  The field in which he landed  is near
 Coaltown  of Callange  which  nowadays
 consists of only two renovated country
 cottages.
