 In Coatbridge there are three railway 
 stations.{Coatbridge Central,Blairhill
{station}and{Sunnyside station.        
 Coatbridge Central is now unstaffed   
 but it is still used.You can get your 
 ticket from the travel agent and get  
 on the train at the staion and hand   
 in your ticket at the other end.Me and
 my pals look after it and clean it up.
 Blairhill station is part of          
{Strathclyde Transport.}Trains stop at 
 it.It is painted bright orange.       
 Sunnyside station is{British Rail.}It 
 is quite an old station and a well    
 looked after one.It is a dull grey    
 paint.All the stations in Coatbridge  
 are looked after well except          
 Coatbridge Central which is allways   
 getting vandlised. The vandals smash  
 windows and spray them with spray     
 paint.                                </content>
