		<title>19Evaluation of Gordon</title>
		<content> There are four shops. The customers   
 think they are handy for the older    
 people and quite cheap. The shops     
 appear to be the right size for the   
 villagers. The most used shop is the  
 Post Office which sells everything.   
 Most customers find it convenient to  
 go to larger shops in town to get a   
 bigger selection. The most common     
 complaint of the housing in Gordon is 
 the lack of insulation. People can    
 hear their neighbours conversations.  
 The heating is found to be inefficient
 in the winter and expensive. Gardens  
 are found to be too small and not     
 private enough.There are not enough   
 leisure facilities in Gordon to suit  
 both old and young. Many people work  
 outside the village.If factories were 
 built in Gordon they would spoil the  
 community atmosphere. Most adults like
 the village as it is.                 </content>
