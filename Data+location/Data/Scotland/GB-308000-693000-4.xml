		<content> In many ways the plantation of the    
 trees has brought more wildlife to the
 forest. This area is thriving with    
 small birds, birds of prey, rabbits,  
 foxes and many other small mammals.   
 The birds of prey are Kestrels, Barn  
 owls, Little owls, Sparrow Hawks,and  
 Buzzards who prey mostly on small     
 mammals such as voles, mice, and young
 rabbits.There are lots of different   
 small birds e.g. sparrows,            
 chaffinch,and tits who mostly feed on 
 berries.                              
 Roe Deer are most common and each year
 their numbers have to be checked by   
 shooting. Their numbers tend to       
 increase when the trees are cut down.
