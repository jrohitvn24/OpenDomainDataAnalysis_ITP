		<title>16Dalkeith Palace</title>
		<content> Dalkeith Palace was built in 1705. In 
 these days it was used for the Dukes  
 house. When it was built the Duke of  
 Buccleuch gave it to Anne the Duchess.
 The Duke had intended it for her use. 
 The house was very expensive but the  
 Duke being nobility could afford these
 luxuries. The building is now part of 
 local history and British history.    
                                       
 The Duke who is a rich man is the     
 largest landowner next to the Queen.  
 Nowadays the Duke does not use the    
 property. It is available for         
 commercial use. At the moment it is   
 lying vacant, its most recent         
 occupants, a computer company having  
 moved out. It is not open to the      
 public, but the Duke hopes to let it  
 to another company or to subdivide it 
 for flats in the near future.
