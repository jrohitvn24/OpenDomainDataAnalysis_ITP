 Many people use their spare time in   
 the spring and summer working at      
 peats. Peat is found on the moors. It 
 is very rich, fertile earth, which was
 originally forest. This rotted over   
 the centuries and eventually turned   
 into peaty earth. Peat is cut with a  
 tool called a peat-iron.              
 Some people go sailing. There are     
 small interesting islands nearby. Some
 of them are sanctuaries for seals and 
 birds.                                
 Fresh-water fishing is also an        
 interesting hobby. There are many     
 lochs and rivers in Waternish.
