 Church of Scotland and the third to   
 the Roman Catholic Church.All are well
 attended each Sunday and have many    
 associated clubs.                     
                                       
 If you came to West Kilbride some     
{suitable sites for you to visit}would 
 be Law Castle or the Glen ( where     
 there are tennis courts,a putting     
 green,a running track and a football  
 field.) Another feature you might     
 like to see would be the school as it 
 is new. You could have a pleasurable  
 walk up Tarbet Hill or along the      
 beach. In the summer months you would 
 enjoy{local events}like _ Gala Day,the
 Boys' Brigade Fete and the West       
 Kilbride Flower Show _ the biggest and
 best in the area.                     </content>
