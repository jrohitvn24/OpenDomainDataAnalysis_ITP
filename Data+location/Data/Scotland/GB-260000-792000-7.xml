		<title>07History around Laggan</title>
		<content> A most important event takes place in 
 Laggan this year(1985). Our kirk      
 celebrates it's 200th anniversary     
 although now the only church, there   
 were this century 2 other             
 congregations in the village. The Free
 church of Scotland remains only as a  
 steeple,while the Roman Catholic      
 Church was demolished and taken to    
 Elgin.The manse of the old Free Kirk  
 is now a hotel.The present schoolhouse
 was the registrars house and office   
 until 1930. Older residents have been 
 heard to call this "the poor office". 
 At Balgowan(east of block) there are 2
 houses which were the local           
 poor house. Just beyond our western   
 border are the remains of 2 important 
 settlements. On Dun da Lamb are       
 remains of an iron-age Pictish fort.  
 Across the Spey can be seen the ruins 
 of the clarance village of Crathie.   </content>
