		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF STEWARTON</title>
		<content> STEWARTON and the surrounding farm    
 lands lie mainly in the valley of the 
 Annick Water and its tributaries in   
 the rolling uplands of the NE area of 
 Ayr Division in Strathclyde,22 kms    
 from Glasgow.It is mainly a dormitory 
 town of around 9000 inhabitants who   
 travel to nearby work centres.Nearly  
 all the farms in the area are dairy.  
 From many viewpoints,on a clear day,  
 the island of Arran and the Firth of  
 Clyde,the Kilbirnie Hills,the Carrick 
 Hills and Heads of Ayr,may be seen.The
 area was well known for its butter and
 cheese,and the town for its knitwear. 
 The farms have belonged to the same   
 families for many years while the town
 has grown in the last 30 years and now
 has many people from Glasgow and      
 further afield.
