		<title>03Local History - Buckhaven</title>
		<content> Buckhaven, like many villages on the  
 Fife coast, originated as a fishing   
 village. Buckhaven means stormy       
 sounding harbour and long before any  
 man-made harbour was built the rocky  
 inlets offshore made Buckhaven a      
 natural haven. Like so many fishing   
 villages Buckhaven grew up without any
 planning of the buildings, the        
 fishermen built their houses huddled  
 as near as possible to the sea. The   
 red pantiled roofs, external stairs,  
 crow stepped gables and whitewashed   
 walls gave the village a quaint       
 typically East Neuk of Fife           
 appearance.In the 1900s coalmining    
 brought increased prosperity but it   
 also destroyed the fishing. The coal  
 deposits destroyed the golden sands   
 and silted up the harbour which until 
 100 years ago supported over 400      
 fishermen and more than 100 boats.    </content>
