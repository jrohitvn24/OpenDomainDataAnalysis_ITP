		<title>07Electricity for Rhenigidale</title>
		<content> In 1980 the North of Scotland         
 Hydro_Electric Board with aid from the
 EEC provided the village of           
 Rhenigidale with mains electricity.   
 Previously the villagers had used     
 calor gas,tilley lamps and diesel     
 generators for light, heat and        
 cooking. Two of the houses had these  
 generators but they were only used in 
 the evening thus providing, for a     
 short time power points for television
 lights etc. The mains power line came 
 overland from Maaruig(four miles north
 of the village). Over 100 poles were  
 erected and they and the cables were  
 flown from Maaruig to their sites by  
 helicopter. All the inhabited houses  
 have electricity and deep freezes,    
 fridges etc.are commonplace. Powercuts
 do happen but that inconvenience is   
 compensated for by the 'touch of a    
 switch' power now available.          </content>
