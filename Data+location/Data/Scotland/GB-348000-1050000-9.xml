		<title>09Health care on Papa Westray</title>
		<content> Health care is practised by a resident
 Health Visitor. A doctor from Westray 
 is on call and travels across by small
 boat weather permitting, the doctor   
 holds a surgery once a week. A Flying 
 Ambulance is used should the situation
 merit a visit to the main hospital in 
 Kirkwall or direct to Aberdeen.       
      Annual or Biannual visits are    
 made by the dentist who uses the      
 doctors surgery and the school dentist
 who brings his own mobile clinic, the 
 optician and the chiropodist.         
      The physiotherapist visits the   
 island as required as does the speech 
 therapist.                            
      Home help service is supplied to 
 extend  care of the elderly within    
 the community.
