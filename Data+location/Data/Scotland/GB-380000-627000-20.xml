		<content> My wife an I own a grocers shop and I 
 operate a milk run four days a week.  
 Monday a single delivery, Tuesday,    
 Thursday and Saturday double          
 deliveries. I have an assistant, a    
 "Saturday Girl", Tracy, who helps with
 the milk run. The milk arrives from   
 Kelso at 5am, and my day begins when I
 get up at 5.30am. After breakfast I   
 start the milk run, which is in two   
 parts, Yetholm, and the country. The  
 town part takes about 1\ hours, so    
 after that I have a break. The country
 part includes farms, Morebattle, and  
 as far as Hownam and takes another 1\ 
 hours. When the whole run is finished,
 a distance of 35 miles, and all the   
 empty crates are tidied, the shop part
 of the day starts. The shop is open 8 
 'till 6 except Sunday. When in the    
 shop,we stock up, clean, reorder, do  
 the accounts and sell.                </content>
