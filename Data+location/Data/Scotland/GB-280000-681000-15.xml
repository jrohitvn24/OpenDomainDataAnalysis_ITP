		<title>15Housing-Denny and Dunipace</title>
		<content> Over the last few years Dunipace and  
 Denny have become more densely        
 populated and, in an effort to solve  
 the{problem of housing}in the area,   
 the local council became the first    
 authority to experiment in the        
 conversion of old property. In the    
 late 60's and early 70's District     
 councillors agreed to supply council  
 homes for{overspill tennants}of       
 Glasgow Corporation. Houses had to be 
 built quickly. Flats, semi-detached   
 and terraced type houses appeared. By 
 the end of the 70's, however, people  
 began to realise that renting their   
 homes was expensive. The idea of{home 
{ownership}became more appealing.      
 Building began again - more and more  
 private homes appeared and were       
 quickly bought up.{The population}now 
 stands at 13,000 and is still growing 
 and house building still increasing.  </content>
