 The hotel is isolately situated 4     
 miles from Alford near pretty Muir of 
 Fowlis. The building was first erected
 as a farmhouse. From the 1800's the   
 building was used as a watering hole  
 for travellers and their horses. The  
 name 'Muggarthaugh' has two possible  
 origins. 'Mugwart' (from the Gaelic   
 word 'Mugach' meaning damp, cloudy and
 misty) was a plant which possibly grew
 near the site. Also, tinkers, who may 
 have camped there, made bowls and mugs
 and were called 'muggers'. Haugh is a 
 hill. A night's stay including        
 breakfast cost approximately Â£16.     
 Family barbecues and ceilidhs         
 (traditional songs and dances)are held
 during summer.The function room can   
 cater for 150-200 people and is used  
 for weddings, christening parties,    
 funeral teas and bustrip teas.        </content>
