		<content>   Carsphairn village was one of the   
 first villages in the Stewartry to    
 have a schoolmaster. He was appointed 
 in 1723.At one time there were more   
 than 60 pupils in the school, but now 
 there are only 11.                    
   Most of the pupils live outside the 
 village, and some of them travel more 
 than 10 miles to get to school.The    
 pupils' ages range from 5 years to 11 
 years.                                
   The school has one classroom, and   
 one teacher, to teach all ages and all
 subjects. There is a dining           
 room/kitchen where the meals are      
 prepared for the pupils by the cook.  
   Outside is a large play area, part  
 of which is tarred, and part covered  
 with grass. On the grass an adventure 
 playground has been built,sponsored by
 the Community Council,started in      
 1982, and completed in 1983.          </content>
