		<title>06Mayne Farm.</title>
		<content>  Mayne Farm has about 1500 to 1600    
 acres of land. There are 9 workers on 
 the farm.                             
  The owner of the farm, Mr Anderson,  
 inherited the farm from his father.   
 The farm has 2 holstein bulls and 270 
 grey face cows. Each cow produces     
 about 6 gallons of milk per day.      
 Normally a cow has one calf each year 
 which is taken after the first week   
 but the cow continues giving milk for 
 the next 300 days. Two months before  
 the cow has another calf it dries up. 
 The farm also has a lot of sheep and  
 three collie sheep dogs.              
  They own 12 tractors and 1 combine   
 harvester. The ground is medium sandy 
 and it is good for growing crops.     
 Mayne Farm is a very nice farm to     
 visit and sometimes we go for         
 barbeques with the Guides.
