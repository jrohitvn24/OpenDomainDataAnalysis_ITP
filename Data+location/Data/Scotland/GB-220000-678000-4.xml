 our block. On the{Shore Rd.}most of   
 the houses are large owner occupied   
 villas which are surrounded by gardens
 On either side of SchoolRd.are housing
 developments.Fairfield Gardens was    
 built to house people who had lost    
 their homes when{Hillhead Cottages}was
 destroyed in a fire in 1947.On the    
 right hand side of{School}Rd.is{Meikle
{Aiden Brae}these houses are privately 
 owned and many  of the people who     
 live here work at{R.N.A.D. Coulport   
 The school is just across the road    
 from Meikle Aiden and the{Playgroup   
 meet in the old school next door.     
 As you can see there is great variety 
 in the types of housing in our block  
 and this is because it has been built 
 over a period of a hundred and fifty  
 years as the need arose.
