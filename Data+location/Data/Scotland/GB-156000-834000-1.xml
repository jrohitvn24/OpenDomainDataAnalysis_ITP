		<content> THIS AREA OF RAASAY IS MAINLY MOORLAND
 WITH BIRCH AND ALDER WOODS ALONG THE  
 WEST COAST AND AN AREA OF FORESTRY    
 PLANTATION TO THE EAST OF THE BLOCK.  
 THE HILLS AND MOORLAND AREA IS USED BY
   THE SOUTH ISLAND SHEEP-HOLDING CLUB 
 WHOSE MEMBERS GRAZE THEIR SHEEP ON IT.
 ABOUT A MILE FROM THE VILLAGE THERE IS
 A SHEEP FANK WHERE THE CLUB MEMBERS   
 DIP AND SHEAR THE SHEEP.              
   AT THE TOP OF THE GLEN ROAD THERE   
 ARE SOME DERELECT BUILDINGS. THESE    
 WERE PART OF AN IRON ORE MINE WHICH IS
 NO LONGER IN USE AND HAVE BEEN MARKED 
 AS DANGEROUS BUILDINGS.               
   THIS AREA OF RAASAY HAS ONLY ONE    
 FAMILY IN PERMENANT RESIDENCE. ALONG  
 THE EAST COAST THERE ARE FOUR HOUSES  
 ALL BELONGING TO FAMILIES WHO ONLY USE
 THEM AS HOLIDAY HOMES. THERE ARE STILL
 SOME RUINS OF THE CROFTING COMMUNITY  
 THAT LIVED THERE.                     </content>
