		<content> Midcoul farm is one and a half miles  
 away from Croy.It is owned by Moray   
 Estates and it has been tenanted by Mr
 Rose since 1906. Midcoul was built in 
 the 1840s and is 300 acres.The        
 livestock consists mainly of 1100     
 pigs. A few years ago Midcoul had some
 cows but no more have come.The        
 builders that work on the farm are Mr 
 Andrews from Lochandinty and Dave     
 Macullach who lives near Petty West   
 School.There are lots of old buildings
 on the farm which are not used        
 anymore.Near Midcoul there is another 
 farm it is called Culblair Farm,it    
 also has pigs on it but mostly it     
 stores all the machinery.
