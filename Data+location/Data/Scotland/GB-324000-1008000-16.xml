		<title>16OUTDOOR SPORTS</title>
		<content> Although Stromness is quite small it  
 has plenty of leisure facilities for  
 most interests and ages. Messing about
 in boats and sailing are summer       
 activities provided by the sea. A     
 thrivivg Sailing Club has Regattas    
 down Scapa Flow.Pony trekking at      
 Garson farm is another outdoor sport  
 for all ages. Mr. Flett looks after   
 the 18 hole golf course built about 50
 years ago at Ness. It has 100 members 
 who regularly play. Many tourists play
 and enjoy easy access to the course.  
 There's no age limit. It costs Â£16 for
 under 16s and Â£50 for adults. Next    
 door is the local bowling green with  
 an active membership. The tennis      
 courts next to it are usually in much 
 use about Wimbledon time. All the     
 outdoor activities are very much at   
 the mercy of our changeable climate.
