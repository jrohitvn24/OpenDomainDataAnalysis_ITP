		<content>    If you took a walk round Stracathro
 you would see golden barley fields,   
 yellow oil-seed rape fields and green 
 grassy parks with contented fat cattle
 chewing the cud. You would see bulls  
 too, Charolais, Simmental and Limousin
 and shaggy Highland cattle. Colins dad
 has spotted, brown Jacob sheep, with  
 their strange, sharp horns.           
                                       
    If you were lucky you might see    
 squirrels gathering nuts or sleek     
 roe-deer passing in the woods. If you 
 were very lucky, you might see mink or
 even otters and kingfishers by the    
 waters edge.                          
                                       
    There are lots of heron about,     
 especially at Mr Jemmets house near   
 the village.
