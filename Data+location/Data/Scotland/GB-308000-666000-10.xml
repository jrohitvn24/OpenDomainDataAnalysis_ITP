		<title>10Almondell Country Park,E.Cdr</title>
		<content>  Almondell Country Park was opened    
 in 1967 and is run by the West Lothian
 Council for Rangers. Before the park  
 was built the Earl of Buchan owned the
 estate.                               
  The park has 3 rangers and needs     
 another 2 if it is a good summer.This 
 year has not been such a good summer  
 but there has still been a lot of     
 visitors down Almondell Country Park. 
 They fish,walk dogs,play football,    
 swim and barbecue which is the most   
 popular activity down  Almondell.     
  There are four bridges in Almondell- 
 one is used as a canal feeder,another 
 is an unused railway bridge which     
 carried shale trains.To the west of   
 the park are the Sewage Works.Checks  
 are made in the River Almond for      
 pollution. There is clean water coming
 through into the river from the       
 sewage outfalls.  Carol-Anne and Helen</content>
