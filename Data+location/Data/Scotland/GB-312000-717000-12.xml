		<title>12 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF TARA</title>
		<content> Work continues till 12.25pm when we   
 have lunch.This is usually a meat dish
 with vegetables such as salad,        
 potatoes, carrots or peas, followed by
 a pudding of jelly or sponge cake or  
 ice cream. At 1.10pm lessons resume   
 until 2.35pm when we have a 10 minute 
 break,then we have lessons till 4.00pm
 when the day girls go home.           
   My mother then collects me from     
 school.When I arrive home I usually   
 have a small snack of biscuits and a  
 drink then I go outside for a cycle   
 run or watch television until 6pm when
 I do my study.Then at 7pm I have my   
 supper which is usually a fish or meat
 dish with vegetables such as potatoes,
 salad or cabbage.Then I go and play   
 with my hamster,read or watch         
 television till 9pm when I have a bath
 and go to bed.
