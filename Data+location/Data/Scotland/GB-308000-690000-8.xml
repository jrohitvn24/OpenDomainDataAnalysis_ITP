  Mr. John Stronach lives in the small 
 hamlet of Bowershall, which lies two  
 miles north of Dunfermline.He is the  
 fifth generation of the Stronach      
 family to work as a blacksmith.       
  He has seen many changes in his trade
 in the last thirty years.Formerly he  
 shod the horses such as Clydesdales   
 which worked on the surrounding farms.
 Today these have been replaced by     
 machinery and most of his trade is    
 concerned with horses used for        
 leisure.                              
  He uses mainly ready made shoes of   
 mild steel which are shod cold.This   
 enables him to travel throughout Fife 
 to carry out his trade.               
  He buys his shoes from a steel       
 whole-saler in Perth.                 </content>
