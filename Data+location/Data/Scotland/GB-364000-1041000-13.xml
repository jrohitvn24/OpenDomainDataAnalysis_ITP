		<title>13SHOPPING IN BURNESS</title>
		<content> Because there no shops in Burness now,
 people do their shopping from the{    
{shopping van}which is based at{       
{Kettletoft Stores.}Fiona Slater drives
 the van. In Burness she goes to{18    
{houses.}She takes the van more often  
 to people further away from the shops 
 (twice a week). People find the van   
 handy because they can get most of    
 their messages from it. It sells{     
{groceries,}like tinned food, packet   
 food &amp; dairy products;{sweets &amp;       
{crisps; fresh fruit &amp; vegetables}     
 (which are particularly fresh on a    
 Wednesday after the boat comes in); &amp; 
{fresh meat}orders are delivered  on   
 Thursdays. Driving the van to Fiona is
 really good fun. She gets on well with
 the people who come to the van. People
 speak about the weather &amp; pass on all 
 the local gossip.
