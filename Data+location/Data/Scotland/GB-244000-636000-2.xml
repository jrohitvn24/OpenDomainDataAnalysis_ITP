		<title>02NATURE IN CROOKEDHOLM</title>
		<content> Crookedholm has been a countryside    
 village for years. The dam on the     
 nearby river has caused many problems 
 in the last few years by killing man  
 and nature because of its depth. We   
 have tackled this problem by blowing  
 up the dam and letting the River      
 Irvine flow freely to the sea. There  
 have been no deaths since. Beside it  
 there are rabbits, hares and lots of  
 birds. The River Irvine is in the     
 shape of a horse-shoe and that is why 
 Crookedholm got its name, the crooked 
 bend. The dam and the countryside     
 round about the area give many things 
 to do. There's swimming, fishing,     
 ferreting, coarsing and shooting.     
 Crookedholm used to be an old Saxon   
 village.
