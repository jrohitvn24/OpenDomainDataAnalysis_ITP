		<content> Ecclefechan is a small village with a 
 population of approximately 590.One of
 the most noteworthy points of the     
 village is it is the birthplace of    
 Thomas Carlyle.Thomas Carlyle,        
 historian, essayist and social        
 reformer, was born on 4th December    
 1795 in an arched house on the village
 mainstreet.It is significant that at  
 his death in 1881 Carlyles instuctions
 were to refuse a place with the       
 nations great in Westminister Abbey.  
 Instead he was buried, with his       
 parents, in Hoddom Churchyard, a few  
 hundred yards from his birthplace.    
 Doctor A Arnott,Napoleons surgeon and 
 Robert Peel the grandfather of Sir    
 Robert Peel are also to be found in   
 this cemetery.Robert Burns is also    
 known to have stayed in the village   
 and wrote the poem ,The Lass of       
 Ecclefechan.                          </content>
