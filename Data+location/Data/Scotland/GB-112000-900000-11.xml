		<title>11EDUCATION IN TARBERT,HARRIS</title>
		<content> Sir E Scott School in Tarbert consists
 of a primary department(age 5-12)and a
 secondary department(age 12-16).There 
 are 74 pupils in the primary dept.and 
 134 pupils in the secondary dept.The  
 secondary school is the only 4 year   
 secondary school in Harris.Pupils     
 study to"O"Grade level.If they wish to
 remain at school after 16 they must go
 to Stornoway.They go to school on a   
 Monday morning and board in town until
 Friday when they return home to       
 Harris.                               
 Because so many pupils travel a       
 distance to school(up to 26miles each 
 way,daily)the school day begins at    
 9.30am.After school activities are    
 limited and many have to take place in
 school time,eg.football matches.The   
 only provision for pre-school children
 in Tarbert is a local playgroup.
