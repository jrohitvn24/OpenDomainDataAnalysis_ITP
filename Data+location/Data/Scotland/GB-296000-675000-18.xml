		<content>   Appleyards Garage is one of the two 
 main garages in Linlithgow the other  
 being Jet Garage.Both are situated at 
 the West End of Linlithgow near each  
 other on opposite sides of the road on
 the main road to Falkirk.             
   When we interviewed  Mr Johnston at 
 Appleyards Garage he told us that 60% 
 of vehicles that use the garage are   
 private cars.He said that the busiest 
 time of the day in his garage is      
 between 9.00am and 11.00am.           
   Before the garage was modernised the
 pumps were worked by the mechanics but
 now the six pumps are self service.   
   Appleyards Garage has a showroom and
 they have made a lot of money.We were 
 lucky enough to get a run back to     
 school in a new Austin Montego.It was 
 computerised and the speed guage went 
 up in digital numbers.The ride was    
 great!                                </content>
