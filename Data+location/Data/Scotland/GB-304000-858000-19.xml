		<content>{THE WITCHES' STONE                    
  The witches' stone is almost a metre 
 and slightly more than a metre in     
 diameter.  It is situated in the      
 eastern half of Forres just outside   
 the Police Station and beside the A96.
  In the old days so-called witches    
 were rolled down {Cluny Hill}in       
 barrels.  The stone marks the place   
 where one of those barrels stopped    
 rolling.  After the witch had been    
 rolled down the hill she was then     
 burnt at the stake.  Orginally there  
 were 3 stones but two have disappeared
 without trace.  This particular stone 
 is supposed to have been split in 3   
 and used as building material in a    
 nearby house.  However when the       
 occupants of the house fell ill with  
 fever the house was said to be        
 bewitched and was demolished.The stone
 was clasped together &amp; returned.      </content>
