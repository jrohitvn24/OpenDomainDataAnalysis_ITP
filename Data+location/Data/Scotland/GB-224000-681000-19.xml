		<content> ROSNEATH: The only public transport   
 is infrequent bus service to Gareloch-
 head for Helensburgh where trains can 
 be caught for destinations up river   
 and finally Glasgow, the nearest city.
 Trains at Garelochhead are taken for  
 Oban and Mallaig. Most common form of 
 transport is private car which many   
 people own as essential means of      
 travel to work, social and shopping   
 trips to supermarkets. Teenagers com- 
 plain of no buses after 7.30p.m. and  
 are unable to reach places of         
 entertainment elsewhere. Unless       
 parents willing to transport secondary
 school children from Hermitage Academy
 Helensburgh, they are denied partici- 
 pation in extra-curricular activities.
 RHU: Hourly bus service to and from   
 Helensburgh.
