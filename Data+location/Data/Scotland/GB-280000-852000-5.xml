  {Gollanfield house }is over 100 years
 old.The estate was split up we own the
 house.We have lived there for about   
 three years.The first time I went     
 inside I got lost because it is so    
 big.At the moment we are spraying the 
 buildings.                            
  In the grounds there are             
 many trees including a few pines.There
 is a scrambling track at the bottom of
 the eight acre garden.There are a{    
{Games hall,tennis court,swimming pool,
{porta cabin,lodge }and a{flat}.       
 The swimming pool has been emptied    
 and filled about twice.We have got    
 three dogs; the third one is at my    
 dad's garage.
