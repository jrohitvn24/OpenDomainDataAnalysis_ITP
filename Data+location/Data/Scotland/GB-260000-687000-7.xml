		<title>07Arts and Crafts in FINTRY</title>
		<content> There has for a number of years been a
 thriving art club in the village. It  
 used to be centred on an evening class
 at the school, but when this stopped  
 during education cut-backs, the class 
 continued in the home of one of the   
 class members.{There is an annual     
{"hanging party" in the village hall.  
                                       
 Looking for a hobby on retiring, being
 used to model making and playing the  
 fiddle during his youth, a Fintronian 
 has now taken up{violin making}in a   
 big way. His instruments are of{such  
{good qualtiy that they have been the  
{subject of tv and radio programmes.   
                                       
 The idea for the hobby came from a    
 friend. He{makes most of the special  
{tools himself}and usually produces    
 three instruments per year. Currently 
 he is trying his hand at a viola.     </content>
