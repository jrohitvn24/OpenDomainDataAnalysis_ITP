		<title>20PONDS AND LOCHS OF CROY</title>
		<content> In Croy there are about four ponds and
 one Loch.Kilravock pond is used by    
 nearly  every one for boating.It was  
 dug out in case there was a fire.In   
 the middle it is about five feet deep 
 and that is the deepest part of it.   
 The pond has never been used in a     
 fire.It is said that deep in the      
 depths of Loch Flemington sits a      
 deserted castle and that the island   
 the castle stood on sunk.Swans,duck   
 and other water creatures inhabit the 
 Loch.Loch Flemington is one and a half
 miles from Croy.It is used for        
 boating,swimming and fishing.In the   
 winter when the loch freezes up it is 
 used for curling.
