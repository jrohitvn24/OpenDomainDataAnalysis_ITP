		<title>13IN THE NEWS ON WHALSAY</title>
		<content>  People on Whalsay have been talking  
 about a number of things that concern 
 them.One of them is the school.The    
 present one is far too small,there are
 not enough rooms for all the pupils.  
 There have been temporary buildings   
 outside the school for 15 years.The   
 school is an old building,it was built
 as the Laird's Hall,and cannot just be
 altered in just any way.It might be   
 that a complete new school may be     
 built instead.It is hoped to include a
 sports centre and swimming pool in the
 extension or new school.              
  Also cause for concern is the fact   
 that old people in need of care at    
 present have to go to Lerwick.They    
 would much prefer to stay on Whalsay  
 and people have been speaking about   
 getting an old folks home built on the
 isle.There has already been an offer  
 of land at Marrister.                 </content>
