		<title>11The Harbour, Fraserburgh</title>
		<content>  {Fraserburgh Harbour}is divided into 
 eight basins and harbours. The        
 entrance to the harbour faces         
 south-east into Fraserburgh Bay and   
 leads into the{Outer Harbour}beside   
 the northern breakwater. Some of the  
 remaining basins have names;{Winter   
{Dock, Balaclava Harbour, North        
{Harbour,}and{Faithlie Harbour.        
   The port has a large number of      
 locally owned and registered{fishing  
{vessels}and these are supported by a  
{slipway, fishmarket, ice plant, boat- 
{builders yards, engineering workshops 
 and{fish processing factories.        
   In addition to fishing activities in
 the harbour there is also a reasonable
 amount of{commercial shipping traffic 
 trading to the continent and further  
 afield. The port also occasionally    
 sees a small amount of{oil-related    
{traffic.                              </content>
