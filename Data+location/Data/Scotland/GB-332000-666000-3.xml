		<content> The Scottish Examination Board (SEB)  
 has been based in Dalkeith since 1975 
 being moved there because of the need 
 for larger premises brought about by  
 the increased number of candidates    
 sitting examinations after the leaving
 age was raised to 16 in 1971. The SEB 
 was set up originally by the          
 Government in 1963 to run external    
 examinations for Scottish children, up
 to the age of 18, attending day-time  
 schools.                              
                                       
 In 1984 145,839 candidates sat between
 them 644,421 exams at Ordinary Grade, 
 Higher Grade and in 6th Year Studies. 
 The SEB employed approximately 4,000  
 teachers to mark these.
