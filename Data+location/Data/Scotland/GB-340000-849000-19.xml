		<title>19 Traditional Music in Keith</title>
		<content>An Accordion and Fiddle Club is held in
the Royal Hotel on a Tuesday night each
month.The aim of the Club is to foster 
interest in traditional Scottish music 
played on the fiddle and accordion.    
Young players are encouraged to take   
part and many have gone on to become   
Scottish Champions on their instrument.
Well known Scottish musicians make     
guest appearances at the Club and in   
summer,many tourists come to listen to 
the music of Scotland.                 
 A Folk Club is also held on a monthly 
basis in the Plough Inn.At this Club,  
there is more emphasis on folk singing 
although traditional music is also     
featured.Many folk songs have been     
written about life in the N.E. of      
Scotland.These songs are known as      
"Bothy Ballads" and were often sung by 
farm workers in the evenings after a   
hard days work in the fields.          </content>
