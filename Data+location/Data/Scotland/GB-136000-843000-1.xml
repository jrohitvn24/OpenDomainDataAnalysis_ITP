		<title>01HIGH MOORLAND ON SKYE</title>
		<content> The block is a totally umpopulated    
 area of acid peat moorland. More than 
 half of the area has been planted or  
 is being planted with conifers. These 
 are mainly non-native species. Because
 of the small size of these conifers   
 the heathers and deergrass are still  
 the predominant flora. The            
 non-afforested areas support a very   
 small population of sheep and the     
 occasional cow, wandering in from the 
 block due west. The two small locks   
 are used by the occasional angler.    
 Due to the exposure and the poor soil 
 the area is not rich in fauna although
 birds such as Golden Plover seem to   
 find it to their liking. There are    
 also small numbers of Greenshanks,    
 short-eared owl, Dunlin and Red       
 Throated Divers.
