		<title>04The Church Part 2</title>
		<content> In 1910 the church was modernised and 
 the pulpit was moved to its present   
 position. The oak from the old pews   
 was used to line the{chancel.}A door  
 which was in the south wall has been  
 infilled and a new door opened in the 
 west wall under the{bell tower.}The   
{manse,}which is now a private dwelling
 called 'Mansfield',was originally the 
 home of the{ministers.}The manse was a
{Georgian}building before it was       
 enlarged and reconstructed in the 19th
 century.The church continues but the  
 minister now lives in the{manse}at    
 Tealing as the parishes of            
 Auchterhouse, Tealing and Murroes are 
 now linked and have only one minister,
 the{Rev. Mrs. Johnstone,}where there  
 used to be three. Today it is easier  
 for the minister to visit by car the  
 three parishes than it would be to    
 walk round one parish.                </content>
