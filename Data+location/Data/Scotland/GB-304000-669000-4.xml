		<content>    Scotland dominated the world's oil 
 scene until the 1860's due to the     
 scientific skill and business talent  
 of a man from a poor working -class   
 background. James Young discovered a  
 process which enabled oil to be       
 extracted from coal. The Bathgate     
 hills provided a particularly suitable
 coal called 'Cannel' or 'Parrot'      
 coal.(It burned like a candle and     
 chattered like a parrot.) Young set up
 his business locally and when the coal
 supply ran out the industry switched  
 to oil-producing shale and relocated  
 itself at Addiewell. The industry soon
 reached its peak employing 13000 men. 
 The existing towns of Broxburn, Mid   
 Calder and West Calder grew rapidly   
 and the new villages of               
 Pumpherston,Winchburgh, Niddrie,      
 LIvingston Station, Addiewell and     
 Seafield emerged.                     </content>
