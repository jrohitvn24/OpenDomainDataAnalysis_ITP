		<content> In our survey we asked a sample of 100
 people about their attitudes to       
 religion. Of the 100 interviewed, 74  
 said they were Christians. The        
 remaining 26 either did not believe in
 any God or were of a non-Christian    
 denomination. Of the 74 Christians, 45
 were Church of Scotland, 23 were Roman
 Catholics and the rest were from      
 smaller congregations, including 3    
 Church of England. Of the             
 non-Christians, 2 said they were      
 Jewish, 2 Muslim, the rest specified  
 'other.'                              
 Twenty three said they never go to    
 church, 11 said they go to weddings,  
 funerals etc. 5 go about once a       
 year(mainly at Christmas), 11 go about
 once a month and the rest go more     
 often.
