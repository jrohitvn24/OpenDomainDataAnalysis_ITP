		<title>15Family life in Boutie</title>
		<content> Extrmes of weather and daylight are   
 considerable factorsin daily life on  
 farms in bourtie and keithall/Kinkell.
 Families who have grown up in the     
 parishes hae one ritual in common a   
 hot midday meal, called dinner.  For  
 this reason children who are          
 transported by school bus from rural  
 homes to schools in Oldmeldrum,       
 keithall and Inverurie are also       
 provided with a hot midday meal at    
 school.  In winter buses collect      
 children at rural stops at 8 am when  
 it is still dark and deliver them home
 at 4 pm when again it is dark.  By    
 contrast during the summer holiday    
 months it is still light at midnight  
 on June 21st, and one can see to read 
 a book at 10 pm in mid-July.          
 Consequently families spend long      
 winter nights reading and watching    
 television, summer evenings outside.  </content>
