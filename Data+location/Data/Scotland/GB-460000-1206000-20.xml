		<title>20A newcomer's impressions</title>
		<content> Where we used to live there were lots 
 of trees, here there are none. We     
 lived between Bath and Chippenham.The 
 school I went to was Corsham School   
 with 1000 pupils, but the school here 
 has only 45. There, each lesson was an
 hour but here only 45 minutes.Here we 
 do History not Humanities.There the   
 buildings were bigger and so were the 
 games pitches.Unst is very different -
 bigger than I thought with not many   
 houses and quite a few ruins. I don't 
 like the weather because it is cool   
 and windy. The nights are very light  
 in June - it hardly gets dark at all.
