		<title>12HOME LIFE IN CALLANDER</title>
		<content> In Callander the{family unit }is still
 important.We have an increasing number
 of one parent families and a few      
 extended families.                    
 Up to 42 domestic{electric appliances}
 assist in food preparation,in the care
 of clothes and in gardening.Leisure   
 time is increasing and every home has 
 at least one T.V.,which is            
 watched regularly.Many children have  
 their own T.V.'s,radios,stereos and   
 cassette recorders as well as         
 computers.The average family has 2    
 children but they have little         
 responsibility for {household chores }
 or the care of pets.                  
 Fathers help a little in the running  
 of the home but take greater interest 
 in the garden or car.                 
 Whole families participate in         
 games,sports,outings and holidays.
