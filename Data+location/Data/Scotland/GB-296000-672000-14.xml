		<title>14Hospital Treatment</title>
		<content> During the Easter holiday I was       
 climbing a tree when I fell, landed   
 badly on my elbow and felt terrific   
 pain. Luckily my friend was with me   
 and he found my dad who took me to    
 Bangour Hospital. There I was x_rayed 
 and my arm put in a sling as it was   
 broken. There is no paediatrician at  
 the hospital so it was necessary to   
 travel 20 miles to Leith Hospital for 
 treatment. An ambulance was phoned for
 and arrived half an hour later. During
 the journey I was given a whiff of gas
 to help the pain. After arriving at   
 Leith Hospital I was put into bed and 
 had to wait about three hours before  
 being taken to the theatre where they 
 put me to sleep. When I woke up my arm
 was in a sling and was giving me jipp.
 In all I had to wait for five painful 
 hours to have my elbow set.
