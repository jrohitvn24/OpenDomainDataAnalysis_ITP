		<title>04HEALTH CARE IN ST.NINIANS.</title>
		<content> In the St.Ninians area there are      
{doctor's surgeries}situated near most 
 homes.  Most people are treated on the
 National Health but you can also be   
 treated privately. Also in this area  
 we have{chiropodists}and{orthidontists
 who sometimes come to the school.There
 are 3 orthidontists in our area -20%  
 of the people treated are adults.     
{Stirling Royal}is the only General    
 Hospital in the St. Ninians area. It  
 covers 5 acres and has 400 beds. There
 is a Nursing Home,Maternity Unit and a
 Childrens Ward where relatives can    
 sleep. The{Maternity Unit}is new and  
 the surgical block is being completed 
 now, 1985. It has lots of the latest  
 technological equipment and 7         
 operating theatres. There are special 
 doctor's houses nearby for them to    
 live in. (G.Hehir)
