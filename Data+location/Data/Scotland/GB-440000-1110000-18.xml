 The people who lived date from The    
 Stone Age to the 16th century.  Many

 Viking longship. If you are a keen    
 birdwatcher then one of the best      
 places to go is Sumburgh.There        
 are many interesting species of       
 birds,especially around the coast.In  
 Sumburgh there are two very nice      
 beaches. Our area has 2 hotels :
