		<title>08INTERVIEW WITH A FISHERMAN</title>
		<content>      MY DAD, WILLIAM WILSON, HAS BEEN 
 A FISHERMAN FOR 23 YEARS.  HE IS THE  
 SKIPPER OF THE LYNN MARIE, BCK86.     
      THE BOAT WAS BUILT IN HERDIES IN 
 1972 AND IS OF THE PRAWNER AND TRAWLER
 CLASS.  SHE IS 55 FEET LONG, CARRIES  
 FOUR OF A CREW AND FEATURES A TRANSOM 
 STERN AND HAS A DECKSHELTER AND       
 WHALEBACK.                            
      THE LYNN MARIE FISHES OUT OF     
 BUCKIE OR LOCHINVER.  IT IS AT SEA 4-5
 DAYS AT MOST.  THE FISH CAUGHT ARE    
 PREDOMINATELY PRAWNS BUT HADDOCK, COD 
 AND LEMON SOLE ARE ALSO CAUGHT.       
 BETWEEN 70 AND 120 BOXES ARE CAUGHT   
 WEEKLY.  THE PRICES ARE AROUND Â£15    
 -Â£25 FOR A SMALL BOX, Â£30-Â£50 MEDIUM  
 BOX AND Â£50-Â£80 LARGE BOX.            
      MY DAD LIKES HIS JOB ALTHOUGH IT 
 IS NOT EASY.  SOMETIMES HE IS SCARED  
 WHEN THERE IS A STORM.
