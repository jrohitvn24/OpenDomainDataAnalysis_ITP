		<title>07St. Brigid's Primary</title>
		<content>  Our school is called St Brigid's     
 Primary.  It was opened in 1958.      
 There are about 200 pupils in the     
 school.  As the school was designed   
 for a greater number of pupils we have
 a lot of empty classes.  The spare    
 classes are used for art work and     
 groups of children to work with the   
 computer.  In our class we sit in     
 groups at tables.  We keep our books  
 and jotters in a unit with pull out   
 trays.  We are divided into different 
 groups for  Maths and English.  The   
 teacher sits beside the group that she
 wishes to teach.  We also have an     
 extra teacher in school who works in  
 all the classes.  The primary 7       
 classes have visiting teachers from   
 their future secondary school.  On    
 Wednesday afternoons primary 4-7 have 
 activities e.g.Baking, sewing, sports.
  We do not need to wear uniforms.     </content>
