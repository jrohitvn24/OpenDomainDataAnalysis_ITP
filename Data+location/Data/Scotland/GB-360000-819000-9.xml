		<content> After the first World War an Army hut 
 was bought and erected at the west end
 of the village. There S.W.R.I. and    
 Social Club meetings were held as were
 dances, whist drives etc. In 1963 a   
 new Community Hall was built as part  
 of Keig Primary School. The community 
 contributed Â£1570 towards the fabric  
 and furnishing of the hall.           
 In this hall meetings of the S.W.R.I. 
 are now held.  A very successful      
 Bowling Club meets there on 3 nights  
 each week during autumn and winter.   
 The Church Women's Guild meeets in the
 Church Hall on the 4th. Thursday of   
 each month.                           
 A thriving football club plays on a   
 pitch at the enterance to the grounds 
 of Castle Forbes, the use of the land 
 was donated by the late Atholl, Lord  
 Forbes.
