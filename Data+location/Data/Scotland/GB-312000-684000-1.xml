		<content> Fife is a very fertile region, and the
 area south of Dunfermline and north of
 the Forth eastuary provides rich      
 arable land, facing south on gently   
 sloping hills, which is perfect for   
 crops such as{wheat},{barley}and{oil  
{seed rape}. Not surprisingly, from    
 the north of Inverkeithing the area is
 almost entirely composed of farmland. 
                                       
{Fordell}and the parish of{Dalgety}    
 provide a rich history, mainly of     
 mining (Fife is on a rich coal seam), 
 traces of which can still be seen     
 today.                                
                                       
 Now, Fordell is the{Scottish Scouts   
{Headquarters,}with an international   
 campsite.
