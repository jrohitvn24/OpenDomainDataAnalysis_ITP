		<title>16Pitscottie 50 Years Ago</title>
		<content>  An  elderly  lady,   now  staying  in
 Ceres, was asked about her memories of
 Pitscottie as it was  about  50  years
 ago.   She  and  her husband owned the
 general store. This is what she had to
 say:                                  
  "When  I  lived in Pitscottie in 1928
 there was a shop and Post Office.   We
 don't have the Post Office  any  more.
 There  was  a  horse  and  cart  which
 delivered the groceries to surrounding
 farms,  but  the horse was finished so
 we got a  motor  instead.   It  was  a
 two-seater  with  a  bit  at  the back
 where we put the groceries.  There was
 no garage in Pitscottie then but there
 was a blacksmith.                     
  We had to go down the street  to  get
 water from a pump.                    
  Pitscottie hasn't altered much  apart
 from a couple of extra houses and they
 do have running water now."           </content>
