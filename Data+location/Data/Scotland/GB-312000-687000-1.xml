		<title>01CROSSGATES AREA -AN OVERVIEW</title>
		<content>                                       
 The area containing Crossgates and    
 Halbeath is historically linked with {
{farming mining}and{communications.}   
 Today farming is still the predominant
 activity in the area, although the    
 open-cast mine at Crossgates, the new 
 regional road, the M90 motorway, the  
 Lauder technical College and the      
 influx of commuters have all had their
 effects upon the area.                
 The village of Halbeath is almost a   
 part of Dunfermline now, with the     
 Technical college its main feature.   
 It is in the tiny village of          
 Coaledge, near Crossgates, that the   
 image of the past is most readily     
 brought to mind: the hand of time has 
 left little mark upon Coaledge!
