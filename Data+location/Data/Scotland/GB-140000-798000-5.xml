		<title>05RHUM SEA EAGLE REINTRODUCED</title>
		<content> The Sea Eagle was once common         
 throughout Scotland and Ireland. Last 
 century it was persecuted by man until
 exterminated in 1916. The last nesting
 attempt on Rhum was in 1909 when the  
 adults were shot and their eggs taken.
 In 1975 the Nature Conservancy Council
 began a project to reintroduce the Sea
 Eagle on Rhum. Each year from 4 to 10 
 eaglets are taken from nests in Norway
 and transported to Scotland by the    
 R.A.F. After a couple of months in    
 captivity on Rhum they are released   
 but still provided with food until    
 they disperse and fend for themselves.
 They feed on fish, seabirds and       
 carrion, and take over 5 years to     
 reach sexual maturity. A total of 72  
 have been released (up to 1984) and   
 several pairs have now established and
 laid eggs. The first young was reared 
 in 1985.                              </content>
