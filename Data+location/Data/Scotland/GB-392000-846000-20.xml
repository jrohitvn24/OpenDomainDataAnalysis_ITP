		<title>20 MORE LOCAL CUSTOMS</title>
		<content>   St Andrew's Day is celebrated by    
 holding a Tartan Day each person must 
 wear something Tartan that day a kilt 
 or a tie or ribbon &amp; we sing scots    
 songs.Our favourite is Hey for the    
 Tartan.We learned some singing games &amp;
 rhymes in Scots &amp; tried writing poetry
 &amp; prose in Scots but most of us find  
 it difficult.A Burns Supper is held   
 in January &amp; local people entertain by
 singing Burns songs,reciting          
 poetry,highland dancing &amp; playing the 
 pipes.There are 3 young pipers in the 
 area.                                 
   Another local custom is still       
 continued to this day.If you are      
 walking under the Bow Briggie (the old
 train bridge) you are not allowed to  
 speak or else bad luck will befall    
 you.
