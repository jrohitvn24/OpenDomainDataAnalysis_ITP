		<title>17GALA WEEK IN EDAY</title>
		<content>    The Loch of Doomy has a great deal 
 of water in it in the winter time but 
 in the summer the loch dries up.      
    The people of Eday use the dry loch
 bed in the summer for their Gala Week 
 which is a kind of island sports      
 between the north and south ends of   
 the island.                           
    Every evening for a week there are 
 different events such as tractor and  
 trailer drivng over a course, running 
 races, obstacle races,and a clay      
 pigeon shoot.                         
    For children there are games in the
 Community Hall and the winner receives
 a cup.                                
    The week is finished off with a    
 dance and the presentation of the     
 cups.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
