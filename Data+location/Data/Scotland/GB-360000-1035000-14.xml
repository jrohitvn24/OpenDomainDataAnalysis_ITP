		<title>14BAPTIST CHURCH</title>
		<content>  In{1909,}a{chapel}was{built}in the   
 Southend. It was used every Sunday    
 from 11 o'clock until noon, but only  
 about 12 people attended. There was   
 also an evening service, however,     
 which was attended by many more       
 people.The chapel has no bell and no  
 spire.                                
  It was built by{Jimmy Grieve}(from   
 Silverhall) for a man called{John     
{Irvine,}who owned Stove farm and who  
 wanted to do something for the        
 Baptists.                             
  The last people to use it were       
{Baptists}who came in the summer time  
 two years ago from the neighbouring   
 islands of Westray and Eday; it was   
 also used for a service last autumn   
 held by a{visiting colporteur.}There  
 is little hope of the church staying  
 open much longer.
