		<title>14Kelso Civic Week</title>
		<content> Lots of things happen during Kelso    
 Civic Week; the{Funfair}comes,the     
{Kelso Laddie}is picked,there is       
 always a{raft race}and lots of other  
 events. The raft race is probably the 
 event which gains the most public     
 attention. Another is the{fancy dress 
{parade}when lorries are decorated and 
 people dress up, singing and dancing  
 and just being silly. The thing young 
 people enjoy most is the{fair.}There  
 is a good choice of shows like the Big
 Wheel, the Speedway, Waltzers,        
 roundabouts for little ones and lots  
 more. One of the other events is the  
{Yetholm Ride}when the Kelso Laddie and
 about 200 others ride 7 miles to the  
 village of Yetholm. Many of them      
 usually get drunk there!. The Yetholm 
 Ride is a reminder of the times when  
 people in Scotland used to raid the   
 north of England and steal cattle.    </content>
