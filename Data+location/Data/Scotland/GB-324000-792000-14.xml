		<title>14The Clachanturn Ghost</title>
		<content> Three hundred years ago the Laird of  
 Abergeldie acted as judge at the trial
 of a local maidservant accused of     
 being a witch. Her name was Katie     
 Rankie. She was held in the dungeon   
 under the castle.                     
 After the trial she was killed at a   
 place called Creag nam Ban. Her head  
 was chopped off.                      
 Her ghost is said to wander Abergeldie
 Forest searching for her head and     
 screaming.                            
 I live beside Abergeldie Forest at a  
 place called Clachanturn farmhouse I  
 have not seen Katie Rankie haunting   
 but I do believe in ghosts. It is very
 creepy walking in the woods alone at  
 night. The barns are half falling down
 and there is the carcass of a rabbit  
 lying on the ground.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
