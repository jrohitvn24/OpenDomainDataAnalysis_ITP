		<title>01Area around Pennan</title>
		<content> The area consists of high pasture land
 with steep cliffs dropping to the sea.
 the area is sparsely populated with   
 most people being farmers. The        
 exception is the small harbour town of
 Pennan from which one lobster         
 fisherman works. The old fishermen's  
 houses are being renovated and most   
 are being lived in permanently,       
 some are used as holiday homes. These 
 people work either in Fraserburgh or  
 Banff.                                
 The primary aged chidren go to school 
 in New Aberdeen, 3 miles away and will
 go to secondary school in Banff.      
 People from surrounding towns use     
 Pennan as a base watersports, water   
 skiing, sail boarding, canoeing.      
 Despite the population being small,   
 approxiately 30, there is a good      
 community spirit. A major film called 
 'Local Hero' was filmed in Pennan     </content>
