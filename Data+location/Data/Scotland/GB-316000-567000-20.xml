		<content>   {Spittalriddinghill,}our other farm,
 also has an interesting name. The     
 place where the farm buildings now    
 stand was originally a hospital, hence
 'Spittal'.                            
    The farm is rather smaller than    
 Limekilns, about 240 acres or 90      
 hectares.                             
    Most of the livestock are calves   
 and bullocks and there is one cow and 
 a few sheep.                          
    Most of the 16 fields are in grass 
 for silage and hay. Peas, beans,      
 barley, winter wheat, turnips and     
 potatoes are also grown.              
    Only a very small number of farms  
 in our area are privately owned. Most 
 are tenanted with the land belonging  
 to the{Hoddom and Kinmount Estates.}
