		<content> Inmates rise at 6.15 am to wash and   
 dress, and room inspection at 7.00 am.
 Inmates then go to the dining room for
 breakfast. Inmate work parties then   
 go to the farm, the workshops and the 
 gardens where they work from 8 am till
 4 pm with a 1 hour lunchbreak, and    
 teabreaks at 10 o'clock and 3 o'clock.
 After work the inmates have their tea 
 in the dining room and then they are  
 locked in their rooms till 6.15 pm and
 this allows the officers to be fed.   
 The inmates are then allowed out for  
 recreation time. Supper is at 8.30 pm 
 and the inmates are locked up at 9 pm 
 and the lights are out at 11 o'clock. 
 Night classes and education are       
 encouraged. After 4 months an inmate  
 can be upgraded which gives 1 open    
 visit each month, going swimming on   
 Saturday morning, and to a football   
 match on Saturday afternoon.          </content>
