		<content> We went to visit Lochend House and    
 interviewed Mr Nairn, the present     
 owner about the chalets he has built  
 in the grounds. Lochend House is over 
 100yrs old and is on the southern     
 shore of the Lake.                    
  Mr Nairn started in 1973 with 10     
 chalets which cost Â£5000 each.He now  
 has 14 and each would cost Â£30,000 to 
 build today. When full 90 people can  
 be accomodated and they are usually   
 fully booked from May to September.   
 About 5% of the 2000 guests come from 
 overseas. The low % of foreigners is  
 due to the fact that the English      
 people book their holidays from       
 November to January whereas the       
 Europeans do not do so until March or 
 April.At the peak season it costs     
 Â£185-Â£200+VAT PER WEEK.VAT is charged 
 at 15% at present.
