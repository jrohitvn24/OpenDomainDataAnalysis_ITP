    The average number of children in a
 family in our school is 4. Most of the
 mums and dads work in Coatbridge. Some
 parents who work all day send their   
 children to grandparents who look     
 after them. Out of 73 children in our 
 school 35 have videos. Spare time is  
 spent watching videos, t.v.,or going  
 walks. 20 families in our school have 
 a car. Most families have tea about 5 
 o'clock. Most children go to bed      
 between 8 o'clock and 10 o'clock and  
 then the mums and dads watch t.v. or  
 get a baby sitter and go out to a     
 club. Some mums and dads play indoor  
 bowls. Coatbridge has a very big      
 indoor centre. The world bowling      
 championships were held here this     
 year.
