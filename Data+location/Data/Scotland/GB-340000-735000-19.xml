		<title>19FORFAR ROAD IMPROVEMENT</title>
		<content> The{A929 ROAD}from Dundee to Forfar   
 and Aberdeen has been upgraded and    
 work is in progress to form dual-     
 carriageway. The work is being funded 
 by the Scottish Development           
 Department. This means that the       
 coastal route A92 to Aberdeen via     
 Montrose, unsuitable for heavy traffic
 because of old narrow bridges, will be
 detrunked and become the              
 responsibility of Grampian and Tayside
 Regions. Work on the new road is      
 almost complete in the surveyed block.
 Few local people are complaining about
 the disruption but some farmers have  
 lost land and one petrol station is no
 longer on the road and the owner is   
 considering changing his line of      
 business. Elderly people complain that
 they will have difficulty crossing to 
 bus stops. There is a roads depot at  
{INVERALDIE}for winter equipment.      </content>
