		<content> The Press &amp; Journal, Aberdeen.        
 Together the Press &amp; Journal and its  
 sister paper the Evening Express are  
 read by nearly 450,000 people, about  
 3/4 of Grampian's population. Founded 
 in 1784 by James Chalmers, the        
 newspaper was originally printed and  
 published in Castle St. before moving 
 to Broad St. in the city centre.During
 the 20th C. amalgamation took place   
 with the Aberdeen Free Press to form  
 Aberdeen Journals Ltd. The move to the
 present location took place in 1970.  
 Among the best 'scoops' was the       
 Express coverage of the story of      
 Britain's first surrogate mother,     
 while the P&amp;J has launched many       
 spectacularly successful appeals such 
 as the Cavitron Appeal and the recent 
 'Save our Shipyard ' campaign.
