		<title>12Changing times on Papa Stour</title>
		<content> In 1962 the islanders of Papa Stour   
 got piped water which made life much  
 easier.The water comes from{Gorda-    
{Water}which is a deep loch in the     
 centre of the island.Before then      
 people had to get all their drinking  
 water and water for washing from      
 wells.The nearest well to my house is 
{Chapel well}which is 400'm away!      
   Sometimes in the summer the wells   
 dried up and water had to be carried  
 from Gorda-Water (1km).Water also had 
 to be carried to the animals and on a 
 windy day you would only have half a  
 bucket of water left!                 
   Two years later the first generator 
 came and people  were able to have    
 electric lights.Before that they used 
 gas lights or Tilly lamps.In the same 
 year the first television set arrived.
   This year we got channel 4,now we   
 have four T.V. channels.              </content>
