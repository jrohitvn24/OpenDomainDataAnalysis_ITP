		<title>05    Save The Children</title>
		<content> In many parts of the world children   
 are alone, ill or dying of starvation.
 The Save The Children organisation is 
 trying to help this.                  
    We were working as usual when our  
 teacher suggested we should do        
 something to help the starving people 
 of Ethiopia and other places where    
 there is drought and war going on.    
   First we sent a note round the      
 school asking everybody to bring in   
 any books or toys they had grown tired
 of. We said our sale was to help the  
 "Save The Children" fund.             
   Every day children brought in bags  
 of books and toys.They covered the    
 desks and the floor until there was no
 space left.                           
    On Friday morning we put everything
 into piles on the tables with price   
 tickets on,and hoped for the best.The 
 total was Â£82!                        </content>
