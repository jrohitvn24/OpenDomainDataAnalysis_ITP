		<title>10A SHORT HISTORY OF CULROSS 2</title>
		<content>   In the sixth century the monks of   
 Culross gave refuge to the pregnant   
 mother of Kentigern later to be called
 St. Mungo, patron saint of Glasgow.The
 saint was born in Culross and educated
 by St.Serf.  The monks were the first 
 miners in Culross. Hand-in-glove with 
 mining in seaside towns went          
 salt-panning. Inferior, very smokey   
 coal from the mines was used in fires 
 to evaporate salt water. Culross had  
 fifty.It must have been very smokey!  
   As in many Fife coastal towns trade 
 was carried on with Scandinavia and   
 the Low Countries.They exported coal  
 and salt and brought back pantiles as 
 ballast. Rich merchants not only used 
 the pantiles but copied the designs of
 roofs from those countries with which 
 they traded. Culross became rich -the 
 "Culross chalder" became the Standard 
 Scottish measure for weighing coal.   </content>
