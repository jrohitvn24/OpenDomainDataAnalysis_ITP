		<content> 'Tranent by-pass is given the 'go-    
 ahead' was the headlines in a local   
 newspaper.It should be operational by 
 1976.The newspaper was dated 1973.    
 Twelve years on the dream becomes a   
 reality - but the original proposal   
 was put forward more than twenty years
 ago.A survey on local shops showed    
 that nearly all thought that the by-  
 pass would make little difference to  
 trade.New housing schemes have        
 increased volume of trade.This is not 
 the case of the residents of Glen     
 Heugh cottage,TRANENT.While the by-   
 pass does not directly affect them    
 the link road was planned to pass     
 through their property. The cottage   
 used to belong to the station master. 
 The railway was the first wooden      
 railway in Scotland.At a public       
 enquiry a petition was presented to   
 save the cottage.No decision was made.</content>
