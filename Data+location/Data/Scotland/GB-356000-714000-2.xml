 This is a coastal area on the East    
 coast of Scotland,approximately three 
 miles from St. Andrews.               
    The land area is undulating        
 deposits of rather sandy boulder clay 
 which gives much rich farmland. It    
 slopes gently to the coast.           
    The shoreline is rocky, except for 
 the mouth of the Kenley Burn. The burn
 has cut a deep valley into the boulder
 clay and this is a significant break  
 in the landscape. The valley sides are
 thickly wooded in contrast to the open
 landscape of the intensively          
 cultivated surrounding farmland.      
   The only settlement is the small    
 village of Boarhills situated in the  
 South West of the block.
