		<content> The most notable {Pig Farm}in this    
 area is visited by interested farmers 
 from all over the world.The owner is  
 the only Super Nucleus Herd Breeder in
 Scotland, breeding Large Whites and   
 Landrace pigs.The boar and the sow are
 carefully chosen to produce a good    
 litter, and often artificial          
 insemination is used.                 
{Manor House}                          
 This establishment,previously known as
 Turin House, is a{residential home}for
 the elderly.It is staffed mainly by   
 local people, plus some from          
 neighbouring towns.The house is set in
 its own grounds and there is the      
 possibility that it may become a      
 Nursing Home as professional staff    
 is found.
