		<title>18    Methil Library</title>
		<content> Of the five libraries in the district,
 Methil Public is the largest.The      
 library and the war memorial in the   
 park opposite were built with money   
 donated by local people.They are      
 memorials to these who served in the  
 1914-18 war.                          
     Renovations completed in March    
 1985 made the inside larger,more open 
 and comfortable with a welcoming      
 atmosphere .Of the 40000 books romance
 and western stories are the most      
 popular. There is a childrens section,
 a reading room where magazines and    
 daily newspapers are and a cassette   
 library.For the housebound a mobile   
 library travels round taking books to 
 peoples homes.Books in Braille,even   
 stories on tape make it possible for  
 the blind to enjoy the service.Only   
 30% of the population use the library 
 although there is high unemployment.  </content>
