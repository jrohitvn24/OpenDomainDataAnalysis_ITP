		<title>17HIGHLAND DANCING</title>
		<content>    Most of the girls in  our school go
 to{Highland Dancing.}There is one in  
 Muirtown School and one in the        
 Spectrum Centre. For the Highland     
 Dancing you have to wear shorts and   
 T-shirt. It costs 70p or 80p. You only
 wear shorts if you are going to       
 practice. If we are performing        
 or taking exams, we wear kilts.       
 We get medals if we do well in        
 the exam. I have six medals.          
    Every year we have to dance        
 at the parks for the tourists. Quite a
 lot of people  come to watch us do    
 dances like the{Sword Dance}and{      
{Highland Fling.}Sometimes there are   
 some galas and you have to dance in a 
 field.
