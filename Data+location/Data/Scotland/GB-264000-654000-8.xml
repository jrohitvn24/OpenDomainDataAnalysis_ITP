		<content> EAST KILBRIDE...BASKET FARM           
 Basket Farm is situated between East  
 Kilbride and Blantyre; three quarters 
 being in Blantyre and one quarter in  
 East Kilbride.Basket Farm is so called
 because,when the River Calder,the farm
 boundary to the west,could not be     
 forded,a basket and pulleys were used 
 to cross.Although the farm is now beef
 producing,for a short time milk was   
 produced and sold to the Milk         
 Marketing Board.Farm machinery        
 consists of two tractors,a hay bailer 
 and a grass cutter.Only grass is grown
 for pasture for the 179 beef cattle.  
 Basket Farm was bought by the present 
 owner in 1942.Within the boundaries of
 Basket Farm  are the ruins of a small 
 castle.Early in the 18th century,one  
 of the Maxwell land owners in the town
 built it for his wife so that he would
 not have to listen to her nagging!    </content>
