		<content>        A day at the baths             
                                       
  My class visits the baths every      
 Friday morning with our teacher. A bus
 comes to the school and takes us to   
 Coatbridge baths which are about 5    
 minutes away.When we get there we get 
 changed very quickly and then wait at 
 the side of the pool until the        
 attendant tells us what to do. We are 
 put into groups. Group A are those who
 can swim well, group B are those who  
 can swim a bit and group C are those  
 who cannot swim. There is now only one
 girl in group C out of 27 pupils.     
 Group A are now learning to dive. It  
 is great fun at the baths and we are  
 always exhausted after the 40 minutes 
 in the water. We can get a drink of   
 hot chocolate from a machine before we
 go back to school.
