		<title>06CLUBS IN GLENLIVET HALL</title>
		<content>   The hall is used  most frequently in
 the winter by the  bowling,  badminton
 and youth clubs.                      
   The mother and toddler  group  meets
 one afternoon every week except during
 school holidays. Mothers with children
 under school age meet to  chat  or  to
 help the children draw,  paint, model,
 play games or just let  them  sleep in
 their prams.                          
   A piping class meets once a week and
 many local youngsters have  learned to
 play the bagpipes under the  excellent
 tuition of a local man.               
  {The Community Association }holds its
 meetings every two months in the hall.
 The District and Regional  Councillors
 for the area attend these meetings and
 give advice on any matters  which  are
 giving rise to concern.The Councillors
 can  take  any  problem  back  to  the
 relevant Council department.          </content>
