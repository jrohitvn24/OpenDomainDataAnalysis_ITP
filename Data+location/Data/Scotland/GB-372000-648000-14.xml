		<title>14COMMUNICATIONS WITH POLWARTH</title>
		<content> THE A6105 ROAD IS THE CHIEF LINK IN   
 THE AREA RUNNING FROM EARLSTON BY     
 GREENLAW &amp; DUNS TO BERWICK. BUSES ARE 
 INFREQUENT &amp; UNLESS A CAR IS OWNED,   
 WHICH IT IS BY MOST, POLWARTH &amp;       
 MARCHMONT ARE MUCH MORE REMOTE THAN   
 THEY WERE FOR THE HUNDRED YEARS UNTIL 
 THE 1948 FLOOD SWEPT AWAY THE RAILWAY 
 BRIDGES &amp; MARCHMONT STATION WAS       
 CLOSED, &amp; SUBSEQUENTLY THE SUB POST   
 OFFICE THERE. FOR THE SMALL MINORITY  
 IN THE AREA WHO DO NOT HAVE A         
 TELEPHONE THERE IS A PUBLIC BOX AT    
 POLWARTH. THE POSTMAN IN A VAN        
 DELIVERS LETTERS &amp; PARCELS &amp; ALSO     
 COLLECTS THEM. THE BORDER COURIER DOES
 PASS ON WEEKDAYS ON ITS SLOW BUT      
 POTENTIALLY USEFUL ROUND OF THE LOCAL 
 HOSPITALS &amp; CAN TAKE A FEW ( PATIENT) 
 PASSENGERS &amp; PARCELS.                 
                                       
                                       </content>
