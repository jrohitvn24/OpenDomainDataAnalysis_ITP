		<content>{HOUSING }in the block falls into three
 rough categories.There are two groups 
 of houses in the village built as     
 estates:{Forestry houses }including 6 
 bungalows and 20 semi-detached        
 two-storied houses,and the council    
 built{Weens Place,}with 10 recently   
 modernised semi-detached houses.Many  
 of both of these are now in private   
 ownership.There are also a further 5  
 older cottages in the part of the     
 village in our block,and {13          
{farm- or larger stone houses}in more  
 isolated positions,and{34 cottages}or 
 similar scattered throughout the      
 block.At least six of these are empty 
 or{holiday homes.}Many cottages are   
 owned by the local farmers to house   
 farmworkers,but an increasing number  
 are owned or rented by people who work
 in Hawick.Only two seem to have been  
 built in the last 20 years.           </content>
