		<title>17TUG-O-WAR BONAR BRIDGE.</title>
		<content> In 1976 a few men thought that it was 
 time to start a{local tug-o-war team. 
 They asked friends if they would take 
 part. So they started training .They  
 attached heavy weights on to a pulley 
 and attached the rope they pull on to 
 that .They train 2 nights a week. On  
 August, 8th. 1976, they competed in   
 the{Golspie Gala Week}and won. They   
 called the team{the Bonar Bridge      
{Caledonion.}After a few years they    
 became famous all over Scotland.      
 During 1983-84 they won the{104       
{stone Scottish Championships.}They    
 pay their expenses with the money they
 raise at sales of work and their prize
 money . At Christmas they give        
 presents to the old age pensioners.   
 There is another team called{Swordale.
 In the years to come they hope to have
 many more trophies .
