		<content> In our area there are five Primary    
 schools called Capshard, Dunearn, Fair
 Isle, Torbain and Valley. Altogether  
 there are 2428 pupils and 108         
 teachers. The pupil population is     
 falling. The average number of pupils 
 in a class is 30. Three of the schools
 have nursery classes attached.The     
 standard of behaviour is really very  
 good but may be deteriorating. There  
 are three or four computers in each   
 school and they are hoping for        
 another. The computers are used for   
 making up quizzes,following up maths  
 work or using an adventure program fo 
 language.The school day is spent on   
 Language ,Mathematics, Environmental  
 Studies and the Aesthetic subjects all
 of which may be combined in a theme or
 project.
