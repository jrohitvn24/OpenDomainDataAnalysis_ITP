		<title>02A DAY IN THE LIFE OF EMMA.</title>
		<content>  A Monday in my life begins at 8am    
 when I get up and get ready for       
 school. At 8.15 I have a breakfast of 
 toast, cereal or egg. At 8.25 I feed  
 the hens and collect the eggs.        
  8.35 I cycle to Uig Hall to meet the 
 school car.                           
  9.30 I start school and do maths and 
 mental arithmetic.                    
  11.00 I have an interval and play    
 with my friends at ball or skipping.  
  11.20 I do reading and work with the 
 computer.                             
  12.15 I have lunch and go out to     
 play.                                 
  1.30 I do art, projects and sometimes
 gardening.                            
  3.45 I get the school car home, feed 
 the hens and go out to play. At 5.00 I
 have a tea of pancakes then change    
 into my Brownie uniform. At 9.30 I go 
 to bed.                               </content>
