		<content>{ROADS AND TRANSPORT 1915_85}          
 Roads were just rough metal and broken
 stones. Steam rollers ran over the    
 road to flatten it. Men used to knap  
 (break) stones up at Kirkland. There  
 is still a hole there.                
 There were very few cars then.        
 Farmers only had cars. Some people    
 used a horse and cart. Now a lot of   
 people have cars.                     
{Church 1915_85}                       
 Every Sunday the church was packed out
 and all the farmers were there. Now   
 they are lucky to get 30 people.      
{Shop 1915_85}                         
 The shop is much the same, but it is  
 no longer a Post Office. Children did 
 not buy many sweets, as they could not
 afford them. Most of us get about Â£2  
 to spent on sweets weekly.
