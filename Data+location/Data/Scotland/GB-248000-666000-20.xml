		<content> Here are comments from 2 adults who   
 live in Renfrew.                      
{Mrs Betty MacKinnon: "I like living in
{Renfrew. It's central for everything_ 
{Glasgow ,Paisley, the coast. The      
{people are very friendly. The shops   
{could be better and it's not good for 
{entertainment. There are only pubs."  
 Mr Campbell Henderson: "I feel sorry  
 for the Kids. There's not much for    
 them to do. The place is clean and    
 there's not much vandalism. I like it 
 better then city living. If it wasn't 
 for the Scouts and my hobbies though  
 I'd be bored.
