		<content> In the official enquiry into the      
 disaster it was agreed that if        
 precautions had been taken the blast  
 may not have happened.                
 Mrs Parish who lived across the road  
 phoned the fire brigade from her house
 two hundred yards away.She had thought
 that her house had been hit by a truck
 or somethng.People nearby could hear  
 screams from people downstairs who    
 were trapped because there was no     
 stair way.The fire started when a man 
 went down into the basement to get a  
 hoover.All the meters underneath had  
 burst and when the man opened the door
 the air met with the gas and          
 exploded.Scottish gas admitted there  
 was a connection with the explosion   
 and a gas man who suffered great shock
 while working with gas pipes at the   
 time of the explosion.
