  The area surveyed is part of Hamilton
 District Council. It comprised of 4   
 wards with a total electorate of just 
 over 16000. The turn out at the last  
 elections (May 1984) was about 45% on 
 average and all 4 seats were won by   
 Labour candidates who got about 83% of
 the poll in 3 seats, but in the ward  
 which is mostly owner-occupied and    
 largely out of our area, only 38%.    
   The Council has 17 Labour council-  
 lors, 1 Conservative and 2 Alliance.  
 The other feature of this election was
 the performance of the Alliance cand- 
 idates.
