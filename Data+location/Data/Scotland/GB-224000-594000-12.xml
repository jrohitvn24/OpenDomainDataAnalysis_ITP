		<title>12SHOPS AND BUSINESSES IN BARR</title>
		<content> Trade in the area is found only in the
 confines of the village.              
 One business which relies basically on
 the villagers is the local store/post 
 office.Four part-timers are employed  
 on a rota basis.Certain goods         
 (newspapers and milk) are delivered to
 the store daily from Girvan by service
 bus. A road haulage company has its   
 headquarters in the village but only  
 employs two local drivers to drive the
 school taxis.                         
 The two hotels are family-run         
 businesses and rely heavily on        
 tourism.                              
 The estate of Alton Albany receives a 
 small income from shooting and renting
 summer cottages.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
