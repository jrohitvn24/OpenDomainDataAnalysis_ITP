		<title>12Oldmeldrum Sports Gala Day</title>
		<content> Each year for the past 50 years on the
 third weekend in June a festival of   
 highland games - Oldmeldrum Sports  - 
 has been held in the Pleasure Park,   
 Oldmeldrum.  Pipe bands alternate with
 Scottish country dance contests,      
 sideshows compete for spectators'     
 attention with skydivers landing in   
 the centre of the field; and there is 
 always a lengthy tug-o'-war contest   
 for men and women which draws in teams
 from all around Aberdeenshire.  The   
 'Sports' are run by a group of local  
 businessmen and farmers who volunteer 
 their services and tend to hold office
 for life.  A current favourite        
 television or entertainment star      
 performs the opening ceremony and has 
 tea in the officials pavilion while   
 other revellers refresh themseles in  
 the giant tea marquee, used at night  
 for the annual Sports Dance.          </content>
