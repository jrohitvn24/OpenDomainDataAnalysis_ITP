		<content> For young people there are many youth 
 clubs.  These youth clubs are held in 
 community halls and are open to       
 children aged 5 to 16.  These young   
 people meet, play darts, table tennis 
 and listen to records.  Discos are    
 held regularly. For the older         
 generation there are many public      
 houses and social clubs where cabarets
 are held at weekends. Bingo is a      
 popular leisure activity especially   
 with women. There are several bingo   
 halls and many of the social clubs and
 churches hold bingo evenings.  The    
 public library is a place for the     
 whole family.  It satisfies everyone's
 need for reading.  The younger        
 children have a separate section from 
 teenagers and adults.  There is also a
 reference section, this is for people 
 to get books to study with instead of 
 taking them home.                     </content>
