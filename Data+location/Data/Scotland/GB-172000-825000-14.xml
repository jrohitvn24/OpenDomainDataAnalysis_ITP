 The Mod is a competition for Children 
 which is usually held in June every   
 year.The Mod is when children take    
 part in Gaelic songs,poems and        
 readings.Gaelic can be a very         
 difficult language to learn.          
 In our primary school a Gaelic teacher
 comes to teach us.No one can speak    
 fluent Gaelic yet but most people     
 enjoy it.It is a very intresting      
 language and some people on the island
 do not speak any English at all only  
 Gaelic.Here is a Gaelic sentence     {
{Failte do'n Eilean Sgianthanach !   } 
 Welcome to the Isle of Skye !
