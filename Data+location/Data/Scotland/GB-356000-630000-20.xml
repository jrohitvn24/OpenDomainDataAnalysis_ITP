		<title>20St.Boswells Fair.</title>
		<content> The annual St.Boswells Fair dates back
 to 1784 and has traditionally taken   
 place on the village green on the     
 18th. July. It used to be a horse fair
 and attracted gypsies from as far away
 as Ireland and the North of           
 Scotland.The gypsies trade with each  
 other as well as the locals and       
 although the horses have now gone     
 gypsies still come to the fair to keep
 the traditions alive.                 
     Recent years however have seen a  
 substantial decline in the size of the
 event and 1985 in particular saw the  
 smallest number of caravans ever on   
 the green. Among the reasons suggested
 for this decline are the fact that the
 gypsies are now moved on after only   
 two days on the green, and the trend  
 among younger gypsies to live in      
 normal houses in the winter,with a    
 resultant weakening of tradition.     </content>
