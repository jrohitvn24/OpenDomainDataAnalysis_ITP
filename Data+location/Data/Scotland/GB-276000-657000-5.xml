		<title>05RELIGION IN THE LOCAL AREA</title>
		<content>  Religion plays a strong part in local
 life.There is a strong Roman Catholic 
 in the area and a shrine was built in 
 the 1920's by unemployed miners in    
 Carfin.                               
  A grotto was built which is a        
 miniature version of the Lourdes      
 grotto in France.The grotto is visited
 by 10,000 people every year.Twice     
 every month people come to worship.   
  During the summer regular outdoor    
 worship is held every Sunday.Some of  
 the visitors come from as far away as 
 England and the North of Scotland.    
  There have been hardly any           
 significant changes to the grotto,the 
 mayor ones being the addition of a    
 shrine,a small lake and a bridge      
 commemmorating the visit of Pope John 
 Paul II
