		<content>      IN BURRA THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT 
 KINDS OF SEAL, COMMON AND GREY. THEY  
 ARE EASY TO TELL APART BECAUSE THE    
 GREY SEAL HAS SPOTS ON ITS BACK AND   
 THE HEAD OF THE COMMON SEAL LOOKS A   
 BIT LIKE A DOG.                       
      OTTERS ARE VERY SHY CREATURES AND
 THERE ARE FEW SIGHTINGS. THEY LIVE ON 
 FISH. THE FEMALE USUALLY HAS TWO TO   
 FOUR CUBS.                            
      THE FIRST SIGHTING OF RABBITS IN 
 SHETLAND WAS IN BURRA IN 1654. THERE  
 ARE BOTH BROWN AND BLACK RABBITS.     
      THE MICE IN SHETLAND ARE RELATED 
 TO NORWEGIAN MICE AND PROBABLY CAME   
 OVER ON VIKING BOATS.                 
      IN THE SEA AROUND BURRA THERE ARE
 PORPOISES &lt;NEESIKS>, WHALES AND       
 OCCASIONALLY SHARKS ARE CAUGHT BY     
 FISHERMEN.                            
      SOMETIMES BATS LAND IN SHETLAND  
 BY MISTAKE, ON THEIR WAY ELSEWHERE.   </content>
