		<content> Shore Mills is a long, narrow strip of
 land with a house and camping site,   
 about 3 miles out of the old fishing  
 village of Cromarty on the east - west
 coast road.                           
    The camping site is not exactly    
 massive, only about 50 metres long by 
 20 metres wide, but big enough for the
 custom it gets.                       
    The owner lives in the long, old   
 house by the side of the camp site.   
   The Black-Isle is a very interesting
 place to spend a holidy and Shore     
 Mills is a good position for          
 travelling around. The old fishing    
 village of Cromarty is full of        
 interesting facts, history and        
 architecture. There are also lots of  
 other interesting places on the       
 Black-Isle such as Fortrose Cathedral,
 and there are some very attractive    
 views around as well.                 </content>
