		<content> My name is Craig. Iam a farmer's son. 
 We have a farm near the village of    
 West Linton. I am going to tell you   
 what I did on a Saturday in June when 
 I was not at school.                  
   I got up at 7.30,had my breakfast   
 and went out on my 3 wheeler byke to  
 collect cattle feed  from the barn. I 
 then went with my dad to the big field
 to feed the calves that had been      
 weaned. We then went to inspect the   
 cows that had recently calved to see  
 if they had the "Staggers"- a disease 
 that cows sometimes get, After my     
 father had had his breakfast we went  
 to gather sheep with Meg the dog. We  
 went on motor bykes and the dog could 
 go where the byke could not go.  I had
 to take a stray hog back to the field.
 When I had finished helping my father 
 I cut the grass outside the farmhouse.
 My father then gave me my pocket money</content>
