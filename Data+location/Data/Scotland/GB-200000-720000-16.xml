		<content>  A great number of tourists are       
 attracted to this area because of the 
 fishing in Loch Awe and surrounding   
 lochs. Salmon,sea trout,brown trout   
 rainbow trout, char, pike and perch   
 are all species found in the loch.    
  The rainbow trout is the only        
 specimen introduced to the loch not by
 controlled stocking but by fish       
 escaping from several fish farms      
 situated on the loch. Some anglers    
 feel that the introduction of the     
 "rainbows" has had a detrimental      
 effect on the brown trout fishing.    
  Fishing has always been free on Loch 
 Awe but in the past months local      
 landowners have been considering some 
 types of control on fishing due to    
 damage caused by a small minority of  
 inconsiderate anglers. This issue will
 undoubtedly be a controversial topic  
 for discussion in angling circles.    </content>
