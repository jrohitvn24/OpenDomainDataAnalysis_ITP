		<content> Although there are no facilities for  
 clubs in the immediate area, many of  
 the residents belong to clubs and     
 organisations in the neighbourhood.   
   For children of primary school age  
 there is a Brownie pack which meets   
 weekly at Murroes School. There is a  
 Parent-Teacher Association at the     
 school, which is open to the parents  
 of all pupils. The Women's Rural      
 Institute meet in their own premises  
 in Westhall Terrace, and this hall is 
 also used by the Senior Citizens'     
 Club.                                 
                                       
   The information for this project was
 compiled jointly by the staff and     
 pupils of Mattocks School, Wellbank   
 and Murroes School, Duntrune, in June,
 1985.
