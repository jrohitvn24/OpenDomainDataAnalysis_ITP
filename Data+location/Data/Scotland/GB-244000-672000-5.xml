		<title>05ERSKINE BRIDGE</title>
		<content>  For centuries there had been a{ferry 
 across the river Clyde at Erskine, but
 the ever{increasing growth of traffic 
 made the building of the bridge, which
 was{completed in July 1971 very       
{necessary.                            
  The bridge and its approach roads    
 provide an important{North South      
 connection over the{Clyde}estuary     
 between the A82 and the A8, carrying  
 heavy commuter traffic between{Glasgow
 and the{Loch Lomond}area and connects 
 with the Northern ringroads round     
 Glasgow.                              
   On the south side, the road system  
 serves Glasgow's{international airport
{at Abbotsinch,}on  the south bank of  
 the Clydeside and connects with       
 several trunk roads to the south. The 
 bridge thus forms an{essential road   
{link}for all{future developments.
