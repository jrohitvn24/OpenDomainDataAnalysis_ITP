		<title>03COCHNO FARM,HARDGATE.</title>
		<content> On the lower slopes of the Kilpatrick 
 Hills between 150m. and 300m. above   
 sea level were large estates belonging
 to the owners of the mills of Hardgate
 After World War II Cochno estate was  
 sold to Glasgow University and is now 
 used by their school  of Veterinary   
 Medicine as a farm where their        
 students can learn about animals.     
   It takes three hours to walk round  
 the perimeter of the farm as it's area
 is seventy one hectares.Because the   
 farm is in the West of Scotland they  
 can grow only grass-it is too wet to  
 grow crops like barley and wheat -so  
 they have grazing animals such as cows
 and sheep.There are 40 Herefords and  
 100 Fresians which produce 1500 litres
 of milk a day.They also have a piggery
 goats and donkeys. They experiment    
 with animal feeds and treat sick      
 animals too.                          </content>
