		<title>06Problem sheep</title>
		<content> There is only one crofter in Torridon 
 who keeps sheep.As there is no common 
 grazing there should be no sheep      
 wandering in Fasaig.The local crofter 
 keeps his sheep within the croft land 
 providing them with supplementary     
 feeding such as hay, cereals (barley &amp;
 maize),ewe &amp; lamb mix,cake etc.He also
 keeps his sheep numbers to what the   
 land can support. He has to pay 50p a 
 head levy to the N.T. However,crofters
 in the neighbouring villages keep more
 sheep than their land can support and 
 do not provide sufficient extra feed, 
 So they allow their sheep to wander to
 this area to find extra grazing feed. 
 This causes damage to gardens &amp; fences
 and fouls the public road and grass   
 areas.Children and pets get ticks off 
 the sheep.Excreta is carried on feet  
 into buildings causing nuisance dirt. 
 So far hydatid is not prevalent here. </content>
