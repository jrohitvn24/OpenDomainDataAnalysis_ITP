		<title>03HISTORY OF CLACHAIG.</title>
		<content> The history of Clachaig began when    
 Thomas Harkness fought alongside the  
 Duke of Argyll's forces in the {1715  
{Jacobite Rebellion}.For services      
 rendered he was rewarded the piece of 
 land called Clachaig.                 
  When Thomas Harkness died, his son   
 came to Clachaig with 15 sheep.He was 
 the only farmer who allowed his sheep 
 to graze freely.He had married 3 times
 and 76 descendants attended his       
 funeral!                              
  After a period of time Mr Sheriff    
 built a factory to manufacture        
 gunpowder in Clachaig.The factory     
 worked from 1831-1905.                
  In 1944 the land north of the public 
 road was sold to the Forestry         
 Commission.In 1948 the bungalows went 
 up for sale and were sold.
