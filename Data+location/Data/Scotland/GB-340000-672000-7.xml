		<content>{SNOWBALL }- Any number of people can  
 play.One person goes in and turns     
 around and says SNOWBALL.When he or   
 she turns back around you have to stop
 like a statue.If you are caught moving
 you have to go up and put your arm on 
 the wall.Eventually a chain forms and 
 when there is only one person left    
 they try to tig the chain.When they do
 they all try to run back without      
 getting touched.{STOP THE BUS}- Any   
 amount of people can play.Take a piece
 of paper and divide it into five      
 different subjects.Somebody says the  
 alphabet to themselves and then when  
 he or she is told to stop they say the
 letter that they were at and the      
 players have to try and give a word in
 each column beginning with the letter.
 When one person has got all the words 
 they shout {STOP THE BUS!
