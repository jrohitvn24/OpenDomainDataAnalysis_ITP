		<title>15Inverarity Parish Church</title>
		<content> Inverarity Church was built in 1754 on
 the site of earlier churches.It is    
 situated close to the village at a    
 local crossroads and is set in trees. 
 The church is no longer used every    
 week but on a rota with the parishes  
 of Kinnettles and Glamis.Our local    
 minister,the Rev. Sherrard, lives in  
 the parish of Glamis.He is also the   
 school chaplain.                      
 The church and grounds are well looked
 after.The graveyard is of historical  
 interest as it contains many old      
 headstones showing the trade and craft
 symbols of the eighteenth century.
