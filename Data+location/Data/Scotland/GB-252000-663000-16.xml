		<content>   In our area we have one-man-operated
 buses. Some S.P.T.E. services run into
 the city centre, others offer a local 
 service, and the Scottish Bus Group   
 run out to Renfrew and beyond. Buses  
 run to a timetable. Inspectors check  
 the passengers' tickets. Children     
 under 5 years travel free and some    
 buses are adapted to cater for the    
 disabled.                             
   The underground system is known as  
 the Subway. Govan, Ibrox and Cessnock 
 Stations are all in our area, and run 
 to the city centre. In recent years   
 many millions of pounds have been     
 spent modernising this system.        
   British  Rail run a train service   
 from Glasgow Central to Gourock. Our  
 local stations on that line are       
 Hillington East and Cardonald.        
   The M8 motorway serves both inner   
 city and inter-city road users.       </content>
