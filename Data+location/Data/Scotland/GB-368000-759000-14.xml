		<title>14Employment in  Montrose.</title>
		<content> Nationally,{unemployment}is of great  
 concern but the Montrose area has only
{12.8%}of adults without a job. In a   
{survey}taken of 46{Dads}of P6 children
 in{Borrowfield, Montrose,}there was   
 only one who was unemployed. 15 were  
 in{oil related jobs,}6 in the building
 industry, 4 professional men, and 1   
 self employed (shop owner). The       
 remaining 20 included a milkman, a    
 policeman, a car mechanic, lorry      
 driver, and crane driver. There was a 
 total of 21 different jobs for Dads.  
 Out of 45{Mums,}there were 16 types of
 employment including 16 housewives, 8 
 shop assistants, 4 office staff, 3    
 cleaners,and 3 involved with child    
 care. The other 14 ranged from dental 
 assistant, hairdresser to lollipop    
 lady. The high rate of employment in  
 the area would seem to be due to the  
 continued expansion of North Sea Oil. </content>
