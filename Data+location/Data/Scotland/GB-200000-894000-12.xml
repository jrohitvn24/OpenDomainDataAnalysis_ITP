   PEOPLE ON SCORAIG GO TO INVERNESS   
 FOR MOST OF THEIR SHOPPING.MOST HAVE A
 CAR OR VAN BUT SOME SHARE A VEHICLE.  
   IT IS NECESSARY TO CROSS LITTLE LOCH
 BROOM BY BOAT IN ORDER TO DRIVE       
 ANYWHERE.MANY PEOPLE HAVE A SHARE IN  
 THE "MOORING BOAT".THE BOATS ARE POWER
 ED BY OUTBOARD ENGINES SUCH AS YAMAHAS
 OR SEAGULLS.WHEN SOMETHING REALLY     
 LARGE LIKE A TRACTOR HAS TO CROSS THE 
 LOCH TWO BOATS ARE JOINED TOGETHER BY 
 A PLATFORM AND OPERATED CATAMARAN-LIKE
 WITH AN OUTBOARD ON EACH BOAT.        
   PEOPLE GET AROUND MOSTLY BY WALKING.
 SOME GO BY PUSH-BIKE OR MOTORBIKE.    
 TRACTORS WITH TRAILERS,BUCKRAKES OR   
 TRANSPORT BOX ARE ESSENTIAL FOR MOVING
 HEAVY THINGS FROM THE SHORE OR FROM   
 CROFT TO CROFT.THERE IS ALSO A DUMPER 
 TRUCK AND WHEELBARROW FOR THOSE WHO   
 HAVE NEITHER.                         </content>
