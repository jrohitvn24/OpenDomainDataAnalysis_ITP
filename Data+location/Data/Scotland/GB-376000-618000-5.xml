		<title>05THE FARMS AROUND HOWNAM</title>
		<content> The area around the village of Hownam 
 in the Scottish Borders, takes in two 
 complete farms, and some of the ground
 of eight others.They are all upland   
 stock rearing establishments,sheep    
 being the most predominant. The number
 of animals vary throughout the months,
 but during the summer the ground is   
 most heavily stocked, before the years
 young animals are sold. The land will 
 carry 2202  stock sheep,with a further
 2209 lambs from spring time to autumn.
 Also there are 227 stock cattle with  
 224 young animals,some this years     
 calves,and some last years, most of   
 which will be sold before the winter. 
 The majority of stock spend the cold  
 weather outside,both sheep and cattle 
 getting hay to supplement the receding
 grass,and turnips,either eaten in the 
 fields or laid down to them. There are
 no pigs kept,and little grain grown.  </content>
