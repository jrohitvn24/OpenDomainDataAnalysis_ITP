		<title>20  MEG DODS GHOST OF PEEBLES</title>
		<content>   One morning at 10.30 a.m. Margaret  
 Abbot was carrying a crate of milk up 
 the stairs in the{Cross Keys Hotel.   
 In front of her she saw a strange old 
 women climbing the stairs.            
   The lady was small and well built,  
 with grey hair styled in a bun. She   
 wore a black old fashioned skirt,with 
 a cream coloured blouse and on her    
 legs were black woollen stockings.She 
 looked very strange when compared to  
 other woman of our time.              
   When Mrs Abbot asked other members  
 of staff about the unusual lady,she   
 received puzzled looks as the hotel   
 had no female residents.              
   It was then that they realised,she  
 had seen the{ghost of Meg Dods.}      
   Meg  had  been a landlady at the    
 hotel who after she died had continued
 to watch over the place.
