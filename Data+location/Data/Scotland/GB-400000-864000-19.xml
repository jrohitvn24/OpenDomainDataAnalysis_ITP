		<content> Horses and ponies are kept in our     
 patch. They are kept at Philorth Home 
 Farm by the Andersons. In April, l985,
 the Hunter Trial was held at Philorth 
 Farm. They had a prize draw and       
 raised Â£3,700 for cancer relief. There
 are 60 jumps for cross country. You   
 only jump 20 but there has to be jumps
 for all the different groups. The     
 jumping season is between April and   
 September. The Andersons never go into
 town with the horses because the      
 horses don't like the sound of        
 traffic. They have 4 horses and 3     
 ponies. The horses' names are: Talking
 Shop, Jolly Roger, Bob-a-long Ben and 
 Loch Ranza. Talking Shop is 1 year old
 and is l6.3 hands. Loch Ranza is      
 retired and very shy. The horses go in
 for lots of competitions and they are 
 always winning.
