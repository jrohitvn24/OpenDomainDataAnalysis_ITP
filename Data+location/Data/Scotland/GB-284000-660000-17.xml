		<content> The economy of the country is in a    
 low state,due to the international    
 trade situation,and some say,to the   
 government's deflationary policies.   
   The result is unemployment and many 
 families have a low income.In addition
 there are a number of broken families.
 To help in this situation,there are   
 two benefits administered through the 
 schools.                              
{Free school meals}Subject to an income
 examination the children of low income
 families are entitled to free school  
 lunch.In one school 76 children out of
 a roll of 300 receive  free meals.    
{Clothing and footwear grant}          
 Families receiving supplementary      
 income benefits or family income      
 supplement are entitled to such grants
 At present they amount to c.Â£30 per   
 annum per child.
