		<title>05FARMING IN KIP VALLEY</title>
		<content>   There are  eight farms in the area  
 most of which are{PASTORAL,}keeping   
 both beef and dairy cattle and        
 sheep.This is because of the hilly    
 landscape, cloudy, wet climate and the
 proximity of a large town,{Greenock.  
   The farms range in size from 80 Ha  
 to 220Ha, and all are tenants of      
{Ardgowan Estate.                      
   The majority of the farms have no   
 employees and are family businesses.  
   A few of the farms have expanded but
 at least two have lost land in recent 
 years, one to private housing, one to 
{Inverkip Power Station.               
   Farmers find problems being close to
 a large town like Greenock.  Dogs     
 worrying livestock, poachers and      
 vandals damaging the farmers property.
   The general attitude of farmers is, 
 the climate can be too wet, but       
 otherwise conditions are satisfactory.</content>
