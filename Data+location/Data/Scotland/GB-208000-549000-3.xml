      In our village there is a Tennis 
 Club and a Bowling Club. In the winter
 months the bowlers meet in the School 
 Hall to play Carpet Bowls and the more
 active villagers play Badminton. The  
 village is blessed with a good beach  
 to which comes a small family firm of 
 showpeople in the summer.             
     The Tigh-na-mara Hotel provides   
 entertainment and Discos as well as   
 having a Pool table. One of the two   
 village shops has an Amusement Arcade 
 with One-armed Bandits, Space Invaders
 , Juke Boxes, and a Pool table.       
     During the winter months the      
 School Hall is used most Friday       
 evenings for Whist Drives, Concerts,  
 and Social Functions, which raise     
 funds for a variety of organisations  
 and charities supported by the        
 community.                            </content>
