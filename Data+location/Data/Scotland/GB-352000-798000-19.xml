		<title>19Local News In Aboyne</title>
		<content> The{Media}in Aboyne consists of the   
 two local{newspapers}_ "The Deesider" 
 and the "Piper".  These are both      
 distributed free around the area and  
 carry most of the{local news}as well  
 as other features of local interest.  
 Both newspapers carry a timetable of  
 Deeside{events}for the coming month as
 both are published monthly.  "The     
 Deesider" is the more established     
 publication, "The Piper" only being   
 about a year old, but because it      
 publishes photographs it is just as   
 widely read as the less well printed  
 "Deesider".  Also widely read are the 
 two Aberdeen journals _ "The Press and
 Journal" and "The Evening Express".   
 These are two 'sister' newspapers that
 carry worldwide news as well as news  
 and articles more exclusive to the    
 Aboyne Area.                          
                                       </content>
