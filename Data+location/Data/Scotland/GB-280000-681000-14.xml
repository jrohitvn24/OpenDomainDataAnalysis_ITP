		<content> Keeping law and order is very         
 important in Denny and Dunipace. To   
 help we have a{Police Station}manned  
 by an Inspector, 5 sergeants and 22   
 constables. The station has a lock-up 
 cell, a detention cell and an         
 interview room. These cells are only  
 used to give offenders time to cool   
 off. Real law breakers are dealt with 
 at the{Sheriff Court in Falkirk.}In   
 the past, police officers have gone   
 round their district in patrol cars   
 but, starting in July l985, a system  
 will come into operation in certain   
 areas. In an effort to enlist the help
 of the public to try to combat crime a
{Community Constable}will be assigned  
 to police a specific area. His duties 
 will be to become more involved in the
 community where he works. Flexible    
 hours will enable him to come into    
 greater contact with the public.      </content>
