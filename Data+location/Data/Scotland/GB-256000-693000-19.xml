		<title>19THE BARON OF BUCHLYVIE</title>
		<content>{THE BARON OF BUCHLYVIE}was the name   
 given to a famous CLYDESDALE          
 STALLION owned by William McKeish of  
 WOODEND FARM, BUCHLYVIE.The horse was 
 foaled in{1900}and in{1902}was sold   
 to Messrs. Kilpatrick and Dunbar of   
 ABERDEEN. The BARON of BUCHLYVIE was  
 to become sire to many prize winning  
 horses which were exported to every   
 corner of the world. His two joint    
 owners each claimed sole rights to the
 horse until, as the result of a       
 lawsuit, he was finally sold for the  
 sum of{9500 guineas}(the highest      
 price ever paid for a farm horse) at  
 AYR in December,{1911}and the money   
 divided between the two protagonists. 
 In{1913}his leg was broken by a mare  
 and the famous BARON OF BUCHLYVIE had 
 to be destroyed. The skeleton of this 
 fine animal can be seen today in{THE  
{KELVINGROVE MUSEUM, GLASGOW.}         </content>
