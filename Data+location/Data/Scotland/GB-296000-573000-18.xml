		<title>18The Pizzeria, Dumfries</title>
		<content> On Thursday 6th June, Catherine and I 
 went to The Pizzeria to interview     
 Mr.Farnocchia. We went in the morning 
 since they wouldn't be so busy. We    
 asked him what kind of food and wine  
 he sold. He told us about the pizzas  
 that were popular and not so popular. 
 The pizza that wasn't popular was the 
 Capri. All the wines were popular.    
 They order their wine every three     
 months from different companies. The  
 most popular wine is Monticarlo wine; 
 they have eight hundred bottles of    
 wine.                                 
    They get most of their customers at
 the weekend when they only have       
 evening meals. It's mostly parents    
 that go to the Pizzeria. If children  
 do go they can get soft drinks if they
 like.They sell 10-20 bottles of wine a
 day. They always keep their lights    
 dim, it looks nice and cosy.          </content>
