		<content>{POLICE IN BETTYHILL }Our area is the  
 centre of the local police            
 organisation. The section based here  
 covers an area larger than            
 Lanarkshire. We interviewed the man in
 charge to see what the problems of    
 rural policing were. We learned that  
 the section covered four police beats 
 from Reay to Melvich  Bettyhill and   
 Tongue. The police Sgt. has been based
 here for 9 years and is amazed at the 
 number of people from various parts of
 Britain who come to our area to commit
 suicide. In 1976 he was involved in   
 invesigations into the mysterious     
 puma. Despite being on patrol at all  
 times of the day and night he never   
 saw it but many people claimed to have
 seen it. He is also responsible for   
 the emergency procedure associated    
 with Dounreay Atomic Station and would
 respond in event of an accident there.</content>
