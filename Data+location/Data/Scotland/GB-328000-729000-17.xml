		<title>17LONGFORGAN - CASTLE HUNTLY</title>
		<content> From the top of the castle is a nice  
 view and at the bottom of the castle  
 are the dungeons. My father is a      
 prison officer and he has to guard the
 Borstal boys in case they run away. I 
 play with my friends on our bikes and 
 we go up to and around the castle. At 
 night people say there is a "White    
 Lady" who haunts the castle. It is    
 interesting inside the castle, we call
 the boys inmates and they go out      
 digging tatties and play soccer on the
 pitch at the back of the castle. Every
 year they have a sportsday. I play    
 with my friends and we go along by the
 workshops on our bikes and then up the
 hill to the castle where we can hear  
 bats squeaking, and it is said that   
 footsteps can be heard coming from the
 roof of the castle. My Dad often works
 at night and comes home at 7.00 am to 
 sleep for part of the day.            </content>
