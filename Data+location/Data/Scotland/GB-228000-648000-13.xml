 Palladius school.   Four{doctors}and a

{Dentist.}  About 20 people work there.
 The Centre opens at 8.00am and closes 
 at7.30pm.  There are two waiting      
 rooms, offices and consulting rooms.  
 At a regular baby clinic, babies are  
 checked for hearing, sight and weight 
 and given injections against polio,   
 measles, whooping cough etc.  There is
 a Cervical Smear Service for early    
 detection of cancer in women.         
 Preventative medicine and general     
 health care are important parts of the
 sevice.                               
 The Centre is modern and efficient,   
 but some people feel that it lacks the
 intimacy of the old Doctors' surgeries</content>
