		<title>17SOCIAL CONCERNS IN BALFRON</title>
		<content>    Balfron is well supplied with{shops
 of all types,compared to other places,
 though there are fewer shops than     
 there were twenty years ago. Vans tour
 the village providing fish, meat,     
 green-groceries and dairy produce. The
{trades}are well represented with      
 3 garages, 2 joiners, painters and    
 decorators, window-cleaners, builders 
 and an ambulance service with four    
 ambulances and seven drivers.         
    Illustrating the{community spirit} 
 of the people of Balfron, are the bus 
 drivers who organise and fund outings 
 for the old people every year.        
    Many of those interviewed thought  
 that the village lacked{sports        
{facilities}like tennis courts, squash 
 courts, a golf course and pool, while 
 others felt that too many changes     
 would spoil the rural character and   
 atmosphere of Balfron.                </content>
