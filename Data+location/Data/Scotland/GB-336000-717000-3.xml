		<title>03FARMING..PITBLADDO FARM</title>
		<content> Pitbladdo farm is situated North-West 
 of Cupar. The farm house is built on  
 the site of an old castle and many of 
 the original stones have been         
 incorporated into the house. The name 
 Pitbladdo comes from the Gaelic and   
 apparently meant a piece of land where
 oats are grown.                       
  Originally the land was part of a    
 large estate which incorporated most  
 of the valley. Tithes have always been
 paid to the local church -originally  
 these were paid in the form of bowls  
 of produce, now the owners of the farm
 pay Â£7 per year. This entitles the    
 family to free wedding and free       
 funeral services and their own pew in 
 the church. The estate was broken up  
 last century and Pitbladdo is now     
 owned by the Stewart family who farmed
 it as a limited company.
