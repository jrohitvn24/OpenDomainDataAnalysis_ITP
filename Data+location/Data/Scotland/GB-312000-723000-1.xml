		<title>01AN OVERVIEW</title>
		<content> Our area is mainly farming and        
 residential,with a fairly large amount
 of woodland.It is a beautiful area    
 with lovely walks by the river,and up 
 Kinnoull Hill.Tay Street is a pleasant
 19th Century lime tree shaded street  
 over looking the River Tay.Most people
 here are very grateful for the        
 beautiful environment they live in.The
 recreational facilities in this area  
 are excellent with lots of open space 
 for the citizens to enjoy.            
 In the middle ages Perth was a busy   
 port with ships coming right up the   
 Tay to the foot of the High Street.   
 Nowadays heavy traffic crosses the    
 Tay at the two bridges as all traffic 
 between the south and the busy north  
 east of Scotland must cross the Tay   
 at Perth.
