		<title>08POLLOK  IN THE PAST GLASGOW</title>
		<content> Most of the original tenants of       
 Pollok refer to the sedate            
 countryside atmosphere of pre-war     
 Pollok and how the estate blended well
 into the surrounding Pollok Country   
 Estate -the grounds of Pollok House.  
 The residents, on the whole, saw      
 Pollok as a lovely place to live in   
 those days. The houses themselves     
 contained amenities which were lacking
 in the older slums of Govan and the   
 Gorbals:  inside toilet, bath,        
 cupboard space and gardens. Many of   
 the tenants became keen gardeners with
 large gardens to practice their       
 skills.                               
 If any complaint was made regarding   
 the estate it was in relation to the  
 lack of adequate shopping and         
 transport facilities, but the quality 
 of houses were seen as making up for  
 this shortage.                        </content>
