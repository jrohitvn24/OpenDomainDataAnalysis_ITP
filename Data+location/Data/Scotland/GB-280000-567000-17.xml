		<title>17The Roman Bridge</title>
		<content> Around half way between Springholm and
 Haugh of Urr lies an old historical   
 bridge believed to be built by the    
 Romans. Known as Barr Bridge, it is   
 situated on an old drove road which   
 used to exist between The Hermitage   
 and West Glenarm. (The road still     
 exists in rough condition, from West  
 Glenarm, through East Glenarm and     
 eventually out to the Old Military    
 Road south of Milton). Water still    
 flows underneath its stone arch, from 
 Spottes Burn. One side of the bridge  
 is deteriorating badly. The stone from
 which the bridge was built is shale.  
 Considering its age it is in good     
 condition. The bridge's span is 57ft  
 across. Its width from side to side is
 11ft also. Apparently the Roman Bridge
 had walls on each side but now there  
 is no trace of them.
