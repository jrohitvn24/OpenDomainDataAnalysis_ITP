		<title>02Local History-2 GUILDRY INC.</title>
		<content> The Guildry Incorporation of Perth - a
 Mediaeval Trades' Society - once owned
 the whole of our area and still       
 administer most of the land and farms 
 around here. They built this village  
 about 1820.                           
 Every year on the first Wednesday in  
 June, the members of the Guildry led  
 by the Dean of Guild visit and inspect
 their properties. They always pay a   
 courtesy visit to the School where    
 they are entertained. After this and  
 refreshments there is the "Scramble". 
 This is when the Dean throws bags of  
 new money (loose, of course!) to each 
 class group in turn. It is great fun  
 for us children, but our Headteacher, 
 Miss Reid does not like it as she says
 it is degrading. But it is a part of  
 our history and she is going to let it
 continue as long as we behave and not 
 grab other people's money from them.  </content>
