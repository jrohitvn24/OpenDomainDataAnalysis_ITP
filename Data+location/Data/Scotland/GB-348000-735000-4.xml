		<content> Each of the villages is served by     
 shops, one in each village, which     
 supply the day to day necessities and 
 also are Post Offices. They are also  
 focal points for the villages and     
 especially the surrounding areas,     
 places for meeting people, for        
 conversation and for catching up with 
 the local news. Both sell newspapers  
 and neither is licensed.              
   Wellbank is served by a Public      
 House, the Wellbank Arms. It is owned 
 locally, which is the trend in Angus, 
 and has a large function room, which  
 caters for wedding receptions and many
 of the Dinners, Dances and Balls of   
 our local organisations. Newbigging is
 not blessed with a Public House; its  
 inhabitants much travel at least 2 km 
 to quench their thirsts. A recent     
 proposal to build a Public House was  
 met with almost total resistance.     </content>
