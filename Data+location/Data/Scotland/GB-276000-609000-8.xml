		<title>08The Riding of the Marches</title>
		<content> Sanquhar's annual civic festival, "The
 Riding of the Marches", is based on an
 historically relevant function. The   
 "Marches" are the town's boundaries,  
 and in days gone by they had to be    
 inspected annually by the Magistrates 
 and Councillors, accompanied by all   
 horse owners. This was to ensure that 
 there had been no encroachment on the 
 town's boundaries, and that all lands 
 and dykes were in good order. This    
 ancient and essential inspection on   
 horseback now forms the basis of a    
 ceremony which takes place around 18th
 August each year. Exiled Sanquharians 
 try to visit the town during the week 
 -long celebrations. Today's activities
 were revived in 1910, but both World  
 Wars intervened. Since 1947 the events
 have taken place annually, except 1952
 when they had to be cancelled due to  
 an outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease.</content>
