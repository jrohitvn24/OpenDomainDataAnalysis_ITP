		<title>19Social Concerns in the '80s</title>
		<content> Today's pace of life is so fast that  
 many people have turned to drink,drugs
 and glue sniffing. This, coupled with 
 lack of{employment}creates many {     
{social concerns.}Sometimes all that   
 people need is a place to go where    
 someone will understand their problem.
 The Gateway Exchange is a place where 
 people can go for support. The person 
 who started Gateway was in prison with
 his own problems and, when he got out,
 he realised how hard it is to cope.   
 The centre provides a wide variety of 
 activities such as group meetings,{   
{arts and crafts.}The people who run   
 Gateway are volunteers. It is financed
 by donations and the organisers have  
 refused government aid as they want a 
 free hand in how it is run. People's{ 
{attitudes}to Gateway are mostly good  
 as there is a need for support for    
 people with problems.                 </content>
