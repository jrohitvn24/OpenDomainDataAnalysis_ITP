		<title>06TYPICAL DAY IN LIFE OF CHILD</title>
		<content> I get up at 8 o'clock and do some     
 exercises until quarter past. Then I  
 have my breakfast and go to school.   
 School starts and 9 o'clock and stops 
 for lunch at half past twelve. I      
 normallu go home for lunch. My school 
 is only a few hundred meters away from
 my home  so I have plenty of time. At 
 twenty five to two the bell rings and 
 shool is in until twenty past three. I
 go home and get changed to play with  
 my pals. We normally play at the      
 grassy piece of land near my home.    
  Later it is time for tea. At about   
 a quarter past six I play in          
 my bedroom then watch television.     
 After supper I go to bed and the light
 goes off about quarter past nine.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
