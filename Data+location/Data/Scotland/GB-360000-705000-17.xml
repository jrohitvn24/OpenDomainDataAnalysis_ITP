		<content> Crail Summer Fair run by the Community
 Council during August is a great      
 attraction for summer visitors with   
 flags decroating the streets and a    
 Pipe band. A Convenor appointed early,
 has to deal with booking              
 entertainments and halls, car parking,
 printing and publicity. There are     
 competitions, games and stalls selling
 local produce.  After the Fair Queen  
 has opened the Fair, The Radio Road   
 Show takes over. There is a Pet show  
 and large raffle.  Proceeds from the  
 stalls are divided equally between the
 organisations running them and the    
 Community Council, who use the money  
 to provide extra amenities fro the    
 Burgh.  The weather is always a worry,
 of course,with the chance of a last   
 minute cancellation, but each year is 
 always better than the previous one.
