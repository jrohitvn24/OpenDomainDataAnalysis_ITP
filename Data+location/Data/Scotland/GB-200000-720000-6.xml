		<title>06FARM DOGS</title>
		<content>  My dad is a farmer. He has working   
 dogs. They are sheep dogs, one is a   
 "Beardie".                            
  All the farms in this area are sheep 
 and hill cattle farms and all the     
 farmers need dogs to help control     
 their stock.                          
  The dogs are trained from they are   
 pups. They live outdoors or in a shed 
 all their working lives. They are not 
 pets and they are not allowed inside  
 the house.                            
  My dad controls the dogs with his    
 voice. When he "gathers", he rounds up
 the sheep or cattle. The dogs control 
 where the sheep move. The sheep are   
 gathered for shearing, dipping,       
 counting,and for market.              
  One of our best dogs disappeared last
 autumn. My dad was very sad because he
 had lost a good worker.
