		<title>01KIRKCONNEL,Dumfries-shire</title>
		<content> Kirkconnel lies astride the A76 in the
 North-west corner of Dumfries-shire.  
 A one-time thriving coal-mining       
 community it is now a much neglected  
 back-water....hardly noticed by the   
 passing traffic on this, the main     
 route south from the industrial       
 heart-land of neighbouring Ayrshire to
 Carlisle and beyond.The passengers    
 viewing the beautiful{Upper-Nithsdale}
 scenery as they speed by in the       
 comfort of B.R.Inter-city railway     
 carriages heading for London,Glasgow  
 or the Stranraer to Larne ferry will  
 hardly even notice their brief stop at
 Kirkconnel's single platform station. 
                                       
 Kirkconnel's hey-days have long gone  
 but the people's hopes are ever alive,
 ready for the time when employment may
 again be available to the many and not
 the few as it is today.               </content>
