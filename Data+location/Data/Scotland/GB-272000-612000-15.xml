		<title>15Kirkconnel:Children's Games</title>
		<content> Our inquiries show that few of the    
 traditional street games are played.  
 The seasonal playing of marbles       
 (bools),the usual hide 'n seek        
 and chasing seem to have survived.    
 A game called Hunts is perhaps a      
 variation on an older game. Two teams 
 take part. The hunted run to hide. The
 Hunters give chase and when they      
 catch their prey he/she is taken to   
 the den from which he/she may be      
 rescued.                              
 Kick the Can is a variation of Hide'n 
 Seek and involves the 'sought' trying 
 to return to the den before being     
 caught, and kicking a can placed there
 thus showing that he has returned and 
 freeing anyone who may have been      
 caught.                               
 Perhaps television is responsible for 
 this situation or the level of        
 sophistication of modern-day toys.    </content>
