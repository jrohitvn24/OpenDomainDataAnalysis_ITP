 I got up at 7.30 a.m. in the morning  
 and got my breakfast which was tea and
 toast. Then I went outside to the shed
 to feed my pet guinea-pigs and rabbit.
 I watched television until 8.30 a.m.  
 then I caught the bus for school. I   
 did Maths and Bible Study, then I went
 out to play. I bought a packet of     
 crisps at the tuck-shop. After break I
 did English and Project work until    
 lunch at 12.30. For lunch I had egg   
 and chips and a glass of orange juice.
 After lunch I played chasing with my  
 friends. In the afternoon I did a note
 to my penfriend in Sweden. Then I did 
 a book review and after break I went  
 to the gym for games. School shut at  
 3.45 p.m. and I went home and did my  
 homework and watched television. After
 supper I went to the swimming pool    
 then went to bed at 9.30 p.m.         </content>
