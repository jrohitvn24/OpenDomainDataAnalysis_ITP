		<content> This section of coastline is a raised 
 beach and former sea levels can be    
 seen in cliffs and caves.  Major land 
 use is rough grazing on the hill, the 
 lower lying coastal strip devoted to  
 intensive grazing sheep or fattening  
 beef cattle.  The hill areas are      
 moorland-heather, deer grass, fescue  
 and bracken with peat as substrate.   
 Fertile areas are resown wirh sandy   
 substrate.  There is one major sandy  
 beach of the area-a major tourist     
 attraction.  A large caravan park, car
 park, swing park and cafe/restaurant  
 with seasonal childrens funfair and   
 trampolines is situated behind the    
 beach and residental development has  
 sprung up with people working in Oban 
 2 miles away.  The small village of   
 Dunbeg to the east has a population of
 approx. 800 and has a general store   
 and post office.                      </content>
