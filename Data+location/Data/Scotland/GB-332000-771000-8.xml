		<content>                                       
  On Friday 21st June 29 people from   
 the Glen went to the Blair Drummond   
 Safari Park for the school trip.It    
 took us 3 hours to get there but it   
 was worth waiting for! There were     
 lions,tigers,camels,monkeys,buffaloes 
 etc.The first thing I did was to go on
 the big astraglide .It was great!It   
 was blue and red and there were big   
 bumps that you slid over.Then I went  
 on a little automatic space buggy.    
 There was a cafe nearby so we popped  
 in and had something to eat.Then we   
 went to see some sealions.They        
 balanced balls and performed lots     
 of difficult tricks.The next thing I  
 went to see was a huge cinema.After   
 that we went shopping in the Thistle  
 Centre in Stirling.We left Stirling at
 6pm and arrived home at 8:35pm.
