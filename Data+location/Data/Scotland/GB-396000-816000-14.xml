		<title>14TRAFFIC IN BALMEDIE</title>
		<content> Over a period of two days our group   
 did a traffic survey at the main road,
 the A92 which goes through Balmedie.  
 We spent 15 minutes each day counting 
 the total number of cars etc. which   
 passed us in either direction. We also
 took the registration number of each  
 car to see where the traffic was      
 coming from. We found on average for a
 15 minute period                      
 cars = 232 buses= 2                   
 lorries = 27 motor bikes = 4. This    
 means 11.7 vehicles passed us every   
 minute which is approx. one every 10  
 seconds. This shows just how busy the 
 main road is, and how much we need a  
 crossing. From our work with the car  
 numbers we found the traffic came from
 Aberdeen 56%, Glasgow 6%, Keith 5%,   
 Edinburgh 4%, Huddersfield 3%, London 
 3%, the remaining 23% came from all   
 over the country.                     </content>
