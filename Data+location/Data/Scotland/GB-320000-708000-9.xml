		<title>09Industry in Strathmiglo</title>
		<content> During the 1950's and 1960's nylon and
 polyester became popular.The machinery
 used to make linen couldn't weave     
 nylon so the industry fell away and   
 finally closed down.In 1964 the Irvine
 Thread Co. took over the premises and 
 kept some of the work-force to make   
 cotton threads.About 5 years ago the  
 firm became commission embroiderers,  
 designing and embroidering badges for 
 clubs(golf,cricket,bowling,etc.)and   
 other organisations eg.The Bank Of    
 Scotland(A friend for life).The       
 biggest order the firm has ever had   
 was for 160,000 items.A new order has 
 just been placed,which will not be    
 finished until next March (March,1986)
 for more than 200,000 items.At present
 the firm employs 14 people,2 men and  
 12 women.
