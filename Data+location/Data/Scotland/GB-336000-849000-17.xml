 Glentauchers Distillery lies about    
 three miles from Keith on the road    
 to Mulben.  It was built in 1897,     
 close to the Railway Line between     
 Aberdeen and Inverness, and close also
 to a plentiful supply of water        
 suitable for the production of        
 whiskey.                              
 The water comes from springs in the   
 nearby hills and is collected in dams 
 south of the road to Keith.           
 Malting began in May 1898.  Brewing   
 began in the following month.         
 Glentauchers Distillery was closed    
 during the Second World War years due 
 to restrictions on the supply of      
 barley.  It re_opened in 1946.  Last  
 year, because of the recession in the 
 Whisky Market, Glentauchers was again 
 closed, or rather, mothballed, until  
 demand for whisky increases again.    </content>
