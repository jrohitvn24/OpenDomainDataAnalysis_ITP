		<content> The first edition of the South Deeside
 Review was printed in Blairs College  
 in 1981. Copies of the 12-page booklet
 are now distributed free to 876 homes 
 in the area. There are two co-editors 
 and five people responsible for the   
 gathering of material. It has carried 
 articles on local history, literary   
 contributions as well as news from    
 schools in the locality, given        
 publicity for events such as the      
 raising of money for a hall where     
 organisations might meet. It has      
 helped formulate public attitudes     
 towards the provision of sheltered    
 housing, and the prevention of        
 quarrying operations which would have 
 been detrimental to the amenity of the
 neighbourhood.  It is now printed in  
 Aberdeen.
