		<content>   Dunfermline has lost a large amount 
 of farmland recently due to the       
 building of new houses.  These houses 
 are usually built with brick and      
 breeze block compared with the        
 Victorian stone houses in the older   
 parts of the town.  Also, it takes    
 very little time to build these modern
 houses because of mechanisation and   
 prefabrication.                       
    People in Dunfermline expect more  
 from their houses nowadays.  They     
 expect them to be spacious and        
 attractive on the outside as well as  
 the inside.                           
    There is a lot of sheltered housing
 being built in Dunfermline.  These are
 flats for the elderly or disabled.    
 There is usually a warden available in
 case of difficulties.
