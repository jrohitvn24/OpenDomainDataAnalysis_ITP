		<title>03Shopping in Irvine.</title>
		<content>   In the past few years,{shopping}has 
 changed very much. Shopping has become
 easier. Now there are self service    
 shops unlike the old ones with an     
 assistant. Now most of the shops are  
 under cover. The{Mall}and the{Forum   
 have these shops all under one roof.  
 The shops have become bigger and sell 
 many new things that would not have   
 been available in Irvine before. New  
 shops have been built and they make   
 the towns and villages bigger. They   
 sell things from food to plastic      
 hardware, from plates and cups made of
 china to pets and animals.{Car parks  
 are provided beside the shopping      
 centre and one of these is also under 
 cover. On a wet day it is possible to 
 go by car and buy all the week's      
 shopping without stepping outside and 
 getting wet.
