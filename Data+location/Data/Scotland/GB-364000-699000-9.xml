		<title>09The Lighthouse</title>
		<content> In 1814 the island was bought by the  
 Commissioners of the Northern         
 Lighthouse Board and has remained     
 their property ever since. The Board  
 erected a new Stevenson Lighthouse to 
 replace the original coal beacon. The 
 stationary oil light in this was      
 replaced by a revolving shutter in    
 1843. In the same year a second       
 lighthouse was built on the east coast
 of the island, known as the "low      
 light". These lights operated until   
 the North Carr Lightship was installed
 at the end of the century and the low 
 light has since been converted into a 
 bird observatory. In 1886 the main    
 lighthouse was electrified and the dam
 erected to provide power. However, the
 electric light caused damage to       
 migrant birds and in 1924 it was      
 changed back to paraffin. Despite the 
 lighthoses there were still wrecks.   </content>
