 School finishes at 3.30pm. In between 
 that time we have a morning interval  
 lasting 15 minutes,three-quarters of  
 an hour for lunch and an afternoon    
 interval which also lasts for 15      
 minutes.                              
 There are 32 pupils in our school and 
 2 permanent teachers. We don't have a 
 uniform,but we always try to wear     
 sensible clothing. We are taught      
 Mathematics,Language Arts,Expressive  
 Arts,Environmental Studies and

 is Miss Lowe,but we also have four    
 visiting specialist teachers. They    
 take us for Art,Gymnastics,Recorder

 minister takes a morning assembly once
 a week. We have Reading homework 4    
 nights a week and sometimes we have
