		<content> The {Maritime Museum }is a new museum 
 which opened in summer 1985.It is     
 located near the harbour in a         
 triagular shaped building on the site 
 of the old shipyard.                  
 It is very popular because it has many
 exhibits of boats which the public can
 inspect.                              
 The museum owns the former Irvine     
 Harbour Company tug{"GARNOCK"}and the 
 historic coaster{"KYLES"}built in     
 Paisley in 1872.                      
 As well as a large collection of      
 shipbuilding and engineering machine  
 tools,a steady stream of items e.g.   
 anchors,work plates,old photographs   
 and documents have been added.        
 At the museum, interested {volunteers 
 are woking on the boats to return them
 to their former glory.
