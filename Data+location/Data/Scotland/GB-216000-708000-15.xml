		<title>15The Fish Farm 1</title>
		<content>  In the fish farm there are 400 000   
 fish and they are salmon,rainbow trout
 brown trout and turbot.Loch Fyne is   
 a good spot to have cages because it  
 is a clean deep loch.The fish just now
 are worth Â£1\ million but they are    
 increasing every day by 2 or 3 percent
 in value.                             
  In the hatchery there are 35 tanks   
 and they are all full of fish.There   
 are also 65 cages in Loch Fyne.The    
 fish get moved from small tanks to    
 bigger tanks as they get bigger.      
  A computer works the feeding and     
 controls the temperature.Herring meal 
 with added vitamins is used to feed   
 the fish.The meal is bought in from a 
 fish factory.The fish go through 1\   
 tons of food a day but that amount    
 also increases every day by 2 or 3    
 percent.                              
                                       </content>
