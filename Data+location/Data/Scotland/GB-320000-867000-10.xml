		<title>10SUNBANK PARK LOSSIEMOUTH</title>
		<content>   Sunbank Park used to be a quarry. In
 March 1972 the council started talking
 about rehabilitating the quarry and   
 turning it into a park. In June 1974  
 work began. Altogether the total cost 
 for building the park was seventy-four
 thousand pounds. The park was opened  
 to the public on 2nd of May, 1975. It 
 comprises 2 ponds, a lake and a       
 parking area. Most of the ground is   
 covered with stones which makes it    
 almost impossible for grass to grow.  
   We questioned people living in our  
 area about Sunbank Park. To the public
 Sunbank is not safe and quite a few   
 people said the ponds should be       
 drained. Most think it is too close to
 the main road, especially as there are
 no pavements. It was felt that it     
 would be used a lot more if it was    
 better signposted.
