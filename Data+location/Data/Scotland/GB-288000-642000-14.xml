		<content>{Transport}is of major importance to   
 the people of Lanark.{Roads }are the  
 main key to the prosperity of Lanark  
 over the centuries and still play an  
 important role today.The A.73. passes 
 through the town from Cumbernauld and 
 Airdrie and links up with the A.74    
 (the main western road for Scotland)  
 at Abington.As {Communications }have  
 always been important is not          
 surprising that there has been some   
 debate as to wether there should be a 
 ring road or a new road driven throgh 
 the town.{Rail}links have also been   
 important,but due to missed           
 opportunities in the last century     
 Lanark never became a major hub of the
 rail system. The town used to have a  
 link to Edinburgh and to Ayr;only the 
 link to Glasgow survives.The Glasgow  
 service is very well patronized.
