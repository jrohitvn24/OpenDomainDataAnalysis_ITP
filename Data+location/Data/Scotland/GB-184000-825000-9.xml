		<title>09LOCAL DISTRICT COUNCILLOR</title>
		<content> Mr.J.F.Munro is the Local District    
 Councillor as well as being a business
 man.He serves on the Skye and Lochalsh
 District Council which has its centre 
 in Portree and has a population within
 the boundaries of 10000 people.One of 
 the major problems faced by the       
 District Council is the lack of       
 housing to rent. There are 400 people 
 on the waiting list yet many of the   
 houses in the area are let for holiday
 homes.Mr Munro would like to see      
 more local people involved in local   
 activities such as crofting and       
 agriculture.He felt that the land     
 ownership system prevented this.He    
 also feels that small workshops would 
 be desirable and would create in      
 Lochalsh the active community which   
 once was there.
