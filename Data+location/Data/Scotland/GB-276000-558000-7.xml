		<title>07GELSTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The present school was built in 1931-2
 and consists of two classrooms,       
 staff-room, toilets and a storage     
 cupboard.                             
 Meals are prepared and served in the  
 building which was the old school, and
 the dining-room is also used as a     
 general purposes room.                
 There are thirty three children on the
 roll and two teachers.                
 There are visiting teachers of art,   
 physical education and music, and     
 chldren have the opportunity to learn 
 to play the violin.                   
 The children participate in a number  
 of extra-curricular activities, such  
 as swimming, sailing and orienteering.
   This year a store-room is to be     
 added to the school, and with the roll
 next session expected to be forty,    
 the school's future would seem to be  
 assured.                              </content>
