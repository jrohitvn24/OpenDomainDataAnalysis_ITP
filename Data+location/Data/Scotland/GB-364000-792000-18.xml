		<title>18STRACHAN PARENTS' WORRIES</title>
		<content>{SAFETY }Parents are worried about the 
 school playground.The tarmacked ground
 in front of the school is small and   
 sloping.Accidents occur easily. There 
 is a grassy area around the canteen   
 ideal for swings,climbing apparatus   
 and sand pit.However,the lower part is
 bounded by a low wall dropping about  
 2 to 3 metres to the lane behind the  
 school. They worry also about the     
 traffic using this lane.Supervision is
 difficult with only 2 teachers.       
{HEATING /HEALTH }The old boiler is    
 dusty and inefficient.During cold     
 weather temperatures of 45F.OFTEN     
 occur.The dust aggravates coughs and  
 allergic tendencies.                  
                                       
 Representations to Grampian Region    
 have been made. Lack of money hinders 
 immediate reparation.
