		<title>10HEALTH IN GREENOCK</title>
		<content> The general {health} of the people of 
 this area is not very good.  They     
 should improve their diet and exercise
 more often.  They should also cut down
 on smoking, drinking alcohol and stop 
 using drugs and solvents.             
 The most common{diseases}are dental   
 decay and the common cold.            
 The{infant mortality rate}in this area
 is 12.3 per 1000.  This can be        
 compared with the figure for Scotland 
 as a whole which is 9.9 per 1000.     
 Not all children are{immunised}at the 
 right age.  School children have      
 medical checks at the ages of 5 and   
 14.  The school nurse visits weekly to
 keep a regular check on the children. 
 There are no doctors' surgeries in    
 this area, so people have to go the { 
{health centre} which is in the centre 
 of the town.                          
                                       </content>
