		<title>12Lambing time on a croft</title>
		<content> The lambing starts around the middle  
 of April and we go round the sheep to 
 see if they need any help in lambing, 
 and see if the sheep will take the    
 lamb. When the lambs are all born they
 are marked so we know if they are male
 or female.Then we shed them and them  
 we wean them. After that we sell some 
 of the male lambs and in the summer   
 time we shear them and in November we 
 dip them so they won't get scabs or   
 ticks.                                
 If a lamb dies the crofter finds anoth
 er lamb for the sheep.He will skin the
 dead lamb and put the skin on the     
 living new lamb.After a few days the  
 skin is removed and the sheep takes to
 the lamb as if it were her own lamb.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
