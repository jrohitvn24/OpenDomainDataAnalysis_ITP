		<content>   In Govan, there has been continious 
 worship longer than any other place in
 Britain.  Previously the{Druids}      
 worshipped here.  Over the centuries, 
 the worship has been Celtic,{Roman    
{Catholic,}Anglican and{Presbyterian   
 and Govan Old Parish Church, built on 
 a historic site contains many ancient 
 stones, one with the sun on one side  
 and the cross on the other.           
   The last century brought many Irish 
 here in search of work.  They were    
 mostly{Roman Catholic}and today there 
 are several{R.C.}parishes within the  
 area, such as St. Constatine's.       
   The{Iona Community,}a worldwide     
 ecumenical Christian organisation     
 concerned with peace and justice has  
 its H.Q. at the Pearce Institute in   
 Govan. There are small numbers of     
 other faiths including Mormons,       
 Muslims and Hindus living in the area.</content>
