		<title>06A DAY AT THE RACES,TWEEDBANK</title>
		<content>  On the 5th of June the{MINI OLYMPICS 
 were held at{TWEEDBANK}stadium.The    
 track was opened in{1984.}It has 8    
 lanes which are 400 metres long.The   
 track is made of rubber which is red. 
 In the middle of the track there are  
 two long jumps,a water jump,high      
 jump,hurdles,shotputt and 60 metres,  
 150 metres and 300 metres flat race.  
 There is a stand on the outside of the
 track.It has a roof on it.When you    
 come into the track grounds there are 
 toilets and changing rooms.The events 
 which take place at the stadium are   
 attended by competitors from all over 
 the{BORDERS}and{SCOTLAND.}When I was  
 running on the track,at the Mini      
 Olympics it felt as if you were in the
 air.I think we are very lucky to have 
 a track because important people run  
 on tracks like ours for the real      
 Olympics.An exciting day at the track!</content>
