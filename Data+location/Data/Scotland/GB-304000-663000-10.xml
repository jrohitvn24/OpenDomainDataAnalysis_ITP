		<title>10LIVINGSTON RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> Residents of the{Murieston}area       
 collected a 1000 signature petition to
 help gain approval for a railway      
 station in{Murieston South,           
{Livingston.}People of the{Carmondean  
 area thought that it would be better  
 built in the north of Livingston. The 
 go-ahead was given in 1979 to build   
 the station in Murieston. Livingston  
 Development Corporation gave Â£338,000 
 and the{European Development Fund}gave
 Â£71,000. The station was built ahead  
 of schedule and was opened on 06.10.84
 six months early. Between 200-250     
 people commute daily to{Edinburgh}and 
{Glasgow.}The trains run every hour.   
 There are ramps to enable disabled    
 people to use the station. Also at the
 station is a loud speaker system      
 connected to Glasgow and Edinburgh    
 stations.
