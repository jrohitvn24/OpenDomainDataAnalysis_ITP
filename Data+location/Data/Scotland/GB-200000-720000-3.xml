		<title>03KILCHRENAN PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Kilchrenan School is over one hundred 
 years old. It is one of the oldest    
 buildings in the community,which is   
 still being used.                     
 The school has only one classroom,    
 one teacher and seven pupils. Pupils  
 from primary one to primary seven     
 are educated in the school.           
  The oldest lady in Kilchrenan can    
 remember when there  were thirty five 
 pupils but changes in employment have 
 made many families move away from     
 Kilchrenan and surrounding areas.     
  The school consists of an old        
 building, which is the classroom and a
 new extension with an entrance hall,  
 storeroom and toilets.                
  Although Kilchrenan School is small  
 it has a computer, a television,      
 a disc drive, a piano, a printer, a   
 microscope, and many other educational
 aids.                                 </content>
