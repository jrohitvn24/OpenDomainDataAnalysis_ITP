		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF COLIN</title>
		<content> I get up at 7am, have my breakfast and
 get dressed. I live at Tealing but go 
 to Linlathen High School in Dundee.   
 Some children in the area go to Forfar
 Academy. I leave the house at 8am and 
 cycle about 2 miles to the main road. 
 I leave my bike at a local garage and 
 wait for the bus to come from Forfar. 
 I get on the service bus at 8.30am.   
 The fare would normally cost me 25p   
 but I have a bus pass so it costs me  
 nothing. At school I study English,   
 Mathematics, Geography, Biology,      
 Chemistry, Physics and Technical      
 Drawing. I stay at school for my lunch
 although I used to go home. I get the 
 bus from school at 4.15pm and cycle   
 home from the garage.                 
 At night I usually go down to the     
 village and have a game of football. I
 belong to the local Scout Troop which 
 meets once a week.                    </content>
