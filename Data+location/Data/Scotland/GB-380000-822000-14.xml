		<title>14Seasons in Bourtie/Keithall</title>
		<content> Much land in bourtie and              
 Keithall/Kinkell lies above 500 feet  
 and weather conditions follow a       
 similar outline on extremes. Farmers  
 have to use the seasons to their      
 advantage.  Most ploughing is carried 
 out in Autumn, immediately after      
 harvest, when winter grain is sown.   
 From mid-Novemer most of the high     
 ground is permanently white and the   
 only operation which can be carried   
 out is much sprading (platterring     
 liquid manure) on ground which may    
 grow grass or be ploughed the         
 following season. Around mid-april the
 weather is open enough to bring out   
 cattle, but often spring seed is not  
 sown until May when the land is       
 farmer.  After hay and silage are cut 
 in June, sheep and cattle are moved   
 into the cut fields from earlier      
 pastures.                             </content>
