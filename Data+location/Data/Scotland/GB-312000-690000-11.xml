		<title>11Shops around Hill of Beath</title>
		<content> In Hill of Beath there are very few   
 shops.In the Main Street there is one 
 general grocers which also sells      
 newspapers and is run by Pakistanis.  
 This shop also acts as a postoffice   
 .In the housing scheme there are      
 another two general grocers.In the    
 part of Cowdenbeath which was in our  
 block there were two more post        
 offices, one chipshop,one hairdressers
 ,two general grocers ,one Coop,two    
 pubs and a social club.There are no   
 clothing shops, banks, shoe shops ,   
 cafes or furniture shops.For these we 
 would have to travel to Cowdenbeath or
 Dunfermline.A mobile fish shop comes  
 every week from the fishing village   
 of Pittenween.Other travelling shops  
 include a mobile video shop, a        
 butcher's van, a grocery van and a    
 travelling chip shop.
