   The houses in our block are         
 predominantly farmhouses and cottages 
 some of which are no longer part of   
 the farms but are privately owned.    
   One such cottage is {NORFOLK COTTAGE
  -formerly Kelwood Cottage.On one wall
 of this you can find the {NORFOLK     
{COAT-OF-ARMS}since the Duke of Norfolk
 owned much of the land in this area.  
   A modern house in this area-{PLACE  
{OF CRAIGS}-is built on the site of a  
 Peel Tower.In the 13th Century several
 Peel Towers were built in this area to
 protect families living in the area by
 giving early warning of enemy attack. 
 Where Place of Craigs is now built a  
 large stone,perhaps the corner stone  
 has been uncovered as well as a paved 
 area which may have been the floor of 
 the Peel Towers.
