		<content> MOST PEOPLE IN THIS AREA SHOP IN      
 GREENOCK TOWN CENTRE WHICH HAS A      
 VARIETY OF LARGE SHOPS AND            
 SUPERMARKETS. PEOPLE SOMETIMES TRAVEL 
 TO GLASGOW TO SHOP.GOUROCK SHOPPING   
 CENTRE HAS MANY SMALL SHOPS WHICH     
 PROVIDE A GOOD SERVICE BUT LACK       
 VARIETY AND CHOICE. MANY PEOPLE NOW   
 BUY IN BULK AT A 'HYPERMARKET' TO SAVE
 MONEY AND SHOPPING TRIPS.THESE ARE    
 OUTWITH THE AREA AND PEOPLE TRAVEL BY 
 CAR TO THEM.MANY WOULD LIKE TO SEE A  
 LARGE SUPERMARKET IN GOUROCK TO SAVE  
 TRAVELLING. PRICES IN MOST SHOPS TODAY
 ARE VERY COMPETITIVE.
