		<title>06BEEF PRODUCTION - DOLPHINTON</title>
		<content> Dolphinton is categorised as a less   
 favoured area. Few pure-bred cattle   
 are kept, most beef cows being crosses
 of beef and dairy cattle.             
 "Continental" bulls are used, eg.     
 Charolais, Simmental and Linousin.    
 Calves are generally born in Spring   
 and suckle their mothers for about 9  
 months. Cows/calves are kept at grass 
 till November, and are housed for the 
 winter, either in straw-bedded or     
 slatted sheds. Winter feed is mainly  
 home-grown silage and barley, with hay
 and roots used on a few farms. Some   
 calves are sold at 1 year old to be   
 fattened mainly in E. Lothian or      
 Aberdeenshire, and some are fattened  
 on the farm of origin. Values Â£300 and
 Â£500 resp. Main problems with calves  
 are worm infestation and pneumonias,  
 controlled by anthelmintic and        
 antibiotic drugs resp.                </content>
