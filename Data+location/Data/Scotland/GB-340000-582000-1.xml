		<title>01Moorland East of Langholm</title>
		<content> There are only two major land uses in 
 the area. Coniferous forest in the    
 south east and moorland used as rough 
 grazing for sheep.  The sheep are     
 only brought down to the small fields 
 near the farm for lambing, clipping,  
 dipping and in the winter if the      
 weather is very bad.                  
 Some of the forest was newly planted, 
 but most was planted about 8 years    
 ago. One noticeble stream flows past  
 Petreburn to join the Tarras river    
 just west of this area. There are no  
 industry, amenities and communictions 
 is one unmetalled road. There is one  
 farm in the area which makes its      
 living from sheep.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
