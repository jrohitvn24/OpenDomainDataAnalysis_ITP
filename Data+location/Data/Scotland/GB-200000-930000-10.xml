		<title>10MAKING A LIVING</title>
		<content>   My dad is a very busy man. He has a 
 herd of cattle, 21 cows and several   
 calves at the moment. In the winter   
 we all help to feed the cows because  
 there is little grass growing. I      
 sometimes drive the tractor when we   
 take the hay down to the park. In the 
 summer we do not feed them as there is
 plenty grass. About six weeks ago the 
 cows were put out to summer grazing at
{Ardvar,}21km. from our house.The only 
 cow left in the park at{Clashmore}is  
 Blondie, our pet.                     
   My dad also does jobs for other     
 people. He builds houses, walls, roads
 and he does plumbing and all sorts of 
 things.He built our house and it is   
 lovely. When he needs materials he    
 travels to{Inverness}to collect them  
 with his lorry. My younger brother    
 Mark usually works with my dad but he 
 will be starting school in August.    </content>
