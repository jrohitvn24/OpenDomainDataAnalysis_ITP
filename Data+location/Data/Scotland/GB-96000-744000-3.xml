		<content> During the second world war Tiree     
 airport was used.                     
  There were a lot of huts on the      
 runway and everywhere else.           
  There was a secret tunnel behind Ben 
 Hough.                                
  On the old runway on Tiree you can   
 find the old runway lights. Most of   
 them are broken. My grandad Harry did 
 some of the electrical wiring at the  
 airport. The airport is not far from  
 where I live and it is good fun trying
 to find out what kind of planes land  
 here. Normally DHT planes land here.
