		<title>03Tourist Attractions.</title>
		<content> The main tourist attractions in our   
 area are the scenery,St.Mary's Church,
 Grantully Castle and the River Tay.   
{The Tay}is also a great attraction for
 canoeists.They have huts at Grandtully
 Bridge and so this is the main spot   
 you will see them.                    
{Grantully Castle}is also quite famous 
 but only the grounds of the castle are
 open to the public once a year.The    
 castle itself is never open to the    
 public.                               
{St.Mary's Church}is an old and very   
 small church.The main attraction to it
 is that it has a painted ceiling which
 is very rare in this country.         
 Our area is also very good for hill   
 walking. Most of our hills are covered
 in trees or moorland or rough         
 grassland.
