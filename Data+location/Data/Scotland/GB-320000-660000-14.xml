		<title>14KIRKHILL CEMETRY, PENICUIK</title>
		<content> It was built in{1884}and the          
 house                                 
 for the caretaker added in{1888.}We   
 estimated that there were between{300 
{to 400 graves.}Several ex-provosts of 
 Penicuik have been buried here.       
 The largest grave is erected in memory
 of the{Cowan Family,}who were mill    
 owners.There are a number for{soldiers
{killed in World War 1,}mostly killed  
 in France, and all very young boys.   
 The most interesting grave is the one 
 erected after the{Mauricewood Pit     
{Disaster of 1889,}with the names of 3 
 teenage boys,{Thomas Foster,Mitchell  
{Hamilton and Robert Tolmie}who died   
 attempting to warn the miners of the  
 fire danger.                          
 On our visit we sketched the more     
 unusual designs of headstone and      
 interviewed the{cemetry caretaker.
