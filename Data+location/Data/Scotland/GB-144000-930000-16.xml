		<content> I interviewed{Miss Mackenzie}about    
 her shopping.Miss Mackenzie shops at  
{Prestos}and{Woolworth}for food, and   
 at Tommy Nicolsons for her papers and 
 Pat Macfarlane for presents. She uses 
 Kenny Macdonalds for chemistry needs  
 and Charles Macleod for meats and the 
 Grillburger for froozen foods.She uses
 these shops because they are quite    
 conveniant and also because they are  
 well supplied and frozen foods are    
 handy. She has access to car parks    
 from the shops and that is good       
 because she needs to buy a lot as it  
 has to last a week.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
