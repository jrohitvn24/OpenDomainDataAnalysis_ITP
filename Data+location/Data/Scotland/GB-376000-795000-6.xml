		<title>06Road Traffic in Durris</title>
		<content> Our block has mostly back roads which 
 have little traffic.The only main road
 is the South Deeside road to          
 Aberdeen.It is very busy in the       
 morning and again in the evening.This 
 is because people from Banchory are   
 going to and from their work in       
 Aberdeen.A lot of tractors use the    
 roads.We don't have buses on our roads
 except for a limited service on the   
 main road,plus the school bus.Cars on 
 the roads belong to local people or   
 others out for a drive in the country.
 We get a lot of timber lorries and    
 others carrying sand.You can't get    
 past lorries on the road.Our roads are
 sometimes blocked in winter because of
 heavy snow and the snowploughs take a 
 while to get round to us.Many local   
 people get around on bikes,especially 
 the children,even though the roads are
 hilly.                                </content>
