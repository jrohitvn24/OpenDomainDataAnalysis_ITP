		<content> It is common in this area for farmers 
 to keep both cattle and sheep.Mr Black
 of Newton of Collessie has a total of 
 300 heifers and freisians. He does not
 have a dairy unit but provides the    
 calves for elsewhere.The introduction 
 of milk quotas in 1983 (when          
 production was cut by 10% on the      
 previous years figures) not only      
 affected dairy farms but others like  
 this one.                             
 100{SUFFOLK}sheep are also on this    
 farm. They are part of the farmer's   
 livelihood but also a hobby. This     
 breed is easily shepherded and a good 
 meat producer, providing some 75-80%  
 of all home produced lamb and mutton. 
 There are 30 breeders in Fife and Mr  
 Black has had the champion Suffolk and
 supreme sheep in the local            
 agricultural shows. A top class lamb  
 can fetch up to Â£8000.                </content>
