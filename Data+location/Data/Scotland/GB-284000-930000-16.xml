		<title>16Wildlife Around Kinbrace</title>
		<content> Kinbrace is a very interesting place  
 for wildlife. It has several small    
 areas of afforestation,a river and    
 also a mixture of moorlands and       
 man-made fields. There are two        
 specially common species. One is the  
 red grouse and the other is the red   
 deer. These are both shot at certain  
 times of the year by both landowners  
 and game keepers. We have             
 oystercatchers, golden plovers,       
 lapwings,curlews,dippers,hawks,herons 
 and buzzards  and one might even see  
 an eagle soaring on high! Also in our 
 area are foxes,hares,rabbits and      
 wildcats. The latter are now becoming 
 very rare in Scotland. We see adders  
 and grass snakes. Weasels,stoats and  
 hedgehogs are fairly common. And      
 sometimes if you are lucky you might  
 see an otter swimming up the river.
