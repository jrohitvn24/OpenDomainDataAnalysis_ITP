<title>32Carnock Village</title>
<content>

Carnock has 928 residents. Carnock pupils carried out a survey and found that 8% of parents work in the West Fife villages, 60% work within Fife and 32% outwith Fife. The village has a church and a hostelry ‘Carnock Inn’ but there is no police station, garage or local shops, as the last shop closed in 2010. Many new houses have been built – 45 in Queens Haugh, 5 on Main Street and 8 at Carnock Mill. 1 more is being built on Main Street and a new development is planned off West Park.   &lt;br />
