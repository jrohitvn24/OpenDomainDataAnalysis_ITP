		<content> Gordon Highlander's Regimental HQ &amp;   
 museum.                               
 The Gordon Highlander's museum is in  
 the grounds of the Regimental HQ in   
 Viewfield Road. The original building 
 was erected in 1850 as a farmhouse in 
 the grounds of Kepplehills estate. The
 famous artist, Sir George Reid, bought
 the house, which is now a listed      
 building, in 1900 and added a studio  
 which is now the museum. The regiment,
 whose motto is "Bydand"(meaning Stand 
 Fast)was raised in 1794 and has had a 
 distinguished career in many parts of 
 the world gaining many honours        
 including several VCs. In the museum  
 is a hand loom,made by a prisoner of  
 war, which can produce kilts. The     
 battalion, whose Colonel in Chief is  
 H.R.H. The Prince of Wales, is at     
 present garrisoned at Honer in West   
 Germany.                              </content>
