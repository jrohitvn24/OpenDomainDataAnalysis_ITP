		<content> Most people work in Elgin but some    
 work at Miltonduff Distillery and some
 at home.The different occupations     
 include cooks,brewers,workers in      
 education,a doctor and of course      
 housewives.                           
 Most people travel to work by car     
 although some local people cycle or   
 walk.                                 
 A questionaire found that people in   
 general enjoy their work and living in
 the country does not interfere with   
 their jobs.                           
 Some people keep the same job for a   
 long time.For example Forestry workers
 tend either to leave after a short    
 time or to stay for most of their     
 working lives.Other people have had up
 to eight different jobs,although most 
 find their work rewarding.
