		<content>{GALA DAY }For years our Gala Day has  
 been celebrated annually in early     
 summer,the exact day depending on the 
 tides because the Seton Queen sails by
 fishing boat from Cockenzie Harbour to
 Port Seton Harbour.Gala characters are
 on lorries and are driven to the local
 park where the Crowning Ceremony takes
 place.                                
{THE BOX MEETING}linked with a         
 fishermens walk began about           
 1870.Fishermen's subscriptions went   
 into a box with two locks and if at   
 any time some one was hurt or ill some
 assistance from the box would help    
 them.After the Box Meeting an old boat
 was burned on the rocks by the        
 entrance to Shore Bay The box was     
 carried in procession by the Box      
 Master and another Office-bearer..
