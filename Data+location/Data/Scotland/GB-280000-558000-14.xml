		<content> Buittle Church is the Church of       
 Scotland church for Buittle Parish.It 
 is now linked with neighbouring Kelton
 and joined with St.Andrews in Castle  
 Douglas.All are under the charge of   
 one minister.There is now a service on
 2 Sundays a month. The congregational 
 roll is about 210 although it is      
 thought that parishioners who have    
 moved have not"lifted their lines"    
 (this is what joining another church  
 is called) and the actual roll is     
 about 130. Approximately 30-40 attend 
 church regularly.
