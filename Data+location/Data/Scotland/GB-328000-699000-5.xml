		<content> Bellfield Farm is a big farm,         
 Consisting mostly of cultivated       
 fields,grasslands and rough grazing.  
 The farm has a private water supply   
 which holds 6000 gallons.The water is 
 largely needed for the 120 fresian    
 cattle which are kept on the farm.They
 drink about 6 gallons of water each   
 day,but in return give 6 to 8 gallons 
 of milk.In addition to the cattle     
 mentioned there are 2 bulls on the    
 farm and a horse called Pinker who was
 ten years old. There are 6 workers on 
 the farm.Three of them are members of 
 the family which owns the farm and    
 three come from the outside.They live 
 with their families in cottages near  
 the farm.On Harbour Hill to the north 
 of the farm some test boring for coal 
 has taken place recently.
