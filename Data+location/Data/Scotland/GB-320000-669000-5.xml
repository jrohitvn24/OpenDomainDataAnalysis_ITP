		<title>05UNION CANAL CONT.</title>
		<content>  The canal was 31.5 miles long, 5 feet
 deep and 37 feet wide at the surface  
 and it could take boats 69 feet by    
 12.5 feet.                            
  The main purpose of the canal was to 
 carry needed supplies of cheap coal,  
 lime and also bark and raw hides.     
  The canal was closed in 1965 and is  
 now used for fishing and one can walk 
 or jog along the paths beside it. It  
 is also used for rowing and canoeing, 
 and could be an attractive            
 recreational site if it was cleaned   
 up. Unfortunately in places (         
 especially adjacent to the old        
 industrial sites ) the water is dirty,
 covered in slime, and has a lot of    
 waste material dumped along the banks.
 The canal represents an area of the   
 Green Belt which stretches from the   
 the suburbs into the inner city area  
 of Edinburgh.                         </content>
