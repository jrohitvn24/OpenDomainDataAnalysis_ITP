		<title>13HYDRO ELECTRICITY-TEANASSIE</title>
		<content> The main reason why there are many    
 dams in our area is that the land is  
 so mountainous.The clouds are forced  
 to rise over the mountains and the air
 cools down and rain falls.The water   
 is allowed through the dams and it    
 powers turbines which drive generators
 to make electricity.Two children have 
 fathers who work at the dams.There    
 are 6 dams on the Rivers Glass and    
 Beauly.Hydro Electricity is useful    
 because it is one of the cheapest     
 kinds of electricity to make.         
 AIGAS DAM-Aigas Dam on the River      
 Beauly is well known for its fish pass
 which is open to the public.You can   
 clearly see male and female salmon    
 going through the pass.The young      
 salmon are about 7cm long,they are    
 called parr.After about 2 years the   
 parr are about 15cm long-they         
 are called smolts.                    </content>
