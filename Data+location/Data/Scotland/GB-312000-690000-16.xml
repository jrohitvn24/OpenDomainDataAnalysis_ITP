		<title>16Keirsbeath opencast mining</title>
		<content> On the outskirts of Hill of Beath     
 there is an opencast mining works     
 owned  by French Keir.They scrape off 
 the top soil off the ground then they 
 dig down with an excavator till they  
 hit a coal seam.If they hit hard rock 
 they will use high explosives to blast
 the rock away.All the earth they dig  
 up is piled up to make a kind of      
 hill so the dust does not blow onto   
 the houses surrounding the            
 opencast.Lots of people including my  
 family complain about how much        
 explosive is used because of          
 the dust and noise.Tractor Shovels    
 Company have been working on the      
 opencast since 1984.The opencast      
 recently hit a coal seam in June      
 1985.When they have finished, the area
 will be made into a park.
