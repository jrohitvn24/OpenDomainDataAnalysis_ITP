		<content> Main A850 road goes through this area.
  Recently upgraded and a new two lane 
 section built replacing old single    
 track.  Number of small townships.    
 Land is set out in regular shaped     
 plots called crofts, many with a      
 modern house.  Two old houses - one   
 uninhabited.  Lyndale house is        
 surrounded by fairly fertile farmland 
 (for Skye) and supports a large sheep 
 population.  Much of the area is rough
 grazing, moorland and peat cuttings - 
 ie areas where peat turfs are cut and 
 then dried for winter fuel.  both of  
 the older houses are surrounded by    
 woodland.  Loch Snizort Beag lies to  
 the east.  Grounds of Lyndale House   
 often used as a clay pigeon shoot.    
 Working adults rely on more than one  
 occupation - crofting (farming) being 
 the secondary. Much Bed &amp; Breakfast   
 occupation in the summer for visitors.</content>
