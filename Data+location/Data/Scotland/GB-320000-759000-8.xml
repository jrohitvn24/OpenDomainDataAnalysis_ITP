		<title>08Employment in Glenisla.</title>
		<content> Glenisla is open countryside and the  
 biggest job provider is  farming.     
 Our area contains six farms providing 
 the livelihood for six families. Few  
 of these farmers employ full-time     
 workers but do make use of seasonal   
 workers at busy times, such as during 
 the sping at lambing time. Forestry is
 not done on a large scale and provides
 very few job opportunities. Only one  
 person in the Glen is employed        
 full-time with the Forestry           
 Commission. Most of the work done in  
 this field is done by people living   
 outwith Glenisla. The two hotels in   
 the Glen provide the opportunity for  
 full-time and part-time employment.   
 Jobs included in this are waiting     
 tables, bar staff, cooking staff,     
 cleaning staff and gardeners.Most of  
 these employees are local though not  
 always.                               </content>
