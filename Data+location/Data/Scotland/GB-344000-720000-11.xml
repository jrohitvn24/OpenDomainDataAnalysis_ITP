		<title>11IMPACT OF RAF LEUCHARS</title>
		<content> The Royal Air Force base in Leuchars  
 village plays a major role in         
 supplying a great deal of employment  
 to the district. In May 1985 the base 
 employed approximatly 1,400 men and   
 women, their average age being 32. The
 base plays a substantial part in the  
 defence of the United Kingdom.        
 Obviously one of the major problems   
 for the community is the noise level. 
 About 3 years ago the Fife Regional   
 Council  gave a grant to house-holders
 in the direct vicinity of the base to 
 supply their houses with double       
 -glazing. Of the 9 people that we     
 inteviewed, only 2 were bothered with 
 the noise, these people having young  
 babies. Another problem for           
 house-holders and the RAF's property  
 is the structural damage that the     
 noise from the aircraft causes, eg    
 cracked walls and dislodged roof tiles</content>
