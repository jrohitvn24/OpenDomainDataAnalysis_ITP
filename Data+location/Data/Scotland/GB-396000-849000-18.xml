		<title>18PITFOUR ESTATE</title>
		<content>    Part of the former Pitfour Estate  
 lies in our block, although the site  
 of the mansion house and the lake     
 outside the block's southern border.  
 There are several existing features,  
 however, which are of interest.       
    One of the most interesting of all 
 is that of a Recumbent Stone Circle   
 which lies in the south western area  
 of the block, Drinnie's Wood.  The    
 stones are set on a bank surrounded by
 vast pine trees. The west flanker,    
 recumbent and two other stones are in 
 place, three having fallen.  The      
 recumbent is ten and a quarter feet   
 long, four feet high and weighs       
 approximately twelve tons.  The       
 recumbent is south_west of the        
 circumference.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
