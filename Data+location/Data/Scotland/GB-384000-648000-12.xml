		<content> THE ONLY PEOLE WHO COME TO OUR BLOCK, 
 OTHER THAN IN EMERGENCIES, ARE THE    
 DISTRICT NURSE AND HEALTH VISITOR.    
 THEY COME FROM DUNS WHICH IS ABOUT 14 
 KM AWAY.                              
                                       
 THERE IS A GERIATRIC HOSPITAL IN DUNS,
 OTHERWISE WE HAVE TO GO TO PEEL,      
 EDINBURGH, BERWICK OR ASHINGTON.   IF 
 BABIES ARE BORN IN EDINBURGH          
 THEY ARE SCOTTISH AND IF THEY ARE BORN
 IN BERWICK OR ASHINGTON THEY ARE      
 ENGLISH.   THE DOCTORS ARE AT DUNS,   
 CHIRNSIDE AND NORHAM.  THE DENTISTS   
 ARE AT BERWICK, COLDSTREAM OR DUNS.   
                                       
 DUNS IS 7 MILES AWAY AND BERWICK 10   
 MILES AWAY, SO WE HAVE TO TRAVEL QUITE
 FAR, FOR CLINICS, ETC..               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
