		<title>13TILHILL FORESTRY.</title>
		<content>  Tilhill is the 2nd biggest forestry  
 group in our area. They are very      
 similar to the E.F.G.(Economic        
 Forestry Group) in the way that they  
 look after the land for private       
 owners. The Tilhill Group manage about
 116 hectares in our area. Only 100    
 hectares of this land is used for     
 planting (85%).                       
  Their job is to give advice to the   
 owners and if the owners accept this  
 the work is carried out.They plant the
 trees about 2 metres apart which is   
 about 4 sq.metres to every tree.      
  The main danger in this area is the  
 risk of fire because of the rubbish   
 dump close by the forest. They also   
 have problems with beetles which live 
 in the bark of felled trees and they  
 attack young trees. Deer can also     
 prove to be troublesome.
