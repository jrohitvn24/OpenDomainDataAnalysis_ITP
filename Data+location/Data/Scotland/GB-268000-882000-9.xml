		<content> One of the main industies in Edderton 
 is{sheep farming.}The main breeds of  
 sheep are North Country Cheviots and  
 Blackface.ln spring the lambs are     
 born. When the lambs are 12 weeks old 
 they are{vaccinated}against diseases. 
 The shepherd has to check the flock   
 regularly when the lambs are young to 
 make sure everything is alright.In the
 summer the sheep are{sheared}and their
 wool is sold to the nearest wool      
 market. After that there is a special 
 symbol painted on to its skin so that 
 the shepherd knows which sheep belong 
 to him when they mix with other flocks
 on the hills.Then they are{dipped}to  
 protect them from harmful insects.In  
 autumn young lambs are{sold}at the    
 local market and the sheep are dipped 
 again.In winter the shepherd has to   
{check}on the sheep and{feed}them      
 daily.A shepherd's life is a hard one.</content>
