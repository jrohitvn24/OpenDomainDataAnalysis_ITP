		<content> Assynt is well known for its rich and 
 varied ecological environment         
 bordering on a Nature Reserve. Some of
 the things it is possible to find are 
 Sea Otters in the bay, Golden Eagles  
 and Peregrine Falcons round our       
 mountains, Wild-cats and Badgers in   
 our woods. Mountain Aven, Oyster      
 Plants, the Guelden Rose and many     
 different orchids are all to be found 
 growing here. Our Rivers &amp; Lochs have 
 Salmon &amp; Sea and Brown Trout in them. 
 The Minch boasts a rich &amp; varied      
 Fishing ground. Our Hills support the 
 Red &amp; Sika Deer. Although it is an    
 ecological wonderland, there are      
 problems arising with pollution &amp;     
 human greed. The Salmon have been     
 over-fished &amp; our shoreline polluted. 
 There is shortly to be a survey into  
 possible acid-rain contamination of   
 our Lochs &amp; Woods.                    </content>
