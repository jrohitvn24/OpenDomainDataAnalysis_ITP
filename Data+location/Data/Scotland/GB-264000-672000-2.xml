		<content> 1.Most of the shopping and commercial 
 area of the town is concentrated      
 around the one main street called     
 Cowgate and Townhead which runs       
 through the centre of the town.       
                                       
 2.Forth and Clyde canal               
     This was the first canal built in 
 Scotland.It traverses the centre of   
 the town at right angles to the main  
 street.In the past Kirkintilloch was  
 an important staging point on the     
 canal for traffic between Edinburgh   
 and Glasgow.                          
                                       
 3.Auld Kirk Museum                    
    Dating from 1644 this former       
 church,(legend has it that Mary Queen 
 of Scots worshipped there and possibly
 Bonnie Prince Charlie),is now a museum
 of the town.
