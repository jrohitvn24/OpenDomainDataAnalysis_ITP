		<title>18Snowstorm - Spring 1985</title>
		<content> In the early hours of 22nd January I  
 awoke and found we had no light! It   
 was still dark but through the snow   
 packed window I could see lots of snow
 drifts in the moonlight. In the       
 morning I went with Dad to dig out the
 snowplough. We cleared 200 metres and 
 stuck. It was three days before we got
 one road open! On all the roads the   
 electricity poles were down or leaning
 over and the wires hanging and through
 the nights it still snowed. Many sheep
 froze to death .The gamekeepers used  
 Argos to bring groceries to outlying  
 homes. Through the long nights we     
 played games by the light of the      
 tilley lamp. Most people cooked on    
 camping stoves. Electricity was       
 switched on after five days but the   
 surrounding areas were nine days      
 without power.
