		<title>05Torridon Crofts</title>
		<content> The crofts were good ground,but have  
 not been cultivated for several       
 years.They are rented from{The        
{National Trust for Scotland}.They run 
 in strips from the road to the sea so 
 that each croft has its share of the  
 good land and access to the shore. The
 dry stone walls along the road side   
 are still in good condition and have  
 strands of wire on top to keep the red
 deer out. there is one crofter with   
 sheep; the others do not keep any     
 animals.Most sheep stay on the low    
 ground near the shore, sometimes they 
 are allowed up on the hill, but there 
 is{no common grazing}.Sheep eat       
 seaweed as well as grass and foliage. 
 They are mostly{black face and cheviot
 with some cross.The lambs and sheep   
 are taken to market at Dingwall,about 
 60 miles away, or Inverness,80 miles  
 away.Transport(by floats)is expensive.</content>
