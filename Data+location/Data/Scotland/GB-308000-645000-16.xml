		<title>16A DOLPHINTON HOUSEWIFE</title>
		<content> My home life is quite routine. I am   
 married with a teenage son and        
 daughter. My day starts around 6am    
 when I awake the family, prepare      
 breakfast of fruit juice and porridge 
 or cereal with milk, followed by bacon
 and egg and/or toast. After they hace 
 all gone out to work, I wash the      
 dishes, switch on the washing machine,
 and tidy the house. Then I walk to the
 local shop to collect the daily       
 newspaper and the bread. When I return
 I prepare a midday snack for my son.  
 who works on a nearby farm. I also    
 work as a prt-tinme clerkess with a   
 local haulage firm, two days a week. I
 like garening and house plants, and we
 have a greenhouse which takes up a lot
 of our spare time. We have a Jack     
 Russell dog which I take out for a    
 walk evert day. I enjoy knitting and I
 am a member of the W.R.I.             </content>
