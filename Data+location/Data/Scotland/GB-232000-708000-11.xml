		<title>11Wild life in Inversnaid</title>
		<content> Apart from the usual large mammals,   
 red and roe deer,foxes and            
 badgers,there are several family      
 groups of{feral goats}on the East side
 of Loch Lomond.{Wild cats}are becoming
 more plentiful with the increasing    
 amount of forestry being planted in   
 the vicinity.                         
  More than 100 species of bird have   
 been noted in the area. Loch Lomond   
 running N-S is regularly used by      
 seasonal migrating birds on their     
 passage to and from their breeding    
 grounds. Many summer visitors nest in 
 the area. Of the resident birds the   
{golden eagle}is the most notable.     
  A local guide book lists 13 species  
 of fish in the local lochs. Of these  
 the{powan,}found only in Loch Lomond  
 and Loch Eck is worth a mention. It is
 a fresh water form of herring,isolated
 from the sea during the Ice-age.      </content>
