		<title>02FISHING WITH THE "CONTEST"</title>
		<content>  The boat leaves the pier and steams  
 for sometimes 4 hours before getting  
 to the fishing grounds.Then they turn 
 on the meter that tells them if there 
 are fish in the area , what depth the 
 sea is and whether the sea-bed is     
 rocky or not.Then they throw out the  
 rope and buoy shooting the net fixed  
 to the rope while steaming in a circle
 .When they return to the buoy it and  
 the rope end are taken aboard. The    
 boat then steams for maybe 4 hours    
 before'heaving',pulling in the net.The
 net ropes are winched in using the    
 power block when they get to the net. 
 The net is swung aboard by the derrick
 lowered through a hatch in the shelter
 deck and then the fish emptied aboard 
 by opening the end of the net. While  
 the net is shot again the fish aboard 
 is gutted,washed,sorted,iced and boxed
 .Fish may be landed Tuesday and Friday</content>
