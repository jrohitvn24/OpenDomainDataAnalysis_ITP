		<content> Several sports are played in the      
 primary school. Some of these are     
 football, netball, rugby, hockey,     
 volleyball, badminton, potted sports  
 and running. The younger children in  
 school do not play all of these but   
 the older children play all of them.  
 The favourite sports among the        
 youngest classes are football and     
 chasing, the middle classes like      
 running games and hockey, and the     
 oldest children prefer badminton,     
 hockey and ball games. Most sports are
 played outside when the weather is    
 fine. We play on the two football     
 pitches and the all weather blaze     
 pitch opposite the school. In wet     
 weather games are played in the       
 primary school hall and the 2         
 gymnasiums in the secondary school.
