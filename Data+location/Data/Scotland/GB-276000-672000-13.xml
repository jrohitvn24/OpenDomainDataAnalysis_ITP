		<title>13CUMBERNAULD TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> PEOPLE MAINLY TRAVEL IN AND OUT OF    
 CUMBERNAULD BY BUS, CAR OR TRAIN. THE 
 ROADS IN CUMBERNAULD ARE VERY GOOD AND
 MANY PEOPLE HAVE CARS. OUR LOCAL BUSES
 ARE QUITE GOOD THEY TAKE WORKERS TO   
 THE INDUSTRIAL ESTATES OR PEOPLE TO   
 THE SHOPS. THERE IS A GOOD BUS SERVICE
 TO TOWNS ROUND ABOUT LIKE KILSYTH,    
 STIRLING AND GLASGOW. A BUS CAN ALSO  
 TAKE YOU TO THE HOSPITAL AT AIRDRIE.  
 MOST OF THE BUSES BELONG TO           
 ALEXANDERS(MIDLAND) AND THEY ARE      
 BLUE.IN THE SUMMER THERE ARE DAILY BUS
 TOURS TO BLACKPOOL, EDINBURGH AND LOTS
 OF OTHER PLACES. THE RAILWAY STATION  
 IS SMALL.MOST TRAINS GO TO GLASGOW BUT
 YOU HAVE TO CHANGE AT SPRINGBURN. YOU 
 CANT GET A TRAIN GOING TO             
 EDINBUGH.OUTSIDE THE STATION YOU CAN  
 GET A TAXI OR A LOCAL BUS TO TAKE YOU 
 WHERE YOU WANT TO GO AFTER LEAVING THE
 TRAIN.                                </content>
