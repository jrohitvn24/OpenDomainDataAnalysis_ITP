		<title>01ALVES AREA</title>
		<content> The area we have been assigned to     
 study is based round the small rural  
 village of Alves on the A96 between   
 Elgin and Forres.                     
 The main industry is farming as the   
 land is very fertile and excellent for
 growing crops although many cattle and
 sheep are raised.                     
 About one twelth of the area is       
 covered by woodland,the rest by       
 farmland,the largest farming concern  
 being Moray Estates.                  
 Most of the areas amenites and public 
 services are situated in the village  
 some of these being a Post Office,Take
 Away,Petrol Station,School and a small
 Pub.Approximately a mile north of the 
 village is a pleasent well equipped   
 Caravan site. Half a mile west of the 
 village stands Alves Church.          
                                       
                                       </content>
