		<title>04BIRDS OF PREY</title>
		<content>  In Strathnairn there are quite a lot 
 of birds of prey.{There are the golden
{eagle,buzzard,sparrowhawk,osprey,     
{peregrine falcon,kestrel,barn owl,long
{eared owl and the short eared owl}    
 nesting in our area. {                
{Golden Eagle                          
  The Golden Eagle eats grouse,hares,  
 rabbits and is known to kill young    
 deer.                                 
  The female lays two eggs one white   
 one and the other one has heavy brown 
 blotches on it.There is a eyrie on the
 hill south east of the school.        
  The Golden Eagle is now becoming     
 rare because farmers spray chemicals  
 on crops then little birds come along 
 and eat the corn.The Golden Eagle and 
 other birds of prey eat the birds then
 the poison builds up inside them and  
 they die.We wish that it was possible 
 to protect crops without harming birds</content>
