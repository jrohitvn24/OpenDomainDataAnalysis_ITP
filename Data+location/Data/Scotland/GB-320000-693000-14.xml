		<content> John Thomson lived in Cardenden and   
 loved playing football. He was a local
 hero when he kept goal for Wellesley, 
 junior football club.                 
                                       
 In 1926, a scout for Glasgow Celtic   
 came to Fife to watch a goal keeper   
 who was playing for Dunbeath. The     
 scout soon forgot the man he came to  
 see when he spied the acrobatic       
 Thomson in the opposite goal. He      
 immediatly saw John and asked him to  
 play for Glasgow Celtic.              
                                       
 Old Celtic players still recall the   
 arrival of John Thomson in Glasgow. A 
 shy, fresh faced boy of 17, in long   
 blue coat and huge cap. He at once    
 became a favorite with the players, so
 friendly was his manner so eager was  
 he to learn his craft. John soon made 
 his mark in the Celtic team (cont.)   </content>
