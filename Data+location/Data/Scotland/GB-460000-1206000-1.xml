		<title>01Our Area - A General View</title>
		<content>  This block contains mostly hill land,
 surrounding the sea inlet of Balta    
 Sound and containing most of the      
 settlement of{ Baltasound.}The housing
 is scattered apart from three Council 
 estates and a small private estate for
 pilots at the airport. Most land is   
 used for crofting, mostly sheep       
 grazing with some rearing of Shetland 
 ponies, as well as the growing of     
 potatoes, cabbage, turnips and grass  
 for hay. The main feature of the area 
 is the{Airport}which serves the oil   
 rigs in the North Sea to the N.E. of  
 Unst in the Ninian Field. The area has
 3 general stores, one with a bakery   
 and petrol pumps, a butcher's and a   
 Post Office. There is a church and a  
 public hall which is used for         
 badminton, dances, concerts and       
 weddings. There are many ruined crofts
 showing how the population has fallen.</content>
