		<content> Since the coming of{oil}to the N.E. of
 Scotland which has made Aberdeen the  
 Oil Capital of Europe the{population} 
 of Banchory has increased greatly.    
  We the pupils of Primary 6/3 decided 
 to conduct a survey to find out what  
 proportion of the school population   
 had parents connected with the oil    
 industry.To do this we split the class
 into groups which then went round the 
 classrooms asking the following two   
 questions: (a)How many children in the
 class?     (b)How many children have  
 parents in the oil industry?          
  The results were taken back to the   
 classroom and recorded on the board.  
  On adding up the results for (a) we  
 found the number of pupils in the     
 school-715;adding the results for (b) 
 we got the number of children in the  
 school with parents in oil-344,almost 
 half.                                 </content>
