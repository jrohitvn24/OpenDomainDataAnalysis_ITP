		<title>06Miners Strike (Miners Wives)</title>
		<content> For years the miners wives have been  
 contented to be homemakers and let    
 their menfolk take the lead in        
 politics. The 1984-85 miners strike   
 changed all that. The women, who      
 mostly supported their husbands in    
 their strike, were forced out of their
 homes to organise food parcels and    
 lunch clubs for the miners families.  
 They quickly learned how to organise  
 themselves into an extremely well run 
 co-operative. They organised meals,   
 clothes, collections for money and    
 food. As the strike progressed many   
 husbands found they were taking second
 place to to the "committee" and some  
 did not like it. Undeterred the women 
 expanded their interests by forming a 
 "committee" for the whole of Fife. For
 many of the women it was their first  
 active role outside their families.
