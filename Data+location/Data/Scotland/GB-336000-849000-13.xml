		<title>13Farming Changes At Mulben</title>
		<content> When farmers in this area began to    
 grow wheat and barley in preference to
 oats, the Agricultural Colleges and   
 Research Units experimented with      
 different varieties of seeds suitable 
 for sowing in the cold, wet climate of
 the North of Scotland.  Now all the   
 farmers grow winter wheat.  The fields
 are ploughed in Autumn and the seed is
 sown. It begins to germinate, and is  
 hardy enough to withstand the cold of 
 Winter.  When Spring comes and growth 
 returns, the winter wheat grows and   
 ripens over the Summer.  It is ready  
 for harvesting in August.  Farmers    
 here, like to have their winter wheat 
 harvested before the Keith Show Day   
 which is on the second Tuesday of     
 August. After harvesting, a field is  
 ploughed, ready for sowing the next   
 year's crop of winter wheat.  This can
 all happen on the same day.           </content>
