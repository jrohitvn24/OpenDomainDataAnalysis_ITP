   Calderglen Country Fair is one of   
 the biggest events in EAST KILBRIDE.  
 To get in you have to walk through a  
 sort of forest where there are lots of
 trees. There are fir and ash trees.   
 All down the sides of the road are    
 stalls. The different stalls had food 
 bottles,raffles,tombola,etc.          
 There was a hot air balloon and you   
 could ride in it. At the back of the  
 fair there was a jumping castle and a 
 ride called an octopus because it had 
 eight arms to swing you. There were   
 dodgems and other shows. There were   
 three stadiums where you could sit.   
 The admission for an adult was Â£1 and 
 for a child, 50p.                     
 The main event was the world's strong-
 est man competition.                  
 There was also limbo dancing, pillow  
 fights and other exciting games.      </content>
