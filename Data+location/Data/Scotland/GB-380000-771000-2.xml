		<content> Overlooking Bervie Bay is Hallgreen   
 Castle standing in four acres of      
 ground.                               
 The present owner who found it in a   
 ruined state hopes to restore it to   
 the original L plan house.            
 During the renovations the owner      
 happened to touch a wall in the       
 vaulted kitchen. Part of it fell at   
 his feet and there was{a narrow       
{spiral staircase which leads to the   
{Great Hall.}                          
 Other interesting finds were the Great
 Door, a marriage stone - "WR/HC 1687",
 gun loops and arrow slits for this    
 castle was originally built in the {  
{fourteenth century}as a fortification.
 Much repair work has still to be done 
 to this interesting castle which, like
 most others, is said to have a ghost -
{The Green Lady.}                      
                                       </content>
