		<content>     Dr. McLean used to stay in        
 Beechfield, Johnstonebridge and he had
 his surgery in a room in the house .  
     Fourteen years ago he moved to    
 Millhill on the other side of the Dual
 Carriageway. He had a prefab erected  
 there for his surgery. Three old      
 cottages were knocked into one for    
 his house.                            
 As there is no dispensing chemist in  
 Johnstonebridge Dr. McLean does all   
 his own dispensing. This is a great   
 benefit for the local people,         
 especially those with no easy access  
 to a chemist's shop in town.          
     A district nurse comes round to   
 help old people, mothers with babies  
 and to examine children who are       
 starting school.
