		<content>{ }Close to the village of{Castletown} 
 lives Mr Brian Lamb,the only          
 professional{herbalist}in{Scotland.}  
   Mr Lamb obtains the raw ingredients 
 for his medicines from many parts of  
 the world as well as collecting them  
 from the local hedgerows.             
   As all herbalists do,Mr Lamb treats 
 the whole person rather than one or   
 two symptoms.People consult him for   
 many different complaints but the most
 common reason for his patients'visits 
 is problems with their nervous system.
   The herbs have to be dried and      
 ground and then stored in brown jars  
 in alcohol.The medicines are mixed    
 according to the individual needs of  
 each patient.Being the only           
 professional herbalist in Scotland,Mr 
 Lamb's patients come from as far away 
 as Edinburgh and Glasgow.
