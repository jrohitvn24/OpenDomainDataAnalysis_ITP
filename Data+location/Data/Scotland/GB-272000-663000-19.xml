   The biggest shop in Coatbridge is   
 called Asda. This is owned by         
 Associated Dairies. It sells food     
 mainly but also clothes and household 
 items. Lots of the mums in our school 
 work in it , usually part- time. There
 is a big free car park and they also  
 sell petrol which is cheaper than     
 anywhere else. It is 199.9pense per   
 gallon just now. there are other shops
 in the town centre which are all near 
 Asda. There are lots of shoe shops.   
 There are lots of local buses which   
 take you to the town centre. Some of  
 the shops open on a Sunday but not all
 of them.
