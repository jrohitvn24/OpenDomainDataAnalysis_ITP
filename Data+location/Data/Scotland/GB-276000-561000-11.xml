		<content> As the most central town in the       
 Stewartry, Castle-Douglas has a       
 variety of shops, most of them locally
 owned and therefore appreciated       
 because of their individuality. At the
 'top' of the town is the large Market 
 Hill car park which is adjacent to the
 library, small swimming pool and art  
 gallery. The amusement arcade is very 
 popular with teenagers with over 50   
 different games. At the 'foot' of the 
 town is Carlingwark Loch, where boats 
 may be hired and fishing permits      
 obtained. Beside the loch is a        
 recently modernised and attractive    
 caravan park, tennis courts and       
 nearby, a bowling green. The squash   
 courts are very popular and visitors  
 are welcome to have a game. With      
 several hotels, good bed and breakfast
 accomodation and cafes, Castle Douglas
 is a deservedly popular holiday resort</content>
