		<content> Maybole's record as an important      
 manufacturing centre predates W.W.2.  
 In the late 19thC. and early 20thC.   
 the town had an international         
 reputation for the production of      
 quality footwear. Over two thousand   
 employees were needed in the local    
 factories and tanneries. There is now 
 only a single one_man workshop        
 continuing the old skills. Dick Goudie
 makes quality work boots by hand in a 
 process which is now a historical     
 curiosity. Local factories also       
 produced agricultural machinery. Since
 1945 the town has undergone a serious 
 industrial decline. A variety of      
 businesses exist currently in the town
 (ref. INDUSTRY ) but none are large   
 scale employers. Many people travel to
 Ayr, Girvan or further afield for work
 Maybole is becoming a residential area
 for regional industrial centres.      </content>
