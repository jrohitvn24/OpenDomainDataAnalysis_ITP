		<title>03LOCAL HISTORY OF RATHVEN</title>
		<content>      RATHVEN HAS THREE CHURCHES.  IT  
 HAS ONE IN THE OLD GRAVEYARD.  IT WAS 
 JUST FOR PEOPLE TO PRAY IN.  THAT ONE 
 DATES BACK TO THE 13TH CENTURY.  THE  
 MAIN CHURCH WAS BUILT IN 1794 AND THE 
 ADDITION WAS BUILT IN 1874.           
      ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO,   
 THERE WAS A LEPROSY HOSPITAL IN THE   
 FIELD NEXT TO THE GRAVEYARD. THE      
 HOSPITAL IS NOW AN UNCULTIVATED FIELD 
 WHERE HORSES GRAZE IN AUTUMN AND COWS 
 IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER. THERE ARE NO
 VISIBLE REMAINS BUT I THINK THAT YOU  
 COULD COME ACROSS SOMETHING IF YOU DUG
 DOWN.                                 
      IN A DIP IN RATHVEN, THERE ARE   
 THE RUINS OF AN OLD MILL.  IT MAY DATE
 BACK TO THE 16TH CENTURY.  THE TOWER  
 THAT THE MILL WHEEL USED TO HANG FROM 
 WAS KNOCKED DOWN RECENTLY BECAUSE IT  
 WAS DANGEROUS.  NEARBY, THERE IS THE  
 MILL POND.{BY SANDY MCCONNACHIE.      </content>
