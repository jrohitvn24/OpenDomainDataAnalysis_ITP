		<title>12Housing in Barrhead</title>
		<content>  Local Authority{housing}accounts for 
 two thirds of the town's houses.      
 Most of the new houses built recently 
 have been flats of 3 and 4 storeys.   
 There is only one high rise block of  
 flats in the town.  Old houses have   
 been modernised.                      
{ Private developments}have been built 
 on the perimeters of the town.        
 Current new building is concentrated  
 in small pockets of land within the   
 town.                                 
{ Smaller houses}and flats are being   
 built to accommodate single persons,  
 retired couples and couples with no   
 children.  The market for this type of
 housing is expanding.                 
  Four {sheltered housing}complexes    
 have been built to cater for elderly  
 people.  These are well designed and  
 equipped to meet the needs of the     
 elderly.                              </content>
