		<title>03GLENDEVON CHICKEN FARM</title>
		<content>    This farm is owned by D.B.Marshall 
 (Breeders) of Newbridge, Midlothian,  
 and is one of their 13 chicken        
 breeding farms. From the outside all  
 one can see are 4 huge wooden         
 buildings, but these are split into   
 three parts on the inside, with a     
 central section for the feed machinery
 and the ends being used to house the  
 chickens.                             
    The staff of only 2 look after     
 about 6,400 female birds in each of 7 
 of these sections, and 5,500 males in 
 the 8th. Day old chicks come here from
 Newbridge, and are fed on a crumbed   
 wheat and barley mix each morning,    
 leaving the farm when 20 weeks old to 
 go to another farm in the group. The  
 all white chickens are all very clean 
 and well cared for, being regularly   
 checked for symptoms of disease or    
 other problems.                       </content>
