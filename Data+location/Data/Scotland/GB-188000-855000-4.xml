		<title>04Torridon Primary School</title>
		<content> There is only one{Primary School}in   
 Torridon.At present there are eight   
 pupils and one teacher.There are two  
 travelling teachers,one for Gaelic and
 one for music,who come once a week.All
 the other subjects are taught by the  
 head teacher.The school is at least 90
 years old.There is only one room for  
 the school and one for the canteen  in
 which lunches are cooked and served.  
 There used to be no canteen and that  
 room was another classroom. The school
 was then like a primary and secondary 
 combined,so most pupils did not go to 
 an other school,but left from Torridon
 Public School as it was then called.  
 Some more able scholars went for      
 higher education to Dingwall Academy. 
 Pupils attend from a wide area, most  
 being brought by school transport.    
 Stages are from P1 to P7,after which  
 the pupils attend Plockton High School</content>
