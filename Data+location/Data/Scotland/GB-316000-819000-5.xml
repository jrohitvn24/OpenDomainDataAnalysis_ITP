		<content> Croughly House was built in 1812 and  
 as it is a listed building it must be 
 maintained in good condition with no  
 alteration or additions.There is a    
 forestry plantation around the        
 buildings.The occupiers Mr and Mrs    
 Lindsay run a farm at Croughly.The    
 crops grown are turnips,swedes,barley,
 potatoes and rape.                    
 Much of the land is arable but there  
 is also quite a lot of rough grazing  
 ground.Hill sheep and beef cattle are 
 bred.They have one Charolais bull and 
 forty beef cows.A contractor cuts     
 silage and hay in the summer.In the   
 winter the beasts are fed on silage   
 and hay and the sheep on sheep nuts,  
 barley and hay.The main breed of sheep
 is Leicester.During August and        
 November there is a mart in Tomintoul 
 which is two miles from Croughly.     
 Cattle and sheep are sold there then.{</content>
