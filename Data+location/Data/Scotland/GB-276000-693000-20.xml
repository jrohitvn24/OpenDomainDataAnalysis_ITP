		<content> A doctor attends the prison every day,
 a dentist weekly. Inmates can take    
 educational courses to help them when 
 they come out. Some sit exams such as 
{0 and H Grades.}Also there are leisure
 activities, such as sewing, knitting, 
 woodwork etc. All these practical     
 activities are to gear the inmates for
 life out of prison. Social workers    
 visit the prison to help inmates.     
 Ministers visit the prison to take    
 services in the chapel and to visit   
 individuals. In spare time inmates can
 go to the prison shop, see TV etc.    
 They are allowed a visit fortnightly  
 for an hour. Families can spend 2     
 hours together. A Christmas concert &amp; 
 sports day are held annually. After a 
 time inmates can go on visits outside 
 accompanied by an officer.
