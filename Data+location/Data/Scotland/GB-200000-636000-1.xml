		<title>01BRODICK, ISLE OF ARRAN</title>
		<content> Brodick village nestles in a bay of   
 beauty with the green hills behind and
 the golden sand of the beach in front.
   The population make their living    
 from tourism, the land and servicing  
 the community.                        
   Less than an hour from the mainland 
 by ferry, the island's population     
 doubles in summer when tourists come  
 to enjoy holidays involving many      
 outdoor pursuits:climbing, riding,    
 cycling and sailing or relaxing on the
 beach, walking and observing the      
 wealth of wildlife and scenery.       
   Hotels and boarding houses line the 
 main shore but as you follow the road 
 past the shops and turn towards the   
 castle you enter a countryside of     
 forest and grassland rising to heather
 clad hills with small farms and small 
 holdings in the glens between.
