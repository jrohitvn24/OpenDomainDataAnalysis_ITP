		<content> THE TEA TOWEL                         
 The idea to make a Tea Towel about the
 area came from the Headmaster &amp; PTA.  
 Budding young artists from Drumoak    
 School visited and drew places of     
 local interest, Drum Castle, River Dee
 Drumoak School and animals common to  
 our landscape.Some of the pictures    
 were photo-copied to fit on a master  
 copy of the towel showing well known  
 places in and around our village and  
 surrounded by a border of oak leaves. 
 The master copy was sent to a firm who
 made a silk screen copy of the towel, 
 used to print on white linen towels.  
 The Tea Towels were then sold by the  
 school and have been sent by parents  
 and pupils to America, Africa,        
 Australia and all over the world.     
 Sales of Drumoak Tea Towels have      
 raised about Â£400 for School Funds.
