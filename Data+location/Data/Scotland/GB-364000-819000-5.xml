		<title>05Events - Sheep Dog Trials</title>
		<content> A hill trial for sheep dogs was held  
 on the lower slopes of Bennachie on   
 Sunday, 13 October, 1985 (organised by
 Alexander Moir, Pond Croft, Keig).    
 The entrants were limited to 30 -     
 all collies working singly. The trials
 began at 8 a.m. with each competitor  
 being allowed a maximum of 15 minutes 
 to complete the course. The dogs were 
 expected to herd 4 sheep on a 650 yard
 uphill outrun also to shed and pen.   
 Competitors came from as far afield as
 Brora. The judge was the previous     
 year's winner, Hugh MacKenzie from    
 Dingwall, and the prizes were         
 presented by Lady Forbes.             
 The weather was ideal for the event - 
 blue skies and brilliant sunshine (see
 slide B).
