		<title>18BRIDGE OF EARN HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> The hospital was built in 1940 as a   
 temporary measure in pre_fabricated   
 huts for war casulties. The site which
 covers 50 acres had good clean air and
 was unlikely to be bombed. It became  
 and has remained a main centre for    
 physiotherapy and a major employer for
 45 years, but is due for closure in   
 1990. It has 250 beds and deals with  
 58000 inpatients and 40000 outpatients
 per year. It has 240 medical staff and
 75 administration and maintenance,    
 mainly local or from Fife and Perth.  
 Visiting hours are from 2_8.30pm every
 day and there are facilities for      
 parents staying with their sick       
 children. The catering is done on the 
 premises with a choice of menu and    
 special diets.
