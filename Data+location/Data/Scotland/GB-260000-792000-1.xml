 integrated people in a scattered rural
 setting.The hamlet is surrounded by   
 the Monadhliath mountains and through 
 it flows the young river Spey over    
 which spans the 1985 concrete and     
 steel,fourth LAGGAN BRIDGE,which gives
 the village its name.                 
 Laggan bridge sits on the A86 main    
 road west to Fort William and guards  
 the approach to General Wade's        
 military road-the Corrieyairack
