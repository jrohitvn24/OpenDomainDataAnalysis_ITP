		<title>14WILD LIFE</title>
		<content>    The country side around Fetterangus
 is full of wildlife, but you need to  
 know what to look for and must be very
 quiet.                                
    The river Ugie and Pitfour Lake    
 influence the types of wildlife to be 
 found.  Beside the river is a breeding
 pair of otters living in a burrow in a
 ditch.  The otters and black mink fish
 in the river.  The mink may have      
 escaped from a mink farm some miles   
 away.                                 
    I have seen roe deer and once found
 a newly born fawn.  I did not touch it
 as its mother would have rejected it  
 if it had traces of human smell.      
    Wood-pigeons are common and their  
 numbers make it easy to study the     
 development of birds from the eggs to 
 adults.
