		<title>07FARMING..AUCTION PRICES</title>
		<content> A visit to Speedie Brothers           
 Auctioneers in Cupar provided         
 interesting information about farm    
 prices for June 1985. Beef cattle were
 priced at 102 pence per kilo with a   
 subsidy of 8.7 pence a kilo. The      
 cattle are mainly Aberdeen Angus,     
 Hereford, Freisian crossed with       
 heavier European breeds such as       
 Charolais and Simmental. Our          
 interviewer was told that in the      
 future the trend would be towards     
 producing meat from these European    
 breeds. It was also suggested that in 
 the future the meat trade would be    
 taken over by large multiple stores   
 and that local butchers shops would   
 become a thing of the past. Other     
 prices at this week's auction included
 Â£135 for 3 week old  bull calves and  
 similar age Heifer calves fetching    
 Â£100 a head.                          </content>
