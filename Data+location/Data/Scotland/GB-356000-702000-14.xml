		<title>14Anstruther Discotheque</title>
		<content>   "Scamps"opened this year as the     
 town's first permanent discotheque.It 
 got its name because it used to be a  
 scampi factory. It is furnished with  
 green &amp; black seats and carpets with  
 "Scamps" written all over them. There 
 are mirrors down one wall and small   
 mirrors shaped like rabbit heads      
 everywhere else. The dance floor is   
 quite small with modern flashing      
 lights. There is a digital screen and 
 you can send messages through it.     
 There are 3 televisions and a video   
 camera which shows you on the screen. 
 For our Junior Discos it costs 70p to 
 get in and you can buy juice, chips   
 and crisps. They run discos for all   
 ages.                                 
  The DJ's play fashionable and popular
 records like "Ghostbusters" by Ray    
 Parker Jnr and "19"by Paul Hardcastle.
 They also play requests.              </content>
