		<title>14HEBRIDEAN WORKSHOP</title>
		<content> The Hebridean Workshop, Aberdeen      
 The workshop was opened in November   
 1983 and it is rapidly becoming very  
 well known. It has 2 aims, to help in 
 the survival of a rare breed of sheep 
 and to make a profit to help with the 
 upkeep of these sheep. Rare Hebridean 
 sheep and Black Welsh sheep thrive on 
 the small farm. These sheep have a    
 high quality brown/black fleece. This 
 wool is used in a small cottage       
 industry. Two women design garments.  
 The wool is spun and woven by hand and
 machine. They produce high quality    
 woollen products including jumpers,   
 hats, scarves, aprons, tea towels,    
 T-shirts and wall hangings.
