		<title>14RESTENNETH PRIORY</title>
		<content> The ruined Priory of Restenneth is a  
 classic example of {local history}, it
 lies not far from Nechtansmere, an    
 ancient battlefield.                  
 It was built as a{church}in the year  
 AD 710 by King Nechtan, in the Saxon  
 manner, by stone masons. The tower    
 wasn't built until later, around the  
 turn of the 11th and 12th centuries.  
 Later in the 12th century it was still
 a small Priory for monks regular of   
 the order of St. Augustine. It was    
 last used as a Parish church in 1560. 
 The{Ancient Monument}and nearby       
 Abbot's House were donated to the     
 Nation in 1929 via the former Ministry
 of Works, now Department of the       
 Environment. It's{structure}is made of
 sandstone. Nowadays most of the walls 
 have fallen down, but some still stand
 in excellent condition, for example   
 the tower.                            </content>
