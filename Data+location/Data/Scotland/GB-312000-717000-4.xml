		<content> This farm also grows about 240 acres  
 of barley.This consists of one field  
 of malt barley,which is sent to a     
 distillery,and one field of seed      
 barley which is used to feed the      
 cattle in the winter.Mr Johnston used 
 to grow oats and wheat but he has     
 stopped growing those now and so have 
 many farmers who now grow oilseed rape
 which is a profitable alternative.    
 Oilseed rape is crushed for oil.      
    Turnips are also grown on the farms
 but these are not good enough for     
 human eating so the farmer might sell 
 them off to a cattle farmer.Most of   
 the farmers rear cattle for beef.     
    Vegetables such as peas are grown  
 and crushed as protein for the cattle.
 Some prize crops of peas can be sold  
 to supermarkets.The average size of   
 farm is about 300 acres.Most of the   
 farm buildings have been renovated    </content>
