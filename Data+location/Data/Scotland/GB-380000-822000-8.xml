		<title>08Bourtie Deliveries</title>
		<content> Although most of Bourtie lies within  
 two miles of a town, either Oldmeldrum
 or Inverurie, it is still makedly a   
 country place, with most of the 265   
 residents involved in farming; this   
 has in the past ment that while the   
 husband and son are out on the tractor
 or with the animals, and the children 
 are at school, transported by the     
 school bus, the farm wife has remained
 at home preparing food or minding the 
 household.  Little change has filtered
 in an although the wife may be able to
 drive a car (in many cases she cannot 
 or does not), there is only one car   
 per family and the couple usually     
 drive together on Friday, farmers'    
 market day, to Huntly or Aberdeen for 
 weekly supplies.  Consequently there  
 are four vans which deliver bread,    
 fish, meat and lemonade weekly to     
 farms.                                </content>
