		<title>15A DAY AS A FILM EXTRA.</title>
		<content> I must be mad doing this-time of      
 arrival being 6.30am.Standing in one  
 queue to be checked in another to     
 claim our costumes.Then to the marquee
 to change and another queue to be     
 checked.Even more queues to have mud  
 plastered on our faces.Jumped on to a 
 bus,yet to be faced with a queue for  
 breakfast.Spent the morning being told
 by one director to do one thing and   
 another something else."Lunch time"   
 (funnily enough another queue).       
 Afternoon-much the same as the morning
 but more boring.Feeling a right idiot 
 having to mime because the horse did  
 not like noise.Back to base camp-more 
 queues to hand in the costumes and    
 collect our earnings!Was it worth     
 it?-Yes,if I'm seen in the film.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
