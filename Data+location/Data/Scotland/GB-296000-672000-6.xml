		<title>06New Buildings in Torphichen.</title>
		<content> Recently plans have been passed by    
 West Lothian District Council to build
 twelve terraced houses in the open    
 space next to Torphichen School. This 
 is a very unpopular development with  
 people living in the area. Most people
 living nearby think that the green    
 will be far too cramped and the view  
 will be spoiled. The majority of      
 people would rather see three to four 
 bungalows or cottages instead of      
 twelve terraced houses. Another       
 criticism is that parking may cause   
 problems as spaces will be very       
 restricted and cause congestion.      
 Mothers are worried for the safety    
 of their children as there would be no
 playing area for them next to their   
 homes.There have been several formal  
 complaints from the householders to   
 West Lothian District Council but to  
 no avail.                             </content>
