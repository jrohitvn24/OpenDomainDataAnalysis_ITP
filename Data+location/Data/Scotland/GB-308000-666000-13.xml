		<title>13Changing Times in E/Calder</title>
		<content> In 1945 East Calder was very different
 from what it is now.                  
  The only houses were along the Main  
 Street and part of Langton Road.Since 
 then hundreds of new houses have been 
 built-Mansefield,Bellway and Wimpey.  
  In 1945 most people worked in shale  
 mines and oilworks in the area        
 especially Pumpherston.Now people who 
 work up to 20-30 miles away live here.
  In 1945 there were a lot more shops  
 than there are now.Nowadays most women
 prefer to drive to supermarkets in    
 Livingston to do their shopping.      
  One thing that hasn't changed is that
 people still go to Edinburgh for their
 entertainment.People go to the cinema,
 theatre,indoor bowling and swimming.  
 In 1945 the only entertainment in East
 Calder was 2 bowling greens and the   
 cinema in the scout hall.
