		<title>05A DAY IN THE LIFE OF -</title>
		<content> A day in the life of Alexander Ingram 
 I wake up at 7.30am. After brushing my
 teeth I get dressed, comb my hair and 
 feed my unusual Siamese Fighters with 
 bloodworms. Then at 7.45 I have       
 breakfast,which is Frosties, not      
 bloodworms. At 8.00 I wait for the bus
 which comes at 8.15. It is a 30 min.  
 trip to Holy Family school. We arrive 
 at 8.45 but school starts at 9.00 so  
 we play in the playground. After      
 prayers we go to maths which is my    
 favourite subject. We stop for        
 playtime at 10.30. We cpme in after 15
 mins. and do creative writing. We stop
 at 12.15 for lunch. After this, and a 
 play outside it is 1.15. When we come 
 in we do prayers then RE. for one hour
 and a project for 45 mins. We get out 
 at 3.15. I arrive home at 3.45. I feed
 my fish and look at them until 4.00. I
 then watch TV and draw lots of things.</content>
