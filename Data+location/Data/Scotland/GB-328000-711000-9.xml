 The issue of rural primary school     
 closures is a very important one in   
 N.E. Fife. Collessie Primary at one   
 time served both the village children 
 and those of the workers from         
 surrounding farms. The workers were   
 mobile and caused numbers in the      
 school to flucctuate. However,        
 increasing mechanisation of farms     
 greatly lessened the need for farm    
 workers and, allied with a general    
 decline in family size, the school    
 role fell dramatically.               
 Pupil numbers were 1889_114: 1922_45: 
 1939_80 (this included wartime        
 evacuees):1971_32: 1977_15: 1982_6:   
 In July 1982 with the 6 remaining     
 pupils being in their later years at  
 school, Collessie primary School      
 finally closed.
