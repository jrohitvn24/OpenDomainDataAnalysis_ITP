 Board employs a staff of 46.It        
 produces 24000 pints of milk daily    
 collected by two tankers from 14      
 farms.They deliver as far west as     
 Dounreay and south to Berriedale.     
  In the past year they have changed   
 from bottles to cartons for economic  
 reasons.They pasteurise 1000 gallons  
 of milk per hour and 35 cartons are   
 filled per minute.Milk is delivered   
 daily to each household in the town.  
 John O'Groats Laundry,which was built 
 in 1911, now employs 28 people,6 men  
 and 22 women.This is perhaps the only 
 establishment where workers clock in  
 and out daily.
