		<content> The main religion of the people of our
 area is Church of Scotland. As there  
 are many RAF families in the area     
 there are many Church of England      
 members as well. Minority religions   
 were Catholic,Jehovah's Witness and   
 Quaker each with 1 member. We found   
 that about 10% of people interviewed  
 were not members of any church.       
 There is only 1 church in Rafford and 
 it is the Church of Scotland.Of the   
 sample of people interviewed only 9   
 attended church weekly while 12       
 attended monthly and 19 people        
 attended less than 4 times a year. 6  
 people go only to, Christmas and      
 Easter services.Only 2 children attend
 Sunday school in Rafford.1One person  
 goes to services run by The Findhorn  
 Foundation , 3 people attend a church 
 in Forres while one goes to Elgin.
