		<content> John MacKay of Clydebank Athletic Club
 has become the first Bankie to join   
 the exclusive "Sub 4" Club thirty-one 
 years after Sir Roger Bannister made  
 history by becoming the first man to  
 run a mile in under 4 minutes.        
     Last Sunday John was timed at     
 3:57.6 as he finished in second place 
 just half a second behind Adrian      
 Callan.It was a great run by the young
 Faifley science teacher who finished  
 ahead of internationalists John Laing 
 (N.Ireland) and Dave Baptiste(England)
 both of whom also dipped under the 4  
 minute mark.                          
     John's immediate reward was an    
 invitation to run against a top       
 class field including the great Steve 
 Ovett at the opening of Glasgow's new 
 Crownpoint Track next week.
