		<content> The Monklands District, including     
 Townhead, has a very high percentage  
 of Roman Catholics, the result of     
 immigration from Ireland last century.
 One feature of the district that has  
 persisted to the present day is hence 
 religious bigotry, with Orange Walks  
 and Hibernian marches, vandalism and  
 graffiti ("IRA" and "UVF" and rude    
 remarks about the Pope and so on ),   
 fights between neighbouring schools,  
 and a set of beliefs that each side   
 holds about the other. For instance it
 is a widely held belief on the        
 Protestant side that the reason for   
 the pedestrianisation of Coatbridge   
 Main Street was to prevent the July   
 Orange Walk going past St. Patrick's  
 R.C. church in it. On the Catholic    
 side there are widely held beliefs    
                                       
                                       </content>
