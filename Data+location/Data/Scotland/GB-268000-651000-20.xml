		<content> back to the house and changed into my 
 swimsuit. I put on lots of suntan oil 
 and lay on a cover outside. It was    
 very hot, but I stayed out until 5:20,
 when Pauline came home.               
   The phone rang. It was the manager  
 of the pub. He asked Pauline to bring 
 some ice as the ice-machine was broke.
 My older sister Marie drove up 10 min-
 utes later. We were surprised as she  
 should have been in France!           
   That night we watched TV and Pauline
 went out with her boyfriend. I went to
 bed at 12:15.                         
   I woke up at 8:45, went to Chapel,  
 came home and had lunch. I got changed
 and played outside until dinnertime.  
 We went to The Manzil (an Indian      
 restaurant) for our dinner. I then    
 stayed at my cousin's for a while then
 went home. I watched TV until 9:35    
 and eventually went to bed at 10:25.  </content>
