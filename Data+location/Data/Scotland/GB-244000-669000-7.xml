		<title>07A DAY IN THE LIFE OF KIRSTY</title>
		<content> On weekdays I get up at 7.50 am.  I   
 make my bed and get washed.  Then I   
 get dressed and go downstairs.  I have
 my breakfast which is a couple  of    
 slices of toast and a cup of tea.  I  
 do the dishes and leave for Barsail   
 Primary School.  School starts at 9.00
 am.  Most of the morning is taken up  
 with arithmetic and our project work. 
 I go home for lunch at 12.00 pm.  In  
 the afternoon a teacher from Park     
 Mains High School visits us to teach  
 us French.  When school finishes at   
 3.30 pm,I rush home to change and do  
 my homework.  For dinner I have roast 
 beef, roast potatoes and some         
 vegetables.  Afterwards I play on my  
 bike with my friends.  Then I watch   
 television, have supper and get ready 
 for bed.
