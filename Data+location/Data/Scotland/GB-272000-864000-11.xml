 The "Black Pig" was made by the men   
 at the smiddy from empty oil drums,   
 wood, metal girders going across  from
 the ends and the sides and old plastic
 seats. We can recognise the raft by   
 the large pig's head at the front of  
 the raft. The raft race starts at     
 about 2.00p.m. and ends about 4.00p.m.
 In case of an accident there is a     
 dinghy that serves as a rescue boat   
 and an ambulance stands by on the     
 pier. It is a very good day out for   
 all the family.
