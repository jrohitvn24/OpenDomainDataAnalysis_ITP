 we live on Floor 13 of a 20 storey    
 flat in Sighthill.Robert,a chef,is now

 Today I rose at 0520 and started work 
 at 0600 at Sighthill Primary School   
 where I am a cleaner.We work to 0900  
 with a tea-break midway.I breakfasted 
 at 0930 and started housework.Washing 
 is done in an automatic machine.I got 
 ready to go into town where I met     
 friends at 1100 for coffee.At 1215 I  
 left to shop and got home at 1315.    
 After lunch I hung out the washing and
 sat down to read the paper.Then I pre-
 pared dinner,a chicken casserole,and  
 returned to work at 1530.Work finished
 at 1900.After dinner I went to the    
 Snowball Club at St Stephen's Church. 
 We played Bingo,for church funds.Home 
 by 2200,I put Scott's school clothes  
 out and went to bed at 2310.          </content>
