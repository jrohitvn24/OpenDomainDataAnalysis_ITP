		<title>06Ardross: Easter Ardross</title>
		<content> Easter Ardross is a farm. There is an 
 empty house and garage. Across the    
 road is an old garage for farming     
 equipment. There are two semi-detached
 and occupied houses.                  
 Down below the storage sheds are two  
 cottages with garden sheds and a byre 
 adjoining.                            
 There is an old farmhouse which looks 
 like a mansion and a building for     
 storing hay. This is one of the two   
 large farms in the Ardross area.      
 The people who live at the steading   
 are nearly all 'white settlers'       
 (people who do not belong to the      
 area). They range from the very young 
 to a retired group. As far as modern  
 day comforts are concerned they are   
 reasonably well off. Of the four      
 groups surveyed 75% were owner        
 occupied.                             
                                       </content>
