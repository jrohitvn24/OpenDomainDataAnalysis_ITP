 area.{ Iron and Clay} were  mined but 
 mainly  coal. Until twenty five years 
 ago , most men were  employed in coal 
 mines.                                
     When mines  closed  two factories 
 employed  the  men . One in  Bathgate 
 manufacturing cars and  trucks called 
 the{British Motor Company }and one in 
 Shotts  making  large deisel  engines 
 called Cummins. The{B.M.C.}has closed

  finished  in the  area but  there is 
 still one quarry  working  extracting

 operation.It is open cast.{Women}have
