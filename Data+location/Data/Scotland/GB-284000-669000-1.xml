		<content> The area studied,grid.ref.02840669 is 
 partly in Central Region and partly in
 Strathclyde. Limerigg village belongs 
 to Central Region and has a population
 of 228. It is however,an area of high 
 unemployment. Most of those lucky     
 enough to be in employment are either 
 working for one of the local family   
 businesses or commute to Airdrie,     
 Falkirk or Grangemouth. The           
 unpopulated area is mainly used as    
 grazing land for beef cattle. The area
 is very exposed to rain and wind,plus 
 both topsoil and subsoil are poor,    
 thus it is unsuitable for the growing 
 and ripening of crops,other than for  
 fodder. The forestry commission has   
 planted trees in two sections but     
 there does not appear to be any plans 
 for expansion.
