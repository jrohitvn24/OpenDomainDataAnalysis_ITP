		<content> Kinbrace came into being when a       
 station was built there in 1874.In    
 1883 a school was built there because 
 many pupils could travel by train to  
 school. Since then there have been    
 many comings and goings of people. Now
 there is only a shop, a post office, a
 garage, two churches and twelve       
 houses. Not so long ago there were    
 sheep sales at Kinbrace. All that is  
 now left is the auctioneer's office   
 which is the Kinbrace boys' hut. The  
 shop at Kinbrace is really a miniature
 supermarket. It is not busy in winter 
 but in summer it supplies the shooting
 lodges with groceries and wines. The  
 post office is part of the shop. There
 is a garage and a village hall which  
 was used for wedding anniversaries,   
 parties and celebrations throughout   
 the years. Today it is falling down.
