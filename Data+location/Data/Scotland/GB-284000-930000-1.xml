		<title>01The Block, Kinbrace</title>
		<content> Our block is an area of moorland where
 two valleys meet. The valley floor is 
 about 115 metres above sea level and  
 there are land masses in the east and 
 north west of the area rising to 300  
 metres. The valley floor is grassland 
 and the slopes are heather clad with  
 areas of afforestation. The           
 landownership is divided between the  
 two estates of Badanloch and          
 Achentoul. Kinbrace, a small hamlet in
 the centre of the block, is a focal   
 point with roads meeting from the     
 north,the south and the west. These   
 roads cross the railway line. Kinbrace
 is a service station with a school,   
 two churches, shop,garage,post office 
 and a railway request stop. The       
 population of the block is twenty two 
 all but one living in Kinbrace.
