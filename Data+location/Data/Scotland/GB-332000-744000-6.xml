		<title>06AN EASSIE FARMWORKER'S LIFE</title>
		<content> Farmworkers in the Eassie area start  
 work at 7.30 each morning. They work  
 till 12 noon, when they get an hour   
 for lunch. Work continues till 5p.m.. 
 At busy times such as seed-time and   
 harvest, they work long hours of      
 overtime to get the work completed on 
 time.                                 
 In winter-time when there is not a lot
 of outside work to do, the men are    
 busy getting the machinery ready for  
 the next season. They also make potato
 boxes, mend fences and feed the cattle
 which are indoors for the winter.     
 The men get two weeks holidays when   
 the spring planting is over and three 
 weeks later in the year.              
 All our land workers live on the farms
 in tied cottages.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
