		<title>02ALVES VILLAGE NOW</title>
		<content> Alves Village is a small, quiet and   
 peaceful village apart from the A96   
 which runs along the side of it. The  
 population of Alves is 148. There are 
 a few amenities in Alves such as the  
 playing park which has a football     
 pitch. At the west end of the         
 village is a garage which has a shop  
 and a take away. There is also a pub  
 called the Crook Inn. Eight new houses
 are planned for Alves and they are    
 going to be built in Arbuthnott's     
 yard.The Arbuthnotts sold the yard to 
 the council. About 10 years ago the   
 council bought forty acres of land    
 from Moray Estates to build houses on 
 but they haven't started yet.
