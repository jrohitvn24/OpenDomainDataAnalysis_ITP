		<title>02Edinburgh Castle</title>
		<content> The castle is the centre of local     
 history and tourism in Edinburgh. It  
 stands on a dramatic site at the top  
 of Castle Rock, which is a volcanic   
 plug, looking down on Princes Street  
 several hundred feet below.           
 There have been fortifications on this
 site since ancient, times but the     
 present castle is relatively modern,  
 dating from the 17th century.         
 The castle is the haedquarters of the 
 army in Scotland. On the Esplanade the
 Edinburgh Tattoo, a military display, 
 is held each year during the Edinburgh
 Festival.                             
 The castle is the top tourist         
 attraction in Scotland. It houses     
 several museums, St. Margarets Chapel 
 (the oldest building in the castle)   
 and Mons Meg(a 15th century cannon).  
 Also the Scotish Royal Regalia are on 
 display.                              </content>
