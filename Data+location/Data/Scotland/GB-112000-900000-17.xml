		<content> Religion plays a big part in the lives
 of many people in Harris.There are    
 three denominations-the Free Church,  
 Free Presbyterian and the Church of   
 Scotland,although in Tarbert only the 
 two church buildings.The Free Church  
 people may go to Stornoway but also   
 every year there is a Free Church     
 Conference in Tarbert,sometimes held  
 in the school.Both churches in Tarbert
 are reasonably near the sea because   
 long ago people used to come to church
 by boats.The Church of Scotland is    
 bigger than the Free Presbyterian     
 church which is only one hall.The     
 Church of Scotland has one main hall  
 and a smaller hall,the main hall also 
 has a gallery and an upper floor so it
 seats over 200 people.Harris is very  
 different from many places as the     
 Sabbath is still kept.No businesses or
 shops are open;no work is done.       </content>
