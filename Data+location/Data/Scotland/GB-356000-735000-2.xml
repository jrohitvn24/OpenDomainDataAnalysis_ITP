		<content>   The adults of this area follow a    
 wide variety of careers and           
 employment.                           
   Many are connected in some way with 
 the{oil industry,}working either with 
 shore-based companies or on an        
 off-shore basis.                      
   The neighbouring city of{Dundee}is  
 the headquarters of a{newspaper}which 
 has a wide circulation in central     
 Scotland.  This gives employment to a 
 large number of Carnoustie people.    
   Also in{Dundee}is a large, modern   
{teaching hospital,}where many local   
 women work.                           
   The{University of Dundee}attracts   
 many people as lecturers, technicians 
 etc. Many of them are employed in the 
 ever-expanding computer department.
