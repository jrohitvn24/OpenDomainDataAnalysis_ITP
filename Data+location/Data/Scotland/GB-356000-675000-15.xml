    I wake up at 7.45 am, get up and go
 down to the kitchen to make my packed 
 lunch. I eat my breakfast.            
   I go back to my room and dress while
 listening to the radio. I leave for   
 school about 8.30am. Before the bell  
 rings I play on the swings in the park
 with some of my friends.              
  School begins at 9am with a prayer.  
 We work on mathematics until playtime.
 I sometimes sell crisps in the school 
 tuckshop. Until lunchtime we work on  
 language. Some days we watch a        
 television programme.                 
   We eat lunch in the dining room     
 or, if it is a fine day, in the park. 
 Today I ate a ham roll, crisps, coca  
 cola, yoghurt, biscuits and an apple. 
   In the afternoon we work on         
 environmental study projects or do art
 or craft work. At 3,15pm I go home.   </content>
