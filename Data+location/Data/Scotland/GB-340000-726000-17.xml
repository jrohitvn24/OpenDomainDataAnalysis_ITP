		<content>   In 1966 the Tay Road Bridge from    
 Dundee to Fife with immediate access  
 to the Newport area opened resulting  
 in considerable change to the area,   
 most strikingly in the amount of new  
 housing built. Previouslu most of the 
 housing was Victorian and owned by    
 business men who used the ferry or    
 train but now there is a large amount 
 of modern housing for an increasingly 
 expanding population due to the       
 bridge.                               
   The two schools in the area have    
 been rebuilt on what were fields and  
 are now modern open plan buildings. 25
 years ago the whole area was quieter  
 with many more open spaces.           
   There used to be a cinema which has 
 now been converted to a youth club and
 the shopping faciities have changed to
 suit the populations requirements.
