		<title>01Farmland around Whithorn</title>
		<content> This land, to the North and East of   
 Whithorn, is predominantly enclosed   
 rough pasture, grazed by dairy cattle,
 mostly Ayrshires and Friesians with a 
 few Belted Galloways.  The land is    
 hillocky and generally poor quality,  
 although there are some wheat fields. 
 The wheat is harvested using combine  
 harvesters and baled into large       
 cylinders or into oblongs stacked into
 triangles.  Whithorn is a small       
 agricultural town with mostly pre-war 
 (1939) houses with solid wall         
 construction but has a small council  
 estate of modern cavity wall houses.  
 There is an above average number of   
 houses and shops for sale.  A local   
 church has been converted to a garage 
 with petrol station.
