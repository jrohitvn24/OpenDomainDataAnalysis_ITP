		<content>   IN BARRY MOST OF THE HOUSING IS     
 COTTAGES.MANY DATE BACK TO THE LATE   
 18TH CENTURY WHEN FLAX WAS GROWN AND  
 PROCESSED.MORE UP TO DATE HOUSES HAVE 
 BEEN BUILT IN CARNOUSTIE BUT STILL    
 THERE ARE A LOT OF OLD COTTAGES.BETT  
 HAVE BEEN BUILDING A NEW RANGE OF     
 HOUSES ACROSS FROM THE SCHOOL.        
   THE OLD COTTAGES IN BARRY HAVE FEWER
 ROOMS AND THE OUTER WALLS ARE BUILT   
 WITH STONE AND MORTAR WITH SLATE      
 ROOFS.MOST OF THE NEWER HOUSES ARE    
 BUILT WITH TWO LAYERS OF BRICK AND A  
 SEAL OF AIR IN BETWEEN FOR INSULATION 
 AND TILED ROOFS.                      
   NOWADAYS HOUSES ARE BUILT MAINLY IN 
 SCHEMES. THEY ARE BUILT CLOSE TOGETHER
 WITH SHOPS AND GRASSY AREAS.A WHILE   
 AGO THEY WERE BUILT IN SMALLER        
 COMMUNITIES.I THINK HUOSES ARE BETTER 
 TODAY AND I HOPE THIS WILL CONTINUE.
