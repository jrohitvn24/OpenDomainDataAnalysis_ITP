		<title>09Riding of the Marches</title>
		<content> At Rosebank riding school, preparation
 begins at 4am for the riding of the   
 marches. The riding itself begins at  
 7.45am on a June day each year.       
    On the 50th anniversary in 1982,   
 about 400 riders took part. Normally  
 it's between 100 and 200. The marches 
 have not changed since 1932, when     
 Major J.Lyndsay Drummond was{Cornet}. 
{Cornet's Lasses} were introduced in   
 1939.                                 
    To be a Cornet or Lass, you must be
 born in Dumfries. The marches are done
 to keep Dumfries a{Royal Burgh}until  
 next year's festivities.              
    In the ceremony a charter is handed
 to the {Provost}, requesting Dumfries 
 to be kept a Burgh. The Cornet and {  
{Lynors} mark the town Boundary by     
 'stobbing and nogging', meaning       
 sticking in a post and flag. 1986 is  
 the 800th anniversary of the Burgh.   </content>
