		<content> The minister, Mr Ross, showed us over 
 the church and told us about it.  The 
 congregation owns communion vessels   
 more than 300 years old.  It is said  
 that a Covenanting minister, Alexander
 Stevensone, carried them with him in  
 the field during the religious        
 troubles of the time.                 
                                       
 The congregation of this church has   
 recently united with that of another  
 local Church of Scotland.  The parish 
 roll now has nearly 1000 names on it  
 and the minister said numbers are     
 increasing.
