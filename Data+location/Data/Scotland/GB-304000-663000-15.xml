		<title>15BELLSQUARRY VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Bellsquarry}is situated in the south- 
 west corner of{Livingston New Town,   
 retaining a rural character,though the
 green fields of Brucefield Farm are   
 now an Industrial Estate,and Crofthead
 Farm, in the north,a Community Centre.
 Long ago, stage coaches stopped at the
 Elm Tree but the{A71}now by-passes the
 village. The quiet attracts new       
 residents. Mrs. Elaine Forrest,a      
 hairdresser, resident here for 3 years
 thinks Bellsquarry an ideal place to  
 live. It is in the country and yet she
 can reach her place of work in 15     
 minutes by car. We greatly enjoyed    
 our talks with Miss Nellie Denison,   
 who has lived here all her life. She  
 lives at {Yellowstruther}mentioned in 
 history books as far back as the 11th 
 century. She was a kennel-maid, when  
 young,at Alderstone House, now a      
 Garden Centre.                        </content>
