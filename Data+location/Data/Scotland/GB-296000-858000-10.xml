		<title>10DYKE PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church in Dyke was built in 1781  
 and is positioned on a hill about the 
 middle of the village.Although the    
 church was built in 1781 there was a  
 church there since the eleventh       
 century.There was another church just 
 outside Dyke,now used for             
 storage,which was the united free     
 church.In 1929 the two churches joined
 although it was not until 1941 that   
 the congregations united.In the Dyke  
 Church roll are 182 people, 65 people 
 who regularly come on Sunday worship  
 and 16 elders.There are 6             
 organisations connected with the      
 church  which are Creche,womens       
 guild,badminton club, youth           
 fellowship,bible class and Sunday     
 School.The Sunday School has about    
 15-20 children who attend regularly
