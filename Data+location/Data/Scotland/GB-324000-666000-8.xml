		<content> HOLIDAY PATTERNS HAVE CHANGED         
 DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.   
 MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABROAD THAT LIVE
 IN OUR BLOCK. POPULAR PLACES TO VISIT 
 ARE SPAIN,GREECE AND ITALY.           
{"TRADES"}IS THE MAIN HOLIDAY PERIOD   
 WITH MANUAL WORKERS IN OUR AREA. THIS 
 LASTS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL
 HOLIDAYS TILL THE THIRD WEEK IN       
 JULY_ABOUT THREE WEEKS IN LENGTH. THE 
 SCHOOL HOLIDAYS LAST FOR ANOTHER THREE
 WEEKS.                                
 LOW COST AIR TRAVEL AND HOTEL         
 ACCOMMODATION MAKE IT AS CHEAP TO GO  
 ABROAD AS A SIMILAR HOLIDAY IN THE    
 U.K. THE RESULT OF THIS IS THAT LOCAL 
 HOLIDAY RESORTS ARE FALLING INTO A    
 STATE OF DECAY.
