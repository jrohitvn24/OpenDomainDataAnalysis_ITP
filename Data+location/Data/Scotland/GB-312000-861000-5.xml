		<title>05PLAYGROUND GAMES IN ALVES</title>
		<content> The most popular playground games that
 my friends and I play are 'Joined Tig'
 'Skipping' and 'Stick in the Mud'.The 
 game that is played most by girls is  
 skipping.We use a long piece of rope  
 with one person turning each end of   
 it.Somebody jumps in and starts to    
 skip. When that person stops the rope 
 , somebody else goes in.              
 Another game girls play is Joined Tig.
 To play this game one girl stands in  
 the middle of the playground and then 
 she tries to catch somebody. When she 
 does they both hold hands and try to  
 catch someone else. This will carry on
 until there are four people standing  
 in a row and then they will split into
 two pairs. The first one caught starts
 the game again.
