		<title>15Toftcarl Water Filter Plant</title>
		<content> Toftcarl filter station overlooks the 
 town of Wick which it has been supply-
 ing with water since 1883.The source  
 of water is Loch Yarrows which lies   
 5.1km.to the south.Its catchment area 
 is the uncultivated hilly ground, con-
 sisting of heather clad peat soil and 
 giving the water its acid content.    
 The water is gravity fed from Loch to 
 filter station to town.               
 The first stage of purification is the
 addition of two expensive chemicals:  
 Aluminium Sulphate and Magnafloc which
 cause the formation of sludge-disposed
 of in Hempriggs loch!!                
 Next is the addition of Chlorine as a 
 sterilising agent and Lime as a Ph.   
 adjuster and finally filtration       
 through sand.Then storage in an       
 underground reservoir.                
 Town consumption is recorded daily.   
 Thrumster is supplied from Loch Calder</content>
