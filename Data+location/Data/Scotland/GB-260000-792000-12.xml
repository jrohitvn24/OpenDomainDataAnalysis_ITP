		<title>12Religious Beliefs in Laggan</title>
		<content> The present congregation of the       
 presbyterian Church of Scotland are   
 this year celebrating the 200th       
 anniversery of the present building.  
 The site of a previous church has been
 found at Blaragie Farm. The Minister  
 now serves the parish of Newtonmore as
 well as Laggan. With Laggan including 
 Dalwhinnie &amp; Loch Laggan, the Minister
 at present travels the widest parish  
 in Scotland. This is the only         
 congregation with a church in which to
 worship. Those of the catholic faith  
 have to travel to Kingussie to attend 
 mass. There was a catholic church at  
 Crathie (see History) seating 200     
 every Sunday. De-population caused it 
 to be closed and demolished and taken 
 to Elgin. As far as is known          
 christianity is the only religion     
 practised in Laggan.
