		<title>14ACCOMODATION IN GRANTOWN</title>
		<content> Grantown-on-Spey has a wide variety of
 accomodation to suit all types of     
 visitor.  Tourism in Grantown grew in 
 the Victorian era and several large   
 hotels were built then for the        
 visitors. These include The Grant     
 Arms, where Queen Victoria stayed, The
 Palace, The Garth, The Craiglynn and  
 The Strathspey Hotel.                 
                                       
 Large houses were also built about    
 this time, many of which are now used 
 as boarding houses or small licensed  
 hotels.  During the summer many houses
 do "Bed and Breakfast" for visitors.  
                                       
 Recently a well appointed camp and    
 caravan site has been completed, with 
 a shop and full facilities.  Rented   
 accomodtion is also available and a   
 development of holiday flats has      
 recently been completed.              </content>
