		<content>{ St John's Masonic Lodge }was built in
 1765.  It looks over  Ceres  Burn  and
 Bishop's Bridge.  It  was  allowed  to
 deteriorate but because of its  beauty
 and  position  in the village, Central
 and North Fife  Preservation  Society,
 working  together  with  the  National
 Trust  for  Scotland,   purchased  the
 building and its grounds and carried  
 out renovations in 1964. It is now    
 used as a dwelling house.             
                                       
{ Bishop's  Bridge}was so named because
 Archbishop  Sharp crossed over it just
 before being  brutally killed on Magus
 Moor by Covenanters in 1679.          
  The 17th  century bridge enhances the
 beauty of this part of the villge  and
 serves now as a means of reaching  the
 High Street from the recently improved
 car park.
