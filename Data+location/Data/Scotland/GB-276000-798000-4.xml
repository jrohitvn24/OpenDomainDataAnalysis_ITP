		<title>04FARMING IN BADENOCH - 1</title>
		<content>{Farming}in this area is mixed due to  
 the variety of terrain. {Beef and     
{mutton}are the main products.  A farm 
 of say about{six hundred acres}would  
 support about seventy cows and calves 
 along with twice as many sheep.  About
 one seventh of this land would be used
 for growing{barley, potatoes, turnips 
{and hay}for the farm's own use.  Some 
 local farmers benefit from free       
 grazing on part of the{RSPB Reserve.  
                                       
 Whereas{twenty years ago}the farmer   
 would have employed about{six men}he  
 can now run it basically on his own,  
 calling on neighbouring farmers for   
 help when necessary, eg at harvest.   
 Big farm machinery, such as combine   
 harvesters, is hired from neighbours  
 when needed.
