		<title>01A REVIEW OF CATTERLINE</title>
		<content>                                       
 Our village of Catterline is 6 miles  
 south of Stonehaven. It has a small   
 school with 27 pupils. Last year a    
 youth club was started. It is very    
 good. Seven new houses are in the     
 process of being built in a field next
 to the school. The highest point in   
 our area is 148m above sea level. It  
 is called "St John's Knap". There is a
 burn that flows past Catterline to the
 sea, passing an old mill. There are a 
 lot of farms in our area and fishing  
 takes place. There is only one small  
 green fishing boat. There is also an  
 inn called the Creel Inn. Quite a few 
 artists have also lived in Catterline.
 A bird sancturay is situated on a     
 cliff by Crawton. So you can see our  
 area is very interesting.
