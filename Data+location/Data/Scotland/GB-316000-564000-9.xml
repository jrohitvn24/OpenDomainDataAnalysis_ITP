		<title>09Fishing on the Solway Firth</title>
		<content>   The{haaf net}fishermen  use  a      
 beam and net.The beam is 16 feet long 
 and is made from very strong wood.    
     The fishermen go out to the       
 channel in the{Solway}where they      
 draw position to fish. This is done by
 building small heaps of sand, one for 
 each man. One fisherman turns his back
 while the rest select a pile each. He 
 is then given the signal to turn round
 and kick out one of the piles of sand.
 The man who owns this pile of sand has
 the first choice of position, and so  
 on. The men then stand in a line      
 across the channel facing the flow of 
 water and the fish swim into the net. 
 The fisherman must be careful when    
 fishing the{incoming tide}(known as   
 the flood) because the water runs fast
 through different channels in the     
 sand.
