		<title>19Bats in Ceres</title>
		<content>  Although pipistrelle bats  are  often
 seen in Ceres little was known of them
 until  a recent  survey,  carried  out
 by The University  of  St Andrews, led
 to  the  discovery  that their nursery
 area was in  the  attic  of  Woodburne
 Cottage, Ceres.                       
                                       
  Anna Hutton,  a former pupil of Ceres
 School, who lives in the cottage, took
 part in the survey and counted over 90
 bats leaving a small opening above her
 bedroom window.                       
                                       
  She and her mother say that they  are
 proud to  have  these  visitors  share
 their roof  and  that  they  cause  no
 trouble at all.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
