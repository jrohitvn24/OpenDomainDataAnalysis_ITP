		<content> The three J's (Jute,Jam &amp; Journalism) 
 were the three major industries in    
 Dundee;all are still present today.   
{  JUTE:}Probably the main industry.   
 Strathern Road in Broughty Ferry was  
 claimed to be the richest mile in the 
 world-{"Millionaires' Mile".}This was 
 where the{"Jute Barons"}who owned the 
 Dundee Mills had their mansions.Now,  
 however,only one factory producing    
 jute only remains in Dundee:{Manhatten
{Works}employ 400 workers and produce  
 180_200 tons of jute per week.        
{  JAM}: The most famous of the jam    
 makers was by Keillor of Dundee,      
 credited with the invention of        
 marmalade and now owned by Okhai.     
{  JOURNALISM}: A major employer:  D.C.
 Thomson, a printer and publisher with 
 a world-wide circulation, is based in 
 Dundee. Among their 71 titles are the 
 Dandy,Beano and Sunday Post.          </content>
