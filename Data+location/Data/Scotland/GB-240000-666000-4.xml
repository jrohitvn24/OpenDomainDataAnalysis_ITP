		<title>04RECENT HOUSING</title>
		<content> In the last 15 years there has been   
 private housing development on the    
 site of the former manor house        
 estate. Building has also taken place 
 on former farmland.                   
 The estates consist of semi-detached  
 and detached houses with adjoining    
 gardens. The houses are well appointed
 inside and are constructed mainly of  
 brick with roughcast or stone         
 facings.The more expensive houses have
 integral garages, split level design  
 and individual character. The former  
 estate land has been landscaped to    
 provide an attractive, partly wooded  
 environment with the provision of     
 playgrounds and walkways. The estates 
 are well served by avenues and        
 cul-de-sacs connected to new roads.The
 new village planning is trying to     
 retain the former rural character of  
 the area.                             </content>
