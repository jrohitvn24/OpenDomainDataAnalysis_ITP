		<title>13FARMING IN GORDON</title>
		<content> In our area of study the farming is   
 mainly a mixture of growing crops and 
 raising animals.In Gordon alone there 
 are 2 farms called Gordon Cottage     
 owned by Mr Browne and West Mains     
 owned by Mr Bell.Also in our rectangle
 there are 7 other farms.Mr Browne     
 finds farming hard work because he is 
 getting old.He's always wanted to be a
 farmer because he thinks it's a job   
 that you can be your own master.The   
 livestock is 80 cows and their        
 calves.It is about 50 hours a week he 
 works and roughly 7 hours in a day,   
 apart from the silage,hay and potato  
 seasons.2 people are employed by Mr   
 Browne and he finds them very         
 helpful.The worst thing that has ever 
 happened to him was when he drove the 
 pick-up into the tractor and left a   
 big dent in the pick-up.
