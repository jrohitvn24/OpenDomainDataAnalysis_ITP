		<title>07The Local Maternity Hospital</title>
		<content> The William Smellie in Lanark is the  
 local Maternity Hospital. Mothers     
 from quite far away come to the       
 hospital. William Smellie was a famous
 gynaecologist who lived in the late   
 seventeenth century and early         
 eighteenth century. The hospital which
 was built in 1897, originally belonged
 to the Lockhart family who donated    
 their home as a hospital. There have  
 been extensions built, and in all,    
 there are fifty two rooms. there are  
 about fifty babies born each week in  
 the hospital. Caesarian operations are
 not very common, only about eight per 
 cent of the births. The average time  
 for a mother and child to stay in     
 hospital is five days, all going well.
 Not very many nurses live on the      
 premises but some do. fathers can stay
 at the birth if they want to, the     
 hospital encourages this.             </content>
