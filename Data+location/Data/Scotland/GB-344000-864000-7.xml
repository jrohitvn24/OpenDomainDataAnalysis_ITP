		<content>      MR. JAMES GRANT, FROM RATHVEN,   
 WORKS AT HERD AND MCKENZIE'S SHIPYARD 
 IN BUCKIE.  HE IS A MARINE ENGINEER   
 FOREMAN.  THERE ARE 88 PEOPLE EMPLOYED
 AT HIS SHIPYARD.                      
      DIFFERENT SKILLS ARE NEEDED TO   
 BUILD A BOAT.  NEEDED ARE PAINTERS,   
 ELECTICIANS, WELDERS, JOINERS,        
 PLATERS, SHIPWRIGHTS, RIVETERS AND    
 BLACKSMITHS.                          
      THE MOST TYPICAL BOAT BUILT IS   
 THE SEINE NET FISHING BOAT.  THE KEEL,
 STEM AND STERN POST ARE LAID FIRST.   
 OAK FRAMES ARE FIXED TO THE KEEL THEN 
 LARCH PLANKS ARE FIXED TO THE FRAMES. 
      IN JUNE 1985, THERE ARE SEVEN    
 BOATS ON THE SLIP.  ONE OF THEM IS THE
 MORNING PRINCE.                       
      A NEW BOAT COSTS AN AVERAGE OF   
 Â£500,000.
