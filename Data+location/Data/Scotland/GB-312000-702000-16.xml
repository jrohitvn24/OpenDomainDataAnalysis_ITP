		<content>    The{District Nurse}in Milnathort   
 visits the old people and mothers with
 very young children. She sees the boys
 and girls at the primary school, too. 
 Her house is in Linden Park Terrace   
 and she has an answering machine that 
 you have to talk to in she is not in. 
 The Nurse came to Milnathort a  short 
 time ago and had to find her way to   
 the houses she visits on her rounds.  
    There are no{doctors' surgeries}in 
 our block, but the doctors in{Kinross 
 cover the whole of this area and much 
 more. If your own doctor can't come,  
 then one of the other four will.      
    Dr Derek Anderson has a green light
 on his car and he goes to help where  
 there has been a road accident.       
    There are no{dentists}in our block.
    A{chiropodist}visits the district  
 now in a new mobile clinic.  Children,
 as well as older people attend it.    </content>
