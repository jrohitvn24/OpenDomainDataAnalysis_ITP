		<title>20Kelso Square</title>
		<content> Kelso Square is in the centre of Kelso
 and is one of the most interesting    
 parts of the town. In days gone by,   
 the Square used to be a{marketplace   
 and you can still see the{bullring    
 where the bulls were tied up on market
 days. The Square was built in{1816    
 although some of the buildings are    
 older. In 1962, the{Queen and Prince  
{Philip}visited our Square. They put   
 some commemorative coins in the casket
 below the bullring. The{British       
{Council of Archaeology}has declared   
 Kelso a town of architectural value - 
 the only one in the Borders. Nowadays 
 the Square is used for all sorts of   
 events like parades, charity stalls,  
 displays, pipe bands and dancing. The 
{Town Hall}and the{Cross Keys Hotel,   
 which used to be a stopping point on  
 the London-Edinburgh stagecoach route,
 are the most important buildings.     </content>
