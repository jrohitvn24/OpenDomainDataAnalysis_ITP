		<title>02ACADEMY AND HOUSING</title>
		<content> In Stromness a new Academy is being   
 built at Garson. As it's only being   
 built in sections it won't be finished
 till 1988, so both old and new schools
 are used meantime with pupils being   
 bussed between. There's four houses - 
 Thorfinn, Magnus, Sigurd and          
 Rognavald. 41 teachers, 1 headmaster,2
 technicians, 2 janitors, 1 librarian, 
 2 secretaries and a nautical          
 instructor keep the pupils busy.      
 The design of the new school, its     
 being rather like warehouses from the 
 outside, has caused local comment.    
 Usually when any building is done in  
 Stromness the style of the house must 
 fit in with its surroundings. Many    
 houses have a preservation order on   
 them. A housing scheme at Grieveship  
 was designed to resemble Stromness'   
 jigsaw puzzle of older housing, but   
 many are critical of it.              </content>
