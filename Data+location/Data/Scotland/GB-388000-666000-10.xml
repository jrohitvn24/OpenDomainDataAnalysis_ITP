 CAME ON LOCATION TO ST ABBS .AS PART  
 OF THE FILM, THERE WAS A HUGE         
 EXPLOSION AND FIRE AT THE BIG         
 VICTORIAN HOUSE,NORTHFIELD. THE FILM  
 COMPANY BUILT FALSE WALLS AND A STABLE
 BLOCK OUT OF FIBERGLASS.THEY LOOKED   
 VERY REAL BUT SOUNDED HOLLOW WHEN YOU 
 TAP THEM.ONE OF THE STARS OF THE FILM 
 WAS A CHIMPANZEE CALED MANDY. WHEN    
 SHE CAME TO VISIT US IN SCHOOL, SHE   
 WORE A BLUE T-SHIRT AND RED SHORTS.   
 SHE WAS VERY FRENDLY AND GAVE US      
 KISSES AND SHOWED US HER TEETH.       
 WE GAVE HER BANANAS AND AN APPLE. SHE 
 PAINTED A PICTURE AND PRETENDED TO    
 READ A BOOK . SHE LIKED POLISHING THE 
 FURNITURE TOO. WE ENJOYED MANDY'S     
 VISIT VERY MUCH. ONE OF THE BOYS WAS  
 CHOSEN TO APPEAR IN THE FILM IN A     
 SMALL PART . IT WAS VERY EXCITING .   </content>
