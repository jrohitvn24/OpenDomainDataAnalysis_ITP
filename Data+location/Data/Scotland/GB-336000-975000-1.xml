		<content> Stroma is an island in the Pentland   
 Firth 3 kilometres north west of John 
 O'Groats in Caithness.                
 The Island is 3 kilometres long and 1 
 1/2-2 kilometres wide. It was         
 inhabited until the 1960s when its    
 economy declined and it was abandoned.
 There are several crofts and a school 
 all of which are now derelict. The    
 only inhabitants on Stroma now are 3  
 lighthouse keepers in the lighthouse  
 at the north end of the island at     
 Swilkie Point.                        
 Access to Stroma is difficult because 
 there is no longer any boat service.  
 This area of the survey only includes 
 the shore line on the east side of the
 island.
