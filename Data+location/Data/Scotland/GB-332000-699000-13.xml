		<title>13FOOD CHANGES IN MILTON.</title>
		<content> In Milton,home life to-day is quite   
 different from that of 50 years       
 ago.My gran says food,and even the    
 buying of food has changed.           
 Instead of going to town to shops like
 the grocers and butchers,she now shops
 in a Glenrothes{supermarket.}She does 
 not{shop daily}because she has a      
{fridge and a freezer}to keep things   
 fresh.Mum used to have dull meals of  
 soup,minced steak or mutton,potatoes, 
 carrots and cabbage,but now she makes 
 curried dishes with spices from{India 
 and{China,}or{Hungarian}goulash,or    
{Italian}dishes like pizzas,macaroni   
 and spahgetti.My sister and I like    
{American}sweetcorn and hamburgers.We  
 have a{microwave oven}which makes food
 cook quickly,because a magnatron      
 changes the energy into microwaves    
 that make the molecules jump,causing  
 friction then heat.                   </content>
