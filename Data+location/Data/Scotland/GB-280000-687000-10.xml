		<title>10POLICEMAN'S WORK PLEAN/COWIE</title>
		<content> "My name is William MacFarlane and I  
 am the{Community policeman}for this   
 area. My day usually begins at 9a.m.  
 although my hours are flexible to     
 cater for discretionary evening work. 
 My duties entail visiting schools     
 where I give talks on various subjects
 such as road safety etc. I am also    
 responsible for investigating any     
 crimes committed in my area. I patrol 
 much of the area on foot in order to  
 maintain close contact with the       
 people. In the evenings I frequently  
 attend Youth Clubs and Community      
 Council meetings. I also attend summer
 Galas and Fetes, in fact any occasion 
 where my presence would be of benefit 
 to the community."
