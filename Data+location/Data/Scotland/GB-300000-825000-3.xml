		<content>    The Square in Grantown has not     
 changed but the traffic has. All the  
 traffic was horse drawn.              
    There was a{horse drawn milk cart  
 that came round twice a day. You went 
 out with a milk can and your money and
 the man would fill the can with milk  
 for you.                              
    There were two{horse drawn buses.  
 There were no fire engines, just      
 barrows with hoses and a ladder.      
    The shops have changed quite a lot 
 over the years because there used to  
 be no supermarkets and the shops were 
 small.                                
    The Primary School is different in 
 that it used to be the Grammar        
 School as well.                       
    They played games we play now, like
 football, cricket and shinty.         
    There was a cinema on the site of  
 the British Legion.                   </content>
