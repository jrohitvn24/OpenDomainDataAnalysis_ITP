		<title>15CUSTOMS FORRES WEST</title>
		<content> Ryding of the Marches is one of the   
 oldest customs in Forres.             
 The Marches begin at Thornhill and    
 walk around the town.                 
 The ryders are dressed in different   
 uniforms and the horses have little   
 bo's and beads on them.               
 The Ryding of the Marches is very good
 to watch and the horses are well      
 trained.                              
 The Ryding of the Marches took place  
 this year 1985 on Sunday June 2nd.    
 The speech that was made was          
 broadcasted on Morayfirth Radio for   
 everyone to hear.                     
 The Marches were ridden on some of the
 following dates: June 13th 1558, June 
 22nd 1615 and April 24th 1649.        
 Sometimes,to gain more land, farmers  
 would shift the stones that marked out
 the land. This was checked for by     
 Provists, Baillies and Magistrates.   </content>
