		<title>18Wick Airport</title>
		<content> Wick Airport is the most Northerly    
 airport on the mainland of Scotland.  
 It is owned and run by the C.A.A.     
 It was a very important airport during
 the war but is very small now. It     
 employs about 15 fulltime workers and 
 3 parttime workers. There are 2       
 airtraffic controllers, 2 telecomm-   
 unications officers, 6 firemen and 1  
 office worker. Most of the passengers 
 are on business trips as the airfares 
 are expensive for private use.There   
 are about 160 passengers a day adding 
 up to 800 a week.Because the airport  
 is so small there are not a lot of    
 facilities but of course there is a   
 waiting room.There are 24 incoming and
 outgoing flights a day,to go all      
 over Scotland and sometimes to        
 England.In summer some flights go to  
 Denmark and Sweden with lobsters and  
 clams.                                </content>
