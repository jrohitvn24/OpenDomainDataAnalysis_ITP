		<content> The new Mackie moved to its present   
 site in 1969.It was designed to       
 accommodate 1000 pupils but the       
 1984/85 roll is 1754.The school is    
 overcrowded and there are 27 hutted   
 classrooms.                           
 Over 1000 pupils travel to Mackie by  
 bus but the new Portlethen Academy    
 should reduce this number by several  
 hundred.                              
                                       
 The Rector of Mackie,Mr J.Fraser, was 
 interviewed:_
