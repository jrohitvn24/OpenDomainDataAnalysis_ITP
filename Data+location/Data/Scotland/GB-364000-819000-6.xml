		<content> Throughout the year it is possible to 
 see at least 100 different species of 
 birds in the area. Some are spring and
 autumn migrating birds of passage,    
 mainly appearing in small numbers and 
 probably for very brief spells.       
 Many others are with us during summer 
 time only, travelling thousands of    
 miles from their winter habitats in   
 Africa to breed here. These include   
 the fish eating osprey which has,     
 during the last decade become a       
 regular annual visitor (an old Scots  
 Pine being its chosen nesting         
 place),the cuckoo,spotted fly catcher,
 sedge, willow and white-throat        
 warblers, whin-chat, swifts, swallows 
 and house martins.
