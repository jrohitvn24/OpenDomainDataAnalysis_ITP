		<title>07COMMUNITY CO-OPERATIVE.</title>
		<content> Kilchrenan Community Co-operative was 
 the first community co-perative to be 
 formed on the mainland of Scotland.   
 When the local shop was in danger of  
 closing down the villagers decided    
 that they would not like this to      
 happen and so they raised the         
 necessary capital by purchasing shares
 and with help from the H.I.D.B. the   
 co-perative was formed and the        
 premises were bought. It now consists 
 of a shop, post office, public bar,   
 petrol filling station and a tearoom. 
 It is run by a full time manager who  
 is responsible to the management      
 committee of shareholders and employs 
 one full time and 5 part time people. 
 The shop tries to cater for everyday  
 needs as the nearest town is 19 miles 
 away, and the bar and tearoom tries to
 cater for the holiday trade of the    
 area as well as the villagers.        </content>
