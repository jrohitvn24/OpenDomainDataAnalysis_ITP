		<title>14The Peoples of Deeside</title>
		<content> To this writer there appear distinct  
 groups of people within the locality. 
 These groups have an identity which   
 they maintain through their attitudes 
 and behavior. While they will         
 interrelate through common interest   
 activities, individuals, families and 
 neighbourhoods display cohesion and   
 often prejudice of a social nature.   
 There are stolid, native Deesiders who
 display the confidence of their roots 
 in successive generations. There are  
 those who have retired to the locality
 from professional employment, often   
 military. There are the nouveau riche 
 of oil-related employment who have    
 moved to the area as an attractive    
 place to settle and bring up family   
 amongst the advantages of quality     
 housing, good and convenient education
 and a safe and stimulating            
 environment.                          </content>
