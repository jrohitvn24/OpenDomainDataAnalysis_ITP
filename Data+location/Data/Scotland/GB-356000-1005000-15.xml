		<content> During the summer a men's{soccer}team 
 takes part in competitions at parish  
 and league levels. The younger women  
 combine with the adjoining parish to  
 play{hockey}and those who play        
{badminton}must do likewise. Many of   
 the young girls are keen participators
 in all events held by the district's  
{Pony Club.}During winter there are    
 facilities available in the Parish    
 Hall for playing{table tennis, carpet 
{bowls, darts and pool.}Here, also,    
 some senior citizens revive the       
 almost forgotten{dances}from their    
 youth. The young people also enjoy the
{discos}where there is plenty of loud  
 up to date music and flashing lights. 
 Many keen{gardeners}in the Parish take
 a pride in beautifying their gardens  
 and surrounding roadsides, besides    
 growing indoor plants.
