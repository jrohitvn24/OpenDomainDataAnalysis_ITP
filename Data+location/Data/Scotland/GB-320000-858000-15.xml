		<title>15Weather In The Birnie Area.</title>
		<content>  Birnie is situated near the Moray    
 Firth and as such, enjoys mild weather
 . For approximately 300 days each year
 the prevailing winds are from the west
 . As the Cairngorm Mountains lie only 
 fifty miles to the West, the Moray    
 Firth area finds itself in a Rain     
 Shadow Area. That is, the annual      
 Rainfall figures for Scotland are;    
 West Coast, 60 inches, Cairngorms,    
 100 inches, Moray Firth 25 inches.    
  Winter temperatures in the Moray     
 Firth area are frequently higher than 
 the surrounding district and roads are
 rarely blocked by snow unlike the     
 roads to the South and East.          
  This favourable climate is popular   
 with the local people, farmers and the
 many tourists who visit the area.
