		<content> Collessie situated about 10 km. from  
 Cupar has been a settlement site since
 Bronze Age. The history of the village
 is borne out by the numerous old      
 cottages, some still with thatched    
 roofs. These small cottages are set in
 very attractive surroundings and are  
 in an excellent state of repair. The  
 building materials are a mixture of   
 sandstone and local whinstone since   
 Collessie lies on a geological        
 boundary between these two rock types.
 The older housing mixes well with     
 three modern bungalows which have been
 built using brick and harling.        
 The amenities in the village are very 
 limited with only 1 telephone box, 1  
 post box and a village hall. Collessie
 church which stands at the centre of  
 the village is built of local         
 sandstone and it sits prominently on a
 mound surrounded by an old graveyard. </content>
