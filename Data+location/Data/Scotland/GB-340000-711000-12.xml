		<content>   Sport is the  most  popular  pastime
 with  younger   people  but  the older
 generation like   gardening,  watching
 television,    do-it-yourself      and
 needlework.   There are clubs to  suit
 all ages.                             
  Because most gardens in the area  are
 large,  many  people spend up  to four
 hours gardening each week  during  the
 summer months.                        
  Birdwatching, horse  riding,  cycling
 and exploring  other areas  by car are
 other interests.  More than 50% of the
 residents  said   that  they   enjoyed
 walking in the area.                  
  Fishing for brown trout in Ceres Burn
 is  popular  with local  and  visiting
 anglers.                              
  There is a  newly  resurfaced  tennis
 court and a disused curling pond.     
  Ceres Half Marathon attracts hundreds
 of visiting runners each August.      </content>
