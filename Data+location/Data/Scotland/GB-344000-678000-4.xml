		<content> include many grasses, marsh marigolds,
 spearmint, viper's buglass,           
 meadowsweet, etc.  A comprehensive    
 account of all life to be found within
 the area of the Reserve is to be found
 in the The Management Plan as         
 published by East Lothian District    
 Council (in 1977) who administer the  
 Reserve on behalf of the local people.
                                       
 The Reserve is open to the general    
 public at all times, though access may
 be denied to certain areas at specific
 times of the year (i.e. in the nesting
 season).  In order to reach the       
 Reserve visitors cross the Peffer by a
 long wooden footbridge (some 200      
 metres in length), one of the longest 
 in the land which is under great      
 pressure from the sea particularly at 
 high tides in a north-west wind.
