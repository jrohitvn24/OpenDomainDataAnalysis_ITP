		<title>05EDINBANE SCHOOL - PRESENT</title>
		<content> Today the twenty pupils in Edinbane   
 Primary are taught in two classes     
 until they transfer top Portree High  
 School after Primary Seven. They enjoy
 lessons from the visiting art teacher 
 and Gaelic teacher for this school is 
 taking part in the Bilingual Project. 
 As in city schools we have computer   
 lessons, television, tape recorders   
 and radio, but we also have the moor, 
 river, hillside and woods for outdoor 
 work and games. In basic subject the  
 children progress at their own rate,  
 while in others a three or four year  
 cycle of lessons is used. Today       
 children are healthy, well-dressed,   
 well-fed and full of energy. They are 
 keen members of the Junior Red Cross  
 and enjoy visiting the old folk in    
 Gesto Hospital.
