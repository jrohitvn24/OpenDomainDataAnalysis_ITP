		<title>13THE DORNOCH FIRTH BRIDGE</title>
		<content>{The A.9 is the main route from        
{Edinburgh to Wick.}It bypasses        
 Inverness and it goes over the Kessock
 Bridge and the Cromarty Firth Bridge. 
 The road then goes via Tain and on    
 round the{Dornoch Firth,}passing      
 through{Bonar Bridge.}To shorten the  
 journey north a bridge is going to be 
 built across the Dornoch Firth. Then, 
 this year (1985) a proposal was made  
 for a railway line to go over the     
 bridge also.                          
       A lot of tourists on the A.9    
 call in at Bonar Bridge and when the  
 bridge is built it might take a lot of
 the summer trade away from Bonar. The 
 hotels would suffer from lack of      
 trade. The other businesses would also
 suffer. So the{Community Council}are  
 going to look into the problem of     
 attracting tourists to the area.
