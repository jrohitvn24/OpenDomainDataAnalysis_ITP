		<content> Papay is ideally situated as a resting
 place for the Spring and Autumn       
 migration to and from North Europe.   
 Rarities such as Mandarin Ducks,      
 Bee-Eaters, Scops Owl and Ospreys     
 have been sighted. Large numbers of   
 Kittiwakes,and Fulmars breed on the   
 Reserve at the north of the island.   
  This reserve also has the largest    
 colony of Arctic Terns in Europe where
 between 5 and 6 thousand pairs nest   
 each year.                            
  In the winter months there are large 
 numbers of Golden Plover,             
 Curlew,Field Fare and Redwing. During 
 the Spring and Autumn many small birds
 such as Blackcap, Gold Finches        
 and Warblers pass through on their    
 migration.
