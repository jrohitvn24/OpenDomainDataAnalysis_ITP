		<content> The information on the previous pages 
 was jointly prepared by the pupils of 
 primary 7, Brediland Primary, Paisley 
 and first year of St Aelred's High    
 School.                               
 We would also like to thank the       
 various members of the Glenburn and   
 Foxbar community without whose        
 co-operation the project would not    
 have been possible.                   
 All staff, pupils and members of the  
 community who took part in the survey 
 felt that it was a rewarding and      
 worthwhile exercise.                  
 We hope that the information herein   
 will be of interest to anyone using   
 this disc in the future.
