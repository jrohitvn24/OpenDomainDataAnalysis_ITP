		<title>11More Interesting Names</title>
		<content>    Quite near to Galabank are two     
 short streets of old houses called {  
{Albert Place }and {Alexandra Place,}  
 which were named after members of the 
 Royal family of the time. These names 
 give a good clue as to when these     
 houses were built.                    
    Before and after the Second World  
 War, the Annan Town Council, which no 
 longer exists, built many streets full
 of council houses. Some of these      
 streets are in our area and we found  
 out that quite a lot of them were     
 named after people who were on the    
 council at the time.  Some examples   
 are {Graham Avenue, Tweedie Terrace,  
{Thorburn Crescent, Wallace Crescent,  
{Dykes Avenue, Matheson Terrace}and    
{MacNeish Drive.}The same thing        
 happened in another part of the town, 
 so many of the councillors had streets
 named after them.                     </content>
