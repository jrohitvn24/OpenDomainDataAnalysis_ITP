		<title>01 ALYTH, PERTHSHIRE</title>
		<content> This block lies on the North side of  
 the Strathmore Valley and has as its  
 main feature the Old Market Town of   
 Alyth .                               
      Alyth has a population in the    
 region of two thousand within the     
 borough boundaries although it is     
 greater when the surrounding Farms    
 are included.                         
      Running   from    west to east   
 through the block is Alyth Burn which 
 is a tributary of the River Isla which
 in turn flows into the River Tay.     
      Alyth Burn as it flows through   
 the centre of the town bounds the West
 side of Commercial Street and edges   
 the East side of the Town Square.The  
 burn is fairly rich in fish and the   
 presence of many trout to be seen as  
 the Burn flows alongside the pavement 
 of Commercial Street is very          
 attractive indeed.                    </content>
