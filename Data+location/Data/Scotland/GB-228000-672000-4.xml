		<content>{Glenbrae Road Farm} is over 100 years 
 old.  It is owned by Mr and Mrs Bowes.
 It is a {poultry} farm with 3000 hens 
 and 3 cockerels.  Mr Bowes also has 5 
 pet ponies and 3 dogs.                
 The {animals} are fed twice a day.    
 Cow byres have been made into boarding
 kennels for dogs.                     
 No {crops} are grown, except for their
 own use, because there is a shortage  
 of land.  It hasn't always been a     
 small farm.  65 years ago land was    
 sold for housing and later to house   
 the waterworks.                       
 Mr Bowes enjoys farming.  He always   
 wanted to be a farmer.  Although the  
 farm is so close to the houses, he    
 says he doesn't have any trouble.  He 
 thinks that it is very pleasant       
 working with animals.
