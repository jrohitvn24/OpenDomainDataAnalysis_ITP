 houses in Scotland.On this old side of
 the building there is a door with 1593
 marked on it ,this was when the house 
 was built.Pitkerro house has been     
 owned by many people,for instance{Mary
{Queen of Scots}lived there she planted
 a tree which is still standing in     
 1985. It has grown so big it has      
 split its bark.A great author named   
{Charles Kingsley}also lived in        
 Pitkerro House.Pitkerro house was     
 one of the first buildings to have    
 electricity,used for lighting only.   
 The power came from a battery in the  
 battery house to the left hand side   
 of the building. But since being a    
 listed building it cannot be touched.
