		<title>01LOCHGOILHEAD-A SUMMARY</title>
		<content> Lochgoilhead is a small village in    
 Argyll about 60km WNW of Glasgow.It is
 situated at the head of Loch Goil,a   
 sea loch.In winter the loch often     
 lives up to its Gaelic name,which     
 means{stormy.}The houses are built on 
 the narrow ribbon of flat land along  
 the shores.                           
 The hills around the village are high,
 rugged and steep;some of them reaching
 over 700m.Much of the hills is covered
 with conifer plantations but some     
 natural woodland remains.The hills    
 drop steeply to the loch which is     
 narrow and deep.                      
 The routes into the village by road   
 either through{Hells Glen(B 839)}or{  
{Glen Mor(B 828).}The roads,which are  
 single track,twist and turn their ways
 through the glens.Despite this the    
 village is popular with tourists.
