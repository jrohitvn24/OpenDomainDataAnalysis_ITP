		<content> The block is fairly heavily wooded,   
 with coniferous plantations and       
 natural deciduous vegetation of trees 
 and shrubs.                           
 In the forestry plantations all the   
 trees are Sitka Spruce. They are      
 managed on behalf of Ellary and       
 Ormsary Estates by 2 independent      
 management organisations. Some are    
 newly planted, others are reaching    
 maturity.                             
 In the deciduous woods there are many 
 different trees. The varieties seen   
 include lime, sycamore, willow, ash,  
 alder, birch, hazel, oak, and rowan,  
 with possibly willow emerging as the  
 most common. There is also hawthorn,  
 rhododendron, viburnum,and gorse.     
 On the open hillside, heather is the  
 most common plant, with bog myrtle and
 bracken quite extensive.
