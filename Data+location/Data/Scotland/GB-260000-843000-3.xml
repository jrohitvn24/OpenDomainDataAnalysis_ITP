		<content>   On my croft we grow potatoes,turnips
 and cabbages. These take up two       
 fields. All my family help on the     
 croft. When we have picked the        
 vegetables we pack them in bags for   
 storage. Most of our produce is used  
 by my family but mum also takes some  
 to sell in the shops nearby. My dad   
 works during the day in Inverness. We 
 also have animals on the croft. My    
 favourite animals are two horses      
 called Whisper and Dougal. I go riding
 about twice a week. We all help to    
 look after the animals. We have       
 fifteen hens, thirteen ducks and three
 goats. The eggs are collected every   
 day. We keep some for ourselves and my
 mum gets orders from her friends for  
 eggs. I like living on a croft because
 there are lots of places to play and I
 like animals.
