		<content> The following apply to N.W. of block:-
   Planning. In a small (but fast grow-
 ing) community it is not surprising   
 that a watchful eye is kept upon prop-
 osed new development (most especially 
 the aspects of water supply &amp; increas-
 use of the roads).                    
   Roads.Until 10 years ago the village
 had a resident 'road-man' who cut the 
 verges and ensured clear and flowing  
 culverts. This is now not the case and
 altho' a mechanised cutter is sent at 
 intervals it can't replace an intimate
 knowledge of potential 'trouble spots'
   Water. E.E.C regulations have meant 
 that our water is now 'chlorine-laced'
   Dr's Surgery. Regular requests are  
 made to have a (visiting) surgery in  
 the village since at present one has  
 to travel (15 miles) to Lochgilphead  
 to see a Dr.(altho' obviously nurse or
 Dr. call on the seriously ill).       </content>
