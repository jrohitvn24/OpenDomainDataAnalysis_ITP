		<title>19Sports day in Norham</title>
		<content>    Preparation for the Childrens      
 Sports day in Norham starts many      
 nights before the "1st Saturday in    
 July" with the planning and making    
 of a crepe paper fancy dress.         
     The big day arrives, children     
 assemble on the "green" in their      
 finery to be judged. Half an hour     
 later they're back to t-shirts and    
 shorts ready for the races. Running is
 the easiest but sack races, egg and   
 spoon (using potatoes), obstacle,     
 3-legged and a Mums and Dads race     
 are also included in the agenda. Small
 cash prizes attracts participants.    
  After this everyone goes off to the  
 hall for tea, provided by the sports  
 committee and the Mums of competitors.
 Then it's all home to change for the  
 evening disco whilst Dads prefer to   
 stay on the green and compete in a    
 knock out Quoits competition.         </content>
