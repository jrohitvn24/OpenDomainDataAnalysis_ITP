		<title>16Leith Hall</title>
		<content> Leith Hall was built in 1650 and      
 originally belonged to the Leith-Hay  
 family. It now belongs to the National
 Trust for Scotland. On average,       
 between 30 and 40 visitors visit Leith
 Hall during a typical weekday in the  
 tourist season and roughly 140 at a   
 weekend. Leith Hall is only open to   
 visitors from May until September, and
 during this period guides are employed
 to conduct visitors around the        
 mansion. The building contains many   
 fine examples of furniture, art, china
 and jewellery from days gone by. As   
 well as viewing these items and       
 listening to the history of the       
 building and the Leith-Hay family,    
 most visitors also take time to walk  
 in the extensive and well kept gardens
 and footpaths through the woods which 
 form a large part of the mansion's    
 grounds.                              </content>
