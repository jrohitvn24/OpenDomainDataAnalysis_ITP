 typical weekend in my life.I am the   
 second eldest in my family of four    
 girls.My sisters names are Jennifer   
 Claire   and Lindsay  .On saturday we 
 watched T.V. while mum made the       
 breakfast-cornflakes and tea or       
 coffee.My dad works on a saturday     
 morning.He is a draughtsman.He came   
 home at twelve o'clock we helped mum  
 with the housework while he cut the   
 grass.After lunch Jennifer and I went 
 out to do the shopping.The two younger
 sisters played in the garden and mum  
 planted flowers.Dad was working on the
 car.My auntie Carol Anne gave us a    
 lift home in her new car.We played for
 a while then went in to set the table 
 for dinner we had chips,sweetcorn,    
 pineapple and gammon steaks.Later on  
 some of my relations visited us so I  
 went up stairs to watch Dynasty.      </content>
