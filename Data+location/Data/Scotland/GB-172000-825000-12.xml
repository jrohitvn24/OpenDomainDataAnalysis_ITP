		<content> In Kyleakin houses are mainly made of 
 stone but some are of wood.The oldest 
 houses have been standing since the   
 eighteen hundreds so they are drafty  
 and have been installed with windows. 
 Some of the houses have been made into
 flats so that two people can live in  
 the one house.Some of the houses have 
 been built all on one floor for the   
 old people.Most of the houses are     
 semi_detatched but the houses which   
 were built about two years ago are    
 beside each other but all different   
 sizes they are called terrace houses. 
 Quite a lot of houses are bed         
 breakfast houses and will take in     
 tourists,hikers or any people on      
 holiday.In the summer some tents are  
 put up at the sides of the football   
 pitch.
