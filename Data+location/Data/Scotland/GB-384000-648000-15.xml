		<content> A BUS COMES THROUGH THE VILLAGE TWICE 
 A DAY, ONCE IN THE MORNING AND ONCE IN
 THE AFTERNOON, EXCEPT ON SUNDAY WHEN  
 THERE ARE NO BUSES.   MOST PEOPLE USE 
 PRIVATE CARS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW 
 BUSES.   THE NEAREST RAILWAY STATION  
 IS AT BERWICK, ABOUT TEN MILES AWAY.  
                                       
 ALTHOUGH THE VILLAGE HAS ONLY ONE     
 SHOP, IT HAS SOME VANS CALLING.   THE 
 MILKMAN DELIVERS ON MONDAY, WEDNESDAY 
 AND FRIDAY.   THE BUTCHER COMES ON    
 TUESDAY AND FRIDAY AND THE FISH VAN   
 COMES ON A FRIDAY AS WELL.   THE      
 LIBRARY COMES EVERY SECOND WEDNESDAY. 
 THE DUSTBINS ARE EMPTIED EVERY        
 WEDNESDAY.   TWO COALMEN COME         
 ALTERNATE MONDAYS AND WEDNESDAYS AND  
 SOMETIMES A WINDOW CLEANER.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
