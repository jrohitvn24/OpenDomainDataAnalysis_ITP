		<title>08DALRY POLITICS</title>
		<content> A former mining community, with a high
 proportion of manual workers and      
 skilled craftsmen, Dalry has always   
 been predominantly socialist in its   
 voting habits.                        
{District and Regional councillors,}all
{Labour,}represent Dalry on Cunninghame
 D.C. in Irvine and Strathclyde R.C. in
 Glasgow.                              
 With the recent recasting of          
 Parliamentary constituency boundaries,
 the Garnock Valley was merged with    
 North Ayrshire and Bute, a traditional
 Conservative seat. Consequently, Dalry
 is represented at{Westminster}by a    
{Conservative M.P.}for the first time  
 in many years.                        
 Similarly, a boundary change has      
 altered representation in the{European
{Parliament.} However, a{Conservative} 
 M.P. at Brussels has been replaced by 
 a Labour M.P. for the first time.     </content>
