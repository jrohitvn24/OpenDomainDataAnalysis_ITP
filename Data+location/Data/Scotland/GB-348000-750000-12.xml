		<title>12HEALTH IN RESCOBIE</title>
		<content>{Health}in Rescobie is mostly in the   
 hands of the District Nurse who cares 
 for the ill,the terminally ill and    
 those who would otherwise go to       
 hospital. She also does{Midwifery}but 
 very few babies are born at home      
 (instead they are born at Ninewells)so
 she usually visits mum and baby after 
 they come home. On average she has 36 
 patients,mostly elderly,who are       
 referred to her by G.P.s. The amount  
 of visits a patient gets depends on   
 what is wrong with them. She works a  
 37.5 hr. week from 8-5 and is on duty 
 1 in 4 weekends. The District Nurse   
 also does{Emergencies}and carries a   
 medical pack in her car.{Problems}for 
 her are wounds not healing, long term 
 illness, not being able to reach      
 patients in bad weather (in cases like
 this Police helicopters are needed)   
 and finally patient acceptance.       </content>
