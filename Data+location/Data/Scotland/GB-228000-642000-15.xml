		<content>{KILWINNING ABBEY}-these fine buildings
 ,now alas in ruins are all that is    
 left of the great Abbey.The monks came
 with {ST. WINNING}(thought to be a    
 teacher of ST.COLUMBA)and established 
 a base about the year 640.Somewhere   
 around 1160 a local landowner,one of  
 the Normans who came to rule Scotland,
{SIR HUGH de MORVILLE gave money to    
{build the great KILWINNING ABBEY.}The{
{GABLE }of the south transept,the south
 wall of the nave,the arched gateway   
 from the cloisters into the nave,the  
 remains of the charter house and the {
 tower arch of the nave survived.      
{ABBEY parish church is a busy thriving
{church }with a hall nearby.The present
{church,built in 1774,}and the {BELL   
{TOWER }stand beside the ruins.The BELL
 TOWER was rebuilt in 1816 after it had
 been struck by lightning and fell     
 down.The bell rings out each Sunday.  </content>
