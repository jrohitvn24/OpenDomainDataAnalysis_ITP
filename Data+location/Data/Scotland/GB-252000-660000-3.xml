		<title>03BURRELL COLLECTION GLASGOW</title>
		<content> At the early age of 7 Wm Burrell      
 became really interested in all forms 
 of art;  and by the age of l5 he      
 had begun his own art collection.  All
 through his life Wm. collected all    
 forms of art and when he died in l958 
 he gave his art collection to the     
 people of Glasgow.  For years         
 arguments raged about finding a       
 suitable site for the collection.     
 Eventually it was decided that a      
 museum would be built in Pollok Park  
 for all his treasures which have been 
 valued at Â£lOOm.  A competition was   
 held for the design of the museum and 
 was won by a Glasgwegian architect Mr 
 Gasson.  The Queen opened the Museum  
 on 2lst Oct. l983 and in l985 it was  
 named UK Museum of the Year and had   
 overtaken Edinburgh Castle as         
 Scotland's leading tourist attraction.
 Glasgow is proud of the collection.   </content>
