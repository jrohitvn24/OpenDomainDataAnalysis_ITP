		<title>04What the river means to me</title>
		<content>  When it is a hot day, I like to go   
 into the water of the Spey to cool    
 down and  enjoy a picnic afterwards.  
    Some people go pearl fishing in the
 Spey. The R.A.F. Outdoor Centre and   
 the Secondary School sometimes take   
 their canoes out onto the river.      
    Years ago, logs used to be floated 
 down the river. The logs were tied    
 together and were collected where the 
 Spey joins the sea.                   
    I am really glad the river is      
 beside us. It attracts more tourists  
 to Grantown because of its scenery and
 fishers come to Grantoiwn because it  
 is so near the Spey.                  
    The river is fun to go swimming in 
 on very hot days. At other times it is
 quiet and peaceful.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
