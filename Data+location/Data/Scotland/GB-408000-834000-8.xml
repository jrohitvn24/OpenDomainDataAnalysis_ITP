		<content> My  class visited the brickworks.When 
 we arrived a man showed us round.     
 First of all he showed us the digger  
 which took out the clay and put it    
 into a machine which broke it into    
 small bits. Next we came to a conveyer
 belt and saw the small bits coming    
 through. At the end of the conveyer   
 belt there were big round concrete    
 crushers to flatten the clay. All the 
 machines were very noisy.             
       After that we went to the old   
 part of the building where they kept  
 the old things which they used to use.
     We were then shown the place where
 the clay is cut and made into pipes.  
 The pipes were all wet and slimy. They
 had to be cooked. We went to the oven.
 There was a great big tube which was  
 full of fire. This was to cook the    
 pipes. Altogether it was an           
 interesting afternoon.                </content>
