		<content> The majority of houses in this block  
 is made up of 2-storey houses with    
 sloping slated roofs.(For other types 
 see LANDSCAPE -URBAN-VILLAGE page 7). 
 The older houses in the district are  
 built of mason-shaped stone and lime, 
 most with the stone showing, but a few
 are covered with rough-cast.The more  
 recently built houses are constructed 
 of concrete blocks (cavity walls),and 
 the most recent houses (bungalows) are
 mostly of the timber-framed kit type  
 with tiled roofs. A few years back the
 cavity-walled council houses were     
 given extra insulation in the form of 
 polystyrene foam filling.
