		<title>01THE RIVER CREE ESTUARY</title>
		<content> The area is a tidal flood plain of the
 River Cree, containing saltmarsh, poor
 grazing land and hills on one side (to
 the east) and moorland and saltmarsh  
 (to the west) becoming water meadows  
 further upstream. The town itself war 
 built as a model village some 120     
 years ago, and consists of low-single 
 storey granite houses in the main.    
 There are one or two cottages dating  
 from the early 1800's and indeed the  
 High Street farms the A75 from        
 Dumfrier to Stranraer, soon to be     
 re-routed by the Creetown By-Pass.    
 There is not a lot of work in the town
 except roadbuilding and the stone is  
 quarried about 2km from the town.     
 There is a notable museum of          
 Gemstones with examples collected     
 worldwide by the owners themselves. It
 is fairly popular as a stopping off   
 place for discovering the area, there </content>
