		<title>11WOMEN IN HAWICK</title>
		<content> From the early days of this century   
 the hosiery and tweed, and later the  
 knitwear industry, provided more      
 female than male employment.  This    
 gave women an economic independence   
 which extended into their social life 
 and which has led to Hawick being a   
 hive of female activity in the        
 evenings.  In addition to golf,       
 tennis, badminton, swimming and       
 Guilds, women have come very much to  
 the fore in bowling, athletics,       
 cycling, fencing, short-tennis,       
 bridge, art, camera, cine-film, drama,
 music and country dancing clubs. Arch-
 aelogical and Horticultural Societies,
 Saxhorn Band and Operatic Society,    
 50+ and Hill Walking Groups, Red Cross
 Society, Gas and Electrical Assoc-    
 iations, and supervision in running of
 youth organisations further extend the
 opportunity for recreation.           </content>
