 over 6000 people.It could be described
 as a dormitory town for many people go
 to work in Glasgow,Hamilton or East   
 Kilbride.                             
         There are no large factories  
 in Strathaven and the largest source  
 of employment is Strathaven           
 Academy,though in this case a number  
 of those employed come from outside   
 the town.                             
          The main shopping area is the
 Common Green though the shops are     
 mosty small and most folk also shop in
 E.K. or Hamilton.There are four       
 churches,three primary schools and a  
 secondary here.The town lies a few    
 miles west of the A74/M74 route to    
 England.The surrounding area is mainly
 agricultural and a market is regularly
 held in the town.Strathaven Toffee is 
 a well known delicacy produced here.  </content>
