		<title>11CLUBS IN MADDERTY</title>
		<content> There is a branch of the Scottish     
 Women's Rural Institute which meets on
 the second Wednesday of the month from
 October to May in the Village Hall.   
 A recently formed club is the Young   
 Women's Group which meets on the first
 Tuesday of the month also in the      
 village hall.                         
 The Madderty Women's Guild associated 
 with the Abbey Church, meets on the   
 third Monday of the month from October
 to March.                             
 Up till three years ago a Youth Club  
 used to meet weekly in the village    
 hall but this was stopped due         
 to the lack of teenagers in the area.
