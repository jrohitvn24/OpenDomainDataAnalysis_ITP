		<content> This is predominantly an{AGRICULTURAL}
 area. It is known locally as{TEALING} 
 but settlement is scattered consisting
 of farms and two small nucleations -{ 
{KIRKTON OF TEALING}and {INVERALDIE.}  
 The oldest settlement is Kirkton of   
 Tealing and the church is of some     
 historical interest. The houses at    
 Inveraldie date from post-war times   
 when the RAF abandonned the airfield  
 near here. There is only one industry 
 of note - the{VEGETABLE PROCESSING}   
 plant at Inveraldie. A major new      
 development currently being carried   
 out is the improvement of the{A929    
{ROAD}from Dundee to Forfar and        
 Aberdeen. People living in the area   
 are either employed in farming or     
 commute to work in{DUNDEE}which is    
 only about 6km. to the south.
