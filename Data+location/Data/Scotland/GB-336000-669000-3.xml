 OFFICE.THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE IN THE    
 LIBRARY, A DRIVER AND A LIBRARIAN. I  
 HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE LIBRARY FOR

 TRANENT. THEY HAVE A SELECTION OF     
 BOOKS AND YOU GET TO KEEP THE BOOKS   
 FOR TWO WEEKS. SOMETIMES I GET TO TAKE
 ADULT'S BOOKS. ABOUT 50 PEOPLE GO TO  
 THE MOBILE LIBRARY  FROM
