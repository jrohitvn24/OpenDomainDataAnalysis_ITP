  We came out of St Mary's School and  
 we turned left. We walked  passed the 
 allotments. The allotments were there 
 from the first world war for the      
 people to grow food. We walked on. We 
 passed the Leith Franklin Cricket Club
 which was built in 1852. Then we      
 passed the Seafeild Bowling Club which
 was founded in 1883. We walked on     
 until we came to the bridge. We walked
 over the bridge until we could see the
 railway lines .Trains take goods from 
 the docks.We could see the Firth of   
 Forth where we saw the wreck of a     
 ship. We could see the Scottish       
 Agricultural Industries Building. Then
 we walked back off the bridge and we  
 went into the Seafield Cemetery.
