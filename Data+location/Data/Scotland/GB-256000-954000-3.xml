		<content> Primaries 1 - 4 at Tongue School re   
 corded the weather morning and after  
 noon for four weeks beginning 13.4.85.
 During this period it was very        
 overcast, clouds being recorded six   
 teen times with rain on nine of them. 
 However there were thirteen sunny     
 recordings but on the whole the       
 weather was cool  and the general     
 complaint was of low temperatures     
 for the time of year.                 
 The area though not as stormy as the  
 northwest corner, tends to be showery 
 with a fair amount of wind. If the    
 winds are from the north for any      
 length of time, vegetation suffers.
