		<content> WHIN WIR GRANDFAITHERS GEED TA SEA,   
 DA BOATS USED TA LIE IN DA VOE,       
 WHIN BIGGER BOATS CEM DEY WIRNA SAFE  
 SO TA EASTERDALE DEY HED TAE GO.      
 DA MEN HED NAE CARS TAE TAK DEM DERE, 
 AN WAKED WE BAITH RAIN AN SNA,        
 DEY MOST A BEEN A LOCK TUFER DAN FUN, 
 NOO FOK CAN HARDLY WAK AVA.           
                                       
 WHEN OUR GRANDFATHERS WENT TO SEA ,   
 THE BOATS USED TO LIE IN THE VOE,     
 WHEN BIGGER BOATS CAME THEY WERE NOT  
 SAFE                                  
 SO TO EASTERDALE THEY HAD TO GO.      
 THE MEN HAD NO CARS TO TAKE THEM      
 THERE,                                
 AND WALKED WITH BOTH RAIN AND SNOW,   
 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN A LOT TOUGHER     
 THEN,                                 
 FOR NOW THEY CAN HARDLY WALK AT ALL.
