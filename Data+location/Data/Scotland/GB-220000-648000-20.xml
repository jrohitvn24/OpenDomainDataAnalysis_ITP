		<title>20A DAY IN THE LIFE..(SEAMILL)</title>
		<content> I{wake up}at 7.30a.m. most mornings   
 (with a bit of help), get washed,     
 brush my teeth  and then go for       
 breakfast.  After this I pack my bag, 
 get my coat on and go out to wait for 
 the taxi to take me to{school. }Most  
 often we start with a short discussion
 of any interesting items of news and  
 then we get down to work.  In the     
 morning this consists of{Maths}and    
{English. }Sometimes we go to          
 television if the programme has       
 something to do with our class work.  
 In the afternoons we might do{History,
{Social Studies, Science, Geography or 
{Physical Education. }If the weather is
 nice, we go outside for P.E.  School  
 finishes for the day at 3.35p.m.  If  
 it isn't raining, I might go out to   
 play till teatime.  If it is, I'll sit
 and watch television for a while, do  
 my homework and then go to{bed.       </content>
