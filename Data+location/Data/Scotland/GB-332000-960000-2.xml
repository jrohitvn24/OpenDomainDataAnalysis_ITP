		<title>02THE BROCHS</title>
		<content> The first people may have lived in the
 area almost 4000years ago.  They left 
 behind{brochs,}three can be clearly   
 seen - 2 to the north of the harbour  
 and 1 beside the A9 100m. north of the
 village.                              
                                       
   A broch was a circular wall 5m.thick
 &amp; about 12m. high,with a low archway  
 through the wall for an easily        
 defended entrance leading to a        
 courtyard in the centre.              
                                       
   The Keiss brochs are clearly        
 visible,one of the ones on the shore  
 showing signs that it had been        
 enlarged at one stage.  At first it   
 was thought that the brochs were      
 places people ran to for protection,  
 but now it is thought that people     
 lived in the brochs all the time.
