		<title>02A CHILDS VIEW OF DUNLOP</title>
		<content> DUNLOP IS A SMALL VILLAGE IN AYRSHIRE 
 WHICH IS A QUIET PLACE. THERE ARE A   
 FEW ORGANISATIONS LIKE BROWNIES, CUBS 
 GYMNASTICS AND YOUTH CLUBS. THERE IS A
 LOCAL NEWSAGENTS THAT CLOSES IN THE   
 AFTERNOON BUT OPENS AFTER 3.00 AND    
 STAYS OPEN UNTIL 8.30 PM. THERE ARE   
 TWO PARKS (THE WEE SWING PARK AND THE 
 MAIN PARK). WHEN YOU ARE OLDER YOU CAN
 GO TO THE YOUNG FARMERS CLUB. WHEN YOU
 BECOME 26 YOU CAN JOIN THE RURAL. WHEN
 YOU LEAVE THE PRIMARY YOU HAVE TO     
 TRAVEL TO STEWARTON FOR YOUR          
 SCHOOLING. THERE IS A NEW SCHOOL      
 OPENED IN STEWARTON, STEWARTON        
 ACADEMY.IN DUNLOP THERE IS A CHURCH   
 AND BIBLE CLASS. THERE ARE LOVELY     
 PLACES TO WALK, LIKE THE "WEE GLEN"AND
 "WOODSIDE" AND I THINK DUNLOP IS A    
 NICE FRIENDLY VILLAGE AND WILL STILL  
 BE HERE IN 100 YEARS TIME.
