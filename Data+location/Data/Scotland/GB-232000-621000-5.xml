		<content>   Ayr Tourist Board was established in
 1982 in conjunction with Scottish     
 Board, District and Regional Councils 
 to promote Ayr as a{tourist centre.   
   Ayr caters for one and a half       
 million staying guests per year.      
 People are attracted to Ayr           
 through its connections with{Rabbie   
{Burns,}its excellent{golfing          
 facilities,{horse racing}and the      
 beautiful surrounding country.  The   
 bucket and spade holidays of the past 
 no longer bring in tourists but the   
 beach is still popular with trippers. 
  The pattern of holidays is changing, 
 people now visit Ayr as part of a     
 general tour of Scotland. Foreign     
 visitors are mostly North American    
 which underlines the importance of    
{Prestwick Airport.} If Ayr is to      
 expand its tourist trade massive      
 funding is required for facilities.   </content>
