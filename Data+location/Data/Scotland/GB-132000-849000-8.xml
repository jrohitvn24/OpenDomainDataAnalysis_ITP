		<title>08EDINBANE - PEAT CUTTING</title>
		<content> Many families rent part of a peat bog 
 to cut for fuel. The most difficult   
 job is turfing because we have to cut 
 through the heather roots to expose   
 the peat.  Using a spade we cut the   
 first row of peats. As they fall down,
 they are caught and thrown to the top 
 of the bog where they are spread out  
 to begin drying. For lower rows we use
 a peat-iron. When the peats have dried
 a bit we stand four on end to form a  
 pyramid and lay a fifth on top. This  
 allows the wind to dry them           
 thoroughly. Once the peats are dry, we
 take them home in a tractor-drawn     
 trailer. The big stacks are carefully 
 built so that rain cannot get in to   
 spoil the peats. This year some peat  
 has been cut by machine and is sold in
 sacks.
