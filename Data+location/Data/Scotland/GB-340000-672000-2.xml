		<content>{TRANENT}- Until recently most of the  
 housing in Tranent was provided by the
 council.They consisted mainly of      
 terraced villa-type houses and flatted
 villas.During the war there were two  
 'Pre-fab'schemes and now some of these
 are permanent homes through extensive 
 renovation.Two private housing schemes
 have attracted people to the town -   
 one at Carlaverock and one at         
 Bankpark.The waiting time on the      
 council list is about three years.    
 The housing stock in 1985 -           
 223 2apt,1130 3apt,641 4apt,46 5apt   
 Changes in legislation allows tenants 
 to buy houses.152 former tenants are  
 now home owners.There are no plans at 
 the moment for further building of    
 council houses because of the present 
 budget restrictions and cut-backs,but 
 a co-ownership scheme may be          
 developed in 1987.                    </content>
