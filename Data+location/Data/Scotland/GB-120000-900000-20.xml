		<content> The pages in this block have because  
 of the nature of this area mainly     
 centred on the village of{Rhenigidale.
 We have tried to give the reader a    
 taste of life in this isolated village
 which hopefully will soon be linked to
 the rest of the{Western Isles}by a    
 vehicular road. There is a lot of work
 going on outside throughout the day   
 with little time left for recreation. 
 We have televisions and radios etc.   
 and in the long, dark winter evenings 
 these entertain us as well as{ceilidhs
 in each others homes.                 
 We look forward to meeting you some   
 day. You might be surprised at the    
 far-flung countries we get visitors   
 from!
