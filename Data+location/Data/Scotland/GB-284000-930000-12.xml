 A lot of people from the south come to
 fish in our river. Near our school is 
 the Bannock Burn a tributary of the   
 Helmsdale River which is famous for   
 salmon. The six propietors who own    
 the estates own the river. Quite a few
 well known people have fished on the  
 Helmsdale-the Queen Mother, Prince    
 Charles and Princess Diana, the Duke  
 and Duchess of Glouster and the Duke  
 of Norfolk. The landowners have formed
 a river board which is responsible for
 maintenance and stocking of the river.
 Four waterbailiffs are employed to    
 make sure no one poaches. Local people
 are allowed to fish on part of the    
 river near our school. The river is   
 open for fishing from the 11th of     
 January to the 30th of September.
