		<content>        East Kilbride was once a small,
 quiet village with a low population.It
 was mainly fields with a few farms    
 around.After World War II there was a 
 population boom and new houses were   
 needed.East Kilbride was the chosen   
 site.Many houses and roads were built,
 also shopping centres,schools,swimming
 pool and dance halls.The villagers    
 were not pleased as it was not as nice
 but they were getting new shops better
 bus and train services and better paid
 jobs.The schooling then was different.
 You sat an exam in primary seven.The  
 results determined whether you went to
 the junior or senior secondary school.
 The junior school was for people who  
 expected to do a trade ,the senior    
 secondary school for people expected  
 to go to university. Today you dont   
 sit an exam to decide for you,but go  
 straight to secondary school.         </content>
