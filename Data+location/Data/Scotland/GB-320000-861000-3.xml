		<title>03Fashion in Elgin</title>
		<content>   Fashions in Elgin are changing      
 quickly.Some people like lots of      
 different colours that clash,some only
 a certian amount that match,and others
 like blacks and dark colours.Skirts   
 aren't worn as much as trousers(unless
 there so tight you can hardly walk)And
 of course they are worn to school.Ski 
 pants are realy tight cotton trousers 
 almost like tights with a strap to go 
 round the bottom of the foot.Shoe with
 thin heels are very popular with young
 people,and so are lightweight flat    
 ones.Hairstyles are sometimes pretty  
 unusal.There are spikey styles,rather 
 at the top front or sides.Some people 
 dye their hair,there is a whole range 
 of colours.People usually dye it      
 browns and reds but a few people are  
 more adventurous and dye theirs greens
 blues,and pinks.
