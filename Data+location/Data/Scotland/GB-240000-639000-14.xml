		<title>14Kilmaurs _ Village</title>
		<content> The centre of the village is a        
 Conservation Area and great care      
 has been taken to ensure that all new 
 building and renovation is in keeping 
 with existing buildings in order to   
 preserve the "Village" image.         
 There are three private housing       
 estates on the outskirts of the       
 village to the North, West and        
 South. Individual houses are being    
 erected in small vacant lots in and   
 around the village. Many of the larger
 mansion-type dwellings are of the     
 Victorian era. The majority of the    
 dwellings are council_owned,          
 outnumbering the privately-owned by   
 two to one, a situation which is      
 changing rapidly, owing to many       
 council tenants buying their homes.   
 Every class in the School has planted 
 a tree in a central site.
