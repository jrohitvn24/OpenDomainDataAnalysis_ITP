		<title>08HOUSING IN LITTLEMILL AREA</title>
		<content> The{vast majority of houses}in this   
 area are{farm houses or tied cottages.
 This results in the houses being      
 grouped together in small numbers     
 around the main farm house or close to
{it.Some of the cottages}still have{no 
{mains water for drinking and lack many
{of the things town people take for    
{granted.}The general design of these  
 buildings are single storey built with
 the natural stone available at the    
 time of construction.This type of     
 scattered housing does nothing to     
 develop community spirit but tends to 
 produce very self-reliant people who  
 depend upon no-one for assistance.Many
 of these cottages show litte          
 alteration since they were built.
