		<content> There is a marked difference between  
 this and lands to the North. Trees    
 plentiful and the land undulates      
 giving a pleasant view. Good farmland 
 with mixed farming. Best Buchan beef  
 is fattened on these lands.           
 Town dwellers have spread into private
 housing estates, also to Inverugie, a 
 real haven in this bleak corner of    
 Scotland.                             
 The River Ugie flows through wheat and
 barley fields, and is well fished, it 
 reaches the sea at Peterhead with a   
 golf course, beach and long esplanade.
 A heliport services North Sea Oil     
 platforms but gives no public service.
 Traffic is heavy - lots of families   
 have two cars. Virtually no           
 unemployment, light engineering and a 
 large supermarket gives work to a few,
 most are fishermen, oil related       
 workers or professional people.       </content>
