		<title>20HOUSING IN ARNPRIOR</title>
		<content> The houses of the Arnprior district   
 are mainly old and constructed of     
 stone.(The row of council houses were 
 built of steel in the 1950's.)There   
 have been no houses built recently.   
 Many of the farm houses date from the 
 late 19th century and some are much   
 older,the home farm-house being a     
 beautiful Georgian building. However, 
 many houses, including estate         
 cottages, have been extensively       
 modernised in the last year or so,    
 with standards of heating and         
 insulation being enhanced. Common     
 electrical household equipment        
 includes washing machines, tumble     
 driers, dish washers, tv's, videos,   
 fridge/freezers, cleaners, hair       
 driers, and micro-computers. The      
 internal environment combines the new 
 with the old. (Text by Mrs M Begg and
