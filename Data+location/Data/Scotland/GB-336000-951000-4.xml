		<content> Field of Noss Farm is situated just   
 North of Staxigoe.There are several   
 barns,a farm house and a garden along 
 with 750 acres of ground.Beef cattle  
 and sheep are the main stock.In some  
 of the fields crops are grown for     
 feeding the animals such as barley,   
 silage and turnip.For storing the     
 barley there is a moist grain tower.  
 Once the silage has been cut it is    
 stored in an open sided storage unit. 
 The cattle which are reared for beef  
 are Charolais and Aberdeen Angus.     
 There are 270 Cheviot sheep and there 
 is also a sheep dog for helping herd  
 them.                                 
 The 3 farm workers use various modern 
 machines to carry out the farm work.  
 There are tractors, combines, ploughs,
 a silage chopper and a four wheel     
 drive fork lift, to mention only a    
 few.                                  </content>
