 At Ythanwells School there are only   
 ten pupils and one full-time teacher, 
 Mrs Symon, who teaches maths,English, 
 writing, environmental studies and    
 crafts.We have three peripatetic      
 teachers for physical education, drama
 and music.Once a week we go to Huntly 
 for swimming. The school has three big
 rooms. We use one as a classroom with 
 tables put together, a computer,piano 
 and T.V.,and a library corner full of 
 books.The second room is used for P.E.
 and dining and in the third room a    
 stage can be put up for concerts held 
 by the pupils.Outside is a small foot-
 ball field  and grass to play on. The 
 school lunches are cooked at Drumblade
 and brought  by car.We spend 7 years  
 at Ythanwells Primary School, and then
 transfer to the Gordon Schools,       
 Huntly.                               </content>
