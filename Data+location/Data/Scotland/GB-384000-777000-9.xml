		<title>09FARMING AND CROPS</title>
		<content> In Catterline there are thirteen      
 farms. Barley is the main crop. Oil   
 seed rape is becoming more and more   
 popular every year. This year which is
 1985, the farmers have about five     
 times as much of this crop. Many      
 farmers this year are planting        
 potatoes and using them for seed and  
 selling. Turnips are not quite so     
 popular this year having been taken   
 over by the oil seed rape. Silage is  
 still being grown every year. Wheat   
 isn't so popular as it used to be.    
 Some of the fields are being used for 
 housing. Harvest time will soon be    
 here again.
