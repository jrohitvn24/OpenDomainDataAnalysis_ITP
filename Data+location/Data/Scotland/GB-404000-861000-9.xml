		<title>09The  Temperance  Walk</title>
		<content> The{first}walk was in the beginning   
 of the{19th}Century.It was originally 
 a{temperance}walk but now it's a      
 traditional part of village custom.   
 There are actually{three}walks,       
{Inverallochy,Cairnbulg,}and the{      
{St.Combs}one which nearly everyone    
 attends.In the past around fifty      
 people played in the band,with walkers
 behind.The oldest men of the village  
 would lead the walk then there would  
 be the band.They stop at the doors of 
 ill and very old people and play any  
 request from the relatives.           
 There are not very many places outside
{Buchan}which know about our walks.    
 Fluting classes are held for young    
 people to carry on the tradition.After
 the walk we go home and we have our   
 dinner.As the{Inverallochy}walk is on 
{Christmas}day they have a{Walk Dinner}
 instead of a{Christmas}one.           </content>
