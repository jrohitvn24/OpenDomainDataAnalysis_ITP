		<title>19Leisure Activities</title>
		<content> Many leisure activities are connected 
 with the church. The church has been  
 used for about 30 years for Sunday    
 School.                               
 They have a playschool as well. The   
 playgroup ages range from 3 years old 
 to school age. Recently the church was
 used for a drama group and sometimes  
 the Woman's Guild use it. Any other   
 uses will be considered. It is        
 possible that next year it will be    
 used for old people to meet and talk  
 about things. The hall at Kirkpatrick 
 Durham is used for coffee evenings and
 Ceilidhs. The old people go to the    
 fiddlers' concert where they can get  
 tea and cakes and talk to one another.
 Once in a while it is used for a      
 flower show where you get prizes for  
 your flowers and vegetables. If you   
 are lucky and win a prize a small     
 amount of money or trophy may be won. </content>
