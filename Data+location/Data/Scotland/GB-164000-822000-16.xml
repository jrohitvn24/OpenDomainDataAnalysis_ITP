		<title>16BROADFORD VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>{Broadford Village Hall}has three rooms
 plus a kitchen and toilets.It can seat
 two hundred and thirty people in the  
 main hall and the main clubroom can   
 seat fifty people.When extension work 
 begins this summer the kitchen will be
 made into a clubroom and a 126 square 
 metre extention costing approximatley 
 50 thousand pounds will provide cafe  
 facilities and can seat 170 people.   
 The present hall is used as an indoor 
 games centre and theatre to which     
 will be added showers and a new       
 kitchen. A new roof is to replace the 
 existing asbestos tiled structure     
 which leaks badly. A number of clubs  
 use the hall at present including the 
 drama club, badminton club, W.R.I.and 
 Brownies though many have left due to 
 the poor facilities.The hall's main   
 finances are derived from dances and  
 sales by outside agencies.            </content>
