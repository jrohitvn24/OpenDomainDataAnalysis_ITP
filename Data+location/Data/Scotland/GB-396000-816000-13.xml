		<title>13BEAUTIFUL BALMEDIE BEACH</title>
		<content> Our group feels that Balmedie beach is
 a very popular place. There are a lot 
 of sand-dunes about 20 metres high.   
 The children like playing on them and 
 jumping off into the soft sand. There 
 are shelves in the sea which means    
 there are different levels of water.  
 You must be careful when playing in   
 the sea , not to go too far out. There
 used to be a Ranger called Dan Hale   
 but he left and John Easton replaced  
 him. The rangers look after the plants
 and animals. There are army huts that 
 have survived since 1945. Many people 
 come to look at the sea. There are a  
 lot of picnic areas, people can have  
 barbeques on the beach. There are     
 barbeque pits which are supplied by   
 the rangers. There are walkways made  
 of planks which lead through the dunes
 to the beach.
