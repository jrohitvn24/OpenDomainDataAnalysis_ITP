		<title>13THE LIBRARY -IRVINE</title>
		<content> The library is in the same building as
 Cunninghame District Council and has  
 been there since 1977.There is one    
 professional librarian and four       
 assistants who are in charge of 67000 
 books.No fines are charged at the     
 moment.Records,newspapers and taped   
 stories for people with poor eyesight 
 can be borrowed also.The most popular 
 books were romance with {Catherine    
{Cookson,Virginia Andrews }and {Wilbur 
{Smith.}Defacing of books was the      
 biggest problem with dogs chewing and 
 even people cutting out pictures.     
{Future-}Unfortunately it was too far  
 away from the town centre and there   
 were plans to move it back.It is about
 1\ miles from our area to the library 
 and few people in our school visit it.
