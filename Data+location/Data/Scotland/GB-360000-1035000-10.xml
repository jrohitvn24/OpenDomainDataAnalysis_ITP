		<title>10FISHING</title>
		<content>{Very few fishermen}go to the{Westside 
 to catch lobsters or crabs because it 
 is a{very rocky place}with frequent   
 strong winds.During the{May to        
{September}period only{one boat}fishes 
 there for{lobsters and crabs,}but     
 during the{February to May}time{bigger
{boats}move around{from Eday and       
{Stronsay}to catch fish for lobster    
 bait in other areas. The main catch   
 consists of{lobsters}ranging from     
 about{1lb to 4.5lbs}and{crabs,}mainly 
 Partans (Edible crabs) are measured by
 the stone.The price of lobsters and   
 crabs depends on the time of year it  
 is. From mid-winter to the beginning  
 of{spring lobsters}can be as much as  
{Â£5.40 per pound,}but during the late  
{summer to early autumn}(the harvest)  
 prices can be as low as{Â£1.75 per     
{pound. Crabs}usually go for around    
{Â£3.50 per stone}all through the year. </content>
