{In Auchnagatt children quite often    
{play hide and seek,tig and high       
{tackie.Here is how to play each of    
{these.                                
{ High tackie:}First you choose someone
 to be the man.Then everyone runs away,
 the man chases them.If the man tigs   
 them when they are on the ground they 
 are the man.But if the man tigs them  
 when they are on something like the   
 kerb or steps they are not it.I like  
 high tackie because it is good fun to 
 play.                                 
{ Hide and seek:}Someone is the man and
 they close their eyes and count to a  
 hundred.Everyone else runs away and   
 hides.After the man has counted to a  
 hundred he shouts "coming ready or    
 not"and tries to find them.The first  
 person found is the man for the next  
 game.   (Cont.on page 14)             </content>
