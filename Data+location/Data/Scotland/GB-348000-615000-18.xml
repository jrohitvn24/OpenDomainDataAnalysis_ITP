		<title>18BURNFOOT CARNIVAL.</title>
		<content>    Burnfoot's Carnival was started in 
 l969 by the Residents Association. It 
 was intended for the benefit of the   
 Burnfoot people, providing them with  
 various entertainments and            
 activities.Initially the Carnival     
 Queen and her attendants were chosen  
 by the headmaster of the local primary
 school, but later the Residents       
 Association changed the system and put
 the names of all P.7 girls into a hat,
 and chose the Queen and her attendants
 by lot. The page boys were chosen by  
 the staff of the Infant School.The    
 Residents Association gave way to the 
 Community Council who now run the     
 Carnival. The Carnival Queen plays a  
 central part in the festival . In l985
 Karen Hogg was chosen and was crowned 
 by Archy Kirkwood, the Liberal M.P.   
 for the Borders. Karen's duties       
 included a tour of local hospitals.   </content>
