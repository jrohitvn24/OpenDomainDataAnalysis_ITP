		<content>{ALTYRE PARISH CHURCH}was included in  
 the charge of the newley-founded Elgin
 Cathedral by Bishop Andrew de Moravia 
 in 1293. This shows that the parish   
 already existed and so it is likely   
 that a church was also in existence at
 this time.In 1657 the parish was      
 joined to that of Rafford and so the  
 church would no longer have been used 
 after this date.This would have been  
 instrumental in preserving such a rare
 and interesting example of a typical  
 Scottish 13th Century church.It was   
 later used as a burial enclosure.The  
 most interesting stone is that of     
 Robert Cumming.His wife was Lesley    
 Baillie about whom Robert Burns wrote 
 his poem 'Bonnie Lesley'.
