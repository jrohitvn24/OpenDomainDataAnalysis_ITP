		<content> Every year the Gala Committee         
 organises a week of fun for the       
 villagers. In the main street car park
 a driving skills competition is held .
 For the children there is a Cycle kick
 start. A pram and 'cartie' race is    
 held for children and adults. That    
 evening there is a Disco where the    
 Gala Queen is chosen along with two   
 Princesses. They have to attend all   
 the Gala events and present prizes    
 etc. Many people help on Gala Day at  
 things like stalls, 'Tossing the      
 wellie", raffles tombola and teas.    
 Races are also held for the children. 
 The day is brought to a close with a  
 dance.                                
        There is also an Annual Flower 
 Show, Concerts and drama productions, 
 as well as various activities         
 organised for the old age pensioners, 
 (a tea party is run by the school).   </content>
