		<content> CONSERVATION AND HEDGING.             
 At present fields being converted from
 15 acres to 25 acres in line with     
 modern ideas of ratio of cattle to    
 acreage.Hedging,rather than           
 fencing,being used.Upkeep of both     
 nearly equal,hedging preferable for   
 conservation.New hedging along        
 northern boundary and on road through 
 farm (to improve scenic value,hide    
 ugly electricity pylons which cross   
 farm).Beech growing much better than  
 hawthorn at present.If this experiment
 is successful costwise,hedge will be  
 planted on western boundary too.      
  Mr.Nelson,the farmer,has found that  
 hedging has the advantage over trees  
 in that it does not shade crops,nor   
 does it encourage flies,which are a   
 problem as they attack the teats of   
 dairy cows.Infected cows can die      
 within three days.                    </content>
