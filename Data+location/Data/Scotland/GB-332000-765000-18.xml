		<title>18BALNABOTH ESTATE</title>
		<content>{Balnaboth Estate}now extends to       
 around 5500 acres.It has belonged to  
 the Ogilvys (and Ogilvy MacLeans)     
 since the 17th centuary.Clova and     
 Balnaboth were passed, by his brother 
 the Earl of Airlie to the Hon. Donald 
 Ogilvy of Clova in the 19th century.At
 that time it extended to 25,000 acres.
 The Clova estate was finally sold in  
 1920 and upper Glenprosen in 1957.    
                                       
 In the 1920 and 30's Balnaboth House  
 was let and rented for a time by Sir  
 James Barrie but he did not write any 
 works while he was in residence.      
    In 1950, ten people were employed  
 by the estate, in the house, garden   
 and as estate / forestry workers. By  
 1960 this had fallen to four and today
 no-one is employed full-time.
