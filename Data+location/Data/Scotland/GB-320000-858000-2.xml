		<content> Linkwood farm is part of the large    
 Linkwood Estate which covers 1300     
 acres. Mr Robertson being the manager 
 of Linkwood Estate,has a large        
 responsibility.                       
 Linkwood has three herds of cattle,   
 each having 160 cows. The cows can    
 produce up to 3000 litres of milk     
 a day. In 1984 Linkwood Farm had to   
 cull 20 cows because of the EEC milk  
 Quotas. The EEC stated that there was 
 to be a 9% cut back on milk.          
 Linkwood Farm grows barley, wheat,    
 turnips, oil seed rape, potatoes and  
 peas. At harvest time they cut the    
 barley and take in the same day. They 
 do this because children have been    
 known to make huts in the bales, then 
 light a fire which could easily cause 
 a fatal accident.
