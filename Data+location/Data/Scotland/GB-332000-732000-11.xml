		<title>11  MUIRHEAD CONT.</title>
		<content> Muirhead would appear to be the centre
 of the surrounding villages.The       
 village of Liff is approx. 2.5 km     
 away and Fowlis Easter is  3.75 km    
 away.                                 
  Apart from its own wood and park     
 Muirhead is only about 1.5 km from    
 Camperdown Park which has a golf      
 course, one of the best in country,   
 and its own wood.Muirhead is          
 also near Templeton Wood and Downfield
 golf course.                          
   Muirhead is a residential area      
 consisting mainly of bungalows and    
 detatched houses.The village is       
 expanding and therefore the population
 is increasing.Gradually this in turn  
 should lead to a reasessment of       
 amenities and much improved           
 facilities.
