		<content> There are about 60 house-holds in our 
 area. In the village itself there are 
 old established cottages,a farm, some 
 council houses built prewar and a new 
 estate of private houses built in 1981
 Most of the houses are detached but   
 there is a row of well spaced out semi
 -detached bungalows to the west of the
 village hall.                         
  There are at least 7 farmhouses in   
 the district. Most of them are working
 crofts or farms. Some old properties  
 have been bought and renovated as     
 private dwellings. There is a caravan 
 site and some farms hire out caravans 
 to holiday makers.                    
   The older houses are built with     
 local stone and are usually two       
 stories high with slate roofs.
