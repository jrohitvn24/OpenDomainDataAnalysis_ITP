		<title>07HARBOUR -(IRVINE)</title>
		<content>{In the past Irvine harbour was the    
{main port for GLASGOW}exporting       
 herring ,wool and hides.Centuries     
 later bricks,timber,sulphur,potash and
 clay were imported for the chemical   
 and building trades.                  
 Unfortunately the harbour is narrow   
 and fills up with silt .However a     
 pilot,John Darragh is employed by     
 I.C.I.to guide ships from the         
 harbour,although in former times he   
 worked on the dredger.                
 Fifty six ships a year take explosives
 from the wharf at I.C.I.to            
 England.This makes our harbour        
 dangerous and limits the number of    
 people allowed in the MAGNUM when     
 ships are being loaded.{In the future 
{it is expected that one of the docks  
{in the city of LONDON will get a      
{licence to load these cargoes.WHAT    
{WILL HAPPEN TO OUR HARBOUR THEN? }    </content>
