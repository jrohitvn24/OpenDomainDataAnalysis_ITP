		<content> Local people are helping sick children
 in Dunfermline. The Iain Skinner Fund 
 to help 10 year old Iain, who is      
 unable to walk, and the Kara Mitchell 
 Fund to help 2 year old Kara who      
 cannot walk, talk or feed herself. She
 shows no sign of handicap. Money was  
 raised by sponsoring, discos,raffles  
 and bottles in shops, pubs, clubs and 
 shows. Both children have been to     
 America for major operations and are  
 now doing well. Groups of people who  
 work in the same place often have     
 collections or sponsered events, such 
 as a sponsered slim, swim or run. A   
 lot of people each pay a small amount 
 if you achieve your goal. The         
 Dunfermline half marathon(13miles),   
 which ran partly through our area, was
 sponsered to support various          
 charities.     Gwen Milligan.
