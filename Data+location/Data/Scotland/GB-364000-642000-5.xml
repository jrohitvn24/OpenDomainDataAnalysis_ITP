		<title>05SERVICES IN GORDON</title>
		<content>   In Gordon we have two garages. The  
 largest one is Hunters and the smaller
 one is Bob Waldies. Hunters sells cars
 and also has its own breakdown        
 service. If you have smashed your car 
 you can get them to collect and mend  
 it.                                   
  A travelling library comes once a    
 week to Gordon. anyone in the village 
 can get books from it as long as they 
 return them.                          
  We have no doctors or ambulance      
 service,but ten minutes drive in      
 Earlston there is a health service. It
 was only built in the middle of 1984. 
 The police station we use is also in  
 Earlston.                             
  Kelso supplies us with fire engines  
 and ambulances as Earlston does not   
 have them.
