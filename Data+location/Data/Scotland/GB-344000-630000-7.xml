		<title>07THE YAIR HISTORY</title>
		<content> There were many different people who  
 owned the Charter of Selkirk.  This   
 area was a fishery and was known as   
 Piscatrum De Seleschirche and had an  
 enclosure to catch fish. It is still  
 used for fishing but the fishing is   
 for sport.                            
 The Charter was the Catra De Yhar.    
 William the Lion endorsed the gift and
 in 1247 Alexander II issued a special 
 Charter of Yair.                      
 Amongst the owners of the Charter was 
 Mr. Thomas Kerr, he owned the Charter 
 whilst being feud with the Scots.     
 A feud is a lasting hostility between 
 peoples.                              
 Up stream of the bridge is a cauld    
 which was used to divert the river for
 power to run a sawmill.  It is now    
 powered by electricty.
