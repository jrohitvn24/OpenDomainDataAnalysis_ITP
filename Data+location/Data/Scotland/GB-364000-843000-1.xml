		<content>  The position of our area is in the   
 north of{Scotland.}The nearest town   
 is{Turriff}which is about 7 miles from
 here. There are lots of{lorries}and   
{tractors}on the roads. There is only  
 one main road in our area. It goes    
 from{Turriff}to{Huntly.}The land is   
 fairly flat but we do have some hills.
 The highest point is{738}feet above   
 see level. There are some wooded areas
 which are mainly{conifers.}We have    
 many fields wich are owned by farmers.
 These are used for{sheep, cattle,     
{barley, turnips,}and other{crops.}Most
 people here are connected with the    
 land. The majority enjoy living in the
 country but some find it too quiet.
