		<title>15FARMING..EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Mr.Ostler and his son work the farm   
 with one full time employee ( 20 years
 ago there were 6 workers on the farm )
 and 1 agricultue student from Elmwood 
 College Cupar.There are 5 cottages,4  
 of which are occupied and one         
 uninhabitable.                        
   The basic hours of a farm worker    
 today are 40 hours a week but this    
 obviously fluctuates with the season.A
 typical worker earns at least Â£75 per 
 week.                                 
   Near the farmhouse is a 200 years   
 doo'cot which,in Mr.Ostler's father's 
 life time,was used for keeping        
 pigeons.In winter,when only salted    
 pork was available,pigeons provided a 
 welcome change of diet.               
   The family receive deliveries of    
 groceries,paper,milk,etc. and tend to 
 do the rest of their shopping in      
 Cupar.                                </content>
