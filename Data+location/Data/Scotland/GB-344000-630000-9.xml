		<title>09SHEEP FARMING</title>
		<content> The land is cultivated up to about 250
 metres above sea level.  Most of this 
 area is therefore uncultivated rough  
 pasture.                              
 The rough pasture is used to graze    
 sheep.  Each year the tupps, yearling 
 lambs are sold in Kelso Sheep Market. 
 The ewes are used for breeding or are 
 slaughtered for food.  The fleece from
 the sheep has been spun locally in the
 past but now few of the local spinning
 mills are still in operation.         
 Amongst the sheep reared are black    
 face and border leicester.            
 The heather has to be burned off      
 regularly to stunt its growth and     
 encourage new growth suitable for     
 grazing.  This also helps to encourage
 grouse which are shot by groups of    
 people from the big houses on the     
 three estates.
