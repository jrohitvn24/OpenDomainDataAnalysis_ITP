		<content>   The area is on a slope from south   
 to north towards the Clyde Valley. The
 southern half is relatively flat grass
 land, but as one goes north the ground
 slopes more and more steeply down     
 towards the river valley (400 feet).  
 All the streams are in steep sided    
 valleys.                              
{ECOLOGY}                              
 Most of the area is farmed but the    
 remains of industrial activity        
 (mining) can still be seen in many    
 places.                               
   The disused Hamilton-Strathaven     
 railway has been either infilled or   
 converted to a path. The last big     
 spoil heap (Eddlewood Colliery) is    
 being removed at present, but Cadzow  
 Colliery spoil heap has been          
 reclaimed.
