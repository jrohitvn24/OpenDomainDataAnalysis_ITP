 Our particular grid area could best be
 described as "rural".Within this area 
 is some of the most fertile farming   
 land in Scotland.The land is low-lying
 and the climate fairly mild.Farming   
 was the most important activity in the
 area, but now,people work at some of  
 the more up-to-date, modern           
 industries.The number of people living
 in the area has increased and more    
 people are buying or building their   
 own homes.Within Fearn itself,there   
 has been some new council housing     
 built.Arabella has no council         
 houses.There are many roads which pass
 through the grid leading to some of   
 the neighbouring villages and linking 
 us with the nearest large             
 settlement,Tain.
