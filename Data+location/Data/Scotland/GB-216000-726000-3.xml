 boundaries, Kilchurn Castle.  The     
 comprises a series of buildings       
 ranging from the middle of the        
 fifteenth century to the end of the   
 seventeenth century. The first of the 
 buildings is a five storeyed tower    
 house which was built by Sir Colin    
 Campbell first of Glenorchy who died  
 in 1475.

 historical interest in the area such

 settlements from the shore.
