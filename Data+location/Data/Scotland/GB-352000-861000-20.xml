		<title>20SOCIAL CONCERNS IN FORDYCE</title>
		<content> Recently we have noticed in the local 
 paper "The Banffshire Journal" 3      
 things about which the people in      
 Fordyce seem especially concerned.    
 l. As part of the improvements of the 
 village,it was proposed to build Pub- 
 lic Toilets,but agreement has not yet 
 been reached as to where they should  
 be sited.The 2 most likely sites are  
 in the square near the castle or in   
 the new amenity park,"The Bleachy".   
 2. A resident of Fordyce wished to    
 build a bungalow in his very large    
 garden,but,although he agreed to all  
 conservation requirements,his         
 application was refused.              
 3.  An old 'right-of-way' linking     
 Fordyce with Sandend has been closed  
 for a number of years because remains 
 of a stone dyke have been allowed to  
 block it.Some villagers are now try-  
 ing to have it re-opened.             </content>
