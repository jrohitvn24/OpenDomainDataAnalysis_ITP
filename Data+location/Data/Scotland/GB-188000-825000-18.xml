		<title>18CROFTING IN DORNIE</title>
		<content> The majority of the land in the Dornie
 area is given over to rough           
 grazing.There is very little intensive
 agriculture. However round Bundalloch 
 there are a number of crofts.These    
 crofts are run on traditional lines   
 some with stock rearing in particular 
 sheep being the main crop.Some also   
 have cattle but the system of having a
 milking cow is gradually disappearing.
 There is not a great deal of arable   
 farming but the crofts do cut hay for 
 their cattle and a few raise corn on a
 fairly small scale.The crofters plant 
 potatoes for their own family use.The 
 sheep spend most of their time on the 
 hill and lambing takes place on the   
 open ground.The cattle are out in the 
 grassy areas in the Summer but are    
 usually brought in during the Winter.
