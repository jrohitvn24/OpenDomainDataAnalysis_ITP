   There has been a school here for    
 more than a hundred years.When my     
 Grandfather came to school there were 
 sixty to seventy pupils.I started     
 school in 1978 and there were only six
 pupils_three boys and three girls.The 
 next year Achmore School closed and   
 the year following,Killilan School    
 closed.The eight pupils involved came 
 to this school.There are thirty-nine  
 pupils now.Most of them come from     
 Balmacara.                            
  There is a shelter and a climbing    
 frame in the playground.In the canteen
 there is a cook,a server and a        
 washer-up.We get nice dinners.        
  We play lots of games.Today,the girls
 are skipping and the boys are building
 a hut up the hill.                    
  I come to school on a double-decker.
