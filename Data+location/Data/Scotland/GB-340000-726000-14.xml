		<content>   Children under four can go to a     
 playgroup run by mothers and up to the
 age of five can go to nursery in the  
 area.                                 
   The area is served by two primary   
 schools. Both are open plan, which    
 means that there are no separating    
 walls between classes and they share  
 library and art areas. Seven age      
 groups are taught in each school. Most
 of the staff live locally and children
 come from Wormit, Newport and rural   
 areas nearby.                         
   Children are bused about 14 km to   
 St. Andrews for their Secondary       
 Education unless they attend a private
 school, usually in Dundee across the  
 River Tay.                            
   Further Education is also available 
 nearby in St. Andrews and Dundee.
