		<content> Corseford is a purpose_built          
 residential school run by the Scottish
 Council for Spastics (a charity). It  
 provides for 50 multiply_handicapped  
 pupils aged 5_18 suffering from       
 cerebal palsy and spina bifida. Being 
 disabled makes everything harder. You 
 have to think before doing everyday   
 things. Just to be is difficult. They 
 use many aids to make life easier;    
 wheelchairs, walking frames, adapted  
 typewriters and cutlery. Some pupils  
 have no speech and use colour coded   
 Bliss system by eye or finger         
 pointing. Makaton sign language and   
 finger spelling are also used.        
 Computers are a link with the outside 
 world and are a marvellous aid in many
 ways. 105 staff work in the school to 
 help the pupils gain independence.    
 People know very little about the     
 handicapped.The school can do a lot.  </content>
