		<title>04Langside Quarry - Kennoway</title>
		<content>{ Langside Quarry}is situated half a   
 kilometre to the north of the village 
 of Kennoway. The quarry has provided  
 some employment since the beginning of
 this century.                         
  The original owner of the quarry was 
 a man called{W.B.Miller}but it has    
 recently been taken over by{Hewden    
{Stewart Contracts of Glasgow.         
  The quarry is sited on what is       
 believed to be a blowhole in a string 
 of ancient volcanoes that ran through 
 the Kingdom of Fife millions of years 
 ago.                                  
  The quarry produces around 150,000   
 tons of{Basalt rock}every year which  
 is crushed to produce aggregate for   
 road building throughout the country. 
  The company plans to expand to       
 produce further products, but         
 unfortunately this does not mean more 
 employment for the area.              </content>
