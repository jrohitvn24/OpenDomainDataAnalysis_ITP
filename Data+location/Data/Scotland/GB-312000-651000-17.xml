		<content> In West Linton there is a tree        
 preservation order on key areas of the
 woodland of the village area.         
   There is very little natural        
 woodland. The forests and woodland    
 areas were planted delibrately mainly 
 as windbreaks during the last 100-150 
 years.  These windbreaks also         
 provide shelter for a variety of wild 
 life that lives here.                 
   As wildlife is found here there is a
 lot of game shooting. Geese are shot  
 on Mendick Hill as they fly to and    
 from Westwater reservoir.             
   The land on both sides of the A702  
 towards Biggar is very sandy and      
 therefore quite productive. The sand  
 is even mined at a quarry beyond      
 Ingraston farm .                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
