		<content> The settlement in the map area is of  
 two main types:- isolated {farms}and  
 small clusters of cottages.           
{ Inchmarlo}is a tiny community.  Near 
 the point where the Canny burn crosses
 the North Deeside Road a Post         
 Office-general store, village hall and
 a handfull of houses stand close to   
 the road.  An antiques shop a few     
 hundred yards east and other clusters 
 of houses on either side of the water 
 works complete the community.         
 To the south of the river there is    
 little settlement other than a small  
 group of {Forestry Commission}workers'
 houses.                               
 Cairnton House and {Inchmarlo House   
 are large houses built by local estate
 owners. {Inchmarlo}is about to become 
 the centre of a settlement of over 120
 homes for the elderly.
