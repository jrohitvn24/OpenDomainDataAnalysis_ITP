		<title>18FOOD IN BALMEDIE</title>
		<content> There are many places where we get our
 food in Balmedie. There is a butcher  
 and he sells mince, steak, stew, lamb,
 bacon,pork,and sausages. He gets his  
 supplies from E.C.Mathiesons. There is
 also a place called the Coach and     
 Horses, it is over 100 years old and  
 it has always been an Inn. The owner  
 Mr Cook sells drinks and bar lunches. 
 We can also have a meal at the White  
 Horse Inn. There is a chip shop in    
 Balmedie which provides a selection of
 meals. Balmedie post office also sells
 a large variety of different types of 
 food. If I was having a treat this is 
 what I would have. Breakfast Frosties 
 with milk. Lunch Mince and tatties.   
 Dinner Sausage beans and chips        
 followed by Angel Delight. Sometimes  
 we go out for a meal and have         
 something unusual like sweet and sour 
 pork.                                 </content>
