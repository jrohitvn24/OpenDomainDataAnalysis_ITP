		<title>16ANCIENT STONES BALQUHIDDER</title>
		<content> On the ground below the manse there   
 are the remains of what was once a    
 stone circle. It measures 10 metres in
 diameter and is thought to date to    
 before the days of the Druids. Towards
 the River Balvaig from the stone      
 circle is a large square standing     
 stone of nearly 2 metres high which is
 known as Puidreag. These stones are   
 known locally as "The Worshipping     
 Stones" and may indeed contain a      
 burial ground. Not far away is the    
 stone called Basan an Saguirt or The  
 Priest's Basin. It has five sides and 
 its top surface is a circular hollow. 
 It may have been a healing stone or a 
 stone used for some religious         
 ceremony. If one cares to search the  
 area, other interesting stones will   
 also be found, but their significance 
 is anybody's guess.
