		<title>14Tourism Around Rhenigidale</title>
		<content> The Rhenigidale hostel is open all    
 year round for visitors but during the
 months of October _ April it is       
 partially used as a store for feeding 
 stuffs. Most hikers stay 1 or 2 nights
 but there are some who stay longer.   
 While they are here some want to climb
 Toddun or explore the hills and       
 valleys around the village. Many of   
 the hostellers who stay for a few days
 like to help in the work around the   
 village _ whether it is dipping or    
 shearing sheep, fencing or just       
 meeting the boat and helping to carry 
 the supplies that arrive at the       
 jetty. Day trippers come too. Some    
 walk in and go to the hostel and have 
 a drink and some bring picnics and sit
 outside maybe taking photographs      
 before walking back to Tarbert. No    
 matter how miserable the weather there
 is always someone on the path.        </content>
