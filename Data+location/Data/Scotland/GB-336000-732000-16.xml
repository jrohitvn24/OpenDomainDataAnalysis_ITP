		<title>16A day in the life of Fiona</title>
		<content> On Sundays, my sister Mhairi and I    
 will eventually wake up and go to wake
 our mum and dad. My mum will get up   
 first, get washed and dressed, and    
 then go for the papers at New Orleans 
 Place in Menzieshill where we live. By
 the time she comes back we are usually
 dressed and either watching TV or     
 having breakfast. About ten o'clock we
 leave for Lochee, a suburb and        
 shopping centre of Dundee, which used 
 to be a village on its own many years 
 ago. We go swimming for about an hour 
 and a half, then go across to Davies' 
 ice cream shop and cafe.We usually    
 walk up to the tennis court and have  
 lunch there.Afterwards we go home and 
 if it is a nice day we lie out for the
 afternoon.In the evening we will have 
 tea and watch TV or a video before    
 bed.
