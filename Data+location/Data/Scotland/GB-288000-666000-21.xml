<title>21Lack of Growth in facilities/ No Childcare Building</title>
<content>

The frustrating problem for parents in Blackridge with young kids is the lack of child care.&lt;br />&lt;br />Theres a train a school and a shop, but if you want to work you have to leave the village to do it but where do the kids go? If an employer wants u to start at 8.30,  where do the kids go, AND AFTER SCHOOL ESPECIALLY ON A FRIDAY HALF DAY where do the kids go?  if you want to work full time.  It adds to the poverty of people because of the lack of foresight from the council. A building needs to be open from 7a.m. to 7p.m. to cover care for people who want to work.   &lt;br />
