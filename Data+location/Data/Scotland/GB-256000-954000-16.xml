		<title>16A Gamekeeper, Tongue</title>
		<content> 'Our local gamekeeper likes his job.  
 Atthis time of year in the spring he  
 looks for vermin such as foxes and    
 hoody crows that would eat the lambs. 
 In winter he feeds the deer so that   
 they won't raid the crops of the      
 farmers or the crofters. He does not  
 do much heather burning because each  
 patch needs burned only every ten     
 years. Heather burning has to stop in 
 the middle of April so that new growth
 can come through and so that birds    
 that are nesting aren't harmed. There 
 are trout and salmon in the river and 
 he sometimes has to take people       
 fishing or stalking deer. He sees a   
 lot of buzzards and eagles, foxes and 
 badgers, and occasionally a pine      
 marten.'
