 Adults in our area take part in a     
 number of leisure time activities.    
 At, or near, home their interests are 
 cross-country running, gardening,     
 badminton, dyking, crook-making,      
 shooting, carpet bowling and sewing.  
 Some woman attend meetings of the     
 Gelston branch of the Scottish Womens 
 Rural Institute, where there are      
 demonstrations on cooking and         
 handicrafts, talks on the work of     
 different  organisations, and         
 competitions to enter.                
 In Castle Douglas, about five         
 kilometres from Gelston, classes      
 attended are keep-fit,yoga and        
 cookery. Other sports are sailing,    
 golf, squash and green bowling.       
 In winter some people travel fifty    
 kilometres to curl at Lockerbie Ice   
 Rink.                                 </content>
