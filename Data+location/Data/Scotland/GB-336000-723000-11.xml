		<title>11A Farmer's Year</title>
		<content> In{Spring}the farmer prepares his land
 for sowing barley,oats,wheat,carrots, 
 and oil _ seed rape.He plants potatoes
 and sprays the crops.He then makes    
 silage and hay.The hay is to feed the 
 cows in winter.In Spring the cows are 
 calving.In{Summer}there are farm      
 holidays then roguing the potatoes and
 harvesting crops.In{Autumn}the farmer 
 lifts the potatoes by machine or a    
 squad of helpers.Children get a week's
 holiday from school to help.They all  
 agree it is very hard work but the    
 extra money is very welcome.A maximum 
 of Â£12.00 per day can be earned by    
 hard workers.In{Winter}the farmer     
 ploughs the fields and feeds the      
 cattle with the hay and silage he made
 in Spring.He also grades the potatoes 
 and sells them.As you can see a       
 farmer's life is very busy,but is one 
 which is very worthwhile &amp; rewarding. </content>
