		<title>10JUDAISM IN NEWTON MEARNS</title>
		<content>    A large percentage of the Jewish   
 population of Scotland reside in      
 Newton Mearns. There are two          
 synagogues serving the needs of 240   
 families. There is a Jewish Newspaper 
 called the Jewish Echo, which is      
 printed in Glasgow. Many youth clubs  
 and sports activities are organised   
 for young Jewish people in the area.  
 Both the state and private education  
 systems are used. Employment for      
 adults is in businesses and in the    
 professions.                          
                                       
     Bahai : This sect of Judaism has  
 about 30 members in Newton Mearns but 
 as it does not have an established    
 place of worship it is allowed the use
 of the 18th century Mearns Old Parish 
 Church.
