		<title>16MY WEEKENDS</title>
		<content> I live just outside Croy on a small   
 farm.There are not very many houses   
 near mine.This is about what I        
 do to pass the time over the weekend.I
 sleep in until 8.50 then get up for a 
 breakfast of cereal, toast and a      
 cup of tea.My brother and I play a few
 games, like Monopoly, which is a game 
 that you pay bills , receive money and
 buy properties.You use toy money.The  
 game helps you to handle money.I go   
 to church at 12.00 and come home for  
 the best meal of the week of pork and 
 potatoes with baked Alaska for pudding
 .I help my dad feed the cattle then I 
 watch television for an hour.I read   
 books like the Hardyboys and Enid     
 Blyton's books in bed .The Hardyboys  
 are detective stories and are fast    
 moving adventures.The Enid Blyton     
 books are about  children who are     
 keen on sleuthing.                    </content>
