		<content> Last year the first thing the primary 
 6 football team won was the Sinclair  
 Trophy.  It was a seven-a-side        
 competition.  Next was the Dominion   
 Cup which we won 2-1 against Dean     
 Park School in Balerno.Then came the  
 Carson Cup where we   again beat Dean 
 Park 5-0 in the final.  We then went  
 on to win the league.  Our greatest   
 triumph was against Davidson's Mains  
 in the semi-final of the School Board 
 Cup.  It was a 3-3 draw at full time  
 and we scored the winning goal in     
 extra time.  That took us into the    
 final of the School Board Cup when we 
 played against Craigentinny School and
 won 3-2, winning the cup for Juniper  
 Green for the second year running.
