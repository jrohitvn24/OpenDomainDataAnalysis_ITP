		<content> 2. Fife Fashion Ltd.(Kilt and Skirt   
 makers)                               
 Fife Fashion was set up in June 1983  
 by a number of men and women who had  
 been made redundant. They pooled their
 redundancy money and with the help of 
 a grant set themselves up as Lady     
 skirts and kilt makers. They chose a  
 sight in Cardenden as most of the     
 members of the co-operative lived     
 there. At present their are 13 members
 of the co-operative, 8 are from       
 Cardenden, 4 from Kirkcaldy and 1 from
 Dunfermline. It is too soon to        
 ivaluate how succesful they will be   
 but the workforce feel confident they 
 will soon be able to expand and to    
 take on some of the unemployed        
 teenagers from the area.
