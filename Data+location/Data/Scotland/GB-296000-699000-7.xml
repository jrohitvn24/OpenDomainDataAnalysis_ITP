 There is no longer a Police Station in
 the village of Muckhart.              
 This is a very scattered rural        
 district of farms and private         
 residences. It is a fairly  law       
 abiding place save for the occasional 
 speeding car which is dealt with by   
 motor patrols setting up speed traps. 
    Police are rarely seen and then in 
 patrol cars. There is one P C to 700  
 people and the nearest Police station 
 is in Tillicoultry about 6 miles away.
