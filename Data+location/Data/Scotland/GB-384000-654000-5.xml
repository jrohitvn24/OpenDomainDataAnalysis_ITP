		<title>05TRADE IN CHIRNSIDE</title>
		<content> There are 5 travelling shops, not     
 including the ice-cream vans. They are
 2 butchers' vans, a freezer van, a    
 fishmonger's and a library. People    
 often use the travelling shops when   
 they have forgotten something at the  
 larger towns or even in the village.  
 The papershop and the grocers are     
 perhaps the most popular shops. The   
 shops provide employment for quite a  
 few people in our area. Both Chirnside
 and Allanton have post offices. This  
 is very important to people in a rural
 area. It means, for example, that     
 elderly people do not have to travel  
 to other places to collect their old  
 age pensions. Many small villages do  
 not boast a post office nowadays so we
 are very lucky. Although neither      
 village has many shops, there are     
 enough to supply people with their day
 to day requirements.                  </content>
