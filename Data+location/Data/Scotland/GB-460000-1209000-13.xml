		<title>13The wood at Halligarth</title>
		<content> The wood at Halligarth was planted in 
 1845 by Dr. Laurence Edmondson. A dry 
 stone dyke was built to protect the   
 young tree from wind and sea air.We   
 counted 243 trees,mostly sycamores.   
 Those in the North-West corner looked 
 healthiest but those on the Eastern   
 edge,nearest to the sea,were stunted  
 and sparse. We found bluebells,white- 
 bells,buttercups and wild orchids     
 under the trees.Migrating birds use   
 the wood as a shelter,to rest in and  
 to feed in. Species noted at some time
 in the wood are:short-eared owl,pied  
 fly-catcher,wood warbler,black        
 redstart,cuckoo,collared doves,water  
 rail,chaffinch,brambling,mistle       
 thrush,redwing,fieldfare,hen harrier  
 goshawk,blackcap,red-backed shrike    
 and woodcock.
