		<content> In the block just east of the block   
 containing Yair house we visited the  
 countryside. and noticed an electrical
 sub station. There was not much       
 farrmland what there was was at the   
 bottom of the hill.  Most was being   
 used for grazing cattle and sheep.    
 The rest of the ground was covered in 
 trees mostly beech and conifers.      
 The path was in a fire break in the   
 forest and was very steep.  There was 
 a little stream beside the path but   
 this year there are streams everywhere
 because it has been so wet.  We saw a 
 rabbit run across our path.           
 Beside the path at the top was some   
 fern and weeds also at the top was a  
 dry stane dyke with a fence running   
 along the top of it.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
