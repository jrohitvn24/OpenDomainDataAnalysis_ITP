		<content> The work on this project was done     
 entirely by the pupils of P4-P7 of    
 Banff Primary School and the          
 perceptions are those of the children 
 involved.                             
    We are very grateful to the various
 landowners involved and also to the   
 Planning department of Banff and      
 Buchan District Council for their help
 and co-operation.                     
    The project could not have been    
 completed without the help and support
 of the parents,many of whom tramped   
 miles across fields and along river   
 banks in pursuit of Domesday survey   
 information.
