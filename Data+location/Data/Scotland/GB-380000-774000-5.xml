		<content> The only shop is a small{general store
 and{sub-post office. }There is a wide 
 range of groceries together with a    
 stock of clothes and toiletries.      
 Papers can be ordered  and there is a 
 selection of toys and gifts, many of  
 which carry the "Arbuthnott" name for 
 the souvenir hunters. The P.O. side   
 sells stamps and T.V. licences,       
 dispenses pensions and allowances and 
 carries out the other functions of a  
 sub-P.O.  Mail is collected twice     
 daily and there is a public call-box  
 which is used as much by "passing     
 trade" as the local population.       
 Due to the friendly manner of the     
 present proprietress, the shop serves 
 a{social function,}encouraging        
 customers to pass time and exchange   
 news. As a rural community this is    
 essential to our well-being.
