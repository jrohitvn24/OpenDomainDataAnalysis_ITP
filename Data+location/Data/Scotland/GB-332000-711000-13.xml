		<content> The local{newspaper}for Springfield   
 and the surrounding area is{The Fife  
{Herald.}The general items that go into
 the newspaper are everyday things that
 happen in the village, for example,   
 what happens in the Community Council 
 or the 200 club and also news items   
 about sponsored walks, the Youth      
 Club and what happens in the church.  
 The number of items that go into the  
 newspaper is normally about 2 or 3 and
 they have to be in by 1600 on         
 Wednesday because that is the         
 deadline. The reporter reports the    
 news from Springfield village only,   
 not all of our area. When the news has
 been taken to The Fife Herald they    
 print it and publish it on the Friday.
