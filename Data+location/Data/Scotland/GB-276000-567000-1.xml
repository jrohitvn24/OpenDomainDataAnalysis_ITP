		<content> There are two small villages in the   
 area.  They are Kirkpatrick Durham and
 Old Bridge of Urr.  In Old Bridge of  
 Urr there are about 30 people; in     
 Kirkpatrick Durham there are under 100
 people.                               
 There are a lot of farms and their    
 main land use is for grazing but some 
 have crops which are used to feed the 
 beef cattle in winter.  They are      
 Galloway cattle.                      
 In the area there is only one shop and
 post office and that is in Old Bridge 
 of Urr.  There is a church in         
 Kirkpatrick Durham and a school but   
 that is closed down.  The River Urr is
 used for fishing because it has good  
 salmon.  The A75 is part of the       
 Euro-route to Ireland so that means   
 that large lorries go on the road and 
 a lot of accidents happen because they
 are going too fast.                   </content>
