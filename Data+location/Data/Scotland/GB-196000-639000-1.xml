		<title>01The Hills of Glen Rosa</title>
		<content> This block covers the central part of 
 Glen Rosa &amp; the associated hills.     
 The valley floor is very wet and      
 boggy, and there has been a recent    
 attempt to put in an irrigation ditch 
 in order to drain the footpath - which
 runs alongside the burn.   On the east
 side of the Glen is Goatfell-the      
 highest point on the island at 2866 ft
 ; and on the west side is Beinn a     
 Chilabhain &amp; coire a Bhradain.        
 Nobody lives in this area, but it is a
 special site of scientific interest &amp; 
 a national scientific area.   It is a 
 very popular area with hill walkers,  
 and there are many footpaths          
 throughout the area.   The most       
 popular footpath is the one to the    
 summit of Goatfell.   This area is    
 owned by the National Trust for       
 Scotland.   It also shows extensive   
 features of glaciation.   Spectacular.</content>
