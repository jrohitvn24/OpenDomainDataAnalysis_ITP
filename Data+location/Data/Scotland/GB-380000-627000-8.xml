		<title>08Yetholm primary School (2)</title>
		<content> An expensive modernisation scheme for 
 Yetholm School first proposed in the  
 1940's, delayed at least ten times is 
 to start in 1987. A radical reduction 
 in the number of Primary Schools in   
 the Borders threatened the existence  
 of the school. An amalgamation with   
 Morebattle, a continual threat, was   
 considered but after review firmly    
 rejected. This issue aroused great    
 passion in the village with parents,  
 and Community Councillors mounting an 
 effective campaign to save the school.
{WAUCHOPE HALL:-}Administered by       
 trustees, the hall in the last 10     
 years has had a new heating system,   
 re-decoration and a balcony removed. A
 focal point in the community the hall 
 is used by all groups.                
{LIBRARY:-}An average of 40 people     
 exchange thier books at the library,  
 held in the school, 3 evenings a week.</content>
