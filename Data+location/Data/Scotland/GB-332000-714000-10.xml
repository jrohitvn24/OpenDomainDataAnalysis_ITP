		<title>10FARMING..CROP IRRIGATION</title>
		<content> Irrigating crops has many advantages. 
 In 1985 before the watering system at 
 Hilton of Carslogie was complete an   
 unwatered field of potatoes yielded 10
 tonnes per acre and the tubers were   
 affected by scab, a symptom of dry    
 soils. A neighbouring field which was 
 irrigated yielded 17 tonnes per acre  
 of quality tubers.Other crops on the  
 farm also benefit with the addition of
 water,especially vegetables and grass.
 More farmers in our area may be       
 tempted to invest in borehole water   
 extraction because the River Tay      
 Purification Board is concerned at the
 unrestricted use of surface stream    
 water for crop spraying. In the near  
 future farmers may be banned from     
 using this surface water and this may 
 encourage more of them to extract     
 supplies from underground sources.
