		<title>09RESCOBIE LOCH - RECREATION</title>
		<content>{RECREATION}in Rescobie loch is mainly 
{FISHING}but also some{SAILING.}During 
 the fishing season hundreds of anglers
 fish there. Only permit holders may   
 fish and they may only fly fish,      
 sometimes from the bank and sometimes 
 from boats which can be hired at the  
 lochside.                             
 Permits are bought from the Rescobie  
 Fishing Organization and the prices   
 are Â£9 for young anglers and Â£20 for  
 older anglers. Gamekeepers patrol the 
 area and poachers may receive heavy   
 fines.                                
{FISH TYPES}have changed since at one  
 time there were no trout to be found  
 in the loch and only eels and pike    
 could be caught. Now rainbow trout and
 brown trout are the types of fish to  
 be caught.
