		<title>16Rogart - Farming (Forestry)</title>
		<content>  Twenty-five years ago, the Forestry  
 Commission planted three woods on the 
 Drynach in Rogart. Altogether, they   
 planted around 880,000 plants. They   
 planted different varieties of trees -
 Scot's pine, European larch, Japanese 
 larch, Hybrid larch and Lodge-pole    
 pine.                                 
  When these trees were planted, three 
 houses had to be evacuated. If the    
 people had stayed there, the fire-risk
 to the forests would have been too    
 high. Today, these houses are         
 uninhabitable.                        
  The hillside is planted to a height  
 of 800ft. Above this, the Forestry    
 Commission have discovered the land in
 Rogart is uneconomic for              
 tree-planting.                        
  When the trees are mature, they will 
 be felled and taken by road to be made
 into wood-pulp and thence to paper.   </content>
