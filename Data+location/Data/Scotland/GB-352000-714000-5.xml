		<content> From Kinkell Braes to the Maiden Rock 
 the coast consists of mainly          
 calciferous sandstones and igneous    
 rocks. Five volcanic vents are present
 and visible through the sandstone.    
 Some occur in the form of dykes and   
 rocks which are thrown into a long    
 series of anticlinal and synclinal    
 folds intersected by faults.          
 The Maiden Rock itself is 14m high and
 situated on a raised beach. It was    
 thought to have been isolated due to  
 faulting. The shore below the rock is 
 very hard calciferous sandstone       
 showing synclines and faults. Further 
 along is the Rock and Spindle which   
 is the volcanic neck of agglomerate   
 coming through the calciferous        
 sandstone to a basal dyke forming an  
 irregular stack. Kinkell Ness is      
 another volcanic area with dykes and  
 deep trenches.                        </content>
