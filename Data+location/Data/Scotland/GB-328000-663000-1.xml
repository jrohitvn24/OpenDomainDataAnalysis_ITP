		<title>01SURVEY OF BONNYRIGG AREA</title>
		<content> Our block consists of two small towns,
{Bonnyrigg}and{Loanhead,}as well as    
 farmland. The{River North Esk}flows   
 through the area in a North Easterly  
 direction towards Musselburgh where it
 flows into the{River Forth.}Bonnyrigg 
 and Loanhead developed and grew from  
 small{coal-mining}villages, with{paper
 and{carpet manufacturing}at one time  
 providing the other main sources of   
 employment. With the closure of these 
 factories they are now mainly         
{residential}towns, a large percentage 
 of the population travelling to       
{Edinburgh}for work. Many new houses in
 both public and private sectors have  
 been built in the last 20 years to    
 accommodate people who wish to live   
 near, but not in, Edinburgh. With no  
 special tourist attractions the       
 population remains fairly stable all  
 the year round.                       </content>
