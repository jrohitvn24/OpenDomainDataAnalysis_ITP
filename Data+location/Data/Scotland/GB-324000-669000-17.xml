		<title>17SCOTLAND'S ROYAL OBSERVATORY</title>
		<content> Today on a 4 acre site on Blackford   
 Hill you will find the Astromony      
 Department of Edinburgh University.   
 When opened in 1896 to replace the    
 Calton Hill Observatory it gave work  
 for 4 scientists. Now there are over  
 100. Overseas telescopes now provide  
 most of the information, satellites in
 orbit relay this information and in a 
 few hours the Cosmos machine can      
 measure observations that would take a
 scientist 7 years. Two very large     
 computers proces the figures. At      
 Siding Spring in Australia the UK     
 Schmidt Telescope takes wide angled   
 photographs of the sky. Our astonomers
 have made a sky atlas from these.     
 At Mauna Kea in Hawaii, the UK        
 infrared telescope is worked by       
 scientists who do not ever have to    
 leave Blackford Hill.
