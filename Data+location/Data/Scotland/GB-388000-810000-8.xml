		<title>08DANESTONE (ABERDEEN)</title>
		<content>  The farms in Danestone have been     
 taken over by Barratts and other      
 housing companies.Now there are many  
 houses built,but there are still some 
 farms. There are many types of farms  
 in Danestone which include dairy farms
 and arable farms.                     
  The houses that have been built are  
 very modern,not like the old houses in
 Aberdeen which are built of granite.  
 The houses are built near the River   
 Don,and they overlook Bankhead and the
 river.Most of the houses are semi-det 
 ached or detached.There are still     
 houses going up,but people are already
 living in the houses that have been   
 built.There are still old farm build- 
 ings and original stane dykes and a   
 few trees.The new houses have smaller 
 rooms,but most have 3-4 bedrooms,kitc-
 hen,bathroom,living room &amp; diningroom.
 They range from Â£37000-Â£78000.        </content>
