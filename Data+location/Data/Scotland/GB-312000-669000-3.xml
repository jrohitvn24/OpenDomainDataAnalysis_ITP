		<content> THE VILLAGE HAS QUITE A FEW SHOPS     
 WHICH SELL MAINLY FOODSTUFFS ALTHOUGH 
 IT WAS FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE WENT TO 
 THE LARGER SUPERMARKETS IN TOWN FOR   
 THEIR WEEKLY SHOPPING. THERE IS A     
 MOBILE LIBRARY WHICH COMES TO THE     
 VILLAGE TWICE A WEEK AND SEEMS TO BE  
 WELL USED. THERE IS A COMMUNITY CENTRE
 ATTACHED TO THE SCHOOL WHICH PROVIDES 
 A MEETING PLACE AS WELL AS FACILITIES 
 FOR BADMINTON,SNOOKER,KEEP FIT AND    
 MANY OTHER CLUB ACTIVITIES BESIDES. IT
 WAS FOUND THAT THE CENTRE WAS MAINLY  
 USED BY THE YOUNGER PEOPLE FOR        
 ENTERTAINMENT WHILE THE ADULTS TENDED 
 TO GO TO EDINBURGH FOR THEIRS. WHEN   
 INTERVIEWED THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE
 SAID THAT THE REASON THEY STAYED IN   
 THE VILLAGE WAS FOR THE RURAL         
 SURROUNDINGS COUPLED WITH ITS         
 PROXIMITY TO EDINBURGH.
