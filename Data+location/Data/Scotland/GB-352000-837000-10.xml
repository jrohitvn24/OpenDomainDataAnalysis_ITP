		<content> BOWLING.   The bowling green is on    
 Richmond Road.  It was built in 1885  
 and is 100 years old this year.  There
 are 200 members; 140 men and 60 women.
 There is a big waiting list for       
 membership.  There is a Huntly bowling
 team.  To be a member you pay each    
 year.  To buy a set of bowls costs    
 about Â£100.                           
 FISHING.  There are two rivers, the   
 Deveron and the Bogie.  When you start
 fishing you need a permit which you   
 can get at the local sports shop.  The
 permit costs five pounds at first but 
 after that it goes down to two pounds 
 a year.  The fishers mainly fish for  
 Salmon or Trout.                      
 THE MARKET MUIR is open for anybody to
 use.  There are facilities for Boys   
 League Football, Rugby and picnic     
 areas.
