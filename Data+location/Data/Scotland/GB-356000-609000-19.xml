		<content>{An ANCIENT BRITISH HILL FORT}on       
 Bonchester Hill is the earliest known 
 habitation.{HOBKIRK }means"The church 
  in the narrow valley"and a church    
 is known to have been on or near its  
 present site since 1045,and probably  
 earlier.It appears that the area was  
 more densely populated up until       
 earlier this century,and indeed the   
 old school log book shows that there  
 was a great deal of mobility amongst  
 the farm workers as well.The only true
{CUSTOM}to survive is the Bonchester   
 Ba' Day.This is a handball game played
 by the men of the district in February
 of each year.It is usually very muddy 
 and rough,but good humoured.It starts 
 from the wall by the old school and   
 church.There is also a {RIDE-OUT}from 
 the {HAWICK COMMON RIDING}to          
 Bonchester Bridge once a year,which   
 draws a very big crowd.               </content>
