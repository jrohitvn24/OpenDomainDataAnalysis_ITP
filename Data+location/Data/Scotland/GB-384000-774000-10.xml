		<title>10TODHEAD LIGHTHOUSE, KINNEFF.</title>
		<content>{Todhead lighthouse}was built by       
 D.Stevenson and was opened on 20th    
 September, 1897. The lighthouse is 12 
 metres in height above the rock but it
 is also 12 metres down into the rock. 
 On a clear night the light can be seen
 at a distance of 29 miles. Recently   
 the lighthouse became fully automatic.
 The light comes from a 3500 watt      
 electric bulb. Big bulls_eye lenses   
 moving round the light makes it flash 
 4 times in 15 seconds followed by an  
 interval of 15 seconds without a      
 flash. In the case of a power cut the 
 lighthouse in run by a stand_by diesel
 generator. It also has an{electric fog
{horn}which is very loud because I can 
 hear it at my house which is in the   
 centre of Kinneff two miles from the  
 lighthouse. The horn sounds 4 blasts  
 of 2.5 seconds every minute.
