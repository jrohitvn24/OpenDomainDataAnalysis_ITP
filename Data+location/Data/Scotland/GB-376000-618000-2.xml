		<title>02HOWNAM'S RESIDENT POPULATION</title>
		<content> In this part of the Scottish Borders, 
 round the village of Hownam, there are
 only 22 houses.Two of these are empty,
 eight are used as second or holiday   
 homes and are occupied for about seven
 months of the year, and the remaining 
 12 are the permanant residences of the
 population. This comprises 10 children
 and thirty one adults, catagorised as 
 two students, twenty four working     
 adults, and five pensioners.The houses
 are almost all stone, with the        
 majority being two storied detached.  
 There is one modern bungalow.There is 
 no problem with employment in the area
 with only one adult unemployed,and all
 but four working within this block. Of
 the remainder all the men and some of 
 the women work on the land, either as 
 employer or employee, sometimes with  
 little help except their own families.
 Such is the way of rural communities. </content>
