		<title>15LEITH MUSEUM</title>
		<content> Since the early 1900s there has been a
 Leith collection of antiquities.      
 Apartfrom displays lasting a few days,
 they were last on show in Starbank    
 House. Many items are still stored in 
 Huntly House.  However, on 17th June  
 1985, an exhibition about Leith as it 
 was up to 1920 opened at the Custom   
 House. It is hoped that attendances   
 will be high and lead to Leith having 
 a permanent museum in the future.     
{LEITH FESTIVAL:MID-JUNE           }   
 Local folk enjoyed Leith Games as long
 ago as 1840 and the Pageant from just 
 after World War 1. Later came the     
 Festival which, for most people begins
 with the{GALA DAY}held on Leith Links.
  During the following week many       
 exhibitions, competitions, sporting   
 events and cultural activities take   
 place at venues within the community.
