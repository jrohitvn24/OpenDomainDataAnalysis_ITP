		<content> This land is part of the Royal Estate 
 of Balmoral, but is also a Nature     
 Reserve managed by the Scottish       
 Wildlife Trust. During the last Ice   
 Age, the classic U-shaped valley      
 itself was formed, and left behind    
 were the cold waters of Loch Muick.   
 New plantaitons of Pine and Larch now 
 clothe the valley bottom The old drove
 road over the Capel Mount to Glen     
 Clova provided the link between the   
 highland glen and the lowland cattle  
 markets. Next to the old 'hospice'    
 building is a Visitor Centre where    
 information about mountain and        
 moorland flora and fauna is displayed.
  A mountain rescue post provides      
 walkers and climbers with access to   
 emergency services. The area is an    
 unoffical sanctuary for red deer which
 are fed by a gamekeeper during the    
 often severe winter months. Other     </content>
