		<content> Rescobie Parish has considerable{Local
{History.}It has been called           
 Rescolpyne, Rescolbyne and Rescolpin. 
 The Res- seems to come from Ros-      
 meaning "a promontory".  -Cobie comes 
 from Sgolb meaning "the point of the  
 thorny place or wood".                
 The Picts have left their traces at   
 Rescobie.  Rob's Reed is an{Ancient   
{Fort}built by the Picts. It is        
 situated on Pitscandly Hill but all   
 that are left are a few foundation    
 stones which are in a circle and      
 covered by grass. The Standing Stones 
 at Blackgate are probably{Memorials}to
 Pictish chiefs who were slain at a    
 battle in 831A.D. There were          
 originally 4 or more stones but there 
 are only 2 now. One had an urn full of
 calcined human bones at its base.     
 There is also the site of a{Souterrain
 along the dismantled railway.         </content>
