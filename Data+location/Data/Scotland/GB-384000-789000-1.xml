		<title>01Glithno - N of Stonehaven</title>
		<content>  An elevated landscape to the north of
 Stonehaven and rather exposed to      
 easterly winds from the neraby coast. 
 The land slopes up to the NW corner   
 culminating in Curlethney Hill at     
 246m. The higher land to the W and NW 
 is moorland an includes the roman camp
 of Raedykes with its bank and ditch   
 systems. This high ground gives birth 
 to 2 streams, the Burn of Muchalls    
 draining to the E and the Burn of     
 Monboys flowing southwards through a  
 glacial meltwater channel. With       
 lessening altitude the land changes to
 rough grazing in squares 5 &amp; 9 but to 
 an extensive wetland moss in square 7,
 in which are peat diggings. Lower     
 still are to be found many small farms
 and crofts with enclosed fields used  
 for hay and silage. A council refuse  
 tip in square 7 pollutes a small      
 stream draining to the moss.          </content>
