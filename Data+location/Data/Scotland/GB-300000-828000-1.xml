		<content> INTRODUCTION                          
                                       
 The block where we live is found in   
 the heart of the Highlands of         
 Scotland.  The area is made up mainly 
 of forest and moorland, but most      
 people live in the lower land of the  
 Spey Valley.  The river itself lies   
 just outside our block but dominates  
 much of the life within the block.    
 Most of the people in the area live in
 Grantown-on-Spey, a town of about two 
 thousand people.  The northern third  
 of the town is contained in our block.
                                       
 Grantown-on-Spey lies on the A95 road 
 about 22km north of Aviemore.  It is  
 close to the A9 which leads to        
 Inverness, the 'Capital' of the       
 Highlands, about 55km away.  Grantown 
 is also 55km from the Cathedral town  
 of Elgin.                             </content>
