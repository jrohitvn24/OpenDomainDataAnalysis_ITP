		<content>{Local}Earlston is a small village and 
 it is a nice place to live in.        
    I have lived in Earlston all my    
 life  so I have seen some changes.    
   All the time I have been living in  
 Earlston, not many new houses have    
 built.Quite a lot of shops have been  
 closed down and different shops have  
 taken their place.                    
        The High School has had a new  
 building added to it which makes it   
 much better.                          
{Incomer}As a newcomer to the          
 area,I have settled in well and made  
 friends.Every summer there is Civic   
 week,with different kinds of          
 entertainment.The school which has    
 been changed recently is quite        
 good.Soon I will be in the High       
 School.Earlston has many basic shops  
 selling lots of things.
