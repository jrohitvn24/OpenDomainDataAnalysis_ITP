		<title>13YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content>   The Gilmerton Youth Club is run by  
 Mr James McKeracher and his wife.  The
 club meets in Monzie Hall twice a     
 week, the 19 juniors between the ages 
 of 7 and 12 on Tuesdays and the 20, or
 so, seniors between the ages of 13 to 
 18 on Thursdays.                      
   Funds are raised by discos in the   
 hall or in local hotels as well as    
 from sales of home produce, jumble    
 sales and private donations.  The club
 provides a variety of amenities and   
 activities in the Monzie Hall         
 including snooker, table tennis, board
 games, rounders, netball and          
 five-a-side football.  The club is    
 very popular and many children in and 
 around Gilmerton use it regularly.
