		<content> Population Study - Letham Village.    
 In Letham there is a population of    
 149.   Of these, 6 are pre-school     
 children, 32 school children and 32 of
 retiral age.                          
    Only 2 people are unemployed.      
 Those who work are engaged in a       
 variety of occupations: teachers,     
 nurses, social workers, farmers,      
 joiners, engineers, architects and    
 computer managers.   We also have a   
 local artist.                         
    By far the most popular hobby is   
 gardening.   Ladies enjoy knitting,   
 sewing and wine-making.   Other       
 hobbies listed are swimming, dancing  
 jogging, golf, fishing, shooting and  
 model aeroplane building.             
    People move to the village because 
 of its pleasant rural setting and easy
 access to nearby towns and cities.
