		<content>    When adults have free time there   
 are a number of things they like to   
 do. My dad likes to go{diving}on      
 Saturday and Sunday. If he goes diving
 and we can't go he brings us sea      
 urchins and shells. We like it when   
 dad goes diving. When my mum has spare
 time she likes to go for a{walk}or    
 drive to places in the car by herself.
    Most houses have{gardens}and some  
 people spend a lot of time in them. My
 next door neighbour sits and watches  
{T.V.}She has a gardener called Fred to
 do the garden for her.                
     There are facilities in Inverness 
 for sports such as{football, squash,  
{swimming, tennis}and{golf.}In autumn  
 and winter months there are evening   
 classes like{needle work, cooking,    
{keep-fit}and{art.}There are also      
 academic classes like{maths}or{       
{languages. }.                         </content>
