		<title>15SHOPPING SURVEY</title>
		<content> Over 3 days 100 shoppers were         
 questioned on their shopping habits.  
 Results are shown as follows:-        
                                       
 Distance travelled to {Clydeview      
{Centre                                
 less than 1 mile      38%             
 between 1-3 miles     48%             
 more than 3 miles     14%             
                                       
 Other questions in the survey showed  
 that the centre was used mainly for   
 purchase of foodstuffs. When shoppers 
 were questioned about major non-food  
 purchases it became obvious that most 
 people travelled to neighbouring towns
 to shop.                              
                                       
 The opening of the Centre changed     
 the previous shopping habits in the   
 area. Several local shops closed as a 
 result, including 2 supermarkets.     </content>
