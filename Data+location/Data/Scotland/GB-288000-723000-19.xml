		<title>19FARMING ON MONZIE ESTATE</title>
		<content>   The Monzie estate covers 1750       
 hectares.  The farming is the main    
 land use taking up 90% of the total   
 land and is a very important part of  
 the local economy.                    
   The farming is extensive and is     
 mainly upland and hill farming.  There
 are seven full-time employees working 
 on the farm and two extra helpers are 
 brought in at lambing time.  Most of  
 these employees stay on the estate and
 those that don't stay locally also.   
   The farm rears suckled calves       
 (charillois and limousin) and lambs   
 (blackface, cheviot and cross-Suffolk)
 a small percentage of the land is used
 for crops, 100 acres of barley and 20 
 acres of seed potatoes.  Crops are not
 generally grown b3cause of the        
 difficulties of cultivating this hilly
 ground.                               
                                       </content>
