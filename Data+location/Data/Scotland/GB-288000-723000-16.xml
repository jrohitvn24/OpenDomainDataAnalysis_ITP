		<content>   This small loch is situated in the  
 most north easternly corner of the    
 area and is surrounded by woodland.   
 There is a small, dilapidated damn at 
 the west end probably built so that   
 the loch could be used for fishing.   
 The loch has wild brown trout in it   
 and a permit for the fishing can be   
 obtained from Abercarney estate who   
 own the loch, the surrounding land and
 the fishing rights.  There is also a  
 boat-house with one boat in it for the
 use of any anglers.                   
   The loch has two streams flowing out
 of it and the woodland around the loch
 provides shelter for a varied         
 selection of wildlife and also a very 
 picturesc setting.
