		<title>11SHOPPING CENTRES</title>
		<content> Over the past five years Mossend      
 Shopping centre has been              
 redeveloped.Although this             
 redevelopment has taken place the     
 customers do not seem to be spending  
 their money there and so the Council  
 has made no further plans to develop  
 this site.                            
    In Bellshill Town Centre a number  
 of indoor markets have been set       
 up.They have proved to be very popular
 and successful with the shoppers. Part
 of their attraction seems to be that a
 varied shopping programme can be      
 carried out sheltered from the        
 inclement weather.
