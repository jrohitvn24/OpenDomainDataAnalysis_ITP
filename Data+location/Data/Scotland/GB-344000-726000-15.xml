		<title>15Farming</title>
		<content> Before tractors were used,{horses}were
 used:They called them pairs because   
 every{ploughman}on the farm had a pair
 of horses to look after,from half past
 five in the morning until half past   
 five at night.In those days more than 
 ten people were employed on the       
 farm,while today the same work is done
 by machines.                          
     Tractors became more and more     
 popular on farms until now they dont  
 use{horses}on Tayport farms at all.   
    Changes in farming in the near     
{future}will probably be gradual,and   
 will include;more advanced machinery, 
 changes in the crops and changes in   
 the stock rearing methods,which are   
 always being improved.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
