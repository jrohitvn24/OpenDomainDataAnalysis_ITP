		<content>    I get up at 8.00 and get washed and
 dressed,then I have breakfast.For my  
 breakfast I have wheatflakes,toast and
 a cup of coffee.By this time my       
 brother John and sister Sharon have   
 already gone to secondary school.When 
 I have finished my breakfast I start  
 to get ready for school I collect my  
 gym kit and put my shoes and coat on.I
 walk to school at a quarter to        
 nine.When I get to school I play for a
 while before the bell rings.We usually
 do maths, reading and language work in
 the morning.                          
    At 10.30 we have milk followed by  
 our morning break.Lunches are supplied
 from central kitchen although some    
 children prefer to bring packed       
 lunches. In the afternoon we have gym.
 School closes at 3.15 then I go home  
 for tea.After tea I usually watch T.V.
 or read until bedtime at 9p.m.        </content>
