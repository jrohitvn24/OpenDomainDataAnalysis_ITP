		<title>10CONSERVATION AREA DUNLOP</title>
		<content> THE CONSERVATION AREA IN DUNLOP IS THE
 MAIN STREET. IT STARTS FROM THE TOP OF
 THE ROAD, UP AT THE CROSS, RIGHT DOWN 
 TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STREET AT THE    
 CHURCH. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY KIND  
 OF CHANGE TO THE FRONT OF YOUR        
 BUILDING YOU HAVE TO APPLY FOR        
 PERMISSION TO THE COUNCIL. SOMETIMES  
 THEY CAN REFUSE WHAT YOU ASK FOR, BUT 
 THEY USUALLY SAY YES. A WOMAN WHO HAS 
 BOUGHT A HOUSE IN DUNLOP JUST         
 RECENTLY, IS HAVING THE WHOLE OF THE  
 HOUSE KNOCKED DOWN BUT SHE HAS TO     
 LEAVE THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING ALONE 
 AND MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO CHANGES    
 MADE THERE, SO IN 100 YEARS TIME ALL  
 THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES WILL BE THE  
 SAME AS THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
