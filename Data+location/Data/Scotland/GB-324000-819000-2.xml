		<title>02THE BRAES DISTILLERY</title>
		<content>  The American company, Chivas Brothers
 built  this  distillery in the 1970's.
 It  is  very  mechanised   with   many
 processes  controlled by the push of a
 button . As a result  the workforce is
 small. The whisky is not stored on the
 premises  but is  transported  in bulk
 tankers  to the  company's  warehouses
 in Keith. The  waste  products,  draff
 and  pot ale  are  transported to  the
 processing plant at Glenlivet.        
   Recently the company  became part of
 Seagrams, the Canadian consortium, and
 the distillery is  run in  conjunction
 with 'The  Glenlivet'  and  the  other
 company distilleries  with  management
 being moved freely throughout.        
   Houses were built  at the distillery
 for management  and others closeby for
 the workforce. All the buildings blend
 in well with their surroundings.
