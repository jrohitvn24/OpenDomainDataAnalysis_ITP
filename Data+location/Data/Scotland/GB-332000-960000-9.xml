		<title>09THE HARBOUR</title>
		<content> During 1985 the outer harbour was     
 deepened and some of the walls        
 refaced, so that boats might use the  
 harbour even closer to low water. The 
 E.E.C. helped provide the money for   
 this.                                 
   The boats still put to sea at half  
 tide on the ebb, and return at        
 half-tide on the flood tide.          
                                       
{SALMON FISHING.}  Nets are erected    
 just outside the harbour and to the   
 south.  The catches this year have    
 been very poor.                       
                                       
{NETMAKING.}  A net repairing business 
 works from a building above the       
 harbour making and repairing nets for 
 the larger deep sea boats.            
                                       
{FISHERMEN.}  There are people who work
 on boats based in Wick &amp; Scrabster.   </content>
