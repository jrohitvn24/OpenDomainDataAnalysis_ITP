		<title>13VANDALISM</title>
		<content> Vandalism is common in this area      
 especially in play parks and public   
 toilets.The most common piece of      
 vandalism is graffiti.This is rude in 
 some ways and silly in others.        
 Vandalism isn't only silly writing but
 it is also ruining our district-For   
 instance,ripping up flowers and       
 pulling out young trees when they are 
 newly planted. Teenagers are often the
 worst for vandalism because they think
 it is smart. The worst piece of       
 vandalism is smashed bottles because  
 someone might slip and hurt           
 themselves. At our school we sometimes
 get the windows smashed and broken    
 glass is left lying all over the      
 playground. This is dangerous and     
 could cause accidents.
