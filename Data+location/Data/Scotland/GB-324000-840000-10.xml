		<title>10Family Life</title>
		<content> There are not many big families in the
 area. The usual is two or three       
 children in each family.              
 Quite a few of the children have      
 grandparents living with them or near 
 them, but most of the children have   
 parents who moved into the area in    
 recent times.                         
 The main reasons for moving into or   
 out of the area are jobs and housing. 
 The main leisure activities are going 
 to clubs, sport, fishing and watching 
 television.                           
 Most people have cars and move around 
 a lot in order to enjoy facilities not
 available locally.
