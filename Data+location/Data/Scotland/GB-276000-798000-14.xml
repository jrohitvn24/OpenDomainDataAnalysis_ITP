		<title>14FARMING in SPEY VALLEY (4)</title>
		<content>{1985}has brought news of farms being  
 sold and farmers trust their leases   
 will continue. Buyers who will agree  
 to leasing back the shooting rights on
 the hills must be found as present    
 landlords wish to maintain these      
 rights as a source of income as well  
 as for personal use.                  
                                       
 Land along the river is being{sold    
 and it is hoped the neighbouring{RSPB 
 will add it to their Reserve. The     
 present owner talks of{draining}this  
 land but this is considered against   
 everybody's interests, perhaps even   
 the farmer, as the soil is poor.
