		<title>01Introduction, Murroes area</title>
		<content>    THE AREA DESCRIBED CONTAINS MUCH OF
 THE ECCLESIASTICAL PARISH OF MURROES. 
   APART FROM{WELLBANK}VILLAGE AND     
{WESTHALL TERRACE,}IT IS ALMOST        
 ENTIRELY INTENSIVELY FARMED LAND,     
 RISING GENTLY FROM THE FORMER DUNDEE  
 BOUNDARY TOWARDS THE FOOTHILLS OF THE 
 SIDLAWS.                              
   IN 1976 WHEN TAYSIDE REGION  WAS    
 CREATED, THE CITY OF DUNDEE DISTRICT  
 WAS EXTENDED TO INCLUDE MOST OF       
{MURROES PARISH.} A SMALL NUMBER OF THE
 RESIDENTS FIND WORK IN THE AREA, OFTEN
 IN AGRICULTURE OR RELATED INDUSTRIES, 
 BUT THE MAJORITY COMMUTE THE SHORT    
 DISTANCE TO WORK IN DUNDEE.           
   ALTHOUGH SO CLOSE TO THE CITY, THE  
 AREA IS SURPRISINGLY RURAL, WITH MANY 
 FINDING AFTER-WORK INTERESTS IN THE   
 NEIGHBOURHOOD.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
