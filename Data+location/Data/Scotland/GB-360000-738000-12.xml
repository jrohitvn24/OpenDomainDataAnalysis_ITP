		<title>12ATTITUDES OF ARBROATH FOLK 1</title>
		<content> We surveyed a number of the {         
{population }who stayed in our area.The
 first two questions showed that quite 
 a lot of them wanted the range of     
 goods in the local shops to improve.  
 Some thought the local{traders}charged
 too much.Among suggestions for        
 improvement were a more personal      
 approach,greater variety of shops,and 
 more modern shops.Most people said    
 they liked the area.Reasons given were
 the {community}atmosphere,the         
 range of clubs and organised          
 groups,the countryside and seaside    
 close by,the climate,even in one case 
 the copper beech trees which grew in  
 the street.Improvements suggested     
 included more play areas for children,
 a decent public{transport}service,more
 public toilets,beach amenity improv-  
 ements,and,most of all a change from t
 he one way traffic system in Arbroath.</content>
