		<title>03Strathmiglo - The Town Hall</title>
		<content> Below this is a block of stone which  
 used to be a sundial on top of the    
 village cross which is said to have   
 been made by the last catholic priest 
 in the village.                       
 In the early days stocks were placed  
 beneath the front of the tower.People 
 found guilty of some offence were     
 chained up.                           
 At the present time, workmen are in   
 the process of converting the bottom  
 floor of the Town Hall into a dwelling
 house. The property was purchased by  
 the people living in the adjoining    
 house and there will be a door way    
 linking the two.
