		<title>16LONGFORGAN - BERRY PICKING -</title>
		<content> I stumbled out of bed at 6.30 a.m. on 
 a morning in the middle of June and   
 got ready for work. I set off at 6.50 
 a.m. for the farm and got a luggie (a 
 small bucket tied with string to the  
 waist) and a large black bucket. I got
 a dreel (a row of strawberries) and   
 started to pick. Soon the berry bus   
 arrived with lots of pickers from     
 Dundee. My hands were quickly covered 
 with berry juice. I emptied the full  
 luggie into the black bucket until it 
 was full and took it to be weighed-in 
 and I got Â£1.30. We got paid 5p a     
 pound. It's hard work but worth it. At
 12.30 p.m. I sat on my bucket and had 
 lunch.Then I picked on till 4.30 p.m. 
 At the end of the day everybody looks 
 awful with berry juice and squashed   
 strawberries on them, which we have   
 thrown at each other. It was worth it 
 as I made Â£6.15 for my days work.     </content>
