		<title>15VEGETATION AROUND GRANTOWN</title>
		<content> In past centuries the area was covered
 by woodland.  Parts of this{CALEDONIAN
{FOREST}can still be seen in the area, 
 mainly isolated Scots Pine.  Through  
 time most of the forest was replaced  
 by heather moorland, which now covers 
 much of the upland area.  This is good
 feeding for grouse and is "fired" from
 time to time to encourage young,      
 tender shoots.                        
                                       
 Broadleaved woodland, mainly Beech and
 Oak, is found on the valley floor.  It
 was planted along the river banks and 
 in the parkland around Castle Grant   
 and Home Farm.  Many of the trees are 
 almost two hundred years old.  More   
 recently plantations of softwood have 
 been set up, run by the Forestry      
 Commission or Seafield Estates.  Many 
 of these plantations are now ready for
 felling.                              </content>
