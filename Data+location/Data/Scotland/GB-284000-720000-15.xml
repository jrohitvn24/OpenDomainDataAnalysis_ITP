		<title>15EPPIE CALLUM'S TREE</title>
		<content> At the west of Macrosty Park, over the
 bridge, an ancient oak spreads its    
 mighty limbs under the shelter of     
 which stands a cottage which bears the
 same name. Its age has benn calculated
 at about 500 years,and its girth      
 measures 6meters.                     
  Legend has it that the acorn from    
 which this tree grew was planted in a 
 teapot by Eppie Callum, but this must 
 be a legend since old residents of    
 Crieff can still remember Eppie Callum
 who kept the pub under the tree.      
  Tradition has it that {ROB ROY} once 
 hid in its branches and that {BONNIE  
{PRINCE CHARLIE} once rallied his      
 highland followers on his way south to
 claim his throne in England.          
  It was damaged by a lightening bolt  
 in the great thunderstorm of 12th,    
 August 1884 but it still stands,      
 keeping its story to itself.          </content>
