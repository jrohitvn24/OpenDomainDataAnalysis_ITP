		<title>17CARSPHAIRN PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>{HISTORY}Carsphairn Parish was formed  
 in 1640 from the northern parts of    
 Dalry and Kells.Carsphairn became a   
 centre for Covenanters,and one of its 
 ministers,John Semple,was summoned to 
 Edinburgh in 1677 and threatened with 
 dire penalties if he did not recant.  
{THE PRESENT}Most people are of        
 Protestant(Church of Scotland)faith.  
 The present church was built in 1815, 
 replacing an earlier one destroyed by 
 fire.The interior is effectively      
 divided by columns into a nave and two
 aisles. Down the centre of the nave   
 runs a long communion table with seats
 down each side, surrounded by a fence 
 with doors at each end.Present        
 membership of the church is around    
 115,but weekly congregations are      
 seldom more than 50, and usually      
 around 20.The church is linked with   
 Dalry and shares a minister with them.</content>
