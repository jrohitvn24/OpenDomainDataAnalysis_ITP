		<title>09***** FIRE ! *****</title>
		<content>   Fires are common here and cause a   
 lot of damage.  It takes from 6 to 12 
 months for a council house to be      
 repaired.  During this time the family
 is usually rehoused.  In the past year
 there have been 36 fires in{Ruchazie, 
 54 in{Garthamlock}and 25 in{Craigend. 
 The fire brigade have 5-8 minutes to  
 attend an incident, but the           
 Easterhouse brigade usually takes much
 less time than this.  Apart from cuts 
 and grazes there were no serious      
 injuries to firemen.                  
   The main causes of the fires were   
 most commonly,{chip/grill pan fires,  
 followed by electrical faults, then   
 careless disposal of smoking          
 materials, children playing with      
 matches or lighted papers, and wilful 
 fire raising or vandalism.            
   There were 35 false alarms last     
 year.                                 </content>
