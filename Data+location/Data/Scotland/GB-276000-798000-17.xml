		<content>{JUBILEE YEAR (1985)}was a wonderful   
 excuse to make the museum come alive. 
 Events were planned throughout the    
 summer to remind us that our history  
 was full of people not just things.   
                                       
 Of course, the museum displays an     
{impressive collection}of every day    
 things.  Kitchen areas, farming scenes
 and spinning rooms are all set out;   
 box beds, chairs and cupboards furnish
 a room; materials and fashions are on 
 display. We all know how the rich     
 lived; here we see how the{average    
{home}might have been.                 
                                       
 In Jubilee Year, however,{crafts and  
{skills}were also demonstrated.  On 2nd
 July sheep were shorn with hand       
 shears, wool spun from fleece, horses 
 shod, tatting demonstrated along with 
 many other occupations and pastimes.  </content>
