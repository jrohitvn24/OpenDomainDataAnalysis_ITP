		<content> There are two means of access-by sea  
 or by land.{By sea}to the landing     
 place and{by land}via a footpath from 
 Tarbert.{The footpath}from the Tarbert
 to Kyles road is clearly defined      
 although in wet weather it can be very
 muddy, and zigzags over the S.E.      
 shoulder of Trollamul. The path is not
 suitable for cyclists nor for people  
 with vertigo as it drops quickly from 
 a height of 280 m to sea level at     
 one point. All supplies of groceries, 
 animal feed, building materials etc.  
 have to come in{by sea}on a 26 foot   
 fishing boat and be landed at the     
 natural stone jetty and carried to the
 houses. This is not a suitable        
 arrangement as the jetty is exposed to
 the prevailing S.W. wind which often  
 means that no matter the time of year,
 it is not possible to land anything,  
 sometimes for days at a time.         </content>
