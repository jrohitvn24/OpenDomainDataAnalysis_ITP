		<title>20MINING..TRADE</title>
		<content> The demise of the mining industry in  
 the Kelty area has had a disastrous   
 effect on trade, especially the       
 Cooperative Society.  The Cooperative 
 provided a large range of services.   
 These included joiners, painting and  
 decorating, plumbing, bakery          
 productions, tailors, a small         
 abattoir, hairdressing, stables, a    
 large garage for accomodation and     
 repairs, a large, very busy Office    
 Building, a cobblers and shoe shop.   
 There was also a large hall for       
 various functions and activities.     
 Today there is only a handful of      
 Cooperative Shops left in the         
 village
