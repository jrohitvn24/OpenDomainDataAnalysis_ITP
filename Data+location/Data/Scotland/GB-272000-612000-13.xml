		<content> On December 31 most people stay up    
 until after mid-night to see in the   
 New Year.On Auld Year's {Nicht}or     
 Hogmanay most houses will be given a  
 thorough cleaning and just before     
 mid-night people will have a wash and 
 change into clean clothes. This is so 
 that nothing of the old year will be  
 carried into the new.                 
 The New Year is toasted and the       
 arrival of the first of,hopefully many
 visitors --the First Foot, is eagerly 
 awaited.It is supposed to be lucky if 
 the First Foot is tall,dark and       
 handsome.He should bare a gift of a   
 piece of coal,black bun or short-bread
 and also offer his host a drink with  
 which to toast the new year.This first
 drink......usually alcoholic and more 
 often than not whisky is called,      
 locally,the New'r Day since it is on  
 new year's first day. {Nicht}=night   </content>
