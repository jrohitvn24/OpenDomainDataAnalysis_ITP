		<title>17CURRIE TESCO PRESTO</title>
		<content> In Tesco's all the staff are well     
 trained and very friendly. The        
 cleanliness and tidiness of this      
 supermarket is maintained to a very   
 high standard. Security is tight,     
 since there are security men within   
 the shop. Shopping in Tesco's is easy 
 because of the spacious layout of the 
 shop, the automatic doors and the     
 quick checkout system. A deposit of   
 10p is paid on each trolley. Tesco's  
 is open seven days a week and uses    
 "sell by dates" to ensure the         
 freshness of products. Shoppers are   
 also permitted to choose their own    
 fruit and vegetables. The store also  
 has a large carpark for its shoppers. 
 Although Tesco's is a very good shop  
 it could be improved by keeping the   
 trolleys within the building and by   
 parking the shoppers' bus in a place  
 of less danger to pedestrians.        </content>
