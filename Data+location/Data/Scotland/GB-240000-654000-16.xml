		<content>    Today's Uplawmoor has grown        
 naturally.In it individually designed 
 modern houses co-exist with Lawrence  
 houses,a row of council houses, an    
 enclave of sheltered housing and a    
 variety of other architectural styles.
    The oldest houses at Neukfoot,now  
 slated,were 'cruck' roof cottages with
 roofs of unhewn tree trunks wearing   
 thatch.                               
    The pleasant little church at the  
 top of the hill is of plainly worked  
 local grey freestone in a restrained  
 Victorian style(1888).The old English 
 style manse is now a private dwelling 
 as a new manse of facing brick and    
 roughcast was built in 1962.          
    Caldwell House is a grand mansion  
 designed by Robert Adam for the Mure  
 family.A security firm now owns it.   
   Caldwell Tower looks down on it all.
