		<title>11The Fort on Gourdon Hill</title>
		<content> There is the remains of a possible    
{iron age fort on Gourdon Hill}near    
 Middle Knox dating back to about      
 700BC-400AD. The shape of the fort is 
 oval. The inside measurement is 79m by
 36m. The fort was surrounded by a     
 rampart on the northern side since    
 this side of the fort was open to     
 attack. The defence wall can now be   
 made out as a mound of rubble. There  
 were no walls on the south side       
 because of the fairly steep natural   
 slopes. Little remains of the fort but
 you can make out what was perhaps a   
{hut circle}made up of possibly 5 or 6 
 huts. There is a probable entrance    
 midway along the NW side.
