		<title>03THE BA</title>
		<content> The{Ba}is a game in which Orcadians   
 compete against each other.The Ba     
 which the men throw about is made of  
{leather}and inside it, is{cork.       
 The Ba was first started by children  
 kicking a ball in the Kirk Green, in  
 the 1840's. After that men started    
 kicking a ball in Broad Street.       
 The Ba takes place at{Christmas}and   
{Newyear}every year.                   
 The two teams are called the{Uppies   
 and the{Doonies.}If the Uppies won it 
 was believed that there would be good 
{farming,}or if the Doonies won it     
 would be a good year for{fishing.     
 There is a men's Ba,a boy's Ba,but no 
 longer a women's Ba because it was too
 rough and there was too much pulling  
 hair,nipping and biting.
