{HOUSING}in our area is all of good    
 quality being a mixture of Local      
 Authority and Private. Cockenzie,the  
 older part, and Port Seton have both  
 grown by areas over the years.{WHIN   
{PARK, THE LORIMERS}and{LINKS VIEW}are 
 some of these. At the 1981 Census     
 there were 1421 dwellings but that was
 largely before the Links View scheme. 
 Housing is in the control of the      
 E.Lothian District Council based in   
 Musselburgh. A number of locals have  
 for many years been staying in        
 Residential caravans at Seton Sands   
 Camp Site by their own choice. Numbers
 of people have bought their Council   
 houses recently and have altered them 
 in some way as a sign to others that  
 they now own their house. These houses
 stand out very clearly from others.
