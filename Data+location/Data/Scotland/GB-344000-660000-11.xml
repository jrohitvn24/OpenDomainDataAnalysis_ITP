		<content> OUR DINNER LADY CAME TO THIS SCHOOL   
 TWENTY YEARS AGO.SHE GOT UP AT SEVEN  
 THIRTY TO GET THE BUS AT EIGHT        
 O'CLOCK.SHE WALKED WHEN IT WAS A NICE 
 DAY.AT BREAK SHE PLAYED HOPSCOTCH,    
 ROUNDERS OR SKIPPING.HER FAVOURITE    
 SUBJECTS WERE MATHS AND HISTORY BUT   
 SHE DIDN'T LIKE SPELLING.MOST SCHOOLS 
 THEN USED A TIME TABLE.SHE GOT READING
 SPELLING OR SUMS FOR HOMEWORK.SCHOOL  
 LUNCHES WERE SERVED AND PACKED LUNCHES
 EATEN OUTSIDE.THERE WERE TWO TEACHERS 
 IN THE SCHOOL AND THEY WERE VERY      
 STRICT.THE SCHOOL WAS LIT BY ELECTRIC 
 BULBS.THERE WERE ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN   
 PUPILS WHICH IS QUITE A LOT COMPARED  
 TO NOW.AT THAT TIME MOST CHILDREN     
 WOULD USE PAPER BUT SOME USED SLATES. 
 THE CHILDREN WOULD SIT IN ROWS IN     
 FRONT OF THE TEACHER.
