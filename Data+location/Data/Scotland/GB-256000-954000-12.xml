 went out to see how many different    
 wild flowers we could find in the     
 square 02590956, that's the square the
 school is in. We searched along the   
 burnside and then we went on to the   
 road and looked at the verges of the  
 road. Altogether we found 26 differ   
 ent kinds and we brought them back in 
 to school and mounted them on card for
 a display. They were:- marsh marigold,
 mint, lady's smock, marsh dandelion,  
 blue &amp; yellow forget-me-not, daisy,   
 St John's wort,fern, bush vetch, bitt 
 er vetch, tufted vetch, bird's foot   
 trefoil, bracken, narrow-leaved plant 
 ain, earth-nut, bog cotton, butter    
 burr, dog-violet, mouse-eared chick   
 weed, speedwell, milkwort, lousewort, 
 broom, tormentil, yellow pimpernel,
