		<content>   The Grain mill is at Lochhill Farm  
 and employs five people operating the 
 cubing plant, mixer and grinder. At   
 harvest time one man is fully employed
 drying grain.                         
   Cereals bought locally and from the 
 Borders are mixed with imported maize,
 soya and linseed to make animal feed- 
 stuffs. The plant produces 150 tonnes 
 a week in the form of dairy cubes for 
 milk cows, rearing cake, replacer     
 pellets for young cattle, poultry     
 meal, mixed grains for hens, pig meal 
 and sheep feed.                       
   There are seven lorries which take  
 feedstuffs in bags to farms and bring 
 raw materials from Glasgow, Edinburgh 
 and Liverpool.                        
    Hay and straw are also bought and  
 sold. Treacle is becoming a popular   
 supplement and is delivered by our own
 tanker.                               </content>
