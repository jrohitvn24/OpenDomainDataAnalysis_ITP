		<title>01Farmland around Pitcaple</title>
		<content> A main road, railway and river run    
 almost parallel through SW corner     
 which has many trees, a castle        
 (sometimes open to the public), P.O., 
 shop, craftshop and filling station.  
 The Aberdeen-Elgin bus service passes 
 daily.  The village nearby consists of
 council housing scheme (some bought   
 now by former tenants) two new housing
 estates - private bungalows - and     
 bigger houses.  Housing - one third   
 council, just under half private, one 
 fifth farm.  Apart from council-owned 
 quarry, farm and aboretum, the rest of
 the land is farmed, more crop than    
 beasts.  the B9001, on which a limited
 bus service runs, traverses area from 
 south-west corner to central north.   
 Undulating terrain makes an           
 interesting landscape, you suddenly   
 lose a landmark that you know is just 
 over the knoll.                       </content>
