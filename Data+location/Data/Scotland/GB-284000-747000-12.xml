		<title>12THE NAME " ABERFELDY "</title>
		<content> There are two legends.                
 The first concerns a bishop named     
{Palladius}who came from Ireland in    
 AD469. He set up home near the{Moness 
{Burn}in what became known as 'the     
 field of the church'.                 
 The{Gaelic}word for Palladius is      
{PEALLAIDH}and the old name for the    
 burn came from this-the{'paldy'}or    
{'faldy'.                              
{'Aber'}means 'at,or near,the{mouth of 
{a burn'}so Aberfeldy means 'near the  
 mouth of a burn'.                     
 The second concerns a water sprite,   
 an{Urisk}named{Paellaidh an Spuit,    
 who lived at the{Upper Falls of Moness
 from where he would come to the town  
 during harvest time to lend a hand.   
 Small offering were taken as payment  
 to this kindly character but if       
 treated disrespectfully,he would      
 become very mischievous.              </content>
