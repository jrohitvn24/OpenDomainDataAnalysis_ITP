		<content>{Sculptured Stone, cont.}- the design  
 however cannot now be identified owing
 to the weathered condition of the     
 surface. The top of the stone has been
 converted into a sundial bearing the  
 date 1698 in incised figures, the     
 first two of which are one and five   
 eighths inches in height and the      
 others two and one eighth inches.     
 Another sculptured stone from Dunino  
 is in the Cathedral Museum, St.       
 Andrews (No. 456).                    
{Stone Circle}- The stone circle that  
 formerly existed near the Church at   
 Dunino has now been  entirely         
 destroyed, but what are believed to be
 portions of some of the original      
 stones are built into the dike on the 
 north side of the roadway at the      
 south-west of the churchyard, about   
 one hundred yards east of its junction
 with the main road to St. Andrews.    </content>
