		<content>  Lundin Links is situated on a raised 
 beach consisting of three steps.The   
 town itself is mainly situated on the 
 flat areas,while the golf courses are 
 on the slopes.On the highist slope    
 crops such as turnips,barley etc. are 
 cultivated on the sandy soil.         
  Lundin Links was formed round the    
 site of Lundin Mill.                  
  The major period of growth in Lundin 
 Links began in 1860.Although the first
 20 years were relatively slow.        
  Lundin Links was developed into the  
 most attractive holiday resort in     
 Fife.New streets were added and roads 
 were formed on the slopes overlooking 
 the dunes.This town has since then    
 expanded in a linear fashion along the
 main A915 trunk road.
