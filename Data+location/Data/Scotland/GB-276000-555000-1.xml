		<content> The area between the village of       
 Gelston and Screel Hill is intensively
 farmed, and includes areas of forestry
 cultivated by the Forestry Commission.
   The small population in the area is 
 by and large connected with farming.  
   The region of Gelston Estate which  
 falls within our boundary is also used
 as grazing or for private cultivation 
 of forestry.                          
 Screel Hill is a popular walk, with   
 trails created by the Forestry        
 Commission marked out for the public. 
 Conifers grown by the Forestry cover  
 two-thirds of the hill, the rest being
 sheer granite.
