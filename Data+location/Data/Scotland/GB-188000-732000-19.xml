		<title>19POLICING IN CONNEL AREA</title>
		<content> There is one police constable station_
 ed at the Police House in Connel.From 
 there he covers the villages of       
 Connel,North Connel,Benderloch,Bonawe,
 Barcaldine and Dunbeg.                
 In summer a large amount of time is   
 spent dealing with road accidents.    
 The 'beat'has a total of 39 miles of  
 roads and a total acreage of 54,720   
 acres.The population in winter is     
 2,500 but it increases to about 10,000
 in summer.                            
 In 1984 the policeman attended 26     
 fires in the area.There is very little
 serious crime.Occasionally houses are 
 broken into and property stolen.Time  
 is spent dealing with routine         
 enquiries like firearms and shotgun   
 certificates which are due for        
 renewal.The policeman has to attend   
 and enquire into any sudden death in  
 the area.                             </content>
