		<title>06TRAGEDY OF PRINCESS VICTORIA</title>
		<content> "On the morning of 31st January 1953  
 the M.V. Princess Victoria left the   
 East Pier, Stranraer, to make its     
 normal crossing to Larne. Off         
 Corsewall Point, the ship encountered 
 the full fury of the gale which was   
 that day to cause so much damage and  
 loss of life throughout the country.  
 Despite the valiant efforts of her    
 crew, the lifeboatmen and other       
 seafarers, The Princess Victoria      
 foundered off the  coast of Northern  
 Ireland with the loss of 133 lives.Of 
 these lost 23 were inhabitants of     
 Stranraer whose death this community  
 mourns."This is the inscription       
 written on the plaque which is        
 attached to a mound of granite stones,
 on which is mounted a huge            
 bronze-coloured anchor.This is the    
 memorial in Agnew Park to the tradgedy
 of the ferry Princess Victoria.       </content>
