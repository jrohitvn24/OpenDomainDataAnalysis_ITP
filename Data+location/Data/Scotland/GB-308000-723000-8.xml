		<content>{REACTIONS OF PERTH PEOPLE             
  The reactions amongst Perth people   
 are mixed:many think the centre is a  
 good idea,and that Perth needs        
 something like this to attract more   
 shoppers.When the plans were passed   
 Perth &amp; Kinross District Councillor,  
 Roy McLean,said he was "Delighted."   
  However,others feel it will ruin the 
 character of the town,Perth being one 
 of the few major towns not to have a  
 shopping mall.A strong protest came   
 from Perth Civic Trust,which said that
 the historic line of Meal Vennel would
 be lost.They have spent Â£3000 fighting
 the first public enquiry. Perth shop  
 owner,Colin Stuart,has been a bitter  
 critic of the scheme as it would badly
 affect peripheral shops in the city:  
 "As far as I'm concerned the people of
 Perth don't want a mall."
