		<content> In 1985 one minister works 6 parishes-
 Kilmany,Flisk,Creich,Moonzie,Logie and
 Monimail.In 1762 Rathillet broke from 
 Kilmany and started a church of their 
 own.Their church was built in 1857    
 however they rejoined with Kilmany in 
 1930.Later in 1960 it closed down but 
 was used as a tattie shed. In the     
 1960's Rathillet church was demolished
 to make way for the Tay Bridge        
 road.Kilmany and Flisk united in 1957,
 while Creich and Moonzie united in    
 1947.A Christmas eve and a Rembrance  
 Service are held in Moonzie each year.
 All four plus Logie united in 1972 and
 in 1983 Monimail linked up with them. 
 From the 15th century Kilmany church  
 was involved with St Andrews          
 University.Thomas Chalmers,a student  
 there,became minister at Kilmany      
 (1803-15)and became famous as 1st     
 principal of New Colledge,Edinburgh.  </content>
