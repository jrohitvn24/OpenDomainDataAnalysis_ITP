		<content>{Disco Dancing}has been popular here   
 for some years. Young people pay to go
 and dance in a darkened hall with     
 coloured flashing lights and very loud
 music.{Break Dancing}can take place in
 a hall, but it often happens out of   
 doors, even sometimes at street       
 corners. Teenagers dance very         
 energetically in time to the          
 breakdance{music.}There are names for 
 each movement- headspin, caterpillar,,
 windmill, moonwalk etc. The dancers   
 move like robots, and other names for 
 this pastime are Robotics and Body    
 Popping. They use battery powered tape
 recorders either of the small personal
 type with headphones-known as Walkman-
 or big portable stereo cassette       
 players.{Its a Knockout}is a team game
 with fun events. Players compete in a 
 variety of silly races, often ending  
 up very wet or covered in custard.    </content>
