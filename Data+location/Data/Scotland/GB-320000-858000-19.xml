		<content>{ MARBLES}We take turns in throwing our
 marbles at each other's marbles and if
 we hit them we are able to keep their 
 marbles.                              
  Marbles are small brightly coloured  
 spheres of glass. Each type has a     
 different name eg. Chinese, Steelies, 
 Americans, Moonies and Spiders.       
{ SKIPPING}Two people hold a long rope 
 and the rest of the group take turns  
 to jump over it as it turns quickly.  
 Sometimes we say a rhyme as we skip.  
 Here is my favourite rhyme_           
          Polly in the kitchen ,       
          Doin' a little stitchin',    
          In comes the bogey man,      
          Boo, and out pops she.       
{ DRAIN TIG}Someone is "it" and they   
 chase the others and try to touch     
 them.If you are touched you are "it". 
 The only safe place where you cannot  
 be caught is on top of a water drain. </content>
