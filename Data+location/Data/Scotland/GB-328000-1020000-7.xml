		<content> Mr.&amp; Mrs. Hourston own{Dounby Farm    
 just outside the village. Four people 
 live on the farm and two people work  
 there.                                
 They have 205 acres of land. Most of  
 his crop is grass for silage and a    
 little bit of barley. Mr. Hourston has
 80 cows and he keeps all his young    
 cattle until they are fat and then    
 sells them. He used to keep chickens  
 but doesn't now.                      
 There are three tractors on his farm. 
 He has a lot of other implements      
 including ploughs, silage cutters,    
 foragers and bailers.                 
 They feed the cows indoors during the 
 winter. In the spring and summer there
 is fencing to mend and weed killing to
 be done as well as spreading slurry   
 and manure, and calving. In the autumn
 there is the harvest.
