		<content>   The coastal settlement of Lower     
 Largo is sited on one of the areas    
 many raised beaches at a height of    
 around 15m.It's population is         
 approximately 600 but this rises      
 significantly with the tourist trade  
 in summer.                            
   The settlement was established      
 firstly as a small fishing port around
 the natural harbour formed by a stream
 entering the Firth of Forth at this   
 point.Currently the harbour area is   
 used mainly for yachts and the        
 importance of fishing and related     
 industries has diminished.            
   The developement of Lower Largo as  
 a tourist spot has centred on it's    
 attractive sandy shoreline which      
 offers safe bathing,a caravan site    
 nearby, possibilities for water       
 sports such as windsurfing an         
 sailing .r                            </content>
