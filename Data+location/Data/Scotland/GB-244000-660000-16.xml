		<title>16GLENIFFER BRAES COUNTRY PARK</title>
		<content> The country park is 5 square miles in 
 area. It is made up of 4 main areas,  
 McDonalds Walk, Robertsons Park,      
 Tannahill Walkway and Glen Park. There
 is also a farm called Brownside Farm. 
 Robertsons Park is mainly a place to  
 rest and also has play equipment for  
 children. Near Robertsons park is the 
 'Bonnie Wee Well.' It has a verse, by 
 Hugh McDonald of Bridgeton,           
 written on a placque beside it. To the
 east of Robertsons Park is Tannahill  
 Walkway and Glen Park. The Glen Park  
 has a one and a half mile nature trail
 in it which can take anything from    
 half an hour to 3 hours to explore.   
 Glen Park also has two dams and the   
 water is used in the dyeworks in      
 Paisley. The small reservoirs are     
 protected by special laws and it is   
 illegal to canoe or swim in them      
 because it is dangerous.              </content>
