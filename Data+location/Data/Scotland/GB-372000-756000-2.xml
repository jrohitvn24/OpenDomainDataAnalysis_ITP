		<content>    Most of the land in our block is   
 natural grassland and "whins".        
    The Links make up most of the      
 natural grassland and it is here that 
 two golf courses and a pitch and putt 
 course have been laid out.            
    A caravan site also occupies a     
 large area of it.                     
    Erosion of the "Bents" is a        
 problem, and work is being carried out
 to try to halt the damage done by     
 holiday makers who have made breaks in
 the natural barrier and have eroded   
 the grass. Huge "blowholes" have      
 appeared and are a real menace to the 
 rest of the dunes.                    
    Glaxo has also caused some erosion 
 problems by levelling off a part of   
 the dunes but they and the local      
 Environment Officer are sure that with
 fencing and the planting of marram    
 grass the damage will be made good.   </content>
