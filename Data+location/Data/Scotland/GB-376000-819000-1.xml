		<title>01ROYAL BURGH OF INVERURIE</title>
		<content> The Royal Burgh of Inverurie is       
 situated in Gordon District in        
 Grampian Region.  The town is sixteen 
 miles North West of the city of       
 Aberdeen and it stands at the point   
 where the River Don is joined by      
 its tributary the River Urie.         
                                       
 The name Inverurie means at the mouth 
 of the Urie. The town motto is URBS IN
 RURE, which means the town in the     
 country. This is exactly what         
 Inverurie is. It is a town situated in
 a rural area which is known as the    
 Garioch. (pronounced "GEE REE")       
                                       
 Overlooking the town to the west is   
 the hill of Bennachie, which rises to 
 a height of 518 metres and dominates  
 the surrounding countryside.
