		<content> Sophie is nearly 12. She lives in     
 Ballater Village and goes to Ballater 
 Primary School                        
 "I get up at 6.30. Feed my rabbit and 
 guineapig with bran, carrots and      
 lettuce. My goldfish has flakes of    
 fishfood. My breakfast is a bowl of   
 cereal. 8.30 go to school all day     
 until 3.15. In class our books are    
 handed out and we work till 11.00. At 
 breaktime we play ball outside. Lunch 
 is at 12.30. Primary 7 sit at the head
 of a table and serve the other        
 children with lunch. In the afternoon 
 we have a talk about Nature. We often 
 go out to see plants. Get home at     
 3.30. Most days I go to Craigendarroch
 pool. After tea I watch T.V. Some     
 evenings I go to Guides or Highland   
 Dancing Classes. At about 9.00 I go to
 my bed."
