		<title>12SHOPPING IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Here in Letham there are several shops
 where you can buy groceries,vegetables
 and meat.In the Post Office you can   
 buy all of these and newspapers along 
 with stamps and postal orders!        
  In the Co-op your shopping will cost 
 you the same as if you shopped in the 
 Forfar Co-op.                         
  There is a baker's and a general     
 store where as well as groceries,     
 sweets and cigarettes you can buy     
 toys or wellingtons and slippers.     
  The only clothes shop is an expensive
 boutique.There are two electricians'  
 but there is no pharmacy.Without      
 transport, you send your prescription 
 via the school dinner van to Forfar   
 and collect it later from the Post    
 Office.                               
  The local library is well stocked and
 is open three times a week.
