		<content>{By Pass                               
 It was originally envisaged that the  
 West Calder by-pass would commence at 
 the A71/A704 junction.It would pass   
 well to the south of West Calder.A    
 study by Lothian Regional Council     
 proposed four options.The most        
 effective option was that the by-pass 
 be effectively phased in.Each phase   
 being able to operate independantly   
 until the other phases were completed.
 So far this has not been put into     
 operation.

 The factory expanded for the first    
 time in 20 years due to an increase in
 orders from Marks and Spencer who are 
 their sole customer.The new factory   
 has a production area of 36000 square 
 feet and is rented from The Scottish  
 Development Agency(S.D.A).The total   
 cost is still not known.              </content>
