		<title>09Employment - Dalkeith</title>
		<content> Dalkeith has a wide range of          
 industries some established over a    
 century ago, while others were        
 attracted a few years ago to the      
 Thornybank Industrial Estate. The     
 industrial importance of the town is  
 underlined by its modern and          
 well-equipped technical and commercial
 college.                              
 The largest employers in Dalkeith are 
 Laidlaw and Fairgrieve Ltd (wool      
 trade), Chas. Letts and Co Ltd (book  
 printing) and Ferranti Ltd (electronic
 and mechanical engineering).          
 Dalkeith and district has always been 
 noted for the excellent type of labour
 to be found here. Very good relations 
 have existed for many years between   
 management and employees; the lack of 
 industrial disputes is evidence of    
 these good relations.
