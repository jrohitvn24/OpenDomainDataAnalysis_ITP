		<content> Aberlour is a popular place with      
 tourists, partly  because of its own  
 attractions, but also because it is   
 quite handy for going to other places.
 One of the main attractions of the    
 place is the salmon fishing on the    
 river Spey.                           
 There is considerable passing trade   
 from motorists and coaches on the     
 Whisky Trail.                         
 There are three hotels in the area,   
 and they are generally busy throughout
 the year but most of all during the   
 fishing and shooting seasons.         
 Businessmen and accountants connected 
 with the local industries put up in   
 them as well.
