		<content> An attractive block of large          
{residential}houses gradually expanded 
 south to the city edge.Many of these  
 houses have been converted to make    
 small flats, hospitals,hotels and     
 old folks homes. In the centre        
 the large{hills}of the Braids and     
 Blackford have been preserved, with   
 the unspoilt steep valley of the      
 Hermitage with its{burn and}          
{woodland.}With{Golf Courses}and       
 farmland around, the Royal Observatory
 and the University's King's Buildings 
 enjoy splendid surroundings. Riding   
 stables near the Braids make good use 
 of the bridle paths. With the         
 new huge Shopping Centre, the area is 
 well served with shops. There are few 
 indoor sports facilities.On the whole,
 an excellent{high amenity area}with no
 major factories or industry.
