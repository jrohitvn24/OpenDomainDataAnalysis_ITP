		<title>20NANT POWER STATION &amp; CREDITS</title>
		<content> The school children visited the       
 station as part of this project.One of
 their parents works there and showed  
 us around. It was very interesting. We
 had to drive a half of a mile down    
 into the hill by range rover. The     
 water from Loch Nant and the          
 surrounding hill streams is used to   
 make hydro-electricity and then it    
 flows down into Loch Awe below to be  
 used again in the normal water cycle. 
 There is plenty of water in this area 
 and the environment is not disturbed  
 too much even by the power station    
 which is hidden inside the hill.
