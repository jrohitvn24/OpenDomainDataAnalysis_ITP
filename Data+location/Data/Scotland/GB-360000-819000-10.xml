 Scottish Women's Rural Institute      
 re-formed in 1946. To-day there are   
 about 30 members. Meetings are held   
 on the third Thursday of each monthh  
 with the exception of July.           
 Meetings consist of a guest speaker   
 talking about matters of domestic and 
 general interest. There are also two  
 competitions, one being baking, sewing
 or knitting while the other is usually
 of an artistic nature such as floral  
 arrangements, greetings cards etc. or 
 making use of oddments of materials.  
 An annual outing to a place of        
 interest is held and fund raising is  
 carried out throughout the year for   
 the children's Christmas Party and    
 local and national charities.
