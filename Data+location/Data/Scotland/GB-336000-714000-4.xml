 Second World War 1939.                
 3.Houses built since 1945 (includes   
 the new{housing}estates){             
{ Housing}in the C.B.D. consists mostly
 of flats (above shops) and terraced   
 buildings.The buildings around the    
 C.B.D. are mainly from Victorian and  
 Edwardian times.On the edge of Cupar  
 lie the post-war developments; both   
 private and{council housing}estates.
