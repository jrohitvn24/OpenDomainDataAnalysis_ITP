  Kinbuck is a small village built     
round the local woolen mill which      
used the Allen Water for power to      
drive the machinery. The mill produced 
tweed. After the mill closed down the  
building was used by Ferranti to make  
electronic equipment but this has also 
been closed down.                      
  Ashfield, like Kinbuck, was built    
round the mill. This mill was a        
printing and die works until it too    
closed down about ten years ago. The   
buildings are now used by another      
manufacturing company.
