		<content> Glenisla School is a one-teacher rural
 school and it is completely surrounded
 by countryside. The school consists of
 two separate buildings. The main      
 building has two classrooms and toilet
 facilities. It was built in 1958 and  
 has full oil-fired central heating.   
 The main building materials are brick 
 and timber. The other building is much
 older and was originally the school   
 itself. It is now used as a general   
 purpose room. We watch television, eat
 our lunch and do gym there. This      
 building is joined to the schoolhouse 
 in which the schoolteacher lives.     
 These buildings are stone-built. There
 is a fairly big playground surrounding
 the school. About half the area is    
 grass-covered and the remainder is    
 hard-surfaced. There is a shelter shed
 for protection in inclement weather.
