 OPERATED FROM BADLUARACH JETTY,BUT    
 ,APART FROM THE SALMON-FISHING,THERE  
 IS NO LONGER ANY COMMERCIAL FISHING   
 FROM THERE OR SCORAIG,ALTHOUGH TWO    
 CREEL BOATS WORK FROM FURTHER UP      
 LITTLE LOCH BROOM.                    
   THE TWO JETTIES ARE USED BY SMALL   
 BOAT-OWNERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE LOCH 
 FOR LINE-FISHING TRIPS.20 YEARS AGO   
 THERE WAS A MUCH GREATER VARIETY OF   
 FISH,BUT IT WAS OVERFISHED BY TRAWLERS
 IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES.NOW,SINCE
 THE COMING OF LARGE FACTORY SHIPS TO  
 NEARBYE LOCH BROOM,EVEN THE MACKEREL  
 ARE MORE SCARCE.MACKEREL APPEAR NEAR  
 THE END OF JUNE,AND CAN BE CAUGHT     
 RIGHT THROUGH TO THE WINTER.AS WELL AS
 MACKEREL THERE ARE COAL               
 FISH,POLLACK,HADDOCK,LING,CODLING AND 
 VARIOUS FLAT-FISH.
