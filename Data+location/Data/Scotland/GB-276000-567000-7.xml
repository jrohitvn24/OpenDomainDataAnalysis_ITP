		<title>07Mrs Edgar of Kirkstyle Farm</title>
		<content> In the last 50 years Kirkpatrick      
 Durham has changed a lot.  The roads  
 and pavements have improved and most  
 houses have been improved because of a
 government grant for improving houses 
 but not many houses have been built   
 and the school has been shut down.    
 A lot of new faces have moved in and  
 the elderly are slowly disappearing.  
 Before Mrs Edgar came to the village  
 there were no toilets and no running  
 water and people had to use the       
 standpipe at the bottom of the        
 village. The farm itself is getting   
 far more modern and the number of     
 employees is going down.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
