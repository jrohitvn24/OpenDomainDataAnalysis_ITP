		<title>14SANDWICK _HOSWICK WHALE CASE</title>
		<content> The housing on the hillside           
 overlooking Hoswick Bay witnessed in  
 1888 a scene which we today would look
 upon with distaste when on 14th       
 September a school of 340 'caa'in'    
 whales were driven ashore.            
   The crofter_fishermen feeling more  
 secure by the Crofters Acts of 1886   
 and no longer fearing eviction        
 disputed the claim by the landlord for
 his customary third of the value.     
   At the Court of Session in Edinburgh
 the case ended in victory for the     
 fishermen who were supported in their 
 legal battle by contributions from    
 Shetland exiles all over the world.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
