		<content> VILLAGERS  WERE ASKED IF THEY WOULD   
 LIKE  ANY IMPROVEMENTS MADE REGARDING 
 HOUSING. HERE ARE THEIR COMMENTS.     
                                       
 More houses needed, especially        
 pensioners houses.                    
                                       
 I feel happy with the high standard of
 housing in the area.It has been well  
 planned in the past,and is therefore  
 essential  that this standard be      
 maintained in the future.             
                                       
 There should be less delay in the     
 reallocation of council housing which 
 leads to so much loss of revenue to   
 the local authority.                  
                                       
 OF THE 30 PEOPLE INTERVIEWED, MOST    
 FELT A NEED FOR MORE HOUSING; ONLY 2  
 INDICATED THAT THEY DID NOT LIKE THEIR
 HOUSE.                                </content>
