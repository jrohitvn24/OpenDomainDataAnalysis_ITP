		<title>14The M9 M/Way Stirling(contd)</title>
		<content>   Over 100 lorries pass by in half an 
 hour, and about{60}vans, especially at
 the end of the week.  Private         
 coaches use the M9 daily, but there   
 are more in the summer with tours.    
   On market days cattlefloats use it  
 as it is a convenient and quick route 
 for farmers in Central Region.  The   
 percentage of motor bikes using it is 
 much lower than other vehicles.  It is
 also a quick route for police and fire
 engines in case of accidents.         
   On average most of the traffic is   
 northbound, as this will eventually   
 meet the{A9}for the north of Scotland.
 The M9 is most definately a busy and  
 essential motorway for any driver as  
 it cuts down mileage and saves time.
