		<content> The main centre of habitation on our  
 grid is the village of Springholm,    
 population approx.350, situated 6     
 miles northeast of Castle Douglas and 
 12 miles southwest of Dumfries on the 
 busy A75 Euro-route from Stranraer    
 (and Ireland) to Carlisle. Springholm 
 was built in the early 1800's and at  
 one time was served by a railway.     
 Springholm's new primary school was   
 opened in 1969 and presently has about
 80 pupils. There are 2 small shops in 
 the village, both general stores. A   
 high proportion of Springholm's       
 housing is council built but many of  
 the houses have been bought by        
 tenants. The remaining area of our    
 grid is almost entirely farmland, used
 either for grazing or silage/hay. The 
 terrain is gently rolling hills with  
 only one stream, of any significance, 
 Spottes Burn, part of River Urr.      </content>
