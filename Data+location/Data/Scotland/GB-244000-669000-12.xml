 The Automobile Association has its    
 offices in Fanum House on the banks of
 the River Clyde in Erskine.  It was   
 opened in 1975.  It has seventeen     
 departments with one hundred and      
 seventy staff.  Some of these         
 departments include travel            
 information, public relations, legal  
 services, insurance and breakdown     
 services.  Many of the services       
 provided by the A.A. in Erskine cover 
 the whole country.  Other services,   
 such as the breakdown service, are    
 more localised.  The A.A. makes good  
 use of computers.  It is testing a new
 computer in the breakdown department. 
 The A.A. provides employment for some 
 local residents.
