		<title>12EDUCATION IN LEUCHARS</title>
		<content> Leuchars has a primary school which   
 was built in 1965. One member of our  
 group attended this school and Mr     
 Marr, who showed us round was his     
 headmaster before he moved onto Madras
 College, St Andrews. The school roll  
 is 220 pupils, about 80% of whom are  
 connected with the RAF station, which 
 means frequent changes of pupils.  We 
 found out from local books about the  
 earlier schools in Leuchars.  In the  
 19th century, it is mentioned that    
 Latin, Greek, grammar, sewing and     
 practical mathematics were studied.   
 Another school, the forerunner of the 
 present modern one, was to be found   
 on School Hill. It was the parish     
 school, and there were other schools, 
 some fee paying.  Also mentioned is a 
 Sunday School which was "well         
 attended".  Nowadays, most pupils like
 the new modern building.              </content>
