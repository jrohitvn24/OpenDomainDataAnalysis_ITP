		<title>15Arbroath,Health centre.</title>
		<content> The new health centre in our patch was
 built very recently, and contains     
 surgeries for three doctors' practices
 several clinics and a dentist.        
    It is situated quite near to the   
 centre of the town and from the       
 outside it looks a very boring        
 building but inside it is pleasant and
 modern.                               
     The receptionist told us that the 
 doctors and patients seem to like the 
 idea of all the different things being
 under one roof.Some people thought    
 that they might not be able to see    
 their own doctor but this is not      
 so.Each doctor has his or her own area
 which is colour-coded .They are       
 separate but it means that doctors can
 meet and talk more easily to each     
 other.
