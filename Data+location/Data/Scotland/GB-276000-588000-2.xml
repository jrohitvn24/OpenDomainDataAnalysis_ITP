		<content> This is an area steeped in history.It 
 was an important resting place for    
 pilgrims on their way to Whithorn     
 Abbey,it was a stopping place for the 
 stagecoach on its way from Dumfries to
 Glasgow and abounds with monuments to 
 and stories of the Covenanters.The    
 main road is the A702 from Edinburgh  
 to Dalry but the B729 is possibly of  
 greater importance as it goes to      
 Dumfries.Most people are employed in  
 farming and forestry but a few        
 professional people live here and the 
 rest of the working population are    
 either self employed builders,shop    
 assistants in the village's 3 grocer's
 and post office,work in the areas 3   
 hotels,are employed in the electrical 
 contractor's or travel to sundry other
 jobs in Dumfries.Finding employment is
 difficult however especially for the  
 young and many are forced to leave.   </content>
