		<title>08SYMINGTON LIBRARY IN 1985</title>
		<content> There has been a library in Symington 
 for about 20 years.In our survey out  
 of 10 people 3 do not go a lot to the 
 library 7 of them do. Mrs Holmes      
 (librarian and part-time secretary)and
 Mrs Blake run the library along  with 
 help from some others. The library    
 building is very close to the Primary 
 School. Every class visits the library
 once a week. Out of 8 people surveyed 
 6 go once a week to the library,1 goes
 once a fortnight and 1 once in three  
 weeks to the library. The most popular
 type of book is adventure.Next comes  
 fiction and then fact.3 people said   
 they were too busy to visit the       
 library  more often than they do.     
 Everyone in the village can apply for 
 a library ticket and use the library  
 as often as they wish.Each book can be
 borrowed for 3 weeks.If your book is  
 overdue you are fined 5p per day.     </content>
