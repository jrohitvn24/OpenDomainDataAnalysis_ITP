		<title>12Coal Mining.</title>
		<content>{Coal mining}used to be a major        
 employer in this area. Gilmerton was  
 widely known as a mining village      
 though the pit at{298681}has now been 
 closed  for many years. The nearst pit
 is at Loanhead just south of this     
 D-block.It is an important local      
 employer.In the late 1970's Hyvots    
 Bank Primary School had to be closed  
 down when a hole appeared in the      
 playground.Several other cases of     
 subsidence due to mining have         
 occurred.The cone-shaped spoil heap   
 just south of Gilmerton forms a       
 prominent land mark and is a reminder 
 of this industry. The Miner's Welfare 
 Club in Newtoft St.plays an important 
 part in the community.                
 The only coal now mined in this block 
 comes from the open-cast site at      
 292672.
