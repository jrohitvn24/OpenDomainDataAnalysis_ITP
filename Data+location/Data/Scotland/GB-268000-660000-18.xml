		<title>18The Viewpark Market</title>
		<content>                                       
      Every Wednesday the market comes 
to Viewpark. Other days it is in       
Bellshill or Glasgow. You can always   
smell the hot dogs as you go down.     
There are the shouts about goods and   
prices. The vegetable and the clothes  
stalls are the busiest.  Even when it  
is wet and rainy there are still a few 
customers attracted to the market.     
When the weather is fine the place is  
always packed, especially during the   
summer holidays.                       
     The old, cheery lady shouts to    
buy her sweets and never mind the      
teeth;the fruit and veg. man says come 
and get your tropical fruits here. The 
jewellery stall catches the sun-light. 
The market is a popular place with     
shoppers both happy and grumpy, look-  
ing for bargains.
