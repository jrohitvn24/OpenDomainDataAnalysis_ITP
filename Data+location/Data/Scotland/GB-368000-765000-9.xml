		<title>09MARYKIRK COMMUNITY COUNCIL</title>
		<content>    The job of a{Community Councillor  
 is voluntary.  The villages in one    
 area are involved in community        
 councilling.  Monthly meetings are    
 held in Laurencekirk involving the    
 following villages-Auchenblae,        
 Drumlithie, Fettercairn, Fourdon,     
 Garvock, Laurencekirk, Luthermuir and 
 Marykirk.  The councillors deal with  
 the complaints or requests they have  
 heard during the last month.          
    There is one annual meeting which  
 the public attend.  A complaint or    
 request has to go through different   
 stages-e.g. if a new street light is  
 wanted on a dangerous corner it is    
 discussed at the meeting then a       
 request is made to the lighting       
 department. Representatives can bring 
 village matters to the attention of   
 the{District}or{Regional Council      
 through the Community Council.        </content>
