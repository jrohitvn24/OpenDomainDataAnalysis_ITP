		<title>06ONE DAY IN MY LIFE_1</title>
		<content>  My Mum wakes me up at seven o'clock. 
 I do not like getting up early. We go 
 down for breakfast before we get into 
 our School clothes.I have cereal in   
 the morning but if we are having      
 packed lunch we have an egg as well.  
   I wash before I get into my school  
 clothes. My brother and I sometimes   
 make the packed lunch.Then I say good 
 bye to my Mum and baby sister.I       
 sometimes go to School at nine        
 o'clock.I play with one of my best    
 friends while I wait for the bell to  
 ring.                                 
  First I do my maths which I find     
 quite hard.So I am glad when playtime 
 comes and I am ready to eat the snack 
 Mum gave me.                          
  After playtime I do my English which 
 can be S.R.A. or workbook work cards  
 or Personal writing  spelling or I do 
 Nature work.                          </content>
