		<content>  Forteviot's manual signal box is     
 being altered this year.The level     
 crossing of gates is being replaced by
 an automatic barrier and will be      
 operational by November.              
  In preparation for this change the   
 southern access road has been not only
 widened,but it's gradient has been    
 raised.And where priority had         
 previously been given to the Forteviot
 B935 Aberdalgie road priority has now 
 been given to the Dunning-Aberdalgie  
 road.                                 
  During this change the Forteviot road
 users had to adhere to traffic        
 lights and so could only use one side 
 of the narrow road at a time for about
 a fortnight.                          
  As a result of this change there are 
 to be some job losses.
