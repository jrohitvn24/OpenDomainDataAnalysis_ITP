		<content> Guildtown Primary School is the only  
 school in our Project area. It is a   
 typical Scottish Rural School catering
 for all children in the area from age 
 5 to 12. Like most of the others it   
 was built in 1875 following the       
 Education Act of 1872. It has been    
 extensively added to and has been     
 continually modernised since then.    
 Today there are 65 pupils in three    
 classrooms_ Primary 1&amp;2 in one;       
 P3,4&amp;5 next and P6&amp;7 in the third     
 room. There is a reasonably large hall
 which doubles as a Dining_room and    
 Gym. Adjoining the building there is a
 very large playing field in which     
 there are two football pitches, two   
 sets of swings, a roundabout and a    
 large climbing frame.                 
 Most of the pupils travel to school by
 private bus provided by the Education 
 Authority.                            </content>
