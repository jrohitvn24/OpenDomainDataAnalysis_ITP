		<content> Lloyds is a company which sells all   
 the latest in farm machinery,         
 including tractors, trailers,         
 combines, ploughs and harrows. A      
 register in Carlisle is used to supply
 the firm with their equipment, and all
 their wares are made in Britain. There
 is a shop on the premises where people
 can buy things like 3-wheeler         
 motorbikes, clothes and garden        
 machinery. The property was completely
 rebuilt in 1983 following a fire.     
 The farms around Chirnside grow mainly
 grain crops, chiefly barley but also  
 some wheat. Peas, broccoli, sprouts   
 and potatoes are also grown and       
 recently oilseed rape. Beef cattle and
 sheep are raised. Farming provides    
 full-time and seasonal employment.    
 Building, carpentry, painting and     
 plumbing businesses,the school, shops,
 garages and hotels provide other work.</content>
