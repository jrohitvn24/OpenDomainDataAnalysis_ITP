		<content>{THE NORTH CHURCH,}formerly called the 
{'SEEDERS' CHURCH}stands in the        
 old burial ground. It was built in    
{1752}by the congregation who carried  
 the stone for the building by horse   
 and cart from nearby quarries. It was 
 closed for public worship in 1965 but 
 is used on occasions for exhibitions. 
{THE SOUTH CHURCH AND MANSE,}Main      
 Street was built in{1835.}It has,     
 within the building, a vestry and     
 kitchen area. The church bell is rung 
 every Sunday before morning service,  
 and once yearly to herald in the NEW  
 YEAR. The church is linked with {     
{GARTMORE,}a nearby village, and the   
 minister looks after both parishes,   
 conducting two services every Sunday. 
 During the week there are meetings of 
 the Women's Guild and the Young       
 Women's Group. Children attend Sunday 
 School from October to June.          </content>
