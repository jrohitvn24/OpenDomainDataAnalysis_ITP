{WINTER}In winter the stronger sheep   
 are left on the moor and the weak     
 sheep and that years small lambs are  
 fed on the croft or inside sheds for  
 the months of January and February at 
 least. The ones inside are fed and    
 watered twice a day. In the morning   
 with feeding stuff and in the evening 
 with hay. The outside ones are fed on 
 feeding stuff twice a day and they    
 roam about the croft eating what grass
 is available. The sheep and lambs are 
 regularly fed drenched, dosed and     
 dipped throughout the year.
