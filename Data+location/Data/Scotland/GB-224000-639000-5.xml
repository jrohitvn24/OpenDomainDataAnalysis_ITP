		<title>05SHOPPING IN SALTCOATS</title>
		<content>  The shopping centre in{Saltcoats     
 serves a wide area, with people       
 travelling from up to{20 miles away}to
 do their weekly shopping. As Saltcoats
 has grown in importance, the nearby   
 shopping centres in Ardrossan and     
 Stevenston have gone into decline.    
  The main shopping area -{DOCKHEAD St 
 - has{chain stores}like "BOOTS" and   
 "WOOLWORTHS". It is currently being   
{pedestrianised}and this is meeting    
 with a mixed reception - in a survey  
 done for{DOMESDAY}80% of the public   
 liked it but only 34% of the          
 shopkeepers liked it, claiming that   
 they had lost trade because of it.    
  A new{indoor arcade}opened recently  
 at the periphery of the town centre   
 but is proving unsuccessful.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
