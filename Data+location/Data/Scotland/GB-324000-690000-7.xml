		<content>  {Kirkcaldy}is the main shopping      
 centre for Fife, and the{High Street  
 is the busiest shopping area.         
   There are many different kinds of   
 shops, although there aren't as many  
 private shops as there used to be     
 because many big companies have bought
 them. But the original buildings are  
 still there, though the shop fronts   
 have been modernized.                 
   There are chain stores and still    
 some shops owned by local traders,    
 such as{Pillans}(baker),{Brown's      
{Bazaar}(sports),{Rutherfords          
 (chemist).                            
   There are shops to please everyone- 
 D.I.Y.'s, Sports shops and takeaway   
 food shops.                           
   Sometimes it is so busy, especially 
 on Saturdays, that you cannot find a  
 parking space, and you have to wait in
 queues for a long time to be served.  </content>
