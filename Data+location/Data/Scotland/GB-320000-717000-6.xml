		<content>       The{Highland Games}are held up  
 at{Mugdrum Park.}It is an annual event
 and draws in quite a crowd.{Radio Tay 
 (our local radio station) usually has 
 a stand there and they hold           
 competitions like name that tune and  
 true or false.                        
    There are many races such as the   
 800 metres. I have come in second last
 and fourth last. There are also the   
 1600 metres and the 400 metres.       
    In 1984{Geoff Capes}competed in    
 the tossing the caber event .There are
 lots of small stalls where you can buy
 food .The Highland Games are a great  
 family outing .If you get bored with  
 the games you can go to the funfair   
 which is just outside the park.       
    Every year the local schools       
 compete in a relay race for a trophy. 
 Newburgh School has won it for four   
 years in a row.                       </content>
