		<content> The police station at Sanquhar is a   
 part of the Dumfries &amp; Galloway       
 Constabulary, and it's manned by 7    
 full-time police officers. The local  
 inspector is also responsible for the 
 police stations at Thornhill and      
 Kirkconnel, these statons being run by
 the sergeant. The full-time policemen 
 can be augmented by a number of       
 Special Constables who are called out 
 when special conditions prevail. The  
 local Fire Service is a volunteer     
 group retained and trained by Fire    
 Brigade headquarters 26 miles away in 
 Dumfries. In emergencies the firemen  
 are alerted by a special alarm system 
 and they turn out the appliance within
 minutes of being alerted. People      
 charged with minor offences may be    
 tried in the local Justice of the     
 Peace court - more serious crimes are 
 dealt with in Dumfries Sheriff Court. </content>
