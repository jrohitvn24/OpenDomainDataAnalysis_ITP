 The institute must be cost effective  
 and redundancies are expected.The only
 restriction placed on the scientists  
 is the work must relate to U.K. crops 
 The research is concentrated on       
 improving crop quality and the        
 evaluation of control measures used   
 against diseases and pests. Climatic  
 and cultural factors and disorders of 
 nutritional and physiological origin  
 are also studied.                     
  Rabbits are the only animals used in 
 experiments but many insects including
 aphids are used.At the moment there is
 no research on new crops for the U.K. 
 but this has been done in the past    
 e.g.lupins and oil seed rape.The      
 Tayberry,a cross between a raspberry  
 and a blackberry,was created at       
 Mylnefield.
