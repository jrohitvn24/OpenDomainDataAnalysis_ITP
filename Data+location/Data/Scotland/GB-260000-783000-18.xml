 My grandad is the brewer. His job is  
 to see all the processes of whisky    
 making are carried out properly by the
 men under him. The barley is made into
 mash. The extract is filtered off into
 fermenting vessels through a cooler at
 a temperature no more then 70deg.F to 
 be mixed with yeast.Here it stays for 
 70hours in vessels called washbacks.  
 From there it is pumped to the still  
 house to be distilled twice. The first
 time the liquid comes from the still  
 it is called low wines. From the low  
 wines' still it is distilled again and
 the impurities are taken off after    
 running for 20minutes. In 2 to 3 hours
 it is put into another still and there
 it is called yeasts. After it is mixed
 with low wines from the next still it 
 is distilled again.Then it is put in  
 oak casks and stored at least 3 years.</content>
