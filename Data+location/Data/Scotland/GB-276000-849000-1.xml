		<content> Our block consists of a rural         
 community with seven farms and two    
 main housing areas namely the village 
 of Croy and Tornagrain.There are also 
 four forest plantations.The population
 of the village is approximately 270   
 and there are 66 children in the      
 village school who are taught by 4    
 teachers.                             
 Unemployment is generally high but a  
 majority of those employed work at the
 Arderseir oil rig fabrication yard.   
 The area is not well served by        
 public transport because a very high  
 percentage of villagers have their own
 transport.There are 5 bus services    
 which come through Croy.It is hard to 
 stay out in Inverness for an evening  
 because the last bus reaches Croy at  
 6.20pm.
