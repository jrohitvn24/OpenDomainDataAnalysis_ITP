{OUR BLOCK COVERS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF 
 THE TOWN OF LARKHALL AND THE          
 COUNTRYSIDE TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF  
 THE TOWN.THE TOWN ITS SELF IS A FORMER
 MINING TOWN IN AND AROUND WHICH 30    
 PITS WERE WORKED BEFORE 1950.HOWEVER  
 THESE PITS WERE SMALL WITH A MAXIMUM  
 WORK FORCE OF ABOUT 100 MEN. THE LAST 
 PIT CLOSED IN 1969.SURPRISINGLY THERE 
 ARE FEW SIGNS TO BE SEEN IN THE AREA  
 OF LARKHALL'S MINING INDUSTRY, THE FEW
 COAL BINGS TO BE SEEN AROUND THE TOWN 
 ARE FAIRLY SMALL AND ARE OVER GROWN,  
 LOOKING AT FIRST SIGHT SIMPLY LIKE    
 GRASSY KNOLLS.HOWEVER, SINCE THE      
 CLOSURE OF THE PITS, THE TOWN HAS     
 ACTUALLY EXPANDED BECAUSE OF THE      
 TOWN'S FAVOURABLE LOCATION ASTRIDE THE
 GLASGOW TO LONDON MOTORWAY AND THE A71
 RUNNING EAST-WEST FROM EDINBURGH TO   
 AYR.                                  </content>
