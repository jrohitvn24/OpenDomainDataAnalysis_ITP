		<content> I LIKE LIVING AROUND WHITSOME BECAUSE 
 IT IS PEACEFUL COMPARED WITH THE TOWN.
 SOME OF THE CHILDREN HAVE AN ADVANTAGE
 IF THEY LIVE ON A FARM BECAUSE THERE  
 IS MORE ROOM TO PLAY. IN THE TOWN YOU 
 JUST HAVE YOUR GARDEN AND HOUSE. THAT 
 IS ONE THING THAT I LIKE LIVING IN THE
 COUNTRY FOR. IN THE TOWN SOME CHILDREN
 ARE CLOSED IN AND THEY DONT SEE THE   
 OUTSIDE THAT OFTEN. THE PEOPLE WHO    
 LIVE IN THE COUNTRY SEE THE OUTSIDE   
 ALL THE TIME AND THEY KNOW WHAT IS    
 GOING ON.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
