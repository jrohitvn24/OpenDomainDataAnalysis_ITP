 The work on this block was undertaken 
 by the{pupils and staff of Crawford   
{Primary School.}                      
 We would like to thank the many people
 in the village who gave of their time 
 to assist us in the collection of     
 material.                             
 The collection of data for the project
 was most interesting and we discovered
 many things about our village.We      
 looked at the history of Crawford and 
 produced a tape/slide show on the     
 village.We also made up our own play  
 about William Wallace and his visit to
 the village.                          
 We found the Domesday Project very    
 interesting and worthwhile.
