		<title>13A Farmer's Day</title>
		<content> Mr Ross,the farmer  gets up at 7.00am 
 to start his daily chores.He starts by
 telling the workers what their chores 
 are for today .The farmer feeds his   
 calves  and beds them with straw. Once
 this is done he goes round his fields 
 to check the bigger cattle are        
 alright. After this is done he goes   
 for his breakfast and reads his       
 mail.When he is finished he goes out  
 to help the workers with what they are
 doing.                                
 Some things they may be doing are,    
 fencing, cleaning ditches and drains, 
 planting potatoes, sowing turnips,    
 spread fertilizer, spraying for weeds 
 etc.At noon they stop for an hour for 
 their dinner .In the afternoon they   
 finish what they were doing in the    
 morning.Then at 5.00 pm they stop work
 for the day.After tea the farmer      
 prepares for the next day.            </content>
