		<title>11Housing and Settlement</title>
		<content> Recent settlement in the village is   
 reflected for example in the Primary  
 School Roll since 1975 when the full  
 effect of oil development began. In   
 two year phases, from 184 pupils in   
 1975, numbers move through 260, 265,  
 260, 255, to 230 in 1985.             
 At the same time housing has been     
 provided with 132 high value houses   
 built. Residents in these are mainly  
 professional executive oil-related    
 personnel. The rapid inflow of        
 newcomers is slowing down.            
 Early 20th Century housing is Granite 
 roofed with slate. Council housing has
 been Harled cement block roofed with  
 tile or shingle with the latest being 
 40 imported prefabricated timber.     
 Owner-occupier development has been   
 mainly of timber-frame with a variety 
 of decorative cladding and tile roofs.
