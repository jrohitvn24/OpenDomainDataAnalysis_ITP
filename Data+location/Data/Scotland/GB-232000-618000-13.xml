		<title>13 TIMES PAST IN SOUTH-AYR</title>
		<content>   We wondered if Alloway had changed  
 during a lifetime so we spoke to a    
 lady of 86 who has lived here since   
 1911.                                 
{                                      
{DIFFERENCES}The school was very small:
 only 2 teachers, now 17 teachers.     
 Pupils wrote on slates as paper was a 
 luxury. No school uniform was worn.   
 There were fewer houses. Church       
 congregations were smaller. The church
 officer was also janitor, bell ringer,
 lamp lighter and grave digger. Trams  
 ran in the streets. There was a       
 strawberry field. People made their   
 own entertainment. Belleisle Golf     
 Course was ploughed up for crops      
 during the 1914_18 war.               
{                                      
{SIMILARITIES} The old village is still
 the same. Burns' Cottage looks the    
 same but has now many more visitors.  </content>
