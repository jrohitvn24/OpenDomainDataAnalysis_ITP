		<title>04Public Library Dalgety Bay.</title>
		<content> Above the Commercial Centre there is a
 small public library which has to     
 cater for readers of all ages in      
 Dalgety Bay.The largest part of the   
 library is the adult novel section    
 which is comprised of thrillers,      
 romance,science fiction and historical
 novels.There is a small reference     
 section for adults dealing mainly with
 cookery and gardening.The library     
 provides plenty of attractive fiction 
 books for young readers.However there 
 is an inadequate supply of fiction for
 the 11-14 age group and the junior    
 reference section is limited.The      
 library,although small,is well-lit and
 furnished with comfortable chairs     
 where children can browse through the 
 books chosen.The library staff are    
 very helpful for if a particular book 
 is not in stock they will order it    
 from Dunfermline Central Library.     </content>
