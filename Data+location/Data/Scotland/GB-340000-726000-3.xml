		<content>   Crop farming is the main type of    
 farming carried out in the area, as   
 the rainfall is low and this part of  
 N.E.Fife lies in a rain-shadow area   
 created by the Lomond Hills.          
   The soil is light and gravelly, due 
 to glaciation in the past, and it     
 dries quickly and drought is a        
 problem. In spite of this farming is  
 successful but the farmers have to    
 work hard.                            
   A large farm has about six workers  
 and the number of people needed has   
 dropped, as it is cheaper to use      
 machines.                             
   Barley, wheat, grass, potatoes,     
 oil-seed rape, mangolds and some soft 
 fruit are grown.The newest crop is    
 oil-seed rape which is being grown    
 more and more by E.E.C. countries. The
 oil is a substitute for soya bean oil 
 imported from the U.S.A..             </content>
