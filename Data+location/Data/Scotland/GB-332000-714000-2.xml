		<title>02ECOLOGY..WILDLIFE HABITATS</title>
		<content> Although much of the area is rich     
 farmland nonetheless our survey has   
 shown that there is a rich diversity  
 of wildlife habitats still in         
 existence.There are many kilometres of
 hedgerow along road sides and field   
 boundaries.Wide grass verges exist    
 along all of the winding country roads
 which criss-cross through our         
 area.Several fields near Cupar have   
 been permanent pasture for as long as 
 anyone can remember and as such they  
 provide a natural habitat for several 
 creatures.A few derelict quarries on  
 the Mount Hill are now filled with    
 water and these pools attract         
 frogs,newts and water insects.        
 Contrasting with this on the upper    
 slopes of Mount Hill there are large  
 areas of rough grazing with broken    
 patches of woodland and bracken;Ideal 
 cover for deer,rabbits and pheasants. </content>
