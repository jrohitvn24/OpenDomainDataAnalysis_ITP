		<title>11The Janet Street Fair</title>
		<content> This fair introduced in 1975 is held  
 in Janet Street because it is the     
 widest street suitable for stalls and 
 people.Organised by the Round Table it
 raises money for charity which was    
 Â£6000 last year.It takes 3 weeks to   
 arrange nearly 50 stalls which attract
 about 5000 people.It is held on a     
 Saturday at 18.30 because it is the   
 most convenient time for everyone.    
 Round Table members set up stalls for 
 raffles,garden produce,cake and candy.
 The most popular are the teddy bear   
 and bottle stalls.Decorations are     
 chosen by the members and it costs    
 Â£250 to run the fair.Prizes to be won 
 are watches,teddies and sweets.The    
 most unusual raffle prize was a live  
 lamb.Hungry customers can buy hot     
 dogs,barbequed food and ice cream.The 
 funniest stalls were for custard pie  
 throwing and pouring water over people</content>
