		<title>14PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content>{Hide and seek cont.}I like the game   
 because you find good places to hide  
 and the man can't find you.The thing I
 don't like about the game is being the
 man,because I can never find anybody. 
{ Tig:}You find someone to be man and  
 he touches you and says"teen,tig"or   
 something like that.The game goes on  
 like that until someone goes away or  
 if somebody doesnt want to play.I like
 tig because if you go on the grass you
 slide everywhere.                     
  A game we only play in Auchnagatt is 
 called{Lineo.}There are lines marked  
 outside on the playground,as many     
 people as you want can play.You start 
 off with one man who chases everyone  
 round the lines and tries to catch    
 somebody.If you are caught you are the
 man.Also if you go off the lines you  
 are it.We all like it.
