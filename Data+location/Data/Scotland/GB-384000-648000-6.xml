		<content> ARCHIE FISHER AND CAROLINE ADAM FROM  
 THE BBC, RADIO TWEED, CAME TO         
 INTERVIEW US BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO   
 SPEAK TO SOME CHILDREN OF A SMALL     
 VILLAGE SCHOOL.   THEY WERE DOING A   
 PROGRAMME ABOUT A SMALL COMMUNITY AND 
 ITS EVERYDAY LIFE.   THEY INTERVIEWED 
 SOME OF THE OLD VILLAGERS WHO TOLD    
 WHAT THE SCHOOL AND VILLAGE WERE LIKE 
 WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG.   AT THE START  
 OF THIS CENTURY THIS SCHOOL HAD THREE 
 TEACHERS AND OVER A HUNDRED PUPILS BUT
 NOW THERE IS ONLY ONE TEACHER AND NINE
 PUPILS.   THERE WERE THREE JOINER'S   
 SHOPS AND A BLACKSMITH, NONE OF WHICH 
 NOW REMAIN.  FIDDLERS CAME FROM ROUND 
 ABOUT TO PLAY FOR DANCES AT THE       
 SCHOOL.   NOW THERE ARE ONLY FOUR     
 CHILDREN IN THE VILLAGE AND MOST      
 PEOPLE ARE ELDERLY SO IT IS VERY      
 QUIET.                                
                                       </content>
