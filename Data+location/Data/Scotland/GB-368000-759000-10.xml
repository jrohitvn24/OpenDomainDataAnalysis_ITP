		<title>10Lack of Amenities,Montrose.</title>
		<content> In 1984, the local Primary School     
 carried out a{survey}of the attitudes 
 of parents to the lack of services and
 amenities in the{Borrowfield area.}At 
 the time of the survey there was only 
 one small shop (Spar),one pub (Black  
 Abbot), a community centre built and  
 funded by local residents, and the    
 school. Given the choice of shops in  
 the area, a chemist was by far the    
 most preferred. Next came a post      
 office followed by a supermarket,     
 butcher and bakery. Again, a doctor's 
 surgery was clear favourite in a      
 choice of "services" with a bank      
 second. A police office came third in 
 the voting. The lack of amenities in  
 the area is a concern to all groups in
 the community and there seems to be   
{little hope of any improvement.}We    
 will have to continue to go "up the   
 street" for nearly all of our needs!  </content>
