		<content>  ...helpless because I could not ease 
 my parents money worries. Mum put a   
 brave face on and tried to keep       
 cheerful but the larder was not so    
 full, although no one went hungry.    
                                       
 Mum was not sleeping well and one day 
 she burst in to tears when, yet again,
 negotiations fell through. Finally in 
 March  1985, the strike ended. I hope 
 it never happens again. It was hard   
 being part of a miners family in time 
 of strike.
