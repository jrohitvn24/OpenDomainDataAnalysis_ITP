		<title>11TOURISM IN GLASSARY</title>
		<content>   ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO HOTELS OR     
 BOARDING HOUSES IN THE VILLAGE, MANY  
 TOURISTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD VISIT
 GLASSARY EACH YEAR. MANY VISITORS COME
 TO ENJOY THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF THE    
 LOCAL COUNTYSIDE BUT MOST VISITORS    
 COME TO SEE THE CAIRNS, STANDING      
 STONES AND CUP AND RING ROCKS         
 WHICH ARE TO BE FOUND ALL OVER        
 THIS AREA.                            
  THE CHURCHYARD TOO, HAS MANY         
 VISITORS. SOME TO STUDY THE MANY OLD  
 GRAVE STONES AND SOME TO TRY TO TRACE 
 THEIR ANCESTORS. ONE RECENT VISITOR   
 FROM AUSTRALIA WAS TRYING TO LOCATE   
 THE GRAVE OF HER ANCESTOR WHO WAS HEAD
 TEACHER OF GLASSARY SCHOOL IN THE     
 1830'S.                               
  FISHERMEN ALSO VISIT THIS AREA       
 BECAUSE OF THE MANY LOCHS AND RIVERS  
 WHERE SALMON AND TROUT CAN OFTEN BE   
 CAUGHT.                               </content>
