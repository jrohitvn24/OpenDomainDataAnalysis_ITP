		<content> Glaick: The forestry office and a turn
 of the century house lie at the bottom
 of the road to Glaick which is the    
 highest point for miles around. The   
 family came to Glaick in 1927. They   
 have 40 beef cattle and 140 sheep and 
 also grow oats, barley, swedes,       
 turnips and grain. The farmer uses    
 tractors, a plough, harrows, ridgers, 
 cultivator discs, a small bailer, hay 
 turners and turnip sowers. Normal     
 working hours are 7am to 9pm but in   
 the lambing season this can be 6am to 
 11pm (and even through the night). The
 family don't have holidays.           
                                       
 Loanreoch: This has a small homestead 
 but is mainly woodland with some      
 livestock. There are a lot of sheep   
 some of which are Moorit sheep.  There
 may also be a few St. Kilda sheep.
