		<title>05The High Street</title>
		<content> On the High Street there is a road and
 a lot of cars go on the road.There are
 a lot of people doing their shopping. 
 The main shops they go to are the     
 Co-op and the Spar. There are         
 chemists, carpet and wallpaper shops  
 and if you want some clothes you      
 should go to Arnotts. There are lots  
 and lots of shops on High Street: I   
 like the sweet shop best of all and   
 the toy shop as well.There is a       
 Clydesdale shop and the Coffee Pot.I  
 like the Coffee Pot as well because I 
 get cakes in there.There is a hotel   
 called The County and there are three 
 churches - Trinity and Alvah, St.     
 Mary's and St. Andrew's. Men are      
 building a house on High Street just  
 now so you must be careful as you walk
 past.
