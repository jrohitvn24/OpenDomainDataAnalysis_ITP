		<title>15WATERS OF DEANSTON DISTRICT</title>
		<content> The fast flowing RIVER TEITH rolls    
 over the dam at Deanston and flows    
 down towards the Bridge of Teith,     
 bounded by the mainly conifer Wood of 
 Doune on the north &amp; the road on the  
 south. Many salmon &amp; sea-trout pass up
 through this stretch of river each    
 year on their way to the spawning     
 grounds. Water is drawn from the Teith
 to form a lade, a channel of water,   
 once used to drive the mill wheels &amp;  
 later turbines in Deanston works.     
 LOCH WATSTON is in a picturesque      
 setting of trees &amp; fields. Access is  
 by a path from Loch-hill Toll.Once a  
 haunt of local anglers, now silted up,
 it is a haven for geese &amp; other birds.
 Other small burns in the area include 
 ASHMILL BURN which flows from the     
 Watston farmlands in an easterly      
 direction to join the Teith south of  
 Doune Castle.                         </content>
