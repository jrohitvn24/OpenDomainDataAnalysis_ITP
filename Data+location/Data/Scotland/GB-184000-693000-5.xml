		<content>{ AN INTERVIEW WITH MRS. ROSE MC MILLAN
 IN 1948 I CAME TO KILMICHAEL-GLASSARY 
 FROM DENMARK WITH MY HUSBAND, WHO HAD 
 BEEN A SOLDIER WITH THE BRITISH ARMY  
 IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR.              
  WHEN I ARRIVED HERE THERE WERE ONLY  
 THREE OR FOUR HOUSES IN THE VILLAGE. I
 LIVED IN THE {HIGH BUILDING}WITH FIVE 
 OTHER FAMILIES; EACH OF US HAD ONE    
 ROOM AND A KITCHEN. WE HAD NO INSIDE  
 TOILETS, RUNNING WATER, GAS OR        
 ELECTRICITY. WE HAD TO COLLECT WATER  
 FROM A WELL WHICH WAS OPPOSITE THE    
 CHURCH. WE COOKED OUR FOOD OVER AN    
 OPEN FIRE AND OUR HOUSES WERE LIT BY  
 PARAFIN LAMPS.                        
  I HAVE SEEN MANY CHANGES. KILMICHAEL 
 FOREST HAS BEEN PLANTED, GROWN TO     
 MATURITY AND NOW MUCH OF IT HAS       
 NOW BEEN CUT DOWN.                    
                                       
                                       </content>
