		<title>19MONITORING POWER SUPPLY,RHUM</title>
		<content> Most power is supplied by a 30 kW.    
 turbine. In addition,a smaller Pelton 
 wheel turbine, which has been in use  
 since 1946, was extensively overhauled
 and coupled to a 15kW., 3 phase brush_
 less alternator.At the same time, a   
 sophisticated monitoring and failsafe 
 control system was installed. This    
 shuts down the hydro_electric systems 
 automatically for a variety of reasons
 ranging from electrical faults and    
 overloads to a low water reading. As a
 standby/backup unit, a diesel engine  
 driving a 30kW 3 phase brushless      
 alternator is used. This has automatic
 start_up facility, so will start and  
 generate electricity automatically, if
 the hydro systems fail for any reason.
 This scheme,since commissioning has   
 functioned well;apart from the inevit_
 able teething troubles! This cheap,   
 reliable power benefits the community.</content>
