		<content>     As you drive north on the A9 past 
 Inverness towards Kessock Bridge you  
 will see on your right 169 acres of   
 land.This has been reclaimed from     
 mudflats along the south shore of the 
 Firth.It is Inverness Town Dump.In    
 another century it could be twice as  
 wide.It is a real asset to the town.  
 The dump is a very busy place.All day 
 lorries come and go.Even on Sundays   
 you can drop off your old T.V.set or  
 your garden rubbish.                  
 To reclaim land tyre walls are built  
 to make lagoons.These are filled with 
 hard core.Then rubbish goes in with   
 soil on top.Trees and bushes begin to 
 grow.                                 
 The methane gas below is being        
 monitored to see if the land will be  
 safe for buildings.The old dump of    
 coal ashes nearer the bridge will be a
 permanent site for travelling people. </content>
