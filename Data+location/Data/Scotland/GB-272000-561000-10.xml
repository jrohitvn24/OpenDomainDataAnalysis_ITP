 One person goes and hides while the   
 rest of the people count to 200 with  
 their eyes shut. Once they have       
 counted to 200 they go separately to  
 try and find the person who is hiding.
 When the first person finds the person
 who was hidden they both stay hidden  
 until everyone who was playing has    
 found the person who hid originally.  
 The first person who found the hider  
 gets to hide from everyone in the next
 game.                                 
 Hightig is just a normal game of      
 chasing except that if you are        
 standing or sitting on anything higher
 than ground level you can't be tigged.
 You are only allowed to be on the same
 thing for 20 secs.at the most. Once   
 your 20 secs.are up you must not come 
 off the high place to get chased to   
 another. If caught you become chaser. </content>
