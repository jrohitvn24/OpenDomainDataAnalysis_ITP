		<content> This area is sparsely populated with  
 scattered mixed farmland and          
 farmhouses offering bed/breakfast. The
 landscape is mainly purpose planted   
 coniferous trees on the mountainside  
 with deciduous trees and open         
 grassland and farmland in the dales.  
 North east is Faire Mhot, a mountain  
 which stands 1592 feet above sea      
 level. The south easterly point is    
 Lochbroom Burn which joins the River  
 Tummel. It is popular for salmon      
 fishing. South westerly point is East 
 Hough, a hamlet of few people but has 
 a small pottery, tea room, arts and   
 crafts gallery, agricultural supplier 
 and a preparitry school.  There is a  
 daily bus service. The north westerly 
 point is Edrodour  where there is a   
 whiskey distillery, a hotel and a     
 childrens' home.
