		<content> During 1984 the population of         
 Glenprosn increased  due to a change  
 from some cottages being occupied as  
 holiday homes to full occupation.     
 As at May 1985, the population of the 
 whole Glen is 87 people.              
  There are 25 families.               
  The average size of family is 3.5    
  There are 13 pre school age children.
  There are 16 primary school age and 8
 secondery school age children.        
 There are 9 old age pensioners.       
 The average age  of the people in the 
 Glen is therefore very young.         
 In the small inhabited area of our    
 Domesday patch live 27 people.        
                                       
 During the past 13 years the Rev.D.   
 Leadbeater has christened 8           
 children, married 3 couples and held 3
 funerals in Glenprosen Church.
