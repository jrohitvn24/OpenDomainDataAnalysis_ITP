		<title>14FISHERTOWN NAIRN</title>
		<content> Long ago the{fishertown}in Nairn was  
 called{Seatown}.The houses were built 
 by the fishermen for their families.  
 The roofs of the houses were all{     
 thatched.The fishermen used to keep   
 pigs in a small pen at the front of   
 their house, these were helpful in    
 consuming rubbish.A{fishertown}house  
 would have had two rooms upstairs and 
 two rooms downstairs. The houses were 
 very low.They were built close        
 together with their gable-ends facing 
 the sea in an area between the west   
 beach and the harbour.To the visitor  
 the streets of{Park Street,Union      
{Street,Society Street}and{King Street}
 seem an unitelliglible maze.Few       
 fishing families live there today but 
 many of the houses have been          
 modernised by the building of         
 extentions containing bathrooms and   
 kitchens.                             </content>
