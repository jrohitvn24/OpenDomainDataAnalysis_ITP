		<title>10LOCAL HISTORY OF SANDHEAD</title>
		<content> by Kenneth Rowan aged 12              
    One site of particular interest in 
 our village is a large raised circle  
 of soil called a "motte". Local       
 historians are of differing opinions  
 as to the origins of this motte, one  
 of a number on the Rhinns of Galloway,
 but I like the one that says they were
 Pictish forts set up to defend the    
 tribes against marauding Vikings in   
 the 7th and 8th Centuries A.D..       
    There is also an old ruin in the   
 middle of Balgreggan Wood. It belonged
 to the Maitlands but, when they died  
 the house went to their cousin, a Miss
 Weir, who was very generous to the    
 community of Sandhead village. She did
 not live in the house and it was used 
 by the R.A.F. during the war. After   
 the war Miss Weir had the roof taken  
 off to avoid paying rates. It fell    
 into ruin and had to be pulled down.  </content>
