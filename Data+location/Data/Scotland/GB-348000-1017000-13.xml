		<title>13BOAT-BUILDING</title>
		<content> On{Shapinsay}there is a boat builder. 
 He makes{fishing boats}from 10 to 30  
 feet long.Usually he can make 6 small 
 boats in a year and 1_2 big ones.The  
 wood used is{oak}and{larch}which comes
 from Dingwall in the north of         
 Scotland.When the wood arrives it is  
 in rough planks with the bark still   
 on.The boat builder has to{plane}it   
{sand}it and{treat}it till it is       
 suitable for use. He also has to cut  
 it to size. First, he lays the{keel   
 then sets the{ribs. }Next the side    
 planks have to be{steamed}into shape  
 before being nailed onto the ribs. The
{nails}are made of{copper}which won't  
 rust.They are so expensive he         
 doesn't buy many at a time.           
 At the moment he is so busy, two men  
 work for him.The boat they are        
 working on is for{prawn fishing.}It   
 will go to the Black Isle Ross-shire. </content>
