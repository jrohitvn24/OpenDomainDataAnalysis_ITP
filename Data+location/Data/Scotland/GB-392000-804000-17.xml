		<title>17RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> Aberdeen's railway station is at      
 Guild St,comprising both goods and    
 passenger facilities.It is situated   
 adjacent to the harbour area. Once    
 famous for its daily "fish trains",it 
 was said that Billingsgate's freshest 
 fish was from Aberdeen! Usage of the  
 goods station has declined with       
 freight increasingly going by road.   
 The station is presently being        
 renovated as an open plan station with
 no ticket barriers.                   
 Typical of certain trains is the high 
 percentage of oil workers travelling  
 to and from and Aberdeen.Easily       
 identified by thermal jackets and     
 sports bags they alight en masse and  
 race along the platform to the nearest
 taxi rank and thence to the heliport  
 at Dyce.These trains are also         
 characterised by their high spirit and
 alcohol levels!                       </content>
