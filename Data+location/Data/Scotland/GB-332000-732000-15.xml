		<title>15    THE GRAY HOUSE</title>
		<content> The Gray House is a noble mansion,    
 situated on a beautiful plateau which 
 was built for the 9th Lord Gray by    
 Willian Adam. It is within a spacious 
 park near the Southwestern borders of 
 the county.Along the South side of the
 park there is a grand avenue with very
 large trees on each side extending in 
 a straight line from the Eastern      
 entrance, onwards to the village of   
 Benvie being a mile in length.        
   Near the mansion the grounds are    
 tastefully laidout and contain a fine 
 garden lawn in the front of the house 
 and tennis lawns to the East of it.   
 They are rich in well grown shrubbery 
 and  uncommonly large trees, of many  
 hardwood sorts.Near the front there   
 are cedars of Lebanon of immense size.
 The grounds however are overgrown with
 weed and the house in disrepair.The   
 Grays held the lands for nearly 3Ct.  </content>
