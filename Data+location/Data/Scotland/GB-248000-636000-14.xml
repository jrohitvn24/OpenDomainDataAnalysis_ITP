		<title>14RELIGION-GALSTON</title>
		<content> The main place of worship in Galston  
 is the Parish Church which has a      
 congregation of 1250 followed by St.  
 Sophias with 450.There are two smaller
 houses of God,the Evangelistic and the
 Church of God.The largest of the two  
 churches was built in 1850 and the    
 other in 1809.In a study of the Parish
 Church it was revealed that only 25%  
 of the congregation went to church    
 every week.Out of this 25% were under 
 the age of 20;65% between 20 and 65   
 years and 15% over 65. The people of  
 Galston form a well integrated        
 community although some people are    
 very aware of the different traditions
 of the two denominations. There is    
 however almost no religious friction  
 in the town.
