		<title>17BRECHIN CIVIC WEEK</title>
		<content> A Civic Week is held each year in     
 early June although as the programme  
 has grown in recent years some events 
 have spilled over to later weeks.This 
 year the final of the darts           
 competition took place 3 weeks after  
 the opening disco and Civic Queen     
 competition.Events vary from sporting 
 (bowling,swimming,golf,football), to  
 factory visits,to hobbies(pet show,   
  steam railway), to art exhibitions   
 and musical evenings.Also a Fun Fair  
 visits the site of the traditional    
 "Taranty Market". A Pageant Day is    
 held on the first Saturday of the week
 with decorated vehicles (this year the
 Young Wives Group, dressed as clowns, 
 won),Pipe Bands,Highland Dancing,a Fun
 Run and sideshows,stalls and          
 demonstrations by local clubs and     
 organisations. Most of the community  
 enjoy this time each year.            </content>
