		<content>  The roads in this area are without   
 exception{minor roads},which are      
 randomly distributed throughout the   
 area. The roads are narrow with       
{passing places}interspersed along the 
 route, to enable overtaking of large  
{farm machinery}as well as to allow    
 passing of vehicles approaching from  
 the opposite direction. Some of the   
 roads follow{field boundaries,}which  
 help farmers in the area in that they 
 can easily check fields and crops.    
 These roads also make the movement of 
 heavy farm-machinery from field to    
 field viable.{Access roads,}however,  
 usually take the form of rough, dirt  
 tracks which haven't been surfaced due
 to cost and this results in rapid     
 deterioration especially during wet   
 periods when heavy farm machinery     
 breaks up the loose surface.
