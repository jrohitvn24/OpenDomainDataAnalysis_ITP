		<title>07EMPLOYMENT IN ASSYNT</title>
		<content> We have in some respects been         
 sheltered from the effects of         
 recession on employment in Assynt. A  
 lot of people have more than one job  
 to rely on. The major employers are   
 the Assynt Estates, Lochinver Fish    
 Selling Company, Highland Stoneware   
 Pottery &amp; various service industries, 
 &amp; shops which operate for both        
 residents &amp; Tourists &amp; Crofting. The  
 dual job syndrome comes about because 
 not all of the jobs can be sustained  
 on a full-time basis. An example of   
 this would be a person, working his   
 croft by day and loading fish at the  
 market in the evening. Many people are
 forced to work long hours out of      
 economic necessity. The distance from 
 the nearest towns &amp; railheads, makes  
 basic essentials very expensive       
 commodities, and our community is     
 therefore disadvantaged as a result.  </content>
