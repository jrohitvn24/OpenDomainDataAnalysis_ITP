		<title>03Ayrshire Agricultural Show.</title>
		<content> Ayrshire{Agricultural}Association's   
 143rd Annual Show held at Ayr Race    
 course 1st and 2nd May attracted over 
 19000 visitors from all over U.K. and 
 abroad. A major attraction for the    
 farming community the show covers all 
 aspects of agriculture including      
 livestock, implements, trade exhibits 
 and{show jumping. }The show is heavily
 sponsored by banks and is seen by     
 farmers as their main chance to view  
 machinery, discuss finance,evaluate   
 latest developments.  It is an        
 opportunity to demonstrate{farming    
 skills,display livestock and compete. 
 The importance of competition is      
 emphasised by the judging of          
 the'Champion of Champions' being the  
 main event.   Attempts to attract     
 local people outwith the farming      
 community have had little success but 
 efforts continue.                     </content>
