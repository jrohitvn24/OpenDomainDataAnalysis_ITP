		<content>   In Govan women usually{entertain    
 themeselves by going to the{bingo.    
 The pub or stay at home to watch the  
 television.                           
   Children have quite a lot to do in  
 this area, e.g. they have disco's     
 which are usually held in the local   
 community centre.  You usually find   
 boys playing{football}in the street.  
 There is a pool hall where you can    
 find people of all ages.              
   The senior citizens go bus runs with
 the local community centre in the     
 summertime and they have parties in   
 the centre on special days e.g.       
 Christmas.                            
   People can go to the pictures to    
 entertain themeselves but they have to
 go into town as we don't have a       
 picture hall in Govan area.
