		<title>09TO BE A FARMER'S WIFE</title>
		<content> A normal working day begins at 7a.m.  
 with breakfast for the family of 4.   
 Feet into wellies &amp; it's off to feed  
 the free range hens a hot mash, not an
 easy job, slithering in mud in pouring
 rain. Back to the farmhouse to tackle 
 all the daily household chores before 
 coffee break. Be it market day it's   
 back out to help gather &amp; pen the sale
 stock ready for loading. A lot of time
 &amp; sweat lost. Lunch time is usually   
 12o'clock, work dictates. Must have   
 plenty in the pots for 'drop ins'.    
 Baking is the next job. The telephone 
 rings. It's for the Farmer. Search &amp;  
 shout 'phone'. More dirt trailed in.  
 Hens to feed, eggs to collect &amp; clean.
 School is out.Boys are starving. Meal 
 at 5.30p.m. Wash up &amp; tidy up then    
 attend to any mail.At last it's off to
 the Rural or Guild, or fireside,T.V. &amp;
 knitting. A hectic yet satisfying day.</content>
