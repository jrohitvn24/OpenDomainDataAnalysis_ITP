		<content> THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN GET TO THE  
 ISLAND OF RAASAY IS BY THE FERRY.THIS 
 MAKES GOODS A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE   
 BUT YOU CAN GO TO AND FROM THE ISLAND 
 IN YOUR OWN BOAT IF YOU HAVE ONE.THE  
 RAASAY FERRY MAKES FIVE TRIPS A DAY.IT
 GOES TO SCONSER AND BACK AGAIN.THE    
 FERRY CAN CARRY ABOUT SIX CARS AT A   
 TIME.THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE EMPLOYED ON
 THE FERRY.THERE ARE ALWAYS THREE      
 EMPLOYEES ON THE FERRY AT ONE TIME AND
 ONE MAN IS THE RELIEF.IF THE FERRY    
 IS NEEDED IN AN EMERGENCY ALISDAIR    
 NICOLSON GETS A PHONE CALL AND THEN HE
 CONTACTS THE CREW AND THE FERRY IS    
 READY TO LEAVE RAASAY IN ABOUT 15     
 MINUTES AFTER HE HAS RECEIVED THE     
 PHONE CALL.STRONG SOUTH EASTERLY WINDS
 AFFECT THE FERRY THE MOST AND PREVENT 
 IT FROM CROSSING BUT THIS HAPPENS VERY
 RARELY.
