		<title>18TOURISM IN BADLUARACH</title>
		<content>   ALTHOUGH THE NORTH-WEST END OF      
 LITTLE LOCH BROOM IS AN AREA OF       
 NATURAL BEAUTY WITH SPECTACULAR VIEWS 
 OF THE SEA,THE ISLANDS AND THE        
 SURROUNDING MOUNTAINS,IT HAS NOT BEEN 
 DEVELOPED AS A TOURIST CENTRE AND ITS 
 APPEAL IS FOR THOSE SEEKING A QUIET   
 HOLIDAY. IN BADLUARACH THERE IS ONE   
 HOUSE OFFERING BED AND BREAKFAST, ONE 
 HOLIDAY COTTAGE  AND ONE CARAVAN FOR  
 HIRE.                                 
   BADLUARACH JETTY IS USED BY TOURISTS
 TO LAUNCH SMALL BOATS AND IS          
 INCREASINGLY USED BY DIVERS,EITHER    
 WITH INFLATABLE DINGHIES,OR DIRECTLY  
 FROM THE JETTY.SOME DIVERS COLLECT    
 SCALLOPS BUT MOST SIMPLY ENJOY LOOKING
 AT THE MARINE LIFE IN THE CLEAR WATER.
 BECAUSE THERE IS NO REALLY SHELTERED  
 ANCHORAGE YACHTS RARELY VISIT LITTLE  
 LOCH BROOM.THERE IS NO FRESHWATER     
 FISHING HERE.SEA ANGLING IS ARRANGED. </content>
