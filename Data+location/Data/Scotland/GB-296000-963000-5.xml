		<title>05UPPER DOUNREAY FARM</title>
		<content> Upper Dounreay:_ A large farm taken   
 over by the government in 1920 and    
 broken up into small holdings to rent 
 to farm workers or others trying to   
 begin a career in farming. After the  
 1939/45 war some of these small farms 
 were paired. By 1985 the smallholders 
 have by law been able to buy their    
 farms and to sell them. One can can   
 see the former large farm of Upper    
 Dounreay being put together by        
 purchase and amalgamation. The land is
 similar to Isauld and is very good    
 Caithness soil with similar cropping  
 potential.The high cost today of farm 
 machinery makes it very difficult for 
 a young man to begin farming himself  
 and is hastening the demise of small  
 farms as viable units. We are thus    
 seeing the end of an experiment in    
 social farming and this will further  
 empty the countryside of people.      </content>
