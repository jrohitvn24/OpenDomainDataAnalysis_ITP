		<content> One of the drawbacks to Sanquhar      
 growing much more is the geography of 
 the area. Surrounded by hills, and in 
 the narrow valley created by the River
 Nith, Sanquhar can only expand by     
 following the course of the river. The
 other main concern for any company    
 setting up in the town would be the   
 inadequacy of transport facilities.   
 Although on the main A76 trunk road   
 running from S to N, the only routes  
 eastwards follow very narrow valleys  
 with very steep gradients. There is no
 egress from the town westwards. There 
 is no longer a railway station even   
 though the Glasgow-Carlisle line runs 
 through the town. Townspeople who do  
 not own a car find it very difficult  
 to travel outwith the immediate area  
 as the bus service has been greatly   
 reduced over the last 5 years. The    
 nearest airport is in Glasgow.        </content>
