		<title>04A DAY IN MY LIFE-TUESDAY</title>
		<content> When my alarm goes off at 7.10am I    
 switch on my television.  I watch it  
 until 7.35am then I get up and have my
 breakfast.  I have cornflakes and     
 toast.  After breakfast I go through  
 to my bedroom and get dressed.  I     
 clean my teeth and brush my hair      
 before I get my coat on.  I say       
 "Goodbye" to my mum and go to get my  
 bike ready.  I go up to Claire's house
 and wait till she comes out.  We both 
 go up the hill together and then turn 
 left at the crossroads.  It is now    
 downhill all the way to the school.  I
 put my bike against the wall and take 
 off my bag.  I go and put my bag down 
 in the P7 line.  I then play with     
 Claire.  We play until it is time to  
 go inside.  When we get inside we have
 music.  After music we do language    
 work.  Some of us go to recorder.  I  
 do.                                   </content>
