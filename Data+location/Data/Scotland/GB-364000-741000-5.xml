		<title>05Farming, Mr. Stirling.</title>
		<content> Mr.Stirling was moving some cows to   
 another field and we took the chance  
 to interview him for our project.He   
 said he was very glad to be           
 involved.Mr.Stirling has a            
 dairy/arable farm of l,400 acres and  
 120 cattle.He plants potatoes,oil seed
 rape,barley,wheat and flax.Throughout 
 the year,he works an average of nine  
 hours a day.Some of his jobs depend on
 the weather.One of his wet-weather    
 jobs is dressing potatoes.This means  
 picking out the stones and bad        
 potatoes before putting them into     
 boxes for sale or keeping for seed.   
  Mr.Stirling started on the farm      
 twenty-seven years ago when he was    
 fifteen years of age.                 
   A great many things have changed.   
 Machines now do most of the work that 
 used to be done by men.
