		<title>16THE GAMEKEEPER, BRODICK</title>
		<content> I am the gamekeeper's daughter,Lindsay
 Ross, and live at The Kennels in the  
 Castle grounds.The Kennels are about  
 100 years old and 40 pointers were    
 kept here for hunting grouse.1400     
 grouse were shot each year until 30   
 years ago.They have declined in number
 and today less are shot in the hope   
 that numbers recover.In February my   
 father is concerned with vermin       
 control- hooded crows, mink etc.      
 After heather burning to encourage new
 growth in Spring, the checking and    
 repair of fencing is done to keep deer
 off the road.  Pheasant eggs are      
 collected in the Spring and hatched   
 under broodie hens before releasing   
 later in the year. A deer management  
 programme is carried out and a close  
 watch is kept on the overall deer     
 population which a the moment stands  
 at 1500 on the island.                </content>
