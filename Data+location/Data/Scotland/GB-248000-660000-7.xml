		<content> In the different seasons the farmers  
 of{Harelaw Farm} do different work. In
 Spring they do spring-cleaning which  
 involves cleaning and white-washing   
 the outhouses,for example the byre.Hay
 is made in July and August.           
 The daily routine of the farmer begins
 when he gets up at 5.30 a.m. and has  
 some coffee. Then he brings in the    
 cows and milks them until around 8    
 a.m. Next he puts them out to graze   
 until milking in the afternoon.He then
 has his breakfast after which he feeds
 the calves by hand.He has lunch at    
 mid-day.In the afternoons he mucks out
 the byres and does the milking again. 
 At 5.30 p.m. he has his evening meal  
 and looks forward to the end of his   
 day.The farm is a busy place and      
 there is always something to take care
 of.
