		<title>17Employment in Brechin</title>
		<content>    We sent home some questionnaires   
 to the pupils of primary 4 to primary 
 7 to find out if their mums and dads  
 worked and what their jobs were. We   
 found out that most people were       
 employed and that only a few were     
 unemployed. We also found out that the
 most common job was being a shop      
 assistant. One of the questions was   
 who is your employer and most peoples 
 employer was Tayside Regional Council 
 and Tayside Health Board.We found out 
 that 75% of the people worked in      
 Brechin and that 25% did not work in  
 Brechin.We found that most people     
 walk or travel by car to their work   
 and others went by van,helicopter,    
 company vehicle and cycle.About 90%   
 enjoyed their work and 10% did not    
 enjoy it because of unsocial hours    
 and not interesting enough.
