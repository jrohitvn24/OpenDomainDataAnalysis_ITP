		<title>18Milnathort Playgroup</title>
		<content> Milnathort Playgroup meets in the town
 hall.  Young children from Milnathort 
 used to attend Kinross Playgroup, but 
 the idea of a nearer group became     
 attractive to{Milnathort and Orwell   
 parents.                              
 After investigating several possible  
 locations for a playgroup,including   
 the school,{Milnathort Town Hall}was  
 chosen. The hall now has guards round 
 the radiators, and a door handle high 
 up out of the reach of young children,
 among other safety measures taken.    
{Tayside Regional Council}was then able
 to give some financial help to start  
 the playgroup.                        
 The parents hold fund-raising events, 
 which prove to be successful.         
 This year the playgroup donated money 
 to the primary school as a token of   
 thanks for the help and co-operation  
 received since the playgroup started. </content>
