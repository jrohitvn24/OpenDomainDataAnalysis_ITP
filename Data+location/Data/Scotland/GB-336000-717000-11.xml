		<title>11MYRECAIRNIE FARM-HISTORY</title>
		<content>  This farm of 300 acres is owned      
 and run by the Smith family. It was   
 originally part of the large Kilmarron
 Estate, and the Smiths first rented   
 their land in 1939. However, the      
 estate was broken up in 1959 and the  
 Smiths were the first tenants to buy  
 their farm.                           
  It is now run by Mr.Smith and his    
 father,but Mrs.Smith does all the     
 paper-work and this takes up much of  
 her time. They have one son, at       
 present at Castlehill Primary School, 
 Cupar and he shows a keen interest in 
 his father's farm.                    
  The farm has 4 tied cottages, 3 of   
 which are rented out and one is given 
 free to a lady who works in the       
 farmhouse. Only 2 farm workers are    
 employed at Myrecairnie (compared to 8
 in the mid 1940's).
