		<content> -The A75 is the main road linking     
 Northern Ireland with the rest of     
 Britain.Traffic from Southern Ireland 
 also uses it.Juggernauts,lorries and  
 cars cross from Larne to Stranraer and
 Cairnryan.                            
{                                      
{ The stretch of the A75 within this   
{section is straight and fast and      
{within the period from 1979 to 1985   
{there have been fourteen traffic      
{accidents resulting in eight          
{fatalities.}                          
                                       
 The Castle Kennedy Community Council  
 have campaigned for a footpath from   
 the village to the Eynhallow Hotel    
 as this is the part most used by      
 pedestrians. In 1985 it was agreed    
 that a lit footpath was needed and    
 hopefully work will begin on this in  
 the near future.                      </content>
