		<title>17THORNHILL HEALTH</title>
		<content> On the whole,the general health of the
 people is good.Most of the adult      
 diseases are,sadly,related to smoking 
 and drinking.Children have the usual  
 diseases such as measles,mumps and    
 chickenpox although now there is      
 immunisation against a few of         
 these.Not so long ago people died of  
 scarlet fever,diphtheria and          
 tuberculosis but today these have been
  almost eradicated.The nearest        
 hospital is in Stirling.There is no   
 doctor in Thornhill and most people   
 are patients of Dr.Burnett or         
 Dr.McColl in Doune or Dr.Scott in     
 Kippen.Nurse Moore is the district    
 nurse who lives in Thornhill.A visit  
 to the dentist necessitates a journey 
 to Callander or Stirling.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
