		<title>03WESTER MANBEEN FARM</title>
		<content> The cows are home bred.The farm owns a
 black Aberdeen Angus bull and the male
 calves are sold as yearlings.         
 The farm's main crop is grass.This    
 needs a lot of fertiliser and 4.5     
 tonnes of lime are spread on every    
 hectare.The farmer rotates his fields 
 with grass for 2 years and barley for 
 4 years.                              
 The farm uses a great amount of       
 machinery and equipment to increase   
 its production.The farmer has bought a
 combine harvester which cost Â£14,000. 
 There are eleven cottages with        
 excellent working conditions for the  
 workers who appreciate these high     
 standards.                            
 The farm is very well run and is very 
 profitable.
