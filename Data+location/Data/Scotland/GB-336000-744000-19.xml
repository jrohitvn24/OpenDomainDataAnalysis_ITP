		<content>    2)  The upland farms, on poorer    
 ground and with a less equable        
 climate, are mainly family run.  They 
 have more traditional herds of cattle 
 and sheep flocks.  Most of the land is
 managed to provide stock feed -       
 grazing grass, hay, silage, and       
 turnips.  Cash crops of barley and    
 potatoes are also grown.  The living  
 on these farms is more precarious -   
 recent fine summers  have given good  
 crops, but this year has seen the     
 wettest and least sunny summer for    
 thirty years, leading to serious      
 losses of the cereal crop.            
                                       
    The winter climate is such that    
 indoor wintering of cattle is the     
 norm, and winter feed is provided for 
 the sheep.  Lambing ranges from the   
 New Year (indoors) to April.
