 There are sales in February August    
 and October. Buyers come in from      
 the mainland to buy cattle and sheep  
  from local Crofters.The sales are    
 held at Crossapol.There are pens and  
 a shed made for the sales.Lorries     
 transport the animals to the pier and 
 some times there is a special boat    
 to take the animals to Oban.The       
 sales are split between the cattle    
 and the sheep sales. Lambs are sold { 
 at the August sales, so are sheep.    
 There is a dance held on the night    
 of the sales.The next day the         
 crofters spend some of their  money.
