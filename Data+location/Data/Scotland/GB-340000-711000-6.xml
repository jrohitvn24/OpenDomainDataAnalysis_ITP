		<title>06The Provost, Ceres</title>
		<content>  When  a  stone  figure  of  the  last
 person  in  the  Ceres  Provostry, the
 Rev.Thomas Buchanan, was sold in 1933,
 the people of Ceres wanted it back and
 so they recovered it and  placed  'The
 Provost'   in  a  prominent   position
 alongside a carved panel by  the  same
 sculptor, John Howie, showing a  scene
 from the Battle of Bannockburn.       
                                       
  This  edifice  is clearly seen by all
 visitors  and  is considered the heart
 of the village of Ceres.              
                                       
  The  residents  are  proud  of  their
 historical  connections  and  are  not
 keen to have changes which would spoil
 the beauty of the  village  and  break
 their link with Scottish history.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
