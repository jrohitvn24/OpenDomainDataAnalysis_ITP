		<title>01Dunoon On The Firth Of Clyde</title>
		<content> Dunoon situated on the Cowal Peninsula
 of South Argyll forms the largest town
 in the area.   It is normally reached 
 by sea ferry from Gourock and when    
 approached from the sea it is seen to 
 be low lying and situated on a small  
 promontory jutting into the Firth of  
 Clyde.   The town is backed by a range
 of steep tree clad hills.   There are 
 no large industrial or manufacturing  
 concerns in the area and with the     
 exception of some large hotels the    
 majority of the buildings of the town 
 are of one or two stories in height.  
 The main  business of the town is     
 tourism and accordingly much of the   
 work is of a seasonal nature.   At    
 present the town slao serves as a     
 dormitory area for USA navy personnel 
 and their families based at the nearby
 Holy Loch Submarine base.
