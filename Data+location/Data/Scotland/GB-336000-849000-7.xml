 There are many birds seen around      
 Mulderie.  Three are uncommon for this
 area.                                 
 There is the {gold crested wren}the   
 smallest bird in Europe.  He can be   
 recognised by his yellow_orange       
 crown,edged with black.               
 A very different bird is the {        
{capercaillie.}It is very large with a 
 heavy bill and longish neck, broad    
 wings and rounded tail.  In fact, the 
 capercaillie looks like a farmyard    
 turkey.  It makes a great noise and   
 flapping when taking off.  The        
 capercaillie can run very fast.  It   
 feeds on plants, berries and connifer 
 needles.The {buzzard }can also be seen
 here. It feeds on rabbits, young      
 birds, frogs and insects.  The buzzard
 is a good flier.  He can soar and     
 glide. He swoops down on his prey.    </content>
