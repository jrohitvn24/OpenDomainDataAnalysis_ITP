 RECOGNISES THE VALUE OF TREES AND     
 FORESTRY AS A MEANS OF OVERCOMING     
 ENVIRONMENTAL BLIGHT. HOWEVER,        
 FINANCE IS LIMITED AND THE MAIN HELP  
 IN TREE PLANTING PROJECTS COMES FROM  
 THE {CENTRAL SCOTLAND WOODLANDS       
{PROJECT.} THIS WAS SET UP IN 1979 BY  
 THE COUNTRYSIDE COMMISSION FOR        
 SCOTLAND AND COVERS A NO-MAN'S LAND IN
 THE EDGE OF CENTRAL, LOTHIAN AND      
 STRATHCLYDE REGIONS, AN AREA OF BLEAK,
 WINDSWEPT MOORS AND MARGINAL FARMLAND 
 SCARRED BY THE REMAINS OF THE MINING  
 INDUSTRY AND CONTAINING NUMEROUS OLD  
 MINING SETTLEMENTS SUFFERING ECONOMIC 
 AND SOCIAL DECLINE. THE GENERAL AIM OF
 THE PROJECT WAS TO IMPROVE THIS BLEAK 
 ENVIRONMENT BY ENCOURAGING A          
 COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMME OF TREE       
 PLANTING.
