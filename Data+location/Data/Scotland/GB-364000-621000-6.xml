		<content> JEDBURGH. The building, which is of   
 good appearance, is owned by Moffat   
 Weavers. Kilts are made at the rear   
 of the premises. The tartan material  
 starts off in big bales, then it goes 
 to the cutting tables where a man     
 snips the cloth, and a lady puts hems 
 on. The cloth goes through a pleating 
 machine then into a boiler to keep the
 pleat. In another room, forty people  
 turn them into kilts by putting on    
 buckles etc. then they are checked.   
 About 300 are produced each day.      
 In the shop, there are six permanent  
 workers, but in the Summer there      
 are nearly thirty. There is a licensed
 cafe for snacks or hot meals. Besides 
 kilts the shop sells jumpers, skirts  
 and blouses, also perfume. Kilts are  
 exported all over the world.          
 Often up to six buses can be seen     
 disgorging tourists into the premises </content>
