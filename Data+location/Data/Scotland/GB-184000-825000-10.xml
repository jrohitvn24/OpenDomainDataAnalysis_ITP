		<title>10LOCHALSH GIRL GUIDES</title>
		<content> As this is is the 75th birthday of the
 Girl Guide Association there are many 
 celebrations.One of the major ones is 
 the passing of a lighted candle round 
 the whole world.Princess Margaret     
 the president of the Guides lit the   
 first one and the Scottish Chief      
 Commissioner is going round Scotland  
 and on the 25th day of June she was in
 Inverness.The Guides left Kyle at 10am
 and spent the day first at the        
 swimming pool and then the fire       
 station where an emergency arose when 
 they were there.In the evening they   
 went to a park where there were over  
 2000 guides.They marched past with    
 their flags and had a campfire sing   
 song before passing round lighted     
 candles.They set off for home arriving
 back at 22.30.
