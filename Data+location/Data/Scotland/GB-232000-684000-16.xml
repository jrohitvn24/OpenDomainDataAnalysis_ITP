		<title>16Muirland School,Arden 1.</title>
		<content> The old school was built in 1869 by   
 the Laird of Luss. It was used as a   
 school,Sunday school and a church. The
 minister used to put his horse and    
 trap in a shed where the big bale     
 silage is now stored. The school was  
 lit by paraffin lamps which were      
 lowered from the roof.It was heated by
 a stove and an open fire. There is a  
 big bell up in the roof which was used
 by the school and the church. Some    
 children used to walk at least two    
 miles to school. They brought a packed
 lunch and a hot drink of cocoa was    
 provided .During the war there were at
 least sixty children and two teachers 
 in the school.In 1968 there was a     
 terrible storm which blew down the    
 play shed. There was no secretary     
 until 1969. The new building was built
 in 1970.
