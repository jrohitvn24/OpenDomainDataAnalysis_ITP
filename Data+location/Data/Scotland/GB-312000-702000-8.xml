		<title>08Touring in Kinross-shire</title>
		<content>    Although most tourists pass through
 this block or by-pass it on the{M90,} 
 the annual{Kinross Agricultural Show }
 in August offers an interesting day.  
 The ground used for the show is the   
 grass area behind{Kinross House,}the  
 home of Sir David and Lady Montgomery.
 The setting for the show is one of the
 most attractive in Britain.           
    The gardens of Kinross House, which
 contain herbaceous borders, lawns and 
 neatly-trimmed yews, are open to the  
 public in the summer. The house has an
 open aspect towards Castle Island in  
{Loch Leven                            
    The only part of Loch Leven that   
 can be reached easily in this area is 
 at{Burleigh Sands,}which are near a   
 side road from the{A911 }at the north 
 end of Kinross (s.p. Scotlandwell).   
 The site is an attractive one in trees
 with a burn running through it.       </content>
