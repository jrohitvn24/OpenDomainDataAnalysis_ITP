 There are twelve parents and teachers 
 on the committee.  They organise fund 
 raising activities like fetes,        
 barbecues and sales.  With the money  
 they but equipment for us at school   
 like our computer and video recorder. 
 They pay for Santa's expenses at our  
 Christmas party and for our summer    
 outing.                               
{CRAIGIEVAR SCHOOL PLAYGROUP}          
 There are eleven children at          
 playgroup. They begin at three years  
 old. Sometimes the nine toddlers join 
 them for their meetings which are     
 twice a week.  Mothers supervise as   
 they paint, play with water and sand, 
 build with bricks and hear stories.   
 They do handwork too.
