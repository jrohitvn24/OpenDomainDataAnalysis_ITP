		<title>12SCHOOL BUSES</title>
		<content> Mr.Allan owns a{garage}in Cross.      
 He took on the job of running the 4{  
{school buses}in August 1983. There are
 2 red buses and 2 blue buses. Two are{
{Fords}and the other 2 are{British     
{Leyland Sherpas.}The type of fuel they
 use is{petrol.}Only one bus has the   
 same tyres as it had in August 1983,  
 the other 3 have had 7 or 8 new ones  
 between them since then. One of the   
 buses is also used as an{ambulance}and
 a{hearse,}but no other people use the 
 school buses. Each bus holds{12 or 13}
 children - one goes to the North end, 
 one goes to Lady, one goes to the     
 South end and the other one goes to   
 Cross &amp; Burness. Mr.Tulloch drives our
 bus and he has to stop 13 times to let
 people off.
