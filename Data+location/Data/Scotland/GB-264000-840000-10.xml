		<content>    {THE STONE CIRCLE}at Torbreck, near
 Ness Castle dates back to the Bronze  
 Age. It is 5.2m in diameter and has 9 
 standing stones, the largest being    
 2.13m high.The size of the circle is  
 in keeping with the inner space of a  
 Clava cairn where the important rites 
 were enacted.                         
    {KNOCKNAGAEL BOAR STONE}is carved  
 in a Pictish style (5th_8th           
 centuries) with scrolls to emphasise  
 the animal's muscles. These animal    
 symbols are mainly in areas where     
 Columba brought Christianity to the   
 Picts of Scotland.                    
     In 1928, at{CULDUTHEL MAINS FARM} 
 the owner's grandfather found a{BRONZE
{AGE CIST}which is now in an Edinburgh 
 museum.The farmer's wife believes that
 more graves with jewellery could be   
 found between the Boar Stone and      
 Smithton Woods.                       </content>
