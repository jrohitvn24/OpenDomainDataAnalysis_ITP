		<title>01INTRODUCTION - STRANRAER</title>
		<content>  Our Domesday Survey rectangle is     
 located in the{South-West of Scotland 
 in the county of{Wigtownshire.        
   The area includes the town of       
{Stranraer,}which is an important ferry
 crossing point between Scotland and   
 Northern Ireland. Stranraer is the    
 main shopping centre in the district  
 and is the focus of services for      
 outlying villages.                    
   Two-thirds of the survey area is    
 rural land. The farming around        
 Stranraer is mainly dairy, although   
 sheep and arable farming also feature.
 Stranraer boasts the largest creamery 
 of its kind in Europe.                
   There are few other industries in   
 the area which provide employment.    
 Tourism provides a seasonal boost to  
 the area's economy - Stranraer making 
 an ideal base from which to explore   
 the surrounding countryside.          </content>
