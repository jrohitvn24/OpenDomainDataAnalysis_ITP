		<title>06HOME LIFE NEAR SANDHEAD</title>
		<content> by Catherine Wright aged 11           
     The homes of many of the children 
 who attend Sandhead School are a long 
 way away from any other house. At home
 most children help their mothers and  
 fathers with the work around the farm,
 garden, or house; doing such small    
 jobs as feeding calves, pigs or hens, 
 or cutting lawns, weeding flower beds 
 or watering plants, or stacking wood, 
 Hoovering, or baking. Sometimes at    
 night we watch television - when we   
 haven't got homework that is. Most of 
 the secondary pupils at Stranraer     
 Academy DO HAVE homework! Sometimes,  
 when we go to bed, we decide that we  
 are not tired and so we switch on the 
 light and read until we are tired. In 
 the morning, when we get up, we often 
 find that Mum is already downstairs   
 and has dusted the rooms and set the  
 table for our breakfast.              </content>
