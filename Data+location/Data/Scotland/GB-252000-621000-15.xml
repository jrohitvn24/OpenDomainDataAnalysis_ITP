		<title>15CRAIG'S DAY-AUCHINLECK</title>
		<content>   On a typical day I get up at 7.30,  
 have breakfast,read the newspaper then
 watch Breakfast Television. At 8.30 I 
 go and collect my little cousin and   
 take her to Nursery school which is   
 next to Auchinleck Primary. Then I    
 play at football or chasing games with
 my friends until the school starts at 
 9.05.                                 
   In school I work through my lessons 
 of Maths,Language,Social Studies and  
 Art. There is a 15 minute interval at 
 11.05 and one hour lunch break at     
 12.30.When school finishes at 3.20 I  
 go home,do my homework,get changed and
 then go to play with my friend Mark.  
    After playing I go home,watch      
 television,have my supper and go to   
 bed.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
