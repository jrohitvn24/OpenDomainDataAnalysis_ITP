 at school and at home.At school most  
 children play foxy.To play foxy you   
 need one person to be out and as many 
 as you like to be chased.The person   
 who is out shouts out one of the      
 others'names.That person has to get   
 past the person who's out but if he   
 is caught he  has to shout out someone
 else's name and so on until there is  
 one person left.That person has to run
 back and forward three times without  
 getting caught,if he gets past he     
 chooses someone to be out.There are a 
 lot of other games for instance:-     
 skipping,football,elastics,walk the   
 plank or join the crew and five       
 stones.There are always changes in the
 popularity of these games.
