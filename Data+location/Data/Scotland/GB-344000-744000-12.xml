		<title>12Inverarity School Day</title>
		<content> On a school day I am up at half past  
 seven and have had my breakfast and   
 have dressed by eight o'clock.Most of 
 the pupils are at school by ten to    
 nine.At nine o'clock Mr Forbes, the   
 headteacher, blows his whistle  to    
 line us up outside and each class goes
 in.Each teacher asks their class who  
 is going to dinners and who is going  
 to packed lunches.Once this is done we
 begin our lessons.At half past ten    
 there is an interval and we go outside
 for half an hour.When we go in we     
 continue with lessons.At half past    
 twelve we go to the dinner hall for   
 lunch and then we go outside.At       
 quarter to two we get called in and do
 lessons or project work.At half past  
 three we go home by bus.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
