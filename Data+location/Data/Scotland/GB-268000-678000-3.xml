     Politicians are people chosen to  
 make decisions for their community,   
 and also help to run the country.     
 Local decisions are taken by 2 groups-
{The District and Regional Councils.}  
 These are responsible for providing   
 services to the area such as refuse   
 collection,education,water,sewage etc.
   All the main parties are active in  
 the area,but the Labour Party has most
 support,and controls both councils.   
 Kilsyth was once a mining town and    
 this explains the strength of this    
 party.                                
   In our block ,there are also 2 {    
{Community Councils}-Queenzieburn      
 and Kilsyth.These have no statutary   
 powers,but are vehicles for expressing
 local views,and taking local action.
