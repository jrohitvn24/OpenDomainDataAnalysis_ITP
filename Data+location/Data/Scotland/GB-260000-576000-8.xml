		<content> Professionally, New Galloway boasts of
 a successful local artist, a          
 clog-maker, a potter and a sculptor in
 woodwork.                             
  As is typical of many small villages,
 arts and crafts, as hobbies, feature  
 prominently in the villagers' lives.  
 In our survey, the most popular       
 hobbies were knitting, rug-making,    
 sewing, patchwork quilting and        
 tapestry.(Gardening, fishing and golf 
 feature in the outdoor hobbies). 70%  
 of the women in the village, knit.    
  Nine of the ladies intrviewed,       
 actually, attend a sewing class in the
 neighbouring Dalry Secondary School.  
 The majority of ladies have learned   
 all they know from their Mothers and  
 Grandmothers.
