		<title>15Annan Cemetery</title>
		<content>    Annan Cemetery lies aboout 1.5 km. 
 north-west of the town on the road to 
 Brydekirk. The cemetery lies on the   
 high ground to the west of the river. 
 The cemetery was opened in 1866. It is
 divided into four sections. The 'Old  
 Cemetery' contains graves from 1866   
 until 1940. Most of the headstones are
 made from sandstone. The 'New' part is
 from 1940 onwards. Here the material  
 used is mostly black marble.  There is
 a part allocated for the graves of    
 young Air Force pilots from Canada,   
 New Zealand, Australia &amp; the West     
 Indies, who died during the Second    
 World War. The oldest person we could 
 find died when she was 101 years old. 
    Three young pupils from our school 
 who were drowned in the river in 1979 
 are buried here. The total perimeter  
 is 1016 metres. Each plot is 3 metres 
 square and can hold six coffins.      </content>
