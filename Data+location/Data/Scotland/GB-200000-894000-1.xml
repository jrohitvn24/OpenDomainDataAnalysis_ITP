		<title>01SCORAIG PENINSULA WESTEROSS</title>
		<content>    THE SCORAIG PENINSULA IS IN NORTH- 
 WEST SCOTLAND,LYING BETWEEN LOCH BROOM
 AND LITTLE LOCH BROOM.IT IS AN AREA OF
 ROUGH MOORLAND AND ROCKY SEA-SHORE.THE
 CLIMATE IS MILD BECAUSE OF THE GULF   
 STREAM.                               
    A SMALL PART OF THE AREA IS TAKEN  
 UP BY THE CROFTING TOWNSHIPS OF       
 SCORAIG,CARNOCH,RHIREVOCH AND ACHMORE.
 THE CROFTERS KEEP CATTLE,SHEEP,GOATS, 
 PONIES AND POULTRY.THEY HAVE LARGE    
 VEGETABLE GARDENS,BUT THE SMALL AREA  
 OF ARABLE LAND IS USED TO RAISE CROPS 
 FOR THEIR ANIMALS.                    
    THOSE WHO ARE NOT CROFTERS MAKE A  
 LIVING BY FISHING,SMALL INDUSTRY AND  
 CRAFTS.THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE WORKING  
 AS POSTMAN,SCHOOL TEACHER AND CLEANER.
 ALL THE PEOPLE ARE INCOMERS.          
    THERE IS NO ROAD ACCESS TO SCORAIG.
 PEOPLE COME AND GO BY BOAT FROM       
 BADLUARACH OR ON FOOT FROM BADRALLACH.</content>
