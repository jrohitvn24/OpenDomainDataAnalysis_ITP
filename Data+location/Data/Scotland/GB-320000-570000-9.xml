		<content> This area is not a particularly good  
 one for bees. The flora is very       
 restricted because so much of the     
 grassland is manured with artificial  
 fertilisers which kill the clover.    
 Other nectar-producing plants are rare
 in cultivated land because of the use 
 of herbicides. Most of the nectar     
 comes from sycamore in May and        
 willowherb in July/August. I have 18  
 colonies of bees which I keep as a    
 hobby rather than a commercial        
 venture. The fascination of beekeeping
 as a hobby stems partly from the study
 of bees' behaviour and partly from the
 challenge of trying to control        
 creatures which are not domesticated  
 and are more than able to retaliate   
 when they are ill-treated. Honey      
 yields range from about 30lbs per     
 colony, in a good year, to nil in     
 a bad year.                           </content>
