		<content> I live in a semi-detached house with  
 my brother, sister and parents.My     
 sister and I go to primary school and 
 my brother goes to the academy. My    
 mother is a home help, and my father  
 is self-employed as an architect and  
 gets lots of work.                    
 I asked the pupils in my year what    
 their fathers did and found that 26.4%
 are self-employed as car mechanics,   
 hotel and shop owners, electricians,  
 decorators, joiners, farmers and      
 fishermen.                            
 37.5% work for Local Government       
 departments, based in Banff, such as  
 planning, education, roads and        
 environmental health.The remaining    
 36.1% work for other employers or are 
 unemployed.As these results came from 
 a survey of a whole year, they would  
 probably represent the employment     
 situation in this area.               </content>
