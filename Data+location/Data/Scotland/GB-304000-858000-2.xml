		<title>02FORRES EAST TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> The main feature of this block is the 
 A96,which runs through the middle of  
 this block.To the East it passes      
 through Elgin and other towns and ends
 up in Aberdeen.To the West it runs to 
 Inverness and various other           
 towns.Although the railway station    
 isn't in the Eastern area of Forres.It
 is   one of the main features of the  
 town and part of the railway runs     
 through the East of Forres.There are  
 various bus services between Kinloss, 
 Elgin and Forres.  There is also a bus
 service going to and from {Leanchoil  
{Hospital.}                            
   Also coming from the A96 will be a  
 by pass which should be taken round   
 the north side of Forres.  The reason 
 for the by pass is that in summer the 
 centre of the town gets packed with   
 traffic and also because it is very   
 narrow.                               </content>
