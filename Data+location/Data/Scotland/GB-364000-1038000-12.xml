		<title>12TELEPHONE EXCHANGE</title>
		<content> On Sanday we have our own small       
 Telephone Exchange, situated near the 
 school. Here, within the building,    
 each in_coming and out_going call is  
 registered. There are approximately   
{170 telephones}in Sanday. Over the    
 last few years this has been added to 
 by four or five within the year. Now  
 most houses in Sanday have a          
 telephone. The telephones have a 3    
 digit number starting from 200. The   
{telephone}which is{used the most}is   
 the one in the{kiosk}down at          
{Kettletoft}pier. After that, most     
 calls are made from people like the   
 Vet and the Doctor. Up to{8 calls}can 
 be made in Sanday{at any one time.    
 The busiest time they are used is on  
 a Tuesday morning:_ out-going calls   
 for supplies, farm and  shop business.
