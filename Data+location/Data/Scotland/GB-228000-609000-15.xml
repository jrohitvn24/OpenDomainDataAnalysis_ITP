		<content>{MAYBOLE}is the traditional capital of 
 the ancient S.Ayrshire district of    
 Carrick.The name is from two Old      
 English words{Mei_botl}meaning        
 dwelling of the kinswoman.It          
 represents a mid 7thC. Anglian        
 settlement amongst the native Briton  
 and Scots population. The town has    
 connections with king Robert the Bruce
 whose family were Earls of Carrick.In 
 the 16thC. it saw the faction feuds   
 between the numerous branches of the  
 Kennedy family. The S.Ayrshire gentry 
 had their town houses and winter      
 quarters in Maybole of which only the 
 "Castle" built by the Earl of Cassilis
 at the foot of the high street remains
 and the foundations of the town house 
 of the Blairquhan family within the   
 tower of the town hall at its head.
