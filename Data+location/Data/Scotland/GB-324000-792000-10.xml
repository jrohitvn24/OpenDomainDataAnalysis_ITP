		<title>10A Gamekeeper's Life</title>
		<content> My dad gets up at 6.30am.  He gets his
 gun out and cleans it.  Then the      
 soldiers come with a guest.  Dad takes
 the guest up on to the hill and they  
 go stalking. They walk for miles over 
 the hill.  Dad and the guest cannot   
 shoot just any deer. It has to be     
 old or ill and the right type and in  
 the right season.  My dad starts the  
 day by hoping that he will get more   
 than nothing.                         
 In October dad gets Roe deer. In      
 November dad looks for Red deer.      
 My dad walks the same route every day.
 If my dad sees one to shoot but hasn't
 got a chance he waits at that spot    
 next day because he knows it will     
 return.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
