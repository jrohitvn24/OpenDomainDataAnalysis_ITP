		<content> The area we visited was a coniferous  
 plantation surrounding a golf course. 
 Many species of birds use this        
 plantation for nesting, shelter and   
 food supplies. In a short walk we saw 
 no less than ten differrent species,  
 varying in size from Blue-tits to     
 Rooks. In the fields Peewits and      
 Oyster-catchers were nesting among the
 growing crops, while overhead the     
 occasional Curlew was seen. Carrion   
 crows are common as are Kestels       
 hovering over their prey. Round the   
 field-boundaries rabbits and their    
 burrows were observed. Pheasant and   
 Partridge are reared by some          
 landowners for shooting. In the marshy
 areas to the east Mallard and Moorhen 
 ducks were seen. The largest wild     
 animals of the area are Roe deer and  
 foxes are occasionally seen in the    
 morning moving from wood to wood.     </content>
