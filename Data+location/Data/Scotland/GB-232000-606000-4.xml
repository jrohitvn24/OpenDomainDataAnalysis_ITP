		<content> Farms in Crosshill are owner-occupied 
 and worked by the family as are the   
 garage,post office and local hotels. A
 few men are employed by the water     
 board but most of the village work    
 force commutes to Maybole,Ayr and     
 Irvine.Many are tradesmen,some are in 
 a profession,a small number are       
 unemployed.There are a few working    
 mothers.Some are child minders caring 
 for the pre-school children of mothers
 who work in shops or offices.A        
 creamery just outside Kirkmichael     
 closed in 1983 and a lot of people    
 lost their jobs.The building is now a 
 warehouse for toiletries for a chain  
 of chemist shops in Ayrshire,employing
 17 people.The only other local work is
 in the two shops,two pubs and one     
 restaurant.Others commute to          
 Ayr,Maybole,Prestwick,Irvine and one  
 travels as far as Glasgow.            </content>
