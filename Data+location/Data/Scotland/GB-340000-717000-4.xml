		<title>04DAIRSIE PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The old school was built in 1868 and  
 the new school was built in 1970.  At 
 the same time the old school was      
 knocked down.  The new school is very 
 modern.  The school has three         
 classrooms and a library with a wide  
 range of books.  The school has a     
 dining hall and Hall.  We watch T.V.  
 in the dining hall and have drama,    
 P.E. and music in the Hall.  We have  
 huge windows, which are not double    
 glazed.  The walls are brick and each 
 classroom has a fire exit.  The view  
 from our classroom includes nature,   
 farm technology, wildlife, busy       
 traffic and one of the treasures of   
 Dairsie - the Hall.  It was built in  
 memory of the dead of the First World 
 War.       Jonathan Miller.
