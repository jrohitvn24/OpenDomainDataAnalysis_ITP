		<title>18ARCHAEOLOGY IN ESKDALEMUIR</title>
		<content> Eskdalemuir is rich in local history  
 having been occupied at one time by   
 the Romans,and ,earlier still,the     
 Ancient Briton. Excavations carried   
 out prove that what was originally    
 believed to be a hill fort was infact 
 a crematorium or a place for athletic 
 sports and to have been built by the  
 the Ancient Britons.                  
  The oldest archealogical remains in  
 Eskdalemuir are the girdle stones,    
 erected by the Ancient Britons in 1290
 BC.A smaller circle of stones of which
 only two are still standing are called
 the "Louping stones"the old tradition 
 being that the lads used to jump from 
 one to the other - a distance of 8ft. 
 Most probebly they were open temples  
 of the Early Britons.                 
  Eskdalemuir is traversed by several  
 traceable Roman roads or "ways" there 
 are many hill forts and a Roman camp. </content>
