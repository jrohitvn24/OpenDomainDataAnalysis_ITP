 Mr J Grant has worked as a Forest     
 Ranger with the Forestry Commission   
 for the past 35 years. He was brought 
 up in the country and has always had  
 an interest in wildlife.When he was   
 young his family had to catch rabbits 
 as one of their main sources of food  
 and this taught him much of how       
 animals live.He saw the damage foxes  
 and deer can do.His main job now is to
 prevent them damaging the young trees.
 He also has to reduce the number of   
 foxes to prevent them taking too many 
 lambs.His method of control is by     
 shooting.He attempts to keep a balance
 in the population to ensure that there
 is sufficient food available for those
 animals which survive.
