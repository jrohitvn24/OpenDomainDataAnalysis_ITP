		<content>  The village shop and garage have been
 in the family for 18 years.Originally 
 it was a small shop selling cycle and 
 car spares and other odds and ends but
 when the local village shop near by   
 closed down, this shop became the     
 local store.It sells most things apart
 from spirits,beer and drapery. A      
 business has operated on this site for
 70 years.The shop has regular         
 customers for bread milk and groceries
 not only from Stenness but also from  
 the edges of adjoining parishes. Since
 the shop and garage lie on the main   
 road from Kirkwall to Stromness, the  
 shop and particularly the garage pick 
 up a lot of passing trade.The garage  
 is a vehicle testing centre. School   
 transport is also provided by the     
 garage.The shop opens at 7.30am and   
 closes at 9.00pm.On Sunday the opening
 hours are 9.30am-9.00pm. Long hours!  </content>
