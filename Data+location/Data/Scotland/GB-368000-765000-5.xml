		<content>    The General Purpose Room (G.P.     
 Room), which is the biggest room in   
 the school, is used for gym, music,   
 dinner, services and assembly.  This  
 room looks onto the tarmacadam        
 playground at the front of the school 
 where we play rounders and wally.  It 
 is situated along the corridor, past  
 the boys' toilets and is at the       
 opposite end of the school from the   
 two classrooms.  There are six lights 
 hanging from the roof.  At one end    
 there is a large cupboard which stores
 gym equipment, the television set, the
 record player, the video recorder, the
 sewing machine and sewing materials.
