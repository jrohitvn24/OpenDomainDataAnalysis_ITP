		<content> At the entrance to the glen Ben       
 Conchra 453 feet stands on the west of
 Loch Long and Beinn Mheadoin on the   
 east. Both are covered with heather   
 and bracken.  the village of Allt nan 
 sugh clings to the mountainside on the
 west.  It consists of one croft       
 raising sheep only and 8 houses, 3    
 lived in holiday homes and 2          
 semi-derelict.  Most of the village is
 on Attadale Estate, the rest on       
 Conchra land. Through a copse of mixed
 woodland and we have Sallachy with 17 
 houses, 7 of which are holiday homes. 
 There are three crofts with some      
 arable land on which corn, potatoes   
 and grass are grown in rotation.  Two 
 houses take paying guests.  There are 
 also 5 caravans, 4 lived in           
 permanently.
