    On Thursday  I usually get up at   
 7 o'clock. I get washed, dressed, have
 breakfast, clean my teeth and leave   
 for school at 9 o'clock. I walk to    
 school which takes about 10 minutes.  
 School begins at 9.25 am so I play    
 with my friends and then we go in to  
 school. We have an interval at 11.00  
 am which lasts for 20 minutes. After  
 lunch at 12.30 pm we go out to play.  
    I go home at 3.45 pm and then I go 
 to Highland Dancing in Inverness. We  
 do the Sword Dance, Reel and Highland 
 Fling. I have been going to dancing   
 for over a year. When I get home at 6 
 o'clock I have my supper and then I   
 wash the dishes. If it is nice I go   
 out to play with my friend Lucy. If   
 not I watch T.V and go to bed at 10.30
 pm. My favourite programme is         
 'Eastenders.'                         </content>
