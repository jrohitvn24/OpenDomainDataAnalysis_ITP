		<content> In this area the majority of land is  
 farmland.The area which we studied    
 contained six farms.All the farms     
 practiced{arable}farming,growing crops
 such as{barley;both spring and winter,
 some small areas of{wheat and oil_seed
{rape.}Some of the area also had       
 permenant pastureland used for the    
 grazing of cattle for dairying.Fresian
 cows are used for dairying and        
 Hereford cattle were also kept for    
 fattening.                            
 There are areas of rough pastureland  
 and some small woodland areas.These   
 are situated on steep stoney ground.  
  {Fragmentation}has taken place       
 here,the evidence of this is in the   
 farm names and field sizes e.g. North 
 and South Ythsie , Newseat and East   
 Newseat of Tolquhon.In all these farms
 the fields are{large and regular
