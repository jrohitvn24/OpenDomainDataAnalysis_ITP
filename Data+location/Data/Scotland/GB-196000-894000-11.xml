 BIG THINGS ACROSS THE LOCH YOU HAVE TO
 MAKE A CATAMARAN.IT HAS TO BE DURING  
 GOOD WEATHER AND HIGH TIDE OR IT WOULD
 BE DIFFICULT TO DRIVE THE TRACTOR ON  
 AND OFF THE PIER. A CATAMARAN IS MADE 
 BY JOINING TWO BOATS TOGETHER WITH    
 PLANKS ACROSS THEIR HULLS SO THAT YOU 
 CAN DRIVE THE TRACTOR ON.YOU HAVE TO  
 PUT AN ENGINE ON EACH BOAT.BOTH       
 PROVIDE POWER BUT ONLY ONE IS USED FOR
 STEERING.                             
   ONCE A STONE CRUSHER WAS BROUGHT    
 ACROSS THE LOCH.HUGE BUOYS WERE       
 BORROWED FROM THE NAVY AND ATTACHED TO
 IT SO THAT IT DID NOT SINK. THEN IT   
 WAS TOWED BY EIGHT BOATS POWERED BY   
 OUTBOARD ENGINES.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
