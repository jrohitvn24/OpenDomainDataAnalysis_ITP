		<title>14Izatt Avenue,Pitreavie</title>
		<content> Izatt Avenue Estate is a housing area 
 with over two hundred houses. It      
 stretches between the railway line and
 Queensferry Road, where there is St.  
 Leonard's School,attended by some of  
 the children, and Dunfermline High    
 School. Other Primary school children 
 have to cross the dual carriageway to 
 attend Pitreavie Primary School.      
 The local ambulance depot and the West
 Fife Maternity Hospital and Clinic are
 also sited there.                     
 There is only one shop, a newsagent &amp; 
 grocery shop/ Now that the High School
 is a Community School, people in this 
 area can join in many sports          
 activities, swimming, skiing practice 
 &amp; tennis as well as evening classes.  
 As the Fine Fare Supermarket is just  
 across the main road, the shopping    
 facilities are good.  Derek Stevenson.
