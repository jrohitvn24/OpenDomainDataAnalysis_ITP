		<title>16Visit to the Cinema in EK</title>
		<content>  The cinema in East Kilbride is part  
 of the Town Centre complex and is     
 therefore very handy to reach by bus, 
 while the many car parks mean there   
 are no problems for those who travel  
 by car. Being in a New Town it is a   
 fairly modern building and like many  
 other local cinemas it has been con-  
 verted from one large theatre to two  
 smaller ones. In general, the films   
 which it shows come to East Kilbride  
 about 2-4 weeks after their release in
 a city like Glasgow but despite this  
 there were still queues to see the    
 film{The Gremlins}on the day that I   
 went. (This queuing is again becoming 
 more common in recent times after a   
 period when no queues were ever seen).
  I liked the film but when I counted  
 how much I had spent I found that with
 a Â£1.20 admission and some sweets that
 I bought inside it was quite expensive</content>
