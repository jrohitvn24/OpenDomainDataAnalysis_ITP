 When I was at school,if the teacher   
 punished me for doing wrong,I would   
 receive no sympathy from my           
 parents because they considered I must
 have deserved it.                     
 The only time I was given the strap   
 was when I had no wool for knitting   
 because my father couldn't afford it. 
 We used slates and slate pencils and  
 took them home on Friday nights to    
 scrub them ready for Monday morning.  
 We had to buy our tuppenny(2d.)jotters
 and pencils.                          
 The children from Rhu and Ardmair,    
 walked to school and at lunchtime     
 could buy a 1/2d. bowl of barley soup,
 made in a shed beside the school.     
 The'Whipper-in'(Attendance Officer)   
 visited homes of absentees,threatening
 them with doses of castor oil.        </content>
