		<content>   East Balhalgardy is situated about  
 2 kilometres to the north of          
 Inverurie.  Its name means "Place of  
 the Priests" as long ago a hospice run
 by priests was to be found there.  The
 farm is a commercial farm of 540      
 acres.  The farmer Mr Maitland has 275
 cattle which are pure Aberdeen Angus. 
 He has Aberdeen Angus calves sent up  
 from Somerset.  When they have been   
 fattened he sells them to MacIntosh's 
 slaughterhouse in Inverurie or to the 
 slaughterhouse in Banff.  Mr Maitland 
 also has one stock bull, but uses     
 mostly artificial insemination when   
 breeding from his own herd.  There are
 also 70 sheep at East Balhalgardy.    
   The crops grown on Balhalgardy      
 include oats, turnips, peas, oil seed 
 rape, barley and wheat.  Most of the  
 turnips are used as winter fodder for 
 the cattle, the rest is sold.         </content>
