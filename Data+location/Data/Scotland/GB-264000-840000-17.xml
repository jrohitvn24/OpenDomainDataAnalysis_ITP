		<content>    There are two private housing      
 estates built on the outskirts of     
 Inverness,in our square.They are      
 called{LOCHARDIL}and{HOLM MAINS.}Most 
 of the houses in Lochardil were built 
 in the 50's to 70's and Holm Mains    
 from 70's right up till today.We saw  
 houses being built when we visited the
 area.Each lot of new houses extends   
 beyond the existing town boundary.    
                                       
    We saw many lovely houses but not  
 many shops, only one sub_post office  
 grocery store for each estate.        
 Lochardil also had a hotel. There was 
 a swing park at Holm Mains and a      
 rather neglected park at Lochardil.   
 There is also a Community Hall and    
 Scout Hut at Lochardil
