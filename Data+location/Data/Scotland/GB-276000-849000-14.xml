		<title>14INTERVIEW WITH THE POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> Crime is known to many people all over
 the world especially hard working     
 policemen.I interviewed one of those  
 policemen and found out many things   
 such as that the most common crime in 
 Britain today is theft.People commit  
 crimes such as theft and murder       
 because there is nothing to do ,greed,
 boredom, something they want which    
 they can't afford,or just plain       
 badness.Some policemen or policewomen 
 stay in the force for more than ten   
 years and some may only stay for a few
 months.Many teenagers call the police 
 names for they despise them.Road      
 accidents are not nice to hear about  
 or to see for many people are killed  
 or severely injured and most of the   
 accidents are caused by drunken       
 drivers or careless driving.
