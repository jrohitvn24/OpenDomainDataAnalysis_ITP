		<title>01The Hills North Of Largs</title>
		<content> This area is mainly made up of the    
 Noddleburn flowing from north to south
 bounded by high moorland to the east  
 and lower, rolling hills to the west, 
 with a gentle slope down to the sea   
 beyond that.   This slope has a few   
 farms on it, mostly cattle farming    
 with some silage and root crops.   The
 sheep farming, which is the main      
 industry with a little forestry work  
 near the valley bottom.   A tarmaced  
 road links the farms along the valley 
 and continues on to Greenock to the   
 north.   It also gives access to the  
 water that seves the reservoir, which 
 interupts the course of the           
 Noddleburn, near the northern edge of 
 the area.
