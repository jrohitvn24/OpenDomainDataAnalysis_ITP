		<title>12ABERLADY - The Gardens</title>
		<content> Connected with the Carmellite Priory  
 in Luffness, but at a suitable        
 distance off, was a nunnery, the      
 walled garden of which is situated at 
 the extreme east end of the village,  
 down the little hill known as Smiddy  
 Brae where, until just after the      
 1939-45 war, the village blacksmith's 
 forge was in operation.  In this      
 nunnery garden thirteen modern houses 
 were erected some seven years ago, in 
 an exclusive development.             
 In the retaining north wall are still 
 to be seen the apertures or "skeps"   
 for the beehives, from which the nuns 
 obtained the wax for making and       
 selling candles.                      
 Aberlady and its vicinity is a        
 scheduled Conservation Area and as    
 such housing and other development is 
 strictly controlled, which makes the  
 Gardens development rather special.   </content>
