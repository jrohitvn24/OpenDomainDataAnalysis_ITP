		<content> The potato Stores have been in use    
 for 40 years,the average age of a     
 worker is 30 years old.The most common
 potato they grow is the {MARIS PIPER. 
 The store was built specially for the 
 potatoes.The average weight of the    
 potatoes that they bring in a day in  
 the season is 120 tons. The people    
 that work there are 10 on a normal    
 working day and 90 on a working       
 season.We asked three men how long    
 they have been working there,one of   
 them said 5yrs the other 6yrs and the 
 other 18yrs.Before the potato  stores 
 there was just one shed,the shed there
 was used as a stable.
