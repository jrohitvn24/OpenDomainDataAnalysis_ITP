   {Brechin}is a country town of 7,674 
 inhabitants. It stands on the{River   
{Southesk}at the centre of an          
 agricultural community.The farms in   
 the area grow mixed crops with the    
 yellow fields of oil seed rape being a
 feature of the early summer .         
    The main feature of the town is    
 the 12th-century{cathedral}which made 
 Brechin a city and was partly         
 demolished in 1807.Some of the        
 original fabric is preserved, however 
 including a spire dating from 1360.   
 Next to it stands an even older       
 structure an 87 foot high{round       
{tower}built in the 10th or 11th       
 century as a watchtower and place of  
 safety for the priest and church      
 treasures.It was here that the        
 cathedral city of Brechin began.      </content>
