		<content> In the village some people find work  
 at the{jute mill.}It has a night shift
 and a day shift. There are 3 lorries  
 that bring about 124-140 bales of raw 
 jute each day. The jute costs         
 Â£600-Â£800 a tonne. At the jute mill   
 there are over 80 people working. The 
 mill gets most workers from Gourdon,  
 Bervie and Johnshaven. The jute mill  
 is very dusty, dirty and very noisy so
 you have to wear things in your ears  
 called pops to protect your ears from 
 being deafened by the noise. All the  
 jute at the mill comes from           
{Bangladesh.}The jute gets spun into 2 
 ply and 3 ply. 2 ply is two pieces of 
 jute twisted together and 3 ply is    
 three pieces twisted together. After  
 everything is done to the jute it gets
 put into boxes and sent to Dundee.
