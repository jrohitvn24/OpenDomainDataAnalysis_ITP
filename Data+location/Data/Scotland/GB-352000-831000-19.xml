		<content> Although the very distinct north-east 
 language (the Doric as it was called) 
 has largely died out, a certain amount
 of modified Doric is still spoken,    
 especially among the older generation.
 Now the language tends to be more of a
 compromise with Scottish idiom spoken 
 using English words &amp; given Scottish  
 endings. Several of the older Scottish
 words survive, especially where there 
 is no exact English equivalent. Some  
 of these words had their origans in   
 the time of Mary Queen of Scots and   
 are influenced by the Auld Alliance:  
 eg  ashet (assiette) - a large oval   
 meat dish; and rooser (rosier) - a    
 watering can. Other words specifically
 used with traditional methods of work 
 survive, eg graipe - a wide shorter   
 -handled farm fork used for digging.  
 Besom -a heather tufted broom now seen
 only as a fire-beater in the forest.  </content>
