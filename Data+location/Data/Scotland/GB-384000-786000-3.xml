		<content>  A typical Scottish industry in the   
 survey area is{Glenury Distillery}    
 which makes malt whisky. In May 1985  
 production was stopped because of a   
 recession in the whisky industry      
 although it could be ro_opened in a   
 few years time if the recession       
 improves.                             
 The distillery was first started in   
 1824 by a Captain Barclay of Ury to   
 provide a market for barley in an     
 agricultural depression.              
 It was bought by Distillers Company   
 Limited in 1953 and is operated by the
 subsidiary company Scottish Malt      
 Distillers (SMD).                     
 Glenury stands on a site of about 1   
 hectare with 5.5 hectares of farm land
 owned by SMD and let to tenants.      
 At the beginning of 1985 there was a  
 total workforce of 17.
