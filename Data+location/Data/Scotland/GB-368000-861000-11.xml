		<title>11The River Deveron</title>
		<content>                                       
   The River Deveron separates the two 
 completely different towns of Banff   
 and Macduff. The River Deveron is a   
 very private river as it is a good    
 place to fish for salmon. The Bridge  
 of Alvah, a secluded fishing area,    
 lies 3.5km upstream. Flowing          
 downwards, on the Macduff side of the 
 Bridge, there are a lot of deciduous  
 trees, but as the river meanders along
 it passes a few conifers. On the Banff
 side of the river there are fewer     
 trees but much more farmland.         
   The river winds along, causing      
 erosion on its way. As it winds its   
 way to an end it passes by a golf     
 course, and Duff House, and just      
 before the estuary it goes under Banff
 Bridge.In the estuary there is the    
 keel of a fishing boat which was      
 bombed there during World War II.     </content>
