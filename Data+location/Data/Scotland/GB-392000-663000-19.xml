		<title>19EYEMOUTH HARBOUR</title>
		<content> Eyemouth has had a harbour since the  
 12th C.It lies at the mouth of the    
 River Eye and is well sheltered from  
 sea storms by a natural bay.The       
 entrance is very narrow and is known  
 locally by the fishermen as the       
 "canyon".Today the harbour has some 60
 seine-net fishing boats,20 smaller    
 boats fishing mainly for crabs and    
 lobsters and some 10 pleasure craft   
 and yachts.On one side of the harbour 
 is an all weather fish market where   
 daily are auctioned boxes of          
 cod,haddock and whiting.Around the    
 harbour are a variety of services for 
 the repair of the boats, their engines
 and electronic equipment.Occasionally 
 the harbour has to be dredged of the  
 sand and mud brought down by the River
 Eye.
