		<title>01Girvan Valley at Kilkerran</title>
		<content> This area is part of the Girvan       
 Valley. It is also part of Kilkerran  
 Estate. Tenant farmers occupy most of 
 the farms.                            
 The River Girvan flows from the north 
 east corner to the south west. Gentle 
 hills slope down towards the river on 
 both sides. A railway and road run    
 almost parallel with the river. The   
 land beside the river on the north    
 side is made up of small hedge bound  
 fields mainly used for grazing sheep  
 and cattle. Further up the slope of   
 the hill conifers have been planted   
 and beyond that the area opens out to 
 moorland.                             
 The area south of the river is more   
 cultivated. Barley, hay and turnips   
 being grown . A number of well        
 established hard wood trees are in    
 this area.                            
                                       </content>
