		<title>12The Clink, Auchtermuchty</title>
		<content>   The farm is owned by{Mr. and Mrs.   
{Swan }who do most of the work         
 themselves with extra help at busy    
 times. Mr. Swan started farming the   
{Clink}in 1969. Much of the land       
 around was owned by his grandparents  
 and he himself always wanted to farm. 
 The farm extends to{109 acres}and the 
 soil is heavy to medium loam with rock
 near the surface.                     
   The livestock consists of approx.   
{150 free range hens.}The hens eat     
 homegrown grain and concentrates. The 
 graded eggs are sold locally. A horse 
 grazing keeps the grass short to      
 prevent the hens hiding their eggs.   
   He has{30_40 cattle in Summer and up
{to 80 in Winter.}He grows grass for   
 silage and hay. He also grows{barley, 
{potatoes and oats.}Mr. Swan thinks    
 that in{1733}the farm was owned by a  
 man called{Klink}which became{Clink.  </content>
