		<content> Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool was opened in 
 1971. The leisure centre was added    
 later. The pool is thirty three and a 
 third meters long. At the shallow end 
 it is one meter deep and the diving   
 area is three meters deep. Kirkcaldy  
 pool has one spring board at one meter
 and two diving boards at three meters 
 and five meters. The pool was         
 originally heated by coal, but was    
 changed to gas in 1983. It takes      
 220,000 gallons of water to fill it.  
 The average weekly cost of running the
 complex is Â£6,500. On average about   
 1,000 people use the pool every week, 
 including various clubs, e.g. scuba   
 diving, canoe, diving and swimming    
 clubs. In the leisure centre there is 
 a sauna suite, a fitness room, four   
 sunbeds and a cafe. Thirty people are 
 employed in the whole complex. Future 
 plans include running a creche.       </content>
