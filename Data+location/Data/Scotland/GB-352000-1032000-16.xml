		<title>16HYDRO-ELECTRICITY ON EDAY</title>
		<content>    It was only five yearts ago that   
 mains electricity came to Eday. Before
 that time most people had their own   
 generators to make enough electricity 
 for their own use. This was a very    
 expensive way of producing            
 electricity.                          
    The coming of the Hydro has been a 
 great help to many people on Eday.    
 Farmers can have lights in their barns
 and they can shear sheep more easily. 
 In our school we have                 
 T.V.s,computers,a phot-copier, and a  
 video player. If we did not have mains
 electricity all these things would not
 work.                                 
    Mains electricity coming to Eday   
 was a great joy to the people. There  
 is a small sub-station on the West    
 Side of the island and the power      
 cables leave Eday at Fersness Bay and 
 go underwater to Westray.             </content>
