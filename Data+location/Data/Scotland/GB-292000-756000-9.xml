		<content>   Whisky manufacture provides the only
 secondary industry existing in the    
 Pitlochry area .                      
   To make whisky you need water,yeast 
 and malted barley . The water comes   
 from the  mountain Ben_y_Vrackie      
 which is 2,750ft high.All they do to  
 the water is filter it.Forty two      
 thousand gallons of hot water and     
 eight point six tons of malted barley 
 are put in the mash tun.After the     
 distillation process the whisky is put
 in oak sherry casks for a minimum of  
 three years. My dad thinks it's good. 
    The distillery employs 25 people.  
 They have had to cut production but   
 not jobs.There is also the Edradour   
 distillery, star of the BBC programme 
 King's Royal, quite old fashioned     
 in outward appearance, but with some  
 newly built gift shops. They hope to  
 become part of the Whisky Trail chain.</content>
