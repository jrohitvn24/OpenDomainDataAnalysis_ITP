 Blantyre was a 19th century explorer  
 and missionary. He is famous for his  
 discovery of the{Victoria Falls}and   
 his work against slavery.             
 The David Livingstone Centre, situated
 on the banks of the Clyde and in the  
 care of a private trust is{Blantyre's 
 greatest tourist attraction with      
 20,000 visitors a year and is         
 extremely popular with school parties.
 There is easy access by road or rail. 
 The main part of the centre is the    
 building in which{Livingstone}was     
 born, a room of which has been        
 fashioned to look as it would in      
 Livingstone's day.  The Shuttlerow    
 museum comprises displays of local    
 life and industry and the Africa      
 Pavilion furnished by the Commonwealth
 Institute gives an insight into life  
 in Africa today.                      </content>
