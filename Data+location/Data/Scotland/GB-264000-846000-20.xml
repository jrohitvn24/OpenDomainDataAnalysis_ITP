		<content> Mrs.Gow has lived in her house for 81 
 years.It was built in 1789.Once it    
 held 4 families who shared a toilet   
 down the garden.That was common when  
 Mrs.Gow was young.People had a lot of 
 trouble with illnesses,especially T.B.
 The children round Grant Street could 
 play"beddies"in the street and people 
 could stand and talk.Seafaring men    
 lived in Jamaica St.,India St.and     
 Madras St.There were masons,joiners   
 and shipbuilders.Now the shipyard is  
 closed and the slipway is for sale.The
 old houses were bulldozed.The new     
 council houses are nice with small    
 porches and neat windows.Some are     
 Sheltered Houses.You can still buy    
 anything in Grant St._furniture,shoes,
 meat or medicine.Everyone's healthier.
 People don't have to work so hard.Mrs 
 Gow likes watching the men building   
 the Friars Bridge.                    </content>
