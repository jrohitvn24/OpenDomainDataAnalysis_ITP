{Dairy Cattle-}Five of the farms have  
 dairies including one noted Friesian  
 herd at Rosehill and a noted Ayrshire 
 herd at Muirside. On average 80% are  
 black and white and 20% Ayrshire. 1985
 sees the presence of Holstein making a
 mark. One dairyman now milks up to 180
 cows in the parlour system and no     
 cattle are tied by the neck. Milk is  
 sent mainly to the Carnation Milk     
 Factory or is for local distribution  
{Beef Cattle-}These mainly consist of  
 dairy crosses, Herefords and Charolais
{Sheep-}The various breeds are Suffolk,
 Border Leicester, Half-breds, Mules,  
 Charolais sheep and Texel.            
{Changes-}There are no pigs, no ducks  
 and no commercial hens in the area    
 though until recently there were      
 piggeries-the last going about 1980.  </content>
