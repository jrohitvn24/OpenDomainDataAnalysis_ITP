		<content> In contrast to the larger farming     
 units in our area, one farm is still  
 run on very traditional lines. It is a
 unit of only 190 acres and is labour  
 intensive, employing 4 men full time, 
 and up to 20 during busy seasons.     
 Vegetables - onions, leeks, cabbages, 
 cauliflowers, calabrese and turnips - 
 are grown for local and distant       
 markets. In common with the other     
 farms in the area, this farm also buys
 in cattle from the upland farms in the
 autumn for fattening overwinter       
 indoors, and, to some extent, on the  
 fallow fields the following spring.   
 Unlike the others, however, this farm 
 runs about 100 head of sheep, mainly  
 for their lambs, but also for their   
 fleeces, which are still clipped with 
 hand shears on the farm itself.
