		<title>08PAPER MILL AT CHIRNSIDE</title>
		<content> There has been a paper mill at        
 Chirnside Bridge since the 18th       
 century. C H Dexter Limited, the      
 current owners, have manufactured     
 paper here since 1971. The River      
 Whiteadder provides a reliable water  
 supply. Other materials needed are    
 imported from all over the world. They
 employ 14 women and 194 men with an   
 average weekly take-home pay of Â£123. 
 The work force includes skilled,      
 unskilled and highly specialised      
 workers from the surrounding area. The
 variety of products manufactured      
 consists of teabags, meat casings,    
 vacuum cleaner bags, surgical masks,  
 drapes and gowns. Their latest product
 is plugwrap - filters for  cigarettes.
 These products are used by some       
 British companies and are also        
 exported.
