		<content>   In 1851 the population of the       
 parishes of Penpont and Thornhill was 
 3863. By 1971 this had fallen to 2453.
 Factors contributing to this are:-    
  1)Fewer farm labourers have been     
 required as machinery has been        
 introduced and farms have specialised 
 more in pastoral rather than arable   
 production.                           
  2)Fewer farmers now work the land as 
 farms have been amalgamated into      
 larger units.                         
  3)Fewer craftsmen find employment in 
 the villages with the tendancy to use 
 mass produced imported articles.      
  4)Many shops, trades, schools and    
 churches have closed causing more     
 unemployment.                         
   The falling birth rate will cause   
 further population loss, The local    
 school's roll of 426 will fall to 344 
 by 1991.                              </content>
