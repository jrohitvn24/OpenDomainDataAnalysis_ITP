		<content> MANY PEOPLE IN BURRA KNIT FOR MONEY.  
  NEARLY EVERY WEEK OR TWO THE KNITTERS
 MAKE ON AVERAGE TEN SWEATERS.SOME     
 PEOPLE ALSO MAKE SCARVES,GLOVES,SOCKS 
 ETC.MOST PEOPLE DONT HAVE TO MAKE A   
 WHOLE SWEATER.JUST THE BODY,ARMS AND  
 RIBS NOT THE YOKES AND GET OTHER      
 PEOPLE TO SEW IN THREADS.YOU DONT GET 
 VERY MUCH MONEY FOR MAKING THE        
 SWEATERS IT USUALLY DEPENDS ON HOW    
 COMPLICATED THE SWEATER IS.MAKING     
 SWEATERS PROBABLY COULDNT KEEP A      
 FAMILY GOING.                         
   15.2% OF THE POPULATION SURVEYED    
 WERE STILL EMPLOYED IN THE KNITTING   
 INDUSTRY.IN 1985 WHICH REPRESENTS     
 QUITE A DRASTIC DECLINE OF KNITTERS IN
 BURRA IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.MOST   
 WOMEN STILL KNIT FOR THEIR FAMILY AND 
 NOT FOR PROFIT.SOME PEOPLE CAN MAKE UP
 SOME NICE PATTERNS OUT OF THEIR HEADS 
 WITH NO PATTERN TO FOLLOW.            </content>
