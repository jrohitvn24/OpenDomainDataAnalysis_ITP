		<title>06SALMON NETTING, BONAR</title>
		<content>{Salmon Netting}in the{Kyle}was started
 about a 100 years ago . There are     
 local men working at the netting. The 
 fishers  start their netting at the   
 ebb tide. They  have  eight boats     
 called{cobbles.}They use the boats to 
 put the nets out on. The nets are     
 pulled in using a winch. The biggest  
 salmon they have caught weighed{forty 
{two and a half pounds.}The largest    
 catch they have had was{41 fish.}Once 
 they caught a seal in the net. They   
 usually catch between{5000}and{6000   
 fish a year. The salmon are sent to   
 the markets in London. If they have   
 holes in the nets they mend them with 
  a needle  and  twine. The netting    
 season begins in May and ends in      
 October.
