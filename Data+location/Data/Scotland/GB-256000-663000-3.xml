		<content> CARS ARE A POPULAR FORM OF TRANSPORT. 
 THOSE WHO DONT HAVE A CAR EITHER WALK 
 TO THEIR DESTINATION OR TAKE THE BUS. 
 THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF BUSES TO     
 CHOOSE FROM.THE ELECTRIC TRAIN IS A   
 POPULAR ALTERNATIVE WHICH HAS MANY    
 CONNECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE AREA.      
 A NEW MOTORWAY HAS BEEN BUILT WHICH   
 CUTS THROUGH THE CITY CENTRE TO CATER 
 FOR THE RAPID INCREASE IN THE         
 NUMBER OF CARS.                       
 THE UNDERGROUND SYSTEM RUNS ON A      
 CIRCULAR TRACK,CARRYING PASSENGERS    
 BETWEEN THE SOUTH OF THE RIVER AND THE
 NORTH.THIS WAS RECENTLY MODERNISED    
 WITH NEW ROLLING STOCK AND AN UPRATING
 OF THE STATIONS.RIVER TRANSPORT IS    
 VIRTUALLY NON EXISTENT SINCE THE      
 FERRIES WERE RECENTLY SCRAPPED.
