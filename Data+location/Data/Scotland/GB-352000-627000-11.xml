		<title>11KIPPILAW HOUSE</title>
		<content>{Kippilaw House}is a large composite   
 house with 20-25 rooms, a substantial 
 listed building. The land once        
 belonged to the monks. Records can be 
 traced back to 1795. One feature of   
 special interest is the fine Regency  
 mantlepiece of pine with stucco       
 enrichment.                           
{It is}far too big for comfortable     
 living today, one problem being the   
 lack of staff.                        
 There are five cottages on the estate 
 formerly occupied by gardeners and    
 chauffeurs etc. Now a flat in the     
 mansion and a cottage are both empty. 
 One cottage is owned and occupied by a
 retired teacher, another by a college 
 lecturer and another by a mason. {    
{Race Horse Breeding.}The present owner
 devotes much of her time to breeding  
 horses very successfully. She does not
 train horses.                         </content>
