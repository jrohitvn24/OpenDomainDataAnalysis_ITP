		<content> The center and east of block are      
 covered by Moorland mainly grass with 
 small areas of Heather grazed by      
 blackfaced sheep. The surrounding area
 consists of farmland of a pastoral    
 nature.  Some rough grazing and       
 intensively managed grass combined    
 with a small acreage of grain which I 
 used for stock feeding. Beef cattle   
 are also seen on lower ground. Highest
 point is 240m at extreme south east   
 but is nowhere lower than about 200m. 
 The North west corner is bisected for 
 2 kms by the B6456 which is the only  
 classified road. Population is sparse 
 and is engaged totally in agriculture.
 The only trees are planted as shelter 
 belts in various parts.
