		<content> There is evidence in most of the      
 houses that local limestone as well as
 granite and sandstone provided the    
 building materials.During last century
 a number of people were employed in   
 the Limestone quarry on the outskirts 
 of Fordyce or in the adjoining lime-  
 kilns.Quarry Cottages have been con-  
 verted into the Hawthorne Restaurant. 
 There are 58 houses in the village    
 altogether - l7 Council,39 private,the
 Hawthorne Restaurant which opened a   
 year ago and the Castle which has been
 unoccupied since its restoration.     
 Further building is restricted because
 of the area being a conservation      
 village,with many of the private      
 dwellings very old &amp; of great historic
 or architectural interest.There is 1  
 Post Office,l General &amp; Licensed      
 Grocer,l Painter's &amp; l Joiner's Work- 
 shop,annexed to or near owners' houses</content>
