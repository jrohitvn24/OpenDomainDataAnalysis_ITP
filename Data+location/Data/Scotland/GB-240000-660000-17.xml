		<content> Probably due to having nothing much to
 do, many boys in Spateston form pop   
 groups, mostly Punk bands. Walking    
 through Spateston at night, you can   
 hear bands practising from            
 bedrooms.The music blasts out;        
 sometimes good, sometimes bad.        
 Occasionaly a few of the bands get the
 chance to play at the Youth Club to an
 audience of about 150. The most       
 popular at the Youth Club is "First   
 Aid" now renamed "Discharge".         
 Most groups haven't any ideas of      
 making it big in the pop world and    
 making records, though many songs     
 played by the groups could match any  
 records in the charts at the moment.  
 A group who have done well so far are 
 "Question the Peasant". They have had 
 demo tapes made, played a few gigs,   
 and have ben mentioned in local       
 newspapers in small articles.         </content>
