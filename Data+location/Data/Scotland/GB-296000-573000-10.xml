		<title>10Dock Park Dumfries</title>
		<content> The Dock Park is on the south side of 
 the River Nith. It is a place where   
 old people come to relax and where    
 young children can run around in      
 reasonable saftey. When you enter the 
 park there is a cannon to your left   
 and in front is a park keepers  hut   
 in front  of which is a paddling pool,
 a maze, some grass and three benches. 
 The play area includes three swings,  
 one helter skelter a roundabout and a 
 climbing frame and a chute. A memorial
 to HMS Titanic which sank on her      
 maiden  voyage stands near the swings.
 The bandstand provides popular        
 selections  of music in the summer to 
 family audiences and the bowling      
 green, which is very secluded, provide
 pleasure, exercise and an opportunity 
 to meet socialy to the late middle    
 aged and old.
