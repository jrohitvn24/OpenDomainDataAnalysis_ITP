		<title>01Farmland West of Whithorn</title>
		<content> This land is similar in nature to that
 of southern Sorbie.  Many artificially
 enlarged Burn for drainage dykes so   
 enabling the eastern land to be used  
 for growing grain.  The wet western   
 area is characterised by bull rushes, 
 cowslips, mosses and marshy ground;   
 higher area is grazed by cattle, but  
 these animals tend to spend much time 
 with wet legs.  Many wind pumps are   
 seen.  These help drain the land by   
 using blades driven by the wind to    
 operate a pump.  There is a conifer   
 plantation just outside Whithorn but  
 this is too small to be commercially  
 viable.  The low scrub bushes of gorse
 and heather ground, between dense     
 deciduous woodland makes ideal cover  
 for birds and many game birds such as 
 grouse and pheasants are seen         
 scurrying around.  These are fed from 
 metal grain huts &amp; managed by keepers.</content>
