		<content>    Although Cardross has a population 
 of 2000 people, it has no hospital,   
 dentist or doctor. The nearest        
 hospital is in the Vale of Leven,     
 about 6 miles away. 20% of Cardross   
 people attend a doctor in Alexandria, 
 40% in Dumbarton and 40% in           
 Helensburgh. The situation is the same
 for dental treatment. Cardross has no 
 pharmacy and this makes it very       
 difficult for old people and young    
 families to obtain medicine. They have
 to travel to Helensburgh or Dumbarton 
 with their prescriptions. The local   
 Co-op does sell aspirin and cough     
 medicine. Cardross will have to grow  
 bigger before it gets its own doctor. 
 Some people believe that a bigger     
 village would spoil the concept of    
 community life.
