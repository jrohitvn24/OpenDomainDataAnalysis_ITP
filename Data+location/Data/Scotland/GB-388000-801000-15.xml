		<title>15Royal Darroch Hotel 1</title>
		<content> In 1971 cults people objected to the  
 building of a three storey hotel at   
 Craigendarroch house at the corner of 
 North Road and Cults avenue.Eventually
 they came to an agreement and the     
 Royal Darroch was opened in 1972.In   
 1983 on Tuesday 25th October at 8.53am
 all people within at least three miles
 of Cults heard an explosion.At first  
 people did not know what had happened,
 but they eventually found out that the
 Royal Darroch Hotel had exploded.The  
 ground floor had collapsed into the   
 basement and the front of the building
 was blown off as well as the roof.All 
 the glass from the windows was        
 showered everywhere damaging passing  
 vehicles.To make matters worse there  
 was a major fire as well.Within four  
 minutes the first of the fire engines 
 had arrived.                          
                                       </content>
