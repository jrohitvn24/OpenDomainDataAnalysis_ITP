		<title>09DAIRSIE YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content> The Youth Club meets every Wednesday  
 at 7.00 p.m. except school holidays   
 when it is closed.  We have all sorts 
 of activities - some indoors, some    
 outdoors, and we occasionally go on   
 outings with the group.  There are    
 about 20 people that go to the Youth  
 Club.  The Youth Club is run by Amy   
 Hain who is helped by Mrs. Miller who 
 is in charge of the tuck shop where we
 buy sweets, crisps and juice.  In the 
 Youth Club we have a record player and
 Duncan Pentland usually brings records
 to play.  We have competitions every  
 year, and we have different games.    
 The prizes are medals.  We have all   
 sorts of games - board games and ball 
 games, darts etc.  Occasionally we go 
 on three-legged charity walks and     
 sponsored silences and some Wednesdays
 we play rounders at the park.- Fraser 
 Watson, Mark Birnie, Dawn Davidson.   </content>
