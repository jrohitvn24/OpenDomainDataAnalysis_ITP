		<title>13THOUGHTS ON EAST LINTON</title>
		<content>                                       
     I have lived in East Linton for   
 ten years. Here are a few things I    
 like and dislike about it.            
     I like the park because it has got
 very good swings and a good chute.The 
 village is nice because people are    
 friendly and you get to know them     
 well. It is quite peaceful because    
 it is in the country and not too many 
 cars go through. There are a lot of   
 good clubs to go to, like Art club and
 Youth club,Guides, Brownies,Cubs and  
 Cadets. I go to Guides.               
     These are the bad things about the
 village. It hasn't got very good shops
 as there isn't much choice. The sweet 
 shops are all rig though.I think it is
 stupid having to travel to High School
 but I suppose East Linton is a bit    
 small to have a High School.Also, East
 Linton should have a railway station. </content>
