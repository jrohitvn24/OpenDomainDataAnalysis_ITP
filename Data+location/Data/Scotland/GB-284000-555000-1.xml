		<title>01Dalbeattie Forest (South)</title>
		<content> This attractive area is dominated by  
 coniferous forest plantations, with   
 areas of deciduous woodland, rough and
 improved grassland near the two roads.
 The landscape is undulating and       
 hummocky, with bare rock exposed at   
 the surface.  Near Auchensheen there  
 are several small lakes.  The         
 population is small and settlement    
 consists of farms and several hamlets.
 A caravan site and three small hotels 
 cater for the summer tourist trade but
 most visitors merely drive through.   
 The residents lack local amenities,   
 although there is a bus to Dalbeattie 
 on weekdays.
