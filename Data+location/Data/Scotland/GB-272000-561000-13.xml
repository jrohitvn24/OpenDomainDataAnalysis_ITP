		<title>13Boreland Farm</title>
		<content> Mr Neil has been farming for 50 years.
 He has 1,000 acres. There are 7 fields
 of waste ground. He mainly makes      
 silage. He has a lot of farm buildings
 and a big farm house. He has built a  
 big dairy shed for 150 cows.          
 He has 230 dairy cows which are fed on
 silage in winter. They are milked     
 twice a day at 4.30 am and 3.30 pm. He
 has increased the sheep from 250 to   
 600. He feeds them on rough sheep     
 mixture in winter.                    
 There are 7 people working on the     
 farm. They work from 6.00 am to 6.00  
 pm. He thinks the farm could be far   
 more computerised in years to come.
