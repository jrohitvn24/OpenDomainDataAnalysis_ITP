		<title>17SYMBISTER HOUSE</title>
		<content> Symbister House,the largest building  
 on Whalsay, was built in the 1830's   
 for the Bruce family who were lairds  
 (landowners) of Whalsay.              
 One of the best examples of Georgian  
 style architecture in Shetland it is  
 built of granite brought from the     
 Shetland mainland,but at such cost    
 that the Bruce family fortunes were   
 severely reduced. It is said locally  
 that the then head of the family did  
 this deliberately so as to leave      
 little to his son, with whom he was on
 poor relations.                       
  During the 1920's and 30's the last  
 laird had to take in paying guests in 
 order to help pay for the upkeep of   
 the house. After his death the        
 building was unoccupied and became    
 almost derelict.In 1963 the council   
 took it over,repairing it and opening 
 it as a school in 1964.               </content>
