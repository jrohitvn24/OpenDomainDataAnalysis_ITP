		<content> Monoughty Forest was one of the first 
 areas to be planted in Scotland by the
 Forestry Commission. The Commission   
 was set up in 1919 and its very first 
 tree was planted here.Unfortunately it
 was chopped down recently.            
 The forest has 700 hectares of trees  
 and in one hectare 2,500 trees are    
 planted.5,000 tonnes of timber are    
 felled each year.Trees are felled when
 they are about 60 years old.An angle  
 of 45'is cut at one side and at the   
 opposite side they saw inwards towards
 the cut.When they fell downhill they  
 always keep a row of trees along the  
 bottom.2,000 trees are used each year 
 for telegraph poles.A man from British
 Telecom comes and measures out the    
 length of the poles.                  
 Young trees are planted about 1       
 metre apart.
