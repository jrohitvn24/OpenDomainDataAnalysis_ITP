		<title>03THE VILLAGE TODAY</title>
		<content>    As there are 985 people in Letham, 
 there have to be adequate activities  
 to cater for everyone.After a day's   
 work both women and men may like to   
 relax in the Hotel or the Pub situ_   
 ated in the Square where they may play
 darts or pool.The country around us   
 affords many walks and rambles which  
 anyone is free to enjoy.              
  There is a bowling club, a Drama     
 group and in the Village Hall,dances  
 are held regularly.Parents can take   
 their families to the park.From a     
 survey conducted in school the most   
 common family is one girl,one         
 boy_least common has five children.   
  They may live in a bungalow built in 
 the garden of one of the original     
 houses; every available site seems to 
 have been built on in the last few    
 years.                                
                                       </content>
