 Kiltarlity.The hotel was originally   
 called the Fraser Arms but was changed
 by the present owners John and June   
 Forsyth in 1982.The name 'Brockie' is 
 from the Gaelic for badger.Not far    
 from the hotel where the A833         
 joins the old A9 is Brockie's         
 Corner.The badger theme features      
 strongly in the hotel's               
 interior,as does Scottish wildlife    
 generally. The hotel has 8 bedrooms,a 
 restaurant which seats 50,a lounge bar
