		<title>05The Village Bridges</title>
		<content> There are three bridges in the village
 of Kirkfieldbank.The first is known   
 locally as The  Roman Bridge ,        
 although it is not Roman, and was     
 built across the River Mouse in 1649. 
 This was a pack-horse bridge used by  
 travellers going from Lanark to       
 Hamilton.Where there was formerly a   
 ferry for travellers from the east of 
 the country going to the Ayrshire     
 coast ,there is now Clydesholm Bridge 
 built in 1699,across the River        
 Clyde.This bridge is not suitable for 
 modern traffic and has been replaced  
 by a wider bridge a few yards further 
 down the river.This was built in 1953.
 There is also a famous bridge,Cartland
 Bridge across a deep gorge of the     
 River Mouse. This bridge was designed 
 and built by Thomas Telford.
