		<content> Hazlehead Park and Johnston Gardens.  
 There are 2 delightful parks in the   
 area. The smaller, Johnston Gardens,  
 was gifted to the city in 1936, being 
 formerly part of Johnston House estate
 . The gardens are beautifully laid out
 containing streams, waterfalls and    
 pools with winding paths and rustic   
 bridges. The park is popular with the 
 elderly. The area occupied by         
 Hazlehead park was granted to the     
 burgh by Robert the Bruce in 1319 and 
 was developed into the city's largest 
 park in the 1920s. The maze,donated by
 Sir Henry Alexander in 1935,is ringed 
 by extensive gardens including a      
 delightful rose walk. Hazleheads other
 facilities include golf courses, rugby
 and football pitches, a children's zoo
 and adventure playgrounds. The park   
 frquently hosts Highland games,       
 Concerts and Traction Engine Rallies. </content>
