		<title>17TEALING CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church at{KIRKTON OF TEALING}is   
 one of the oldest buildings in the    
 area. The word 'Tealing' is Gaelic for
 'country of brooks or water'. A church
 on this site was first recorded in    
 1174. The present church was built on 
 the same site in 1808 and several     
 inscribed stone slabs dating to       
 Pre-Reformation times were preserved  
 and built into its walls. One of these
 stone plaques is thought to bear the  
 oldest known inscription in old Scots.
 In 1963 the parishes of Tealing,      
 Auchterhouse and Murroes were         
 amalgamated and Tealing Church was    
 closed. However, it is hoped to       
 restore the old church and turn it    
 into a museum under the Church of     
 Scotland Kirk Heritage Fund. Sunday   
 morning services are now held at      
 Auchterhouse (10am) and Murroes       
 (11.30am).                            </content>
