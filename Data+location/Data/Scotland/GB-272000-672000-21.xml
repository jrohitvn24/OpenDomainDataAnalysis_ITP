<title>21cumbernauld of now</title>
<content>I agree of the time cumbernauld was a futuristic town, people coming from the city of glasgow were in awe of the open spaces and pathways and childrens playgrounds, it was a true haven for the older generation and young familes. but what the designers and councils forgot was those children would grow up to teens and young adults with nothing to do but walk those same pathways and sit in those same playgrounds,some became and still become distructive and agressive towards this once haven, it is now a truly different place to see and live in, some original familes still stay here but if you ask they will sure agree this place if far from idealic. The problems still rise and the community galas and events decline, the familes start younger in trouble for much longer,the bordom grows stronger there is no wonder that 25 years from now if nothing changes no plans or proposals then this once haven is forever in the past. &lt;br />&lt;br />Time to herd all the people of cumbernauld to a new haven, a new futuristic town, time to start again.   &lt;br />
