   The most popular food items in      
 Rogart are mince and potatoes, milk   
 and bread. Many people buy convenience
 foods like Heinz beans.               
  In the winter people eat hot meats   
 like sausages, porridge, stew and     
 soup. In the summer, people eat salads
 and cold meals.                       
  Sadly, big stores are replacing      
 smaller shops.                        
  The favourite meal in Rogart is broth
 followed by mince and potatoes. Broth 
 is a soup full of carrots, onions,    
 cabbage, leeks, turnip, barley and any
 other available vegetables. Mince is  
 minced beef braised in a pan with     
 onions and carrots.  Potatoes are     
 boiled; definitely not chipped. This  
 dish is at its best when potatoes and 
 mince are mashed together.
