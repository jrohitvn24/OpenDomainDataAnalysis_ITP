		<content> Throughout the town the sound of      
{Harris Tweed looms}can be heard. The  
 looms are in weaving sheds, often at  
 the back of the house. We interviewed 
{Mr Macrae}who is a weaver. He has been
 weaving for forty-six years and gave  
 us the following imformation.Boban    
 wool is used to weave. Once the weaver
 has finished the tweed it is put to a 
{woollen mill}and he gets a price for  
 it depending on the type of tweed. Mr 
 Macrae works twelve hours a day from  
{8.30am to 8.30pm.}But that is just his
 usual hours; depending on when he     
 works the amount of tweed he makes    
 differs. Weaving is a very expensive  
 business and the hardest part of      
 weaving is the peddling. 75 people    
 weave in Stornoway but that figure    
 will be going up. Tweed has been made 
 for about 100 years. Mr Macrae said   
 that he taught himself to weave.      </content>
