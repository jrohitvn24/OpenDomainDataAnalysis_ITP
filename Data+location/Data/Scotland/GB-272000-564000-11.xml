		<content> Twelve Stewartry darts players will be
 aiming for the record books next month
 in the hope of landing a local 24 hour
 points record. Their target is the    
 800,000 set in May last year by the   
 Victoria Inn, Dumfries, and it is     
 hoped the round the clock marathon    
 will raise Â£1,000 for a hospital unit 
 appeal. The nine men and three women  
 from the Thistle Inn, Crossmichael,   
 five of whom are members of the       
 intercounty team, will play in groups 
 of four with one hour on the board.   
 One of the local darts players is     
 ranked number 11 in Scotland and has  
 played against the famous Jocky       
 Wilson.
