		<title>14Coast - Macduff Castle</title>
		<content> On the cliffs between East Wemyss and 
 Buckhaven stands the ruins of Macduff 
 Castle. Although now in ruins the     
 castle was for many years the seat of 
 government in the Parish of Wemyss.   
 Traditionally, the building is        
 connected with Macduff, Thane of Fife,
 the slayer of the evil Macbeth. (1057 
 AD). Macduff's Castle is undoubtedly  
 one of the oldest maritime fortresses 
 of the great Earls of Fife. The       
 present Castle dates back to the early
 14th Century, however, there was      
 probably a wooden castle on this site 
 as early as the 11th Century.         
 In 1630 the Castle and a large section
 of land was sold to John, the 1st Earl
 of Wemyss. The Castle was in excellent
 repair at this time and the Earl made 
 it his cheif residence. The Castle was
 last known to be inhabited in 1666 but
 could have been lived in after this.  </content>
