		<content> The fishers'thatched cottages of Lower
 Clachnaharry have been restored and   
 slated.Retired people live there      
 mostly,only two of them original      
 inhabitants.Mr.Macdonald,aged 81,lives
 near the older school with the diamond
 paned windows.His father went there   
 only when he could afford a penny and 
 a piece of wood,coal or peat.The High 
 Street School too is closed.The       
 children go to Muirtown School now.The
 Post Office and the railway station   
 have gone,but the pretty iron         
 footbridge has been preserved.There   
 are no High St.shops,only Macleod's   
 caravan sales and the Inn.Next to the 
 Canal Office,Clachnarry House is now a
 boarding house.Only the base of the   
 Battle of Clachnaharry Monument on the
 old Watch Stone remains.Above,the     
 lower slopes of Craig Phadraig are    
 covered with modern bungalows.        </content>
