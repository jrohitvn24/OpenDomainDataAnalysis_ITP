		<title>06HYDRO BOARD,NOSTIE LOCHALSH</title>
		<content> In the Lochalsh area most of the      
 electricity is produced from water.   
 There is a reservoir at the top of the
 hill.The water runs down steel pipes  
 into the power station where it turns 
 a turbine.This turbine drives a       
 generator which produces the          
 electricity.However the power station 
 at Nostie does not produce enough     
 electricity for our area.Electricity  
 at peak periods has to come from      
 stations elsewhere.Although the water 
 is free,electricty charges are just   
 slightly lower than in the rest of    
 Britain because of the hydro station. 
 In winter there are many problems     
 maintaining the over head lines       
 because of the high winds,snow and    
 electrical storms.In these conditions 
 it is difficult to even reach the     
 lines.There are less than 1% of the   
 homes in the area without electricity.</content>
