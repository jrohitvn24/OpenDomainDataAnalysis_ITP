    The Bin is not the highest hill in 
 Cairnie but it is the most prominent  
 feature. There are quite a number of  
 legends attached to it.               
                                       
    A large stone near the top of The  
 Bin is known as Samsons Putting Stone.
 Samson was supposed to have stood on  
 top of The Bin and tossed the stone to
 Goliath of Gath who was standing on   
 Drumdelgie Hill, a mile away.         
                                       
    There is a large cave on top of The
 Bin which is supposed to have been the
 home of witches.  There is supposed to
 be an underground road from this cave 
 to Dunbennan Hill about two miles     
 distant.
