  Potatoes are planted in April. The   
 fields are only used for potatoes once
 in five years.  The crop is sprayed to
 kill the weeds to let it grow.   When 
 the {potatoes }are ready for picking{ 
 they are sprayed to kill the shaws.   
 The farmers get a "tattie squad"(a lot
 of people) and a "tattie digger." This
 digs the drills out and the squad lift
 the potatoes into baskets.  Then they 
 are thrown into a potato box.  Some   
 boxes go to the tattie stores and some
 are used for feeding animals.         
{PEAS}                                 
 peas are grown in one part of ARDOCH  
 because other crops like barley won't 
 grow. Viners cut the peas and a lorry 
 carts them away and a machine sprays  
 them. They are sold as tinned peas.
