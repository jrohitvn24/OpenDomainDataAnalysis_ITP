          Canna is not connected to the
 National Grid. Electricity to each    
 household is supplied by its own or a 
 shared diesel generator. The          
 generators are usually running  for   
 set periods in the evening and in the 
 morning too during the winter. This   
 means that during the day there is no 
 electricity to power refrigerators,   
 washing machines,radios etc. unless a 
 generator is especially required. Even
 when the generators are running there 
 is a limit to the power available,    
 only 3KW in some houses. There are 5  
 generators on Canna with a total      
 maximum output of 49KW. The diesel    
 comes on the ferry from Mallaig.
