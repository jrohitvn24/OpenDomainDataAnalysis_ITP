		<content>{CRIEFF CARRY-ON WEEK}                 
                                       
 This is the name given to the week    
 which marks the start of the tourist  
 season for Crieff. It was the idea of 
 the Crieff Round Table and consists of
 a week full of competitions and events
 of interest to the tourist and local  
 alike.                                
  It starts on a Sunday with a parade  
 of floats through the town which have 
 been built by the different clubs and 
 societies in Crieff, and these are    
 then judged. This year's winners were 
 the Brownies, whose theme  was "MARY  
 MARY QUITE CONTRARY".                 
                                       
  A new event this year was a junior   
 version of  "It's a knock-out" which  
 was won by the boys' team from Crieff 
 Primary School.
