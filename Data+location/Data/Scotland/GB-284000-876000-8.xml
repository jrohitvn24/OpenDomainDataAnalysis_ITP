           THE LOCAL SHOP              
  In our area there is only one shop   
 owned by Mrs J Lees.This shop stocks  
 most of the goods that people need    
 such as food,cigarettes,alcohol and   
 even clothes and toys.                
       The shop has always been busy   
 but recently one of the large chain   
 stores,Fine Fare,has provided a free  
 bus.This bus takes the villagers to   
 Inverness which is about 35 miles from
 Hilton and there they shop in Fine    
 Fare and return home on the stores    
 bus.                                  
     Because of falling trade ,Mrs     
 Lees cannot afford to employ help in  
 the shop or make improvements to it.Sh
 just earns  enough to make a living.  
    However in our village shop you    
 will usually find a cheery shopkeeper 
 who is always helpful.                </content>
