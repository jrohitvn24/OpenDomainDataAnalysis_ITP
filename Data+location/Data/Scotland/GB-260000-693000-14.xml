		<title>14FARMING IN ARNPRIOR</title>
		<content> There are 12 farms in the block, but  
 no information could be obtained on 2 
 of these.  Of the remainder, 4 are    
 operated by owner farmers and 6 by    
 tenants. 1 farmer owns his farm but   
 also rents the adjacent lands. Each   
 farm is typically worked by 3 people  
 including the farmer - usually the    
 others are sons or other relatives.   
 One man, however, farms his 150 acre  
 farm by himself.                      
 The 10 farms comprise of approximately
 950 acres of arable land, 1400 acres  
 of grazing pasture and 170 acres of   
 woodland. The lands at the base of the
 valley have heavy clay soils typical  
 of the Carse of Stirling. Further     
 south the soil is medium loam.
