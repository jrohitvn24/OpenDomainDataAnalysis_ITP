		<title>04Shopping in Kirkcaldy</title>
		<content> In the {Templehall}area of Kirkcaldy  
 there is a small shopping centre with 
 a Sub-Post Office, one general store, 
 five food stores,two take-away food   
 shops and two betting shops.Most of   
 the people wanted a shoe shop.However 
 many people still prefer to go to the 
 High Street because prices are lower  
 and the selection is better.          
 Meanwhile in the huge{Dunnikier Estate
 on the North side off the town there  
 are only two shops.These are a        
 Sub-Post Office and a small super-    
 market.Most people in the estate want 
 a chemist and a bigger supermarket.   
 This lack of facilities makes life    
 very hard for mothers with young      
 families.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
