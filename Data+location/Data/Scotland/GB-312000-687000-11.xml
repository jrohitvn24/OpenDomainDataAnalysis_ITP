		<title>11CROSSGATES AREA THE FUTURE 2</title>
		<content>  As for Halbeath, we think it will    
 eventually join completely to         
 Dunfermline and then become just a    
 part of Dunfermline not, a separate   
 village.                              
  To a large extent those who live in  
 Crossgates and Halbeath do not work   
 there. Many commute to Dunfermline or 
 Rosyth Dockyard. The future of Rosyth 
 Dockyard is a bit uncertain at the    
 moment, with the present Government's 
 policy of privatising state owned     
 industries. This must reflect on the  
 area.                                 
  At this time there is very few new   
 houses in the area but due to the land
 around these villages, we suppose new 
 houses will be built on this land.    
  For all these things, and others not 
 considered, time will only tell.
