		<content> As there is no local {bus service}the 
 people of this area are completely    
 isolated unless they have their own   
 transport. It is at least six miles to
 the nearest town and the nearest      
 country shop is three miles away.     
 There are several vans which do their 
 rounds on certain days, but they offer
 a limited service. Some families have 
 to go to town by Taxi, shop and return
 the same way - this can be a day out  
 for the family, but it is costly.     
                                       
{Leisure.}                             
 Because of the lack of Public         
 Transport most leisure activites are  
 concentrated in the home and the      
 immediate area. There is nothing for  
 young people and the majority spend   
 most of their time watching television
 or reading.                           
                                       </content>
