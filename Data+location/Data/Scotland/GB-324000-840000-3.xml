		<content> In the village of Aberlour, there is a
 mixture of old and new houses. There  
 is also a mixture of private housing  
 and council housing. There are two new
 housing schemes, at Sellar Place and  
 Taylor Court, both named after local  
 people.                               
 The houses are mainly one or two      
 storeys high, the older ones being    
 built of stone. The houses in the     
 village itself are quite close        
 together but the main street is wide  
 so that cars can park on both sides   
 without blocking the traffic.         
 Outside the village, the houses are   
 spaced out along the roads leading in 
 different directions.                 
 In the High Street, some houses are   
 above or next door to shops.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
