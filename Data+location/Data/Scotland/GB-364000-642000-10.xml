		<title>10CLUBS IN GORDON (1985)</title>
		<content> Here is a list of clubs and where they
 are. Football_park ,netball_Gordon    
 school,fitness_school,tennis_park     
 dancing_school,badminton_school,      
 horse riding Nenthorn,bowling_park    
 and Monday club_school.               
 Clubs are run by approved instructors 
 to teach people . Clubs are very      
 useful because your are learning the  
 right way. Here is one of the clubs   
 I like. Dancing is taught by          
 Miss Smith. She is a very good teacher
 because she says every thing clearly. 
 Here is one of the dances we have done
 "A JIG FOR MS DUNN". I feel that there
 should be a  swimming pool in Gordon. 
 There is a dangerous river near by in 
 which a lot of children swim.I think  
 that a swimming pool would be safer.
