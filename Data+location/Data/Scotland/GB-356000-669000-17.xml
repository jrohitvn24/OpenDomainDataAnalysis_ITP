		<title>17Garvald Housing</title>
		<content> There is reference to Garvald in      
 documents of the 12th Century, but the
 olderst houses go back to about 1700. 
 In the 18th C. there were 5 Inns, a   
 brewery, weavers, mason's &amp; many      
 stores. In 1775 a flood swept away    
 most of the cottages. Most of the old 
 pantiled sandstone cottages were built
 between 1780 &amp; 1810, the land being   
 aquired from the Whittingham &amp; Wemyss 
 estates. In the 1930's the old two    
 roomed cottages on the north side of  
 the street were demolished and        
 replaced by the present council       
 houses. Since 1960 the population has 
 steadily increased many of the old    
 cottages being attractively modernised
 A small development of 6 bungalows was
 built where there had been a prisoner 
 of war camp. Only about 10 houses in  
 the area are holiday homes, there used
 to be many more.                      </content>
