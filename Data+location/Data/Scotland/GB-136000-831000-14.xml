		<title>14NEW PORTALOO,CARBOST.</title>
		<content> Because of the demand created by      
 tourism,mainly due to visitors to the 
 distillery,public toilets have been   
 erected in the village near the shores
 of the loch.                          
 It is made up of demountable units,   
 which come in ready made              
 sections,making building very easy and
 quick.Only the foundations and drains 
 needed to be prepared beforehand and  
 the area painted and tidied           
 afterwards.                           
 Because of this speed they have earned
 the nickname of 'Portaloo'.           
 One person in the village has been    
 given the job of looking after the    
 toilets and keeping them clean.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
