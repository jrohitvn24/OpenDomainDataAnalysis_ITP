{OUR WORKING WELL}                     
 ________________                      
 The stately well standing straight and
 dignified,                            
 His impressive black coat and eye     
 catching golden face stand out against
 the school building,                  
 His ears, behind his golden mane,     
 prick up, as piercing shouts echo     
 around the playground.                
 Impatient villagers gather around as  
 the first drop of water for many years
 falls from his spout,                 
 He stands proud in his new site,      
 guarding the building.                
 Pensioners remember their childhood   
 days when they see his long forgotten 
 face,                                 
 Basking in the care and attention     
 which he is now receiving.
