		<title>04GROUSE SHOOTING IN THE BRAES</title>
		<content>   The  'Glorious  Twelfth'  of  August
 sees the opening  of the grouse shoot-
 ing season and the 'bag' at the end of
 each day  reflects  how successful the
 birds have been in  the summer raising
 their young as well as  how  good  the
 shooters are.                         
   Careful  burning  of  the  old  rank
 heather before  the  spring encourages
 new young shoots  on  which the  birds
 thrive. This  ensures  that  there are
 plenty birds to  provide sport for the
 affluent guests who  form an essential
 part  of  the  economy  of  the  area.
 Careful  management is  also needed to
 make  sure  enough  birds  survive  to
 breed the following year.             
   Besides  the  gamekeepers  who   are
 employed  throughout  the year, locals
 and students are needed  to  drive the
 grouse to the butts, or to assist  the
 shooters by loading their guns.       </content>
