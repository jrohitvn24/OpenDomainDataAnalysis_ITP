		<title>07HOSPITAL LIFE - ERSKINE</title>
		<content> On Thursday 14th June six pupils of   
 our class {interviewed}a patient who  
 told us that he had been{a physical   
{training instructor}in the{R.A.F.}Now 
 he is{paralysed}and spends most of his
 time in a{wheelchair.                 
                                       
 On good days he likes to wheel himself
 around the{magnificent grounds}of the 
 hospital estate. In the afternoons he 
 enjoys the{entertainment}in the{Games 
{Room.}Sometimes a singer will come to 
 conduct{community singing;there may be
 a game of{Bingo}or{Darts}or{Cards;}or 
 he may prefer to sit and{chat}with the
 special friends he has made in the    
 hospital.                             
                                       
 The{good food;}the{excellent care and 
{attention}from the staff made him feel
 that he was living in a{first class   
{hotel}and not in a hospital.          </content>
