		<content> A second smiddy more a workshop now   
 stands at the end of the village and  
 across the road is a new eninering    
 workshed which among other things     
 makes containers for oil rigs.  The   
 village hall, built in memory of those
 who died in the first world war stands
 beside the big park and second smiddy.
 On the way to sprinbank Terrace stands
 a house which was built as a          
 temperance hotel.  At a lower level is
 the aage where a cattle mart used to  
 operate.  The terrace itself was named
 after 2 blocks of each of 4 houses    
 built early this century.  Most  of   
 the houses in the new part of the     
 village were built by the council or  
 Scottish Special Housing Association.
