		<title>09Rhenigidale Hostel</title>
		<content> The hostel in Rhenigidale is run by   
 the Gatliff Trust. This Trust helps   
 local people to provide an empty house
 for hostel accommodation, thus        
 enabling all, but especally young     
 people of limited means to explore    
 this sparsely populated area of the   
 Western Isles more easily. There are  
 four trust houses in the Islands and  
 they are open to everyone and are     
 quite independent of the SYHA. The    
 warden of the hostel in Rhenigidale is
 Roddy MacInnes although he does not   
 live in the hostel. Facilities in     
 these hostels are sparse with toilet  
 facilities and running cold water     
 only. Campbeds, blankets, calor gas,  
 cooking utensils, cutlery and crockery
 are provided. In the hostel here there
 is a kitchen, toilet, sitting         
 room/girl's dormitory and a boy's     
 dormitory upstairs.                   </content>
