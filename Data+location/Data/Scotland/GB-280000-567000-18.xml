		<title>18A day in the life of Jenny</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.45 am and get ready for 
 school. I go through to the kitchen   
 and have toast with lemon curd. I take
 that through to the living room, sit  
 at the fire and watch TV-AM until     
 about eight o'clock. I then take my   
 Jack Russell pups out to do their     
 business. By that time it should be   
 8.10 and my brother and I go up to    
 catch the Western S.M.T. bus to       
 school.                               
 You need a season ticket to get on.   
 The bus takes you to Castle Douglas   
 via Clarebrand. We get off at the High
 School and go into our form class. I  
 wait there until the bell rings, then 
 the teacher comes in to take the      
 register. After a normal school day I 
 get into the bus and go home, get     
 changed, have something to eat and go 
 and help my dad up at the farm. I am  
 13 years old.                         </content>
