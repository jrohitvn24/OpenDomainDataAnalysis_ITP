     The{school}sits in a{rural area}  
 surrounded by farm land. The{school}is
{not}in the{local village}but sits at  
 the bottom of the hill which is the   
 only road into the village and all    
 traffic has to go up. There is very   
 little in the way of amenities in the 
 area and we have to travel to Drongan 
 or one of the other larger towns which
 are all a bus ride away. The scenery  
 around the area is beautiful as the   
 mining industry has long since closed 
 down and the countryside has begun the
 process of covering the scars left    
 when the coal was being mined. The    
 majority of the working adults have to
 travel out of the area to find work as
 this was mainly a mining community and
 the number now employed in that       
 industry has dropped to almost none.  </content>
