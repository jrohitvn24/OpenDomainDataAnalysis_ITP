		<title>11 Assynt Mountain Rescue Team</title>
		<content> In{February 1977}, the Volunteer      
 Mountain Rescue team in Assynt was    
 formed (20_24 men and women) after a  
 number of accidents in the hills. They
 train once a month with all their     
 equipment and send men to the Cairn   
 Gorms. Rescues of potholers, anglers  
 and walkers getting lost are as common
 as rescuing climbers in the hills. The
 police give a lot of support and help 
 to buy some of the equipment needed.  
 Team members and wives raise a lot of 
 money themselves and in{1985}this team
 built a centre where they keep gear   
 and the landrover ( a gift from the   
 "Order of St John")Gear includes ropes
 harnesses,emergency food and first aid
 boxes. Dogs (collies &amp; alsations) help
 find people in the hills. Helicopters 
 come from Lossiemouth,a 40min.journey.
 Each rescuer carries emergency food,  
 clothing and basic equipment.         </content>
