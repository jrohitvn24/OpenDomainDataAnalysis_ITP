		<content>     Friday evening the last one leaves
 at 11.15 still a bit early for any    
 entertainment.Most people here work in
 Glasgow so the Glasgow bus is very    
 busy  during the peak times when      
 people are going to or returning from 
 work.Otherwise the only people using  
 the buses are school children going to
 school or O.A.Ps taking advantage of a
 cheap 12p ticket on off peak buses.The
 normal fare into Glasgow is 86p single
 adult fare although a 7 day weekly is 
 available at Â£7.25 and a four week    
 monthly ticket is Â£27.20.There are    
 only 7 buses a day going to East      
 Kilbride.The first one is at 7.12am   
 and the last at 5.24pm.The cost of a  
 single adult fare is 50p.On service as
 there were few people going to work by
 this bus.Quite a few people did       
 however use it on a regular casual    
 basis to go to the swimming pool      </content>
