		<title>02Bus Service Through Mulben</title>
		<content>                                       
 The A95 from Keith to Mulben runs     
 almost paraallel to the Rosarie Burn  
 and the Burn of Mulben.  The Railway  
 Line runs close by and also parallel. 
 We can tell that there has been a road
 there for a long time because there is
 an old Toll House on the road to Keith
 and off our map.                      
 There is a public bus service along   
 this road.  Buses take fifteen minutes
 to travel from Keith to Mulben.  You  
 can get a bus in Keith at 09.00,      
 12.15 or 15.35 hours.  The times of   
 buses from  Mulben are 08.35, 10.35   
 and 13.45 hours, and you arrive in    
 Keith fifteen minutes later.          
 These services operate on school days 
 During school holidays, buses run on  
 Tuesdays and Fridays only.  The       
 morning bus does not run in holiday   
 time.                                 </content>
