		<title>18Forest walks</title>
		<content> The{Winding Walks}form part of the    
{Speymouth Forest}and are situated on  
 the{A98.                              
 Towards the end of the nineteenth     
 century the{Duke of Gordon &amp; Richmond 
 had footpaths and bridges built       
 and planted rhododendrons and conifers
 but, after the First World War, there 
 was a drop in local interest in the   
 Walks.                                
 The general lack of repair was not    
 helped when the{Great Gale of 1953    
 badly damaged sections of the forest  
 and it was not unitl 1972, after      
 repair work done by a group from      
{Gordonstoun School,}that the Walks    
 were reopened.                        
 There are a variety of walks, the most
 popular taking walkers to{The Peeps,}a
 viewpoint from which Fochabers and the
 surrounding countryside can be seen.
