		<title>01Lammermuirs Dip Slope</title>
		<content> South facing, gently sloping dip slope
 of the lammermuir hill. Most of the   
 land is cultivated either under       
 cereals or grass including that shown 
 as rough grazing on the 1:50,000 first
 series O.S.  The area also includes   
 some sizable (15-20 h.a.9 commercial  
 conifer plantations,there are the     
 settlements of size but there seem to 
 be four farm units, two having typical
 rows of farm cottages, some modernised
 and improved. Those at Buterdean are  
 more substantial than those at        
 Quixwood and still retain their own   
 garden plots. The farms themselves are
 a mixture of modern sheetcadded units 
 and run down (19 buildings) A well is 
 shown at Butterdeam.
