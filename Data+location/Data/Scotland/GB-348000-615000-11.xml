		<title>11PLAYGROUND GAMES.</title>
		<content> In the playground children play       
 football, rugby, skipping, ball games,
 chasing, hide and seek, tig and       
 hopscotch as well as games based on   
 popular television programmes such as 
 A. Team, Emu's World. There seems to  
 be more variety of games played by    
 girls than boys and many include      
 rhymes. This is a skipping            
 rhyme:-Madamoiselle went to the well  
 To wash her face, to dry it, To comb  
 her hair, to say a prayer, To catch a 
 ball in the basket. This rhyme is said
 while jumping with feet together and  
 apart, and then legs crossed:- Cat's  
 got the measles, Dog's got the flu,   
 Chicken's got the chicken pox, And so 
 have you.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
