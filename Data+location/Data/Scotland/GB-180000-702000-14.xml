		<content>   In 1980 a pair of whales ,thought to
 be Risso's Grampus, were seen(&amp; heard)
 in the loch. They were estimated to be
 about 15' in length.                  
   Two years later a leatherback turtle
 was stranded on rocks near a small is-
 land (reached by a causeway &amp; just on 
 the perimeter of our block).2 children
 (now both pupils at the school) were  
 amongst the first to discover it.Fear-
 ing for its safety(the nights had been
 very cold)a plan was made to'launch'it
 (despite opinion that the 5'creature  
 probably weighed about 600lbs!)but ult
 -imately it managed on its own!       
   In Autumn (84) there were many sight
 -ings of what was thought to be a pair
 of black pumas (even in the centre of 
 the village!).The mystery is still un-
 solved.This makes mentioning a wild   
 herd of black goats (living on Eilean 
 Mhic Crion) seem very 'ordinary'.     </content>
