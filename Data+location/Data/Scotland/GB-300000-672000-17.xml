		<title>17WILD LIFE.</title>
		<content> Many wild animals can be seen at the  
 country park. This is especially so if
 you can walk through the park in the  
 early morning or as dusk is falling.  
 Badgers have several setts throughout 
 the park and one is near the old lime 
 workings in box A.Here the young      
 badgers can be seen playing.          
 Foxes live in many of the old badger  
 setts. They are protected within the  
 park as the Linlithgowshire hunt is   
 not allowed to hunt within the        
 boundary of Beecraigs.                
 There is a grey squirrel colony very  
 near the field archery. The dreys can 
 be seen and the cones which the       
 animals have gnawed lie scattered on  
 the ground.                           
 Mallard,coots and herons are  to      
 be seen at the loch. In summer bright 
 blue damsel flies are plentiful.
