{Cereal Crops-} Winter Barley is grown 
 more than Spring Barley because this  
 gives a 15% greater yield. Most grain 
 is stored for feeding, some is sold to
 merchants, and a little to breweries. 
 Harvesting is by Combine Harvester. It
 is interesting to note that oats are  
 no longer grown.                      
{Root Crops- Birkhall Farm}is the only 
 farm to grow potatoes commercially.   
 Less than 10 acres of turnips are     
 grown to provide some of the winter   
 feed for sheep.                       
{Grass-}Hay is still made although     
 grass is now more commonly used for   
 silage. Silage needs more mechanism.  
{Buildings-}Large modern asbestos roof-
 ed buildings allow loose housing of   
 cattle. With a 40-year lifespan there 
 is concern for their future safety.   
 Old buildings are still whitewashed.  </content>
