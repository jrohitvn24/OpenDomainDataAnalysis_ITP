		<title>14Moniaive Primary School</title>
		<content> Mrs.Robson teaches at Moniaive Primary
 and is an incomer to the village.She  
 likes Moniaive very much and greatly  
 enjoys her job.School today is more   
 interesting and teachers work harder  
 with the modern methods.An advantage  
 of living and working in the same     
 village is that you do not need to get
 up so early because your work is      
 near(she hates getting up in the      
 morning).A disadvantage is that she   
 never really gets away from her work  
 as parents find it handy to phone her 
 or call at her house if they have a   
 problem.She has been in her present   
 job for 7 years and has seen some     
 changes.The cloakroom used to be an   
 office,she used to teach P1/P2 but now
 teaches P3/P4 and a new head called   
 Mr.Mc.Larty came in October 1983.
