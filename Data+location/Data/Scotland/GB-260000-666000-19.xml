		<title>19Springburn Shopping Centre</title>
		<content> In Springburn Way,the Centre was open-
 ed in 1981.The seating area is set out
 like a railway station reflecting the 
 link of Springburn with the railways. 
 Open from Mon.-Sat.the Centre is kept 
 clean.Security staff are always there.
 Those who use the Centre do so often. 
 Many come more than once a week,others
 every day.Shops are varied but people 
 would like more.There is a need for   
 facilities for leisure and children.  
 Advantages of the Centre-shops under  
 cover;grouped together;near the homes.
 Many people enjoy the company.People  
 disagree as to the relative prices of 
 items here compared to those in the   
 centre of Glasgow.Just over half asked
 said that they would travel to the    
 centre of the city to buy goods that  
 are available at the Shopping Centre.
