		<content>{Mr Macrae}is the{cemetery  warden}and 
 he says that he hasn't seen a ghost,  
 nor does he believe in them. He says  
 that people don't die on a regular    
 basis but on average there are about  
 54 funerals a year.  His job is mainly
 burying the dead. He also visits the  
 cemetery each night to  make sure that
 everything is quite all right. This   
 tends to deter vandals. The{oldest    
{grave}in the cemetery is that of John 
 Simpson and Mary Morris who were      
 buried in 1863. Mr Macrae has been    
 working there for fourteen years and  
 has only had one accident: he fell    
 through two coffins whilst putting the
 third one in the ground!{    Mr Hugen}
 is the local{policeman.}He works      
 different shifts, i.e. early, back    
 shift and night shift. He says there  
 are{very few serious crimes.}He finds 
 his work enjoyable and interesting.   </content>
