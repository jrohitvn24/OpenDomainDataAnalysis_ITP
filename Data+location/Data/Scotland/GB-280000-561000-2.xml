		<title>02DALBEATTIE FLOOD PREVENTION</title>
		<content> On October 31st 1977 Dalbeattie       
 experienced a very severe flood.It    
 damaged people's property and caused  
 a lot of inconvenience.A few years    
 later grants were awarded by the      
 government and the E.E.C. and from    
 then the{Flood Prevention Scheme      
 started up.Consultants were called in 
 to devise a scheme.This was accepted  
 and the work was completed.At first it
 was to cost Â£300,000 but this soared  
 up to Â£1.2 million.The banks of the   
 Bar Burn, which flows through the     
 town, were built up to a great height 
 and bridges were raised too.Opinion in
 the town is divided.Some people think 
 it was a waste of money and others    
 think it has improved Dalbeattie.Some 
 people think it has ruined the        
 landscape but they aren't the ones    
 whose houses were flooded and damaged!
