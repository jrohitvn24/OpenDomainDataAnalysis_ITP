		<title>11DISCUSSION WITH FARMER</title>
		<content> MR BURGESS HAS BEEN A FARMER ON       
 "BANDON" FARM FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS.    
 WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO THIS NORTHERN   
 PART OF GLENROTHES, THERE WERE NO     
 HOUSES, AND FARMS WERE DOMINANT IN THE
 AREA. MR BURGESS SAID THAT IN THOSE   
 DAYS HIS FARM WAS TAKEN UP WITH       
 LIVESTOCK AND VARIOUS CROPS INCLUDING 
 WHEAT, BARLEY AND CATTLE FODDER.      
 NOWADAYS HE SAYS THAT WITH GLENROTHES 
 EXPANDING NORTHWARDS HE HAS LOST SOME 
 LAND BUT HAS RECIEVED COMPENSATION    
 FROM THE GLENROTHES DEVELOPMENT       
 CORPORATION. MR BURGESS NOW HAS NO    
 LIVESTOCK EXCEPT FOR A SMALL NUMBER   
 OF POULTRY. HE STILL GROWS BARLEY AND 
 POTATOES. MR BURGESS THEN SAID THAT   
 100 YEARS AGO THIS PART OF GLENROTHES 
 WAS COVERED IN WOODLAND AND THEN WHEN 
 HE FIRST CAME TO THE AREA FARMS BECAME
 THE DOMINANT FACTOR.
