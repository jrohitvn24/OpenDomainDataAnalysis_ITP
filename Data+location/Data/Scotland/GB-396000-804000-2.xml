		<title>02ABERDEEN HARBOUR</title>
		<content> The intrinsic nature of Aberdeen      
 Harbour has dramatically altered over 
 the past 20 years.From being a major  
 fishing and minor cargo port it has   
 metamorphosed into the major oil      
 supply port of Europe.During the past 
 20 years the number of ships using the
 harbour has increased fivefold.Most of
 the boats using the harbour now are   
 Oil Supply boats,'Standbye' boats,    
 seismic survey vessels and Royal Navy 
 warships and craft.There are still    
 fishing trawlers but greatly reduced  
 in numbers and part of the new fish   
 market is no longer used.Regularily   
 seen is the familiar sight of the pale
 blue and white P.O. ferry the 'ST     
 CLAIR' which sails up to the Shetland 
 Isles.The quays have also been        
 transformed, most have oil tanks or   
 oil service depots located on them now
 replacing the traditional fish houses.</content>
