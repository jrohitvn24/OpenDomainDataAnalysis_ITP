		<content>  My name is Richard. I go to several  
 clubs in the village.                 
   On Wednesday I go to the Cub Scouts.
 It is good fun because as well as     
 learning things we play games such as 
 Chinese Ladders and Tom and Jerry.    
 We also learn how to tie knots. We are
 given badges to show that we have     
 learned certain useful things like    
 simple cooking, home handyman,cycling 
 efficiency etc. The club lasts from   
 6.30 to 8.30 pm.                      
   I also go to the junior tennis club.
 I have been a member for three years. 
   I am going to join the bowling club 
 which is next door to the tennis club.
 My dad is a member.                   
   I belong to the school badminton    
 club which is held in our school in   
 the village. This club takes place    
 after school. A teacher coaches us    
 and we compete with other schools.    </content>
