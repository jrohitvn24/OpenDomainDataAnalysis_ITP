		<title>09THE LOSS OF COMMUNITY LIFE</title>
		<content> "Another great change is the loss of  
 community life. There used to be clubs
 and societies (whist, bridge, floral  
 arts, etc.), in the village hall two  
 or three evenings a week. Everyone    
 joined in. Not any more. Many of the  
 houses are occupied by incomers who   
 work in the oil industry and who keep 
 themselves very much to themselves.   
 Until several years ago a man used to 
 go round the area in a van selling    
 groceries. The man went into{Aberdeen}
 to collect his groceries first thing  
 in the morning before calling at all  
 the houses for trade. The conversion  
 of the local shop into a mini-        
 supermarket put paid to the travelling
 grocer. I would miss the supermarket  
 now as I get all my shopping there and
 collect my pension from the{sub-Post  
{Office}inside the shop."
