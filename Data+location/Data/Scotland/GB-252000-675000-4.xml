		<title>04CRAIGTON SMIDDY</title>
		<content> There have been 3 generations of      
 Drummonds in the Smiddy.Mr Robert     
 Drummond told  us it was mainly       
 shoeing horses they used to do but    
 they did repairing of farm implements 
 and putting iron rims on cart         
 wheels as well.Then, they would use   
 iron but now mild steel is used       
 since iron is hard to get .Being a    
 blacksmith now is much easier than    
 it used to be.In the old days the     
 Smiddy was used as a place of         
 meeting in Craigton.                  
   When we visited it, they were making
 a large metal box for Hilton Park Golf
 Course to keep petrol in.They also    
 make gates and fences, some nicely    
 decorated. Hardly any horses are shoed
 now.
