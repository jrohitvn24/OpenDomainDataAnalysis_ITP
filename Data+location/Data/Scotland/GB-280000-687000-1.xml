		<content> There are four primary schools in the 
 area including one Catholic school,   
 plus one special school. None of them 
 have more than 200 pupils. The four   
 mainstream schools were all built in  
 the last century.                     
 West Plean School began as a fee      
 paying school for colliers' children. 
 There used to be several collieries in
 the area but now there is only one.   
 Plean Colliery closed in 1962. The    
 school is situated on the old Roman   
 Road and is surrounded by many        
 interesting places that we frequently 
 visit with our teacher. There is a    
 fort just north of Plean House and a  
 Broch at Torwood. The Field of        
 Bannockburn is visited by thousands of
 tourists.
