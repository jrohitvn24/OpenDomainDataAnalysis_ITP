		<title>03LIFE AT LOCH AVICH</title>
		<content> I live on the banks of Loch Avich.Both
 my mum and dad work on our farm.We    
 have sheep and a few cows.I like      
 spring because of the lambs.The Loch  
 is 5 miles long.There are 9 people    
 living in the 12km block and 3 other  
 people along the Loch.Our land lords  
 come up 3_5 times a year.They stay at 
 Loch Avich house.We have (at the      
 moment) 10 dogs and 2 pups.7 of the 10
 dogs are sheep dogs.We don't grow     
 crops and are mainly a hill farm and  
 we have about 20 acres of low ground. 
    In the spring we have the sheep    
 lambing and in the spring and later on
 into early summer we have the lamb    
 marking.We clip the sheep and dip them
 in summer and dip them again in       
 Autunm.In the winter we put the tups  
 (rams) out for tupping.
