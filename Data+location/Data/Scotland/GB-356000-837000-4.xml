		<content> There is a stone circle at Stoneyfield
 Farm.This consists of six stones split
 into two groups.I have not seen any   
 marks or carvings on any of the       
 stones.Rumour has it that a farmer was
 going to move them as he did not      
 realise that they had any significance
 and this is understandable on seeing  
 the stones.                           
 Robert the Bruce is said to have spent
 a night at Robin's Height near Boghead
 Farm.                                 
 There is the ruins of a church at     
 Brideswell.                           
 There is a War Memorial with the names
 of people associated with Drumblade   
 who died in the First World War.It is 
 a permanent reminder of how that      
 horrific event affected all areas.
