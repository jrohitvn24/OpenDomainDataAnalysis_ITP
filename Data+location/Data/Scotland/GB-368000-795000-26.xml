<content>

At our school we have smartboards. A smartboard is a big board . The teachers computer is plugged into a projector and the projector is facing the smartboard so the children dont all have to crowd around the teachers computer when he/she shows us something on the computer. Another good thing about the smartboard is that it is touch screen.&lt;br />&lt;br />Our school uses Glow. Glow is a website that the children can submit things on to it like what they have achieved and things like that. Each class has a page on glow. Their page has got pictures and what they have been doing in class. It is updated weekly and parents have an account. On snow days if we cant get to school the teacher sets work on glow for us to complete, this can include taking pictures witha digital camera. We can also have a live web chat or a video conference on glow.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
