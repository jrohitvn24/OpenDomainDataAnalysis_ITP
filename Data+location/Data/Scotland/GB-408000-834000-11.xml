		<title>11EDUCATION IN CRUDEN BAY.</title>
		<content> 180 years ago the Erroll School was   
 opened two miles away from the        
 village. The school was probably out  
 of the village because of farmers',   
 children.                             
        100 years ago people of the    
 village asked the Earl of Erroll to   
 build an Infant school because it was 
 too far for the young children to     
 walk. The Infant School closed in 1904
 when Aberdeenshire Education built    
 Port Erroll School.                   
        During the 2nd World War the   
 school population doubled because of  
 evacuees. The village children were   
 taken in the morning and the evacuees 
 in the afternoon.                     
        The Erroll school closed in    
 1954. Port Erroll school closed in    
 1978. Port Erroll new school opened   
 and in 1980 both schools came into use
 because of increase in numbers.       </content>
