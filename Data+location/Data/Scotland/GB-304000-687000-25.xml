<title>25Alexander Morton Sawmill</title>
<content>

The Alexander Morton Sawmill, in Rumblingwell, was knocked down to build the houses in Whitemyre Court at the end of the 1980's. The land on the other side of the road where the offices were situated was also used to build the Backwell Court houses. Before it was knocked down the wood for the sawmill came from Sweden and Finland by boat to Grangemouth, on the River Forth. It then travelled by train to the sawmill, via Stirling and Alloa on the old train line, which is now a cycle track. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
