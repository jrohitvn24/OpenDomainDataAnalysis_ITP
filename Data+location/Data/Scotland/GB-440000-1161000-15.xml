		<title>15Voe's Churches.</title>
		<content> Voe's first church was built in the   
 late eighteenth century.This church is
 now in ruins.                         
 Voe's second church was opened in     
 1860.It was a two storey building made
 of limestone.This building had large  
 arched stained glass windows.The pews 
 were wooden and at the end of each pew
 was a small door which opened to      
 provide a space for small children to 
 sit.This church closed forty years ago
 because it had a crack on one side.The
 people in Voe thought it could be     
 repaired but in the end it was        
 demolished.                           
 The present day church was constructed
 soon after.It was very small compared 
 to the previous church.The church is  
 white washed with blue                
 windows.A weekly service is conducted 
 on Sunday at noon by Rev.G.Simm.
