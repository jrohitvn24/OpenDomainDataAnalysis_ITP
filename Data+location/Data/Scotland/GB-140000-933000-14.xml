		<content> A common sight in the residential     
 areas is{Smith's lemonade lorry}making
 its regular deliveries. We interviewed
 an employee who told us that on       
 average they make about six thousand  
 bottles a week and usually sell just  
 as much to customers all over eastern 
 Lewis. Using flavouring,sugar and     
 water plus a few other ingredients    
 they make eight different kinds of    
 lemonade; cream soda, red cola, black 
 cola, pineapple, limeade, iron        
 brew, and of course last but not least
 lemonade.                             
 The business was started in April 1978
 and still going well with only five   
 all men enployees. Their best time for
 doing business is at Christmas and    
 New Year and with hardly any changes  
 over the years they're still going    
 strong.
