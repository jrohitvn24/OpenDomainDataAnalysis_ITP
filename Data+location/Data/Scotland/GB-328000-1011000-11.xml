		<content>   Formerly there were two working     
 mills in the study area, the Mill of  
 Stenness which had an undershot water 
 wheel and the Mill of Tormiston with  
 an overshot wheel. Both buildings are 
 still standing today, the former used 
 as a cattle shed by the farm of       
 Housequoy; its wheel and machinery has
 gone.The wheel and machinery of       
 Tormiston Mill still exist and are in 
 excellent working condition but the   
 mill itself has been turned into a    
 gift shop and restaurant. Because of  
 its location near the chambered tomb  
 of Maeshowe,approximately 20 000      
 visitors pass through it annually and 
 12 staff are employed at peak periods.
 The mill was built of local stone and 
 Welsh slate in 1882 and stopped       
 working as a mill in l962.The         
 restoration of the mill won for       
 its owners a European Heritage Award. </content>
