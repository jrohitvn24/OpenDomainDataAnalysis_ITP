<title>21Not too much change</title>
<content>

It was very interesting to look back 25 years to the views expressed at that time, especially as it was around that time that we moved from the south of England to Moffat, having previously holidayed here for about 10 years.  The community spirit of the town still remains.  It is a very friendly town and people from the World over are welcomed here.  It will be interesting to see from the results of the 2011 Census how the population numbers and age spread have changed.  I doubt the actual population is much different from 1986, but more young families move into the town now because of the Academy's reputation and because Moffat is such an easy commute to Glasgow/Edinburgh/Dumfries and Carlisle.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Recently Moffat has embraced green issues and we have Moffat CAN with their recycling facilities and allotments and Let's Eat Local offering a service to provide boxes of local produce.   &lt;br />
