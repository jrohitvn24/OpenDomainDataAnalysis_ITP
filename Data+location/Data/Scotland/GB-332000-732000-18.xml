		<title>18THE VILLAGE OF BIRKHILL</title>
		<content>                                       
 Birkhill is situated just back from   
 the A923 Dundee-Coupar Angus road.It  
 has a fairly large population but no  
 proper shops.This is because it is    
 joined, by a thin strip of houses, to 
 Muirhead. Although it has no proper   
 shops it does have a joiners/funeral  
 directors establishment as well as a  
 factory  specialising in processing   
 foods such as haggis, black pudding   
 and white pudding.Two other things    
 this village contains are a garage a  
 an inn(the only social facility       
 outwith Muirhead).                    
  There are approx. 350 houses in      
 Birkhill about 150 of which have been 
 built within the last 15 years.       
  To the North of Birkhill is          
 Blairfield farm a mainly cereal       
 growing farm with grade B-B+ soil that
 has been well cultivated.             </content>
