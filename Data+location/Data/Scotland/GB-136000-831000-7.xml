		<title>07MEDICAL CARE IN CARBOST.</title>
		<content> For our village and the surrounding   
 areas,we have one doctor and two      
 district nurses.One of the nurses is  
 also the health visitor to our        
 school.The doctor has a surgery next  
 to his house at Trien,which is about 2
 miles from the village.Consulting     
 hours for the surgery are from        
 9.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m.every          
 weekday,except Thursday.We are        
 fortunate because an appointment does 
 not need to be made and if the patient
 is too unwell to go to the surgery,the
 doctor will visit the home.           
 The nearest hospital is in Portree,16 
 miles away.Sometimes a patient may go 
 to Broadfoard Hospital,26 miles       
 away.If the illness cannot be dealt   
 with on the island, a mainland        
 hospital,perhaps 200 miles away might 
 be necessary.
