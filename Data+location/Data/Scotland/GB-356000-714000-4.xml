		<title>04FARMING : KENLEY GREEN FARM</title>
		<content>   Kenley Green Farm is an example of a
 mixed farm in Boarhills, keeping beef 
 cattle as well as growing a large     
 variety of crops.                     
    The cattle are mostly Charollais   
 crossed with Hereford and Simmenthal. 
 The continental breeds increase the   
 overall weight of the animal.         
    Plant breeding techniques over the 
 last 10 years have resulted in hybrids
 which greatly improve quality and     
 yields.Crops which are grown are      
 wide-ranging; winter and spring       
 barley, broccoli, potatoes, turnips,  
 brussels sprouts, oilseed rape and    
 grass.                                
    Irrigation pumps take water from   
 the Kenley Burn and use it in times of
 water shortage. However, because of   
 the increasing use of fertilisers and 
 pesticides, the burn has become       
 polluted, particularly by nitrates.   </content>
