		<content>   The only industry in Bishopton is   
 the Royal Ordnance Factory (R.O.F.).  
 It was established in 1917. Its       
 products contribute towards armaments 
 for Britain and are also exported to  
 other countries. It is due to be      
 privatised in the near future. There  
 have been a number of explosions, but 
 none causing a major disaster. Most of
 what goes on inside the factory is top
 secret.                               
   South of the village is a deserted  
 quarry which was a source of basalt   
 for building.                         
   Many of the residents of Bishopton  
 work in industries in nearby large    
 towns, e.g. shipyards and I.B.M. in   
 Greenock, Babcock Engineering in      
 Renfrew and Coats in Paisley.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
