 AMONGST MY FRIENDS.IN CARNOUSTIE THERE
 IS A JUNIOR FOOTBALL TEAM.MOST OF THE 
 BOYS WHO PLAY ARE AGED BETWEEN 10 TO  
 15.MY FRIENDS EITHER PLAY FOOTBALL OR 
 SUPPORT FOOTBALL TEAMS.THEY USUALLY   
 SUPPORT PREMIER LEAGUE TEAMS AND      
 ENGLISH LEAGUE TEAMS,SUCH AS EVERTON  
 AND DUNDEE.THE GAME OF FOOTBALL WITH  
 RULES STARTED IN 1863 BUT SCOTLAND    
 HAVE PRODUCED MANY FAMOUS FOOTBALL    
 PLAYERS,WHO NOW PLAY FOR ENGLISH      
 TEAMS.THEY EARN MORE MONEY IN ENGLAND 
 AND ENJOY THE PRESTIGE OF PLAYING FOR 
 A GOOD TEAM.TO BECOME A FOOTBALL      
 PLAYER YOU SHOULD PLAY FOR A JUNIOR   
 TEAM AND TRY TO BE NOTICED BY "SCOUTS"
 OR MANAGERS.YOU HAVE TO PUT IN A LOT  
 OF PRACTICE.USUALLY I TRAIN 3 DAYS A
