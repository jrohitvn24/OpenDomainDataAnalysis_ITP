		<title>02Housing in and around Saline</title>
		<content> The older housing in Saline borders   
 the main streets through Saline, one  
 lying in an east-west direction and   
 the other lying in a north-south      
 direction.                            
 Further housing has spread the village
 and changed it from what was once a   
 linear village into a compact village.
 The housing estates built since around
 1960 are both privately owned and     
 local government owned. The privately 
 owned sector outnumbers the local     
 government sector.                    
 The housing estates are attractive,   
 none of them being large, and the     
 planning has included are variety of  
 styles and interesting layout.        
 The village of Steelend was built for 
 and owned by the NCB until 1983/84    
 when the houses were put up for sale  
 and bought by private enterprise,who  
 are modernising and reselling them.   </content>
