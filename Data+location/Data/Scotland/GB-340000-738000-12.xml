		<title>12ANGUS TRANSMITTING STATION</title>
		<content>  THE ANGUS TRANSMITTING STATION MAST  
 IS SITUATED ON TEALING HILL. THE      
 MANAGER IS MISTER PRYDE.              
  THE PRESENT BRITISH TELEVISION SYSTEM
 USES 625 LINES AND IS BROADCAST AT    
 ULTRA HIGH FREQUENCY (UHF). BECAUSE   
 THE PATH LENGTH OF THESE SIGNALS IS   
 MORE OR LESS LINE OF SIGHT AND THE    
 SIGNAL DECREASES WITH DISTANCE, IT IS 
 NOT POSSIBLE TO COVER THE WHOLE OF THE
 COUNTRY USING ONE TRANSMITTER,RATHER  
 THIS IS DONE BY A NUMBER OF MAIN      
 TRANSMITTERS PLUS A NUMBER OF RELAY   
 STATIONS. IN THE SURVEY AREA AND      
 ADJOINING DISTRICTS , THE MAIN        
 TRANSMITTER IS LOCATED AT TEALING AND 
 BROADCASTS BBC1,BBC2,GRAMPIAN TV AND  
 CHANNEL 4.THE TEALING TRANSMITTER     
 RECEIVES ITS SIGNAL FROM THE ABERDEEN 
 TRANSMITTER LOCATED AT DURRIS.THE MAST
 IS 750 FT. HIGH. POWER IS CARRIED BY  
 CO_AXIAL CABLES FROM THE TRANSMITTERS.</content>
