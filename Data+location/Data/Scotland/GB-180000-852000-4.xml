		<title>04HISTORY OF SHIELDAIG VILLAGE</title>
		<content>    THE VILLAGE OF SHIELDAIG WAS BUILT 
 AS A GROWTH POINT IN THE LATE 18TH    
 EARLY 19TH CENTURY BY THE BRITISH     
 FISHERIES SOCIETY.                    
    A NEW ROAD SURVEYED BY TELFORD WAS 
 THEN BUILT FROM LOCHCARRON.           
    THE OLD CHURCH OF SCOTLAND AND     
 MANSE WAS ALSO BUILT TO TELFORD'S     
 SPECEFICATIONS.   UNFORTUNATELY THE   
 ROOF OF THIS CHURCH FELL IN AND A NEW 
 ONE WAS BUILT ON THE SAME SITE.   ALL 
 THAT REMAINS OF THE OLD CHURCH IS PART
 OF THE OUTER WALL WHICH IS NOW INFRONT
 OF THE NEW CHURCH                     
    BEHIND THE HOTEL IS THE STONE      
 KNOWN AS THE MEETING STONE, WHERE     
 THE FISHERMEN AND CROFTERS WOULD      
 MEET TO DISCUSS THE DAILY WORK        
 .                                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
