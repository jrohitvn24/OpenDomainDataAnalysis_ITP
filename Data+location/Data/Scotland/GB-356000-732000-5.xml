		<title>05Working in Carnoustie.</title>
		<content>   Carnoustie and the area to the east 
 of the town is mainly a residential   
 area which is popular with tourists.  
 For that reason,there is no real      
 industry that can provide residents   
 with jobs.                            
   Most people who work in Carnoustie  
 are involved in tourism.There are many
 shops which sell items which camping  
 holiday-makers would need and, of     
 course,these shops are needed and     
 used by residents too.There are also  
 several souvenir shops which become   
 much busier in the summer.            
   Since tourism is important,it is    
 fairly easy for people to find        
 themselves casual employment over the 
 summer.Working in the hotels and on   
 the golf courses are just two         
 examples.                             
   In general there is no noticeable   
 unemployment problem in the area.     </content>
