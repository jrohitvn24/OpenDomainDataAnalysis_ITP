		<title>04THE WOODCARVER</title>
		<content> The woodcarver has been working in his
 shop for about nine years making      
 all sorts of woodcarvings such as     
 bowls, tables, chess boards and       
 pieces,lamps and carved faces.        
 McNasties are a recent idea which the 
 woodcarver has developed. He describes
 them as being "Scotland's smallest    
 Clan,(average height around 3         
 inches),now only found in the         
 Cairngorm Mountains where they eke out
 a meagre living by melting down spent 
 shotgun cartridges and re-stilling the
 dregs from whisky bottles to make     
 their own ferocious blend, the famous 
 Glen Toxic!" He uses pine, birch, and 
 alder to make his carvings. In the    
 summer his shop is quite busy. Over   
 the winter he carves the pieces to be 
 sold in the shop in the summer.
