		<title>03The Farm</title>
		<content>   On my uncle's farm,there are 120    
 milking cows,and 50 calves.He has got 
 a dog called Fly and it gets the cows 
 in every day.He has 4 tractors and    
 lots of implements.In the summer he   
 bales.He makes silage as well.This    
 summer he got 5000 bales.He will need 
 a lot of bales to feed all his        
 animals.He has got Massey Ferguson    
 tractors.He has got a Ford digger.Last
 summer I helped him with his silage.He
 has got a New Holland combine.In the  
 morning the milk tanker comes to the  
 farm for the milk.When he comes he    
 gets a long pipe and connects it onto 
 the tank to get the milk out.He has   
 got a bull and it charges at you.After
 he does the milking he lets the cows  
 out.When he comes back in he cleans   
 out the milking palour.
