		<content>{    HOUSEWIFE IN CARRINGTON           
   I normally get up every morning at 7
 o'clock to make my husbands breakfast.
 He leaves for his work at an insurance
 office in Edinburgh at 8 o'clock. We  
 own a car which is really essential.  
 The bus service in Carrington is not  
 very good and we are probably cheaper 
 running a car than paying the bus     
 fares.                                
   I have a baby daughter who takes up 
 most of my time and she adds some fun 
 to my day. After doing my housework I 
 sometimes take the bus to Dalkeith or 
 Bonnyrigg which is the nearest        
 shopping centre, but it is very small.
   At the weekend we go  by car into   
 Edinburgh to one of the large         
 supermarkets to do our monthly        
 shopping. Our milk is delivered only  
 three times a week.
