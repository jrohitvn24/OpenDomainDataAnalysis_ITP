		<content> My name is Donna Torley. I go to      
 Pitteuchar West Primary school. I am  
 going to write about P7.When I first  
 came to the P7 area it was new and    
 exciting. The first few months flew by
 and it was soon Christmas. We started 
 the Chistmas pantomine. It was chaos  
 but fun. Dressing up and learning     
 scripts. On the day of the pantomine  
 excitment was in the air,it was a     
 great success. We also had a scots    
 night which was similar,but less      
 exciting. We have colours in the      
 school that means everybody in the    
 school from P4 upwards gets put into a
 colour. There are captains in P7.     
 Everybody does tests and sports and   
 you get points for your colour. The   
 colour with the most points wins. Now 
 I am leaving to go to High school it  
 is a big step and I wish I was not    
 taking it.                            </content>
