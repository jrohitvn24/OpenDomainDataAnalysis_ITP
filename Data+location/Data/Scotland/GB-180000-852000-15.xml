		<title>15THE BURIAL MOUND</title>
		<content>    AS THE DIGGING FOR THE COUNCIL     
 HOUSES WAS BEGUN IN 1974,THE WORKMEN  
 FOUND MORE THAN THEY BARGAINED FOR.   
 THEY DISCOVERED THE REMAINS OF A      
 BURIAL MOUND.                         
 THE BURIAL MOUND IN SHIELDAIG WAS MADE
 IN THE LATE BRONZE_EARLY IRON AGE.    
 THIS WAS A MOUND OF EARTH WITH  A     
 PASSAGE DOWN TO WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE 
 BURIED.THEY WERE CREMATED.A TEAM OF   
 ARCHEOLOGISTS FROM EDINBURGH UNCOVERED
 THE BURIAL GROUND AND FOUND THE ASHES 
 AND FRAGMENTS OF BONE,WHICH THEY      
 ANALYSED.   THERE WERE BONES OF ABOUT 
 THREE MEN.   THE BURIAL SITE IS NOW   
 COVERED BY THE PARKING PLACE FOR THE  
 COUNCIL HOUSES.   NOTHING IS LEFT TO  
 SHOW IT WAS THERE, BUT THE GAELIC NAME
 FOR THAT PLACE IS REAN-A CHLAIDH,     
 MEANING 'BURIAL PLACE'.
