 year in July. This is the famous{Alva 
{Highland Games,}which were held for   
 the first time in 1856.               
  The Alva Band leads a procession     
 through the town to the Johnstone     
 Park. Shows surround the playing field
 where all the events are held. There  
 are lots of rides,like the waltzer and
 speedway,roundabouts,sideshows,space  
 invaders and other fun things.        
  In the arena highland dancing takes  
 place with music played by the pipes. 
 Sprint races,cycling,throwing the     
 hammer,tossing the{caber}and throwing 
 a weight over the high bar are all    
 held here too. In 1982{Geoff Capes,}
