		<content> ECOLOGICALLY, WHITSOME IS ONE OF THE  
 MOST ALTERED AREAS OF SCOTLAND.   FIVE
 THOUSAND YEARS AGO IT WOULD BE COVERED
 BY DECIDUOUS WOOD _ OAK, ASH, ELM ON  
 DRY DRUMLINS, ALDER AND WILLOW ON     
 MARSHY AREAS.  NOW, BECAUSE THE GROUND
 WAS MUCH FOUGHT OVER AND BURNT IN THE 
 WARS OF INDEPENDENCE AND IS SO GOOD   
 FOR ARABLE FARMING, MOST OF THE TREES 
 AND FLOWERS OF PERMANENT GRASSLAND    
 HAVE GONE.  THE WILD HABITATS ARE     
 ALONG THE HORNDEAN BURN, NEWTOWN      
 QUARRY AND SOME OLD TRACKWAYS AND     
 BURNS.   IN THIS SURVEY WE COUNTED 170
 PLANTS, 20 ANIMALS AND 20 BIRDS ROUND 
 THE WOODLANDS, FARMS AND VILLAGE.     
 THE MOST INTERESTING AREA, NEWTOWN    
 QUARRY, HAS AT LEAST THREE PLANTS RARE
 IN SCOTLAND.
