		<content> One of the few industries in our D    
 block is at the{Highlands Seafoods}   
{Factory}situated very near the mouth  
 of the Bervie Water.                  
 Last year it looked as if this factory
 would close but recently it was bought
 over and the workforce has jumped back
 up to seventy women and ten men with  
 prospects of more employees being     
 taken on.                             
 The sea foods dealt with are{crabs}   
 caught locally,{prawns}caught on the  
 West Coast,{salmon}brought over from  
 fish farms also on the West Coast.    
 The live shellfish are cooked, opened 
 up and meat taken out, frozen and     
 packed, while the salmon is smoked,   
 sliced and packed ready for export.   
 While some of the finished products   
 are sold in this country some are     
 exported to Italy, America and        
 Belgium.                              </content>
