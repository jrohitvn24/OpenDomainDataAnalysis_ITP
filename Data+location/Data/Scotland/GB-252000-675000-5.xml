		<content>  In our block there are four farms.   
 Three are dairy farms with some sheep 
 and one is a sheep farm with some     
 cattle.Two of the farming families    
 have farmed here for over a hundred   
 years.                                
      All year round the dairy farmers 
 have to milk the cows twice a day.At  
 the end of spring they put fertilizer 
 on to make the hay grow.The cows also 
 go to grass in spring.                
     Hay has to be made in summer time.
 The farmers have to work quickly and  
 very long hours to get the hay dry and
 in before it rains.If there is not    
 enough hay they have to buy it.       
      In autumn the farmers have to buy
 calves so that next year they will    
 have more cows.The cows come back into
 sheds for the winter time.The old cows
 have to be sold.Autumn is a quiet time
 for the farmers.                      </content>
