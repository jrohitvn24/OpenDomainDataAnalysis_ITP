		<content> THE INFORMATION IN THE PRECEDING PAGES
 WAS GATHERED IN THE SUMMER OF 1985 BY 
 BOYS AND GIRLS IN JUNIPER GREEN       
 PRIMARY SCHOOL IN EDINBURGH.  THEY    
 WENT OUT IN THEIR TEACHERS' CARS OR ON
 FOOT AND CHECKED ALL THE              
 FIELDS,FARMS, ROADS, STREETS, HOUSES, 
 SHOPS - EVERYTHING.IN ADDITION, THEY  
 INTERVIEWED CERTAIN PEOPLE IN THE     
 COMMUNITY, PEOPLE WHOM THEY CONSIDERED
 TO BE TYPICAL OF LOCAL RESIDENTS.     
 OTHER CHILDREN WROTE STORIES IN SCHOOL
 AND SOME OF OUR TEACHERS TOOK THE     
 PHOTOGRAPHS.  ALTHOUGH OUR SCHOOL IS  
 NOT IN CURRIE THE AREA GIVEN TO US BY 
 THE DOMESDAY ORGANISERS HAD CURRIE AS 
 ITS CENTRE AND COVERED THE CURRIE,    
 BALERNO, JUNIPER GREEN AND COLINTON   
 AREAS WHICH LIE TO THE SOUTH WEST OF  
 EDINBURGH.
