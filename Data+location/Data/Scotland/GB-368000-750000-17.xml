		<content> THE CHURCH                            
 The parish church is situated by the  
 bridge over the Lunan river. It is a  
 very pleasant, small sandstone        
 building in a neat kirk yard. It was  
 built in 1844 on the site of a much   
 earlier church probably the one       
 mentioned in the 12th. century. Inside
 the church there is a memorial to     
 Walter Mill who was pastor of the     
 parish for forty years and the last   
 martyr of the Reformation. He was     
 burned at the stake at St.Andrews in  
 1558 in his 83rd. year for his        
 adherence to the Protestant faith.    
 Each year, on a Sunday evening in May 
 or June near to the date of his       
 martyrdom, a commemorative service is 
 held in the church.
