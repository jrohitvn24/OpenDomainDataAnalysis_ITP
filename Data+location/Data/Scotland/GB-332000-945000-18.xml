		<title>18Thrumster Graveyard</title>
		<content> Graveyards form an important link with
 the past.Thrumster's is built on the  
 site of an ancient chapel and was used
 before 1877 although an even older    
 graveyard served the locality.The     
 present undertaker operates from Wick,
 4 miles away.The old custom of kisting
 i.e.placing the body in the coffin    
 during a service in the home for the  
 family,neighbours and friends has now 
 almost died out.So also has the black-
 edged invitation card,the funeral hats
 and clothes and the procession on foot
 with the coffin from the home to the  
 graveside. News of death is intimated 
 in the local and regional press and   
 verbally.Women attend not just the    
 service but at the graveside.The      
 service is often conducted in a church
 or funeral parlour.Wreaths are still  
 common but the gravestones are more   
 usually simple granite slabs.         </content>
