		<content> Being a rural area there are no       
 tenements or multi-storeys to be seen.
 The houses are mostly{council or}     
{private houses.}                      
 Since oil was discovered in the North 
 Sea many houses have been built in the
 last ten years.                       
 Most of the private housing has       
 appeared on land to the east of the   
 A92 road, while two different lots of 
 council houses were built to the west.
 Many of the new private houses have   
 been bought by those working in the   
 oil industry - often those who work   
 two weeks offshore, two weeks onshore 
 and to whom travelling is not a major 
 concern.                              
 The only other concentration of houses
 is part of a council house scheme in  
 Gourdon.                              
 With farms needing fewer workers      
 several farm cottages are empty.      </content>
