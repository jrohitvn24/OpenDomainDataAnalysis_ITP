		<title>15Camp Meg (continued)</title>
		<content>    Meg was a curious sight and no     
 wonder people were afraid of her. She 
 was quite manly and dressed in a great
 army coat and wellington boots. She   
 often travelled to local villages and 
 towns on market day on her horse      
 called Skewball and her bulldog       
 called Help ran behind her.           
   One day she entered Skewball in a   
 race and he won. She became quite a   
 character.                            
   A young man appeared at her doorstep
 and it turned out to be her son. He   
 begged her to come home to Galloway   
 with him but she refused.             
    She was found lying dead in the    
 snow during one severe winter. She'd  
 been lying there for a few days. She  
 was buried in the old Newbattle       
 Cemetry.
