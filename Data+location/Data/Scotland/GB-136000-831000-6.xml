		<title>06CARBOST NEW PRIMARY SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> To meet the requirements of the       
 Education Act(Scotland)-1981,a        
 Consultative Paper was prepared in    
 1984,concerning re-organisation of    
 Primary Education in the areas served 
 by Carbost and Portnalong Schools.    
 As a result, a new Primary School will
 be built in the centre of Carbost,to  
 take in the pupils from both          
 schools.Neither existing building is  
 considered suitable accomodation,both 
 lacking many modern facilities.       
 Planned for 1987,the new school will  
 have a kitchen,gym/dining hall,staff  
 facilities,medical room and G.P.room  
 as well as 2 classrooms and toilets.  
 The community is delighted by the     
 prospect and look forward to a 'real' 
 community school,since the present one
 is already a focal point for it.
