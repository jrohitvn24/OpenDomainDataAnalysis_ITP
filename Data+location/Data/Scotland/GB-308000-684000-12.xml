		<title>12Farms, Pitreavie.</title>
		<content> Forming part of our landscape there   
 are several farms, nearly all west of 
 Pitcorthie. The most northern farm in 
 our area is the Grange. It has wheat  
 and hay and it also has milking cows. 
 Nobody lives at this farm but it is   
 still kept running by a man who has a 
 cowshed.  South from the Grange       
 farming goes on a t Easter Gellet and 
 there is also a Wester Gellet just    
 south from that. Both of these farms  
 have crops and cows.  Go east from    
 Wester Gellet and you come to         
 Leckerstone Farm, which has mainly hay
 and cereal crops such as barley.  The 
 only other farm in our area is        
 Blackhall Farm, which again has mainly
 hay and cereal crops.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
