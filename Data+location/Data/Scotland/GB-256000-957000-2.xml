		<title>02House of Tongue SUTHERLAND</title>
		<content> The Countess of Sutherland lives in   
 Tongue House which has been in the    
 family for 160 years. There are       
 actually two houses, the laird's      
 housebuilt in 1720, and the factor's  
 house which was built in 1678 and has 
 buttresses. There is a door in the    
 outer wall on Kyleside which came from
 Lochmaddy gaol. This door opens on to 
 a passage which crofters used when    
 they came to pay their rents to the   
 factor. The walls are very thick and  
 the windows very small with small     
 panes of glass. There are stables and 
 a doocot, and rooms where servants    
 lived in the old days. There is a lot 
 of carpeting in the Mackay tartan.    
 There is also a very big garden with a
 wall round it.  After Lady Sutherland 
 showed us round the house, she gave us
 coke and cake and we chatted.
