		<content> The village still celebrates in great 
 style, Hallowe'en when the majority of
 adults and children dress up and visit
 all the homes in the village. One is  
 still expected to perform to earn     
 one's Hallowe'en. Guy Fawkes' night is
 a communal evening when we all gather 
 in one field and each family          
 contributes broth, baked potatoes,    
 sausages and, of course, fireworks.   
 The children still go carol singing.  
 Obviously, Harvest thanksgiving is    
 very important. Gala week is held in  
 July. After the crowning of the Queen,
 there is a week of sporting and       
 entertaining activities culminating in
 the parade of decorated lorries.There 
 are different displays each year and  
 the procession is always headed by a  
 pipe band.All proceeds from these     
 festivities go to the Senior Citizens'
 Christmas dinner and summer outing.   </content>
