		<content> West Kilbride has one{Roman Catholic  
 church (St Bride's) and two which     
 belong to the{Church of Scotland}(St  
 Andrew's and Overton). There is also  
 the{Barony Church}which is used for   
 the Boys' Brigade meetings and on     
 other occasions.{"House-Church"       
{meetings}are also held in the         
 Community Centre_they believe that    
 going to people's houses brings them  
 closer to God. Mr Mitchell is the     
 minister of St Andrew's church and Mr 
 Cruickshanks is the minister of       
 Overton church. Canon Gunning is the  
 priest of St Bride's church. There are
 also several{Jehovah's Witnesses}in   
 the village _ they distrust medical   
 science so if one of their children is
 sick they will often not take them to 
 hospital,we understand. They believe  
 that only God can cure them.
