		<content> MACHINERY ON MARCHMONT FARMS CONSISTS 
 OF 2 COMBINES &amp; 8 TRACTORS TOGETHER   
 WITH ALL THE NECESSARY CULTIVATION    
 EQUIPMENT. THERE IS A WORKSHOP WHERE  
 ALL THESE ARE MAINTAINED &amp;/OR MENDED  
 OR MODIFIED. TRAILERS ARE MADE THERE &amp;
 FARM GATES, PARTICULARLY THE DOUBLE   
 ONES REQUIRED BY THE WIDTH OF SOME    
 MACHINERY, FOR OWN &amp; OUTSIDE USE. A   
 GRAIN DRYER WAS INSTALLED 2 YEARS AGO 
 SO THAT THE FARM CAN DRY ITS OWN GRAIN
 &amp; SEED &amp; THAT OF OTHERS. VERY LARGE   
 BARNS WERE BUILT TO HOUSE CONSIDERABLE
 QUANTITIES OF GRAIN BELONGING TO THE  
 FARM ITSELF &amp; TO OTHERS. ONE OF THE   
 BIG BARNS HAS A RADIO MAST SO THAT    
 RADIO CONTACT CAN BE MADE WITH VARIOUS
 VEHICLES THROUGHOUT THE ESTATE.       
 RECENTLY A COMPUTER HAS BEEN INSTALLED
 FOR MORE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT &amp;       
 ACCOUNTING.
