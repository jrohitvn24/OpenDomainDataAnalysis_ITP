		<title>12Benarty Community Centre</title>
		<content>  Since its opening in January 1985,   
 the centre has offered a wide variety 
 of activities to all age groups. Some 
 examples are, playgroup, unemployed   
 club, family night, youth clubs and   
 very many more. The cafe, run by      
 volunteers is fast becoming the social
 centre of the community.              
  One of the most significant develop- 
 ments the centre has produced is a    
 change in the attitudes of the local  
 people. There is a new spirit of enth-
 usiasm in the area. People are more   
 willing and anxious to try new things.
 They have discovered skills, abilities
 and talents that they hadn't realised 
 before.The general feeling is that the
 centre has brought about a significant
 improvement in the lives of local     
 people:"This centre is great, but it's
 not enough - let's try for more."
