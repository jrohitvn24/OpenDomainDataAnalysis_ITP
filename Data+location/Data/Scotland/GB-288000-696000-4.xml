{scape}between Alva and                
 Tillicoultry.The land was planted by  
 Sir John Erskine in the 18th century. 
 It was originally made for a{garden   
 round Alva House.The stable block     
 designed by Robert Adam can still be  
 seen and it and the 18th century Ice  
 House are the only parts of Alva House
 which remain today.                   
 It is a good place to visit because   
 there are 3 different walks.There is a
 playing area with an assault course,  
 tree house and sand pit.The Woodland  
{Park}is a good place for Birdwatchers.
 It is now cared for by Clackmannan
