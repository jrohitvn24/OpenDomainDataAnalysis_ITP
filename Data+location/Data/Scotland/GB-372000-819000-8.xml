  The block is too sparsely populated  
 to support clubs on its own. Residents
 do in some cases join groups based in 
 Inverurie.                            
  There are many groups in Inverurie   
 such as would be found in most Scots  
 towns such as WRI's and church - based
 clubs.                                
  Of special note however are a group  
 known as The Baillies of Bennachie,   
 a group of volunteers who protect the 
 local mountain which lies outside the 
 block to the north, but which visually
 dominates the area. The Baillies try  
 to control pollution and litter on the
 Bennachie hill range and to educate   
 visitors.                             
  Several block residents belong to    
 this association.
