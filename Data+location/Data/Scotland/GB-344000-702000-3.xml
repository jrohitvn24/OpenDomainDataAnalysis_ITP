		<content>  The population of the village proper 
 is 308. Many other families are housed
 in estate and farm houses within our  
 grid.  The age range at present is    
 from a few months to 100 years.  Our  
 centenarian still lives alone.        
   About 5 twelfths of the population  
 are retired (at least 30 over 80!), 3 
 twelfths are children and 4 twelfths  
 between 20 and 60.                    
   Occupations vary from cleansing     
 employees, nurses, agricultural       
 workers,chemical engineer, office     
 workers,lorry drivers and teachers. On
 the whole the only unemployed are the 
 people newly left school.             
   The village has a great mix with    
 people,in the majority,being          
 supportive and friendly.
