		<title>18Playground games,Fearn.</title>
		<content> In school,we asked pupils about their 
 playground games.The majority of boys 
 preferred playing football.As the     
 playground is small,they only have one
 goalmouth.The girls preferred games   
 like hopscotch and polo.Other games   
 that are played include               
 go-go-stop,marbles and rounders.We    
 asked pupils who played these games   
 whether they played them often and we 
 found that they were played on a daily
 basis in most cases.Marbles is        
 becoming more popular again although  
 for a while it was only a few boys who
 were interested. We used to play      
 rounders but now we can't play because
 we kept hitting the windows of the    
 school and hitting the ball out onto  
 the road.Many of the younger boys like
 taking toy cars to school to play     
 with.
