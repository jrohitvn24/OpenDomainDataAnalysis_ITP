		<title>04FARMING IN DOLPHINTON AREA</title>
		<content> One farm in Dolphinton is wholly let  
 as grazing, as a result has no        
 machinery. 6 farms have 2 tractors,   
 1 has 4 and 1 has 1. 5 own a combine  
 and 3 hire contractors to harvest the 
 grain. 3 own a silorator and 3 hire   
 contractors to cut their silage. 5    
 farms use outside contractors for     
 tasks like lime-spreading, sheep      
 shearing, turnipp-shawing and sowing  
 barley or grass-seed. Lanour on the   
 farms comprises, as well as the       
 farmers:- 9 other family members, 3   
 permanent workers, 4 part-time or     
 casual workers. 2 of the farms are    
 owner occupied, 8 are rented, 7 of    
 them from the Mackenzie family of     
 Dolphinton Estate, (which is presently
 for sale). The Estate also owns all   
 the woodland in Dolphinton. None of   
 the farmers belong to the National    
 Farmers Union.                        </content>
