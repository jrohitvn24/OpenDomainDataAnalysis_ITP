		<title>09BOTHWELL CASTLE</title>
		<content>{Bothwell Castle }is situated          
 approximately 3/4 of a mile from      
 Uddingston Cross. Access is possible  
 by road although the last 300 yards   
 must be taken on foot. The building of
 the castle began towards the end of   
 the 13th Century, and its position    
 made it extremely significant in the  
 Wars of Independence (1296 - 1328)    
 being taken repeatedly by both sides  
 and eventually being surrendered to   
 the Scots after{Bannockburn,}who      
 dismantled it. Since that time        
 building work has taken place three   
 times. At present the castle is owned 
 by Douglas Hume, but has been under   
 Government care since 1935. The castle
 has approximately 4500-5000 visitors  
 per year including many school        
 parties. Restoration work is taking   
 place at present and is hoped to be   
 completed in 2 years.                 </content>
