		<title>01MR PATE    FAIRNILEE FARM</title>
		<content> During one wednesday afternoon we went
 to Mr Pates farm and also went into   
 his house to talk. We had already     
 phoned Mr Pate for permission.        
   Mr Pate's farm is called Fairnilee  
 it is on the road to Peebles.  Mr     
 Pate has eight hundred and sixty      
 acres of land, comprised of, one      
 hundred and fifty acres of woodland,  
 two hundred acres of hill grazing     
 (rough). and five hundred and sixty   
 acres of arable land.                 
 At the farm there is a public         
 telephone and a post box.  There are  
 also four more cottages on the estate,
 two of them are rented, one to        
 a retired lady and the other to a     
 young couple and a baby.              
 On the farm there are two full time   
 and a few part time workers.  One of  
 the workers has worked there for      
 twenty-five years.                    </content>
