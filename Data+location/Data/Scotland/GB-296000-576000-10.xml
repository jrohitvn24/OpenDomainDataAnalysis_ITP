		<title>10DUMFRIES IN THE 1920's</title>
		<content> On the 17 June 1985, we went to       
 Nithbank hospital  which is for the   
 elderly.   We talked to Mrs McConville
 who is 83 years old.   She has lived  
 in Dumfries all her life, and she told
 us what it was like from the 1920's   
 onwards.                              
{LIVING CONDITIONS                     
 Mrs McConville told us that Dumfries  
 used to be a little village in the    
 country with horses and carts instead 
 of cars.   The houses were tenaments  
 in rows    and they were very small   
 and cramped.   People lived on both   
 sides of the River Nith.   Wednesdays 
 were market days and the stalls were  
 on the High Street at the Midsteeple. 
 Lots of visitors came on a Wednesday  
 to the market.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
