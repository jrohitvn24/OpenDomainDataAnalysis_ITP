		<title>09DUNBAR SEA CADETS</title>
		<content>{History}- this unit was formed in 1959
 and named after the destroyer         
 'Valient' (now a nuclear              
 submarine).The unit was recommissioned
 in 1980.                              
{A typical meeting}We wear a uniform   
 which consists of flared trousers,    
 tunic,silk ribbon lanyard, white      
 front, jumper and cap.                
    The meeting begins when we hoist   
 the flags and this is followed by     
 classes in communications, seamanship,
 or electrical engineering. We have a  
 refreshment break called 'stand easy'.
  This is followed by discussions on   
 boatwork or firefighting. The meeting 
 may end with a game of deck hockey    
 which is played with a piece of rope  
 instead of a ball. Cadets can often be
 sent to other naval bases on courses  
 to improve their skills.(Kevin
