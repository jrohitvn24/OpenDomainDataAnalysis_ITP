		<title>15DALRY RELIGION</title>
		<content> Half of Dalry's population are Church 
 members, with a committed adult       
 Christian population of over 2300.    
 The{Church of Scotland}has two        
 Churches.  St. Margaret's, whose spire
 dominates the town centre, has over   
 1700 members, with 1200 communicants. 
 Trinity's membership is about 600.    
 About 550{Roman Catholics,}with the   
 Church of St. Palladius, are served by
 an Irish priest.  There are also two  
{Gospel Halls}and a small{Episcopalian 
 Church. Relations between the Churches
 are good, with little evidence of     
 bigotry.  All come together sometimes 
 to worship in inter-church services.  
 Many organisations are linked to the  
 churches eg. women's guilds, youth    
 clubs, Boy's Brigade.                 
 Most marriages are religious services 
 and almost all funerals are conducted 
 by ministers of religion.             </content>
