		<title>06INTERVIEW: FORMER PUPILS</title>
		<content>{MEMORIES OF SCHOOL:1957               
   When Mrs. Aileen Kinnaird came to   
 this school there were only nine      
 pupils. Her best subjects were Art &amp;  
 English. At break the children would  
 play with skipping ropes,or           
 perhaps play 'housies' and schools.   
 She feels that the main differences in
 schools now is that there are more    
 varied subjects and that children now 
 have the benefit of visiting teachers.
{STOER SCHOOL: 1910                    
  Mr. Rory Mackenzie remembers having  
 to walk the two miles to{Stoer School 
{from Clashnessie}in all sorts of      
 weather. Most of the children spoke   
{Gaelic}until they came into the       
 classroom where they were required to 
 speak English. He enjoyed playing     
 football at the side of the school.   
 Now the old 'football pitch' is boggy 
 and covered with heath.               </content>
