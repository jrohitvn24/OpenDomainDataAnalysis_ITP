		<title>14Loch Fitty</title>
		<content> Loch Fitty is near the villages of    
 Lassodie &amp; Kingseat.You travel up the 
 B192 road north of the village of     
 Kingseat for a mile or so.Loch Fitty  
 is stocked full of rainbow trout.Lots 
 of people go fishing there and the    
 fish mainly go for black flies.There  
 is a small fish farm just next to the 
 loch.Visitors going to the loch can   
 buy fish pellets to feed the fish in  
 the tanks.These fish are put into the 
 loch when they are fully grown.Many   
 people go out in a boat because the   
 fish don't come very close to the     
 bank.It costs quite a lot of money to 
 fish from a boat.Every time I go I    
 usually catch about 3 or 4 pounds of  
 fish.
