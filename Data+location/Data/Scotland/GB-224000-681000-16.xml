		<content> In Clachan Road there used to be a    
 mansion called Clachan House which    
 was said to be haunted by 'The White  
 Lady'. Two elderly caretakers claimed 
 that their bed clothes were being     
 pulled off and they were finally      
 forced to move away. The White Lady   
 is said to have had an affair and her 
 enraged husband stabbed her lover and 
 then killed her before disappearing   
 himself.  She is supposed to have been
 searching for both men. The house was 
 eventually burnt down but the story   
 lives on. Another story has it that   
 the mansion was connected to the      
 vaults of the church by an underground
 passage, the entrance to which was    
 sealed off years ago.                 
   There is the grave of a freed black 
 slave in the churchyard and some      
 people fancy they have seen his ghost.
