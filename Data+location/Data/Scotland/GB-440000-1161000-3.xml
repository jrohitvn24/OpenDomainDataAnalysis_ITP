		<content> Tagon farm consists of 600 acres      
 of mainly hill land.                  
 This land is suitable for the Shetland
 sheep which are kept on the farm.There
 are about 200 sheep altogether but not
 all of these are Shetland,some        
 Cheviots and Suffolks are kept as     
 well.                                 
 The Shetland sheep is one of the      
 smallest of British breeds and is bred
 because of the softness of its wool   
 and the goodness of its mutton. It can
 live on heathery and rough grass and  
 this hardy breed can survive the cold 
 winter.They are brought down from the 
 hill in the Spring to lamb.A vigilant 
 watch is kept on the sheep at this    
 time in case there are any problems   
 with lambing.                         
 Seven cows are also kept on the farm;3
 Jerseys,2 Simmenthal Crosses,1        
 Fresian and 1 Ayreshire.              </content>
