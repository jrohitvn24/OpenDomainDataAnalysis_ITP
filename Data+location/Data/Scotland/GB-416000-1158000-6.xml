		<title>06Animal life on Papa Stour.</title>
		<content> There are no amphibians and very few  
 wild mammals on the island.Rabbits    
 abound in the sand dunes because they 
 have no natural predators.            
  There is a healthy otter population, 
 but because they are secretive animals
 their tracks rather than sightings    
 betray them.Hill mice are very        
 common as any crofter will tell you!  
  By far the richest source of animal  
 life is in the sea.Last week we found 
 30 species of animal in the rock pools
 at low tide.Pilot whales{caain whales}
 and porpoises {neesik}are a common    
 sight playing around the boats,killer 
 whales are not as common.The sea is a 
 home to mackeral,whiteing,scallops    
 crab and lobster,which are all fished 
 commercially.                         
  Grey and Common seals,{selkies},are a
 frequent sight,especially when they   
 come ashore to have their pups.       </content>
