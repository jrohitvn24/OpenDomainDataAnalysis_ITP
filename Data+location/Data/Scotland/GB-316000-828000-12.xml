		<title>12EDUCATION IN GLENLIVET</title>
		<content>   Glenlivet primary school  caters for
 children between the ages of 5 and 12.
 It is a  two  teacher school  and  has
 between  25 and 30 pupils. In the past
 year the school  has  been  modernised
 with  a  new  gym  hall,  canteen  and
 toilets   built  on.   There  are  two
 classrooms  and a resources room which
 houses  the television, video-recorder
 and  computer.  As  well  as  the  two
 regular  teachers,  visiting  teachers
 come to teach  art,  music,  P.E.  and
 home  economics.  There   is   also  a
 visiting remedial teacher to  help the
 slow learners.                        
   At the age of 12 the children travel
 by bus  to High School at Aberlour for
 their Secondary  education,  having to
 leave  home  at  8am  and returning at
 4.30pm.  The  nearest  college  is  at
 Elgin  and  there  is  a University at
 Aberdeen                              </content>
