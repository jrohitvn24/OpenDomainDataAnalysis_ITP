		<title>05HOME LIFE IN FORFAR</title>
		<content>{Food.}The Forfar{Bridie}may not be as 
 well known as an Arbroath smokie but  
 in Forfar it's the best thing since   
 sliced bread.They're loved all through
 the town and round Angus.The exact    
 formula is a secret in Forfar, but    
 many butchers and bakers make their   
 own bridies.{Recipe}The bridie        
 consists of a pastry covering with    
 chopped up beef and herbs filling to  
 make a mild hot taste. Nearly all the 
 people in Forfar have tasted a bridie 
 and for the folk who haven't, they are
 missing out the best of Forfar. People
 have their own opinion as to who makes
 the best bridies.Unlike the Arbroath  
 smokies, we in Forfar do not send our 
 bridies to other cities or towns in   
 Britain unless specially asked.The    
 bridie is similar in looks to the     
 Cornish pasty, but its taste is       
 nothing like our Forfar bridie.       </content>
