		<title>16I CHOSE TO LIVE AT HOWNAM</title>
		<content> Unlike the majority of people in the  
 Hownam area in the Scottish Borders,  
 who live here because of their jobs on
 local farms,we chose to live here.We  
 have had our house in Hownam for 13   
 years,and for most of that time we    
 used it as a holiday home.We always   
 intended to live here at some point in
 our lives,but as our 4 sons grew up,  
 it became clear that we could move    
 here sooner rather than later.It has  
 made my husbands life more difficult -
 he is an English barrister - with the 
 extra travelling  and the possibility 
 of being blocked in during the winter,
 but the benifits in terms of peaceful 
 and beautiful surroundings and a      
 slower way of life,far out-weigh the  
 difficulties.Having lived here very   
 happily for 2 years now on a permanant
 basis I know I could never willingly  
 go back to noisy city life.           </content>
