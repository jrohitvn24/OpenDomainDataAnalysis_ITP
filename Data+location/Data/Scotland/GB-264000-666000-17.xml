		<content>{  Ashcraig Secondary School,}situated 
 on a very pleasant site overlooking   
 Hogganfield Loch, is unique in that it
 is the only school in Scotland to     
 provide a conventional secondary      
 education for pupils who are either   
{physically or visually handicapped.   
 The school was opened in 1983 after 10
 years in the Ibrox area of Glasgow.   
                                       
   The school is built on one level    
 with large, bright, open areas where  
 pupils can meet between classes and at
 lunch time.  A specially designed     
 swimming pool and large, well-equipped
 games hall caters for the physical    
 education needs of the school, while a
 physiotherapy unit copes with a       
 variety of medical needs and is       
 staffed by two nurses and two         
 physiotherapists.
