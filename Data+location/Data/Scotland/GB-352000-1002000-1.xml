		<content> The area known as Toab is the SE part 
 of the parish of St Andrews, on the   
 east mainland of Orkney.   It is a    
 farming area, mainly intensively      
 farmed grassland for cattle and sheep.
   There is a mixture of small holdings
 and fairly large farms.   The high    
 areas are moorland and peat bogs.     
 These are being drained and ploughed  
 for farming.   This area has a primary
 school which serves St Andrews and    
 Deerness, a grocers shop, which opens 
 all hours, and a Post Office.   There 
 are two archaeological sites, the     
 standing stone at Stembister and      
 Dingieshowe Broch, both are at least  
 4000 years old.   St Peters pool to   
 the east is a sheltered sandy inlet   
 popular for catching Muscles and      
 Whelks.  South east is Dingieshowe Bay
 excellent for catching Lobsters.
