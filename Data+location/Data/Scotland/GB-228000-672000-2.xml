 even arrest people.                   
 The beat policemen patrol the area on 
 foot.  There is also 1 {panda car }   
 and 1 {motorbike}.There is a{police   
{box}in Aberfoyle Road.  It was built  
 in 1968.  Here the policemen can have 
 their meals and people can go there if
 they need help.

 handcuffs, a truncheon, a radio, a
