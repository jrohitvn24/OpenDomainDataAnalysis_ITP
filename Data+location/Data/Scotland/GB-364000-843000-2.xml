 There are patches of wasteland where a
 prickly plant called{Gorse}grows      
 as well as{rough grass}and{bracken.}On
 the hills you can find{hares, rabbits 
 and sometimes{deer.}There are{foxes   
 but you don't see them much. They are 
 annoying because they kill some farm  
 animals. There are many kinds of

 steal fruit from the gardens. The Crow
