     An increasing number of people    
 have reached retirement age.  A block 
 of houses has been built especially   
 for the elderly.                      
                                       
     A number of men work in the       
 forest.  With the increasing use of   
 machinery on a farm very few farmers  
 employ agricultural workers. The men  
 have then to look to Huntly or Keith  
 or even further afield for employment.
 This leads them to look for a home    
 nearer their work.                    
                                       
    Their homes are then taken over by 
 the unemployed who then move back to  
 the town when they find employment. So
 a fraction of the population always   
 seems to be on the move.              </content>
