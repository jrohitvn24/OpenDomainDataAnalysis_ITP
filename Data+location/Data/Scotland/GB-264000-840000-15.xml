		<title>15CULDUTHEL HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>   {CULDUTHEL HOSPITAL}was once the    
 private home of the Frasers of        
 Culduthel but has been used as a      
 hospital since 1930  Originally it was
 a T.B. sanatorium, but advances in the
 treatment of T.B. made it obsolete.   
 Its situation and number of individual
 rooms made it ideal for the treatment 
 of chest illnesses, infectious        
 diseases and geriatrics.              
    It is small and beautifully        
 situated in the centre of a wood.     
 There are only 40 beds at present but 
 10 more will be available when        
 renovations are complete. Patients,   
 who come from all over the{HIGHLANDS  
{AND ISLANDS}enjoy walks in the woods. 
    Unfortunately Culduthel will close 
 within the next few years as a new    
 multi_storey hospital at{RAIGMORE}    
 where staff and patients will be      
 transferred.                          </content>
