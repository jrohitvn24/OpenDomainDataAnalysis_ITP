		<title>20CLUBS - STRANRAER</title>
		<content>   There are a wide range of clubs in  
 Stranraer, from charitable groups like
 the Rotary, Round Table and Roteract  
 clubs to social and athletic clubs,   
 e.g. cycling, boxing, running,        
 golfing, angling, riding, operatic and
 drama clubs, and both amatuer and     
 professional football teams.          
  There are also youth organisations,  
 e.g. 2 Boys' Brigade companies and    
 several Girl Guides units.            
  There are also three working men's   
 clubs in the town.
