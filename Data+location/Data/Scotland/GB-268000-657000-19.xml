		<content>   The study area is situated in West  
 Central Scotland and is cut by the    
 River Clyde. The valley changes       
 dramatically in character from east to
 west, from a broad, flat, open        
 flood_plain recently reclaimed for    
 recreational use as Strathclyde       
 Country Park, to a deeper, narrower,  
 gorge_like section which, in the past,
 offered an ideal site for a water     
 powered cotton mill, and is now       
 protected as a Site of Special        
 Scientific Interest. The lands        
 bordering the river are rolling       
 lowlands (maximum height c75m) covered
 with glacial and riverine deposits of 
 clay and sand.                        
   The landscape offers variety and    
 contrast, urban and rural, industrial 
 and agricultural, old and new.
