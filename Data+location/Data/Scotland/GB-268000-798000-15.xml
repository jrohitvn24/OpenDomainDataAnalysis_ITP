		<title>15NEWTONMORE, THE VILLAGE  1</title>
		<content> The village of{Newtonmore}has 800 or  
 so inhabitants. It is situated at the 
 south end of the Spey Valley in the   
 centre of the Highlands of Scotland.  
 More than 200 years ago the river was 
 first bridged here to carry the main  
 road from the south into the Highlands
 to Inverness and eventually , at this 
 point a junction to Fort William, too 
 came into being here.                 
 The Name in Gaelic{"Bail Ur an        
{t-Sleibh",}meaning "the new township  
 on the moor" tells the story of how   
 the village came to be. The earliest  
 householders came from the older      
 townships in{Glen Banchor}above       
 Newtonmore. These families were moved 
 there by forced clearance: being only 
 tenents in the eyes of the law and the
 proprietor now  the "Clan-system" had 
 broken down. Bail Ur an t-Sleibh was a
  natural place for population growth. </content>
