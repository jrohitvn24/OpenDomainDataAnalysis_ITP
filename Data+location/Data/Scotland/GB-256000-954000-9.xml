		<content> Tongue Primary School caters for      
 children between the ages of 5 and 12 
 years. The seven classes are in two   
 groups because there are only 31 child
 ren and two teachers. The school was  
 built in 1964 ona site which overlooks
 the Kyle and from it one can see for  
 miles in all directions. Children come
 in from the village and the surround  
 ing area, up to seven miles away, each
 day, and most of them have lunch in   
 school. After Primary School the      
 children move to Secondary School 13  
 miles east, and then perhaps eventual 
 ly to the six year school on the east 
 coast where they have to stay in      
 hostels.                              
 Tongue School is bright and clean,    
 witha GP room as well as the two class
 rooms and dining room.
