		<content> Living in the country presents certain
 problems.Some people who do not own a 
 car have to use the bus service which 
 only comes four days a week.On each   
 day it only makes one trip.Most people
 use the bus to go shopping.A local    
 taxi service is provided to take      
 pupils to and from school.It also gets
 the school dinners for our school from
 Alves.Although some people use the bus
 to go shopping they use their car to  
 go to work in Elgin or Forres.The     
 people who work at the distillery     
 cycle or walk.The majority of the     
 vehicles in our area belong to the    
 Forestry Commission.Most of these     
 lorries are used to transport trees.A 
 greater percentage of the remaning    
 lorries are used by the distillery.
