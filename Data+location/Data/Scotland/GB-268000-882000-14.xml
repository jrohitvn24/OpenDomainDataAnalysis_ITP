		<title>14TRANSPORT IN EDDERTON</title>
		<content> There are several types of transport  
 in Edderton, the most common being the
{motor car.}Mosty every family in      
 Edderton has a car to get to work or  
 for pleasure.Most people consider it  
 essential to have a car in Edderton   
 because it is so remote. Lots of young
 people and a few adults have{bicycles 
 which are used mainly for leisure and 
 keeping fit.A{railway line}goes       
 through  Edderton but the{train}no    
 longer stops here.If you wish to catch
 the train you have to travel 8km to   
 the nearest railway station in        
 Tain.Three public buses travel north  
 every day except Sunday and three     
 travel south stopping in the village  
 to pick up and drop of fare paying    
 passengers.Because there is an        
 alternative and faster route to the   
 north the main road through Edderton  
 remains fairly quiet.                 </content>
