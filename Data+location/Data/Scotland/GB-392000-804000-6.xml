		<title>06OFFSHORE OIL WORKER'S FAMILY</title>
		<content> My dad works offshore now and again   
 but not very often.When he is not     
 offshore he works for a company called
 Colos.He has to repair trawlers in    
 the harbour or big machinery in       
 factories.                            
 He is never really bothered about     
 going offshore unless he is going away
 for a few months.                     
 when he returns he is normally        
 underweight from not eating the food  
 on the rig.                           
 When he is not away he has got me     
 helping service his motorbike or      
 my mums car.When he is away my        
 brother is the head of the house but  
 all he everdoes is sit on his         
 backside and watch T.V! so half the   
 time I take charge!                   
 Once when my dad was away i went to a 
 disco,I told my mum I would be back   
 at eleven but I did'nt get back until </content>
