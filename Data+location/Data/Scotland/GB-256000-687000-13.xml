		<title>13The Road out of FINTRY</title>
		<content> The{B818}running to the north of the  
 Campsie Hills connects with the{A875} 
 and forms a main route out of the     
 village to Glasgow.                   
                                       
 For most of the year it is a          
 reasonably quiet alternative to the   
{Crow Road}which connects Fintry to    
 Lennoxtown and so to Glasgow.         
                                       
 During the relatively short times when
 heavy snowfalls occur, the{B818}can   
 become the only way in and out of the 
 village. Happily such times are rare, 
 but when it happens, the road cut by  
 snow ploughs can be transformed,      
 from a quiet summer drive to something
 more akin to the stage set for the Ice
 Maiden. At such times, unless you live
 here or have important business here, 
 stay away, for you could find yourself
 in Fintry overnight!                  </content>
