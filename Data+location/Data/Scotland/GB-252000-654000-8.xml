		<title>08HEALTH IN NEWTON MEARNS</title>
		<content>   There is no Health Centre in Newton 
 Mearns but there are three GP         
 surgeries. There is one small NHS     
 hospital at Mearnskirk which has      
 changed its function several times    
 having been a sanatorium, an armed    
 forces hospital, an orthopaedic,      
 cardiac and ENT centre, and now for   
 Geriatrics and convalescence. There is
 now a possibility of it again becoming
 an orthopaedic hospital.              
                                       
   Many people in Newton Mearns        
 subscribe to Private Health care      
 schemes eg BUPA and would use private 
 wards in NHS hospitals or go to       
 completely private hospitals. There   
 are however none of these in this     
 area.
