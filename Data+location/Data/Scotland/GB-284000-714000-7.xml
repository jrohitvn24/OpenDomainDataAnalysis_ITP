  {Muthill - a good life ?}            
 In our sample only{8}people had lived 
 here less than a year,{42}between 1   
 and 10 years,{25}between 11 and 30    
 years and{20}for over 30 years. When  
 asked "What do you like best about    
 Muthill?" most people found that it   
 was a fairly  quiet, but very friendly
 community, in a good position both for
 rural activities and for travelling to
 larger centres (Edinburgh, Glasgow,   
 Stirling). Its beautiful surroundings 
 and countryside joys were often       
 stressed.{Improvements }suggested were
{1}Speed limit strictly enforced.{2}   
 Repairs to pavements.{3}Return of     
 village policeman.{4}More activities  
 for younger people, especially tennis 
 courts.{5}A lack of adequate bus      
 transport is felt especially by the   
 young and the elderly.                </content>
