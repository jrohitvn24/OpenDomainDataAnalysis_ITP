		<content> There is a predominance of old houses.
 Many of these were built before 1900  
 and some are well over a hundred years
 old.Recently the village was          
 designated a conservation area,this   
 brought many advantages eg.house      
 owners were eligible for generous     
 "home improvement" grants.This has    
 meant a steady up-grading of many of  
 the old properties.
