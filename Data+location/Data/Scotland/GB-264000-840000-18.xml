		<content>    We decided to do a survey of about 
 70 houses in the neighbourhood to find
 out what kind of people lived there   
 and what they would most like to see  
 being improved. About half of the     
 houses had no one in. The rest were   
 evenly divided between people who had 
 young children and those whose        
 families were grown up.               
    The people with grown up families  
 were quite happy and did not want many
 changes. The others with younger      
 children suggested more shops to      
 include a chemist, better playing     
 areas for young children and a        
 football ground for older boys and    
 girls. A church was also mentioned by 
 two people.                           
    Most people were, on the whole,    
 pleased to live in these lovely       
 estates.                              
                                       </content>
