		<title>03LAND USE _ FORESTRY</title>
		<content>    This area is the more mature part  
 of the forest.  The land in was bought
 by the forestry commission in 1926    
 having been previously owned by the   
 Lairds of Pitfour _ the Fergusons.    
    The first plantings took place in  
 1930.  The trees being the Sitka      
 Spruce from Alaska.  Apparently these 
 are well_suited to exposure, and, in  
 particular are most resistant to the  
 prevailing wind which is westerly and 
 causing most damage.  Minor species of
 trees which have followed the first   
 plantings are the Norway Spruce,      
 Japanese Larch and the Lodgepoll Pine 
 (American).  The Sitka Spruce reaches 
 maturity after fifty years.  The first
 fellings were in the 1970's. After two
 years more trees are planted and the  
 mature trees are felled leaving room  
 for future planting. This is the usual
 pattern of rotation.                  </content>
