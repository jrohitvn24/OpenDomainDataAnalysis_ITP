		<content> Through the village of Hill of Beath  
 runs a local bus service from         
 Dunfermline to Ballingry.Usually      
 double-decker buses run on this route 
 at 15-20min. intervals.This bus       
 travels up Main Street and then along 
 Woodend Place and then onto           
 Cowdenbeath.People can also catch     
 buses to Edinburgh and Kirkcaldy on   
 the A910 road just to the S.E. of Hill
 of Beath.There is a railway station in
 the centre of Cowdenbeath with        
 services to Edinburgh but many of the 
 services have been cut in the past few
 years.The train stops at              
 Dunfermline,Rosyth,Inverkeithing,North
 Queensferry and Dalmeny on it's route.
