		<title>01Loch Inbuair, Glendouchart</title>
		<content> this block consists mainly of hill    
 land which is farmed for sheep.  A few
 cattle are kept on the low ground.    
 There is a little forestry, mainly in 
 the form of shelter-belts with a few  
 plantations.  Loch Inbuair (Loch of   
 the yew trees) is a prominent beauty  
 spot which is much admired in summer  
 there is also fishing for salon and   
 trount in its waters.  At the east end
 of the Loch is a Picnic area and a    
 small nature trial.  The narrows at   
 the east end of the Loch are liable to
 flooding after heavy rain and the road
 may be closed by flooding in winter.  
 This will change over the next year   
 when the road is re-reouted onto the  
 course of the old Callander-Oban      
 railway.
