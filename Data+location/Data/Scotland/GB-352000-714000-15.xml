		<title>15FARMING : Arable crops</title>
		<content> The crops grown on Easter Balrymonth  
 farm are sold, often at a set price,to
 various wholesalers. Peas grown and   
 harvested as part of a co-operative   
 are packaged and sold as freezer      
 peas. The oil seed rape goes to       
 make cooking oil and margarine. Some  
 barley grown on the farm goes for     
 malting and the rest for the feeding  
 of livestock. Similarly,wheat goes for
 milling and animal feed. The acreage  
 under potatoes is strictly limited by 
 quotas and there is a heavy fine if   
 the limit is exceeded. The barley is  
 the crop best suited to the soil in   
 this area and now winter barley is    
 being grown more than in previous     
 years.This has come about with the aid
 of chemicals used on the crop and     
 better varieties of seed. The market  
 price is currently dropping for many  
 crops because of surpluses.           </content>
