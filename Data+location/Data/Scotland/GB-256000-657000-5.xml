		<title>05CASTLEMILK</title>
		<content>{Castlemilk}is a new housing area in{  
{Glasgow}.Although it is about the size
 of Perth it is very poorly served by  
 amenities like Pubs,Cinemas etc       
 There is a tremendous amount of{      
{unemployment}in Castlemilk; Children  
 see their parents with apparantly no  
 hope of a job _ and they know it's    
 hardly likely they will get one       
 either.This disenchantment leads to   
 frustration and the frustration leads 
 to{VANDALISM}and{VIOLENCE}.           
 Not much thought went into the design 
 of the houses,and the surroundings are
 dismal and depressing.There is broken 
 glass,litter and boarded_up shop      
 windows all around .                  
 While we were doing our Domesday      
 Survey we watched 2 men lean a ladder 
 against a wall and scrawl{graffiti}all
 over it. Nobody took any notice!
