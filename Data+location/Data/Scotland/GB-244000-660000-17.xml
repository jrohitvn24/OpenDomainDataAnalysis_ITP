		<title>17GLENIFFER BRAES COUNTRY PARK</title>
		<content> The park employs 3 gardeners and 2    
 Rangers and we asked one of them, Mrs 
 Hoey to tell us more about the park.  
 The area is an ancient lava flow      
 overlying sandstone. There are 2      
 quarries in the park, but that is the 
 only industry. The park is well used  
 for leisure and has regular visits    
 from schools. There is a 30 foot high 
 waterfall in the park but it is not   
 always in full flow because the stream
 that feeds it is the overflow from a  
 reservoir further upstream.           
 Brownside Farm belongs to the Lamont  
 family but unfortuneately they moved  
 out a couple of months ago. The       
 council is taking it over and they are
 going to make it into a study centre  
 for the park. Some of the land may    
 also be taken over by the golf course.
 Mrs Howie also told us that the park  
 is now well used for orienteering.    </content>
