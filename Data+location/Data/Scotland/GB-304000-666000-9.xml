		<content> Livingston has many sports facilities 
 aside from the Community Schools and  
 Craigswood.  A very popular Summer    
 activity is bowls, this is enjoyed by 
 all agegroups and can be played at one
 of the many "greens" around the town. 
 Often found next to the bowling greens
 are tennis courts and putting greens. 
 Livingston also has an excellent 18   
 hole golf course and there is a 9 hole
 pitch-and-putt under construction.    
 For the less energetic there is the   
 Livingston Snooker Centre which is    
 equiped with 20 full-sized tables.    
 One of the most popular sports for    
 youngsters is BMX-ing.  Scores of     
 young people use the BMX track and the
 Skatepark for racing and practising   
 stunts and tricks.
