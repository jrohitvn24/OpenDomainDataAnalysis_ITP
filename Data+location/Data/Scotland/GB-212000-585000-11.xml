		<title>11Colmonell Covenanters</title>
		<content> Three Covenanter graves are said to   
 lie in the local churchyard.The most  
 prominent of these is the grave of    
 Matthew McIlwraith.                   
 Matthew was the son of a local farmer 
 at nearby Barrhill who was courting a 
 Miss McEwan of Barbour farm.While     
 Matthew and the McEwan family were    
 worshiping one night in Barbour they  
 were surrounded by Dragoons.Matthew   
 escaped and was chased to Dangart,    
 where he was wounded and later shot.  
 Two young women found the body and    
 transported it to Colmonell churchyard
 where they buried it where it lies to 
 this day.                             
 In the hills to the south of the      
 village on the banks of the Tig stands
 an outcrop of rock known as Pedens    
 Pulpit where the famous Covenanter was
 said to have preached.
