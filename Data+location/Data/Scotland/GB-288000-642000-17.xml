		<content>{Housing}in {Lanark}is quite varied    
 with a mixture of privately owned     
 houses and {Council Houses.}Generally 
 speaking {Lanark }is a sought after   
 place for people to live,therefore the
 property prices tend to be high.Also {
{Lanark}is within commuting distance of
 Glasgow.{Lanark}is also a desirable   
 place for a person wanting a {Council 
{House} as the stock of houses is good 
 and there are few slum properties.    
 The relative absence of widespread    
 vandalism is another attraction.During
 the past decade there have been quite 
 a few private houses built,but few    
 additions to the {Council House }     
 stock. A recent development has been  
 the construction of Sheltered Housing 
 by the {District Council}.Historically
 some of the houses in {Lanark }are    
 of merit especially in Hope Street.
