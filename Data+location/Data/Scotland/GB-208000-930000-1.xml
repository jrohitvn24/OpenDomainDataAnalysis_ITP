		<title>01Hills/Lochs West of Drumbeg</title>
		<content> This area to the west of Drumbeg      
 comprises undulating hills and many   
 inland lochs. The land is covered by  
 heather and bracken, except for the   
 many rocky outcrops and a few patches 
 of deciduous bushes and small trees.  
 The only habitation is in about ten   
 cottages (including two newly         
 completed)alongside the only road     
 which runs east/west throughthe area. 
 A green track runs south 1 1/2 miles  
 from the road to old peat workings .  
 There are good views from the hills.In
 the area across the lochs and hills to
 prominent features beyond, namely, the
 off-shore islands and open seas to the
 north, the mountains of Suilven and   
 Canisp to the south and Quinag to the 
 east. The only significant use of the 
 land is for sheep grazing. the lochs  
 are used by red and black-throated    
 divers in the breeding season         </content>
