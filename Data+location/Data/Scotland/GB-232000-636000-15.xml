		<content> At{6.50}my friend Laura arrives, we   
 both then leave and make our way to   
 where the Guides are held. The Guides 
 begin at{7.00.}We begin with          
 collecting the 25p we pay each week,  
 then we go into Patrol corners to do  
 the work patrol leaders set. As I am a
 patrol leader, throughout every week I
 have to find things to entertain my   
 patrol, sometimes we have things like 
 crosswords,collage,keep fit,games or  
 beetle drives set for them. After that
 the whole pack,company, do something  
 together like a treasure hunt, game,  
 nature trail or sports. Later we do   
 work for trefoil badges or interest   
 badges. That usually takes us to{9.00 
 when our guides finish. On arriving   
 home I change into my night clothes   
 and have my supper, I watch T.V.while 
 I eat supper, then go to bed and read 
 for a short time.                     </content>
