		<title>06    LOCH OF LIFF FARM</title>
		<content> This area contains mainly farmland    
 although there is a small patch of    
 woodland.This woodland is mainly      
 deciduous with some conifers and      
 belongs to a wood called Backmuir     
 Wood.                                 
   Loch of Liff Farm is mainly a crop  
 growing farm although it sometimes    
 winters cattle and sheep.The crops    
 grown are mainly potatoes, flax,      
 turnips, barley and oats.The land     
 around the farm is suitable for       
 growing fruit but this is not done    
 because of its altitude.              
   At the extreme North end of this    
 block, set just back from the A923    
 Dundee-Coupar Angus Trunk Road there  
 are small farms. These grow mainly    
 soft fruits such as raspberries and   
 strawberries.
