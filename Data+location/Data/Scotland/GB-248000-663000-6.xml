		<title>06UNEMPLOYMENT - PAISLEY</title>
		<content> Within our block there is a great deal
 of unemployment. This has been a      
 problem now for many years due to     
 closure of the car factory in nearby  
 Linwood and declining shipbuilding    
 on the lower reaches of the River     
 Clyde. Many adult men have been       
 unemployed for more than 2 years;     
 except in the case of a few who have  
 managed to work short term in a       
 shipyard constructing oil rigs for the
 North Sea. For the most part the men  
 who have worked in the above          
 industries are mainly unemployed,     
 passing the long day housebound or in 
 town looking for another job, which   
 is not there.                         
   A neighbour of mine who does not    
 wish to be named is unfortunately     
 unemployed and gave me these facts.   
 He says being unemployed is very      
 hard for himself and for his family.  </content>
