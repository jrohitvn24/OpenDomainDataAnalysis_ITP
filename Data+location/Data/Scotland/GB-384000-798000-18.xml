		<content> The greater part of the land here     
 belonged from 1187-1548 to the Knights
 Templar. These were men of noble birth
 pledged to escort Christian pilgrims. 
 They vowed obedience, chastity,       
 poverty. They wore a white cloak      
 adorned with an 8 pointed red cross to
 remind them of the 8 Beatitudes. After
 becoming too powerful they were       
 abolished by the Pope. The Templars   
 had a Preceptory in Maryculter and    
 traces of their presence are seen in  
 local place names. Some rare plants,  
 said to have been used by them as     
 medicines have been found.They took   
 great care of their estates: monks    
 supervised the farming. Each tenant   
 had a portion of different soils so   
 that no one would have totally bad    
 land. Their standard of living was    
 higher than usual for those times.
