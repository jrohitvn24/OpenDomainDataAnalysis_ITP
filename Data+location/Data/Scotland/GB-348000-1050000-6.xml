		<title>06Education in Papa Westray</title>
		<content> Primary school education is provided  
 for ages 5 to 12 years on the island  
 in a small single teacher school,     
 though there are specialist teachers  
 in Music, Art and Physical            
 Education,who come at intervals for   
 the day from Kirkwall on the inter    
 island plane. The school building is  
 also one of the island's venues for   
 community events.                     
 At age 12 the children go by boat     
 daily to the neighbouring, larger     
 island of Westray to the Junior       
 Secondary School. After two years they
 can choose to transfer to Kirkwall    
 Grammar School to complete their      
 secondary education. While attending  
 Kirkwall Grammar School they stay in  
 the school hostel and are provided    
 with transport home one weekend in    
 four.
