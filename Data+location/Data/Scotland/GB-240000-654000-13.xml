		<content>     Uplawmoor Youth Club is open to   
 boys and girls of 12 years or at      
 secondary school.There are 60 members 
 and every Thursday evening some 50 of 
 them come to the club.                
     We have a pool table, dartboard,  
 board games, ball games, netball      
 stands and many other items of        
 equipment.                            
     The Club bought their own disco   
 unit in 1983 and we run many discos   
 which everyone really enjoys. The     
 disco unit also acts as a means of    
 fund-raising and has been hired out   
 for parties and discos in the village.
     The Club has many competitions and
 demonstration evenings.               
     Every year we have a bus trip and 
 have even been to Blackpool twice.    
     Enthusiastic teenagers find it a  
 happy place to meet and chat.
