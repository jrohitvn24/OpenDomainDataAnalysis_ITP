		<title>01The Village of New Deer</title>
		<content>   The bulk of the village consists of 
 houses and byres along each side of   
 the 1km Main St/High St which was a   
{"Model Village"}constructed by its    
 principal landlord, probably in the   
 17th century. Behind each property are
 small fields which belonged to these  
 crofts. The sight of cattle being     
 driven down High St each day finally  
 disappeared in the late 70's.         
   Fordyce Terrace (named after the    
 lairds of Brucklay),is the main road  
 from Maud and connects Main St to the 
 junction with the Turriff-Aberdeen    
 road which, together with Gladstone   
 Terr and Kirkbrae Terr, is a remnant  
 of the older village of{Auchreddie,   
 remembered in the names of streets and
 local farms. Newer houses are to be   
 found near the park at the Eastern end
 of the village and on individual sites
 round about.                          </content>
