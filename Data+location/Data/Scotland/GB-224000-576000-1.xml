		<content> All squares in this block are under   
 afforestation except 2,4, &amp; 8.   One  
 third of block 7 is privately owned   
 commercial forestry the rest being    
 forrestry commission.  Half of block  
 10 is privately owned and the other   
 half is again F.C owned.  All of      
 blocks 11 &amp; 12 are privarely owned    
 forestry.  This ground is much more   
 fertile ground than the block due west
 of it.   The trees therefore are      
 growing very rapidly and most of the  
 ground is a thicket stage (private &amp;  
 state).  The ground that is not       
 afforested is a very successful sheep 
 farm called Knockycoid Farm.  The same
 family have farmed this area for      
 generations.   Two lochs are to be    
 found in square 9 which are owned by  
 forestry commission; however; the     
 water is fished &amp; restocked regularly 
 by Barrhill Angling Club.  Peaty Gley </content>
