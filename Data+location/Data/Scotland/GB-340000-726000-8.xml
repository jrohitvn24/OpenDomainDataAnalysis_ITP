   A new pub is being built in Wormit  
 despite objections from some people   
 who thought it would be undesirable.  
 Most adults think that building a pub 
 is a good idea because it means that  
 they can get together socially without
 having to drive anywhere. However, the
 children disagree for they would have 
 liked a BMX track instead.            
   There is some pressure to have a new
 rail halt built at Wormit but others  
 don't like the idea, saying that the  
 money could be put to better use.     
   New houses are developing all over  
 Wormit. The majority of people think  
 this is a good idea for it will bring 
 more people and possibly more trade to
 the Newport area. However, some do    
 think that the land should be used for
 children's play areas.
