		<content> There are seven children in           
 Kilchrenan Primary School and their   
 parents' occupations are a good       
 indication of the variety of          
 employment in this community.         
  Katrina's dad is a farmer and her mum
 is a home-help and a part-time        
 barmaid. Dougie's dad is a farmer and 
 his mum is a housewife and does school
 transport. Lorne's dad works with the 
 Hydro-Electric Board and his mum is a 
 housewife. David's dad is a security  
 officer and his mum is our teacher.   
 Dominic's gramp is a shepherd and his 
 mum is a housekeeper. Liam's dad works
 in life insurance and his mum runs a  
 guest house. Arran's dad works for the
 Forestry Commission and his mum is the
 manageress of the community co-op.    
  Three of the fathers have to travel  
 approximately 100 miles to their      
 work, which is not unusual here.      </content>
