		<title>03VISIT TO CENSUS OFFICE</title>
		<content> A group of children from our class    
 went to visit the Census Office in    
 Corstorphine.  We had to wear special 
 visitors' badges and we were told how 
 all the information is gathered for   
 the Government and that it is very    
 confidential.  Every household in the 
 land must complete a form on Census   
 night (every ten years) and the       
 country is divided up into districts. 
 People called enumerators go round all
 the buildings to give out and later   
 collect all the forms and finally all 
 the information on the forms is turned
 into statistics.  No names or         
 addresses are associated with the     
 information when it is published and  
 the Census forms are kept secret for  
 about 100 years.  The information is  
 important for planning schools,       
 housing, public transport, and health 
 and welfare programmes.               </content>
