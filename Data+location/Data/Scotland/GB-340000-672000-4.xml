 OLD PARISH CHURCH - This is one of the
 oldest churches in East Lothian dating
 back to the 12th century.The present  
 church was constructed to a great     
 extent  out of the old and built  in  
 part on its foundations in 1801.It    
 also records one of the earliest      
 sabbath schools.Entries in the session
 book show that Mr.Paisley the then    
 schoolmaster held classes as early as 
 1788.After the battle of Prestonpans  
 in 1745,Colonel Gardiner was taken to 
 the manse where he later died of his  
 wounds.It is reputed that he still    
 haunts the manse.
