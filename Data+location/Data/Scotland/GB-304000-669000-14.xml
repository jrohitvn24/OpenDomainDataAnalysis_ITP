		<title>14KNIGHTSRIDGE GALA DAY</title>
		<content>   The Knightsridge Gala Day is a big  
 occasion for many people. This year   
 was very important to my friend as she
 was Gala Queen. The Gala this year was
 held on June 22nd at the big football 
 pitch. It was a damp, grey day but    
 this did not stop us from enjoying    
 ourselves. The fun started with a     
 parade leaving from the north side of 
 Knightsridge and travelling to the    
 family centre. A shire horse pulling a
 cart led the way and this was followed
 by a large car with the gala Queen    
 and her entourage. Behind them came   
 Scouts, Girl Guides, Brownies, and    
 representatives from various other    
 organisations in the area. When the   
 parade had arrived at the centre the  
 Queen was crowned and then the real   
 fun started. We had races and novelty 
 games, competitions and there were    
 stalls to buy from. It was a great day</content>
