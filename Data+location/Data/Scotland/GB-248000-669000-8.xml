		<content>     In the last {40 years} the leisure
 provision for teenagers in {CLYDEBANK}
 has fallen. In the{1930s}Clydebank had
 a very modern swimming pool but,      
 through lack of modernisation, this is
 now deteriorating. In the same way,the
 number of local{cinemas}and{dance     
{halls}has dropped to zero.            
     Young people in the town today    
 have to travel outwith Clydebank to   
 find such leisure activities.         
     Although Clydebank provides more  
{sports clubs}and{youth clubs,}this    
 does not help everybody as not        
 everyone enjoys these activities.     
    For older people there has been    
 less change, but still a lack of      
 improvement. The most commonly used   
 facility is{Bowling}as it was in the  
 1930s.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
