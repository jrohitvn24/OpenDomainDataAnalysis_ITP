		<title>10Gardens</title>
		<content> 90% of the people interviewed have    
 gardens.Most of them have flowers and 
 lawn and grow fruit and veg.Nobody is 
 self_sufficient in fruit and          
 vegetables although some people are   
 working towards it.Mostly everybody   
 uses farm manure but many also use    
 artifical fertiliser.Most people use  
 modern pesticides,a few use modern    
 herbicides,but very few use modern    
 fungicides.Only the odd one or two use
 their own natural remedies.The        
 vegetables that are grown most are    
 lettuce,cabbages,potatoes,carrots and 
 onions.The fruits grown are mostly    
 strawberries,gooseberries,apples and  
 rhubarb.After four years the school   
 has a garden which grows trees and    
 flowers.Wild life now thrives with    
 bluetits nesting in our bird_box for  
 the first time ever.This year we      
 planted a hanging basket &amp; patio tubs.</content>
