		<title>01     GENERAL REFERENCE</title>
		<content> In order to put our D-Block into some 
 perspective we have decided to start  
 our first page with a general         
 reference to the whole Area,Where it  
 is situated and the type of life one  
 would expect to see here.             
    The area is just outside the city  
 of Dundee approx. 9km to the NW of the
 city.It is mainly an agricultural     
 area consisting of many small and     
 reasonably sized farms.               
    The farms vary in their purpose    
 from mixed farming through to         
 sheep,cattle and even poultry.        
    The specific land cover will be    
 outlined in future pages but it may be
 sufficient to say that the land is    
 sparsely populated with one or two    
 areas more populated than others.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
