		<title>04THE EAST CHURCH &amp; MANSE</title>
		<content> The East Church is situated at the    
 east of {Lady Village.}It is one of   
 the two churches in Sanday. The church
 is closed from January to April. From 
 April to June services are held weekly
 while from July to December services  
 are held fortnightly.                 
                                       
 The{spire}of the church is badly{in   
{need of repair;}scaffolding surrounds 
 it but costs are prohibitive. This    
 year the{manse}has been{renovated.    
 Workmen have put on a new roof and    
 fitted new double glazed windows. All 
 the rooms have been re-decorated by   
 members of the congregation.          
                                       
 The{church has been vacant for        
{two years;}the redecoration, it is    
 hoped, will encourage a minister to   
 come and fill the vacancy.
