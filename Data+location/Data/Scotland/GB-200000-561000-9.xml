		<title>09THE CHILDREN OF LESWALT</title>
		<content> The child of 1985 is largerly the     
 product of the mass media and it      
 becomes ever more difficult to decide 
 nationality or, often, sex at a       
 glance.  Fortunately, the countryside 
 of parent or grandparent has still    
 considerable influence.  Field, tree  
 and stream, tree-house, tadpole and   
 trout play a large part in the life of
 the village child.  Street games      
 survive.  Hop-scotch and skipping, tag
 and hide-and-seek, marbles, roller    
 skates and biycles, football, netball 
 and hockey in season.  Local accent in
 speech is still very evident, the     
 Scot's tongue with the back-ward 'L'  
 of the Irish, and odd words, as 'ocht'
 - something or anything, peculiar to  
 the area.  In dress we are universal. 
 The full school uniform survives but  
 outside school it is blue jeans and   
 T-shirt.                              </content>
