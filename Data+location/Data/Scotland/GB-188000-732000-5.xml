		<content> In 1970 the Scottish Marine Biological
 Association came to Dunbeg from       
 Millport where this science of the sea
 began about 100 years ago.The Dunbeg  
 site which was an old war camp was    
 ideal for several reasons_central     
 position for carrying out work round  
 islands,superb anchorage,welcomng     
 landowner,housing available,etc.      
 There is a staff of 90,half of whom   
 are scientists.There are 9 divers. On 
 the site there is a caretaker's       
 house,research laboratories,wood/metal
 workshops,conference room,12 room     
 hostel,canteen,reference library,     
 computer room,etc.                    
 A major programme of work has been    
 carried out at Rockall over the last  
 15 years.The boats which are used come
 in to the floating pontoon pier which 
 is connected by metal ramp to land.
