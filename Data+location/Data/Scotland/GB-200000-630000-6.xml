		<title>06HOUSING IN LAMLASH SOUTH.</title>
		<content>      Following the road South you     
 become aware of the change in age of  
 the buildings here being considerably 
 younger than the previous ones.The end
 of the housing areas starts at Cordon 
 just off the main road,almost being a 
 small settlement on its own consisting
 of small cottages.While further on the
 last two housing areas begin called   
 Murray Estate and Murray Cresent on   
 the either side of the road.Murray    
 Estate runs along the road with all   
 its houses facing the road, while     
 Murray Cresent on the other hand is a 
 very modern housing estate consisting 
 of small bungaloes.
