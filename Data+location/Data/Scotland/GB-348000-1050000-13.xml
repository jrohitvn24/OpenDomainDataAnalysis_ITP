		<title>13 Crafts ; Papa Westray</title>
		<content> Straw work, including the making of   
 Orkney Chairs is a traditional craft  
 in Papa Westray, passed from father to
 son. The black oat straw is first     
 washed then sewn together in bundles. 
 On average it takes two days to make  
 the back in a ladies chair and about a
 week for a man's chair.               
      Traditionally the frame was made 
 of driftwood but nowadays the chair   
 maker buys the ready made frame and   
 then adds the back. Other items such  
 as baskets and table mats are also    
 made of straw.                        
      Spinning was done by the         
 womenfolk but very little spinning is 
 done today though there are still     
 spinning wheels in some houses.       
      Many women knit by hand or       
 machine.
