  Tinwald Parish Childrens' Committee  
 has been running since approximiately 
 1950. It was set up as a means of     
 raising money in order to treat the   
 children of the Parish to a Hallowe'en
 Party, a Christmas Party, and a Summer
 Outing. The latter have included      
 trips to Ae Forest,Butlins,the Magnum 
 Sports Centre (Irvine,Ayrshire ) and  
 the Lowther Wildlife Park.Meetings are
 held approximately five times a year  
 with an Annual General meeting in     
 September.                            
  The committee consists of seven      
 people with Mr.W.Gordon "Windon",     
 Sheildhill Road,Lockerbie as Chairman.
