		<title>13LOCAL INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> One of the most important industries  
 in this area is William Grant and Sons
 Ltd. We wrote to them asking them to  
 give us some information on the firm  
 and these are some of the details they
 supplied us with.                     
 There are 203 people working there as 
 hourly paid production staff and 109  
 salaried administrative staff. The    
 factory, in Glenburn, is a bottling   
 warehouse for Grants Standfast Scotch 
 Whisky. The export department at the  
 factory deals with orders from all    
 over the world and some of the other  
 popular products exported from here   
 are Glenfiddich Malt Whisky and       
 Balvenie Gin and Vodka.               
 It is a very important factory because
 it provides employment for a lot of   
 local people in an area where there   
 are few factories left.
