		<content>  Cows, ponies and sheep are kept.     
 However sheep are the most important. 
 Shetland Ponies are often transported 
 out of the area to mainland Britain   
 via Lerwick for children's horses.    
  Lambing time is the busiest time of  
 the year for all the farmers/crofters.
 It may start as early as January but  
 usually occurs between April and June.
 Lambing is late in Sumburgh due to the
 severe winter weather. Later in the   
 year the sheep have to be sheared,    
 still traditionally done by hand. In  
 late summer the sheep are dipped to   
 get rid of unwanted pests.            
  Crofting is a tradition, and the same
 piece of land has often been in the   
 one family for generations. Some      
 practices are purely local to         
 Sumburgh.
