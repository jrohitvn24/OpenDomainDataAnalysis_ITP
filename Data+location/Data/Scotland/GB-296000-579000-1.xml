{HEATHHALL - LOCHARBRIGGS - KIRKTON    
 GRID REF:02960579   AREA 12 SQ.KM.    
{TYPE OF LANDSCAPE                     
 In the West landscape is flat near    
 the{River Nith,}which is wide and     
 meandering.The floodplain in this area
 regularly floods during periods of    
 heavy rain in winter.In this western  
 part,most of the land is farmland     
 but is used for grazing.              
 In the central area eg,near{Kirkton   
 is hilly,not large hills caused by    
 gravel and debris from the glaciers   
 The land has some problems like poor  
 drainage in parts of unused land.Most 
 of this land is farmland made up of   
 crops other than grassland.This       
 central part also has a small village 
 called Kirkton which has 3 or 4 minor 
 roads leading to it.
