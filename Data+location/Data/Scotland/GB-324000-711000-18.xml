		<content> Auchtermuchty is renowned for its     
 thatched roof cottages because they   
 are a relatively uncommon feature in  
 Scotland. The reason for the thatching
 was the presence of reef beds in the  
 River Tay which is to the north of    
 Auchtermuchty. These reeds were       
 suitable for use in thatching and the 
 old traditional craft was practiced in
 Auchtermuchty. On the eastern side of 
 Auchtermuchty, in our D_Block only two
 cottages remain thatched. The cost of 
 re_thatching and high rates for       
 insurance (high fire risk) are        
 prohibitive factors in maintaining the
 thatch in a suitable condition.
