		<title>04FISH FARMING</title>
		<content> The{North East Fife Fishfarm}in{Ceres 
 was started in{1977}and was selling   
 fish in{1978.}The business was open   
 some years but has temporarily closed.
 The farm is situated in a field behind
 the owners garden.There are{5 ponds   
 each holding{5500 fish}also{8 tanks   
 for young fish.The fish bred were     
{Rainbow Trout}because these fish      
 survive in cold temperature and also  
 grow faster than{Brown Trout.}It takes
{18 months}for the fish to mature.The  
 fish were sold to various{hotels,     
{angling clubs,shops and farm gate     
{customers.}Problems found in running  
 the farm were lack of sufficient      
 markets and thieves.The owner is      
 thinking of opening again and has 200 
 trout from original farming.{However  
{Ceres is not ideal for fish farming   
{because there is no gravity water.
