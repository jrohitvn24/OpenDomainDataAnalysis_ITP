		<title>06WHINNYHALL FARM - STOCK : 1</title>
		<content>{Whinnyhall Farm}is an example of a    
{mixed farm}from this area. The farm is
 about 70 hectares in size and includes
 the land which formerly belonged to   
 Parknook Farm.                        
                                       
 It is owned by Mr W. Quinn who has    
 farmed the land at Whinnyhall since   
 1966 when he bought the land from the 
 National Coal Board who had previously
 let the land to a tenant farmer.      
 Before 1966, the farm operated as a   
 dairy farm, but since then it has been
 run as a mixed farm.                  
                                       
{STOCK - Cattle}- 120 dairy replacement
 heifers are kept on the farm. Every   
 year 40 calves are bought at Lanark   
 and they are reared on the farm for 3 
 years, after which they are sold to   
 English dealers as replacement stock  
 for dairy herds.                      </content>
