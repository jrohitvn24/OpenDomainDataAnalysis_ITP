 The Lochalsh block lies on the north  
 and south banks at the head of Loch   
 Alsh where it meets the outflow from  
 Loch Duich and Loch Long.The block is 
 dissected by the Inverness to Kyle    
 of Lochalsh road.There are four small 
 communities in the block.Auchtertyre  
 is the biggest and has a primary      
 school.The three others,Avernish,     
 Nostie and Ardelve were formally      
 fishing villages.Tourism is important 
 as many of the houses now are being   
 used as holiday homes.There is a      
 caravan site and most of the occupied 
 houses take bed and breakfast.At the  
 western end of the block the Loch     
 Duich Hotel has a commanding position.
 The area has been populated for many  
 centuries and the most important      
 historical site is a Broch which was  
 built in Viking times.                </content>
