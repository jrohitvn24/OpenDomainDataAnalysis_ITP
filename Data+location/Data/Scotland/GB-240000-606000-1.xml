		<content> This is a windswept upland area,      
 formerly almost entirely comprising   
 rough grazing, but radically changed  
 from 1980-85 by the afforestation of  
 the western parts of Sitka spruce, an 
 exotic conifer species from canada.   
 The young forest still looks like     
 overgrown and unused grazing land as  
 no trees are yet more than two metres 
 high. The eastern half of the block is
 still dominated by rough grazing land 
 which supports black face sheep and   
 some 'store'cattle in the summer. Wire
 fences have replaced dykes and hedges 
 for stock control and broadleaf trees 
 are becoming scarcer aroud Kiers Farm.
 Waterside suffers high unemployment   
 and has a largely aged population. The
 old slag heaps of a former iron works 
 are curetnly being landscaped into    
 more pleasing shapes and reseeded with
 grass. Te railway sidings are used    </content>
