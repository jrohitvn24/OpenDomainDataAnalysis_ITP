		<content> There has been a school on the present
 site in Keig since 1862. It has been  
 modernised several times and was      
 rebuilt in 1963. The old combined     
 primary and secondary school          
 disappeared and in its placee arose a 
 fine modern well appointed primary    
 school. There are 2 classrooms, a     
 hall/general purposes room with well  
 appointed stage.  There are also a    
 staff room, indoor toilets and meals  
 servery, the meals being carried in   
 keep hot containers from the new      
 kitchens at Alford Academy.           
 There were 29 pupils in 1970, rising  
 to 53 in 1974 and  the roll has now   
 fallen to 18 - 2 short of the figure  
 which would re-instate a second       
 teacher, lost in 1981 when for 2      
 months the roll went down to 9 pupils.
