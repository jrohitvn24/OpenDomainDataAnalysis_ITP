		<title>12     HURLY HAWKINS</title>
		<content>   Close by the church of Liff, Den of 
 Gray, are the ruins of an old castle  
 called "Hurly Hawkin". The site is a  
 tongue of land formed by the junction 
 of two rivulets and the ruins form a  
 small circular mound with large gray  
 stones jutting out here and there. But
 the ruins are nearly hidden by        
 decaying leaves and vegetation. Being 
 of historical interest it was examined
 some years ago but only a spur and    
 some ashes were found.                
   The castle belonged to Alexander the
 3rd. in the twelfth century.          
    A house in the grounds of the old  
 castle has been named after it.
