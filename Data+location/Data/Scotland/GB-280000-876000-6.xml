		<title>06Transport around Fearn.</title>
		<content> Around Fearn there are not many ways  
 to travel.One and a half miles away is
 Fearn Station.It is an old station and
 now there aren't any staff, it is a   
 request stop.The trains pass en route 
 for Thurso and Inverness.South        
 connections are made at Inverness and 
 a change at Dingwall means you can go 
 west.The fare to Tain is 20 pence     
 which is a lot less than by taxi or   
 bus.The bus service is popular as it  
 goes through the village and there are
 several daily services.The fare to    
 Tain has recently gone up 2p.to 38p..A
 bus at 8.30am.takes school children to
 Tain Royal Academy.                   
 Most people own cars as this is a much
 easier means of getting around.Most   
 roads are either B class or single    
 track.All have a tarred surface.
