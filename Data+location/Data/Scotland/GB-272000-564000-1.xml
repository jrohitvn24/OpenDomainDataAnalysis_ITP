		<content> The major part of this block is       
 farmland with the emphasis on         
 intensively managed grassland which is
 typical of much of Galloway.          
 The area is bisected by the A713 which
 is the main road from Castle Douglas  
 to Ayr. Running parallel to it is the 
 course of the now disused railway     
 line. The settlement pattern is a     
 dispersed one. There is some evidence 
 of past settlement in the area        
 including the site of a Roman Fort at 
 Glenlochar. The main settlement is    
 Crossmichael which is situated on the 
 A713 some three miles northwest of    
 Castle Douglas. It is a small village 
 with a couple of shops and a pub.     
 There are council hoses and a recent  
 private housing development in the    
 village. There is a small watersports 
 centre here because of the River Dee  
 which flows through this block.       </content>
