		<content> Our block encompasses most of         
{Bonchester Bridge}village,some        
 scattered housing and several farms.  
 The character of the area is mainly   
 farming,although many people travel   
 into{Hawick},12 Km.away,to work.Until 
 about ten years ago,many local people 
 were employed by the Forestry         
 Commission,but this has much decreased
 The landscape is hilly,and much of the
  building is on the flat land near the
 Rulewater,the river which runs through
 the block.Most of the hillsides are   
 only useful for grazing,but flatter   
 land is used to grow barley, turnips  
 and grass for winter feed,stored as   
 hay or silage.Recent years have seen a
 change from worker-occupied cottages  
 to more holiday or retirement homes.  
 A shift in population has brought     
 many new families to the district in  
 the last 20 years.                    </content>
