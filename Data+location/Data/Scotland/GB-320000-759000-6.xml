		<content> There are seventeen pupils in the     
 school ranging in age from five to    
 twelve. All pupils are taught in one  
 classroom. The average travelling     
 distance from home to school is four  
 miles. The longest distance a child   
 has to travel is ten miles. The       
 majority of pupils travel to school by
 mini-bus, some come by car and two    
 pupils walk. The transport is provided
 by the Education Authority. Since most
 pupils live some distance from school 
 lunch is taken there. Meals are not   
 cooked on the premises but are brought
 by taxi from a large primary school in
 Kirriemuir, about thirteen miles away.
 A few children eat packed lunches.    
 Visiting teachers include art, music  
 and P.E.teachers. Three pupils take   
 lessons from a violin instructor. The 
 local minister comes to school        
 regularly.                            </content>
