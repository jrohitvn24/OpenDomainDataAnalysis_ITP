		<content> Many games are played in the          
 playground of our school at Drumoak   
 and in the street or park after       
 school. Old favourites like "Hide and 
 Seek", "Tig and Tag", "Rounders" and  
 "Skipping".Here are two popular games 
 which are part of our recreation.     
 Kerbie: Two people stand on the kerb  
 facing each other. One takes a ball   
 and  tries to hit the opposite kerb.  
 If this is done he gets another       
 turn,butif he fails his opponent then 
 tries.                                
 Kiss,Cuddle and Torture is played by  
 boys and girls. When the girls are in 
 the "dell" they count up to ten and   
 the boys run away, the girls then try 
 to catch them. When caught, the girls 
 say 'Kiss,cuddle or torture" and the  
 boys have to give out the punishment. 
 The team then changes and the girls   
 run away.                             </content>
