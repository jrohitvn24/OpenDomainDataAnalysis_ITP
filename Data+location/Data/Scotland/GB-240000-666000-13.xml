		<title>13TRAVEL AROUND HOUSTON</title>
		<content>  Houston is very much a commuter      
 settlement. Few live and work in the  
 community. Many travel to work by     
 car. The village is so widespread that
 life without a car would be           
 difficult. Weekly shopping is bought  
 in Johnstone,Paisley and Renfrew with 
 Bridge of Weir useful for smaller     
 regular purchases. These towns plus   
 Greenock,Glasgow and Bishopton(M.O.D.)
 provide most workplaces.              
 New roads have been built in Houston  
 but no improvements have been made to 
 link roads to nearby towns. The rush  
 hour traffic load is therefore        
 becoming considerable,  causing       
 anxiety about safety. The only rail   
 link,i.e.Glasgow to Kilmacolm was     
 closed recently. There is an hourly   
 bus service with an express to Glasgow
 recently introduced.
