		<content> Although there are a few cows and hens
 in our area,by far the most common    
 animal is the sheep.They are mainly   
 Blackface,with some Suffolk-crosses   
 and Cheviots.Approximately 2,000 in   
 number,some belong to Sheep Clubs and 
 others belong to individual farmers or
 crofters.                             
 The sheep are very often on the       
 single-track road,grazing for food,and
 in Spring many new-born lambs are     
 killed by traffic.This makes many     
 sheep-owners very angry because often 
 people do not even stop when this     
 happens.It is felt that traffic moves 
 far too fast on the narrow            
 roads.However,some people in the area 
 also feel that the sheep should be    
 fenced in,especially in the village,  
 because they foul the road and paths.
