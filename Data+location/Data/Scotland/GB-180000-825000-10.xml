 Our school does two plays every year, 
 an English play and a Gaelic play.    
 This year our English play was called 
 "Us and Them".Every one in P4 5 6 and 
 7 had a part in the play.             
 The play was about two groups of      
 people wanting to settle the same area
 of land.At first they agree but greed 
 and suspicion drove them on to war and
 the survivors did not learn anything  
 from it,the lesson being,that people  
 seldom learn from history.            
 For our performance in Plockton we won
 the Lochalsh Youth Festival Trophy,   
 Junior Section. Later we learned      
 we had also won the S.C.D.A. trophy   
 for the Highland Division,a silver    
 cup called the NELSON CUP.
