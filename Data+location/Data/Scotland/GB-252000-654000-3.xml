		<title>03POST OFFICES, NEWTON MEARNS</title>
		<content> There are two sorting offices which   
 serve this area, one at Mearns Cross  
 Shopping Centre and the other at      
 Mearnskirk.                           
 During weekdays 53 collections are    
 made from the post boxes and these    
 vary from two to six per day. 3       
 sorters working manually handle about 
 1100 letters daily.                   
 Parcels are not collected so if anyone
 wants to send a parcel it has to be   
 taken to one of the three post        
 offices. There are two or three parcel
 deliveries each day.                  
 25 postal workers are employed and    
 staff turnover is about 6 annually.   
 Extra staff are recruited if the      
 workforce falls below 25 and at busy  
 times e.g. Christmas.
