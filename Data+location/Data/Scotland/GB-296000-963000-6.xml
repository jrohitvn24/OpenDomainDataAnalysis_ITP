		<title>06MORE FARMING</title>
		<content> Third landuse is that of hill ground, 
 unploughable, useful only for grazing 
 sheep and a small number of cattle.   
 The main farm is Borlum House which   
 runs out of the area to the south and 
 is only sheep grazing. A very good    
 hill sheep farm but economics of 1985 
 are declining hill sheep profitability
 and its future is uncertain. The      
 bottom third of the map is poor hill  
 ground with rock protruding in hill   
 outcrops, mostly granitic. It is      
 impossible to improve much of this    
 ground by means of lime and phosphates
 as it is inaccessible to tractors and 
 ariel application is to expensive for 
 the returns possible. In 1985 we see  
 a trend in land use towards           
 afforestation aided by Government by  
 tax concessions/direct grants towards 
 tree planting.
