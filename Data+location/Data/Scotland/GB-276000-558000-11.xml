		<title>11GELSTON CASTLE - 1930'S</title>
		<content> Fifty years ago there was no          
 electricity supply, but gas was made  
 at the castle. Electricity was        
 introduced in 1938,and took three     
 months to install. The staff consisted
 of a cook and a kitchenmaid,two       
 upstairs maids,a tablemaid and        
 sometimes a butler.                   
 The staff were up at 6a.m.The         
 kitchenmaid had to prepare the kitchen
 range for breakfast,which was at 9a.m.
 Other meal times were-lunch at 1p.m.  
 afternoon tea at 4p.m.and dinner at   
 8p.m.                                 
 The castle had ten bedrooms,a large   
 drawing-room,a smaller one known as   
 the blue drawing-room,a dining-room   
 and a well-stocked library.           
 The castle had four storeys,and food  
 was sent up to the dining-room in a   
 hand-operated lift.Butter and milk    
 were supplied by Gelston Mill.        </content>
