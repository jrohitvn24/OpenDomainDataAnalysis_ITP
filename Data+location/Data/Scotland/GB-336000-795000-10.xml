		<title>10BALLATER CAR-PARKS SURVEY</title>
		<content>          CHURCH SQUARE                
                                       
 Tourists approaching from the East    
 usually come to this car-park because 
 the other one is not sign-posted. This
 car-park though is not favoured by    
 locals because it is further from the 
 shops and off the main street.  It is 
 quite large and because of all the    
 cars and coaches that use the park    
 there a toilet was built.  Usually    
 this car-park is very quiet in the    
 morning but by the afternoon it is    
 very busy with coachloads of tourists 
 and visitors cars. There are no       
 charges for parking here.
