		<title>12Local history of Insch.</title>
		<content>  A little west of Insch you will      
 find Dunnydeer _ a hill of history.   
 Dunnydeer has the remains of three    
 forts on it.One,though in ruins is    
 still seen as a castle.Although the   
 turf fort is unrecognisable we can    
 still see the remains of a Vitrified  
 Fort.In this type of fort the stones  
 would have been piled up and wood set 
 around them and then set alight.This  
 produced such a heat that the stones  
 melted into one another.              
  North of Dunnydeer is the Picardy    
 Stone,dated from the 9th century.It   
 has some strange carvings such as     
 Z_rods,a snake,double discs and a     
 mirror on it.It is not clearly known  
 what these symbols mean.              
  The name Insch has a history too__   
 in 1536 it was known as Inchis and in 
 1550 Inche.This is from Innis meaning 
 meadow or haugh.                      </content>
