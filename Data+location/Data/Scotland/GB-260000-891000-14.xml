		<title>14BONAR BRIDGE SALMON QUEEN</title>
		<content>{The Salmon Queen Week}was started in  
 the 1950s by two local residents. This
 year it starts around the{27th July.  
   Each year a young local girl is     
 chosen as the{Salmon Queen.}She is    
 taken by boat across the{Kyle to Bonar
 where she is crowned. She has three   
 attendants, two girls and one boy.    
 There is a procession led by the Pipe 
 Band. Decorated floats follow, one    
 carrying the Salmon Queen and         
 attendants.                           
   During the week there are special   
 events such as{sports , competions and
{dances.}Each local club is supposed to
 organise one event. At the end of the 
 week all the prizes are given. This   
 year the events are only going to last
 for two days instead of a week.
