 Canna Post Office, like all the       
 offices in Skye, the Inner Hebrides   
 and Lochaber is a sub office of Fort  
 William. This office restocks Canna   
 with stamps, postal orders etc. and   
 informs it of changes in rules and    
 codes, which are being constantly     
 revised to make the service to the    
 public more efficient.                
 The Post Office is  vital for the     
 people of Canna, enabling them to have
 a relatively cheap form of            
 communication with friends and        
 businesses all over the world.        
 The Post Office plays an important    
 part in keeping a ferry link between  
 the islands. The term mail boat may be
 more appropiate as the ferry is       
 subsidised by the goverment and the   
 Post Office in order that we may      
 receive an adequate service.          </content>
