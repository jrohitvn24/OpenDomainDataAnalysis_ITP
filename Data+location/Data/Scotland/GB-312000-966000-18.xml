		<title>18BMX BICYCLING IN THURSO</title>
		<content>{  BMXing}in{Thurso}is growing all the 
 time.There are about 150 boys         
 interested in BMX bicycles.We have one
 cycle shop in Princes Street which    
 also sells accessories.I buy one thing
 every week.I usually buy stickers.We  
 are hoping for a BMX track but it     
 seems the council have forgotten all  
 about it.                             
   There is another series of BMX      
 called FREESTYLE which has got to do  
 with leaving the ground and doing     
 tricks.I have to keep everything      
 oiled.I have to strip the bike and    
 clean it.This takes about 2 hours and 
 I do this every week.My bike is called
 an MX MISSILE. It is made of CRO-MOLY 
 which means it is a lot lighter than a
 painted bike but it is much more rust 
 resistant than the normal bike.
