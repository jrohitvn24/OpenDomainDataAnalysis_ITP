		<title>06THE OYSTER FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
 The farming of oysters was started in 
 June 1984 by the landlords, the       
 National Trust for Scotland, with     
 financial support from the Highland   
 and Islands Development Board.        
 The farmed oysters are not the natural
 oysters of Britain (O. Edulis) but    
 Pacific oysters (C. Gigas) which      
 do not reproduce in our colder waters.
 Unlike fin-fish, shellfish do not need
 to be artificially fed and instead    
 feed on plankton which is abundant in 
 Canna Bay, especially during the      
 months of June to September when the  
 oysters grow at their fastest rate.   
 The oyster spat were bought from the  
 Isle of Colonsay, at three different  
 stages of growth so that an eighteen  
 month trial could monitor the         
 possibilities of a commercial         
 business.                             </content>
