		<content>   Christopher Irvine is a boy aged 10.
 He lives outwith the study area in the
 district of Ireland and he and his    
 sister Susan, age 7, are transported  
 to school every day by minibus, a     
 distance of 3 miles. Christopher's    
 father is a policeman initially based 
 at Stromness and it is for this reason
 that the family chose to live in      
 Stenness. The father was born in      
 Orkney but was brought up in Caithness
 and his wife also comes from that     
 county. Mrs. Irvine works as a typist 
 at Stromness Police station.          
 Christopher's favourite subjects in   
 school are gym and craft and he likes 
 maths if the problems are not too     
 difficult. His hobby is playing on his
 BMX bicycle at the weekends. When he  
 grows up he would like to be a racing 
 driver. We shall see!
