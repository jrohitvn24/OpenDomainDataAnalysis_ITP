		<title>18Children's Play Dalgety Bay.</title>
		<content> During the winter months children's   
 outdoor activities are limited. When  
 it snows, children can be seen having 
 snowball fights, making snowmen and   
 sledging. Indoors they watch their    
 favourite television programmes such  
 as The A Team, Fame and the News. Some
 children use their home computers to  
 play adventure games. Summertime is   
 the best time of the year because you 
 can go for long walks along the beach 
 and through the woods. Children have  
 to make their own amusement because   
 there are no facilities in Dalgety    
 Bay. Facilities such as a cinema,     
 bowling alley, swimming pool, skating 
 rink and tennis courts are available  
 in Inverkeithing, Aberdour and        
 Dunfermline but these all involve     
 travel from Dalgety Bay.
