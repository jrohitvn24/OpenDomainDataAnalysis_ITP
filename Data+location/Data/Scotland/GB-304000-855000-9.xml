		<title>09FARMING RAFFORD AREA</title>
		<content>  Much of the farmland that we saw was 
 given over to grass for grazing       
 cattle.Hay was grown to feed the      
 cattle in winter months.At one of the 
 farms we visted pure bred Aberdeen    
 Angus cattle are kept and the farmers 
 sell them for breeding purposes.Some  
 sheep are also grazed and many farmers
 grow turnips to help feed the sheep.  
 The most popular crop is barley which 
 is turned into malt and used for      
 making whisky in the many distilleries
 in the surrounding areas. A few       
 hectares are under oats.A few potatoes
 are grown for local markets.We did not
 find much fruit being grown although  
 one farmer had a few hectares of      
 strawberries which he sold locally.One
 farmer buys lime and stores it in a   
 barn then sells it to surrounding     
 farmers.                              
                                       </content>
