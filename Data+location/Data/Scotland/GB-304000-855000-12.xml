		<title>12HOUSING RAFFORD AREA</title>
		<content> The housing in our area is a mixture  
 of old farmhouses and cottages and    
 modern bungalows. The houses in the   
 village are spread over quite a large 
 area. There are many owner occupiers  
 and only a few houses are rented.Most 
 new houses are bungalows. The average 
 number of rooms is 6,the maximum is 14
 and the minimum is 3. Many of the new 
 houses have central heating and solid 
 fuel is most popular. Cooking is      
 mainly done by electricity. Many of   
 the older houses rely on open fires   
 and wood is the most popular fuel.    
 Only 1 house has solar heating panels.
 The largest house in the area is      
 Blervie House which of Georgian style 
 and has been empty for 9 years.
