		<content> I LIKE LIVING IN ST ABBS BECAUSE YOU  
 CAN WATCH THE BIRDS NESTING ON THE    
 CLIFFS AND THE BOATS COMING IN AND OUT
 . AT WEEKENDS I GO OUT ON MY PAPA'S   
 BOAT AND HAUL THE CRIBS . I SOMETIMES 
 GO OUT ON SUNDAY WITH THE ANGLERS . IN
 SUMMER I GO SWIMMING FROM THE SLIP AND
 PADDLE MY RUBBER DINGHY ROUND THE     
 HARBOUR. I LIKE GOING ROUND THE HEAD  
 JUST TO LOOK FOR BIRD'S EGGS BUT NOT  
 TO TOUCH THEM .YOU CAN FIND DIFFERENT 
 KINDS OF ROCKS AND EVEN SKULLS OF     
 SHEEP , RABBITS OR OTHER SMALL        
 CREATURES IF YOU ARE LUCKY. I ALSO    
 LIKE TO GO TO THE FARM TO HELP CLEAN  
 OUT THE CATTLE , STACK THE BALES OR GO
 ON THE TRACTOR WITH THE PLOUGH. IF THE
 WEATHER IS GOOD WE GO TO THE BEACH TO 
 SWIM OR JUST PLAY ON THE SAND . ON THE
 LAST DAY OF TERM THE SCHOOL HAD A     
 "SAUSAGE SIZZLE" ON THE BEACH . IT WAS
 GREAT FUN COLLECTING STICKS .         </content>
