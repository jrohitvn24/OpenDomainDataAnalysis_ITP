 In a church hall in Crieff, on several
 afternoons every week, scores of young
 ladies attend Mrs. Shuttleworth's     
 Dance School.                         
  Not only do they learn ballet, but   
 Polish,tap, disco and scottish.       
  Part of the time is spent working    
 towards exams such as primary grade 1,
 grade 2,  grade 3, grade 4 and senior 
 grade. The highlight of the year      
 however is the display, which is given
 in the High School Hall on two        
 evenings in June. Some of the routines
 this year were; SHOW BUSINESS, HAPPY  
 FEET, GHOSTBUSTERS, YELLOW BIRD, ALL I
 WANT FOR CHRISTMAS, BIG BALLET,       
 CAROUSEL, FLY A KITE and GITTERBUG.   
  Many  of the girls think as I do when
 I say "Ithink ballet is the best thing
 in the world."
