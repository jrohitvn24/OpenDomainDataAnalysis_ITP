		<title>11EASSIE ADULTS' PASTIMES</title>
		<content> We asked many adults in our area what 
 they did in their spare time. Apart   
 from watching television and reading, 
 which everyone seemed to enjoy, the   
 following activities were mentioned   
 most often.                           
 Many of the men supported Dundee      
 United football team and went to team 
 matches. Some adults used Forfar      
 Leisure Centre to take part in        
 badminton, squash etc..Ski-ing was    
 popular at Glenshee, an hour's drive  
 away and in the summer, camping,      
 caravanning and gardening were        
 mentioned. There were a few horse     
 owners who enjoyed riding and entering
 competitions.Some ladies were members 
 of Eassie W.R.I. and Woman's Guild and
 others helped with youth              
 organisations.
