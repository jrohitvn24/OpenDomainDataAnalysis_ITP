		<title>10CLERMISTON AND DRUMBRAE GALA</title>
		<content> On a Saturday in June every year a    
 gala day is held in Drumbrae Park.  A 
 Primary school-girl is chosen to be   
 queen for the day and she dresses up  
 for the part, along with her          
 attendants.  There are all sorts of   
 side shows and races.  There is a     
 five-a-side football game and our     
 school, Clermiston, were runners-up in
 the final.  The game lasted five      
 minutes in each half and we played    
 against East Craigs Primary.  We got a
 medal for coming second.              
                                       
{SPORTS DAY AT CLERMISTON SCHOOL       
 On Wednesday 29th May we had our      
 Sports Day.  Every class had three    
 events and ours were the flat, sack   
 and three-legged races.  Some of the  
 younger children did an egg-and-spoon 
 race instead of the three-legged one  
 in case they fell.                    </content>
