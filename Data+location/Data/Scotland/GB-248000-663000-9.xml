		<title>09BARSHAW PARK -PAISLEY</title>
		<content> Barshaw Park is the biggest park in   
 our area.  It is approximately one    
 quarter of a square kilometre in size 
 and is situated at the corner of      
 Arkleston Road and Glasgow Road.  It  
 has facilities for everyone no matter 
 their taste.  The leisure facilities  
 of the park include: B.M.X.           
 track, boating pond, tennis courts,   
 doggy park, crazy golf, putting green,
 miniature railway, assault course and 
 a municipal golf course and bowling   
 green.                                
                                       
 One of the main attractions of Barshaw
 is the one year old B.M.X. track      
 specially designed for B.M.X. bikes   
 which  have become popular recently.  
 They are sturdy bikes for performing  
 stunts and have padded handlebars and 
 frame.  The park occasionally hosts   
 special events e.g. Funfair Day.      </content>
