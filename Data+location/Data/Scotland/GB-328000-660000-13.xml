		<content>   I get up on a Saturday morning at   
 7.30 and let my dog Rusty out. He is a
 brown and white Cocker Spaniel. I take
 him for a walk up the glen which is   
 about 15 minutes away from my house.  
 My dog likes to play in the River Esk.
   When I return home 35 minutes later 
 I have my breakfast of cornflakes,    
 toast with marmalade and a glass of   
 milk. We usually drive to Dalkeith to 
 buy the weekly shopping and the daily 
 newspaper.                            
   For dinner we usually have cold meat
 and salad with fresh orange to drink  
 and cakes from the bakers.            
   In the afternoon I sometimes help my
 Dad prepare his Trials bike. His hobby
 is scrambling. Sometimes I help my Mum
 in the garden, cutting the grass and  
 watering the plants, if they need it. 
   We often take the dog for a longer  
 walk in the evening.                  </content>
