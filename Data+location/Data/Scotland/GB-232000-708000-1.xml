		<content> Our area is in the{West Highlands of  
{Scotland.}It stretches from the west  
 end of{Loch Arklet}to the West coast  
 of{Loch}Lomond. One third of our area 
 is covered by water. Since the area is
 renowned for its beautiful scenery it 
 attracts a lot of visitors. There are 
 10 houses in the area,including a     
 farm,2 holiday cottages and a shooting
 lodge. One of the houses is split into
 two flats. There is also a hotel,a    
 school and a church. The road which   
 ends at the hotel,is a single track   
 road with passing places. The road is 
 made more hazardous by goats,deer and 
 sheep straying onto it. No-one in the 
 area is unemployed.
