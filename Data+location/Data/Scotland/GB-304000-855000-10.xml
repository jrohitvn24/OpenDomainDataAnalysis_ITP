 Nearly all the people we interviewed  
 use the facility of the Forres Health 
 Centre when they are ill.Not many     
 people go for a yearly check-up and   
 even less go for o monthly check-up.  
 We found that 20% of the people wear  
 contact lenses and only 3% wear a     
 hearing aid.Nearly every adult drink  
 alcohol and only half the people      
 smoke.There are 15 people out of 137  
 who require pills daily and 50 out of 
 137 whohave had an operation.There are
 roughly 35 out of 137 people who eat  
 health foods.Hardly anybody out of the
 137 have asthma and out of the 137    
 only one person is disabled.In all the
 people we interviewed nobody had      
 anything serious like cancer or have  
 had heart attacks.
