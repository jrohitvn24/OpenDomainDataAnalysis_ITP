		<content>{ROCK CLIMBING                         
  I have never been rock climbing but I
 have always wanted to.I know a lot of 
 people that have been rock climbing.  
 there are a lot of big rocks around   
 our area with steep cliffs.           
{SWING PARK                            
 There is only one swing park in our   
 area and it is a pretty good swing    
 park.It only has two swings a round   
 about and a chute.The swing park is   
 only for little ones and I like the   
 round about best of all because once  
 when my uncle and aunte my uncle      
 pushed me really fast.He nearly made  
 me sick.I don't like being sick a lot 
 because I always have a sore throat.  
{FISHNG                                
 The River Nairn was famous for its    
 salmon until poachers poisoned it     
 several years ago.It will be some time
 before it will be completely clear.   </content>
