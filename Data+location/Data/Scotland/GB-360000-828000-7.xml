		<title>07An Arable Farm in Insch.</title>
		<content>  My Dad,his brother and my Grandad    
 share 1030 acres of mixed arable land.
 They fatten cattle and lambs and they 
 breed sheep.The animals are mostly    
 sold through Aberdeen and Northen     
 Marts,Insch.They grow winter barley,  
 winter wheat,oil_seed rape,protein    
 peas and spring barley for malting.   
 After the crops have been harvested   
 they are dried and stored and then    
 marketed through Union Grain,White_   
 rashes.The average price you would get
 for a tonne of barley is Â£106.        
  My dad works from fifty to seventy   
 hours a week and our busiest time of  
 the year is harvest.My dad has modern 
 machinery such as a sprayer,round     
 baler and a reversable plough.        
  The main problem on his farm is over 
 production of grain; another is the   
 weather! My brother and I hope to     
 carry on the farming tradition.       </content>
