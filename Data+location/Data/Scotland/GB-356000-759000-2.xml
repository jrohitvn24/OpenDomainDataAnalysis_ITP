		<content>{Cereals}(mainly barley, with some     
 wheat and oats) cover 48.5% of the    
 farmland.   The favourable natural    
 environment and present high grain    
 prices explain this dominance.   Mixed
{woodland}covers 14%.   Some form      
 shelter belts, some give privacy to   
 mansions and some grow naturally in   
 old limestone quarries worked a couple
 of centuries ago to lime the fields.  
{Rotation grass}for hay, silage or     
 sheep and cattle grazing covers 14%.  
 8.5% has{potatoes}planted either for  
 domestic use or for seed exports.     
{Oil seed rape,}for vegetable oils,    
 occupies 6.5% of the land.  {Turnips  
 (2.8%) have declined because silage is
 cheaper and fewer animals are now     
 raised.  {Peas}are grown on 2.8%      
 .  {Permanent pastures}(only 1.8%) are
 mainly next to farm steadings.        
{Raspberries}at 0.9% are now rare.     </content>
