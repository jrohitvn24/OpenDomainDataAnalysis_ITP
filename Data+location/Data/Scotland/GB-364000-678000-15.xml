		<content> In the old days the Battery was used  
 as an isolation hospital for the      
 periodic outbreaks of Scarlet Fever,  
 Diptheria, T.B. and even Typhoid !    
 During these outbreaks water had to be
 drawn from a special well in Cats Row.
                                       
 Mrs Vassie remembered the colourful   
 appearance of the Sirdar - General    
 Wingate and his retinue, sheltering   
 under a table from the first Zeppelin 
 raid; Mrs Graham remembered meeting   
 Mrs Pankhurst the famous suffragette, 
 helping to dress her hair.            
                                       
 All felt that changes had been both   
 good and ill, but both women felt glad
 that they grew up before the Wars     
 rather than in our modern society.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
