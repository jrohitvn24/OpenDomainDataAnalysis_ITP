		<content> Renfrew is now a comletely smokeless  
 zone. The last 3 winters have been    
 completely fog free as a result.      
 Noise pollution is however a problem  
 because the town is close to Glasgow  
 Airport. The Local Authority provides 
 grants for double glazing to affected 
 households. The level of noise is     
 monitored by Local Environment        
 Inspectors. Another hazard is the risk
 of importing foreign diseases to the  
 area. Hnece 24-hour emergency service 
 is operated to disinfect aircraft.    
 A vast programme of landscaping       
 derelict sites is underway, involving 
 shrub and tree planting and the       
 provision of grass and all-weather    
 pitches. It is mainly financed by     
 central and local government through  
 schemes for unmployed school          
 leavers.The area has four tree        
 preservation orders in force.         </content>
