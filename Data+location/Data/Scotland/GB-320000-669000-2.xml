		<content>  Edinburgh now has an active policy of
 not building on the Green Belt        
 surrounding the city. More housing is 
 constantly required, therefore urban  
 infilling on gap sites takes place    
 throughout Edinburgh. Within our      
 sector Cala Homes built new flats in  
 Spylaw Road, having demolished        
 Gillsland Park School for boys. The   
 same firm also built 32, 2-bedroom    
 flats in Craighouse Road on ground    
 which was used as playing fields by   
 George Watsons College.               
  Sixty-five 1 and 2 bedroom flats have
 been built by Wimpey homes on         
 wasteland on the corner of Polwarth   
 Terrace and Grays Loan.               
 Also sixty retirement flats have been 
 erected by Barrett builders in the    
 garden surrounding a large house which
 itself has been renovated and divided 
 into flats.{                          </content>
