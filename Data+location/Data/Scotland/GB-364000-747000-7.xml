		<title>07A DAY AT THE "BERRIES"</title>
		<content> The piece of ground you pick the      
 tatties from is called a{"bit"}which  
 is about 5m long. For a half bit you  
 get Â£4.50 and a whole bit Â£9.00. At   
 4.15p.m. the bus comes along and takes
 all the people home.                  
                                       
 In the summer holidays we can go      
{raspberry}picking. The "berries" start
 at about 7.30a.m. and finish at       
 4.00p.m. If you do not caper you      
 should earn about Â£4.00 or Â£5.00 in a 
 day. When you are picking you can     
 either tie your baskets around your   
 neck or around your waist. You get to 
 choose a{"dreel"}and you pick the     
 berries on that row. You are given a  
 crate which holds six individual      
 baskets. When you have filled six     
 baskets you take them to be weighed   
 and for the weight you will receive a 
 certain amount of money.              </content>
