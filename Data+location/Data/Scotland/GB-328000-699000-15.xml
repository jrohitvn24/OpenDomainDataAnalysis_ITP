		<content> Life is like writing a computer       
 program.It has easy parts and hard    
 parts,just like the easy times and    
 hard times in life.Writing a computer 
 program can have setbacks too just    
 like life has.A setback in writing a  
 computer program is when you type     
 something in and it doesn't work.A    
 setback in life is when you fall out  
 with a friend.As you get older a      
 setback in life could be not being    
 able to get a job or having a job and 
 losing it.These setbacks have to be   
 overcome if you are going to get on in
 life.If you overcome these setbacks   
 you should live a happy life.
