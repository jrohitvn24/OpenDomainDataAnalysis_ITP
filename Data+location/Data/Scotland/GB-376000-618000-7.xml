		<title>07CATTLE FARMING NEAR HOWNAM</title>
		<content> The farm,which is near Hownam, is run 
 as a beef enterprise,and worked as a  
 family  unit. To utilise the necessary
 machinary,agricultural contract work  
 is carried out. The farm is all under 
 grass  with about one quarter being   
 made into big bale silage each summer.
 Direct re-seeding is carried out when 
 necessary.Cows are put to Charollais  
 bulls and calved in the spring.These, 
 plus additional reared calves  are    
 taken through to finishing weights at 
 18 months.Cattle are all in-wintered  
 in sheds,the straw needed for feeding 
 and bedding is purchased and baled    
 further down Tweedside,and transported
 onto the farm.The muck from the sheds 
 is put in a midden to rot before being
 spread on the silage feilds after the 
 crop is cleared.This system works well
 as the land is mostly fairly steep and
 is unsuitable for arable cash crops.  </content>
