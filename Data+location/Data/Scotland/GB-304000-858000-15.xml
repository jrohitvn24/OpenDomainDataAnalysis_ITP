 between people living in Forres and in
 the countryside.There are more people 
 living in the urban areas than in the 
 rural areas. Most people live in the  
 housing estates which are{            
{Forbeshill,Drumduan}and a small part  
 of {Sanquar.}A small minority of the  
 people live in the surrounding area.  
 Most of the people live in the more   
 modern houses. Some of the people     
 living in the high street live in the 
 oldest houses in the area. The only   
 school in our block has 293 pupils.
