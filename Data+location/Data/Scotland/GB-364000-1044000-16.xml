		<content>{Mr.J.Dearness},his wife and two sons  
 have been living at{Scar}for the past 
 four years but the large farmhouse was
 built a century ago. The house now    
 has{22 rooms}though many are unused.  
 The farm livestock consists mainly of 
{100 cattle},though there are          
 sheep.In Winter the cattle are fed    
 mainly{silage},though with some hay.  
 The farm owns five working tractors to
 cover the{248 acres}of land on which  
 mostly silage and{hay}are             
 harvested.The farmers are kept busy   
 all day and most of the evening.      
 Although most big houses have a       
 basement,Scar doesn't,but has a small 
 wine cellar at the very top of the    
 house which is reached by climbing 4  
 staircases.It is worth mentioning that
 some people believe a{ghost}inhabits  
 Scar although{Mr.Dearness}doesn't     
 believe it.                           </content>
