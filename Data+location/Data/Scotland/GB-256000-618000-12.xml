		<title>12THE CUMNOCK CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> The Cumnock carnival or fair is held  
 once a year.  There are competitions  
 for fancy dressed individuals and     
 lorries.   Some streets dress up      
 lorries and enter them for it.   The  
 winner for the best dressed lorry was 
 Fenners who were dressed up as the    
 "Adams Family".   Some of the floats  
 entered were "The Wizard of Oz" by    
 River View, "Cheers" by the Mercat Inn
 and "Clowns " by Cumnock Juniors'     
 Social Club.                          
 Cumnock annual flower show came up    
 roses on Saturday 17 August 1985      
 despite a season that has been a      
 gardeners' nightmare.  That was the   
 comment of the judges and organisers  
 of the show.                          
 Cumnock Junior F.C. got off to a good 
 start to the season by beating Kello  
 Rovers 4-1.
