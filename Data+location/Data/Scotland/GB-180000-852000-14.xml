		<title>14WILDLIFE OF SHIELDAIG</title>
		<content>    THERE IS A VARIETY OF WILDLIFE     
 AROUND SHIELDAIG.   LATE AT NIGHT YOU 
 CAN SEE SEA OTTERS AND SOMETIMES A FOX
 OR WILDCAT.   YOU DO NOT SEE THEM     
 OFTEN.                                
    THERE ARE A LOT OF BIRDS TOO.   YOU
 CAN SEE SNIPES,                       
 CORMORANTS,GREAT-NORTHERN DIVERS AND  
 RED-THROATED DIVERS.   THESE ARE      
 ONLY A FEW OF ALL THE BIRDS YOU CAN   
 SEE OR HEAR.                          
    THERE ARE A LOT OF SEALS AT        
 RUBH-AN-ROIN, WHICH IS GAELIC FOR     
 'SEAL POINT'.   YOU CAN SOMETIMES SEE 
 THEIR BLACK HEADS WHICH CAN BE        
 MISTAKEN FOR BUOYS.   SOMETIMES YOU   
 CAN HEAR THEM BARKING.                
    YOU CAN SEE DEER IN THE WINTER WHEN
 THEY COME DOWN FROM THE HILLS.   ONE  
 RARE ANIMAL WHICH STEALS HENS ARE THE 
 PINE MARTENS WHICH INHABIT THE QUIETER
 AREAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOCH.  </content>
