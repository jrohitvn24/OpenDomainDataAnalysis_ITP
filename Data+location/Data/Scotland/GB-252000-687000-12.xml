		<title>12EMPLOYMENT IN BALFRON AREA</title>
		<content>    The survey we carried out on about 
 one third of the households in Balfron
 showed that 40% of the working adults 
{worked locally,}while 60%{commuted}to 
 Glasgow or Stirling.                  
    The largest{employer}in the area is
 the High School, with 85 people       
 employed there, 46% of whom live in   
 Balfron area. The bus garage employs  
 28 drivers and 9 others while about 40
 people work in shops and 18 work in   
 the bank. Tradesmen, those in service 
 industries, farm workers and estate   
 workers make up the remainder of those
 employed in the district. Fortunately 
 the high rate of{unemployment}found in
 urban areas is not found in our rural 
 area. There is an increasing number of
 retired people living in Balfron now. 
 Most of the young people take up      
 employment outside the area when they 
 leave school.                         </content>
