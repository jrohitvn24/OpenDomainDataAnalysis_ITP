		<title>16Life is........</title>
		<content> Life is like climbing up a hill.Some  
 parts are steep and some parts are    
 easy to get up.Sometimes you fall on  
 steep bits,but it is easy to get up   
 again and carry on.Usually though it  
 can be hard.Just as you think you are 
 getting to the top you may find that  
 there is still another ridge to climb.
 Then as you reach the summit you have 
 a glorious feeling,but you have to go 
 back down the hill.You have conquered 
 that hill.You may have conquered other
 small hills,but there are still many  
 larger hills to climb.You cannot climb
 every hill,but you must climb all the 
 hills that you can climb until you can
 climb no longer.Then your life is at  
 an end.
