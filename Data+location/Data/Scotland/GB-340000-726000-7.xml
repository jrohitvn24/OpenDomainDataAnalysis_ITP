		<content>   Sports: In Newport a new sports     
 centre is being built to replace an   
 older one which fell down. This centre
 provides facilities for a wide range  
 of indoor and outdoor sports. In      
 addition there is a tennis club in    
 Wormit which has three all weather    
 courts and where tennis coaching and  
 tournaments are held for adults and   
 children. There is also a bowling club
 and a boating club. The latter        
 provides coaching in sailing and      
 regattas are held every year.* There  
 is a lot of provision for gymnastics  
 in the area. The youth club in        
 Newport, and Wormit School are the    
 venues for this activity for children 
 of all ages and abilities.            
   Wormit School also provides a place 
 for yoga and keep fit.                
   * In summer the club holds football 
 matches on the sandbanks in the Tay.  </content>
