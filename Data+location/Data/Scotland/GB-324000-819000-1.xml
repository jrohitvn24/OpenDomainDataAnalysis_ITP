		<title>01THE BRAES OF GLENLIVET</title>
		<content>   Just called the Braes, this secluded
 glen  below the Ladder hills is mostly
 grouse moor with some farming which is
 not  helped  by  bogs,  deer  and  bad
 weather.  There  are  few amenities as
 the  post office, shop and school  are
 all  closed,  but  at  the  road-end a
 distillery  and  Catholic Church serve
 the spiritual  needs  of  the  people!
 Tracks leave the road to the farms and
 the old College of the Scalan. Conifer
 plantations form  wind  breaks. Clumps
 of  native   trees  often  found  near
 ruined walls, show that there had been
 many more  people  living  here at one
 time. Some of the old croft houses are
 now  holiday homes. The age groups are
 mixed and a bus load of children leave
 for school each  day. A  small  public
 hall is in frequent  use  for  various
 social occasions.                     
                                       </content>
