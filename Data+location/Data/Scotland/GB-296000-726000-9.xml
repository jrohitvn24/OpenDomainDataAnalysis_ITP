		<content> A farmer's wife said that their farm  
 is only affected by the College       
 because of the fruit shop open to the 
 boys and the school facilities open to
 them.  Life does not differ much in   
 the holidays apart from that it is    
 quieter and it is generally the busy  
 time of year, so she helps out on the 
 farm.  Her life would not differ if   
 she lived further away, but it would  
 were she to live in a town.           
 The College Manciple, and his wife who
 is a cleaner, donate all their time to
 the College. Theirs is a 24 hour job, 
 as the wife stands in for the Manciple
 sometimes, so life does not change    
 much in the holidays. Then, they are  
 nearly always in the College, tending 
 to security and making daily checks.  
 They feel very lucky to have a job,   
 although their retirement is drawing  
 near. They wish to stay in Perthshire.</content>
