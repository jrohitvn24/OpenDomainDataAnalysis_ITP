		<title>20A Day in the life of Wilbert</title>
		<content> I wake up get dressed and head for the
 kitchen.I usually eat Kellogg's       
 Cornflakes or Fruit n' Fibre.         
 The clock in the living room strikes  
 nine so I snatch my schoolbag,coat and
 fiddle and say goodbye to my mother.A 
 mini_bus picks me up and takes me to  
 school.                               
 School starts at 9.30am and finishes  
 at 3.45pm.We have an hour for dinner  
 at 12.30pm.Today for dinner we had    
 fish,potatoes,tomato sauce and        
 sweetcorn followed by fruit pie and   
 custard.                              
 After school I watched television     
 until 5.30pm when Craig came to pick  
 me up to take me to Lerwick.We were   
 going to rehearse for the Junior      
 Fiddlers Society.We had chips before  
 going home.                           
 At 11.15pm I had supper and went to   
 bed.                                  </content>
