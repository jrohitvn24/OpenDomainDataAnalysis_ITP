 school,situated in this block.Most of 
 the children aged between 5 and 12    
 attend here,and at the moment there   
 are 45 enrolled.(The roll fluctuates  
 due to the frequent movement of       
 families in and out of the area. The  
 future of the school is currently

 classes,taught by two full-time and   
 three visiting part-time teachers for 
 music,gym and reading.There is a part

 play areas,and a conservation area    
 planted with young British deciduous
