		<content>{Houses Old and New}                   
      The fastest growing area of house
 construction at the present is at     
 Badabrie, a small section of hillside 
 west of the Caledonian Canal where an 
 increasing amount of private housing  
 is being built.                       
      Finally the oldest houses on this
 block are to be found along the canal 
 side and in Banavie village here there
 is a mixture of private and council   
 properties and a mixture of the old   
 and the new.                          
      Here in Banavie can be found     
 older traces of the areas history, the
 most notable example being the Canal  
 Lock-keepers' houses, built by        
 the great engineer Thomas Telford,    
 with their bow frontages which enabled
 the keeper to view the traffic passing
 up and down the canal.
