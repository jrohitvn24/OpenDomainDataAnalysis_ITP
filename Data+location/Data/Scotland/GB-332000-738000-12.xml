		<content> Many of the fields will be carrying   
 crops of grass and clover for hay, or 
 silage or grazing. One of our farms   
 grows nothing but fruit. During the   
{winter}raspberry canes are trimmed and
 tied to wires in long rows. In spring 
 the leaves appear and are soon        
 followed by flowers and during{July   
 and{August}by masses of ripe red      
{raspberries.}Large numbers of people  
 including children go to the{berries  
 or{raspberry-picking.}As well as local
 people large numbers come from the    
 towns by bus. The{berries}are picked  
 into baskets or pails according to    
 their quality. The ones in pails to be
 pulped for{jam}or{dye,}The ones in    
 baskets are taken to a nearby{factory 
 where they are{quick-frozen}and put   
 into cold storage for table use across
 the{world. }
