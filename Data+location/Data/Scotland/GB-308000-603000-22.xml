<title>22We are lucky - thee are still many individual specialist shops</title>
<content>

Unlike so many towns these days, Moffat has not been taken over by charity shops, banks and building societies.  As well as still having our large Moffat Mill at the southern end of the town, we still have several shops selling woollens in the town centre, but we also have many very individual shops - including the world-renowned Moffat Toffee Shop.  Take a turn up the side shopping street - Well Street - and all the shops are specialist shops selling wonderful items - from a haggis to a house!   &lt;br />
