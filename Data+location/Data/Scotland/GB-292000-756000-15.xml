		<content>  Perhaps the people least catered     
 for socially are teenagers. There are 
 no shops for young people and only an 
 amusement arcade and discos to take up
 their spare time. Most are members of 
 sports clubs.                         
  Balanced against this is the         
 availability of temporary employment  
 which means teenagers have plenty of  
 money, much of which is saved - pupils
 spend ,on average, Â£3.44 per week.    
  Being a tight-knit community it can  
 be a bad thing if you don't fit in -  
 therefore there is a great pressure to
 conform. And although when leaving    
 school employment can be found in     
 local trades, joiners, butchers etc.  
 there is the local saying, "The clever
 ones leave the quickest."
