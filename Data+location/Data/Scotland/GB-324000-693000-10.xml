		<content> The{Victoria Hospital}was built in    
 three phases.Phase 1 was opened in    
 1880 by Princess Royal.It had beds for
 around 100 patients, with only 5      
 nursing staff.Phase two was opened in 
 1967.It consisted of a 14 storey tower
 block.The third and final phase was   
 opened in 1983.This was a separate    
 building for psychiatric and geriatric
 patients.This raised the number of    
 beds available to 640,although there  
 are usually only 580 patients in the  
 hospital with over 150 medical staff  
 and 100 clerical staff. The hospital  
 has five main operating theatres with 
 two available to carry out minor      
 operations. The hospital can carry out
 many kinds of operations but patients 
 must be taken to the larger hospital  
 in Edinburgh for brain operations if  
 anyone sustains head injuries in a    
 crash.                                </content>
