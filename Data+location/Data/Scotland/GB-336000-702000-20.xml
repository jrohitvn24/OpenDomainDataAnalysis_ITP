		<content> The Municipal is Levens public golf   
 course and it can be played on by     
 paying at the clubhouse.There are mine
 workings near the middle of the course
 that can be seen near the 3rd hole.   
 Before the war the Municipal was a    
 9-hole ladies course but was ploughed 
 up during the war to make room for    
 more crops.After the war it was       
 rebuilt into an 18-hole course.       
   The Thistle and Innerleven golf     
 clubs share the course which is near  
 the sea shore.The Innerleven golf club
 once had their own course at          
 Dubbieside but this was displaced when
 the Methil docks were built.They then 
 moved to Leven and shared a course    
 with Leven Thistle.The Municipal is   
 4967 metres long and the Thistle and  
 Innerleven course is 5881 metres.
