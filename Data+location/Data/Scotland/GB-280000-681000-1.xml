		<content> The Burgh of Denny and Dunipace is    
 part of Falkirk District in the       
{Central Region}of Scotland. The       
 historic town of{Stirling}and the     
 Ochil Hills lie about 7 miles to the  
 north. Glasgow is 19 miles south/west.
 To the east is the busy town of       
{Falkirk}and the port of Grangemouth on
 the{Forth.}The beautiful Fintry Hills 
 and Campsie Fells are situated to the 
 west. The Burgh is made up of the     
 small town of Denny and the village of
 Dunipace and stands on the River      
 Carron. The burgh is built on gentle  
 slopes and the area around is         
 agricultural and very pretty. While   
 local shops can supply most of the    
 needs of the community, large numbers 
 of people shop in Falkirk and         
 Stirling. There are many estates of   
 council houses but more private houses
 are being built.                      </content>
