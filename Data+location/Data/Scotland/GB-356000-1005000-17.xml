		<title>17RELIGION IN DEERNESS</title>
		<content> Almost all Orcadians in Deerness are  
{Church of Scotland.}Incomers of other 
 denominations integrate well and join 
 the choir on special occasions. The   
 former Parish Church, St. Ninians with
 its surrounding{churchyard,}and the   
 West Church, formerly Free, then      
 United Free, are used on alternate    
 Sundays. There are 132 members out of 
 an adult population of 236. There is a
{Sunday School and Woman's Guild.}In   
 l974 Deerness became a{linked charge  
 with the neighbouring parish of St.   
 Andrews. In July 1985 a new minister  
 was inducted, an unusual event in     
 Deerness as his predecessor stayed 55 
 years and also had the distinction of 
 being the last minister to be inducted
 into a Parish Church by the Presbytery
 of Kirkwall before the Union in 1929. 
{Communion Tokens}were replaced by     
 cards as recently as 1981.            </content>
