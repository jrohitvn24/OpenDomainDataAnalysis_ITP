 Leswalt.  There are 217 members and   
 six elder districts 30 members homes

 the parish.  The church has a band of 
 enthusiastic workers and, though not  
 wealthy, seeks to serve the community 
 in Christian service, public events   
 and entertainment.  In July, 1985, on 
 the retiral of the Leswalt minister,  
 the church was linked with that of    
 Ervie-Kirkcolm (272 members) and the  
 linked change is named Ervie-Kirkcolm

 the 11.45am Leswalt service.  The     
 linked parish now extends from the
