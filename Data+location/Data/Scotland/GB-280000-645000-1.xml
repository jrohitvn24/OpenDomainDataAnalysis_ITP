		<content> Block 02800645 contains the small     
 sleepy village of Crossford and, a    
 good sttretch of the River Clyde flows
 swiftly through and has occasionally  
 been known to badly flood the village.
 The surrounding land is used mainly   
 for farming i.e grazing, atlhough some
 is used for fruit growing and market  
 gardening. One of the most famous     
 products of this area is the tomato,  
 which is grown in some of the vast    
 glasshouse, situated in and around the
 village. Also contained in the block  
 are the small villages of Tillietudlem
 and Netherburn, but these have few    
 houses and certainly no industry.  The
 people who live in this area have to  
 travel  some distance to work as there
 is very little in the way of          
 employment here.
