		<content> The land in our area is mainly        
 moorland.There are many small         
 lochs amongst the hills.Streams flow  
 from the high land down to the sea.In 
 winter the land is very wet.          
 In the eastern half of our grid two   
 Voes or inlets dominate the area.The  
 one to the south is Busta             
 Voe.Sometimes in winter boats seek    
 shelter here from westerly gales.To   
 the north is the famous Sullom Voe.Not
 to far north of our grid on the shores
 of the voe stands Europes largest Oil 
 Terminal.In the western half of our   
 grid the Atlantic Ocean crashes into  
 rocky shores.                         
 The nearby Terminal has left its mark 
 on the grid,oil pollution booms are   
 stationed in the voe,half of ahillside
 has been removed for stones to help in
 the building of the Terminal.
