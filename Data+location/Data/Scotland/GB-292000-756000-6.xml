		<content>    Living on a farm is always tiring  
 though perhaps the worst time, but    
 most rewarding , is Spring lambing.   
    I am expected to help, and this    
 means up at half past six to go round 
 the sheep and check for any           
 emergencies.Then into the pens with   
 the sheep and off to milk the cows.   
 After that I might manage to get some 
 breakfast before getting back to the  
 sheep and separating the ewes that    
 have lambed into the hill field.      
 Finally, I get to relax by going to   
 school .                              
    The best part about living on the  
 farm is the peace and quiet , except, 
 of course , when I race up and down in
 the Leyland tractor .But the isolation
 also means that you can get bored.I   
 feel cut off from my friends . I know 
 when I leave school I won't stay on   
 the farm:it's too much hard work.     </content>
