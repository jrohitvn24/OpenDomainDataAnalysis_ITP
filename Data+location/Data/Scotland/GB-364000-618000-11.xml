		<title>11Customs Hand ba' in Jedburgh</title>
		<content> Ba'day is held on Fastern's E'en (the 
 day before Lent).The game is played   
 between the Uppies born above the     
 Mercat Cross,and the Doonies born     
 below it.The game is played with a    
 ball of leather filled with sawdust or
 damp straw and has three ribbons      
 attached .To hail (score) the Uppies  
 have to get the ball over the castle  
 wall and the Doonies score at the     
 bottom of the town.The shops'windows  
 are boarded up for protection as the  
 game is played in the streets.To start
 the game the ball is thrown up in the 
 air. Everybody jumps to try to get it 
 There are no rules and the game is    
 very rough.
