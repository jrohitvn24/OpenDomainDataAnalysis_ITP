		<title>01The Cairn Village,Loch Ryan</title>
		<content> Cairnryan village is situated east of 
 the A77 road (Glasgow-Portpatrick).   
 The main employers are Townsend       
 Thoresen who operate the cross channel
 ferry service between the ports of    
 Cairnryan and Lorne, Northern Ireland 
 and to a lesser extent Cairnryan      
 Breakers Yard where such naval ships  
 as Ark Royal, Eagle and Bulwark were  
 'cut up'.  Almost all the workforce   
 comes from the village of Cairnryan.  
 The Cairn Hill overlooks the village  
 and part of the hill is being quarried
 by a local firm supplying 'bottoming' 
 for road construction in southwest    
 Scotland.  The remainder of the land  
 scape is mainly trees and farmlands   
 used for grazing and mild produce.
