		<title>15HUNTING,SHOOTING,FISHING</title>
		<content> Some people in Midmar shoot           
 game like hare, rabbit, pheasant and  
 grouse.Many people keep lambs or pigs 
 until they are fat and then they      
 slaughter them for the freezer.Venison
 is deer and is very nice to eat, like 
 pheasant it is very strong tasting.The
 deer live in the woods and the farmers
 shoot them because they eat the crops 
 and the bark of the trees.Scots people
 like whisky which is distilled near   
 our area.Also a hot toddy must be the 
 most popular drink on a cold night.We 
 get fresh fish from Aberdeen and the  
 trawlers still come into the harbour. 
 Some fishermen go to the Dee or the   
 Don to fish for salmon or small trout.
