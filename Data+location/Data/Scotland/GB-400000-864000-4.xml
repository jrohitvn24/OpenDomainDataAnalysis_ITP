		<content> My dad owns the "Silver Fern". He     
 is always busy making charts, buying  
 stores, mending nets ready to go out. 
 A fisherman has a very dangerous job. 
 My dad collects the crew and the food 
 for the boat. He pair trawls with the 
 "Valiant". My dad goes 300 miles      
 North_East of Fraserburgh to the      
 fishing grounds. The "Valiant" shoots 
 his net then tows for 3 hours. While  
 he is towing, the crew relax.They pull
 the net and get from 25-100 boxes.    
 My dad is on the "Taits",a purser.He  
 leaves at midnight on Sunday for      
 Shetland and arrives at the fishing   
 grounds at midday .When the sonar goes
 "bing bong" it has found some fish.My 
 dad gets a call then goes up on deck. 
 He puts on oilskins and works the     
 winch. The net goes! The fish go into 
 a  tank. They then land them in       
 Holland.                              </content>
