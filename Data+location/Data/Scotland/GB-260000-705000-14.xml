		<title>14LANDSCAPE AROUND CALLANDER</title>
		<content> The landscape of this area is flat    
 looking south to the rich low lying   
 farmland of the Forth Valley.To the   
 East,the ground shows signs of the    
 remains of {glaciation.}To the west   
 and north are the lochs and mountains 
 of the {Highlands.}                   
 The Red Bridge crosses the river where
 the old {fording place}used to be.It  
 joined thevillages of Kirkton and     
 Bridgend.                             
 Just along the river is white painted 
 Waterside House,and beside the bridge 
 is the old Callander Cemetery.        
 The sundial beside the footbridge     
 dates from 1753 and has an interesting
 inscription.St.Brides Church,now      
 Callander Kirk dated 1861 is worth a  
 visit for its beautiful interior.     
 To the west is Samson's Putting Stone 
 ,the result of glaciation.
