		<title>02SANDWICK GENERAL VIEW (cont)</title>
		<content>   There are two general stores/bakers 
 and the others specialise in bicycles 
 knitwear and Norwegian imported goods.
   The knitwear factory employs mainly 
 home knitters but finishing, packing  
 and weaving tweed are done on the     
 premises.                             
   The tourist industry is important   
 particularly as Sandwick is the link  
 to the island of Mousa, site of the   
 best preserved Pictish broch in       
 Britain.                              
   The local churches are well atten-  
 ded particularly the one at the head  
 of Sandwick bay.                      
   Fishing is no longer of great       
 importance to the local economy       
 although  some people travel from the 
 area to work as fishermen or in fish  
 processing.
