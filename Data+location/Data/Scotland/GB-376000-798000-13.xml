		<content> Local saddler,Mr.George Sim,has lived 
 in Drumoak all his life.              
 He has seen the decline in his trade, 
 starting in the late 40's when        
 tractors became popular.Instead of    
 repairing harness and saddles he now  
 repairs upholstery.                   
 He can remember when the cotters (farm
 labourers) reared large families on a 
 very meagre wage,the only perquisites 
 being a rent_free house,{boll (140 lb 
 oatmeal,milk and potatoes.Their staple
 diet was brose (oatmeal stirred with  
 boiling water,seasoned with salt and  
 eaten with milk) and porridge.        
 The{Feein' Market}(hiring market) was 
 held in Aberdeen.{Muckle Friday}was   
 when the best men were employed and   
 given{ARLES}(one shilling (5p) given  
 on engagement) and Rascal Friday,the  
 following week,was when the remainder 
 of the farm workers sought employment.</content>
