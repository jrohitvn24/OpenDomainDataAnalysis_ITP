		<title>16CHARACTERS IN WEST KILBRIDE</title>
		<content>        {The Cemetery Warden           
 Mr. Macrae is the cemetery warden in  
 West Kilbride.  He says he has never  
 seen a ghost and that he doesn't      
 believe in them.  He says that people 
 don't die on a regular basis but he   
 has on average{54 funerals a year. }He
 visits the cemetery every night to    
 make sure that everything is secure.  
 This helps to deter the vandals who   
 might be tempted to destroy the       
 gravestones.                          
                                       
 The{oldest grave}in the cemetery is   
 that of John Simpson and Mary Morris  
 who were buried in 1863.              
                                       
 Although he has been working there for
 fourteen years, Mr. Macrae has only   
 had one accident: he fell through two 
 coffins when he was burying the third!
