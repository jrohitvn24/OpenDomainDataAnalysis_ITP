 Basically, the beach running from the 
 base of the cliff to the sea can be   
 divided into three sections. Firstly, 
 at the base of the cliff, the shore   
 consists of large pebbles rounded by  
 the sea and boulders which have       
 broken off and fallen from the cliff  
 itself. The remains of dry sea weed   
 are present and also limpet, mussel   
 and periwinkle shells. Secondly, there
 is the rock area. Here, sea snails,   
 barnacles, limpets, whelks, winkles   
 and periwinkles as well as small crabs
 are present in the rock pools. Sea    
 weeds such as sea lettuce, egg spiral 
 and serrated wrack are abundant.      
 Thirdly, before the sea, is a stretch 
 of sand. Here, at low tide, are the   
 markings of lugworms, with one or two 
 small remains of sea lettuce and other
 floating sea weeds.                   </content>
