		<title>08LIFE ON A FARM</title>
		<content> I live on quite a big farm called     
 Farness. We live in the big farm      
 manager's house because my dad is the 
 farm manager.                         
 On the farm we have no cows but there 
 are lots of sheep and there are a few 
 different breeds. Suffolk, Cheviot,   
 Mule and Suffolk cross. The Mule has a
 brown face with some white patches.   
   As well as sheep we have quite a lot
 of fields with crops. We grow barley, 
 oil-seed rape,turnip(for the sheep)   
 and wheat. Dad has two men working for
 him and another man comes to help in  
 the harvest and at lambing time.      
 The shepherd is supposed to be retired
 but he is staying on to look after the
 Suffolks. I am very glad to live on a 
 farm. I like to look after abandoned  
 lambs. One Suffolk lamb had two broken
 legs, I called her Wendy. Mum and I   
 share a donkey and a wee Shetland pony</content>
