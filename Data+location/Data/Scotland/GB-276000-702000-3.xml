  The school has a very good Pipe Band.
It has played at Rugby Internationals  
at Murrayfield without fail since      
inception on 21st march 1925. The band 
also plays at several other functions  
throughout the year. Highland dancers  
also give a good account of themselves 
in various displays and competitions.  
  The main sports are rugby, football, 
athletics, sailing, canoeing, and      
swimming.  Many hobbies are available  
to the boys during the long winter     
term.                                  
  The main event of the year is Grand  
Day when the boys dress up in their    
red jackets and Hunting Stewart kilts  
and parade before their parents and    
an inspecting general.
