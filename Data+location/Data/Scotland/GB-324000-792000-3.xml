		<content> The catchment area for our school     
 covers 100 square kilometres.  The    
 school was built in 1869.  Our school 
 uniform is white shirt or blouse. Boys
 wear a bottle green tie, both boys and
 girls wear kilts and bottle green     
 jumpers.  In winter we go skiing at   
 Glenshee and we have a ski race when  
 only the fastest skiers go. We have 34
 pupils at Crathie, 16 in room 1 and 18
 in room 2. Mrs Birss is our head-     
 teacher and our other teacher is Mrs  
 Grigor. We do lots of projects. We    
 have visiting teachers for gym, drama,
 music, art and sewing.  At break we   
 play all sorts of games.  In summer we
 get 6 weeks off school. Sometimes in  
 winter we get snowed in so we have no 
 school. We get homework such as       
 reading or tables. Just now we are    
 having a new extension built on to the
 school.                               </content>
