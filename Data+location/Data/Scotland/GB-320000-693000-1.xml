		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF GRID 03200693</title>
		<content> The area is divided by the valley of  
 the River Ore,with the land rising    
 gently from the river. On the south   
 side of the  river are the villages of
 Cardenden and Dundonald,on the north  
 side,Bowhill and Auchterderran.In the 
 past,the population was almost wholly 
 employed in local coal mines.During   
 the late 60's and early 70's  the coal
 industry contracted,as a result, the  
 villages are no more than dormitory   
 settlements.Large tracts of land are  
 spoiled by derelict mining buildings  
 and pit bings.The Regional Council    
 have plans to reclaim this lsnd for   
 agriculture in 1988/93.               
 In the surrounding countryside mixed  
 farming is practised.On the eastern   
 side of the area,the Forestry         
 Commission has plantations of         
 spruce,pines and larch.
