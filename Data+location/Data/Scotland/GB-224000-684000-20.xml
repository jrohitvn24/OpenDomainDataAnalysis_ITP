		<title>20RATES REVALUATION IN RHU.</title>
		<content> Although not peculiar to our area,many
 local residents are concerned over the
 recent rates revaluation which has    
 taken place in Scotland.It is felt    
 that ours is an already extremely     
 highly rated area and that this is    
 proving to be an ever_increasing      
 financial burden especially when many 
 people feel that the standard of      
 public services, at present, does not 
 merit such high rates. An example     
 given by many residents is the poor   
 state of repair of both roads and     
 pavements in our district.
