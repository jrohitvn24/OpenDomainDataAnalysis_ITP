   A young pilot from Prestwick's      
{H.M.S. Gannet}was killed and his      
 co_pilot seriously injured when their 
 Sea King helicopter crashed in Fife   
 whilst taking part in a N.A.T.O.      
 exercise.  The cause of the crash will
 not be made known till an M.O.D. and  
 Aircraft Accident Investigation Unit  
 complete their in enquiries.          
   The{District Council}has criticised 
 the decision of the Secretary of State
 to overturn their refusal of planning 
 permission for private sheltered      
 housing at Barns Park.  Provost       
 MacDonald said too many houses were   
 planned resulting in a lack of open   
 space and insufficient car parking    
 facilities.
