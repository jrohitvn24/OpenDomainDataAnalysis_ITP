{Building Specialists, Station Road,   
{Auchtermuchty, Fife, KY14 7DP.        
 The business was set up in 1965 and   
 was developed on the site vacated by  
 the closure of the railway line to    
 Auchtermuchty from Ladybank. The      
 company supplies steel frameworks for 
 any type of building, whether for     
 agriculture or industry. Having       
 started as a one man business, the    
 company now employs approx. 100 men.  
 There is a lot of automation, but     
 welding is still done manually.       
 Computers are used in the office and  
 on the shop floor.                    
 Rippin has a competitive market       
 stretching all over the U.K. It is the
 third largest company involved in this
 type of construction at present (1985)
 in the U.K. Rippin relies on its      
 reputation to secure orders.          </content>
