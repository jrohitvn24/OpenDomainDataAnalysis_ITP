		<content>   Within easy travelling distance of  
 the town there are many beautiful     
 places.There are clean,sandy beaches  
 close by.The beaches are away from the
 road so they are quiet and safe for   
 young children to run about on.Inland 
 there is a deer park,a deer museum and
 a wild goat park.The wild goat park   
 and the deer park are very large      
 fenced enclosures where the animals   
 are perfectly free to roam about.Near 
 these parks is Clatteringshaws,a large
 dam and reservoir,part of the Galloway
 Hydro-Electric Scheme.The road that   
 passes by this place is known as the  
 Queens Way.The Forestry Commission has
 made forest walks and picnic sites for
 tourists and local people to          
 enjoy.Anglers,antiquarians,artists,   
 botanists,cyclists,geologists,hikers, 
 mountaineers_all would find Newton    
 Stewart a good centre.                </content>
