		<title>14The Lynhurst Hotel Johnstone</title>
		<content> The Lynhurst Hotel is situated on a   
 quiet road near Johnstone town centre.
 The Lynhurst has a good reputation in 
 Johnstone and regularly holds         
 functions in its own private function 
 suite. It has two pool tables, a dart 
 board and a bar. It also has a garden 
 where you can sunbathe on a sunny day.
 Across the road from the Lynhurst     
 there is a field with ponies and      
 donkeys in it. Next to it there are   
 Municipal bowling greens, putting,    
 tennis courts and a BMX bike course.  
 In the summer the fair comes to the   
 public park which is just 200 yards   
 away from the Lynhurst Hotel.         
 The Lynhurst is the ideal place for a 
 holiday in Johnstone for a family.
