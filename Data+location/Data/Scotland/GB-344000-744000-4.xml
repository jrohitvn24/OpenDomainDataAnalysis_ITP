 The land in this area is of a good    
 quality but needs more drainage.Some  
 of the fields have been drained but   
 others have to use the deep ditches on
 each side of the road.                
    The farmers plant a mixture of     
 crops.The crops are spring            
 barley,winter barley,turnips,potatoes,
 grass and oil seed rape which means   
 there is lots of work at all seasons. 
    The farmer has a mixture of        
 animals.The main type of sheep is the 
 Blackface.There are two kinds of      
 cattle,the Hereford and the Fresian.  
 The sheep are kept mostly for their   
 wool and the cattle are kept to be    
 fattened up and sold at the market  in
 Forfar or Perth.
