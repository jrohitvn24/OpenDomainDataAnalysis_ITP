		<content>{RUNNING                               
  I often go running and I like it as  
 long as I don't get stitches and feel 
 very sore.                            
  A special kind of gentle running is  
 called jogging and I like jogging I   
 once jogged one mile and a half and   
 when I come home I was very tired.    
{HILL WALKING                          
  Hill walking is my hobby and it is   
 very good fun. I go up to the top of a
 very steep hills and I am tired by    
 the time I go to the top and come back
 down again to my house.               
  It is worth it all when you get to   
 the top and can see the scenery for   
 miles around.On certain hills when it 
 is sunny and clear you can see        
 Inverness.                            
  You must always wear suitable clothes
 and shoes,take a map and tell someone 
 where you are going.                  </content>
