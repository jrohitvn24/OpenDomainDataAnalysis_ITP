		<title>18WILDLIFE IN INVERUGIE</title>
		<content> Although few people realise it,       
 wildlife abounds in the Inverugie     
 area. In the river itself, besides    
 salmon and trout, there are eels,     
 lampreys and even freshwater mussels: 
 pearl fishers used to be common on the
 Ugie. The wide variety of birds       
 includes game-birds such as pheasants 
 and partridges and birds of prey such 
 as kestrels, sparrowhawks and owls.   
 The magpie population has increased   
 over the years. Varieties of ducks    
 vary with the season- mallards,       
 golden-eyed ducks and sometimes       
 visiting merganzers. An off-course    
 flamingo was even seen in the area!   
 River-side mammals include otters,    
 mink, stoats, moles, bats, rabbits,   
 hedgehogs and several  varieties of   
 rodents. Further afield there are roe 
 deer, foxes and badgers.
