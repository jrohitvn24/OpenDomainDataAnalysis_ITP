		<content> This area has two distinctly          
 contrasting types of land and the land
 use.   On the western coast of the    
 island rise the steep rugged cliffs of
 Uragaig Pensinsula and "Pigs          
 Paradise"; the formers shoreline      
 riddled with caves the latters cliffs 
 covered in spring with seabirds nests.
 The land immediatly inland of thisd   
 and surrounding the reservoir is      
 roughly grazed by blackface sheep and 
 some cattle.   Ground cover is mostly 
 heather &amp; rough grass.   To the SE the
 lowlying land is a well protected     
 inland area of pasture, arable and    
 planted woodland, which is not worked 
 at present, the microclimate created  
 by warm tempretures and protection    
 from the wind provides for a garden of
 exotic trees &amp; shrubs particularly    
 early flowering Rhodedendrons and     
 Azaleas.   Here is the  home farm,    </content>
