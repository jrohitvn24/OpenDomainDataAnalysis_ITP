		<content> The world has been trying to help the 
 famine in Ehtiopia. Oxfam, Christian  
 Aid and other charities have worked   
 nonstop, trying to relieve the famine.
 It was caused by a mixture of civil   
 war and drought. The soldiers fighting
 intercept the food lorries because    
 they to need the food. This makes the 
 situation worse.Room 14 in our school 
 were doing a project on newspapers.   
 This was the main article in the news 
 and their efforts triggered a school  
 wide campaign. Every Monday, members  
 of Room 14 have a collection, going   
 round all the classes. Four primary 7 
 girls organised and held a jumble sale
 which raised 154.06 pounds. The total 
 amount raised by the school is 825.01 
 pounds so far. The school also knits  
 jumpers for the babies and squares for
 blankets.     Gwen Milligan.
