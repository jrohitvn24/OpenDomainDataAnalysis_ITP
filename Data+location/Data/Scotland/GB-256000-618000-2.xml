    The companies and industries that  
 are the biggest in Cumnock and Doon   
 Valley are textiles, carpet           
 manufacturers and the Coal Board.     
                                       
    The jobs that are disappearing in  
 the area are in skilled building      
 trades.  The industries in the area   
 that have been expanding in the last  
 few years are textiles, Bata          
 (shoeworkers) clothing                
 manufacturers and farming.            
                                       
 We hope that they can expand even     
 further in the next few years.
