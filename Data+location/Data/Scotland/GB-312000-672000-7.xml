 When we went out we did a survey on   
 Clothes.We found out that people      
 mostly wear jeans or trousers and     
 they also feel comfortable in jeans   
 and a jumper.They mostly wear black   
 and they buy most of their clothes    
 from Topman/Topshop.In our area most  
 teenagers make their own decision     
 about what they buy.If it is a child  
 the mum normally makes the choice of  
 the clothes that they wear.People     
 nowadays do not mind if the colours   
 that they are wearing contrast or if  
 they are not in the fashion.          
 In Hillwood Primary 14 boys wear      
 school uniform and only 7 girls.We    
 think this is because boys usually    
 wear a shirt with a collar which looks
 odd without a tie.
