		<content>  During Christian Aid Week a sponsored
 walk up Oxen Craig by 300 people      
 raised over Â£700.Shortly after that a 
 "Hungry Sunday Lunch", where each     
 contributor donated the cost of a     
 meal,raised Â£190.                     
  And just as "Gala Week" was beginning
 the Senior Youth Club held a "Line of 
 Pennies" fund raising effort, which   
 realised Â£73.This money will be used  
 to pay the expenses of their trip to  
 Edinburgh.                            
  The first event of the Gala was the  
 Sheep Dog Trials.The sheep,known as   
 hoggs,were in groups of three and the 
 dogs were hardly fit to control them.A
 few competitors eventually managed to 
 pen the sheep! The same day,Sunday,saw
 an "It's a Knockout" competition      
 between local teams.This proved to be 
 great fun aided by a sunny afternoon.
