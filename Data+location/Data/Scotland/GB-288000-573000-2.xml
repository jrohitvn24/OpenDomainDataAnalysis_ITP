 MY CORD JEANS,SHIRT AND JERSEY,WASH   
 AND GO DOWNSTAIRS FOR BREAKFAST.I HAVE
 A BOWL OF KELLOG'S FROSTIES AND A MUG 
 OF HOT ORANGE JUICE.WHEN I HAVE       
 FINISHED I GO OUTSIDE TO PLAY UNTIL   
 MUM IS READY TO DRIVE MARK,LESLEY AND 
 ME TO SCHOOL.AT SCHOOL WE HAVE THREE  
 INTERVALS,TWO OF TWENTY MINUTES AND AN
 HOUR AT LUNCH-TIME.MY FAVOURITE       
 SUBJECTS ARE READING,GYMN AND MATHS.  
 AFTER SCHOOL I CHANGE INTO MY PLAY    
 CLOTHES AND HELP DAD ON THE FARM.FOR  
 TEA I USUALLY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE     
 STEAK AND POTATO OR FISH AND CHIPS.I  
 GO OUT TO PLAY OR STAY IN AND WATCH   
 TELEVISION.ABOUT 08.30 I GO UPSTAIRS  
 AND BRUSH MY TEETH,CHANGE INTO MY     
 PYJAMAS,SAY MY PRAYERS AND GET INTO   
 BED.
