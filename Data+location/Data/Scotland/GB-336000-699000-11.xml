		<title>11       Letham Glen</title>
		<content> Letham Glen is one of Levens main     
 attractions,this year it celebrated   
 its 60th aniversary.We interviewed Mr 
 Muszynski a park warden. He told us   
 the Glen was opened by Mr John Letham 
 who financed it and gave it its name. 
 Previously the Glen was classed as    
 common ground and called Spinkie Den  
 (Spinkie_a Scots word for primroses)  
   There was a swimming pool used by   
 soldiers during World War 2 but it was
 filled in because of neglect.It was   
 then converted into sunken gardens.   
    The Glen is great for birdwatching,
 rare birds like the Siskin and Redpole
 can be spotted.In winter the deer,    
 goats,guinea pigs,rabbits and donkeys 
 shelter in their huts. The stream is  
 natural and long ago provided power   
 for Scotlands only ochre mill.This    
 ochre was used to paint houses and    
 mark sheep.                           </content>
