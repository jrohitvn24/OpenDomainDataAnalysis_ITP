		<title>10BROUGHTY FERRY - TRADE</title>
		<content>  Today Broughty Ferry has a bustling  
 shopping centre with many specialist  
 shops in which to browse. Its fine    
 sea-front provides for many water     
 sports such as swimming, boating and  
 wind-surfing.                         
   Broughty Ferry could be described as
 a self-contained shopping and business
 centre, developed around the old      
 fishing village. It provides a full   
 range of services and amenities with  
 much to interest the holiday-maker.   
  The traders of Broughty Ferry get    
 most of their custom from two main    
 sources. On an all year round basis   
 there is a large local population,    
 many of whom work elsewhere, mainly   
 Dundee, and commute from Broughty     
 Ferry. In addition there is an influx 
 of holiday-makers during the summer   
 months.                               
                                       </content>
