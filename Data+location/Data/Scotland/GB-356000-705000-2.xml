		<content> Kilrenny Church has stood on this site
 for many hundreds of years.  A "culdee
 chapel" was built here in the l2th    
 Century.  The monks of Dryburgh owned 
 the Church of Kilrenny and three shops
 in Anstruther.                        
                                       
 James Melville, when he was minister  
 of Kilrenny Church had his manse built
 in east Anstruther.  In the churchyard
 General Scott of Balcomie is buried.  
 General Scott was a great gambler even
 in the l8th Century.  He is known to  
 have won nearly half a million pounds.
                                       
 In the centre of the village is the   
 old mansion house of Innergellie which
 belonged to the Lumsdaine Family.
