		<content>  Most aspects of Stromness trade are  
 boosted by the many tourists who come 
 to stay a week or come for a day trip 
 on the St Ola. The tourist season is  
 quite long and the Folk Festival and  
 St Magnus Festival bring extra people.
 Local GIFT SHOPS : Hanleys,Bremners,  
 BAKERS:Stockans,Argos, BUTCHERS:Fletts
 all benefit as do the many B&amp;Bs and   
 HOTELS.Some eg Wisharts hire out bikes
 while cars are hired out by eg Blue   
 Star Garage. Buses can take people on 
 tours to places of interest throughout
 Orkney. Within the town, they can     
 enjoy the cobbled and flagstone street
 shared by two-way vehicle transport   
 and pedestrians.Up some of the        
 interesting little closes they may    
 find an old Book Shop eg Books and    
 Prints or a Restaurant eg Hamnavoe.
