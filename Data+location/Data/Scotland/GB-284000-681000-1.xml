		<content> The area concerned lies 25-35 metres  
 above sea level on raised beaches left
 after the Ice Age. The soil is mainly 
 sand and gravel. The{landscape}is     
 fairly flat. The River Carron meanders
 eastward towards the Firth of Forth   
 through green fields and past areas of
 industrial development e.g. Lochlands 
 Industrial Estate. There were many{   
{coal}deposits in this area, but those 
 in the immediate vicinity are no      
 longer in use. The availability of    
 such supplies were instrumental in the
 placing of the Carron{Iron}Works at   
 Stenhousemuir in 1759.{Local history }
 says that "Arthur's Oon" a perfect    
 example of Roman architecture was     
 destroyed by Sir Michael Bruce in     
 order to use the stone for a dam for  
 Carron{Iron}Works.
