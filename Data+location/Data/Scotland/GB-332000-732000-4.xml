		<content> There is a disused corn mill adjacent 
 to a stream from which it obtained    
 power.The condition of the mill is    
 now poor and major renovation is      
 required.                             
        The landscape is one typical of
 the whole area. Fields with cash crops
 being the main land covering.         
        Only 28 people inhabit the     
 village 40% of whom are of retiral age
 or over.                              
        The approaches to the village  
 are impressive with the Castle and the
 Church particularly dominant features.
        Within the Village the winding 
 road presents a constantly changing   
 sequence of views and all the         
 buildings are set against the densely 
 wooded Fowlis Den.
