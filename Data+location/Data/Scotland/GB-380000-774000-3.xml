		<content> Increased mechanisation has sadly led 
 to a decrease in the labour force.  40
 years ago 1 man could work app. 50    
 acres while now he can cope with 200  
 acres.  Farming relies mainly on the  
{tractor.}The average tractor has 4    
 wheel drive, 100 hp, up to 20 gears   
 and costs over Â£20,000. It is used to 
 push and pull implements through the  
 soil. Weeds and diseases are kept at  
 bay by spraying a weak solution of    
 weedkiller and fungicide through a    
 crop sprayer on the tractor - the seed
 drill can also sow the fertiliser.    
 Grain is harvested by combine         
 harvester; turnips, potatoes or grass 
 by smaller harvesters attached to a   
 tractor. With the high cost of        
 machinery farmers find it less        
 expensive to hire specialised         
 machinery from an Agricultural        
 Contractor.                           </content>
