		<content> There are several features of         
 ecological interest in the landscape  
 between Kinglassie and Auchterderran. 
 1. A{rookery}is to be found in the    
 grounds of Kinglassie House.          
 2. One of the boundary hedges beside  
 Craigside Plantation is a{hornbeam}   
{hedge.}This type of hedge is native to
 south east England and it is unusual  
 to find such a hedge in Scotland.     
 3. A locality in this area was        
 confirmed in 1983 as the only         
 recorded site in Scotland of the{Great
{Crested Newt.                         
 4.{The Lochty Burn}is severely        
{polluted with ferruginous waste}from  
 the Westfield Coal Mining Complex.    
 This gives the water in the burn a red
 colour and the water is void of any   
 life.
