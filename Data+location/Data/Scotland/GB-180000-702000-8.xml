		<content>   Although the block lies within two  
 parishes the Kilmartin side is almost 
 unpopulated so reference is made only 
 to Craignish Parish  Church (dated    
 1826) in Ardfern village.             
   As the minister also serves the     
 parish of Kilninver-Kilmelford, only  
 the morning service (and a Sunday     
 School) is held here. The minister    
 covers a very wide area visiting the  
 elderly, those in hospital and the    
 bereaved. He is a regular caller at   
 local schools and involves himself in 
 all aspects of the local community    
 including the yachtsmen.              
   Within the last year there have been
 3 baptisms and 3 funeral or memorial  
 services. The last wedding service was
 about two years ago. The church has   
 no graveyard.Burials at Kilvaree (3   
 miles) cremations at Cardross or Clyde
 -Bank (almost 100 miles away!).       </content>
