		<title>20THE MEDIA IN STEWARTON</title>
		<content> Few homes in the area do not have at  
 least one television and many have    
 more than one. Video recorders are now
 very popular too and so selective     
 viewing becomes possible and          
 progrommes are now watched at         
 convenient times instead of when they 
 are recorded.Schools find this very   
 useful.Music centres and radios are   
 favourites with the young. Programmes 
 are presented from early morning till 
 late at night. The four channels are  
 watched. A local young man, Robin     
 Cameron, stars in "Take The High Road"
 on Scottish Television and at least   
 three work in the Glasgow studios. The
 local radio station often transmits   
 from Stewarton and a few residents    
 work with this station-on 261 channel.
