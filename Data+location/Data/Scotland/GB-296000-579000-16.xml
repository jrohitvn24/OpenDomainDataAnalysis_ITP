 The farmer had pig sheds which are no 
 longer used because its uneconomic and
 they use them for the young lambs.    
 The lambs are kept indoors for about 2
 or 3 days until they are strong enough
 to go into the fields.                
  The farmer also keeps 80{Beef Cattle}
 He used to have a{Hereford Bull}but   
 now he is experimenting with a{       
{Charollais Bull.}He changed because he
 did'nt get enough money out of the    
 Hereford Bull.                        
  In winter he keeps the young calves  
 indoors from October to April.  He    
 built a shed 14 years ago which holds 
 100 calves.  The mothers are kept     
 outside in the winter.  They are fed  
 turnips.  His oldest cow is 17 years  
 old.  Normally he sells the mothers   
 when they are 12 years old. All in all
 farming has changed from long ago.    </content>
