		<content> (until) quarter to twelve.When my dad 
 heard about it he said I was'nt to go 
 to another disco.But a few days later 
 he let me go to another one.The only  
 reason was because I recorded a war   
 film about Vietnam called "Apocolypse 
 Now"for him.                          
 I suppose he gets a lot of money for  
 what he does but thats none of my     
 buisness so I don't ask.              
 However we eat quite well and we have 
 a lot of videos so he must get a lot. 
 We eat mostly Chinese food or steaks  
 because thats what we have always     
 liked.                                
 My mum doesn't really mind him being  
 away but she does miss him.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
