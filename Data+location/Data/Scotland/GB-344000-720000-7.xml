		<title>07SOME HISTORICAL RUINS</title>
		<content> Castle Knowe is a mound in a field    
 owned by a farmer called Mr Mitchell. 
 We have heard that Robert the Bruce   
 lived in the castle for a short time. 
 The ruins of the castle cause problems
 for Mr Mitchell because the yew trees,
 that mark the site of the castle are  
 poisonous to livestock.  The areas are
 fenced off but are obstacles to       
 cultivating and harvesting machinery. 
 We found out from the New Statistical 
 Account (about 1830) that it was      
 originally a strong-hold of the Earl  
 of Fife but was dismantled by the     
 English in the 14th Century.  Also on 
 Mr Mitchells land is a Doocot which   
 was used for pigeons (especially for  
 messenger pigeons) but is not used    
 now.  It is also an obstacle to       
 cultivation and is made of sandstone  
 and whinstone.                        
                                       </content>
