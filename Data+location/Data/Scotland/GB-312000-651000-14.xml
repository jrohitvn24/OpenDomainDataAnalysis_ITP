		<title>14LAW AND ORDER</title>
		<content>       Ours is a laww abiding community
 as we have very little crime.         
   The most common crime in 1984 was   
 housebreaking. We had 22 cases. We    
 also had 15 cases of breaking in with 
 nothing stolen. 15 cases of simple    
 theft and  8 cars were broken into.   
 The figures for this year so far are  
 very much lower.                      
   Most of the breakins happened to    
 large houses which were isolated and  
 were sheltered by trees etc. giving   
 the thieves maximum cover.            
   Modern thieves travel in cars or    
 vans and usually come from the city.  
 They are well organised and take      
 either money or goods that are easily 
 sold. They look just like anyone else.
   There is a lot of poaching in the   
 area,mainly for fish and hares. Again 
 the poachers use transport and make a 
 lot of money selling their catch.     </content>
