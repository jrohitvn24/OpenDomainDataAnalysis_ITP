		<content> Longforgan boasts a thriving Scottish 
 Women's Rural Institute which has     
 recently celebrated its Golden        
 Jubilee. The "Rural" as it is known   
 has a meeting every month in the      
 Bowlers' Hall, consisting of arts and 
 crafts demonstrations, and talks of   
 local and national interest. We are   
 very lucky to still have two founder  
 members, a little infirm perhaps, but 
 always interested in our doings. At   
 our recent birthday party, one of them
 gave us a most interesting insight    
 into what life was like at the time   
 our Institute started, and on into the
 war years, telling of how they coped  
 and made-do in the years of shortage  
 after the war. This year we now have a
 choir and entertainment group, and an 
 icing class, and later on we will have
 an art class. We try to live up to our
 motto "For Home and Country".         </content>
