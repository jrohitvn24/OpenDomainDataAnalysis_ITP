		<title>15NEW ABBEY - LOCAL HISTORY(2)</title>
		<content>   Sweetheart Abbey was founded in 1273
 by Lady Devorgilla,a daughter of Alan,
 Lord of Galloway and the widow of John
 Balliol. This noble lady had the heart
 of her husband embalmed and placed in 
 an ivory casket which accompanied her 
 everywhere.                           
   The Abbey was occupied by Cistercian
 monks who farmed the land, and bred   
 horses,cattle and sheep. It was called
 the "new" abbey because of its sister 
 abbey at Dundrennan.                  
   When Lady Devorgilla died in 1289   
 the casket was buried with her and the
 monks renamed the abbey Dulce Cor, the
 Abbey of Sweet Heart.                 
   After the Reformation the monks were
 dispersed and the abbey gradually fell
 into ruin,a process hastened by a huge
 fire sometime during the 18th century.
   Today the ruined Abbey dominates the
 village just as it did in the past.   </content>
