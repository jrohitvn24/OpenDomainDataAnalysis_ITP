		<title>12CHILD'S VIEW 1-S OF BARRHEAD</title>
		<content> We are very fortunate to live in an   
 area like{Barrhead}which is on the    
 out-skirts of{Glasgow.}We have many   
 facilities close at hand but just as  
 important we have the countryside on  
 our doorstep. One of the most         
 attractive spots in our countryside   
 is the{'Craigie'}hill with the        
{Glanderston Dam}at its foot.          
                                       
 The history of the Craigie goes back  
 to{Iron Age}times when there was a    
 settlement there called{Duncarnock.   
 Through the years its name has changed
 to the{Craigie}which, because of lack 
 of information in books, we can only  
 presume comes from the word{CRAG,     
 meaning{'hilly rock'.
