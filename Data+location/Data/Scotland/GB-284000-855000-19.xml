		<title>19NAIRN:THE PEOPLE</title>
		<content> Nairnites are very much like the rest 
 of Scots but are probably more        
 conservative than most as might be    
 expected in a small town.             
    A fair number of people attend     
 church. Most are Presbyterian but     
 there are also Roman Catholics and    
 Episcopalians.                        
    Much of our area has 'incomers'    
 often attracted by work at the nearby 
 oil platform construction yard and    
 these people have diluted what must   
 have been a close knit well structured
 community.                            
    Nairn's dialect is close to but    
 distinct from that of Inverness.It    
 contrasts markedly with that of       
 North_east Scotland.                  
    Likewise the people (locals and    
 incomers alike) have a friendly,      
 laid-back approach which is quite     
 different from towns to the east.     </content>
