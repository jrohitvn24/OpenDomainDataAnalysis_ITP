		<title>09PETERHEAD PRISON</title>
		<content>   Peterhead Prison at Invernettie was 
 opened in 1888. From the opening of   
 the prison, until about 1955, a large 
 party of prisoners was  conveyed each 
 weekday by private railway to a quarry
 at Stirling Hill.Here they excavated  
 and dressed granite required for      
 building the Harbour of Refuge.       
   Nowadays, however, convicts are     
 employed in worksheds practising      
 skills they might require in industry 
 when liberated.                       
   Plans have been passed to build a   
 new prison in the near future on the  
 same grounds.At the moment, there are 
 approximately 200 inmates accommodated
 in this maximum security prison.
