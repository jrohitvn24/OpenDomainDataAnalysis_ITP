		<title>01The Land around Loch Nell</title>
		<content> The Loch Nell - Glen Lonan area is    
 agriculturally bassen, being mainly   
 composed of rough hill grazing        
 supporting sheep and cattle.  Parts   
 are boggy &amp; the moorland covered with 
 heathes, bracken, myrtle, mosses &amp;    
 coarse grasses.  A freshwater loch is 
 fed by hill streams, and contains     
 salmon and sea trout.  There are a few
 small farms an some modern bungalows  
 to the south of the area, several     
 being only 'Holiday' homes.  Rooms and
 caravans are let to summer visitors:  
 ponies are kept for trekking.  A      
 single-track road with 'Passing       
 Places' undulates across the area.    
 There are some deciduous trees-oak,   
 ash, older, birch &amp; Rowan.            
 Tree-felling &amp; Re-Planting is carried 
 out among the pine forests.  In early 
 summer the roadsides are beautiful    
 with wild irises, dog roses &amp; Foxglove</content>
