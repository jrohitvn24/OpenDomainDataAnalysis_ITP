		<content> Girdleness lighthouse stands on the   
 promonotory to the south of Aberdeen  
 Harbour.It was built for the          
 "Commissioners of the Northern Lights"
 and is one of the few Victorian       
 buildings in Aberdeen constructed on  
 behalf of non-Aberdonians.            
 The lighthouse was designed by Robert 
 Stevenson,grandfather of the writer   
 Robert Louis Stevenson.               
 Built to a height of 131 feet it      
 affords a magnificent view of the city
 and surrounding coastline for those   
 fit enough to climb the 189 steps.    
 The light was first operated in       
 October 1833 and in 1890 the present  
 revolving light was installed.This    
 flashes twice every 20 seconds and can
 be seen out to sea 19 miles away in   
 good conditions.                      
 However Aberdeen, like many towns on  
 the eastern seaboard of Scotland      </content>
