		<title>17The Oil Industry and Aboyne</title>
		<content> The discovery of oil in the North Sea 
 has had a major effect on the north of
 Scotland.  The oil{industry}is one of 
 the main reasons for the rapid        
 increase in developments and          
{population}in Aboyne.  The oil        
 industry has brought a lot more work  
 into the area.  In a survey carried   
 out on one street of seventeen owner  
 occupied houses it was discovered that
 in eleven out of the seventeen        
 households the{employment}of the main 
 wage earner was in the{oil industry.} 
 From 1961 to 1971 the increase in the 
 population of Aboyne was only 28, from
 1012 to 1040.  From 1971 to 1981 there
 was a population increase of 489 from 
 1040 to 1529, showing that the        
 discovery of oil in the North Sea had 
 a dramatic effect on the number of    
 people living in Aboyne.
