		<title>01LIFE IN EDAY</title>
		<content>    Eday is one of the smaller north   
 isles of Orkney. It has a central     
 position and a population of roughly  
 140 people.                           
    The area contained within this     
 block is mostly hill land with many   
 birds nesting along the cliffs and    
 seals in the surrounding sea.         
    The land is used for farming,      
 mainly beef and sheep with some barley
 grown. There are one or two fairly    
 large farms and many small crofts.    
    Much of the land has recently been 
 fenced and some of the rough hill land
 has been cultivated as grazing.       
    There is a considerable amount of  
 peat on this land which is used as the
 main source of heating on the island. 
 The peat is cut in the late spring    
 and, given favourable weather         
 conditions, brought down from the hill
 in late summer.                       </content>
