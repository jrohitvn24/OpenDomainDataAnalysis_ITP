		<title>08ELPHINSTONE NATURE TRAIL</title>
		<content> IN  ELPHINSTONE THERE IS A NATURE     
 TRAIL. IT STARTS  AT THE GRAVEYARD. ON
 THE WAY TO THE TRAIL THERE IS A GOOD  
 SPOT  FOR  BIRD WATCHING. YOU CAN SEE 
 GULLS, LAPWINGS, KESTRELS AND A       
 SPARROW HAWK. YOU MAY ALSO SEE FIELD  
 MICE AND RABBITS. THEN  YOU  WILL COME
 TO  AN  OLD  RAILWAY WHICH IS LINED   
 WITH  TREES ON BOTH SIDES. THE        
 SLEEPERS LOOK LIKE BIG STEPS NOW.     
 THERE WAS A BURN  WHICH  HAS BEEN     
 FILLED IN TO STOP THE DUMPING OF      
 LITTER BUT PEOPLE  STILL DUMP THINGS  
 THERE. YOU  THEN WALK ACROSS  TOWARDS 
 THE LIE. THERE IS FROGSPAWN  IN       
 SPRING. THE CHILDREN IN ELPHINSTONE   
 LOVE TO GO ON WALKS TO SEE THE        
 WILDLIFE. AT ONE TIME THE LIE WAS     
 DRIED UP. NOW IT HAS FILLED UP AGAIN. 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
