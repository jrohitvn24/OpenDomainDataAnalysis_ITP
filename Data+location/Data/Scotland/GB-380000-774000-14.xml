		<content> The sparse population of the area     
 belies the use made of the{village    
{hall. }The Church uses it for         
 Congregational Meetings, Sunday School
 and Women's Guild.  The Playgroup     
 meets there twice a week; the Women's 
 Rural Institute once a month; and the 
 Life boat Guild has at least one      
 meeting each year. The hall is used as
 a polling station.  A committee of    
 local people run the hall and various 
 events are organised to fundraise,    
 especially at present, when an        
 extension is planned with the aid of a
 Regional grant. Events range from     
 sales of work, auctions, dances, and  
 keep fit sessions.  In November, local
 craft workers hold an Advent Sale     
 which helps to draw people into the   
 area.  The hall is a wet weather haven
 for campers, Guides and B.B.s who     
 often camp on Arbuthnott Estate.      </content>
