		<title>20TOURISM IN DALRY(KIRK)</title>
		<content>    Many tourists pass through this    
 scenic area in summer and stop to     
 admire the attractive houses and      
 gardens.In winter increasing numbers  
 of bird watchers are coming. Most are 
 from the north of England but the area
 is also popular with German and       
 Scandinavian visitors. Tourists from  
 Australasia and the Americas often    
 come to visit relatives or to trace   
 ancestors.                            
    The opening of the Southern Upland 
 Way, which passes through Dalry,has   
 resulted in increasing numbers of     
 walkers seeking provisions and        
 overnight accomodation.               
    There is an hotel,an inn and a     
 cafe in Dalry and several houses      
 provide excellent bed and breakfast at
 reasonable cost.
