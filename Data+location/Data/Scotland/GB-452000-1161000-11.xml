		<title>11THE FERRY TO THE MAINLAND</title>
		<content> Our ferry is the{Hendra.}We got it in 
 1982.But before that,up to 1975,we had
 the{Earl of Zetland.}Each week it made
 3 runs up from Lerwick and 3 back also
 going to Unst,Yell &amp; Fetlar.It had a  
 crane for loading/unloading all cars &amp;
 freight.                              
  In 1975 the ro-ro ferry{Fylga}was    
 based here.At first it ran to Lerwick 
 until the ramps at Laxo and Vidlin    
 were built.The Fylga could take 12    
 cars across the sound in 35mins.,50   
 mins.to Vidlin in bad S.E. weather.   
  The Hendra replaced the Fylga,can    
 take 18 cars and crosses in 25-30mins.
  There is a crew of 4 who all live    
 on Whalsay.The Hendra makes 6 return  
 trips each day,starting out from      
 Whalsay at 6.45am,the last run from   
 the mainland to Whalsay at 6.00pm. In 
 summer there are some extra runs in   
 the evening.                          </content>
