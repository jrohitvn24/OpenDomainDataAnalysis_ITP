		<title>02A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JONI</title>
		<content>                                       
 A typical day for me begins by being  
 wakened at eight o clock by my Mum. I 
 often doze off again until 8.30.      
 Getting up I wash, then sit down to   
 breakfast of cereal and orange juice .
 At 8.50 I set off for school which    
 starts at 9 o' clock. In class,       
 spelling,ten a day,reading 360 scheme 
 are completed before play time at     
 10.30. During this I play with most of
 the girls in my class at "jump,       
 split,jump", which is elastic bands   
 joined together.                      
                                       
 After play-time we do maths until     
 lunch time ,when I go home to have    
 soup a ham sandwich and  coca-cola. In
 the afternoon I do project work until 
 3.30 when I go home.  Changing my     
 clothes I go jogging with my friend   
 Amanda, until I'm called in for tea.  </content>
