		<title>13TRAFFIC IN LIVINGSTON SOUTH</title>
		<content> On 25th June 1985 we went to the{A71, 
{West Calder Road,}to take a traffic   
 census. We started at 9.40am.and      
 finished at 9.50am. During that time  
 we saw 84 cars, 1 private coach, 15   
 lorries, 19 vans, 9 trucks, 1         
 caravanette, 1 cycle,1 police car,    
 1 cement mixer, and 1 skip. Although  
 this was not a peak time the road was 
 very busy. The longest time we had to 
 wait for a vehicle to pass was 15     
 seconds. We also contacted the{Road   
{Safety Department}who gave us accident
 figures for the whole of{Livingston,  
 and for the stretch of road between   
 the{Wilderness Roundabout(Bellsquarry)
 and the{Lizzie Brice Roundabout}on    
 which we did our census. These were   
 respectively 357 accidents in 1983.   
 In 1984, 380 accidents. Three         
 accidents in 1983 and 5 including 1   
 fatality (a woman cyclist) in 1984.   </content>
