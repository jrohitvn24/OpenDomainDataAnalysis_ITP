 The remains of the 16th Century Church
 and Churchyard of St.Tarquin have been
 repaired and vaults and canopied tombs
 restored.Ivy,moss and other vegetation
 had to be cleared away to reveal      
 lettering,coats of arms, etc.,and a   
 new roof has been put on the          
 Abercromby Vault which contains a     
 marble monument.The chamber above the 
 great porch,with the village prison   
 beneath,has been restored and the bell
 from the ancient belfry has been      
 recast and now peals from the new     
 church.The last burial in the old     
 cemetery was in 1965,although ashes   
 were brought from a cremation in      
 Canada and were laid there in 1976.   
 The new cemetery was first used in    
 1921 and both are kept attractive by  
 the local gravedigger and 2 assistants</content>
