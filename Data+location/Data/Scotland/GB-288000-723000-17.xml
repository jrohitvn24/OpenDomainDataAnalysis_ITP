		<content>   There are three sites of extractive 
 industry in this area.  These are     
 Cultoquhey Quarry, Muckleburn Quarry  
 and the gravel pit.  All of these are 
 now disused, but in the past they     
 provided the local area with building 
 materials.                            
   At Cultoquhey Quarry slate was mined
 as was the case at Muckleburn.  Both  
 these quarries were readily accessible
 to a means of transportation.  The    
 gravel pit supplied a road laying     
 surface locally, but has been closed  
 for a number of years.                
   Although not in use these quarries  
 are still clearly visible and the     
 stone is still occasionally used by   
 the farmers for the purpose of        
 building dry stone dykes or building  
 rough farm tracks.
