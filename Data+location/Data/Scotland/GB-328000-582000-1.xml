		<title>01Upland Farms, Dumfriesshire</title>
		<content> The area is upland farming country    
 reached by taking one of 2 farm roads 
 off the B7068. It includes 2 farms,   
 Clenchfoot &amp; Westwater, their relevant
 buildings &amp; workers cottages. They    
 specialise in animals, cattle &amp; sheep,
 with just a few fields of winter      
 fodder. The land is partly enclosed by
 dry-stone walls &amp; the higher areas are
 left unfenced. There are many natural 
 boundaries formed by ridges &amp; gullies 
 with burns in them. There are very few
 dwellings in the area and no amenities
 There are clumps of forestation on the
 higher land which are not commercial  
 in origin &amp; probably acting as shelter
 but there are also large areas of     
 commercial forestation, all of a      
 coniferous nature. The 2 main         
 waterways are Glentenment burn &amp; Logan
 Water, the latter is being rerouted   
 during the building of the new road.  </content>
