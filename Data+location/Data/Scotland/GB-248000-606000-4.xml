		<content> Until about 1850 only a few people    
 lived and worked in the Cummock Valley
 as pastoral farmers.                  
                                       
                                       
 In the middle of last century coal    
 mining brought many to live in the    
 'rows' which sprang up near the       
 collieries.  At one time the          
 population must have numbered several 
 hundred and a school was built for the
 children.                             
                                       
                                       
 After 1945 a policy of rehousing the  
 inhabitants of these villages was     
 adopted.  The people were moved to    
 more modern dwellings in the main     
 settlements in the Doon Valley nearby.
