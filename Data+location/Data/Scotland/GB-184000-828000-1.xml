		<content> The A890 bisects this area.  to the   
 east is mainly Conchra Estate with    
 some forestry commission land in the  
 north.   To the west is part of       
 Auchtertyre Farm with private         
 afforestation in the north.  both     
 forestry areas are planted with       
 conifers.  The hills are mainly       
 heather and rough grazing, grazed by  
 sheep and cattle.  The river Udalain  
 has a hydro-electric dam at the south 
 which supplies Nost'e power station,  
 part of the National Grid.  It also   
 has a stock of brown trout. There are 
 red and roe deer on the hills and     
 wildcat and pine marten in the forest.
