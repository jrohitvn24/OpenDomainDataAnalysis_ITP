		<title>10Arbroath, Some views.</title>
		<content>       We interviewed several people in
 Arbroath about the town. About one    
 third of the people we spoke to were  
 holiday makers and said, Not          
 sufficient road signs, I just love the
 sea front, the people were friendly, a
 good holiday resort because there are 
 plenty of things for the children,eg, 
 crazy golf,tennis golf; amusement     
 arcade; baths; parks; miniature       
 railway,fishing trips and a children's
 disco." Others who lived in Arbroath  
 said ,"the new one way system is -    
 chaos, waste of money, confusing,     
 don't think much of it." The views    
 about about  our new supermarket were 
 varied'' very handy,nice but not      
 cheap,good parking.I don't think a lot
 of it, so-so , it depends,good". But  
 the nicest thing was that both holiday
 makers and people who lived here would
 not really want to change it at all.  </content>
