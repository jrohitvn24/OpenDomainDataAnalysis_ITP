		<title>13A Uyeasound Musician.</title>
		<content> Most Uyeasound musicians play the     
 fiddle but my Mum plays the double    
 bass with the Shetland Fiddlers.      
   She has been with the Shetland      
 Fiddlers for four years although she  
 has played the bass for thirteen      
 years,since she taught herself.The    
 Shetland Fiddlers leader asked her to 
 join them when they needed a bass     
 player.They practice in Lerwick each  
 Wednesday evening but the travelling  
 distance means Mum only gets to two   
 out of three of the practices.        
   The Shetland Fiddlers play at       
 Shetland concerts as well as making   
 radio and T.V. appearances.They have  
 also made records and appeared on the 
 Hamefarin video.They also go on       
 tour.In 1985 they will be playing at  
 Keith in June and Islay in July.During
 summer they will play for tourists at 
 the Summer Exhibition in Lerwick.     </content>
