		<content>   Apart from West Plean School, school
 rolls have almost halved in the area  
 during the last ten years. This has   
 meant a reduction in staff at the East
 Plean primary school and the head     
 mistress often finds herself having to
 teach a class. Shelterd Housing has   
 been provided in the village of Plean 
 to accommodate the increasing number  
 of old people.                        
   With the opening of super markets in
 the towns many of the small village   
 shops closed. There is no longer a    
 Co-operative society in Plean. The    
 premises have been taken over by      
 Pakistan families who run two general 
 stores that remain open until 9p.m.   
 seven days a week. Postal shopping is 
 popular in the area.
