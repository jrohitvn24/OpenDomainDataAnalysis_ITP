		<title>08Playgroup Interview</title>
		<content> Mrs Carol Johnston started the        
 playgroup.It started 2 years ago in   
 1983.The playgroup is Monday,Wednesday
 and Friday mornings for 2 hours. 9.00 
 to 11.00.They play with small toys,   
 plasticine ,they draw with paints and 
 crayons.Theer are 13 children in the  
 playgroup.Every mother helps.They     
 play in the hall where the playgroup's
 held.If it is nice they are taken to  
 the park They enjoy it most of the    
 time.They play well together most of  
 the time.Alister Moffat is the        
 youngest he is 2\ years old.It costs  
 alot to run a playgroup because of the
 rent of the hall and the heating.They 
 sometimes have a coffee evening or a  
 sale of work or a beatle drive to     
 raise the money.This would pay for new
 equipment that they need.Most of the  
 money will go to buy new toys.
