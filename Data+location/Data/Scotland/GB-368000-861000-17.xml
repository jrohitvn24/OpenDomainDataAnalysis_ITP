		<title>17A Hotel in Banff</title>

 **************************************
                                       
  There are many hotels in and around  
 the Banff area. One of these is The   
 Seafield. It survives on discos,      
 private functions and bar lunches.    
  The owner said that being your own   
 boss is hard work and time consuming, 
 but good fun. The customers that come 
 to the hotel come from all over Great 
 Britain and abroad. The hotel is      
 popular with teenagers because of the 
 dicos they hold there. At the moment  
 it is non-residential but plans are   
 being made to have bedrooms installed.
 The Seafield Hotel is open 7 days a   
 week. The bar closes at 12.00 on week 
 days and 12.30 at weekends.
