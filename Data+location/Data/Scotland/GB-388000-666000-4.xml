		<title>04LIFE AT THE LIGHTHOUSE</title>
		<content> WE ARE TWO GIRLS WHO LIVE AT ST ABBS  
 LIGHTHOUSE STATION. THE ST ABBS HEAD  
 LIGHTHOUSE WAS FIRST LIT ON 24TH      
 FEBRUARY 1862 AND IT STANDS ON THE    
 CLIFF EDGE 224 FEET ABOVE HIGH-WATER  
 MARK.IT WAS THE FIRST LIGHTHOUSE IN   
 SCOTLAND TO HAVE A FOG HORN.THERE ARE 
 THREE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPERS. WE BOTH LIKE
 LIVING ALTHOUGH IT IS LONELY AND CAN  
 BE DANGEROUS AT TIMES BECAUSE LOTS OF 
 JET PLANES FLY VERY LOW ACROSS THE    
 HEAD AND THE CLIFFS ARE VERY STEEP.   
 BOTH OUR DAD'S WORK AT THE WEATHER    
 STATION SWITCHING ON THE LIGHT AND    
 SWITCHING ON THE FOGHORN WHEN         
 NECESSARY.THEY HAVE  TO ANSWER THE    
 TELEPHONES AND THE BUZZER IN THE HOUSE
 . THEY HAVE TO WORK AT FUNNY WATCHES  
 10PM - 2AM,2AM-6AM,6AM-10AM,AND 10AM  
 -6PM. THEY ALSO CHECK THE ENGINES AND 
 THE GENERATORS IN CASE OF A POWER CUT.
 THEY DO "SPEAKS" TO THE FORTH ROCKS . </content>
