		<content>   The village has historical          
  associations with the biographer     
 James Boswell(1740 - 1795).In 1978 the
 Auchinleck Boswell Society restored   
 from ruins,the old church and created 
 the Boswell Museum.Attached to the    
 museum is the Boswell Mausoleum,the   
 family's burial vault.                
   A corner of the Museum has been     
 arranged to commemorate the work of   
 William Murdoch(1754 - 1839),the      
 inventor of gas lighting,who was born 
 at Lugar,in the Parish of Auchinleck. 
   The Museum is situated next to      
 the Barony Church in the south east   
 corner of the village.                
   Within the churchyard is a memorial 
 to Richard Cameron and other famous   
 Covenanters.Cameron and his group were
 captured at Aird's Moss,N.E. of       
 Auchinleck after publishing the       
 Sanquhar Declaration (1680).          </content>
