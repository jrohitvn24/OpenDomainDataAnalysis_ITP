{The Playhouse Cinema - }A great loss  
 was the Playhouse Cinema, designed by 
 Major Cattenach of Kingussie and      
 opened by Mr. J. McEwen MP in June    
 1937. Demolition commenced in May     
 1985. It was one of the best equipped 
 cinemas on the east coast, holding up 
 to 1021 people. In 1937 admission     
 prices were 1/6 for the balcony,      
 rising to 65p when it closed. Four    
 managers spanned the 48 years of it's 
 existence: Mr A Davidson, Mr Rodgers, 
 Mr Hooper and finally Mr Smith. The   
 cinema closed in 1974. The cinema was 
 only used once after that - to play   
 host for the last picture show, held  
 by the Rotary Club of Dunbar on 24/11/
 84. 'Never Say Never                  
 Again' was chosen to be the last      
 picture.                              </content>
