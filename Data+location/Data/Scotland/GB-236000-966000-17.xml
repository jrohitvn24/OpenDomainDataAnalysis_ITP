		<content>{BOMBING  }Durness lies beside the Cape
 Wrath bombing range. When the R.A.F.  
 or Navy are using the range (usually  
 in the winter and spring) shock waves 
 come from the explosions which shake  
 the area. Many people have complained 
 about damage to property. A public    
 meeting in 1984 suceeded in reducing  
 the size of the bombs dropped and low 
 flying over the village.              
{SCHOOLING }Children must go to Dornoch
  or Golspie  128km away for secondary 
 education.  Hostel accomodation is    
 provided from Sunday to Thursday      
 night. Parents are concerned about the
 social implications of being seperated
 from their children and the effect    
 this has on their education. Several  
 attempts have been made to get a      
 secondary school for the NW. The most 
 recent(June1985) is for a four year   
 secondary at Kinlochbervie, 29km away.</content>
