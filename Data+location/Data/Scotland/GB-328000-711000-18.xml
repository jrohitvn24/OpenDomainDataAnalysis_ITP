		<content> Kinloch house was gifted by the       
 Hutchison family to the Church of     
 Scotland to be used as a residential  
 home for the elderly. There are 44    
 residents living in the house: 10 men 
 and 34 women. The residents share     
 rooms with 2_3 occupants though some  
 have their own rooms. The house has a 
 total of 28 staff which comprises of  
 :_ 6 night staff; 6 day staff; 8      
 domestics; 3 officers in charge; 2    
 cooks and 3 week_end workers. The     
 problem of caring for the elderly is  
 likely to increase in the future as   
 the proportion of the population which
 is over pensionable age increases.    
 Local Authorites in N.E. Fife have    
 invested heavily to provide           
 accommodation for old people in       
 sheltered housing and old peoples'    
 homes in local towns such as Cupar and
 Auchtermuchty.                        </content>
