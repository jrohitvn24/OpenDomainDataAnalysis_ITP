		<title>05THE COMMUNITY CENTRE</title>
		<content>{The Community Centre}was built in     
 1951; a pre-fabricated building known 
 as a{"Horsa Hut"}was gifted by the    
 Scottish Council of Social Service and
 joined to the small hall already being
 used. This was the property of the    
 local branch of the{I.O.G.T.}and known
 as the{Temperance Hall;}it was used   
 for the stage, dressing rooms, kitchen
 and toilets, while the "Horsa Hut" was
 used as the main hall.                
                                       
{Events}include, in addition to        
{concerts}and{dances,}such things as   
{Industrial Shows, Sales of Work, Cards
{Nights}and a sale room for{travelling 
{merchants.                            
                                       
 It has been recommended that the      
 "Horsa Hut" should be renewed. This   
 may mean that the community centre may
 be moved to the school.               </content>
