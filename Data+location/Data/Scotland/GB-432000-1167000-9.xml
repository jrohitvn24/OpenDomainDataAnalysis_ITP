  thinking up their acts.Each squad has
 to submit the details of the squad to 
 the Up_helly_aa committee to make sure
 no two squads are the same.           
 The squads march from the Brae hall to
 the Sailing club there the galley is  
 pushed into the voe.The brass band    
 play ,a cheer goes up.The squads      
 gather round the galley.They throw the
 torches into the ship as she floats   
 out into the voe.                     
 The squads now pile into their buses  
 and make for the halls.At a hall each 
 squad takes its turn to perform.After 
 the act the squad picks a dance.Then  
 the squad travels on to the next hall.
 there are five different halls open on
 Up_helly_aa night.It is a long night  
 the festivities go on to the early    
 hours of the morning.
