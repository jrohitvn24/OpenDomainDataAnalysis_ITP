		<title>02Ayrshire Dairy Farming (1)</title>
		<content> The 128 hectares (320 acres) that     
 make up Altonhill Farm are mainly     
 rented and partly owned by Mr.Archie  
 Borland. Most of the rented land is in
 Kilmarnock Estates.                   
 The main enterprise is dairying. The  
 115 dairy cows are milked twice each  
 day_once at 6am and again in the      
 afternoon. Each year the herd produces
 3/4 of a million litres of milk which 
 is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank 
 and collected daily by a road tanker  
 and taken to Glasgow.                 
 The majority of the cows calve between
 August and October,with the remainder 
 being spread throughout the year. Most
 of the female calves (heifers) are    
 kept at the farm,reared as            
 replacements for the dairy herd. Bull 
 calves are sold at between three and  
 four weeks old to be reared for beef.
