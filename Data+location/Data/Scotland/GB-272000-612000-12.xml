		<content> It is said locally that Christmas is  
 for the children and New Year for the 
 adults and this is reflected in the   
 way each is celebrated.               
 At Christmas no expense is spared to  
 ensure, as far as possible, that each 
 child has his/her wants met.          
 There are the usual preparations and  
 festivities beginning with the Watch  
 Night service on Christmas Eve.       
 Christmas Day is a family affair with 
 a special meal which may be of turkey,
 pork,game or a good cut of beef.      
 The important part as far as the      
 children are concerned is the         
 exchanging of presents.Each family may
 differ in how this is done but usually
 the children will awake very early to 
 find the stocking they hung up in     
  their bedroom or by the fireplace    
 filled with presents. An apple or     
 orange is usually in the toe.See pg 13</content>
