		<content> This has been seen most recently in   
 allowing the Water Authority and the  
 Gas Board to lay new pipes through the
 forest.(The Army also uses the forest 
 for training).This co_operation       
 extends to the Research Centre which  
 has been experimenting in growth using
 different kinds of Slurry.            
 Part of the forest was destroyed      
 eighteen months ago by gale_force     
 winds of between 80 and 100 miles an  
 hour.The uprooted trees were sold to a
 contractor who then cleared that part 
 of the forest.                        
 The furrows are turned over by machine
 and the seedlings(which are grown in a
 Nursery area from the trees' own      
 seeds) are planted, by hand, on the   
 top of the furrows. The wood from the 
 mature trees is used for paper,       
 furniture, telegragh poles and pit    
 props.                                </content>
