		<title>11CHURCH HISTORY</title>
		<content> The high kirk of stranraer was built  
 in 1842.The chief benefactors for the 
 building of the church were Major     
 General Mc Dowall and Miss Mc Dowall  
 who lived opposite in the park house.A
 plaque to there memory still stands in
 the vestibule of the church.the church
 was built for Â£1790,but no doubt that 
 was a lot of money 143 years ago when 
 you compare that now the repairs to   
 the church and the tower will amount  
 to close one Â£50,000.The church owes  
 its name to its position on the hill, 
 and for many years ships entering     
 Stranraer harbour have steered for the
 tower.For that reason engineers       
 responsible for the dredging of       
 Lochryan,prior to the introduction of 
 a larger ferry,guided the dredgers by 
 a laser beam operated from the High   
 Kirk tower.
