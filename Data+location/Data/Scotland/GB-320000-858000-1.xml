		<title>01Review Of Birnie Area.</title>
		<content>  The block lies 1km south of Elgin    
 situated near the Moray Firth ,in the 
 shadow of the Grampion Mountains.This 
 area has a mild climate. Topsoil,blown
 by the prevailing westerly winds,     
 causes sandstorms in dry periods. The 
 land rises to 100 metres above sea    
 level. Much of the area is coniferous.
  There are 10 farms averaging 300     
 acres, dairy or mixed. There are no   
 shops or villages in this area, Birnie
 Church being the most important       
 building. In the south west corner is 
 the Longmorn Distillery with its long 
 disused railway. To the west of the   
 block and running north is the River  
 Lossie  which is prone to flooding.The
 banks are covered with bracken and    
 rough grassland.
