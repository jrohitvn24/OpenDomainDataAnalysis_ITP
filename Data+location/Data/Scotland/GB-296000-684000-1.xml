   Nearly all of the southern two      
 thirds of this D-block is covered by  
 the Firth of Forth and the northern   
 third is mainly farmland and woodland.
 Sandwiched between these and to the   
 eastern side of the block is the      
 village of Culross, "the most complete
 example in Scotland today of a burgh  
 of the l7th and l8th centuries".      
   To the east it extends into the     
 village of Low Valleyfield. West of   
 the village is mainly farmland and    
 what is left of Dunimarle Castle and  
 Blair Castle estates.
