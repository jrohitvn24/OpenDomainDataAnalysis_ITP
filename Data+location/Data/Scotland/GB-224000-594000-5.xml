		<content> Barr is in the presbytry of Ayr and   
 synod of Glasgow and Ayr.The          
 Presbyterian parish church is of 17th.
 century origin.                       
 The minister of Barr (and Dailly)     
 lives in the manse in the village of  
 Dailly.Regular services are held in   
 Barr Church throughout the year.The   
 minister spends approx.40% of his time
 visiting his Barr parishoners.Once a  
 month,as school chaplain,the minister 
 calls at the school to meet with staff
 and pupils.Several times a year the   
 pupils go to the church to perform    
 plays,join in songs of praise and     
 participate in many events in the     
 Christian calendar.                   
 As there is only one church in the    
 village the make-up of the            
 congregation is quite varied with     
 different faiths being quite happy to 
 worship in a "{Community}"church.     </content>
