		<title>03Farming around Milnathort</title>
		<content> The agricultural land is used for     
 general arable farming with some live-
 stock.  Lowland grazing is secondary  
 to the much larger acreage devoted to 
 barley, potatoes, oil-seed rape, hay  
 and silage, oats, some greens and some
 soft fruit.                           
 Three of the four farms in this block 
 keep livestock.  Kinross Home Farm    
 has about 250 domestic stock; there   
 are about 230 on Lethangie and on     
 Orwell a similar number.  Most of     
 these are sheep, but Orwell has a     
 milking herd of about 70 Friesian     
 cattle.  The sheep breeds are Border  
 Leicester, some Blackface and some    
 Suffolk.  A few Jacob's sheep are also
 kept.                                 
 Local potato contractors hire fields  
 for their own use.  Potato planting   
 and harvesting creates seasonal work  
 for many Milnathort people.           </content>
