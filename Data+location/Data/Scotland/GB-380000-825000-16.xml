		<title>16Oldmeldrum Employment</title>
		<content> Traditionally Oldmeldrum is a market  
 town in the farming area of the       
 Garioch and has grown slowly over the 
 last 300 years.  Its major employers  
 have been the Glengarioch distillery  
 (whisky) and E J Paterson (builders). 
 From a 1970s pop of 1000, Oldmeldrum  
 has recently grown half as much again 
 to a 1985 figure of 1580.  Although   
 some of these incoming householders   
 are employed locally, such as at the  
 agricultural machinery supplier,      
 Sellars, or in local hotels, the      
 majority of traditional jobs are held 
 by long-standing locals, e.g.         
 electricians, plumbers, slater,       
 blacksmith, vehicle repairs, banks and
 catering.  The incoming pop. therefore
 has found its employment, for women   
 locally in the public sector and in   
 shops, hotels and pubs, for men the   
 main employment is oil-related work.  </content>
