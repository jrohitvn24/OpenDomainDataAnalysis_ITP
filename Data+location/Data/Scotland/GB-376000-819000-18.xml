		<title>18INVERURIE BY-PASS</title>
		<content> The proposed route of the by-pass will
 remove 3 or 4 holes on the golf       
 course. The members of the golf club  
 objected to this quite naturally, but 
 new ground is being made available to 
 compensate for this.                  
                                       
 The by-pass also involves the         
 demolition of Mount Pleasant, a house 
 in Port Elphinstone. The owner of the 
 house has  objected quite strongly as 
 it is felt that it could be re-routed 
 slightly to avoid this.               
                                       
 The by-pass will only remove an       
 estimated 1/4 of the traffic in       
 Inverurie and some people feel that it
 is not worth the expense and the      
 nuisance factor. Shopkeepers feel that
 their trade will be affected with less
 passing trade.                        
                                       </content>
