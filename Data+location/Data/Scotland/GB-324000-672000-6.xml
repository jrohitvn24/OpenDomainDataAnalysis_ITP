		<content>{Arthur's Seat}is a dominant feature of
 the Edinburgh{landscape.}It was once  
 an active{volcano.}Signs of the       
 ice-age are to be found as ice cracks 
 can be seen in rocks and stones.      
                                       
 To-day there you can hill walk, play  
 football in the surrounding{Queen's   
{Park,}take part in a marathon, have a 
 school picnic and sledge in winter.   
 You can visit Holyrood Palace or bird 
 watch at Duddingston Loch which is a  
 bird{sanctuary.}                      
 The Queen holds garden parties there  
 and every year the miners hold a gala.
 Paratroopers hold exhibitions- and    
 jump from balloons.                   
 At Lochend Park I race my BMX bike    
 round the track. There are boats on   
 the loch and swans nest in the middle.
 There are many parks in the city      
 centre.                               </content>
