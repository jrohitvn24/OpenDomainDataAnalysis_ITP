 more than 8000 acres.A quarter of     
 which forms part of the Lomond        
 Hills.The area is sparsely populated. 
 The village of Falkland lies at the   
 foot of the East Lomond Hill on the   
 north side and enjoys a fairly mild   
 and variable climate.The palace,in    
 the Stuart period, was used as a      
 hunting lodge and is now the main     
 attraction for tourists.              
  The village is occupied by papermill 
 workers,with half a dozen large farms 
 and many small farms in the near      
 vicinity.Local shops cater for the    
 tourist trade.Apart from that no other
 employment is available.Many people   
 commute to Glenrothes or Cupar the    
 nearest large centres of population.
