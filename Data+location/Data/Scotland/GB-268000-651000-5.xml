		<content>   The area is almost entirely devoted 
 to rearing stock with virtually no    
 arable land. This has not altered over
 the years, since the OSA mentions     
 Hamilton's main crop to be potatoes,  
 plus the rearing of animals.          
{STOCK REARING}                        
   Stock is reared for two purposes.   
 a) Dairy Farming.                     
 b) Fattening for sale.                
   Sheep are raised- mostly for sale,  
 but also in some cases for their wool.
{AGRICULTURE}                          
   The land is overwhelming grassland -
 divided in permanent pasture and laid 
 where the grass is improved and cut   
 for silage. Arable land is usually    
 used for root-crops and is comparati- 
 vely small in acreage. There is no    
 commercial forestry, but some market  
 gardening on a small scale.
