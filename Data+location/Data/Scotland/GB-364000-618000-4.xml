		<content>   Apart from Mainetti and Starrett    
 there                                 
 are no other factories in our block.  
 Many women travel to the nothern end  
 of the town to the knitwear and the   
 kiltmaker factories.Both men and women
 work in shops,cafes,hotels,offices and
 banks.Men are employed in garages,    
 building firms and other allied trades
 and some are employed by the council.A
 few men also work in the knitwear and 
 sheepskin factories .Some farmers in  
 the district also employ a few        
 men.Many have to travel out of the    
 town to find work.                    
  It was reported in the local paper   
 recently that 9% of the people are    
 unemployed.
