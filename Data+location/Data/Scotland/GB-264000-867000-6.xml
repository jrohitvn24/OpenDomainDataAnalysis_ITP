		<content> Basically the people of Alness follow 
 the same trends, wearing the same     
 style of clothes, and listening to the
 same sort of pop music, as elsewhere  
 in the country.The town also has it's 
 share of punks, mods and skinheads.   
 There are few entertainment facilities
 other than sports, in Alness.         
 Occasionally there is a disco held in 
 the Averon Centre, or people can go to
 the Youth Club.                       
 For the over eighteens there are four 
 licensed hotels and one public house  
 to choose from. There are discos for  
 over eighteens and bingo nights held  
 in one of the hotels,weekly.          
 There are five places to have a sit-  
 down meal; any of the hotels mentioned
 or the Indian restaurant. You could   
 have a meal from one of the five carry
 out restaurants. There is also a cafe 
 open during shop hours.               </content>
