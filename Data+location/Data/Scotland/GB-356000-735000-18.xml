		<content>{  BULLDOG} This is a game where all   
 the players are lined up at one end of
 the play area and one player, A, is   
 positioned facing them, between them  
 and the other side of the play area.  
 A calls someone's name and that person
 has to try to run past A to the other 
 side.  If he succeeds then all the    
 rest of the players try to run past A 
 and any who are caught join A in the  
 middle.  The last person to be caught 
 wins.                                 
                                       
{  SARDINES }This is similar to Hide   
 and Seek, except that, as each person 
 finds the one hiding,he joins him in  
 the hiding-place.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
