		<title>15A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> At 7.30 I get up and get my clothes   
 on, I go into the kitchen and have    
 cornflakes and a roll for breakfast. I
 watch Breakfast television until 8.30.
 I comb my hair and go out for the bus.
 When I get to school I play football  
 until the bell rings. We go into the  
 classroom and start our Mathematics.  
 At 10.30 we go into the playground for
 a little while to play football. When 
 we come back into the classroom we do 
 some language work until lunch        
 time.After lunch I play football. In  
 the afternoon we work on our school   
 newspaper.At 3.30 I get the bus home  
 again then I watch television until   
 5.00. I had mince and potatoes and    
 banana split for tea. Then I went out 
 on my bike,did my homework,watched    
 television and went to bed at 8.30.
