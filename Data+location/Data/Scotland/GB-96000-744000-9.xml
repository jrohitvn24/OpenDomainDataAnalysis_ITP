		<content> Building                              
 There are two main builders- Ian Inish
 and Danny's.They are called that      
 because that is the names of the      
 bosses.There are other builders.They  
 are self employed or work in two's.   
 There is a lot of building on the     
 Island. A lot of people are getting   
 their houses modernised.They might get
 a grant to help them pay for the      
 work.The houses now have central      
 heating.Some of the houses that get   
 done up are holiday homes. {
