		<content> When meetings were held in 1635 to    
 discuss the possibility of erecting a 
 light on the Isle of May it was       
 suggested that Inchkeith should also  
 have one. However a lighthouse was not
 erected on Inchkeith until 1803. It   
 was a pioneer in its field as the     
 light was fitted with reflectors made 
 of copper and plated with silver and  
 it used spermaceti oil rather than    
 whale oil. Above the entrance is a    
 plaque, which states:{"For the        
{direction of mariners, and for the    
{benefit of commerce, this lighthouse  
{was erected by order of the           
{Commissioners of the Northern         
{Lighthouses. It was founded on the    
{18th day of May in the year 1803, and 
{lighted on the 14th of September 1804.
{Thomas Smith, Engineer."}In October   
 1835 the first dioptric light in      
 Britain shone from Inchkeith.         </content>
