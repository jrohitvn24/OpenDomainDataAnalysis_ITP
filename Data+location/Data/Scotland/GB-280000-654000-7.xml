		<content> Most people are employed outwith the  
 area .The main sources of employment  
 are to be found in Motherwell e.g. BSC
 Ravenscraig ,Anderson Strathclyde     
 (coal cutting machinery manufacturers)
 Wishaw Industrial Estate. There are   
 still a few miners left in the area   
 but they also have to leave the area  
 particularly to Polkemmet near        
 Whitburn , West Lothian (now under    
 threat of closure).However as they get
 older and they retire with few younger
 people in the area becoming miners    
 eventually there will be none left.   
   There are a considerable number of  
 professional people e.g. Lawyers,     
 Doctors, Bankers and Works Managers to
 be found living in the area .They tend
 to live in the private estates in the 
 area but many still commute outwith   
 the area e.g.Steelworks Managers and  
 professional staff to Motherwell.     </content>
