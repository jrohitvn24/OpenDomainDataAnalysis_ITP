		<content> This block sits astride the upper     
 catchment of the river Cowie and is   
 comprised almost entirely of mature   
 coniferous forest.   The only         
 habitations are the Mergie House &amp;    
 Farm in square 4, the house of        
 Tillybreak (square 3)   and           
 Clochanshrels in square 8.   The      
 forest is part of Fetteresso Forest,  
 managed by the Forestry Commission,   
 and covers and north towards the River
 Cowie.   The forest has had very      
 little felling up to now.   The       
 highest points of the block are the   
 hill of the three stones (290m), which
 is completely afforested, and the hill
 of Trusa (321m), the top of which     
 (about 0.75km) is open heather        
 moorland.   A small portion of        
 deciduous woodland (birch) is found to
 the east of the unclassified road in  
 square 4 and covers peat diggings.    </content>
