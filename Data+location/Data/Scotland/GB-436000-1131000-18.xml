		<content>     BY MAY THIS YEAR FOUR BOATS HAD   
 BEEN LAUNCHED WHICH WERE CONNECTED    
 WITH BRIDGE END. THE "BE READY" AND   
 THE "ADONIS" ARE BOTH FISHING BOATS   
 LAUNCHED IN CAMPBELTOWN AND WITH      
 SKIPPERS FROM BRIDGE END. MOST OF THE 
 OWNERS AND CREW OF THE "ADONIS" ALSO  
 LIVE IN BRIDGE END.                   
      "SCOTTIE'S PRIDE" AND "BOY       
 ADRIAN" ARE SMALLER BOATS , BUILT IN  
 BRIDGE END , THE FIRST BY TWO LOCAL   
 MEN OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND THE     
 SECOND BY A LOCAL BUILDER. ONE WAS    
 LAUNCHED AT HAMNAVOE, THE OTHER AT    
 SCALLOWAY.                            
      BOTH THE FISHING BOATS CALLED IN 
 AT HAMNAVOE BEFORE STARTING FISHING TO
 LET LOCAL PEOPLE SEE THEM AND         
 CELEBRATE THEIR LAUNCHING. THEY NOW   
 FISH FROM SCALLOWAY. "SCOTTIE'S PRIDE"
 GOES TO SCALLOP FISHING AND "BOY      
 ADRIAN" TO THE LOBSTER CREELS.        </content>
