		<content> During the skiing season there are at 
 least 5 major tournaments at the Black
 Loch and we see many top line skiiers 
 from South of the Border coming North 
 to participate.                       
 The other activities at the Black     
 Loch are fishing and swimming. Both   
 these activities have been encouraged 
 by the Slamannan water ski club.      
 During the fishing season there are   
 several competitions at the loch      
 organised by some of the local fishing
 clubs.                                
 Slamannan water ski club has also     
 encouraged the local people to use the
 loch for bathing and depending on the 
 weather the Black Loch can see quite a
 turnout of swimmers from all over the 
 country.
