		<content>   There have been a lot of{changes}in 
 the home. We interviewed three        
{housewives.}One of the housewives had 
 been a housewife for fifty years.She  
 brought us in two old irons and a     
 scrubbing board.We all had questions  
 to ask the three ladies.Only one of   
 them has a{dishwasher.}One of the     
 helpful changes was an{automatic      
{washing machine.}A modern iron is much
 easier to handle too.The old gas iron 
 was very heavy to carry and was very  
 dangerous.A{vacuum cleaner}is much    
 easier to clean the carpets than      
 before when you used to have to bend  
 down and use a brush and pan.Houses   
 are more comfortable now with{central 
{heating}and{double glazing.
