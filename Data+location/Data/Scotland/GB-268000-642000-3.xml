		<content> There are three main categories of    
 attitudes held by people in Strathaven
 towards Nuclear Weapons.              
     1)Those who believe they are      
 neccessary to defend our country.     
     2)Those who have no strong        
 opinions about them.                  
     3)Those who believe we should get 
 rid of them.                          
 In a survey in Strathaven 18% said    
 "YES" to Nuclear Weapons----72% said  
 "NO"----10% had no opinion.           
       Some of those asked said they   
 were uneasy about Nuclear Weapons     
 stationed in this country and         
 controlled by another nation.         
 Others felt that although the weapons 
 were undesirable we must have them if 
 other countries, especially possible  
 enemy ones i.e. Russia,had them.      
 Despite the survey result C.N.D. is   
 not especially strong in this area.   </content>
