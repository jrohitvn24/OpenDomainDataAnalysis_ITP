		<content>{The Cairn}at Waterloo was probably    
 built by the{Picts}and was there      
 before Jesus.The proper name for      
 Waterloo was{Achadh Chairn}"Cairn     
 Field".It became Waterloo after the   
 Napoleonic battle at Waterloo.The     
 Liveras Cairn has been excavated and  
 items have been taken to the Edinburgh
 Museum.The cairn on MacHattie's{croft 
 has been opened and a spearhead found.
 A professor has said that it will be  
 excavated within the next 30 years.All
 the local cairns are more or less in  
 line with each other.In Rudh an Dunan 
 the cairns have been opened and       
 pottery and iron weapons were found.  
 Waterloo is a very fine example       
 of a{Pictish Cairn.}The entrance is on
 the N.E.side of the cairn with flat   
 stones about 13ft long &amp; 9in thick on 
 top of the tomb.
