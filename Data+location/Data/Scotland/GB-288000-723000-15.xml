		<content>   Gilmerton is situated on the A85    
 which is a busy main route and is     
 joined by a B-road in the village     
 itself which runs down from Dunkeld.  
 A traffic count was taken and in      
 thirty minutes 166 cars passed.  53 of
 these took the Sma' Glen road, 59     
 passed from Crieff to Perth and 54    
 from Perth to Crieff.  There were very
 few bikes or buses and a total of nine
 lorries.                              
   In a questionnaire it was found that
 52% of people asked had a car and that
 a fairly frequent bus service catered 
 for the rest, though the service was  
 not good on a Sunday.  Since this is a
 busy main road crossing it can be     
 dangerous.  Many drivers do not adhere
 to the speed limits through Gilmerton 
 and many residents felt a crossing was
 badly needed.                         
                                       </content>
