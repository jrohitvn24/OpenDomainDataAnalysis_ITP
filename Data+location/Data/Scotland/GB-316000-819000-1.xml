		<title>01PEAT CUTTING</title>
		<content> Edward Stuart is Tomintoul's local    
 peat cutter.He has his own business of
 peat cutting and recently was cutting 
 peat at the Feith Musach not very far 
 north east of Tomintoul.              
 The machines that he uses are a John  
 Deere tractor with tracks and a peat  
 plough,and three Massey Fergusons.He  
 also has a lorry and a landrover.     
 After he has cut the peat he has to   
 leave it to dry which takes about 30  
 to 40 days.After drying they are      
 picked up by hand and stacked in bags 
 ready for selling.Over the winter he  
 sells a lot of peat locally.          
 The machinery that he uses can be very
 expensive so he has to be careful that
 he does not hit any stones when he is 
 cutting the peat.The plough can cut to
 a depth of 3 feet and it makes the job
 a lot easier than doing it by hand.
