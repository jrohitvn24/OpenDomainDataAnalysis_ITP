		<content>  Situated in High Street, probably the
 oldest  and  most  picturesque part of
 the village,  Fife Folk Museum used to
 be the Baron's  Court  House  with its
 own  prison cell, and the Weigh House.
                                       
  Outside,  on  the  right of the door,
 hang the "Jougs".   They consist of an
 iron ring which went round the neck of
 an offender  and  two  iron  bracelets
 which held him to the wall.           
                                       
  Above  the  door,   carved  into  the
 stone, are the  Scales of Justice with
 the inscription  "God Bless The Just."
                                       
  In  1968  it  became  the  Fife  Folk
 Museum.                               
                                       
  Nowadays this area is visited by many
 tourists and  parties of children from
 Fife schools.                         </content>
