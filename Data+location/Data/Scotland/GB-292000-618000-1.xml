		<title>01The Crawford Area.</title>
		<content> The village of Crawford forms part of 
 our area.Crawford is a small village  
 with a population of around 350.      
 Crawford lies beside the A74,the      
 River Clyde and the main Glasgow/     
 London Railway.                       
 Although Crawford is small,it is a    
 village with a lot of history.William 
 Wallace,the Champion of the Scots     
 burnt down Crawford Castle 700 years  
 ago.                                  
 The area around Crawford consists     
 mainly of hill land with rough        
 grazing.The highest hill is Rodger Law
 which is 540 metres above sea-level.  
 There are also some small woods and   
 several burns,which are tributaries of
 the Clyde.                            
 Crawford is a very nice place in which
 to live.
