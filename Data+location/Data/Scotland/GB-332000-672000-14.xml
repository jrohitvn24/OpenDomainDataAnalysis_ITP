 was decided to include a proper       
 theatre with in the building.  It     
 seats up to 360 people.  Backstage    
 there are dressing rooms for 36       
 artists.  There is a special group of 
 people known as the Friends Of The    
 Theatre who want to encourage the     
 development and success of the local  
 threatre and to promote interest in

 theatre, and children's activities.
