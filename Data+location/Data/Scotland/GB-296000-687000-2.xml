		<content> New Market Garden.                    
 This is a new enterprise started over 
 the last year. The house was built in 
 1984. This market garden is 13 acres  
 and is split up into different types  
 of fruit.                             
  {5 acres under strawberries.         
  {2 acres under raspberries.          
  {1/2 acre under blackcurrants.       
 It is good soil but the top end of    
 the garden is very sandy.The owner had
 a previous job in the Scottish        
 Agricultural Organisation.He left his 
 last job in 1980.He has now started   
 self-pick vegetables.He also has a lot
 of shrubs for the local market        
 gardens.The new house was not on our  
 map which shows how rapidly maps go   
 out of date. The garden lies between  
 Middle Grange Farm and West Grange    
 Farm.
