		<content>  Many of our great-grandparents came  
 to this area from other coal fields   
 where work had ceased.                
  Before World War Two, the houses were
 next to the pits. They had a big range
 to heat water for the miners to have a
 wash in a zinc tub as there were no   
 pit-head baths then. Toilets were at  
 the end of the garden. There are still
 miners' rows to be seen in Lochore.   
  People left school at 14 and started 
 work straight away, as there was      
 plenty of work in the pits then.      
  The people went to corner shops and  
 delivery vans came round. There were  
 no supermarkets like today.           
  The main transport was buses, trams  
 and trains from Lochgelly.            
  Lochore Meadows, known locally as the
 "Meadies", was a mess of pit bings and
 rubbish tips.
