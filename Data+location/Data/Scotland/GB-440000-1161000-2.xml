		<title>02The Voe Bakery.</title>
		<content>                                       
 In 1915 a bakery was built in Voe. No 
 alterations have been made to the     
 original building but new machinery   
 and ovens have been installed.        
 In the early hours of the morning work
 gets underway at the bakery. The      
 bakers start at 3am and work until 1pm
 They may have to work longer if they  
 are delayed for some reason e.g. a    
 power cut. Altogether 8 people are    
 employed here.White aprons are worn by
 the workers and they are not allowed  
 to smoke while working with the bread.
 Fourteen machines help the bakers to  
 prepare the mixtures and there are two
 ovens to bake the bread in.           
 After being packed the Voe bread is   
 distributed all over Shetland by the  
 two bakery vans.
