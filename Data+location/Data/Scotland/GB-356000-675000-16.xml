		<title>16PRESTON MILL, EAST LOTHIAN</title>
		<content>    Preston Mill, on the River Tyne,   
 dates from the 16th century, although 
 there may have been a mill on the site
 in earlier times. This water-driven   
 mill was first used to grind oats, and
 later wheat, which were grown locally.
    The mill seems to have been built  
 under a Dutch influence. After the    
 Second World War the mill buildings   
 began to deteriorate, mainly through  
 lack of use. However Preston Mill has 
 since been restored to working order, 
 and is visited annually by many people
 who much admire the huge wheel, the   
 red pantiled roof and the unique coned
 kiln.
