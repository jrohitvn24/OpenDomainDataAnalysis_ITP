		<title>18GALA DAY AT ST.NINIANS</title>
		<content> The first gala was held in{Thistle    
{Park.}Its gala queen was Margaret     
 McKenzie. The people who started the  
 gala were Mr and Mrs Walker.          
 This years gala queen is{Elaine Dow.  
 Her dress, which will cost about      
 Â£30,will be made for her by Mrs Kemp. 
 The parade starts at Cultenhove       
 Community Centre and ends at Mayfield.
 Lots of clubs such as Pipe Bands,     
 Highland Dancing and Majorettes go to 
 the gala.                             
 The gala queens float isn't always the
 best as last year the majorettes won. 
 The gala is completely free apart from
 crisps, juice and ice-cream. Last year
 there were about 550 people at the    
 gala. There is a competition for the  
 best float and the winner gets a      
 trophy. The gala is from 11 in the    
 morning until 4  in the afternoon.
