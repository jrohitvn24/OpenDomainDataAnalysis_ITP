		<title>09RELIGION IN THE BRAES</title>
		<content>   Not  so  many  years ago, almost all
 the  people  in  the  Braes were Roman
 Catholics. A beautiful  church  called
 'Our  Lady  Of  Perpetual Succour' was
 built by  the  Abbe Macpherson who had
 studied  for  the  Priesthood  at  the
 Scalan.  He   also  built  the  school
 alongside the  chapel.  The  inside of
 the chapel is beautiful  and  has  the
 words  of  the  'Our Father'  in latin
 painted round the  ceiling.  With  the
 shortage of priests and the decline of
 numbers  in the parish, it was decided
 to amalgamate  with  the  parishes  of
 Tombae and  Tomintoul, with the priest
 staying  in Tomintoul.                
   With the influx of people to operate
 the  distillery,  other  denominations
 are now represented. Presbyterians can
 attend   services   at  Tomintoul   or
 Achbreck but Episcopalians must travel
 to Aberlour or Dufftown.              </content>
