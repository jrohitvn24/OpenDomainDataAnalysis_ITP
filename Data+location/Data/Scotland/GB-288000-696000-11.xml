		<title>11A FAMOUS BUILDING IN ALVA</title>
		<content> Apart from the Ochil Hills,Strude Mill
 is the most important feature in the  
 Alva{landscape.}It stands at the north
 of the town close to the Alva Glen.It 
 is a tall narrow building.It has 326  
 windows,150 at the front,150 at the   
 back 18 on the side and 8 on the roof.
 All the windows were used for letting 
 in the light because it was designed  
 for the hand-loom{weaving industry.}It
 was built in 1798 and was used until  
 recently for making woollen goods.It  
 has 6 floors.A building firm now wants
 to turn it into flats,but as the{arch-
{itecture}is important it has to be    
 done without changing the outside of  
 the mill.
