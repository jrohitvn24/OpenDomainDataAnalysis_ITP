		<title>18Gilmerton Shops.</title>
		<content> In {Gilmerton Village }there are quite
 a lot of shops.There is a{post office,
{a fruit shop,a delicatessan,a butcher,
{a Low's supermarket,a Pakistani's,a   
{cafe,a betting shop,a video shop, a   
{mini supermarket, a fishmongers and a 
{T.V.rental shop. }There is also a {   
{Chinese take-away,}and a {Royal Bank  
{of Scotland.}                         
 There is also {Jackson's,}the bakers  
 which has home-made soup,milk,cakes,  
 bread and biscuits.At one time there  
 used to be a {laundrette.}Before the {
{sports shop}there used to be another  
 butcher.                              
 I think it's good that the Pakistani's
 stay open later than the other shops  
 in case you run out of something.
