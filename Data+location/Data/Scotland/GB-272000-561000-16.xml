		<title>16Old Railway</title>
		<content> The old railway has been there for    
 many years. There was a bridge over   
 the river but the tracks were lifted  
 twenty years ago and the bridge was   
 pulled down. You can see where it was 
 because the legs are still there. The 
 river is about 1 metre deep in May.   
 When the new Castle-Douglas by-pass is
 built there will be a new bridge here.
 We saw the marked posts beside the    
 river, and a pile of things like      
 cookers, fridges, old beds, cans and  
 lots more things like that. A van     
 comes about once a month to take      
 things away so that they can get      
 burnt.
