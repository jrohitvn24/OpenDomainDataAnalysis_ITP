		<title>05SCHOOLS'FOOTBALL IN 1985</title>
		<content>  Football is probably the most popular
 sport in 1985.The objective of the    
 game is to score a goal by using your 
 feet or head.                         
   Schools football is exactly the same
  except it is played by schoolboys.   
 There is a Large Schools Cup and a    
 Small Schools Cup.The Small Schools   
 Cup is celebrating it's 50th          
 anniversary this year.It is for       
 schools with under 300 pupils.To get  
 to the final a team has to play 3     
 games,a qualifying game,a quarter     
 final and a semi final.If the team    
 gets to the final and wins they get a 
 cup.Symington Primary got to the final
 in 1985 and lost to Kilmaurs 2-1.Also 
 there is a Primary Schools League.In  
 the League a team plays a series of   
 games and at the end of the season the
 team with most points wins the League.
