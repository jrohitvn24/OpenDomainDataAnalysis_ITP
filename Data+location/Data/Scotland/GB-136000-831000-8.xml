		<title>08A DAY AT THE PEATS</title>
		<content>  At the first sign of good weather in 
 the Spring,lots of people in our      
 village set off to the peat bogs.Each 
 family has their own peat bank.The    
 first thing to be done is the         
 'turfing'-taking the top off the      
 peat,which has grown a grassy layer.  
 Now the peats are cut with a          
 peat-iron.As they are sliced,some-one 
 has to be down in the peat bog        
 catching them and putting them at the 
 side of the bank.It is very sore on   
 the back!                             
 Next they have to be spread out to    
 dry.Later they are piled up into high 
 stacks.Once they are ready,they are   
 collected in bags or by tractor and   
 taken home to be used for fuel.Peat   
 fires give off a very distinctive     
 smell.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
