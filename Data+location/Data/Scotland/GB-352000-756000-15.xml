		<content> Most farmers exhibit at the Highland  
{Show}in Edinburgh, during the month   
 of June and obtain a high number of   
 prizes. Some also exhibit at the Angus
 Show, in Arbroath, in July.           
 Barn{Dances}are sometimes held on the 
 farms and they are convivial affairs  
 where the community can meet.         
 At present there is a suggestion      
 before the{ Community Council}to      
 provide a pavement from the row of    
 Council houses to the School.         
 In the area there is a flourishing {  
{plumber's}business, which is carried  
 on by the plumber from his home. This 
 busines consists moslty of heating    
 installations in Solid Fuel, Gas and  
 Oil.
