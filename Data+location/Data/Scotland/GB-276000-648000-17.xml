 THE TOWN OF LARKHALL HAS LONG BEEN    
 ASSOCIATED WITH MINING.DURING THE LAST
 CENTURY THIRTY FOUR PITS WERE         
 OPERATIVE AND AS RECENTLY AS 1969 ONE 
 MINE WAS STILL WORKABLE.NOWADAYS MOST 
 TRACES OF MINES HAVE BEEN COVERED UP  
 WITH HOUSING SCHEMES AND NEW BUILDINGS
 AND ANY ONE VISITING OUR TOWN WOULD   
 NEVER THINK OF LARKHALL AS BEING A    
 MINING VILLAGE THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF   
 THIS HISTORIC OCCUPATION IS A FEW     
 MINERS COTTAGES SCATERED AROUND THE   
 TOWN (MACNEIL STREET,UNION STREET).   
 WHOLE FAMILIES WERE INVOLVED IN THE   
 BOOM DAYS OF MINING EARNING A MEAGRE  
 LIVELIHOOD DIGGING UNDERGROUND IN 8   
 HOUR SHIFTS FOR 8/9d (43 PENCE) IN THE
 1930'S OR IN MINE_RELATED JOBS SUCH AS
 HOUSE CONSTRUCTION AND AMBULANCE
