		<content> The block is largely composed of sea, 
 this being a section of the southern  
 shore of the Moray Firth. This        
 particular stretch of coastline is    
 made up of gentle cliffs, topped with 
 rough heathland, coves and caves. One 
 cave contains wall paintings, believed
 to be pictish. The local sandstone is 
 quarried along this stretch and has   
 been variously used for millstones and
 building material. None of the coves  
 on the stretch is suitable for use as 
 a harbour, although there are several 
 along the firth with active fishing   
 fleets. There is a coastguard lookout 
 here manned by boys from nearby       
 Gordonstown School.
