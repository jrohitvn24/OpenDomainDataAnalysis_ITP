		<content>   There is no church in this block but
 there  is  a  Church  of  Scotland  at
 Achbreck in  the  block  to  the  east
 where the {Presbyterians }who form the
 largest denomination in the  area, can
 attend services. The minister  himself
 does  not  stay at Achbreck but at the
 Manse  nearer  Inveravon  to the north
 which is also part of his Parish.     
  {Episcopalians}can attend services at
 Aberlour and {Roman Catholics }have  a
 Chapel at Tombae in  the block to  the
 SE,  although  the   Priest  stays  at
 Tomintoul.                            
   At the  Downan  there  is a very old
{graveyard}which is  still in use today
 by those who wish  to  be laid to rest
 among their own folk.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
