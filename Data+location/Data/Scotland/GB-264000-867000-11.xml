		<content> The armed forces are represented by an
 RAF base on the south-west of Alness. 
 They have been present in the area    
 since the 2nd World War at a camp on  
 the flat delta area of the River      
 Averon. There are approximately 90 men
 based here at present. Each family    
 stays here for about four years before
 transfer to another base. A number of 
 the airmen serve in the Marine Section
 at Invergordon some four miles away.In
 April 1986,this section is due to     
 close with the loss of over half the  
 jobs.                                 
 On the camp there is single and       
 married accommodation,offices and     
 recreation facilities.
