		<content> A typical day at Baldoukie Farm       
 My Dad gets up at 5:00 a.m. to do     
 the milking.First he herds the cows   
 into the dairy and milks them.Then I  
 have to herd the cows back into the   
 field while Dad cleans up the dairy   
 with a power hose.The next job is to  
 feed the calves.I have to hold the    
 bottles of milk while the calves are  
 drinking and I also give them         
 cattle-cake to eat. Then Dad lets me  
 drive the tractor up the ramp and into
 the passage while my brother William  
 shovels the draft out of the tractor. 
 Draft is feed for the cows.After      
 breakfast William and I have to feed  
 the bullocks in the high field.I drive
 the tractor and William forks the     
 straw and turnips out of the trailer  
 for the animals to eat.When time      
 allows between farmwork and housework 
 Mum and Dad look after the garden     </content>
