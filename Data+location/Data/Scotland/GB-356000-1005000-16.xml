		<content> Some men and boys are part of an      
 Orkney wide group, which collects and 
 restores vintage engines. From October
 to March there are monthly{Whist and  
{Euchre Drives}for the adults and      
{Beetle and Dominoes}for the children. 
 Towards the end of each year the      
{Harvest Home}takes place, organised by
 the Hall Committee. Thanks are given  
 for the harvest and a meal and dancing
 follows. Sometimes{concerts}are given 
 by people from other districts, but,  
 as there is a wealth of local talent, 
 they are often given by parishioners  
 themselves. Each year they include the
 play entered in the Orkney Drama      
 Festival by the Young Farmers. Not    
 only do they{entertain}themselves, but
 arrange variety programmes to         
 entertain other groups.
