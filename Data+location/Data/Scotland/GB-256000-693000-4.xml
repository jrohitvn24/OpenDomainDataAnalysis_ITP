		<content> The first PLOUGHING MATCH organised by
 the{BUCHLYVIE PLOUGHING SOCIETY}was   
 held at BLAIRGORTS FARM, in March {   
{1835.}Forty pairs of horses were      
 entered and the winner of that first  
 competition was ALEX RISK. In{1891}a  
 new and independent society was formed
 and competition was open to all       
 those within a radius of two miles of 
 BUCHLYVIE. By{1942}this was extended  
 to include tenants on GARTMORE ESTATE 
 and four years later prizes were      
 offered for best bull and the growing 
 of turnips and potatoes. This,        
 however, no longer forms part of the  
 competition. Today the competition is 
 open to anyone in the country and this
 year,{1985,}the{150th ANNIVERSARY}of  
 the{SOCIETY,}saw the return of horses 
 to the competition after being        
 dominated for many years by tractors.
