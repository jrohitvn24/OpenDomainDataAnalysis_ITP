 Penicuik is a commuter town.  People  
 travel out of it to go to work.  They 
 mostly travel into Edinburgh which is 
 12 miles away.  We did a survey of P.6
 and P.7 in our school.  Out of 108    
 families only eleven of the fathers   
 worked in Penicuik.  Most people who  
 travel go by car.  The roads to       
 Edinburgh are not very good although  
 they are used by lots of people.  We  
 only have 2 very small bits of dual   
 carriageway and together they are 2m  
 long.  It takes about 20 minutes to   
 travel to Edinburgh by car.  There are
 buses owned by Scottish Omnibuses,    
 which run every 30 minutes.  It takes 
 30-45 minutes to travel to Edinburgh  
 by bus.  Penicuik used to have a      
 railway line and a station but these  
 were disbanded many years ago.
