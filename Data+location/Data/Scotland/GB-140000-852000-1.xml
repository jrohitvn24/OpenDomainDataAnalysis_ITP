		<content> The main road of North Skye runs S.E. 
 /N.W. To the west lies Loch Snizart   
 Beag, to the east the moorlands and   
 hills of Trotternish. Across the Loch 
 is Aird Bernisdale, the tip of a small
 peninsula jutting into the loch. Much 
 of the flat land is laid out in       
 regular patterns (called crofts), many
 with modern houses - old homes rarely 
 being renovated. Sparsely populated.  
 the working adults rely on more than  
 one occupation, with crofting being   
 the secondary. Crofting today, mostly,
 meaning keeping sheep. 'Bed and

 occupation to serve the many tourists

 well-established garden nursery, owner
 makes his own compost. There is a     
 small post office, which is also a    
 small grocers serving local needs.
