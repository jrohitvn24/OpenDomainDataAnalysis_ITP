		<content> _This isolated and uninhabited hill   
 area is dominated by the E/W ridge of 
 Morven Hill which forms the southern  
 boundary of the block. The basic      
 igneous rock that underleis the       
 central and soutehrn portions of the  
 block results in a more grassy        
 heathland than is normal in this      
 heather dominated region.             
 The NW corner of the block is occupied
 by the headwaters of the Deskry Water,
 the course of which is followed by a  
 land rover track. North of this burn, 
 the eastern part is afforested with a 
 dense plantation of conifers.         
 The only human activity apart from    
 forest management is a seasonal       
 grazing of sheep and shooting of      
 grouse.
