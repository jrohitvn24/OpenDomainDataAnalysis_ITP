 the A822. There is a gate into it on  
 the side of the road that leads into{ 
{BRACO.}There are {Defence Ditches}all 
 the way round it,most of them are     
 facing{North.} There are a couple of  
 DEFENCE{DITCHES}facing {south}.There  
 is a big wood next to the fort.It is  
 1400ft from  north to south and nearly
 1400ft from west to east.There are    
 only a couple of {defence ditches     
 facing south because it is all swampy 
 just there.                           
 The {defence ditches}are dug to tire  
 enemies out when they are attacking   
 the{fort}.There is a {Roman Bridge

 Gaul,  and he was sent over to {Govern
{Britain}for 6 years. He built {Ardoch
