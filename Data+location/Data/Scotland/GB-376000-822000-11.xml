		<title>11Farming-Commercial-Lethenty</title>
		<content> Lethenty forms one part of a farming  
 unit comprising East Balhalgardy,     
 Lethenty and another smaller farm     
 which falls just to the north of our  
 block. The land is owned by Mr        
 Maitland of East Balhalgardy and is   
 used mostly for grazing cattle and    
 growing barley and wheat.  The farm   
 buildings are used for storing silage 
 and for housing calves before they are
 old enough to be put out to grass.    
 Next to the farm buildings is what    
 used to be Lethenty Mill to which     
 local farmers brought their grain to  
 be processed  and returned to them as 
 cattle food.  Nowadays the buildings  
 at Lethenty Mill are used by a        
 manufacturer of pine household        
 furniture and as a car repair         
 workshop.
