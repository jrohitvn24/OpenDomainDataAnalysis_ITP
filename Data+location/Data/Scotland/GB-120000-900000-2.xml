		<content> Everyone here is related to each      
 other! Maybe a while ago (when there  
 were more people) not everyone would  
 be related to each other but now there
 are only 12 people in the village and 
 everyone is related. The oldest       
 inhabitant is Mrs Marion Mackay. She  
 lives at {Burnside}with her son, Mr   
 Kenneth Mackay (the postman), his wife
 Moira (the teacher) and their three   
 year old son, Duncan. Mrs Mackay's    
 daughter Catherine lives at {Sith     
{Phort} with her husband, Alasdair     
 Mackay and two children Marianne (14) 
 and Fiona (10). Mrs Marion Mackay's   
 brother, Roderick MacInnes lives      
 at Salacha and her sister in law, Mrs 
 Marion MacInnes lives at{Tigh na Mara}
 with her daughter Katie MacInnes and  
 granddaughter Lorna MacInnes(16).     
 Marianne is at school in Tarbert,Lorna
 at Stornoway and Fiona at Rhenigidale.</content>
