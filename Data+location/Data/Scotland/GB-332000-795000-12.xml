		<title>12POSTIES LEAP FOOTBRIDGE</title>
		<content> Part of the programme of environmental
 education at Ballater Field Centre    
 (BFC) involves practical conservation 
 projects. Project '85 was the         
 replacement of a footbridge on an     
 attractive and popular walk along the 
 banks of the Dee. The previous bridge 
 which was built to carry the proposed 
 railway to Braemar c.1866 had reached 
 the end of its useful life. For some  
 time previously the local community   
 and the landowner had been in conflict
 over replacement. BFC with full       
 agreement of both parties and grant   
 aid from CCS undertook the building of
 a new bridge. The work took place in  
 July with the help of centre staff and
 young volunteers. A simple wooden     
 design was chosen as most appropriate.
 The bridge was completed within a     
 week.                                 
                                       </content>
