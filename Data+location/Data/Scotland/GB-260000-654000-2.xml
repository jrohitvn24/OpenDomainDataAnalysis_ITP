   Being a New Town most industries are
 modern and are located in industrial  
 estates. There are two of these in our
 area both to be found on the outskirts
 of the town and alongside main access 
 roads for heavy lorries: College Mil- 
 ton on the Queensway and Nerston close
 by the Expressway which links with the
 main M74 motorway to Glasgow or the   
 South. Companies big and small share  
 these estates making a variety of     
 goods (eg Rolls-Royce ; aero engines :
 Radio Times ; printing : NCS ; Machine
 Tools : Scotbeef ; fresh and canned   
 meat : Schweppes ; soft drinks).      
   Most of the industries would be     
 classified as light industry :-       
 (engineering, electronics, food and   
 drink, clothing, etc) with a large    
 number of women being employed in the 
 192 different factories in the area.  </content>
