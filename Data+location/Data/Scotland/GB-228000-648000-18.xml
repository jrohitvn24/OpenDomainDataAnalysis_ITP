		<title>18NEWCOMERS' VIEW OF DALRY</title>
		<content> We are an elderly couple, who came to 
 Dalry from London two years ago, due  
 to family changes.                    
 Our immediate impression was of the   
 friendly and helpful attitude of the  
 local people.  We found banking,      
 mortgage facilities and legal services
 readily available.  Medical and       
 optical attention has been good.      
 General groceries are available in the
 town centre and the more intimate     
 "Corner Shop" is always ready to      
 obtain unstocked items.               
 The Episcopalian Church serves our    
 religious needs and the older         
 residents are not forgotten in town   
 celebrations.                         
 The main thing we miss is Common Land 
 as we came originally from Forest Land
 where we enjoyed the open spaces.     
 However, to compensate, we have the   
 sea not far away and farmland around. </content>
