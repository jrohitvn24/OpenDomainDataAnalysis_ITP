 There are no shops on Canna. Islanders
 are dependant upon the mainland for   
 most of their requirements. Mallaig is
 our main source of goods. Groceries   
 are usually ordered by post or        
 telephone to one of the local shops,  
 as are items from the chemist or      
 off-licence. These are then delivered 
 by the ferry. All goods brought on the
 ferry are subject to carriage charges,
 thus raising housekeeping costs.      
 Mail order facilities are used for    
 non_perishable commodities such as    
 clothes, furniture, household goods   
 etc. Some of the larger mail order    
 catalogues do not charge sea freight  
 for sending goods to the island, but  
 most of the larger items of household 
 equipment have to be paid for.
