		<title>20HOUSING IN POLLOK, GLASGOW</title>
		<content> The majority of housing in the area   
 was built during the 20 yrs.following 
 WW2;by the council.Pollok however is  
 by no means a homogeneous estate as   
 there is a wide variety of house types
 2,3,4,storey tenenments 4 in a block, 
 semi-detached,terraced and detached.  
 There is a shortage of special needs  
 housing.{PROBLEMS:}some of the        
 housing is of low quality and dampness
 and vandalism have become a major     
 problem. Improvements have been taking
 place with the modernisation of       
 housing, demolition of poorer quality 
 housing and private developers moving 
 into the area.{CONTRIBUTORS:-} St
