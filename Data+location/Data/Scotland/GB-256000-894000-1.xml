 block lies NE and SW of the Kyle of   
 Sutherland.   Valley land intensively 
 farmed, some of which is reconstructed
 after gravel extraction at Inveren    
 Quarry.   The remainder of the block  
 consists mainly of coniferous woodland
 and moorland.  Unlike many surrounding
 squares it offers employment other

 Invershin there is a 24 bedroom hotel
