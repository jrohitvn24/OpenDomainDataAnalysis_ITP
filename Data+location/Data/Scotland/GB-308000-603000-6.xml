		<title>06MOFFAT FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>    First commisioned in September 1979
 this attractive modern building,with  
 raised rose beds and bench for the    
 weary walker,at first glance masks its
 serious purpose.Situated on the road  
 to Selkirk yet within easy reach of   
 the town the Station is 'home' for    
 Moffat's retained force.11 firemen(1  
 Sub-officer,1Leading Fireman and 9    
 firemen)are available to answer any   
 call,night or day;leaving their normal
 jobs and even their beds to do so.A   
 999 call will within moments alert the
 force by means of the radio pagers    
 carried at all times by each man.The  
 call may be to a forest fire,a road   
 accident,a chimney fire or even a     
 horse stuck in a pit! Its all in a    
 day's work for a rural force,embracing
 occupations such as mechanics,a       
 teacher and self employed persons.The 
 current vehicle is a Dodge 500.       </content>
