		<title>16OUR HOMES IN DAVIOT.</title>
		<content> There are no housing estates in       
 Daviot.Most houses are quite far from 
 any others.                           
         There are ten families in     
 school and five of them live in       
 houses that are about one hundred     
 years old and the other five families 
 live in houses that have been built in
 the last ten years.All the houses have
 quite big gardens and they all have   
 three or more bedrooms.Some of the    
 homes have five or six bedrooms and   
 they do 'Bed and Breakfast' for the   
 tourists.                             
        One house in Daviot used to be 
 the old Post Office and a shop but it 
 is just a home now. There are no shops
 in Daviot,just a 'phone box and a     
 pillar box.One family live in the     
 station master's house,which is not   
 needed now as the station is closed.
