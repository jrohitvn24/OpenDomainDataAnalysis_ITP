		<content> Families in this area use various     
 health centres.Most of them attend the
 Cupar one but several go to Newport.  
 Hospital treatment is more varied.    
 Ninewells Hospital and the Royal      
 Infirmary in Dundee are used as much  
 as the Victoria Infirmary in Kirkcaldy
 and the Adamson Hospital in Cupar.Most
 new babies are born in Forth Park     
 Maternity Unit in Kirkcaldy or at     
 Ninewells Hospital.A nurse from Cupar 
 Health Centre visits the school and   
 sees all children irrespective of     
 their family doctor. The school doctor
 ,who pays a yearly visit to the school
 is also in Cupar. The school dentist  
 from the St Andrews area visits once  
 yearly in the autumn term.Treatment is
 carried out in the mobile dental      
 caravan.Most children now have        
 treatment from their own dentist in   
 Cupar,Newport,St Andrews or Dundee.   </content>
