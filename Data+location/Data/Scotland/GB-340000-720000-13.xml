		<title>13The Quarry at Balmullo</title>
		<content> You can see Balmullo from miles away  
 because of a very distinctive feature.
 The village nestles at the foot of a  
 hill and one side of that hill is     
 bright orange!   That is because it is
 the site of a roadstone quarry.       
 Every now and then we hear a series of
 explosions and we know that the quarry
 is being blasted to allow the         
 quarry-men to obtain more rock.       
                                       
 The present quarry is worked by a     
 company which was registered in l925  
 but quarrying was done there before   
 then.   It is thought that some of the
 buildings in the village, including   
 the old school and schoolhouse, were  
 built from stone quarried there.      
 Much of the stone is now used as road 
 stone and because of its red colour it
 is used for garden paths and when     
 finely ground, for sports surfaces.   </content>
