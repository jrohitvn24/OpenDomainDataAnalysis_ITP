		<content> ABERDEEN: BRANCH LIBRARIES.           
                                       
 The library service in Aberdeen is    
 generally very good although many     
 people on the larger estates feel they
 are not well served. People on the    
 the largest estate - Tillydrone -     
 have to go to either Woodend or       
 Linksfield Libraries; both involve a  
 journey by bus. Local people are also 
 worried by the possibility that some  
 branch libraries may be closed by the 
 Council in an effort to save money.   
                                       
 Our libraries are open six days a     
 week, usually from 9am until 8pm.     
 One library, situated in the Old Town 
 House is open only in the afternoons  
 and Saturday morning.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
