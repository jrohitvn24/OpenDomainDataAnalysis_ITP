   As soon as we went into Bucksburn   
 Police Station Division "B" we waited 
 for Constable Mackie beside the desk. 
 First we went into the computer room  
 we were allowed to type in our Dads   
 registration number plates. Then we   
 went to the room where you get        
 charged. After that room where they   
 had souvenirs. There were knuckle     
 dusters, and hats. There was a bit of 
 metal that had bits cut out of it. It 
 was found in Pitodrie Football ground 
 last season. It had been thrown by one
 of the supporters. Next we went to the
 room where the breathaliser was       
 kept. Sarah was allowed to use it.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
