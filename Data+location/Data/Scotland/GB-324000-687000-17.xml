		<title>17HOUSING, KIRKCALDY-KINGHORN</title>
		<content> The housing in this area can be       
 divided into three main categories.   
 In the lower part of Kirkcaldy housing
 is local authority , dating from the  
 1950's.                               
 In the upper part of Kinghorn the     
 housing is predominantly private, with
 some dating from the turn of the      
 century and others being present day. 
 The remaining category is made up of  
 the farms and their associated        
 cottages etc.
