		<title>13Legends of Westhill.</title>
		<content> There are many interesting{Stories }  
{and legends}of Westhill.One of these  
 concerns Malcolm Gillespie who had the
 job of catching people who made       
 illegal whisky. But in 1827 he was    
 publicly hanged for forgery and was   
 the last person publicly executed in  
 Aberdeen.                             
                                       
 Another interesting legend is about   
 how Westhill got its name.Alexander   
 Smith owned an area called Blackhills 
 and his brother owned property called 
 Wester Kinmundy.But when both men died
 both properties were bought but the   
 new owner disliked the names.He       
 therefore he took the west from Wester
 Kinmundy and the hill from Blackhills 
 and thats how Westhill got its name.
