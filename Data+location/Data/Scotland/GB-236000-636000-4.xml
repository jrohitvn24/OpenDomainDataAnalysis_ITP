		<title>04 SHOPPING FACILITIES</title>
		<content> There are very few shopping facilities
in this area. The reason for this is   
that the demand for such amenities is  
not great. In Crosshouse there are 8   
shops and also a post office.These 8   
shops are situated together in the     
centre of the town and so a small      
shopping centre for the villagers is   
formed.The shops include a supermarket 
and a chip shop as well as an          
off-licence. Gatehead is  a very small 
community and therefore has virtually  
no shopping facilities.They have a post
office which also acts as a general    
store where one can buy most of ones   
shopping.Springside has only 2 shops as
well as a post office.The post office  
as in Gatehead, is also a general      
store.
