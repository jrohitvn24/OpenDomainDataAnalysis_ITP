		<title>18PITFIRRANE GOLF COURSE</title>
		<content>    The course of just over 6000 yards 
 is owned by Dunfermline Golf Club, and
 the yearly subscription to play on the
 Pitfirrane Golf course is Â£122 for men
 and Â£66 for women. Par for the course 
 is 72, and the scratch standard is 70,
 but the course record is 64. While the
 Dunfermline golf Club was founded in  
 1867, it only moved to this site in   
 1953.                                 
  A member of the club told us that the
 course is very good but takes alot    
 of skill to perfect it.One bad feature
 of the course is that it can get very 
 muddy in winter,but most of the year  
 the ground is reasonable.             
    The course is not too long and not 
 too short, a good length, through a   
 mixture of woodland and rolling open  
 landscape, making the course very     
 difficult even for the best of        
 players.                              </content>
