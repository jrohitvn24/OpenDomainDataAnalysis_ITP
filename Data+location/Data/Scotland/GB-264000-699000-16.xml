		<title>16THORNHILL CLUBS</title>
		<content> There are six kinds of youth clubs in 
 the village; Scouts, Cubs, Guides,    
 Brownies, Toddlers and the Playgroup. 
 Like almost all rural communities, we 
 have a W.R.I. (Womans Rural           
 Institute). This is important in a    
 community like this as it is often    
 the only chance ladies have of meeting
 one another. The W.R.I. have speakers,
 and competitions, eg. for the best    
 "Tattie scones", the best raspberry   
 jam, and the best hand-knitted jacket.
 There is a Drama Club which does two  
 productions a year, usually a play  in
 the summer, and a pantomime at        
 Christmas.  There is also a Gardening 
 Club which meets once a month. There  
 is also a T.O.F.F.S. club (Thornhill  
 OLd Folks Friendly Society) for older 
 people. They meet once a month.
