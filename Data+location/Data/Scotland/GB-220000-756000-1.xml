		<title>01A BLOCK FROM THE HIGHLANDS</title>
		<content> This block is part of the Western     
 Scottish Highlands, comprising Glencoe
 and the mountains rising on its north 
 side. Across these mountains runs an  
 ancient path from the Glencoe valley, 
 eventually to reach Kinlockleven,     
 fifteen miles away. Only part is in   
 this block. The Glencoe sector of the 
 path to very steep so basheen         
 zig-zagged to help the traveller. This
 is the devils staircase. To each side 
 of the path the peaks are: Srona      
 Choire, Odhair-bhig, Beins Bheag, Stob
 Mhic Mhartuin and Stob Beins a        
 Chralaide. At the Glencoe end of the  
 path is the A82, the only road in the 
 block. The river Coupall runs parallel
 to this road. There are three         
 buildings in this section, all on the 
 A82. Two were original crofts, one now
 being a house and the other a barn.   
 There is one present-day house.       </content>
