		<title>1240 YEARS FARMING IN DAVIOT</title>
		<content>  {Memories of my grandmother.         
                                       
                                       
 "I came to Daviot 40 years ago.Farming
 has changed a lot.The{tractor}was     
 small and noisy.  I liked the         
{horse}more than the tractor.          
   Forty years ago you had to{milk}the 
 cow by hand now you milk the cow by   
 machine.It is much faster.If cows are 
 well fed they can give a great amount 
 of milk.                              
   The{price of cows and sheep}has     
 changed a lot.Nowadays its about ten  
 times as much as it was then.         
  {Medicines}have changed and there    
 is more medicines. Today medicines    
 cost much more."
