		<title>19Moy Summary</title>
		<content>  Moy lies on a quiet curve of the old 
 A9. A quiet, scattered community      
 edged by a main rail line and the fast
 new A9 roadway. It experiences the    
 best of both worlds with peaceful     
 surroundings lying so close to the    
 busy centre of Inverness.             
  There has been a considerable        
 changeover in the population. People  
 from different backgrounds integrate  
 well within this lovely area.         
  The changes with depopulation and now
 people moving into the area  have been
 inevitable and are typical of many    
 villages in the Highlands.            
                                       
  Rushing to the future we ought to    
 consider more carefuly the present and
 the past, our people and our          
 countryside.                          
                                       
  PLEASE TAKE CARE OF OUR RURAL AREAS  </content>
