		<title>11DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content> There are four dairy farms in our     
 area. One of the farms is very near to
 the school and they keep Friesian and 
 Ayrshire cattle for milking. Another  
 farm in our area also keeps Friesians 
 and on the farm where I live, the     
 farmer keeps about ninety Friesians in
 his herd. He also uses the animals for
 breeding purposes and there are about 
 thirty calves this summer. The farmer 
 can milk five cows at one time and the
 milk which is produced is cleaned     
 and goes into a big tank at the farm. 
 Then a large tanker lorry comes to    
 collect the milk and it is taken to   
 Aberdeen where it is used to produce  
 milk products such cream, cheese,     
 butter and yoghurt or is sold as milk.
 We are still buying our milk in pint  
 measures but it is to be changed to   
 litres eventually.
