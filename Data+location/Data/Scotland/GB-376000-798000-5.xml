		<title>05A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> My name is Linda Bisset,here is my    
 life style. I lead quite an           
 interesting life, because I am quite  
 busy.                                 
 On Sundays I go to Sunday School while
 on Wednesday evenings I take piano    
 lessons. On Thursday mornings I go    
 with the other pupils in my class to  
 swimming lessons in the Trainer Pool  
 at Banchory Academy which is our local
 Secondary School. On Thursday evenings
 I go to Athletics Club which I enjoy  
 very much because we do interesting   
 things like high jump, long jump and  
 lots of running.                      
 I also help my father who is farmer at
 Tersets Farm, Drumoak. In winter I    
 help to feed the cows, take in straw  
 for them to sleep on and feed the hens
 and ducks. In summer I help him to    
 stack up hay then take it to the barn.
