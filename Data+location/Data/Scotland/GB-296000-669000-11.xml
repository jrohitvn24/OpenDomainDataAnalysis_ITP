		<title>11Bathgate Hills Superstitions</title>
		<content>    The Bathgate Hills are very        
 mysterious, especially The Knock,     
 Cairnpapple and The Clinkin' Stane.   
 Many years ago people were            
 superstitious, they saw witches,      
 skeletons in armour, hobgoblins and   
 other kinds of monsters.   A few      
 people believe in the Clinkin' Stane, 
 clinking at 12 midnight to commemorate
 the death of a man who had been       
 fighting with another man over a      
 woman.                                
      Cairnpapple is mysterious, it has
 a few axe heads from Llandudno and    
 Rhyl, in North Wales.   An axe head,  
 found in Cairnpapple, was matched with
 one from Stonehenge.   These axes were
 thought to have been used in          
 sacrificial terms and in battling with
 other nearby tribes, trying to gain   
 more territory.   These battles were  
 very vicious.                         </content>
