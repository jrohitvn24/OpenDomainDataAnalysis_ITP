		<title>04OLD ST. PETER'S, THURSO</title>
		<content>   The most interesting old building in
 our part of{Thurso}is{Old St. Peter's 
{Kirk.}A church was founded on this    
 site in 1220 but present remains      
 date mainly from the 17th century. The
 church was last used as a place of    
 worship in 1832.                      
   A society called the Friends of Old 
 St. Peter's, formed in 1963, raises   
 money to preserve the roofless ruins. 
 A large tracery window has been       
 repaired and other work carried out as
 funds allow.                          
   The interesting old graveyard has a 
 grave dating back to the 14th Century.
 However, most that were able to be    
 read were from the 18th and early 19th
 Centuries.                            
   Today it is a tourist attraction in 
 a pleasant part of old{Thurso}near    
 the harbour and the river estuary.
