		<content> In the Biggar area there is a great   
 deal of interest in {Recreation.}One  
 of the most popular sports in the area
 is {Rugby} and usually three teams are
 playing every weeekend in the season.{
{Golf} is another popular pastime and  
 the Municipal Golf Course at Biggar is
 well patronized. Next to the Golf     
 course is a small boating pond and a  
 caraavan site ,where a few permanent  
 caravans are to be found.One          
 rereational facility,which people have
 been wanting for a long time is a {   
{Swimming Pool,}but this seems unlikely
 due to the present economic climate . 
 For those people less inclined to     
 sporting activities,there are a number
 of Leisure courses run in the         
 Gillespie centre and Biggar High      
 School.
