		<content>  The land from Aultnacardoch to the   
 main road was once owned by the       
 Bishops of Beauly.Then it was split   
 into three parts and sold.One third   
 went to Sandy Lawson and became       
 Lentran Home Farm.                    
  The second bit became Lentran house  
 and area, and the third was bought by 
 a group of people and became Newton   
 Hill and Holme woodlands.Lentran House
 was to be a health farm but never     
 succeeded, and was empty for quite a  
 few years before it was bought by the 
 Greggors.                             
  Then,they sold it and it was bought  
 by the Davies.Now, the Davies' have   
 sold it and it is owned by an         
 Egyptian called Mr.Isaac,who will make
 it into a nursing home .Some land     
 behind Aultnacardoch is owned by Lord 
 Burton.
