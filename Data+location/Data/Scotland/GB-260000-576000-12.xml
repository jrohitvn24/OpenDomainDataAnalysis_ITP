		<content> The Clydesdale Bank is the only bank  
 in New Galloway and our poll showed   
 that 80%of the local population use   
 it.It is a relatively small bank,     
 consisting of the Manager and 2 staff.
 The Dunfermline Building Society in   
 Castle Douglas, sends a representative
 weekly to the school and approximately
 40%of the children are involved in the
 savings scheme.  There is a Community 
 Council which holds a bank account.   
 Any local group or club in need of    
 funds may apply to this council for   
 help. The Stewartry Educational       
 Council,also,provides financial aid.  
 An apprenticeship trust exists locally
 to help youths staring on a career.   
 Financial matters relating to the     
 whole village are decided by the      
 Stewartry District Council and at a   
 higher level, Dumfries and Galloway   
 Regional Council.                     </content>
