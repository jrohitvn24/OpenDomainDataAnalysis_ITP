		<title>09Our Local School</title>
		<content> The school building in the village of 
 Kirkfieldbank dates from 1876,        
 although there was a school here long 
 before that date. All the local       
 children used to start and finish     
 their education in the present school.
 It was then called a Junior Secondary 
 School. Pupils used to leave school at
 the age of 14 years. For the past     
 twenty years or so pupils have stayed 
 for only seven years, leaving at      
 between 11\ years and 12\ years and   
 going on up to Lanark Grammar School. 
 Lessons too, have changed. There is   
 less rote learning and silent working.
 Now children study in a friendly,     
 stimulating atmosphere, and are often 
 out studying the surrounding          
 environment. Some children walk to the
 school, others come by bus.
