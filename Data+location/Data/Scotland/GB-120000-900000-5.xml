		<content> My name is Fiona Mackay. I am 10 years
 old and I go to school at Rhenigidale 
 Primary School in Rhenigidale. I am   
 the only pupil in the whole school!   
 There is only one teacher here as     
 well, my aunt, Mrs Moira Mackay. The  
 school building is divided into two   
 rooms with a classroom and another    
 room for the library/church. The      
 classroom is a normal school with a   
 blackboard, cupboards, books, tables  
 and chairs etc. even a computer! About
 70 years ago there would have been    
 about 25 pupils as the population was 
 then about 100. I have a 14 year old  
 sister Marianne but she goes to the   
 Sir E. Scott School in Tarbert. She   
 has to stay in lodgings during the    
 week but she comes home at weekends.  
 My parents walk over and collect her  
 after school on Fridays and they take 
 her back over on Sundays.             </content>
