		<content> The Timber Merchant John N. Jack Ltd  
 bought over the business as a going   
 concern 25 years ago.  Since then he  
 has seen a steady decline in business.
 He now employes 12 full time workers  
 with two vehicles for local delivery, 
 long hauls are given to the local     
 Haulage Contracters J.B. Nelson.  Mr  
 Jack used to travel throughout        
 Scotland cutting his own trees, this  
 became uneconomical ten years ago.  He
 now deals in Softwood Conifers        
 delivered to him from all over        
 Scotland.  He recently received a     
 delivery from Balmoral, The Queens    
 Estate.  He saws the trees into       
 Battens, Floor Joists, Planks etc.  He
 also makes and sells Fencing, Huts,   
 Sheds etc.  Over 70% of his market    
 went to England in the last few       
 months.
