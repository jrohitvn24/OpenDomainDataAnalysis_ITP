		<title>09GREENKNOWE TOWER</title>
		<content> People three hundred  years ago lived 
 in stone towers called peel towers.   
 Peel towers were used in the Borders  
 as protection against the English.    
 A  typical example is Greenknowe      
 tower.Greenknowe tower is on the      
 outskirts of Greenknowe estate and    
 just outside Gordon.The owners were   
 the Lyal family who were Scottish     
 lairds.                               
     The state of Greenknowe tower is  
 quite good considering it has been    
 left to crumble for many years.The    
 tower is almost complete except for   
 the third and fourth floors which were
  taken out when the Lyal family moved.
 There are five floors which consist of
 a dining room,dungeon,cellar,bedrooms,
 kitchen,hall and a servants quarter.To
 gain access to the tower you have to  
 ask Mr Forsyth for the key.His job is 
 to make sure the tower is safe.       </content>
