 Unst Airport was built in its present 
 form in 1979,though there was an      
 airstrip there from the 1950s.The     
 airport is run by Airworks Ltd. At    
 this time they have 20 local people   
 employed.Three helicopters are based  
 here,and with fixedwing aircraft there
 are 30 to 50 flights in and out every 
 day.Every year the runway is rebuilt  
 to stop it from sinking.There are lots
 of different jobs from the Manager to 
 the tea ladies.Aircraft fly to and    
 from Aberdeen with oilworkers, and    
 Loganair fly a daily scheduled service
 to Lerwick and Edinburgh.             
 Helicopters,owned by Bristows fly to  
 the different oil rigs owned by       
 Chevron.There are usually a couple of 
 emergency flights a week if           
 helicopters or planes run out of fuel 
 or have some mechanical problem.      </content>
