		<title>11THE TOWN CENTRE</title>
		<content> Livingston shopping centre is         
 completely under cover and includes   
 some large chainstores eg. Woolco,    
 Presto, Fine Fare and John Menzies as 
 well as dozens of smaller shops.  A   
 large proportion of the people who    
 work in the centre are teenagers who  
 take part time jobs such as           
 shelf-packing and working on the      
 tills.                                
 Right next to the shopping centre is  
 the Bus Station.  This is conveniently
 placed between Glasgow and Edinburgh  
 and so plays a major part in the bus  
 network of Central Scotland.          
 Livingston Development Corporation has
 recently moved all of its offices to  
 the town centre as has the local      
 Police Station                        
 Livingston Centre also has massive    
 car parking facilities.
