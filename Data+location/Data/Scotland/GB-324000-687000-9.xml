		<title>09MINER IN SEAFIELD, KIRKCALDY</title>
		<content> Although opened 20 years ago Seafield 
 Colliery now represents the major     
 single source of employment in        
 Kirkcaldy and surrounding districts.  
 The mine currently employs 1160 miners
 together with a further 80 people     
 employed in managerial, secreterial,  
 catering and nursing capacities.      
 Four shifts are operated in each      
 24-hour period. The miner descends in 
 the lift cage which carries 100 men at
 a time. He will then continue his     
 underground journey by train, which   
 will take him 85-90% of the way, the  
 remainder being done on foot.         
 Each man spends 7.25 hours            
 underground, of which 1\-2 hours      
 is spent travelling to and from the   
 coal face.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
