		<content>     The Golf Course in Cardross was   
 founded in 1895 as a 6 holed course   
 behind the railway. Then in 1904 it   
 was moved to the other side of the    
 main road because golfers wanted a    
 full sized course. The Golf Club      
 bought a bigger piece of ground. Now  
 in 1985 there are 750 members, 80%    
 adults and 20% juniors. It employs 10 
 people who either full time or part   
 time.                                 
     The majority of members are men   
 who either live locally or in Glasgow.
 The Golf Club in Cardross is very     
 important for the village. The course 
 is very difficult, being one of the   
 best courses in Dunbartonshire.
