		<title>01ON THE FRINGES OF KILSYTH</title>
		<content>   Kilsyth is a small town of 10,000   
 people,about 15 miles N.E. of Glasgow.
 Our block includes the N.W. quarter of
 the town-largely {residential}in      
 nature.Most of our block,however,     
 consists of{farmland}stretching up the
 slopes of the {Campsie Fells.         
   The countryside is very attractive, 
 and is used for walking,bird-watching,
 and picnics.The hills rise to over 450
 metres,and give scenic views over the{
{Kelvin Valley.}                       
   Our area has a long {history}       
 ,although much of the evidence has    
 been destroyed.A{stone-age axe}was    
 found near Bogside Farm;there is a    
 medieval"motte"close-by,and the ruins 
 of Kilsyth Castle can still be seen.{ 
{Antonines Wall,}built by the Romans,  
 passes by to the South of our area.
