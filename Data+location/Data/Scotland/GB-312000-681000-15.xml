		<content> In this area the main crops are wheat,
 barley, oats, potatoes and turnips.   
 Grazing is not very popular although  
 it does take place.                   
                                       
 Ever since the{E.E.C.}started paying  
 farmers to grow{oilseed rape,}to get  
 the oil, to make margerines, this has 
 become a very popular crop. It is     
 easily recognised when it is in full  
 bloom as the flowers are plentiful and
 also are bright yellow.               
                                       
 The farmer who farms nearest the shool
 plants his crops in rotation. The     
 field directly opposite the school    
 usually has wheat, barley or oats in  
 it but this year it was planted with  
 rapeseed, as were quite a few other   
 fields.
