		<title>20Then and Now.</title>
		<content> The main changes that have taken place
 in the area in recent times have been 
 as follows.                           
 Houses have improved. They now have   
 lots of machines to do the work.      
 The railway line is closed and is now 
 the Speyside Way.                     
 Roads are wider and better surfaced   
 and more people have cars.            
 There used to be more shops like      
 tailors and shoe makers. Now that     
 people are doing some of their        
 shopping elsewhere there are not so   
 many shops.                           
 There have been a lot of new houses   
 built recently.                       
 There used to be no unemployment in   
 the place. Everyone had some job to   
 do.                                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
