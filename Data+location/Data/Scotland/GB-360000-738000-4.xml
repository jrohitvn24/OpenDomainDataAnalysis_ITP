		<title>04EMPLOYMENT IN ARBROATH.</title>
		<content> Unemployment is high in Arbroath.The  
 main area of{industry}lies on the edge
 of town  just off the main Dundee     
 road.Most of the factories are fairly 
 new and some{housing}has grown up     
 around them.Halliburtons,a multi      
 national company,is the major         
 employer.They make oil pumps and their
 headquarters are in the U.S.A.Francis 
 Webster's is involved in the weaving{ 
{trade}and have just opened their new  
 factory on the estate.Other factories 
 on the estate include Metal Box,      
 Scottish Road Services,who deal with  
 transport,The Knitwear factory,and    
 Henderson's who design kitchen tools  
 and accessories.The range of factories
 means that even if one of the         
 factories has to closedown and pay men
 off there will be many jobs left      
 because they are all different types  
 of manufacturers.                     </content>
