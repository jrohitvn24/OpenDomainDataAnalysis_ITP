		<title>16NAIRN:LOCAL SHOP</title>
		<content> The only local shop in our area is the
 Spar.The owner is Mr G Jarden.The shop
 is open every day apart from Sunday.It
 openS from 8.30-1.00 and from 2.00 to 
 6.00.                                 
   The shop has to serve a large area  
 of housing although most people in    
 Achareidh find it as convenient to go 
 to the High Street.                   
   The shop supplies a large range of  
 goods from newspapers and hardware to 
 grceries and meat. Few people do thier
 main shopping here (many go to the    
 large stores in Inverness) but most   
 locals visit at least once a week. For
 those who cannot easily get elsewhere 
 e.g. the old, it saves a long walk to 
 the town centre especially in cold or 
 wet weather.                          
   Many people meet at the shop and it 
 is a useful focus for the community   
 both young and old.                   </content>
