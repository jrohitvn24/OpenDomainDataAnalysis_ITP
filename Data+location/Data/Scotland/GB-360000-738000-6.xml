		<title>06ARBROATH SMOKED HADDOCK.</title>
		<content> We interviewed two local shopkeepers  
 from our area.We found out that       
 smokies are actually smoked haddock.  
 To smoke them you put them in what    
 they call a barrow which is a big pit.
 After being smoked for forty minutes  
 by hardwood logs they are ready to be 
 sold.Most are sold locally or sent to 
 London but some are exported abroad.  
 The smokie{trade}is a growth{industry 
{. }More locals are involved in making 
 smokies than at the turn of the       
 century.                              
 They are made in the same way that    
 they were made when smokies were first
 introduced.Smokies have become part of
 Arbroath's {local history.}They are   
 very popular with {tourists.}They are 
 a local delicacy and are very tasty.  
 Some tourists take them home for their
 family to enjoy.
