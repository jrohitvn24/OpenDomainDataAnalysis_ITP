		<title>12A Pheasantry</title>
		<content> On the 7th May we went to a pheasantry
 at Keplahill.Mr Davidson has owned the
 pheasantry for 15 years,but he lives  
 in Longside.Soon he will be moving to 
 Keplahill because there has been a    
 lot of burglaries.This year Mr        
 Davidson is just breeding pheasantry  
 but last year he breed ducks as well. 
 Just now he has about four hundred    
 pheasants,but when the eggs hatch he  
 should have nearly a thousand chicks. 
 He sells the chicks live for shooting.
 They are one to six weeks when they   
 are sold.Young chicks cost Â£2.50 and  
 pheasant who haven't laid eggs they   
 cost Â£2.00.Mr Davidson keeps the      
 female pheasants for six or seven     
 months.The hens on average lay five   
 eggs a week.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
