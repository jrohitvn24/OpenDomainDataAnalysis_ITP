		<title>10RECREATION IN CRUDEN BAY.</title>
		<content> Port Erroll football club is a new    
 club in Cruden Bay consisting of boys 
 from Cruden Bay and the neighbouring  
 village of Hatton. There are two age  
 groups, under 14 and under 16. Colin  
 Nicoll originally thought of the team 
 and got together a meeting of men who 
 were interested in junior football. A 
 committee was formed and the Chairman 
 is R. Birnie, treasurer, I. Robertson,
 and Manager F. Platt. The under 16s   
 have not won a game yet so are bottom 
 of their League. THeir games are on   
 Mondays and Wednesdays. The under 14s 
 are doing slightly better. They beat  
 Dales park by 3 goals to 1.           
      Golf, badminton, bowls,(indoor   
 and outdoor) are also played in Cruden
 Bay.
