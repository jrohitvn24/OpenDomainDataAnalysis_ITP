 Triumph.The kinds of potatoes are

 are{cattle, sheep and some horses}.The
 horses are owned by people from the   
 village.                              
 There is no specific cattle breed     
 because the cattle are cross bred for 
 beef. They have a lot of sheep and in 
 Spring they have lambs. The sheds are 
 mainly used for storing things in     
 although one shed is used for cattle. 
 They do not live in the original{house
 because it is a ruin and they have    
  built another house and that is the  
 one they live in now. (G.JOHNSTON,
