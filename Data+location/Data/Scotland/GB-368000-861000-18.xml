		<title>18Living in the Town</title>
		<content>  Many of the buildings in the town of 
 Banff are very old. I live, with my   
 parents and brother, in an old part of
 the town.My dad is a lawyer here, his 
 office is in Low Street. Sometimes my 
 mum is asked to teach home economics  
 at the Academy when they are short    
 staffed.I prefer it when she stays at 
 home. During the week we usually stay 
 at home and watch television.         
  At the weekend we do our shopping. We
 buy very little in Banff.All our      
 clothes are bought in Aberdeen and    
 most of our food. We go in about once 
 a month and bulk buy our food from one
 of the large superstores. Because of  
 limited choice, we only buy small     
 items in the local shops.             
  Sometimes,I wander through town with 
 my friends,or go to the local park to 
 cycle and play on the swings. I like  
 Banff but wish it had more shops.     </content>
