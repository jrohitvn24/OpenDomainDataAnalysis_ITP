		<title>03Education of Norham children</title>
		<content> Children aged 3 to 5 attend Nursery   
 class 3 half days per week, this is   
 held in Norham Primary school.        
 5-9 year olds attend the primary      
 school in the village.                
 9-13 year olds travel by double-decker
 bus 7 miles to Berwick upon Tweed to  
 the Berwick middle school. This school
 serves Berwick town and country areas 
 but excludes the Tweedmouth areas.    
 13-16 year olds also travel on the    
 bus, but this time to the High School 
 which serves the entire Berwick area. 
   Those planning on sitting Advanced  
 level exams stay at the High school   
 until 18.                             
   A small amount of further education 
 facilities are in the annexe at the   
 High school, but most full-time       
 students move to the cities to live   
 and attend Universities or Polytec's  
 in order to take a 4 year degree.     </content>
