		<title>12Why we live here</title>
		<content> Our school did a survey to ask        
 everybody how long they had lived in  
 this area.These are the answers we    
 received.26% of people had lived here 
 all their lives;38% for under 5 years 
 ;18% for under 10 years;7% for under  
 20 years and 13% for over 20 years.As 
 you see most people have lived here   
 under 5 years.30% of the people live  
 in this area as their work is here;20%
 chose to live here as this is where   
 they work and it's in the country;20% 
 as it's just in the country;26% have  
 always lived here.The remaining 10% of
 the population live here for other    
 reasons that we don't know.We children
 like living here as we have the       
 freedom to wander round where we want 
 and also in the country there aren't  
 any busy roads.Drawbacks of living in 
 the country are that we have to travel
 for playparks or entertainment.       </content>
