		<title>10WORKING MOTHERS-TEANASSIE</title>
		<content> Most mothers work locally as they     
 often have small children to look     
 after and even if they don't have     
 small children they probably wouldn't 
 be able to work far away because many 
 of the mothers can't drive.If the     
 father worked far away and the mother 
 worked in a different place then two  
 cars would be needed and that would   
 cost so much that it would not        
 be worthwhile working.                
 All the school children in Teanassie  
 School travel to school by school     
 transport as the distances are so     
 great and the roads narrow and        
 winding.                              
 Parents help by transporting          
 pupils to swimming lessons,sporting   
 events with other school and on visits
 to the theatre in Inverness.
