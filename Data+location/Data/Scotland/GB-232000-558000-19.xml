 owned the {Nursery}in the middle of   
 the village .On {2 acres}he produces {
{vegetables}and{flowers}for planting in
 gardens in spring.In large greenhouses
 he grows {tomatoes}and flowers for    
 planting out .He buys seeds from      
 various firms,sows them in greenhouses
 and when they are still quite small he
 sets them outside to get used to the  
 cold before people buy them for their 
 gardens.Some of the flowers produced  
 are made into {wreaths}for            
 funerals.Others are made into {       
{bouquets}.At Christmas he makes       
 wreaths out of holly which he obtains 
 at Mochrum Park.The Nursery is open { 
{seven days}a week.
