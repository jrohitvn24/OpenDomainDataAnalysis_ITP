		<content> SUPERSTITIONS                         
 Superstitions are found among         
 sea-going folk all over the world and 
 Eyemouth fishermen are no exception.  
 They will not mention the names of    
 certain creatures because to do so    
 will bring bad luck, so a salmon is   
 referred to as a "rid-yin", a pig as a
 "grumpy", a rabbit as a "bunny" etc.  
 Some fishermen won't begin work on    
 Friday nor will they go to sea if they
 meet anyone connected with the        
 ministry or a lame person when on     
 their way to the boat.  If a fisherman
 or his family runs out of bread on a  
 Sunday they will not borrow.  They    
 won't pay debts on a Sunday either.
