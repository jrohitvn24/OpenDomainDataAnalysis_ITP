		<title>16Colvend: Population</title>
		<content>   The population of Colvend and       
 Rockcliffe has steadily decreased in  
 the last century.                     
   In 1900 there were over 60 children 
 in the school.Today there are 10! One 
 reason for this was that people had   
 bigger families. Another reason was   
 that in those days there were not many
 farm machines, so farm work had to be 
 done by hand and needed more people.  
 Today the tractor has replaced the    
 horse and the combine harvester has   
 replaced the sickle.                  
   Farm workers have always stayed in  
 houses owned by the farm. Some old    
 houses have been demolished,some have 
 been modernised and are occupied while
 some are let as holiday houses.       
   Many people who live here are old or
 retired, but some younger people are  
 now coming here to live because they  
 work in the tourist industry.         </content>
