		<title>15THE WORK OF THE LOCAL POLICE</title>
		<content> We interviewed a local policeman      
 whose base is Newmills Police Station.
{This station covers the area from     
{Kincardine Bridge to Limekilns. There 
{are three men at Kincardine, one at   
{Culross, one at Charlestown and at    
{Newmills including the Sergeant there 
{are five men.}He normally             
 works an eight hour shift although he 
 can be called upon to work extra      
 hours. He describes the area in which 
 he works as a{cross-section of the    
{community.}Most people in Valleyfield}
 are{miners.}In Crombie most work in   
 the{Ammunition Depot}and in Limekilns}
 and Chrlestown people mainly work in  
{offices and factories.}The crime rate 
 in the area is average and the        
 detection rate is 50%.Policemen in a  
 country station have to do all their  
 own paperwork. He enjoys              
 working in this area very much.       </content>
