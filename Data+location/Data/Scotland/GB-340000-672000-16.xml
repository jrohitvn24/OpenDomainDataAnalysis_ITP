		<content>{QUEEN FOR A DAY}- The gala started in 
 1934.It is a ceremony where a 'Queen' 
 is ceremoniously crowned.Her Consort  
 and court like her are chosen from    
 local schools.In earlier years places 
 were decided by merit,now names are   
 drawn from a hat.Local bands joined   
 the parade and school children used to
 march through the streets.The gala    
 was the main event of the year for    
 many children.Nowadays the gala       
 heralds the beginning of a civic week.
{CARTER LAD AND LASS -}The Carter Lad  
 and Lass are elected from young people
 over 18 and of 'good character'The    
 ceremony takes the form of a ride-out 
 round the original borders of TRANENT 
 parish followed by a 'kirking' at the 
 old Parish Church.The ceremony dates  
 back 200yrs.They also represent       
 TRANENT at all the BORDER rides and at
 the Musselburgh Honest Lad &amp; Lass ride</content>
