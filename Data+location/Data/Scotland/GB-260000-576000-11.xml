		<title>11Ecology in New Galloway area</title>
		<content> More and more of New Galloway and     
 district is becoming a conservation   
 area. This is a situation of which the
 villagers approve. There is a bird    
 sanctuary by Loch Ken.                
   The climate is rather warm and wet  
 compared to Scotland as a whole.      
 Because of the effect this has on the 
 soils, the land is ideal for grass    
 growing (i.e.for livestock rearing and
 sheep grazing) and afforestation.     
  There are various footpaths, giving  
 panoramic views, at the golf course,  
 the Brough, McQueen's path and, of    
 course, the recently formed Southern  
 Upland Way which runs through the     
 hills surrounding New Galloway. There 
 is little pollution. Cars are mainly  
 used to get out of New Galloway to the
 town.There is the fear of acid rain   
 having a permanent effect.30% in our  
 survey are,actively,trying to curb it.</content>
