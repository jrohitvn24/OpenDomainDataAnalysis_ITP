		<title>13Trade in Strathmiglo</title>
		<content> The one business street in Strathmiglo
 is the High Street.There is a bank,a  
 post office,three hotels,one garage,a 
 hairdresser and six shops.Five of     
 these are food shops and one is a shoe
 shop.                                 
 The shoe shop is A.T.HOGG(FIFE)Ltd.The
 business was first established in     
 1888,when the original Mr.Hogg sold   
 boots and shoes by mail order,buying  
 in all boots and shoes he advertised  
 and sold.He then turned to the        
 manufacturing side and equipped a     
 factory at Strathmiglo.He opened shops
 in many nearby towns.                 
 Nowadays,boots and shoes are no longer
 manufactured in Strathmiglo,but boots 
 and shoes can still be purchased by   
 mail order from Scotland's oldest     
 established mail order company or from
 shops in many parts of the country.
