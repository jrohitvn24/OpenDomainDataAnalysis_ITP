		<content> This year 1985 we are celebrating     
{Vincenzo Lunardi's Bicentenary.       
 Lunardi was an{Italian Hydrogen       
{Balloonist who}landed his red and blue
 striped balloon in a field{south-east 
{of Ceres in 1785.}To celebrate his    
 landing there will be a Hot Air       
 Extravaganza on top of Tarvit Hill    
 which shall include{Microlights, Gypsy
{Moths, Helicopters and a parachute    
{display.Our}class P.6B at Castlehill  
 School,Cupar studied Lunardi and our  
 project won a certificate in a maths  
{competition.There is a street at the  
{end of St.Michaels Drive in Cupar     
{called "Lunardi's Place" which was    
{named after our visitor.}In October a 
 plaque is being unveiled in the field 
 were Lunardi landed his balloon.I hope
 the celebrations of Lunardi's landing 
 are a success after all our efforts to
 bring him back.                       </content>
