		<content> All ages appreciate village life, the 
 quietness, the friendliness, the close
 intimacy and involvement in community 
 activities, the adsence of vandalism, 
 the beautiful scenery and the         
 pollution free air. Many regret the   
 run down of services, the high cost of
 private transport and the infrequency 
 and cost of public transport. With    
 long established trades local         
 tradesmen, like Adams the joiner, R&amp;W 
 Young the livestock transporters,     
 Butler the Slaterer, and public and   
 private services providing employment 
 for one sixth of an adult population  
 of nearly 500. Part time employment,  
 mainly for women provides additional  
 family income and is part of our way  
 of life. Over 50 people commute daily 
 to Kelso and a further 40 travel      
 further afield. 20% of the population 
 are retired. 9 adults are unemployed. </content>
