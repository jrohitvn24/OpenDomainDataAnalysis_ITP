		<title>06The Deeside Railway Line</title>
		<content> The old Deeside Railway line is       
 situated to the South of Cults.It ran 
 only as far as Ballater because when  
 it was built Queen Victoria didn't    
 want it running past Ballmoral Castle.
 The journey to Ballater was a very    
 scenic route,and was popular with     
 tourists but in the 1960's the whole  
 track was lifted,and the line closed. 
 It has not been completely put to     
 waste now because people use it to    
 have an easy stroll,jog,walk or a     
 leisurly cycle.It passes many fields  
 and also runs very near the River Dee 
 at times.When it was closed down the  
 old stations were sold.Some people    
 redecorated them and stayed in them   
 but others were just kept as store    
 houses.                               
 Some of it is getting over grown and  
 the line will probably get shorter in 
 time.                                 </content>
