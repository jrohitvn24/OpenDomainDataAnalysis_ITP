  The only local church is the Church  
 of Scotland and most of the population
 belongs to that church.               
  The church building is very beautiful
 inside and pleasant from the outside  
 and is a listed building.             
  Attached to the church are the Sunday
 School,Young Folks Group,Ladies Assoc-
 iation,Women's Guild and Bible Study  
 Group.                                
  In the local Mission  Hall the Evan- 
 gelical Church meets on Sunday evening
 and there is a meeting for children on
 Sunday afternoons.                    
  People who do not go to the local    
 church go to the Episcopal Church in  
 Largs or the Catholic Chapel near     
 Wemyss Bay or do not go to church at  
 all.There are very few people of      
 other faiths in the area.
