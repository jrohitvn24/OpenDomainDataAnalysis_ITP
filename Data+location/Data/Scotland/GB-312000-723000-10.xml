		<title>10Salmon fishing on the Tay</title>
		<content> If you own one of the residents'season
 permits or one of the day permits     
 issued to visitors then you are       
 permitted to fish trout or salmon on  
 the Tay street side of the river from 
 the 21st of January to the 21st of    
 October.A day's fishing costs Â£8.00   
 while a season ticket only costs      
 Â£5.00. With a permit you are entitled 
 to fish for Salmon or Trout.You are   
 prohibited from fishing on a          
 Sunday,after sundown,or from the      
 bridges.A major problem say the       
 fishermen is pollution coming into the
 Tay from burns bringing insecticides  
 from the fields.Autumn is the best    
 time for Salmon fishing on the tay.The
 biggest fish caught recently on this  
 stretch was 32lb in October of 1984.
