		<title>17POLICE IN EYEMOUTH</title>
		<content> A{sergeant and five constables take   
 part in a 24 hr.rota system covering  
 the area which includes Eyemouth.At   
 present there are no women members of 
 the Eastern Berwickshire Force.The    
 police have a"Marina",two"Chevette"   
 panda cars and one "Ford              
 Granada"patrol car at their disposal. 
 The police can be contacted from      
 9 a.m.-5 p.m.at the Eyemouth          
 station.Outside these hours the phone 
 is connected to Regional Headquarters 
 at Hawick.The most common crimes which
 the police have to deal with are theft
 and vandalism.The number of police on 
 duty remains the same throughout the  
 year in spite of the fact that the    
 population increases by as much as 2  
 1/2 thousand in the tourist           
 season.However the system is flexible.
 Men and vehicles can be drafted in    
 from other areas if needed.           </content>
