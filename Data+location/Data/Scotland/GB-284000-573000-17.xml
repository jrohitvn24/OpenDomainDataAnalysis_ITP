		<title>17THE MISSION HALL IN SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>   The Mission Hall was built in 1846  
 for the Free Church of Scotland. In   
 1929 the Free Church of Scotland and  
 the Church of Scotland joined. Now the
 hall is used by the Church of         
 Scotland.                             
                                       
   The Mission Hall is for people in   
 the village who have a long way to go 
 to church, since the parish church is 
 5 miles away. There are about 25      
 people in the congregation. The       
 services are on the second and third  
 Sundays every month. Communion is     
 twice a year in Spring and Autumn.    
                                       
   There is an open fire in the hall   
 which is still used. The hall used to 
 be lit by paraffin lamps and the hooks
 are still there. Part of the pulpit   
 built in 1870 for the parish church   
 was transferred to the hall in 1960.  </content>
