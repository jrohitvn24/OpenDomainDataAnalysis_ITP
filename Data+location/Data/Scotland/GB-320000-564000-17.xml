		<content> I get up at 7.30am.Ihave a shower,get 
 dressed and go downstairs for my      
 breakfast.                            
 I have a meeting at the surgery at    
 8.30am to discuss patients. I start   
 seeing patients from 9am to 11.00am,  
 then I open all the mail and read     
 it,before going out for calls till    
 lunchtime.If I'm on call I carry      
 my bleeper so that if there is an     
 urgent call the receptionist can      
 contact me.                           
 After lunch I have a surgery from     
 2.00pm till 3.30pm,perhaps some more  
 calls then a surgery from 4.00pm till 
 6.00pm.At about 7.00pmIcome home and  
 have my tea.I'm on call every three or
 four days.If anybody needs me before  
 9.00am I have to go and see them at   
 their house.                          
 If I'm not on call I often go out to  
 play golf or work in the garden.      </content>
