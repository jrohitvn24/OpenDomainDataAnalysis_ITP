		<title>04Changing Times in Irvine.</title>
		<content>   We went into the shopping mall to   
 ask people what they felt about the   
 changes which had taken place in      
{Irvine}recently. Some of the people   
 like the new town more than the old   
 town. Some said there was no          
 difference.{The new town}is cleaner   
 and much nicer. It is easier with the 
 shops all together and under cover.   
{The old town}had more character. It   
 wasn't busy and was easy to go        
 through.Some people missed the        
 picturesque bridge which used to span 
 the river where the mall now is. The  
 people who missed the old town missed 
 the country-side around, which had    
 been used for building, they missed   
 the bridge, the quietness, the old    
 streets and the friendships. Everyone 
 said they would like to see{more jobs 
 available.                            
                                       </content>
