		<content>      Cairnpapple has a dome built over
 it with steps on one side leading up  
 to an open hole at the top, leading   
 into a burial chamber.                
     There are many large stones in and
 around Cairnpapple.   There are very  
 large graves as well, about 3 metres  
 by 1.5 metres.                        
      Cairnpapple is very high up,     
 nearly as high as The Knock, which is 
 the highest point in West Lothian.    
      Most of the excavational work was
 done by Stuart Piggot.   It gives you 
 a creepy feeling going down into the  
 grave and looking at where a body     
 supposedly lies, under the ground.    
 There are many strange stories as you 
 can see, some of them could keep you  
 up all night!
