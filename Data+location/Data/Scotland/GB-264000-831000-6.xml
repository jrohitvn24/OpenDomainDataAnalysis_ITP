  The sparrow hawk nests fairly high of
 the ground in trees but has been known
 to nest in low bushes.The female lays 
 4-6 eggs which  she sits on for five  
 weeks. The nest is built several      
 months before the eggs are laid.The   
 male brings food to the nest which    
 is fed to the chicks or eaten by the  
 adults themselves.                    
  Sparrow hawks have been seen near the
 Garbole road.                {
