  In 1945 there were about 30 houses in
  Dyke.Water was pumped daily to three 
 wells and the school from a reservoir 
 by means of a windpump.There was no   
 electricity.In the school were three  
 classes,each with about 20 pupils ages
 ranged from 5-14.                     
 Dances,concerts,clubs took place in   
 the village hall.Quoits and tennis    
 were played outside.There was one     
 general store andbaker and butcher    
 vans visited regularly.Ablacksmith and
 a joiner worked at the bottom end of  
 the village but there was no pub.there
 was a private bus but very few        
 cars.The school supplied bicycles on  
 loan to those pupils who lived more   
 than two and a half miles away.One man
 still drove in a horse and a cart to  
 church.
