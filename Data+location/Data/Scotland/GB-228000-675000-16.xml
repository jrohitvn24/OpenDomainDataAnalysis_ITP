		<title>16EMPLOYMENT-UNEMPLOYMENT.</title>
		<content> Over recent years the rate of         
 unemployment has steadily increased   
 due to trade depression.  Greenock was
 once a hive of industry with its sugar
 factories, textile mills and          
 shipbuilding yards.  Most of these    
 have gone. Many adults and school     
 leavers are out of work.  In the East 
 End the situation is worst due to the 
 dependence there on shipbuilding.     
 Labour relations in Greenock have     
 become increasingly strained with     
 strikes at Scott Lithgow due to       
 threatened redundancies and a "sit-in"
 at Lee's Jeans Factory due to a       
 threatened closure. There is a feeling
 of mistrust between the management and
 workers at Scott Lithgow fuelled by   
 the takeover by Trafalgar house and   
 the fear of redundancies.  It will be 
 many years before this bridge between 
 workers and employers is closed.      </content>
