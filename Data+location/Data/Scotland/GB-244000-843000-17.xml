		<title>17PLAYGROUND GAMES-TEANASSIE</title>
		<content> One of the games we play in the school
 playground is Underarm Tig.In Underarm
 Tig, if you get caught you must hold  
 out your arm till you get freed.Other 
 games we play are chasing, "Kick the  
 Can" and" Hide and Seek".On our pitch 
 we play rugby,football,"Dodge The     
 Ball"and we practice shinty skills.We 
 make obstacle courses.We get          
 wood,tyres and any other things we    
 can find.We lay out the things and run
 round,through and over them.To        
 play"Kick The Can"you use             
 a carton and the person who is "it"   
 counts to 500 and comes to look for   
 you but he must watch the carton.He   
 needs to watch the carton because     
 someone who is not"it"could kick the  
 carton and all the people who are     
 caught would be free.Then the person  
 would have to count again.
