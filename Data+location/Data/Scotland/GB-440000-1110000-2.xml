		<content>{Sea}but lately there has been a       
 decline. Tourism now plays a large    
 part in our area's economy.           
  Although {Shetland}is very isolated  
 with few towns and villages it is as  
 modern as elsewhere. When oil was     
 discovered in the{North Sea}many men  
 came to work here and on the rigs.    
 They improved the airport and built   
 many houses. The influence of new     
 people was both good and bad for the  
 area. The main shops are in {Lerwick} 
 which is 25 miles away but we do have 
 mobile services, 3 bank, library and  
 grocery vans.                         
  To go to church people have to travel
 north,but there is a Sunday School    
 locally in the{Memorial Hall.}There   
 are no schools in our area,primary    
 children travel 6km and secondary     
 18km. However traditional life        
 continues.                            </content>
