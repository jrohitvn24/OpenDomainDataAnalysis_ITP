		<content> Ages range from babies to             
 octogenarians. Children attend a local
 primary school on the perimeter of the
 area. Secondary pupils travel to      
 Kilmarnock six miles distant.         
 University students mainly go to      
 Glasgow. The main employment is on    
 farms or estate or to town factories, 
 shops and nursing. Life is truly rural
 and idyllic for those who appreciate  
 the beauty of the area; soul          
 destroying if the bright city lights  
 beckon. There is no school, no church 
 or social centre within the area.     
 Villages are four miles distant, viz; 
 Mauchline Galston, Hurlford, Tarbolton
 and Craigie. Inns, churches, shops and
 social centres are located here. There
 is no bus service, the nearest is two 
 miles away. The majority of residents 
 have cars.
