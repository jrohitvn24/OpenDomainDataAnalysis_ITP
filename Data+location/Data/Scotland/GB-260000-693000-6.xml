		<content> In addition to its teaching staff the 
 school has an excellent cook, a       
 kitchen assistant, a school helper and
 a cleaner. Most of the children have  
 lunch at school and are given a small 
 bottle of milk in mid morning.        
 The school has a netball team and a   
 five_a_side football team and these   
 compete against teams from other small
 schools in the district. The annual   
 sports day is shared with Port of     
 Mentieth School. Similarly, the pupils
 join with children from many other    
 schools in festivals of Scottish      
 country dancing, modern dancing and   
 recorder playing. The older children  
 also travel to Stirling for swimming  
 lessons. Despite the small size of the
 school, therefore, the pupils enjoy a 
 good breadth of experience and        
 typically do well when they go on to  
 high school.                          </content>
