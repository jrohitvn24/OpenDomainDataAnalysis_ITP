 There were only four council houses   
 built in 1950-57 until 1983-84 when   
 another two were built across the road
 from the previous ones in Kirkbank    
 Road. Very recently they have started 
 to build a  play area.                
    There used to be a local policeman 
 in the village. He used to go about on
 a bicycle and knew everyone. In later 
 years he had a van. Ten or twelve     
 years ago he was transferred to Moffat
 and the village "bobby" no longer     
 existed. Police from Lockerbie and    
 Moffat patrol the A74 day and night   
 and are easily contacted if needed.
