		<content> On the flat valley floor of the Howe  
 of Fife there is sometimes too much   
 water. Rossie Loch, which once covered
 a large part of the area, was drained 
 in 1723. In 1805/1806 a more succesful
 attempt at draining the land was      
 acheived by cutting ditches to the    
 River Eden. The newly drained land was
 used as summer grazing meadows. The   
 land dried out and became ideal for   
 arable farming, although some areas   
 require a lot of draining and have    
 been left as pasture land. Recently a 
 Govt. grant was obtained to install   
 new drains. An artesian basin lies    
 underneath this area and has been     
 exploited by local farmers. Boreholes 
 have been drilled and water           
 successfully tapped. This has been a  
 great asset but the basin ends close  
 to the foot of the hill, where there  
 is a fault line.                      </content>
