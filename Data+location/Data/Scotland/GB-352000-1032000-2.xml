		<title>02TRADITIONAL PEAT CUTTING</title>
		<content>    To cut peat in the traditional     
 manner is a long back-breaking        
 process. First you must find a        
 suitable peat bank. After that you    
 must flay it, flaying is taking the   
 heather off the top of the peat. You  
 can then cut the peats either with a  
 spade or a tusker. A tusker is a blade
 with a handle and a small piece of    
 wood for your foot. The peat should be
 roughly rectagonal and about 5cms.    
 wide, 22cms. high and 12cms. broad.   
    Two people usually work together   
 cutting peats, one to cut the other to
 take the cut peats and build them into
 a shore which is like a wall with     
 holes in it to allow the peat to dry. 
    After about three or four weeks the
 peat must be turned to allow the other
 side to dry. Then after another three 
 or four weeks they can be taken down  
 from the hill and used over the winter</content>
