		<content> The area,like most of Scotland is     
 chiefly served by the Church of       
 Scotland and the Roman Catholic       
 Church.Both Addiewell and Stoneyburn  
 have a Presbyterian and Roman Catholic
 church.Stoneyburn also has an         
 Evangelical church.Breich has one     
 church,used by The Church of Scotland,
 in the village.                       
     Both Roman Catholic churches were 
 built in the early part of the        
 Twentieth Century while the           
 Presbyterian churches were established
 in the area a little earlier.In fact  
 Addiewell Parish Church celebrated its
 centenary in 1985.
