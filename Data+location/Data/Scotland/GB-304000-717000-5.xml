		<content> The playgroup is held at the Village  
 hall on Tuesdays from 9.30a.m.-11a.m. 
 Children come from Ardargie,          
 Forgandenny and Aberdalgie.The        
 children are aged 3-5 years.          
 The children play mainly with water,  
 sand and paint.The leaders teach them 
 how to climb and the children also    
 sing songs. The children are often    
 read stories too.                     
 The children pay 60p each week which  
 is not a very expensive fee.          
 The playgroup leaders hold a few fund 
 raising activities such as "Jumble    
 Sales" and "Coffee Mornings". The     
 money they raise goes towards outings 
 and the playgroup itself which needs  
 items such as paint, sand, containers,
 books and toys.                       
 The children are aged between 3 and 5 
 years of age.
