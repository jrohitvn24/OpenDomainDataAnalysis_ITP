		<title>14Recent events on Papa Stour.</title>
		<content> The most tragic event of recent years 
 was the sinking of the Papa Stour     
 mailboat in October 1981.The{Venture} 
 sank with the loss of one life during 
 a North Easterly gale.The{Venture}used
 to go back and forth between Papa and 
 Sandness through the Papa Sound,      
 bringing provisions for the shop,     
 as well as the mail.                  
   Now a 34 feet long fishing boat     
 chartered by the Shetland Islands     
 Council runs a greater distance from  
 Burra-firth across ST Magnus Bay.     
 The{Ivy Leaf}is mainland based,and the
 pier there has been greatly improved. 
   Four years previously an Aberdeen   
 based trawler the{Eleanor Viking}ran  
 aground on the notorious Ve Skerries  
 3 miles North West of Papa Stour .    
 Since then an automatic light house   
 has been installed on the skerries,as 
 a warning to shipping.                </content>
