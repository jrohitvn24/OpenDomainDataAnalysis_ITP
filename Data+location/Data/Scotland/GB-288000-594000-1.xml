		<title>0112 SQ.KM around Thornhill.</title>
		<content> The area we are writing about is the  
 3km.stretch around Thornhill          
 which stretches 4km.West.It is mostly 
 a country area with several dairy and 
 hill farms.There are also a few woods 
 ,lochs and rivers.In Thornhill there  
 is a road called Station Road.It is   
 called that because the station is at 
 the end of it.The station is not in   
 use  any more because not many people 
 stopped in Thornhill.Next to the      
 station is Thornhill market which is  
 still in use today.If we move further 
 North we come to Morton Old Church    
 which is now a ruin and has very old  
 gravestones about it,one of which is  
 said to be a pirate's.If we move South
 East we come to Gatelawbridge which is
 a tiny little hamlet.There are several
 quarries around Gatelawbridge.To the  
 East of the village lie the Morton    
 Hills.                                </content>
