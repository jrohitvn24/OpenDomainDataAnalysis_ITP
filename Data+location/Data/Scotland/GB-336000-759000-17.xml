		<content> Standing by the roadside in{Glen      
{Prosen,}is the{Scott Memorial         
{Cairn,}which was erected in 1981 on   
 the site of the original memorial-a   
 fountain-which was accidentally       
 destroyed by a car in 1979.The money  
 was provided by the local Community   
 Assocn. and Angus District Council.   
 It marks the spot where{Captain Scott 
 and{Dr.Edward Wilson}used to stand and
 admire the beautiful view.At the foot 
 of the  glen is{Burnside Bungalow}    
 where Scott stayed with Wilson while  
 they planned their expedition to the  
{South Pole,}from which they never     
 returned.                             
 An inscription reads-"Given into the  
 care of the people of{Cortachy }for   
 them to hold in remembrance.          
{Robert Falcon Scott}and{Edward Wilson}
 who knew this Glen.They reached the   
{South Pole}on{17th January,1912}----" </content>
