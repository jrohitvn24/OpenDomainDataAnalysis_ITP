		<title>13FORESTRY PRACTICE IN FERNESS</title>
		<content>    Forestry land is usually unsuitable
 for farming, but must have good soil  
 and not be too high or exposed. Seeds 
 are sown in nurseries (nearest at     
 Elgin) and planted on hillside at     
 approximately two years old.          
    Trees planted include Scots Pine,  
 Lodgepole Pine, Sitka and Norway      
 spruce. Nowadays, some birch,rowan &amp;  
 alder are also planted. In addition,  
 the Douglas fir is a particularly fast
 -growing tree. The wood becomes more  
 valuable as the tree ages.            
 Generally,the poorer trees are felled 
 to allow the better ones to grow on to
 maturity.                             
    Plantations are usually fenced for 
 protection against animals which can  
 damage the trees - especially         
 deer,rabbits and hares.
