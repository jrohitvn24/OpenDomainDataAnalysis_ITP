		<content> Alness is on the A9 trunk road,the    
 main road to the north of Scotland.The
 Inverness_Wick railway line also      
 passes through the town so it is well 
 linked with other areas.There are 4   
 passengers trains going north and 4   
 going south everyday except Sunday.On 
 Sunday there is one train in each     
 direction.Alness is well served by the
 public bus services.Highland Omnibuses
 run a total of 14 buses each weekday  
 northwards to Tain and the same number
 south to Inverness.On a Sunday there  
 are only 3 in each direction,with no  
 buses on Sunday morning.The main      
 road,the A9 passes through the centre 
 of the town.This causes congestion at 
 times,especially at the narrow bridge 
 over the River Averon.To ease this    
 congestion a by_pass is planned with  
 work due to start this year (1985).
