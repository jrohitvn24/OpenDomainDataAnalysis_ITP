		<title>13Wildlife in Bourtie/Keithall</title>
		<content> Game shoots are still the prerogative 
 of the lairds of the two estates which
 occuply considerable acreage in the   
 parishes of Bourtie and               
 Keithhall/Kinkell.  There is no grouse
 to speak of, but partridge and        
 pheasant are killed in organized      
 shoots in the winter months on both   
 estates.  Gamekeepers are employed to 
 raise birds from eggs and then let    
 them loose in summer to grow on in    
 wild conditions before the annual     
 slaughter.  However such hand-rearing 
 encourages other wildlife and 36 foxes
 are snared or shot in 12 months prior 
 to the summer of 1984 on one estate.  
 There are pockets of deciduous        
 woodland and private land owned by    
 thoher who safeguard any roaming      
 animal which strays from the estates.
