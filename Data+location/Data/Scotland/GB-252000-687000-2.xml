		<title>02LOCAL HISTORY OF BALFRON</title>
		<content>    Balfron increased in population    
 during the time of the Industrial     
 Revolution, when the water-powered    
{cotton mill}was built near the River  
 Endrick. Many{streets}owe their names 
 to the industry- Cotton Street,       
 Weavers Winnell, Spinners Street,     
 Spokers Loan and Printers Row. The two
 mill owners{Buchanan and Dunmore}have 
 the two longest streets named after   
 them. Many of the houses in the older 
 parts of the village have very        
 distinctive long narrow gardens. This 
 was to allow the cotton to be laid out
 for bleaching. With the introduction  
 of steam power, the mill was closed   
 and the building was used latterly for
 shirt-making early in the twentieth   
 century.                              
   {Navvies}stayed in the area when the
 water pipeline was dug from Loch      
 Katrine to Glasgow.                   </content>
