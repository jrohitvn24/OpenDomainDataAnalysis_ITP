		<content> It was 8'0  clock and the alarm awoke 
 the sleepy 10 year old. Throwing aside
 his continental quilt he hurried to   
 the bathroom to wash and changed into 
 his school uniform. Breakfast of rice 
 krispies,tea toast was already on the 
 kitchen table. After grabbing his     
 Rucanor schoolbag he dashed down the  
 street to meet his pals at the traffic
 lights. They entered the yard as the  
 school bell rang.The morning of maths 
 and English flew in and the lunch bell
 rang at half past twelve. Now home for
 a snack of beans on toast, glass of   
 lemonade and a chocolate biscuit and  
 then its back to school till half past
 three.His evening's entertainment is  
 made up of television viewing,        
 cruising around on his B.M.X bike and 
 playing five-a-side football. Then its
 off to bed before 10 pm.
