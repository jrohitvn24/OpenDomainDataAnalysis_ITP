		<title>16Technology in Bourtie</title>
		<content> One of the side-effects of being a    
 country area within 20 miles of       
 Aberdeen has been the injection of    
 technology associated with North Sea  
 Oil.  Bourtie is essentially          
 greenbelt, with strict regulations    
 governing housing or other deelopment,
 unless it replaces an existing        
 derelict building.  Within the last   
 few years there have been a number of 
 requests to Gordon district Planning  
 Department of housing in Bourtie and  
 only three hae been granted.  One     
 included building a helipad outside a 
 private dwelling at Woodside of       
 Thornton, Pitgaveny.  Local resients  
 objected when permission was granted  
 to a pilot, employed to Dyce airport  
 for thi construction.  Two years      
 later, the man, with mobility         
 associated with his job, sold his     
 house and the permission was rescinded</content>
