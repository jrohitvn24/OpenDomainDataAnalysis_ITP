		<content> My name is Sarah Loughlin and I live  
 at 'Benbain', Dalmellington.  Our     
 house is about 5 kilometres from the  
 school and nearly one kilometre from  
 the road.  We live on the side of     
 Benbeoch 330 metres above sea level.  
                                       
 Our house was built at least 200 years
 ago of large blocks of whinstone and  
 sandstone making the walls about one  
 metre thick. The cottage has been     
 extended and it is now quite a big    
 house with five bedrooms.  Originally 
 it was built as a croft or small      
 farmhouse.  It was rectangular in     
 shape with a bedroom, dairy or        
 storeroom, living room/kitchen and a  
 byre (cowhouse) all under one roof.
