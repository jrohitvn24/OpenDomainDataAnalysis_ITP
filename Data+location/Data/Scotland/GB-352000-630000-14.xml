		<title>14BOWDEN VILLAGE (cont.)</title>
		<content>  There was a school in Bowden but this
 closed in the early 1940's because of 
 a falling roll.Today, the younger     
 children attend primary schools in    
 Newtown and Melrose while secondary   
 children go to Earlston High School.  
 There is no village policeman the     
 nearest police station being at St.   
 Boswells which is about 2 miles away. 
  A millionaire left a lot of money to 
 Bowden to provide street lighting     
 and Bowden was the first place in the 
 Borders to have electric street       
 lighting.This money lasted for many   
 years so the villagers didn't have to 
 pay any rates towards street lighting.
 But in the last few decades,because   
 street lights have got more powerful  
 and more expensive the money has run  
 out.Most people enjoy living in Bowden
 and are against any major changes.
