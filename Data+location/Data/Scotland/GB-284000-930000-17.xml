		<title>17Grouse Shooting &amp; Stalking</title>
		<content> On the 12th of August the grouse      
 shooting starts. The landowners,      
 guests and gamekeepers assemble with  
 their dogs,guns and C.B. radios and   
 set off for the hill on an eight      
 wheeled machine called an Argo. This  
 takes them to a known spot where      
 grouse are often seen. The stalkers   
 with their dogs flush out the grouse  
 from their hiding places. After the   
 grouse shooting the stalking of the   
 red deer begins and people again climb
 into their Argos.It is less sporting  
 than it used to be. Formerly they had 
 to walk for miles in the hills with   
 their ponies carrying the shot deer.  
 After the deer are brought back to the
 larder the gamekeepers skin the       
 bodies.Afterwards they are sold to a  
 game dealer. Most of the venison is   
 sent to the continent.
