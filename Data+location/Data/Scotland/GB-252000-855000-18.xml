		<content> The stretch of the River Conon in our 
 Domesday Area has been designated a   
 Site of Special Scientific Interest.  
 Throughout the year there is a wide   
 variety of ducks and waders in the    
 stretch of river.In the spring and    
 summer mergansers,mallard,shellduck   
 and teal nest on the banks aswell as  
 oyster catchers,lapwings,greenshank   
 and curlew.Herons are a common site   
 feeding in the shallow pools,as are   
 woodcock,snipe and dippers.There is a 
 huge variety of flowers growing all   
 along the river bank and the yellow   
 coneflower which blooms in late summer
 provides a spectacular scene of tall  
 vivid yellow flowers.Butterflies and  
 moths are also present in abundance.  
 Seals are a common site in the lower  
 reaches of the river as they pursue   
 the migrating sea trout and salmon as 
 they make there way up river.         </content>
