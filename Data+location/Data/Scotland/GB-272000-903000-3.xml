		<content>  I get up at 8.00a.m., dress in a     
 knee-length skirt, blouse and a jumper
 and go downstairs. I eat toast and    
 cornflakes for my breakfast and  drink
 a cup of tea.                         
  Once I've packed my books into my    
 school-bag, I walk about 90 metres to 
 get the school car, which comes at    
 9.10a.m.. The school is about 5 miles 
 from my house. School starts at       
 9.30a.m. and finishes at 3.30p.m.. The
 bus takes me home by 3.50p.m..        
  I play on my bike until 4.30p.m.,    
 when my father gets home. Then we have
 our tea. After tea, I do my homework. 
 Next, I wash the dishes or do anything
 my mother wishes.                     
  If it is dry, I go outside, but if it
 is wet, I play on my computer for the 
 rest of the evening.
