		<content> The landscape around{Kyleakin}is      
 mostly hills and sea .the hills are   
 quite boggy and are covered in        
 heather.                              
 The only historical ruins are the     
{Castle Moil}and the{War Memorial.}The 
 Castle Moil is on a small hill at the 
 edge of the sea .It is made of stone  
 and mortar and is very old.           
 Long long ago there used to be a chain
 from Kyleakin to Kyle,and every ship  
 that came used to have to pay before  
 they got passed.                      
 There is a lot of forestry in the     
 area.                                 
 Most of Kyleakin has got sea round it 
 because it used to be an island.      
 there is quite a strong current       
 because the channel is not very wide.
