		<title>06BROADBAY SOUTH - STEINISH</title>
		<content> The village of Steinish has           
 approximately 30 houses. The oldest   
 house was built in 1920. There are 14 
 crofts. Some are unused but most have 
 sheep and a few cows. Some croft land 
 is cultivated.                        
 The present population is             
 approximately 100. Employment is      
 mostly found in the Stornoway         
 area. There is one weaver operating a 
 Harris Tweed loom. The only real      
 business is a nursery which sells     
 flowers, plants and eggs. There are no
 shops in the village although a       
 grocery van comes round once a week.  
 The nearest shop is in Plasterfield   
 about 1km away.
