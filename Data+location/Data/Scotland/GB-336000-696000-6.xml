		<content>      Hyndhead is a school for severely
 mentally and physically handicapped   
 children.The West end of Denbeath     
 School was converted to make this     
 school in 1983.                       
      There are nineteen children and  
 ten staff including auxiliaries. Most 
 of the children arrive and leave by   
 bus but some travel by taxi. The      
 school day begins at 9.30 am and ends 
 at 3.00pm.The children start the      
 school at the age of two and a half   
 and leave when they are eighteen, but 
 sometimes there are exceptions made.  
      Hyndhead has many special        
 features,including a  heated swimming-
 pool,a housewifery flat,a gym equipped
 with specially adapted apparatus and  
 an outdoor adventure playground.      
      On our visits we found that the  
 children were always happy and        
 contented.                            </content>
