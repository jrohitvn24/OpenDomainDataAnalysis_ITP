		<title>01Durris Forest: NW Stonehaven</title>
		<content> The block is comprised mostly of the  
 FC plantation of Durris Forest on the 
 3 hills of Strathgyle (297m) Mundernal
 (315m) and the N slopes of Cairn-mon- 
 Earn (378m). These latter 2 hills have
 unafforested summits of heathland     
 although very young plantations (c.5  
 yrs) are found very high up on        
 Mundernal Durris Forest has maturing  
 trees (Pine, Larch and Sitka Spruce)  
 some small sections have already been 
 felled. Recreational usage of forest  
 tracks eg walking, cross-country      
 skiing, is increasing. The block also 
 includes lower farmland to the W and N
 (mostly blocks 1,2,4,5 &amp; 9). Small    
 streams issuing from these hills and  
 from others to the SW drain the farm- 
 land, the biggest being the Sheeoch   
 Burn which runs through squares 5,1 &amp; 
 2, thence to the river Dee. There are 
 scattered small farms in this strip.  </content>
