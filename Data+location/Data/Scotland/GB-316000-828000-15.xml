		<title>15GLENLIVET HOUSING AND HEALTH</title>
		<content>   Most of the {houses}in Glenlivet are
 centred round the  distillery which is
 the  main  employer in the area. There
 are  20 houses  there,  most  of which
 have been  built in the last 15 years.
 In the  village of Bridgend there  are
 only  5 fairly old  stone  houses. The
 other  houses  in  the  area  are farm
 houses,  private  detached  houses and
 old crofts  which  have been renovated
 and are now holiday cottages.         
   There is a {doctor }and  a{ district
{nurse}who  attend to the health of the
 people.  The   doctor  consults  every
 weekday and  does  a  lot  more  house
 calls than is  usual in town. He  also
 does  his  own  dispensing. The  nurse
 visits the  elderly  and bed-ridden as
 well as the under fives.              
   There  is  a  geriatric  hospital at
 Aberlour but the General and Maternity
 hospitals are at Elgin.               </content>
