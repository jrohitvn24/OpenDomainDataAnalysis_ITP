		<content> My name is Jillian Summerfield.I am 11
 years old.I have one brother called   
 Gary.We live in Glenrothes though we  
 have not lived there all our lives.The
 earliest thing I remember is going on 
 a plane in Prestwick Airport in       
 Glasgow to Brunei.I was 5 then.In     
 Brunei we went to infant school which 
 was primary 1 to 4.There was junior   
 school which was primary 5 to 7.You   
 went to Singapore for High School.I   
 did ballet and swam as well.Altogether
 we lived in Brunei for 18 months with 
 spells of leave in Britain            
 occasionally.We came back to Dundee   
 and I went back to my old school there
 and met my friends again.My Dad got a 
 new job so we had to move to          
 Glenrothes.I joined Pitteuchar West   
 Primary which is the school I attend  
 at the moment.
