 go for walks,go paddling in the River 
 Dee,go for day trips,go on a cycle    
 run and lots more exciting things.Our 
 family goes for walks with our dog a  
 lot.we go picnics and we go cycle runs
 as well.People go fishing in the River
 Dee for trout and salmon.In the       
 hall at Kirkton of Durris there is    
 indoor bowling and the W.R.I and Young
 Farmers Club meet there.Next to the   
 Kirkton Hall there is a rifle club.   
 Sometimes people have to travel to do

 Banchory to run in the Amateur        
 Athletics club.I go to Drumoak for the

 have to go to Aberdeen.Many people go 
 in to watch Aberdeen F.C.which is     
 a tremendous football team.           </content>
