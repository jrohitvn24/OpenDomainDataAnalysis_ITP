		<title>01Old Barony of Ruskie (North)</title>
		<content> This area has much changed since the  
 Earls of Meutieth and Sir John de     
 Meutieth of Rusky. After the feudal   
 system with Ox-towns,the Napiers      
 were the Lords (logarithm Napier is   
 said to have thought up the idea on   
 Loch Rusky!).  The great enclosure    
 period saw the Grahams enthusiastic   
 about improvements - simple tenancy   
 farms.  The decline in agriculture    
 since the 1960's has seen block       
 planting of conifers, extensive hill  
 farming, reduction in population in   
 farming. Deer farming and tourism is  
 important, but appearance has been    
 neglected. The Forestry Commission is 
 very inefficient and not good at      
 growing trees.  Private planting is   
 better. the loch is stocked with      
 rainbow trout.  There is talk of acid 
 rain, trees also bring acid problems.
