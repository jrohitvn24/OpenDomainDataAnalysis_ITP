		<content> Brown Hare                            
 Very common in the area. Lives in the 
 open fields. Shelters in a "form".    
 Eats almost any type of vegetation.   
 Mountain Hare                         
 Cousin of above - lives mainly on     
 higher ground but often seen foraging 
 in fields. Fur changes to white in    
 winter.                               
 Rabbits                               
 Very common resident. Usually found in
 areas of loose sandy soil.            
 Fox                                   
 Known in Scotland as the Tod. Larger  
 and heavier than the red fox of       
 England. Very common in the area but  
 rarely seen due to its nocturnal      
 habits. A predator which will take any
 kind of animal or bird it can find    
 including carrion.
