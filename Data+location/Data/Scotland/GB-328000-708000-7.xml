		<content> The village of{Kingskettle}may be     
 small but there is a great variety of 
 interesting people. Take{Artie and    
{Cilla Trezise}for example{who sing for
{their supper.}Cilla Fisher and Artie  
 Trezise{sing all over the world}to    
 entertain people. They have also      
{appeared on television and sung on    
{radio.}Artie and Cilla{produce records
 from their{own recording studio}in    
 their house,  the Old Post House of   
 Kingskettle. The first{Singing Kettle 
 was such{a great success}that they    
 decided to{produce another}called the 
{Singing Kettle 2. These records are a 
{collection of childrens rhymes and    
{playground songs which tell much of   
{our heritage}and Artie and Cilla think
 that they should be preserved. Besides
{they are such fun - "Nobody likes me, 
{everybody hates me, I think I'll go   
{and eat worms".                       </content>
