 The situation is at present           
 unsatisfactory and causes concern to  
 Small Isles parents who have children 
 in primary school. Some families      
 resolve the problem by moving to the  
 mainland as soon as the oldest child  
 reaches 11. This resolves the problem 
 for that family but is not good for   
 the stability of the island           
 populations. This is a problem that   
 causes social concern and needs to be 
 satisfactorily resolved.
