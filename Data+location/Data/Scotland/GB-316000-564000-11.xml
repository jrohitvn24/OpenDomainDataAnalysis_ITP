		<title>11Modern houses in Annan</title>
		<content>    In Annan there are lots of new     
 houses being built. A house with 3    
{bedrooms}would be enough for 5 people,
 and a house with 2{bedrooms}would hold
 2 to 4 people. Each house has a       
{living_room}and a{kitchen,}the kitchen
 usually containing a fridge, a cooker,
 a washing_machine, a sink, and some   
 built_in cupboards and drawers. All   
 houses have a{bathroom}which also     
 contains a{toilet,}and some have a    
 separate toilet as well.              
    Most new houses are of two storeys 
 and have a small front and back       
{garden.}They are built of{brick}with  
{wooden}window and door frames. Most   
 new houses built in Annan in 1985 have
 been built by Annandale and Eskdale   
{District Council}and are in the       
 Hallmeadow part of the town.
