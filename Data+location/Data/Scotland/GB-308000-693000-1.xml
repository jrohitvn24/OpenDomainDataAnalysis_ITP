		<content>  This area which lies 6km north east  
 of Dunfermline in central Fife is an  
 undulating region with several small  
 hills and ranges in height from 188m  
 to the east of Roscobie reservoir to  
 282m at Craigencrow. Several small    
 burns run eastwards through the       
 central area.                         
  An outcrop of columnar basalt is     
 found at Craigencrow Craigs. This was 
 quarried in the past but is now used  
 mainly as a dump.                     
 Most of the land is owned by the      
 forestry commission and recent        
 planting has taken place on the       
 Roscobie Muir. Farming, mainly hill   
 sheep and cattle is the second most   
 important economic activity. In the   
 north of the area lies Loch Glow- a   
 local authority reservoir.This is no  
 longer connected to the public supply 
 but is an important angling amenity.  </content>
