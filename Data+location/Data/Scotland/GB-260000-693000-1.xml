		<content> This block is situated in the upper   
 Forth Valley.The main industry is     
 farming.Running east/west is the      
 A811.The road passes through the small
 village of Arnprior which consists of 
 a school,a row of council houses,a    
 Post office/shop,some cottages,a      
 smiddy/filling station,a sawmill and a
 home farm.The village and most of the 
 surrounding farms form part of the    
 ancient estate of Garden which has    
 been husbanded by the Stirling family 
 for centuries.Garden extends to the   
 west.The lands on the south eastern   
 corner of the block formerly belonged 
 to the Gribloch estate which has      
 recently been broken up and sold.     
 Towards the northeast is located a    
 cemetary which also services the two  
 larger villages of Kippen and         
 Buchlyvie,two miles east and west     
 respectively of Arnprior.{            </content>
