		<title>14Yetholm Crop Production</title>
		<content> Crops grown in the area include wheat,
 barley peas, turnips, and the more    
 recent crop to the area oil seed rape 
 adding a bright yellow in summer to   
 the magnificent patchwork of fields.  
 Oats are grown on Yetholm Mains. The  
 Majority of crops grown are used for  
 feeding the livestock but some is sold
 on the open market. A market garden at
 Thirlestane is in the early stages of 
 development concentrating of soft     
 fruits and summer salad crops.        
 Polythene tunnels have been erected   
 and it is hoped to develop a 'Pick    
 Your Own' market garden. Conservation 
 is important to the farmers in the    
 locality. Hedges have been retained   
 and planted along with a small mixed  
 woodland areas. Farm records at       
 Yetholm Mains are now retained in the 
 micro-computer and much wider use of  
 modern technology.                    </content>
