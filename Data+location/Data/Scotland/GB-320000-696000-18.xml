		<title>18THE 'GOTH'</title>
		<content> One of the public houses in Kinglassie
 is run along rather unusual lines,    
 which are found in other former       
 mining villages in Fife. The          
{Kinglassie Public House Society}      
{Limited}or{'GOTH'}as it is locally    
 known was formed in 1922. The Society 
 built the Public House at a cost of   
 Â£2000 and the money was raised by an  
{issue of shares}costing Â£1 each.      
                                       
 People could buy up to{Â£200}worth of  
 shares and thus become a member of the
 society which entitled them to voting 
 powers in the running of the 'Goth'.  
                                       
 The{profits}from the pub should be    
 split as follows - 7.5% of profits is 
 distributed amongst the shareholders  
 and part of the remainder is used for 
 'purposes of public utility' in       
 Kinglassie and neighbourhood.         </content>
