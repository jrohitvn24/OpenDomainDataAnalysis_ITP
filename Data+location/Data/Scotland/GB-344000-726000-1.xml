		<content> Our block slopes from west to east.   
 Some parts are hilly and the rest is  
 flat. The highest point of our block  
 is about 350 feet above sea level. The
 lowest part is the beach.             
       In the north of the block is the
 town of{Tayport.}Most houses are very 
 old and it is a residential town      
 which faces north over the river Tay, 
 and was an important Ferry port before
 the Tay bridge was built. The         
 population is approx' 3240.           
       Our block has five farms,       
 Scotscraig, Morton, Shanwell,         
 Garpit and Kirkton barns.It has both  
 pasture and arable but mostly arable. 
 About half the block is fields.       
       Our block has a big forest      
 called Tentsmuir, which has a nature  
 reserve, and lochs for ducks and      
 wildfowl.
