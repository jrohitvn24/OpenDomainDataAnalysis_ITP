		<content> There is a great amount of wild plants
 etc and animals in Banchory- Devenick.
 Wherever you go you are likely to see 
 a{forest, wood or stretch of moorland 
 around you. Most of the moorland has  
 been cultivated by the farmers.       
{ Rabbits}are common but occasionally  
{hare, hedgehog or weasel}are seen.    
{ Deer}still follow their ancient paths
 irrespective of new roads, houses and 
 fences. The{fox}population is quite   
 high although rarely seen in day-time.
 Recently a fox killed a pet pea-cock. 
  The{birds}you are most likely to see 
 are{magpies and crows}but there are   
 many little hedgerow birds like{tits, 
{sparrows, blackbirds and finches.     
{ Herons}are down by the River Dee and 
 because the area is quite near the    
 sea, many{seagulls}flock here         
 especially when the farmers are       
 ploughing or seeding.                 </content>
