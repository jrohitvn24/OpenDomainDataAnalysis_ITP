		<content> Sanquhar is predominantly a Scottish  
 Presbyterian Community, and 3 Kirks   
 within the town's boundaries serve the
 needs of the parishioners. Families   
 wishing to worship in an Episcopalian 
 Church must travel 26 miles to        
 Dumfries for weekly worship, although 
 services are sometimes held in a small
 Episcopalian church 20 miles west of  
 town. The nearest Roman Catholic      
 chapel is 4 miles NW of town and 10   
 Sanquhar families regularly worship   
 there. Regular services attended by 4 
 local families are held in a Christian
 Brethren meeting hall. A family which 
 attends the Church of the Latter Day  
 Saints travels to Dumfries for weekly 
 worship. Sanquhar was the centre of   
 much Covenanting activity during the  
 late 17th. Century and outdoor        
 conventicles are held occasionally to 
 commemorate this time in our history .</content>
