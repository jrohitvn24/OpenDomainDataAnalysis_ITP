		<title>13RELIGION IN PETERHEAD</title>
		<content> You could say that Peterhead is a     
 fairly religious town with many       
 different denominations  represented.A
 few of the different denominations    
 include The Church of Scotland,Baptist
 Congregational and Methodist.In the   
 last few years more modern type       
 churches have emerged in Peterhead.   
 45% said they prefer a modern church ,
 25% said they prefer a more restrained
 church. 20% said they didn't know and 
 10% said they don't prefer either. We 
 asked people in the Town Centre if    
 they were a member of a church and 30%
 said that they were and 70% said that 
 they were not a member,following that 
 we asked if they attended a church    
 regularly and 15% said yes and 85%    
 said  no.During the past decade       
 Peterhead has modernised quickly and  
 there seems to be more churches but   
 less people willing to go to them.    </content>
