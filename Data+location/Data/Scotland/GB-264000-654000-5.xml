 Our local newspaper likes to publish  
 the achievements of the young people  
 in East Kilbride.                     
{TRIO KNOW THEIR MATHS.}               
 Three East Kilbride school pupils have
 won prizes in the 1985 SCOTTISH MATHS 
 CHALLENGE COMPETITION. The competitors
 had to reason their way through four  
 rounds of Mathematical puzzles which  
 were specially chosen to test logical 
 and original thought. For example.....
 "I can never remember the number of my
 Cash Dispensing Machine Card but I can
 work it out when reversed digits form 
 a number which is four times the      
 original number....What is the number?
 2178.
