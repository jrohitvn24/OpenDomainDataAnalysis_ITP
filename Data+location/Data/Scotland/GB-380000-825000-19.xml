		<title>19Bourtie Landscape</title>
		<content> Most of the landscape of Bourtie near 
 Oldmeldrum lies above 500 feet.  The  
 hill of Barra lies at 635 feet and the
 Bourtie hill between the old school   
 and the Airyhillock conifer plantation
 is over 600 feet.  The single-track   
 bourtie road, although sheltered from 
 the north by two coniferous forests   
 (30 years old) and by deciduous       
 woodland around the Old Manse 5 to 200
 years old  suffers extremes in weather
 conditions, aggravated by winds.  The 
 winter of 1981/2 made Bourtie         
 accessible only by ski or tractor for 
 14 days.  Telephones were disconnected
 and power supply was sporadic.  In    
 1984 tractors were the only vehicles  
 able to descend field tracks between  
 January 4 and 13 when the Bourtie road
 was closed by snowdrifting.  It took  
 three days to break through 12-foot   
 drifts between Bourtie ad Oldmeldrum. </content>
