{ HOUSING                              
   A lot of houses in Peterculter are 2
 story semi_detached houses although   
 there are some bungalows situated     
 there.Most of the houses have a garden
 with a small lawn.The size of the lawn
 depends on where the house was built. 
 If it was built near thhe main road it
 would not have a very big garden.If,on
 the other hand,it was built far away  
 from the main road,it would be quite  
 big.{

 The area of Craigton Terrace &amp;        
 Craigton Crescent(which are on the out
 skirts of Petercuter) is an old folks 
 housing estate.I say this because all 
 the people we interviewed were over   
 70.
