		<title>08Gourdon Fish Family Business</title>
		<content> Mr. Birse's business is a family one. 
 He starts getting ready at 6.30am each
 working day and packs the van and     
 cleans his scales and sets off at     
 8.00am. On Mondays he doesn't go out  
 because he works in the fish house    
 getting hotel orders ready and        
 cleaning things. In the Spring he     
 mostly sells{haddock,}whilst in the   
 Summer, Autumn and Winter he mostly   
 sells{herring and shellfish.}On       
 average he sells 28-30 stone a day.   
 Mr. Birse goes out in all weathers.   
 After coming home from his round each 
 day he spends about 1-2 hours tidying 
 up. The{new regulations}regarding fish
 vans means it is necessary to have a  
 wash-hand basin in the van and the    
 driver's compartment must be sealed   
 off from the back and you need a first
 aid kit.                              
                                       </content>
