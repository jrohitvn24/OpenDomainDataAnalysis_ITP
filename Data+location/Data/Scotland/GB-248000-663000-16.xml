		<title>16PAISLEY GRAMMAR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Paisley Grammar is one of the oldest  
 schools in Scotland. 'The Grammar' was
 founded in 1576 by royal charter      
 although it took 10 years to erect    
 a school building.  Thus we celebrate 
 400 years of continuous educational   
 provision in 1986.                    
 Great changes have taken place in the 
 last 20 years.  Paisley Grammar is no 
 longer a fee-paying establishment with
 a primary department, but is now a    
 fully comprehensive secondary school. 
                                       
 At a time when most school rolls are  
 falling, the school  is filled to     
 capacity - 940 pupils.  This is due in
 part to a large number of parent      
 requests for their children to attend 
 the school in preference to their     
 local schools.  The Grammar has a     
 reputation for high academic standards
 and activities like music and sport.  </content>
