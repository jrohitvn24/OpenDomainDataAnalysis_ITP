		<title>05GALA WEEK,FORT AUGUSTUS.(1).</title>
		<content> The highlight for many people in the  
 summer in {Fort-Augustus }is the {    
{Great Glen Gala }week, which means a  
 week of fun and entertainment for all.
     During the week there are various 
 sports competitions for all ages.     
 These include "fancy dress"           
 football,children's shinty,canoe      
 racing on the {Caledonian Canal},     
 tennis and a treasure hunt.For many   
 the best event is the wheelbarrow     
 race.In this competition teams of 2   
 have a "fancy dress" wheelbarrow race 
 round the local hotels and pubs.They  
 have to drink a whisky and a beer in  
 each hostelry.As they visit 5         
 establishments there is much hilarity 
 by the finish.There is to be a        
 children's race this year,but with    
 lemonade instead of alcohol.
