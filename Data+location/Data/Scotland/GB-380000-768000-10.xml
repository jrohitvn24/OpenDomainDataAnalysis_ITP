		<title>10Farming In The Gourdon Area</title>
		<content> A lot of the land in the              
 Benholm/Gourdon Hill area belongs to  
 Mr. Buchan who lives at Nether Benholm
 and farms Nether Benholm, Nether Knox 
 and Middle Knox. He has 770 acres     
 approximately. Most of the land is    
 used for{arable farming}and the crops 
 grown are mostly{oil seed rape,       
{barley, wheat and protein peas.}The   
 farmers grow a lot of oil seed rape   
 because they get a subsidy. The farmer
 harvests the rape, dries it and sends 
 it down to Glasgow. From there is gets
 used to make cooking oil. The land    
 that isn't used for crops is used for 
 rough pasture. The farmer uses 340    
 acres for the{sheep.}He also keeps    
{bulls.}He keeps them in the cattle    
 court where they are fed barley and   
 kept for 1 year before going to the   
 mart to be sold.
