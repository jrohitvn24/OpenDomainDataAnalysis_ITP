		<title>01BALMEDIE A GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> Balmedie is a relatively small        
 dormitory town, 8 miles north of      
 Aberdeen on the A92. At present there 
 are 215 houses, a mixture of private  
 and council owned. A rapid expansion  
 is planned with 600 houses due to be  
 built over the next few years.        
    The area to the west of Balmedie is
 mainly farmlands with cereal crops and
 rotational grasslands. To the east    
 lies rough grazing merging into a     
 coastal dune system which has been    
 developed  for recreational purposes. 
 There is one post office and a village
 shop, one chip shop and a motel.To the
 north there is an Eventide home.The   
 majority of people who live in        
 Balmedie commute to their work in     
 Aberdeen.
