		<title>04BONAR'S BRIDGES</title>
		<content>{The first bridge}was started in{1811  
 and finished in{1812.}The architect   
 was{Thomas Telford.} It was built out 
 of stone and steel. Two arches were   
 built and then a steel arch that went 
 to the other side of the Kyle.{The    
{next bridge}had three metal arches.   
 This bridge was low and had turrets   
 reaching from the bottom of the water 
 to the top of the arches. This was    
 destroyed by a flood in 1892 and      
 rebuilt in 1893.{The present bridge   
 has a steel arched structure and was  
 opened to traffic on the 14th December
 1973. At first the locals did not like
 this bridge.They thought it was tall  
 and ugly but now they have accepted   
 it. A monument stands at the northern 
 end of the bridge and gives           
 information on all the bridges.
