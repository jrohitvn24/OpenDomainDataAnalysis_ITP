		<title>02WHERE I LIVE</title>
		<content> I live in Hardgate which is a small   
 village not all that far from the     
 other village of Haugh of Urr.  The   
 village is mostly on a slope and there
 is usually a field behind or beside   
 most of the houses.  My house is      
 called the 'Auld Kirk' because it used
 to be a church and  you can still see 
 the old windows which used to be of   
 stained glass.  The house is white    
 washed with three doors leading out:  
 the kitchen door, the front door and  
 the garage door.  The garage is fairly
 big, it contains a bathroom and a     
 store room.  In the actual house there
 is another bathroom, a sitting room,  
 one downstairs bedroom and two        
 upstairs bedrooms.  I like living here
 because there are plenty of places to 
 go to get away from it all.
