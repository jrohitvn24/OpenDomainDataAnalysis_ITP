		<title>06MUNDOLE FARM West Forres</title>
		<content> This farm covers an area of about 150 
 acres, and is mainly used for         
 barley.By planting winter and spring  
 barley the farmer is able to make     
 better use of the land and is able to 
 harvest at different times.There is no
 livestock kept although the owners    
 keep horses for their own use.In the  
 early times all the water for the farm
 was supplied from a large well.In     
 recent years the farm has been        
 developed as a leisure centre.There is
 a caravan park,with both residential  
 and holiday caravans,chalets,a        
 shop,a function room and a bar.During 
 the summer months regular horse-riding
 events are held and in the winter the 
 function room is used for             
 bowling.During the war the land was   
 used for the now defunct Forres       
 Airfield.
