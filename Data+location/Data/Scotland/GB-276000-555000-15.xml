		<content> Young boys of about the age of ten    
 have to make a lot of their own       
 entertainment some of the time as     
 there are no amenities.               
 Most of them play football. If they   
 want they can play with something else
 like their toys which might include   
 fort and soldiers and farm toys. Many 
 have BMX bicycles which they perform  
 tricks on and going up on one wheel   
 on the bike when the rider is still on
 it. Often fishing is a popular        
 pastime. At nights they watch telly or
 play snooker.                         
 The girls when they were young climbed
 trees and made tree-huts out of wood. 
 They played on their bikes and watched
 telly most of the time. At night they 
 watched telly and played games.
