		<content>{HOBKIRK SCHOOL continued:}The original
 Hobkirk School,opened in 1857,was     
 converted to two cottages when the    
 present school was built.It was by the
 Parish Church and opposite the        
 Schoolhouse ,which has now been sold  
 too.                                  
{JEDBURGH GRAMMAR SCHOOL }is where most
 pupils go for secondary education,    
 being taken by bus.A few prefer to    
 attend {HAWICK HIGH SCHOOL.}There is  
 complete freedom of choice in this.   
{SOUTHDEAN UNDER-FIVES CLUB }provides a
 playgroup for the two dozen or so     
 pre-school children in the district,on
 two half-days a week.                 
{HENDERSON TECHNICAL COLLEGE }in Hawick
 provides most Further Education.
