		<content>  Beecraigs County Park with its easy  
 access and excellent facilities makes 
 it an ideal place to enjoy,           
 orienteering both for training and    
 competing.                            
  The forest is possibly rather tough  
 in places to encourage cutting through
 therefore causing too much use of     
 paths. The parking facilities and     
 general availability to possible start
 and finish areas are excellent.       
   The terrain in the park itself is,as
 explained earlier, excellent for the  
 young and less experienced orienteer  
 but possibly not technical enough for 
 the top class orienteer although the  
 inclusion of the Riccarton Hills has  
 given many more options to test the   
 ability of orienteers of all          
 standards.                            
  The scope for variety is very good   
 indeed.                               </content>
