		<title>01The slopes of Olrig Hill</title>
		<content> The area is bounded on the north side 
 by its highest point, Olrig hill on   
 which the vegetation is grass, moss   
 and gorse used for sheep grazing.     
 Descending the hill to the east, west 
 and south the ground becomes more     
 intensively cultivated, largely for   
 grazing and silage, with small areas  
 of (recent) coniferous forest.  The   
 area is divided by traditional local  
 quarried dry-stone and flagstone      
 walls, large and irregular areas on   
 the high ground and smaller more      
 regular and often wire fenced fields  
 on the lower ground.  The farming is  
 mainly sheep with some dairy and beef 
 and the area contains some 30 or so   
 dwellings, mostly farms.  On Olrig    
 hill is the main telecommunications   
 radio link station and to the east of 
 this is the edge of the Olrig house   
 estate with its old deciduous wood.   </content>
