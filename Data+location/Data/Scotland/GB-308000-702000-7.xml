		<content> The{main crop}in every farm in the    
 Kinross area is{barley.}Most of the   
 barley is sold for malting;the rest is
 sold for seed and feeding.One         
 disadvantage in growing a lot of      
 barley is the excessive amount of     
 straw which is left over.Many farmers 
 are unable to sell the straw so they  
 burn it,which clears the ground of    
 weeds and diseases.Other{popular crops
 are potatoes,wheat,peas,hay and       
 silage.The silage is usually stored in
 pits,but towers and baling are also   
 used.Another popular crop is oil seed 
 rape.Rape can be made in to several   
 different products consisting of oils,
 and is also used as winter fodder for 
 sheep.It is expensive to grow but     
 fetches a very good price.In this area
 the soils are very fertile;in many    
 farms this is built up through        
 carrying large livestock numbers,     </content>
