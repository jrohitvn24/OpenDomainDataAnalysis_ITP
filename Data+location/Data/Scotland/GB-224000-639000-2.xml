  Most people in SALTCOATS are         
 white-skinned{Scots.}Most of them     
 belong to families that have for      
 generations lived in the Saltcoats    
 area.{"Outsiders"}include many from   
{GLASGOW,}moved here in the early '50's
 as{"overspill"}during slum clearance. 
  There are about 40{Indians/Pakistanis
 and almost 50{Chinese.}All of these   
 people work in restaurants or small   
 shops.                                
  The population is ageing and this has
 created a demand for special housing  
 for old people (see p.4). It has also 
 led to a reduction in numbers of      
 pupils in the local schools.
