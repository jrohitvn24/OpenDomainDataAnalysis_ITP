 In Aboyne we have a regional          
 councillor, Mr Humphrey who sits on   
 the Grampian Regional{Council}and a   
 District councillor Mr Grant who sits 
 on the Kincardine and Deeside District
 Council.  Each is elected for 4 years.
 The regional elections will take place
 next in 1986 and the District         
{elections}in 1988.  The main areas    
 dealt with by the regional council are
 education, public transport, roads and

 refuse collection. {Local opinion}is  
 discussed in the mid_Deeside community

 total 20 seats and through this       
 organisation opinion is expressed to  
 the District Council on local issues  
 such as recreational facilities.      </content>
