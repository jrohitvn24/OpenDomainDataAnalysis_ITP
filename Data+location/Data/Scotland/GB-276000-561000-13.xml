		<content> Ernespie Dairy has been in existence  
 since 1945. There is 220 acres of     
 land, used mainly for growing grass to
 feed the cows. Some kale and barley   
 are also grown. The Dairy also orders 
 200 tonnes of cattle cake each year.  
 There are 150 cows which are milked   
 daily in groups of 10 or 20 in a      
 parlour at 6.00 am and 4.00 pm.       
 The cows produce 600 gallons of milk a
 day: 400 gallons are collected by road
 tanker for the Scottish Milk Marketing
 Board to be processed at a creamery.  
 The remaining 200 gallons are put into
 cartons in the dairy's own plant and  
 sold to the residents of Castle       
 Douglas and district. Most of this    
 milk is delivered daily to the        
 doorstep.
