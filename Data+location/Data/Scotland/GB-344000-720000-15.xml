 station has the following facilities:-
 a 30 space car park, a waiting room, a
 shop, toilets and a telephone.        
 Interviews with passengers at about   
 3.00 pm showed that they thought that 
 the service was good and they were    
 mainly using it to visit St Andrews.  
 A regular bus and taxi service links  
 the station to St Andrews.
