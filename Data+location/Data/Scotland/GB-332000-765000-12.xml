		<content> The following types of{game birds     
 breed in the glen:{RED GROUSE}(numbers
 declining in past 5 years){BLACK      
{GROUSE}(numbers increasing){PTARMIGAN 
{CAPERCAILLIE}(ocassionally seen){GREY 
{PARTRIDGE}(almost gone due to         
 agricultural changes)                 
    {PHEASANTS}are reared by the       
 gamekeepers in the glen for sport.    
 They are released in August ready for 
 the shooting season. Last year        
 1,200 pheasants were reared and 500   
 were shot.So I think they have a good 
 chance of escaping.                   
      {RED DEER }live on the high hills
 and eat the heather that grows there  
 and are increasing in numbers.        
      {ROE DEER }live lower than Red   
 DEER. They live in the woods and are  
 seen by the road and up the drive.    
 They are also increasing in numbers.
