		<title>05EMPLOYMENT IN MIDMAR</title>
		<content> When the oil related people came,     
 digger contractors, architects,       
 builders and also agricultural        
 contractors who also live in Midmar,  
 helped newcomers to build houses.The  
 oil  men travel into Aberdeen or Dyce 
 to work.There is also a lot of land in
 Midmar used by farmers for cows, sheep
 and cereals.There are woods all around
 Midmar so quite a few people are      
 involved with forestry.There is one   
 resident who owns a sawmill and chops 
 down trees to be made into palettes   
 to take paper to America.He employs   
 six local men.There are also jobs     
 connected with the school such as a   
 cleaner and meals server.There is a   
 taxi service that takes children to   
 and from school and delivers the      
 meals.Another resident of Midmar      
 drives a bakery van.
