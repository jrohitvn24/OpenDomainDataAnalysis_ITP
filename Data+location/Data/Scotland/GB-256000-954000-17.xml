		<title>17Banking Facilities Tongue</title>
		<content> A Bank customer in Tongue is no worse 
 off than a customer maintaining an    
 account with a large office. If any   
 thing the small branch customer will  
 receive a more personal service where 
 nearly all customers are known by name
 The services are exactly the same but 
 they are provided to a much wider area
 involving the use of sub-branches and,
 in some cases, travelling banks.In a  
 scattered community the Bank view is  
 that if the customer cannot get to the
 Bank then the Bank will get to the    
 customer.Staff in a large office tend 
 to become specialists but in a small  
 office,areas of work such as Standing 
 Order clerk or Foreign Currency clerk 
 and others, are covered by one member 
 of staff.As a result the staff are    
 more adaptable and consequently may be
 more satisfied in their work.
