		<title>03POPULATION OF INVERURIE</title>
		<content> At present in 1985 the population     
 of Inverurie is 8900.In recent years  
 the town has grown in size. This is   
 mainly due to the discovery of oil in 
 the North Sea. This brought new       
 industries to the North East of       
 Scotland and a number of oil related  
 industries have been situated in or   
 near Inverurie.                       
                                       
 The industries also brought people.   
 Many people who live in Inverurie work
 in the area, but many more commute    
 every day to  work nearer Aberdeen.   
                                       
 The people who do work in or near     
 Inverurie are mainly employed in      
 shops, offices, agriculture and the   
 paper mill. The paper mill is the     
 largest single place of employment in 
 the area.
