		<content> FOXES, BADGERS, HARES, RABBITS ARE ALL
 IN EVIDENCE. RABBITS SEEM TO BE ON THE
 INCREASE AGAIN, THOUGH NOT IN THE     
 QUANTITIES THAT BEFORE THE 1ST. WORLD 
 WAR ALLOWED THEM TO BE SENT 200 AT A  
 TIME IN HAMPERS THRICE WEEKLY BY RAIL 
 FROM MARCHMONT STATION TO THE BIG     
 CITIES. RABBIT TRAPPING WAS A MAN'S   
 SPECIFIC JOB. MANY SMALLER MAMMALS ARE
 TO BE FOUND. MOLES, MICE, RATS,       
 WEASELS ETC., ADDERS ARE SOMETIMES    
 ENCOUNTERED ON THE MOOR &amp; FROGS,      
 TOADS &amp; LIZARDS ARE SEEN. A NUMBER OF 
 BEEHIVES WERE AT MARCHMONT &amp; ON THE   
 MOOR. 1985 HOWEVER WAS NOT A GOOD     
 SUMMER FOR BEES. THE SUMMER WAS NOT   
 TYPICAL; NOR WAS LAST WINTER WHICH WAS
 LESS VIGOROUS THAN SOUTHERN ENGLAND &amp; 
 NEVER HAD A ROAD BLOCKED BT SNOW.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
