		<title>03The Train Through Mulben</title>
		<content> The railway line between Keith        
 and Mulben is parallel to the road    
 most of the way.                      
 Fourteen passenger trains and two     
 goods trains go through each day.     
 These trains carry about six thousand 
 passengers in a year.                 
 There is a Railway Station at Keith.  
 The line was first opened for         
 passengers on 18th August 1858.  Wnen 
 it opened, it made the line from      
 Aberdeen to Inverness complete.       
 The Station at Mulben was also opened 
 then,but it closed to passengers on   
 7th December 1960, and to goods on    
 20th April 1964.                      
 The Platform at Tauchers was for      
 loading and unloading at Glentauchers 
 Distillery.                           
 If you travel along this line on a    
 train, you see some beautiful scenery.
