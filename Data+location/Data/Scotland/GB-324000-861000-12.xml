		<title>12RECREATION:VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> A typical Monday's caretaking is:     
 08.00:Puts out rubbish for collection 
 09.10:Playgroup                       
 12.00:Sweeps up,closes hall.Lunch.

 15.00:Sweeps up and closes hall.      
 17.50:Junior,Senior Badminton{Clubs.  
 21.00:Cleans,locks hall until Tuesday.
  Cleaning chores have become easier as
 he has a new machine which washes and 
 polishes the floor.Still, the worst   
 time for cleaning is after Youth{Club}
 and a Dancing Festival.To scrub the   
 whole building is a full day's work.  
 Our caretaker finds his job satisfying
 because he meets people of all ages,he
 earns extra cash without affecting his
 pension and it gives him something    
 worthwhile to do.                     
  Although his actual working hours may
 seem short,our village hall could not 
 function without our caretaker.       </content>
