		<title>07HARDGATE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I go to Hardgate school which is the  
 school for most of the children around
 Hardgate and Haugh of Urr.  There are 
 forty pupils in the school altogether 
 and two full-time teachers although we
 get a music and gym teacher on        
 Tuesdays and an art teacher on        
 Fridays.                              
 The school is placed between Hardgate 
 and Haugh of Urr.  It is 119 years old
 and was built in 1866.  The school has
 three rooms, eleven large cupboards,  
 one kitchen and a dining/gym hall.    
 I go to school five days a week and   
 spend about four fifths of the year   
 there altogether.  During the year we 
 get activities like orienteering,     
 sailing, football, netball and        
 sometimes a trip.
