		<title>19GAMES WE PLAY IN DUNDEE.</title>
		<content> Here is a list of a few games we play 
 in school or near our homes_{Granny , 
{Queenie Queenie}and{Walk the plank or 
{join the crew.}How to play {Queenie   
{Queenie:}someone has a ball, they have
 to face the wall then they throw the  
 ball over his or hers shoulder. One   
 player has to catch it and hide it    
 behind his or her back then all the   
 players stand up straight and sing    
{Queenie Queenie who's got the ball is 
{she big or is she small I've not got  
{it in my pocket Queenie Queenie who's 
{got the ball.}As the players finish   
 this rhyme the ball thrower turns     
 around and tries to find out who has  
 the ball. If the ball thrower thinks  
 he or she does not have the ball then 
 they are{empty dustbins.}Another way  
 of finding who has the ball is called 
{cut the cake}, that means the ball    
 thrower can run behind players.       </content>
