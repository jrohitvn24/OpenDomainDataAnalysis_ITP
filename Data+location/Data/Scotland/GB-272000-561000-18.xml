		<title>18Whitehill of Balmaghie</title>
		<content> Whitehill is up the road from Bridge  
 of Dee. It is still much the same as  
 it was 200 years ago. It belongs to   
 Colonel Ross. It is now rented to Jock
 Armstrong.                            
 He has about 200 sheep and lambs and  
 about 400 cows. He has a farm house, a
 cottage and two big barns. There are a
 few trees but most of them are on the 
 side of the road which leads up to the
 farm. When you go up the road there is
 another farm cottage which looks older
 than the other buildings.
