 THE BURGH OF GALASHELS,ON THE BANKS OF
 GALA WATER,GREW UP BECAUSE OF THE     
 WOOLLEN INDUSTRY WHICH HAS DECREASED  
 IN IMPORTANCE IN THE LAST TWO         
 DECADES.OLDER HOUSING IS CONCENTRATED 
 NEAR THE RIVER WITH NEWER HOUSES      
 STRETCHING UP THE HILLSIDES ON EITHER 
 SIDE.                                 
 LOCAL WHINSTONE WAS ORIGINALLY USED   
 FOR BUILDING,WHILE SANDSTONE LATER    
 TOOK OVER IN THE 19th CENTURY AND     
 EARLY 20th CENTURY. MODERN HOUSING IS 
 BUILT OF BRICK AND HARLING OR PEBBLE  
 DASH.                                 
 THERE IS STILL A VERY OBVIOUS GREEN   
 BELT AROUND THE TOWN.
