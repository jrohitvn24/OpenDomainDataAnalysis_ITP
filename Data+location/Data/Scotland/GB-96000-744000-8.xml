		<content> There is a lot of fishing             
 on Tiree.Many people collect whelks.  
 Mr Oldfield buys whelks from people   
 who collect them.  Lots of people     
 have got boats and they go fishing    
 at night. People go down to the shore 
 and collect  mussels and take them    
 home to eat. You put them in a pot,   
 add some salt leave to boil for about 
 half an hour, leave for ten minutes   
 and eat.Early in the morning fishermen
 go out in their boats and check their 
 creels to see if there are any        
 lobsters in them. If there is  not    
 they will put more bait in the creels 
 .They also go fishing for saithe.There
 are three people who go diving for    
 clams- one of those people goes       
 trawling for clams.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
