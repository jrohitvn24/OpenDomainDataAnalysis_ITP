		<title>01Central Glen Muick</title>
		<content> This area of great natural beauty is  
 all privately owned &amp; is split between
 estates,the river Muick (pronounced   
 Mick),one of the bigger tributaries of
 the River Dee,being the dividing line.
 The Linn of Muick(a spectacular water-
 fall) provides a formidable obstacle  
 for the salmon on their way up        
 river.Much of the area is heavily     
 wooded - mainly coniferous but some   
 deciduous nearer to the river.The     
 3 highest points, the Coyles of Muick 
 (601m),Craig of Loinmuie(540m) &amp; Meall
 Dubh(563m) have grassy summits.There  
 is some rough pasture near the river. 
 The remainder of the area is moorland.
 There are 2 roads,one of which is     
 private.The public road is narrow with
 passing places.There is a farmhouse   
 occupied by the estate shepherd &amp; his 
 wife,&amp; 3 other properties; housing a  
 lady, a retired couple &amp; 1 unoccupied.</content>
