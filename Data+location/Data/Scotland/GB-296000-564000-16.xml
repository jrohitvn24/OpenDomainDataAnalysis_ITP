		<title>16NEW ABBEY - RECREATION</title>
		<content>   The main summer game is bowling. The
 green,situated beside Sweetheart Abbey
 was opened in 1975 and has been very  
 successful.                           
   The villagers are keen gardeners and
 vie with each other at the Annual     
 Flower Show.The area is also favoured 
 by fishermen where sea-trout,brown    
 trout and young salmon can be hooked. 
   Walking is popular and there are    
 many lovely rambles around the village
 while for the more energetic a climb  
 to the summit of Criffel is rewarding.
   There is a thriving football club   
 which plays in all seasons whilst the 
 badminton and carpet bowling clubs    
 meet weekly.                          
    The Curling Club is popular though 
 they have to travel to Lockerbie Ice  
 Rink to Play. There is a curling pond 
 behind Kindar House where a "Bonspiel"
 can be held in suitable weather.      </content>
