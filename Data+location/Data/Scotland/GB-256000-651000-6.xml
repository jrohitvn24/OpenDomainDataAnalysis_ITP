		<content> were not allowed to go and no         
 volunteer helpers could be found so   
 it closed.Many teenagers now go to the
 local High School youth club          
 outside the village.We asked the      
 members of these organisations what   
 their favourite activities were.Both  
 boys and girls liked rough games.Their
 favourite game was cities. In this    
 game you get split into three or four 
 groups and each group takes the name  
 of a city.Then the organizer shouts   
 the names of two cities out.The first 
 city has to attack the second city and
 take as many people as they can back  
 to their own corner before the        
 organizer shouts. Stop you keep       
 repeating this.Not all children like  
 to join organisations and their       
 favourite pastime is playing on the   
 computers and most liked the tapes-
