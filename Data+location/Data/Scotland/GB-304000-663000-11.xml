		<content>  Eight pupils of{Bankton Primary      
{School}went to{Bellsquarry Primary    
{School}to find out what an old        
 school was like. Bankton, our school, 
 was completed in 1979, Bellsquarry in 
 1909. We noticed how small the school 
 was and they had only 18 pupils and   
 two teachers. We have about 525 pupils
 and 23 teachers. There are only 4     
 rooms in Bellsquarry. A gym hall where
 Mrs Tait, the head teacher, takes     
 music and P.E., a dining hall where   
 children eat their dinner and watch   
 T.V. and two classrooms which were    
 different from ours. In the corner of 
 each room is a boarded up fireplace   
 which once was used to heat the rooms.
 They now have central heating like us.
 We have 16 open teaching areas and 8  
 portable units making a total of 24   
 class rooms.                          
                                       </content>
