		<title>01E. of Port William, Galloway</title>
		<content> Area contains about 6 farms, partly   
 arable &amp; mainly rough grazing with    
 some areas of wet-lands &amp; scrubland.  
 The contours are gently undulating    
 with no high peaks &amp; contains some    
 very flat areas.  The rough grazing   
 supports cattle with some sheep.  The 
 higher ground has some rock outcrops  
 of no great size. There are standing  
 stones, a set of cup &amp; ring marked    
 carvings on private farmland          
 (Drumtrodden Farm) off the A714 about 
 a mile East of Port William.  The SW  
 corner of the area embraces part of   
 the White Loch of Myrton which is     
 surrounded by coniferous with some    
 scattered deciduous trees. The roads  
 traversing the area are very well     
 metalled &amp; in good repair, but apart  
 from farm tracks, there are no public 
 footpaths. Some stone-walling around  
 fields but not in lower marshy areas. </content>
