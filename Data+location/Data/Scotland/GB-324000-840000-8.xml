		<title>08Alice Littler Park</title>
		<content> This playpark was set up by the local 
 community using money donated to      
 Aberlour by the Littler family who    
 have long associations with the       
 village.                              
 The money was used to provide a play  
 area with swings, chutes, see-saws and
 roundabouts.                          
 The park is set down by the River     
 Spey, and is a very pleasant feature  
 of the village.                       
 There are many entertaining activities
 go on around there in the course of   
 the year, such as fairs, Highland     
 Games, and Dog Shows.
