 A TYPICAL DAY FOR ME WOULD BE TO RISE 
 AT 8.45,GET WASHED DRESSED AND HAVE   
 SOME BREAKFAST,USUALLY  TOAST OR CORN-
 FLAKES.PERHAPS I MIGHT WATCH TV FOR   
 ABOUT HALF AN HOUR,THEN GO TO SCHOOL  
 AT 8.45.THE SCHOOL BELL GOES AT 9.00  
 WE DO MATHS,ENGLISH,GEOGRAPHY,READING 
 OR WE DRAW UNTIL PLAY_TIME.WE PLAY    
 LOTS OF GAMES SUCH AS ROUNDERS OR     
 BULL_DOG.WE GO BACK INTO SCHOOL AT    
 11.00 AND GET ON WITH OUR WORK UNTIL  
 LUNCH TIME WHEN WE HAVE AN HOUR FOR   
 LUNCH AND PLAY.IN THE AFTERNOON WE    
 WORK UNTIL 3.15.WHEN I GET CHANGED TO 
 KEEP MY SCOOL CLOTHES CLEAN.THEN I GO 
 OUT TO PLAY TILL 5.00 _TEA TIME.AFTER
