		<title>14TRAVEL TO GLENLUCE</title>
		<content> The village of Glenluce is split into 
 north and south by a very busy road,  
 the{A75.}This road carries traffic    
 from the port of{STRANRAER}to ports   
 all over the{UNITED KINGDOM.}It is    
 known as the{EURO-ROUTE.}The transport
 is varied but with a predomination of 
 heavy articulated lorries, between{600
 and{700}per day. The constant pressure
 of traffic has caused many accidents  
 and several{blackspots.}There are     
 three major{blackspots,}one at the    
 eastern end, one at the western end,  
 and one in the centre of the village. 
 It is because of these and the damage 
 that{4000}vehicles a day cause that   
 the village has campaigned for a      
{BY-PASS }for many many years, to no   
 avail. Traffic is increased in summer 
 because of the influx of tourists to  
 the area thus causing more problems to
 a very busy road.                     </content>
