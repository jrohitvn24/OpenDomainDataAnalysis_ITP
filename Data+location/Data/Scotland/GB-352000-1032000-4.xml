		<title>04THE WATER SCHEME IN EDAY</title>
		<content>    In 1982 a water scheme was built in
 Eday which can supply the whole island
 with mains water. Before this time    
 every household had its own well      
 and/or rain water tanks.              
    The fresh water we now get comes   
 from underground streams. The water is
 pumped up through pumping stations on 
 the west side of the island, through  
 pipes to the water tanks, one at the  
 north end and two at the south end of 
 the island.                           
    Not all of the people use this     
 facility, some of the older           
 inhabitants of the island still have  
 rain water tanks and some still use   
 their wells.                          
    The new water scheme has helped    
 many people because now they do not   
 have to go to and fro from the wells  
 and it makes the watering of cattle   
 and sheep much simpler and quicker.   </content>
