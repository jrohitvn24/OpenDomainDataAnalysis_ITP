		<title>18ARTS &amp; CRAFTS   GARTMORE</title>
		<content> Mr Cairney started{polishing stones   
 about twenty years ago. He finds some 
 on beaches where they have been washed
 down from the hills, and buys stones  
 from abroad from a rock shop. Single  
 stones take about one and a half hours
 from cutting to the final polish, but 
 a batch of several hundred stones in a
 drum can take up to 8 weeks. Some of  
 the polished stones are made into     
 cuff-links, brooches, rings, pendants,
 bracelets, and earrings and sold as   
 "Gartmore Gems".                      
 Mr Abernethy started his hobby when he
 saw a Special Austin Seven car. He now
 has a large garage where he makes his 
 cars. The first one was a Chummy,     
 which he later swapped for a purple   
 Cup model which a friend had made. He 
 has made about 5 cars. He thinks      
 Gartmore is a good place for{Vintage  
{Cars,}as a lot of people have them.   </content>
