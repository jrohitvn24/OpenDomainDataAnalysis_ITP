		<content> Winters in our area are generally     
 severe with snow lying for up to four 
 months.  Severe frost is often        
 prolonged.  These winter conditions   
 can result in the local school being  
 closed for periods up to a week owing 
 to blocked roads.  All pupils travel  
 by bus provided by the Education      
 Authority and many pupils live on     
 isolated farms. School lunches made at
 Tarland in the central kitchen        
 sometimes cannot get through.         
 Emergency food rations are kept in    
 school and pupils' emergency storm    
 addresses maybe used.                 
 Craigievar School keeps a log book    
 dating back to 1939.  It is           
 occasionally referred to by visitors  
 who once attended the school.         
  One afternoon a week, mothers help tp
 make up paints, cut paper, do library 
 duty and help us to bake.             </content>
