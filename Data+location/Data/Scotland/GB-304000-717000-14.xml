		<content> The present church was built in       
 1778,and lies at the east end of      
 Forteviot village and is a church of  
 Scotland.                             
 Between 30 and 40 people attend. The  
 number is not constant.               
 The present minister has another      
 church to attend to at Aberdalgie     
 which is north east of Forteviot. He  
 lives in Aberdalgie manse. He came    
 here less than a year ago from Leith, 
 Edinburgh. There have been 40         
 ministers here over the years.        
 Forteviot church contains valuable    
 items-a Celtic handbell and communion 
 silver.The church is kept locked for  
 this reason outside of Sunday services
 etc.
