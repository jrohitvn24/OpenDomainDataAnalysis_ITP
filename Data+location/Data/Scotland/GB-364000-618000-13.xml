		<title>13Entertainment in Jedburgh</title>
		<content>  A complaint often heard is that there
 is little entertainment.There is no   
 cinema or theatre and seldom an       
 opportunity to hear classical         
 music.The                             
 travelling Northumberland Theatre     
 Group do visit the Town Hall two or   
 three times each year.The schools are 
 visited by the County Trio, a group of
 musicians employed by the Region.The  
 town has a British Legion Pipe Band   
 and Jedforest Instrumental Silver Band
 which both perform in public.Accordian
 clubs also give concerts.The schools  
 also entertain the public with music  
 and drama.Various organisations also  
 put on some form of entertainment to  
 raise funds for charity.Discos are    
 held fairly regularly in the Town Hall
 and many clubs also hold dances.During
 the Callant's Festival various forms  
 of entertainment is provided.         </content>
