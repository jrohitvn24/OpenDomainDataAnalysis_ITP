		<content> Sanquhar, as with other small towns in
 Britain, is presently suffering from  
 the effects of the recession. The rate
 of unemployment is 25% and there seems
 little prospect of improvement. The   
 main employer in the town is a Swedish
 owned company which produces aluminium
 extrusions. This company along with an
 American owned company making carpet  
 tiles stands in an industrial estate  
 provided by the Scottish Developmant  
 Agency. Another large employer is a   
 Canadian owned company producing yarns
 for carpets, and this company has also
 received incentives to set up business
 in the area. Since the closure of the 
 local pits the longest established    
 main employer has been a factory which
 makes fireworks and military flares.  
 These four companies are at the centre
 of Sanquhar's economy and its crucial 
 to the town that they succeed.        </content>
