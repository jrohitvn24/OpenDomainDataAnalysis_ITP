		<title>04THE PAPIL STONE</title>
		<content>       IN 1880, A SCULPTURED STONE FROM
 THE CHURCHYARD IN PAPIL WAS GIVEN TO  
 THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL MUSEUM IN       
 EDINBURGH WITH PERMISSION FROM THE    
 PEOPLE WHO OWNED BURRA AT THAT TIME.  
 PAPIL WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES IN  
 BRITAIN WHERE A CHURCH WAS BUILT. THE 
 PAPIL STONE WAS A GRAVE STONE FOR     
 SOMEONE, PROBABLY A PRIEST.           
       THE STONE IS DECORATED WITH     
 INTERLACED CELTIC CROSSES AS WELL AS  
 ANIMALS, MONSTERS AND RELIGIOUS       
 FIGURES.  RESEARCHERS THINK THAT ALL  
 THE SAINTS HAD THEIR OWN ANIMAL SIGNS 
 AND THAT THE LION ON THE STONE SHOWS  
 THAT THE PRIEST WHO DIED WAS A        
 FOLLOWER OF ST,MARK. THE NAME PAPIL   
 HAS SURVIVED FROM THE TIME BEFORE THE 
 VIKINGS INVADED.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
