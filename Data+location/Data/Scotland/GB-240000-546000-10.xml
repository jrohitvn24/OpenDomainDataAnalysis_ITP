 includes 11 farmsThe majority of these
 farms are milk producing {dairy}farms,
 with some arable land for growing {   
{crops.}The sizes of farms range from  
 70 to 520 acres. There are three beef 
 farms, and only one farm keeps pigs,  
 which are reared for fattening and    
 selling to butchers and {markets}.One 
 farm keeps donkeys and another breeds 
 Clydesdale horses. The Clydesdale     
 horses are bred to be put on display  
 at agricultural shows. In the past    
 they were used to pull farm implements
    The various crops that the farmers 
 grow are turnips, barley, kale, silage
 and hay. These crops are used to feed 
 the animals in the winter time. Seven 
 of these farms keep sheep - from as   
 few as 19 to as many as 250. The sheep
 are bred for fattening, and also for  
 the production of wool.               </content>
