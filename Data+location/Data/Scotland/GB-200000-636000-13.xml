		<title>13THE FORESTRY COMMISSION (2)</title>
		<content>   The wood is used mainly for house   
 building, pulp, pit props and fencing.
 For Christmas 1984 the Commission cut 
 down 300 trees for the public to buy. 
   The Commission plans to build a pier
 to take their wood off the island.    
 The cut wood will go to the Irvine    
 Board Mill where it will be made into 
 pulp for the making of paper, card and
 other stationery products.            
   On Thursday 25th April 1985, there  
 was a forest fire at Kilpatrick.  The 
 fire started at 12.45 and was         
 extinguished at 21.30. Firemen and    
 foresters were on fire duty all night 
 in case the fire flared up again.     
 The fire destroyed approximately      
 30,000 trees covering 40 acres.  The  
 ground will be replanted in 1986.
