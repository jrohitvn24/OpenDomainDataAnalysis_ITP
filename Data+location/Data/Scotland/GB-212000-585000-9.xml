		<content> At 8 o'clock I get up and have my     
 breakfast. Then I get dressed. At five
 minutes to nine I go to school with my
 sister.We do all different things in  
 the morning. At quarter to eleven it  
 is break time.I usually stay in       
 because I get the 'wheezes'.If I go   
 out we play games.One of the games we 
 play is Cops and Robbers.The rules are
 some people are cops and some         
 robbers.The cops have to catch the    
 robbers.We make up speeding tickets   
 because the robbers are speeding.If   
 they get 2 tickets we take them to the
 judge.Then we might throw them into   
 jail.                                 
 At quarter past twelve we go for      
 dinner.At one 0'clock I come into     
 school.We get read a story sometimes.I
 get on with my work.At quarter past   
 three I go home.I play wth my three   
 sisters after school.                 </content>
