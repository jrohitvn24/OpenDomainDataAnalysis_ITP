		<title>12Hill Farmer's Wife: FINTRY</title>
		<content> Sheep farming is intensive here, so   
 the farmer's wife helps by{answering  
{the phone, dealing with salesmen and  
{directing deliveries.}From spring to  
 autumn the day starts early and ends  
 late.{Meals times are irregular and   
{she must feed helpers at lambing-time,
{dipping, clipping and the gathering   
{for sale-time.}She ferries the        
 children and probably does B&amp;B.       
                                       
 The farm house will have electricity, 
 running water from its own spring and 
 septic tanks for sewage. Domestic help
 is almost non-existant, so labour     
 saving machines are vital, especially 
 the freezer, for food is usually bulk 
 bought as few vans call now.          
                                       
 The wife{may also be called on to work
{in the fank (covered sheep pen), help 
{move stock and with orphaned lambs.   </content>
