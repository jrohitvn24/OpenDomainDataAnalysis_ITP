		<title>08FILTER STATION GREENOCK</title>
		<content> The {Maukinhill Filter Station}was    
 built in 1940 and was in use by 1941, 
 having an output of 1,420,000 gallons 
 per day.                              
 The filter station derives its        
 untreated water from the{Gryffe No1   
{and No2 reservoirs},which are         
 approximately 10 miles South-East of  
 the filter station.  The supply is    
 conveyed from the Gryffe reservoirs   
 via a tunnel.                         
 The water works consists of 12 8ft    
 diameter mechanically agitated filters
 arranged in two batteries of six and 2
 lime tanks.  The water works doesn't  
 just pump water, it pumps out chlorine
 gas to the public baths.  Before water
 is pumped to the houses it has to be  
 filtered and cleaned.                 
{What would we do without "clean"      
{water?}
