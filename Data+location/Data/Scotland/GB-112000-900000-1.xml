		<content> The School was allocated 4 D Blocks.  
 Because of the scattered nature       
 of the community,and to meet our own  
 investigative needs,the twenty pages  
 of text refer to all four blocks.Land 
 cover and amenity statistics are      
 entered on separate disks,but the text
 has been copied on to each disk.      
 Tarbert is the central village in     
 Harris,with a population of about 500.
 It is situated on the narrow isthmus  
 between East and West Loch Tarbert.In 
 Gaelic,"Tairbeart",means "Place over  
 which a boat can be drawn".A car ferry
 provides direct contact with the      
 Scottish mainland,via Skye.There is   
 also a daily bus service to Stornoway 
 the nearest airport.The township,     
 linear in pattern, east to west,      
 includes sixteen shops.It also has a  
 post office,bank,two licenced hotels,
