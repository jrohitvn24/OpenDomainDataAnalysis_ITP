		<title>13A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>  I got up at 8 o'clock in the morning.
 I got dressed and had breakfast then  
 washed and brushed my teeth. I watched
 TVAM.                                 
  Then it was time to go to school. I  
 went the shop and got some sweeties. I
 fed the hens with Susan and then went 
 to school. I go to my desk and do some
 sums and then English. At playtime I  
 go and play games. Now the bell rang  
 and after a while it is time to go for
 my dinner. After that I went to play  
 hide and seek. At 2 o'clock it was    
 time to do the hens. We got no duck   
 eggs today. After a while we went home
 at half-past three. Then at 5 o'clock 
 I went to have my tea. I did the      
 dishes and went to play with Susan at 
 swing ball. I went in and watched TV  
 and at 9:30 went to bed.
