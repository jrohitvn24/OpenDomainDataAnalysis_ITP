		<title>06HOUSING IN THE OAKLEY AREA</title>
		<content>  In the Oakley area most people live  
 in a house rather than a flat.The     
 majority are rented from the{Council  
 or the{Scottish Special Housing       
{Association.}Most of the houses are   
 semi-detached,but others are detached 
 or terraced.{Privately owned}houses   
 are mostly in Comrie which have been  
 built in the last 9 years by a local  
 builder.                              
  Few people have an{attached garage}or
 have built an{extension}and these tend
 to be in Comrie.20% have{double       
{glazing.}The houses in Oakley and     
 Blairhall,the two other villages,are  
 mostly between{20 and 50}years old.   
 45% of the houses are heated by       
 coal,the next most popular fuel being 
 gas.Most houses are 2-4 appartments.
