		<content> Today we went to the library and      
 interviewd the librarian whose name   
 was Alistair Sutherland.This was      
 not the first library there has been  
 in Arbroath. The first one was beside 
 the Sheriff Court in the High Sreet . 
 The present library has recently been 
 modernised and a computer installed.  
 Mr.Sutherland said that books and     
 music on tapes had brought more       
 custom.He also said that more people  
 than ever were using the              
 library.the busiest day is Saturday   
 and some times Tuesday.There are about
 10,000 members of the library.        
        We also asked him if there was 
 any problems with vandals or many     
 books lost or stolen.He said very     
 little compared with big cities.
