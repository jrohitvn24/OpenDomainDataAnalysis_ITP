		<content> Last year, a young man, Robert        
 Gilston, aged 21, decided to strike   
 out on his own, to avoid being        
 unemployed, despite the fact that     
 there is already a fencer and dyker in
 the area.  Robert learned his trade   
 locally, and uses the raw materials on
 the site of his work, ie broken down  
 walls.  Because of the huge mileage of
 stone walls which continually fall    
 down with age, Robert says there will 
 always be plenty of work.             
 From the centre of the village the    
 firm of Neil and McWhirter run a heavy
 haulage business.  There are three    
 workers, who are kept busy working on 
 new road developments, and on many    
 other sites needing heavy plants.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
