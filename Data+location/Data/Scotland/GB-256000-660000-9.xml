		<content> The Toryglen Gala is an annual event  
 which last for three days in the month
 of June. It is organised by the       
 Toryglen Community Centre. The proper 
 name for the centre is the Geoff Shaw 
 Centre. The Centre is called after    
 Geoff Shaw who was a Strathclyde      
 Regional Councillor who first started 
 up community centres. Every year a    
 Gala Queen is chosen from either the  
 Primary Seven in our school (St.      
 Brigid's) or Toryglen Primary         
 School.The Queen has four attendants  
 also chosen from the schools. During  
 these three days there are different  
 events such as competitions, parties  
 and football matches. The biggest     
 event is the Gala Concert at which the
 Gala Queen is crowned and the trophies
 are presented to the local football   
 teams. The entertainment is provided  
 by groups from the local schools.     </content>
