		<title>09Traffic problems in Perth</title>
		<content> The two Perth Bridges prove quite a{  
 Bottle neck for traffic from the North
 and South passing through Perth.      
 Local traffic causes Great Problems in
 the morning and teatime rush hours.   
 Thursdays,Fridays &amp; Saturdays are{    
 especially busy with country folk     
 coming to town to shop.               
 Special events such as the Perth      
 Agricultural Show in July &amp; The Scone 
 Horse Races cause traffic problems as 
 do public holidays in other towns like
 Dundee,Aberdeen,Glasgow &amp; Edinburgh.  
 English &amp; Foreign holiday traffic     
 build up mainly in the months of      
 August &amp; September.                   
 The new Friarton Bridge,which is down 
 river has helped a bit,but many people
 still prefer to come into the town.   
 Perth is such a Beautiful city that   
 traffic problems do not deter people  
 from visiting!                        </content>
