		<content>  The AA four pennant caravan/camp site
 at Haughton House Country Park brings 
 many visitors. The Georgian mansion   
 house forms the centre piece with most
 facilities based there. The upper     
 floors contain self-catering flats.   
 The ranger service at the new inter-  
 pretive centre give information about 
 the countryside. As well as excellent 
 recreational facilities locally, the  
 park has nature trails and attractive 
 picnic and play areas.It is one of    
 Grampian's top tourist attractions.   
 The Transport and Railway museums     
 along with the narrow gauge railway   
 are popular. Some visitors come to    
 salmon fish in the Don, some to visit 
 the many nearby castles and ski       
 slopes. With these many facilities,   
 attractive countryside and warm- heart
 ed folk tourism is a growth industry.
