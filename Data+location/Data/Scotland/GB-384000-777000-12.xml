		<content> Catterline is a small village which   
 has a small Episcopalian church. It is
 used only once a month. It has a      
 grave-yard which has about thirty     
 graves. People cannot buy ground for  
 burial but people who bought land in  
 the past can still be buried there.   
 The English church was built in the   
 nineteenth century. The walls of the  
 church are beginning to show signs of 
 erosion because of wind and rain.     
 There is another grave-yard nearer the
 village but this is a much older one  
 and no-one can be buried there now.The
 main religion of the village is       
 Presbyterian and the people who       
 worship in this way go to Kinneff     
 Church or elsewhere. There are a few  
 people in our area who are Jehovah's  
 Witnesses. They go to Stonehaven to   
 worship.
