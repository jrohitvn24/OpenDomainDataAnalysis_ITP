		<title>03SURVEY OF STIRCHES.</title>
		<content> We compiled a survey to find out more 
 about the people who live in Stirches 
 estate. Out of 75 households          
 interviewed we found that: (a)        
 Virtually everybody enjoyed living on 
 the estate. (b) Most had children and 
 that the ages of these children varied
 from under school age to well over    
 l6.(c) Almost everyone would have     
 liked a shop on the estate. A         
 Community Centre would also have been 
 popular but only about half requested 
 a pub on the estate. (d) Most people  
 have lived here over five years which 
 suggests most people moved into the   
 estate when the houses were new. (e)  
 Most people had lived in Hawick before
 they moved to Stirches. Only about a  
 third of Stirches residents were      
 incomers to Hawick.                   
                                       
                                       </content>
