 Voe is a picturesque village          
 positioned at the north end of the    
 Shetland mainland.It gets its name    
 from its situation around a voe or    
 deep water inlet.                     
 The land in Voe is mainly rough       
 grazing with only a few trees planted 
 at Lower Voe. The absence of trees is 
 due to our windy climate and the salt 
 sea spray.                            
 Voe is 10 miles south of Sullom Voe   
 where the oil terminal is sited. The  
 construction of the Sullom Voe Oil    
 Terminal in the 1970's resulted in    
 many changes to the local community.  
 Employment was provided for some local
 people,main roads were improved and   
 widened and more houses were built in 
 the area.                             
                                       </content>
