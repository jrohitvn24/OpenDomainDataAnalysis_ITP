		<title>07Meadowbank Sports Centre</title>
		<content>{Meadowbank Sports Centre}was built for
 the Commonwealth Games in 1970. It is 
 used for {recreation,athletics }and   
 sporting events. Entrants for the     
 Olympics train there.                 
 I go to Meadowbank for badminton and  
 karate, as I want to be fit and       
 protect myself against muggers.       
 We asked an attendant why he chose to 
 work there. He said he was made       
 redundant from Portobello Power       
 Station and had applied for any       
 situation there. He sets up halls for 
 the various sports. We asked a member 
 of the public why he used Meadowbank. 
 He used the track once a month for    
 running, and he thought that the      
 Stadium had something for everyone.   
                                       
 Edinburgh has also many other centres 
 for all types of sport and leisure    
 activities.                           </content>
