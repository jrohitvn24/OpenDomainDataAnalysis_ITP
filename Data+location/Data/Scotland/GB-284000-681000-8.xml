 most common crimes are theft and      
 vandalism but{drugs}involvement is    
 changing the whole outlook of police  
 work. Policemen are back to walking   
 the beat and are doing so singly, not 
 in pairs, by order of the Chief       
 Constable. Policemen would like more  
 involvement with the public as they   
 strive to keep{law and order.
