		<title>13LANDSCAPE..RURAL LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> Farmscape dominates our area. Field   
 sizes vary from 5 hectares to 20      
 hectares and field boundaries of      
 hedgerows,stone dykes and fence add   
 variety to the landscape. The higher  
 parts of Mount Hill are left as rough 
 grazing with woodland plantations     
 which will mature and become more     
 dominant. Throughout the area there   
 are patches of deciduous woodland and 
 it is pleasing to note that hardwood  
 replanting is taking place to replace 
 the old trees. Though some of our area
 is quite low lying no wetland remains.
 All of it has been drained for        
 farmland. All in all,however, our     
 rural landscape seems to acheive      
 excellent farming output and at the   
 same time provides ample cover for a  
 varied wildlife.
