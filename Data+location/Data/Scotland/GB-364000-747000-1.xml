		<content> This block is situated midway between 
 the towns of {Arbroath }and {Montrose}
 on the east coast of Scotland.        
                                       
{Farming}is the most obvious feature of
 the area and various crops are grown. 
                                       
 The centre of the area is the small   
 village of {Inverkeilor}where housing,
 a primary school, a church, post      
 office and store and a hotel are to be
 found.                                
 The area has many {clubs}and          
 organisations and these are also based
 in the village.                       
                                       
 The block is divided by the {A92 }    
 Dundee to Aberdeen road and the main  
 railway line to the north. The {Lunan 
{Water }runs through the north of the  
 block.
