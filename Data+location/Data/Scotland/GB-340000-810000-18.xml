		<title>18Glenkindie Estate.</title>
		<content> The estate house,dating from 1727,is  
 sited in the secluded beauty of       
 Donside.It incorporates stone work    
 from an earier 16th Century dwelling. 
 Approximately 20 families live &amp; work 
 on this estate.The absentee landowner,
 knows the difficulties of keeping     
 a close relationship with the         
 Community as did former resident      
 Lairds.He wishes to contribute to the 
 district as he can.The Annual Rent    
 Court is considered a good platform   
 for discussion between tenants &amp; owner
 Its historical use was for the setting
 of future rents by the Laird.The      
 landowner knows the existing way of   
 life should not be disturbed too      
 dramatically though the instigation of
 long term improvements to land &amp;      
 buildings must continue.By so doing he
 seeks to honour his obligation to his 
 tenants &amp; the estate.                 </content>
