		<content> The higher rockier ground has tended  
 to lose both plant and soil cover as  
 the gulls have advanced, but the      
 thicker peaty soil, heavily manured by
 gulls, has resulted in a lush summer  
 growth of orache, chickweed and curled
 dock. However during the winter the   
 soil is vulnerable to erosion by      
 wintering gull roosts, puffin nesting 
 burrows and rabbit warrens as well as 
 by the forces of wind and rain.       
 The lichen growth is lush and a       
 variety of different types. There is a
 certain amount of air pollution from  
 the mainland and from vessels in the  
 Forth and leafy lichens have not been 
 observed.
