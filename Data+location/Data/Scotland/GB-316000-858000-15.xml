		<content> People in the Mosstowie area do not   
 need to go very far afield for their  
 pastimes because the amenities are    
 good.Gardening,cycling and playing the
 piano are the most popular hobbies and
 sewing,knitting and cooking are also  
 enjoyed.During the winter months many 
 people go to rural and guild meetings.
 Most people in this area prefer living
 in the country.The people that liked  
 cycling would put their point of view 
 as"I think that living in the country 
 helps a lot because it is more        
 enjoyable cycling in the peace and    
 quiet of the country".The advantage of
 the country for gardeners is that     
 their gardens are bigger and better.
