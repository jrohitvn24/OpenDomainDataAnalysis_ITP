		<title>09RIVER DON INVERURIE</title>
		<content> The Stanners is the name of the piece 
 of ground formed between the junction 
 of the Rivers Don and Urie. Further   
 along the Urie stands the Bass, which 
 is a sand and gravel hill formed by   
 the action of the river in geoglogical
 times.                                
                                       
 The remains of a former canal can be  
 seen near the Inverurie Bridge. This  
 canal was built in the 18th century to
 convey goods from Inverurie to        
 Aberdeen before the road was built and
 before the coming of the railway.     
                                       
 Two mills used the waters of the Don. 
 There was a Meal Mill, which stood    
 near the canal, and a Paper Mill. Only
 the Paper Mill remains today and it is
 a very modern mill using modern       
 technology.
