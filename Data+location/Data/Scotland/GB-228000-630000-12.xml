		<content> My name is ELAINE LENNOX and I live in
 the town of TROON.I am going to tell  
 you about a normal day in my life.Iget
 up from sleep at 8 a.m.I know when to 
 get up because I have an alarm clock  
 which releases a long wailing sound   
 when it is time to start a new day.As 
 five days a week are school days I    
 dress in my school uniform which      
 consists of a grey skirt, white       
 shirt,a school tie and a black        
 blazer.I then go downstairs to the    
 kitchen to eat my  breakfast.My first 
 meal of the day consists of cereal    
 except on Saturdays when I have bacon 
 and eggs, a cup of coffee and heaps of
 toasted bread.In the evening I drink  
 fizzy drinks called lemonade while    
 watching a home entertainment system  
 called television.                    
                                       
                                       </content>
