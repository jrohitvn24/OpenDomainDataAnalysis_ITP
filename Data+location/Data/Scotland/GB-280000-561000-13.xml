		<title>13GEOGRAPHY OF DALBEATTIE</title>
		<content> Dalbeattie is situated in the valley  
 of the River Urr.On each side of the  
 river there are hills of igneous rock 
 sloping upwards to a height of 500-600
 feet.On the lower parts the land is   
 fertile and is cultivated by the local
 farmers who grow wheat, barley and    
 grass on it.                          
  As the ground rises the land is more 
 suited to grazing for sheep and       
 cattle.The most common cattle to be   
 found are Friesian &amp; Galloway although
 some Charollais have been introduced  
 in the last few years. The sheep are  
 mainly Blackfaces.                    
  Where the land is not suitable for   
 grazing, trees have been planted.These
 are mainly pine, spruce &amp; fir forests 
 although there are some woods of other
 trees such as birch and beech.        
  Many people work in light industries 
 as well as in retail and catering.    </content>
