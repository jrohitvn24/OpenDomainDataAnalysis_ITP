 The area is located in Glasgow, south 
 of the river Clyde. It contains the   
 historic parishes of Govan, Cathcart, 
 and Eastwood. The area is essentially 
 residential, although the quality and 
 type of housing varies considerably   
 within. The use of sandstone as       
 a building material is common as in   
 many areas of Glasgow.  Industry and  
 commerce within the area is confined  
 to two sites, in the extreme N.East   
 (POLMADIE) and on the western fringe  
 (POLLOKSHAWS).Shopping facilities are 
 concentrated at Shawlands Cross,      
 Kilmarnock Road and Victoria Road.    
  The land rises in a southerly        
 direction(3o-6om.). The area has      
 large amounts of open space including 
 three major public parks. Also        
 included in the area is the national  
 football stadium.                     </content>
