		<content> The most common number of people in a 
 household is four with almost as many 
 single people (a result of the number 
 of senior citizens ). Although those  
 with five or more per household is    
 relatively common . Most people rise  
 between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. have toast  
 and/or cereal with liquid refreshment 
 (mostly tea or coffee). Few people    
 have a fried breakfast or nothing at  
 all at this time of the day. In the   
 morning most people watch TV fewer    
 listen to the radio and even fewer    
 read the papers but many people said  
 they did none of these. The largest   
 group of people watch 1-4 hours of TV 
 a day. About half of this number view 
 5-8 hours with a very small number    
 watching less than 1 or more than 8   
 hours a day.
