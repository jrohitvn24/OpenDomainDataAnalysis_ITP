		<content> In the winter the days are very short.
 It gets dark at 4.00 pm.so we spend   
 all evening indoors.Some people watch 
 T.V. but we don't have one.My brother 
 reads all the time but I like to play.
 I play with my battery-powered truck, 
 my farm or my lego.Mum and dad Knit   
 and listen to the radio.              
   In the summer it never gets really  
 dark (Simmer Dim) so I play outside a 
 lot.When I come home from school I    
 like to row around the bay in our     
 fibre-glass dinghy.Somtimes I go out  
 with my dad in his 16' Orkney built   
 boat.We fish for mackerel,ollick and  
 pilticks.My brother has a wet suit and
 likes to go snorkelling but it's too  
 cold for me.                          
   Mummy likes to build dry stone walls
 and dig the garden.She grows soft     
 fruit,flowers and vegetables.I like to
 pinch the peas when she's not looking!</content>
