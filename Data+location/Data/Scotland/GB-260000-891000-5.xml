		<title>05PEAT CUTTING, BONAR</title>
		<content> Many people in our village burn{peat  
 as fuel from their own{peat banks     
 nearby. About the 2nd last week in May
 they start cutting the divots (which  
 are big cubes of turf )so they can    
 reach the peat. The tools which are   
 used are called a{powersaw, rutter    
{spade and a hawk.}Then they start     
 cutting the peats and spreading them  
 to dry. The tool they use is a{peat   
{knife.}If there is any water running  
 into the peat bank they have to dig a 
 culvert to drain it. Then after a few 
 weeks the peats are stacked into      
 cubes. Once they are dry, they are    
 bagged and taken home to burn. Most   
 people build their peats into stacks  
 near their homes.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
