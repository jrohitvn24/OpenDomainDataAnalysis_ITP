		<title>15RUTHERFORD CHURCH</title>
		<content> Rutherford Church,situated in the     
 Rosemount area has recently undergone 
 quite a transformation.The new        
 minister,Reverend David Graham had the
 church renovated and has used his     
 imagination to try and encourage      
 people back to the church.The church  
 itself is used for games and actives  
 during the weekas well as for         
 regular church sevices.There is       
 now a daily coffee shop and bookstall 
 run by volunteers which has become    
 an important social meeting place for 
 local old people.The Saturday morning 
 markets have also become very popular 
 A'Speak Easy' booth,part of Aberdeen  
 Cable T.V.,is availablefor public     
 use.One of its prime functions is to  
 provide a media outlet for community  
 groups and also individuals who feel  
 strongly about some liocal issues.
