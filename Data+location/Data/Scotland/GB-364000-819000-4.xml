		<content> Alexander Moir of Pond Croft, Keig, is
 a noted breeder and handler of Border 
 Collies. He grazes a flock of stock   
 ewe hoggs on ground rented from       
 Harthill Farms from the end of        
 September to the 1st. April the       
 following year when they are sold.    
 Mr. Moir usually has four working     
 collies - at present these consist of 
 two bitches, Fan, the eldest at seven 
 years of age, and Meg plus two dogs,  
 Moss and Glen. Most of his dogs begin 
 to work at about nine months old but  
 Mr. Moir has a bitch puppy who is     
 learning her duties at four months    
 which, according to her master, is the
 earliest he has ever known a collie to
 start working.                        
 Mr. Moir wins many prizes with his    
 collies which are attractive animals  
 in top condition.
