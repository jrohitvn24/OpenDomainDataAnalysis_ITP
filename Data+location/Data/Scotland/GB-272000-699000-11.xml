		<title>11DOUNE PONDS NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content>{ Doune Ponds}used to be a{sand quarry 
 before it was turned into a nature    
 reserve. It has three different ponds 
 and each looks very different. The    
 first pond you come to is about the   
 smallest and near the middle is a     
 4-5m. long island. The second pond has
 trees all around it and a raft near   
 the middle which is used by swans and 
 coots. The last pond has some reeds at
 the back where birds can nest. This   
 year the coots are nesting on the raft
 and the mute swans are nesting in the 
 reeds. There are all types of trees   
 and bushes, Willow, Myrtle, Rowan,    
 Wayfaring tree and Birch, most of them
 planted by Doune Nature Club and      
 children from our school. On your     
 visit you will most likely see coots, 
 mute swans, whitethroats, willow      
 warblers, robins, swallows and swifts.
