		<title>05THE CHURCH IN FINZEAN.</title>
		<content> The Christian Church is represented   
 mainly by the{Church of Scotland}with 
 a membership of 180. Attendance at    
 worship is on average 35/50 with the 2
 Communion services drawing about 110. 
 There is a growing population of those
 with no Church connection, many of    
 them recently moved into the area.    
{The membership is faithful and deeply 
{involved in community life and        
{neighbourhood care -}indeed so closely
 identified that this would not always 
 be consciously attributed to the      
 Church.Practical care extends abroad. 
{Burial,marriage and, to a lesser      
{extent, baptism}are still important,  
 not only to the Church membership, but
 to the community.                     
 Finzean shares its present minister , 
{Rev.Elizabeth Kinniburgh,}with the    
 two neighbouring parishes.
