		<content> There are 2 Church of Scotland        
 churches.St. Columba's whose minister 
 is Rev Philip McCardel, was the former
 parish church and now has a membership
 of 1240 and 80% attendance. It is     
 surrounded by the old town graveyard. 
 John Knox's minister is Rev George    
 Campbell, with a membership of 640 and
 76% attendance.This church often has  
 visitors from overseas to join in the 
 worship. Behind this church is "The   
 Cottage", a house to meet and talk.   
 This is open every day for anyone who 
 wishes to drop in. The Kirk Session   
 has been instrumental in opening it   
 this year. There is a Congregational  
 Church at top of Avenue Street.Roman  
 Catholic Worshippers meet in Our Lady 
 of St. John which has a very good     
 youth club, Focus. Minority religious
