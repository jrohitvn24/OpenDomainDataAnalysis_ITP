		<title>01THE VILLAGE OF BALLATER</title>
		<content> Prior to the 1790's Ballater as such  
 did not exist.  The nearby settlement 
 of Tullich was the centre of          
 population in the area.  The growth of
 popularity of the spa of Pannanich    
 encouraged the local laird to build   
 the first houses at Ballater to cope  
 with the influx of visitors "taking   
 the waters".  At about the same time  
 moves had been made to build a        
 "centrical kirk" on the muir at       
 Ballater. Building was started in     
 1798.  A bridge over the Dee was      
 constructed in 1794. The church became
 the natural centre for the growing    
 village.                              
 By the 1840's Deeside was renowned for
 its good dry climate.  Attracted by   
 this Queen Victoria made her first    
 visit here and in 1854 bought the     
 estate of Balmoral.
