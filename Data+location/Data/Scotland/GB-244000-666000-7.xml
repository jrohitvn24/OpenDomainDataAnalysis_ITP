		<title>07EGG FARM-INCHINNAN</title>
		<content> Brownsfield Egg Farm,Inchinnan,has    
 been owned by the same farmer for 3   
 yrs.The farmer's busy day begins at   
 6.30am,when the 4500 eggs,which are   
 laid daily,are collected and sorted.  
 An automatic sorting machine weighs   
 and grades the eggs,most of which are 
 sold in the busy farm shop.The eggs   
 which are not kept for sale in the    
 shop are sold to local dealers,and    
 some even go as far away as           
 Inveraray, which is sixty miles from  
 Inchinnan.                            
    The mobile lawnmowers,otherwise    
 known as Jacob's Sheep,are keeping the
 grass short in the new car-park,which 
 will be needed next year when the farm
 expands into "pick your own"          
 strawberries and raspberries.The sheep
 are also kept for their fleece,which  
 is spun into high quality wool.
