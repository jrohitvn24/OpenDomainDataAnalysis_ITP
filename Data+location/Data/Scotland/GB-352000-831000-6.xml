		<content> The most obvious feature of this block
 is the River Bogie which meanders at  
 150/160m above sea level along the    
 western edge.At periods of thaw or    
 heavy rainfall the banks are widely   
 flooded causing some erosion. It is   
 spanned by two bridges (for one see   
 LOCAL HISTORY).The other built in 1884
 is at the entrance to the village from
 the A97.The Aberdeen-Inverness railway
 &amp; the A97 also lie along this valley. 
 The land rises fairly steeply eastward
 of this valley,reaching 420m at the   
 Hill of Corskie in the north-east,and 
 434m (the highest point) in the south-
 east at Knockandy Hill.               
 Disused slate quarries (from one came 
 the slates for Barmoral Castle) are   
 all around this sector,especially on  
 Corskie Hill.One quarry close to its  
 summit is still used to extract hard- 
 core for the Forestry roads.          </content>
