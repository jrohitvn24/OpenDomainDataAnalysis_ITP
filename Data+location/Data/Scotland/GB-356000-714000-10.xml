  This country school is situated in   
 the centre of the village and         
 educates 10 children of which 8 come  
 from Boarhills and 2 are from         
 St.Andrews. The school role has       
 drastically decreased in numbers over 
 the past 50 years .In 1936 there were 
 60 pupils. The school has two teachers
 -one full-time and the other          
 part-time.                            
 The school itself is well equipped    
 with a computer, video recorder and   
 numerous items of gym equipment. They 
 have a small music department         
 comprising a piano, xylophone and     
 various percussion instruments.       
 The majority of the pupils bring      
 packed lunches but the local authority
 will provide a cooked  lunch if       
 desired.                              </content>
