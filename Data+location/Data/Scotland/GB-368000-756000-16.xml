		<content> During the 1670's some leading local  
 citizens attempted to reclaim a large 
 part of{Montrose Basin}for farming    
 purposes.This reclamation project was 
 butressed by an embankment,or dyke,   
 known as{"Dronners"}dyke which        
 stretched from the east to the west of
 the Basin.The aim was to confine the  
 River Southesk to a narrower channnel 
 and to prevent the sea from inundating
 the reclaimed land.                   
 The{"Dronners"}dyke,due to defects in 
 its construction,was destroyed by     
 a violent storm in the winter of 1678.
 Most folks said that it would have    
 survived unharmed if Maggie Cowie,a   
 local witch,had left it alone.At the  
 height of the storm she stuck her     
 finger into it and sent it tumbling.  
 More recently, a number of phantom    
 airmen, killed at{Montrose,}have been 
 seen many years after their deaths.   </content>
