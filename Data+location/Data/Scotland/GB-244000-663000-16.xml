		<title>16Old Industries</title>
		<content>   The old industries (or industries   
 that have ceased production) in       
{Linwood}are mainly confined to the Car
 Plant.The plant was opened in 1964 as 
 part of the{MacMillan Government's    
{Regional Development Policy}. The car 
 plant was owned by the Coventry firm  
 of{Rootes}. In 1971 Rootes was taken  
 over by the American company{Chrysler.
 However the massive increase in the   
 price of petrol in 1973 - 200% in     
 three months - along with outdated    
 models, caused the company great      
 difficulties. The plant was sold in   
 the late 1970s to the French          
 consortium of{Peugeot/Talbot/Citroen. 
 This, however , failed to solve the   
 factory's problems and in 1982 it shut
 down with a loss of 3000 jobs. On the 
 brighter side ,the{Linwood Paper Mill 
 has continued production.{Galbrath    
{Stores}has started in the town.       </content>
