{privately built}(owner occupied).     
  There are some large villas alongside
 the two main roads.Many of these      
 houses have large gardens surrounded  
 by trees,hedges and walls.It is       
 because of these old sandstsone houses
 that part of Busby is a{Conservation  
{Area.}                                
  The majority of private houses are

 built before the war.There are newer  
 private houses and flats next to the  
 industrial estate.                    
  About a third of the houses are
