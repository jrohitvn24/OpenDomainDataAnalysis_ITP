		<content> MY HOBBY IS LEGO-BUILDING, AND I HAVE 
 JOINED THE LEGO CLUB.   EACH YEAR,    
 THEY SEND ME THREE "BRICKS AND PIECES"
 MAGAZINES, A CLUB BADGE, STICKERS AND 
 A SEW-ON BADGE.   I HAVE SIX BOXES OF 
 TECNIC LEGO AND 5 BOXES OF NORMAL     
 LEGO.  I BUILD CARS, LORRIES,         
 FORK-LIFT TRUCKS, T.V. CAMERAS.  ONCE 
 I MADE A LEGO FACE, WITH BLUE EYES,   
 THAT GLOWED IN THE DARK.              
 MY HOBBY IS COMPUTERS, AS I HAVE HAD A
 16K ONE FOR A YEAR.  I USE IT MAINLY  
 TO PLAY SPACE ADVENTURE GAMES OR FOR  
 PROGRAMMING MY OWN GAMES.  MY DAD USES
 IT FOR HIS BUSINESS.  I WOULD LIKE TO 
 BE A REPORTER - THEN I CAN USE A WORD 
 PROCESSOR AND PRINTER.                
 COARSE FISHING IS MY HOBBY, WHICH I   
 OFTEN DO ON HOLIDAY IN LOCH SHIN.  I  
 USE A 9 FEET SPINNING ROD TO CATCH    
 PIKE OR PERCH ON A 15 POUND LINE.
