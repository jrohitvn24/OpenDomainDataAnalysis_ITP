		<title>05Social Concerns in Johnstone</title>
		<content> Being directly on the flight path of  
 the nearby Glasgow Airport, aircraft  
 noise is a major nuisance in          
 Johnstone. Despite local petitions,   
 the problem of noise continues to grow
 as the number of flights increase.    
 There is a small chemical factory     
 situated on the Beith Road(A737).     
 There has been local fears that the   
 chemical wastes are causing a high    
 rate of cancer in the housing scheme  
 behind the factory.  These claims,    
 however, have not been verified.      
 Local concern over road safety has    
 been centred on convoys of coal       
 lorries, travelling from Hunterston to
 Ravenscraig as a result of the miners 
 strike in '84.  Since the end of the  
 miners strike local protests to have  
 all coal taken by rail have failed and
 some convoys still continue.
