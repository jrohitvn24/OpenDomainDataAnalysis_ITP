		<title>13BALFRON LIBRARY</title>
		<content>    The{library}in Balfron has two     
 librarians who deal with about 250    
 borrowers each week. The library has a
 wide selection of books-ten thousand- 
 with more fiction than non-fiction. A 
 system of inter-library exchanges     
 allows the librarians to obtain books 
 from other libraries, should they be  
 requested.                            
    The library is used regularly by   
{children}of all ages and, as well as  
 books, there are talk-books,cassettes,
 and audio-records, and story time is  
 held each week. A festival week is    
 held annually, with a disco, painting 
 competition and treasure-hunt to      
 encourage the children to use the     
 library.                              
    A large{mobile library}is sent to  
 serve outlying houses in the area.    
 Books with very large print are in    
 supply for those with poor eyesight.  </content>
