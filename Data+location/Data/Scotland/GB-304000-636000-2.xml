		<content>{Biggar}is a place of great Historical 
 interest.The name {Biggar}is thought  
 to mean "soft land",which is an ideal 
 description of the neighbourhood.Finds
 made in the area show that Man has    
 been here since the Middle Stone Age  
 (4,500 B.C).Overlooking {Biggar }is   
{Bizzberry},the site of an Iron Age    
 fort.In Roman times a road ran through
{Biggar}. {Biggar }became an important 
 place in the Middle Ages with the     
 arrival of the {Fleming }family in the
 reign of Malcolm 4th  (1153-65). The  
 Flemings built an earth work          
 castle,which was replaced c.1400 by   
 astone castle outside {Biggar} called{
{Boghall},there are some ruins still   
 left.{Biggar }has an interesting      
 Mediaeval church called St            
 Mary's,which was the last Mediaeval   
 church to be built in Scotland.
