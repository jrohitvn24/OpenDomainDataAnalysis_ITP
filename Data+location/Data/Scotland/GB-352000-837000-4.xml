		<content> Sheltered  housing is a small flat    
 within a block. Heating and some      
 furniture are provided but most people
 use their own. There is a communal    
 lounge where you meet the other       
 residents. A warden keeps an eye over 
 everyone. I interviewed Mrs Milne.    
 She does her own shopping, and has a  
 homehelp. Mrs Milne thinks sheltered  
 housing is a good thing and its       
 comfortable. She thinks her house is  
 big enough.It has two rooms,a living  
 room,kitchen and a bedroom. Mrs Milne 
 has meals on wheels on Tuesday and    
 Friday.And has many visitors calling. 
 I interviewed Mrs Morrison who lives  
 in an ordinary house and is married.Mr
 and Mrs Morrison get Â£59.00 pension   
 to share between them every week.
