		<title>01Hoy &amp; Rysa little</title>
		<content> This area is on the eastern side of   
 Hoy overlooking Scapa Flow.   It is   
 rough moorland a very hilly rising to 
 about 120 metres.   Several large     
 burns have cut into the hills forming 
 deep sheltered gullies with a deep    
 covering of heather and shrubs.       
 There are very deep peat bogs here and
 extensive peat cutting has taken place
 near the roadside.   The only         
 cultivated land in near the shore is  
 Rysa.   Just off Hoy is the island of 
 Rysa Little, this is uninhabited and  
 is covered in heather.   The waters   
 here are very sheltered and the bays  
 on Hoy are very good for trout        
 fishing.
