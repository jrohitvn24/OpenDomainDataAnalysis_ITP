		<title>01GOVAN, A DIVIDED DISTRICT</title>
		<content>   This block of S.W. Glasgow is       
 dissected by several major roads,     
 including a motorway, producing a     
 network of small communities, all of  
 which have a district character and   
 inhabitants mutually suspicious of    
 each other.  Many teenagers cross into
 other districts,seen as foreign       
 territory, only with a crowd of       
 friends.  Even within each area there 
 are local differences with 'nice'     
 streets and 'rough' streets.  These   
 minute social distinctions are        
 unobservable to a visitor, shopping in
 the streets servicing the locals,     
 relaxing in the parks or determinedly 
 travelling to the city centre by road 
 or rail.  Many of the locals are more 
 familiar with the city centre than    
 the district adjacent to them, which  
 can be as remote as another town.
