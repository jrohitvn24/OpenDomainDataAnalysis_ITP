		<content> Farming in the Burnhervie area.       
                                       
  Agriculture in this area is mostly   
 arable. Approximately thirty per cent 
 of the land is used for this purpose. 
 The best arable land is that nearest  
 to the River Don to the south of the  
 block. A number of farms are situated 
 along the Blackhall road which runs   
 from Inverurie to Aquhorthies.        
  The principal summer crop is barley  
 which is grown by almost all farmers  
 in the block. The main winter crip is 
 turnip. There is some dairy farming at
 Blackhall Dubston and Alton farms.    
 Blackhall farm is an important poultry
 producer particularly larger fowl such
 as geese and turkey.                  
  Farming is a major source of work,   
 as it is throughout the wider area.
