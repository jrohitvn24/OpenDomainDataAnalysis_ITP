		<title>07HOUSING IN KINNEFF AREA</title>
		<content> The{types of houses} in this area are 
 detached,semi_detached,terraced and   
 bungalows.Most of the houses are in   
 the village. Martin Terrace, a row of 
 semi_detached{council houses}was built
 approximately 50 years ago. The newest
 houses in the village have been       
 built over the last 20 years to       
 replace the prefabs. Some of them have
 been specially built for old people.  
 The oldest houses in the village are  
 privately owned.                      
   In the last ten years about ten new 
{privately owned houses}have been      
 built. One of them has solar panels   
 fitted. The new manse was built to    
 replace the large old manse that is   
 now used as a{guesthouse.}Outwith the 
 village we find mainly{farmhouses}and 
{'cottar'houses.}Less workers on the   
 farms means, nowadays that these      
 houses can be rented.                 </content>
