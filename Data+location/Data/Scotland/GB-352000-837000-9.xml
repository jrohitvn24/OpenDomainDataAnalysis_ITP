		<title>09A FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content> Mr. Shand is a self-employed farmer   
 with a wife and two children. He owns 
 120 acres of mixed farming about a    
 mile from Huntly. Mr. Shand gets up at
 7.15 a.m. approximately. The first job
 he does in the morning is to go round 
 his cattle. Then depending on the     
 season he will do the fencing, cutting
 hay, taking in turnips or ploughing.  
 The job he does not like doing is     
 book-keeping and his favourite job is 
 combining. Mr. Shand gets his dinner  
 at 12 o'clock until 1 O'clock in the  
 afternoon. Depending on the season,   
 he may do baling or combining. At     
 nights he works outside or does       
 book-keeping.                         
 He buys his cattle from the mart but  
 seldom sells any there. Mr. Shand has 
 most machinery needed for farming and 
 is successful in the farming business.
