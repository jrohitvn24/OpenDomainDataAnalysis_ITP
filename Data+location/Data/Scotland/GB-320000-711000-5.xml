		<title>05A Day in my Life</title>
		<content>   This morning when I got up I went   
 into the bathroom, washed my hands and
 face, got dressed and went downstairs.
 I had cornflakes and toast for my     
 breakfast. It was 7.39am. I sat for   
 half an hour watching TVAM. My        
 sister's goldfish died. Tracy was in  
 tears. My mum fed Leanne. I got to    
 give her a small drop of her bottle.  
 It was time to go to school. I went   
 for Margo. We went for Debbie.        
 Michelle Jack caught up with us. We   
 went into school. When the bell       
 rang,we went straight onto maths.     
 After that we did our Domesday        
 Project. After playtime we continued  
 until 11.40am. After that we did      
 geography work. At dinner time we all 
 went round to the dinner hut. There   
 was potatoes, haggis and turnip, and  
 jam sponge and custard for pudding. I 
 enjoyed my lunch.                     </content>
