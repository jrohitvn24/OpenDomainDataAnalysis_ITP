 We found a tree which held a squirrels
 drey.  It was a mass of twigs and     
 dried leaves which gave a lot of      
 camouflage.  Below the tree lay cones 
 with the seeds eaten by squirrels.    
 Later on we saw a hole that men dug   
 for a hideout.  After the scent of the
 men had gone foxes moved in and lived 
 in the hole.  When they left a family 
 of rabbits moved in.  We walked on    
 until we found some rabbit or chicken 
 bones.  They were beside three big    
 foxes dens.  The foxes could catch    
 rabbits deeper in the forest or steal 
 chickens from the nearby chicken farm.
{We felt out of place in the forest and
{felt like everything was watching us.
