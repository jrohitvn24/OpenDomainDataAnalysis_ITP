		<content> LIVING IN THE SKY IN EAST KILBRIDE    
   Would you like to live in a tower   
 block? We will describe to you what it
 is like.                              
   There are good security systems in  
 the blocks. You have to type the flat 
 number into a telecom system. If the  
 resident answers he can open the door 
 by pressing a button in his flat.     
   Most of the blocks in East Kilbride 
 have good rubbish disposal systems. A 
 person can put rubbish down a chute   
 and it will reach a store_room to     
 await collection.                     
   The blocks also have good drying    
 facilities. Washing lines are situated
 on the roof to make full use of the   
 wind.                                 
   Although residents do not have their
 own gardens, there are plenty of open 
 spaces and play areas nearby.         
   How does it sound to you?           </content>
