		<content>  In Dalmally we have a one man police 
 station, the officer in charge at the 
 moment is P.C. Fulton. He carries out 
 all the normal police duties within   
 the village and surrounding area. He  
 works closely with policemen in Oban  
 where there is a larger station.      
    The police station in Dalmally is  
 attached to the police house. It      
 consists of an office and one cell the
 officer has one Land Rover at his     
 disposal. In any village the policeman
 must be more involved with the        
 community than in the town. This      
 includes visits to the local school   
 which in this village are much enjoyed
 by the pupils.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
