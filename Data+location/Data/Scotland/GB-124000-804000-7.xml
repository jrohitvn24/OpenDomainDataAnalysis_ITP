 A total of 6,500 were bought at the   
 following sizes:                      
 1,ooo at 3 gms                        
 5,000 at 20gms                        
 500   at 40gms                        
 The idea behind the trial is that the 
 40gm oysters should be of marketable  
 size in November 1985, the 20gm ones a
 year later and the 3gm oysters a year 
 after that.So far in the trial this is
 proving to be correct.The oysters will
 trade at the same price as a first    
 class stamp (17p).                    
 The oysters are kept at approximately 
 100 to a "Netlon" plastic meshed bag  
 on larch trestles between Tobar na    
 Crubag and Rubha na Feannag and must  
 be graded at Spring tides which is the
 only time that the oysters are        
 exposed.                              </content>
