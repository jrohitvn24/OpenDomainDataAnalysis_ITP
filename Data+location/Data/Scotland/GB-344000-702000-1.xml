		<content>  {COLINSBURGH}is a small rural village
 situated on the A921 in the           
 region,sometimes called The Kingdom,  
 of Fife. It lies seven miles from     
 Anstruther and seven miles from Leven.
 There are uplands to the north of the 
 village while the land to the south   
 slopes three miles down to the Forth  
 Estuary.                              
   Basically the village is a long     
 straight street running east-west.    
 There are only three short streets    
 leading off.                          
   The houses all face the road.  With 
 one exception there are no front      
 gardens but the majority of the houses
 have superb large gardens to the rear.
