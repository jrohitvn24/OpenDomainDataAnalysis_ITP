		<title>19SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content>   In our survey we found the following
 predominant social concerns:-         
   1. Unemployment; this was the main  
 concern and with 28%, the local figure
 it is understandable.                 
   2. Vandalism   ; the senseless      
 breakage of public and private propery
 and the seemingly powerless position  
 of the Police was of great concern.   
   3. Lack of amenitites especially for
 the young. No suitable open space and 
 no variety of recreational provision  
 was mentioned. Perhaps also with the  
 government cutbacks there will be no  
 improvement in the situation as far as
 recreation is concerned.
