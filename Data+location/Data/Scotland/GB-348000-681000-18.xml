		<content> Dirleton School was built in 1912.It  
 has (in 1985) 37 pupils,a headteacher 
 and 2 full time members of staff.     
   In 1984 the school was on the verge 
 of closure which would have required  
 the children to go to Gullane School. 
 This incensed the local people who    
 fought to retain their village school 
 and were rewarded by it being kept    
 open for the foreseeable future.      
                                       
 The present Gullane School was opened 
 in 1978 and is open plan in design. In
 1985 the number of pupils was 154 ,   
 teaching staff 7, one of whom is the  
 headteacher-Mrs.P.Thomas.             
 As it is a community school facilities
 for public use include squash courts, 
 games hall and a committee room.      
 The building is surrounded by large   
 grassy playing fields.
