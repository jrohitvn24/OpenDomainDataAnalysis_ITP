		<title>19THE ORCADIAN DIALECT IN EDAY</title>
		<content>    The orcadian language is very      
 different from English, for example   
 instead of saying "mud" Orcadians     
 would say "gutter".                   
    The language is called Orcadian    
 meaning from the Orkney Islands and it
 probably originated from Old Norse    
 when the Vikings settled here.        
    Here are some other words commonly 
 used in Eday, written in Orcadian     
 first then in English.                
      Skeldo means oyster catcher      
      Whap means curlew                
      Peedie means small               
      Selkie means seal                
      Eday means island of eith or     
 isthmus                               
    Pronunciation is also rather       
 different, some examples are house is 
 hoos' and mouse is moos'. Perhaps     
 these words will be of help to        
 visitors to Orkney.                   </content>
