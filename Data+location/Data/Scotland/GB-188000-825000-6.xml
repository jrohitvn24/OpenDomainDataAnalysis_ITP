		<title>06SEA LIFE IN DORNIE</title>
		<content> The lochs have always been important  
 to Dornie.When Mr MacRae was young    
 there were ferries across Loch Long   
 and Loch Duich.These cost an old      
 penny.There used to be an anchorage   
 for tall ships but this was destroyed 
 when the bridge was built in 1936.The 
 boys enjoyed fishing,as well as       
 football,shinty and climbing the hills
 in Mr MacRae's youth.They did not use 
 fancy rods but simple bamboo poles.   
 There were plenty of fish and Mr      
 MacRae remembers once seeing in Loch  
 Hourn a shoal of herring which was 15m
 in depth.There were millions of fish. 
 The fish were much larger than they   
 are now and if you wanted a salmon to 
 eat it was easy to go and lift one out
 of the loch.
