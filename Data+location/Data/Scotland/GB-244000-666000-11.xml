		<title>11LIVING ON THE ESTATE</title>
		<content> I stay in Inchinnan Estate.With no    
 amenities here it's very boring.There 
 are no shops or post offices,and there
 is only a bus every hour which doesn't
 come after 5.30pm.If we go to any     
 parties or discos our parents have to 
 take and collect us from the place    
 we've been to.                        
    We have to travel to school in the 
 morning and back at night.This means  
 we have to get up early in the morning
 and get back late at night.In the     
 winter after school we don't get out  
 at night because when we get back from
 school it's very dark.                
    Our doctor is in Renfrew which     
 means he has to travel quite a        
 distance if we're ill.We haven't a car
 so if we've to go to the doctor it's  
 quite a lot of money for the bus      
 fares.
