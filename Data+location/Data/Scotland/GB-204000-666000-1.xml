		<content> The area is rural with a small village
 as its focal point. The upper reaches 
 of the hills are covered with gorse,  
 heather &amp; bracken, &amp; sheep graze there
 in the summer. The lush, green, lower 
 pastures are cultivated by nine       
 separate barns, only one of which     
 grows food crops. The rest are dairy  
 farms with their fields grassed for   
 grazing and hay gathering. There is no
 industry, except for a small fish farm
 &amp; an almost derelict boatyard, so most
 local residents have to work the farms
 shops, pubs, or travel further afield.
 Many are unemployed. The picturesque  
 village hugs the sea shore &amp; boasts an
 old stone quay. There is nothing to   
 attract tourists except the scenery &amp; 
 peaceful quietude; the few shops sell 
 only the basics &amp; there is only a     
 primary school nearby; buses pass     
 infrequently &amp; the locals are insular.</content>
