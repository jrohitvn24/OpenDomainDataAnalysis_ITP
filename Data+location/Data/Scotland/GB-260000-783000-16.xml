		<title>16FARMING - DEER</title>
		<content> The sports rifles weigh 12-14lbs and a
 telescope is used by the keeper as it 
 magnifies 50 times rather than        
 binoculars which are weaker. The shot 
 stags are cleaned out for the wild    
 animals and birds. They are dragged   
 out by hand and put on ponies with the
 antlers pointing along the ponies'    
 backs on special saddles. Sometimes   
 they transport the deer home by boat. 
 15th-20th September is the first coat 
 of snow on the hills.                 
 November. In November the keeper      
 shoots the poorer hinds of 8-9 stone  
 in weight. It is too risky to take    
 ponies in snowy weather so snow       
 machines and the Argo cats are used.  
 Each year 80 stags and 40 hinds are   
 shot.                                 
 This estate makes a big financial loss
 each year but is used as a tax loss to
 balance other business interests.     </content>
