		<title>17PLANTLIFE IN BURRA</title>
		<content> SOME OF THE MOST COMMON PLANTS IN     
 BURRA ARE DANDILIONS,DAISYS,BUTTER    
 CUPS AND BIRDS FOOT TREFOIL.MOST OF   
 THE PLANTS HERE IN BURRA ARE VERY     
 SMALL BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER AND THE  
 SHEEP EAT THEM BEFORE THEY COME TO ANY
 SIZE.THE BIGGEST COMMON PLANT IN BURRA
 I WOULD THINK IS THE WATER IRIS WHICH 
 GROWS IN MARSH LAND.THE BIRDS FOOT    
 TREFOIL IS SOMETIMES CALLED THE BANANA
 FLOWER BECAUSE THE PETALS LOOKS LIKE A
 BANANA.WILD THYME IS A VERY SMALL     
 PLANT WHICH GROWS CLOSE TO THE GROUND.
 IN SUMMER IT GROWS PINK FLOWERS.THE   
 THRIFT GROWS NEAR THE SEA AND IT IS   
 ALSO CALLED THE SEA PINK.IT IS A LIGHT
 PINK FLOWER AND IT IS MADE UP OF LOTS 
 OF TINY FLOWERS EACH WITH FOUR PETALS.
 LADYS SMOCK IS A PINK FLOWER ALSO     
 CALLED THE CUCKOO FLOWER.
