		<title>17THE CHICKEN FACTORY</title>
		<content> Mr Joseph Mitchell owns the "Chicken  
 Factory" in Letham which processes    
 chickens for{frozen}or{fresh}oven-    
 ready chickens.Started in 1920 this   
 family business has expanded until it 
 now processes{45,000}chickens each    
 week.Live chickens are brought in from
 as far as the Midlands of England and 
 processed chickens are transported to 
 the shops in Mitchell's own refriger- 
 ated lorries.                         
  Although almost fully{automated with 
{Dutch machinery}it employs 70 workers 
 who come from Letham,Arbroath and     
 Forfar.There are 3 hygiene inspectors 
 who inspect every chicken.{A British  
{computer}grades the chickens by       
 weight. The edible chicken livers are 
 separated from the other innards which
 are sent with the feathers to Elgin   
 for recycling into protein for cattle.
