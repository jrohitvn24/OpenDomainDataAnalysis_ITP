		<title>10Fishing At Bowden Springs</title>
		<content>  Bowden Springs Fishery, which is     
 situated in the Bathgate Hills between
 Linlithgow and Torphichen, has been   
 open between 2 and 3 years. The land  
 covers eleven acres, and the ponds are
 stocked twice a week with 200-1000    
 fish at a time. Any fisherman can fish
 here, for a fee, either for the       
 morning, a day or an evening. The     
 busiest time is from June-July. The   
 heaviest fish anybody has caught was  
 8lbs. When fishing the catch is       
 limited to 5 fish in winter and 4 in  
 summer.                               
  Over 2500 trees and shrubs have been 
 planted for shelter and to make the   
 place more attractive. Beech is the   
 most common with oak, ash, birch,     
 crabapple, willow, dogwood and alder  
 also being planted. Hedges of         
 hawthorn, blackthorn and dogrose have 
 also been put in.                     </content>
