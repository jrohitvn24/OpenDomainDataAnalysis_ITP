		<content> From birth the children are welcomed  
 into the community by baptism into the
 kirk and joining the Mothers  and     
 Toddlers Group. This consists of a    
 lively band of young mothers with     
 their babies and children up to three 
 years, meeting once a week in the     
 village hall.                         
                                       
 The children enjoy a variety of toys  
 and activities while their mothers    
 benefit from a change of surroundings 
 and the chance of coffee and a chat.  
                                       
 At three years of age the children    
 progress to Playgroup  and from there 
 to school.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
