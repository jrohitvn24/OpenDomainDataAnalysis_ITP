		<content> The cattle courts are very modern and 
 are half-brick construction finished  
 with walls of slatted plastic sheet,  
 in order to allow maximum ventilation.
 The cattle inside are automatically   
 fed with bruised barley and are given 
 a plentiful supply of straw. The      
 courts are ventilated by huge fans    
 driven by electricity which draw out  
 the air and keep it fresh and cool.   
 The farm is about five hundred and    
 fifty acres in size, two hundred anf  
 fifty to three hundred acres of       
 cereals are grown. There are fifty to 
 sixty acres of grazing pasture and    
 about two hundred acres which cover   
 rough grazing, woodland, farm roads, a
 loch of about ten acres and scrub     
 land.
