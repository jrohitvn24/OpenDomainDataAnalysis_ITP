		<content>       My dad works as an engineer at  
 McRaes.There are many different shifts
 you can work and they are, two o'clock
 in the afternoon until ten o'clock at 
 night or you can work six o'clock in  
 the evening until six o'clock the next
 morning.It goes on like that.My dad   
 works overnight and if anything goes  
 wrong in the factory like a mechanical
 fault in one of the machines he       
 repairs it. There is a place called   
 the cold store in the factory where   
 there are great big freezers which are
 on all the time.This helps keep the   
 fish fresh until they reach the place 
 where they are being sold.
