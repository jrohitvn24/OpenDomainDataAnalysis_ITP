		<title>08ANNAN BY PASS</title>
		<content> A public meeting was held in Annan to 
 discuss plans for a by pass.          
 We carried out a survey to discover   
 what the people of Annan thought about
 the proposed by pass.Our results show 
 that 86% of those surveyed were in    
 favour of the by pass.The main reason 
 given in favour was to take the heavy 
 traffic off the main street,which is  
 on the A75, and heavily used by       
 traffic going to and from the ferry at
 Stranraer.                            
 Surprisingly 75% of shopkeepers were  
 in favour of the by pass,though many  
 pointed out that they might lose      
 trade.                                
 At the public meeting objections were 
 raised by individual members of the   
 public.Mr Younger,the Scottish        
 Secretary,is expected to come to a    
 final decision by the end of the year 
 and work is expected to start in 1986.</content>
