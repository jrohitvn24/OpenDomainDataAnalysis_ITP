		<content> There has always been{Religion}at     
 Rescobie, whether at the old church at
 Balgavies or at the new church        
 overlooking the loch.  This church was
 built in 1820 and can hold 200 people.
 There are 90 church{Members. }The{    
{Minister}has a busy job for the church
 has been linked with Aberlemno and    
 Guthrie since 1983.  The services are 
 on a rota - they may be at 10.30 a.m.,
 12 noon or in the evening. There is   
 great difficulty in finding{Finance}to
 repair the church and the minister at 
 Rescobie believes that if something   
 disastrous was to happen, the church  
 would be closed down.  In order for   
 Rescobie church and others like it to 
 survive, more younger people are      
 needed to replace the older ones when 
 they can no longer work for the       
 church.
