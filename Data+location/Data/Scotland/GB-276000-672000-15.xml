		<content> THEY WERE DESIGNED BY THE ARCHITECTS  
 WHO WORKED IN CUMBERNAULD HOUSE AT    
 THAT TIME. WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS   
 CHEAPER IN THOSE DAYS TO BUILD HOUSES 
 WITH FLAT ROOFS. SOME OF THE ROWS OF  
 HOUSES WERE STAGGERED THEY HAD TO BE  
 BUILT THIS WAY BECAUSE OF THE HILLY   
 GROUND UNDERNEATH AND BECAUSE IT MADE 
 THEM LOOK MORE INTERESTING. WE WERE   
 SHOWN A MODEL OF HOW THE HIGH FLATS IN
 MILLCROFT WILL LOOK WHEN THEY ARE     
 RENOVATED IN A FEW YEARS TIME. THEY   
 ARE BEING RENOVATED BECAUSE THE       
 HEATING SYSTEM IN THE FLATS IS NOT    
 GOOD AND WATER LEAKS THROUGH THE ROOF.
 BEFORE THE RENOVATION WORK WAS PLANNED
 THE RESIDENTS WERE SURVEYED TO ASK    
 WHAT CHANGES COULD BE MADE TO IMPROVE 
 THE AREA WHERE THEY LIVE.
