		<title>19CHINESE PREMIER  LIVINGSTON</title>
		<content> On Wednesday, 5th June 1985,{Zhao     
{Ziyang, premier of the Chinese Peoples
{Republic,}visited Ferranti            
 Infographics on Brucefield Industrial 
 Estate. Ferranti makes computer       
 software. Last year our Prime Minister
 ,Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, visited China
 and presented Mr. Zhao with a word    
 processor in Chinese, which had been  
 made by Ferranti. This is the first   
 time a Chinese premier has visited    
 Scotland and British industrialists   
 are hoping to have more trading links 
 with China. Bellsquarry School went to
 see him. The Union Jack and the       
 Chinese flag were flying and a        
 policeman told us we could stand      
 closer to get a better view. Mr. Zhao 
 arrived with an escort of 16 police   
 motor cyclists, 2 white Rovers and 3  
 black Jaguars. We cheered loudly. He  
 turned round and waved to us.         </content>
