 including one sub-officer and one     
 leading fireman,are employed on a part
 time basis for which they are paid an 
 annual sum of money.The station has   
 one water tender-ladder-fire appliance
 which carries four hundred gallons of 
 water.                                
   As they are part-time,the firemen   
 have pocket bleepers through which    
 they can be contacted when they are   
 required.                             
   On average they fight about one     
 hundred fires per year.Most fires in  
 the home are caused by chip-pans or   
 chimney fires.Many fires are caused by
 carelessness.e.g. faulty electrical   
 appliances or carelessly discarded    
 smoking materials.                    
   Some of the most dangerous fires are
 those ininvolving chemicals or gas,   
 when firemen use foam or dry powder.  </content>
