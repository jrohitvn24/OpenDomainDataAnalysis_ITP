		<title>02Arts and Crafts in Alford</title>
		<content> Craft-type hobbies have always been   
 popular,nurtured partly by the        
 Scottish Women's Rural Institute's    
 policy of encouraging these skills.   
 Alford Academy houses evening classes 
 in fly-tying,upholstery and crafts.The
 opening of The Hobby Shop and studio  
 in Alford this summer was an exciting 
 event solving shopping problems and   
 providing an opportunity to try out   
 new crafts.Day and evening classes and
 day schools are held there in basic   
 drawing and painting, lace-making,    
 canvas embroidery, china painting,    
 weaving, spinning and so on. The      
 Domesday project has led to a group of
 women and children making an Alford   
 Tapestry each making a 6" square      
 depicting life on Donside. This will  
 be assembled and hung in the I.T.     
 Centre.
