		<content> The Priestfield Maltings{is a major   
{landmark of Pitlessie}village.The     
 buiding stands as a reminder of a once
 thriving industry ,beginning in the   
 late 18th century, unfortunately now  
 stopped.                              
 At one time they employed only        
 fourteen men and produced well over   
 2.000 tons of{Malt}anually.This malt  
 was sent all over the world it was    
 even sent to North Africa and Iceland.
 During the war the plain Malt was sent
 to soldiers so that beer could be     
 made from it.Also during the war there
 was a great demand for{malt extract   
 resulting from the shortage of sugar. 
 The Maltings therefore was a very use 
 -ful industry for a number of years   
 especially during the war years.All   
 that remains is a{derelict building   
 with a for sale sign.
