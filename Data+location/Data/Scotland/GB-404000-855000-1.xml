 coastline with sand dunes rising to   
 7m. Agriculturally poor, supporting   
 six farms. Crops are wheat, rape,     
 potatoes and swedes. The cattle,      
 Aberdeen Angus feeding on poor        
 grassland. In parts the topsoil is    
 only 1m.                              
 Europes largest gas terminal is here. 
 Shell Expro take natural gas liquids  
 via undersea pipelines from North Sea 
 fields. After processing, send the    
 liquids by pipeline South to          
 Mossmorran. Gas is supplied to British
 Gas Corporation to supply the national

 complex were "travelling men" from the
 industrial belts of the South.        </content>
