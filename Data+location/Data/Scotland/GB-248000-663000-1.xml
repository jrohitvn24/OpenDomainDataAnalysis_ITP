 The impression gained of the block is 
 that it consists of housing           
 interspersed with light industry e.g  
 Hillington Industrial Estate (5286).  
 A notable feature is that in the      
 middle of this is arable farm land in 
 Arkleston broken only by the inclusion
 of the cemetery and further south by  
 Barshaw Park and Golf Course. These   
 are just two of several open spaces.  
                                       
 The block offers a variety of housing 
 types, shopping, education and recrea-
 tion facilities to the inhabitants,   
 locally known as Paisley Buddies.  A  
 sample of life as it is in l986 is    
 contained in the following pages.
