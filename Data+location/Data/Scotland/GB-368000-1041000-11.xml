		<title>11ROAD REPAIRS</title>
		<content> The island's road repairs are carried 
 out by two full-time{O.I.C}workers    
 augmented by one or two others during 
 the spring and summer. Their{H.Q.}is  
 at{Marston Quarry}which is about 1000m
 north of the council houses.          
                                       
 In summer they{spray the road}with    
 "tar and chips", which are imported,  
 to preserve the surfaces of the island
 roads. When the roads are re-surfaced 
 the tar-macadam is imported ready made
 and a special machine is sent from    
 Kirkwall, along with operators, to do 
 the spraying. The local permanent     
 staff are responsible for{snow        
{clearing}in winter. These workers also
{collect refuse}once per fortnight. The
 refuse is dumped in a quarry at       
 Dalkeith, where all combustible       
 rubbish is burnt.
