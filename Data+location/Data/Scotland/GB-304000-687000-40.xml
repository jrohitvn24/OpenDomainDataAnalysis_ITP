<title>40Playground Games</title>
<content>

We conducted a survey about playground games. We asked every pupil which games they played most in the playground. We received suggestions like ‘Duck Duck Goose’, ‘Walk and Talk’, ‘Football’, ‘Horses’, ‘Zombie tag’,  and playing on the new Trim Trail. However ‘Build Up’ received the most votes with 26 votes, ‘Hide and Seek’ or ‘Hide and Seek Tig’ got 11 votes.  ‘Tig’ also received 12 votes. There now seems to be a lot of new games around since staff and our parents were our age.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
