		<title>01Surrounds of Preston Village</title>
		<content> This area lies on the South Eastern   
 slopes of the Lammermuir Hills and is 
 dissected by the Whiteadder Water -   
 well known to trout fishermen.  The   
 country is divided into two types of  
 farming - cultivated crops on the     
 lower ground to the South with hill   
 pasture accommodating sheep to the    
 North.  Fields, valleys and grazing   
 lands are pleasantly dotted with      
 stands of trees mostly deciduous      
 trees, although there are more recent 
 plantings of conifers.  Preston is the
 only village in the area - small      
 farming community with no shops.      
 Nearby is Cockburn Mill, now a private
 house, but still retains the old      
 wooden mill machinery driven by water 
 power.  This area is overlooked from  
 the NW by Cockburn Law. 1066ft on     
 which are the remains of an earthwork 
 fortification of prehistoric times.   </content>
