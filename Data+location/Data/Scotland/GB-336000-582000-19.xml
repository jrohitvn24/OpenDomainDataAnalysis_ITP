		<title>19LANGHOLM_BY A YOUNG PERSON</title>
		<content>{LANGHOLM}IS LIKE ONE BIG FAMILY.PEOPLE
 KNOW YOU GO TO THE PRIMARY SCHOOL AND 
 THEY CARE ABOUT YOU.OUR PARENTS TREAT 
 US VERY WELL.EVERYONE SAYS,"HELLO",IN 
 THE STREET.IT'S QUITE SAFE EVEN AT    
 NIGHT.I WOULD NOT LIKE TO LIVE        
 ANYWHERE ELSE.THERE'S PLENTY TO DO    
 HERE.IT'S QUITE {OLD FASHIONED}.IT'S  
 NICE TO GO SHOPPING,HAND IN THE       
 LIST(LINE)AND LATER A BOY DELIVERS THE
 GROCERIES ON AN OLD BIKE WITH NO      
 GEARS.I THINK THE FUTURE LOOKS GOOD   
 FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.THERE ARE ENOUGH JOBS
 NOT LIKE IN OTHER PLACES.I WANT TO BE 
 A JOINER LIKE MY GRANDFATHER.A LOT OF 
 PARENTS AND TEACHERS ARE QUITE        
 CONCERNED ABOUT OUR {SECONDARY SCHOOL 
 BECAUSE {NUMBERS ARE FALLING}AND      
 SMALLER SCHOOLS ARE HARDER TO         
 RUN.DESPITE ALL THIS, IT IS A GREAT   
 PLACE TO LIVE.
