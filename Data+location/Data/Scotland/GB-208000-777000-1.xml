		<title>01 Meall Bhanabhie: Overview</title>
		<content>      The area being surveyed here     
 consists wholly the southerly slopes  
 of the hill,{Meall Bhanabhie}known    
 locally as Banavie hill or, at the    
 westerly extent of the survey area -  
 Corpach hill.                         
                                       
      More than half the hillside is of
 open heather and coarse grass slopes, 
 seldom grazed by domestic animals and 
 as rarely visited by the human animal.
      Somewhat less than half the      
 hillside has been developed as        
 forestry and is planted with          
 coniferous woodland.                  
      Along the southern edge of the   
 survey area there is some housing, and
 further areas of interest are provided
 by Banavie Quarry and the Caledonian  
 Canal, both of which are to be found  
 in the south-east most part of the    
 survey area.                          </content>
