		<content>   Nearly half the area is covered in  
 farmland, mainly grassland with a few 
 fields of arable. The higher grassland
 is usually permanent grass for        
 grazing. Rotation grass is used for   
 hay and silage. The crops are mainly  
 barley, some turnips and potatoes.    
 Most farms keep cattle, some dairy,   
 some beef.                            
   The Royal Ordnance Factory covers   
 about 4.5 sq km in our area which used
 to be farmland. Nearly 0.5 sq km of   
 farmland has been lost to housing     
 estates and the M8 in the last 15     
 years.                                
   In addition to the farmland,around  
 1 sq km is covered in woodland and    
 wood plantations, mostly mixed        
 decidious and coniferous trees with   
 some gorse.
