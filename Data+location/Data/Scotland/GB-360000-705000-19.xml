		<content> Crail Sunday School Trip.             
 One fine Saturday in June, 8 tractors 
 with decorated trailers arrive in the 
 Marketgate and the excited children   
 climb aboard. The best decorated      
 tractor gets the rosette and the      
 driver gets sweets. Trailing streamers
 and balloons we set off. 30 mins.     
 takes us to th field kindly lent by   
 the farmer and we climb down the      
 ladders and unload bales of hay for   
 seats. The young folk play football   
 and rounders until the ice-cream van  
 arrives, then more games till tea     
 time, 200 children and adults eat     
 crisps, juice, sandwiches &amp; biscuits, 
 tea for adults. After tea races are   
 held with some for the mums and dads, 
 and the tug-of-war. After we clear up 
 the litter and give three cheers it's 
 time for home.                        
                                       </content>
