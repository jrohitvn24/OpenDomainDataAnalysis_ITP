		<title>14THE VILLAGE SHOP SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>                                       
   There is only one shop in our block.
 It is a small shop in the village. Mrs
 Sherry owns it and uses it as a house 
 as well as a shop. It is 100 years old
 and Mrs Sherry has been running it for
 25 years.                             
                                       
                                       
   On Pension day which is Thursday the
 shop has 60 customers because it is   
 also a Post Office. The shop also     
 sells petrol.                         
                                       
                                       
   The children love Wham bars and in  
 the summer they buy Mr Freezes. The   
 shop sells some newspapers but most of
 them are ordered.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
