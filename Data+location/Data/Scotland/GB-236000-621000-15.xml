		<title>15  TEE UP AT DALMILLING!</title>
		<content>  Provision of suitable leisure and    
 recreational activities is a necessity
 in to-day's world of ever increasing  
 numbers of unemployed people and of   
 those with short working hours.Despite
 its lack of amenities,Dalmilling does 
 have a{golf course,}which,in a manner 
 of speaking,grew with the community.  
  In 1959 a nine hole golf course was  
 developed in a suitable,large area of 
 land,previously used for grazing.After
 landscaping,by adding attractive      
 features,such as hills and trees to   
 make the piece of ground into a course
 of interest and challenge,the planners
 and groundsmen succeeded in forming a 
 fine little golf course, attracting   
 many local golfers.By 1966,the course 
 was extended to a full eighteen hole  
 course.
