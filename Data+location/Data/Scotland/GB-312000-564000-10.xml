		<title>10LOCAL  HISTORY  II</title>
		<content>  We can imagine the scene on a warm   
 summer's evening as we hear the birds 
 chirping,smell the perfumed roses     
 hanging over the garden walls, hear   
 the clattering of clogs along the     
 street, and see the old people sitting
 chatting on benches beside the road.  
   When people of Powfoot wanted to go 
 to church,as there is no church in    
 Powfoot,they crossed the hills to get 
 to Cummertrees,and these hills are now
 called the 'Church Walk'.It is still  
 used as a path,but not to go to church
 Nowadays people come to church in     
 cars.The church has an unusual 'Lych  
 Gate.' On it there is an inscription  
 Which says                            
    "This Gate is a tribute to all     
    those of this parish who served    
           in the World Wars           
          1914-1919,1939-1945".
