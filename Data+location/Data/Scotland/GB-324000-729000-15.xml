		<content> Ballindean House is a large Georgian  
 house at the foot of the southern     
 slopes of the braes of the Carse of   
 Gowrie.It has lovely grounds with     
 mature trees that make the grounds    
 exciting to play in.There is an       
 artificial lake 400 metres in front of
 the house.For many years a doctor from
 Dundee lived in the house and it was  
 known as Surgeon Campbell's House.It  
 was empty for 16 years.In 1984 a      
 Christian Trust bought it.It is now   
 being repaired and will become a young
 persons activity camp,called Teen     
 Ranch.By 1985 six rooms had been fixed
 they had to strip the plaster,rewire, 
 paint and tidy up the grounds.It is to
 be partly opened in the summer of 1985
 By 1986 they hope there will be       
 activities like Rugby,Canoeing,Table  
 Tennis,Volley ball,Netball and Bible  
 study.                                </content>
