 Blacklaw Farm was owned by Mrs.Jean   
 Cameron a long time before it became a
 school.Mrs.Cameron was a supporter of 
 Bonnie Prince Charlie.She came from a 
 place in Invernesshire,called         
 Glen Dessary.In her will it was said  
 that she wanted to be buried in her   
 homeland.Instead she was buried in a  
 corner of her estate in East Kilbride 
 now known as Glen Dessary.The house   
 where Jean Cameron lived was called   
 Blacklaw House.It was demolished in   
 1958.There is a public house in the   
 area called"THE BONNIE PRINCE CHARLIE"
 It is called that because of the      
 relationship with the Jacobites.On our
 school badge is a black triangle to   
 represent a blacklaw.A"blacklaw"is a  
 small hill or ridge.There is also a   
 Jacobite cockade resting on the       
 St.Andrew's Flag.                     </content>
