		<content>{We interviewed a retired farmer and   
{his wife.                             
{ }Forty years ago it took 8 workers 3 
 weeks to clear the fields.Crops were  
 cut with a binder and the stooks      
 carted away and stacked.The travelling
 threshing mill went round farms all   
 winter.Nowadays the same work could be
 done in 2 days.Today one man can milk 
 100 cows in about 2 hours.It used to  
 take the dairyman over 2 hours to milk
 30 cows.The farmer sold the milk      
 himself around Cortachy,Kirriemuir and
 Forfar.                               
   At this time the dairyman, assisted 
 by his wife, earned Â£8 a week(Â£100).  
 His house,milk and potatoes were free.
 Milk was 1.5p a pint(24p),coal 25p a  
 cwt.(Â£5),gent's suit Â£2.50(Â£80) and a 
 pair of shoes 62.5p(Â£20).
