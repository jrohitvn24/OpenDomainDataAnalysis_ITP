		<title>13Games We Play In Newburgh</title>
		<content> The games we play at home are a lot   
 different from the games we play at   
 school.The most popular game at school
 is High's Dell and at home it is      
 British Bulldogs or Join the Crew.For 
 this  you need people and some open   
 space with no obstacles, whereas for  
 High's Dell,an open space and some    
 objects that are up high are needed.  
 To play High's Dell you need an open  
 space.The school playground or your   
 garden is the best place.You need more
 than 2 to play. You have someone who  
 is"man" and is trying to tig you or   
 get you. Anything high is dell or a   
 safe place from him.If"man" gets you  
 you become"man" and you have to chase 
 everyone in the game.To play British  
 Bulldogs or Join the Crew you need    
 more than 3 people and 1"man".You     
 decide if it is going to be lift them 
 or teen them.If caught you are"man."  </content>
