		<title>13Linlithgow Golf Club</title>
		<content>   Linlithgow Golf Club was opened in  
 1913 and at present has 404 senior    
 male,100 junior and 55 female members.
   Joining fees vary from senior male  
 who pay Â£150 to juniors who pay only  
 Â£30.Membership fees at present are    
 Â£105 for male,Â£21 for junior and Â£50  
 for female.There are also special     
 rates for senior citizens.            
   Like most golf clubs, Linlithgow has
 a problem with vandalism.There have   
 been frequent break-ins,the target    
 being the gambling machine,which can  
 hold a considerable amount of money.  
   An annual event in which all members
 can compete is the Courier Trophy     
 competition.                          
   The club employs only 5 people,four 
 of whom are green staff,the other     
 being the club steward.
