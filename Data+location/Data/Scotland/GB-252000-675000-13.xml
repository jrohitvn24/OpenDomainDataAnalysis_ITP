		<title>13MUGDOCK WOODS</title>
		<content> Mugdock Woods is part of the Country  
 Park.On the afternoon I visited them  
 it was hot and the woods were         
 beautiful and cool.I went along by the
 River Allander and there were two     
 kinds of trees,oak and birch.They were
 just budding.We listened and we heard 
 different things.There was the noise  
 of the water and the birds singing    
 sweetly and the bumble bees buzzing   
 around our heads.                     
    The paths went up and down.We sat  
 among the sweet smelling bluebells.It 
 looked as though there was carpet     
 after carpet of them.There was a golf 
 course opposite us .It was a hot day  
 and we enjoyed the scenery very       
 much.Mugdock woods is a lovely place  
 to be.
