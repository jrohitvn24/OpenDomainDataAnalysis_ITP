		<title>11BEEKEEPING - DOLPHINTON</title>
		<content> Beekeeping depends on weather, "Flora"
 modern herbicides destroy many of th  
 sources of nectar, eg. willowherb and 
 agricultural insecticides kill the    
 bees themselves. We no longer have hay
 meadows abounding in white clover,    
 since intensive silage making has     
 taken over. Dolphinton, a well shelted
 basin of cylindrical shape, is        
 protected to South by wooded South    
 Hill, to North by Black Mount and     
 White Hill, rather open to East and   
 cold east "haar", and unprotecred from
 the wet West. However, previous       
 Mackenzies, the Lairds, planned the   
 Estate well by planting many trees for
 shelter, including sycamore and lime, 
 favourites of the honeybee (Apis      
 mellifora) as well as conifers. August
 is main time for bees to work on our  
 beautiful purple hill, covered in ling
 heather (calluna) to produce honey.   </content>
