		<content> sixes.We have Imps,Kelpies,Pixes and  
 Elves each six has a Sixer and a      
 Seconder.We begin our meetings by     
 telling the good deeds we have done   
 that week then we are inspected and   
 work for badges at the end of the meet
 ing we sing Brownie Bells.            
             {GUIDES                   
 Guides meet every Monday night.There  
 are 35 guides in the company.We       
 usually start working in our patrols  
 at about 7.15pm.Each patrol can choose
 what they want to do for the first    
 hour.We learn different kinds of knots
 and how to pitch tents.The average    
 number of people in one patrol is     
 seven .At the end of our meeting      
 somebody reads a prayer,then we all   
 join in the singing of "Taps".When we 
 have cleaned up all our mess,it is    
 about 9.00pm this is when our meeting 
 ends.                                 </content>
