		<content> Glenconon is a hanging valley, scooped
 out by a glacier in the ice age.  The 
 mountains all round are are except for
 heather and fir plantations.  The rock
 is basalt.  The numerous tributaries  
 of the river conon form spectaculer   
 waterfalls and in the Fairy Glen round
 Castle Ewen there are said to be 365  
 hills and hummocks made from glacial  
 moraine.  The crofts of about 20 acres
 slope down both sides of the glen in  
 strrips.  Sheep and cattle graze on   
 the fields.  The men work as crofters 
 growing hay, corn potatoes and        
 turnipss.  they keep cow, shep        
 chickens and collie dogs.  the        
 crofters stack their hay in stooks and
 they make peat stacks for their fuel. 
 there is pony trecking up the glen    
 from Uig hotel.
