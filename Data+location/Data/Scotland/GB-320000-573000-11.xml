		<title>11Eaglesfield Bantam Show</title>
		<content>  The bantam show held annually in the 
 village is the continuation of a 21   
 year old{custom,}previous to that     
 there was a show in Lockerbie. People,
 mostly men bring their pedigree       
 bantams, poultry and pigeons to be    
 judged. This year there were 66       
 classes for varieties of{poultry}and  
 bantams and another ten for pigeons,  
 including the only classes for fancy  
 pigeons in this Region.               
  In the past when nearly every        
 household kept poultry in the back    
 yard it was mainly local people who   
 showed. Now people come from as far   
 away as Girvan and Kelso. They belong 
 to their local poultry{clubs}and get  
{entertainment}from trying to breed and
 show a champion bird. For some years  
 interest waned as cost of feedstuff   
 increased, but now more young lads are
 becoming involved.                    </content>
