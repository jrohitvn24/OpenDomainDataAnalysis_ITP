		<content> This rural area of North-east Fife    
 has wind-swept picturesque,           
 undulating scenery of mainly arable   
 land freely dotted with mixed woodland
 and rough hill-tops.Between the low   
 hills runs the Motray Water and its   
 many small tributaries The area is cut
 in half by the very busy A914 road    
 which connects Dundee and Kirkcaldy   
 and closely follows the line of the   
 burn. The main habitations are the    
 tiny hamlets of Kilmany and Rathillet,
 both of which lie just on the south   
 side of the main road,and the few     
 farms scattered throughout the        
 district.
