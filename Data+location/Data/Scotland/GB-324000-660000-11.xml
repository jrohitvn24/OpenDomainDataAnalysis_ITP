		<title>11BEESLACK HOUSE AND GROUNDS</title>
		<content> The lands at Beeslack, where the new  
 Beeslack High School has been built,  
 were originally acquired by the Cowan 
 family who had a long connection with 
 Penicuik, especially with the paper   
 making industry. In the grounds there 
 is a marble statue "Italian Dancing   
 Girl" by John Hutchison R.S.A. In the 
 nursery is a frieze depicting         
 Joseph's life by the  german artist   
 Muller.  The farm buildings occupied  
 the present site of the stables       
 complex.                              
         The last occupant of Beeslack,
 Miss Elizabeth Emington, now living at
 Elie in Fife says the name Beeslack   
 was derived from "Bees" Lurk"         
 and for many years honey bees thrived 
 at Beeslack than in many other areas  
 of the country. Beeslack House, now   
 belonging to Lothian Regional Council,
 has lain empty for several years.     </content>
