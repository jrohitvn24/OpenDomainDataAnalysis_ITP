		<content> There are many large hills in the area
 rising over and above 1000 feet.      
 There is a steep slope towards the    
 sea.  The slopes were wooded with     
 coniferous trees.  These have been    
 felled in the last few years by the   
 forestery commission who planred them.
 The Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh     
 railway line hugs the shore, with the 
 road running parallel to it, except ot
 the south of Ardnaff, where it climbs 
 through a wooded area which has a     
 gradient of one in five.
