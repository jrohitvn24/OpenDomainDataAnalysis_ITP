		<title>10PEAT CUTTING IN EDDERTON</title>
		<content> You go{peat cutting}on a heather moor 
 near water which makes the soil wet.  
  Firstly you{skim}the heather off     
 the top which is considered to be the 
 toughest job.You begin to cut out the 
 peat with a{tusker.}You cut your peat 
 where the soil is damp other wise the 
 peat will crumble.Once you have cut   
 the peats you throw them on to the    
 bank and then{stack}them.Then you     
 leave the peat stacks for a few days  
 to dry slightly in the wind.After they
 have dried for a while you take them  
 home and stack them like a wall beside
 the house.The best time to go peat    
 cutting is around May and June and you
 take them home in July or August.You  
 are not meant to burn them for a year 
 as they will not have dried           
 thoroughly.You can then burn them.
