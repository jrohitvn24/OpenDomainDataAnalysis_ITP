		<title>19POWFOOT GOLF COURSE I</title>
		<content>  Powfoot  Golf Course is an important 
 place,as it is the only one in the    
 area,and lots of people go there.     
  The date when the golf course was    
 built was in 19O3,it opened on the    
 27 June.The first general meeting was 
 on 20 February.The land was owned by  
 Edward Brook.The course originally had
 9 holes and was eventually increased  
 in  1911 to 18 holes.During the first 
 and second world wars,however,5  holes
 were cultivated,thus reducing the     
 course to 13 holes. It was restored in
 1949.                                 
  In 1953,when the club celebrated its 
 jubilee,they had a  most interesting  
 Exhibition Match between two of the   
 best  known Scottish  Amateur         
 Internationalists of that time.       
  There is a tower for you to go up,and
 look  for your golf balls.
