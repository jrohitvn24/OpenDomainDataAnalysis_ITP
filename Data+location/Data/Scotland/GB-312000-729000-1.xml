		<content> The village of Guildtown is situated 6
 miles north of Perth on the A93. It is
 in the most northerly and second from 
 the left section of our Domesday map  
 reference. It is the only part of our 
 area which can be said to be in any   
 way a centre of population. About 260 
 people live in Guildtown - but about  
 60% of the pupils of our school do not
 live there at all. They live to the   
 north of our designated Project area  
 in and around the village of Wolfhill 
 and in isolated farms and cottages.   
 Guildtown has a Sub-post Office, one  
 telephone box, one post box, a garage,
 and an Inn as well as the Village     
 Hall, houses and the School.          
 All around are woods and fields of    
 raspberries, barley, wheat, peas and  
 oil-seed rape.
