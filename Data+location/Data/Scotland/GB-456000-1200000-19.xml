		<title>19Uyeasound Hanseatic Booth.</title>
		<content> The Hanseatic Booth is near the pier  
 in the Westside of Uyeasound.4 men are
 doing full-time Community Council work
 on this building.They have 6 months to
 make it safe.They need to make it safe
 because it could fall onto someone at 
 any minute.They are knocking it down  
 and then rebuilding it.It will not    
 have a roof at this time,that will    
 perhaps come when more money is       
 available.                            
   This booth played a big part in     
 Unst's history.In the 16th Century,   
 between May and August,vessels came   
 from Germany and at the booth         
 displayed goods for sale or           
 barter.They had luxuries to which the 
 islanders had no other access.To pay  
 for these things the people caught    
 herring which the Hansa merchants had 
 split,dried and salted before shipment
 back to Germany.                      </content>
