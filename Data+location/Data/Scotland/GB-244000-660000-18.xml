		<title>18SOIL AND WATER</title>
		<content> We carried out an acidity test on the 
 soil in our area. We found that on    
 Gleniffer Braes at the southern end of
 the country park the acidity is quite 
 high (ph5), at the Stanely water      
 treatment works on the lower slopes to
 the north the soil registers ph6.5 and
 at the very foot of the Braes the ph  
 is 7. This indicates that the soil is 
 more acidic the higher up you go and  
 has less potential.                   
 Tests were carried out on the water   
 quality of Glen Burn.We took water    
 from the burn in the Glen Park. It    
 appeared clean and smelled fresh. It  
 had a ph value of 6. Another sample   
 was taken downstream at Donaldswood.  
 This water although it appeared quite 
 clean had a ph of 5 indicating more   
 acidity.
