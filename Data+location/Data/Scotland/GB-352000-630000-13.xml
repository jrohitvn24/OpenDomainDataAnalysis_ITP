		<title>13BOWDEN VILLAGE (cont.)</title>
		<content> There are more old than new houses in 
 the village,the proportion being      
 roughly 2 to 1.                       
 The village hall is used quite        
 extensively by various groups and     
 clubs e.g. Womens Guild,the SWRI,a    
 Mothers and Toddlers group,Country    
 Dancing and Keep Fit classes.         
 Since there is no employment in the   
 village,workers have to commute to the
 nearby towns such as Newtown where the
 Borders Regional Council has its      
 headquarters.                         
 Apart from the clubs and groups, there
 are no other forms of entertainment   
 and those wishing to visit            
 restaurants,hotels,cinemas,theatres or
 nightclubs must travel to the larger  
 towns.
