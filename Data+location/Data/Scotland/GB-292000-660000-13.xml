      Beds  or  peevers   are   another
 favourite.{Aeroplane}beds  are  played
 by drawing  with  chalk on the ground,
 a semicircle for the den , followed by
 two squares 1+2 above each other , 3+4
 are drawn  above these  jutting out to
 the  side  like  the   wings  of  an  
 aeroplane,5 is above these two,6+7 are
 drawn as wings and 8+9 are  above each
 other. A flat stone or small tin box ,
 weighted,are used.You stand on one leg
 and with the edge ofthe other foot you
 nudge the  'peever'from one box to the
 other in sequence.You cannot put  your
 foot down until you reach the end.    
      There  are  many  other   outdoor
 games such as tig and hide and go seek
 ,kick doors and run fast , etc. Indoor
 games  are many such as cluedo ,ludo ,
 snakes and ladders,chess,draughts.
