		<content> Our local paper is the Currie and     
 Balerno News. It covers the news in   
 Currie, Balerno, Juniper Green and    
 Baberton. It employs twelve workers,  
 who work three times a month to       
 produce twelve pages of articles plus 
 four pages of advertising. No one in  
 the paper works full time and nobody  
 actually owns it, as it is a community
 paper. It now costs 15p to buy and    
 is printed in black ink with coloured 
 headings. The paper has been in       
 existence for ten years now and gets  
 most of its money from advertising,   
 since it costs hundreds of pounds to  
 produce. The paper has to be careful  
 what it prints, incase people sue     
 them. The paper is produced from home,
 although use is made of the           
 Heriot-Watt University as well.       
 The circulation figures for the paper 
 exceed 2500 copies per month.         </content>
