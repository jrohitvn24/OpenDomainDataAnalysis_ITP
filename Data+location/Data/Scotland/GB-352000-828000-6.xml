		<title>06Kennethmont:  Transport</title>
		<content> Kennethmont is on the railway line    
 between Inverness and Aberdeen but the
 trains no longer stop here.The main   
 road is the B9002 which runs through  
 the middle of the village,there are   
 numerous minor roads which criss-cross
 the area.Most people have a car, but  
 petrol is expensive here and vehicle  
 maintenance costs are high.There is   
 still a bus service but the buses are 
 infrequent and as a result the service
 is under-used. Road maintenance is    
 generally very good but some of the   
 minor roads suffer occasionally from  
 lack of attention, the main complaint 
 being that roadside ditches are seldom
 cleaned out. During the Winter the    
 main road is usually kept open in all 
 but the most severe conditions,       
 although there are usually complaints 
 about the minor roads which are all   
 too often left blocked.               </content>
