		<title>12DUDHOPE CASTLE, DUNDEE</title>
		<content>  {Dudhope Castle}was the home of the  
 Scrymgeour family who lived there from
 the 14th century. They were the       
 hereditary Constables of Dundee.      
   By the 17th century, the castle was 
 owned by the Graham family, the most  
 famous of whom was{John Graham of     
{Claverhouse,}better known as{Bonnie   
{Dundee,}who was very popular with the 
 people of Dundee. He was a staunch    
 Roman Catholic and supported James VII
 against William of Orange. His death  
 at{The Battle of Killiecrankie}ended  
 Jacobite hopes in Scotland.           
   After World War II, a small zoo was 
 started;  it was soon moved to bigger 
 grounds in Camperdown Park, where it  
 is still open to the public today.    
  {Daniel Defoe}thought it a{"noble and
{ancient pile"}over 250 years ago:now  
 used as a storehouse, there is a      
 proposal to restore and floodlight it.</content>
