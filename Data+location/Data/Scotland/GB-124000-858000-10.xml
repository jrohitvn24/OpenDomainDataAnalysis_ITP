		<content> Many of our local place names are     
 derived from Gaidhlig or Norse. This  
 area was occupied by the Vikings.     
 Waternish-Bhatairnis(Gaidhlig) means  
 the headland jutting out into the     
 sea. Gaidhlig(Gaelic)is spoken by all 
 but the present generation of locals. 
 However,most of the youngsters have a 
 fair knowledge and understanding of   
 the language. Until recently, when    
 children first came to school they    
 spoke only Gaidhlig; picking English  
 up as they went along. This was of    
 course very necessary as all teaching 
 was conducted in English. Nowadays,   
 however, a very definate effort is    
 being made through the Bi-lingual unit
 to regenerate Gaidhlig in the         
 community, through the schools. .All  
 in-coming children learn Gaidhlig.
