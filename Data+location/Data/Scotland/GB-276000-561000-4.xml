		<content> The most popular reason for coming to 
 Castle Douglas was for shopping.      
 People said that they liked the town  
 as people were friendly and the       
 countryside around was lovely. We     
 asked if it needed any improvements   
 and some people said it needed a few  
 more shops. Most said it needed a     
 better swimming pool. Some said it    
 would be better if it had a leisure   
 centre or something like that.  Quite 
 a few people said it was very tidy and
 had hardly any litter. One family we  
 asked said they were staying near and 
 from what they had heard it was a nice
 town and wanted to stay out for the   
 day.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
