		<title>05MANSION HOUSES</title>
		<content> This is the oldest of three mansion   
 houses in the Parish of Resolis.      
 The original house here was called    
 Ardoch, but in 1757, the laird married
 a rich heiress called Jemima Poyntz,  
 and rebuilt his house in the Dutch    
 style, naming it Poyntzfield in her   
 honour. This building has been added  
 to over the years, making it more     
 interesting with the different styles 
 of architecture. Its most interesting 
 feature is the tower, at the top of   
 which is a secret room. From here     
 there are magnificent views over the  
 surrounding countryside. Another point
 of interest is the unusual drawing    
 room door which is curved. It is solid
 mahogany, and was carved by the local 
 joiner's grandfather.                 
 The house is now a hotel and is       
 becoming very popular with local      
 people and tourists alike.            </content>
