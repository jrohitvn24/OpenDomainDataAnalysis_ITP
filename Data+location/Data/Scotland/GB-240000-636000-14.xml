		<title>14CRICKET CLUB KILMARNOCK (4)</title>
		<content> THE SPECIAL GUEST AT THE OPENING OF   
 THE NEW PAVILION WAS AUSTRALIAN TEST  
 CRICKETER,RAY PHILLIPS FROM BRISBANE, 
 WHO WAS LOANED TO KILMARNOCK AT THE   
 TIME OF THE 4th. TEST MATCH AT        
 BIRMINGHAM AGAINST ENGLAND. IN THAT   
 PARTICULAR TEST MATCH PHILLIPS WAS NOT
 INCLUDED IN THE AUSTRALIAN TEAM AND   
 THUS WAS AVAILABLE TO PLAY AS THE CLUB
 PROFESSIONAL FOR THE TWO WEEK-END     
 LEAGUE MATCHES.                       
      THE SATURDAY GAME WAS AGAINST    
 GREENOCK WHICH KILMARNOCK WON AFTER AN
 EXCITING MATCH. UNFORTUNATELY THE     
 SUNDAY MATCH AGAINST UDDINGSTON,FROM  
 LANARKSHIRE WAS RAINED OFF.           
      THE SUMMER OF 1985 TURNED OUT TO 
 BE THE WORST IN LIVING MEMORY AND A   
 GREAT DEAL OF THE CRICKET WAS SIMPLY  
 RAINED OFF.
