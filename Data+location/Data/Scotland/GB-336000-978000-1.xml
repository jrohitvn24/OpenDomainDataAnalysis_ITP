		<content> Stroma is an island in the Pentland   
 Firth 3 kilometers north west of John 
 O'Groats in Caithness.                
 The island is 3 kilometers long and 1 
 1/2 - 2 kilometers wide. It was       
 inhabited until tht 1960s when its    
 economy declined and it was abandoned.
 There are several crofts and a school 
 all of which are now derelict. Its    
 only inhabitants now are the          
 lighthouse keepers in the lighthouse  
 at the north end of the island at     
 Swilkie Point.  This area of the      
 survey only includes part of the      
 foreshore on the north eastern side of
 Stroma.                               
 Access to the island is difficult as  
 there is no longer any boat service to
 Stroma.
