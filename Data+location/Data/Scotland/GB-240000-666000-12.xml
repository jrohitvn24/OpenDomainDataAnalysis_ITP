		<title>12SOCIAL CONCERNS IN HOUSTON</title>
		<content>  The rapid expansion of population has
 meant that the services have failed to
 satisfy the demand. The shortage of   
 school capacity has meant that Houston
 children may be bussed to nearby      
 Linwood for primary and secondary     
 education. This has brought about a   
 storm of protest from residents in    
 newer outlying areas of the village.  
 The shopping services in the village  
 are inadequate and although the       
 planning authority have recognized the
 needs, there is difficulty in agreeing
 on a suitable site because of the     
 effect on nearby residential areas.   
 The rural and conservation flavour of 
 the area is being altered by pressure 
 of population, e.g.litter,river       
 pollution and vandalism of woodland   
 areas.
