		<content> A survey carried out among children   
 and adults in Aviemore show that      
{sports and sports-related activities  
 are the most popular forms of leisure 
 and recreation in this area probably  
 because the Aviemore Holiday Centre   
 provides many excellent facilities for
 both participant and spectator sports.
 One sport enjoyed by many people in   
 the area is Ice Hockey.The local team,
{Aviemore Blackhawks}(named after a    
 famous US team Chicago Blackhawks)was 
 established about 10 years ago and has
 recently won the Scottish Section of  
 the Second Division and was runner-up 
 in the British section.The team plays 
 about 20 league matches per season and
 trains twice weekly.Their success has 
 increased interest in the sport and a 
 junior team has recently been         
 established.                          
                                       </content>
