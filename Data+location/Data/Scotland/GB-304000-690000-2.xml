		<title>02CRAIGLUSCAR RESERVOIRS</title>
		<content> CRAIGLUSCAR HAS THREE RESERVOIRS,THE  
 COMPENSATION RESEVOIR AND THE EAST    
 AND WEST STORAGE RESERVOIRS. ALL THREE
 RESERVOIRS LIE TO THE SOUTH EAST OF   
 CRAIGLUSCAR HILL.                     
 EAST AND WEST STORE RESERVOIRS        
 WERE BUILT IN THE 1880'S BUT ARE NO   
 LONGER USED FOR PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY   
 BUT ARE STILL MAINTAINED AND          
 SERVICED BY THE FIFE REGIONAL COUNCIL.
 THEY COVER AN AREA OF 22.6 ACRES AND  
 HAVE A TOP WATER LEVEL OF 490ft ABOVE 
 SEA LEVEL WITH AN AVERAGE RAINFALL OF 
 38.5 INCHES. THE COMPENSATION         
 RESERVOIR WAS USED AS A BACK UP SYSTEM
 IT COVERS A TOTAL AREA OF 19.5 ACRES. 
 THE COMPENSATION RESERVOIR LIES LOWER 
 THAN THE EAST AND WEST THUS RESULTING 
 IN AN AVERAGE RAINFALL LOWER THAN THAT
 OF THE EAST AND WEST RESERVOIRS. DUE  
 TO POOR UPKEEP AND CONDITION IT MAY BE
 CLOSED                                </content>
