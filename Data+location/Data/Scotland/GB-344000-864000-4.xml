		<content>      MY MOTHER SHOUTS "JUDITH GET UP" 
 SO I GET UP AND GO INTO THE BATHROOM. 
 I GET WASHED AND DRESSED THEN I GO    
 DOWNSTAIRS.  IT IS 8.15.  I HAVE MY   
 BREAKFAST- PERHAPS A GLASS OF MILK AND
 A BISCUIT.  AFTER I PUT MY CUP IN THE 
 BASIN TO BE WASHED, I GET MY COAT AND 
 SCHOOL BAG AND GO OFF TO SCHOOL. I    
 SHOUT "CHEERIO MUM".  SOMETIMES I GO  
 FOR LEANNE NEXT DOOR AND WE WALK TO   
 SCHOOL.  ON ARRIVAL AT SCHOOL, I PLAY 
 CHASES WITH THE GIRLS.  I AM ALWAYS IT
 AT FIRST.  WHEN THE BELL RINGS, WE RUN
 INTO LINES.  WE DO OUR SPELLING, MATHS
 AND LANGUAGE UNTIL LUNCH TIME.  AT    
 12.30, I HAVE MY LUNCH OF TOMATO SOUP.
 AFTER LUNCH, WE DO OUR PROJECT ON     
 TEETH UNTIL 3.30 AND THE END OF       
 SCHOOL.  I PLAY WITH DIANNE UNTIL     
 SUPPERTIME AT 6.00,  I PLAY OUTSIDE   
 UNTIL 9.00 THEN WATCH T.V. TILL       
 BEDTIME.   {BY JUDITH TAIT.           </content>
