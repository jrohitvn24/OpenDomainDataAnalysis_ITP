		<title>13"WHY I LIKE CUMBERNAULD"(1)</title>
		<content> My family and I like Cumbernauld a    
 lot.I have lived here all my life and 
 I don't think I will ever leave. There
 are a lot of schools we could go to   
 which are all close to home. We live  
 on a Wimpey Estate which is next to   
 Whitelees Primary School. It is very  
 quiet because the factories are far   
 away from us on their own Industial   
 Estates. Cumbernauld has a lot of     
 facilities for people about my age    
 (12). We could go swimming or up to   
 the Town Centre where there is a great
 selection of shops. The good thing    
 about being able to go to these places
 is that wherever we go we never have  
 to cross any main roads because there 
 is a system where pedestrians have    
 their own footpaths, bridges and      
 underpasses.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
