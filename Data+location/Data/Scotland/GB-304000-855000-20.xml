		<title>20TRANSPORT RAFFORD AREA</title>
		<content> The only public transport in the area 
 is the local bus which runs twice     
 every day.Children are taken to school
 in Forres by school bus.A local man   
 has a mini-bus in which he drives     
 people around the area as required.   
  As Rafford is a commuter village most
 people require a car to go to, Forres 
 and other towns.We found that nearly  
 every family had at least one car and 
 half of the families interviewed had  
 two cars while 4 families had 3.Of the
 cars we found in our survey that 36%  
 were British while 64% were           
 foreign.The most popular cars were    
 Ford and Renault.The most popular     
 colour of car was blue while the least
 popular colour was black.             
  Many people have bicycles and we     
 found that there was an average of two
 bicycles per house.
