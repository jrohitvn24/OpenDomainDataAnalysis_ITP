		<content> The{single-teacher school}is situated 
 by Loch Assynt.There has been a school
 here for over 200 years but the school
 house is no longer used as such. The  
 old classroom is now a black_out room 
 and canteen.No meals are served due to
 high cost and the 6 children eat      
 packed lunches.The school is a demount
 -able unit which serves pupils (aged  
{5-12)}living within a radius of 16km  
 but one family has to travel{21km}from
 Benmore Lodge. The highest roll was{23
 and the lowest,2.Before a car was used
 some pupils walked 4km to school.Other
 teachers come to teach{art,gym and    
{music, including bagpipes.}There are  
 many books, paper, paint, pens etc.,as
 well as{television, tape recorders,   
{slide projector, computer and piano.  
 Hot water was installed in 1978 but at
 times of frost and drought water must 
 be fetched from the well nearby!      </content>
