		<title>05AT HOME ON THE FARM.</title>
		<content> My name is Katrina, I am five and     
 I live on a farm in Kilchrenan.  Today
 I am living in my home with my Mum and
 Dad, Michael, Kathleen and my Auntie  
 Gwen, who has come to visit with my   
 cousins,David and Shona.              
  There are dogs, a cat, sheep and     
 lambs, cows and calves, a bull called 
 Topaz, ducks, hens and donkeys on my  
 farm.                                 
  My dad is a farmer and he has a      
 special motorbike to whizz round the  
 sheep especially at lambing time. I   
 like to help because I get a ride     
 on the three wheeler bike.            
  One time I got a ride on a helicopter
 when it was spraying the hills to kill
 the thistles and gorse. The sheep and 
 cattle do not eat these.              
  When I am not at school I like to    
 help my dad on the farm or go fishing 
 with him.                             </content>
