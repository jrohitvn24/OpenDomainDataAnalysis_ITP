		<title>20PLACES OF INTEREST_DUNDONALD</title>
		<content>  If you are visiting our area of      
 Dundonald and surrounding countryside,
 there are many places of interest for 
 you to see. In fact, if you are a     
 treasure seeker, then you might be    
 interested in a local legend which    
 tells us of buried treasure up in the 
 glen behind the village. In times of  
 stress,it is said, the monks who lived
 there used to bury their valuables    
 somewhere there and they have never   
 been found!                           
  Apart from the famous{Dundonald      
{Castle, }there is another castle      
 called {Old Auchans Castle}nearby.    
 This castle was built in the 17th     
 Century by the Wallaces and later     
 became part of the Eglinton Estates.  
 This castle too is now a ruin, but    
 well worth a visit.                   
  On the road between Loans and        
 Dundonald there is an{ancient fort.}  </content>
