		<title>01Pentland Skerries</title>
		<content> Pentland Skerries lies at the eastern 
 entrance to the Pentland Firth.  The  
 largest of the skeris, Muckle sherry, 
 is included in this area.   It is     
 rough moorland about 1 kilometre long 
 and 3/4 kilometre wide, and about 18  
 metres at its highest point.  The     
 island was farmed originally but was  
 abandoned last century.  The only     
 visible remains of farming being      
 several stone dykes.  The highest     
 point of Muckle Skerry is now the site
 for the Pentland skerries lighthouse, 
 marking the entrance to the pentland  
 Firth.  This is at present still      
 manned by three keepers, but          
 eventually will be made an automatic  
 light.  Access to the Skerries is     
 difficult because of the tidal flow   
 through the Pentland Firth, which in  
 places can be 9 knots or more.
