		<title>12THE GLEN CLOVA POST BUS.</title>
		<content>  The Post Bus is a Freight Rover,     
 2000cc, and brand new. It has a 15    
 gallon petrol tank. The bus from      
 Monday- Fiday leaves Kirriemuir at    
 8:30am &amp; 3:05pm and arrives at Clova  
 Hotel at 10:00am &amp; 3:35pm . It arrives
 back in Kirriemuir at 11:50am &amp; 4:30pm
 On Saturday it only does the morning  
 run. The bus can carry 11 passengers  
 not including the driver. The fare    
 from Kiriemuir to Clova Hotel is      
 Â£1.05. The bus carries letters,       
 newspapers and groceries. The average 
 amount of people who travel on the bus
 is 30 but most travel only as far as  
 Dykehead. The postmen think the new   
 bus is better to drive than the old   
 one but the passengers preferred the  
 old bus because it had a back door and
 a side door. The new one has only a   
 back door,the step is too high off the
 ground and the seats are too bouncy.  </content>
