		<content> In St. Andrews, there are clubs for   
 people of all ages, such as Guides,   
 Gymnastics and Ballet for girls and   
 Scouts, Football and Rugby for boys.  
 There are also clubs for both boys and
 girls such as Tennis, Byre Theatre    
 Drama Group, Step Rock Swimming Club  
 and an Athletics Club.                
 For adults there are night classes    
 such as Keep Fit, Swimming and Crafts.
 Most of the clubs are run by adult    
 volunteers and most of them are held  
 in school buildings or school grounds.
 Most of the club activities take place
 in the evening.
