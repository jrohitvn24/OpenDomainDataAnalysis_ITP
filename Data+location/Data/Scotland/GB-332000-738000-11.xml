		<content> As soon as the first of the crops has 
 been harvested tractors with large    
 four-furrow ploughs, many of them     
 reversible, that is having two sets of
 ploughs one upside down to the other  
 enabling the driver to work backwards 
 and forwards instead of going round   
 and round a large area, plough the    
 fields. After the ground has been     
 ploughed and harrowed, or raked, The  
 seed driller will come along and sow  
 the winter barley or wheat, or oil    
 seed rape. In about ten days time the 
 green shoots will appear and the      
 farmer will say that the crop has     
{breared.}Throughout the winter fields,
 which at one time would have been     
 brown stubbles, are green and fresh.  
 In spring the other crops such as     
 spring barley, oats, peas, beans,     
 potatoes and turnips are sown or      
 planted.                              </content>
