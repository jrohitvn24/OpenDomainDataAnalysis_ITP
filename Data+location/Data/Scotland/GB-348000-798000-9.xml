		<content> Two Constables are stationed at       
 Aboyne, forming part of a team cover  
 for the wider area which includes     
 Aboyne.                               
 Their role is to guard, patrol and    
 protect, detect offenders and report  
 them if necessary. In addition the    
 constables are involved in the        
 community at both professional and    
 personal levels.                      
 Theft is the most common crime, mainly
 of items valued up to Â£500. There are 
 frequent breaches of the peace and    
 road traffic offences. Drug abuse is  
 becoming a problem.                   
 Detection rates are at 50 to 60% in   
 rural areas - higher than in urban    
 areas.
