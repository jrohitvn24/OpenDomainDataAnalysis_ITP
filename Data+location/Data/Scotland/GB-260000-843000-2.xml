		<title>02FARMS AND CROFTS</title>
		<content>   Most of our area is taken up by     
 farms and crofts. I live on a farm    
 called Ladystone Farm. It is quite    
 large for this area and covers 747    
 acres. About a third of the farm is   
 arable and the rest is used for the   
 animals. We have about 713 sheep, 102 
 cows, and calves, nine ducks, nine    
 hens, 30 pigs and 150 turkeys. There  
 are 16 fields. We grow more barley    
 than anything else, and also potatoes,
 turnips and kale. When the crops are  
 ready to pick all my family help. When
 we have picked all of them we keep    
 some things and the rest of the crops 
 get sold. They sometimes go to the    
 local shop.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
