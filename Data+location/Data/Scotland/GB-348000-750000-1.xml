		<title>01AREA DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> Most of the area is{farming}with      
 crops other than grass, but a small   
 area is uncultivated. Most of the     
 people who live in the area are       
 farmers.  There are no{recreation     
 centres or clubs of any description   
 apart from Forfar Golf Club.  The only
 places of religious worship are       
 Rescobie{church}and Restenneth Priory 
 where a service is held once a year,  
 but unfortunately most of the Priory  
 is in ruins.  The Hunter Library at   
 Restenneth has mainly books but there 
 are also some swords and armour. Trout
 are raised on some of the farms and   
 then put into Rescobie loch for       
 fishermen to catch. Mostly the area is
 very picturesque. The{forest}is a     
 favourite with the locals with long   
 walks.  There are also deer and       
 squirrels in the forest.
