The school has 90 pupils aged 4-12 years. There are 4 classes. A hutted classroom was added in 1992. School times are 9.00am to 3.00pm with a morning break of 15 minutes and lunch break of 45 minutes. A day would include maths, language, topic work and expressive arts. The H.T. is also H.T. for Wellwood School. We have a P.T., 5 teachers(2 teachers job share), 2 support assistants, an office auxiliary and a janitor/lollipop man.&lt;br />&lt;br />Few pupils go home for lunch, most bring packed lunches and only a few have school dinners. The school still has a football team. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
