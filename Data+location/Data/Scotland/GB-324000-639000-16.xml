		<title>16 OUR NEW LIFE IN PEEBLES(2)</title>
		<content>                                       
 while my Dad looked for houses.       
   During a visit to Peebles,we heard  
 about new houses being built so we    
 looked at them and in the end bought  
 one.We moved in on 5th November 1983. 
   I like Peebles a lot  it reminds me 
 of the more scenic areas of           
 Northumberland.I especially like      
 Hay Lodge Park which has lots of good 
 facilities and woodland areas.The     
 shops are good for my mum because it's
 not too far from our house.Peebles is 
 a great place for going walks at      
 night.You can see the sunset          
 silhouetted against the trees.Here you
 can get clean fresh air instead of    
 industrial fumes.I like Peebles a lot 
 and don't want to move from it.
