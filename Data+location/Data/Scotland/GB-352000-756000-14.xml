		<content> The{houses}are scattered and mainly   
 farmhouses or farm cottages. There is 
 a row of Local Authority houses, which
 have been recently renovated. Lately a
 few cottages have been sold to        
 families unconnected with the land.   
                                       
{Employment}                           
 Most people are{employed}on the land, 
 as there is little opportunity for    
 other employment in the area. Casual  
 and seasonal work can be obtained     
 during the harvest (both cereal and   
 potato), but there is a fairly high   
 rate of unemployment.
