		<title>01The Ballachulish Bridge Area</title>
		<content> The Ballachulish Bridge area is       
 scenically very beautiful with        
 mountains rising steeply out of the   
 sea. Ballachulish Bay, 5 on grid is   
 deep enough to take ocean liners. The 
 villages &amp; road which connects them   
 are all on the narrow coastal strip.  
 The bridge replaced a ferry &amp; has cut 
 about 15 miles from the A82. Tourism  
 is the main industry bringing jobs &amp;  
 money to the people though this is    
 mainly seasonal as well as hotel      
 accommodation, many homes provide B&amp;B.
 Quite a number work in Fort William   
 the market town, the secondary school 
 is there. Other jobs are in forestry &amp;
 Local Council. Tourists visiting for  
 the scenery, climbers for the hills   
 come all year. In the summer, campers 
 &amp; an increasing number of small boats 
 sailing in the sheltered waters bring 
 work to more areas.                   </content>
