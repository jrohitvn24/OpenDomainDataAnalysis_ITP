		<title>09LEUCHARS CHURCH</title>
		<content> Leuchars church stands on a hill in   
 the middle of the village. The        
 Normandy tower which was built in 1187
 is the oldest part. The newer front   
 was built in 1587. The minister takes 
 regular services every Sunday. The    
 congregation averages about 85 people.
 The minister also takes services at   
 Balmullo and Guardbridge. He has been 
 working there for about 2\ years and  
 so he has not been aware of any real  
 changes throughout Leuchars. One of   
 the historical happenings attached to 
 the church is about a man caled       
 McKenzie who requested that his pets  
 be buried with him in the graveyard.  
 However, there was a snag. The church 
 authoroties would not allow this to   
 take place. So instead he was buried  
 along with his pets, opposite the     
 church manse. You can still see his   
 grave today.                          </content>
