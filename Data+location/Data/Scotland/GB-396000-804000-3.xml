		<content> One of the other changes to the       
 harbour has been the addition of a    
 number of oil-related service         
 industries to the locality.These      
 include tool distributors, pipe       
 suppliers,geological survey companies 
 and specialised engineering facilities
 One of the casualities of these       
 structural changes has been the       
 disappearance of the original fishing 
 village of Old Torry.The site where   
 the rows of little cottages once stood
 is now Shell U.K. Exploration Oil Base
 comprising of cylindrical oil tanks,  
 warehouses,offices and storage yards  
 festooned with pipes and drilling     
 equipment.despite being designated    
 a Conservation Area and also strong   
 local opposition,redevelopment went   
 ahead due to the urgent need for      
 meeting and accomodating the oil      
 industry's demands at the time.       </content>
