		<title>18BONAR BRIDGE ENTERTAINMENTS</title>
		<content> At Christmas the old people all meet  
 at the church hall for their annual   
{Christmas party.}People from the      
 village who sing or play an instument 
 go along to entertain them. My name   
 is Steven and I go to sing songs to   
 them if I am asked. There are  tea    
 and cakes at half time and then more  
 singing  until it is time to go home. 
 Later on in the year the local{MOD    
 is held.I was competing in the boys   
 over 10 and under 13. I sang a Gaelic 
 song called{TOIRT MAGHAIH RI DIURA.   
 Our competition was on at 12 00 hrs.  
 There was only one other boy in the   
 competition. My marks came to 169     
 but the other boy got 172. The        
 competitions included singing,        
 recorder playing and piping.
