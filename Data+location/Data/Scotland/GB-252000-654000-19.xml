		<title>19FOOTBALL MATCH,NEWTON MEARNS</title>
		<content>     In general most people go to see  
 football matches on public transport  
 i.e. bus train or subway. Others take 
 their cars and park them in the       
 carpark.                              
    When they get there they pay to    
 take a seat in the stand or they stand
 in the terrace. Before the match      
 starts a band plays to the crowd while
 the teams warm-up.                    
    The object is for one team to score
 more goals than the other by kicking a
 ball into the opposition's net. Each  
 team has eleven players. When a goal  
 is scored the supporters shout and    
 sing for their own team. The          
 supporters are separated by fences to 
 stop fights between the rival         
 supporters. At halftime the supporters
 have pies and bovril. After 1O mins   
 the game restarts, at the end the     
 supporters leave and go back home.    </content>
