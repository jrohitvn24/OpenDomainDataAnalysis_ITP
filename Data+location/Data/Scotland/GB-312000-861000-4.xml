		<title>04MY CLASSROOM AT ALVES P.S.</title>
		<content> At Alves Primary School P.6 and P.7   
 are in a classroom together, taught by
 Mr. Holland who is also the           
 Headteacher. We all sit at tables in  
 groups of at least four people. All   
 around the classroom on the walls are 
 pictures and poems that we have made. 
 Each term we make a large frieze about
 our project. This stretches right     
 across one of the classroom walls.    
 These pictures improve the classroom's
 appearance, but dispite this, it still
 has disadvantages. As the school has  
 recently been made open plan it seems 
 to be very noisy. We can also hear    
 cars and lorries whizzing past on the 
 A96. The most annoying thing is       
 hearing aeroplanes from RAF Kinloss   
 and Lossiemouth flying past directly  
 overhead, just as Mr. Holland is      
 trying to explain something.
