		<title>06 Work on a Keith farm</title>
		<content>At 7a.m. I walked into the big shed.In 
this shed is stored the  winter feed   
for the cattle.The farm tractors and   
machinery are also kept here. Climbing 
up the steps into the cab of the       
Massey Ferguson 4-wheel drive tractor, 
I saw that the other tractors had      
already gone.I  switched on the engine 
and speeding down the road,with the    
Claas forage harvester behind,I        
turned into the already cut grass      
field.I waited for the other tractor   
to come alongside with the Weeks       
cart.I switched on the power           
drive and moved forward.As we worked   
our way around the field,the forage    
harvester filled the cart with the     
chopped grass.When full,the grass  was 
taken back to the farm to be dumped in 
a pit and left to ferment.This makes   
it into silage which is used as winter 
feed for the cattle.                   </content>
