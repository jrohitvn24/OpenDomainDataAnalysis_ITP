		<title>13Salmon Fishing on the Dee</title>
		<content> The River Dee stretches over 70 miles 
 &amp; is famous for salmon fishing. As it 
 passes through an estate it gives the 
 owner the right to issue permits for  
 fishing the waters. In this area of   
 Crathie and Balmoral 6 fishers can    
 fish 6 days a week from April to Sept.
 No licence is needed to buy or use a  
 fishing rod but you do have to have a 
 permit obtained from the Estate owner.
 This year was a good year for salmon  
 as the water level was high. On       
 Balmoral this season there have been  
 about 107 salmon and 14 sea trout     
 caught, the 2 biggest weighing 21lbs. 
  "The fishers get up at 8am and return
 at 5pm. They are only allowed to catch
 3 fish a day and take 2 rods with them
 2 ghillies go with them. You are not  
 allowed to fish without permission    
 from the Laird. If you get caught like
 my uncle did you get fined Â£55."      </content>
