		<title>14    JUNE FOR THE GALA!</title>
		<content>  The first Saturday in June is special
 for people of Dalmilling/Whitletts,   
 for this is the day usually set aside 
 for the {Gala.}The Community Committee
 spend a whole year making plans for   
 this annual event.From as early as    
 1900, Whitletts,like so many mining   
 communities,had their own gala.To try 
 to give the community a feeling of    
 working together,{this custom was     
{revived in 1980.}Traditionally,a{Gala 
{Queen}and her attendants are chosen   
 from senior classes of local primary  
 schools,while the page boys are       
 selected from the local playgroup and 
 from  Westwood Nursery.The crowning   
 ceremony starts off a week of fun and 
 games for young and old alike.On the  
 final Saturday a procession of people 
 in fancy dress and of decorated floats
 parades round the area,adorned with   
 flags,on its way to a sports field.   </content>
