		<title>19A VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    Our school is very small. There are
 thirteen pupils in the school and one 
 teacher. All the children, aged from  
 five to eleven, are taught in the same
 room and all work individually or     
 in small groups. There are four       
 children in Primary 6 and only one    
 in Primary 1. School begins           
 at 9.25 am and we have a 20 minute    
 interval at 11.00 am. When it is time 
 for lunch at 12.30 pm we have to put  
 our work away and set the desks for   
 lunch. The meals are brought in a car 
 from a school about 5km away. The     
 meals are served out in the classroom 
 and there are sinks at one end of the 
 room for washing the dishes.After     
 lunch we play outside until 1.30 pm.  
 If it is raining we are usually       
 allowed to stay in and play games.
