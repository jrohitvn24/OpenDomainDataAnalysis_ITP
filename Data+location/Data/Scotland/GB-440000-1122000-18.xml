		<title>18MOUSA - SANDWICK</title>
		<content>   The flagstones from the island of   
 Mousa were transported to Lerwick and 
 used  as paving slabs for the streets.
   The great great grandmother of two  
 pupils in our class was one of the    
 last people to live on Mousa. She left
 when she was eight years old in 1855. 
   The island is very attractive to    
 tourists who visit it to see the broch
 and the wildlife which is abundant.   
   The wreck of the S.S.St Sunniva is  
 still to be seen on the east side of  
 the island, where it ran aground in   
 thick fog in 1930.                    
   There is a small automatic          
 lighthouse on the east coast of Mousa 
 and the boatman changes the           
 batteries when necessary.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
