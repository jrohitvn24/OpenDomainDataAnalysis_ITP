		<content>    This  small{hamlet}lies to the     
 south of our block  on the exposed    
 coastline overlooking the{Minch.}It   
 has a clean open sandy beach which is 
 slowly{eroding}up past the road.      
   There are a few holiday homes and a 
 small{camping site}on the beach. It is
  also known to be very good for       
{surfing.}The  burn(stream)  running   
 through the beach is good for paddling
 in, you can also catch small trout in 
 it.                                   
   Clashnessie  also has a small       
{waterfall}which is approximately half 
 a kilometer from the road. At the     
 top of the waterfall is {Loch an      
{Easain.}At the bottom of the falls is 
 the burn which runs down to the sea   
 through the beach.                    
   One summer the falls  were so dried 
 up you could see all the{eels and     
{small trout}falling down the side.    </content>
