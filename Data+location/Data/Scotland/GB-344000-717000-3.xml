		<title>03PAST INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> In the Guardbridge area there is      
 evidence of industries created during 
 the early 19th Century.  For, example,
 there were meal, barley, lint, even a 
 saw mill on the Motray Water.  All    
 were moved by water power.  About this
 time, a large distillery was erected  
 at Seggie, by Haigs, and was powered  
 by steam.  It was on this site that   
 the Guardbridge Paper Company was set 
 up in 1873, diverting the water supply
 for its own use; but thereby closing  
 some of the mills.  Brickmaking was   
 important as a use for clay and there 
 are ruins of at least 3 brickworks in 
 Guardbridge.  The Eden Estuary was    
 used for salmon and sea-front fishing,
 but pollution has recently affected   
 these badly.  This has also happened  
 to the Mussel industry.  By the time  
 the Paper Mill was in operation most  
 other industries had declined.        </content>
