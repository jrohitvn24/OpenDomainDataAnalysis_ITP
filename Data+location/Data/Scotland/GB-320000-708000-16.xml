		<title>16Land use around Strathmiglo</title>
		<content> Most of the land around Strathmiglo is
 rich farmland either under crops or   
 grass for cutting as silage.Some of   
 the land is grassland used for        
 pasture.The main cash crops are wheat 
 and barley,both winter and spring,    
 followed by potatoes and oil seed     
 rape. This is just the second year    
 that oil seed rape has been grown in  
 this part of the country.Farmers are  
 offered a special financial incentive 
 by the Common Market for growing this 
 crop.Silage is used for the feeding of
 animals, in particular the beef       
 cattle,continental cross breeds,which 
 local farmers keep. Much of the winter
 barley grown is also used for feeding 
 animals. All the local farmers keep   
 beef cattle though one farmer         
 concentrates on his herd of  Fresian  
 cows and another on mainly Blackface  
 sheep.                                </content>
