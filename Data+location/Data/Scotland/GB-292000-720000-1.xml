		<title>01GAZETEER OF MADDERTY</title>
		<content> Madderty is a parish,not a town or a  
 village, which lies in the lovely     
 valley of Strathearn. It is 7 miles   
 Crieff and 11 miles from Perth. The   
 scenery is beautiful. We are rich in  
 wildlife. Tourists often visit us.    
 The area is mostly farmland. Barley   
 is the main crop. It is a farming     
 community.People live mainly on farms 
 quite a distance from each other.     
 There is a small village of around 40 
 people called St Davids.About one and 
 a half miles from the village there   
 is a primary school.The schoolhouse   
 attached to the school is 151 years   
 old but the school has been           
 modernised. Near the school is the    
 Abbey Church. The church, the school  
 and the village hall are where people 
 meet.
