		<title>01Warthill and Roseness Holm</title>
		<content> This area is the eastern part of the  
 parish of Holm in the East Mainland of
 Orkney It is fairly sparsey populated.
 Most of the area being covered by     
 farms and small holdings given over to
 sheep and cattle.  Between Warthill   
 farm and Royy Farm the land is        
 intensively farmed.  The remaindder to
 the east is moorland and rough        
 grazing. There are peat cuttings on   
 roseness but these have long since    
 been abandoned.                       
 Along the coastline,though only 50    
 metres at their highest point, are    
 very spectacular cliffs with many     
 gullies patforms and geos.            
 On Roseness Point is a Cairn,these are
 very common archelogical sites in     
 Orkney,this was the remains of a      
 broch,though its origins are unknown.
