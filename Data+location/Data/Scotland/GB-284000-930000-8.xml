		<content> The sheep which graze on our hills are
 a small hardy breed known as North    
 Country Cheviots. Winter is very      
 severe in the hills and the young ewe 
 hogs(last year's lambs) are taken to  
 the lowland farms to be wintered. The 
 older sheep are fed with hay and      
 vitamin blocks during the bad weather.
 Soon the lambing starts. Shepherds    
 have to attend the lambs from early   
 morning until late at night.Then the  
 dipping and clipping of the sheep     
 begins.First they have to be gathered 
 and taken to the clipping sheds. Later
 in the year the hay is cut and baled  
 for the winter and the sheep sales    
 begin. The sheep sale at Lairg is one 
 of the biggest sheep sales in Britain.
 Many of the sheep are bought by buyers
 from the south. The year passes and   
 soon it is time for the hogs to be    
 wintered.                             </content>
