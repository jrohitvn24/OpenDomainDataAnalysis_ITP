		<content> Most of the block is treeless, except 
 round farmsteads, with few hedges     
 between fields.  Gorse and broom are  
 predominant in uncultivated places and
 most of the higher ground has been    
 reclaimed.  The river valley is rich  
 in{wildlife:}including duck, moorhens,
 dippers, game birds, grey wagtails and
 roedeer. Oyster catchers and lapwings 
 breed in the fields.{Predators}include
 stoats, weasels, mink, foxes, owls,   
 kestrels, sparrow hawks and carrion   
 crows. Rabbits and pigeons abound and 
 are unpopular with crop producers.    
 Finches,tits,robins,thrushes, sparrows
 are found in gardens and roadsides;   
 swallows nest in outhouses, and in    
 winter flocks of geese visit stubble  
 fields. Bats colonise the church,rats 
 and mice the barns, hedgehogs the     
 roadside. Salmon, sea and brown trout 
 and eels are in the river.            </content>
