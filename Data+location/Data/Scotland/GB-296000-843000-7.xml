		<title>07POSTAL SERVICE IN FERNESS</title>
		<content>   There has been a post office at     
 Ferness since the village was built in
 the mid 1800's.                       
   The mail used to be brought to      
 Ferness by horse and cart from        
 Dunphail where it met the train on the
 Forres/Grantown on Spey line. Today it
 comes by postbus from Nairn. This     
 service began in 1973, bringing mail  
 to and collecting it from Glenferness 
 post office. The postbus can carry 11 
 passengers who are able to spend 2    
 hours in Nairn between the two daily  
 rounds.                               
    From Ferness the mail is delivered 
 to the households by van. It takes the
 postman approx. 5 hours to complete   
 his round. Some houses are remote and 
 in winter it is often impossible to   
 reach them for several days.
