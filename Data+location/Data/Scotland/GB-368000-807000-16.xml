		<content> The school is over twenty years old,  
 and the 'hut', an extra classroom, was
 built four years ago.The school has   
 fifty-three children, and three       
 teaching staff (The head mistress also
 teaches).Each teacer teaches a        
 composite class.We study Language,    
 Mathematics, Reading, Social and      
 Religious studies.In our school we    
 have five specialist staff.We have    
 teachers for Art, Gym, Drama, Home    
 Economics and Music.We also have a    
 remedial teacher who helps children   
 with Language and Maths.Each term we  
 have 'activities', which include      
 netball, puppetry, collage, chess,    
 tie-dying, cycling proficiency and    
 birdwatching.Mothers offer to help.   
 Each child spends five periods at each
 activity.
