		<title>12SCHOOLS IN ST. NINIANS.</title>
		<content> There are 6 schools in our area       
 altogether,one nursery,3 primary and  
 two secondary.The{primary schools}are 
 generally much smaller than the       
 secondery. They are run by a          
 Headmaster,an assistant and class     
 teachers. Children of any faith may   
 attend.{Secondery School}has more than
 one primary joining with it and the   
 staff is much larger, Rector, Depute, 
 Assistant as well as teachers. One of 
 our secondary schools is attended only
 by children of the{Roman Catholic     
 Faith. The other is                   
{non-denominational.}You start         
 nursery at 4 years of age, go on to   
 primary at 5 and move up to secondary 
 at 12. By law you must attend school  
 until you are 16 but you may chose to 
 go on until 18, then to University. We
 have a{special school}for handicapped 
 children.(C.SIBBALD, R.SMITH)         </content>
