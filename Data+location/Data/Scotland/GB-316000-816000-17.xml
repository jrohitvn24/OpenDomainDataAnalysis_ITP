 situated on the Main Street.  It has a
 comfortable Guest House with all the  
 modern facilities and is also open to 
 non-trekkers.                         
 There are 6 stall for the ponies and  
 they are located behind the Guest     
 House.  There is a cleaning room and  
 hay store there as well.              
 There are l5 ponies aged from 8 to l7 
 years.  The ponies are the Highland   
 breed which is the biggest of         
 Scotland's native breeds.  They can   
 safely carry a child or adult all day 
 long whether they are experienced     
 trekkers or not.  There are some      
 equally reliable New Forest and Welsh 
 Mountain ponies for the smaller       
 riders.  The ponies go to winter homes
 when the trekking season is over.  The
 treks go to many places within a lO   
 mile radius of Tomintoul.             </content>
