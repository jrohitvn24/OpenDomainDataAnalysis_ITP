		<content> Our D_Block covers only a small       
 section of Auchtermuchty on the       
 eastern side. Bow Road is the oldest  
 road, first developed in the late     
 1600s with some houses being added in 
 the early 18th century. Bow Road was  
 probably the main road but was flooded
 by water collecting on the lower      
 ground. This made tracks too muddy for
 carriages so a road was built slightly
 higher up_ namely the Cupar road(A91).
 Housing was built around the road, as 
 well as along a road which branched   
 off_middleflat. Sandstone houses and  
 cottages with thatched roofs were     
 built. Many of the original houses    
 remain but only two thatched cottages 
 currently remain in our D_Block_ one  
 adjacent to the Cupar road and the    
 other midway along Bow Road.
