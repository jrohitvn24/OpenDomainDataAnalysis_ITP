		<title>10CRAMOND :My New School</title>
		<content> Yesterday I spent the day at the Royal
 High School, the secondary school I   
 shall attend after the summer         
 holidays. I am eleven &amp; I look forward
 to the choice of subjects next year.  
 In the morning the prefects took us to
 the large Assembly Hall. The Assistant
 Rector spoke to us. Then we went to   
 the classrooms we shall use next year 
 and met our classmates and teachers.  
 The Maths teacher used green chalk. He
 supports Hibernian, the local football
 team.In the science lab we did a      
 simple experiment to see how much     
 energy could be got from a peanut. I  
 think everyone was abit nervous at    
 first but the teachers soon put us at 
 ease and the buildings didn't seem    
 quite as huge as I had imagined,      
 though I am sure that I shall getlost 
 next term. I'll miss my primary school
 but I am keen to leave it behind too. </content>
