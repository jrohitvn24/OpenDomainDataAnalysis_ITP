		<content> The Houses in our area are made from a
 wooden frame, red brick on the out    
 side then coated with white           
 plaster.There have been six houses    
 built already ananother four still    
 to be built.By the market there are   
 only seven houses and they have all   
 been built of sandstone.  At Burnbrae 
 there are eight houses.Seven of them  
  are built from sandstone and one is  
 built from red brick and white plaster
 and smoothed with a screeder,which is 
 a sort of trowel,but it's made from   
 wood.At Gatelawdridge there are eleven
 houses and they are all built from    
 sandstone. One of these is a huge     
 house which has been split into       
 several smaller houses and flats.There
 are eight houses at Cample.In each of 
 these is a telephone kiosk and a      
 pillar box.
