  We did a traffic survey outside our  
 school on Monday 13th May 1985 between
 1.45 and 1.55pm. A total of 184       
 vehicles passed the school: 125 cars, 
 20 lorries, 22 vans 5 buses, 1 motor  
 bike and 13 taxis. A few weeks ago    
 Carrie  who is in primary 6 was       
 knocked down in Calder street which is
 near our school. She ran across the   
 road to the shops and ended up in     
 hospital with cuts and bruises. We    
 have 2 lollipop people to help us     
 cross the busy roads. The lights at   
 Whifflet street are very busy with    
 lorries, buses and cars. There is a   
 green man but we still need the       
 lollipop man to help us.
