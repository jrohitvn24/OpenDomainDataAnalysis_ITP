		<title>13SHOPPING IN FORT AUGUSTUS(1)</title>
		<content>  As the {Caledonian Canal}is situated 
 almost in the centre of {Fort Augustus
  most of the shops are to be found on 
 the banks of,or close to the canal.   
 On the north bank of the canal the    
 only shops are a general store,which  
 sells gifts and souvenirs as well as  
 groceries,and a shop which sells      
 tweeds and tartans.On the south bank  
 is the local newsagent,who also sells 
 confectionary and stationery.Close to 
 the newsagent,just past the local     
 pub_{The Lock Inn,}is the butcher's   
 shop,which also sells vegetables.A van
 from this business supplies outlying  
 districts.Next door to these premises 
 is another general store,part of which
 is used as a post office.The only     
 other shop on this road is a craft    
 shop which sells leather and sheepskin
 goods,and souvenirs.
