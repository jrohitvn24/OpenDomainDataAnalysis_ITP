		<title>01TORTHORWALD</title>
		<content> Torthorwald village lies between      
 Dumfries and Lochmaben.The surrounding
 area is mainly rural. Most of the land
 is used for grazing, both intensively 
 managed, and rough. Dairy and beef    
 cattle, and sheep are kept. An old    
 airfield is used as an industrial     
 estate, including an M.O.T. Station   
 and weighbridge. Most people commute  
 to work in Dumfries, or work locally  
 on farms.                             
  The Lochar Moss is used as a dump.   
 Although it is dangerous to explore, a
 local expert has informed us that rare
 plants and insects are to be found    
 there. Birch trees predominate.
