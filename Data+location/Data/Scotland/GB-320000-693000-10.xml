 In Bowhill there is a "Burns Club"    
 where the members  are all fans of the
 poet Robert Burns. Each year they hold
 a special competition on the birthday 
 of Robert Burns 25th January, the     
 local school children  are invited to 
 recite a poem or sing a song written  
 by Burns. For many weeks we rehearse  
 our pieces with the help of our       
 teachers and parents. On the great    
 day, we go to the Bowhill Institute   
 where judges from the Burns Society   
 are waiting to hear us. The best      
 reciters and singers are given a book 
 of Burns poems as a prize. Those who  
 don't win receive a pen inscribed with
 "Bowhill Institute Burns Contest."
