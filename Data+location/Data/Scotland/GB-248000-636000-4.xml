		<content> Galston is situated in the Irvine     
 Valley,probably built up around a ford
 in the River Irvine.The river has     
 shaped a mature wide valley.The valley
 side to the North has an average      
 gradient of 1:19 and the valley side  
 to the South 1:36.The river has       
 greatly helped to develop Galston     
 providing a source of energy for the  
 early mills,but it also has hindered  
 mining with serious flooding problems.
  The land on which Galston stands has 
 a surface drift of sand and           
 gravel,drumlins and boulder clay.The  
 solid geology is carboniferous        
 limestone series and coal             
 measures.Also there are traces of     
 basalt,dolerite plugs and teschenite  
 sills which form a series of          
 waterfalls on the Burnawn.Also various
 types of agate have been found here.
