   I get up at about half past six. I  
 get dressed and washed before         
 breakfast. Whilst I am making my      
 breakfast I also make my little       
 brother and sisters breakfast I also  
 get the dogs ready. After we have our 
 breakfast my sister and I get our     
 school bags ready. After that I take  
 the dog a walk around our feild. The  
 school car comes to pick us up.       
   We arrive at school about 8.40am.   
 There are two school runs one up the  
 East end and one up the West end of   
 the island. When we get to school we  
 do our work until ten forty. Then     
 after playtime we have our lunch at   
 12:30 and another playtime at 2:30. We
 go home at 3:30.
