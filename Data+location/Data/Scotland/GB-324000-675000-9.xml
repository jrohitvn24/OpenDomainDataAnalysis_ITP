		<title>09THE CITADEL</title>
		<content> The Citadel is run by a group of      
 people, some of whom are paid workers 
 while others are volunteers.  The     
 building which used to be an old fort,
 is down by Leith Docks.   The club    
 activities include art, typing and    
 playing board games.   Over 100       
 children attend on a Tuesday evening. 
 It is 10p for admission.  The club    
 starts at 5p.m. and finishes at       
 7p.m.There is a blackboard wall.      
 There is a rest room and a very       
 reasonable tuck shop.  The leaders    
 sometimes organise excursions for the 
 children.  They also hold roller      
 discos and dances.                    
 The building is used on other days for
 meetings of various age groups:       
 teenagers, mothers and toddlers, and  
 elderly people.
