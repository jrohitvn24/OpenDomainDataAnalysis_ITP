 in 1978. The race involves old and    
 young in the construction of their own
 rafts and sailing between{Ellon and   
{Logie Buchan,}a distance of 3 miles.

 competitors this year raised Â£10,000  
 to be donated to the charities: Save  
 the Children Fund, Action Research and
 local charities. The whole event
