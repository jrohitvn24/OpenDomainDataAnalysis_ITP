{The Cathedral,}being the largest      
 church, holds memberships from people 
 in all parts of the town and          
 surrounding rural areas. Two services,
 of about one hour duration,  are held 
 each  Sunday morning and evening.There
 are{1340}people on the roll and the   
 1984 census showed that 900 attended  
 communion that year. Total membership 
 has fallen by almost 600 since 1960   
 due to changing attitudes towards     
 religion.{90}pupils are enrolled in   
 the{Sunday School.} This is a decline 
 of almost 50% since 1960. During      
 weekdays the Cathedral offers         
 facilities for other clubs and        
 organisations who wish to be connected
 with the church. These include Girl   
 Guides and Brownies, Women's Guild, a 
 Young wives' group, a badminton club,a
 Bible Class and a Choir.              </content>
