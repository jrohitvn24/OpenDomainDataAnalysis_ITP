		<title>05Employment in Newburgh</title>
		<content>   {Quarrying}is an important industry 
 in Newburgh. The main quarry, Bell's, 
 quarries stone for roads and also has 
 teams of men for roadmaking and       
 repairing. Robertson's no longer has  
 a quarry, but still makes and repairs 
 roads.                                
    The main employer in the town was  
 the{Floorcovering Factory,}but it     
 closed down in 1979. Many people were 
 paid off when the factory closed.     
    The{Courtalds group}have a small   
 factory in the town. It waterproofs   
 material which is used to make        
 clothing for the Police and the Armed 
 Forces. Unfortunately, the factory has
 paid off some of its workers recently.
    Some people work on the River Tay  
 net-fishing for{salmon and trout.     
    The surrounding countryside has    
 many{farms.}These are mainly{arable   
 and stock rearing farms.              </content>
