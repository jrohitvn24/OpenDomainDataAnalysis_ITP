		<title>16Fishing in the Spey</title>
		<content>{  The River Spey}is considered to be  
 one of the{best fishing rivers}in the 
 country. Its superb fishing brings    
 thousands of tourists and             
 holidaymakers every year to Grantown. 
   The most sought after fish is the   
{salmon -}its{season}lasts from{11th   
{Feb. to 30th Sept.}with its peak in   
 September.{Trout}season is{15th March 
{till 6th Oct,}reaching its peak       
 May/June.                             
   Each year, every fisherman on the   
 Spey aims to catch either the first   
 salmon of the season or the biggest.  
 So far in{1985}the{biggest}fish       
 caught weighed{26lb.}The biggest fish 
 caught in{recent years}weighed{48lb.  
   In 1984, the river was low and      
 fishing was bad. As a result there    
 were fewer holidaymakers. Shops and   
 hotels lost trade. Grantown depends a 
 great deal on its river.              </content>
