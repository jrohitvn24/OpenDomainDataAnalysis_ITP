		<content>   The remains of the{railway}from     
 Broughty Ferry to Forfar, with        
 stations at Gagie,Monikie &amp; Kirkbuddo 
 can still be seen. But the passenger  
 service ceased in the 1950's with the 
 last goods train running in 1965.     
  Later, the area was served  by{buses 
 travelling from Dundee to Forfar or   
 Kirriemuir.                           
  Now buses from Wellbank to Forfar    
 have  been discontinued, and have been
 replaced by 4 buses each day providing
 a circular route via Kellas or Monikie
 to Dundee.                            
   At present{school buses}are provided
 by Tayside Region, but a few years ago
 the service was run by Luckyslap      
 Garage who, in the worst winter       
 weather, would run a Land-Rover to    
 ensure the schoolchildren got home    
 safely through the snow.
