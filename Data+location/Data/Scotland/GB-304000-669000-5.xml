		<title>05DECLINE OF SHALE INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>   James Young's business reached its  
 peak in 1868, 3.25 million tons of    
 oil shale were being produced and     
 4o,000 people were employed.The       
 industry then went into decline and by
 1905 there were only 30 works         
 operating. They amalgamated in 1919 to
 form Scottish Oils Ltd. The plant at  
 Pumpherston managed to survive until  
 1963 when, despite by-products such as
 detergents, gases for lighting,       
 petrol, wax and fertiliser, it was    
 admitted that it was cheaper to import
 oil from the Persian Gulf  and this   
 forced Scottish Oils to breathe its   
 last.                                 
   Paraffin Young died in 1883 but the 
 area of West Lothian is still         
 benefiting from the results of his    
 invention.
