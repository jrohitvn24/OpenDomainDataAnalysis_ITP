		<title>12 TOURISM IN DORNIE.</title>
		<content> People like to come to see how we     
 live, our hobbies,work and            
 school.They come to see the area and  
 the people in it.The more tourists    
 there are the more money to be spent  
 therefore shops are improved and      
 hotels can open.There are a few       
 improvements to be made to encourage  
 tourism such as Gala Days.Dornie,in   
 the past,held a "Festival of          
 Flowers"There could be a general      
 tidying up and improving of the       
 countryside.But Dornie,Skye,South West
 Ross and the surrounding area sell    
 themselves due to their natural       
 beauty.Some people oppose tourism.Some
 tourists leave litter and abuse the   
 countryside but they are a minority.  
 Without tourism the area cannot expand
 or develop and therefore will slowly  
 die.
