		<title>17THE"BRICKY" HUT</title>
		<content> The concrete building, locally known  
 as the "bricky hut", is situated at   
 the  N.W. extremity of the plain of   
 Fidge. It is a relic of{World War 2,  
 and was built to house controls of the
 lights which were placed on Fidge to  
 create a mock airfield, which was a   
 decoy for the real airfields on the   
 Orkney{Mainland.}The lights were      
 turned on when enemy aircraft were    
 flying over Orkney. If they bombed    
 the decoy, the  men on watch set off  
 an explosion so the enemy went away   
 happy, thinking they had damaged an   
 airfield. If a{British aircraft}tried 
 to land, a  flare was sent up to      
 indicate to the  pilot that he was    
 over a decoy airfield.                
                                       
 The men who kept watch were members   
 of{The Sanday Platoon, Orkney Home    
{Guard. }                              </content>
