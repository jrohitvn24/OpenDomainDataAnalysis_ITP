		<content> Miss Patterson came to live in        
 Kirkpatrick Durham in 1964. When she  
 came to Kirkpatrick Durham there were 
 about 70 people in the village.       
 In 1964 there were good bus services. 
 The entertainment then included whist 
 drives, fiddlers concerts, coffee     
 evenings and a lot more. At that time 
 there were a lot of jobs. There was no
 unemployment.                         
 There weren't many children, more     
 adults than children. The fashions    
 were mini-skirts and little hats.     
 There were quite a lot of cars then.  
 The farms were about the same number  
 as in 1985. The prices have really    
 gone up a lot. There wasn't much money
 then, but much more now.              
 Houses then weren't modern and they   
 didn't have modern gadgets.
