		<content>{Kale casting.}Around Halloween        
 children sometimes go kale casting.   
 They wait until it is dark and then   
 they go out and gather some kale      
 (cabbages) from the fields, or        
 sometimes turnips or peats. They creep
 quietly to someone's house and throw  
 them in the front door and run off.   
{Guising.}At Christmas and at New      
 Year children and adults go guising.  
 They disguise themselves with old     
 clothes and masks and go around the   
 village knocking on doors. In each    
 house the folk have to guess who the  
 guisers are and masks aren't taken off
 until they guess correctly. Food and  
 drink are offered in each house and   
 sweets etc. for the children. Then the
 guisers move on to another house.
