		<content>{The Harapul Industrial Estate}        
 buildings are going to be used by     
 people wishing to start a small       
 business. It is not yet known how much
 they are going to cost to rent or the 
 rateable value. As yet,none of the    
 units have been taken but the H.R.C   
 Development Department hope to build  
 two more units in the future and there
 is already 28 interested parties.There
 are 4 workshops at present in the     
 unit.                                 
 The floor space is quite large with   
 500 square feet in each of the        
 workshops.The workshops are like      
 garages with a door beside each garage
 for pedestrian entrance.The unit is   
 built next to the Old School which is 
 now used as a youth club.
