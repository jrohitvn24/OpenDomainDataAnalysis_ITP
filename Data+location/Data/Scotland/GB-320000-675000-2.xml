		<content> We thought about the games we played  
 under 2 headings-Indoor &amp; Outdoor     
 games.                                
{Indoor Games-}these included board    
 games, activity and paper and pencil  
 games. We did a survey  of board games
 and found that the games most families
 owned were Scrabble, Monopoly and     
 Cluedo. Our top ten board games were  
 headed by Scrabble. Games were said to
 be "good" if they were easy to play,  
 exciting and not too long, if the     
 rules were easily understood and if   
 you won things along the way. Computer
 games were also becoming popular.     
{Outdoor Games-}favourites included    
 hopscotch(called peevers in Scotland),
 skipping, football, chasey or tig,    
 hide and seek, rounders and other ball
 games. There were many choosing rhymes
 to elect players with "Eeny, Meeny,   
 Miney, Mo" being most popular.        </content>
