		<title>18HALMYRE FARM</title>
		<content> Halmyre is a large farm of 328 acres. 
 It is a mixed farm that produces milk 
 from dairy cows, crops and sometimes  
 vegetables.                           
 There are three employees: one        
 dairyman, one tractorman and one      
 general worker.                       
 The farmer's daily routine during the 
 winter is usually as follows: start at
 six o'clock, feed young calves then   
 feed stirks and calf heifers.  He then
 scrapes out the shed and beds them    
 with hay.  Then he gives dairy cows   
 and young calves silage.  When this is
 done he does a seasonal job such as   
 slurrying before feeding the calves   
 again at half past four in the        
 afternoon.                            
 Of the 328 acres, 24 are barley, 16   
 are hay, 94 are silage and 186 are    
 grass.  There are 150 dairy cows,     
 called Ayrshires, and six bulls.      </content>
