		<content> In this area we have three regions of 
 great importance to those interested  
 in wild life and nature conservancy.  
 Newhall Burn, which runs very close to
 our school, Braelangwell Woods and    
 Udale Bay which those of us who live  
 in Jemimaville look out upon from our 
 windows. Newhall Burn is a            
 continuation of the Kinbeachie Burn   
 which drains the rich farming lands of
 the parish of Resolis, and is an area 
 of great ornithological and botanical 
 interest. In places it is very steep  
 sided and its banks are lined with    
 many trees, oak, beech, ash and elm   
 and a wide variety of woodland plants 
 grows here. As it nears the saltings  
 of Udale Bay it passes through alder  
 wood and willow. Braelangwell Woods   
 are of mixed birch and Scots pine.
