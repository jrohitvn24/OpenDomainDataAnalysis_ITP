 The Clock Tower stands at the square  
 of Dufftown.It took 3 years to build  
 and was completed in 1839.The clock   
 which comes from Banff is known       
 as the{"clock that hung Macpherson"   
 Macpherson was a free-booter who      
 robbed the rich and gave to the poor. 
 Lord Braco,the Sherriff of Banff      
 promised to hang Macpherson.The locals
 raised a petition for the{pardon}of   
 Macpherson.This was eventually granted
 by the High Court in Edinburgh,but    
 Lord Braco,seeing the messenger       
 cantering across the Banff Bridge     
 advanced the clock 15 minutes.Thus    
 the executoin of Macpherson took place
 before the{pardon}was in the Sherriffs
 hands.Later the clock was removed from
 Banff and placed in the tower of      
 Dufftown.Previosly it was a jail but  
 now is the Tourist Information Bureau.</content>
