		<title>16SHOTTS FARMING</title>
		<content> There is no arable or dairy farming in
 this area.                            
 Stock rearing is more suitable for the
 climate and geography.                
 The farms individually employ         
 only two or three workers.  Farming   
 land is mostly rough pasture.         
 Cattle are more often to be seen      
 than sheep.Hay and silage are made for
 winter feed.This year has been too wet
 for good hay crops ,but silage has    
 done better.                          
   The cold very wet conditions  have  
 made life uncomfortable for the       
 animals and a well drained piece of   
 pasture has been helpful in the       
 prevention of disease.                
 Farmers will be asking the government 
 for financial aid.
