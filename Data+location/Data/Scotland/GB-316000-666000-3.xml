 There are several churches in our     
 area. One of them is Currie Kirk. I   
 went to Currie Kirk to interview the  
 minister. He has been minister of the 
 Kirk for three years. He works about  
 thirteen hours a day and he enjoys    
 what he does, although sometimes it   
 gets a little hectic. On average 450  
 people go to the church on a Sunday.  
 He has one full time and one part time
 paid helper as well as 100 Sunday     
 school helpers, 100 elders and a      
 caretaker called the Beadle. In his   
 spare time he likes gardening,        
 badminton and fishing. He also watches
 Aberdeen F.C. football matches. Once  
 the King of Siam came to a wedding at 
 the Kirk in 1900.
