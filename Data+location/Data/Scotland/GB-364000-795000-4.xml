		<content> A considerable area of the map extract
 has been forested by the {Forestry    
{Commission,}especially the steep,     
 north-facing slope on the south side  
 of the river - an area with less      
 insolation than the northern part of  
 the map.                              
 North of the river the forestry is a  
 mixture of Forestry Commission        
 plantings and {estate woodland.} These
 commercial woodlands are of the more  
 rapidly growing conifers.             
 Cairnton House and Inchmarlo house    
 retain deciduous {amenity woodland    
 around them.                          
 The extreme north-west of the map has 
 poor quality silver birch {scrub      
 woodland in fields used for cattle    
 grazing on the rough pasture          
 interspersed with the birches.
