		<title>06The Caravan Site</title>
		<content> The Clyde Valley Caravan Site is      
 situated  near the river. There are   
 around fifty families who are         
 permanent residents, though there are 
 seventy residential caravans on the   
 site. The site shop is closed, but    
 there are plans to re-open it. At the 
 present the residents use the shops in
 the village. There are three, only    
 five minutes walk away. Most          
 permanent residents have coal-fired   
 central heating and tourist use       
 calor gas. The electricity is         
 supplied from the main grid. The      
 permanent residents think it is like  
 living in a little community, but     
 they would like to see improvements in
 roads, water and wiring. Visitors find
 the site quiet and in attractive      
 surroundings convenient for visiting  
 Glasgow and Edinburgh and other       
 important historical places.          </content>
