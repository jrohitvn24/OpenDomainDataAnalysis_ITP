 Our area of South Dunfermline reaches 
 from the housing estate of Abbeyview  
 in the north, to North Rosyth in the  
 south, from Pitreavie Castle Base in  
 the east, to the beginning of Lord    
 Elgin's estate in the west.           
 Over the years, Dunfermline has       
 developed and enlarged.  That is why  
 the housing estates of Pitcorthie and 
 Izatt Avenue, among many other        
 buildings, have been built in the     
 north.  The Pitreavie Industrial      
 Estate in the middle of our area has  
 grown and developed in the past years.
 Although much farmland has been built 
 on, farming still goes on in our area.
 Running from the northwest to the     
 southeast are the railway and         
 Queensferry Road, crossing each other 
 at the beginning of Rosyth.
