		<title>01The Village of Halkirk</title>
		<content> Halkirk is one of the larger villages 
 in Caithness. Though it has many      
 amenities for a village in this       
 county, its proximity to the town of  
 Thurso means that its residents       
 generally commute for work &amp; shopping.
 Despite this, farming does play a     
 large part in the economic &amp; social   
 life of the village. The land is      
 relatively fertile by the standards of
 the county. The village is built in a 
 grid system &amp; has grown up by the     
 banks of the Thurso River, famous for 
 its salmon. There is a community      
 spirit in the village with many       
 activities taking place there. East of
 the village is Georgemas Junction, the
 most Northerly railway junction in    
 Britain, on the threatened Highland   
 Line. At the height of the tourist    
 season six trains a day pass through  
 here on their way to &amp; from Inverness.</content>
