		<content>      { TRAFFIC PROBLEMS               
 There are problems all over Dumfries  
 concerning traffic and pedestrians.On 
 the High Street there are many moving 
 vehicles which lead to noise and are  
 particularly dangerous on Saturdays.  
 The pavement on the West side of the  
 High Street is often over crowded.On  
 the High Street just below the        
 Midsteeple,parked cars on the cobbles 
 are visually intrusive.There is also a
 problem with Friars Vennel because    
 pavements are too narrow.Disabled     
 pedestrians have a nightmare of a time
 crossing roads in Dumfries as road    
 crossings are poor,especialy at the   
 English Street/Shakespeare Street     
 junction.
