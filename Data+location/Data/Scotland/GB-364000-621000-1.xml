		<title>01FROM CLEEKIMIN TO BONGATE</title>
		<content> The area north of Jedburgh to the     
 Cleekimin corner,and from Tudhope     
 to the Roman road,is mainly forested  
 and agricultural.                     
 Most farms have cattle and sheep,with 
 crops grown as feedstuffs.            
 The forested area is chiefly Lanton   
 Wood,but there are trees growing all  
 over the area,with hedges between the 
 fields and small plantations.         
 The months of July and August 1985 are
 proving the worst months in memory for
 rainfall.Some farms have still not got
 their hay in at the end of August.The 
 constant rain is making the fields    
 very muddy,and Combines are getting   
 bogged down.Some small farmers may not
 recover from the financial disaster.  
 Tourists are still calling in bus and 
 car at the Kiltmakers and Edinburgh   
 Woollen Mill,but the daily rain is    
 affecting the tourist trade.          </content>
