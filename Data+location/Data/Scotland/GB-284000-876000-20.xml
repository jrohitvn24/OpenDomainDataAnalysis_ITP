		<content> We interviewed a lady named Mary      
 Patience  in Hilton. She is 73 years  
 old and has lived in Hilton for 68    
 years.  She remembers when Hilton had 
 only two houses with a slated roof,   
 the rest had a thatch or clay roof. A 
 daily chore was fetching water from   
 the well as there was no water or     
 electricity supply.It was in 1949 and 
 1950 that these became available.     
                      Today the small  
 fisher houses have all been extended  
 and improved. She remembers when most 
 of the people were  Patience,Ross,    
 Skinner or Vass. Today she says that  
 she hardly knows a quarter of the     
 people she meets and where nearly     
 everyone was a relative they are now  
 stramgers. She remembers the poverty  
 of the people when she was young and  
 is pleased that her children are so   
 much better provided for.             </content>
