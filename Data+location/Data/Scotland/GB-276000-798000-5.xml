		<title>05FARMING IN BADENOCH - 2</title>
		<content> The farms in this area are either     
{owned}by the farmer or{leased,}the    
 lease usually being passed from father
 to son. Following a sound practical   
 upbringing on the farm many sons      
 (or daughters) now attend college or  
 university studying agriculture and   
 thus adding academic training to a    
 natural interest.  As the nearest vet 
 is based some{thirty}miles away these 
 farmers having benefitted from a broad
 education can cope with many animal   
 maladies on their own.                
                                       
{Stock sales}are held in nearby        
 Kingussie on{four}occasions each      
{autumn}by the Aberdeen and Northern   
 Mart. These sales are well attended   
 and are considered a social highlight 
 by farmers and shepherds, a rare      
 chance to catch up with friends, some 
 of whom live in quite isolated areas. </content>
