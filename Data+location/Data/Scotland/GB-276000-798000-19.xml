		<content> 1985 was also the{Girl Guide          
{Association Fiftieth Anniversary.} Two
 hundred Brownies and Girl Guides from 
 the Badenoch and Strathspey Division  
 came to the Museum on 21st June to    
 ccelebrate.  Games and guiding        
 activities were organised.  The{First 
{Aid}tent was staffed by a volunteer in
 nursing uniform of fifty years ago.   
 The{latrines,}dug especially for the  
 occasion and probably considered all  
 that was necessary fifty years ago    
 were avoided by our Brownies of today!
 The Portocabin toilet block was more  
 in keeping with the expetations of    
 Guiding in 1985.                      
 The successful day was drawn to a     
 close after{Taps was sung,}flags      
 lowered and lots of little  Brownies  
 and happy Girl Guides despatched home 
 by bus, some facing a journey home of 
 thirty miles.                         </content>
