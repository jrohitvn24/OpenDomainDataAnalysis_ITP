		<title>01LAURIESTON</title>
		<content> The area around Laurieston consists of
 pleasant grassy farmland,for pasture  
 and rough grazing.Cows and sheep are  
 the main livestock,with grass used for
 hay and silage.There are a few small  
 lochs ideal for fishing.The area is   
 well known by bird watchers who enjoy 
 bird watching by the lochs and        
 streams.Wildfowl are in abundance and 
 are a source of delight.There is,quite
 nearby, Laurieston Forest,owned by the
 Forestry Commission.This is a         
 delightful spot for walking  and      
 orienteering and ideal for picnics.The
 village itself is small,having        
 approximately 50 houses.There is a    
 village school with 26 children from 5
 to 11 years of age.There is no longer 
 a village church.The church at nearby 
 Balmaghie is used for worship.There is
 no shop,but the nearby town of Castle 
 Douglas is only some 6 miles away.    </content>
