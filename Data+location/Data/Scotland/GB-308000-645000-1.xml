		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO DOLPINTON</title>
		<content> Dolphinton is a rural village which   
 lies astride the main road between    
 Edinburgh and Biggar. The landscape   
 ranges from heather hill 1,600 feet   
 high, through varied woodland,        
 grassland, arable crops. Burns flow to
 River Tweed in the south-east and     
 River Clyde in the north-west. There  
 is a village hall, primary school,    
 church, part-time post office, but    
 unfortunately the village shop has    
 closed. During winter, Women's Rural, 
 Badminton and Carpet Bowling clubs are
 held in the hall. Population includes 
 30 pensioners, 100 adults, and 34     
 children. Employment is as farmers,   
 farm workers, and associated          
 industries eg. haulage. Half of the   
 adult workers travel outwith the      
 village to work. Farms are mixed beef,
 sheep and arable, with one dairy. For 
 150 years, the farms have been rented </content>
