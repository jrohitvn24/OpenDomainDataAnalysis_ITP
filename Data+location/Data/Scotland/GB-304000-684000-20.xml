		<title>20LANDSCAPES: SUMMARY</title>
		<content> The 12 square kilometres of study are 
 undergoing considerable change as they
 are on the fringe of a large urban and
 industrial area.                      
    Within the study squares there is  
 little employment, the pattern being  
 that of two large dormitory           
 settlements gradually eroding         
 surrounding farmland. The villages    
 have no particular centre, having     
 expanded gradually in the past along  
 main routeways, but with the growth of
 private house ownership in recent     
 years they have become communities of 
 some local importance.                
                                       
    Study undertaken by the class of   
 1W8, of Woodmill High School,         
 Dunfermline.
