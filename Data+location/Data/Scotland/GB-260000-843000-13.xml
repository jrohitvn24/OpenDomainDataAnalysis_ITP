		<title>13A FAMILY WEEKEND</title>
		<content>                                       
    On Saturdays my family gets up     
 quite early, we get dressed and have  
 breakfast. My mum runs a shop nearby  
 and she opens at 8.00 am on a         
 Saturday morning. While she's at the  
 shop, my sister and I play on the     
 computer for a while. At the weekend  
 we all help to feed the animals. I    
 feed the hens and ducks, my dad feeds 
 the horses, Tina feeds the geese,and  
 my mam feeds the dogs and the guinea  
 pigs.                                 
   When mam comes back from shop and   
 before lunch, we go to the supermarket
 in Inverness and buy food for the     
 weekend. Then we go home and after    
 lunch watch T.V. or play football. My 
 dad works on the croft in the         
 afternoon and my mam opens the shop   
 agein at 4.00 pm. In the evening we   
 have dinner and watch T.V.            </content>
