		<content>{Our School. }                         
      Our school is very old. Opened in
 1879, the building now has a new      
 porch, classroom, dining room and a   
 staff room added to the original      
 single room. The playground in front  
 of our school has been there ever     
 since the school was built, but now it
 is tarred so it is not rough and      
 stoney any more.                      
      There are two classrooms in our  
 school. In one classroom there are    
 primaries one, two, three and four. In
 the other room are primaries five, six
 and seven. We all have school dinners 
 and they cost fifty pence a day. We   
 have a main course and a pudding.     
 Sometimes we have soup. There is a    
 dinner lady who comes to school       
 to clean. Our dinners are brought     
 in a taxi from another school.
