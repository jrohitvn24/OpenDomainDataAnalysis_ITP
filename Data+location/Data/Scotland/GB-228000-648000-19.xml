		<title>19DALRY CIVIC WEEK</title>
		<content> The week began with the parade of     
 bands, floats and the Civic Queen's   
 horse and carriage.  The crowning of  
 the Queen took place in the town's    
 main square. The Queen presented      
 prizes to the best decorated float and
 the fancy dress winners at the Public 
 Park where the fete was held.         
 The Civic Week was planned to provide 
 entertainment for all age groups.     
 Children's parties, teenage discos,   
 old folks' concert and general        
 activities for all took place         
 including the Blair Gymkhana, and     
 displays of art, crafts and sports.   
 Many functions attracted people from  
 outside the town, particularly the    
 road race and car treasure hunt.      
 Sport was prominent in the week's     
 activities and the large numbers of   
 entrants, some taking part for the    
 first time, showed their popularity.  </content>
