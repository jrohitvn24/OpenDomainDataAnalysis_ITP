		<content> How the Recreation Centre is used.    
                                       
 On 14th June 1985 our class kept a    
 tally of persons using the centre     
 between 9.00am and 9.00pm. We found   
 that 1023 people used it in that time.
 We did a survey every ten minutes. 73 
 people took part in it. We found out  
 that most of those surveyed used it   
 for swimming (46) and badminton and   
 squash proved a second popular choice.
 It was also used for snooker, running,
 multi-gym, social activities, weight  
 training, fencing, life saving, and   
 the cafe facilities. The dog obediency
 class was very popular. The evening   
 was the busiest time. The majority of 
 people using the centre lived locally,
 about ten minutes on average away from
 it. We discovered that it was greatly 
 used by the people of Bo'ness who were
 glad it had been built in their town. </content>
