		<title>20EFFECTS OF ACID RAIN</title>
		<content>  {Acid Rain}affects all types of      
 plant and animal life either directly 
 or indirectly through food chains and 
 webs.Because the food chains and webs 
 are being upset the final consumers   
 such as Otters,Kingfishers and dippers
 are being severly affected.This is    
 because their food supply is being    
 removed.                              
   Any water below the acidity level of
{pH5}will not support the hatching of  
 salmon eggs,trout eggs etc.In{Galloway
 in early spring many of the rivers are
 pH5.It is possible that within ten    
 years salmon and trout will be        
 exctinct in some Galloway rivers.     
   It is not only  fish which are      
 destroyed in lakes and rivers.        
   When acid rain occurs  many metals  
 are released into the soil e.g        
 aluminium.High aluminium levels are   
 toxic to plants and humans.           </content>
