		<title>19RAFT RACE</title>
		<content> Every year,close to Gala Week, there  
 is the famous Raft Race down the River
 Tay between Kenmore and Aberfeldy.    
 Each raft,crewed by eight including a 
 female,paddles the six miles in       
 fierce,vocal competition.             
 Dozens of rafts take part,each with   
 distinctive markings and crew         
 uniforms.                             
 The parade before the Race decides the
 best decked raft and the crew with    
 'originality' in dress.               
 Many long hours can go into practice  
 for this prestigious event which is a 
 test of stamina and team spirit.      
 On the day of the Race,the area may   
 have as many as 20,000 visitors.      
 Emergency services are stepped up by  
 drafting from nearby areas for the    
 day.
