		<title>16SCHOOL GAMES IN SKERRIES</title>
		<content> At school we play games like{rounders,
{squash, football}and{teks.}This is how
 you play teks.                        
 You have everybody in a place called  
 The{Hole}except for the{catchie.}To   
 start off with the oldest person in   
 the Hole hits a ball as far as he or  
 she can. The catchie runs for the{ball
 while the other people are running    
 around the school. When the catchie   
 gets the ball he or she runs after the
 others and tries to hit them with the 
 ball. The others have to try to get to
 the Hole because they can't be caught 
 in the Hole. Anyone that is caught    
 joins the catchie and the game goes on
 until the people are all caught. We   
 play till it is time to go in to      
 school.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
