 Mr.Macdonald,postmaster at Gullane    
 Post Office,employs three postpersons 
 whose working day is 5.15am to 12.30pm
 The postboxes are emptied four times  
 per day.As old age pensions are paid  
 on Thursdays this is the busiest      
 day.Dogs can be a problem as in 1984 a
 Gullane postman had his ear bitten    
 off.                                  
 The Post Office offers dry cleaning   
 as a service and hires out videos,    
 horror movies being the most popular.
