		<content> Birds, such as greylag and pinkfoot   
 geese, brambling finches, field-fare  
 and redwing thrushes return from their
 breeding grounds in Greenland and     
 Iceland to spend only winter months   
 here.                                 
 Owing to the disappearance of mature  
 Scots Pine, caipercaillie have became 
 almost extinct in places where        
 formerly they thrived.                
 Sightings of Kingfishers are now      
 extremely rare events also. However,  
 crossbill numbers seem to be          
 increasing and the colourful green    
 woodpeckers have moved north,         
 establishing themselves in our        
 woodlands alongside greater spotted   
 woodpeckers. The severe winter of     
 1983/84 took a heavy toll of the long 
 tailed tit and wren populations.
