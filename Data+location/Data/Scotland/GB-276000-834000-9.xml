		<content>  I am 10 years old. My birth sign is  
 Libra. I have brown hair and blue     
 eyes. There are 6 people in my family.
 I have a mum and a dad, two brothers  
 and one sister. I have lived in Moy   
 all my life.                          
  When I have any spare time I play. I 
 like watching the A Team and Robin    
 Hood on television. My favourite food 
 is fruit. My favourite colour is      
 black.                                
  I have several friends. Dad works in 
 a quarry. I wouldn't mind any job if  
 it had a lot of money. I don't know if
 I would have to leave Moy for work. I 
 like living in Moy.
