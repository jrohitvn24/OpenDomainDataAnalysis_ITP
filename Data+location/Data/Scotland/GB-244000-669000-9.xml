		<content> The new Erskine library was opened on 
 the 4th June, 1985 by the Provost of  
 Paisley.  The library has a stock of  
 14,000 books and 2,000 records and    
 tapes.  There is a large selection of 
 books such as, fiction, non fiction,  
 picture books, reference books and    
 career information.  Books in large   
 print are available for those with    
 sight difficulties.  The library is   
 split into different sections.  There 
 is the adult section, junior section, 
 teenage section and the audio visual  
 and reference section.  As yet, the   
 library has no computer club but hopes
 to have one in the future.  It has one
 computer which members may book time  
 on.  The library is open six days of  
 the week.  It has four full time staff
 and two part time staff to deal with  
 the many people who will make good use
 of it.                                </content>
