 of 170 acres:- 45 barley, 125 grass

 is run by father, mother and daughter.
 We have a dairy herd of 43 cows,      
 Fresian and Ayrshire. We milk twice   
 daily, average yield per cow is 5512kg
 milk, 4.4% butter-fat, 3.59% protein, 
 recorded by Scottish Milk Recorder's  
 Association. Cows are housed in       
 cubicles, milk goes straight to bulk  
 tank by pipeline, then uplifted by    
 tanker daily and taken to Edinburgh   
 Dairy. In winter feed consists of     
 silage and barley/concentrate mix.    
 Summer feed is grass and cake, if     
 necessary. A.I. proven bulls are used 
 to improve stock, milk yields and     
 butterfat. Heifer calves are kept for 
 replacements, bulls are reared for    
 beef and sold at Lanark or Biggar     
 Market.                               </content>
