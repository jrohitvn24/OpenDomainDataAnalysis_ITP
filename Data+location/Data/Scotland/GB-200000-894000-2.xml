		<title>02CATTLE AND GOATS ON SCORAIG</title>
		<content> ON SCORAIG COWS ARE KEPT FOR MILKING  
 AND SELLING CALVES.THE MILKING COW IS 
 IMPORTANT AS IT SUPPLIES ITS OWN AND  
 NEIGHBOURS HOUSEHOLDS WITH MILK.MANY  
 PEOPLE MAKE THEIR OWN BUTTER AND      
 CHEESE.BEST MILKING COWS ARE JERSEY   
 CROSSES. BEEF COWS ARE SERVED BY A    
 BULL HIRED FROM THE AGRICULTURE DEPT. 
 EACH COW SHOULD PRODUCE ONE CALF A    
 YEAR.IN AUTUMN BULL CALVES ARE DRIVEN 
 12 MILES TO DUNDONNELL AND TAKEN BY   
 LORRY TO DINGWALL MARKET.HEIFER CALVES
 ARE SOMETIMES KEPT,SOMETIMES SOLD.    
    IN SUMMER THERE IS PLENTY OF HILL  
 GRAZING FOR THE CATTLE WHILE IN WINTER
 THEY ARE BROUGHT INTO THE CROFTS AND  
 FED HAY,STRAW,BRUISED BARLEY AND OTHER
 CONCENTRATES. A FEW PEOPLE KEEP GOATS 
 FOR THEIR MILK SUPPLY. THEY ARE       
 CHEAPER TO KEEP BUT ARE MORE          
 DESTRUCTIVE THAN COWS.
