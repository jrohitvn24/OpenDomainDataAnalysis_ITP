 predominantly in {FARMING,}although   
 some men still work for the {FORESTRY

 travel into Hawick to work in the{    
{KNITWEAR FACTORIES}or other jobs.Of   
 those employed in the area,diverse    
 occupations such as teachers, lorry   
 drivers,gamekeeper,librarian,nurse,   
 home-helps,building workers,potters,  
 were noted.There is virtually no

 virtually forced by circumstance to

 belong to employers.The local{

 varied;shepherds,tractormen,managers, 
 cattlemen.
