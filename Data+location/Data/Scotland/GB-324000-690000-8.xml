		<content>   There are over{7000 council owned   
 houses in our area,the first being    
 built in 1919.Although the council    
 builds an average 60 houses a year    
 there are still 1382 people on the    
 housing list.                         
   The{styles of houses}built have     
 changed in the last 50 years.Instead  
 of large houses for big families      
 smaller houses are now being built for
 single people and small families.     
 Kirkcaldy also has{108 sheltered      
 houses.                               
   10% of local authority housing has  
 been sold, the most popular being the 
 more modern cottage type houses.      
   There are well over{4000 privately  
{owned houses}in our area.Like the more
 modern council houses the private     
 houses are now built in estates.
