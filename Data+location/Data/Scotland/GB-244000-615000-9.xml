		<title>09EMPLOYMENT IN LITTLEMILL</title>
		<content> The area has become an{employment     
{black spot}with next to no industrial 
 development moving in to replace the  
 decaying traditional industry.{The    
{main employment of the area has always
{been coal mining but as the mines have
{closed,nothing has come in to replace 
{them.}Most people living in this area 
 who work have to travel in the region 
 of ten miles to find employment.Many  
 of the miners have taken advantage of 
 early retirement schemes to get out of
 the industry. There is also{limited   
{public transport}through the area so  
 travelling to seek employment is      
 difficult. Without employment running 
 a car is impossible so the people are 
 caught in a vicious circle.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
