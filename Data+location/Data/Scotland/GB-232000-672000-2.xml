		<content> When the shipbuilding industry was    
 established on the Lower Clyde, the   
 majority of the male population of    
 Port Glasgow were employed in this    
 industry. As the years progressed, and
 after flourishing, the industry       
 experienced a distinct decline, due to
 the lack of,and more recently the late
 completion of orders. The revelation  
 of the unfinished Britoil Rig,        
 revealed the attitudes of workers and 
 management. The yard faced closure,   
 and men faced redundancy and permanent
 unemployment. The inevitable happened 
 and privatisation resulted. Work was  
 available and the threat of mass      
 unemployment was reduced for the time 
 being, although many had been paid    
 off. It didn't last, as in May 1985   
 more redundancies were taken. The     
 situation deteriorated. Some people   
 blame the Government others the Unions</content>
