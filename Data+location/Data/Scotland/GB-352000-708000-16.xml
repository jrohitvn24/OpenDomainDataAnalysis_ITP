		<title>16INTERVIEW WITH FARMER (CONT)</title>
		<content> The soil is mixed. Fields are bordered
 mainly by fences but dry-stane dyking 
 is best.  There is little or no       
 woodland and the only water present on
 the farm is a burn which contains     
 minnows.                              
 He feels he can make a contribution to
 preserve what is good in the          
 countryside by looking after hedges.  
 He is interested in the wildlife in   
 his area and sees regularly rabbits,  
 hare, deer pigeons, crows, pheasants  
 and oyster catchers.                  
 Water comes from the main supply.     
 Electricity is used for cooking.  St. 
 Andrews is the main town for shopping.
  All houses on his land have running  
 water, electricity and inside         
 toilets.The main disease in crops is  
 mildew and the pest is leather        
 jackets. Chemical spray is the        
 treatment for both.                   </content>
