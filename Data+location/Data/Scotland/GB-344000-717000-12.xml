		<content> The Hungry Horse is a little shop on  
 the Cupar-St Andrews road. The shop   
 sells food, vegetables, fruit and     
 home-baking. It is a family           
 business and they get a lot of custom 
 in the summer, they also stay open for
 the winter. The Hungry Horse gets     
 a lot of passing trade especially with
 the holiday-makers, but also with some
 of the locals. The passing trade is   
 almost the same in winter. They would 
 consider expanding, but they don't    
 Know where to go to.  They take one   
 more person to help them in the       
 summer.  All the baking that is sold  
 at the "Hungry" is made at the "Hungry
 Horse".
