		<content> On the south east of Stranraer the    
 land cuts into the block.  Moving     
 south east the terrain is composed of 
 rolling fields of arable land.  The   
 majority of the block lies on the     
 isthmus which connects the Rhins to   
 the Machaars and is not above sea     
 level.  In square 12 of the block lies
 part of the runway of the adjoining   
 'West Freugh' airfield.  The area is  
 very flat with very few trees visible 
 but it is noted that this land is a   
 landing spot for wild geese coming    
 from the north such as Pinkfeet,      
 Greylags and Barnacles.  Flowing      
 through the block is 'Soulseat' and   
 Piltanton Burns.  There are secenteen 
 farms in the area and a number of     
 cottages housing mainly farm workers.
