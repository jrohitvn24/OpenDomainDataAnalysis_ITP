		<title>01THE WEST END,DUNDEE</title>
		<content>  The West End of Dundee is an area    
 of contrasts: to the south, along the 
 river, there is a ribbon of exclusive 
 stone-built housing which changes,    
 closer to the city centre, into a     
 mixture of tenement property and      
 factories. To the north-west, there is
 the modern housing development of     
 Menzieshill.                          
  Much of the older, decaying property,
 both industrial and domestic, is being
 rehabilitated: many of the huge,      
 monolithic mill areas are being       
 transformed into small factory units  
 and modern housing, as houses are     
 again being given priority near the   
 city centre.                          
  The area also contains 3 colleges,   
 the University, and 4 hospitals.      
 There is also a lot of open space:    
 Riverside airport, several parks and  
 the Law, which dominates the skyline. </content>
