		<title>15OUR COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT</title>
		<content> We were all very upset by the pictures
 and reports which came from Ethiopia  
 at the end of last year.We heard about
 the appeal for clothes and blankets   
 which Oxfam were making.We decided to 
 help.                                 
 We were given a pattern for very      
 simple jerseys from Oxfam and we and  
 our relations set about knitting as   
 many of these jerseys as we could.In  
 the end we managed to finish 20.      
 Then we started to knit 15cm. squares 
 which we had to sew up to make        
 blankets.Everybody worked very hard   
 and we managed to produce 6 blankets. 
 When we were finished we contacted    
 Oxfam and on Wednesday 29th of May Mrs
 Hamilton from the Ayr Oxfam shop came 
 to collect the blankets and           
 jerseys.She said that she was very    
 pleased that such a small community   
 could produce so much.We felt good.   </content>
