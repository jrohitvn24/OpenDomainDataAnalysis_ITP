		<title>01Two Banks of River Dee</title>
		<content> The River Dee twists and bends through
 this areaproviding a number of fishing
 pools. The main road, the North       
 Deeside Road is busy with tourists    
 particularly for skiing in the winter 
 and when the Queen is in residence at 
 Balmoral to the west of this area. The
 hills rise sharply beside the road    
 with coniferous trees giving way to   
 barer hills. The summit of Geallaig   
 Hill (white hill) is just to the north
 of the area. Some land has been       
 brought under cultivation on this side
 ad farming is the main source of      
 employment.                           
 The South Deeside road is narrower and
 more winding. This is in Abergeldie   
 estate and Abergeldie Castle stands   
 close to the Dee at the South Western 
 corner. The preent laird lives here   
 and is a working farmer. There are few
 houses on this side of the river.     </content>
