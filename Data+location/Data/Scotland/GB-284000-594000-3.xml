		<content>   Brilliant yellow fields were seen   
 for the first time this year in       
 Nithsdale. These are fields of oilseed
 rape. Almost 10% of the land around   
 Thornhill is growing this crop in     
 response to subsidies offered by the  
 E.E.C.. Planted in the autumn it was  
 in full flower during the survey in   
 June and, after the seed pods ripen,  
 it will be mowed in swathes, then     
 combined. The seeds are to be         
 processed into vegetable oil and the  
 remains of the plant ploughed back    
 into the soil to enrich it.           
   Another new crop in 1985 is the     
 protein pea which covers 4% of the    
 land around Thornhill. This is a low  
 growing pea which will be harvested   
 and used to enrich the farmers animal 
 fodders. Being of the pea family it   
 also improves the soil.
