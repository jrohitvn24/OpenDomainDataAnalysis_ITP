		<title>10CROSSFORD SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Crossford School was opened at its    
 present site in 1973, previously      
 sharing a site with Cairneyhill       
 pupils. (see page 8) In 1984-5 the    
 school educated {159}boys and {166    
 girls, in 11 classes, although a 12th 
 class, plus a new nursery class, will 
 have to be added in 1985-6. The school
 role has grown steadily from{227}in   
 1974, to its present total, as        
 Crossford village has expanded, and   
 now a staff of 11 permanent teachers, 
 1 teaching auxiliary, 1 learning      
 support teacher, and visiting teachers
 of P.E., music, art, and stringed     
 instruments, are required for the     
 school to properly function.          
   The pupils come from within a 2 mile
 range of Crossford, 170 staying       
 regularly for school lunch, cooked on 
 the premises, and 70 bringing a packed
 lunch. (continued on page 11)         </content>
