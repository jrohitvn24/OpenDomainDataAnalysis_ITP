		<content> It is we who have attempted this      
 coverage for the Domesday Project. We 
 have tried to span for you, the age   
 groups, opinions and activities of the
 people who live in this shoe box of a 
 valley, with its two high sides and   
 two low sides.{But remember, while you
{delve into our four squares, that what
{is described in one, can occur in     
{others too.                           
 Remember that we are people of the    
 post industrial age and transition to 
 an information age is barely possible 
 to grasp.  We ask you to bear with us,
 therefore, to forgive us leaving out  
 that which you would dearly have      
 wished to see.                        
 We've learnt a lot about ourselves and
 our surroundings and{we thank the BBC 
{for the invitation to take part, and  
{also William the Conqueror for giving 
{them the idea.                        </content>
