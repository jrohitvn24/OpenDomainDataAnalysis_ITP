		<content> The area lies south of busy A96       
 Inverness to Aberdeen Rd. The B9103 to
 Cranloch passes through a fertile area
 of mixed farmland with some forestry  
 and commercial woodland. It is        
 dominate by the Blackbills Estate     
 belonging to the Christie family since
 1900.  While there were once 24       
 farms there are now five averaging    
 about 250acres but a trend away from  
 the depopulation of the 40s and 50s is
 beginning to show with families slowly
 moving back. Some farms are primarily 
 pastoral Clackmaison for example      
 situatedd in the only small community 
 here of some 16 houses has a 300acre  
 dairy farm with 200 head of cattle. An
 interesting development is scotsburn  
 fruit farm where Baxters of speyside  
 grow raspberries, strawberries and    
 vegetables for their factory. They    
 operate a pick yor own fruit facility.</content>
