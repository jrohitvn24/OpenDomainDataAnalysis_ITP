		<title>06THE CHURCH IN DAIRSIE</title>
		<content> Dairsie church was built in 1848.In   
 1928 St.Leonards in Dairsie and       
 St.Marys nearby joined congregations  
 under one minister.  St.Marys was used
 in summer because most people lived in
 Dairsie and they had quite a long way 
 to walk and they didn't want to go    
 down in the winter, St.Leonards was   
 much handier then. When it was decided
 that they would only use one church,  
 and St.Leonards was chosen,the people 
 had to work really hard to make it    
 comfortable and waterproof.  They took
 pews,pulpit and choir stalls from     
 St.Marys so they had something from   
 each chruch.  The renovated church was
 used for services in December 1966.   
 There is a house in Station Road      
 called "St.Leonards" which used to be 
 the manse.  Dairsie manse is now the  
 one belonging to St.Marys.  I live in 
 it as my dad is Rev.A. Strickland.    </content>
