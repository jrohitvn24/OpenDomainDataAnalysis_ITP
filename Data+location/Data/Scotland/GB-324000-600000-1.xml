		<title>01THE PARISH OF ESKDALEMUIR.</title>
		<content>  Eskdalemuir, the largest parish in   
 Dumfriesshire lies in the north       
 eastern corner of the county.It covers
 the upper part of the River Esk.Its   
 altitude varies form 650ft to 2270ft  
 at Ettrick Pen at the head of the     
 valley.It has been heavily            
 glaciated,hence its characteristic    
 rounded hills with gentle slopes.     
  Originally covered by primaeval      
 forest it was cleared of timber by the
 ninteenth century, and given over to  
 sheep farming.                        
  Now in 1980's due to afforestation   
 started by the Forestry Commission in 
 1938 and also the Economic Forestry   
 Group in                              
 1965, there remain only seven sheep   
 farms including some integrated       
 forestry and farming estates.
