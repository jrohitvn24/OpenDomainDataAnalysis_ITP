 In 1920, a memorial to the 1100       
 soldiers and sailors who had died in  
 the 1914-18 war was planned.  The     
 chosen site was a 300' high hill, a   
 prominent position in Bennadrove,     
 north of the town of Stornoway.  The  
 memorial was constructed in the form  
 of a Scottish Baronial Tower, 85' high
 on a square base.  The tower tapered  
 on up to its height to reach parapets 
 and a circular turret containing a    
 spiral staircase from which could be  
 seen the parishes of the island to    
 which the dead men belonged.  Bronze  
 plaques in Gaelic and English were    
 unveiled in a dedication ceremony in  
 Sept.1924.  More plaques were erected 
 to commemorate those who fell in the  
 1939-45 war.  The memorial is open to 
 the public daily.
