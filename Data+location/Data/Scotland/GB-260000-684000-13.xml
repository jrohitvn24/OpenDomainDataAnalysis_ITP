		<title>13The Garage: FINTRY</title>
		<content>                                       
 The presence of a garage in a small   
 rural community with little public    
 transport is vital, yet its survival  
 depends on its ability to diversify.  
                                       
 Petrol sales are equally divided      
 between local and passing trade,      
 70,000 gallons being sold annually.   
 Servicing and repair work is also     
 split between local and other clients.
                                       
 A mini-bus is contracted to take      
 children from the outlying farms and  
 houses to Fintry and Balfron Schools. 
                                       
 Lastly Post Office work. Collection,  
 sorting and delivery. A 7 hour task   
 over 45 miles, which can take a long  
 time in heavy winter snow!            
                                       
                                       </content>
