		<title>08MY SATURDAY</title>
		<content>   On Saturday I get up early, go to   
 the toilet and then back to my room,  
 brush my hair and bring a pillow into 
 the living_room where I watch         
 television until noon.                
   I then have my breakfast, get       
 dressed and go out to play - perhaps  
 at football. After lunch I take my dog
 Shane for a walk around Hogganfield   
 Loch then return home to share a game 
 of pool or darts with my brother.     
 After tea, I usually go outside to    
 play  and get called in at 9.45 p.m.  
   When I get into the house I am fed  
 again. Then I get my nightie on and   
 watch the Saturday Film on television.
 After the film, I'm always tired, so I
 drop into bed. Before you know it, I'm
 asleep.
