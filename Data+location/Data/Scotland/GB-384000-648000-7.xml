		<content> THE BORDERS REGIONAL COUNCIL IS TRYING
 TO CLOSE ALL THE ONE-TEACHER SCHOOLS. 
  THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COUNCIL AND THE  
 PARENTS HAVE PUT UP A STRONG FIGHT TO 
 KEEP WHITSOME SCHOOL OPEN.   THEY HAVE
 HAD MEETINGS WITH THE REGIONAL        
 COUNCIL.   WE HAVE JUST HEARD THAT THE
 SCHOOL IS TO REMAIN OPEN FOR THREE    
 YEARS TO ALLOW SWINTON SCHOOL (THE    
 SCHOOL THAT WE MIGHT BE GOING TO IF   
 WHITSOME CLOSES) TO BE MODERNISED.    
 THE LOCAL PEOPLE FEEL THE VILLAGE     
 WOULD LOSE ITS COMMUNITY SPIRIT IF THE
 SCHOOL WERE TO CLOSE, SO THEY WOULD BE
 VERY PLEASED IF IT STAYS OPEN.
