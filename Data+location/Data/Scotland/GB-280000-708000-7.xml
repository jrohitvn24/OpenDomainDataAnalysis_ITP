 The higher ground is used for grazing{
{Sheep}and{Cattle. }These animals go to
 the {KILDEAN  MARKET}in{STIRLING.}This
 is held on Thursdays. The animals are 
 auctioned. Some are sold on their own,
 some in groups. First they are weighed
 and then they go into the ring. Once  
 they have been sold they are marked so
 that they can't be sold again by      
 mistake. Sometimes the sheep jump over
 the gates and go every where. After   
 they are sold some animals go to the  
 slaughter house.
