		<title>03THE CHURCH OF SAINT QUIVOX</title>
		<content>  Dalmilling Church, part of the Old   
 Parish Church at Auchincruive was     
 built as a church extension project   
 and was opened during 1953.           
  Over the years it has become a very  
 important part of St.Quivox Parish.As 
 it is a church extension building,it  
 is very well suited to cater for the  
 many organisations connected with the 
 church.These include{Young Women's    
{Group,Woman's Guild,Men's Club,Junior 
{and Senior Boys' Brigade,Brownies     
{and Girl Guides.}                     
  During the year there are services on
 Sunday mornings at 10.30a.m. Children 
 who attend Sunday School are taught in
 the{Wilson Hall,}the latest addition  
 to Dalmilling Church.                 
  In the twenty-two years since it has 
 been in existence,this church is most 
 certainly a busy and essential part of
 the community.                        </content>
