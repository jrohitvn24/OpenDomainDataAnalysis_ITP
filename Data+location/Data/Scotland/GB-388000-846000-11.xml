		<title>11Playground Games, New Deer</title>
		<content>   Some of the games played in the     
 school playground at New Deer are     
 catching games like British Bulldogs, 
 Join the Crew and Steps. Usually the  
 person caught becomes "the man" for   
 the next game.                        
   Queeny-Queeny Coco is a ball        
 catching game where one person throws 
 a ball and everyone pretends to have  
 it, calling "Queeny-Queeny Coco who's 
 got the ball?I haven't got it in my   
 pocket. Queeny-Queeny Coco who's got  
 the ball?" The "man" has to guess who 
 has the ball.                         
   Some skipping games are;"High, Low, 
 Medium, Slow, Rocky, Dolly, Pepper,   
 Wish", "Cinderella dressed in yellow" 
 and "Cowboy Joe from Mexico". Some    
 skipping games are for one person,    
 some are for two or more and some use 
 two ropes.                            
                                       </content>
