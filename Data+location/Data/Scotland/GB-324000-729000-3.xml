		<content> Eastern Ballindean Nursery is a small 
 market garden of 5 acres.There is an  
 old wall around it that was built in  
 1772.In 1946 the present owner started
 his market garden there.He grows      
 Gooseberries,Brambles,Blackcurrants,  
 Tayberries,Strawberries &amp; Redcurrants 
 that grow up the walls.At one time he 
 sent his produce to market but now his
 customers come to his garden to buy.He
 employs children from Inchture to pick
 his crops in their School Holiday.His 
 crops have changed over the years from
 fresh flowers and bulbs to soft fruits
 He works on his own with 2 tractors   
 and 1 sprayer.The Pick Your Own Garden
 at East Ballindean next door doesn't  
 affect his trade. He only uses one of 
 his glasshouse now for some pot plants
 that he grows for fun to sell. He has 
 to buy his new stock from the "Nuclear
 Stock Association".                   </content>
