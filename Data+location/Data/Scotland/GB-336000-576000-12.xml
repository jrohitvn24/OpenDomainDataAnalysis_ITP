		<title>12Claygate Hamlet</title>
		<content> Seventy years ago Claygate hamlet had 
 a general store and a blacksmith's    
 shop. In more recent years the store  
 had three vans which provided for     
 outlying farms, and provided          
 employment for seven people  in all.  
 The shop closed in 1958 and it and the
 blacksmith's are now dwellings.       
                                       
 Claygate also had its own school at   
 Gilnockie, but this closed in 1978 and
 the children were sent to the school  
 in Canonbie village. There are at     
 present only three children of primary
 school age in the hamlet and          
 surrounding area.                     
                                       
 There was also a station on the       
 Carlisle to Langholm branch line but  
 this is also a dwelling now.          
 Apart from farms there is no          
 employment of any sort in Claygate.   </content>
