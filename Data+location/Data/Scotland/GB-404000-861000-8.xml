{St.Combs Gala}is a fairly recent      
 event, the first one was held in{1975,
 which takes place every year in the   
 month of{June.}The idea behind the    
{Gala}was to raise funds for two       
 changing rooms with showers to replace
 an old nissen hut.It lasted{two days  
 and made a profit of Â£700.Because of  
 the success they decided to make it an
 annual event and instead of two       
 changing rooms they were able to get a
 hall,showers etc..The total cost was  
{Â£63,000}the playing commitee having to
 find{25%}of this,the rest being met by
 outside grants.The{Gala}itself is a   
 great success covering a radius of    
 about twenty miles,entrants from such 
 places as{Crimond,Fraserburgh etc..   
 Activities include{football,netball,  
{tug o war,discos,fancy dress and some 
{stalls.}A great week is had by all..  </content>
