		<title>07Buckhaven Primary School</title>
		<content>      Buckhaven Primary School,which   
 was built in 1915,was officially      
 opened in June 1985! Because of the   
 First World War, there could be no    
 official celebrations in 1915.        
      A modernisation programme costing
 nearly half a million pounds was      
 started in 1983.The renovations were  
 finished in 1985 and they thought it  
 would be a good time to open the      
 school officially.                    
      Parents,councillors,William      
 Moodie,the Chief Constable of Fife who
 is a former pupil of Denbeath School, 
 and the Rev Dean Sheppard attended the
 re-opening ceremony.                  
      The renovations changed some of  
 the school completely.Individual      
 classrooms were converted to double   
 unit areas and an open nursery,with an
 observation room for parents, was     
 created.                              </content>
