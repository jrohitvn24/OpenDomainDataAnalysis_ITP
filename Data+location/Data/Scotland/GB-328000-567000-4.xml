 350 pupils in the school.

 didn't live in Gretna until he was in 
 his teens.The old school had coal     
 fires which he attended to every      
 day.The corridors were usually dark   
 because the small windows didn't let  
 in much light.The classrooms had two  
 large windows and wooden floors.There 
 were monkeybars in the playground.The{
{old school}was fully demolished in{   
{1981}.
