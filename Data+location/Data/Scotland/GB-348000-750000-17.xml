		<content> The quarrying at Fledmyre has changed 
 the{landscape.                        
 Some of the{water supply}for          
 processing the sand and gravel is     
 taken from the bog at Pitscandly and  
 the rest is pumped from the ground to 
 the quarry.  The clean water is pumped
 into a pool about 30 feet deep.  Then 
 it is taken from the pool and put into
 a machine which washes the silt off   
 the sand and gravel.  The silt and    
 dirty water are put into holes which  
 form sludge beds.  As they are        
 quarrying they are continuously{      
{infilling}the land by topping up the  
 holes with rubbish and{restoring}the  
 land by putting black top soil on the 
 top so the farmer can reclaim it.     
 Meanwhile the owner of the land       
 receives royalties for every ton of   
 sand and gravel which leaves the      
 quarry.                               </content>
