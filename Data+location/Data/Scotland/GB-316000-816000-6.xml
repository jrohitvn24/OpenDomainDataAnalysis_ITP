		<content> People in Tomintoul work in a variety 
 of occupations. Quite a few are       
 employed in the hotels and shops in   
 the village. There are four food      
 shops, a woodcarver's, a weaver's, and
 a pottery shop. There are four hotels 
 in Tomintoul. They are The Gordon     
 Arms, The Richmond Arms, The Glenavon 
 and The White Heather. In the spring  
 of 1984, The White Heather was badly  
 damaged by fire.                      
 There are two farms near the village. 
 One is Findron and the other is       
 Fordmouth. Also three distilleries    
 employ people from our village. They  
 are Tamnavoulin, Tomintoul and The    
 Glenlivet.
