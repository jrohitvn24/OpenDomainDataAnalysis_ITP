		<content> Muirhead is the most heavily populated
 area in our block.It has a post       
 office, a police station, a school, a 
 garage, a scout hall, church and three
 shops.There is also a large wood      
 called Backmuir wood which contains a 
 large selection of wildlife such as   
 deer, rabbits, birds and many         
 others.There is a population in excess
 of 1500 people.Muirhead is a          
 traditional village, not like Liff or 
 Fowlis with plenty of recreation      
 facilities such as the park which has 
 two football pitches and some play    
 apparatus and also a tennis court.Next
 door to this is situated a bowling    
 green.
