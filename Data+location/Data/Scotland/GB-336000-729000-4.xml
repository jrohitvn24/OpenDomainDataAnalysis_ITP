		<title>04CAMPERDOWN WORKS,DUNDEE</title>
		<content>  {Jute}has been a dominant part of    
 industry in Dundee, but other textiles
 have become of increasing importance. 
  {Camperdown Works}was owned by the   
{Cox Brothers,}one of the famous jute  
 families. The works employed 5000     
 workers and produced 30 - 40 million  
 square yards of cloth per annum.      
 A famous Dundee landmark -{Cox's Stack
 - is in the centre of the works.      
  This chimney is{282 feet high;}it is 
 made of over{1 million bricks}and cost
{Â£6000}to build in 1865.  it can be    
 seen{60 miles}away.                   
   The Works are now a development site
 for modern housing and new industrial 
 units, but many  think that the Stack 
 should remain as a unique example of  
 industrial architecture and a tribute 
 to the{jute industry}that made Dundee 
 wealthy last century. One possible use
 is as the gnomon of a giant sundial!  </content>
