		<content> In Midmar adults have to entertain    
 themselves as there are no swimming   
 pools, no cinemas, theatres, no       
 community centres or sports           
 complexes.They tend their             
 gardens,visit friends, go shooting,   
 fishing, play golf and some people go 
 to play squash but they have to travel
 at least fifteen miles to the nearest 
 centre (Aboyne or Alford.)Children    
 also have to entertain themselves.They
 watch TV, play on their computers,they
 also play monopoly, card games or     
 other board games.Some children have  
 bicycles or motorbikes and there is   
 plenty of room to play on them.We have
 a village hall and there is keepfit,  
 discos, W.R.I and a Youth Club held in
 it.Senior Citizens also go there for  
 meetings once a month.There is going  
 to be an "Information Technology      
 Centre"in Alford.                     </content>
