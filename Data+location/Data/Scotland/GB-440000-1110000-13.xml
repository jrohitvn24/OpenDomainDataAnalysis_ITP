		<title>13CHANGING TIMES:POPULATION</title>
		<content>  The indigenous people in our area are
 desended from the Scandinavians and   
 the Mainland Scots who have settled in
 our area over the centuries. Before   
 the "employment boom" of the mid 1970s
 the population was in decline, many   
 young people left Sumburgh and        
 Shetland to seek jobs.                
   When the airport was expanded to    
 meet the demands of the North Sea Oil 
 Industry many jobs were available.    
 People were attracted from all over   
 Shetland, Scotland and England.       
 However due to long range helicopters 
 the traffic at the airport has        
 decreased and the number of people    
 employed and living in the area has   
 fallen.                               
   The population stands at about 300  
 people.
