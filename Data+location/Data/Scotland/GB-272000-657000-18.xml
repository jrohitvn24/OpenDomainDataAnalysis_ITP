		<content> We have decided to describe just 2 of 
 the 53 games we at first listed.  {   
{KERBY}is played by 2 people standing  
 on opposite sides of a road.  One     
 throws the ball and if it hits the    
 kerb and bounces back he scores a     
 point.  He then gets another turn.  If
 he misses the kerb the other player   
 gets the ball. {ELASTICS - TRIANGLESIE
 is a jumping game using three elastic 
 bands tied together. 3{enders}form a  
 triangle with the bands.  At least 2  
{jumpers}are needed.  The bands are    
 jumped in 3 ways:{gallop}(large steps)
{jump}and{hop.} In the first round the 
 jumper lands between the bands.  The  
 second time she lands on the bands.   
 The height of the bands is increased  
 from ankle height to waist height.    
 When a jumper fails, she becomes an   
 ender.                                
                                       </content>
