		<content> The local Primary School was{built in 
{1860}by Carnegie of Stronvar. It      
 accommodated in one main room upto 60 
 children aged from 5 to 14 years. In  
 1965 the school was extended and at   
 that time it had two teachers and     
 accommodated 32 children aged from 5  
 to 11 years. For the last decade the  
 school has had a{single teacher}and   
 presently has a{roll of 16 children.  
 The children come from up to 6 miles  
 away and all but three children are   
 conveyed to school by taxi, the taxi  
 driver being a local farmer. The      
 community takes a great deal of       
 interest in the school and is very    
 supportive. At Christmas and          
 Hallowe'en parties are given for the  
 children in the village hall and the  
 local people delight in attending     
 school functions.
