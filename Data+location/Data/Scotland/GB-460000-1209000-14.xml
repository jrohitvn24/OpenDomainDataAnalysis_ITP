		<content> Inhabitants living in this block enjoy
 greater contact with the 'outside     
 world'than 30 years ago. A direct     
 airlink to Tingwall (mainland         
 Shetland) has been achieved by        
 Loganair, who also cater for hospital 
 emergency flights. The Ro-Ro          
 inter-island ferries similarily link  
 Unst to the mainland (via Yell).A     
 reduced timetable is operated in      
 winter, and there are no regular late 
 night ferries. A recent proposal to   
 extend the ferry service has been met 
 by strong disapproval locally, as     
 these late ferries  were offered as an
 alternative solution to building a    
 Sports Centre in Unst. The            
 impractibility of using the Lerwick   
 (clickamin Centre) regularly is       
 evident: travelling time from Unst for
 the round trip being almost 6 hours.
