		<content> As well as being one of the main      
 tourist attractions,Talisker          
 Distillery provides all year          
 employment in the village.The malt    
 whisky made here is known for its     
 special flavour which many say owes   
 much to the peat flavoured water from 
 the nearby Carbost Burn.              
 Many local people were concerned at   
 recent problems in the whisky         
 industry,causing cutbacks in          
 production and even the closure of    
 distilleries.                         
 However the future seems reasonably   
 bright,since the company has been     
 taken over and lots of renovation work
 has been done.There is now a          
 Visitor's Centre,a car park,and a shop
 in which the whisky is sold.This      
 should increase the present           
 popularity.
