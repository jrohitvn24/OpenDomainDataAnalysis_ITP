		<title>05THURSO RIVER AND HARBOUR</title>
		<content>{  Thurso's}growth by the side of the  
 river was associated with the fishing,
 farming and flagstone industries.     
   Though there are no commercial boats
 now in the river harbour there was    
 a time when it was a busy estuary.    
   Ships loaded Caithness Flagstone and
 carried it to all corners of the world
 and returned with many products       
 including coal to heat the{Thurso     
 homes and the nearby{Thurso Castle.   
   The river is at present the centre  
 of the local salmon fishing industry  
 and in what is left of the old harbour
 are moored a number of boats owned by 
 part-time fishermen. They fish        
 in the summer for crab, lobster, cod, 
 haddock and any other species of fish 
 that they can catch.                  
  A fishing permit for{Thurso River}for
 salmon and trout is available for     
 local and tourist alike.              </content>
