{WELL-}Villagers at the beginning of   
 this century relied on six or seven   
 stand pipes in various parts of the   
 village for their water. These stand  
 pipes were cylindrical in shape, with 
 a dome-shaped lid. On the front of the
 well,the water came out of a spout,   
 around which was a lion's head. This  
 gave these wells the name{Lions' Head 
{Wells.}  Villagers used the wells as  
 meeting points where people would     
 discuss what had been happening in    
 Star. Often, it was the children's job
 to fetch the water. They played tricks
 on each other by turning the handle on
 full when someone was having a drink, 
 so soaking the person having a drink. 
 In 1984 there was only one well left  
 at the East End of Star, outside a    
 ruined stone cottage which had once   
 been lived in by{Duncan Rutherford. } </content>
