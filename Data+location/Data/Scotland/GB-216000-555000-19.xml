		<title>19FARMING IN GLENLUCE</title>
		<content> The warm, moist{climate}of the area   
 supports a thriving agriculture.      
 Winters are comparatively mild and the
 growing season protracted.  Besides   
 being in Scotland's premier{dairying  
 county Glenluce is the hub of a       
 district boasting several{different   
{enterprises,}such as beef, sheep, pig 
 rearing and fattening, barley and     
 potato growing.  Dairy cattle are     
 mostly Friesian and Ayrshire, whilst  
 the beef breeds of Galloway, Hereford 
 and Irish Blues are often crossed with
 more exotic strains such as Charolais,
 Holstein, Simmental and Romagnola.    
{Galloway beef is renowned.}Farmers    
 have few labourers permanently working
 for them now, but employ casual labour
 at busy times like silage and harvest.
 Recent {milk quotas}introduced by the 
 European Common Market have curtailed 
 the production of milk.               </content>
