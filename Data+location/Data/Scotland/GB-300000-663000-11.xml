		<content> The houses in West Calder are made of 
 bricks.The houses in Polbeth are also 
 made of bricks,but some have wood     
 layen on top of them.Some are small   
 bungalows,some are large detached and 
 others are terraced or                
 semi-detached.There are 2 new housing 
 estates in West Calder ,one is        
 finished building and the other has   
 just to build a few more.The houses in
 West Calder and Polbeth have coal     
 fires,electric radiators or gas       
 heating.At the moment the council are 
 upgrading the houses in Polbeth they  
 are refitting the kitchens and the    
 bathrooms putting in gas or electric  
 radiators and in the end they will    
 paint and paper the whole house.About 
 half of the houses are bought and the 
 rest are rented.
