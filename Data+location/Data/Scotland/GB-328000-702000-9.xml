		<title>09LOCAL HISTORY-WELL (cont.)</title>
		<content> Mr. Milne, Mr. Walker, Mr. Coles, Mr. 
 Whitton. Mr. Wands, the local plumber,
 connected the well to the school water
 supply and Joe, a retired builder, put
 whinstones and setts around the base  
 of the well.  Environmental Health    
 tested the water from the well and    
 said it was suitable for drinking.    
 These wells were manufactured in      
{Kilmarnock},by{Glenfield and Kennedy. 
 We visited{North Queensferry}to see a 
 similar well at the foot of the       
 'brae'. It was painted green and      
 yellow. Another well was discovered at
{Newton of Falkland,}by one of yhe     
 pupils, Andrew Cooper. It looked in   
 the same conditions as ours, before we
 restored it. The well is now part of  
 our school badge. In September 1985,  
 one of our parents, Mrs. Kenney,      
 painted a scene showing life as it    
 would have been when the well was used</content>
