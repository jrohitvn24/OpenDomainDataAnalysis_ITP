		<content>   The village of{Lhanbryde}is situated
 on the{A96},8km west of Fochabers and 
 5km east of Elgin in Morayshire.      
   From Elgin Cathedral records we know
 that there has been a village on this 
 site since at least the 13th century. 
   In the 19th.century  it boasted  3  
 mills,2 schools,a smithy,a bakery,    
 shops,tailors,an hotel,Post Office    
 and a Railway Station.                
   Up until the middle of this century 
{housing}was confined to the main road 
 and two side streets  but Post War    
 building,both private and local       
 authority, mainly to the north of the 
 A96,has increased the{population}to   
 its present 2000.                     
   Now,although the village is larger, 
 it has no local industry being merely 
 a dormitory for Elgin.                
   The railway lies to the south of the
{A96}but the station has gone.         </content>
