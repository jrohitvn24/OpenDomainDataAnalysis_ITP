		<content>  There is only{one industrial estate} 
 in the area.It is located in the      
 valley of the White Cart Water.It is  
 an{old estate}which dates back to the 
 days when water powered the textile   
 industry.The last mill closed in 1900.
  Some old mill buildings have been{   
 renovated.On the west bank there is a 
{renovated mill}called Lower Mill which
 is occupied by an accountants office  
 and a plumber.There is a builders yard
 and a roofing contractor on this site.
  The White Cart estate on the east    
 bank contains a Steel Stockyard, a    
 timber yard,a car repairer and        
 scrapyard,a shoe factory and offices. 
  As the industrial estate was built   
 before Busby became a suburb the      
{houses}and{factories}are close        
 together.The most recently built      
 houses can only be reached via the    
 entrance of the industrial estate.    </content>
