		<title>01Cir Mhor &amp; Arran Ridges</title>
		<content> Glen Sannox runs through this area a  
 very spectacular glaciated valley.    
 It is a characteristic "U" shape with 
 a flat floor and steep sides.   At the
 head of the glen is Cir Mhor a steep  
 and rocky mountain popular with both  
 walkers and climbers.   The hills of  
 Suidhe Fhearfhas and the castlen are  
 on the western side of the valley.    
 These two hills are separated by the  
 Witches step a deep "V" shaped valley 
 incision in the ridge where a softer  
 rock has been eroded faster than the  
 granite.   The A Cir ridge is part of 
 this area, and it is one of the three 
 most dangerous in Scotland, due to it 
 being very rocky and exposed.   Nobody
 lives here because of the boggy and   
 mountainous terrain.   The whole area 
 is both a site of special scientific  
 interest and a national scenic area.  
 Part of the land is owneed by the NTS.</content>
