		<title>05Weir's of Cathcart</title>
		<content> Weirs was founded in 1886 by James and
 George Weir.  At that time it was only
 a small machine shop but through the  
 years it has grown larger and larger  
 and now there are two thousand people 
 working in the Cathcart Plant alone.  
 Altogether Weirs employs about ten    
 thousand people.                      
   Weirs has factories scattered all   
 over the world, the largest factory   
 being in Cathcart.  Pumps are         
 manufactured for ships, submarines and
 the oil industry, and even pumps that 
 flush the toilet.  It takes from two  
 weeks to two and a half years to build
 a pump.  There are thirty five        
 cleaners in the Cathcart factory.     
 Weirs have associates in Spain,       
 France, Nottingham, India and two in  
 Saudi Arabia as well as one in Canada.
 Pumps are not mass produced as each   
 order is manufactured separately.     </content>
