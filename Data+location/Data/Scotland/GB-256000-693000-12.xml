		<title>12BUCHLYVIE COMMUNITY COUNCIL</title>
		<content>  The first{BUCHLYVIE COMMUNITY COUNCIL
 was formed in{1978}with seven members 
 elected by ballot. The Council meets  
 quarterly to discuss village matters  
 and residents may bring items which   
 concern them for consideration and    
 possible action. One of the primary   
 tasks which the council has undertaken
 since its inception is that of        
 improving the appearance and amenities
 of the village. With this objective in
 mind, a number of small projects have 
 been undertaken. Trees, shrubs, bulbs,
 and heathers have been planted in     
 various sites in and around the       
 village and large tubs and containers 
 of flowers situated in suitable spots.
 Residents responded by putting window 
 boxes and hanging baskets outside     
 their homes with the result that      
 Buchlyvie won an award as{THE BEST    
{KEPT VILLAGE IN THE WEST OF SCOTLAND. </content>
