		<content>   There is a great variation in land  
 use here. Garthamlock, Ruchazie and   
 Craigend are densly packed council    
 housing schemes with few amenities.   
 Millerston is mainly private housing. 
   To the disbelief of local teenagers,
 the foundations of private houses have
 been laid between Craigend and        
 Garthamlock in place of council houses
 demolished a few years ago. The       
 schemes enclose a stretch of wetland, 
 unused moorland and rough grazing.    
   The main local industry,{Cardowan   
{Colliery,}closed in 1983, increasing  
 unemployment and leaving further waste
 land. This leaves only the{Black and  
{White whisky}bottling plant in Stepps 
 to provide local work.                
   Round the housing schemes lie farm  
 land and{Hogganfield Park,}which has a
 loch and bird sanctuary. This provides
 some contrast for those living here.  </content>
