		<title>06COUSLAND'S LOCAL POLICEMAN.</title>
		<content> P.C.BOB BAIRD,WHO HAS BEEN IN THE     
 FORCE FOR 13 YEARS,HAS BEEN THE       
 COMMUNITY POLICEMAN FOR TWO MONTHS.HIS
 AREA COVERS COUSLAND,EDGEHEAD,FALA    
 AND PATHHEAD-VILLAGES SOUTH OF DALK-  
 EITH.                                 
 HE PATROLS HIS AREA ON A 50CC. MOPED, 
 WHICH IS SLOW,BUT ALLOWS HIM TO KEEP  
 IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC.    
 PROBLEMS ARISE IN WINTER,BECAUSE DEEP 
 SNOW CAN PREVENT ANY FORM OF ROAD     
 TRANSPORT REACHING THESE VILLAGES.HE  
 USES A TWO CHANNEL RADIO TO CONTACT   
 HEADQUARTERS AT DALKEITH POLICE STAT- 
 ION.                                  
 THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A TYPICAL   
 DAY FOR HIM BECAUSE HIS DUTIES ARE    
 CONTROLLED BY EVENTS,SUCH AS A ROAD   
 ACCIDENT,ROBBERY OR SCHOOL VISIT.HE   
 HAS BEEN TRAINED TO FACE THE DANGER IN
 HIS JOB AND CAN CALL ON THE HELP OF   
 POLICE DOGS.IT'S A SATISFYING JOB.    </content>
