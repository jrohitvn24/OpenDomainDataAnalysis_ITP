		<content> Going along Kessock Road you pass the 
 old Coastguard Station and the Watch  
 House.Then comes the council housing  
 estate people call"The Ferry".It was a
 deprived area with many problems.Â£7m  
 were spent to improve it.Mrs.Stewart  
 likes her house now.Her garden is     
 smaller and easy to keep.She has      
 central heating and two toilets.Her   
 street is Carnac Crescent now, and all
 the neighbours have bright curtains on
 their new windows.It is quieter.People
 like the Community Centre and soon    
 they will run it.The Community        
 policeman fixes football matches and  
 outings.The children go to Merkinch   
 School and Nursery,all modernised.    
 There will be a Family Advice Centre  
 and a Training Centre for the mentally
 handicapped people of Inverness.It is 
 sad so many are unemployed,but there  
 is not so much vandalism.It's better. </content>
