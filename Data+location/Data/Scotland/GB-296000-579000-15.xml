 The Farmbuildings were built in a     
 square traditional style in the late  
 18th century.  This provided shelter. 
 It used to be a Dairy Farm because it 
 is more convenient for the farmer who 
 has a seperate potato business.       
 Dairying put too many restrictions in 
 the 50s and 60s.  One of the buildings
 is the old horse stables which housed 
 5 Clydesdale horses.  Above it is the 
{Hay Loft.}The farmer changed from     
 dairying 16 years ago and part of the 
 byre is now used for testing the beef 
 cattle for T.B and Brucellcas.  This  
 is something they do by law when the  
 cattle reach the age of 18 months.    
 You can still see the overhead pipes  
 which takes the milk into the dairy   
 and then into the milk tank.  In the  
 old days they used to milk by hand.
