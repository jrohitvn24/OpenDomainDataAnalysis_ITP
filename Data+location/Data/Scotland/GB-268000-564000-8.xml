		<content> There is no regular public transport  
 service in Laurieston, so the Post Bus
 serves the community, each day taking 
 passengers to the nearby town of      
 Castle Douglas, 6 miles away.         
     The Post Bus has been running for 
 approximately 7 years. It runs on all 
 days exept Sundays and half days on   
 Saturdays. There are a few regular    
 passengers, on average 3 to 4 people  
 on all days except Fridays, when there
 are slightly more.The route is from   
 Mossdale to Castle Douglas by the main
 road. In the summer there is a scenic 
 route taking in small farms around the
 Balmaghie area. The cost from Mossdale
 to Castle Douglas, approximately 10   
 miles, is 74p.                        
       Of the approximately 80         
 inhabitants of Laurieston,40 have     
 their own cars,allowing them to       
 commute more easily to nearby towns.  </content>
