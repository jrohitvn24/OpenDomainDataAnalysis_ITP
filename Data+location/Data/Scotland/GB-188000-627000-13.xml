		<title>13Shiskine Churches</title>
		<content>   There are two churches in Shiskine, 
 St.Molio's Church of Scotland and The 
 Free Church of Scotland. Most of the  
 people in the valley go to one or     
 other of the churches.                
   St.Molio's is a listed building     
 96 yrs old, being designed by a famous
 architect called Sir John James Burnet
 Another to the same plan was built in 
 Perthshire. The minister serves       
 Pirnmill and Lochranza as well. In    
 this Church they stand to sing to the 
 music of an electric Compton organ,   
 and sit to pray.                      
   The Free Church building is 28 years
 old, and the minister serves the whole
 of the island. In this Church the     
 congregation sit to sing the psalms,  
 led by a precentor, and stand to pray.
   The ministers are joint school      
 chaplains, taking a service on        
 alternate Fridays.                    </content>
