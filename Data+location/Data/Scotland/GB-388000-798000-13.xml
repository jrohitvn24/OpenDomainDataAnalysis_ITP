		<title>13BLAIRS COLLEGE HISTORY</title>
		<content>  From{1716}Roman Catholic boys studied
 for the{priesthood}at Scalan in       
 Glenlivet and Aquhorties near         
 Inverurie. In time these colleges     
 became too small and John Menzies,the 
 last{Laird of Pitfodels,}gave his     
{mansion at Blairs}to the Catholic     
 Church in{1827 as a seminary.         
  By 1897 this building became too     
 small for the growing number of       
 students and so a new building was    
 erected.                              
  As well as having a fine{neo-Gothic  
{Church}there is also a{museum}and     
 small{art gallery with many relics of 
{the Stuart family,}including a well   
 known portrait of{Mary Queen of Scots.
 The library had a fine collection of  
{books and manuscripts}until 1974 when 
 it was lent to the National Library in
 Edinburgh.                            
                                       </content>
