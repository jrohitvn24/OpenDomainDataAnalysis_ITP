		<title>09  A HEAD TEACHER'S VIEW</title>
		<content>  Since taking up the post of head     
 teacher of Dalmilling Primary School  
 in 1983,I have found myself in a very 
 challenging and stimulating job.I am, 
 so to speak,{"at the hub of a very    
{important wheel"}in the life of the   
 community.Very often,I am the first   
 link the school has with the outside  
 world,in particular,with parents and  
 the local community.                  
  Despite the many problems of present 
 day living,the people of our district 
 very often display the happier side of
 life and generate feelings of warmth, 
 sincerity and friendliness.           
  In every school venture,undertaken by
 pupils or by staff,parents and friends
 willingly give their support,whether  
 it is to a school based project or to 
 other organisations,which assist less 
 fortunate children in world-wide areas
 of deprivation.                       </content>
