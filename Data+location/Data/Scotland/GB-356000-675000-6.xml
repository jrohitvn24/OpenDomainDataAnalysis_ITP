     My house is in Kingsburgh Gardens 
 and is about three years old. It is a 
 detached bungalow. I like my house. I 
 have my own bedroom. My mum,dad,      
 Karen and I live in the house. It is  
 built with bricks and has a study,    
 three bedrooms,kitchen,dining         
 room,living room,bathroom,shower room 
 and utility room. Our garden is quite 
 big. There is a shed in my back       
 garden. My sister and I made it into a
 kind of house. We have a garage where 
 my mum keeps her car and we keep our  
 bikes. My dad keeps his car in the    
 drive. My bedroom is quite small. In  
 it I have a bed, chest of drawers,    
 bookcase,desk,chair and fitted        
 wardrobe.
