		<content> Pitbladdo is a capital-intensive farm 
 -they own 3 combine harvesters, which 
 operate from dawn to midnight during  
 the harvest seasons; 8 tractors, a    
 potato picking machine and many other 
 smaller machines and implements. The  
 increase in mechanisation has meant a 
 corresponding fall in the amount of   
 labour employed on the farm.          
  The farm no longer keeps any animals.
 At one time, in addition to the dairy 
 herds and horses they kept hens for   
 eggs but have never eaten any of the  
 animals they reared. They do however  
 grow their own vegetables in the      
 farmhouse garden.                     
  One recent improvement to the farm   
 was the installation of plastic drains
 to a boggy area of land. This was     
 funded by a 37% to 50% grant from the 
 EEC, which the Stewarts say is the    
 only benefit they have received.      </content>
