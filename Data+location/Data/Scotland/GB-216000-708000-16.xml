		<title>16The Fish Farm 2</title>
		<content>  There are a few predators and they   
 are the cormorant,the seal,the heron  
 and the poachers.The cormorant can't  
 get any of the fish because there are 
 nets over the tanks but they can      
 damage them.If the seal is really     
 hungry it will attack the cages and   
 eat a fish and  the rest of the fish  
 will get away.The heron will sit      
 peacefully and wait till he sees his  
 chance.The poachers only come out at  
 night because it is dark and nobody   
 can see them.There is an alarm        
 system on the cages but no one has    
 tried to get in yet.                  
  It is very important to watch out for
 disease so the tanks in the hatchery  
 have to be cleaned out every day.     
 Sometimes the fish have to be         
 vaccinated.When the fish are two years
 old or about 3 to 4 kilos in weight   
 they are sold.                        </content>
