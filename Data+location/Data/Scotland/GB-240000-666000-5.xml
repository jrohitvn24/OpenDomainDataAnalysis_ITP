		<title>05EMPLOYMENT IN HOUSTON</title>
		<content> Since Houston functions as a{dormitory
 village it provides few employment    
 opportunities. The majority of        
 residents{commute}to towns and cities 
 like Paisley and Glasgow.             
 An important source of employment in  
 the area is farming,although this is  
 often seasonal work during harvesting 
 e.g.{rhubarb picking in July.}Most    
 farms are worked by the farmer and his
 family.                               
 The old Houston mill is now a babywear
 manufacturer.                         
 A major workplace is Gryffe High      
 School lying on the western edge,     
 which serves Houston and Bridge of    
 Weir and employs about 100 staff with 
 around 50 at the two primary schools. 
 Service industries e.g. clinic,shops  
 employ some people.                   
 School leavers seek higher education  
 and work in Paisley and Glasgow.      </content>
