		<title>12Leisure Time in Durris</title>
		<content> There are very few amenities in our   
 block,especially for children,but they
 can still enjoy themselves,as the     
 following account shows.              
   On a weekend day ,if it is fine,I   
 usually go for a walk up in the       
 woods.My sister and brother come too. 
 Sometimes I go for a cycle ride.It's a
 great view when you go cycling round  
 the countryside.You can hear a lot of 
 birds nearby.I occasionally walk up to
 our local football pitch.There is a   
 farm track up by the pitch where a    
 herd of cattle live.In Clune Wood     
 there is a stone circle that is quite 
 interesting,but it is quite a long    
 walk from my house.I might go down to 
 visit my friend who lives down in     
 Woodlands Park.You have to go past a  
 lot of houses and down a long,narrow  
 road.She lives in Durris House.
