		<title>18THE KINGDOM OF KIPPEN</title>
		<content> There is a story from the time of     
 James V which tells of a "King of     
 Kippen":The first Buchanan owner of   
 Arnprior demanded the purchase of part
 of a load of a carrier going to       
 Stirling. On being told that the load 
 was for the King, Buchanan replied,   
 "Tell him if he is King of Scotland I 
 am King of Kippen and need some of my 
 Royal Brother's provisions".The King, 
 with retinue, duly paid a visit to    
 Arnprior,interrupting Buchanan's      
 meal with the announcement:"The       
 Gudeman of Ballochgeigh humbly        
 requests an audience of the King of   
 Kippen".The meeting proved successful,
 with the King inviting His Royal      
 Impertinence back to the Royal Palace 
 of Stirling.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
