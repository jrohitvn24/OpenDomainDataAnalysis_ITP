		<content> tyres for on of the excavators are    
 over{6ft in diameter and cost Â£2000   
 each. Rock is taken from the quarry by
 lorry to markets in the local area.   
                                       
 Next to the modern quarry is the{old  
{Kelhead quarry}which produced         
 agricultural lime. It closed in the   
 1920's and is now a{large picnic area.
 The old limestone burner is still     
 there. The quarry has been turned into
 a lake with{Canada geese}and stocked  
 with{fish for local anglers.}Swimming 
 is not possible because the water is  
 90ft. deep, shelves rapidly and is    
 very cold.
