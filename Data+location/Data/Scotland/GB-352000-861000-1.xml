 Our rural area is picturesque and     
 peaceful with farms and crofts        
 surrounded  by burns and fir          
 plantations.  Farming is mixed, crops 
 being mainly of barley, grass for     
 grazing, turnips and potatoes.        
 Cattle, sheep and pigs are reared and 
 poultry farming is plentiful.  Some   
 older farm houses are being used as   
 holiday homes, while others, being    
 unoccupied for some years, are now in 
 ruins.   In the village itself, places
 of great historic interest are to be  
 found and this has led to Fordyce     
 being made a conservation area.  The  
 residents take a great deal of pride  
 in their area and try to maintain the 
 standard they achieved in l984, when  
 their efforts were highly commended in
 the magazine "Scotland in Bloom."     </content>
