		<title>16GLEN TORRIDON CRAFTS</title>
		<content> There is a small pottery in Torridon, 
 next to the potter's house.The potters
 make the pottery then sell it to the  
 local shop and to other craft shops.  
 The pottery,which is mostly hand made 
 and hand painted,is dishes,pots,vases,
 ornaments,lamps and bowls.Some of the 
 people in the area buy the goods:     
 tourists and visitors also buy it as  
 attractive souvenirs of their stay.   
 The small work shop has electric fired
 kilns,two electric and one foot driven
 wheel and an electric clay pug.The    
 pots have to be fired three times.    
 Painting and finishing is all hand    
 done.There is also woodwork equipment 
 as wooden goods are sometimes made too
 At one time wrought iron work was also
 done,but is not done so much now.     
 This is the only commercial craft work
 done in this area,though other crafts 
 are done in nearby villages.          </content>
