		<title>16B.B.C. Transmitting Station</title>
		<content> The Thrumster station was built by the
 B.B.C. in 1956 as a transmitting and  
 receiving station for T.V.and radio.  
 The base is rented from Brit. Telecom 
 and is now used only for storage and  
 maintenance.Initially the base was    
 manned and operated for 405 blk/white 
 T.V. but this finished in 1983/84 when
 625 lines for colour were introduced  
 so a new station was built at Rumster 
 15km.S.W.  Thrumster cont.with V.H.F. 
 radio producing a high quality signal 
 for Hi-Fi. As most people had vertical
 not horizontal car ariels a new system
 became necessary.The site for this was
 also to be Rumster,which is fully     
 automatic.Due to the advent of micro- 
 electronics a roomful of radio equip- 
 ment now fits in the space of a cup-  
 board.Thrumster today is the base for 
 five maintenance engineers who super- 
 vise an area from Tongue to Orkney.   </content>
