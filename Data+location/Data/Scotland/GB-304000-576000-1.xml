		<title>01Dumfries-shire farmland</title>
		<content> An entirely agricultural area on the  
 edge of the valley of the river Nith. 
 The land is undulating,with a spine of
 high land through the middle of the   
 block. Part is wooded with a mixtue of
 deciduous and coniferous trees. Most  
 of the remaining land is used for both
 crop production and for grazing cattle
 and sheep but the higher section along
 the spine is used for grazing only.   
 Four farms control most of the area   
 between them. The biggest employs a   
 few staff, the others rely on the     
 farming family alone.The main products
 are milk, wood and beef, much of the  
 crops (wheat, oats, hay mostly) being 
 used for animal feed on te farm where 
 it is grown. Mechanical power is much 
 used, the tractors probably out number
 the people. The only non-agricultural 
 intrusions are radio masts on hazel   
 shaw hill.                            </content>
