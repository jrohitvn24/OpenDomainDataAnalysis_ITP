		<title>01PETERHEAD POLICE FORCE</title>
		<content> Peterhead police station was          
 established in 1901.It is a           
 Sub_Divisional office and is quite    
 large in comparison to others in      
 Scotland.                             
{ Our local force consists of 3        
{policewomen and 45 policemen.There are
{6 police cars and 1 police            
{van.There are 3 traffic wardens and 4 
{traffic patrolmen.                    
  The most common crime in Peterhead is
 Breach of the Peace.Most petty crimes 
 are repeated by the same people.But of
 course there are always new           
 criminals.There are nine cells in the 
 station 3 of which are for women.     
  The policemen and women take it in   
 turns to walk the beat depending on   
 the shift they are working.           
  From what we have seen of Peterhead  
 Police station it is a very efficient 
 and well maintained station.          </content>
