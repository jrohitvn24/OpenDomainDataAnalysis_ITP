		<content>   The farms of Portstown and          
 Roundhaugh lie to the west of         
 Inverurie.Mr Cassie,the present       
 owner's main enterprise is breeding   
 Dorset lambs although he also has a   
 herd of 60 cattle.He buys his ewes at 
 either Aberdeen or Inverness at a cost
 of approx. Â£65_Â£80 per ewe.This year  
 his flock produced 400 lambs,which    
 works out at approx.1.75 lambs per    
 ewe.The lambs are fattened and sold as
 milk lambs as soon as they come off   
 their mother's milk.Both lambs and    
 cattle are sold to the local abattoir,
 McIntosh of Inverurie.                
   250 acres are used to grow barley   
 and grass.Some barley is kept as      
 winter fodder,the rest is sold to     
 grain merchants as cattle feed.Mr     
 Cassie also grows dwarf peas to feed  
 to his sheep because of their high    
 vitamin content.                      </content>
