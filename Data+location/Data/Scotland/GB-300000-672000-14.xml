		<content> Commercial activities are carried out 
 in a small way at the Beecraigs       
 Centre. In the centre there are soft  
 goods such as fluffy toys and oven    
 gloves shaped like trout.Visitors can 
 also buy homemade jam and pickles,    
 books ,pencils and pictures.          
 The biggest money making efforts      
 concern the trout farm and the deer   
 farm.                                 
 The trout is grown to a particular    
 size and then sold to the public in   
 two ways.It is possible for the       
 general public to buy fresh trout on a
 Sunday. Some trout is sold to the     
 deep-freeze companies and more is sold
 to hotels far and wide.               
 Venison from the deer is also sold    
 from the park. Most of this goes to   
 butchers and to hotels.
