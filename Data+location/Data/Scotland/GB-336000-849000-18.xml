		<title>18Watershed At Mulben</title>
		<content> When you look at the map of Mulben,   
 you wiil see a burn (small            
 stream) flowing along parallel to the 
 road and the railway line.  From the  
 Level Crossing towards Keith, it is   
 known as the Rosarie Burn.  It        
 flows toward Keith into the River     
 Isla.                                 
 From the Level Crossing towards Mulben
 it is  known as the burn of Mulben and
 it flows to the River Spey.           
 We stood on the bridge by the Level   
 Crossing and watched the water flowing
 towards Keith.  Then we walked in the 
 other direction along a track by the  
 Railway Line and saw the Burn of      
 Mulben flowing in the opposite        
 direction.  Our teacher told us that  
 the point from where water flows in   
 different directions is called a      
 Watershed.                            
                                       </content>
