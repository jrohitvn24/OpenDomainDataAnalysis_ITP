		<title>07Harris Tweed(contd).</title>
		<content>  It is hard work, but a weaver can do 
 three or more tweeds in a week.       
 Working steadily a tweed could be done
 in about ten hours, and one good thing
 about this is that a weaver can work  
 the hours he wants to, take his time, 
 or do all the work at the beginning of
 the week and have the rest of the week
 free. Most of the tweed is exported to
 foreign countries, the majority going 
 to America, and at the moment, because
 the value of the dollar is so high,   
 they can afford to buy more so the    
 mills are getting plenty of orders.   
  It is ironic that it is when the     
 economy is low, the better off the    
 weavers are, but then, it works the   
 other way too.
