		<content>    MOST OF THE HOUSES ON BOTH SIDES OF
 LITTLE LOCH BROOM ARE OF THE          
 TRADITIONAL CROFT HOUSE VARIETY.BUILT 
 OF LOCAL SANDSTONE ABOUT THE START OF 
 THE CENTURY,THEY CONSIST OF 2 ROOMS   
 DOWNSTAIRS AND 2 ROOMS UPSTAIRS. THE  
 BIGGER HOUSES HAVE A SMALL KITCHEN OR 
 PANTRY BEHIND THE STAIRCASE,WITH A    
 THIRD BEDROOM ABOVE.SOME HOUSES HAVE A
 PORCH AT THE FRONT DOOR WHICH GIVES   
 EXTRA SPACE AND PROTECTION AGAINST THE
 PREVAILING WIND.                      
   AT BADLUARACH A NEW HOUSE HAS BEEN  
 BUILT ON TRADITIONAL LINES BUT        
 CONSTRUCTED WITH CONCRETE BLOCKS.     
   ON SCORAIG A CONCRETE DOME HAS BEEN 
 BUILT AS A DWELLING-HOUSE.THERE IS A  
 LARGE CENTRAL LIVING ROOM WITH LARDER 
 AND BATHROOM LEADING OFF.THE UPPER    
 FLOOR BEDROOM IS SUSPENDED FROM THE   
 CEILING BY STEEL CABLES.
