		<content> West Lethans Farm lies half a mile    
 East of Knockhill Racing Circuit. The 
 landscape is rough grazing and some   
 seeded grass. West Lethans Farm       
 consists of about 400 acres of rough  
 grazing.                              
 The farm grazes 400 blackfaced ewes   
 and at the lambing time they produce  
 on average 560 lambs.                 
 The area of rough pasture is          
 approximately 250 acres. The other 150
 acres have been improved at one time. 
 The farm consists of seven large,     
 fenced in fields and a rough grazing  
 hill.                                 
 In the winter the farm has 80 cattle  
 which are mainly Ling cows. 40 of the 
 cows and their calves go away to      
 grazing in the summer.                
 The farm is run by one sheperd with   
 help from five dogs.
