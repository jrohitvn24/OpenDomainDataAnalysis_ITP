		<title>01Southern end of Loch Ken</title>
		<content> This area is thinly populated and     
 supports a few small farms. These     
 stock mainly sheep and beef cattle,   
 which graze the land. There is little 
 deciduous woodland left in an area    
 that was once densely covered in      
 native trees such as oak and birch.   
 Much of the woodland is now made up of
 faster growing conifers such as       
 spruce.                               
 Come winter much of the wildlife can  
 be seen feeding alonside the farm     
 livestock and the now dominant        
 conifers will support many birds,     
 squirrels and deer. Several flocks of 
 migratory geese return each winter    
 from Greenland and Spitzbergen.       
 The loch is popular with both anglers 
 and water sports enthusiasts. Coarse  
 and salmon fishermen take to the water
 when the windsurfers and skiers leave 
 at the end of the summer.             </content>
