		<content> Ellon has rapidly become a major      
{commuter town}for{Aberdeen}over the   
 past ten years. This expansion is a   
 result of the discovery of oil in the 
 North Sea. The population has been    
 rising since this discovery and has   
 now reached 9000, quite a difference  
 to the 1550 people who inhabited the  
 small original market in the 1960's.  
 To accommodate the large population   
 many new housing estates have been    
 built on all four sides of the        
 original town eg.{Meiklemill and      
{Craighall}both on the south side of   
 the{River Ythan.}In the past 5 years  
 one more estate has been built,       
{Castlepark}situated to the east of the
 town. Many residents of Ellon have    
 lived here all their lives but there  
 are those who have 'moved in' not just
 from the British Isles but from       
 abroad.Most of the residents are young</content>
