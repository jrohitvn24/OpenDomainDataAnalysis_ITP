 about the prejudice and discrimination
 practised by the Protestant side, such
 as the local bank that for years      
 refused to employ RCs until the local 
 bishop threatened a withdrawal of     
 savings by the Catholic population.   
                                       
 In Townhead, as elsewhere locally, the
 primary schools are religiously       
 segregated, with Townhead primary the 
 state non-denominational school, and  
 St. Bartholomew's the RC primary.     
                                       
 In spite of this many schoolchildren  
 in the Townhead area have friends of  
 the 'other' denomination, and here as 
 elsewhere in Scotland the number of   
 mixed marriages is growing.
