    The{SOCIAL WORK DEPARTMENT}of the  
 Highland Regional Council started this
 scheme in January, 1984. What used to 
 be Culduthel Primary School is used   
 for a workshop for offenders who break
 the law. They are aged between 16 and 
 45 years, both male and female.       
                                       
    They make toys which are given to  
 hospitals and the Ethiopian Appeal.   
 They also work in the community,      
 helping old people by digging gardens,
 chopping sticks, sawing logs and many 
 other things.                         
                                       
    The Service Scheme operates from   
 Monday to Saturday.
