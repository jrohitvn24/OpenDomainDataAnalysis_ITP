		<content> The {Reservoir's}water supply was     
 originally from Glen Ogil, but it  now
 comes from Lintrathen. It was built in
 1909 and was cleaned out for the first
 time in 1984. This water supplies the 
 town of Arbroath, which needs 3.3     
 million gallons per day. New pipe     
 lines are being laid to supply Brechin
 and Montrose. The main reservoir is   
 760ft above sea_level and the         
 Framedrum Reservoir 467ft .The water  
 then drops down through  Muirheads to 
 Arbroath, which is just above         
 sea_level. The water supply for this  
 area comes from LochLee.              
 There is also a Chlorine Treatment    
 House for putting chlorine into the   
 water . There are strict safety       
 precautions and the amount and        
 pressure is checked every second day, 
 the cylinder being changed every two  
 weeks by two men.                     </content>
