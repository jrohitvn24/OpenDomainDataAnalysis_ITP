		<title>15A DOLPHINTON TEENAGER</title>
		<content> I am a teenager who has lived in the  
 village for the past four years. On   
 leaving school I entrolled on a two   
 year Catering Course at a college in  
 Edinburgh. When I completed the course
 in June this year I was very fortunate
 in obtaining employment with a large  
 Catering Company in Edinburgh, who    
 have canteens in large offices. I     
 travel to work every day. During the  
 winter months I play badminton in the 
 village hall two evenings a week. For 
 entertainment my friends and I have to
 travelk outside the village to West   
 Linton, Peebles or Biggar to discos. I
 also go swimming once a week to the   
 new swimming pool which was built     
 quite recently at Peebles. My record  
 collection is quite varied and I spend
 a lot of my spare time listening to   
 it. We also have a video recorder and 
 I like watching films on television.  </content>
