		<title>02RELIGION IN ALVA</title>
		<content> The{cemetery}belonging to St.Serf's   
{church}is on the hill at the east end 
 of Alva. Some of the graves are more  
 than 200 years old. St.Serf's church  
 was destroyed by a fire in 1984. The  
 site has been levelled and grassed    
 over. There is a Mausoleum where the  
 Johnstones were buried,designed by    
 Robert Adam in 1790. The bell         
 belonging to St.Serf's church was     
 supposed to have a{curse}on it,that   
 if anyone took down the bell they     
 would come to some harm,but it was    
 removed by the Royal Scots for their  
 garrison church.                      
  The churches in Alva now are the     
 Catholic church of St.John Vianney,the
 Baptist church and the Eadie Kirk.
