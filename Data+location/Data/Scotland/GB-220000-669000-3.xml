		<title>03SOUTH INVERKIP TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> The main communications in the area   
 are the A78 road and the railway which
 runs from Glasgow to Wemyss Bay       
 (single track from Port Glasgow). They
 both run from the north of the area to
 the south. They are both confined to  
 the coastal areas because of the high 
 moorlands at the back of Inverkip.    
  Over the last few years the          
 communications in the area have been  
 improved with the straightening and   
 widening of the main road which runs  
 along the coast,and the               
 electrification of the railway. A     
 network of 'B' class roads links the  
 farms.                                
  There is only one railway station in 
 the area,at Inverkip.                 
  There is a regular bus service       
 between Greenock and Largs,passing    
 through Inverkip.
