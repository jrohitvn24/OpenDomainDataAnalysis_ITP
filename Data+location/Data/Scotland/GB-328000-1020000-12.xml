		<title>12DECCA STATION: NEAR DOUNBY</title>
		<content> The{Decca Station}is in Sandwick, not 
 far from Dounby village.              
 It's main job is to send out signals  
 to aeroplanes and boats, within 200   
 miles or so, to help them{navigate.   
 This lets them know where they are so 
 that they can keep clear of rocks or  
 wrecks in the area.                   
 Inside there are control boxes and    
 transmitters. A machine sounds a bell 
 if anything goes wrong. There are two 
 diesel generators which power the     
 station during power-cuts in winter.  
 There is also a set of stand-by       
 batteries used in power-cuts until the
 generators can be started.            
 Dounby is the "master" station for    
 three others which are called         
 "slaves".                             
 Radio waves go out every 20           
 seconds from three huge ariels outside
 in the field.                         </content>
