 Mr.Eddie, an ex_ pupil of Kinneff     
 School, told us how our area has      
 changed since{1921. The school}still  
 has two teachers although the roll has
 fallen approximately 75%. School was  
 held in the old building and no       
 lunches were served. Children could   
 complete their secondary education at 
 Kinneff.{The village}is much bigger   
 but has less shops. There used to be a
 post office, a shop, a tailor and two 
 shoemakers. Mr Eddie's house had no   
 electricity or running water.{Families
 were much bigger and mothers did not  
 go out to work. On the{farms,}tractors
 have replaced horses. Fernieflatt used
 to have four pairs of horses. Wheat   
 and barley are now grown instead of   
 corn. Everyone has more{leisure time  
 and travels much farther afield by car
 or bus. In 1921 most people walked.   </content>
