		<content>   The{Adam Smith Centre}was built in  
{1899}and began life as a Victorian    
 concert hall.In 1973 it was renovated 
 and turned into a modern theatre.     
   On average 350 tickets are sold each
 day ,Monday to Friday , but on        
 Saturday nights the auditorium's 475  
 seats are filled.                     
   Although many types of shows are    
 performed on the stage the most       
 popular seems to be the{pantomime.    
 Sunday evenings are also very popular 
 when the Theatre is used to show      
{films.                                
   Mr. Potter ,the Theatre Director, is
 in charge of 11 full time and several 
 part time staff.                      
   Theatre performers are very         
{superstitious}and they believe it is  
  unlucky to whistle in the dressing   
 room. If anyone does this they must go
 outside and turn round three times.   </content>
