		<title>10The Blacksmith at Balmullo</title>
		<content> One of the most famous residents is   
 Mr. David Wilson, the village         
 blacksmith.   He has been well-known  
 as a very talented blacksmith for many
 years, but this year accomplished a   
 remarkable achievement and won the    
 world championship for blacksmiths in 
 Calgary, Canada.                      
 The competition took place over       
 several days and included such events 
 as making special horse-shoes to      
 correct hoof disorders, and shoeing   
 horses.                               
 Mr. Wilson has a great number of      
 medals, trophies, certificates and    
 other awards which he has won during  
 the past thirty-five years.   He has  
 now decided to retire from competition
 and his son, who is also called David,
 will carry on the family tradition.   
 Perhaps he will be the World Champion 
 one day, too!                         </content>
