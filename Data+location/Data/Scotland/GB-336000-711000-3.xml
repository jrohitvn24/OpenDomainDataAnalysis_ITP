 We went to visit Ceres Engineers on   
 the 26th of May 1985.Ceres Engineers  
 is part of{Rippin Structures}who make 
 large{agricultural sheds.}The firm    
 employs{13 men}3 of which make steel  
 girders and the other 10 actually     
 build the large sheds on the site.    
        {SECOND-HAND CAR SALES:        
 We looked at a small second-hand car  
 dealer's business which buys mostly   
 second-hand cars,{fixes them, sprays  
{them and sells them.}The owner has    
 been running the business for over 5  
 years and says "You need a lot of     
 experience". He enjoys his job and    
 sells an average of{96 cars a year.   
 Every car needs an{M.O.T. Certificate 
{and a Registration document. }The     
 owner has lived in Ceres for only 5   
 years but admits he is not involved in
 the community life of the village.    </content>
