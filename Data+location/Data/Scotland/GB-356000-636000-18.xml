		<content> In the morning,I get up at about 7.00 
 am and then I go down stairs to have  
 breakfast. I usually have Rice        
 Krispies and a cup of tea. When I am  
 ready, I go down the drive way at     
 about 8.10am to get my bus. I get to  
 school at about 8.20am and play       
 football until 9.00am. At 9.00am, we  
 come into school and work till 3.30pm.
 I have to wait for my bus until 3.55  
 pm. when secondary school finishes.   
 When I get home, I usually have a cup 
 of tea and a biscuit which keeps me   
 going till tea time. I have tea at    
 about 5.15pm and then I do my         
 homework.After that I go to play      
 football or watch T.V. if there is    
 something good on.I go to bed between 
 10 and 10.30pm.
