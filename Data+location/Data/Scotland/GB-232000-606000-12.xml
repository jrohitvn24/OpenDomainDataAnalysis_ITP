		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SUSAN</title>
		<content> I get up at 8a.m. and have a breakfast
 of cereal and milk. I get ready for   
 school then go down the road to wait  
 for the car which takes me to         
 Crosshill Primary School. I play with 
 my friend Isabel until the bell rings 
 at 9a.m. We change our shoes before   
 going to the classroom where we do    
 number and language work in the       
 morning.Some days we have a television
 programme. At 10.30 we have playtime. 
 We get free milk to drink and may buy 
 crisps at tuck shop.Playtime ends at  
 10.45a.m. I have school dinners each  
 day at 12.15 which consists of        
 meat,potatoes and vegetable followed  
 by a pudding .In winter we sometimes  
 get soup first and no pudding.The     
 afternoon starts at 1.45 and we do    
 topic work until 3.30 when I go home.I
 change into play clothes and watch    
 television before doing homework.     </content>
