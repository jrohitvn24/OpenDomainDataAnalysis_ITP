    The D block studied by Crieff High 
 School lies half a kilometre East of  
 Crieff in the heart of Perthshire.    
     Our area consisted mostly of      
 forestry and farmland.  It covered a  
 large section of the{Abercairney      
{Estate}owned by the{Drummond Murray   
 family.                               
     The project reflected this in its 
 contents.  Much of the work was       
 connected with the estate, past and   
 present.  It tried to convey what it  
 means to live and work in such a rural
 area by interviewing a number of      
 estate employees and their families.  
     We also looked at special features
 of our area eg.{Highlandman Loan, Pow 
{Burn}and{Inchbrakie  Castle,}as well  
 as  national issues eg. employment,   
 housing, transport and social         
 services.                     _       </content>
