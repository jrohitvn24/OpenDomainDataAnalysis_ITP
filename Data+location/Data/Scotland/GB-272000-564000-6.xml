		<title>06Greenlaw Mansion</title>
		<content> Greenlaw Mansion is a big Georgian    
 house. It was built by the Gordon     
 family and later turned into a hotel. 
 It is off the B795 road to Ayr.       
 To the north of the house is a farm   
 called Ermenzie. In front is an old   
 disused railway line. In the summer   
 now the embankments are all rosy      
 purple with masses of willow herb.    
 Clustered round the crossroads to the 
 east of Greenlaw is Townhead of       
 Greenlaw and to the south-west is the 
 farm, Mains of Greenlaw.              
 Greenlaw Mansion is burnt down now. It
 was burnt in 1984. Before the fire it 
 looked beautiful. Its colour was      
 yellow and white. It had 18 rooms. Now
 only a shell is left. The inside has  
 fallen down and there is no roof.
