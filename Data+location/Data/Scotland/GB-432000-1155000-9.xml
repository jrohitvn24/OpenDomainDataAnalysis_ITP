		<content> The Lifeboat.The Lifeboat is a Barnet 
 class boat which has two 74           
 h.p.engines. It's called the 'John    
 Francis Mcfarlane'. It was brought    
 here because a fishing boat called the
 'Ben Doran' went aground on the Ve    
 Skerries in 1930 and the whole crew   
 was lost. None of the small boats     
 could do anything about it because    
 of the weather. A Lifeboat had to come
 from Orkney. So the Lifeboat has been 
 here over 50 years. There are 8 people
 in the crew. A new boat will be       
 introduced next year.                 
 Other Boats. There are 25 small boats 
 moored in Aith Voe and 14 in East     
 Burrafirth. Some of the boats are use 
 for setting creels for lobsters, some 
 for line fishing and some for         
 pleasure. A few people fish scallops. 
 Some people have more than one boat.
