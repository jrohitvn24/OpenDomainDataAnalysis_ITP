 time and the association meets once

 thirties.

 attracts all age groups. In fact it is
 so popular that women from Lolatt, a  
 neighbouring village, have joined it. 
 It meets once per week.               
 LADIES CIRCLE - This was started in   
 1985 and it is trying to attract the  
 younger women who feel The WRI or     
 Womens Guild does not appeal to them. 
 It also meets once per month.

 local church and meets once per month.
