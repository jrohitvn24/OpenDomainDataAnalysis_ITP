		<content> People of primary school age have a   
 youth club once a week during the     
 winter months in the village hall.    
 This is also the meeting-place for    
 Brownies, Cubs, Guides and Majorettes.
 Boys who join the Scouts go to        
 Leuchars or Cupar.  Quite a few pupils
 go to Dundee or Cupar for swimming and
 several go to Newport to a gymnastics 
 club.   The rest of our free time is  
 used to help with jobs about the      
 house, playing with friends, watching 
 T.V., using computers, tending pets,  
 playing in the park, enjoying music   
 and reading.   Some of the older      
 pupils like golf.   We are given      
 lessons after school by Mr. A.S. Eggo 
 who lives in the village. Sometimes   
 the golfers go to St. Andrews for a   
 round of golf.  Many boys attend      
 football training, hoping for a place 
 in the Balmullo Hearts Team.          </content>
