 SCHOOL WAS A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE.    
 THE CHILDREN WALKED FROM MILES AROUND 
 TO ATTEND SCHOOL.                     
    THE SCHOOLROOM ITSELF HAD ONLY VERY
 BASIC EQUIPMENT - A BLACKBOARD, COPY  
 BOOKS AND DESKS.   THE ROOM WAS HEATED
 BY A FIRE IN THE CORNER.   THE DESK   
 SEATS WERE JOINED TO THE WRITING TOP  
 AND RAISED WHEN YOU STOOD UP.         
    THE USUAL PROJECT WOULD BE NATURE  
 STUDY, BUT THEY ALSO HAD ART AND      
 SEWING BESIDES THE BASIC SUBJECTS.    
    ONCE A YEAR THE SCHOOL INSPECTOR   
 WOULD COME TO SEE THAT BOTH TEACHER   
 AND CHILDREN WERE DOING WELL.         
    YOU COULD STAY ON AT SCHOOL UNTIL  
 YOU WERE FOURTEEN.   IF YOU STAYED ON 
 FOR FURTHER EDUCATION YOU WENT AS A   
 BOARDER TO DINGWALL ACADEMY.          
    THE PUNISHMENT FOR BEING NAUGHTY   
 WAS 'THE BELT'                        </content>
