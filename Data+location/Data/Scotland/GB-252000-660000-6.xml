		<title>06GLASGOW WILDLIFE WEEK</title>
		<content> Glasgow Wildlife Week is an annual    
 event organised by the Glasgow Urban  
 Wildlife Group which aims to open     
 Glaswegians' eyes to the wildlife     
 which surrounds them in the city.     
 Several events and activities are     
 organised.  Just one of these was     
 "Glasgow a Home for Wildlife" in which
 several primary schools participated: 
 Levern, Gowanbank, St. Robert's, St.  
 Vincent's, Carnwadric, Sir John       
 Maxwell, Shawlands.                   
 Each class received a talk about      
 Glasgows' wildlife at the school,     
 carried out a pollution survey of a   
 local burn, studied the woodland      
 wildlife in Pollok Country Park and   
 attended a wildlife filmshow at       
 Eastwood Theatre. Quote of the Week:  
 "It's really minging here"when pupils 
 found dead eels,sticklebacks,trout etc
 in the  Brock Burn.                   </content>
