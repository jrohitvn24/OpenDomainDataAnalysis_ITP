		<title>14ATTITUDES OF ARBROATH KIDS 1</title>
		<content> Most of the children that we surveyed 
 said they spent most of their{        
{recreation}time outdoors.Everybody    
 said that they enjoyed living in the  
 area but just over half complained    
 that there was not enough to do.The   
 most popular forms of{entertainment}  
 were cycling,swimming(a fact which    
 proved the popularity of the local    
 swimming{club}),and playing records.  
 From the answers given it was obvious 
 that there was a wide variety of clubs
 which catered for children.Through    
 local clubs children could enjoy      
 tennis,football,gymnastics,athletics, 
 golf,traditional Scottish dancing,    
 badminton,squash,and cricket,as well  
 as swimming.In addition there were    
 youth clubs at which children could   
 enjoy a number of activives.
