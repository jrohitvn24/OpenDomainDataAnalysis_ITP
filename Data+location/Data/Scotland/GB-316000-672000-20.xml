		<title>20SHOPS IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content> We have many shops in our area,       
 especially in Corstorphine. There are 
 also little shopping areas in the     
 housing schemes, like at Parkgrove    
 Street. These local shops are quite   
 expensive; there is a newsagent/post  
 office, butcher, baker, ironmonger,   
 grocer, chemist and shoe repairer.    
 Some of the children from our school  
 go to these shops in the middle of the
 day to buy their lunch and eat it     
 outside. There are houses above the   
 shops, and houses round them. At East 
 Craigs there is a very large super-   
 market called {SAFEWAYS.}It is very   
 popular, opens every day including    
 Sunday, and has a large car park. We  
 surveyed local parents and here is our
 result:10% never use it; 70% use a car
 when shopping, and 50% shop there once
 or more a week. Most people liked the 
 convenience, prices and selection.    </content>
