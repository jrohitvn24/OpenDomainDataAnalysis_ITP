		<title>10Home Life</title>
		<content>  Home Life for most families is       
 based around the farm. Many families  
 in the block are still engaged in     
 agriculture.                          
  Most activities such as recreation   
 or shopping have to be done outwith   
 the area which has no such facilities.
 The nearest town for most of the block
 is Inverurie which is well served for 
 shops, services etc.                  
  Aberdeen is only approximately 15    
 miles away and the large superstores  
 on its perimeter are even closer in   
 some cases such as ASDA at Dyce.      
  Some few families in the area are    
 new to the Garioch, drawn by the      
 oil industry in Aberdeen. They tend   
 to commute to the city.
