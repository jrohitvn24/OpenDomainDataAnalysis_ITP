		<content> The main{road}and{rail}routes run     
 parallel to the coast.Recently there  
 has been redevelopment of the main    
 road system with the up-grading of    
 the A8 to duel carriageway status.    
 This means that there is a continuous 
 fast road link to Glasgow and         
 Greenock. In doing so the land around 
 and on which the road travels has had 
 to be carved,reclaimed and landscaped 
 to hide the scars.The road is used by 
 the council run bus service and light 
{transportation}lorries that can       
 deliver goods to all parts of         
 Scotland.The 3 Port Glasgow train     
 stations provide a service to Wemyss  
 Bay,Gourock and Glasgow.The service is
 regular,fast and although limited is  
 more efficient than the bus service   
 can ever be.{Communications}have      
 certainly improved over the years.
