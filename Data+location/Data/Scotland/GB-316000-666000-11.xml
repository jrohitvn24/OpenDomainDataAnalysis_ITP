		<content> Mrs S is a member of the WRI in       
 Currie. They meet in Currie every     
 second Tuesday at Currie Hill School, 
 where attendances of 70 people are    
 expected. She joined 24 years ago in  
 Ratho. There is no age limit to       
 joining but the majority of members   
 joined at the age of 25. They have    
 talks about such things as living on  
 an oilrig or fire prevention and they 
 have also had talks from a local      
 doctor. They also make handcrafts or  
 demonstrate cookery. Mrs S was        
 president from 1978-1981. They have   
 been on outings to the GPO,the        
 Edinburgh Crystal Factory and a       
 candleworks. They also go for an      
 annual picnic. Every three years there
 is a Conference Meeting, which was    
 held this year, 1985, in Edinburgh.
