		<title>13FARMING</title>
		<content> In 1985 we found that farming in the  
 Ratho area was very prosperous and    
 rewarding.Most of the farmers had     
 very good land,machinery,buildings and
 were quite wealthy.This was very      
 noticeable in{Bonnington}farm.Compared
 with the other three farms we visited 
{Bonnington}farm was the most modern in
 various aspects including machinery   
 and livestock.Some of Ratho's farms   
 are being developed on by building    
 companies who are building roads and  
 houses on their land.
