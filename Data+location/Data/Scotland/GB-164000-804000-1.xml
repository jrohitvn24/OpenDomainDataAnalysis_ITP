		<content>  The land at Ostaig contains enclosed,
 but not recently improved fields, a   
 conifer plantation and some mature    
 trees. There are 5 private houses and 
 2 centres of Education which exemplify
 above all else the amazing            
 rejuvenation of the local community.  
 Sleat Primary School (Bun Sgoil       
 Schleite) was opened in 1983 with 70  
 children, replacing the old           
 Ferrindonald school which could no    
 longer cope with increasing numbers.  
 There are three, Gaelic speaking staff
 and 3 itinerant teachers. A move is   
 afoot to create a Gaelic speaking     
 intake to primary 1 in 1986.  The farm
 buildings at Ostaig were aquired by   
 Mr. Iain Noble as part of Fearann     
 Eilean Iarmain. It was slowly         
 renovated as a Gaelic college doing   
 short courses from the mid 1970s. In  
 1983 it accepted the first 8 students </content>
