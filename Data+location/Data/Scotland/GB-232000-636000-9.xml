		<content> The older part of{Irvine Police       
 Station dates from 100 years ago, the 
 newer building from 10 years ago. 25  
 police officers work from the station,
 but that doesn't mean you would see 25
 police officers if you walked into the
 station.Most of them just go into the 
 police station to start and finish    
 tours of duty and to find out what is 
 happening,then they go to the area    
 they are working in.You can join the  
 police force when you are{18 years    
 old.Until a few years ago you could be
 a cadet from the age of 16 but now    
 there are no cadets.When you join the 
 police you go to a place called       
 Tulliallan for four months to         
 train,then you go to your local       
 training centre,ours is in Glasgow.Men
 have to be 1.73m tall and women have  
 to be 1.68m tall.
