		<content> As there is no Health Centre in the   
 area, local people are normally       
 registered with Doctors and Dentists  
 in Dundee or Forfar. Hospitals are    
 also centred in Dundee, the two main  
 general hospitals being Ninewells and 
 Dundee Royal Infirmary.  There is a   
 Health Clinic at Whitfield, Dundee,   
 which is a local base for the School  
 Doctor, Dentist, Nurses and Health    
 Visitors.  Routine medical inspections
 for pupils are carried out annually by
 the School Doctor and Nurse, while the
 School Dentist visits each of the     
 schools twice per session with a      
 mobile surgery to carry out           
 inspections and treatments.  Pupils'  
 eyesight and hearing are checked      
 annually by an orthoptist and         
 audiographer.
