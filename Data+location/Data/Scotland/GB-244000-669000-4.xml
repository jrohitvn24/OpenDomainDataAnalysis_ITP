		<content> Due to the increasing population in   
 Erskine six primary schools and one   
 secondary school have been built.  The
 primary schools are Barsail,          
 Bargarran, Rashielea  and Inchinnan   
 which are non-denominational and St   
 Anne's and St John Bosco which are    
 Roman Catholic.  The primaries are    
 modern open plan schools with the     
 exception of Inchinnan Primary which  
 is a traditional village school.  The 
 schools are placed in the main areas  
 of Erskine, three in Park Mains, two  
 in Bargarran, one in North Barr and   
 one in the village of Inchinnan.  They
 are within easy walking distance of   
 the children who attend them.         
 Park Mains High School is a large     
 secondary school which has been built 
 in the  centre of Erskine with lots of
 green areas and playing fields        
 surrounding it.                       </content>
