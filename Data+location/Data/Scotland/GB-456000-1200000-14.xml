		<title>14Crofting in Uyeasound.</title>
		<content> There are several crofts in Uyeasound 
 as well as a couple of farms.         
   We spoke to a man who had been      
 working a croft for 15 years which was
 previously worked by his father.He has
 230 acres of land and his house is on 
 the croft.He said he enjoyed crofting.
   He grows 100 tons of silage,6 acres 
 of hay,more than 3 acres of barley and
 half an acre of potatoes.He has       
 machinery but no workers to help him. 
   He keeps 10 breeding cows,8 young   
 cattle and 6 calves.He also has 150   
 breeding ewes and a pony.             
   Besides working his croft,this man  
 is also a part-time Insurance Agent   
 and a part-time Lighthouse Keeper.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
