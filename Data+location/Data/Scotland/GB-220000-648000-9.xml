		<title>09FAMILY LIFE, SEAMILL</title>
		<content> Most people in Seamill are considered 
 to be quite well off. They own        
 televisions, cars, computers etc. Most
 parents have jobs and earn enough to  
 live in comfort. Nearly all the houses
 in Seamill are privately owned. Many  
 families have a family card for the   
 windsurfing club at the beach. The    
 beach isn't very good for sitting on  
 because of glass and seaweed.The beach
 is very good for windsurfing because  
 of the strong winds. As Seamill is    
 really a residential area adults have 
 to commute to work and{children have  
{to travel by car or mini bus to school
{in West Kilbride.                     
{A typical day}for Mrs.E.Young (a      
 typical  Seamill mother) would start  
 by waking the family, preparing       
 breakfast and taking Andrew (age 4) to
 nursery school at 9.30am. She would   
 then go to Mr.Young's work shop .     </content>
