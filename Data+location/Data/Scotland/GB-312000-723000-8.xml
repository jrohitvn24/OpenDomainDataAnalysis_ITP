		<title>08A  special Farm Near Perth</title>
		<content> This farm has to be seen to be        
 believed! Balcraig Farm exists to     
 supply Balcraig Hotel with the best   
 possible free range products.         
 Geese,ducks,hens and,bantams,turkeys, 
 Guinea fowls and even Peacocks all    
 roaming free about the farm!Ewes with 
 their lambs,Goats and kids,Cows and   
 calves and even horses for the hotel  
 guests to ride-all in the fields.For  
 obvious reasons the bull,the wild     
 boar,the wild sows and their piglets  
 are safely inside electric fences.    
 It's a very old fashioned farm and the
 farmer is rather old fashioned too!   
 It's a 5am to 9pm job seven days a    
 week and he loves the life so much    
 that he never wants a holiday!        
 With just about every farm animal you 
 could think of this is every childs   
 idea of what a farm should be. It's   
 Incredible!                           </content>
