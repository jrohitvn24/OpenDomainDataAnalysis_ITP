		<content>    Aberdeen's first{Industrial Estates
  in the 50's and 60's, at Northfield  
 and Mastrick, were planned prior to   
 the discovery of North Sea Oil and    
 Gas. However, with the advent of this,
 a need was recognised for many more   
 Industrial sites and consequently     
 several new Estates were designated. {
{Kirkhill Industrial Estate, Dyce}is   
 one of this new generation of eststes.
    Of the Industrial Estates in       
 Aberdeen at present, something like   
 50% of those have been developed in   
 the last decade. Kirkhill, at the     
 moment, has 55 acres developed, but   
 this is ultimately expected to extend 
 to 232 acres. The erection of         
 Industrial premises has mostly been   
 carried out by the private sector with
 the exception of some smaller Unit    
 Accommodation in Grampian Region owned
 Advance factories.                    </content>
