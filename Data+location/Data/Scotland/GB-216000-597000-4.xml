		<content>      {GIRVAN}Police Force consists of 
 one Chief Inspector,four Inspectors   
 and fifteen Constables.{GIRVAN}has no 
 traffic police but does have one      
 Sherpa van and one saloon car.        
       Minor offences are dealt with in
 the local magistrates' court whilst   
 more serious crimes would go before   
 the Sheriff at Ayr.The only recent    
 serious crime was murder.             
       A potentially serious situation 
 involving scooters was quickly brought
 under control,the first time this has 
 been experienced in {GIRVAN.}         
       The commonest offences are theft
 and assault.This year(1985) part of   
 GIRVAN Primary School was  burned     
 down.This is believed to have been    
 one of the oldest educational         
 establishments in SCOTLAND.
