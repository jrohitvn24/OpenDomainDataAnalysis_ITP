 The cleaners have a very hard job     
 because they have to hoover&amp;tidy every
 night . The electrician &amp; the joiner  
 both sort things or we would not have 
 light or heating.The post man &amp;the    
 dustbinman are very different in ways.
 One brings things and the other takes 
 things away .Teachers teach you. Our  
 auxilury does a lot for Gordon

 and takes phone calls.Pupils do jobs  
 as well. They sometimes help the      
 teachers .We have a job list which    
 changes weekly.
