		<title>08FARMING THE SEA IN ASSYNT</title>
		<content> This is the single most important     
 aspect around which Assynt exists. The
 Fishing Industry began in 1948,       
 encouraged by the late Hector Mackay. 
 Today around 50 boats use the port &amp;  
 31 local people are employed there.   
 "Quality" fish are landed here such as
 Halibut, Turbot, &amp; Skate. The fish is 
 transported to other markets in       
 England, before processing &amp; finding  
 its way onto the world markets.       
 Several types of boats fish out of the
 port. Most of the boats are East coast
 based. With an annual turnover of some
 Â£5m, fleet servicing facilities have  
 grown up. The local shops depend on   
 their trade &amp; a new trunk road to     
 Ullapool was built 10 years ago to    
 help in transporting the produce.     
 After a difficult few years, the      
 future for Fishing here is beginning  
 to look promising.                    </content>
