		<title>05A CHILD'S DAY IN SOUTH-AYR</title>
		<content>   My name is {Louise Marks,}I am{9}and
 I go to{Castlehill Primary School.}I  
 get up at 8.00am. and have my         
 breakfast of cornflakes, toast and    
 orange juice. After that I get dressed
 for school in a grey skirt, blue      
 blouse, grey jumper and my school tie.
   School starts at 9.00am. and we work
 until 10.30am., when we have our milk 
 and a snack, called a{playpiece.}Then 
 we go out to play. At 12.15pm. I go   
 home for lunch but some children stay 
 at school for lunch. We leave school  
 again at 3.35pm..                     
   I read a book and watch television  
 until tea-time when I usually have    
 meat and potatoes followed by yoghurt.
 I watch television again until it is  
 time to go to bed at 8.45pm..         
   The next day starts all over again.
