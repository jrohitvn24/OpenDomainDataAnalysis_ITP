		<title>12DALRY COMMUNITY COUNCIL</title>
		<content> The first Council was elected in 1978.
 Among early concerns was the loss of  
 public services,like the High School, 
 Police Station, Registrar's Office and
 Employment Exchange.                  
 To combat problems of gap sites and   
 dereliction, the Council organised a  
 massive clean-up,  helped by the youth
 organisations.  The S.D.A. then began 
 improving the town. Inviting the      
 Countryside Commission, to take part, 
 sparked off the Lynn Glen Project.    
 Improvements are being made in roads  
 and traffic safety.  A recent campaign
 succeeded in saving the Post Office.  
 Problems still unsolved are vandalism 
 and poor public transport.            
 Townspeople can attend meetings but   
 they rarely do. The town needs a      
 newsletter to spread information, and 
 the Council needs enthusiastic young  
 people to stand for election.         </content>
