		<content> Every year some taxi drivers from     
 Edinburgh take handicapped children   
 away for the day from their schools   
 down to Yellowcraigs to a picnic.  The
 taxis are all decorated with crepe    
 paper, balloons and streamers.  The   
 one that was voted the best dressed   
 taxi looked like the teddy bears      
 picnic.  It was a shame that it was   
 raining because that might have been  
 the only time that some of them could 
 get to the beach.  The children might 
 have gone into Aberlady Hall.  That is
 where they usually go when it is      
 raining.  On the way back all the     
 balloons were blowing off the taxis.  
 The taxis stop off for icecream in    
 Musselburgh.
