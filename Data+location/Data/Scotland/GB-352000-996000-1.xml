		<title>01Rose Ness</title>
		<content> Rose Ness point is the south west     
 point of the east mainland of Orkney. 
 The ground is level with a peat soil  
 with a grass and heather cover.   Some
 peat cutting has taken place but the  
 land is now used as rough grazing for 
 sheep.   The cliffs are neatly        
 verticle with several spectacular     
 gullies and geos.   The southern tip  
 of Rose Ness has a gas powered        
 automatic lighthouse marking the      
 enterence to Holm Sound.   About 300  
 meteres to the north east is a stone  
 built beacon with a cross on top this 
 was erected in the 19th centuary to   
 mark the enterence to Holm Sound      
 before the lighthouse was constructed.
