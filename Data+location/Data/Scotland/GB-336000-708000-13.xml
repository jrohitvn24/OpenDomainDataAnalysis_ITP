 This castle is in ruins now with only 
 parts of its walls remaining. It was  
 abandoned by its last owners,the      
 Lindsay and Crawford family over 100  
 years ago.                            
 Cromwell's soldiers occupied the      
 castle for three months in 1653. Four 
 years later Charles II was welcomed to
 the castle by the Lord Lindsay of the 
 day. The famous poet Sir David Lindsay
 of the Mount spent sone time there and
 wrote several of his poems at the     
 castle.
