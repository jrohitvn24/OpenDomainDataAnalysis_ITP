		<content> The servants quarters are all that    
 remain of the once very beautiful     
 Donibristle House, the seat of the    
 Earls of Moray, situated near the     
 shore line. Until recently, these     
 wings were used by the Housing Estate 
 Offices and prior to that the Royal   
 Navy. They are now empty. There have  
 been many plans to develop the        
 servants quarters. Barratts, a large  
 house building company, proposed to   
 convert the servants quarters into    
 flats and another interested party,   
 who later withdrew their offer, wished
 to turn the existing buildings into a 
 private hotel. However, a serious fire
 in 1984 destroyed half of the         
 remaining buildings and put paid to   
 any hopes of development. It is a     
 curious fact that the two previous    
 houses built on the same site were    
 also destroyed by fire.               </content>
