		<content> Wellbank and Newbigging are the two   
 villages in the area. They are so     
 similar in size and composition that  
 both can be described together. The   
 housing is a mixture of council and   
 private, in a ratio of roughly 1:1.   
 The Newbigging council houses have    
 been recently renovated and those in  
 Wellbank are due for rnovation, both  
 having been built in WWII. Occupiers  
 of council houses tend to be either   
 retired or manual workers. Many of the
 retired occupiers have been in        
 residence since the houses were built,
 which reflects the area's traditional,
 conservative lifestyle. It also       
 reflects that mechanisation has meant 
 that fewer workers are needed locally.
 There is no pressure, generated by a  
 changing workforce, for local housing,
 and so many retired couples have      
 settled permanently.                  </content>
