		<title>06FARMING - THE LAND</title>
		<content> This area is mainly rural and most of 
 the land to the north and east of     
 Houston is used for agriculture and   
 forestry. Grass is the main crop in   
 the area because of the cool moist    
 summers and mild wet winters          
 experienced in this western part of   
 Scotland.                             
 Soil varies from heavy, sticky, stony 
 clays on the higher ground,black,peaty
 soils on the flat land to the east,and
 sandy or silty soils along the River  
 Gryffe.                               
 The landscape is of scattered patches 
 of mixed woodland, smallish fields    
 bounded by stone dykes on the higher  
 ground to larger rectangular fields   
 bounded by hawthorn hedges on the     
 lower ground. There are some large    
 patches of conifers to the east. Lines
 of trees shelter fields from the      
 prevailing westerlies.                </content>
