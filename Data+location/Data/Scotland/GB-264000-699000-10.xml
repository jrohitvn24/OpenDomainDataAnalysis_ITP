 The two most common pets in Thornhill,
 as in the whole country,are dogs and  
 cats.Most people have either a dog or 
 cat or even both.However,two families 
 keep goats.One of these has 3 female  
 or nanny goats.Sometimes the milk is  
 sold for medicinal purposes-it is used
 to help some skin troubles.The kids   
 when born ,are usually given away.Most
 farmers'children have a pony because  
 they have the proper facilities and   
 grazing for them.Other people keep    
 mice,hamsters or even"simple to keep  
 goldfish".Two people in the village   
 own ferrets which they use to catch   
 rabbits.Another of our pet favourites 
 is the budgie and the rabbit because  
 you don't have to take them for walks.
