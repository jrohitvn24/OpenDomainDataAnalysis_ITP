		<content> The people in this area do not reveal 
 their private affairs very readily    
 e.g. to a question concerning         
 political support{60%}replied{"NO     
{COMMENT"}. In this area there is a    
 great feeling towards traditional     
 views e.g. the home &amp; family life and 
 socialising in groups.This is probably
 a result of the mining and iron making
 background of this area i.e. unity in 
 the struggle. With the change in the  
 economic background with the          
 disappearance of these industries this
 could change.There is also a strong   
 underlying feeling of belonging to a  
 part of the area e.g. to Cambusnethan,
 Newmains, Greenhead, Morningside,     
 Coltness, Waterloo.There is also a    
{"Them and Us "}feeling between local  
 authority and private housing people  
 this might change as more local auth. 
 people enter the private market.      </content>
