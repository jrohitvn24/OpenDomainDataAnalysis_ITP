   Two power stations are in this area.
   Glenlee uses water brought 3.5      
 miles by tunnel and pipeline from     
 Clatteringshaws.With a net head of 370
 feet, high speed equipment is used to 
 output a load of 68 megawatts.        
   Earlstoun uses the dammed Water of  
 Ken and operates under a net head of  
 only 69 feet.It uses special          
 alternators which have economic       
 advantages for low head, low speed    
 systems.Its peak load is 12 megawatts.
 With its sister station Carsfad,it is 
 normally operated remotely from       
 Glenlee.                              
   The maximum output of the Galloway  
 Hydros is only 105.3 megawatts but    
 because this power can be generated   
 within minutes, the S.S.E.B. uses it  
 to feed into the national grid to top 
 up supplies at times of peak demand.  </content>
