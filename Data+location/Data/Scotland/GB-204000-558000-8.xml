		<title>08GALLOWAY CREAMERY -STRANRAER</title>
		<content>  The Galloway Creamery was built in   
{1933,}but was rebuilt in 1966, due to 
 the increasing butter and cheese      
 demand in the area. The new building  
 was opened by HRH The Princess        
 Margaret. The creamery gets its milk  
 from farms in the area. Some of these 
 are Gallahill, Dunbae and Knockglass. 
 The milk is taken to the creamery in 1
 of 16 milk tankers which visit the    
 farms daily. The creamery can handle  
 up to{800 000 litres of milk}and{240  
{000 litres}of this is used in{cheese  
{making,}the rest is for{butter        
{produce.}The creamery now makes Feta  
 cheese, a strong, white cheese with a 
 rubbery texture. It is wrapped in the 
 same way as butter. The production of 
 Feta cheese started in October 1983.  
 It is mainly for export to Iran.
