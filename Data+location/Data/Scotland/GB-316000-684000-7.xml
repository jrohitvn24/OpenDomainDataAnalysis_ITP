		<content>                                       
 In our area there are many restaurants
 and cafes all of them are in the      
 village of{Aberdour.}One of them is an
{Italian}restaurant called{"La Toscana"
 where the favorite food's are fish and
 meat cooked{Italian}style.Other places
 to eat are a cafe called{"Upstairs    
{Downstairs"}and a{"coffee and snack   
{shop"}in the High street.We did a     
 survey and discovered that roughly{30%
 of the children in our class say      
 their parents go out for a meal in    
{Aberdour}.Since{Aberdour}is a holiday 
 resort there are many hotels that do  
 bar lunches,among them are the        
{"Woodside Hotel"}the{"Aberdour Hotel" 
 and the{"Fairways Hotel".}Out of 100  
 children{64%}of them go out for a meal
 every month and{8%}go out every week.
