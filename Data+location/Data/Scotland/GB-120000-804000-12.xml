 On Canna and Sanday there are 17      
 buildings with roofs on which are or  
 have been houses.Their current use is 
 as follows:                           
 6 are permanently occupied            
 2 provide accomodation for up to 18   
   people organised by the National    
   Trust for Scotland                  
 1 is a privately owned house, not     
   permanently occupied, used by       
   visitors to the island              
 1 is used as a workshop               
 3 are habitable but would require work
   such as the installation of indoor  
   toilets and bathrooms to become     
   permanent dwellings                 
 1 house is currently being renovated  
 3 have no facilities at all and if it 
   were not for the roofs would be     
   ruins.1 of these will soon be a     
   steading and workshop.              </content>
