		<content> In 1985, 312 calves were born, 246 of 
 which will be sold. Two out of the six
 farms are involved in showing their   
 animals. There are quite a few local  
 shows for this purpose. All six farms 
 are of stone-built construction, the  
 oldest dating back five hundred years 
 and the most recent forty five years. 
 Each is a traditionally built farm    
 with courtyards and a variety of sheds
 for keeping animals, implements and   
 storage of grain, hay and silage. Most
 of the farms have a good selection of 
 implements for their own use although 
 three of the farms hire a combine     
 harvester, the cost of buying one     
 being too expensive for the amount of 
 arable land available.
