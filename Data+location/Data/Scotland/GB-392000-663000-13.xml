		<title>13OLD AND NEW TOWN EYEMOUTH</title>
		<content> Very little remains of Eyemouth Old   
 Town,once a warren of wynds and       
 vennels dating from the 17th          
 C,although there is still evidence of 
 this in buildings around the harbour  
 and in Home St.,where sandstone houses
 have walls two feet thick.The design  
 of the Old Town gave protection from  
 storms and also helped foil excisemen 
 when Eyemouth had a reputation for    
 smuggling.Deanhead housing scheme     
 built in 1970 incorporated many old   
 fishing town features.Modern"vennels" 
 give communal access to the rear of   
 the houses.Small gardens are a        
 reminder of how little time fishermen 
 had for gardening.Bright paintwork    
 recalls how fishermen used left-over  
 paint from their boats to brighten up 
 their houses.Special cobbled areas add
 further character to the scene.
