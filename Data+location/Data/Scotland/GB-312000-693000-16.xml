		<content> Prior to the advent of coal mining,   
 Kelty was predominantly rural.  There 
 were several small pits operating in  
 the area but towards the end of the   
 19th Century three fairly large pits  
 were sunk.  These were the Lindsay,   
 1896, right on the outskirts of the   
 village.  Another two were, the       
 Aitken, 1893 and Lumphinans no. 11,   
 1896.  Both these two pits were within
 a mile of the village.  The           
 population, by 1912, had risen to     
 nearly 9,000.  All the pits in the    
 area are now closed and the village   
 has a population of just over 5,000.  
 Kelty has suffered adversely with the 
 closure of the local pits because     
 there has been very little alternative
 employment provided.
