		<title>01INTRODUCING WEST KILBRIDE</title>
		<content>{West Kilbride is a small village on   
{the Firth of Clyde.}It stands         
 about one kilometre from the shore    
 which is a lovely sandy beach and     
 stretches for three to four kilometres
 along the coast. The{Isle of Arran    
 lies like a "sleeping warrior" about  
 twentyfive kilometres across the      
 firth. The{village population is 4500.
                                       
{The village lies amids dairy          
{farmland, bordered by high hills and  
{moorland.}It has two castles, although
 one is really in Portencross. The     
 other,Law Castle,will soon be restored
 and inhabited. There is a large main  
 street with all the shops you would   
 need, including _ two chemists,a cafe,
 a restaurant and health-food shop. We 
 also have three churches, two public  
 halls, a railway station and several  
 public houses.                        </content>
