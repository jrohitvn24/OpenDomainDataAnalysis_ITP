 At the time when the great Border     
 Abbeys were being formed, King David I
 of Scotland granted land at Midlem to 
 the monks of Selkirk, who moved to    
 Kelso in 1128. A mill, brewhouse and  
 twenty-nine husbandlands were         
 established at Midlem and various     
 transactions between the monks and    
 tenants are reported in Kelso Abbey   
 records.                              
{                                      
{In 1643,}Bowden Parish Church's first 
 recorded list of Heritors includes the
 lairds of Midlem Mill, Kippilaw and   
 Langside, the tenants of Clarilaw and 
 Prieston Farms and several men of     
 Midlem Village. Bowden Kirk being     
 without a minister in 1739, the Duke  
 of Roxburghe nominated James Hume but 
 the feuars objected to his right of   
 patronage.                            </content>
