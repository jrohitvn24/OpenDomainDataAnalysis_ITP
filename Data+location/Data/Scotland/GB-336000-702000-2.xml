     The present Durie House was built 
 in 1762,although Durie Estate goes    
 back to about the 14th Century. The   
 Christie family came over with William
 the Conqueror.                        
     The name Durie means place of many
 springs several of which are still    
 there.                                
     The present Letham Glen was bought
 by Mr John Letham in 1925 from        
 Christie of Durie and was given to the
 town of Leven.                        
       The great great grandfather of  
 Mr Christie (the present owner) was a 
 midshipman on H.M.S. Bellerophon the  
 ship to which Napoleon surrendered to 
 of the coast of Normandy in August    
 1815.(H.M.S.Bellerophon was one of the
  ships which fought at the Battle of  
 Trafalgar,under the command of        
 Vice-Admiral Collingwood.)            </content>
