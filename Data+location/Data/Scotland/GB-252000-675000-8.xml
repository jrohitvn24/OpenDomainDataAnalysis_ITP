		<content>  Mr. Alistair Forbes told us of       
 Craigton 60 years ago when he was a   
 boy. He told us that then there were  
 no taxis or buses to take the children
 to school so each person had to       
 walk.The school outside looked much   
 the same but inside the desks were    
 arranged in tiers and had lids which  
 lifted up.Inside you kept your books. 
       The road was untarred and       
 covered in whinstone from the local   
 quarry (the old Craigangawn Quarry,   
 now disused).In winter when the nights
 were cold and the lamps were lit, Mr  
 Forbes and his family had to amuse    
 themselves.Sometimes they would skate 
 on Craigton  Loch which is no longer  
 there.The farmers would take lamps    
 there in the evenings so that they    
 could curl.Frequently in the evenings 
 people got together at someone's house
 or the school for social evenings.    </content>
