  The land to the west of the block is 
mainly rough grazing with sheep and    
some cattle. The area around the river 
is more fertile and is used to grow    
various crops; wheat, barley, potatoes,
and hay. The eastern edge of the block 
is also wooded and is used for hatching
and rearing pheasant for sport.        
  Rough shooting takes place over most 
of the area. The following animals and 
birds are hunted: rabbits, hares, duck,
geese, snipe, pheasant, and grouce.    
  Fishing takes place on the Allan     
Water for trout and salmon. Fishing    
permits can be purchased for various   
stretches of water.                    
  There is also horse riding to be had 
in the area where the champion jockey, 
Willie Carson, learned to ride as a    
schoolboy.
