		<content>        Local Authority Housing is     
 classified in two groups.             
 (a) Flats (4 in a block) and          
 semi-detached cottages built about    
 1919.                                 
 (b) Post war from 1948 which are a mix
 of Multi-Storey (3 or more high),     
 Terraced Rows, Maisonettes and        
 semi-detached houses.                 
        The Housing Manager has 2400   
 houses under her control.             
        When financial restrictions are
 lifted, demolition of housing in an   
 area known as Cooper Ha' is to be     
 considered.                           
        420 houses are owner-occupied, 
 which category should increase if     
 tenants  buy their council houses.    
        The N.C.B and farmers own      
 property in this area.
