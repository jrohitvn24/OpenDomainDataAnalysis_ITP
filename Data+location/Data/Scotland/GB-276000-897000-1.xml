		<title>01The Mound, Sutherland</title>
		<content> The trunk road to wick, the A9,       
 crosses the mound and curves towards  
 Golspie. The mound is an artificial   
 embankment bearing te road (and       
 formerly the railway branch line to   
 Dornoch, now closed). At the NE end   
 are tidal sluices where salmon lie in 
 Loch Fleet waiting for the flood tide 
 to open the gates and let them move up
 river Fleet. This is a great tourist  
 attraction and a car park has been    
 made on the Mound. To the NW is Strath
 Fleet and the wooded marsh called 'The
 Alders' which was tidal estuary until 
 the mound blocked it off. SE, Loch    
 Fleet mostly dries out at low tide.   
 Both sides are a nature conservancy   
 reserve. N of the mound, the Lairg    
 road (A839) joins the A9, both        
 double-track, and a single track road 
 to Bonar bridge runs up W from the S  
 Side of the mound.                    </content>
