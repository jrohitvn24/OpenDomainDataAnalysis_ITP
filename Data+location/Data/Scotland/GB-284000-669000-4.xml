		<title>04LIMERIGG CROFTING 3</title>
		<content> Mrs Kay is able to relate some very   
 interesting stories pertaining to the 
 area. She remembers when the village  
 had no plumbed-in water and the women 
 used to drag their clothes on a       
 wooden "sledge" up the hill to the    
 Black Loch where they would do their  
 washing.                              
 Things have changed considerably in   
 the village as most of the present    
 houses were built after World War II, 
 but Mrs Kay's croft remains very      
 similar to what it was. She and her   
 husband,now in their eighties,along   
 with their handicapped son in his     
 fifties would appear to be thriving on
 their lifestyle which still           
 incorporates long hours of hard work  
 and lots of good,country-fresh air.   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
