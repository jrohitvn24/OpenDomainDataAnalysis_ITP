		<content> The Monks of Reading soon gave up     
 living on the island but they         
 continued for another 250 years until 
 1549, to manage and harvest the       
 produce.                              
 St Adrian's island was one of the most
 noted places of pilgrimage in Scotland
 and the scene of many reputed miracles
 in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. 
 Among its pilgrims were Scottish Kings
 and Queens.                           
 In the early 16th century the island  
 was used as an isolation centre.      
 One of the first lighthouses in       
 Scotland was erected on the Isle by   
 Alexander Cunningham in 1636.         
 There was a village on the May during 
 the 17th and 18th centuries. One of   
 the occupations of the inhabitants was
 smuggling. The caves around the Island
 afford excellent places for hiding    
 contraband.                           </content>
