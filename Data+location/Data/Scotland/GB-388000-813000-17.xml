{2. VICTORIA STREET                    
{  }Victoria Street is the old main    
    road through the town. It has a    
    number of{small shops}along it eg  
    a Mace Supermarket, a newsagent    
    (Forbouys). There are also banks   
    and a hairdresser in the street.   
    People we spoke to said they often 
    shopped here and were locals or    
    they were passing through and      
    stopped to buy a newspaper or other
    small item because it was possible 
    to park their car.                 
    It is also an important street for 
   {old age pensioners}as they collect 
    their pensions in the Mace which is
    also the Post Office.
