  CREEL AND NET MAKING                 
                                       
   Fishing and industries connected    
 with fishing such as creel making and 
 net making used to be very important  
 in Hilton of Cadboll.It takes about   
 four hours to make a creel.Most people
 still make their own creels.To make a 
 creel you need cane,net and wood for  
 the base.People have been taught to   
 make creels because it is impossible  
 to make them without training.        
    The fishing industries were very   
 important at the end of the nineteenth
 century but they are not so important 
 now.Nearly all the men and women in   
 the area used to work at the fishing  
 industries when all the fish were     
 sold.Now people keep them and         
 deep-freeze them.Fishing is now more  
 popular as a sport.                   </content>
