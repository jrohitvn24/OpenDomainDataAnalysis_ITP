		<title>04SUMMER FARMING AT CARSPHAIRN</title>
		<content>{CLIPPING}At the beginning of June the 
 hog clipping starts.(Hogs are last    
 year's lambs).Most farms clip with    
 electric shears, although sometimes   
 hand clippers are used. Each fleece is
 rolled up and put into a tall sack.   
 Someone gets into the sack and stamps 
 the wool down.When the hogs have been 
 clipped, they are buisted. (That means
 that they are marked with keil).The   
 keil shows where the hogs belong on   
 the farm.The tups are clipped next and
 their wool is put into a different    
 sack.In July the ewes are clipped.    
{DIPPING}Dipping at this time of year  
 is compulsory, and takes place during 
 July and August.The sheep are dipped  
 to prevent scab, as well as blow flies
 and keds.                             
{INOCULATIONS}During the year the sheep
 are inoculated against various        
 diseases.                             </content>
