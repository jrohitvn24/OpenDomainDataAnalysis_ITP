		<title>18THE TELEVISION RECEPTION</title>
		<content> Eight years ago with the help of the  
 BBC and a contractor organised by     
 locals a cabled system of TV and VHF  
 radio was installed at the cost of the
 villagers assisted by a local         
 authority grant. A receiving mast was 
 erected on the hill behind the village
 to obtain signals transmitted from a  
 mast on Mull. The cable is wearing out
 so again with the advice of the BBC   
 and funded as before, a new system of 
 TV signals transmitted by three active
 deflectors through the air to aerials 
 on the individual houses is being     
 installed. The deflectors will get    
 their signals from the existing mast  
 which is being modified to obtain a   
 better and stonger signal from the    
 VHF television station at Dalmally.   
 This time the work is being done by a 
 local resident with the help of his   
 troop of Venture Scouts.              </content>
