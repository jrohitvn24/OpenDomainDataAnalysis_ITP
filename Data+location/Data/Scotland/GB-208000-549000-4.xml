     Farming is more difficult than it 
 looks. On our farm we only keep sheep,
 but they have to be looked after very 
 carefully in the Spring when they are 
 having their lambs; they have to be   
 shorn in the summer; and we have to   
 grow fodder to keep them alive through
 the winter.                           
     In our Block the main type of     
 farming is Dairy Farming. Dairy       
 farmers get up VERY early in the      
 morning to milk their cows, some as   
 early as 3-00am so that they can get  
 three milkings in a day. Not many do  
 this of course.                       
     The main breeds of cattle used for
 these milking herds are Ayrshires and 
 Fresians; although there are herds of 
 Jerseys and Holsteins in the district.
 Most farmers tend to stick to their   
 own breed, claiming them to be best.  </content>
