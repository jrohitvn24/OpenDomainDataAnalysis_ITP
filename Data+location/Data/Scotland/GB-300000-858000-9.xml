 On television we get information      
 services called Teletext, Oracle and  
 Ceefax.   Teletext provides words     
 along with normal TV programmes on BBC
 and ITV.   It's free to everybody who 
 has a Teletext adaptor fitted to their
 set.                                  
  Another Information Service is the   
 telephone where you can get recipes,  
 the time, stories, the weather,the    
 news,gardening, as well as many other 
 things.All these extra services cost  
 money.                                
   The Public Library is another source
 of information-books, cassettes,      
 films, slides, reference books and    
 encyclopedias can be borrowed from    
 there. Forres Library is open to the  
 public and is free.
