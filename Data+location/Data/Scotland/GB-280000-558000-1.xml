		<content>{This area is predominantly rural with 
{a small residential development and a 
{few industries and trades occurring   
{within it.                            
{The farms include dairy and           
{stock-rearing on grassland,both       
{intensively managed and rough grazing 
{with some arable cropping.            
{The river Urr meanders its way across 
{the area on its way to the Solway at  
{Palnackie. Along its banks granite is 
{extracted,made into blocks and used to
{mix concrete.  An old mill which once 
{used its water is now a distribution  
{depot for agricultural supplies.      
{At the quiter end of Dalbeattie High  
{Street behind an unlikely facade is   
{housed a busy garment manufacturer.As 
{this road leads to forrest walks it   
{passes the few traders in the area.The
{leisure facilities include river      
{fishing and playing fields. }         </content>
