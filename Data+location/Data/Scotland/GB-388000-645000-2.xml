		<content> The population of the parish is now   
 about 500 having been at a peak of    
 1,033 in 1851; the village itself has 
 a population of 370, having peaked at 
 733 in 1851 when most people worked in
 the village in what must have been a  
 very self-contained community. Now    
 many people from the village work in  
 Berwick, although there are about 25  
 net fishermen and as many farmworkers 
 in the parish.                        
    Children under school leaving age  
 (16)  amount to approximately 90 in   
 the parish in a country where the     
 average age of the population is      
 getting older.                        
    School leavers find employment in  
 the small factories of Berwick 7 miles
 away or move to the cities to live and
 either work or further there studies.
