		<title>19THE KIRN AT SANDWICK</title>
		<content>   On the Ness of Cumliewick there is a
 large hole known as the kirn. The     
 hole is approx.30ft. in diameter.     
 There is a cave in the cliffs nearby  
 and on a calm day a small boat can go 
 into the cave and after travelling in 
 the dark tunnel will reach the kirn.  
 We tried throwing stones into the kirn
 and listening  to hear the echoes and 
 the length of  time taken for the     
 stones to reach the bottom.           
   Nowadays the kirn is fenced to      
 prevent sheep and visitors falling in.
   There is a story that a long time   
 ago a ship was wrecked on the headland
 and the sailors scrambled ashore.They 
 formed a line, holding hands, and     
 proceeded towards a light in the      
 distance. Those in the middle of the  
 line  fell into the kirn and only     
 those on the end survived to tell the 
 story.                                </content>
