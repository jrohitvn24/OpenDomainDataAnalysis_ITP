		<content> The area is mostly Forestry Commission
 land, salt &amp; fresh water lochs.       
 There is a forestry village, an out   
 door centre; a primary school, post   
 office and shop, 3 farms and scattered
 houses.                               
 The roads are single track with       
 passing places with the exception of  
 the immediate village road which is   
 double track.                         
 The hills are very rough with         
 bracken,grass, moss and heather &amp; are 
 full of wild life.                    
 The upper land is most suitable for   
 hill sheep and a few sea level areas  
 for beef cattle.                      
 Planting and felling is a continuous  
 process. The forest is thick and cool 
 with peaty ground.                    
 The sea is used for fishing,swimming, 
 canoeing and sailing.
