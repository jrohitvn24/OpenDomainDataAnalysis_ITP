		<content>  In my street there is a bus depot.You
 might think this is good but it is    
 not.The buses spread fumes all round  
 the street and sometimes the buses    
 keep us awake at night. The people    
 across the road from the bus station  
 don't bother to keep their gardens    
 looking good because the fumes from   
 the buses just ruin their gardens.    
 Sometimes buses have diesel leaking   
 from them and cars might not see this 
 oil and skid and crash.Also the       
 employees at the depot park in the    
 residents parking spaces.This often   
 happens to us while we are out at the 
 shops and we have to park further away
 from the house and it takes us a while
 to take the shopping back to the      
 house.The people in my street have    
 written to the local press about      
 this and we are hoping that the depot 
 will be moved.                        </content>
