		<title>16Our Farm Visit No.2.</title>
		<content> On Thursday 16th. May 1985 Derek      
 Mackenzie and I went to{Kirkton Farm  
 to ask some questions about what the  
 farmer grew in his fields and what    
 kind of farm animals he had.We were   
 like the commisioners who collected   
 similar information in 1086 for       
 William the Conqueror.                
    Mr.Lindsay,the farmer answered all 
 our questions.See Derek's account     
 no.10. We recorded his answers on to a
{tape recorder.                        
     After we had finished the         
 interview Mrs.Lindsay gave us each a  
 can of Fanta.Derek comes from the     
{Hebrides}and Mr.Lindsay knew the area 
 because his grandfather,father and he 
 himself went fishing every year to a  
 loch very near to where Derek was     
 born.He showed us a stone from the    
 loch;a souvenier of a good day's      
{fishing.}Dean Stirton primary 6.      </content>
