		<content> Majority of families made up of 4     
 people most of which are Mum, Dad     
 and 2 children. Many of these families
 live in MOD houses.  Most houses use  
 electricity as their main fuel and    
 this is mostly used for cooking, light
 ing and heating.  Of houses that have 
 pets, dogs found the most popular.    
 Other pets include cats, rabbits,     
 hamsters, mice, fish (goldfish and    
 many tropical) and birds like budgies,
 canaries and parrots.                 
 In spare time children mostly play    
 outdoor games, watch television, play 
 computer games and Scrabble with      
 parents.  People used to buy food     
 daily at the local foodstore but now  
 that new Fine Fare opened in Helens-  
 burgh many people buy their food      
 weekly or monthly. Some people even   
 buy milk weekly and freeze it!
