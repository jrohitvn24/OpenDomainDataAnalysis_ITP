		<title>17RUBISLAW QUARRY, ABERDEEN</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 The grey granite for which Aberdeen is
 famous was mainly extracted from      
 Rubislaw Quarry which was begun in    
 1740 and ceased production in 1969    
 when, with a depth of over 150m, it   
 was one of the world's largest        
 quarries. Since then, the quarry has  
 begun to fill with water and has posed
 problems for the council as to how    
 the site should be developed. Plans   
 for a unique quarry view hotel and    
 suggestions for use as a rubbish dump 
 were discarded in favour of new       
 buildings to house the offices of     
 major oil companies, Marathon, Britoil
 and Conoco.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
