		<content>  There is only one reputed ghost in   
 this area of Muckhart. At Cowden      
 Castle(which has now been demolished) 
 a small part was left standing to     
 accomodate the ghost of a Bishop, a   
 former owner.Bad luck was to follow   
 the family of anyone who left the     
 Bishop homeless.                      
 Witches were once claimed to hold     
 Covens in the secluded Glens and these
 places remain eerie to this day.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
