 My dad phones up the firm in Inverness
 and a man comes down in a van to give 
 him the spare parts. At the back of   
 the garage there are about fifty old  
 cars and a few vans. At one time the  
 yard was getting full up so my dad and
 uncle got a JCB to come in and dig a  
 big hole in the soil near the beach.  
 In about two days time it was finished
 and they pushed some of the cars into 
 it. Then they filled it in. The garage
  is about four and a half miles from  
 Cromarty and is the last building on  
 the road out of Jemimaville village.
