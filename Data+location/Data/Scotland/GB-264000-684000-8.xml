		<title>08Population East: FINTRY</title>
		<content> 24 Adults (3 pensioners) 10 children. 
 About half the families have children.
                                       
 This is a sparsely peopled area, even 
 by our standards. It's higher up and  
 more rugged, but many still associate 
 themselves with Fintry. One such, away
 at grid ref. 715.874 has run the      
 Sunday School for many years.         
                                       
 Strung out along the B818 Denny road  
 are 3 farming families and one more   
 near the B822 Lennoxtown road.        
                                       
 The family at Loch Walton supervises  
 the fishing, while another maintains  
 the pumping station for the Carron    
 Reservoir.                            
                                       
 The remaining four households have    
 no special local connections.
