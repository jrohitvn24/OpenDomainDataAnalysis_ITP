		<title>02THE LOCAL AREA</title>
		<content>  The local area is made up of six     
 villages:                             
 Holytown                              
 Cleland                               
 Newarthill                            
 New Stevenston                        
 Jerviston                             
 Carfin                                
  Five of these villages are           
 inter_connected.  There are close     
 links between the villages.  They all 
 share the use of two secondary schools
 which pupils travel to by bus or on   
 foot.                                 
  The area is littered with abandoned  
 works.  Old mine shafts have caused   
 subsidence in some areas.  Empty and  
 run_down factories can be seen        
 throughout the area  and large areas  
 of waste ground which once sited large
 factories are scattered throughout the
 villages.                             </content>
