		<title>03Crop Farming, Fearn.</title>
		<content> The farming life in our area is       
 arable-based,mostly barley,wheat and  
 stock rearing.Most farms are around   
 300-400 acres in size with a whole    
 range of associated buildings and     
 machinery.Winter and spring barley    
 occupy the biggest acreage.This is    
 used for animal feed and malting.Wheat
 is not grown on such a scale, but what
 is produced is sent south for flour   
 manufacture.Hay is extensively used   
 for stock feeding in winter.Some grass
 is cut and used as silage.This is     
 stored in long pits, packed in plastic
 bags or stored in a large silo.Field  
 sizes are large to improve            
 efficiency.This also means that large 
 machines can be utilised.At harvest   
 time, most farms use up to three      
 combines to cut the crops.Crops tend  
 to be dried on the farm.
