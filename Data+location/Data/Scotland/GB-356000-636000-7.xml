		<content> In the 13th century{Thomas the Rhymer,
 a poet and prophet,whose real name was
 Thomas Learmont,lived in Rhymer's     
 Tower which is now a ruin.He made many
 predictions.The legend of True Thomas 
 tells how he was taken away by the    
 Fairy Queen to Elfland where he wasn't
 to speak for seven years.The Queen    
 gifted him with a tongue which would  
 never lie.This earned him the name of 
 True Thomas. He then returned to his  
 home where local people could hardly  
 believe what they saw.Later in his    
 life he was called back by the Fairy  
 Queen when two white deer came to his 
 tower. There is a plaque in his memory
 on the church wall and also a plaque  
 on the ruined tower.
