 Many organisations exist in the       
 community.   There is a Women's Guild 
 attached to the church whose purpose  
 is to raise money for local  needs and
 the wider work of the church including
 their overseas missions: to interest  
 themselves in matters relating to the 
 church and to deepen their knowledge  
 and understanding of Christian        
 teaching.   The Scottish Women's Rural
 Institute have a branch here. It's aim
 is to encourage it's members in the   
 skills of baking,sewing and other home
 crafts.In the spring they hold a      
 bulb,baking and craft show when prizes
 are given for the  best exhibit. Their
 advice is often                       
 sought on matters concerning the home.
 There is an active parent's group in  
 the school and a Mother's/toddlers    
 group meet there weekly.              </content>
