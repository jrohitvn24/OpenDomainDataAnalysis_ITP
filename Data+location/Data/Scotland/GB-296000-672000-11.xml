		<title>11Hill and Upland Farming</title>
		<content> There are two main types of farming in
 the area around Torphichen - Hill and 
 Upland farming and Stock and Arable.  
 Many farms in the area were dairy     
 farms until about ten years ago but   
 had to change because of the economic 
 climate. The majority of the farms    
 round this area are Hill and Upland   
 farms because the ground is not       
 fertile enough for crops, so it is    
 used for rough grazing. Most of the   
 sheep are crossbreeds of Blackface and
 Leicester. The reason for this        
 crossbreeding is to produce a         
 good-sized sturdy ewe. The lambing    
 season is between March and April, but
 even in this small area there can be a
 time variation of about 2 to 3 weeks. 
 The higher up you get the later the   
 lambing.
