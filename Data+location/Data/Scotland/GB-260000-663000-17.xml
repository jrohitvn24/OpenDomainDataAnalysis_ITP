		<content> Built in 1975 because of an increase  
 in the number of homeless men in the  
 city. It is run by Glasgow District   
 Council and caters for 254 men who    
 must be over the age of 18. They can  
 stay as long as they wish and many    
 have been there since it opened. All  
 the men in the unit at present are    
 unemployed. The money for their rent  
 comes from the Social Security. The   
 cost is Â£38.50 per week or Â£5.50 per  
 day. The accommodation is a single    
 room per person. The facilities are   
 two recreation rooms, a laundry,      
 bathrooms, showers and a canteen for  
 buying meals. Men come and go as they 
 wish and are given as normal a living 
 situation as possible.                
 The staff is made up of two           
 supervisors, four porters, cleaners   
 and canteen workers.
