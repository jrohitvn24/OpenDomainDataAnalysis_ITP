		<content> Our block contains part of the        
 village of{Auldearn.}The village is   
 bisected by the main{Inverness        
{-Aberdeen Road.}The heavy traffic flow
 through the village causes            
 considerable problems for the         
 residents.Some residents have their   
 front doors less than a metre from the
 roadway and most winters at least one 
 house suffers damage from vehicles    
 colliding with it.{Plans}have been    
 made for many years for a{bi-pass}for 
 the village but as yet the work has   
 not begun.                            
 On the outskirts of the village is a{ 
{Dovecot}owned by the{National trust   
 for{Scotland.                         
{Auldearn}is famous for being the last 
 place in Scotland to burn a witch at  
 the stake.{Isobel Gowdie}was tried for
 witchcraft in{April 1662.
