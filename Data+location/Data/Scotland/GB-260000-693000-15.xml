		<title>15FARMING IN ARNPRIOR</title>
		<content> Of the 10 farms approximately 950     
 acres are arable, but some hay and    
 silage is also taken from land        
 identified as pasture. The predominant
 crops are barley (540 acres) and hay  
 (420 acres), but other crops include  
 wheat (34 acres), rape (32 acres),    
 oats (65 acres), turnips (60 acres),  
 peas (30 acres), and potatoes (15     
 acres).  One farmer also has 4 acres  
 of strawberries and the 3 tons of     
 fruit yielded are sold either directly
 to visitors or to the Glagow fruit    
 market.  Typical yields per acre for  
 other crops are 2 tons of barley, 3   
 tons of hay, 4 tons of wheat, and 12  
 tons of potatoes.  Most of the crops  
 are used or sold for animal fodder,   
 but the barley is often sold for      
 malting for whisky.
