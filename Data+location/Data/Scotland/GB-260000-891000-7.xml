		<title>07WHALES AT BONAR BRIDGE</title>
		<content>{In October 1927}a school of{false     
{killer whales}was sighted in the      
 Dornoch Firth by a keeper at Fearn.   
      It is thought that the leader    
 whale was shot and the rest of the    
 whales lost their bearings and  were  
 stranded by the tide on the shore from
 Bonar Bridge to Ardgay.               
     At that time it was thought that  
 false killer whales were extinct.The  
  whales were towed by boat to a       
 temporary whaling station at the Doune
 of Creich, where they were cut up and 
 disposed of.                          
     Two of the whales were sent to    
 museums in London and New York.
