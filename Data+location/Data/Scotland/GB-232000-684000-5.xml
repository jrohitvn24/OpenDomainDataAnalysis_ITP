		<title>05The Trees of Arden</title>
		<content> About one sixth of the area is covered
 with woods.  Most of the trees are    
 deciduous but there are some conifer  
 plantations in the Crosskeys area and 
 in Glen Fruin.  The trees in these    
 plantations are Sitka Spruce and Scots
 Pine.  Many of the woods are a mixture
 of deciduous trees and conifers.   The
 oak is the most common type of tree.  
 The birch is second and the ash, beech
 and sycamore are third. There are also
 holly, willow, larch, hazel, fir, pine
 and horse chestnut.   The spruce is   
 used for christmas trees.  Conifers   
 are used for pulp.  Stobs are made    
 from any of the trees.   The woods    
 provide cover for the birds and are   
 useful for wind breaks.
