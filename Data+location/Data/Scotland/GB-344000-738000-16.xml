		<title>16Churches, North Murroes</title>
		<content>   The main church in this area is the 
 Church of Scotland.                   
   The minister at Murroes is the Rev. 
 Helen Johnstone. She was the{first }  
{lady minister}in Dundee. In 1983      
 Tealing Church united with Murroes and
 was then linked with Auchterhouse.    
 Tealing Church then closed, but is    
 reopening soon as a{heritage centre  }
 with exhibits from all over Scotland. 
  Recently the Rev.G. Mackenzie took   
 over from Mr. Chisholm at Monikie.    
{Monikie and Newbigging}which had been 
 linked were then united. At present   
 both churches are still being used.   
                                       
   Most Church of Scotland members in  
 the area attend either Murroes or     
 Monikie, but members of other churches
 eg. the Episcopal or Roman Catholic   
 Churches, must worship in Broughty    
 Ferry or Dundee.                      </content>
