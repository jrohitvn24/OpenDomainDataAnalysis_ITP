		<title>17SOUTH-AYR ALLOWAY LOCAL SHOP</title>
		<content>   Our local shop is{Alloway Post      
{Office}which is situated opposite     
 Burns' Cottage. Burns' souvenirs,     
 keyrings and newspapers are sold. In  
 one corner of the shop you can buy    
 stamps, weigh your parcels and        
 collect your pension or children's    
 benefits. Often Mums will go to the   
 post office to buy items like stamps  
 and post-cards if they can't get      
 into Ayr because Dad has the car.     
 Sometimes we are sent to collect the  
 family allowance and allowed to buy a 
 mix-up bag of sweets with the change. 
 Ice lollies and canned drinks are     
 popular during the summer. There      
 is a small sign on the outside wall   
 that says, "No bicycles allowed" but  
 no-one takes very much notice of it   
 and we dump our bikes there anyway.
