		<content> Lestwalt Primary School was built in  
 1873 to provide that education        
 required by a rural community of the  
 later 19th C, for pupils from the age 
 of 5 to 14.  This it has continued to 
 do, making changes as required by an  
 everchanging society and the          
 educational mores of the day. A       
 two-roomed school with a fine school- 
 house, the building has changed       
 little; an added dining-room and in   
 1985, an inside toilet block.         
 Increasing numbers required a tin hut 
 extension in the 50's, since          
 demolished.  Transfer of 12+ pupils to
 Stranraer and the present decline in  
 numbers has reduced staff to 2        
 full-time and 3 part-time and 41      
 pupils.  Technology has, however,     
 crept in and we make full use of      
 computers, videos and other electronic
 wonders of our age.                   </content>
