		<title>05Boat Building in Norham</title>
		<content> Boats built by Simpsons of Norham are 
 14 Feet 6 inches long, and 4 Feet 9   
 Inches wide.                          
    Originally all raw materials were  
 provided locally, but prices are no   
 longer competitive and wood is brought
 in from other parts of the country.   
    In recent years the number of      
 boats being commissioned has declined 
 due to the increasing use of Fibre-   
 glass boats, the high price of wood,  
 and the general decline of the net    
 salmon fishing in the area.           
    This is especially true in the case
 of the salmon coble, as one hasn't    
 been built in Norham in over 4 years. 
    The Simpsons, masters of their     
 craft, create a boat without referring
 to any plans and use only a couple    
 of cross-sectional templates.         
     Their boats are unique in design  
 and quality.                          </content>
