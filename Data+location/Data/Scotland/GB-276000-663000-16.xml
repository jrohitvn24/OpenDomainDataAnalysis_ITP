		<title>16SOCIAL SURVEY-LEISURE.</title>
		<content> WE CARRIED OUT A SURVEY AMONGST ADULTS
 IN AIRDRIE ON HOW THEY SPEND THEIR    
 LEISURE TIME. THIS IS THE INFORMATION 
 WE COLLECTED. IT WOULD APPEAR FROM OUR
 SURVEY THAT QUITE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE  
 DO NOT KNOW WHAT LEISURE FACILITIES   
 ARE AVAILABLE FOR THEM. COMMENTS SUCH 
 AS "WE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK" AND  
 "I HAVN'T SEEN THESE THINGS           
 ADVERTISED" WERE QUITE COMMON. THOSE  
 PEOPLE WE INTERVIEWED WHO KNEW OF THE 
 FACILITIES ADMITTED THAT THEY DIDN'T  
 MAKE GOOD USE OF THEM. "I HAVEN'T GOT 
 THE TIME" WAS A COMMON COMPLAINT,     
 ESPECIALLY FROM THE MOTHERS OF YOUNG  
 CHILDREN.                             
     THE TYPES OF FACILITIES THAT ARE  
 AVAILABLE INCLUDE AREAS FOR PLAYING   
 SQUASH,BADMINTON,FOOTBALL,TENNIS,TABLE
 -TENNIS AND POOL. THESE SPORTS AND    
 OTHER PASTIMES CAN BE CARRIED OUT AT  
 VARIUOS COMMUNITY CENTRES-SWIMMING TOO</content>
