		<content>   The school was built in             
 approximately 1903.Before that there  
 was a school known as the 'Madras     
 School'. It is now a ruin on the      
 hillside.The school serves            
 the whole parish of Stenness and only 
 rarely takes pupils from outside the  
 parish.At the moment it is the        
 smallest school on the Mainland(the   
 main island)of Orkney.41 pupils attend
 this school and there are two teachers
 and three visiting teachers.There are 
 seven classes in the school with on   
 average six pupils in each class.One  
 of the teachers teaches classes1,2 and
 3 and the other teacher,classes 4 to  
 7.Most children come to school by     
 mini-bus or car.the school uses the   
 local community centre for gym and    
 music lessons.Most children take      
 school dinners which are brought in   
 from a school kitchen 3 miles away.   </content>
