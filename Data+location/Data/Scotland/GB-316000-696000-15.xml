		<content>  When you go on a bike you have to    
 watch because dogs chase you and jump 
 up on you. There are hundreds of dogs 
 in Ballingry.

  We have two greyhounds. They get two 
 meals a day- at about 7.30am and 6pm. 
 We have a cupboard full of things for 
 the dogs: glucose, cod liver oil,leads
 brushes, muzzles, haps to keep them   
 dry, sardines for when they race and  
 towels. The nearest track is Thornton.

  At the bus stop there is a lot of    
 activity at about five o'clock. This  
 is because everybody finishes their   
 work at about that time. Men carry    
 piece bags and flasks and some have   
 'Daily Records' under their arms.     
 Ladies carry overalls, shopping bags  
 and loads of messages.
