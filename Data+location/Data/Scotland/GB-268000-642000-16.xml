		<content> There has been a settlement on the    
 site of Strathaven since the early    
 medieval period and probably earlier  
 for Roman,Celtic and Stone Age remains
 have been found in the area.By 1450   
 the town had become a Burgh in Barony 
 and weaving had been introduced by    
 Flemish settlers,hence Flemington.    
 Strathaven was a strong Covenanting   
 area and their is now a{Covenanting   
{Trail}to follow.In the 18th and 19th  
 centuries handloom weaving was the    
 principal occupation of the town.The  
{Sun Inn,}now Gershwins was a coaching 
 inn built in 1809 and the previous inn
 on the same site probably did the same
 job.Just outside the town is Lauder   
 Ha' the home of Sir Harry Lauder.In   
 common with many small towns          
 Strathaven finally lost it's railway  
 in 1965.The castle is the most obvious
 reminder of the past but others exist.</content>
