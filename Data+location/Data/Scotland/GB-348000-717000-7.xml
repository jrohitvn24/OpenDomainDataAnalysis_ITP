		<content> A branch line from Leuchars to        
 St.Andrews was opened on July 1st     
 1852.It was run by the Edinburgh,Perth
 and Dundee Railway Company.The station
 was on flat land beside the links.In  
 1887 St.Andrews was connected with the
 existing East of Fife Railway and a   
 new station was built nearer the town 
 in a cutting.The old (Links) station  
 became the Goods station. The line was
 always single track and a condition of
 the sale of the land across the       
 Strathtyrum Estate was that no trains 
 should run on Sundays.                
 The last train on the East of Fife    
 line left St.Andrews on 6th.September 
 1964.  The St.Andrews to Leuchars line
 closed on 4th.January 1969.  The Goods
 station was demolished to make room   
 for the Old Course Hotel. Only the    
 station master's house survives and is
 now the Jigger Inn.                   </content>
