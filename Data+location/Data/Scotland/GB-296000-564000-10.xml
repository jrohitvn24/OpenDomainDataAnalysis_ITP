		<title>10NEW ABBEY - INDUSTRY (1)</title>
		<content>   There has been a sawmill in New     
 Abbey for many years. Today it employs
 47 people,either harvesting the trees,
 working in the sawmill itself, or     
 transporting the sawn products.       
   In factories most goods are loaded  
 on transport by fork-lift trucks which
 use wooden pallets, each of which may 
 carry up to 2 tonnes in weight. This  
 sawmill makes over 100000 pallets each
 year in about 150 different sizes.    
   All sizes and kinds of trees are    
 used at the mill, from the thinnings  
 of young plantations to mature giants.
 For agricultural purposes most timber 
 must be treated with a preservative. A
 modern pressure impregnation plant is 
 in constant use. Celcurised timber is 
 used extensively in fencing and in    
 farm buildings.About 15000 tonnes of  
 timber,grown mostly within a 30 mile  
 radius,is used annually at the mill.  </content>
