		<title>04Interview : Airport Firemen</title>
		<content> Baltasound airport owns three fire    
 engines, and employs eight firemen who
 work eight hours a day.The fire       
 engines carry foam concentrate which  
 when mixed with water makes a         
 substance like Fairy Liquid which     
 freezes the fire. The Carmichael      
 carries 600 gallons of water and 60   
 gallons of foam concentrate. It pumps 
 out 400 gallons a minute.The smaller  
 engine carries 300 gallons of water   
 but has the water and foam already    
 mixed. The oldest engine carries 500  
 gallons of water and 25 gallons of    
 foam concentrate.It pumps out 300     
 gallons a minute.The firemen do lots  
 of other things too,they load and     
 unload aircraft and clear the runway  
 of sheep and snow.They have 6 weeks   
 training at the start,3 in Unst,3 down
 south,then take an exam,and if they   
 pass they can work at the airport.    </content>
