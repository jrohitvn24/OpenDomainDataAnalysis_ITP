		<title>20EVENTS:  THANKS TO DOUNE</title>
		<content> Although Doune is, in the words of its
 inhabitants,{QUIET AND PEACEFUL,}it   
 has had its moments of excitement;    
 when B.B.C.film crews and stars came  
 to film at the castle for a "Monty    
 Python" programme and episode of "The 
 Borgias" - Doune Motor Museum and     
 Ponds Nature Reserve were opened -    
  Doune Castle Football Team played at 
 Hampden Park in Glasgow and,"la piece 
 de resistance", a swan and her cygnets
 were given a police motor escort for  
 their procession along the Main       
 Street!                               
{                                      
{OUR THANKS GO TO ALL THE MANY PEOPLE  
{WHO ALLOWED US TO CROSS THEIR LAND, TO
{INTERVIEW THEM ON THE STREET OR IN    
{THEIR HOUSES, WHO TOLERATED OUR       
{GENERAL INQUISITIVENESS, OR WHO CAME  
{TO US TO SHARE THEIR LOCAL KNOWLEDGE.
