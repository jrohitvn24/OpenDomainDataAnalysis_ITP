		<title>03A PAISLEY FAMILY AT HOME</title>
		<content> My name is Cheryl  Buchanan aged 11   
 years and I live at 29 Dalmary  Drive 
 with my Mum, Dad and brother Murray.  
 Our house is a three bedroomed        
 semi-detached villa and we own a red  
 Escort car. My Dad works as a welding 
 engineer and my Mum works as an       
 assistant in Barshaw Playgroup.       
                                       
 As a family we have times together and
 we also have different interests.     
 Yesterday was a typical Saturday in   
 our lives. We love weekends! It       
 started with Mum rising first and     
 going to the shop to get something for
 Murray's packed lunch as he is off to 
 Largs for the day with the B.B. I rose
 later and switched on the T.V. to see 
 my favourite show The Saturday Picture
 Show.  Later it's  off to the Art     
 Class at the Museum and Mum and Dad go
 shopping for a vacuum cleaner.        </content>
