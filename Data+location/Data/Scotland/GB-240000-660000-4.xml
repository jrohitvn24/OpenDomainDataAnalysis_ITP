		<title>04Life Style in Johnstone</title>
		<content> Adults and teenagers both tend to lean
 towards a more conventional dress in  
 Johnstone - and don't often use       
 clothes to express themselves.If they 
 want to be seen in more outrageous    
 dress they tend to travel to Glasgow. 
 The town however does have a minority 
 of Mod and Punk fashion.              
 Music in Johnstone is split into three
 main categories - namely: "Pop Music"-
 popular sounds mostly found in the    
 charts.This type of music appeals to  
 the majority of people in Johnstone;  
 "Mod Music"-this has its roots in     
 Soul music of the 1960's, although it 
 has changed slightly since then;      
 "Punk Music"-based on simplistic      
 guitar chords and raucous vocals.     
 There are four hotels in this area.   
 They all have public restaurants and  
 licensed bars.They offer well priced  
 meals for the local community.        </content>
