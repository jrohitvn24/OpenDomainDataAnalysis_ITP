		<content> The present Laird of the Garden estate
 is Colonel James Stirling and the     
 estate has belonged to his family for 
 400 years.   Garden extends to        
 approximately 4000 acres and includes 
 6 tenanted farms as well as 450 acres 
 of centrally managed mixed forestry.  
 There are presently 18 occupied       
 cottages on the estate, but now only 3
 full-time estate workers - 2 foresters
 and a gamekeeper. The responsibilities
 retained by the estate include        
 woodlands, hedges, some fences,       
 cottage maintenance, some farm        
 buildings and drainage on some parts  
 of the estate. (Details of the estate 
 farms on subsequent pages.) Col       
 Stirling is Lord Lieutenant and       
 Chairman of the Highland Territorial  
 Volunteer Reserve Association.
