		<title>02RUCHAZIE COMMUNITY PROJECT</title>
		<content>   This three year{Urban Aid}funded    
 project was set up in 1984.  It is    
 innovatory in Glasgow in that a Social
 Worker is based in a primary school to
 work in close co-operation with a     
 teacher.  Both form a link to         
 facilitate interaction between two    
 agencies,{Social Work}and{Education.  
 This is for the benefit of the        
 children attending  Ruchazie Primary  
 in particular and the community in    
 general. The community teacher's role 
 is primarily a supportive one, helping
 class teachers with pupils who have   
 social problems by home visiting, team
 teaching etc. and from this setting up
 a programme of help.  The Social      
 Worker's normal role is aided by his  
 presence in the school in that it     
 becomes a supportive and confidence   
 building device. Administrative backup
 is provided by the clerical assistant.</content>
