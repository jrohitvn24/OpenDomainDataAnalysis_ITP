		<content> IN THE 1984/85 SESSION A NEW DAY WAS  
 INTRODUCED.INSTEAD OF THE DAY BEING   
 SPLIT UP INTO 8,40 MINUTE PERIODS IT  
 IS NOW SPLIT UP INTO 5,HOUR PERIODS.IN
 A SURVEY TAKEN AT THE END OF THE      
 SCHOOL SESSION IT WAS FOUND THAT MOST 
 OF THE PUPILS LIKED THE 5 PERIOD DAY. 
 THE MAIN REASON BEING THAT IT MAKES   
 THE DAY SEEM SHORTER EVEN THOUGH IT   
 STILL RUNS FROM 9AM TO 3.55PM.        
 VANDALISM IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY 
 LARGE PROBLEM IN LARKHALL ACADEMY WITH
 GLASS WINDOWS AND EXTERIOR PANELS     
 BEING BROKEN.
