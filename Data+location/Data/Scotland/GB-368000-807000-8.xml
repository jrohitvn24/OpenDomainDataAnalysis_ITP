		<title>08BUILDINGS IN MIDMAR</title>
		<content> The old buildings used to be made of  
 granite but now they are made with    
 cement blocks.The old school beside my
 house is made with granite.It was     
 built in 1896.There was another school
 beside the present one but it was     
 knocked down when the present one was 
 built.The old school beside my house  
 was not needed any more so it became a
 garage.There are eight council houses 
 in Midmar, two semi-detatched houses  
 and four town houses.All the houses   
 got in double glazing except numbers  
 one and two because the houses were   
 privately owned.Bethlin Farm is owned 
 by Mr. Wharton of Midmar Castle who   
 rents out the farm.There have been    
 seven new houses built in Glenwood    
 Park.They are very big and have large 
 gardens.Some steadings have been      
 converted into houses.
