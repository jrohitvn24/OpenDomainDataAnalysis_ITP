		<content> At national level this area is        
 included in the Angus East            
 constituency which is at present      
 represented in Parliament by Mr. Peter
 Fraser.  As well as being a           
 conservative M.P., Mr. Fraser is      
 Solicitor General for Scotland.  At   
 local level the area is represented on
 Tayside Regional Council by The Hon.  
 Mrs. Jane Hendry, and on Dundee       
 District Council by Mr. Alan Grewar.  
 Though the Community Council has no   
 powers of government, it plays an     
 important role in conveying the needs 
 and opinions of local people to the   
 Regional and District Councillors. A  
 survey conducted by the pupils showed 
 that many people wished the Community 
 Council to have more power.
