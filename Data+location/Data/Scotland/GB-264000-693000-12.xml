		<content>{THE OLD GRAVEYARD                     
 There is an old graveyard at Kippen   
 Cross with graves dating back to the  
 15th century.One grave of particular  
 interest belongs to James Ure of      
 Shirgarton,a well known Covenanter.   
                                       
{THE OLD VINE                          
 Up at the top of the village is a     
 housing estate called The Old Vinery  
 which is built on the site of the     
 largest vine under glass in Europe.The
 roots were said to stretch as far     
 as the River Forth about two miles    
 away.It belonged to the Buchanan      
 family and was cut down in 1964.      
 Off-shoots were sold and are still    
 growing in and around Kippen and      
 all over the world.
