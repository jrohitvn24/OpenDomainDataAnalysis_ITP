		<title>18Day of a School Dinner Lady</title>
		<content>  Mrs X awakens at{6-30}and has a cup  
 of tea. She leaves for the school at  
{7-50}where her daily job is to prepare
 the potatoes or chips which are peeled
 and put through a machine. Other jobs 
 include the preparation of the other  
 vegetables, making the custard and in 
 general keeping the kitchens clean and
 tidy. At{11-30}she sets the tables for
 the children and at{12-05}she helps to
 serve the dinners. She is then allowed
 a half hour break for lunch before she
 helps with the process of cleaning up.
  Mrs X leaves for home at{2-45}where  
 she attends to the housework and makes
 the tea for her husband and two of her
 children who are still at home. In the
 evening her hobbies include badminton,
 swimming and walking. Her busiest day,
 however, is a Sunday when all of her  
 family of 6 plus her 7 grandchildren  
 come to her house for tea.            </content>
