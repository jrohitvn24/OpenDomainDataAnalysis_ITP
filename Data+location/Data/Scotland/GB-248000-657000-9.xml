		<content>  St. John's Church is the only{Roman  
{Catholic}church in Barrhead.  This    
 church is relatively modern, being    
 just over twenty years old. The church
 is open daily and Mass is celebrated  
 several times on Sunday.              
  There are five{non-Catholic }churches
 in Barrhead.  The South, Bourock and  
 Arthurlie  are Church of Scotland and 
 there is also the Evangelic Union and 
 the Methodist Church.  Services in    
 these churches are on a Sunday        
 morning, usually at 11 a.m.           
  There are two{Gospel Halls}in        
 Barrhead  which are open for Sunday   
 services and also for evening         
 meetings.  The Salvation Army is at   
 present building a new citadel which  
 is due to be opened later in 1985.
