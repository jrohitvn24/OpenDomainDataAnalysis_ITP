		<content> Newtown St.Boswells is in a central   
 position in the Borders Region, and   
 when regionalisation took place in    
 1974 it was decided to use the office 
 accomodation in the village for the   
 Borders Regional                      
 Headquarters.Previously the offices   
 had been the Headquarters of          
 Roxburghshire County Council.         
     The Borders Region are the only   
 region in Scotland who have regional  
 offices situated in a village rather  
 than in a large town or city.         
     Pressure of space is a major      
 problem in the offices and they are   
 constantly looking for extra areas to 
 expand their office space.Part of the 
 school garden was lost when temporary 
 accomodation for the Architects'      
 Department was constructed in the     
 space.
