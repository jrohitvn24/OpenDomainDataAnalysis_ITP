 the{North East}of Scotland,roughly 3  
 to 4 miles{South East}of the town of  
 Fraserburgh.Most people live in the   
 village of{St Combs}which has a       
 population of over{800}people.        
                                       
{Commercial fishing is no longer       
{an important part of village life but 
{still has its place in the traditions 
{and customs of the area. About 25     
{people are full time fishermen.Some   
{people still have small vessels for   
{lobsters and salmon.

 area feeding various places between
