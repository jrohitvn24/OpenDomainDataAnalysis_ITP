		<content>  The main village ,Denholm, lies in   
 the valley of the Teviot with the     
 smaller village of Minto to the north 
 at the foot of Minto Hill.The land    
 around Minto Hill is rough and is used
 for grazing.The rest of the land which
 is flat and good farmland used for    
 growing cereal crops and pasture for  
 grazing.There is also a small dairy   
 farm.Most trees are found growing     
 around Minto hill.Beside Minto is a   
 golf course which is open to the      
 public.On top of Minto Craggs we have 
 Fatlips Castle which is a small       
 keep.The farms provide most of our    
 jobs outside our village.There is a   
 sawmill just about to be built outside
 Denholm which will provide more jobs.
