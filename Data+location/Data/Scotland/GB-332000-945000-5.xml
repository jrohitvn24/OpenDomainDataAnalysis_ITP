		<title>05The Village Shop and P.O.</title>
		<content> The present shop and Post Office have 
 operated from one building since 1959.
 The shop sells such a variety of goods
 that it is really a mini-supermarket  
 but with the personal touch i.e. the  
 owner will deliver goods to your      
 house.                                
 Daily newspapers are sold and weekly/ 
 monthly magazines are available to    
 order.Fresh baking is brought out     
 daily from Wick.The shop is open every
 day except Sunday with a half day     
 closing on Saturday.On Thursday it    
 stays open until 21.30hrs.The Post    
 Office has the same hours as the shop 
 except for Thursday when it closes at 
 17.30hrs. The Post Office offers all  
 the facilities of a Sub Post Office   
 and has its own safety bandit screen. 
 The shop and P.O. employ three people 
 two full time and one part time. The  
 shop serves a wide area.              </content>
