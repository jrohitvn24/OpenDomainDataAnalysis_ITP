 the River South Esk.There is a modern 
 primary school on a hill near the     
 village and one grocers shop which is 
 also a post office.There is a church,a
 manse,a village hall,a telephone box,a
 small park and a few houses.Many of   
 the people who live in the village are
 elderly.There is hardly any work in   
 the village so people who live there  
 go to work in the nearby towns such as
 Forfar,Kirriemuir and Brechin.

 cobbler,a baker,a shoemaker and and a 
 tailor.A policeman lived in a house   
 along from the school.The house had a 
 detention centre.There used to be an  
 inn in Manse Lane.A small carpark     
 opposite the village shop was the site
 of the village cobbler's              
 house.Although the beedle's house     
 remains intact,there is now no tennant</content>
