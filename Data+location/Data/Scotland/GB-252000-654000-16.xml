		<content>      In this area, where education is 
 highly valued by the residents, the   
 local comprehensive schools have high 
 standards, active and enthusiastic    
 staff and are usually closely watched 
 by parents. There are very active     
 parent-teacher associations, and many 
 extra-curricular activities.          
      The parents are able to help the 
 schools to buy extra educational      
 equipment of a major nature, for      
 example minibuses, scientific         
 apparatus, sports equipment etc.      
       Pupils leaving secondary schools
 in this area will have an             
 above-average  number of pases at 'O' 
 grade and 'H' grade and do not have as
 much difficulty in obtaining training 
 or jobs as those in some other areas.
