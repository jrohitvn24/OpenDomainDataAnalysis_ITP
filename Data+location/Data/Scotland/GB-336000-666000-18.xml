		<title>18COUSLAND - KATEWELL QUARRY</title>
		<content> LIMESTONE QUARRYING AND MINING HAS    
 TAKEN PLACE IN THE COUSLAND AREA SINCE
 1927.  AFTER 1970, NO QUARRYING TOOK  
 PLACE, UNTIL 1974-77.                 
 RECENTLY THE RESIDENTS OF THE AREA    
 HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING AGAINST THE     
 PROPOSALS TO START QUARRYING AGAIN,   
 AND ARE AWAITING THE OUTCOME OF A     
 PUBLIC INQUIRY TO BE HELD IN SEPTEMBER
 1985.                                 
 THE LOCAL COUNCIL'S PLANNING COMMITTEE
 AND THE LOCAL RESIDENTS' ASSOCIATION  
 ARE OPPOSED TO FURTHER QUARRYING      
 BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER SUITABLE      
 SOURCES OF THIS MATERIAL WHICH WOULD  
 WASTE GOOD AGRICULTURAL LAND, THE     
 LANDSCAPE WOULD BE UNPLEASANTLY       
 ALTERED, THE RURAL ROADS WOULD BE     
 OVERUSED AND THE NOISE AND DUST WOULD 
 SPOIL THE AMENITY OF THE VILLAGE.
