		<title>01Clashnessie Bay Area</title>
		<content> The main geographical feature of the  
 area is Clashnessie Bay, which faces  
 northwards and into which flows a     
 river outflow via a waterfall from    
 inland lochs, which abound to the     
 south and east.The land is used as    
 rough grazing for sheep and there are 
 several small farm houses mainly in   
 the area to the west of the bay, which
 are still occupied, other crofts lie  
 in ruins in this same area. However   
 several new wooden holiday chalets    
 have been built and sandy beach       
 attracts some tourists in the summer. 
 The main road serving the area runs   
 from south west to east and skirts the
 south east edge of the bay. The road  
 to Raffin and Culkein runs along the  
 western edge of this area and the post
 office at Achnacarnin serves the area 
 being itself serviced by the daily    
 post bus from Lochinver.              </content>
