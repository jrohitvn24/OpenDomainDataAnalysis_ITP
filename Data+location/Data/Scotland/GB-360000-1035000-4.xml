  The prospects for{population growth  
 look{pretty bleak}in these figures.40%
 are over retirement age,and there     
 isn't anybody under the age of 5.The  
 area has just{35 people}living in     
 it,and much of this must be due to the
 isolation of this area from the rest  
 of the island,though with cars this   
 need not apply today.                 
  People make a living by{farming,}even
 though there are just 10 males        
 suitable for this.                    
{ Many houses}are{empty}in this        
 area,and with the influx to the island
 of people trying to escape from the   
 "rat race" in the towns we could yet  
 see a population increase.At this     
 moment,however,the community remains  
 very small.
