		<title>15MY DAY</title>
		<content> Yesterday I got up at 8.30am to go to 
 school.  I got my clothes on and had a
 plate of cornflakes.  I then set off  
 for school.  In school we did sums and
 went for our interval at 10.20am.     
 When we got out we played at football.
 At 10.35am we did English.  At 12.05pm
 we went to the toilet and to get our  
 coats.  At 12.15pm we went for dinner.
 I went home and played with my little 
 brother Stuart.  I went back to school
 straight after my dinner to finish off
 our game of football.  We went back in
 at 1.15pm and we did some graphs.  At 
 2.10pm we had another interval and    
 after that we went to the library.  We
 left school at 3.30pm and I got my    
 dinner at 4pm.  After that I got ready
 to play football.  We were playing at 
 Bellshill in the quarter-final of a   
 Cup. Sadly we were beaten 3-2.  I went
 straight to my bed when I got home.   </content>
