		<content>     LAW AND ORDER IN HILTON           
  On Friday afternoon David and I made 
  an appointment to goto Tain police   
 station and interview Sergeant Revie, 
 and ask him a few questions about what
 happens in Hilton,and what he has to  
 do.                                   
    Hilton of Cadboll is a quiet       
 village with hardly any trouble,but   
 there is the odd whisper of vandalism,
 breakins and people that go around in 
 cars asking to take you home.To make  
 sure these things don't happen two    
 policemen go round the three villages.
 The two policemen split into shifts   
 one on day-shift and the other is on  
 back-shift,they go around 24 hours    
 a-day,7 days a week.A couple of       
 policemen also come to our school     
 telling us not to go in cars with     
 strangers.                            
                                       </content>
