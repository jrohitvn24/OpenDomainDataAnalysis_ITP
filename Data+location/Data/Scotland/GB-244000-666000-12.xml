		<title>12INCHINNAN HOUSING ESTATE</title>
		<content> When India Tyres closed about 4 years 
 ago,the people who live in the small  
 estate next to the factory lost more  
 than just their jobs-their way of life
 changed.The bus company,for example,  
 changed their timetable and now there 
 is only one bus an hour and the last  
 bus is at 5.30pm!                     
    The estate,built 50 years ago,is   
 situated just off a busy main road and
 is about two miles from Inchinnan and 
 three miles from Renfrew.It is very   
 isolated with no amenities-no Post    
 Office or shops and the nearest doctor
 is three miles away.                  
    The 108 residents-most of whom own 
 their own homes-started a Tenants'    
 Association,to try and get amenities  
 in the area eg.a playground for the   
 children.So far they have not been    
 successful.                           
                                       </content>
