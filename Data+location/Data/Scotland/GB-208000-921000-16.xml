		<title>16ASSYNT'S LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> Local History gives us the reasons for
 why so many things are as they are    
 today. 900 years ago the land around  
 her was owned by the Thane of         
 Sutherland. The MacNicols of Ullapool 
 helped fight plundering Vikings &amp; were
 given the land of Assynt as a reward. 
 Around 1500 the MacNicols married into
 the MacLeods of Lewis, thus began the 
 Macleods of Assynt. Sir Joseph Bacon  
 built a pier in 1745 &amp; 50 fishing     
 boats came. In 1800 people suffering  
 from the Highland Clearances fled here
 &amp; increased the population. In 1870   
 the Duke of Sutherland built a large  
 lodge here. In 1936 the Vesty family  
 bought the Estates of Assynt &amp; are    
 owned by them to this day. In 1948 the
 fishing Industry began in ernest. As a
 result Lochinver is a busy Fishing &amp;  
 Holiday village today, very           
 dependendent on these for existance.  </content>
