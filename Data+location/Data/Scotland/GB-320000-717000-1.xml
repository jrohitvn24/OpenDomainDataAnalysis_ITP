		<content>   The town of{Newburgh}lies in the    
 North-East Fife District of{Fife      
{Region.}It is situated on the south   
 bank of the{River Tay,}about mid-way  
 between{Dundee}and{Perth.             
   The town stretches for about one    
 mile along the river bank between the 
 river and the{Ochil Hills}to the      
 south. The main road from Cupar to    
 Perth forms Newburgh's High Street,   
 with minor roads going off on both    
 sides.                                
   The highest point on the hills      
 behind the town is called{Black Cairn 
{(236m).}The stone from these hills has
 been quarried for centuries, and one  
 quarry is still operational.          
   A single -track railway line passes 
 through the town. There was a station 
 at one time but it is now closed. The 
 trains which pass through run from    
 Edinburgh to Perth and Inverness.     </content>
