		<title>19CUSTOMS..TRADITIONS</title>
		<content> It was common in Kelty, 50 or 60 years
 ago to give people nicknames.  This   
 custom arose because there were family
 names in profusion.  Other people were
 given a nickname, because they were   
 considered "characters" of a kind.    
 Such nicknames were "Jimmy Peely",    
 "Jock the Sweep", "Laughing Davie" and
 "Bookie Jock".  The meanings of some  
 nicknames was obvious, others had a   
 tale to them.  Most characters were   
 held in affection, one way or another,
 in the village.  This tradition is    
 apparently dying out now.
