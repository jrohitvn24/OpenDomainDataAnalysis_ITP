		<title>05Uyeasound Lighthouse.</title>
		<content> The lighthouse is found on the        
 Westside of Uyeasound. It is an       
 automatic light which is attended by a
 part-time keeper who makes sure the   
 light works properly. He sends a      
 questionaire to the Northern          
 Lighthouse Board in Edinburgh each    
 month saying how much gas has been    
 used,how much is left and the state of
 spares. The lighthouse uses acetylene 
 gas to produce its beam which is      
 visible for seven miles. The light    
 flashes twice every 7 seconds.There is
 half second light,1 second dark,half  
 second light,5 seconds dark.          
   The Pole Star is the supply ship for
 lighthouses in Scotland. It calls     
 every year bringing gas and other     
 supplies. These are brought ashore by 
 helicopter. In 1985 it will call on   
 June 19th.
