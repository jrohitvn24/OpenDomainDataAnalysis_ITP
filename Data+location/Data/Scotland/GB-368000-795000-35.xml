At break time everyone plays one-man-build-up and what you have to do is pick who's it and you have two dells  and run from one to the other without getting caught and if you get caught you have to be it and the first player tagged is it for a new game once the other game has finished. We also play tag and what you do is try and tag each other by touching them on the shoulder and running away and without getting caught again.Most people play football on the field what you do is you have a ball and try kick the ball in to the oppisite goal without getting tackeled you can also pass the ball to your own players for a advantige.   &lt;br />
