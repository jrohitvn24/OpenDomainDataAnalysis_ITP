  There are two contrasting life       
 styles in the block; those residents  
 from traditionally Aberdeenshire      
 families engaged in agriculture in    
 and around the block; and those who   
 have entered the area since the early 
 1970's due to the advent of oil, who  
 have purchased homes in the area but  
 who commute to Aberdeen to work.      
  Compared with the taciturn 'natives',
 the 'newcomers' have tended to seem   
 vocal, articulate and confident, which
 has led to some polite estrangement   
 between the two groups.               
  However, such 'newcomers' have taken 
 a keen interest in local affairs and  
 have in many cases contributed greatly
 to organisations such as the local    
 school Parent- Teacher Association.
