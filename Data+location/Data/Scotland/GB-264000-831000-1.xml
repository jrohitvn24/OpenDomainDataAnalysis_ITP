		<content>  About three quarters of our area is  
 covered by loch or rugged hillside.It 
 is popular with tourists and with     
 those who live in Inverness who like  
 to get out into the country to        
 fish,climb rocks or walk on the hills.
  Eighteen houses are lived in by fifty
 one people.Ten of them are children.  
 the nearest primary school is at Farr 
 and secondary school in Inverness.    
  There are thirteen retired people,   
 five who work on the area's farms and 
 thirteen who work in Inverness.       
  The minister of the Church of        
 Scotland at Dunlichity lives seven    
 miles away at Daviot.                 
  The churchyard holds many of the     
 people who lived in the area since    
 1763.Only two of these families       
 remain.In fact ten of the families    
 have lived here for less than ten     
 years.                                </content>
