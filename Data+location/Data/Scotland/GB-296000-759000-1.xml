		<title>01Moulin Moor Nr Pitlochry</title>
		<content> This area of heather moorland lies on 
 the northwest and southeast sides of  
 the A924 road from Pitlochry to       
 Kirkmichael &amp; it is used for sheep    
 grazing and grouse shooting.   At     
 Knock Barrie (or the Fairies Knoll)   
 there is a plantation of conifers,    
 mainly spruce and larch.   The only   
 houses are a cottage near there (gate 
 house) and an empty shepherd's house. 
 Near the latter there is a stone by   
 the road to the memory of a man who   
 perished in a snowstorm while         
 returning from Moulin Market in March 
 1897.   There are a number of old hut 
 circles in the area.   At present     
 lorry loads of peat are being taken   
 from a bog to stabilise embankments of
 the new A9 road at Killiecrankie.     
 From the A924 there is a superb view  
 for miles to the west.
