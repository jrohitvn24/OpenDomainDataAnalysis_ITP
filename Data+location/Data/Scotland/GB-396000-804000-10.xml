		<title>10STAND-BY BOATS</title>
		<content> The majority of stand -by boats are   
 former trawlers and crew.No longer    
 employed in fishing due to the decline
 of the industry they have shifted into
 the oil industry.The job is certainly 
 not glamorous nor does it attract the 
 large wages usually synonomous with   
 offshore work.One explanation being   
 the national abundance of unemployed  
 fisherman.This means that the         
 companies can offer relatively low    
 wages knowing that if the Aberdeen    
 fishermen don't accept they can employ
 fishermen from Hull or Grimsby        
 instead.The skipper and nine of a crew
 are away for 31 days followed by only 
 4-7 days onshore.While at sea they    
 hover on 'stand-by' near the rig in   
 case of emergencies such as a 'man    
 overboard'.To relieve the boredom     
 these former trawlermen often go off  
 line fishing in a wee rescue dingy.   </content>
