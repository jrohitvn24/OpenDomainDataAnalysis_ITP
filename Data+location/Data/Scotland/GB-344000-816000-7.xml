		<content>                                       
 The castle which is now in ruins had a
 very violent history.Built in the 13th
 century it was one of the strongholds 
 of Robert the Bruce and was often     
 under siege by the English forces.    
 Later it became the seat of the Earls 
 of Mar.   It passed through many hands
 and in the 17th century was the scene 
 of further battles, this time between 
 the Royalists and Roundheads, when it 
 was captured by Cromwells troops in   
 1654.   Later again it was held for   
 the old Pretender, James 111.   when  
 the 1715 rising failed, the castle was
 dismantled and became " the quarry for
 the district".   In 1951 it was given 
 to the Dept. of Environment for       
 preservation.   Altough only a ruin,it
                                       
 is a great tourist attraction, drawing
 7,ooo vistors a year to the area.     </content>
