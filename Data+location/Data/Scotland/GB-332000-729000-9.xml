		<content> A Third World crop,{CASSAVA,}is under 
 investigation by the Virology         
 Department funded by the Overseas     
 Development Administration.           
  The most expensive items in the      
 laboratories are electron microscopes 
 of which they have three,the newest   
 costing Â£110,000.                     
  The institute has 30 micro-computers 
 and access to the Edinburgh Regional  
 Computer Centre by telephone.         
  Relationships with other countries   
 are good as politics do not come into 
 scientific work and scientists can go 
 from country to country with very     
 little difficulty.For instance in 1985
 a Doctor of Science from U.S.S.R. is  
 coming to Mylnefield.                 
  Children are employed as             
 berry-pickers during their summer     
 holidays from school.
