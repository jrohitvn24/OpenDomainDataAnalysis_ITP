   From 1939-1956 the only dual        
 carriageway was from the Post Office  
 down to Dalmakether road end. In 1956 
 this was extended to the south past   
 Dinwoodie. In the early 1960s the     
 whole length of the road was made into
 a dual carriageway. In 1982 the roads 
 and bridge were widened .An access    
 road to the houses in the village was 
 made up at the back of the village and
 a fence erected up the front at the   
 side of the carriageway. A few weeks  
 ago a crash barrier was erected up the
 middle of the road from the bridge to 
 the filing station. It will be        
 extended further soon.
