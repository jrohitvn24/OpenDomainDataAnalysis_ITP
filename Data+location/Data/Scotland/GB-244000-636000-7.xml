		<title>07HURLFORD/CROOKEDHOLM CHURCH.</title>
		<content> There are three churches in the area. 
 Two are Church of Scotland and one is 
 Roman Catholic. Two of the churches   
 are situated in Crookedholm and the   
 Roman Catholic Church, St. Pauls, in  
 Hurlford. A fourth large church in    
 Hurlford is no longer used for that   
 purpose. Hurlford Kirk with a         
 congregation of 678 is in the charge  
 of the Rev.J.Brodie. and Reid Memorial
 Church with a congregation of 590 is  
 in the charge of a lady minister, the 
 Rev.E.Houston. All three churches were
 built in the second half of the 19th. 
 Century. Crookedholm was the centre of
 religious life during the 18th.C.,    
 people travelling from as far as Ayr  
 and Saltcoats for Sunday worship.     
 There is a story of a young mother who
 carried her baby from Beith to        
 Crookedholm for baptism in 1777 and   
 returned home the same day.           </content>
