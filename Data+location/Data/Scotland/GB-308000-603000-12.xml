		<content>    Mrs Boyd a resident of Moffat for  
 more than fifty years,considers it a  
 privilege to be able to live in Moffat
 because of its scenic beauty,         
 historical interest,and friendly,     
 caring community.                     
   She regrets the loss of the railway 
 from Moffat and Beattock because it   
 meant the loss of jobs and caused     
 inconvenience to travellers,who now   
 have to travel to Lockerbie which is a
 pick-up point for journeys,north or   
 south. She notices the increasing     
 volume of road traffic but realises it
 is necessary to bring tourists to the 
 town. She remembers the time when     
 Moffat had a very wide High Street    
 which  was the envy of other towns.   
 Unfortunately it has been split in two
 and in the middle a car parking area  
 built.This leads to congestion but    
 allows people to park near the shops. </content>
