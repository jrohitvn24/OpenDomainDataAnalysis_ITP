		<title>01A Guide to Dumfries</title>
		<content> Our area of{Dumfries}is separated by  
 the river Nith. On the East side lies 
{Whitesands,}and the built up area of  
 Victorian houses surrounding the town 
 centre.{Georgetown}and{Lochvale}are   
 the two newest suburbs of Dumfries.   
 Also on the east side is the Dock     
 Park, and south from that, is the     
 small village of{Kingolm Quay}where   
 ships coming up the Nith used to dock.
 On the west side are the housing      
 estates of{Troqueer}and{Maxwelltown.  
 They both centre around Corbelly Hill,
 the museum with its camera obscura.   
 Troqueer school and playing fields    
 take up a large area. The land around 
 Dumfries is generally wide, open      
 fields and the only roads to Dumfries 
 are main roads. There are some small  
 farms and cottages.
