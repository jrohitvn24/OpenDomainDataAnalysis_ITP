		<content> Celtic Park, with a reduced capacity  
 of 67,000 since 1978 when it was      
 75,000, is situated west of Janefield 
 Street, and east of London Road.Every 
 week, thousands of fans flock to      
 football games there, averaging out at
 around 22,000, to watch a team drawn  
 from 31 full time professionals, 4    
 part-time professionals and 18        
 schoolboy signings.Ground improvements
 are now taking place.Namely, toilet   
 improvements, new turnstiles and      
 exits.A major improvement is the      
 introduction of under-soil heating and
 a proposed covering of the west end   
 terracing.                            
    In May 1985 Celtic won the 100th   
 Scottish Cup final, at Hampden Park,  
 beating Dundee Utd 2-1.The biggest    
 attendance of this season was 49,000  
 in a European tie against Rapid Vienna
 of Austria.                           </content>
