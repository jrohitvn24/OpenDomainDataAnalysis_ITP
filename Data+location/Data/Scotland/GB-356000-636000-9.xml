		<content>{  Civic Week}is held annually at the  
 beginning of July.                    
   A civic week committee, made up of  
 local people, thought that Earlston   
 needed to have some kind of festival  
 week because all the other villages   
 and towns had one.                    
   Civic Week is made up of family     
 entertainment which includes, fancy   
 dress, talent competitions,concerts,  
 dances, discos, various sports and    
 over 60's evenings.                   
                                       
  {Rugby Sevens}are held annually in   
 September when seven-a-side teams from
 all over the Borders area come to play
 in the competition. The winners are   
 presented with a silver cup.
