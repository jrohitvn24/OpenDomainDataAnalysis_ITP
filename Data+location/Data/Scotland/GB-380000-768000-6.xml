		<title>06Gourdon Harbour</title>
		<content>{Gourdon harbour}is well situated      
 nestling at the foot of cliffs. The   
 harbour is a very busy part of the    
 village both as a tourist attraction  
 and as a place of work. You can climb 
 Gourdon Hill and get a good view of   
 the village and the harbour. Although 
 the harbour is not very big there are 
 quite a lot of boats to be seen. There
 is also a little harbour where the    
 little boats moor. In the big harbour 
 you can see boats landing their catch.
 Usually once a year there is a gala at
 the harbour where people can come and 
 go out on a trip in the boats. In the 
 summer a lot of pleasure craft come   
 into the harbour.
