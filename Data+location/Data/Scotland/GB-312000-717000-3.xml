		<title>03FARMING AROUND BRIDGE EARN</title>
		<content>                                       
 Most of the farms around Bridge of    
 Earn were once owned by lairds living 
 on large estates.Mr Johnson,who owns  
 Hilton Farm was once a tenant of the  
 Moncreiffe estate.                    
  In the old days when the farm was    
 owned by the laird the farmer could   
 grow as much produce as he wished,but 
 today the government will only allow a
 certain amount to be grown each       
 year.Mr Johnson is allowed to grow    
 about 20 acres of potatoes a year and 
 he would be heavily fined if he       
 exceeded this limit.Also,the potatoes 
 can only be grown in the same field   
 every five years.When the potatoes are
 ready Mr Johnston hires a potato      
 merchant to come and harvest them.The 
 merchant brings his own labour force  
 and takes the potatoes away to be     
 sold.                                 </content>
