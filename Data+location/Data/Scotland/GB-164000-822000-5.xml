		<title>05BROADFORD CO-OP</title>
		<content>{The Broadford Co-op}employs six full  
 time staff and two part-timers.The    
 Co-op house (now a cafe) was built in 
 1942 and the main building was built  
 in 1962.A new extension to the Co-op  
 was built this year.I asked the       
 manager why they needed an extension  
 and he replied,"To bring the shop up  
 to date and give us more room to work 
 in."The hours the Co-op works are half
 past eight a.m. till half past five   
 p.m. every day of the week except     
 Wednesday when they work 9 a.m. till 1
 p.m.The items they sell most are      
 bread,milk and frozen foods.The least 
 sold item is hardware.The manager is  
 Bill Wood.The Co-op is by far the     
 busiest grocery outlet in the         
 Broadford area.
