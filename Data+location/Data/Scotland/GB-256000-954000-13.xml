		<title>13Births Marriages and Deaths</title>
		<content> The {Registrar }of Births Marriages   
 and Deaths gave us the numbers for    
 these for the last ten years and one  
 or two things were quite noticeable.  
 Apart from a bigger than usual number 
 of {marriages } in l977 the number    
 remained very stable. There followed a
 steep rise in the number of {births } 
 in 1979 since when it has dipped and  
 risen by small amounts from year to   
 year. In only one year was the number 
 of {deaths }less than the number of   
 births, in fact it was usually two    
 times or more the number of births.
