		<title>09Staxigoe Hall</title>
		<content> In 1985 Staxigoe Hall was extended and
 improved to improve the amenities for 
 the community. There are many         
 functions held in the hall such as    
 dances, discos, concerts, W.R.I.,     
 whist drive and committee meetings.   
 The improved and extended hall is     
 better than the old one as it now has 
 proper insulation better heating and  
 can be partitioned. We need a hall in 
 our village as it brings the community
 together.                             
 Our hall is long and narrow with a    
 lovely new wooden floor and wood lined
 walls. There is a stage which is not  
 very high, and when it is stood on end
 it becomes a partition. There is also 
 a store room, kitchen, toilet         
 facilities and a committee room.      
 The committee is responsible for the  
 upkeep of the hall but anyone who has 
 been using it has to clean it.        </content>
