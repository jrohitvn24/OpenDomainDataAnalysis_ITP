		<title>19Johnstone Houses Sandyflats</title>
		<content> Sandyflats is a housing scheme north  
 of St Cuthberts school. It is very    
 small and poor. It was built in the   
 1930's and the houses aren't likely to
 last much longer. Many renovations    
 have taken place over the years, but  
 none seem to have stopped the growing 
 dampness problem.                     
 Most of the people in Sandyflats are  
 quite poor and the scheme is plagued  
 with unemployment.This is probably due
 to the lack of industry in the area.  
 The nearest factory is a Paper Mill   
 and Sandyflats used to rely heavily on
 that for jobs. Since the late 1970s   
 the mill has had to lay off many      
 people.                               
 Since a lot of people in Sandyflats   
 are poor and are in fact below the    
 poverty line it is necesary to bring  
 better housing and industry to the    
 area.                                 </content>
