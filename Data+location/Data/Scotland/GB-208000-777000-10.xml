		<title>10  Banavie Quarry: 1</title>
		<content>{Stone Produce}                        
      Our visit to Banavie Quarry began
 with a talk given by the Quarry       
 Manager, Mr MacLaren, on the dangers  
 to be met in and around the quarry.   
      Mr MacLaren told us that the     
 quarry, which employs 18 men, sells   
 stone chips and also tar.             
      First we went and saw the quarry 
 cliff where the rockface is drilled   
 and plastic explosive pushed into the 
 holes and fired to bring down the     
 rocks. The bigger rocks are then      
 broken down further by a large crane  
 with a swinging metal ball and all the
 stones are lifted by diggers onto     
 conveyor belts. The stones pass       
 through sorting machines and move to  
 tall crushing machines where the      
 sorted stones are broken down even    
 further and this process continues    
 until the chips are the size desired. </content>
