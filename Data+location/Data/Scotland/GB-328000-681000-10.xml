		<content> Access to the island is curbed by the 
 necessity of having written permission
 to land, this provision was introduced
 around 1890.                          
 Inchkeith was recently bought by Mr.T.
 Farmer, who has plans to turn it into 
 an adventure playground for children. 
 Despite the fact that officially      
 permission is required before landing 
 on the island nowadays many visitors  
 simply come and go at will, often     
 taking a Sunday afternoon trip out    
 there if they have a boat. The island 
 offers peace and quite away from the  
 bussle of the tourists on the Fife and
 Lothian beaches.                      
 If Mr.Farmers plans to not come to    
 fruition the island is destined to    
 become uninhabited as the lighthouse  
 is earmarked for automation.
