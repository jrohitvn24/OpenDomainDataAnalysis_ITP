		<content> WHEN PEOPLE COME HOME FROM WORK THEY  
 OFTEN LIKE TO HAVE SOME ENTERTAINMENT.
 THE PUB DOWN ON MAIN STREET IS CALLED 
 THE "AULD HOOSE". IT HAS A SNOOKER    
 TABLE, A DART BOARD AND A{PUGIE}      
 MACHINE TOO.SOME PEOPLE ALSO GO TO THE
 HOTEL BECAUSE THEY PREFER IT.THE      
 CHILDREN CAN GO TO ONE OF THE         
 ORGANIZED GROUPS LIKE SCOUTS,BROWNIES 
 ETC AND ALSO GYMNASTICS, FOR OLDER    
 CHILDREN THERE IS A YOUTH CLUB.       
     ALTHOUGH THERE ARE COFFEE         
 MORNINGS, FETES,GALAS AND SALES OF    
 WORK, MOST OF THE TIME PEOPLE HAVE TO 
 PROVIDE THEIR OWN ENTERTAINMENT,OR    
 TRAVEL OUT OF THE VILLAGE.            
                                       
{"PUGIE" }IS SOMETHING LIKE A ONE ARMED
 BANDIT.YOU PUT IN YOUR MONEY,PULL THE 
 HANDLE AND TRY AND GET THREE SYMBOLS  
 EXACTLY THE SAME.                     
                                       </content>
