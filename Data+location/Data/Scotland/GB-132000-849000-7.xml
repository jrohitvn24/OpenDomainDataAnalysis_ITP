		<title>07EDINBANE - HIDDEN AMENITIES</title>
		<content> There is no church in Edinbane, but in
 the next township there are three     
 churches drawing congregations from   
 townships on either side. Other       
 amenities are mobile. There are three 
 banks calling once or twice a week and
 they carry out all routine            
 transactions. The mobile grocer,      
 butcher and fishmonger shops are very 
 useful for older people and for people
 with no car. The shops come at the    
 same time every week. Coal merchants  
 call every fortnight with coal,       
 anthracite or furnacite. Every second 
 Tuesday the mobile library calls with 
 books for adults and little children. 
 Schoolchildren have three deliveries  
 of library books to school each year. 
 A mobile drapery shop calls several   
 times a year. Among many other items, 
 they sell Portree High School         
 Uniforms.                             </content>
