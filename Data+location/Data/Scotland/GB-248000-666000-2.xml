		<content> The annual rainfall for the area      
 is 1034mm and the annual range of     
 temperature varies from 3 to 15       
 degrees Centigrade from January to    
 July. Hard frost and heavy snow in    
 winter is exceptional because of the  
 low relief and close proximity of the 
 area to the Atlantic Ocean. The       
 prevailing winds are westerly, blowing
 from this direction 80% of the year.  
 This brings a succession of low       
 pressure areas from the North Atlantic
 throughout the year making the weather
 very unpredictable.                   
 The high rainfall causes a lot of soil
 leaching and washing out of agro      
 chemicals which is gradually polluting
 streams and rivers in the area,       
 however, the mild winters and high    
 rainfall together produce rich        
 pastures for the dairy farms which    
 lie to the west of the town.          </content>
