		<content>{Horse racing} was at one time very    
 popular in Lanark,however this is now 
 a thing of the past and has been      
 replaced by Trotting. The Trotting    
 meetings take place throughout the    
 summer ,but are not as popular as the{
{Horse Racing}. The Riding of Horses   
 for pleasure is very popular and there
 is a very active Riding club.Another  
 popular sport is {Bowling} and Lanark 
 is in the position of having two      
{Bowling }clubs due to the popularity  
 of the sport.Less well known in Lanark
 is the sport of  {Archery},which has a
 good following.{Popular Entertainment}
 takes several forms in Lanark.To begin
 with there is the Bingo at the old    
 Regal Cinema and there is snooker and 
 Disco dancing at Foxey's.The relative 
 absence of entertainment for young    
 people has had the tendancy to cause  
 problems.                             </content>
