		<content> Although it is predominantly an       
 agricultural area, the latest census  
 indicated that only 14% of the working
 population in the Wellbank/Kellas area
 were employed in agriculture, 79% in  
 other jobs, and 6% unemployed. This is
 indicative of a tendency throughout   
 the area.  Apart from agriculture, the
 main local employers are two Haulage  
 Contractors, two                      
 Blacksmiths/Engineers, and one firm of
 Coachbuilders.  However, the work     
 forces employed by these firms are    
 comparatively small (e.g., two of the 
 firms employ 14 people), and many of  
 the people work outside the immediate 
 area,predominantly in Dundee.  With   
 the continuing mechanisation of farm  
 work, there is little likelihood that 
 this trend will be reversed.
