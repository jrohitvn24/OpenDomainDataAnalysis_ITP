		<content>{Dechmont Castle}was sited north-east  
 of Meldrum School and was burned down 
 in 1906. A new Dechmont House now     
 stands on that site. Some parts of the
 battlements still remain. Our School  
 was named after{Edward Meldrum}who    
 owned Dechmont Castle and was a       
 successful manufacturing chemist who, 
 in association with William Binning   
 and{James 'Paraffin' Young,}set up    
 works to produce and refine oil from  
 shale. This industry was really the   
 beginning of the{British Oil Industry.
 Some other housing in our area is late
 19th or 20th century but in the Deans 
 area it is all new estates built since
 1970. The estates either belong to the
{Livingston Development Corp.}or are   
 privately owned and are terraced,     
 semi-detached or detached.
