		<title>19CROSSGATES AREA THE FUTURE 1</title>
		<content>  What will the future be like for the 
 Crossgates and Halbeath area. In this 
 time of economic recession all over   
 Europe, there are many changes:       
 unemployment and more leisure time    
 are a thing of the present.           
  The Keirsbeath Open Cast Mine will   
 continue to employ its forty men for  
 at least another twelve years.With all
 the shaft mines in the area already   
 closed down, the memories of a booming
 coal industry still remain.           
  Some of the few shops in Crossgates  
 have closed down, maybe because of the
 many cheaper hypermarkets opening in  
 the area.                             
  The by-pass near Crossgates will     
 reduce traffic in an already quiet    
 town. More shops and people will leave
 without new industry being pumped in.
