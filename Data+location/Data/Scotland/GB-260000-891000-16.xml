		<title>16THE HALL, BONAR BRIDGE</title>
		<content> Every two or three weeks there is a   
{disco}for children in the{Bonar Hall. 
 The price to get in is 35p for under  
 10s and 50p for 10s and over. You can 
 buy refreshments during the disco. A  
 cup of coke is 10p and a packet of    
 crisps is 5p. We have lots of         
 different records which are played on 
 a double record player. We also have  
 flashing disco lights. Most of the    
 girls wear trousers and a t-shirt or  
 blouse. The boys wear a jumper or     
 t-shirt and jeans. Some Fridays there 
 is{bingo}in the hall. Quite a lot of  
 people go. Sometimes there are{beetle 
{or whist drives.}During the year there
 are{sales, drumming lessons, badminton
 and{concerts}also held in the hall.   
 Overall the hall is very well used.
