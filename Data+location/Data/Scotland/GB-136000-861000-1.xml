 west of Skye. Over the years it has   
 become a tourist attracion with bed   
 and breakfast houses, a youth hostel  
 and two hotels. There is a lot of work
 at the pier. It is being changed to   
 take a roll-on, roll-off ferry. The   
 village school has forty-three pupils,
 two classrooms of children aged five  
 to eleven years, two teachers, Mrs.   
 MacPhearson and Mrs. Henriksen, the   
 headteacher. About 300 people live in 
 Uig. Fishing, crofting and tourists   
 are the main industry. Earlish is a   
 crofting township east of Uig. There  
 are 22 crofts growing hay, corn and   
 turnips for animal feeding. Most      
 crofts have animals - cattle, sheep   
 and working collie dogs. There are    
 still one or two original houses in   
 Earlish though modern ones are being  
 built. Some crofts have small boats   </content>
