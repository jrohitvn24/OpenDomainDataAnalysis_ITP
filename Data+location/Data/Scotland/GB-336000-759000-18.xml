		<content> In the Cortachy area girls are more   
 fortunate than boys,as there are both 
 a Brownie Pack and a Guide Company.The
 Cubs were disbanded this year due to  
 falling numbers and the boys now go to
 Tannadice.Scouts meet in Tannadice and
 Kirriemuir but not Cortachy.          
 Many women are members of the S.W.R.I.
 Young Wives'Group or the Women's      
 Guild,the last two groups being       
 connected with the church.Both men and
 women are members of Cortachy Curling 
 Club and enjoy curling during the     
 winter.To do this they have to go to  
 Dundee Ice Rink.                      
 Keen fishermen are members of         
 Kirriemuir Angling Club and fish the  
 waters of the Prosen and the South    
 Esk.Clay pigeon shooting is another   
 popular sport.
