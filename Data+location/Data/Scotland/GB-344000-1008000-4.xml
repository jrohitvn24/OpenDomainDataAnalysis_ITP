		<content> Over many years superstitions have    
 been passed down through generations  
 and still exist today.Long ago{rowan  
 trees were planted outside the front  
 door to ward off{witches,}the door    
 lintels were also put in upside down  
 so the witches couldn't read the      
 writing on them.                      
 At{harvest time}the last sheaf of     
 corn was hung up until a mare had a   
 foal.The mare was then given the      
 sheaf.The farmworker who took in the  
 last sheaf was barked at and clumps of
{earth}were thrown at him.             
 A sea monster called{Nuckalvee,}was   
 offended when the people burned{kelp  
 he vented his anger by smiting the    
 horses on the island of Stronsay with 
 a deadly disease called Mortasheen.
