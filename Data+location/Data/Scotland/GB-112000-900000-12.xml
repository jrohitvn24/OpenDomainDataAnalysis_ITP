		<title>12HEALTH CARE IN TARBERT</title>
		<content> In Tarbert there are three doctors.   
 There are also some district nurses   
 for different parts of Harris.There is
 one dentist in the North of Harris.The
 dentist hours are flexible but he is  
 usually in his surgery from 9.30am to 
 about five o clock.Instruments which  
 he uses in a day are his high speed   
 drill,mirror forceps,probes and       
 evacutors.Most of his medical supplies
 come from Glasgow and take about one  
 month but the easy stuff he can get   
 from Stornoway.Most children hate     
 going to the dentist but afterwards   
 they can be sure that they will have  
 no sore teeth.Old folk don't have to  
 worry so much because most of them    
 have no teeth at all or have such bad 
 teeth that they can't feel the pain at
 all.I think our dentist Mr Deas is a  
 good dentist becuase once he is       
 finished you feel much better.        </content>
