		<title>14INTERVIEW WITH CELEBRITY</title>
		<content> Another interesting gentleman in Doune
 is{Mr William Mcleod}who retired this 
 year as janitor of our school. He has 
 lived in Doune all his life and says  
 studying the history of the village is
 his favourite hobby. He was born in   
 1920 and apart from working in the    
 area around Doune has never been far  
 from the village. At school he says   
 his teachers were strict but fair.    
 Boys enjoyed football, marbles and    
 swimming in the Teith in the summer;  
 girls played ball and skipping games. 
 As a young lad of 14 he started work  
 as a gardener, then later changed to  
 gamekeeping. This work suited him as  
 he loves all birds and animals, and he
 could study plants and trees at the   
 same time. He worked as janitor for   
 many years and was always willing to  
 guide us round the village.
