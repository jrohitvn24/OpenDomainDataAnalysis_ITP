		<title>02Local History -East Wemyss</title>
		<content> East Wemyss is a small coastal village
 on the estuary of the River Forth.    
 The name 'Wemyss' is derived from the 
 weems or caves which lie between      
 Buckhaven and East Wemyss.  The word  
 'weem' comes from the Gaelic word     
 'uamha' which means caves.  East      
 Wemyss was originally known as        
 Castleton as it was near to Macduff   
 Castle and the people who worked in   
 the castle lived in East Wemyss.      
 East Wemyss and Coaltown of Wemyss    
 were mining villages from the early   
 19th century until 1968.  The opening 
 of the Michael Colliery, in 1898,     
 meant a rapid growth in the size of   
 the village and the services it       
 provided. In 1967 the colliery was    
 closed after a fire which killed 9    
 men. The closure was a terrible blow  
 to the Wemyss villages which have     
 declined ever since.                  </content>
