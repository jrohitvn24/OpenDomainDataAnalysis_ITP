		<title>07SCHOOLS IN BO'NESS</title>
		<content> In this block we have three schools;  
 two primary and one secondary. We have
 a catholic primary (St.Mary's) and a  
 non catholic primary school (Grange). 
 We also have a secondary school       
 (Bo'ness Academy). All the pupils from
 the other schools go to it apart from 
 the catholic school, they go to       
 Falkirk.                              
 Bo'ness Academy has more than 1000    
 pupils. It is very big and has large  
 playing fields. The non catholic      
 school has about 200 and the catholic 
 about 100 children in them. All of the
 schools are in nice grounds. The      
 secondary school teaches from first   
 year to sixth year. The primary       
 schools teach from primary 1 to       
 primary 7. All the schools are quite  
 near each other. All of the schools   
 are near houses so most people do not 
 have to walk far.                     </content>
