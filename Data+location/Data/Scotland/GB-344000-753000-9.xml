		<content>    ON THE LAND OF WHAT IS NOW         
 BATTLEDYKES FARM THERE WAS ONCE A{    
{ROMAN CAMP}.IT WAS PROTECTED BY A     
 DITCH AND A WALL WHICH SERVED IT WELL 
 AGAINST ATTACK FROM NEARBY{PICTISH    
{VILLAGES.}THE LEGIONARIES DUG         
 TRENCHES, OR DYKES,AROUND THE CAMP TO 
 MAKE THE WALLS MORE DIFFICULT TO      
 CLIMB.                                
    WHERE THE WALLS WERE, CAN ONLY BE  
 SEEN IN JULY OR AUGUST AS THE CROPS   
 GROW HIGHER WHERE THE SOIL HAS        
 BEEN TURNED AND MIXED WHEN THE ROMANS 
 FILLED THE TRENCHES WITH THE SOIL FROM
 THE WALL.                             
    THE FARMER HAS DISCOVERED SEVERAL  
 ROMAN{GRINDING STONES}WHILE PLOUGHING 
 HIS FIELDS.ON THE ORDNANCE SURVEY MAP 
 A{TUMULUS}(BURIAL GROUND) IS MARKED   
 SOUTH OF THE CAMP,WHERE URNS,SOME     
 STILL CONTAINING THE ASHES OF THE     
 DEAD, HAVE BEEN FOUND.                </content>
