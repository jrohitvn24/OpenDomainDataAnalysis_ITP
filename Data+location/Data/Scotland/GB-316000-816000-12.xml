		<title>12THE POTTERY SHOP</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Pottery Shop has been in existence
 for 2 years.  It takes two minutes to 
 make an average size piece of pottery.
  After that it has to be fired and    
 decorated.  The Potter would like the 
 shop to be a bit bigger so that she   
 could work in the premises rather than
 at home.  The Potter is quite skilled 
 at making pottery as she went to Art  
 School before she was married.  The   
 most expensive thing she has ever made
 was a big pot which cost about Â£7O but
 she would not sell it.  In the height 
 of the summer she gets about lOO      
 visitors a day.  They come from all   
 over the world.  She had a very       
 interesting customer who bought quite 
 a lot of her pottery.
