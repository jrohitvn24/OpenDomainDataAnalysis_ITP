		<content>  There is great concern over the      
 Rates,a form of{property tax.}There   
 has been a vast increase much to the  
 disapproval of the community.A        
{rateable value}is given to each       
 property taking into account size and 
 amenities.An appropriate{rate}is then 
 set at so many pence in the pound;the 
 present rate is 59p in the pound.For a
 house valued at Â£1,000 you would have 
 to pay Â£590.Rates along with{taxes    
 paid to the Government pay for        
 services such as education.           
  Another concern is the{strikes}by    
{teachers}in schools in the area.This  
 has badly affected some of the        
 Secondary Schools attended by pupils  
 in the area(Williamwood and Mearns    
 Castle High Schools).This is because  
 the strikes have been concentrated in 
 areas such as this whose Member of    
 Parliament is a Government Minister.  </content>
