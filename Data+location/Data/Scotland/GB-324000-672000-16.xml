 Edinburgh{roads}and{transport}less    
 than any other form of road traffic,so
 wasting valuable resources. They also 
 resulted in 38 deaths and 905 injuries
 in 1983 and account for up to 85% of  
 urban air and noise pollution. The    
 other vehicular possibility for urban 
 Edinburgh travellers is{public        
{transport}by way of bus.This is       
 important since 65% of vehicle        
 journeys to the city centre are       
 undertaken by public transport whilst 
 only 46% of Lothian households have   
 access to a car.It is more efficient  
 as more people are transported for    
 less fuel on less road space. The car 
 is presently given unfair importance. 
 As expensive new roads, designed for  
 private cars, are planned public      
 transport is restricted.
