		<title>18SURVEY ON SHOPPING</title>
		<content> IN OUR DESIGNATED AREA THERE IS A     
 SHOPPING CENTRE.  THE SHOPKEEPER (A   
 CHEMIST) HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS IN THE  
 CENTRE FOR 14 MONTHS.  HE HAS COME    
 FROM BLACKPOOL AFTER READING AN ADVERT
 IN A MEDICAL JOURNAL.                 
 HE BELIEVES THAT THE AREA IS A GOOD   
 ONE TO SET UP BUSINESS.  ALSO PROVIDED
 IN THE SHOPPING CENTRE IS A           
 SUPERMARKET, A BAKERS, A BUTCHERS, A  
 GROCERS etc.                          
 THE BUILDINGS IN THE CENTRE ARE GOOD  
 AND SPACIOUS ALTHOUGH LEAKING ROOFS   
 HAVE CAUSED COMPLAINTS.               
 ON THE WHOLE WE FOUND THAT THIS IS A  
 GOOD AREA FOR A SHOP.
