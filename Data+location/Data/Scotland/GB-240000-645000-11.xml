 Many knitwear factories have closed in
 the past ten years. However the       
 Spinners and Dyers,T.W Mackie and Sons
 are flourishing at Bridgend  as is the
 old Bonnet making firm, Sim's at Wylie
 Place. Domino Textiles at Bridgend,   
 McCrae in Avenue St,Newtown knitwear  
 and Top Scotch in Wylie Place are     
 producing many garments using         
 fashionable man made materials for    
 knitting. Wilson and Wylie, toolmakers
 still produce small tools but have    
 recently branched out to hiring out   
 small machinery and tools for gardens 
 and D.I.Y to the general public.      
 Rafferty in High Street and Bridgend  
 make wrought iron goods. At David Dale
 Avenue there is Lainshaw Farm Eggs    
 packing and marketing eggs produced on
 Robert Howie's farms.
