		<title>17Kirkhills Farm Whitehills</title>
		<content> I have been farming for 19 years and  
 was born in the house where I now     
 live, although this has been greatly  
 extended.                             
{The recent pattern in agriculture has 
{seen farms increasing steadily in size
 to enable use of larger machinery and 
 maximise output. When I took over     
 Kirkhills it was {13 acres}, a croft  
 rather than a farm. Now it extends to{
{440 acres,}248 in and around the      
 village of Whitehills with outfields  
 at Montblairy, Cornhill and           
 Glendronach. It now takes in{Kirktown 
{of Boyndie Farm, Blackpots Farm,      
{Bellman Croft, Kirkhill Croft and the 
{'fued lands' or 'fisher riggs'}       
 formerly allocated to the fishermen of
 Whitehills.                           
 The land is all arable, Grade 2. {    
{(There is no Grade 1 land in Scotland)
