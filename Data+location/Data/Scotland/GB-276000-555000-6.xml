		<content> conifers such as Sitka Spruce and     
 Douglas Fir were being cultivated.    
 These trees were all the property of  
 the Forestry Commission who told us   
 that in March 1985 a number of the    
 Douglas firs had been cut down and    
 added that more felling was planned   
 for the month of August.              
 Other vegetation grew on the rich     
 peaty soil. We noticed gorse with its 
 yellow flowers, ferns, tall grasses   
 and different kinds of mosses such as 
 spagnum moss, and litchen which grew  
 on dykes and on tree trunks.          
 Three quarters of the way to the top  
 of the hill, the trees suddenly come  
 to an end. The grass faded out too and
 thick bracken mixed with heather took 
 its place.                            
 Close to the summit the ground became 
 pure rock covered only by a little    
 heather.                              </content>
