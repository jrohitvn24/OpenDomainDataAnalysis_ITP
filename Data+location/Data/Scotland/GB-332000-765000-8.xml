 first church in the glen, there have  
 been many over the centuries.The ruins
 of the 2nd oldest Episcopal Chapel in 
 Angus are still clearly visable.      
  There have been three churches around
 the present site. The first was       
 built in 1601, the second in 1665 and 
 the present church around 1800 at a   
 cost of Â£400. It was an extension     
 church of Kirriemuir Parish until 1873

{Church of Scotland.}Long ago it was   
 united with Glen Clova Church. There  
 was one minister in charge of both    
 churches. He had to walk across the   
 hills between the two churches.The    
 walk is now called{The Minister's Walk
