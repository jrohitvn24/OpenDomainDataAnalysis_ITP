		<content> The D.C.L was built in 1746 for whisky
 making. Since then it has expanded    
 greatly also making yeasts, bread and 
 experimental products. The buildings  
 have also expanded greatly now        
 including vats, yeast houses and labs.
 Pre WW2 production turned entirely to 
 yeasts, the main ingredient being     
 mollasses. Post-war products were     
 extended by the use of autolysed yeast
 and in 1948 active dried yeast        
 pellets were brought onto the market. 
  A packing station for this yeast was 
 built in 1962. Recently a new product 
 SPADY (small particle active dried    
 yeast) was introduced.The original    
 copper fermenting vats have been      
 replaced by stainless-steel ones and  
 more fermenters have been introduced. 
 The fermenter house is being replaced 
 to bring it up to the required levels.
