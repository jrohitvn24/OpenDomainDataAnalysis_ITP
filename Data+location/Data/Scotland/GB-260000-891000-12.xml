		<title>12SHEEP DOG TRIALS,BONAR</title>
		<content> Each summer{sheep dog trials          
 start. There are two kinds, a dog any 
 age or just a dog under three. The    
 under threes is called a Nursery dog  
 trial. The Nursery trials are mainly  
 in the Autumn and there are one or two
 in the Spring. It is mostly farmers   
 and shepherds who take part. It is all
{Collie dogs}that run. They have to    
 have a judge to judge the trials. You 
 get so many points for outruns,       
 penning, etc. First of all you get    
 three sheep which are about 300 yards 
 away. You send your dog away either to
 the right or to the left. After your  
 dog collects the sheep from the top of
 the field you have to make your dog   
 drive the sheep down in a straight    
 line through two sets of fetch        
 gates. Then he has to put the sheep in
 a small pen and shed one.
