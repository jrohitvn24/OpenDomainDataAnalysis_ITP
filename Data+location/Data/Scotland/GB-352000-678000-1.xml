		<content> East Lothian District                 
 The area to the west and north of East
 Fortune is rich agriculturla land,    
 supporting crops of barley, rape and  
 some root crops. There is also a      
 sizeable garden centre at Congalton   
 Gardens. The landscape is gently      
 undulating almost monotonous with the 
 wide expanse of ploughed fields       
 bounded largely by hedges. The main   
 village is East Fortune, although the 
 village consist mainly of a military  
 hospital, now used by the NHS and     
 gradually running down. Plans for its 
 closure are being discussed. South of 
 East Fortune lies the military        
 airfield, still used to some extent,  
 but perhaps best known locally for the
 Sunday market held there each week.   
 The Museum of Flight is also situated 
 on the airfield, open to the public.
