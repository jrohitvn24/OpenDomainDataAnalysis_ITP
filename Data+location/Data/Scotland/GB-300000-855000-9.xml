		<title>09NEWS JUNE 1985 West Forres</title>
		<content> Another interesting event in the news 
 this week was the fact that a Scottish
 pilot Robbie Roberts was planning to  
 fly upside down from Lossiemouth to   
 Findhorn,a fifteen mile flight.Robbie 
 will complete the flight on 29th June 
 in aid of the newly formed Forres     
 branch of the Save the Children Fund. 
 The public have been warned to be on  
 the look-out for forged fifty pound   
 notes which may be circulating in the 
 Moray area.A number of forged notes   
 have been presented over the past few 
 weeks mainly at licensed premises in  
 the Elgin and Forres area.            
  Drivers on the A96 on the western    
 approaches to Forres were asked to    
 exercise caution on the 27th June as  
 Grampian Roads Depsrtment attempted to
 repair a section of the road which    
 broke up the previous day following   
 torrential rain.                      </content>
