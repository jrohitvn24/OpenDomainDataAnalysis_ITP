		<title>05     CRANSLEY FARM</title>
		<content> To the NE of Fowlis Easter there is a 
 relatively large farm called          
 Cransley.It is mainly a mixed farm    
 containing sheep, poultry, potatoes,  
 cereals, fruit farming and oil seed   
 rape.                                 
     There was once a routeway leading 
 from Cransley,remains of which can    
 still be seen,to an old drove road    
 which local herdsmen used to drive    
 cattle from surrounding farms to      
 market sales.This drove road called   
 the LOGAN ( which means rocking       
 stone)is now overgrown with wild      
 grasses. It was a very important      
 communication channel in its day from 
 this area to Coupar Angus. The        
 historical significance is reflected  
 in the major housing estate in Liff   
 Village which bears its name.
