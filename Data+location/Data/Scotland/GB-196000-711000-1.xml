{Dalavich}is situated on the banks of  
 Loch Awe in{Argyll}in the west of     
 Scotland.The nearest town, Oban,26    
 miles away,is a small town beside the 
 sea.  The next school is 7 miles      
 away.                                 
   There are many trees,mainly silver  
 birch,douglas fir and pines.On walks  
 you can see animals that you would    
 rarley see in a city like roe,fallow  
 and red deer,squirrels,white stags and
 lots more.                            
   The weather here is usually very    
 wet.Sometimes it is warm but it is    
 very rare for it to be hot.You can    
 trust the weathermen to say "very wet 
 and cold"for our area.                
   The houses here are usually made of 
 wood because  we have so much of it   
 but some are made of stone.
