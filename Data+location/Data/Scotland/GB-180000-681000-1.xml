		<title>01Hill Area NW Achaghraid</title>
		<content> This hilly area once used as upland   
 grazing for sheep is now almost       
 entirely given over to coniferous     
 plantations, both Forestry Commission 
 and privately owned. The area has been
 cut into by the Inverneil Burn running
 NW to SE. In its upper asin the burn  
 is a meandering stream but about 1/2  
 miles above the point whre it crosses 
 under the B8024 road it enters a deep 
 sided gorge. This section is a SSSI a 
 site of special scientific importance.
 The Inverneil (or Achabhead) Bridge is
 said to be the highest above stream   
 leve in Argyll, it was built in the   
 1840's as part of the constructin of  
 the new Inverneil Hill Road. The      
 morsoleum in square 12 is the private 
 mansoleum of the Campbells of         
 Inverneil who owned this land from    
 1776 to some time in 1950's. There are
 remains of old lead mines in area.    </content>
