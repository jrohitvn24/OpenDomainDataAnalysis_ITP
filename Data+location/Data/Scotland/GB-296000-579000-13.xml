		<content>                                       
 The Policeman's job is not an easy    
 one.  His average day begins at 9 am  
 and finishes at 5 pm.  This is called{
{Day Shift.}Another shift is{Late Shift
 which begins at 5 pm and ends at 1 am.
  Every morming the police have to sign
 on and up_date themselves in the books
 with previous incidents from the night
 before.  Most trouble is found with { 
{Vandalism}and {Robbery}etc, when      
 people are out or on holiday.  Most   
 problems are found in Isolated areas, 
 cottages and small farms.             
  The policemen's beat takes them as   
 far north as the Ae Village and as far
 South as Southerness.  Their beat also
 takes them to areas like Glencaple and
 Bankend, and locally to Amisfield.
