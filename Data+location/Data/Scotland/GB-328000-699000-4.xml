		<content> Glenrothes got its name from the      
 Leslies of Rothes who owned the       
 estates around Glenrothes.Glen came   
 into Glenrothes because we are in a   
 valley.On our coat of arms we have two
 oak trees which represent Fythkill,   
 Leslie.There is a chevron on the      
 otters head from the arms of Balfour  
 of Balbirnie.There are wavy lines to  
 represent the river Leven.At the      
 bottom there is a winding wheel to    
 represent the miners and the colliery.
 The motto is"EX TERRA VIS".           
    Pitteuchar was built in the late   
 60s and early 70s.The first building  
 to take place was at the primary      
 school in the south of the precinct.  
 Building continued through the 70s as 
 the precinct of Stenton took shape.   
 Though there is an industrial estate  
 nearby,local people find work over a  
 wide geographical area.               </content>
