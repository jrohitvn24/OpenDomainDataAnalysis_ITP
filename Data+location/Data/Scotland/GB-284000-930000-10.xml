		<title>10Peats, Kinbrace</title>
		<content> There are a number of peat bogs in the
 area. Peat,a form of turf, is used as 
 fuel.The top layer is removed by a    
 flaughter spade.Then a peat knife is  
 used to cut the peat into big         
 rectangles.While somebody cuts the    
 peats someone else spreads them on the
 bank.When the peats are dry on one    
 side you turn them round and stack    
 them up against each other. When the  
 other side is dry they are ready to be
 taken home. Work starts in the spring 
 when the frost is out of the ground.  
 As there are not many trees around    
 most people rely on peat for their    
 fuel. Peat is also used for growing   
 plants. Eighteen kilometres from      
 Kinbrace there is a peat processing   
 factory which supplies horticultural  
 and agricultural peat.
