		<title>01Area-Achavanich Caithness</title>
		<content> This flat area of moorland in central 
 cathness cptures the unique quality of
 the county. The landscape, treeless   
 and barren is unlike any other part of
 the north of Scotland it is difficult 
 in this area to make a living from    
 farming, but agriculture is themain   
 industry in this part of Britain.     
 Achavanich the main farm covers 529   
 acres and has been farmed by the      
 Mackay family for almost a century.   
 The land offers mainly rough graz/ing 
 for cattle and sheep, but some        
 cultivation around the dwelling houses
 has taken palce. The aea is rich in   
 peat,which is harvsted annually for   
 fuel by those in the area. There are  
 no amenities,b ut the farm is a focal 
 point for those travelling in the     
 county. The remoteness of this area   
 would be hard for a city dweller to   
 comprehend.                           </content>
