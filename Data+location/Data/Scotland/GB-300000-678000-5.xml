		<title>05OUR MOTORWAY SURVEY :BO'NESS</title>
		<content> On Thursday 30th May 1985 we did a    
{survey}(for 1 hour) on the{M9}which   
 runs from Stirling to Edinburgh. We   
 counted the vehicles from a flyover   
 where the A803 crosses over the M9. In
 our survey we found out that the      
 number of cars coming from the west   
 was about the same as the number      
 coming from the east. We saw a Porsche
 and a white Lotus.Altogether the      
 number of vehicles coming from the    
 east was 221 and there were 229 coming
 from the west. We saw only 2 buses    
 coming in each direction.
