		<content>                                       
 Giffnock used to be a village in its  
 own right, but now has become one of  
 the South-side Suburbs of{GLASGOW}    
                                       
 In the North of Giffnock was a{QUARRY}
 where much of the{grey}sandstone used 
 in the building of the famous Glasgow{
{tenements}originated                  
                                       
 The quarry was known as Braidbar      
 Quarry, and it is in this area that{  
{BRAIDBAR PRIMARY SCHOOL}was built ten 
 years ago                             
                                       
 The building is only two storeys high 
 because otherwise there is always the 
 risk that the school might sink into  
 the old quarry tunnels beneath !!
