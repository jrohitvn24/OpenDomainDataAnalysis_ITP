		<content> In 1968 the{Abbey Church}celebrated   
 its{300th anniversary}by holding a big
 Fete. With the money raised the church
 was renovated inside and out. The     
 chuch members did all the outside work
 themselves.                           
 In 1976 the{Crown Prince of Japan and 
{his wife Princess Michiko visited     
{Madderty Primary}School.Lord and Lady 
 Mansfield accompanied them. They      
 presented the school with an Origami  
 kit and a Red Cross scrap book made by
 school- children in Tokyo.            
 In March 1984{a fierce gale}blew      
 through this area. Many huge trees    
 were blown down blocking roads. A     
 beautiful wood near the village       
 of St.David's was blown down. A lovely
 place, called The Lady's Walk, where  
 people used to go for a walk,was      
 destroyed.
