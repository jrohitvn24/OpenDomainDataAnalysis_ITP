		<content> To the north and south of Loch Carron,
 this is a sparsely populated area of  
 great natural beauty.  The land rises 
 from the sea loch to hills, crags and 
 mountains. The mostly rocky coastline 
 is indented by small bays, coves and  
 beaches(some sandy) and includes two  
 estuaries. Primary land cover is      
 coniferous forestry commission        
 plantation: native oak and birch also 
 occur. Additionally, land is used for 
 grazing and pasture, and there is open
 heath. Historically interesting is the
 ruin of Strome castle, dramatically   
 situated on a rocky promontory looking
 west over the sea to Skye. The mostly 
 native population resides mainly in   
 small enclaves at Strome Ferry, Port  
 Chullin and North Strome. Occupations 
 include crofting, forestry, fishing   
 and oil-rig construction at nearby    
 Kishorn.                              </content>
