		<content> In 1958 the priest moved to the       
 neighbouring village of Slamannan.    
 The church at Barnsmuir was now       
 getting old and was far away from     
 where the majority of the Catholic    
 Community was living. Eventually they 
 were able to buy a piece of land      
 situated in the village of Slamannan  
 and on 6th June,1960,the hopes of the 
 congregation were at last realised.   
 The new church was consecrated by His 
 Eminence, Cardinal Gordon Joseph      
 Gray. The Roman Catholic members of   
 Limerigg now travel to Slamannan for  
 their place of worship. The old Chapel
 House at Barnsmuir is still standing  
 and has been transformed into a       
 private house but there are now no    
 visible remains of "St. Mary's".
