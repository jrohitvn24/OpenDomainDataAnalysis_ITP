 the new generation of Britons to gain 
 some understanding of the third world.

 Project Trust volunteers work are     
 Africa,South America,Asia and         
 Australia.Volunteers work as          
 Teacher_aides in Social Service and   
 Adventure work.They are between       
 171/2 and 19.At first they are        
 invited to a selection course on Coll 
 and each volunteer is assessed.       
 Successful Candidates are then matched
 with particular Projects.             
   Each Volunteer has to raise Â£1250   
 towards the cost of going abroad.     
   Volunteers spend a year working     
 abroad and it usual for them to be    
 between school and college.
