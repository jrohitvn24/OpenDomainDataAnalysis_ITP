		<title>10PORT ELPHINSTONE INVERURIE</title>
		<content> Port Elphinstone stands at the        
 southern end of Inverurie across the  
 Inverurie, or Don, Bridge. In 1921 it 
 became part of the burgh of Inverurie,
 but originally it was a separate      
 township built at the terminus of the 
 Aberdeenshire Canal.                  
                                       
 The canal was built to transport goods
 from the Inverurie area to Aberdeen   
 where they could be conveyed by sea.  
 Thomas Telford designed the canal,    
 which was officially opened in 1805.  
 It was 19 miles long following the    
 valley of the River Don to Aberdeen   
 Harbour.                              
                                       
 Passengers as well as freight were    
 transported to and from Port          
 Elphinstone. Slates, stones, dung,    
 coal, lime and grain were the main    
 goods carried.                        </content>
