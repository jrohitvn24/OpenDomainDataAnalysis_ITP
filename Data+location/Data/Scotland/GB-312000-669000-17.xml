		<title>17GALA HISTORY</title>
		<content>  Ratho's{Gala week}has been going on  
 for about 50 years,though once it was 
 stopped for 4 years because people    
 from the nearby towns came and took   
 over.They began to call it a{carnival}
 instead.Another reason the Gala was   
 stopped was because of the 2nd World  
 War.Then the villagers decided to     
 start their own Gala again,following  
 the carnival system by having it last 
 1 week,when before it was a Saturday  
 afternoon.The{Gala Queen}has either   
 been crowned by a farmer's wife or a  
 teacher.In 1983 the Gala Queen was    
 Zena Johnston and 1984 was Threslyn   
  Duffy.Some people say the reason for 
 it starting was to celebrate summer,  
 others say it was a cultural affair   
 for farmers to show off their cattle. 
 Children used to get new clothes for  
 the Gala because to every body it was 
 a very special ocassion.              </content>
