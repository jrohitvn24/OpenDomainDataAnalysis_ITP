		<title>17WORKING IN DALRY FACTORY</title>
		<content> My working day is from 7a.m. to 3p.m. 
 As the shift utilities engineer, I am 
 in charge of a 200M.W. power station  
 with self-generating capacity of      
 23M.W.  My job involves supplying     
 steam, electricity, cooling water,    
 brine and nitrogen for the manufacture
 of vitamin powders.                   
 Four operators and another shift      
 engineer help meet the demands made by
 the production side.                  
 In these days of ever increasing      
 technology, most of my job is in the  
 central control room where I can      
 monitor the utilities operation from  
 the instrumentation.  If an alarm or  
 malfunction develops, instruction can 
 be passed on immediately by a         
 multitone intercom system.            
 The job is interesting as it covers a 
 wide range of operations, machinery   
 and equipment.                        </content>
