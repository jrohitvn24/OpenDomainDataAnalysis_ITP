		<content>   Mrs Boyd remarks that some buildings
 on the High Street have been changed, 
 many shop fronts have been modernized 
 and in her opinion completely ruined. 
 Mrs Boyd thinks it would be nice if   
 tourists remained in Moffat for longer
 periods instead of one or two nights. 
                                       
   Unlike older residents of Moffat    
 teenagers are not so contented with   
 life in the town.They complain of the 
 lack of a swimming pool,cinema and    
 other sources of teenage              
 entertainment.They feel that Moffat is
 a place for old people to retire to   
 and not a place for teenagers to live.
   Children who have not reached their 
 teens are very happy to live here     
 taking part in such activities as     
 Majorettes,Brownies,Cubs,Guides,Scouts
 ,Youth Theatre and other clubs like   
 the Young Ornithologists.             </content>
