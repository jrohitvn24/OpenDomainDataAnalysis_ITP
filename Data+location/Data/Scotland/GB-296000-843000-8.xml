		<title>08A FERNESS HOUSEHOLD</title>
		<content>    One Ferness family has 2 adults and
 3 children from 4_9yrs.When 2 children
 have left for school, the parents have
 a very busy day. eg:-                 
  morning tasks _ milking and feeding  
 goats, housework, making beds, some   
 washing.                              
  afternoon _ gardening, collect       
 children from school car, baking,     
 preparing meal, craftwork.            
  evening _ wash up , supervising      
 children's homework, putting children 
 to bed, ironing.                      
    The family shops once a week mostly
 to Nairn (11 miles distant) for       
 groceries, and when clothes are       
 required, a longer journey of around  
 23 miles takes them to Inverness. A   
 car is a necessity as shops are so far
 away.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
