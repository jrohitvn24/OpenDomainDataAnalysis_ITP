		<content> LARKHALL SOCIAL CONCERNS              
 ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES OF SOCIAL     
 PROBLEMS IS THE ABUSE OF ALCOHOL AND  
 DRUGS.ALCOHOLISM AND HEAVY DRINKING   
 ARE LONG STANDING PROBLEMS BUT DRUG   
 TAKING IS A NEW PHENOMENON AFFECTING  
 YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR.THE AVERAGE
 AGE OF ADULTS TAKING HARD DRUGS       
 e.g HEROIN,IS 22.THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S 
 VERY EXPENSIVE AND THE MAY HAVE TO    
 SPEND UP TO Â£30 PER DAY.THIS IS UNLIKE
 GLUE SNIFFING WHICH IS VERY CHEAP AND 
 SO IS POPULAR WITH THE 13-18 AGE GROUP
 ALTHOUGH THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE OF     
 30_40 WHO SNIFF GLUE. THE ABUSE OF    
 DRUGS OR ALCOHOL LEADS TO ABOUT 60% OF
 CRIME.THIS IS MOSTLY THEFT TO FINANCE 
 THEIR HABITS ,BUT SOME ALCOHOL RELATED
 CRIMES ARE CAUSED WHILE UNDER THE     
 INFLUENCE OF DRINK.AS GLUE SNIFFING IS
 STILL LEGAL POLICE MUST REFER THESE   
 YOUNGSTERS TO OUTSIDE AGENCIES.       </content>
