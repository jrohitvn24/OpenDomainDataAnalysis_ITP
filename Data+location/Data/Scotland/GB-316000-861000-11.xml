		<content> Pittendreich Mill, Elgin              
                                       
 Pittendreich Mill was built over 100  
 years ago by Moray Estates.  Water    
 from the Black Burn turned the mill   
 wheel which operated the mill-stone.  
 Oats were first thoroughly dried over 
 a huge kiln and then milled to make   
 oat-meal.  The mill was used until    
 the 1930s, lay unused for a number of 
 years and was bought in 1976 by Mr.   
 Russell, an architect, and his wife   
 who have altered it and made it their 
 home.  And a very interesting home it 
 is.  The kiln, with its quaint chimney
 has been retained.  One mill-stone is 
 a feature of the lounge and the other 
 is embedded in a grassy bank outside. 
 Many buildings are now used for a     
 purpose different from that for which 
 they were built.
