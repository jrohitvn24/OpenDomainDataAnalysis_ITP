		<content> One of the best known views looks     
 across to the Eildon Hills.This is    
 known as Scott's View,a popular place 
 to stop.THe Eildon Hills are the most 
 famous Borders landmark.After a fairly
 easy climb, the visitor can stand on  
 top of Middle Eildon and gain a       
 breathtaking view of the landscape.   
     For the sporting St.Boswells      
 offers a 9 hole course with a new     
 clubhouse.The Tweed is famous for its 
 fishing for trout and salmon.Permits  
 for local fishing are available in    
 local shops.The area is managed by the
 Local Angling Association.            
     Apart from the road traffic       
 increasing tourism has little effect  
 on the villages.It does not bring much
 business to local shops. Most foreign 
 tourist associate our area with       
 knitwear shops, and our local ones    
 have closed.                          </content>
