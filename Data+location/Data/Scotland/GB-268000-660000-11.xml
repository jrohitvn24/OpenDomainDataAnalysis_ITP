         In our area the worst form of 
pollution is litter. It is everywhere, 
in the parks,pavements,etc. Our local  
'Glen' was once a beautiful place with 
its trees,water and walks, but a lot   
of rubbish was dumped there, even      
things like old cars and washing mach- 
ines. There are people working to      
clean this up, as well as all the      
broken glass and cans which can        
hurt wildlife.                         
         Some of our pupils went out   
to clean up around the school, but it  
only stayed clear for a while then     
it was as bad as ever.                 
         Although the river and stream 
in the 'Glen' are also polluted from   
factories and with rubbish, the air is 
not too bad. We have no smoky factor-  
ies. Litter is still the worst problem.
