		<title>18Birds in the Girvan Valley</title>
		<content>   There are both common and rare birds
 in the Girvan Valley.                 
   The more widely seen birds include {
{blackbirds, yellowhammers, finches,   
{house martins and carrion crows.}The  
 increase in number of these crows has 
 affected other birds such as{larks and
{lapwings}causing their numbers to     
 diminish.                             
   Modern farming has affected many    
 birds, most recently the{corncrake,}  
 which has disappeared from the Girvan 
 Valley in the last 10 years.          
   On the R. Girvan it is possible to  
 see a breeding pair of swans and on   
 the higher ground there are{kestrels, 
{sparrowhawks and a pair of buzzards.  
   Being near the coast means that many
{gulls}can also be seen with{herring   
{and blackbacked gulls}the most common.
   In winter{redwing and fieldfare}    
 migrate south and are seen till spring</content>
