		<content> The population of Pitlessie and it's  
 locality has remained relatively      
 static since the 1950's- around{300.  
 This can be contrasted with a thriving
 population of over{500}living here at 
 the turn of the century.              
 A substantial proportion of residents 
 in and around Pitlessie are older,    
 retired people who have lived,if not  
 all,at least the greater part of their
 lives,in the village.                 
 An emerging and increasing second     
 category of inhabitants is the young  
 family unit which has chosen to live  
 in a small village environment for the
 obvious advantages of rural life.     
 Occupations are predominately         
{farming-related,}thereafter people are
 generally employed in{light           
{industry/manufacturing}in the adjacent
 towns of{Cupar}and{Glenrothes.
