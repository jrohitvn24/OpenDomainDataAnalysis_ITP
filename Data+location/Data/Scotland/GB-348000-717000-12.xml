		<title>12HAMILTON HALL</title>
		<content> When Hamilton Hall was built in 1894, 
 it was the largest hotel in St.Andrews
 and was named the Grand Hotel. In     
 1949, it was bought by the University 
 as a students' residence. Used first  
 for men, then for women, it is now    
 mixed. There are places for 112       
 students in Hall and 19 in an annex at
 Edencourt in City Road. During the    
 academic year 1984-85, it housed 56   
 men and 73 women students. The balance
 of men and women students varies from 
 year to year. Priority is given to 4th
 students in their Senior Honours      
 Year,followed by 1st Year students for
 whom about 50% of places are          
 reserved.The fees, per Year, are Â£953 
 for a single room and Â£858 for a      
 shared room. This includes three meals
 a day except on Saturdays and Sundays 
 when there is no evening meal. During 
 vacations it is used for conferences. </content>
