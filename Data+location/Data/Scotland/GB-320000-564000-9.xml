		<content> St.Columba's Primary is the only      
 school in our block.It is a Roman     
 Catholic school.                      
 It is quite small with just over 60   
 children attending.There are three    
 classes and three teachers,including  
 the head teacher Mr.Wilson.           
 The present school building was built 
 24 years ago to replace the old school
 building which has been converted into
 a house for Fr.Hainey,Parish Priest of
 St.Columba's R.C.Church.              
 The children who attend St.Columba's  
 School come from Annan,Eastriggs,     
 Gretna and Springfield.They attend    
 St.Columba's because their parents    
 wish them to receive a Catholic       
 education.There are some children in  
 St.Columba's who are not Catholics.   
 Their parents want them to be educated
 in a small school.
