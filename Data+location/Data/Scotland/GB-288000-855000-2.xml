		<title>02SHOPS IN NAIRN</title>
		<content> Most of the shops in{Nairn}are centred
 around the{High Street,King           
{Street,Leopold Street &amp; Cawdor Road.  
{  }The {High Street}has the greatest  
 amount of shops.Of the{ninety_three   
  shops we counted,seventeen  sold     
 types of{food,}eleven sold{clothes,}  
 and because Nairn has tourists in the 
 summer season seven shops catered for 
 this type of customer.                
    The remainder of the shops sold    
 articles ranging from toys to videos. 
 What we noticed was that eleven of    
 the shops were empty.Recently two     
 grocers,a ladies clothes shop,a       
 jewellers,a dairy,a shoe shop,a       
 coal office,and a greengrocers has    
 closed.                               
    We wondered if the opening of a {  
{Templetons Supermarket}in {King Street
 and a new enclosed shopping precinct  
 in Inverness has affected Nairn trade.</content>
