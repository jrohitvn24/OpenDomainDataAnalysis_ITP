		<title>05Employment in Invermoriston</title>
		<content> There is a high proportion of elderly 
 retired people in addition to a large 
 number of unemployed or those who have
 only part-time employment.Much of the 
 woek is seasonal catering for holiday-
 makers.                               
  The main employer is Glenmoriston    
 Estates with its many chalets,hotel,  
 craft and gift shops in addition to   
 its office and estate staff.The       
 Forestry Commission has recently cut  
 back on the number of jobs it can     
 offer but still employs about 15% of  
 Invermoriston's population.The North  
 of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board has  
 also fewer workers.The nearby Fishfarm
 employs a few young people .The       
 village shop provides part-time work  
 for a few women.A large proportion    
 travel a long distance to work coming 
 home at weekends ,or have to leave    
 home altogether to obtain employment. </content>
