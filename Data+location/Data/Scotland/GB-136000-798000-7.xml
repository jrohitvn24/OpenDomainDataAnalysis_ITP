		<title>07MANX SHEARWATERS ON RHUM</title>
		<content> The cuillin of{Rhum}provide breeding  
 grounds for c.100,000 pairs of burrow 
 _nesting{Manx Shearwaters.}These      
 nocturnal seabirds first return to    
 Rhum from their{wintering grounds off 
{S.America}in March &amp; by May are ready 
 to lay their{single white eggs.}Both  
 parents take turns in incubating the  
 egg in the safety of their burrow over
 about 50 days. The downy chicks are   
 fed a rich diet of small fish so that 
 by about 55 days old they are heavier 
 than their parents! Fledglings finally
 leave their burrows when about 70 days
 old to begin the long flight to the   
 wintering grounds. Young birds first  
{return to the breeding grounds when   
{2_4 years old &amp; spend progressively   
{longer periods at the colony during   
{succeeding summers before first breed 
{_ing when 6 or more years old.}Manx   
 Shearwaters may live for over 25 years</content>
