		<title>06EDUCATION IN ASSYNT</title>
		<content> In Assynt, local Churches operated    
 schools until our present school      
 opened in 1872 with 32 pupils. Our    
 school used to be a Junior Secondary  
 School until 1974. Pupils of Secondary
 age now have the choice to travel 35  
 miles to Ullapool daily or to board   
 weekly at Golspie, 65 miles away! The 
 largest attendence at our school was  
 recorded in 1919 when 90 pupils       
 attended. Today Lochinver has 52      
 pupils with 3 full-time teachers and 4
 visiting teachers. All the Children   
 take school dinners! The school roll  
 is critical today, because of         
 educational cut-backs. The school will
 be threatened with the loss of a      
 full-time teacher if numbers fall! The
 school is uniquely situated on a      
 peninsula in the middle of the Culag  
 Loch! A traditional stone building, it
 is the only school in our area.       </content>
