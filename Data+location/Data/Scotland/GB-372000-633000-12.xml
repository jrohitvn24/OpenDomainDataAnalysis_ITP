		<title>12Farming in the Kelso Area</title>
		<content> Kelso is a good area for farming      
 because the ground is very{fertile    
 because of the river{Tweed}which runs 
 though Kelso. Most of the land is     
{arable}and the farmers don't keep many
 animals. The{main crop}is{barley}but  
 wheat, oilseed_rape, oats, potatoes,  
 turnips and grass are also grown. I   
 like oilseed_rape best because it     
 makes the countryside look attractive 
 because of its glowing yellow flowers.
 My dad sells chemicals like Tilt Turbo
 Slugkiller and many different kinds of
 weedkiller. I know farmers all over   
 the Borders because I go round the    
 farms with my dad in the holidays. I  
 like farm vehicles because they are   
 different from ordinary vehicles like 
 cars and motorbikes. My favourites are
 tractors and three and four wheeled   
 motorbikes which can pull spreading,  
 spraying and seeding machines.        </content>
