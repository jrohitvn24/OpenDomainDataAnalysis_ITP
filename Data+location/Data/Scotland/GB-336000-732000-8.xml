		<content> When parties go to the Water Services 
 Laboratories at{Clatto,}the station   
 superintendant explains how the system
 works.  The water supply for the whole
 of Dundee is purified there but the   
 water is no longer supplied from      
{Clatto Reservoir}as you might expect, 
 but from the Backwater Dam and from   
 Lintrathen Reservoir, both of which   
 are many miles from the city. Clatto  
 is held in reserve just in case the   
 city needs extra supply. The treatment
 plant was opened in 1972 and has a 20 
 million gallon capacity through two 6 
 million gallon tanks.  Water is even  
 pumped across the River Tay to Fife   
 through pipes which run under the road
 and rail bridges.  The water reaches  
 the plant in a fairly clean condition 
 only needing filtered to clear all    
 traces of peat and soil.  It is then  
 purified by chlorine to kill bacteria.</content>
