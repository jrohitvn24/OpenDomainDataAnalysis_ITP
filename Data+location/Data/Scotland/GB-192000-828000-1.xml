		<content> Two rivers run into the head of Loch  
 long.  The Ling seperates Cattadale   
 Estate from Killilan Estate and the   
 Elchaig seerates the killilan estate  
 from Inverinate Estate.  On the east  
 bank of the Ling stands the school and
 school house, not used because the    
 roll dropped to 5.  Killilan village  
 consists of 6 houses one lodge and a  
 hall.  Only 3 houses are occupied,    
 there was a post office but that      
 closed last month.  South of the      
 Elchaig is Camasluinie which consists 
 of 3 crofts run as a co-operative.    
 There are 6 houses, all of which are  
 lived in.  Sheep and cttle are farmed 
 and the little arable ground is       
 worked.  There is also hillgrazing and
 some uncultivated woodland.
