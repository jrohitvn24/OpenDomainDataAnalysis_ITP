		<title>06HIGH AND LOW PENNYVENIE-1</title>
		<content> High and Low Pennyvenie were two of   
 the rows of terraced cottages built by
 the mining company to house their     
 employees.  These rows stretched at   
 intervals for about two kilometres up 
 the Cummock Valley.  There were many  
 similar settlements elsewhere in the  
 Ayrshire coalfield.  Today of all the 
 houses only the row at Sighthill is   
 still tenanted.                       
                                       
 When we visited Pennyvenie Farm Mr    
 Ireland told us some of his memories  
 of the mining village which lay near  
 his farm.                             
                                       
 The villagers had a community hall    
 where dances and other social         
 activities were held. In summer       
 there was a Gala when a variety of    
 festivities took place including races
 and sometimes a band concert.         </content>
