		<content>   We spoke to two{policemen}about any 
 changes in crime which had occurred.  
 We asked them if there was more crime 
 in the eighties than the seventies and
 they both said that there was.We asked
 if it was because there were more     
 people or because more people were    
 turning to crime and they said that   
 both reasons were responsible.After   
 that we asked them if criminals were  
 younger or older than they used to    
 be. Again they agreed that they were  
 younger.Our next question was whether 
 any new crimes had appeared. They both
 said that{drug crimes}were new and one
 said there was a high rise in{glue    
{sniffing.}We asked them what was the  
 most common crime in this area.The    
 answer was{theft.}Our last question   
 was whether they thought offenders are
 properly punished.They both said      
 firmly{"No."                          </content>
