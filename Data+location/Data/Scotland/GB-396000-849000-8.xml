		<content>    My teacher, two fellow pupils and  
 myself, visited Mr. Ben Dalgarno the  
 local N.F.U (National Farmer's Union) 
 representative in connection with our 
 study on the local farming scene.     
    Mr. Dalgarno explained the         
 political side of farming in the area.
 For a number of years now, the farms  
 around Fetterangus have been bought up
 as an investment by the Coal Board's  
 pension fund and are run by one       
 farmer.  As a result there are fewer  
 self_run farms in this area than there
 were fifteen to twenty years ago.     
 Now, with machines taking over more   
 than half the work, fewer people are  
 needed at the farms.                  
    He further explained that farmers  
 can be seen to be economising in our  
 area, in other words trying to get    
 more produce out of their hectarage.
