		<title>13TRANSPORT:CALEDONIAN CANAL</title>
		<content>{THE CALEDONIAN CANAL}IS 60 MILES LONG,
 THIRTY EIGHT AND HALF MILES OF NATURAL
 LOCHS, TWENTY ONE AND HALF MILES OF   
 CANAL. IT RUNS ACROSS SCOTLAND FROM   
 CLACHNAHARRY ON THE INVERNESS FIRTH   
 THROUGH THE GREAT GLEN TO CORPACH. IT 
 WAS OPENED IN OCTOBER 1822. THOMAS    
 TELFORD WAS THE PRINCIPAL ENGINEER.   
 AT MUIRTOWN, A SUBURB OF INVERNESS    
 THERE IS A HYDRAULIC SWING BRIDGE     
 FOLLOWED BY 4 STAIRCASE LOCKS. THE    
 CANAL THEN PASSES THE CEMETERY NEAR   
 TOMNAHURICH BRIDGE. A JOURNEY BETWEEN 
 THESE BRIDGES WILL TAKE ABOUT ONE HOUR
 12MINUTES.THE CANAL IS OPEN 24HOURS A 
 DAY EXCEPT FOR 3 WEEKS EACH NOVEMBER  
 WHEN IT IS SHUT FOR REPAIR.EVERY      
 4YEARS THE WATER IS DRAINED TO CHECK  
 THE CANAL BED. MANY KINDS OF BOATS    
 PASS THROUGH THE CANAL BUT TODAY THERE
 ARE MORE PLEASURE CRUISERS THAN ANY   
 OTHER TYPE OF CRAFT.                  </content>
