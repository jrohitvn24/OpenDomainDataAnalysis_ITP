		<title>01Head of Loch Torridon</title>
		<content> The land around the head of Loch      
 Torridon consists of heathers covered 
 rugged hills. The highest point being 
 Beinn na h Eaglaise at 737m it is     
 estate land used for the grazing of   
 sheep and deer.                       
 The population of the small hamlet of 
 Annat is either retired or employed   
 at local land work. The Loch Torridon 
 Hotel is surrounded by woods of mainly
 conifers and is only  open during     
 summer tourist season. Adjacent to the
 Torridon Hotel is the Ben Damph public
 bar, which is also the local petrol   
 station (see barman to obtain petrol) 
 The Ben Damph is only public bar in   
 the area and therefore is used as a   
 meeting place for the outlying local  
 population as well as a haven during  
 bad weather for the many climbers who 
 visit the area to climb the high      
 mountains round Loch Torridons.       </content>
