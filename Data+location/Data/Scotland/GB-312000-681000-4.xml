		<title>04Inverkeithing Lammas Fair</title>
		<content> The oldest type of entertainment in   
 Inverkeithing is the{Lammas Fair.}As  
 far back as{1640,}and probably long   
 before, five fairs were held in the   
 Burgh. These fairs were attended by   
 vendors of all kinds of goods, and of 
 livestock, and they were also places  
 of entertainment. The burgh records of
 1652 says that the fair was a day for 
 "fun, frolic, fit races, ale, and     
 drunken folks, and gentel and simple. 
 Folks came from near and far to see   
 it." Formerly held on the 1st August, 
 it is now held on the first Thursday  
 of August and the following two days. 
                                       
 Nowadays, the Lammas Fair is a time of
 great celebration, with{fairground    
{rides in the High Street,}but there   
 are not so many stalls.
