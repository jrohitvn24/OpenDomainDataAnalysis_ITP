{Employment-}Fewer men are now employed
 on the land- 24 including farmers     
 themselves. Greater skills are now    
 required for the more complex         
 machinery in use. Most farmers use    
 outside contractors in varying degrees
 They are used for operations such as  
 hedge-cutting, ditching, repairing    
 fences and dykes, and less frequently 
 for silaging and combine harvesting.  
 Two foresters are employed on Cowhill 
 Estate.                               
{Weather problems-}1984 was disastrous-
 ly dry for the lighter land and in    
 complete contrast 1985 was disastrous-
 ly wet for all land with persistent   
 rain and wind. This year many         
 stackyards are littered with black    
 polythene bags of silage as farmers   
 tried to salvage hay and barley crops.
