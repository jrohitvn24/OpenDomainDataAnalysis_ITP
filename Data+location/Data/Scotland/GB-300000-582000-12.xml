		<title>12TINWALD TENNIS CLUB</title>
		<content>      Tinwald Tennis Club was          
 originally started in the 1960's with 
 the new court being thought of in     
 1979. Sir Hector Monro eventually     
 opened the new court on Friday the    
 22nd of May 1981.The club now has     
 thirty nine members-fifteen life      
 members, fifteen full members and nine
 junior members. The fees are Â£25.00   
 for life membership;Â£5.00 per year for
 an adult and Â£2.50 anually per child. 
 The club is extremely fortunate in    
 that it has an all year round surface 
 - one of only two in the country. As  
 well as club members, the court is    
 used by tourists and Amisfield school 
 children.It has a c'ttee of seven     
 members and raises money purely for   
 the upkeep of the court and to pay a  
 rent to the Tinwald Hall Committee on 
 whose ground the court stands.
