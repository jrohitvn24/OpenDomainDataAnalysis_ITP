{Bellfield}and the{Parish Church}in    
{Shortlees.}The Church of Scotland     
 believes that there is one God created
 for the Universe and that Jesus came  
 to show people what God was really    
 like, and the way God wanted us to    
 live.{St.Ninians}began in{Bellfield   
{House in 1955.}Then they decided to   
 build their own church which was      
{opened in 1959.}Both St.Ninians and   
 Shortlees Parish are reasonably       
 attended, with an average total       
 congregation of around 240 although   
 there are over 600 members in         
 St.Ninians alone. St.Ninians and
