		<title>07HOTELS IN GLENLIVET</title>
		<content>   There  are two  beautiful  hotels in
 Glenlivet:  Minmore   and   Blairfindy
 Lodge.                                
  {Minmore hotel }used  to be  the farm
 house where the owner of The Glenlivet
 Distillery  stayed. As each new  bride
 took up  residence, the  house  took a
 bashing as it was altered to her taste
 hence  its  present  shape  and  size.
 Shooting,    fishing,    and    skiing
 facilities  are  availabvle as well as
 excellent quisine  or a quiet drink in
 the bar.                              
  {Blairfindy Lodge Hotel }also  caters
 for    the   sporting   and   business
 clientele. The  Dukes of Richmond  and
 Gordon   built  this   building  as  a
 shooting lodge, and  it  still  served
 this purpose  when  taken  over by the
 Crown   Estate  Commissioners  earlier
 this century. It became a  hotel  when
 it was no longer required by shooters.</content>
