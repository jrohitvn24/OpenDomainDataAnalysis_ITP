		<content> Football is very popular with         
 youngsters especially boys.  There are
 school football teams and youth club  
 teams.  Most schools in the area have 
 football teams, netball teams for     
 girls, and athletics for both boys and
 girls.  Golf is probably the next most
 popular sport.  There is one golf     
 course in this area, called Whinhill. 
 Although both men and women play golf,
 in the East End of Greenock it is     
 mostly men and youths who play.       
 Jogging is becoming more popular and 2
 or 3 marathons are held in the        
 area. There is the Cue Ball Snooker   
 Club which you can join when you are  
 18 and which has 28 tables.  Many old 
 age pensioners of both sexes spend    
 their leisure time playing bowls.     
 There are several bowling greens and  
 recently a new indoor bowling green   
 was opened.                           </content>
