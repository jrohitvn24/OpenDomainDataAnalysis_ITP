		<title>02Farming around Johnstone</title>
		<content> The bulk of the farming around        
 Johnstone is centered on beef         
 production with some sheep and a      
 dairy.Most produce is sold locally at 
 Paisley market and the milk goes to   
 the Milk Marketing Board.Most crops   
 grown in the area are used for winter 
 feeding for the livestock although a  
 lot still has to be bought in.        
 The introduction of milk quotas in    
 1984 is still a cause of great concern
 in the farming community. Having been 
 encouraged to produce more milk by    
 cash rewards the EEC has now          
 introduced quotas to restrict milk    
 production, and this threat now looms 
 over other sectors of farming.
