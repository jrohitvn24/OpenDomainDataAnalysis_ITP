		<title>01Southern Isle of Luing</title>
		<content> The island of Luing lies off the coast
 of Argyll and is about 9km N to S and 
 3KM E to W. It is low lying max height
 in this southern half is 85m. The     
 ground is mainly rough moorland,with  
 wetlands round the only loch, used as 
 the islands water supply.  Some areas 
 have been draind and are used for     
 growing animal feedstuff,to cater for 
 the large number of cattle and sheep  
 reared here.  This is the home of the 
 Luing breed of beef cattle. The main  
 employment is in the farm of Ardlarch 
 which has extended to cover almost    
 the whole of Luing. The coast line is 
 rocky with muddy bays and inlets. The 
 coastal waters are fished for lobsters
 prawns, scallops and salmon.Apart from
 a small number at Black Mill Bay most 
 people live in Toberorochy in the SE. 
 A small number find self employment or
 travel to Oban (20 miles) for work.   </content>
