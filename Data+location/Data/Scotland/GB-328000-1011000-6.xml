		<content> Our area lies on the edge of important
 peat deposits and most families cut   
 peat.Each family has its separate peat
 bank for which they pay the hill owner
 about Â£5 yearly.Farmers own their own 
 banks. First the heather is removed   
 from the top of the bank. This is     
 called 'flaying'and a special big     
 knife is used for this purpose. Of the
 two people needed to cut peat,one uses
 a special tool called a'tusker' to    
 slice off the peat and his helper     
 lifts out the peat with a fork and    
 stacks it on the bank. Soon the peats 
 are spread out flat on the heather to 
 dry.Two weeks later they are raised   
 into little heaps. When they are dry  
 enough they are carted home.Some      
 people are experimenting with special 
 peat cutting machines which produce   
 peat by squeezing them out through    
 holes with hydraulic rams.            </content>
