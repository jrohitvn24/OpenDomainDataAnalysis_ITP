		<content> Because of the oil industry there are 
 many people moving into Midmar.These  
 people have more money and more cars  
 so shops have closed because people   
 can drive into town and get a better  
 selection of goods at lower prices.At 
 one time there were very few people in
 the school but now the school has     
 expanded.Twenty years ago the school  
 was rebuilt.Four years ago the school 
 was extended further.With the         
 discovery of oil there came other     
 changes.Lots of children came from far
 away and allhad different backgrounds,
 experiences and education.With the new
 children came new dialects replacing  
 the old Doric accent but some people  
 still speak that way.With changing    
 times came new equipment mainly audio-
 visual like videos, computers, tape   
 recorders and a listening centre.
