		<content> Most of our area is farmland,the main 
 crop being grass which is used for    
 grazing cattle.Some of the grass is   
 cut for hay or silage.                
 One third of our land cover is        
 sea-part of the Solway Firth,noted for
 its salmon and its dangerous fast     
 flowing tides.{                       
 The {A75}trunk road and the main      
 Carlisle to Glasgow railway line pass 
 through our block.The {A75}is very    
 heavily used with many large lorries  
 travelling from the ferry from        
 Stranraer to Northern Ireland.A       
 by-pass is being planned to divert    
 most heavy traffic.The eastern corner 
 of Annan and the village of Dornock   
 are residential areas.Other           
 interesting features include the      
 pipeline from Chapelcross,a BMX cycle 
 track,a sports field,a school and a   
 home for old people.                  </content>
