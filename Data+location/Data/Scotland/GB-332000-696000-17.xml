		<title>17Coast - The Ghost</title>
		<content> At one time, Macduff's Castle was     
 supposed to have been haunted by the  
 White Lady of the Court Cave. The     
 White Lady is reputed to be the ghost 
 of a West Fife laird who deserted her 
 home and joined a band of gypsies,    
 having fallen in love with one of     
 them. Convicted on false evidence on a
 charge of stealing some fruit, she was
 sentenced to be whipped. She was so   
 ashamed she died from a brocken heart.
 The gypsies, who at that time         
 inhabited the Court Cave, quarrelled  
 over her conviction. While they argued
 a female clad in white suddenly       
 appeared. The ghost of the White Lady 
 was said to haunt the gypsies until   
 the real theif confessed and even     
 after that she was supposed to have   
 made occasional appearances in the    
 grounds of the castle and the caves.
