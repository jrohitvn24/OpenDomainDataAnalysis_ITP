		<title>04THE BARONY OF FINZEAN.</title>
		<content> In 1708 barony rights were granted to 
 the laird of Finzean,in respect of the
 lands of Finzean,Balnaboth, Balnahard,
 Dalsack,Percie,Woodend,Balfiddy,      
 Tillygarmont,Whitestone and the Mill  
 of Clenter.Farms exist of these names 
 today but Balnaboth, Dalsack and      
 Woodend have been incorporated into   
 Finzean Home farm and neighbouring    
{farms,larger units being more         
{economically viable.}                 
 The charter carried with it important 
{salmon fishing rights}on the River Dee
 which are still effective and have    
 been tested in court.                 
 The barony is still intact although   
 some small pieces of ground have been 
 fued since the estate was disentailed 
 in 1935.                              
 The family coat of arms still bears   
 the insignia  of the{feudal}baron.
