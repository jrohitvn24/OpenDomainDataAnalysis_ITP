		<title>04THE ROSEBERYS (cont)</title>
		<content>  Part of Hannah's dowry was{Mentmore  
{Towers}in Buckinghamshire.However,    
 after only twelve years of marriage   
 Hannah died of typhoid at Dalmeny.    
  Archibald, the 5th Earl, owned three 
 Derby winners, was wealthy,eloquent   
 and popular so he seemed a natural    
 successor to{Gladstone.}However, his  
 administration was shortlived and     
 unremarkable.His only significant act 
 was the introduction of death duties. 
 Ironically this tax would cause the   
 Roseberys to lose Mentmore almost a   
 century later.The 5th Earl died in    
 1928 leaving as his legacy seven      
 houses, a fabulous art collection, a  
 large collection of{Napoleon          
 memorabilia and a definitive biography
 of Napoleon. (next page)
