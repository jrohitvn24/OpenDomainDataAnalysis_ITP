		<content> THE OIL AND WHAT IT DID TO OUR AREA.  
 The most important event in the past  
 few years was the construction and the
 development of Sullom Voe Oil         
 Terminal.Although the terminal is     
 outside our area it has meant a great 
 change in our environment and life.   
 A whole new housing estate was built  
 in Brae to house people moving into   
 the area to work at Sullom Voe.People 
 have come into our area from all over 
 Shetland and other parts of the       
 country.This has meant a rise in      
 population and school roles.New roads 
 have been built to deal with the      
 increase in traffic through our area. 
 There has been a rise in the standard 
 of living,with both incomers and      
  locals earning large wages at the    
 terminal.Two new schools have been    
 built to deal with the rise in school 
 roles.                                </content>
