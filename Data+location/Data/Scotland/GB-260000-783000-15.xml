		<title>15FARMING - DEER</title>
		<content> Ptramigan of the grouse family are    
 never seen below 3,000feet and are    
 plentiful unlike the grouse, which are
 very scarce. The red deers' antlers   
 are like rubber and bend. The blood   
 supply is cut off and they go hard and
 the velvet rubs off in preparation for
 the rutting season in September.      
 August.The ponies are shod by the     
 local blacksmith from Fort William for
 walking on the hard tracks for 10-15  
 miles a day during the stalking       
 season. The stags develop a voice,    
 hormones, and roar around the hills   
 challenging each other and rounding up
 groups of females in fluctuating      
 numbers between 3 and 30. Many        
 foreigners come for the sport of deer 
 stalking and pay Â£100-Â£150 a day to   
 shoot 1 stag but they do not get the  
 carcase to keep.
