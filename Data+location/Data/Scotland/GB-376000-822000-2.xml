		<content> Most of our block is farming land,so  
 that there are few houses there.The   
 only built up areas are in the south  
 west ;the most northerly part of      
 Inverurie.To the west of the A96 are  
 the Brandsbutt council estate and     
 several privately developed estates.  
  Brandsbutt houses are built of       
 pre-cast concrete panels surrounding  
 a timber frame.Both roof and outside  
 walls of the upper storey are covered 
 with tiles.The roofs are flat.The     
 private estates were built using      
 kit-houses,most of which are detached 
 or semi-detached.                     
  The oldest houses in our block are   
 built of stone and lime or granite and
 were built during the 19th century    
 following the original linear         
 development of the town.
