		<title>18THE FISH FACTORY</title>
		<content> THE BURRA FISH FACTORY HAS BEEN HERE  
 FOURTEEN YEARS.WE WENT TO THE BOSS OF 
 THE FISH FACTORY AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T
 LIKE THE SMELL VERY MUCH.EACH DAY THEY
 WORK TEN HOURS.THE MOST POPULAR FISH  
 THAT THEY GET IS THE HADDOCK.THE LAST 
 PERSON TO GO OUT OF THE FACTORY GOES  
 OUT AT FIVE O,CLOCK EACH NIGHT.A MAN  
 CALLED A.J.HENRY OWNED IT FIRST.THEY  
 HAVE THIRTEEN FILLETERS,SIX PACKERS   
 AND THERE ARE TWENTY THREE PEOPLE     
 WORKING IN THE FACTORY.THE FACTORY IS 
 PLACED ABOUT SIXTY YARDS AWAY FROM THE
 BURRA BRIDGE AT EASTERDALE.THE OTHER  
 FISH THEY DEAL WITH ARE WHITING,COD   
 AND SAND EELS. ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO  
 WORK THERE ARE FROM BURRA BUT THE BOSS
 IS A MAN FROM SCALLOWAY.A BONUS FROM  
 WORKING IN THE FISH FACTORY IS THAT   
 YOU GET A FREE FRY OF FISH .
