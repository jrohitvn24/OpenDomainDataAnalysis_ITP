 To play you need three or more players
 and a length of rope.You need a person
 to hold each end of the rope,they turn
 the rope by rotating their arms in a  
 wide circle and they must keep time   
 with one another,this is called       
 cawing.The other people jump in the   
 ropes one at a time and jump until    
 they stop the rope and have to take   
 their turn on the end.                
{Hide'n'go seek                        
 To play this you need at least 2      
 people.One person goes'it' and has to 
 hide his eyes and count to 100 while  
 the other players hide.Once 'it' has  
 counted to 100 they go and seek the   
 others the first person to be found is
 'it' next time.While 'it'seeks the    
 others can try to get back to the     
 place where 'it'counted before being  
 caught,this place is called the den.  </content>
