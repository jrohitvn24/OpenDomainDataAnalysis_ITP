		<title>11Housing in Linwood.</title>
		<content> We went to the{Clippens shops}to do a 
 survey on housing in{Linwood}.We did  
 this  to find out what people thought 
 of the houses in Linwood.The houses   
 in the{North Clippens}area of Linwood 
 were built about{20 years ago}and are 
 owned by the local council.           
 Of the 12 people asked 4 lived in     
 flats ,3 lived in terraces,4 lived in 
 semi_detached and 1 lived in a        
 detached house.4 people have lived    
 here less than 10 years,4 between 10  
 and 20 years and 4 for more than 20   
 years.                                
 Most people were satisfied with their 
 accomodation.This was because the     
 houses are in good condition,have     
 enough room and are in a nice area.   
 Those people who were not satisfied   
 said that the houses were old and     
 damp.                                 
                                       </content>
