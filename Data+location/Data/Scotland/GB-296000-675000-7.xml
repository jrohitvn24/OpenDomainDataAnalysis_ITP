		<title>07Changes in Linlithgow.</title>
		<content>   Work in Linlithgow has diminished   
 over the years with Spences and other 
 tanneries closing down just after     
 World War II.The closing of the glue  
 factory,shoe factories,breweries and  
 quite recently the paper mill has     
 resulted in only a very small         
 percentage of Linlithgow's population 
 being employed in the town.Linlithgow 
 is now a commuter town.Its road and   
 rail links provide easy access to main
 towns.                                
   Communications in Linlithgow have   
 not changed much over the years.The   
 motorway has taken the heaviest       
 traffic from the town but has had an  
 adverse effect on trade.Train services
 have become less frequent since the   
 war.                                  
   Changes in Linlithgow over the years
 have resulted in the town losing much 
 of its spirit.                        </content>
