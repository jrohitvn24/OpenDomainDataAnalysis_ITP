		<title>16STORNOWAY S. GATHERING PEATS</title>
		<content> A DAY AT THE PEATS: I was woken at    
 about 7.30 am, put on my old jeans,   
 thick jumper, boban socks and wellies.
 After breakfast my mother, father and 
 I drove the 8 miles to Gress where my 
 Granny had made a little picnic. My   
 uncle and cousins were coming up as   
 well. We then drove up the Tolsta     
 road. When we got to the peat banks   
 all the adults waited for the tractor 
 to come. (Weeks before the peat had   
 been cut and then turned to dry). When
 the tractor came they sterted filling 
 the trailer. (Peat is like hardened   
 mud but will easily crumble in your   
 hands). When the trailer was full the 
 driver took it back to my Granny's,   
 tipped out the peats and went back for
 more. Meanwhile my grandpa was        
 stacking the peats near the house for 
 use in the winter. At the end of the  
 day we all had a big meal at Granny's.</content>
