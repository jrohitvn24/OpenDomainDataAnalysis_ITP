 48k with 7.Secondly was the Commodore 
 64 with 3.Then the Vic 20 with 2 and  
 the BBC,Apple,Sharp and the ZX81 all  
 got 1.6 people could write there own  
 programs and between them they have   
 written 30 games.Nobody had a disk    
 drive.All 16 people had a cassette    
 recorder.6 people had a joystick(and  
 interface)two people had a printer and
 2 people had a built in monitor.In    
 Rafford a mobile library comes round  
 to some areas.It either comes weekly  
 or fortnightly .The van comes to only 
 18 houses out of 41.16 more people    
 prefer to use Forres library than the 
 mobile library.The voters roll of the 
 area is kept in the community centre, 
 while information on buildings        
 is kept at the Forres Archives.       </content>
