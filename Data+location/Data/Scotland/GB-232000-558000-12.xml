		<title>12GAMES PLAYED AT KIRKCOWAN</title>
		<content> We play many types of{chasing games}at
 school such as TV Tiggy,Line          
 Tiggy,Shadow Tiggy and Shepherd's     
 Pie.Here is how to play Underground   
 Tiggy.To select the catchers or{Tigger
 and{Guard}we put our feet in a circle 
 and say a rhyme  such as:-            
 "Mickey Mouse built a house,          
 You are not IT."                      
 The last two are IT.The people caught 
 by TIGGER stand with one hand against 
 the wall, gaurded by the GUARD        
 until freed by another player who runs
 under the arm to do so without being  
 caught himself.The running under the  
 arm gives the game its name.Other     
 names for this game is Scarecrow      
 Tiggy and Stick in the Mud.           
 Chain Tiggy is another chasing game   
 where the catchers join hands.
