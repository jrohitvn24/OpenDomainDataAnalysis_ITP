 In the{local hotels}you can get a job 
 as a waitress,though you have to be 14
 or over.You get paid quite a lot but  
 you have to work quite hard.          
                                       
 There is a {Youth Training Scheme}at  
 the Community Centre which tries to   
 get young people jobs.Most teenagers  
 work with the scheme for six months or
 so and then end up in long-term       
 unemployment.                         
                                       
 Since West Kilbride is a predominantly
{middle class community,}most parents  
 insist that their children try to go  
 on to higher education. Subsequently, 
 many people in the village are        
 employed in the professions.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
