		<content>                                       
 The farm employs 4 full-time workers. 
 A farm manager, a shepherd, a tractor 
 driver and a general farm worker. The 
 farm extends all over the island. The 
 farm has 1000 ewes, mainly black face 
 and cheviots, and a herd of 30        
 Highland Cattle. The farm makes its   
 profit from the sale of beasts in the 
 autumn so therefore the farm work     
 revolves around the animals. Hay and  
 oats are grown for winter fodder and  
 concentrates are brought in. Although 
 the farm is becoming increasingly     
 mechanised traditional methods of     
 stooking and stacking are still seen  
 on the island. Potatoes are also grown
 for home consumption. Sheep are very  
 time consuming and there are always   
 dry stone dykes and fences to be      
 maintained so the farm workers are    
 never idle!                           </content>
