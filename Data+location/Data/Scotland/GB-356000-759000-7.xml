		<content>{Brechin Cathedral}is over{750}years   
 old and next to it stands the even    
 older 10th century{Round Tower,       
 originally built as a defensive point 
 by{Celtic}monks.   Both buildings are 
 of local{Old Red Sandstone}and are the
 best known buildings in the town.     
 The present minister estimated that   
 some{6000}people visit each year      
 making the buildings a major tourist  
 attraction.   Visits are made by      
 Britons and tourists from Europe,     
 North America and Australia.   Most   
 are interested in the ancient relics  
 in the cathedral.   These include     
 silver goblets of Viking age,         
 communion trays and an early Christian
{Standing Stone.}  The stained glass   
 windows, depicting scenes from the    
 Bible, are another major attraction.
