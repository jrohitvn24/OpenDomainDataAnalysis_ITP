		<title>20CHIEF SCOUTS VISIT TO THURSO</title>
		<content>   On Friday 14th June 1985{Chief Scout
{Major General Michael Walsh}landed in 
 a field near our school by helicopter.
 All Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Venture 
 Scouts in{Caithness}were assembled for
 his visit.                            
  For the Scouts there were 8 different
 bases to try out their various skills.
 At one base we made dough into twists 
 and cooked them over a barbecue. We   
 could also roast apples. Other bases  
 included the cannon race, amateur     
 radio, dry ski slope, abseiling, army 
 assault course and leather branding.  
  The previous evening each Scout troop
 competed in building a gate for their 
 camp. We built a portcullis and were  
 awarded second prize.                 
  The highlight of the day was the     
 presentation of the Chief Scout's     
 award to five scouts, four of whom are
 in our troop which is 1st Thurso.     </content>
