		<content> In the old days the cattle were       
 stabled in the byre next to the living
 area with just a door between.  There 
 was no inside toilet until recently,  
 just an earth closet near the stream  
 at the back of the house.  The        
 neighbouring farmer can still remember
 seeing that toilet when he was a boy. 
 His father used to own our house.     
                                       
                                       
 It can be very cold in winter and our 
 water supply sometimes freezes up.    
 Ours is a private water pipe from a   
 collecting tank on the hill behind us 
 which is fed from a spring.  We get a 
 lot of snow, often more than a metre  
 deep.  Then we have to walk to the    
 road to meet our school taxi as we    
 cannot get our car along the track    
 from our house.
