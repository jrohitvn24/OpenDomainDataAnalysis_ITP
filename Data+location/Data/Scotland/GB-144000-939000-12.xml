		<title>12STORNOWAY TRUST</title>
		<content> Lord Leverhulme of Lever Brothers of  
 Port Sunlight-the Soap Manufacturers- 
 bought the Isle-of-Lewis on 15th May  
 1918.                                 
     In 1923 he donated the Parish of  
 Stornoway- of which this area is a    
 part- as a free gift to its           
 inhabitants.On his instructions the   
 Stornoway Trust was set up to         
 administer the Stornoway Trust Estate.
 Ten trustees who must be resident rate
 payers of the parish are appointed by 
 election to serve a four year         
 term.Only rate payers out of a parish 
 population of 10,000 have the right to
 vote in Trust elections               
     The day to day running of the     
 estate is carried out by a factor or  
 his office staff.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
