		<content>         There is a variety of factor- 
ies in our area, large and small. The  
Caterpillar factory is one of the bigg-
est under one roof in the country and  
makes earth-movers,some with large wh- 
eels some with tank-tracks. It has     
1,500 workers but used to have many    
more. The Main Tool Co. makes          
precision tools to use in other        
factories. A smaller works does        
welding jobs. There is a large cement  
works with a rail line running into    
it where their wagons are loaded up.   
We also have a shoe factory and a      
place where wooden huts and garages    
are made.                              
        Nearby is a large industrial   
estate with mostly stores and works'   
offices. Many container-lorries        
come and go and there is also a        
transport depot with large vans.
