		<content>{Hay racks}In a few days, when the hay 
 is dry it is taken off and stored away
 either in a shed or made into         
 haystacks. The process is then        
 repeated until all the grass has been 
 harvested. The hay is used throughout 
 the winter to feed the cow and sheep. 
{Vegetables}for consumption in the home
 are also grown in lazy beds. These    
 include lettuces, cabbages, onions,   
 carrots, turnips, beetroot and        
 parsnips.                             
{Corn}Again the seed is sown in lazy   
 beds. The soil is turned over by spade
 and then the seed and fertiliser is   
 spread by hand and the ground raked.  
 In the Autumn the corn is cut with a  
 scythe and then tied into sheaves and 
 6 or 7 of these sheaves are then      
 stacked together. After a few days of 
 drying all the sheaves are gathered   
 into large cornstacks.                </content>
