		<title>05A MORNING IN LOSSIEMOUTH</title>
		<content>   "Wakey Wakey", my mum shouts. I     
 don't want to get up. Reluctantly I go
 downstairs and start putting on my    
 clothes. My sister looks as if        
 she's still asleep. A hot roll and a  
 drink does me fine for my breakfast. I
 put my playpiece in my schoolbag and  
 wait for my grandad to come and take  
 us to school. It pleases him to do    
 this ( I think ).                     
   As I arrive at school the bell      
 rings. Everyone rushes to their lines,
 well, to tell the truth it's more like
 a slow plod. We work until ten to one 
 with a playtime in between. I run all 
 the way home because I am starving.   
 Well, dinner over and back to school  
 to do more gruelling work.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
