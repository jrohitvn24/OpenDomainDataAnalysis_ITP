		<title>06A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MARIE</title>
		<content> My name is Marie and I am fourteen    
 years of age. I stay in the country, 3
 miles from{Banchory.}I stay with my   
 father, who is a director of his own  
 building company, and my mother who   
 works as a nurse at the local old     
 folks home.                           
 We stay not far from{Crathes Castle}  
 where I work as a waitress in the     
 restaurant of the new{Visitors Centre}
 in the summer holidays and every      
 weekend from{May}to{September.}       
 Each Saturday morning I get up at     
 about 10 o'clock, wash my hair and    
 have breakfast of cornflakes, toast   
 and tea. After breakfast I tidy my    
 room and get dressed _ I have to wear 
 a white blouse and black skirt.       
 My mother takes me in the car to the  
 castle in time for me to start work at
 12 o'clock.                           
                                       </content>
