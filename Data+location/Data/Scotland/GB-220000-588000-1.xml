 The land consists of cultivated grass 
 rotating with cereals. The latter     
 being barley or oats. Until 15-20 yrs 
 ago, farming was mainly dairy with a  
 few sheep. Currently there are only   
 beef, producing cattle and a large    
 increase in sheep flocks Through grids
 1,2,3 and 5 passes the River Stinchar 
 en route to Firth of Clyde. It has a  
 large peat residue and popular salmon 
 and trout fishing, also brown trout.  
 Fishing rights are leased by          
 indivuduals from the Crown            
 Commissioners, Edinburgh.  There are  
 small pockets of woodlands, mostly    
 well established confiers. In grid  11
 exists a five year old plantation, in 
 grid 1, 5 acres are being planted     
 with beech and oak.  Local amenities  
 are none. TV reception is poor being  
 obtainable only from Ulster.          </content>
