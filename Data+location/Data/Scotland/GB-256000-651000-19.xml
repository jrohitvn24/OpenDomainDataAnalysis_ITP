{Wildlife in Eaglesham}                
 We have studied six different habitat 
 types:Moorland,Loch,Riverside,Agricul 
 tural,Woodland and garden.We found    
 that although the different animals   
 and birds live in separate habitats   
 there is a gradual change as one      
 habitat merges into another.Thus we   
 found woodland birds in bushes round  
 lochs and field borders. We also found
 evidence of change of land use.clumps 
 of wood anemones in woodland showed it
 had once been woodland.The Wildlife   
 Trust has an Eaglesham branch..... _  </content>
