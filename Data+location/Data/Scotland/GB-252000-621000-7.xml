 profoundly handicapped  children

   After leaving Easton Place the      
 children have the option of attending 
 the Adult Training Centre in          
 Auchinleck. Here they are taught basic
 life skills such as  making a cup of  
 tea, also handcrafts like basket      
 making.There are 5 instructors and up 
 to 54 places available.This centre has
 no upper age limit.                   
   Within the village a council house  
 is kept as a 'half-way house' for a   
 small group of handicapped people,    
 that is,a house where they can learn  
 to become independent within the      
 community but still remain under the  
 watchful eye of the social services.
