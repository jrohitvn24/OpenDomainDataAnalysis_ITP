		<title>08Penkill Castle</title>
		<content>  Penkill Castle was built in{1470 A.D.
 just after the reign of {Robert the   
{Bruce.} It was a Scot's keep,with the 
 door about halfway up the wall and the
 only way in was by rope.On three sides
 of the castle the ground drops down   
 steeply which was good for defence.The
 only side that you could attack from  
 was the front entrance and that was   
 well defended because of small slits  
 in the walls from which  archers shot 
 their arrows.                         
  The old part of the castle has three 
 wings,and a tower was built in{1857}to
 join the wings.There is a stone statue
 of an{owl which is about two feet tall
 sitting on the roof of the banquet    
 hall and there are more inside.These  
 are known as the castles symbols.
