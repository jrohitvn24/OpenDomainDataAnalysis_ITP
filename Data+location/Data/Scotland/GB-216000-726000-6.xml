		<title>06TYPICAL VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content> Village life, as anywhere is very     
 different to town life. Dalmally is a 
 typical Scottish village in this      
 sense. Villages exsistence and        
 wellbeing depends initially on        
 employment. In this village the main  
 sources of employment are, forestry   
 -both  Forestry Commision and Economic
 Forestry,British Rail to maintain and 
 run the Oban-Glasgow line,Hydro       
 Electirc power station at             
 Cruachan,service industry,tourist     
 industry and farming.                 
   Most secondary and tertiary services
 are provided for us from our nearest  
 large town,Oban.                      
  Unemployment at this time is a       
 problem nationally at the             
 moment,Dalmally suffers in that many  
 young people move away from the area  
 to find work therefore the population 
 is lessening.                         </content>
