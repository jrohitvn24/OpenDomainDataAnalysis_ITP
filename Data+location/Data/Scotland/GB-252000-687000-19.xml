		<title>19LANDSCAPE IN BALFRON AREA</title>
		<content>    The{landscape}in the Balfron area  
 is dominated by hills- to the South by
 the glaciated, grass-covered{Campsie  
{Fells}with their distinctive corries, 
 and to the North and West by the more 
 mountainous Highlands.                
    Hidden from the village by trees,  
 the River Endrick flows from East to  
 West through the area on its way to   
 Loch Lomond. In fact, the area is     
 characterised by the many{trees}which 
 border the narrow, twisting roads and 
 pervade the grasslands of the farms   
 and estates.                          
    The village of Balfron is spread   
 out over the slope with a pleasing    
 blend of old and{new buildings.}The   
 local red sandstone has been used for 
 the{older buildings}and this contrasts
 well with the many white-painted      
 buildings. The overall scene is one of
 unspoilt rural tranquility.           </content>
