		<title>11A BURNT MOUND IN EDAY</title>
		<content>    Eday has many sites of             
 archaeological interest, including    
 some Burnt Mounds, one of which is    
 situated on the extreme west of the   
 island, just south of Fersness Point. 
    It is of roughly horse shoe shape  
 and measures 10.67m in diameter and   
 1.37m at its greatest height.         
    At the north side of the mound     
 there are several protruding slabs set
 on edge, all aligned north and south. 
 These probably represent the house    
 associated with the mound.            
    A drainage ditch has been dug on   
 the north side of this mound and      
 unfortunately this has made it rather 
 difficult to see, with earth piled on 
 top of it.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
