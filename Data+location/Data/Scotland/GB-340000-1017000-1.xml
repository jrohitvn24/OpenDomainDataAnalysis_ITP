		<title>01Grass Crofts and Sea</title>
		<content> Low hills slope broadly down to the   
 sea.In the summer the grass fields are
 alive with cattle, in the winter only 
 the curlew and a handful of sheep     
 occupy this largely empty area. The   
 cattle have been sold or are wintering
 in byres.                             
 About every fifth field stands a      
 dwelling, many that are still         
 inhabited are modern. Only a few of   
 the numerous crofts are lived in, most
 decay or store hay. Those that are    
 inhabited belong to an incoming class 
 of people who earn their living not   
 from the land, but by tourism which is
 on the increase or work which permits 
 them to be distant from their source  
 of income i.e. writng,painting etc.   
 Overall, the dominant force is nature,
 its furious winds long and short      
 seasonsal days and swiftly changing   
 drama.Its sea &amp; sky that's sovereign. </content>
