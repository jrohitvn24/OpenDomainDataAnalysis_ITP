		<content>{Shapinsay}is an island in the centre  
 of Orkney just off the north coast of 
 Scotland in northern Britain. This    
 section is practically in the centre  
 of the island and is typical of most  
 of it. Dotted here and there, are     
{farmhouses}with surrounding farmlands.
 Most of the farmers breed cattle. They
 rear calves which are sold at about   
 two years old. The farmland is very   
{fertile,}and even in winter the fields
 are  bright green.                    
 Unlike other islands in Orkney the    
 former landlord divided out the land  
 very evenly, so the fields are a      
 uniform size.{Farming}methods are     
 progressive. The average size of a    
 farm is 80 to 90 acres. At the present
 time many of the smallest farms have  
 been swallowed up into existing       
 farms.Now there are fewer families.   
 The population is decreasing.         </content>
