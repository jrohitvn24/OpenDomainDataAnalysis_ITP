		<title>08The Abandoned Graveyard</title>
		<content> As our group walked along the main    
 road to Screel we noticed a small     
 churchyard beside Kirkland farm.      
 The church has very little remains. It
 was on the west side of the churchyard
 on a hill. There are yew trees in the 
 churchyard. It looks like the grass   
 never gets cut although we found out  
 that council workers came some times. 
 The newest grave was put in on 9th    
 November 1978. The oldest grave was   
 put in, in 1751.                      
 There are 30 graves and two of them   
 are broken. The man's name who has    
 recently died is Simon Andrew         
 Phillpotts.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
