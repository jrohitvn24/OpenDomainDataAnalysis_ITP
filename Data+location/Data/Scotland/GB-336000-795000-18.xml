		<title>18CRAIG COILLICH POND PROJECT</title>
		<content> The project which involved the        
 reclamation of a small pond on the out
 skirts of Ballater was the Field      
 Centre's contribution to the Council  
 of Europe's Campaign on The Water's   
 Edge, 1984. Funding for the project   
 was received from The Prince's Trust  
 and permission was kindly given by the
 Factor of Glen Muick Estate. The work 
 was undertaken by Centre staff and a  
 group of young volunteers during the  
 first week of the summer holidays 1984
 The work involved the removal of      
 litter and vegetation, the            
 construction of a rigid sampling      
 platform and a walkway across the     
 fragile pond margins. A Certificate of
 Merit was received for this work. The 
 pond is now the focus of the Centre's 
 unit of study on Freshwater habitats. 
 Maintainance of the pond environs is  
 undertaken by Centre staff.           </content>
