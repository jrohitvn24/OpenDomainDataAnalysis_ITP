		<content> Tomintoul School caters for both      
 Primary and Secondary Pupils.         
 Secondary Pupils undertake a 4 year   
 course after which they transfer to   
 Speyside High School, Aberlour.       
 The original school was built towards 
 the end of last century.  In August   
 l985, at the end of summer holidays we
 are moving into our new school.  Work 
 on the new building commenced in      
 November l984.  A section of the old  
 school consisting of canteen, gym and 
 two classrooms will be retained.      
 The new school is situated behind the 
 old school on the west side of        
 Tomnabat Lane.  The new school will   
 have modern facilities and will       
 provide a pleasant environment.
