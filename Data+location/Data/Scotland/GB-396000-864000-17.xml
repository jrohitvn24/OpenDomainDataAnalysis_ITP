{Service}was{started in 1977}at a      
 public meeting, and with training     
 arranged by the Workers Education     
 Service.                              
   The Service is now manned by a{rota 
{of 12 volunteers}on two mornings and  
 one evening per week , plus a         
{fortnightly legal clinic.             
   The volunteers offer{free           
{confidential advice}on any subject,   
 often helping clients in their        
 dealings with local and central       
 government agencies.                  
   The service has helped many hundreds
 of people with their problems over the
 years and its existence has influenced
 people to open similar services in    
 other locations in the north-east of  
 Scotland.
