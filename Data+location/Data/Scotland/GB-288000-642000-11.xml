		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content>{Farming }has always played an         
 important part in the economy of the  
 area around Lanark.This can be seen   
 quite clearly in the sucess of {Lanark
{Market},which is patronized not only  
 by border farmers ,but by farmers from
 as far away as Ireland and the South  
 of England.The Irish tend to be       
 interested in the implement           
 sales,whereas the farmers from the    
 South of England are more interested  
 in buying lambs towards the end of the
 summer.A visit to {Lanark Market }is  
 also popular with people out for a run
 in the country.Lanark is also an      
 important centre for the marketing of 
 the tomatoes and fruit from the {Clyde
{Valley.}Finally a look at a map will  
 show the reason why Lanark has always 
 been an important centre              
 agriculturally.
