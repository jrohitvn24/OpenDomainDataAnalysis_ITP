		<content> Aith is a small village with a number 
 of houses clustered around the head of
 a voe (a narrow inlet of the sea) and 
 the others scattered around the       
 surrounding area. There are low hills 
 around the voe. Aith is not on a main 
 road but on a road which connests the 
 main road west with the main road     
 north. There is a second small        
 community in the east of the block    
 called East Burrafirth. East          
 Burrafirth is a small inlet of the sea
 from Aith Voe and the 9 houses are    
 scattered around this. Aith is the    
 centre for the community in the       
 surrounding area. It has a shop,      
 garage, hall, junior high school,     
 pier, etc.
