		<title>04THE HISTORY OF DALRY(KIRK)</title>
		<content>   St.John's Clachan of Dalry developed
 near St.John's Kirk and the twelfth   
 century motte beside the Water of Ken.
 The clachan (village or fairm toun)   
 was a resting place for pilgrims going
 to the shrine of St. Ninian at        
 Whithorn, notably James IV.           
   In the churchyard under a tombstone,
 possibly lettered by Old Mortality,lie
 two Covenanters shot by Claverhouse   
 for their religious beliefs in 1684.  
   Robert Burns based his narrative    
 poem Tam o' Shanter on the experience 
 of Adam Forster who was chased across 
 the river by witches whom he had seen 
 dancing in the church.Invoking the    
 name of God for protection, he traced 
 a circle round himself and his mare   
 with his sword. The oval Witches'     
 Score, later marked as a shallow ditch
 by Adam and later  farmers,is still   
 visible on Waterside Hill.            </content>
