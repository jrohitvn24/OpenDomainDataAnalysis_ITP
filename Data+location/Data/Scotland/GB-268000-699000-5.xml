		<title>05AGRICULTURE - FARM CROPS</title>
		<content> FARMS       Most farms in the area are
 tenanted.They lie about 200-250 feet  
 above sea level between the rivers    
 Forth and Teith.                      
 CROPS-      Mainly barley is grown    
 with an odd field of oats or wheat.   
 September is the main harvest month.  
 Combine harvesters are used &amp; grain   
 sold to Agricultural Merchants hope-  
 fully for malting, for brewing and    
 distilling. The straw is baled and    
 used for feeding and bedding cattle.  
 Some hay is grown too for feeding     
 cattle and sheep. This is usually     
 baled but due to unseasonable weather 
 this year the hay has been made into  
 silage.Most farms grow some acreage of
 potatoes. The ground is usually let to
 Potato Merchants. The farmer ploughs  
 the ground and the merchant does the  
 rest of the work including harvesting.
 Some turnips are grown to fatten lambs</content>
