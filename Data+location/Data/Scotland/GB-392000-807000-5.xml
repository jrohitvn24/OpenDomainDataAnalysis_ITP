 ABERDEEN: A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MY MUM.
                                       
 Mum enjoyed working with children.    
 When she got home she had a cup of    
 coffee then changed he clothes. The   
 weather was warm so Mum went out to   
 sunbathe.                             
                                       
                                       
 After supper she watched television.  
 Before  going to bed at 10.30 she had 
 a cup of tea. While in bed reading a  
 book I asked Mum if she had a nice    
 day. She said working was the best    
 part of her day but was very pleased  
 when Dad phoned from the oil rigs.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
