		<title>08FARMING IN CALLANDER</title>
		<content> There are 7 farms in this area.Most   
 of the farms grow crops.They grow     
 hay barley and silage for feeding     
 the cattle in winter.The farms are    
 small but most have been combined     
 to form larger working units.All the  
 farms rear{catle and sheep.}The sheep 
 are Blackface,Cross Suffolk or Cross  
 Leicester.Cross lambs fatten and are  
 sold in June.The main breed of cattle 
 is Cross Aberdeen Angus and Charolois 
 good beef cattle.                     
{Trees}are grown on the high ground and
 they are more profitable than sheep.  
 Much of the hill land has been        
 improved by draining reseeding,sowing 
 fertilising and killing bracken.      
 As well as the usual tractors and     
 other equipment,farmers use combine   
 harvesters to harvest the barley.     
 The best barley goes for malting.
