		<title>02Old Dailly Cemetery-Graves</title>
		<content> There are different categories of{    
{gravestones}in the {cemetery.}        
  The Covenanters' graves are marked   
 with tall pillars shaped into a       
 pyramid at the top, with some         
 surrounded by fences.The Covenanters  
 were people who were executed for     
 their {Protestant}faith, for which    
 they had made a covenant to protect.  
  The graves of the rich families have 
 more elaborate stones with long lists 
 of the deceased family names.One such 
 family stone is that of the {Cumming }
 family from {Dailly.}                 
  The old graves of the ordinary local 
 people have small stones with a skull 
 and crossbones on them and a sand     
 timer.                                
  Some graves also have plain slabs    
 with writing on them although the   { 
{poorest}local people commemorated the 
 graves with bare boulders.            </content>
