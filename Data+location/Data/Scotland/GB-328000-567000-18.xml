		<title>18The Councillor(1)</title>
		<content>{   Our councillor }became local {     
{councillor }in {1958.}He had always   
 been interested and active in         
 community work and when asked to stand
 saw it as an extension of that        
 activity.                             
                                       
      In those early days {Gretna }was 
 a depressed area and looked untidy,   
 neglected and generally uncared for.  
 Many {wooden homes },built during     
 World War 1,were still used for       
 housing the population.There were few 
 amenities and no industry or          
 employment opportunities, other than  
 a laundry.All {north }and {southbound 
{traffic }came through {Gretna.}An open
 ditch used to run along the length of{
{Union Road.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
