		<content>      Three buses pass through our     
 village every weekday from the south  
 end of the island and go to Lerwick.  
 Most people have a car and some have  
 two. A car is essential to get to     
 the shops, as we don't have a shop in 
 Quarff. Some of us go to school in a  
 taxi because we have a dangerous main 
 road to cross. On a farm or croft we  
 have tractors and two wheeler and     
 three wheeler motorbikes. The bikes   
 are used for hill work. Tractors and  
 trailers are used to take home the    
 peats. In the past we used to take    
 them home with a horse and cart.      
      All the children in our school   
 have a pedal bicycle. A policeman     
 comes to give us road safety lessons, 
 after which we take a Cycling         
 Proficiency Test. Each one who passes 
 receives a certificate and a badge.
