 A DAY IN MY LIFE                      
 I get up early on a Saturday morning  
 and watch the telly I watch the Wide  
 Awake Club. After that I watch the    
 cartoons and get dressed.  Later on I 
 watch No.73 and Chips until I go to my
 grans at about half past twelve.  When
 I go to my grans I go down the town   
 with my mum, dad, sister, brother,    
 gran, uncle and my two cousins.  I go 
 into Halfords and buy something for my
 BMX bike. When I get home from my     
 grans in Paisley my dad and I go out  
 for the dinner. We sometimes go to the
 chip shop but we mostly go to the     
 Chinese and Italian for our take away 
 dinners.  After my dinner I go out on 
 my bike with my friends. I stay out to
 about half past nine then I come in   
 and stay up to watch a horror movie.
