		<title>01Mellerstain Estate</title>
		<content> The block is divided by the Eden      
 Water, flowing south.  To the west lie
 the tenanted farms belonging to       
 Mellerstain Estate, the property  of  
 Lord Bining, heir to the 12th Earl of 
 Heddington.  The farms in this section
 of the estate are Lightfield,         
 Cottergoks and the Mellerstain Home   
 Farm.  Close to Mellerstain House, an 
 18th Century 'Adam' Mansion lies the  
 village of Mellerstain, housing       
 Estate, Farm and Retired workers. To  
 the east of the village is the Old    
 School, now closed, following the fall
 in population of the area. Mellerstain
 is surrounded by a park enclosing     
 ornamental deciduous trees.  The      
 remainder of the block to the east of 
 the river is part of the farms of East
 Gordon and Hardies Mill Place, and is 
 flatter and virtually treeless, being 
 prime arable land.                    </content>
