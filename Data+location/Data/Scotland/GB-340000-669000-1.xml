		<title>01AREA SOUTH EAST OF TRANENT</title>
		<content> There are two main roads through this 
 area with several tracks serving the  
 many farmsteads.  The area is mainly  
 arable farmland with deciduous        
 woodland and some rough grazing for   
 sheep.  There are few indications of  
 former mine and quarry workings and a 
 disused railway line meanders through 
 the area.  There are two villages,    
 Ormiston and New Winton.  Ormiston,   
 which is the bigger of the two, is an 
 old village with one or two buildings 
 marked for preservation.  New Winton  
 consists of a few houses on either    
 side of the main road and telephone   
 boxes.  Most of the inhabitants of    
 these villages work on the land or in 
 the mines but newer occupations such  
 as building contractors and coach hire
 have developed.
