		<content> Communications are very important in a
 remote community. Most people have    
 telephones and all but one family have
 television. There is a mast on the    
 hill which beams signals to the       
 houses. This was erected by the local 
 people. C.B. radio is used widely for 
 work and local news. The water        
 bailiffs have special radios which    
 only they can talk on. Cars are very  
 important when you live in the middle 
 of nowhere and everybody has a car.   
 There is a daily mail bus running     
 between Kinbrace and Bettyhill on the 
 north coast which conveys passengers  
 to and from Kinbrace Station and a bus
 service once a week from the village  
 of Helmsdale. The radio is very       
 important when we have snowstorms and 
 at that time Moray Firth Radio is a   
 vital link with the outside world.
