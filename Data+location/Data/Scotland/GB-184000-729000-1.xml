		<content>  Oban is a small town built round a   
 bay.  There are many hotels and       
 guesthouses because Oban is a tourist 
 centre.  The main street consists of  
 shops and restaurants.  There is a    
 sandy beach and an old castle to the  
 North.  In the centre there is a      
 railway station and piers for fishing,
 pleasure boats, and ferries to the    
 islands.  Oban faces an island,       
 kerrera, sheltering the bay, and rises
 onto hills all around, crowned by a   
 large stone circular monument called  
 McCaig's Tower.  There is a live-stock
 market centre for the islands and     
 surrounding farms.  Housing estates   
 have been built on the hillsides on   
 the outskirts of the town.  There are 
 five cottage hospitals and one small  
 industrial estate.  oban has a new    
 self-righting lifeboat.  On the pier  
 there is a fishermans mission.        </content>
