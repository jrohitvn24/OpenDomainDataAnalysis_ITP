 south-west of{LOCHANS}village. It     
 covers an area of 94.8 Hectares; of   
 which 64 Hectares is silage arable,   
 leaving 30.8 Ha of rough grazing.     
                                       
  The farm carries a herd of 130 dairy 
 Fresians as well as 150 Hereford-cross
 Beef cattle. The 150 Beefcattle graze 
 the rough pasture on the slopes of    
 Cairnpat hill while the dairy cattle  
 graze the better pasture. They also   
 receive a small amount of cattle cake 
 in the milk parlour. All the cattle   
 are fed silage as a fodder crop during
 the winter. The dairy cattle are      
 milked in a low line{HOSEIAR}milking  
 parlour. The milk is then transferred 
 to 700 gallon bulk tank, before being 
 taken away in the milk tanker. The    
 grass is cut for silage by a          
 contractor.                           </content>
