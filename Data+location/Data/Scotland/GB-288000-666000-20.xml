		<title>20The Railway, Blackridge</title>
		<content>   The railway grew busier when the    
{coal mining}started in Blackridge.    
 There was a railway station and a     
 signal box at{Westcraigs.}The signal  
 box was taken away about 1980-81. The 
 railway tracks were also taken away   
 about 1983.                           
                                       
         {*  *  *  *  *                
                                       
   Before the tracks were taken away   
 they carried vehicles for{British     
{Leyland}in Bathgate to Glasgow.       
 Part of the railway station is still  
 at Westcraigs but it has been changed 
 into a house.                         
   You can still see the{platforms}but 
 part of them have been knocked down.
