		<title>10AIRDRIE'S NEW HOSPICE 2</title>
		<content> THE ONLY GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL TO TAKE  
 ANY PATIENT IN WILL BE LACK OF ROOM.  
 ALREADY IT IS TOO SMALL AS THERE ARE  
 60-70 ELIGIBLE PATIENTS.              
      THE TERMINAL PATIENTS WILL BE    
 SURROUNDED BY CHRISTIAN PEOPLE WHO ARE
 NOT AFRAID OF DEATH AND WHO WILL      
 LOVINGLY PREPARE THEIR CHARGES FOR    
 THEIR FINAL MOMENTS.                  
      AIRDRIE HOSPICE IS SPECIAL TO US 
 AS IT IS A PIECE OF HISTORY IN THE    
 MAKING AND ALSO AS WE WILL BE ABLE TO 
 SAY THAT WE HELPED BUILD IT. THE      
 ESTIMATED OPENING IS LATE 1986.       
      AIRDRIE, LIKE OTHER WEST OF      
 SCOTLAND TOWNS, AT TIMES EXHIBITS     
 RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY. THIS WEEK IN THE   
 LOCAL ADVERTISER THE CALDERCRUIX DERRY
 BOYS ASSOCIATION COMPLAINED BITTERLY  
 ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING TO SUBSCRIBE TO,  
 ACCORDING TO THEM,TO THE 'CATHOLICS'.
