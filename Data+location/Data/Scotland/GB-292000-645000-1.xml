		<title>01The peat Bogs of Carstairs</title>
		<content> This area mainly features wetland     
 rocky hill areas - thus determining   
 the long established quarrying for    
 sand and gravel and recently the peat 
 cutting industry.  Farming is also    
 apparent with the land being used     
 mainly for grazing. The block contains
 three small villages Ravenstruther,   
 Carstairs village and Carstairs       
 Junction and although the area is     
 rural and widespread the community    
 appears to be close-knit due to the   
 number of established groups and      
 organisations.  Work is limited main  
 jobs being the quarries farms,        
 chicken factory and the railway       
 station at Crstairs Junction.  Shops  
 are few-but are sufficient for        
 supplementary shopping.
