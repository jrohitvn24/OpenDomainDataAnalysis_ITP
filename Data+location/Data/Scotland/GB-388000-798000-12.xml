		<title>12BLAIRS COLLEGE TODAY</title>
		<content>  Blairs is a seminary where boys from 
 twelve to eighteen come to find out if
 they would like to become{priests.    
 Apart from time spent together each   
 day in prayer, the boys are taught    
 ordinary subjects for their O-Grades  
 and Highers by thirteen priests and   
 six lay teachers.                     
  The boys engage in different sports  
 and hobbies on the{1500 acre estate - 
 football, tennis etc. There are       
 recreational rooms and a theatre too  
 where the parents are entertained to a
 Gilbert &amp; Sullivan opera since music  
 plays such a large part in college    
 life. Gardening and work on the farm  
 also take up some of the boy's time.  
 Although all the boys are boarders    
 they do get home at holiday time.
