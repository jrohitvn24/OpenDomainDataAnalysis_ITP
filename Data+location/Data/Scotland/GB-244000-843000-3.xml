		<content> The owners of Cluaine-an-Teanassie    
 Deer Farm also keep 150 head of       
 cattle including Aberdeen Angus(beef  
 breed),Dexters and one Shetland       
 cow.There are also sheep and goats on 
 the farm.The  sheep are of the        
 Shetland species, and their fleece is 
 sold to people who do hand spinning.  
 The goats are feral and have very     
 valuable wool which is used for making
 Cashmere goods. This type of goat eats
 different things from other animals   
 and its favourite food is weeds. An   
 experiment is presently taking place  
 to find out just how many types of    
 plants these goats do eat.
