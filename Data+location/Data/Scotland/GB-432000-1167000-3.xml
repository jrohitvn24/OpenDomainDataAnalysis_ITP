		<content> PEAT                                  
 Many people in our block have peat    
 banks.This is a strip of moorland     
 where they can cut peat for their own 
 use.                                  
 First  take the turf off the bank     
 using a shetland spade.Next you use a 
 special spade called a tushkar        
 to cast the peat.Casting peat means   
 cutting the peat from the bank and    
 putting it on the grass at the top of 
 the bank.You build the peat into a    
 wall making sure you leave spaces for 
 the wind to blow through.             
 When the peat has dried a little you  
 raise it into small piles.When        
 completely dry you put them in        
 bags.Then the tractor or van can come 
 and collect them and take them        
 home.It is not easy work but if you   
 are prepared to work you have your    
 fuel for the winter.                  </content>
