		<content> The farms vary in size from crofts of 
 a few acres to bigger units of several
 hundred acres.Apart from three dairy  
 farms the farming is mixed cattle and 
 sheep and a little arable. Suckler    
 cows of various native breeds produce 
 spring calves which are sold in Oct.  
 for fattening locally or in the south.
 Some are retained and sold as         
 yearlings in April.                   
 Mainly Cheviot sheep are bred.The ewes
 producing lambs in the spring which   
 are sold in the autumn.Recently       
 Suffolk tups have been introduced and 
 the x-lambs are sold for fattening.   
 The crops that are grown i.e.hay,oats,
 silage,barley and turnips are for the 
 winter feeding of the animals.        
 In the smaller units the crofter's    
 main income will be from an outside   
 occupation.
