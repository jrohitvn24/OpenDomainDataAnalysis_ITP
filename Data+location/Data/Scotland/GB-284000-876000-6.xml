          SALMON FISHING               
     On Friday the 17th of May John,   
 James and I went to interview William 
 Paterson. Our subject is salmon       
 fishing and we found out the following
 information.                          
        The Patersons have been salmon 
 fishing here since 1910 and William   
 has been fishing since the age of 14. 
 William's biggest catch in one day is 
 750 salmon. This year Patersons       
 started fishing on the 14th of May    
 which is later than usual.The usual   
 time is the 11th of Feb .This year    
 Patersons have 9 nets out two at      
 Hilton and seven at the tennis courts.
 If you put them all in line they would
 measure almost a mile.Last year was   
 the worst season ever                 
 recorded for salmon fishing.Patersons 
 own 6 boats but will use only  3 this </content>
