		<title>10HUMBIE SCHOOL CLOSURE</title>
		<content>  LAST YEAR IT WAS PROPOSED TO CLOSE   
 OUR SCHOOL.THIS WAS BECAUSE WE ONLY   
 HAD FOURTEEN PUPILS AND THERE WAS     
 SPARE ACCOMMODATION IN NEARBY         
 SCHOOLS.THE PARENTS FORMED AN ACTION  
 COMMITEE.TO FIGHT THE CLOSURE MONEY   
 WAS NEEDED AND A COFFEE MORNING WAS   
 HELD.LOTS OF COUNCILLORS VISITED THE  
 SCHOOL TO SEE IF THEY THOUGHT IT      
 SHOULD CLOSE. FORTUNATELY THEY DECIDED
 NOT TO CLOSE IT AND WE HAD A PARTY TO 
 CELEBRATE.A SCHOOL IS IMPORTANT IN A  
 COMMUNITY LIKE THIS AND IF IT HAD     
 CLOSED EVERYONE WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO  
 TRAVEL AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN SPLIT UP
 FROM OUR FRIENDS.IT WAS ALSO FELT THAT
 YOUNG FAMILIES MIGHT NOT WANT TO LIVE 
 HERE IF THERE WAS NO SCHOOL.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
