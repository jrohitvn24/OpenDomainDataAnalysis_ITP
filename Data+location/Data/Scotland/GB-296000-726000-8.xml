		<content> Mr.J.R.Carpenter is a bachelor master,
 who has a study and a bedroom in the  
 main building of the College. He finds
 it easy to get away from the College, 
 but, unlike other bachelors, does not 
 mind whether or not he does. He does  
 not feel compelled to put the College 
 before himself, but his hobbies tie in
 with his work.  His only family life  
 comes during the holidays, when he    
 goes home for a few weeks.            
 A master's wife whose family (husband 
 and daughter) lives on the College    
 estate said that as her husband works 
 hard  she sees him more in the        
 holidays, spent here and in England.  
 Both must put school before family but
 this is made up for by long holidays. 
 She named the environment false, but  
 this is their only home. She enjoys   
 living in the country as it is a good 
 place to bring up children.           </content>
