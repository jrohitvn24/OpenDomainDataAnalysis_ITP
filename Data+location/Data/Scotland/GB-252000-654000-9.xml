		<title>09CHRISTIANITY, NEWTON MEARNS</title>
		<content>   The principal religious belief in   
 Newton Mearns is Christianity. The    
 Church of Scotland has four places of 
 worship with a total membership of    
 3771.                                 
   The Maple Evangelical Church has    
 about 45 members while the Baptist    
 Church has a membership of 240.       
   There is one Roman Catholic Church  
 with a membership of 1680.            
   As is common in this country today, 
 the numbers of adherants to the faith 
 is somewhat falling, although those   
 remaining are just as strong in their 
 beliefs as in past years. One of the  
 problems the Churches face lies in    
 gaining young members who will remain 
 with them for life.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
