		<content> Most of the farms around Strathaven   
 are hill farms.They mainly stock dairy
 cattle known as Fresians though some  
 beef cattle are also kept.Sheep,hens  
 and goats are also found.The main     
 crop is Barley but potatoes, cabbage, 
 turnips and silage are also           
 produced.During the winter the farmers
 feed the cattle with turnips hay      
 silage and an enriched substance like 
 treacle.                              
      Most of the farms in the area are
 between two and five hundred acres in 
 extent although several larger farms  
 contain more than six hundred acres.  
 Some land is now used by the Forestry 
 Commission who plant quick growing    
 evergreens which in future will be    
 made into furniture etc. although this
 is negligible compared with other     
 forms of land use.
