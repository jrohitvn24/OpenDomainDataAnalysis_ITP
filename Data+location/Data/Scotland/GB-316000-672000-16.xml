		<title>16VISIT TO HIGHWAYS DEPARTMENT</title>
		<content> While we were looking at the heavy    
 traffic on the Queensferry Road, some 
 of our class at Clermiston School paid
 a visit to the Highways Department of 
 Lothian Regional Council who are res- 
 ponsible for providing and maintaining
 the city roads. We learned how a      
 traffic survey is done if the Council 
 are considering providing a pedestrian
 crossing. A common kind is the pelican
 crossing, where you wait till a green 
 man sign is lit up to show you that   
 the traffic has been signalled to     
 stop and allow you to cross. Other    
 crossings are subways, zebra crossings
 and footbridges. Special films are    
 taken at intervals and then speeded up
 to show how and where people cross    
 roads. When the numbers of pedestrians
 and vehicles using a road are known,  
 a special sum is worked out to see    
 whether a crossing is necessary.      </content>
