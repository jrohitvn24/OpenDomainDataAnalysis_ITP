		<content> On the 3rd of June we took a bus trip 
 to the eastern corner of{Eglinton}    
{Park}which lies within our D Block. We
 took a walk which lasted for about 45 
 minutes and searched for as much{Flora
{and Fauna}as we could find as we went 
 along. We have a moderate climate with
 more than average rainfall. The soil  
 is fertile so we are lucky to have    
 many plants and healthy woodland      
 growing in our area. Below is our list
 of{insects}and on the following pages 
 are our lists of other{Flora and      
{Fauna.
