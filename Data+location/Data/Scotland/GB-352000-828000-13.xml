		<title>13Teenage Fashion</title>
		<content> Older people call the fashions worn by
 teenagers outrageous and say they have
 no "dress sense".Tight clothes are on 
 the way out and baggy clothes are very
 chic .Many teenagers hand paint their 
 clothes ,bright colours and flower    
 designs are all the  rage.Many styles 
 from past decades have come back into 
 fashion and youngsters are wearing    
 clothes 'dug out'of their parents and 
 grandparent's wardrobes .Trowsers     
 which come half way up the shin are   
 often worn,as are V-backed jumpers and
 bat-wing jumpers.Jewellery worn in the
 80's is often: made of plastic,chunky,
 clumsy and cheap.Some people          
 reassemble  bought jewellery to suit  
 their own tastes. Rings are often worn
 through the side of the nose.Many     
 people have  pierced ears.Many teen-  
 agers dye their hair bright colours,  
 cut it or set it into strange styles. </content>
