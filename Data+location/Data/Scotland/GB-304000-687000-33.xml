We interviewed 82 children excluding ourselves and asked them what they did in their spare time. &lt;br />&lt;br />33% played their computer games like X-box, Psp, Nintendo DS etc.&lt;br />&lt;br />27% take part in sports activities like  Judo, Football, Ice Skating etc.      24% played outside or with their friends, in the play park or on their bike or scooter.&lt;br />&lt;br />6% take part in art activities,&lt;br />&lt;br />5% bake&lt;br />&lt;br />4% watch T.V. &lt;br />&lt;br />However we found out that nobody went to their granâ€™s or church during their sparetime. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
