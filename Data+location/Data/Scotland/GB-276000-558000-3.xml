		<title>03GAMEKEEPING   1</title>
		<content> In February the gamekeeper catches the
 pheasants for breeding. From April to 
 July is the rearing season.           
 At about two weeks old,the chicks have
 bits put in their beaks to prevent    
 them from pecking one another.They are
 kept in a shed,given water three times
 a day and fed,firstly on very fine    
 meal,then on pellets.During the       
 shooting season,the pheasants continue
 to be fed,mainly on barley.           
 When they are about six weeks old,the 
 bits are removed,their beaks are      
 burned electrically,and the three     
 outside feathers on one wing are      
 clipped to prevent them from flying.  
 They are put into release pens on the 
 hills.                                
 The pheasant shooting season begins on
 October the first and continues until 
 February.About eight days of shooting 
 take place in this area.              </content>
