		<content> Osnaburgh was the old name for        
 Dairsie.  It is connected with a small
 village in Germany called Osnabruck.  
 The first settlers in Dairsie were    
 probably Germans who introduced the   
 linen industry.  The linen weavers    
 would live in the small cottages in   
 Main Street.  Osnaburgh can still be  
 heard in Dairsie from Osnaburgh Court 
 and I live there. - Pauline Short     
 The Pitcairn Institute was built in   
 1900 as a house by Mrs. Pitcairn. She 
 had many books and when she dies it   
 was used as the library and institute.
 It is now my Aunt's house.  Until the 
 middle thirties water was raised from 
 a well outside the back door which was
 used by the householders who had no   
 well of their own.  At the back of the
 Institute is Pitcairn Park for which  
 Mrs. Pitcairn paid.
