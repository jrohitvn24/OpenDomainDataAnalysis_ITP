		<title>16LORNA'S HORSE</title>
		<content> My horse is stabled at the Livery     
 Stable throughout the year. I find    
 this more convenient because of my    
 interest in{SHOW JUMPING}and{HORSE    
{SHOWS.}Horses jump better and are kept
 fitter when off the grass. Also, when 
 I am jumping at shows, which usually  
 last about 3 days, the horse must be  
 stabled and it is not good for it to  
 be in the cold one night and in warmth
 the next.                             
 I travel all over Scotland and        
 N.England to compete in show jumping  
 competitions. These take place all    
 year round. During the summer they are
 held outdoors and through the winter  
 they are held in arenas. When we      
 travel to these shows and stay        
 overnight we live in our horsebox     
 which is divided into a living area   
 for us and an area for the horses.
