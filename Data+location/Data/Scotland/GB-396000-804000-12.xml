		<title>12SHIPBUILDING-HALL RUSSELL</title>
		<content> Situated on Pocra Quay are the massive
 sheds of Hall Russell's,Shipbuilders. 
 Always a shipbuilding site it was once
 famous for manufacturing 'Aberdeen    
 Clippers' in the heydays of sail.Only 
 800 men are now employed building     
 mainly patrol and fishery protection  
 vessels for the Royal Navy.Although a 
 profitable concern the fate of the    
 yard is uncertain due to Government   
 Policy to sell of the yard.There are  
 fears thet the Government are rushing 
 privitisation of the yard and that it 
 will be sold to the private sector at 
 a 'knockdown' price.The workforce are 
 petitioning the Government to make the
 retention of shipbuilding a condition 
 of sale.For despite prosperity from   
 oil the traditional industries have   
 declined and there is strong local    
 feeling to try and maintain what is   
 now left of the shipbuilding industry.</content>
