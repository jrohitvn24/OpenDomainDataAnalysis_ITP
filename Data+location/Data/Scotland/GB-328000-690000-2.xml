		<content> The Links area mostly changed around  
 1945 because of the demolition of old 
 houses as people moved away and       
 factories such as Stocks and          
 Lockharts, linen makers closed down. A
 ropery and string works also closed.  
 The area was repopulated a bit in the 
 1960's  by the building of council    
 houses.  Where the pool is now, there 
 was a salt works. The salt came in    
 rock form from Northern Ireland via   
 River Forth. Next to that was a corn  
 exchange. And near that was the town  
 refuse where all the rubbish was      
 burnt. In Tesco's car park there were 
 many houses. There was also a fire    
 station which was next to the corn    
 exchange. In place of this there is   
 the Mercat shopping centre, two multi 
 storey car parks, a swimming pool and 
 an open car park where the houses have
 been.                                 </content>
