		<content> The owners of the Gordon Arms don,t   
 get to bed until anything from 11.30pm
 to 2.00am.Working in a pub is hard    
 work but enjoyable.The work includes  
 serving at a bar, ordering, taking    
 deliveries and general upkeep. The    
 owners of the pub hardly get any      
 freetime but all they get is spent    
 with the family. They would not like  
 another kind of job. The kind of work 
 they do in the pub is barservice,     
 cooking and keeping the rooms clean   
 and tidy.There are three rooms for    
 visitors.There is one double room and 
 two single rooms which have a shower  
 and a sink in them.The busiest time of
 the year is the summer.The Gordon Arms
 is a hotel for people that like peace 
 and quite.From the hotel you can walk,
 go picnics,fish, horse ride and swim  
 in the river.
