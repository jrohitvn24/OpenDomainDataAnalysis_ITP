		<content> The Town and County Hospital was      
 originally built as a hospital for    
 fever patients,but now provides       
 long-term care for up to twenty-eight 
 elderly patients and ten surgical     
 convalescent patients. The elderly    
 patients, who are encouraged to spend 
 weekends with their families wherever 
 possible, are cared for by 26 trained 
 staff of whom 6 are part-time.In 1986 
 a new hospital is to open in Wick     
 which will cater for all medical,     
 surgical and maternity cases and will 
 also provide long-term care for the   
 elderly.It has been proposed that the 
 new hospital will be called the       
 Caithness General Hospital.The Town   
 and County Hospital will then probably
 be surplus to requirements but may    
 provide a site for new staff homes.
