		<title>15The Old Stables Dalgety Bay.</title>
		<content> On the way to the Sailing Club along  
 the waterfront you will pass the Old  
 Stables where the Earls of Moray , who
 owned most of the land in the area,   
 once kept their horses and coaches.   
 There is a very interesting story     
 connected with the Old Stables. One of
 the Earl's of Moray fell in love with 
 a lady from a notable family in the   
 area. He proposed marriage to her and 
 she accepted. The marriage day was set
 and the Earl had a splendid carriage  
 built especially for her. The carriage
 was to be pulled by 3 matching pairs  
 of immaculate white horses. The great 
 day arrived and no one from the brides
 family turned up, nor did the bride , 
 who eloped with another  just before  
 the marriage. The angry Earl vowed    
 that the coach would never turn a     
 wheel and had the 6 horses shot.
