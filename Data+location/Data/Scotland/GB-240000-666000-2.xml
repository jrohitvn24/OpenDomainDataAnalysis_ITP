		<title>02POPULATION OF HOUSTON</title>
		<content> Until the 20th. century the area had  
 less than{1000 people.}Most people    
 worked in agriculture or in the       
 Houston cotton mill.                  
 The village started to grow as road   
 and rail links started to improve. New
 services in the village, for example, 
 new public houses, schools, churches  
 were justified by a growing           
 population.                           
 Since 1971 there has been a rapid     
 growth due to an influx of people  to 
 the many new housing estates built    
 around the original village. The      
 population had risen to{over 3000}by  
 1981.                                 
{Gryffe High School was opened in 1980.
 The village now covers a much larger  
 area than before. There will be an    
 estimated{6000 people by 1990}and the 
 village boundaries by then will be    
 close to the town of Linwood.         </content>
