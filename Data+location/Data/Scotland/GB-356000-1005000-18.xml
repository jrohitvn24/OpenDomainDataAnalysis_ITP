		<title>18TOURISM IN DEERNESS (1)</title>
		<content>  Quite a few{holiday cottages}are let 
 for the summer season. Most of these  
 cottages are older farmhouses         
 renovated.{Beaches}around Deerness are
 a mixture of sand and stone, where    
 there is much of interest to be found.
 Seals are often seen and heard. The   
{Covenantors Monument,}dated 1679, is  
 now signposted and a pathway made over
 fields for public access. Well visited
 by locals and tourists, this monument 
 stands in  memory of the Covenantors  
 lost off the prison ship 'Crown' which
 was wrecked on Scarvataing on a       
 December evening. At the{Brough of    
{Deerness}there stands ruins of an     
 ancient chapel which is accessible by 
 land or sea.
