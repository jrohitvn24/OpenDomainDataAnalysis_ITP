		<title>16COLINTON DELL</title>
		<content>  When we went to Colinton Dell we had 
 a great day. With all the open spaces 
 it was a super place to do anything   
 from eating our packed lunch to       
 orienteering. The water was very cool 
 for cooling your feet on such a hot   
 day. Many people fish here because it 
 is easy to get a permit. Trout is the 
 main fish which they catch.           
  We saw the ruins of an old mill and  
 it was very interesting.There are many
 mills and a few are still operating.  
  Because of the many trees, the river 
 with its bridges and the hills and    
 valleys, the Dell is good for         
 orienteering. While we were           
 orienteering we saw some football     
 pitches. It was very lively for us but
 others we met were enjoying the peace.
  At the end of the day we were all    
 very tired so we went down to a shady 
 peaceful place to rest.               </content>
