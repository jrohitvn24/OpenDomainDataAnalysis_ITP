		<content> Crail is a healthy unpolluted area. A 
 surgery is attached to a medical      
 practice based in Anstruther.  A      
 District Nurse visits.  We also have  
 an undertaker so people can easily be 
 buried in the local churchyard.  We   
 have a chemist/pharmacist and a       
 chiropody service.  Slimnastics/Yoga  
 classed have started.  A welfare      
 committee arrange a 'bus outing,      
 presents and a Christmas party for the
 old people.  The meals on wheels      
 service also keeps a watch on the old.
  Our nearest hospital for emergencies 
 is 10 miles away and it has only      
 visiting consultants.A Red Cross car  
 service takes visitors to Kirkcaldy   
 General Hospital 25 miles away. Two   
 houses have been built for disabled   
 people.
