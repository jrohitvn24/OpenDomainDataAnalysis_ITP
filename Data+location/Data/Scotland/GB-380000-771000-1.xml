		<title>01Landscape Around Inverbervie</title>
		<content> Our D block is situated around        
 Inverbervie which is on the north east
 coast of Scotland.  It is quite a     
 hilly area consisting mainly of       
 farmland.                             
 The main attraction in our D block is 
 the {Royal Burgh of Inverbervie}with  
 a population of about one thousand two
 hundred but numbers are rapidly       
 increasing due to new houses being    
 built.                                
 By the river is a picturesque {caravan
{and camping site}popular with         
 tourists.                             
 We have few trees as we are next to   
 the North Sea which means we are      
 affected by a cold sea wind but       
 usually our climate is quite mild     
 especialy in winter.                  
 A small part of{Gourdon}village is    
 also included in our D block.
