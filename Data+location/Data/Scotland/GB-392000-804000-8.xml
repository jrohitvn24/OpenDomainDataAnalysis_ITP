		<content> Mrs Peggy Coull an eighty year old    
 lady who has lived at 296 Union Grove 
 for almost 49 years was asked about   
 the changes that had taken place in   
 that time.One of the most dramatic    
 differences is the number of people   
 who live within the block of six      
 flats.In 1936 there were 8 adults and 
 17 children while today there are 9   
 adults but no children.Mrs coull felt 
 that she used to know everyone in her 
 street in those days but now there is 
 so much change especially with oil    
 workers that she cant keep up with    
 the movement of people in and out of  
 the area.                             
 Some changes have been for the        
 better.Mrs Coull felt that the bus    
 service which she uses most days is   
 very good with a bus every twelve     
 minutes.Something that could be       
 improved is law and order.In the past </content>
