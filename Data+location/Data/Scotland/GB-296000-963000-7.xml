		<title>07REAY - CHURCHES</title>
		<content> Within the area marked on the map     
 there is only one church, in the      
 village of Reay itself, on the north  
 side of the main Thurso - Tongue road.
 It is a very old building, being      
 nearly 250 years old and is of great  
 historic interest because of its      
 almost unique T-plan shape. In this   
 250 years there have been 12 ministers
 of the church: 6 in the first 200     
 years and 6 in the last 50. Concerning
 the church's involvement in the       
 community, on the one hand, there is  
 direct involvement consisting of      
 Sunday worship, Woman's Guild meetings
 and a Sunday School; in addition the  
 church gives Christmas parcels to the 
 senior citizens of the parish. On the 
 other hand, however, there is a great 
 deal of involvement of individual     
 christians within the life of the     
 community in all its aspects.         </content>
