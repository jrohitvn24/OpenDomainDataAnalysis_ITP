		<content> One of the{small companies}attracted  
  to Irvine is Andrew Wright.  The     
 products they make (windows and doors)
 go to hospitals,schools, houses and   
 government buildings. Their           
 materials, like the timber and        
 aluminium, come from all over the     
 world but the glass is manufactured   
 in  St. Helens, England. They use     
 machines like saws, drills, routers   
 and washing machines. The company     
 began in Ayr in l937 and Irvine was   
 the only place with factory space. The
 factory finds Irvine a bit remote in  
 Britain so it is a bit of a problem   
 for transport.  The{Scottish          
{Development Agency}give them          
 redevelopment grants and they buy     
 machinery with the money. 3O people   
 are employed at the factory doing jobs
 like fabricating, manufacturing,fixing
 selling products and office work.     </content>
