      Heartless thieves have stolen    
 vital equipment from the Scout Troop  
 in Duntocher Trinity Church.          
                                       
      On May the 27th or 28th someone  
 broke into the church hall taking new 
 camping gear including expensive tents
 and stoves.The equipment was vital to 
 the  boys doing their Duke of         
 Edinburgh Award Scheme.Now that it has
 been stolen it makes things very much 
 more difficult for them because the   
 gear was all lightweight and easy to  
 carry.                                
                                       
      Clydebank Police confirmed that  
 camping equipment had been stolen and 
 warned the public to be on the lookout
 for it.
