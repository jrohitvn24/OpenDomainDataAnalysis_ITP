		<content> There are three members from our part 
 of the community involved in craft    
 work. All are people who recently     
 moved into the area. Most of them     
 receive financial help from various   
 grant awarding bodies.                
 The main crafts are weaving,          
 embroidery, knitting and leather      
 work. In fact a purpose-built tannery 
 is in the final stages of completion  
 just now. These craft products are    
 sold by mail-order as well as to      
 personal callers to the individual    
 premises. They prove very popular with
 the tourists who visit our area. These
 enterprises provide very necessary    
 employment for some of the local      
 people.{
