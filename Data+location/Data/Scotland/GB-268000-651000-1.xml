		<title>01SW Hamilton- General View</title>
		<content>   This area is to the SW of the town  
 of Hamilton in Strathclyde. It        
 partially consists of housing estates,
 and partially of countryside. The     
 housing estates are in the NE of the  
 area.                                 
   Most of the area surveyed is used   
 for farming; mainly by raising cattle 
 and sheep.                            
   The land slopes to the NE, steeply  
 down into the Clyde Valley, north of  
 Hamilton. There are few trees, mostly 
 shelter belts or wooded river valleys.
 At one time the area had extensive    
 mining operations, but these have all 
 been closed, as has the Hamilton to   
 Strathaven railway that ran through   
 the area.                             
   Industry is confined to a small     
 number of factories on an industrial  
 estate.                               
   Estimated population about 12,000.  </content>
