		<title>17  WORK IN GORDON.</title>
		<content> My dad works as a engineer.He works in
 and around Gordon.He works in a very  
 special shed.Sometimes he sorts cars  
 or sprays cars.He often puts car      
 engines into peoples cars.            
 He has a very good job as an engineer.
 He does lots of jobs in the village   
 for people.They all like my dad.      
 My dad likes his work very much       
 because it makes him money.When he    
 comes in from work he is very tired.  
 My dad has a lot of expensive stuff.  
 He has a spray gun and a compressor.  
 He uses them a lot in his work.A      
 spray gun costs about one hundred     
 pounds.The compresser blows the paint 
 out of the spray gun on to the car.My 
 dad has worked as an engineer for over
 6 years.
