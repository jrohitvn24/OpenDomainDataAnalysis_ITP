		<title>06THE UNION CANAL</title>
		<content> QUITE A FEW LOCAL PEOPLE HAVE THEIR   
 OWN SAILING CRAFT WHICH THEY USE ON   
 THE CANAL AND SEVERAL SCHOOLS COME    
 FROM OUTSIDE THE AREA AND USE THE     
 CANAL AT RATHO FOR CANOEING.          
                                       
    ANOTHER ACTIVITY WHICH TAKES PLACE 
 ON THE CANAL IS THE CANAL JUMPING     
 CONTEST. THIS TAKES PLACE DURING THE  
 RATHO GALA WEEK AND INVOLVES PEOPLE   
 TRYING TO JUMP OVER A PART OF THE     
 CANAL NEAR TO THE BRIDGE INN. VERY FEW
 PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY MANAGED THIS, THE
 MAJORITY FINISH UP IN THE WATER.      
                                       
    IT IS HOPED THAT IN THE FUTURE     
 PARTS OF THE CANAL WHICH HAVE BEEN    
 BLOCKED OFF IN THE PAST WILL BE OPENED
 UP AGAIN WHICH WILL ALLOW BARGES FROM 
 RATHO TO TRAVEL MUCH GREATER DISTANCES
 AND ENCOURGE EVEN MORE PEOPLE TO USE  
 ITS FACILITIES.                       </content>
