		<title>17THE PROPOSED BYPASS</title>
		<content>                                       
 There are two proposed lines for the  
 bypass.  Line B and line F.  They both
 start and finish at the same point.   
 The nearest the lines get to          
 Locharbriggs is Bloomfield.  Line B is
 much preferred because it is concerned
 about taking more traffic away from   
 the town.  There will be less traffic 
 going through Locharbriggs, lorries   
 etc from the factories will not have  
 to come through the town.  They can go
 straight onto the bypass.  Holiday    
 makers coming from the north and south
 will travel straight onto the bypass  
 and this will stop traffic jams in the
 town.
