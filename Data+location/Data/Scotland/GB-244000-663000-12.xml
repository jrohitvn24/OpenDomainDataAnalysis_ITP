		<title>12Housing in Linwood</title>
		<content>   Housing in{Linwood}has improved     
 dramatically since the late 19th      
 century, when tenements and cottages  
 provided the housing stock. Houses    
 still standing on the{Bridge of Weir  
{Road}were built around 1909 and form  
 part of the old village. Most of the  
 houses in Linwood are owned by the    
 local authority; only{12%}of the      
 population own their own houses.      
   Between{1963}and{1977}the District  
 Council built a total of{2329}houses. 
 Also during the period{1970}to{1977   
 the {S.S.H.A.}built{1288}houses in    
 Linwood, all of which helped to cope  
 with the increasing population. The   
 two most recent housing schemes in    
 Linwood are located at{Mossedge}and   
{Greenhill}. Another small development 
 is located in{Napier Gardens},adjacent
 to the school and are the most recent 
 additions to the housing stock.       </content>
