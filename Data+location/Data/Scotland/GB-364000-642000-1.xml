		<title>01A RURAL SCENE IN SCOTLAND</title>
		<content> Our block can be found on Sheet 74 of 
 the Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 First    
 Series. This area once known as the   
 parish of Gordon(because Gordon was   
 the only village of note) is situated 
 in the S.E. of the Southern Uplands.  
 The block sits on the hills which     
 overlook the N.W.corner of the Tweed  
 Valley.When studied on the O.S. map it
 can be seen that the area is bisected 
 by the River Eden.There are two main  
 roads which form a crossroads in the  
 centre of the village of Gordon. The  
 A6089 runs N to S. It joins the A68   
 ten miles further north. This is the  
 main Border road to Edinburgh which is
 35 miles from Gordon. The A6105 runs E
 to W.To the east is Berwick-on-Tweed. 
 The area is predominately arable      
 farm land.Gordon is the only village  
 having a population of a few hundred.
