		<content> This May Mr.Derrick Gilmour,the       
 harbourmaster will leave his office   
 on Shore Street for the new site down 
 river by Longman Drive.He will have a 
 fine view of the Firth and the        
 harbour.The mudflats at the river     
 mouth have been filled in and two more
 berths and a wide quay are being      
 constructed.This extension was aided  
 by E.E.C.money.                       
 Each year half a million tonnes of    
 refined oil is imported and piped to  
 storage tanks opposite Citadel Quay.  
 Great piles of pulpwood are being     
 loaded on barges to be towed out to a 
 ship in Munlochy Bay,bound for Sweden.
 Alongside,mobile cranes are unloading 
 a cargo of Scandinavian sawn timber   
 for housebuilding.About 35 cargo      
 vessels arrive each month,bringing    
 mainly coal and road salt and         
 exporting dry bulk grain.             </content>
