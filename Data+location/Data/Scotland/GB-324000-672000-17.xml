		<title>17The New Town of Edinburgh</title>
		<content> Edinburgh, until the 1760's a crowded 
 huddle of buildings around the Royal  
 Mile, was extended by building a New  
 Town beyond the Nor'Loch.James Craig's
 Plan was one of the earliest examples 
 of town planning. Its spacious layout 
 and graceful architecture earned      
 Edinburgh the title of 'Athens of the 
 North'.The area was mainly housing for
 the capital's wealthier citizens.Today
 it is the headquarters of financial/  
 legal organisations and the main      
{shopping}area. Many of the fine       
 Georgian houses are now used as       
 offices, but a large residential      
 community still remains in the New    
 Town. Princes Street is the main      
 shopping axis and one of the city's   
 main{tourist}attractions. Change and  
 redevelopment have occurred, but      
 conservation of the city's{landscape} 
 is now much more actively pursued.    </content>
