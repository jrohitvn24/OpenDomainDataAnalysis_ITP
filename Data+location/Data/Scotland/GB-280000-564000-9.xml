		<content> Rounders is a game where you need two 
 equal teams, one small ball and       
 bases.  Toss a coin to see who bowls  
 first.  The opposing team spreads out 
 round the playing area.  The bowler   
 throws the ball and you catch it.  You
 throw it as far as you can and run    
 round the bases.  If the bowler gets  
 the ball while you are at a base you  
 have to stop.  If you are between two 
 bases and the bowler gets the ball,   
 you are 'out'.  If you get round all  
 the bases you get a 'ROUNDER'.  If the
 person throws the ball and the other  
 team catches it your team is out and  
 the other team is in.  The winner is  
 the team with the most rounders.
