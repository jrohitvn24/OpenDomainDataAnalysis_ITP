		<title>04PORT OF MENTEITH INCHMAHOME</title>
		<content> The ruins of the Augustinian Priory of
 Inchmahome stand on an island situated
 near the north shore of the Lake of   
 Menteith. Since the monument passed   
 into the guardianship of the Secretary
 of State for Scotland it has been     
 carefully developed and now is one of 
 the most attractive memorials of      
 Medieval monastic life left in        
 Scotland.                             
  The plan of the buildings follows the
 normal arrangement of a medieval      
 religious house, the Kirk being the   
 most important of the buildings. For  
 the building of the Priory the stone  
 was brought from a considerable       
 distance and had to be ferried across 
 the water.It is possible that all the 
 architectural features of the         
 kirk,such as the west doorway and its 
 surrounding piers and their arches    
 were dressed at the quarry.           </content>
