		<title>07SALMON FISHING, CARNOUSTIE</title>
		<content>   The small village of{Easthaven}     
 is where Mr.Duncan, a full-time{salmon
{fisherman}lives and works.  He has the
 sole salmon-fishing rights of the     
 stretch of water between{Carnoustie}  
 and{Elliot}and leases them from the   
{Tay Salmon Fishing Company}to whom he 
 must sell his fish.                   
   He uses two kinds of nets---staked  
 nets and floating nets, which cost    
 Â£500 each.  Mr.Duncan must go to his  
 nets every 12hrs. to remove any       
{salmon.} Sometimes he finds{seals}in  
 his net and on one occasion he found a
{25ft. basking shark.} This means a    
 great deal of extra work for Mr.Duncan
 as they cause damage to his nets.     
   It is illegal for anyone but        
 Mr.Duncan to catch salmon in this area
 and regular patrols are made along the
 coast by aircraft to spot salmon      
 poachers who will be heavily fined.   </content>
