		<title>10CROFTING IN BONAR</title>
		<content> There are lots of crofts in the       
 vicinity of Bonar. A{croft}is a{small 
{farm,}and most of the people who own  
 crofts have other jobs to go to. The  
 land around Bonar is not all that     
 fertile. There are no dairy farmers.  
 The crofters often help each other and
 borrow each others' machinery. Most   
 crofters grow hay, corn, tatties,     
 swedes and turnips. Usually crofters  
 have the essential equipment for      
 crofting, tractor, plough, harrows,   
 and a trailer. Most crofts have sheep,
 cows, hens and maybe some goats. Most 
 of the cows are for beef.             
  Crofters plant the tatties, turnips  
 and swedes around April, but the corn 
 goes in a bit earlier. The hay is     
 usually cut around July/August and the
 tatties are usually picked around     
 October.{
