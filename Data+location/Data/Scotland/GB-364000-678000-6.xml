		<title>06LOCAL BREWERY EXPANDS</title>
		<content>{Belhaven Brewery}has extended its     
 operations by buying new premises     
 ,amounting to 30,000 square feet,at   
 Spott Road Industrial Estate.         
 The units will be used primarily for  
 the firms distribution, cellar,       
 servicing, services sales and         
 administration, allowing the site at  
 Belhaven to be used for brewing and   
 packaging.  The need for expansion    
 arose from the continuing growth in   
 sales in the past few years. Belhaven 
 has outgrown the existing facilities. 
 The option of building on sites in    
 Lanarkshire and West Lothian arose,   
 and indeed much cost would have been  
 saved by locating the distribution    
 centre closer to the heart of their   
 principal trading area, Central       
 Scotland. But it was decided that the 
 money was not as important as         
 retaining the Dunbar workforce.       </content>
