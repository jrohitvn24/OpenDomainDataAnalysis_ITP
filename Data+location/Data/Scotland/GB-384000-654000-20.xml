		<title>20CHIRNSIDE:PEARLIN JEAN</title>
		<content> Sir Robert had spent most of his money
 on gambling and drinking and therefore
 needed his wife's money. Jeanne got   
 word of what had happened. When the   
 coach carrying Sir Robert and his new 
 bride came up the driveway to         
 Allanbank, Jeanne dashed out in front 
 of the carriage with the baby in her  
 arms, begging Sir Robert to come back 
 to her. She was killed but the baby   
 survived. From then on her ghost was  
 said to haunt Allanbank. Sometimes her
 voice was to be heard; other people   
 claim to have heard the rustle of her 
 dress or even actually to have seen   
 her apparition. Allanbank became an   
 unhappy house and nothing ever went   
 well for the Stuart family there      
 again. Today, Allanbank lies in ruins,
 but the memory of Pearlin Jean lives  
 on.                                   
                                       </content>
