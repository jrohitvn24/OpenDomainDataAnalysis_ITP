		<content>{Auchterhouse School}was built in 1926.
 The first Headteacher or Dominie at   
 the school was{Mr. Ramsay.}On the     
 first day there were only 59 pupils   
 present out of the 72 on the roll.    
 Apparently there was an outbreak of   
 whooping cough. Most pupils had to    
 walk two or three miles to school     
 because they came from distant farms. 
 There were only twenty houses in the  
 village. School started at 9:30 am,   
 because of the distance many of the   
 pupils had to walk, and finished at   
 4:00 pm.The toilets were outside.     
 There was, in front of the school, a  
 wall from the school down to the end  
 of the playground dividing the girls' 
 side from the boys' side. There are   
 two people in{Auchterhouse}who were at
 school when it first opened. Pupils   
 started at five years of age and      
 continued until they were fourteen.   </content>
