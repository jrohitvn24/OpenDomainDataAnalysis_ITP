		<title>17The Day of a Primary Pupil</title>
		<content>  I am woken by my alarm at about{7-15 
 but do not immediately get up. When I 
 do arise at about{7-30}I often listen 
 to the radio or read a book until it  
 is time to leave for school at{8-30.} 
  At school in the morning we write out
 our spelling, do 'Top Ten Mental' and 
 Maths. We have a break at{10-30}and   
 then do our reading programme until   
 lunch at{12-05.}I have a school dinner
 and play until the break ends at{1-00.
 We do not have a set pattern to the   
 afernoon but we usually do English,   
 SRA or something like that until{3-30.
  When I go home I do my spelling and  
 read or watch TV until teatime. On a  
 Tuesday I set off with my dad in the  
 car to go to my tap and modern dancing
 class in the village. The class begins
 at{6-00}and finishes at{7-00.}On my   
 return home I practice my dance steps 
 watch TV or read until bed at{10-00.  </content>
