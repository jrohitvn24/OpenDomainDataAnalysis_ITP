		<content> IN LARKHALL THERE ARE ABOUT 14 HOUSES 
 WHICH USE SOLAR ENERGY.THEY ARE IN THE
 AREA OF LARKHALL CALLED STRUTHERHILL. 
 THE SYSTEM IN THE CONSISTS OF PANELS  
 IN THE ROOF WHICH ABSORB HEAT FROM THE
 SUN.THE PANELS HEAT UP AND THE HEAT   
 MIXES WITH THE AIR AND THIS HEAT GOES 
 ROUND THE HOUSE.EACH ROOM HAS A VENT  
 WHERE THE HOT AIR COMES OUT.WHEN THERE
 IS NOT ENOUGH SUN TO HEAT THE HOUSES  
 ,THE GAS OR ELECTRICITY TURNS ON      
 AUTOMATICALLY.THERE IS ALSO A SEPARATE
 METHOD IN THE WINTER WHICH HEATS THE  
 WATER.   THIS SYSTEM IS ALSO CONNECTED
 TO THE GAS AND ELECTRICITY WHICH HEATS
 THE HOUSE IF THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SUN. 
 MOST OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THESE    
 HOUSES ARE OLD AGE PENSIONERS AND THEY
 FOUND THE SOLAR ENERGY MUCH CHEAPER   
 THAN THE GAS AND ELECTRICITY          
 ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER.
