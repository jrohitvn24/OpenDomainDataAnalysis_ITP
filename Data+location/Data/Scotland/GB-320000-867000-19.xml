		<title>19SPYNIE LEGEND LOSSIEMOUTH</title>
		<content>  In the southern part of our block    
 there used to be a loch called Loch   
 Spynie. A ferry used to cross where   
 the Salterhills farm is now. The      
 loch was drained just over one hundred
 and fifty years ago by the famous     
 Scottish engineer, Thomas Telford. Now
 it is just marshy ground. Perhaps it  
 would have been better left as a loch.
            {The Legend                
  Scotland has many legends-Morayshire 
 has some of its own. The legend of Sir
 Robert Gordon and the Devil has been  
 passed down by word of mouth for three
 centuries. One misty November day the 
 Laird arranged to meet with his factor
 in Elgin. In order to get to Elgin he 
 had to cross Loch Spynie by ferry or  
 go all the way round past Duffus.
