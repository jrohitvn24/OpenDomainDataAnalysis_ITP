		<content>       Ferness lies within Ardclach    
 Parish. It has no church of its own   
 but the community was able to attend  
 Ardclach Church across the River      
 Findhorn, using a footbridge (which   
 unfortunately was washed away in      
 1958). A church was first built on the
 river's bank in 1626, but has been    
 replaced twice and renovated in 1892. 
 It has no bell tower, but a bell was  
 placed on an old watchtower/prison    
 (which was built in 1655 and is now   
 designated an ancient monument) high  
 on a hill nearby. It was said that the
 noise of the river's torrent would    
 have drowned out any bell ringing on  
 the church itself.                    
    A second United Free church was    
 built around 1844 but the             
 congregations were united in 1933 and 
 the old church has fallen into disuse.
 Ardclach is now merged with Auldearn. </content>
