 at Foresterhill. The Aberdeen Royal

 Children's Infirmary has 176 beds and 
 the Maternity Hospital has 130        
 beds.There is a new Central Store     
 which is computerized. It keeps       
 medicine, blankets etc. The Medical   
 School is on the site. It trains young
 doctors and nurses and there is the   
 Pharmacy which makes the medicines. In
 Aberdeen there is a hyperbaric        
 unit. It deals with North Sea divers  
 who may get the bends. There are      
 hospitals spread along Deeside too.It 
 is the biggest hospital complex in    
 Scotland.
