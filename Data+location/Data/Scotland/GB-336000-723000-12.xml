		<content> There is no doctor's surgery in       
 Gauldry or Balmerino.The nearest      
 surgery is in Newport which is 4 miles
 away.This is very inconvenient for    
 patients who do not have a car as     
 there is only one bus in and out of   
 the village each day.There is a group 
 practice of doctor's in Newport of 5  
 doctors and they cover Wormit,Newport,
 Tayport,Gauldry,Balmerino and also    
 some patients in Leuchars.            
 At the moment there is a strong       
 campaign being fought by several      
 families to have a monthly clinic held
 in the village for the children from  
 birth to 5 years.Discussions with the 
 Health Authorities are underway but   
 progress is very slow.The health      
 visitor contacted the school and the  
 Headteacher,Mrs.Balfour has agreed to 
 provide a school room once a          
 month.There is no decision yet.       </content>
