		<content> WE INTERVIEWED MR. KIERNAN WHO IS A   
 TEACHER IN SACRED HEART SCHOOL. HE WAS
 ONCE A PUPIL HERE. WHEN HE STARTED AT 
 THIS SCHOOL IN 1960 HE WAS IN PRIMARY 
 7 AND THERE WERE FEW PUPILS. IN       
 PRIMARIES 5 AND 6 THERE WERE ONLY     
 ABOUT 10 CHILDREN. THERE WAS ONLY ONE 
 TEACHER, MR. FRAZER, WHO HAD BEEN     
 HEADMASTER FOR 6 MONTHS. ANOTHER      
 TEACHER CAME IN ABOUT 2 MONTHS.       
 THERE WERE NO TRIPS ABROAD, AND ONLY A
 FOOTBALL CLUB WHICH WAS MADE UP FROM  
 PRIMARIES 5,6 &amp; 7. THEY DID NOT HAVE A
 JANITOR FOR MOST OF THE DAY SINCE HE  
 LIVED IN DUMBARTON AND HAD TO TRAVEL  
 TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY. THE PRIMARY 7    
 PUPILS HAD TO HELP CARRY IN DESKS AND 
 STAMP BOOKS. THERE WAS HARDLY ANY     
 EQUIPMENT IN THE SCHOOL BUT EACH PUPIL
 HAD PENCILS, RULERS ETC. THE CHILDREN 
 THOUGHT THAT THE RULES WERE VERY      
 STRICT THEN.                          </content>
