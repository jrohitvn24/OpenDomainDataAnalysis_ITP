		<content> The crops need care if they are going 
 to live.  Potatoes,barley,turnips and 
 wheat all need sprayed against        
 diseases which they are most likely to
 get.  Barley and wheat need sprayed   
 against mildew, potatoes need sprayed 
 against blight,and turnips need       
 sprayed against flea beetles.  The    
 wheat and barley also need sprayed    
 against twitch which is a kind of weed
 that spreads easily.                  
                                       
 THE GRAIN CYCLE                       
 First the farmers plough the land to  
 kill all the weeds,then harrow it to  
 loosen soil,then sow the seeds with   
 a dibbler then harrow it again,then   
 roll it.When its ready to harvest,    
 farmers combine the crop and cart in  
 the grain in a trailer to the auger   
 which puts the grain in a bin for     
 storage.                              </content>
