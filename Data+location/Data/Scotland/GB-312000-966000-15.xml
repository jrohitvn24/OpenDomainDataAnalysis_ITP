		<title>15SPECIAL HOUSING FOR O.A.P.s</title>
		<content>   In the{Springpark}area of{Thurso    
 there are 34 specially designed houses
 for retired people. There are 40      
 residents aged from 60 to 89 years,   
 and though most of them are house     
 bound the oldest gentleman of 89 still
 drives a car.                         
   Mrs. Carter, the warden, is on call 
 24 hours a day but has help from a    
 relief warden 2 days a week. At about 
 9a.m. she visits all the houses to    
 check that everyone is alright.       
   If they wish to alert the warden the
 tenants have a bell in each house     
 which rings in the wardens home. There
 is a box on the wall with each house  
 number in it and the number of the    
 house lights up when the bell starts  
 ringing. In case of emergency the     
 warden has a key for every house.     
   The residents are very happy but    
 would like a common room to meet in.  </content>
