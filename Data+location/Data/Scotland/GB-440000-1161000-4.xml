		<content> The Voe Agricultural Show is an annual
 event which is held in August.Anyone  
 from the district can enter animals,

 and vegetables into the show. The     
 entries are displayed in the hall,a   
 nissen hut and three tents.250 pens   
 are available to house the animals.   
 The best entries are rewarded with    
 cups,shields and money prizes.        
 Altogether there are 30 cups and      
 shields to be won.                    
 A variety of side shows are provided  
 for the children.Pony rides are a     
 great attraction as is the sheep      
 shearing competition and the tug of   
 war.                                  
 The Voe Show restarted in 1981 after a
 lapse of 50 years and is now one of   
 the main events of the summer.People  
 flock from all over Shetland on that  
 day for a very enjoyable outing.      </content>
