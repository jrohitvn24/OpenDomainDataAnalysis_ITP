    Next to the Ashgrove Filling       
 Station stands a licensed self-service
 cafe.                                 
    Many of its customers are regulars 
 who enjoy eating a meal in a rural    
 setting. One regular literally drops  
 in, by helicopter, once a fortnight.  
 This caused quite a sensation at first
 but is now treated as normal.         
    No special facilities are provided 
 for disabled people, but the doors are
 wide enough to take a wheelchair.  A  
 busload of disabled calls regularly   
 and have no problems.                 
    The dishes served are all home     
 cooked and home-made scones and cakes 
 are served with afternoon tea.        
   It is usually with an evening meal  
 that customers avail themselves of the
 opportunity of having a drink.        </content>
