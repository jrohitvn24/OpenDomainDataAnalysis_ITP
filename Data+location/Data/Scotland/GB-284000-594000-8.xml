		<content>   The police station in Thornhill has 
 six policemen - 5 constables and 1    
 sergeant who work a shift system. They
 have only one police car but share the
 patrolling of the area with cars from 
 the police headquarters in Sanquhar.  
 The local force covers the area       
 between Enterkinfoot in the north,    
 Auldgirth in the south, Moniaive in   
 the west and Strathclyde border in the
 east.                                 
   Crime in the area was described as  
 "mainly petty" with occasional        
 "break-ins" and the odd "drunken      
 brawl". Criminals are taken, after    
 charging, to the cells at Thornhill   
 where there is no overnight           
 accommodation. Prisoners requiring to 
 be detained are taken to Dumfries to  
 be dealt with.
