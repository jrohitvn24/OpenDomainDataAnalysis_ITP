		<title>20DOMESDAY WRITERS IN GLENLUCE</title>
		<content> These pages of text on Glenluce were  
 written by the children of{Glenluce   
{Primary School.}There are five classes
 and each class undertook to research  
 several aspects of life in the D block
 Only two classes needed to make field 
 trips, to find out about the{SSSI}and 
 residential parts of the block. Most  
 of the other information was collated 
 from questionnaires which children    
 took round the school, and from the   
 ordnance survey maps of the area. Help
 was also received from the geography  
 department of Stranraer Academy. {P6&amp;7
 children and staff did all the typing 
 in of information. The Domesday       
 Project was undertaken in June, 1985, 
 in the midst of a very busy month     
 which included an intensive swimming  
 course for P7, outings to Calderpark  
 Zoo, the Magnum at Irvine and the     
 Royal Highland Show at Edinburgh.     </content>
