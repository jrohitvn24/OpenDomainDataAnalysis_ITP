		<content>   Uryside is a farm of 170 acres lying
 in the flood plain of the River Ury.  
 Formerly part of the nearby Keith Hall
 estate, it has belonged since 1902 to 
 the Adam family.  The present owner,  
 Edward Adam, has farmed Uryside for   
 the last 15 years.  Its situation near
 the Ury means that the soil produces  
 an abundance of lush green grass to   
 support his pedigree herd of 80 Dutch 
 Friesians.  Mr Adam also grows barley 
 and turnips, both for winter fodder.  
   Mr Adam has a herring bone milking  
 parlour.  His daily yield is on       
 average 1400 litres (15 litres per    
 cow) which is taken by tanker to the  
 Twin Spires Creamery at Bucksburn in  
 Aberdeen.                             
   Bull calves are fed on barley until 
 they are fourteen months old and      
 slaughtered.
