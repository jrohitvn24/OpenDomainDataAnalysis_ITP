		<content>{SIZE-}THE POPULATION OF CARDROSS IS   
 AROUND 2,500 BUT, OF THESE, ONLY 400  
 LIVE IN OUR SECTION OF THE MAP. THE   
 POPULATION GREW RAPIDLY DURING THE    
 LAST 20 YEARS BUT BUILDING HAS NOW    
 ALMOST COME TO A STANDSTILL.          
{COMPOSITION -}THE OUTLYING FARMS AND  
 HOUSES ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 70 PEOPLE.   
 COUNCIL HOUSES HOUSE A FURTHER 100 OR 
 SO AND THE REMAINING 250 LIVE IN NEW  
 PRIVATE HOUSES.                       
 VERY FEW ARE NATIVE CARDROSSIANS!     
{AGE-}THIS IS A VILLAGE OF YOUNG       
 FAMILIES AND RETIRED PEOPLE, WITH A   
 DEARTH OF YOUNG PEOPLE BETWEEN THE    
 AGES OF 18_30.                        
{TURNOVER-}THERE IS PERHAPS A 10%      
 ANNUAL TURNOVER IN PRIVATE HOUSING.   
 MOVEMENT IN THE COUNCIL ESTATE IS MUCH
 SLOWER MAKING IT AN AREA OF CONTINUITY
 OF VILLAGE LIFE.
