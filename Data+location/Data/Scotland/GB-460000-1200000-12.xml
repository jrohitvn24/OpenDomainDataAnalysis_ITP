		<title>12Uyeasound Flowers.</title>
		<content> In school we decided to see which were
 the first 10 flowers to bloom in      
 Uyeasound in Spring.We started to look
 in May as flowers were beginning to   
 appear.                               
   First we found a celandine in       
 sheltered,rough grassland.Then we     
 found a dandelion and a daisy in the  
 school playground.Next in boggy       
 grassland we found a marsh            
 marigold,followed by a bluebell on a  
 grassy bank.Later we found a primrose 
 in a grassy bank,then in another      
 grassy bank we found a dog violet.    
 Above the shoreline on a grassy bank  
 we next found a red campion.The last  
 two to be found were spring squill in 
 damp grassland and lady's smock also  
 in damp grass.                        
   We sent our list to the Shetland    
 Field Studies Group to compare with   
 other Shetland schools.               </content>
