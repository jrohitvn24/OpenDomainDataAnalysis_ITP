		<title>16CROSSFORD SCOUTS: NEW HALL</title>
		<content>    The 62nd Fife (Crossford) Scout    
 Group at present use Crossford Village
 Hall for their Tuesday night meetings,
 but the village has expanded so much  
 in the past ten years that pressure of
 numbers in the Group itself, and from 
 other organisations also wanting to   
 use the village hall, have lead to    
 plans to build a new hut for the      
 Group.                                
    A site has been arranged in the    
 King George V playing fields, and now 
 the sum of Â£48,000 has to be raised.  
 Grants and loans are helping, but the 
 Group has still to find Â£6,000 itself,
 so a series of fund raising events,   
 including raffles and sponsored runs, 
 are being arranged. Hopefully soon the
 30 scouts, 24 cub-scouts and 20       
 beavers will have a regular meeting   
 place of their own.
