		<content> The market in Castle Douglas in its   
 present form was founded in 1933, and 
 is owned by a public company run by a 
 board of directors. The market itself 
 extends over 6 acres and it also owns 
 110 acres of land. It has 3 main sale 
 rings and 9 other covered areas for   
 cattle and sheep. The market employs  
 21 full time workers. It has over 500 
 pens which are used for cattle and    
 sheep.                                
 There is an average of 2 sales a week.
 Buyers come from North Aberdeen to    
 South Lincolnshire. The highest price 
 paid for any animal was for a Galloway
 Bull, Â£14,175 in 1960; in 1984 Â£9,000 
 was paid for a black-faced ram lamb.  
 The wierdest thing the market has sold
 is a 5 legged sheep.
