 In the schoolyard we play many games. 
 These are:Poison,45 Bust-Off,High and 
 Low Tig, Rounders,British Bulldog,Ten 
 Passes,Hopscotch,Elastics and         
 Port-Starboard. Our favourite games   
 are 45 Bust-Off, High and Low Tig and 
 Port-Starboard.  In some games,the    
 boys and girls play together,such as  
 Elastics and British Bulldog.  Poison 
 is always a girls' game in our school 
 and Two-man Hunt a boys' game.        
 Football and Netball are team games   
 which we play in an Inter-Primary     
 School League during the last term of 
 the school session.                   
    At home we play some of our school-
 yard games as well as others such as  
 Marbles and Halt.
