		<title>11SPORT IN CROY</title>
		<content> Croy is not really a very             
 sporting village,although once every  
 year Croy Primary School holds a day  
 of events,such as running,sack        
 race,egg and spoon,and three legged   
 races.The three teams are{red,blue,and
{yellow}competing for a trophy.At      
 the end everyone gets ice cream.      
 There is also a small Croy Football   
 Team,who practise every Thursday in   
 the hope of getting a game against a  
 nearby school,but because of bad      
 weather and other reasons,they have   
 not had a chance to show their skill. 
 The Croy Youth Club is just starting  
 up a hockey team for their members,and
 anyone else who is interested in this 
 game,which is played with a club,and a
 small,flat object called a puck.
