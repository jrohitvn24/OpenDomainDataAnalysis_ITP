		<content> MOST PEOPLE USED PEAT AS FUEL.HOUSES  
 HAVE PEAT RIGHTS, THAT IS THE RIGHT TO
 CUT PEAT.SHETLAND HAS A DIFFERENT     
 METHOD FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE        
 COUNTRY.THIS IS THE METHOD USED IN    
 OUR AREA.FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO FLAE
 THE LAND WITH A RIPPER THAT IS DE TURF
 THE PEAT BANK THEN YOU HAVE TO CUT THE
 PEAT WITH A TUSHKAR,PILING THE PEAT   
 INTO A WALL AND LEAVING IT TO DRY     
 ENOUGH TO HANDLE.THE NEXT STAGE IS TO 
 RAISE THEM INTO LITTLE PILES TO       
 COMPLETE THE DRYING PROCESS.SOME      
 PEOPLE TAKE THEM TO THEIR HOUSES IN A 
 KISHIE, AN OLD STYLE BASKET. THE      
 MODERN METHOD IS TAKING THEM HOME ON A
 TRACTOR AND TRAILER AND BUILDING A    
 PEAT STACK CLOSE TO THE HOUSE.PEAT HAS
 A DISTINCTIVE SMELL AND IS USED       
 WIDELY.INCLUDING PUTTING THE PEAT ON  
 THE FIRE YOU SHOULD HAVE HANDLED EACH 
 PEAT SEVEN TIMES.                     </content>
