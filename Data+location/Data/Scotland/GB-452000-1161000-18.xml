		<title>18PEAT-FUEL FOR BURNING 2/2</title>
		<content>  After the heaps of peat have dried   
 enough,this may take 3-5 weeks        
 depending on the weather,then the peat
 is ready to take home.Most people bag 
 the peat up before loading it onto    
 trailers pulled by tractors.Some load 
 loose peats straight into the trailer.
  Once back home the peats are stored  
 either in a stack,built carefully so  
 that rain runs off and does not soak  
 into the stack or it may be tipped out
 into a shed or store known as a       
 'peattie hoose'.                      
  The best peat ,which is like soft    
 butter and a light brown colour when  
 cast,turns black and very hard when   
 dry. Peat with fibre through it will  
 burn also when dry but will not give  
 out so much heat. Fibre and roots in  
 peat is locally called 'horse-flesh'  
 and is much more difficult to cast!   
 Hands may blister casting this type!  </content>
