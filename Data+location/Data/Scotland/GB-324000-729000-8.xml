		<title>08THE BUTCHER IN ABERNYTE</title>
		<content> The travelling Butcher who comes to   
 most parts of our area on Tuesdays and
 Fridays is called Joe.He is very      
 friendly and drives a van for Scott   
 Brothers of Dundee.In his van he has a
 chopping board,fridge and cold        
 cabinet.He cuts the amount of meat    
 that people ask for from large joints.
 When he arrives he toots his horn so  
 everybody knows he's there.You can    
 only get about four people in his van 
 at once because the counter goes right
 across the middle of the van.The door 
 that you enter is the passengers side.
 Joe sells all kinds of butcher meat   
 like bacon,beef,lamb,mince and pork.  
 When he has some spare bones he gives 
 them to the people that have dogs.    
 He does not do as much trade as he    
 used to do since many people have     
 freezers or buy their meat in the     
 town.The most popular sale is mince.  </content>
