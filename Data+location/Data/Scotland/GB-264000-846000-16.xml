		<content> The bridge was built near the route of
 the ferry boats which once connected  
 Inverness to the Black Isle.It is part
 of the A.9.from Perth to the oil      
 construction yards at Nigg and        
 Kishorn.E.E.C.money helped to pay for 
 it.The Queen Mother opened it on a    
 very wet day in August 1982.It looks  
 very grand and majestic,towering above
 the Firth like a guardian.Thousands   
 drive over it to the North.           
 The Black Isle people find it much    
 easier to get to work now.A new       
 shopping centre and supermarkets have 
 popped up to serve more customers.The 
 villages are quieter.Their shops have 
 suffered,some are closing.People can  
 now go to Eden Court Theatre and      
 hotels in the evening by car.         
 The old ferry pier is sprouting weeds.
 Older people liked the ferry better.It
 was easier to walk down to the ferry. </content>
