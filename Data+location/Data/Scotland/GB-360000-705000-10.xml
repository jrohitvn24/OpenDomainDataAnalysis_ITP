		<content> Since Crail has two beaches, the      
 children enjoy themselves there in    
 Summer, or hire bikes, while the      
 adults can play golf at the nearby    
 Balcomie Golf Course and several      
 others; or go for walks along the     
 coast to St. Andrews or to            
 Anstruther.Birdwatching is popular.   
 There are many kinds of sea birds, and
 the usual field and meadow species.   
 There has been a colony of collared   
 doves since 1963.  A bowling club with
 rinks is open to visitors.  Tennis and
 putting are availble with             
 clubs,racquets and balls supplied.

 gardening, there is Bingo and the odd 
 Coffee Evening.  Boats sail from the  
 harbour to the May Island.
