		<content> This area has many interesting        
 features-farmland,villages,variety of 
 housing,schools,shops,factories,health
 centre,libraries,sports centres. These
 facilities provide-food,shelter,care, 
 education,employment and recreation   
 for the people who live here. At      
 present,(1985), a Technology Park is  
 being developed. This will bring      
 industry and employment to the area.  
 Nearby, a new road system is being    
 built and the main Dundee-Perth road  
 will now by-pass Invergowrie village. 
 Although employment here is good now, 
 unemployment is widespread,making more
 time available for leisure. Here there
 is a choice of football,bowling,indoor
 games at the new Lynch Centre, a wide 
 variety of clubs and classes at the   
 Community Centre and libraries for    
 those who enjoy reading.
