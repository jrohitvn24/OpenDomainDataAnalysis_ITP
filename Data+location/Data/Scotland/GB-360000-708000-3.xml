		<title>03FIFE NESS COASTGUARD STATION</title>
		<content> The Fife Ness Coastguard Sation is    
 situated approximately three miles    
 from the town of Crail. The Coast-    
 guard station was built in l975.      
 Employed at the coastguard station are
 five coastguards and five auxiliary   
 workers. The coastguards have to train
 for nine months.  They learn all about
 cliff rescue equipment, must know all 
 about ships and communications.  In   
 the coastguard station itself, it is  
 equipped with very up-to-date         
 equipment such as the Telex Machine,a 
 machine which transmits pictures on to
 paper and computers.  There is a      
 lighthouse about l00 yards from the   
 coastguard station and this replaced  
 the North Carr Lightship. The Fife    
 Ness Coastguard Station is also a     
 weather station.
