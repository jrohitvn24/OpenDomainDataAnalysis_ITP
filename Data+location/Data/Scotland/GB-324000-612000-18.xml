		<title>18WILDLIFE IN ETTRICK VALLEY.</title>
		<content>    The wildlife in our part of the    
 valley is plentiful.Since all the     
 trees have been planted such a lot of 
 different birds and animals have      
 multiplied.                           
    When the fish come up from the sea 
 you see quite a lot of herons, mink   
 and goosanders chatching trout and    
 salmon.                               
    After all of the sheep were taken  
 off the trees were planted and the    
 grass grew for the mice to eat.Plenty 
 of mice get eaten by the kestrels and 
 owls.                                 
    Foxes and deer roam around the     
 forests looking for something to eat. 
 You see some of the foxes and deer at 
 the edge of the forests where the     
 grass is thick and green.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
