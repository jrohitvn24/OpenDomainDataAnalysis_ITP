		<content> Our Domesday Block lies mostly within 
 the Parish of Boharm, with a small    
 section to the South within the Parish
 of Botriphnie.                        
 It is situated in the North_East of   
 Scotland in the Eastern part of Moray 
 district, which is in the Western part
 of Grampian Region. Before the        
 re_organisation of local government   
 in 1975, it was within the central    
 part of the County of Banffshire.     
 The road through this area is the A95 
 Class 1 Road from Banff to Grantown_on
 _Spey.  It runs from Keith to Mulben, 
 and crosses the River Spey some miles 
 to the West.                          
 To the north of the area lies the hill
 of Mulderie _311 metres above sea     
 level.The upper slopes have been      
 planted by the Forrestry Commission.  
 There are 14 farms in our Block _with 
 mixed farming mostly being done.      </content>
