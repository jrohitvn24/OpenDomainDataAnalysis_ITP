		<content> The Sausage Sizzle was on the 31st May
 1985 in the evening.It was in aid of  
 the new children's play group in      
 Springholm. Money was raised by       
 selling tickets, sausages and playing 
 games. One game was "roll the penny"  
 where you roll money down a board and 
 if it lands on a line then you lose   
 the money but if it lands on a square 
 you keep all the money. Another game  
 for small children involved throwing  
 discs over small prizes and you would 
 win whatever you covered. There was a 
 similar game for adults where you     
 could win bottles of beer and wine.   
 From 6.00 pm to 7.00 pm was a throw   
 the wellie competition. At 7.00 pm the
 races started. The sausages were      
 donated by shop and generous people.It
 was expected 15 children will attend  
 the new playgroup in the primary twice
 a week.300 pounds were raised.        </content>
