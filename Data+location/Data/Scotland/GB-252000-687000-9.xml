		<content>    There are 58 teachers and 27 others
 working in the{High School.}Despite   
 its relatively small size, by town    
 standards, pupils are offered a wide  
 range of subjects and achieve very    
{high results}in S.C.E. Examinations. A
 high proportion of senior pupils go to
 universities and colleges.            
    The school has a "special-unit" for
 handicapped children and those in need
 of remedial help.                     
    A wide range of{clubs,}societies,  
 sports and pastimes are held, usually 
 during lunch times, to suit those     
 travelling by bus.                    
    Plays, musicals and concerts are   
 produced and performed regularly, much
 to the delight of parents and friends.
    The school{swimming pool}is well   
 used throughout the day by pupils and 
 children from all local primaries are 
 taught swimming in the summer term.   </content>
