		<content> The Newport area has a high standard  
 of living. There are several hotels   
 and cafes where snacks, bar lunches   
 and evening meals are served. A new   
 pub is presently being built in       
 Wormit. One of the hotels holds discos
 at the weekends and other             
 organisations hold discos for children
 and adults. People can play fruit     
 machines and space invaders in the    
 hotels. Newport has a carry out fish  
 and chip shop whose speciality is     
 frogs legs.                           
  There is a hairdresser which has an  
 excellent reputation for fashionable  
 hairstyles. People come from all over 
 to have their hair done there. As for 
 fashionable clothes most people buy   
 them in Dundee as there are no fashion
 shops in Newport.
