		<title>12Brechin In The 1980's-2</title>
		<content>  I like Pop Music but Brechin does not
 have a large  enough Population to    
 have Pop Concerts.There is sometimes a
 Disco at the City Hall but it is not  
 always very good .I wish that we could
 have better Discos. Brechin does have 
 a Cinema but it is rather old and it  
 does not have up to date equipment.   
 All the new Films which come out are  
 shown in the large cities first, which
 means we do not get to see them until 
 a while after they're out.Brechin does
 have a B.M.X. Track which is a        
 facility that is enjoyed by the boys  
 especially those with a B.M.X. Bike.
