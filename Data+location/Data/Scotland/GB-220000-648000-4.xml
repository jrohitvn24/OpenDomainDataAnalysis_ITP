		<content>   There is a true story about a small 
 house in{Portencross}where there was a
{MURDER. }A lady called the Beauty of  
 Beith (a town approx. 15 miles from   
 West Kilbride) was shot by a man who  
 later shot himself. The motive is     
 still unknown. The cottage is now used
 as a subject for painting.            
 At{Easter we go up Law Hill to have a 
{religious service.}It is a joint      
 church and congregational decision.   
 During the service children roll their
 Easter eggs down the hill which       
 symbolises the stone being rolled     
 away on the first Easter. They also   
 have a large cross at the hill-top.   
 Down at the{Teachers Centre}in{Seamill
 there is a{ghost called the White     
{Lady.}Many people say they have seen  
 her floating about the door of the    
 centre. This has not been proven to be
 true.                                 </content>
