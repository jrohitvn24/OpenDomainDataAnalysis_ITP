		<title>11PRONY HILL FARM: SUMMER</title>
		<content> In May turnips are sown and grass more
 than 7 or 8 years old is resown.Ferti-
 lisers are used to increase yields.At 
 the end of May the sheep go to the    
 hill.The farmer can relax a little in 
 June.But there are still jobs to be   
 done-mending fences,drainage,spraying.
 In early Jul the fleece of the ewe is 
 clipped. The sheep are gathered and 2 
 people catch the sheep to be sheared. 
 Another will make a new keel mark and 
 pack fleeces.Jul is also when the hay 
 is made.With modern turners and balers
 this can be done quickly in good weat-
 her.Soon after clipping the sheep are 
 dipped to stop flies laying eggs which
 turn to maggots and can literally eat 
 the sheep.It also controls sheep scab.
 At the end of Aug the lambs are separ-
 ated to allow the ewes to get strong  
 before winter.Some lambs are sold in  
 Aug and Sep but most of them go in Oct</content>
