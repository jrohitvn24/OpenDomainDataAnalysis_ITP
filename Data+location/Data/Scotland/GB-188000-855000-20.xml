		<title>20Liathach,Torridon Mountain</title>
		<content> Liathach,(grey one)3,456ft,dominates  
 the village of Torridon.It is mostly  
 red Torridonian sandstone with loose  
 scree and a quartzite summit.Buttress 
 formations sandstone bands are easily 
 seen.These mountains are around 750   
 million years old and of interest to  
 climbers, geologists and naturalists. 
 There are easy walks up Liathach,but  
 also climbs that challenge experienced
 mountaineers.Sometimes the rocks can  
 be heard thundering down the slopes.  
 About a hundred years ago a landslip &amp;
 flood engulfed the clachan, destroying
 the houses.The people fled,but had not
 time to free all their livestock,which
 lived in the same buildings. The new  
 settlement was rebuilt nearer the sea.
 Vegetation is sparse,mostly shrubs,low
 growing plants &amp; heathers,which give a
 purple haze in autumn,while in summer,
 ubiquitous bracken gives a green cover</content>
