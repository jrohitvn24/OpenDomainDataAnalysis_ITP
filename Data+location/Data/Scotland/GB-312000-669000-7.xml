		<title>07RATHO SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    PRIOR TO 1982 RATHO PRIMARY SCHOOL 
 WAS SITUATED IN A VICTORIAN BUILDING. 
 IN MARCH 1983 THE NEW PRIMARY SCHOOL  
 WAS OPENED BY COUNCILLER GILCHRIST.   
 THE NEW SCHOOL IS A SEMI OPEN PLAN    
 TYPE AND HAS A ROLE OF ABOUT 190      
 PUPILS AND EIGHT TEACHERS. THE SCHOOL 
 HAS THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE FIRST
 LOTHIAN REGION PRIMARY SCHOOL TO HAVE 
 COST OVER ONE MILLION POUNDS.         
    WHEN PUPILS LEAVE RATHO PRIMARY    
 SCHOOL THEY ATTEND BALERNO HIGH       
 SCHOOL. THIS SCHOOL IS SOME DISTANCE  
 AWAY AND THEREFORE THE PUPILS HAVE TO 
 BE BUSSED. MOST PUPILS AT HIGH SCHOOL 
 DO NOT MIND THE JOURNEY BUT THEY FEEL 
 THAT IT MAKES THE SCHOOL DAY MUCH     
 LONGER.                               
    ATTACHED TO THE PRIMARY SCHOOL IS  
 THE COMMUNITY CENTRE WHICH HAS A      
 COFFEE BAR,PLAY GROUP,YOUTH CLUB,     
 BADMINTON AND MANY OTHER FACILITIES.  </content>
