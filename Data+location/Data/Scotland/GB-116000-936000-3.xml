		<content>  In Bernera we have our own district  
 nurse who lives in the community.The  
 nurse's cottage is right next to the  
 surgery so that if there is an        
 emergency she isn't too far away. When
 the nurse is on holiday or has days   
 off, a relief nurse comes in her      
 place.                                
  The surgery is centrally placed so   
 that it is easy to reach.             
  The doctor lives in Uig which is 23  
 miles away. He comes to Bernera twice 
 a week, on Tuesdays and on Fridays.Our
 Doctor makes some of his own medicines
 and he buys the rest at the suppliers 
 in Stornoway which is 26 miles away.  
  When the doctor comes to Bernera he  
 does house calls in the morning and   
 has surgery in the afternoon.
