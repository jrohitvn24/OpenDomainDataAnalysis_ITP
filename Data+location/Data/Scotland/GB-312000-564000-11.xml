		<content>   Most of the houses in Cummertrees   
 are traditional cottages, but on the  
 outskirts ,there starts an unusual    
 terrace of houses, which are 3 storeys
 high,called Queensberry Terrace,built 
 by General Edward Brooke of Kinmount. 
 Across the road from these is a war   
 time shelter,built for the tenants of 
 the terrace.                          
                                       
 POWFOOT                               
        In the 1790s, Powfoot was a    
 hamlet of fisherman's houses ( which  
 still remain and are called 'White    
 Row').   There was also a harbour     
 from which grain was shipped.  This   
 came from all the surrounding farms.  
 Powfoot was then also a fishing       
 harbour.There were houses on either   
 side of the Pow.The house now called  
 Bridge Cottage was where the grain was
 stored before being shipped out.      </content>
