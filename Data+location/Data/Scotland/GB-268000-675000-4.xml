      After the crowning  ceremony     
 come races ,penalty kicks competition 
 and five-a-side football competitions.
      This year my team won by two     
 goals to nil. Calum from the other    
 team was slide tackling and nearly    
 broke Jason's leg.                    
      We got a trophy and the          
 runner's-up got some money.           
                                       
                                       
      Later on there was an open-air   
 disco. As well as dancing there was a 
 competition for knobbly knees with    
 records as prizes.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
