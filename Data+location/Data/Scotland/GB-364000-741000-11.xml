		<content> We do lots of different things in a   
 school week.We start every day with   
 the Lord's Prayer. Most days, several 
 assignments are put on the blackboard 
 with separate headings for P.5,6,and7.
 We are allowed to do these in any     
 order but some are marked with a green
 cross which means they have to be done
 first.These assignments could include 
 one hour of Maths,a spelling exercise 
 a geography or history card;'tables'. 
    Other lessons during the week,     
 include handwriting,reading groups,   
 science or nature, art and            
 craft,sewing or knitting.             
 On Thursdays we do P.E. in the village
 hall but the P.E. teacher  Mrs.Beattie
 only comes every second week . On     
 Tuesday afternoons we have Art with   
 Mrs Thomlinson from 2.30  p.m till    
 3.30. On Friday we have music with    
 Mrs.Neal                              </content>
