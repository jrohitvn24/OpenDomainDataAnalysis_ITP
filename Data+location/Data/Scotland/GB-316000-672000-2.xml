		<title>02CAMMO ESTATE</title>
		<content> Cammo Estate was first recorded in the
 14th Century and after many years of  
 development and change it was feud to 
 Edinburgh District Council in 1980.   
 The Estate consists of about 75 acres 
 of farmland and 25 acres of woodland. 
 It is intended that it will be        
 developed as wildlife woodland in a   
 parkland setting which may be enjoyed 
 by the general public and may be used 
 as a teaching resource.  Much work has
 already been done to clear the        
 dereliction of years and tree planting
 is well under way.  The children of   
 Primary 6, Clermiston School, visited 
 the woodland to watch a special       
 ceremony at which the Lord Provost,   
 wearing his official gold chain,      
 planted a commemorative tree using a  
 silver spade.  When the tree planting 
 is complete, 20000 trees will have    
 been planted over 12 acres.           </content>
