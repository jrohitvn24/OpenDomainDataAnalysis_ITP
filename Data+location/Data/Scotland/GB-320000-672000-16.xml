		<title>16HEALTH IN EDINBURGH.</title>
		<content>  This must be a healthy area with so  
 many golf courses and open spaces-and 
 yet without so much as one well with  
 mineral waters,there are many         
 hospitals_three in a one mile stretch 
 of road and yet tucked away almost    
 unnoticed except for the 'H' sign.    
  The building style of the hospitals  
 ranges too from the classical dignity 
 of the{Corstorphine}to the reserved   
 composure of{Beechwood House}among the
 trees. Most recent addition is the    
{Murrayfield Hospital}built in 1984.It 
 is a private hospital on the grounds  
 of the Duns Scotus Academy,now        
 closed.The stone building of the      
 Academy stands proudly aloof from the 
 modern red brick new hospital.Here you
 can enjoy your ill_health with all    
 comforts provided_at Â£126 a day.The   
 view across to the Pentlands is almost
 worth it!                             </content>
