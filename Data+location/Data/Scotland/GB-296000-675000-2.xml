		<title>02Two Symbols Of Linlithgow</title>
		<content>        The Black Bitch                
 Linlithgow has two coats of arms.The  
 main one is St Michael's and the Black
 Bitch is the second one.The Black     
 Bitch pub was built in 1253 at the    
 West Port.The Black Bitch coat of arms
 was used as Linlithgow's symbol from  
 the 17th century.The symbol shows a   
 black dog and a tree and suggests that
 Linlithgow was a good place for       
 hunting.                              
                                       
         Katie Wearie's Tree           
 Katie Wearie's Tree is situated just  
 beside Billy Gray's grocer's shop at  
 the West Port.It was called Katie     
 Wearie's Tree because she used to     
 wait there on her way to market each  
 morning.The original tree was 70 years
 old and it blew down in 1910.The new  
 tree was planted in 1983.
