 The hotel is open for the "season"    
 from April to October.It has been in  
 the Campbell family since 1933.       
 The hotel was established as an inn   
 for travellers by Sir Lachlan         
 Mackinnon in 1611 and it was here     
 that Prince Charles Edward Stuart     
 presented to the Mackinnons of Skye   
 the recipe of his own personal liqueur
 the{'dram buidhe'-Drambuie}the recipe 
 of which remains secret to this day.  
 Much of the original building still   
 remains with its crow stepped gables  
 which are characteristic of Scottish  
 Architecture.
