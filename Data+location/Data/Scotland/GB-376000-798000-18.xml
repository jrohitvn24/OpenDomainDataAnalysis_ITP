		<title>18EDUCATION IN DRUMOAK</title>
		<content> The parish of Drumoak at one time     
 could boast no fewer than three       
 schools:{Glashmore School}under the   
 patronage of the Kirk Session,{Drumoak
{North School and Drumoak Central      
 School. Smaller families and less     
 pupils have meant the closure of two  
 of the schools in the 20th century.   
 The Central School now known as       
 Drumoak School is the only school left
 in the parish.                        
 The Head Teacher and staff of three   
 teachers look after a roll of 82      
 pupils divided into four classes:     
 P1/2, P3/4, P5/6 and P7. When pupils  
 have completed their Primary          
 education,they transfer at the age of 
 11-12 to{Banchory Academy Secondary   
 School six miles away. Nearly a third 
 of the pupils at Drumoak come to      
 school by bus, the remainder live in  
 the housing areas near to the school. </content>
