		<title>11The Memorial Hall, Ceres</title>
		<content>  Ceres Memorial Hall was  originally a
 church  but  it  was  converted into a
 community hall.                       
  It is used regularly in mornings  and
 evenings for various activities.      
  The  Playgroup make  use  of the hall
 on two mornings a week and the  Mother
 and Toddler group have one morning.   
  In the evenings it  is  used  by  the
 Badminton Club, the  Highland  Dancing
 Class and the Youth Club and sometimes
 there  are discos on Friday evenings. 
  Every year there is an Annual General
 Meeting  held in the  Hall to  get new
 members for the committee.            
  The letting  fees  and  the  proceeds
 from a Christmas Fete  which  is  held
 every year help to cover the  cost  of
 heating, cleaning and repairs.
