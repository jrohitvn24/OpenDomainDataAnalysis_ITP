		<title>18CRAFT INDUSTRY IN KILTARLITY</title>
		<content> HANTEL is an important cottage        
 industry in Kiltarlity.It is run by   
 Mike and Frances Wilson from Bruiach  
 House,at the edge of the village.     
 Frances designs original miniature    
 pewter figures which are handpainted  
 by local women in their homes.About 30
 "outworkers" are employed in this way.
 Hantel exports literally all over the 
 world to collectors and retailers.    
 This year the Wilsons visited U.S.A.  
 and returned with a prestigious order 
 to produce miniatures of cartoon      
 characters for Disneyland.This will be
 the first time that Francis has worked
 to someone else's design,as most of   
 her own designs are based on          
 historical or literary characters     
 such as Alice in Wonderland,The Owl   
 and the Pussycat etc.
