		<title>01Lumsden &amp; farmland to SW</title>
		<content> Block consists very largely of        
 flattish farmland at average altitude 
 of rather more than 200m above sea    
 level. Along western edge rise heather
 covered hills, although only the lower
 slopes are within the block. Along the
 eastern edge lies the road running    
 south from the village of Lumsden. Of 
 this, which has a total population of 
 about 250, more than half lies within 
 the block.                            
 In this southern part of the village  
 are a primary school, a garage        
 (including petrol pumps and repair    
 facilites) a post office which is     
 included in the garage complex, a     
 police station (one policeman) and    
 general shop. The village and farm    
 population is served by a doctor      
 living and holding his surgery in     
 Rhynie,three and a half miels away.   
 There is no industry in the village   </content>
