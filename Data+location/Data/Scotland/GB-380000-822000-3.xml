		<title>03Bourtie Kirk</title>
		<content> Records show that there ws  kirk      
 (church) in Bourtie in 1190 but the   
 present Kirk was rebuilt in 1806.  The
 Church of Scotland minister from      
 Oldmelrum, two miles away, takes      
 services here on the first and third  
 Sundays of each month and, although   
 the parishes of Bourtie and Meldrum   
 are oficially united, most of the 60  
 members of the Kirk in Bourtie attend 
 services in Bourtie, hold their own   
 harvest thanksgiving day and probide  
 their own church activities.  The     
 minister preaches from a Georgian     
 triple-decker pulpit. A small gallery 
 upstairs and oak-panelled family pews 
 downstairs provide space for around   
 100 people, but between 12 and 20     
 normally attended services, numbers   
 can be as high as 50 for Christmas and
 communion services, or for infrequent 
 wedding or christening services.      </content>
