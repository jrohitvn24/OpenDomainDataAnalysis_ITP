		<content>    From the humble origins of a       
 small kitchen where{Margaret Baxter   
 made too much jam and sold the surplus
 in the village,through{1868}when a    
 small grocery shop was opened selling 
 jams and jellies,moving in{1914}to the
 present site just West of the River   
 Spey,{Baxters}now occupy an extensive 
 factory producing over 100 different  
 varieties of fine Scottish foods.     
    Having supplied the Royal household
 at Balmoral from 1921 the firm        
 received the Royal warrent in 1960.   
    The present workforce of 550,using 
 highly mechanised methods still make  
 jams and marmalades in small copper   
 pans which hold only 120 jars and to  
 the original recipies now produce an  
 annual turnover of Â£15 million.       
    The factory is now high on the     
 itinery of the many visitors to the   
 North of Scotland.                    </content>
