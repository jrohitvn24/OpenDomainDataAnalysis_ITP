		<title>15GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content> AT SCHOOL WE PLAY LOTS OF GAMES,      
 ESPECIALLY BALL GAMES. HERE IS A LIST 
 OF MY FAVOURITE GAMES - NETBALL,      
 ROUNDERS, NON-STOP CRICKET, HOCKEY AND
 DANISH ROUNDERS. OUR SCHOOL IS A BIT  
 OVER-CROWDED SO P4 - P7 GO BY MINI-BUS
 TO WEST LINTON  SCHOOL EVERY WEDNESDAY
 FOR A GYM PERIOD. WE PLAY GAMES LIKE  
 ROUNDERS AND NETBALL. THE BOYS PLAY   
 FOOTBALL ON THE PITCH AT THE BOTTOM OF
 THE HILL. LAST YEAR WE HAD SWIMMING   
 LESSONS AT THE NEW POOL AT PEEBLES.   
 THIS YEAR WE HAD 2 GROUPS GOING TO    
 CASTLEGRAIG POOL EVERY FRIDAY.        
 SWIMMING IS GOOD FUN  AND WE ARE      
 TAUGHT LOTS OF DIFFERENT STOKES. WE   
 WORK HARD FOR CERTIFICATES AND BADGES,
 BUT WE ARE ALLOWED FREE TIME TOO, TO  
 PLAY WITH OUR FRIENDS. SOMETIMES WE   
 HAVE ACTIVITY AFTERNOONS WITH OTHER   
 SCHOOLS AND TAKE IN THE ANNUAL SPORTS 
 AT PEEBLES, WEST LINTON AND NEWLANDS. </content>
