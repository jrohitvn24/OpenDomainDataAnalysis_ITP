		<content>  Rolling farmland set amidst shelter  
 belts of trees. While there are trees 
 surviving from the 18thC              
 'improvements' many of the conifer    
 replacements have been made since     
 World War II. Farm mechanisation has  
 considerably depleted the area's      
 population. Farm cottages are quickly 
 bought by commuters when they become  
 vacant and few of the inhabitants live
 off the land. Most of the farms carry 
 a dairy herd and Friesians now        
 predominate largely replacing the once
 popular Ayrshire. The milk is produced
 either in the traditional byre or the 
 more modern milking parlour. Every    
 dairy farm has a bulk tank to hold the
 milk until collection by a road tanker
 with conveys milk to retail dairies or
 the SMMB Creamery at Bent on the      
 outskirts of Mauchline. The land is   
 used mainly for grazing with hay      </content>
