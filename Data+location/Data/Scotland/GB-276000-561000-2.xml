		<content> Carlingwark Loch is one of the main   
 attractions of Castle Douglas. The    
 name Carlingwark Loch comes from the  
 Gaelic word Caer meaning fort and wark
 is the old Scots word for work. In the
 bronze age crannogs were built in the 
 loch for fear of attack and they were 
 used as a sort of fort. Hence the word
 Caer. Somewhere in the loch there are 
 causeways leading to these sunken     
 crannogs.                             
 There are many small islands in       
 Carlinwark Loch. Sometimes when       
 festivities are held coloured lights  
 are hung round the larger islands as  
 well as round the shore of the loch.  
 The level of the loch used to rise and
 fall a lot, sometimes the loch flooded
 as far up as Marle Street.  But since 
 the Hydro Electric Power Scheme was   
 established at Glenlochar, the level  
 has been controlled. It is impossible </content>
