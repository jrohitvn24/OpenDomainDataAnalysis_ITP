		<content> The day in the life of Mark Riddell.  
 On a normal school day I would        
 get up at seven and get washed and    
 dressed and make my bed. I would have 
 my breakfast at about 7.30 which      
 consists of cornflakes or wheatabix   
 ,two bits of toast and a cup of       
 tea.After that I would wash and dry   
 the dishes.I go to school and have a  
 normal day of subjects.After three    
 fourty minute periods we have an      
 intervel.We usually go to the canteen 
 or tuckshop.Lunch is at 1.00 to 2.05  
 if I have any money left over I would 
 have a game of pool against one of my 
 friends.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
