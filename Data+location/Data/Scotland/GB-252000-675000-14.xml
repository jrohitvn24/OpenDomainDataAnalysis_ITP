		<content>{SHEEP FARMING}   In spring the lambs  
 are born and older lambs sold.When    
 summer comes they are dipped in       
 disenfectant.Also the lambs have to be
 marked,jagged and their tails cut off.
 Rams are bought  in the autumn.       
     In the winter the farmers go out  
 to the sheep to give  them food.Often 
 when lambs are born they could have   
 stiff legs or sway back and can't walk
 properly.The ones with stiff legs get 
 jagged with an antibiotic.The lambs   
 with sway back can't be cured.To      
 prevent sway back the ewes can be     
 jagged with copper before they have a 
 lamb.                                 
     On our farm my brother and I help 
 with this work.
