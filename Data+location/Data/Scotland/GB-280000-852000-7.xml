		<content> Mains of Balnagowan is owned by {     
{Stackpole Farms LTD,}but is farmed by 
 Mr S. Rochford.                       
  The farm itself is a mixed cattle    
 farm. Mr Rochford looks after 200     
 Suckler cows and 600 breeding ewes.   
  Because the cows calve in September  
 &amp; October, a 24 hour check is needed; 
  same attention is used for the ewes. 
  Quite drastic changes have occurred  
 in 20 years. Most of the old farm     
 buildings have been demolished; this  
 occurred in 1978 and now there are    
 new buildings.                        
  Another change is the amount of      
 workers on the farm; in 1960 there    
 were 50 workers, but because of the   
 new machinery,there are only 3        
 workers now.                          
  The total acreage over 30 fields is  
 480. Also, the land is Light sandy
