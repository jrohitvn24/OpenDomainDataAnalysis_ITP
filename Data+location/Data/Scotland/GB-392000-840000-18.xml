		<title>18PLANTS AND TREES</title>
		<content> As a part of the domesday project we  
 have to look at plants and trees.     
 We found a lot in rough ground round  
 about the school and beside the Barons
 football team changing rooms.         
{There were:}buttercups round about    
 trees thistle and nettles were mostly 
 round the outside of fields and banks.
 Julian from Aden country park helped  
 us identify all the flowers that we   
 found.{Forget-me-nots}were beside     
 several trees round about the outside 
 of roads and tracks.{Cow parsly:}is   
 everywhere round about the outside of 
 parks,roads,tracks and everything     
 round about Auchnagatt.{Speedwell:}   
 were quite rare they were only in     
 rough ground and in grass.Trees were  
 round about high ground and farms.
