   Mrs. Pottie keeps{horses, goats and 
{hens.}She rents the fields out to     
 people to put their horses in. In the 
 summer all the girls go on the horses.
   Recently she got two new goats      
 called Isla and Topaz; they  are from 
 a foreign country. Topaz had two kids 
 both billies. She put one down because
 it wasnt useful for making products.  
 Altogether she has got nine goats.    
 She also is an artist and her         
 paintings look as if they are real    
 life. She mostly paints landscape.    
   Mrs Pottie's husband is an          
 architect and he designed the         
 house.The house is                    
 an unusual shape; because of the      
 dining room which is two storeys      
 high Also there is a balcony, which   
 sticks out in between the dining      
 room and bedrooms.                    </content>
