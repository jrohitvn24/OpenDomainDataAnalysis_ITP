		<content> Employment in Dornoch is varied. There
 are jobs in shops, services and craft 
 workshops. The tourist trade brings   
 seasonal jobs in hotels and catering, 
 mainly for women and students. One of 
 the main local employers is Grant and 
 Sons Ltd. They employ about 50 workers
 in the slaughterhouse, mostly men, 3  
 long distance lorry drivers and 15 of 
 a staff in the supermarket. The Water 
 and Sewerage Dept. of the Council is  
 based in Dornoch. Farming and Forestry
 provide employment for men, but there 
 have been cutbacks in these areas.    
 Many small crofts cannot fully support
 a tenant so another job is needed eg. 
 with council or forestry. Many men    
 were employed in the oil construction 
 industry in Ross-shire, but were made 
 redundant. It has bseen difficult for 
 them to find jobs locally. Many young 
 people leave the area to find jobs.   </content>
