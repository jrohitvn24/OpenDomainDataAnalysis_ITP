 After Amanda and Simon left for       
 school,went to work at farm for 2     
 hours,where I help with housework.Had 
 coffee with farmer's wife.Came        
 home,tidied house,then went to        
 Kirriemuir on my moped to do some     
 shopping.After lunch spent the        
 afternoon in the garden,weeding and   
 planting bedding plants.Now time for  
 my husband to come from his work as a 
 fireman in Dundee.Made tea-fish,chips 
 and curried rice.In the evening, went 
 by car,with next door neighbour to    
 visit his wife,who is at present a    
 patient in Ninewell's Hospital,Dundee.
