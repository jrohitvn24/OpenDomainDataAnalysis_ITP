		<title>06Health Care: FINTRY</title>
		<content> While some go to doctors in Killearn  
 and Kippen, most go to the {Balfron   
{Health Centre.}This operates in a new 
 purpose built building. The practice  
 has three Doctors, a Nurse and two    
 Receptionists. A visiting surgery is  
 offered in Fintry on two afternoons a 
 week. Many people are visited at home,
 by Doctor or{District Nurse.          
{                                      
{Hospital treatment}can be arranged in 
 either Stirling or Glasgow.           
 Emergencies and patients lacking      
 transport are taken in by ambulance.  
{A Range Rover Ambulance can be used in
{bad weather (winter snow).            
{                                      
{Dental care}is available in Balfron or
 one of the nearby towns.              
                                       
 Most would agree we are well served &amp; 
 in some ways better than in the towns.</content>
