		<title>20GOOD/BYE FROM TROON 1985.</title>
		<content> We have really enjoyed this project   
 and hope that whoever reads our       
 information finds us interesting. The 
 things we children of 1985 enjoy most 
 are being happy ,being healthy, eating
 our favourite and listening to our pop
 music.We look forward to Christmas,   
 our birthdays,and the wonderful       
 moments that make us feel that we are 
 special people. The things we dread   
 are getting into trouble,death,having 
 to wear a brace, coming out in spots, 
 getting lost in a strange place and   
 the worst fear /Nucleur Wars.Our life 
 in Troon is very happy and although   
 the climate is neither too hot or too 
 cold we still enjoy many activities   
 both indoors and out.The happiest     
 times are of course spent with our    
 friends and family. Our final message 
 is a universal one,"BE PEACEFUL IN    
 YOUR WORLD.BE HAPPY IN YOUR LIFE."    </content>
