		<content> About 150-200 people attend the local 
 swimming pool, built in 1969 from     
 public contributions and recently     
 renovated. In term time the schools   
 make use of the pool. A,B,and C squads
 give extra training to young swimmers 
 and an Adult night caters for older   
 non-swimmers. For very young people   
 there's a new playpark with tyres, a  
 sandpit, house etc and decorated walls
 . The Community Centre gives indoor   
 games and is the home of the youth    
 clubs. However new facilities at the  
 new school at Garson - games room, all
 weather outdoor courts etc- are taking
 over from existing ones. A Squash     
 Court is well attended in the winter  
 time. A recently opened Games Room is 
 meant to cater for teenagers. In the  
 hotels, pool and darts are played.
