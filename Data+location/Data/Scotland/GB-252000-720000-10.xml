		<title>10BALQUHIDDER CHURCH &amp; GROUNDS</title>
		<content> In the graveyard many visitors come to
 see Rob Roy's grave. It is placed at  
 the door of the ruined church. Rob Roy
 is buried with his wife and two sons. 
 Balquhidder Church is small and seats 
 only 400 people. The old ruined church
 was once called "Eaglais Beag" or     
 little church.                        
 The new church was built by David     
 Carnegie of Stronvar and was opened in
 1855. The old church was built in 1631
 and has been partly built over the top
 of the Pre-reformation church.        
 In the summer we have many buses full 
 of tourists. Some buses come from all 
 over the world just to see Rob Roy's  
 grave.                                
 The parish is the traditional home of 
 the clan McLaren Ferguson, Macgregor  
 and Stewart of Glenbuckie.
