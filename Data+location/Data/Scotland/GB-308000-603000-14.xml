		<content>   All roads lead to Moffat! So it     
 would seem in the height of summer    
 when most of the accents of the UK,   
 the languages of Europe,the Orient and
 the inflections of N.America and      
 Australasia can be heard in and around
 the town.Why do tourists come to      
 Moffat?Since the Victorians,who came  
 in numbers to partake of the health   
 giving spring waters,this little      
 Annandale town has been a magnet for  
 visitors.Our survey has shown that    
 most visitors stay for only a few     
 hours,a day at most;many remain for a 
 few nights having discovered the      
 attractions of a rural setting.Some   
 return yearly to enjoy the tranquil   
 setting.Coach parties by the hundred  
 break their North or South journeys to
 take refreshment or visit the woollen 
 mills.The Toffee Shop home of the     
 famous Moffat Toffee attracts many.   </content>
