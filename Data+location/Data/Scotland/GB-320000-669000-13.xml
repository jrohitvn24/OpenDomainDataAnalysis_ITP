		<content>  Several of Edinburgh's older         
 graveyards have fallen into disrepair.
 Few new graves are dug nowadays, so   
 they have little current income to pay
 for maintenance. At North Merchiston  
 and at Dalry cemeteries a number of   
 headstones have been sprayed with     
 paint and others have been smashed or 
 pushed over. The grass and weeds are  
 up to 7 feet high in summer and       
 rubbish such as old sinks lie dumped  
 beside the graves. The roads through  
 the graveyards have deteriorated to   
 muddy tracks. Few people attend to the
 family graves, but only a few pounds a
 year from everybody who owned a lair  
 would be enough to employ a gardener. 
  A property developer has now offered 
 to buy the cemeteries, re-locate the  
 lairs and build houses on this land, a
 prime site, close to the city centre. 
 No doubt there will be many objections</content>
