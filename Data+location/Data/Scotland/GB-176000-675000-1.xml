		<title>01General Description Of Area</title>
		<content> This block is situated on the west    
 coast of Kintyre, reached by a        
 single_track road from the A83 joining
 Glasgow and Campbeltown. It is approx.
 10 miles from Lochgilphead the main   
 centre of the area. Two small         
 townships, Achahoish and Ormsary owned
 by 2 separate landlords are combined  
 in the block. To the N.W. is a sandy  
 estuary at the head of Loch           
 Caolisport, a sea_loch. The land rises
 from sea level to 900 feet at the S.E.
 corner and is mainly sheep_grazing,   
 although a fair proportion is         
 woodland. Population is sparse, the   
 people being employed on both estates 
 in agriculture, horticulture, forestry
 and a fish_farm. There are holiday    
 homes and chalets on both estates     
 which are very popular with tourists.
