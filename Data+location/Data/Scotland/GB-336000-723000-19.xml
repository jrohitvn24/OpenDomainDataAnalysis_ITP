		<title>19Village Mothers</title>
		<content> Very few of the mothers work outside  
 the home.Most stay at home and are    
 housewives.Those who do work,go to    
 Dundee to work or are employed in the 
 village.The local coach company       
 employs one mother who cleans the     
 buses daily.Several help in the local 
 inn,either serving snacks and drinks  
 or cleaning the premises.Quite a few  
 are home helps employed by the        
 Regional Council to help the elderly  
 or infirm with their daily chores.Our 
 school employs three ladies,a         
 caretaker,a lunch server, and a school
 crossing patrol officer. Some mothers 
 are employed,cleaning private         
 homes.The local playgroup is run by   
 mothers.One of our enterprising       
 parents travels around with her puppet
 theatre,and is in great demand.
