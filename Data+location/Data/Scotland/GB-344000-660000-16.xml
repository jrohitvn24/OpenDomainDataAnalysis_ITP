		<title>16OLD FOLK'S HOME,HUMBIE.</title>
		<content> IN OUR SQUARE THERE IS A BIG HOUSE    
 CALLED HAZYHILL.THIS USED TO BE THE   
 MANSE FOR THE FREE CHURCH BUT WHEN    
 THAT WAS DEMOLISHED THE HOUSE WAS     
 SOLD. IT WAS LIVED IN AS A HOUSE FOR A
 WHILE.                                
 THEN EARLIER THIS YEAR SOME PEOPLE    
 BOUGHT IT PLANNING TO TURN IT INTO AN 
 OLD PEOPLES HOME.THEY WERE GOING TO   
 HAVE PUTTING AND ORGANISE OUTINGS FOR 
 THE RESIDENTS.UNFORTUNATELY THIS WAS  
 NOT SUCCESSFUL AS THERE WERE  NO      
 ELDERLY PEOPLE WANTING TO LIVE        
 THERE.THIS MIGHT BE BECAUSE THERE ARE 
 STEEP HILLS,ONLY ONE SHOP AND NO OTHER
 FACILITIES FOR OLD PEOPLE.NOW IT IS UP
 FOR SALE AGAIN.
