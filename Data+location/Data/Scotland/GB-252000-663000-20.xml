		<content>  {John Elder}was born on 8 March 1824.
  He died on the 17th of September 1869
 aged only 45 years old.               
   He was an engineer and shipbuilder. 
 In 1854 he invented the compound      
 engine which halved the amount of coal
 a ship needed to carry in it's        
 bunkers.  In 1864 Elder founded the   
{Fairfield Shipbuilding Company}in     
 Govan.  Elder Park facing the upper   
 Clyde was gifted to the people of     
 Govan by{Mrs Elder}in memory of her   
 late husband.                         
   The park cost Â£50,000 and extends to
 35 acres.  It was opened on 27 June   
 1885. As a token of their appreciation
 of this action and because of her     
 husbands many outstanding qualities,  
 the Govanites erected a statue to his 
 fine achievement.  At a later date a  
 statue was erected in memory of his   
 wife.                                 </content>
