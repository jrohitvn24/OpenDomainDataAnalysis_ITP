		<title>02M.V. ISLE OF ARRAN</title>
		<content> The M.V. Isle of Arran is the car     
 ferry which serves as the island's    
 main link with the mainland.          
   She is capable of carrying 80 cars  
 or 36 cars and 10 commercial vehicles 
 or coaches and 500 passengers in the  
 summer service.                       
   The ferry cost Â£6.7m to build, was  
 launched on 12th December 1983 and    
 first called at Brodick on 5th April  
 1984.  Owned by Caledonian MacBrayne  
 who serve 22 other Scottish islands,  
 she started her service on 13th April 
 1984.                                 
   Carrying the island's supplies of   
 food, newspapers and mail, the ferry  
 takes 55 minutes to travel from       
 Ardrossan to Arran.  If, however, the 
 weather is stormy, she sails to       
 Gourock which takes approximately 2   
 hours.                                
                                       </content>
