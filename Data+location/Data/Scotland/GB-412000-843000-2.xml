		<title>02MEETHILL TOWER</title>
		<content> The Meethill school badge has a       
 picture of {Meethill Tower }on it. The
 tower is south west from the town .   
 The tower was built by local Liberals 
 to mark the  Parliamentary  reform of 
 the early 1830s.  It was originally   
 fitted up as an observatory but was   
 never properly completed.When the     
 foundations were built,they found a   
 stone crypt.Inside was an urn which   
 contained the remains of a human      
 jaw-bone with a few teeth and part    
 of a thigh-bone. There are a few      
 true stories connected with Meethill  
 Tower. Once a schoolboy was killed    
 while playing at the tower. Another   
 story is about a prisoner who         
 escaped from nearby Invernettie       
 Prison and used the tower as a        
 hide-out for 2 days, before being     
 recaptured.                           
                                       </content>
