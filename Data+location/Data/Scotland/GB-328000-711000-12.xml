		<content> Car ownership levels in N.E Fife are  
 significantly higher than for Scotland
 as a whole: viz. 65% of housholds in  
 N.E. Fife own a car, compared with 51%
 in Scotland (1981 figures).           
 High levels of car owership and a     
 scattered population make many bus    
 services an uneconomic proposition and
 subsidies are essential for the very  
 small communities. Post Bus services  
 (operated by the Post Office with a   
 Regional Council subsidy) run to      
 Collessie once a week. The majority of
 respondants to our questionaire       
 commented that public transport       
 provision was very poor in our area.  
 Trains linking Edinburgh with Perth   
 run through Collessie village. One    
 passenger train runs each day on this 
 single track line. The nearest railway
 station to Collessie is at Ladybank, 5
 km. away.                             </content>
