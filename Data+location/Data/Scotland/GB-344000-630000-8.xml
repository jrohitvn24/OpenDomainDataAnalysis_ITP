		<title>08THE NORTH MARCHES</title>
		<content> Each year a cavalcade rides the north 
 marches.  The cavalcade consists of   
 the Selkirk Standard Bearer, his      
 Attendants and about 600 horses.  This
 rideout has a history which stretches 
 over 400 years and is now more        
 symbolic than it has been.  The       
 rideouts were necessary to protect the
 towns lands and where necessary move  
 the boundary markers back to their    
 original positions.                   
 The rideout takes place on the second 
 Friday after the first Monday in June.
 The Burgh Standard is carried all the 
 way round the march.                  
 Linglie Farm on the route is still    
 owned by the town. Recent attempts to 
 sell off the land met with            
 considerable opposition from the local
 people.
