		<content> The shopping facilities in Kirkcaldy  
 and Levenmouth have a considerable    
 influence on the shopping patterns of 
 people in East Wemyss and Buckhaven.  
 This influence is reflected in the    
 significant number of boarded up shop 
 fronts, particularly in East Wemyss.  
 The shops which do exist sell mainly  
 convenience goods which are needed on 
 a daily basis. The majority of the    
 villager travel to either Kirkcaldy or
 Leven for their main weekly shopping  
 and for non-durable goods.            
 There is at least one bus every half  
 hour to Kirkcaldy or Leven so access  
 is no problem to the considerable     
 number of people without a car.       
 Rising transport costs will help to   
 maintain the importance of local shops
 selling conveince goods.
