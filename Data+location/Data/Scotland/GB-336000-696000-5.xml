		<title>05Alwyn North NAA Jacket.</title>
		<content>      The Alwyn North NAA jacket was   
 built by RGC in their yard at Methil  
 for Total Oil Marine and Elf UK.This  
 140m high steel jacket,weighing 18,500
 tonnes,now supports a drilling and    
 accommodation rig in the Alwyn North  
 Field,160km North East of Shetland.   
     On May 1 1985,it was towed by     
 barge to that position,launched and   
 upended and then fixed in place with  
 eight piles at each corner leg.These  
 were driven about 40m into the sea    
 bed to ensure stability.              
      This huge construction has       
 towered over Denbeath for almost two  
 years and, now that is has gone,people
 are missing it.                       
      Before long,however,work is to be
 started on another jacket and the     
 skyline around Denbeath will soon look
 familiar again.
