		<content> My dad makes meringues. He gets up at 
 five and starts work at six. He makes 
 the meringues of egg white and puts   
 them into a tall grey cupboard with   
 closely packed shelves. He puts that  
 into an oven that goes round in a     
 circle to make them more crunchy.     
 He comes home about 3 o'clock and     
 round about tea-time, he goes down,   
 takes them out and leaves them to     
 cool.                                 
 My dad mends the machines and makes   
 guards for them so nobody gets        
 injured. He has two assistants and his
 own workshop. There is a new factory  
 being built, so he'll have plenty more
 machines to mend.
