		<title>14Peat as fuel in Aith</title>
		<content> Peats are the main fuel for fires in  
 Shetland. They are dried pieces of    
 peat moor. In late spring people start
 to cut their peats. First they cut the
 turf from the peat bank. This is      
 called 'flaying'. Then they cut the   
 peats with a tool called a 'tushkar'. 
 They leave them to dry for about 2    
 weeks then set them up in little heaps
 called 'raisings' and leave them until
 they are dry through. The smaller     
 peats, called 'clods', are usually    
 bagged and the whole firing is taken  
 home and either stored in a shed or   
 built into a stack.                   
 Of the 75 houses in the block, 57 of  
 them burn peats as their main fuel.
