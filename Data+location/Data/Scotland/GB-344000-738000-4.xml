		<content> Not much is known about individual art
 and craft work in the area.  Apart    
 from instruction in schools, the only 
 organised programme of craft          
 demonstrations is carried out by the  
 Womens' Rural Institute, and the      
 subjects covered include spinning,    
 weaving, crochet, cookery, macrame,   
 embroidery, enamelling and flower     
 arranging. One demonstration, e.g.,   
 showed the complete process from      
 spinning wool to producing a finished 
 article of clothing.  Recently a      
 silver smith has come to live in the  
 area, who gives demonstrations of her 
 craft to groups, and the production of
 ornamental iron work on a forge is    
 still carried out at Kellas Smithy.
