		<title>02Brahan Seer</title>
		<content> The Brahan Seer is a very important   
 character in this area's history .The 
 Brahan Seer prophecied lots of events 
 that did actually came true.He was    
 blind in one eye but when he looked   
 through the hole in  the Brahan Seer's
 stone using his blind eye he could see
 into the future.He predicted the      
 Battle of Culloden a century before it
 happened.Another prophecy was the fall
 of the House of Seaforth.Every grim   
 detail was predicted by the Brahan    
 Seer.There are some predictons which  
 have not come true yet .He said that  
 an 80 ton boulder in Glenelg one day  
 would fall and kill a man.The Brahan  
 Seer has predicted it will.He said    
 that"Horrid black rains will cause    
 havoc in the Highlands."People say    
 that this is a reference to North Sea 
 Oil.The Brahan Seer's stone was said  
 to have been thrown into Lochussie.   </content>
