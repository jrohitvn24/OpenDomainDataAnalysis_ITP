		<content> Much of this area is covered by dense 
 plantations of mixed conifers grown   
 commercially by Forbes Estate in the  
 west and the Forestry Commission to   
 the east. When the trees are felled on
 maturity re-planting programmes are   
 carried out to ensure continuity.     
 In the summer and autumn of 1985      
 Forbes Estate sold standing timber for
 felling in Black Knap plantation      
 (approx. 6500 trees). These had been  
 planted between 1919 and 1923 and     
 consisted mainly of Norwegian ans     
 Sitka Spruce with some Scots Pine,    
 Japanese Larch and Douglas Fir.       
 The heavy rainfall during the summer  
 months caused difficulty in extracting
 the felled timber with heavy vehicles 
 becoming stuck fast in the muddy      
 forest roads.
