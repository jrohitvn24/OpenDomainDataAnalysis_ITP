		<title>13MUSIC FESTIVAL-BROADFORD</title>
		<content> The first{Isle of Skye Music Festival}
 was held in Broadford on June 15th    
 1985. A crowd of about 3000 people    
 each paid Â£10 to listen to seven bands
 perform. Danny Kyle introduced The    
 Honky Tonk Ceilidh Band,Phil          
 Cunningham of Silly Wizard,a reggae   
 group called Man at the Window,jazz   
 -funk from Morrisey Mullen,folk from  
 The Boys of the Lough with the top    
 names being John Martyn and Gaelic    
 supergroup{Runrig.}The event cost     
 Â£19000 to stage and lost nearly Â£3500 
 but was still a roaring success.Cater-
 ing and dressing facilities were      
 provided by Broadford Primary School  
 and the event took place in the open  
 air on the playing field adjacent.It  
 rained heavily most of the morning and
 this deterred local attendance. The   
 event was staged by The Village Hall  
 Committee and ran from 11am to 10pm.  </content>
