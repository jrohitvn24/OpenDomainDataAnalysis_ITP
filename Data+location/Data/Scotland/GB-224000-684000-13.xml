		<title>13ROLE OF THE CHURCH IN RHU.</title>
		<content> The Rev.D.Stirling, minister of Rhu   
 and Shandon Parish Church,conducts a  
 service each Sunday morning at        
 11 o'clock.He feels that it is        
 important to help people to see that  
 the Church is still needed today and  
 that it has to reach out and encourage
 people to come along and enjoy        
 its fellowship.Rhu Church attempts to 
 do just this with the many            
 organisations it has within _ the     
 Woman's Guild,the Young Women's Group,
 the Young People'  Group for          
 young Church members and those        
 preparing for confirmation,Quest for  
 12_15 year olds and the various       
 Departments of the Sunday School for  
 children aged 3_11.A creche is also   
 available to allow parents of small   
 children to attend the service.Regular
 contributions are also made to local  
 charities and Third World countries.  </content>
