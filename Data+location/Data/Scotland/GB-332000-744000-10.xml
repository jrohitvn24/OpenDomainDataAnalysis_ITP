		<title>10EASSIE CHILDREN'S PASTIMES</title>
		<content> We found that the most popular games  
 played at school were football,       
 British bulldog, high tig, rounders,  
 net-ball, skipping  and marbles.      
 Many children belonged to Guides,     
 Brownies, Cubs or Scouts.Meetings are 
 held in Glamis, three miles away.     
 Boys favourite spare-time activities  
 include fishing, cycling, swimming,   
 helping on the farms and model-making.
 Girls enjoyed cycling, making doll's  
 clothes, cooking and looking after    
 their pets.                           
 Both groups read and watch television 
 a great deal in wintertime.They earn  
 pocket money fruit-picking and potato-
 harvesting.                           
 Many of the children own their own    
 ponies and spend a great deal of time 
 riding, grooming and showing them.
