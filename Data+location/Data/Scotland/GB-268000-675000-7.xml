		<content>      Most of the houses in the area   
 belong to the District Council. Along 
 at Dumbreck  near  Kilsyth  new       
 private houses  have been built       
 recently.                             
      Queenzieburn S.S.H.A. houses are 
 being renovated just now. The Dumbreck
 terrace houses have been finished and 
 they have started on those            
 in Meadowside Road. All the           
 scaffolding is up.                    
      The S.S.H.A. houses will be      
 warmer now because they have central  
 heating,and new windows and doors.    
 There is a radiator in every room. The
 big bedroom and kitchen have double   
 radiators. The windows don't rattle in
 the wind. There is a smokeless coal   
 fire. There is strip lighting and new 
 units in the kitchen.
