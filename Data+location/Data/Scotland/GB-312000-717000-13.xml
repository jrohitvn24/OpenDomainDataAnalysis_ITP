		<content>  There are formal lawns and wilder    
 areas with shrubs,particularly        
 rhododendrons, and trees, ranging from
 broad leafed oaks,sycamore,copper     
 beech and flowering cherry to conifers
 Redwood,Douglas Fir,Norway Spruce and 
 Scots Pine. Yew trees grow around the 
 old cemetery where the Grant family   
 are buried (this is the family that   
 was living in Kilgraston before it was
 a school).                            
  A burn which is a tributary of the   
 River Earn winds through the grounds. 
 We found the soil in the burn more    
 fertile than on the banks because     
 fertilizers run off the nearby farms  
 into the burn.                        
  We have many squirrels in the grounds
 but increasingly more grey than red.  
 The squirrels feed on cones which they
 leave looking very untidy, unlike the 
                                       </content>
