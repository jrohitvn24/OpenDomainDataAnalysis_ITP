		<title>01OUR DOMESDAY BLOCK: SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>   Our block of 12km square is all     
 farmland. On the farms are mostly     
 beef, dairy and sheep. In summer the  
 farmers have to do silage, hay and    
 straw. Some grow vegetables.          
                                       
   In our square we have the village of
 Shawhead. In the village is a Primary 
 School, the one I am at just now. We  
 have a Post Office which sells petrol 
 and is also a shop. There is a Hall   
 that is used for all sorts of sport.  
 Next door to the Village Hall is a    
 Mission Hall where Church Services are
 sometimes held. We have a telephone   
 box and a bus stop.                   
                                       
   The A75 runs through our square. It 
 is very busy because it is the Euro-  
 route to Stranraer. All the lorries go
 past on their way to Stranraer.
