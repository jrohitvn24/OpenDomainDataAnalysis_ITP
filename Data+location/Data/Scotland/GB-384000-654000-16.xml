		<title>16CHIRNSIDE CIVIC WEEK</title>
		<content> Chirnside Civic Week, founded in 1979,
 is organised by a committee of        
 villagers. It starts on a Sunday.     
 From the East End decorated floats and
 people in fancy dress parade around   
 the village behind the queen's float. 
 The queen, chosen by her fellow       
 pupils, and a fairy queen are crowned 
 by a well-known member of the village 
 rather than by a celebrity. After the 
 ceremony, Highland Games competitions 
 are held along with a professional    
 running meeting, which many people    
 attend.                               
 Throughout the week there are many    
 activities for young and old. These   
 include football for children and "Old
 Crocks", a pet show, a children's     
 fancy dress competition, a BMX        
 competition, children's sports, and   
 quiz games like "Mr and Mrs".
