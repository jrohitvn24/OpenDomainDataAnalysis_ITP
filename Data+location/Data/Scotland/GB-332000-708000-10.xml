		<content>                                       
 Pitlessie Mill is just north of the   
 village of Pitlessie and lies on the  
 village side of the river.            
 It is an{old mill}that is still       
{working today.}It has been used to    
{grind grain}for many years.In those   
 days all the local farmers would take 
 their grain to the mill for grinding  
 and then sell it.After a time a       
 farm was built next to the mill which 
 is now worked by the{Smith family.    
 At present the mill has been converted
 into a place where the{grain is stored
{and dried}after it has been harvested.
 After that the bulk of the grain goes 
 to the distilleries for use in the    
 making of whisky. Some grain is kept  
 for{animal feed.                      
   So as you can see Pitlessie Mill    
 has been at work with grain for       
 centuries.{                           </content>
