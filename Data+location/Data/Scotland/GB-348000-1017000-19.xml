		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE OF CINDY</title>
		<content>  I live on{Strathore farm}on the west 
 of{Shapinsay}.We have 300 cattle.In   
 winter we feed the cattle in the      
 byres.We put the{calves}in their pens 
 because they have been with their     
 mothers all night to be fed.Next we   
 muck out the{byres}with a byre        
 scraper. It is a long pole with a     
 rectangle of rubber on the end.It is  
 used for cleaning out the stalls in   
 which the cows are kept.After that Dad
 gets the big{tractor scraper},which is
 attached to the back of our tractor.It
 pushes out all the dung from the      
 surface of the floor.The cows are fed 
 with silage , which we grow on the    
{farm}.It is cut in June and stored in 
 our silo pit during the winter.       
 After dinner sometimes we gather      
 stones in our fields.We do this to    
 protect the{cattle's hooves}.Living on
 a farm is good fun.I like it.         </content>
