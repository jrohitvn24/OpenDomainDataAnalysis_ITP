		<title>04TOWN CENTRE INVERURIE</title>
		<content> The Town Hall stands in the centre of 
 Inverurie. Directly in front of this  
 is the War Memorial with the town     
 square surrounding it.                
                                       
 Two car parking areas are situated in 
 the square, but these are small and at
 busy shopping times they are usually  
 full up. Another larger parking area  
 can be found behind the Town Hall. The
 people of Inverurie stated in a survey
 that most of them think that there are
 not enough parking facilities in the  
 centre. Others feel that when a       
 by-pass is built there will be more   
 room for shoppers to park.            
                                       
 Inverurie is described by most people 
 as a quite good shopping centre for   
 most of their requirements. Aberdeen  
 is only 16 miles away for other       
 shopping.                             </content>
