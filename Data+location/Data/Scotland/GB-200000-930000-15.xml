		<title>15LOCH CUL FRAIOCH</title>
		<content>  It's a perfect day for fishing at    
{Loch Cul Fraioch,}breezy , dry and    
 bright.  Kenny and I had arranged to  
 meet my friend Robbie and his dad     
 Robert at 11 o' clock at the bottom of
 the{Culkein}peat road.                
   We went out on the{Angling Club     
 boat.  We took two rods each and a    
 pack lunch to eat later.  Kenny took  
 the worms and hooks.  We started      
 fishing and soon the grown ups had    
 caught some large trout. A minute or  
 two later I had a strong bite. I could
 not pull it out by myself so Robbie   
 gave me a hand. What luck!  A good    
 sized trout.                          
   After our lunch we carried on       
 fishing but no luck for Robbie.  The  
 weather had changed, very calm, and   
 out came the midgies in their         
 hundreds. Home we went to a tasty     
 supper!                               </content>
