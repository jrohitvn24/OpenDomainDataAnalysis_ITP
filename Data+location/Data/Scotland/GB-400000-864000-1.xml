		<title>01Review of Fraserburgh</title>
		<content>    This Domesday Block includes       
 Fraserburgh harbour, beach and bay,   
 extending south to the village of     
 Cairnbulg.  To the east is the North  
 Sea whilst westwards we have the golf 
 course, links, farmland and wooded    
 areas.   Employment is largely        
 connected with fishing, fish          
 processing and light engineering.     
 Unemployment is high and Fraserburgh  
 Ltd. was set up to combat this.  Oil  
 service industries are being          
 introduced and a new access road to   
 the harbour is planned.  The harbour  
 is also going to be deepened.  The    
 beach, which stretches for about 4 Km.
 is beautiful. This, and the harbour   
 area, is very popular with tourists.  
    Cairnbulg is about 3.5 miles south 
 of Fraserburgh and is a typical quaint
 fishing village with winding streets.
