		<content>{  MR O'BRIEN},RECTOR OF CLYDEBANK HIGH
 SCHOOL ,previously the Rector of Tiree
 School. Before becoming a Rector he   
 taught Modern Studies. He lives in    
 Stirlingshire with his family. He     
 feels sad about the amount of         
 vandalism and unemployment in the town
 He thinks that in the future Clydebank
 will get back on its feet as an       
 industrial town and that new          
 developments such as the Business Park
 and Radio Clyde will do a lot to      
 improve the town's image. He hopes    
 to make changes in the future. He also
 encourages subjects other than those  
 that are purely academic.
