		<content>{Strathnaver Museum - Bettyhill}       
 Strathnaver Museum was opened in 1976.
 It is housed in the old Church of Farr
 and a pull-in car park has been       
 provided at the side of the road.  The
 building was last used as a church    
 during the second world war, it then  
 lay empty for many years before being 
 taken over by N.I.S.C. and restored as
 a museum.                             
 The main theme of the Museum is the   
 Strathnaver Clearances.  It was from  
 the Farr Church pulpit which can still
 be seen in the Museum, that eviction  
 notices were read out and the people  
 were told the Evictions had come as a 
 punishment for their sins.            
 Each year about 2,000 people from many
 countries visit the Museum mainly     
 because of their interest in the      
 Clearances or because their name is   
 "Mackay".                             </content>
