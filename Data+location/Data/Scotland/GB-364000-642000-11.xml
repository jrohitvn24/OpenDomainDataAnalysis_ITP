		<title>11FOOTBALL IN GORDON</title>
		<content> We have a school football team.There  
 are 2 primary fours,4 primary fives   
 and 2 primary sixes.It is 7_a_side    
 this season.Chris Henderson trains us 
 he plays football at Greenlaw.We train
 once a week on Sundays.The team trains
 in the school hall.Our strips are red 
 with black shorts and socks.We got    
 them from the school fund raised by   
 the P.T.A.(Parent Teacher             
 association.)There is a football pitch
 at the bottom of the park.I have      
 scored 12 goals and I am top scorer.  
 We are in the west league.We play     
 Greenlaw,Morebattle and Yethlom.      
 Football is a very skillful game.I    
 like it because I enjoy               
 passing,scoring and practising        
 tactics.I think alcohol in football   
 grounds should be banned because of   
 the violence                          
                                       </content>
