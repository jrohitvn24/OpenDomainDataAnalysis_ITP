		<title>19Peat cutting at Kylesku</title>
		<content>  After the last frost of the year     
 the peat cutting begins. The first    
 stage is to take off a strip of turf  
 about 20cm wide and the length of the 
 bank. This has to be done carefully   
 so that the turf can be replaced      
 when the cutting is finished.         
  The next-day the real peat cutting   
 starts. Two people are required, one  
 to cut the peats, using a tusk,the    
 other to throw the peats onto the bank
 in neat lines where they are left to  
 dry. The peats are usualy about 45cm  
 long, 20cm broad and 5 cm wide.       
  About two weeks later the peats are  
 lifted and stacked into piles of five,
 wet side up. Later the piles will be  
 built into a larger stack and finally 
 taken home.                           
  Then comes the most enjoyable part _ 
 sitting in front of a warm peat fire  
 on a cold winter's night.             </content>
