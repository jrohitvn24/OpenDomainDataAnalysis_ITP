		<title>01Communications to Gourdon</title>
		<content> The tourist or visitor should have no 
 difficulty in getting to Gourdon. This
 picturesque village well worth a visit
 lies just below the main A92 trunk    
 road midway between Stonehaven and    
 Montrose. The only access road for    
 motor vehicles leaves the main road at
 "The Latch" just south of Inverbervie 
 and Sillyflatt  Farm. Once past the   
 parish cemetery and Boath Park (gifted
 to the people of Gourdon by ex-Provost
 D.C. Boath in 1926) the road soon     
 begins to climb steeply down to the   
 rather snug and secure looking harbour
 area and onto William Street which was
 at one time the only street in the    
 village. Many closes in this part of  
 the village are well worth exploring  
 for those who may be interested in old
 fishing communities.
