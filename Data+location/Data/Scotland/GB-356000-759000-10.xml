		<title>10LAW AND ORDER IN BRECHIN</title>
		<content> Brechin has one police station in     
{Clerk St.}From there{15}police        
 officers of{Tayside Police}operate.(4 
 sergeants, 8 constables and 3 landward
 officers responsible for the larger   
 local villages). There is no C.I.D.   
 Officers patrol both on foot  and in  
 cars. Last year{161}arrests were made 
 with  Breach of the Peace and         
 Vandalism by far the most frequent.   
 Motoring offences and theft were also 
 common but murder, mugging, rape and  
 armed robbery were extremely rare. The
 local{Justice of the Peace}(Mr A.     
 Buchan) deals with less serious       
 offences in a "courtroom" in Bank St. 
 The stiffest sentences that he can    
 give are 60 days imprisonment or a    
 fine of Â£1000. In court the J.P. has a
 legal adviser in the form of a clerk. 
 More serious crimes are tried at the  
{Sheriff Court}in Forfar.              </content>
