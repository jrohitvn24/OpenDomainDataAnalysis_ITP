		<title>19Saturday.  by Derek Hay.</title>
		<content> Strolling along with Dad and dog,     
 Talking to him about a log.           
 The green and black log               
 With streaks of white,                
 We found on the beach that day.       
                                       
 Dog swiftly races down to the sea.    
 Happily splashed and jumped about.    
 But I was thinking of all we had seen.
 Thinking of our walk on the beach.    
                                       
 Finally it was time to head home.     
 Dad putting the dog's lead on.        
 We walked and we walked.              
 It had been a good day                
 Finding out about the shore           
 On that sunny Saturday walk.
