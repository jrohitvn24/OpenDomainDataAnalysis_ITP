		<title>01Thurso, Caithness</title>
		<content> Thurso, population 9500, is the most  
 northerly town on the Scottish coast. 
 Thurso comes from "Thors-a" meaning   
 Thor's river, Thor being the Viking   
 God of War.Thurso was the gateway to  
 the southern part of the Norse kingdom
 Norse leaders gave their names to     
 streets such as Thorfinn Terrace,     
 Sigurd Road, St. Olaf Road, Sweyn Road
 Magnus Road and Thorkel Road.         
 Thurso, once a fishing village, was   
 built round the bay and the river.    
 New estates have been built since 1955
 to accommodate the new workforce at   
 the Dounreay Atomic Power Station, ten
 miles west of the town. Rocky cliffs  
 border the Victoria Walk which leads  
 to the town's esplanade and beach     
 where swimmers bathe safely. Anglers  
 fish the river for salmon. Summer     
 tourists use Thurso as a base to visit
 places of interest in Caithness.      </content>
