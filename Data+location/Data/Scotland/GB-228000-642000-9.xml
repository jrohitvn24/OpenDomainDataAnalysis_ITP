		<title>09EGLINTON COUNTRY PARK</title>
		<content> KILWINNING was ruled by the Earls of  
 Eglinton for centuries but in 1920 the
 family through lack of money,gave up  
 the castle  and it fell into ruins.   
 Mr. Clement Wilson bought it in 1959  
 and established  a factory to process 
 and can foods.He developed the grounds
 for people to visit.It is now a fine  
 park owned by CUNNINGHAME DISTRICT    
 COUNCIL.Recently it has become a      
 country park.Thousands come here every
 year to cross the bridge the Earl had 
 built for the great tournament of 1839
 that ruined his family financially.   
 A RANGER SERVICE has been introduced  
 and a study centre established.       
 Children are encouraged to visit the  
 park to study plants and wildlife.
