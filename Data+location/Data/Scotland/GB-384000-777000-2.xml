		<title>02A CATTERLINE BOY'S DAY</title>
		<content> I get up in the morning at quarter to 
 8 and get dressed.I usually wear black
 cords, a blue shirt, white socks, a   
 jumper and a pair of trainers. I have 
 breakfast which is a cup of tea and   
 two pieces of toast.I wash after that,
 then pack my school bag and bicycle to
 school.We have a play-time then we    
 start school.First thing is to get    
 changed into our shorts then we get a 
 gym teacher for 45 minutes. Then we   
 have a play_time with a tuck shop for 
 15 minutes, after that we do written  
 work like mathematics, English,       
 history and geography. Then at half   
 past 3 I bicycle home.If I have       
 homework I do it then. I watch        
 television till five o' clock which is
 tea time.Then at 9 0' clock I go to   
 bed.
