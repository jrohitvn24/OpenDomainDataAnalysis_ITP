		<title>01Changes in Irvine Town.</title>
		<content>   Irvine Development Corporation was  
 formed to plan new industry, houses   
 and amenities for the extra population
 in Irvine when Irvine was designated  
 as a{'New Town'}by the government.    
{ Factory sites}were kept near to the  
 main roads to make communication      
 easier. Housing areas had to be close 
 to factories to allow easy travel to  
 and from work.{Community Centres}were 
 chosen to create a neighbourhood      
 spirit. These centres were often made 
 from existing farm buildings, and     
 social, recreational and cultural     
 pursuits can be enjoyed within each.  
{Local Parks}were made to include      
 football pitches, play areas, BMX     
 tracks, roller skating parks and      
 anything else people wanted. Housing  
 schemes were designed to cut down     
 traffic flow so that it was safer for 
 children to play.                     </content>
