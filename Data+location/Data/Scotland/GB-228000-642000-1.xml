 Irvine was designated a new town in   
 1966 and joined two ancient royal     
 burghs Irvine and Kilwinning with     
 three villages Dreghorn, Springside   
 and Drybridge.Situated 3 kilometres   
 from the sea,at the north end of      
 Irvine Bay Kilwinning straddles the   
 River Garnock with the old town of    
 Irvine to the south and Stevenson to  
 the west. The ruins of Kilwinning     
 Abbey,founded by Sir Richard de       
 Morville,a Norman Lord around 1160,   
 still dominate the town. The gable end
 of the south transept is the best     
 feature.The first Freemasons were     
 those who came to the building of the 
 abbey and Kilwinning Masonic Lodge,   
 the oldest in Scotland.Many visit it  
 each year.Kilwinning today has many   
 modern buildings as well as old ones.
