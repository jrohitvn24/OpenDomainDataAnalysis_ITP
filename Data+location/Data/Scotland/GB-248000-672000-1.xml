		<content> This area is part of Clydebank and    
 District,situated north of the town   
 centre.Duntocher and Hardgate are much
 older than Clydebank itself but       
 Faifley was built after the war.There 
 are approx. 16000 inhabitants.To the  
 north are the Kilpatrick Hills and to 
 the south the A82 to Loch Lomond      
 separates it from the rest of         
 Clydebank.To the east lies Bearsden   
 and to the west Old Kilpatrick.The    
 only access to the town centre is by  
 Kilbowie Road.                        
                 The area is mainly    
 residential with both private and     
 local authority housing.About half the
 land is open space,farmland or        
 moor.Most inhabitants travel to       
 work as they are within easy reach of 
 Glasgow which also has good shopping  
 facilities.Loch Lomond is the most    
 popular recreational area.            </content>
