		<title>10Interesting Street Names</title>
		<content>    Although almost every house in the 
 part of Annan, which falls into our   
 area, was built during this century,  
 there are several street names which  
 have interesting links with local     
 history.                              
    Overlooking the River Annan is the 
 place called{Gala Bank}or {Galabank}. 
 This got its name because in the 16th 
 century, this was {Gallows Bank}where 
 criminals were hanged. Nowadays, it   
 belongs to the council. Some of the   
 ground has been turned into a caravan 
 park for holiday-makers, while the    
 remainder is the home ground of the   
 local soccer club,{Annan Athletic.    
 They have built a new pavilion at the 
 ground, but many hefty clearances end 
 up in the river even though there is a
 high wire fence there. Sometimes our  
 school football team gets the chance  
 to play important matches there.      </content>
