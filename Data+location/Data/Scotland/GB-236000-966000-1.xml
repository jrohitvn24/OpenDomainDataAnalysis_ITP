		<title>01DURNESS-GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>   Durness is a remote rural area of   
 Sutherland, lying some 15km east of   
 Cape Wrath, the most north-westerly   
 point in Great Britain.  It is set    
 against a backdrop of wild, rugged    
 mountains and is surrounded by open,  
 barren moors fringed with towering    
 sea cliffs and bays of golden sand.   
   The population of about 350 is      
 scattered among several townships     
 which collectively make Durness. The  
 village presents a typical Highland   
 scene of traditional stone built      
 houses set in a patchwork of croft    
 fields.                               
 The mainstays of the local economy are
 tourism and sheep farming. The area   
 provides excellent tourist facilities 
 and is ideal for those who wish to    
 walk,mountaineer,fish,sail,study      
 plants and birds or simply wish to    
 enjoy the peace and quiet.            </content>
