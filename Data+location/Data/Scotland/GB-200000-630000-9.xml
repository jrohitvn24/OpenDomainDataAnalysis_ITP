		<content>    Arran High School is the only      
 secondary high school on the island   
 with 280 fully attending pupils.During
 World War II the school was used for  
 training commandos and a base for     
 naval officers.The sports fields are  
 at the back of the school where they  
 trained.For a canteen they used       
 Lamlash community hall.The school was 
 finally opened after the war.         
    A new art building has been erected
 which is phase one in the             
 modernisation of Arran High School    
 which is to be followed on by the     
 construction of the new building.This 
 building  has taken the place of 7    
 temporary huts which were constucted  
 in 1979 to accommodate for the rise   
 in pupils.
