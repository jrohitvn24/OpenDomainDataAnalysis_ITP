		<content> In this area there are two main       
 organisations,the SWRI-Scottish Womens
 Rural Institute and the Men's Club.The
 Men's club started in 1916 as a bothy 
 club down at the crossroads until     
 Rathillet Hall was built in 1923 .This
 club meets on a Thursday all the year 
 round except in the summer when the   
 men are too busy on the farms.Members 
 of this club play games such as pool, 
 billiards, bowls, table-tennis and    
 darts.The population on the whole has 
 dropped and there is nothing like the 
 same number of people living in this  
 area that used to and so this is why  
 the number of members in the WRI and  
 the Men's Club has also dropped.      
 Children can go to the Boys ,Brigade, 
 Brownies, Guides, Cubs or Scouts, but 
 these are in Cupar, Newport or Wormit.
 The nearest Country Dance class is at 
 Gauldry.                              </content>
