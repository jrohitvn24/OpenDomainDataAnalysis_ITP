		<title>17CROSSFORD:PROBLEMS OF GROWTH</title>
		<content> The rapidly growing village of        
 Crossford, with a present population  
 of almost 3000, is very much a village
 of young families. Surveys have shown 
 that only 16% of villagers are over 50
 years old, while nearly 30% are below 
 the age of 12. This rapid growth is   
 due to the influx of young married    
 couples into the village, some 77%    
 of residents having moved to Crossford
 in the past ten years. This has led to
 a situation where facilities are      
 insufficient to meet local demands,   
 medical services in particular being  
 picked out as those most required. A  
 children's clinic is arranged weekly  
 in the village hall, but there is no  
 local doctor or pharmacist.           
    The vast majority of people        
 therefore travel out of the village   
 for most of their needs.
