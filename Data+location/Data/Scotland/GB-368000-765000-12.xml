		<content>    Many people who live in the older  
 parts of the village have retired from
 full time employment such as          
 personnel manager, farm worker,       
 hospital driver and cook in domestic  
 service.                              
    Some have lived in Marykirk for as 
 many as sixty years while others have 
 recently moved into the village.      
 Marykirk senior citizens have many    
 interests including knitting socks,   
 bowling, writing, reading, cooking,   
 gardening and sewing tapestry         
 pictures.  Some are members of local  
 organizations like the Bowling Club,  
 the Old Age Pensioners' Association   
 which meets in the school, the Church 
 and Hall Committee.
