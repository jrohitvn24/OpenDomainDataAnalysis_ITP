		<title>12CRAMOND :Leisure/Recreation</title>
		<content> Our suburb has ample facilities for   
 leisure.People can swim,ride bicycles 
 and horses,take walks along the river 
 or foreshore,go sailing, potter about 
 in boats - the list is long. Members  
 of the Cramond Association have access
 to the buildings and grounds of       
 Dunfermline College which boasts an   
 inddor pool, trampolines, gyms and    
 lots more I haven't yet discovered.   
 During the summer large numbers of    
 tourists arrive to visit the local    
 places of interest such as the Tower  
 and Kirk, the old iron mills and Roman
 Fort. Home-owners are tolerant of     
 these visitors for though they bring  
 crowding and pollution they bring     
 business to Cramond Inn and the local 
 shops and cafes and they know that    
 Cramond is an attractive place -well  
 worth visiting.
