		<content> The Beamers Youth Club, which meets   
 each Thursday evening was established 
 in October 1983. Catering for the     
 12-17 year age group  (11 year olds   
 attend fortnightly), the club is run  
 by a committee of members with adult  
 leaders participating in a 'steering' 
 capacity. Activities are varied,      
 normal club nights being games nights 
 where members play darts, table-tennis
 pool, uni-hoc etc. Once a month the   
 Berwickshire Activities Bus visits the
 club.                                 
 Special activities have included disco
 dancing, gliding and sailing. Mr      
 Thornhill of St Agnus End has donated 
 a dinghy which will be used at the    
 Sailing Days on the Whiteadder        
 Reservoir. Archery equipment has      
 recently been purchased.
