		<content> There is only one post box in the     
 area.Most people in outlying areas    
 have to either travel to a post box or
 give their mail to the postman who    
 delivers the mail only once each day. 
 There are two collections from the    
 post box each day. There is only one  
 telephone kiosk  in the whole area and
 so most houses have a telephone.Four  
 people have C.B. radios in the village
 and they can be tuned into channel 9  
 for emergencies. If there is a fire   
 999 is dialled and fire engines come  
 from Forres.Some traders go round the 
 area in vans.If there is a sale or    
 other events of importance then they  
 are advertised in shops in Forres or  
 they are posted on a notice board     
 outside the church hall and sometimes 
 placed on the bus stops.
