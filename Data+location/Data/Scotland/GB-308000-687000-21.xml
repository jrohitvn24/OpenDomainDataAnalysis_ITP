Entertainment in dunfermline has changed beyond all recognition. &lt;br />&lt;br />The Orient Express Cinema referred to is now derelict havin, for a time, been a sports bar. A new Leisure park on the edge of town at halbeath includes Odeon Multi screen, gym, Bingo Hall, Ten pin bowling, crazy golf and lots of eating establishments.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Bingo Hall referred to (The Alhambra) closed but has now been restored as full refurbished theatre - one of the largest such venues in Scotland hosting everything from comedians, rock bands to Fiddle Orchestras and is a very successful venue. Back to it's original glory. &lt;br />&lt;br />Carnegie Hall is still open and is also hosts to concerts, plays and shows of all kind. Things have definitely improved 25 years on!   &lt;br />
