		<content>   The Police Station was built in 1905
 There are three cells in Maud police  
 station.One policeman works in the    
 Police Station.There are six rooms.A  
 policeman's duties are to guard, watch
 and patrol, protect life and property,
 preserve the peace and detect         
 offenders.Policeman said the funniest 
 thing that had happened is chasing    
 sheep that had run away from the      
 Mart.There has been no policeman in   
 the Police House at Maud since October
 1985 when PC and his family           
 moved to the city of Aberdeen.The     
 police  house is being redecorated at 
 the moment in readinoss for the new   
 policeman and his family.             
    There is no serious crime in the   
 area and very little vandalism.
