		<content> If you are a football fan and don't   
 especially want to play,you can go    
 along to the football pitch on a      
 Saturday afternoon to see local teams 
 playing in what is called a 'Derby'.  
 The Recreation Park has tennis courts 
 which can be hired out by the hour.   
 Because we have no swimming pool we   
 use a lovely spot down by the Ullapool
 River.                                
 In the Community Centre and some of   
 the hotels we have Pool and table-    
 tennis tables.                        
 We have a paddling pool down by the   
 'Old Jetty'beside a park called' Am   
 Pollam'(The Anchorage).               
 Darts are played in the winter time.  
 Several teams participate from a      
 league table and cups or shields are  
 presented to the winning teams.
