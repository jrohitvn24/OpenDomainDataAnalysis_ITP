		<title>14HIS MAJESTY'S THEATRE</title>
		<content> As you look at this magnificent       
 builing you see the beautiful granite 
 sparkle.It stands at the end of two   
 builings,Aberdeen Public Library and  
 St Marks Church.The three buildings   
 are known locall as Education,        
 Salvation and Damnation!In 1982 the   
 theatre was renovated.Inside the      
 theatre one marvels at the spledour   
 of the walls and pillars wih red and  
 gold everywhere.A huge crystal        
 chandilier hangs from the ceilling and
 there is a lovely carving called"The  
 Muses" above the stage.There is a     
 large green dome at the top of the    
 theatre which holds a vast volume of  
 water.The reason for this is that     
 during renovation the sanitory        
 inspector said that all the toilets   
 must flush simultaneously.The dome was
 the only place they could store       
 such a volume of water.               </content>
