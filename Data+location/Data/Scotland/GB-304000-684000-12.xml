		<title>12THE CROSSFORD CHRONICLE</title>
		<content>{THE CROSSFORD CHRONICLE}is a          
 newsletter which is distributed free  
 to all the houses in CROSSFORD four   
 times a year. Copies are also         
 available in local shops for the use  
 of visitors. It is financed by        
 adverts, with any defecit being made  
 up by the COMMUNITY COUNCIL.          
    The Chronicle contains news of     
 village events, e.g. the copy for     
 April 1985 tells us that at last      
 traffic lights have been installed at 
 the junction of Waggon Road and Main  
 Street, and a resident has written a  
 poem in their honour. We also learn of
 the happenings of the Scouts and      
 Guides in the village, but most       
 important of all is the programme for 
 the village Gala in May. (SEE PAGES   
 13,14,and 15). The professionally     
 printed Chronicle is a useful source  
 of communication within Crossford.    </content>
