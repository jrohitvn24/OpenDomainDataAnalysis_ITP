		<content> Many of the former shops have been    
 converted to banks and building       
 society offices and there are a       
 large number of employment            
 agencies now located in Union Street. 
 A further development has been the    
 increase in restaurants and in the    
 past year seven new wine bars have    
 opened in the vicinity of             
 Union Street.The number of bars and   
 nightclubs has also risen and many of 
 the bars have extended licensing hours
 remaining open now until 2am in the   
 morning.Some of these changes reflect 
 national trends while others are      
 attributed to the wealth generated    
 from oil amonngst some of the         
 population.Another sign of this wealth
 is the absence of waste land or       
 derilict property though too many     
 speculative offices have been built.
