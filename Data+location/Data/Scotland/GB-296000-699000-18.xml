 often the meeting place.The SWRI hold 
 monthly meetings.A Youth club is held 
 weekly. There is a Horticultural      
 Society with an annual show.The       
 Amenity Society takes care of the     
 preservation of the character of the  
 village and countryside.A Ski club    
 enables young and old to take part in 
 this exciting sport.All these clubs   
 have Muckhart in their titles but     
 welcome many from outlying districts.
