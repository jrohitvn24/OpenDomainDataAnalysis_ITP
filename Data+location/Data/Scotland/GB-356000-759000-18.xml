		<title>18AMERICAN'S VIEW OF BRECHIN</title>
		<content> Hi.I am one of the 200 Americans      
 living in a US Government housing     
 estate on the northern outskirts of   
 Brechin. My Dad,like all the fathers, 
 works for NATO at RAF Edzell six miles
 from town.I come from California and  
 have lived in Brechin for 2 years.My  
 Dad has one more year to do here      
 before we all go back to the USA.     
 Brechin is DIFFERENT from home. I feel
 it cool and rainy here. School is more
 strict but when I go home I will be   
 ahead of my classmates. I do not eat  
 much Scottish food. Mom buys tacos,   
 hamburgers and pizzas at the American 
 food shop on base. At night I watch TV
 and go to discos the same as I do at  
 home.I have made a lot of friends in  
 Brechin and I am sure I will miss them
 when I go home.                       
                                       
                                       </content>
