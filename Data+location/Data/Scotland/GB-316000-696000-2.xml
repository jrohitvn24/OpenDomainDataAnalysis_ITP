  The main bus route from Ballingry    
 travels south through{Lochgelly,}     
 south-west through{Cowdenbeath}and on 
 to{Dunfermline.}To get to{Kirkcaldy}  
 you have to change buses at Lochgelly 
 and head south-east through{Cardenden.
 It is virtually impossible to travel  
 by bus to{Glenrothes}which is Fife's  
 new town and north-west of Ballingry. 
 You can go by bus to{Edinburgh}via    
 Dunfermline and the Forth Road Bridge.
  The nearest railway station is at    
 Lochgelly. From there you can travel  
 by train to Edinburgh,the Scottish    
 borders and England.In the other      
 direction the train only goes as far  
 as Cardenden.                         
{ Edinburgh airport}is the nearest     
 airport for travellers going abroad.
