		<content> THE OLD VILLAGE SCHOOL AND            
 SCHOOL-HOUSE ARE THE HOME AND STUDIO  
 OF ALASTAIR BUCHANAN, WHO IS AN       
 ARTIST.                               
 SINCE HE PAINTS IN GOUACHE, HE USUALLY
 SKETCHES HIS WORK OUTSIDE, BUT        
 FINISHES IT INSIDE SO THAT IT WON'T BE
 SPOILED BY RAIN.  HE USES MANY        
 BRUSHES, AS THEY HAVE TO BE THROWN    
 AWAY OFTEN, SPOILED BY THE GOUACHE.   
 HE PAINTS ON THICK BOARD, WITH PAPER  
 STUCK ON TOP TO GIVE A GOOD QUALITY   
 FINISH.   WITH THE HELP OF A VICTORIAN
 GUILLOTINE, HE MAKES HIS OWN FRAMES.  
 FIFE FISHING VILLAGES AND FISHING     
 BOATS ARE THE SUBJECTS HE ENJOYS MOST,
 BECAUSE HE IS INTERESTED IN MAKING HIS
 PAINTINGS SHOW THE PAST.   HE OFTEN   
 PUTS OLD SCENES BACK INTO PAINTINGS,  
 USING HIS IMAGINATION AND REMOVING    
 SUCH THINGS AS TELEVISION AERIALS AND 
 CHIMNEYS.                             </content>
