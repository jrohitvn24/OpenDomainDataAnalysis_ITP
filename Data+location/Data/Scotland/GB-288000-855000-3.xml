		<title>03NAIRN SHOPPING PATTERNS</title>
		<content> In a small sample survey of shoppers  
 on{Nairn High Street}a number of      
 patterns seemed to emerge.The majority
 of the shoppers we spoke to  still    
 bought their food in local shops.The  
{High Street}food shops seemed to      
 attract the same numbers of shoppers  
 as the new{Templetons Supermarket}    
 although a{large family grocer}has    
 closed recently.Most people           
 interviewed however said that they    
 purchased clothing and household      
 articles in{Inverness}or{Elgin.}We    
 felt that the elderly without         
 transport were most dependent on local
 shops.                                
 At local council meetings recently    
 concern has been expressed that too   
 many premises on the{High St.}are     
 being occupied by banks,building      
 societies and offices.We found{4}banks
{4}building societies and{10}offices.  </content>
