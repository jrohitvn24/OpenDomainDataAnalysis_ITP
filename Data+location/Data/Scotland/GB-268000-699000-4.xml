		<title>04MADE IN DEANSTON</title>
		<content> Deanston Distillery was once a        
 thriving cotton mill where most of the
 villagers worked. This closed in 1965 
 &amp; later Invergordon Disterilleries    
 took over to make a malt whisky called
 Deanston Mill. About 18-20 people were
 employed then. As the whisky industry 
 declined production ceased and the    
 distillery became mainly a warehouse  
 from which in-store whisky is sent out
 to blenders. Now the workforce is     
 reduced to 6. However a by-product of 
 the distillation is made by Doune     
 Products Ltd. Pot Ale, a residue from 
 the first distillation, is brought in 
 from producing distilleries to make   
 Pot Ale Syrup for animal feeding. This
 is the only work now carried out apart
 from storing whisky. The water supply 
 which once drove the mighty mill wheel
 now powers the alternator generating  
 more than adequate inhouse electricity</content>
