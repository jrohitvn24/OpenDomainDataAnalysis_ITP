		<content> We live in Abronhill and go to        
 Abronhill Hill School where the hit   
 film{Gregory's Girl}was filmed.       
 Gregory's Girl is a film based on a   
 boy's school life in Cumbernauld. When
 it was filmed in 1979 the school was  
 only one year old. The main actors    
 were Dee Hepburn, Gordon Sinclair, and
 Clair Grogan. Some pupils at the      
 school also got parts in the film. The
 film is about a 15 year old boy,      
 Gregory, who falls in love with       
 Dorothy who is the only girl in the   
 school football team. She is great at 
 football, or so Gregory thinks!       
 Gregory, who is quite shy, eventually 
 asks Dorothy for a date and they agree
 to meet at the Town Centre. Dorothy   
 doesn't turn up but she sends her     
 friend to tell him. Gregory is        
 heartbroken until he meets Susan who  
 is played by Clair Grogan in the film.</content>
