		<title>08COAL MINING(2)-GALSTON</title>
		<content> Today the number has diminished       
 greatly and those employed in the     
 industry have to travel outwith the   
 town to Mauchline,Sorn and Prestwick. 
 The most recent coal mine opened in   
 1984 this being an open-cast mine due 
 to close in 6 months time in 1986.But 
 it ran out of coal so quickly because 
 of the demand for coal during the     
 miners strike.During this period the  
 mine did not close because the workers
 were not members of the NUM.The coal  
 was being distributed to all over     
 Scotland as well as some of England.  
 The pit was only 30 acres in size and 
 135 meters above sea level.The        
 over-burden of slate ,boulderclay and 
 Calciferous Sandstone,has been        
 replaced and levelled for re-seeding  
 with grass.
