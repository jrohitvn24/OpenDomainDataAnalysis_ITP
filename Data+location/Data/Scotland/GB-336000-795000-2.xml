		<title>02BALLATER: ROYAL CONNECTIONS</title>
		<content> 'Royal' Deeside became a great        
 attraction for Victorians who came    
 initially by horse and carriage and   
 then by train. The local population   
 would turn out in force to welcome the
 Royal visitors and their guests.  The 
 Royal Family continue its connections 
 with the area.  Many of the local     
 traders hold Royal Warrants for goods 
 and services supplied to members of   
 the Royal Family.  Tourists to Deeside
 travelling now in cars, coaches and   
 caravans flock to the area            
 particularly during August, when the  
 Queen is at Balmoral for her annual   
 holiday. Ballater is the centre for   
 these visitors and has many hotels,   
 guesthouses, summer homes and a busy  
 caravan park.
