		<title>11Eating Habits Change.</title>
		<content>  We did some research into people's   
{eating habits}when we visited our     
 local super market and made several   
 interesting discoveries.              
  The{best selling products}are Heinz  
 Baked Beans and Coca Cola, but in     
 spite of advertising campaigns to sell
 different breakfast cereals, Kellog's 
 Cornflakes are still the favourites.  
  The{biggest change}in food buying has
 come about because people are becoming
 very{health conscious.}There is a boom
 in the purchase of{natural,}nutritious
{food.}Less fat, sugar, salt are being 
 sold and food containing{fibres}such  
 as wholemeal{brown bread}are increas- 
 ingly being bought. Tesco Stores have 
 difficulty keeping up with the demand 
 for their booklets "A Tesco Guide to  
 Healthy Eating".                      
  We really enjoyed our visit to this  
 supermarket.                          </content>
