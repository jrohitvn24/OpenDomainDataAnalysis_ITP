		<content> The Lower Annandale Group of the      
 Riding for the Disabled Association   
 meet once a week at West Bretton,     
 Creca.                                
 The children are from two primary     
 schools and the Special Class at Annan
 Academy. There are about 11 children  
 in all. They have learning            
 difficulties and riding gives them    
 enjoyment and self confidence. The    
 Group is run by volunteer helpers and 
 instructors according to the R.D.A.   
 rules. Ponies belong to the Helpers   
 and are brought every week. Safety is 
 the first consideration, next         
 enjoyment. The least competent        
 children require two Helpers. One to  
 lead the pony and one to steady the   
 rider. Sometimes a child requires a   
 Helper at either side. There is an    
 annual gymkhana, Hallow'een party, and
 a challenge shield.                   </content>
