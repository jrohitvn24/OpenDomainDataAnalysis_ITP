		<title>14CARAVAN LIFE AT CLAYTON PARK</title>
		<content> Mrs. Annie Bain, a senior citizen,    
 lives in a 36ft long caravan. Her     
 living room is fairly small, a bit    
 draughty at times, but generally cosy.
 Her kitchen is reasonably equipped and
 has a calor gas cooker. There is a    
 small bedroom,like a ship's cabin and 
 a small bathroom. At the end of the   
 caravan is the master bedroom,which   
 can hold a double bed. All switches   
 are operated by cords.The fire is     
 fuelled by anthracite.Each mobile home
 owned by its resident,stands on rented
 land.Unfortunately,there isn't much   
 excitement for children as most       
 residents are retired and they like to
 sit back and watch T.V. A mobile      
 library calls at Clayton every two    
 weeks.Residents enjoy lots of open    
 countryside -in spite of limited space
 within.
