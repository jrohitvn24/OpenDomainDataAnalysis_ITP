		<content> The people in this area are of stocky 
 build, but very heathy and strong.    
 There is no doctor's surgery in the   
 village, so patients have to register 
 with either the doctor in Gatehouse,  
 to the West, or Kirkcudbright, to the 
 North-East.  However, in emergencies, 
 doctors perform home visits.  The     
 District Nurse performs home visits to
 new born babies, which are normally   
 born in Dumfries, 35 miles away, and  
 periodically up to school age.  When  
 at school the children are examined   
 during their first year, and sight and
 hearing are tested bi-annually until  
 they leave at 12.  The school dentist 
 visits to inspect all children once a 
 year.  If there are enough children   
 needing treatment then he returns with
 his mobile caravan.Otherwise the      
 children are taken to the next village
 where the caravan is parked.          </content>
