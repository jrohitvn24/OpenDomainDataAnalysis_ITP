      Our school is situated in the    
 south-west side of Argyll, known as   
 the Cowal Peninsula. It is close to   
 the main road to Glasgow (A815).      
      This rural area is mainly used   
 for forestry and farming. There are 4 
 farms, the largest one being a dairy  
 farm. The forestry land is divided    
 between the Economic Forestry Group,  
 the Forestry Commission and Tilhill   
 Forestry Group.                       
      There are no villages in our area
 but quite a few scattered communities.
 Tourists are well catered for by two  
 caravan parks and a camping site. The 
 wooded scenery is beautiful and there 
 are good forest walks. The River      
 Eachaig flows through our area and is 
 very popular with fishermen.
