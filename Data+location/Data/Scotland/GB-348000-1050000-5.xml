		<content> In the 1980's tourism began to play an
 important part in the economy of the  
 island. The population was no longer  
 sufficient to support a shop. To      
 counteract this the islanders with the
 help of the H.I.D.B. set up a         
 community cooperative whose initial   
 remit was to provide a shop and make  
 it viable by providing hostel and     
 guest house facilities for Tourists.  
 This they proceeded to do and employed
 a husband and wife team to manage a   
 general store with agriculture        
 supplies and fuels together with a 16 
 bedded hostel and a 4 roomed guest    
 house.                                
 The public rooms have been designed in
 such a way that they can be used for  
 community activities during the winter
 months.                               
 Up to 1985 the number of tourists has 
 increased each year.                  </content>
