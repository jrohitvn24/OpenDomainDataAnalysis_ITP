		<content>{Finzean WRI,}founded in 1931, held its
 meetings in the Soup Kitchen of the   
 school ,now the Outdoor Centre, and   
 members walked or cycled to attend.   
 Today members travel by car to the    
 monthly meeting in the comfort of     
 Finzean Hall.                         
 Membership (33) is less than in the   
 50's but interest is still keen and   
 recently Finzean Institute has won    
 trophies and prizes at both Group and 
 Federation levels for{bulb-growing,   
{baking and handicrafts.               
 We have a speaker or demonstrator at  
 our meetings and one meeting per      
 session is given over to a Charity.   
 We also have{whist drives, birthday   
{and Christmas parties and an annual   
{outing.
