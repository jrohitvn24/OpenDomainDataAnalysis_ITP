		<title>19The Registrar's Office.</title>
		<content> The Registrar's Office is situated in 
 Manse Road opposite the school. It was
 built 50 years ago. Two people work   
 there now. They open at 9.00am and    
 close at 4.45pm. To work there you    
 have to be good at typing, arithmetic,
 and English. The officers have to     
 register births, deaths and marriages 
 which take place in the area. Local   
 inhabitants go to the office to pay   
 their rent and rates.This year there  
 have been 24 marriages in the village,
 4 of which were held in the office.The
 office is closed during the marriage  
 ceremony and is made pretty by        
 decorating the room with flowers.There
 have been altogether 54 deaths and 18 
 christnings in Thornhill this year.   
 The rent goes up in price every       
 April.
