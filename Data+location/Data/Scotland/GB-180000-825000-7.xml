 The fish farm was started in 1978 by  
 Mr and Mrs Stewart.They have 1300 fish
 which eat 33lbs of food a day.The     
 food is made of fish meal,soya bean   
 fish oil and crushed shrimps.It costs 
 about Â£500 a ton.                     
  Their biggest success was when they  
 sold lots of disease free eggs at a   
 great profit.Their biggest fish       
 weighed 30lbs.                        
  Mr Stewart gets the salmon when they 
 are smolt.He breeds them then sells   
 the eggs to other fish farms.         
  In December he strips the females of 
 their eggs which he puts in fresh     
 water.He gets milk from the males to  
 fertilize them.                       
  The main predators are the heron and 
 the otter.
