		<content>      GIRVAN lies on the main Glasgow  
 to Stranraer railway line.It is fifty 
 miles from Glasgow and thirty from    
 Stranraer,the terminus for the Irish  
 boat to Larne.It is possible to take  
 the boat train direct to London.      
      There is a good road system which
 has much scenic beauty,particularly   
 south of Girvan as it winds through   
 Glen App and along the shores of Loch 
 Ryan.Traffic can be heavy during the  
 summer months but driving can be      
 avoided by using a good bus service.  
      Some twenty five miles away lies 
 PRESTWICK Airport serving mainly the  
 North Atlantic routes.Glasgow Airport 
 is reasonably accessible with both    
 national and international flights    
       A Girvan by-pass has been       
 discussed for many years but remains a
 pipe-dream
