		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LIAM</title>
		<content> From 11-12 0'clock I was in school.   
 Then Mrs.MacDougall arrived with the  
 lunch. It is cooked at Taynuilt ,     
 7miles away. It is served at a special
 table in our classroom. We had        
 meatloaf and potatoes and then arctic-
 roll for pudding.                     
  I played for three-quarters of an    
 hour and then went back into school.  
 We typed or dictated some of the      
 stories for our Domesday project in   
 the afternoon. At 3.30p.m. school     
 closed and I went home.               
 I fed the hens which is my job every  
 day since I came to live in Kilchrenan
 two weeks ago. I have never had hens  
 before. Next I changed my clothes and 
 went to play with Dominic, my pal.    
 We played on our bikes and then       
 cleaned out a pond in my garden. I had
 dinner at 7.30p.m. and went to bed at 
 about 10 o'clock.                     </content>
