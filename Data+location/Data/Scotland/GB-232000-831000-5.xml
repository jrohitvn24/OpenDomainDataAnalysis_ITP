		<title>05FORESTRY FARMING IN CANNICH</title>
		<content> Approximately 1/3 of this area is     
{forestry}property, mostly public, some
 private. 23% of the total area is of  
 commercial plantations of conifers,   
 the other 10% being naturally         
 regenerated hardwoods, non-woodland   
 areas in{agricultural}use and land for
 housing, administration and{amenity.  
 Cannich, though of decreasing         
 importance, is the forest centre for  
 approximately 30,000 ha. of forest    
 land, 8000 ha. of this being woodland,
 the remainder being largely mountain- 
 ous, infertile and inaccessible.  It  
 is only suitable for letting as deer  
 forest, with some agricultural use,   
 and largely used for public amenity   
 activities such as hill walking and   
 rock climbing. There are 20 local     
 people directly employed by the {     
 Forestry Commission, 16 of whom live  
 in the 12km block.                    </content>
