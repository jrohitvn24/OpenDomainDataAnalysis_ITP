		<title>20NEW ABBEY - ATTITUDES</title>
		<content>   The main attitude of the people is  
 of thankfulness that we live in such  
 lovely surroundings.  This is a lively
 community - large enough to support a 
 school, a church, an excellent village
 shop/post office and two fine Hotels -
 yet small enough for us to know each  
 other,even if only "by sight".        
   Unemployment is virtually unknown.  
 This is by no means a dormitory area. 
 Many people work in the village or on 
 the farms, though some travel daily to
 Dumfries by car or bus.               
   The bus service is reasonable but   
 the young people complain about the   
 lack of late night buses.             
   We are very lucky to have a surgery 
 with two doctors in the village.      
   We enjoy having tourists in Summer  
 and are glad of the trade they bring, 
 though we do grumble about the extra  
 traffic in our quiet village street.  </content>
