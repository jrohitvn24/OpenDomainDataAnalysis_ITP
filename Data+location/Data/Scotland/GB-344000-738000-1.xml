		<content>    This area to the north of Murroes  
 contains some very rich farm land,    
 with some fairly large forest         
 plantations to the extreme north and  
 south.  The land use is predominantly 
 agricultural.                         
    The ground slopes gradually upwards
 towards the summits of Dodd Hill and  
 Carrot Hill, which is the highest     
 point in the area. From this latter   
 vantage point there is a very         
 picturesque panoramic view of the     
 landscape to the north and west.      
    The nearest shopping centres are   
 Forfar and Dundee.  The small         
 population is widely scattered, and   
 since the local church, primary       
 school, and organised social          
 activities are to be found in the area
 to the south, the following pages     
 contain many references to this latter
 area.                                 </content>
