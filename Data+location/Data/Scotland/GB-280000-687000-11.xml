		<content>   The most common mode of dress in the
 area is jeans, T shirt and trainers   
 (shoes). Many of the children wear a  
 uniform to school but this is not     
 compulsory.                           
   Teenagers spend a lot of time       
 listening to pop groups on their      
 transistor radios that they carry     
 around with them. Discos are very     
 popular and it is the fashion to hire 
 a disco to celebrate special          
 occasions.                            
   Bingo is still enjoyed mainly by    
 women. Many families spend money on   
 horse racing, greyhound racing and the
 football pools.
