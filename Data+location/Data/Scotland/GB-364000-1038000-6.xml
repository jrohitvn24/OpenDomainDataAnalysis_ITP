		<content> Kettletoft pier is the only{main pier 
 in our block. The boats that serve the
 pier are the{Orcadia}and the{Islander.
{The Orcadia carries passengers, parcel
{mail and cargo.}It is the other main  
 transport system to the Island, along 
 with the aeroplane. The Orcadia comes 
 to the Island on 'Trip day' and takes 
 the Island's people into Kirkwall on  
 the Mainland for the day. The other   
 day on which many islanders go on the 
 boat is for the annual Inter-Island   
 Sports, held on one or other of the   
 main northern isles. The Islander     
 takes 12 passengers and takes a lot of
 cargo. We have a{coal boat}which      
 delivers coal to all the Islands twice
 a year. We have{another boat}which    
 annually{collects tangle (seaweed)    
{from the isles. The pier is 170m long 
{and 25m wide.}It has two big buildings
 to keep the cargo in.                 </content>
