 This is primarily a farming area, the 
 rich agricultural land gives rise to  
 large farms growing cereal crops,     
 mainly barley. Field boundaries are   
 denoted by hedges or trees, resulting 
 in a gently rolling landscape with few
 signs of habitation. This is a        
 distinctly rural area, with scattered 
 farm steadings, hamlets and the       
 occasional small village containing a 
 general store and sub post office. The
 main village in this block is East    
 Saltoun characterised with its        
 typical single storey cottages built  
 in traditional stone. The village     
 also contains an historic church with 
 spire. Most of the villagers work     
 either on the surrounding farmland,   
 much of it owned by a single landowner
 or commute through to Edinburgh       
 and other major towns in East Lothian </content>
