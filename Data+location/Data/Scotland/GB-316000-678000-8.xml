		<title>08ART COLLECTION</title>
		<content> The Roseberys own a very impressive,  
 priceless{art collection}much of which
 is on view at Dalmeny.The earliest    
 family portrait is that of Sir        
 Archibald Primrose and was painted by 
{John Scougal.}His son,the first Earl  
 had his wife painted by{Godfrey       
{Kneller}but as his descendants lived  
 mainly at Dalmeny,they tended to      
 employ Edinburgh artists hence the    
 large number of works by{Aikman,      
{Chambers}and{Ramsay.}The earliest     
 portrait of the third Earl is by      
{Gainsborough.}The third Earl was also 
 painted by{Nasmyth}and{Raeburn.}The   
 fourth Earl extended the collection by
 purchasing portraits by{Van Dyke}and a
 group of paintings by the{Old Masters.
  By marrying Hannah de Rothschild,the 
 fifth Earl futher extended the        
 collection to include 16th century    
 Italian and 18th century paintings./  </content>
