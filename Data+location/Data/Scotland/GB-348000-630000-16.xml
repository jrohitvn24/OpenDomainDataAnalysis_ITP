		<title>16Local Customs</title>
		<content> Without a local church or school      
 responsibility for continuing         
 traditional customs has been accepted 
 by LINDEAN WRI in so far as children  
 are concerned.The large non-native    
 element in the adult population is    
 reflected in the lack of interest in  
 the various events formerly associated
 with,for example,the grain harvest and
 country weddings.New Year's Eve is the
 only survivor.On the other hand,a new 
 custom of which LINDEAN is the        
 setting has recently been established:
 in recognition of the historical      
 association of LINDEAN with the parish
 church of Galashiels,the first public 
 event of the Braw Lad's Gathering -the
 Galashiels summer festival-is a visit 
 by the principal characterrs and their
 mounted followers,to the number of    
 several hundreds,to the site of the   
 ruined church,where a service is held.</content>
