		<title>09TRANSPORT IN CHIRNSIDE</title>
		<content> It is very difficult to provide good  
 transport in a rural area. First of   
 all there are not, according to the   
 local people, enough buses. Eighty per
 cent of the people interviewed in     
 Chirnside have cars, and are unanimous
 that the price of petrol, which they  
 can buy at 3 of the 4 garages, is too 
 expensive at Â£2.06 per gallon.        
 Nevertheless buses are necessary for  
 the workers.                          
 There was once a railway in Chirnside 
 but in 1948 a flood washed away part  
 of the line. Services were suspended  
 for 11 weeks. In 1951 the passenger   
 service stopped but the goods service 
 continued until 1966.                 
 This leaves Chirnside with the public 
 buses and privately owned transport   
 services.
