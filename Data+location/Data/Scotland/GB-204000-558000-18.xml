		<title>18ENERGY - STRANRAER</title>
		<content>  There are three forms of power       
 commonly used in Stranraer.{Gas}is    
 brought by tanker to the Industrial   
 Estate where it is kept in tanks in   
{liquid form}until it is required.{Oil 
 is likewise transported to Stranraer  
 by tanker.{Electricity}is provided    
 through the National Grid System.     
  At present there is no nuclear power 
 plant in the district although there  
 has been a great deal of controversy  
 over nuclear waste being dumped into  
 the sea near Stranraer from the       
{Sellafield}plant in Cumbria. There has
 also been some talk about oil         
 exploration in the waters off         
 Stranraer. As yet nothing has been    
 confirmed although preliminary surveys
 have taken place.                     
{ Coal}is brought into the area by     
 contractors and{peat}is dug in the    
 nearby hills and used for burning.    </content>
