 In the north west highlands of        
 Scotland on the Inverness to Kyle of  
 Lochalsh road lies the village of     
 Dornie.It sits on the eastern shore at
 the mouth of Loch Long where that loch
 joins Loch Duich.It comprises a ribbon
 development of houses along the edge  
 of the water and before the opening of
 the road bridge  was the ferry        
 terminal to the Lochalsh peninsula.It 
 was also the point from where the     
 ferry crossed to the southern shore of
 Loch Duich at Totaig.Many of the      
 houses have been taken over as holiday
 homes but there is still a healthy    
 local population.The main tourist     
 attraction is Eilean Donan Castle     
 which following destruction by the    
 English in 1719 was restored in       
 1932.Dornie is one of the main centres
 of Roman Catholicism in the highlands.</content>
