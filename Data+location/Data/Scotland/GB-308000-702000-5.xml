		<content>{Farms}in the Kinross area range from  
 about 42ha-230ha.Very large farms     
 often own other smaller farms.        
 Gallowhill(1003) is a relatively small
 farm owning only 43ha.The larger farms
 usually have a greater variety of     
 crops than the smaller farms,which    
 often only consist of one crop and    
 some beef cattle or sheep.            
                                       
                                       
 Several farms in this area are now    
{building}new sheds to either extend   
 the farm or to replace old buildings. 
 Many of these old buildings are being 
 demolished to make way for larger     
 store sheds for implements or crops,  
 which could also be used to house     
 cattle in the winter.
