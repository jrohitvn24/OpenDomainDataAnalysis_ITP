		<title>02THE FOREST WALL West Forres</title>
		<content> On the {Darnaway Estate}there is a    
 wall known as the {Forest Wall.}In the
 1400s the land was owned by the crown.
 Today it is owned by the Earl of Moray
 .The king visited the area to hunt    
 boar and red deer.The wall was built  
 because people were moving into the   
 area and the king wanted to keep his  
 forest for hunting.The law said that  
 no person could build and settle on   
 enclosed land.So a wall was built of  
 local river stones in a semi_circle   
 starting from and returning to the {  
{River Findhorn.}If anyone moved on to 
 the land they would be cruelly driven 
 off.In the late 1500s Royal Hunts on  
 the Darnaway Estate died out.Parts of 
 the wall can still be seen today.
