		<title>02WEST PLEAN PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> We receive our education at West Plean
 School from the age of five for seven 
 years. Our school was{built in 1879 to
{hold 110 pupils.}We cannot think how  
 they managed to fit in because we     
 scarcely have enough room for the 18  
 pupils who attend today. The building 
 has hardly changed in the last hundred
 years, we still have to go down to the
 end of the playground to use the      
 outside toilets.                      
 Our teacher is Mrs. Hamilton who has  
 been at this school for 16 years. Our 
 school has 2 classes and Miss Petrie  
 teaches the younger children.         
 Most of the children in our school    
 have farming connections either       
 through parents or grandparents.      
 We like our little school because we  
 get to know each other very well and  
 it is like having lots of brothers and
 sisters.                              </content>
