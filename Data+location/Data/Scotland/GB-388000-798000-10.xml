		<title>10BANCHORY-DEVENICK SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  Banchory-Devenick school was built in
{ 1879}and some of the present pupils' 
 grandparents attended it. Before then 
 there were two church schools in the  
 parish which are now private homes.   
  The school has a kitchen, staff room,
 three classrooms, five toilets and a  
 cleaning cupboard. The toilets were in
 the playground but they are now used  
 as stores and "huts". Long ago 100    
 pupils attended then the numbers      
 dropped badly but are now steady. Now 
{the roll is between 40 and 50.}There  
 are three class teachers and visiting 
 teachers who specialise in Art, P.E., 
 Home Economics, Music and Drama. There
 is a lack of space so one classroom   
 has also to be the dining room and    
 gymn hall. The pupils attend from age 
{5 to 11}then transfer to their        
 parent's choice of Secondary School   
 either in Aberdeen or Stonehaven.     </content>
