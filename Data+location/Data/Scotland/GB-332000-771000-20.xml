		<content> HOW I SPENT SATURDAY 1st JUNE 1985.   
                                       
  At 8:30am. I watched "The Wide Awake 
 Club"on T.V.The presenters read  out  
 letters that viewers have sent in and 
 sometimes they film people who have   
 sent in the letters. After that       
 Louise, a neighbour, who is only 2    
 years 7 months old came down to the   
 Hotel, which is my home, and played   
 with my big pink elephant. At 2pm I   
 had to go to Sherard's  fourth        
 Birthday Party. He just lives  a short
 way  from me. Louise went with me and 
 we had a good time. We played on the  
 swing and the slide, and burst lots of
 balloons! Eight of the nine Glen Clova
 children were there. For tea we had   
 salad. The different parts made a     
 picture of a house. After that I had a
 piece of the ice-cream gateau with    
 cream. It was DELICIOUS!              </content>
