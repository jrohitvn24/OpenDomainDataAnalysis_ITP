		<title>06Mobile Library, Tongue</title>
		<content> A Mobile Library van comes to Tongue  
 on a Monday once a fortnight. The     
 children from the school went to find 
 out what people thought about the     
 service. Of those interviewed, more   
 did not use the library than did, but 
 of those who found time to read, most 
 thought the librarian helpful and the 
 selection of books quite adequate.    
 Once a fortnight was reckoned to be   
 about right.                          
 The library van also calls at the     
 school so that the children can make  
 their own selection of books there.   
 The nearest library building is in    
 Thurso 45 miles away.
