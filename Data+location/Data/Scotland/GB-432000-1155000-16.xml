		<content>{The Lifeboat Gala.}Every July a       
 fundraising gala is held in aid of the
 lifeboat funds. About 200-300 people  
 come to it. There are sideshows,      
 snacks and a sale for the lifeboat    
 fund. There are trips on the lifeboat 
 and a helicopter rescue display.      
 There are dinghy races, a craft show, 
 a cross-country race and pony rides.  
 Afterwards, there is a dance in the   
 hall.                                 
{The Regatta.}There are no sailing     
 boats in Aith itself at the moment    
 but a regatta is held each June and   
 boats come from all over the islands  
 to compete. There are various races   
 for different kinds of boat. In the   
 evening the trophies are presented and
 there is a dance in the hall.
