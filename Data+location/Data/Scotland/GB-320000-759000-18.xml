		<content> The highlight of the afternoon was the
 performing seals. We enjoyed watching 
 their tricks and were sorry when the  
 show was over. The children's zoo was 
 a disappointment as the animals looked
 very sorry for themselves.            
 After high tea of chips, sausages,    
 beans  followed by ice cream and jelly
 we headed for home, a journey of about
 seventy miles.                        
 The trip ended with a visit to Alyth  
 fish and chip shop. More food and     
 drink!
