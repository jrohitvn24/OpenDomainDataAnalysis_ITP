		<title>09KEEPING WELL IN GLENLUCE</title>
		<content> All houses have electricity and a high
 proportion of people burn coal and    
 wood on open fires to keep{warm.}     
 Since the  miners'strike in 1984/85 a 
 lorry calls  weekly with bags of peat 
 and half the families in the area buy 
 peat for their fires.Calor gas is used
 in about a quarter of the houses, but 
 only a few people burn oil as it is   
 now very expensive.{Health}in Glenluce
 is cared for by Dr Baird, helped by an
 assistant. They have an appointments  
 system with a morning and late        
 afternoon surgery. A schools'{dental  
 service parks a mobile clinic for     
 treatment at the school once a year.  
 At other times people go to Stranraer.
 There is an Old Folks Welfare         
 Committee looking after the needs of  
 the{elderly. }The nearest{hospital}is 
 10 miles away in Stranraer or 65 miles
 to Dumfries for major operations.     </content>
