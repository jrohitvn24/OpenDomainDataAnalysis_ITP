		<title>15Trees and plants, Craignish.</title>
		<content>   The most common trees are ash,      
 birch, hawthorn, rowan, sycamore and  
 willow. Alder, blackthorn, hazel,     
 larch, lime and wych elm  also grow,  
 mainly in 'groves'.In areas constantly
 exposed to prevailing winds the trees 
 grow into gnarled and twisted shapes, 
 some barely gaining a 'foothold' on   
 the exposed rocks. Large areas of the 
 Kilmartin  side of the loch  have been
 planted with sitka spruce.            
    Bracken, broom, gorse, heather and 
 rhododendrons grow on the higher      
 ground, with the fragrant bog myrtle  
 abundant on damp land.                
   On some of the islands and roadside 
 verges Spring flowers grow in such    
 profusion that they give a 'haze' of  
 colour when seen from a distance.     
 First the white of snowdrops, then    
 primrose yellow, bluebells and later  
 the pink of massed campions.          </content>
