		<content> This is mainly arable farmland and    
 contains the hamlet of Fala Dam,      
 whichis a conservation area. There are
 eight houses, some of which are       
 subject to flooding after             
 exceptionally heavy rain , owing to   
 their situation which is low lying    
 relative to the surrounding land.     
 There is some natural woodland along  
 the course of the Fala Dam Burn .     
 There are two other houses which are  
 rather isolated, but both are within  
 a few hundred yards of the main road.
