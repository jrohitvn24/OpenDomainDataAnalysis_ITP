		<title>01Population in Cowdenbeath</title>
		<content>   The Cowdenbeath population rose     
 steadily from 7000 in 1911 to its     
 highest of 14215 in 1921 because of   
 the demand for miners in the          
 prosperous mining town. Improvements  
 in mining machinery put jobs at {     
 jeopardy and so people had to move out
 of the area to seek new employment    
 elsewhere. The figures have slowly    
 decreased to 13151 in 1951, to 11920  
 in 1961, and to 10664 in 1971. In 1981
 however there was a slight rise to    
 12272 even though surprisingly the    
 birth rate dropped from 7.3% to 5.6%  
 in 1981. The uptrend in recent years  
 could be accounted for by the building
 of small housing schemes and small    
 industries arriving. The Cowdenbeath  
 area still has high unemployment      
 figures despite this, with a total of 
 6124 unemployed.
