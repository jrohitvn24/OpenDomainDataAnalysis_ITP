		<content>  I went home and then I met Michelle  
 from the bus.                         
  We washed the car and got soaked.    
 Later we had our dinner.              
  After dinner I watched T.V  and then 
 we took Michelle to Guides. My mum and
 I went to my Nana and Auntie in       
 Inverness.                            
  We picked up Michelle and we went    
 home. We played on my computer a game 
 called "Chuckie Egg". We had something
 to eat and then we went to bed at     
 10.45 p.m.
