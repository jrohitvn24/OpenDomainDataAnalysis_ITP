		<content> Our Sports Days are held on two       
 different occasions in June,5 to 7    
 year olds on one day and 8 to 12 year 
 olds on another.The younger children  
 have a family picnic type of          
 day,whilst the older pupils have an   
 orthodox style of sports.Many varied  
 races are on the programme.There is   
{SPRINT}racing,with distances varied   
 for different age groups.One of the   
 races is the{THREE-LEGGED}race when   
 children run in pairs with their      
 inside legs tied together(with Dad's  
 best tie)Hopefully they run in time   
 with one another.The{SACK}race is     
 entertaining to watch as the children 
 hop,jump and struggle their way to the
 finishing line.The{BACKWARDS}race is  
 very humorous when the children must  
 run backwards to the finish.During the
 afternoon icecream is served to the   
 children.                             </content>
