		<title>06Local History in Johnstone</title>
		<content> The most significant aspects of       
 Johnstone's local history centre round
 the mining and textile industries.    
 Freestone and whin quarries have been 
 in Johnstone since 1634. Although     
 there were only 2 coalmines the       
 Benston Pit had a coal seam 100' wide.
 The Auchenlodment Pit was closed after
 a flooding disaster killing 5 miners  
 in 1818. In 1860 the closure of       
 Benston Pit due to its second flooding
 disaster ended coal mining in the     
 area. About 1721, Christian Shaw      
 smuggled looms into Scotland from     
 Holland. By 1735 the linen trade was  
 booming. On the Black Cart River, an  
 important early source of power, there
 stands a good example of a linen mill,
 now Smith &amp; McLaurins Paper Mill.     
 Johnstone Castle tower home of George 
 Houston still stands as does an 1896  
 tower marking site of ancient castle. </content>
