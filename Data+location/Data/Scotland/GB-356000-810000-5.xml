 The hall was built in 1919. It was    
 used for community activities more in 
 the past than now. Craigievar branch  
 of the Scottish Women's Rural         
 Institute meet monthly. Usually at    
 these meetings a guest speaker or     
 demonstrator of craft attends and     
 craft or baking competitions take     
 place by members.                     
                                       
{CRAIGIEVAR CASTLE}                    
 Visitors come from all over the world 
 to visit Craigievar Castle, which is  
 the seat of the Forbes family, and    
 managed by the National Trust for     
 Scotland.  Members of the family still
 hold functions in the castle. The late
 Lord Sempill from Craigievar Castle   
 donated land for the building of the  
 Hall (above).
