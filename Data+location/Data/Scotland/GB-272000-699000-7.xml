		<title>07DOUNE GARDENS</title>
		<content> As Doune is situated in a rural area, 
 all houses have gardens and there is  
 a great interest among the local      
 population in the cultivation of      
 flowers and vegetables. Many of the   
 old houses whose front doors open in  
 to the street have beautiful walled   
 gardens behind and even the new       
 purpose-built retired people's flats  
 have a comunal garden.                
 "My house is right in front of a wood 
 and we sometimes see a red squirrel   
 darting about in the trees." Helen    
 "My garden is really big. We've got a 
 garden shed and it takes my dad quite 
 a long time to dig it, it is so big." 
 Robert                                
 "In my garden I have London Pride,    
 Lilies, Lavender and two small trees. 
 I have many others but I do not know  
 the names yet." Bernadette
