		<title>15TOURISM IN NAIRN</title>
		<content> Over one hundred and thirty years     
 ago,a general practitioner in Nairn,  
 Dr Griggor,decided to recommend Nairn 
 to his colleagues south of the border 
 as an ideal area for patients in need 
 of recouperation.The dry mild climate 
 combined with the beautiful beaches   
 and links,and the added attraction of 
 a new direct rail link with Inverness 
 led many people to choose Nairn for   
 their summer vacation.A new hotel,{   
{'The Marine'}was opened near the sea  
 and visitors were able to enjoy indoor
 salt-water baths  and the use of      
 bathing machines in the shore.Many    
 people enjoyed the area so much that  
 they built substantial houses in the  
 west end of the town where they spent 
 the summer months.Today there are{20} 
 registered hotels and guest houses and
 many bed and breakfast facilities in  
 Nairn.                                </content>
