		<title>17SURVEY OF TRAFFIC ON A9</title>
		<content>  We did a survey of the traffic on the
 A9 which runs close to the school. It 
 was  not a very good day,it was very  
 misty but we stood inside the school  
 grounds with our clip boards and noted
 the vehicles which passed in one hour.
 We went out in pairs,each pair staying
 for 10minutes only going back into the
 school when the next pair took over.  
 These are the types and numbers of    
 vehicles that passed in that hour; 457
 cars,223 lorries, 49 vans, 16 coaches,
 7 land rovers and 2 motor bikes. A    
 total of 754 vehicles on a very dull  
 day. I am sure that there would have  
 been even more if it had been a lovely
 sunny day or if the survey had been   
 done at the weekend instead of a      
 school day.We really enjoyed doing the
 survey. We did not realise that there 
 would be so many vehicles although we 
 knew that the A9 is a very busy road. </content>
