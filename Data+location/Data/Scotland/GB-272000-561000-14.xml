		<title>14Black Bridge</title>
		<content> Black Bridge consists of a bridge and 
 an old house called Black Brig        
 Cottage.                              
 The bridge is very old and has a very 
 small burn running under it. The      
 bridge is just wide enough for a car  
 to get over it.                       
 The house too, is very old and small. 
 Round about the house and bridge there
 are a few trees. The cottage is       
 surrounded by a huge hedge which has  
 an opening to get in.                 
 The bridge has not got a date on it   
 but we think it is very old and has   
 been there for a while. The bridge has
 a very small opening just big enough  
 for the water to flow through.        
 There is a road that goes past the    
 house. It is used quite a lot although
 it is only a small road.              
                                       
                                       </content>
