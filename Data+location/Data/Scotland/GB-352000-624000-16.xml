		<content>{MR. DONALD}ENJOYS BEING A MINISTER    
 BECAUSE HE FINDS IT VERY SATISFYING   
 AND THAT THE WORK HE HAS TO DO IS THE 
 WORK IS THE WORK HE WANTS TO DO.      
 HE THINKS IT A GREAT PITY THAT THE    
 CHURCH HAS RETREATED TO THE EXTENT    
 THAT THERE ISN'T A MINISTER LIVING IN 
 THE VILLAGE OF LILLIESLEAF.HE LIVES IN
 BOWDEN.HE THINKS THIS A PITY BECAUSE  
 HE THINKS IT IS GOOD FOR A VILLAGE AND
 A PARISH TO HAVE A MINISTER LIVING    
 INSIDE IT.                            
 LILLIESLEAF CHURCH WAS BUILT ABOUT{200
 YEARS AGO AND HAS HAD SEVERAL PARTS   
 ADDED OVER THE YEARS.                 
 AN{OLDER}ORIGINAL CHURCH WAS NOT      
 PRESERVED AND IS NOW A RUIN IN THE    
{CHURCHYARD.}                          
 IN LILLIESLEAF GRAVEYARD THERE WOULD  
 BE AT LEAST{60,000}PEOPLE BURIED IN   
 THE LAST{800}YEARS.
