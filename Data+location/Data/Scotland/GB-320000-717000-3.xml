		<title>03Transport around Newburgh</title>
		<content> Newburgh has a bus garage, it is      
 situated at the shore. It has about 11
 double deckers and 10 singles. There  
 are about 23 drivers who work two     
 shifts, early shift and back shift,   
 and some cleaners. Each morning at    
 about 8.15am two double deckers go up 
 the High Street to collect school     
 children who go to the High School in 
 Cupar. Most of the buses run from     
 Newburgh to Perth, then from Perth to 
 Kirkcaldy. There is a City Link run   
 that is based in Newburgh but goes    
 from Perth to Edinburgh. The main bus 
 company is trying to stop this run.The
 buses leave and pass Newburgh every   
 minute to the hour.                   
    A single track railway runs through
 the town. There was a station at one  
 time, but it has been closed for some 
 years. A few passenger and goods      
 trains pass by each day.              </content>
