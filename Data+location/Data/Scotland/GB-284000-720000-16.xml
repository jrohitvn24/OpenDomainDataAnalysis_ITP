		<title>16GALLOWHILL</title>
		<content> From the tradition that in many parts 
 of the country the gallows were       
 erected on some small hill, the sight 
 where the gallows of Crieff was       
 erected has generally been considered 
 to be that small mound near the       
 cemetery, on the top of which grows a 
 Lime tree.  This part of Crieff is    
 popularly known as the Gallowhill, and
 the district round about rejoices in  
 the name of the Gallowhaugh.          
   There is no proof, however, that    
 this hill was a place of execution,and
 it  has been suggested that the name  
 Gallowhaugh in fact means the ford    
 over the river, since there is a ford 
 over the river Earn nearby.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
