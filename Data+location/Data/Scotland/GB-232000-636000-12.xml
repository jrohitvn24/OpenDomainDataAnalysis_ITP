		<title>12IRVINE ** SCHOOL MEALS</title>
		<content> Over the years{school dinners}have    
 been given rather a bad name, what    
 with grouchy dinner ladies and mushy  
 peas. But in{Dreghorn Primary School, 
 the children say their school         
 dinners'are great'. The menu is chosen
 by Mrs Kerr,the head-cook, not the    
 headmistress. Although there are some 
 special foods that must be in the     
 meals every day, on the whole, the    
 children have a very varied menu. In  
 some schools you have perhaps fish    
 every Monday, steak pie every Tuesday 
 and so on. Not so D.P.S. During a     
 month,you might get fish only once,and
 steak pie 3 times. The food is bought 
 from local distributors.Roughly  95   
 children attend school dinnners each  
 day,the meals are made up both        
{nutritionally and economically}but    
 with nutrition at the top of the      
 list.                                 </content>
