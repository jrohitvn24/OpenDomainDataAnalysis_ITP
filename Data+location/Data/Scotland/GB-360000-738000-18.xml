		<title>18STREET NAMES IN ARBROATH.</title>
		<content>{Housing}in Arbroath was practically   
 restricted to the High Street in 1692.
  Sir John Slezer's engraving shows    
 that one road branched from the High  
 Street and ran towards Dundee.This was
 Millgate,named after the burgh meal   
 mill.Many streets are named after     
 local nobility or{politicians.}Hence  
 we have East Mary Street,Dalhousie    
 Place,Roseberry Place,Salisbury       
 Place,and Morley Place,as well as     
 Duncan Avenue.Many streets and        
 buildings are named after other local 
 figures.Gowan Street and Jamieson     
 Street are two,named after a local    
 minister and a landlord.In addition   
 some places are named because of past 
 characteristics.Warslap is named after
 the point on the Links where large    
 amounts of seaweed lay and Gayfield   
 implied the cheeriness of the area.   
{Local history}is shown by such names. </content>
