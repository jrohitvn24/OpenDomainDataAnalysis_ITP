		<title>05TRANSPORT FORRES WEST</title>
		<content> The main road running through Forres  
 is the "A96".  Running west it leads  
 to Nairn and Inverness.  The High     
 Street running through Forres gets    
 very busy during the summer season.   
 Soon there will be a by-pass built    
 around Forres.  This will allow big   
 lorries and heavy traffic to pass     
 through with-out conjesting the high  
 street.                               
   Other forms of transport in the West
 of Forres are the Bus Station and the 
 Railway Station.  The Bus Station runs
 regular services to and from Elgin.   
 They run free services to Fine Fare.  
 This is to help the old and the       
 unemployed, because they haven't      
 enough money for the bus fare.  They  
 also run regular services for school  
 children who have no transport.       
   The Railway Station runs trains to  
 different towns and cities.           </content>
