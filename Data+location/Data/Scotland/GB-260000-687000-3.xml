		<title>03Young Lady's View of FINTRY</title>
		<content>{Fintry is}probably one of, if not the 
 most attractive village in Scotland   
 although there is not a lot to it. The
 villagers themselves take pride in it.
{During the day}its usually quite quiet
 except the school holidays when all   
 the children and students alike, are  
 wandering around looking for something
 to do. Personally I don't think there 
 are enough facilities for the younger 
 generation.{The sports centre is a    
{great asset which I feel could provide
{more.}There is no reason why it should
 not get together teams for example,   
 hockey, football, shinty, tug of war  
 etc. to challenge other clubs. This   
 would give more people a chance to be 
 involved in something.{The monthly bus
 service would do better on a Saturday,
 it would make more money to ensure it 
 was not taken off.{But I'll always    
{think highly of Fintry. It's unique. }</content>
