		<content> Crail Sailing Club Open Day.          
 It was a breezy morning when we went  
 down to the harbour to put up the     
 bunting and get the boats and canoes  
 ready. Fortunately by afternoon the   
 wind had dropped and the sun came out.
 Several hundred people came down and  
 some tried their hands at paddling the
 canoes, or went for trips in the      
 rescue boat, the 3 dinghies or the 2  
 yachts.Later a speedboat was also     
 available. Everyone had to wear a     
 lifejacket. The Coastguards had a     
 stand,&amp; the R.N.L.I. were selling     
 crisps and lemonade and money-making  
 lucky number Teddys. The helicopter   
 from R.A.F. Leuchars came and gave a  
 life-saving demonstration. The happy  
 afternoon finished with a barbecue for
 all the hard-working members of the   
 Crail Sailing Club.
