		<title>05Recreation in Colmonell</title>
		<content> Colmonell's main recreation area is   
 the local park which adjoins the      
 bowling green.                        
 In the park there are swings,a chute  
 and a roundabout in addition to a     
 small football field.                 
 The local bowling club is quite       
 popular with locals and visitors alike
 but the village's best known          
 recreational asset is the local river,
 the Stinchar.                         
 The river Stinchar is known throughout
 Scotland as a fine salmon and         
 sea-trout river and the local angling 
 club holds one bank of the river near 
 the village.The best runs of salmon   
 and sea-trout occur in late Autumn    
 when many visiting anglers appear     
 overnight if conditions are good.The  
 river is at it's best during and after
 a spate.                              
                                       </content>
