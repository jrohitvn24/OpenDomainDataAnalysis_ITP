		<title>10QUARRIES IN RATHO</title>
		<content>    MANY SPECIALISED MACHINES ARE USED 
 AT THE QUARRY.  THE MAIN DIGGER AT THE
 ROCK FACE WEIGHS 68 TONNES. ANOTHER   
 SPECIALISED MACHINE IS THE MACHINE    
 THAT DOES THE BORING FOR THE BLASTING.
 IT IS CAPABLE OF BORING A FOUR INCH   
 HOLE AT THE RATE OF ABOUT FORTY FEET  
 AN HOUR.                              
    SAFETY IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. MEN 
 WORK IN PAIRS AND ONE MAN IS          
 RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OTHERS SAFETY.    
 NATURALLY NORMAL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS   
 LIKE HARD HATS AND SAFETY GUARDS ARE  
 OBLIGATORY.                           
    THERE IS STILL A HUGE RESERVE OF   
 STONE LEFT IN THE QUARRY AND IT WILL  
 BE MANY YEARS BEFORE THIS RUNS OUT.   
 WHEN THE LAST OF THE ROCK HAS BEEN    
 REMOVED, THE QUARRY, LIKE OTHERS IN   
 THE AREA, WILL BE FILLED WITH RUBBISH,
 LANDSCAPED OVER AND RETURNED TO ITS   
 ORIGINAL USE.                         </content>
