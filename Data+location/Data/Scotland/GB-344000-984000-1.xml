		<content> Undulating farmland, mainly           
 intensively managed as grassland for  
 cattle raising.  Much marginal land   
 recently drained with grant aid from  
 E.E.C. and brought under the plough.  
 Secondary farming of sheep, but no    
 dairying.  Residual crofting still    
 carried on, and inshore fishing       
 (lobsters) pursued as a supplementary 
 activity.  Passenger ferry from       
 Burwick to John O'Groats (summer only)
 established in recent years, and      
 year-round ro-ro ferry service to     
 Gills Bay planned to start within two 
 years.  The lands of Liddle Farm      
 contain two important archeological   
 sites recently excavated, with a small
 private museum which tourists visit.  
 No public transport services exist on 
 land except buses in connection with  
 schools and the summer ferry.         
 Landscape treeless and windswept,     </content>
