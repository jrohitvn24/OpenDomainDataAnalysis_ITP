		<title>11FARMING in SPEY VALLEY (1)</title>
		<content>{Farming}in this area is mixed due to  
 the variety of terrain. Beef and sheep
 are the main products. A farm of say  
 about 630 acres would support about 70
 cows and calves along with twice as   
 many sheep. About one seventh of this 
 ground would be used for growing      
 barley, potatoes, turnips and hay for 
 the farm's own use. Some local farmers
 benefit from free grazing in the RSPB 
 Bird Reserve.                         
                                       
 Whereas 20 years ago the farmer would 
 have employed about six men he can now
 run it basically on his own, calling  
 on neighbouring farmers for help when 
 necessary, ie harvest time. Big farm  
 machinery such as combine harvesters  
 is hired from neighbours when needed.
