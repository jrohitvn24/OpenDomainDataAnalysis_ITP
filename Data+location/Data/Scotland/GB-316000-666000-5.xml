		<content> We interviewed Mr.L from Hope Scott   
 Garage in Currie, which specialises in
 Austin Rover cars, although they also 
 have a Dynamo Spyder Ferrari car which
 is not for sale. The showroom is      
 small, but it is possible to fit five 
 cars into it. Mr.L is the managing    
 director and he lives in a small flat 
 above the garage. In a normal day he  
 would handle the financial side of the
 garage and the workshop accounts. He  
 works nine hours a day and five and a 
 half days a week. His garage sells    
 Shell petrol. The garage has          
 a workshop where they repair all the  
 cars. The busiest day is Monday during
 the times 8-9a.m. and 4-5p.m. The     
 garage gets approximately 150         
 customers a day. The garage also used 
 to sponsor cars in the Monte Carlo    
 race.                                 
                                       </content>
