		<content> Most of the land area in our block is 
 rough moorland. The soil beneath is   
 peaty and the cover is rough grass and
 heather. This provides habitat for a  
 number of animals birds and insects.  
 The moorland is used as rough grazing 
 for sheep, though increasingly areas  
 of it are being reseeded to provide   
 better quality grazing. The more      
 arable land is in the lower areas     
 close to the sea. Most of this land is
 used in crofting, either as grazing or
 for crops. The road verges and small  
 areas of unused land support many     
 varieties of wild flowers. There are a
 number of lochs in the area and burns 
 run down into Aith Voe and East       
 Burrafirth. The Loch of Houster is    
 noted as a site for wintering wild    
 fowl. The area is virtually treeless.
