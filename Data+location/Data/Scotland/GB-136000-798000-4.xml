		<title>04CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT,RHUM</title>
		<content> Apart from maintenance &amp; basic support
 to the community, effort is mainly    
 directed towards creative conservation
 management.This springs from the      
 original intent of improving biolog-  
 ical productivity after centuries of  
 ecological impoverishment by clear-   
 ance,burning &amp; over-grazing.In 1985 a 
 programme aimed at simulating original
 Hebridean woodland commenced.To date  
 over 2000 acres have been afforested  
 with c.700000 trees &amp; shrubs of 20    
 species.In 1985 re-planting of native 
 woodland flora began.Cattle were re-  
 introduced in 1972 to improve &amp; main- 
 tain grassland at Harris &amp; Guirdil.The
 Sea Eagle programme began in 1975_the 
 first breeding success may occur in   
 1985. Rhum is one of the most costly  
 Reserves in Britain, but because of   
 extensive research and creative manage
 ment use, is one of the most exciting.</content>
