     There are Roman Catholic schools  
 and non denominational schools in     
 Coatbridge. There are however many    
 more catholic pupils than the other.  
 This was because a lot of Irish       
 immigrants came to work in Coatbridge 
 when it was known as the Iron Burgh.  
 There is never any trouble between the
 two religions. The Church of Scotland 
 in our area is called Calder street   
 Parish church and the Roman Catholic  
 one is called St. Mary's. There is    
 also a Salvation Army Hall and a      
 United Free Church.
