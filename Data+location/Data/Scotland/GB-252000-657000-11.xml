		<content>    The area surveyed is of recent     
 political creation ,when under local  
 government re-orginisation in 1975 ,  
 the parliamentary constituency of     
 Eastwood was created ,the safest      
 conservative seat in Scotland         
 .Eastwood district council is of the  
 same political persuasion ,with 12    
 members of whom 10 are tory and 2     
 independent .                         
    The main residential areas are     
 populated by the most affluent society
 of Glasgow's surburbia ,well educated 
 ,professional and articulate .Even the
 local council housing area of Woodfarm
 has 26% home ownership and a high     
 level of amenity .Thus spurred by a   
 deserved pride in their area ,such    
  groups as Giffnocks residents        
 association and Giffnock and          
 Thornliebank communinity council are  
 well attended .                       </content>
