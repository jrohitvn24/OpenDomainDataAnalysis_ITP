		<content>   There are 37 houses in the defined  
 map area of the village (13 of trad-  
 itional style using local stone &amp; 24  
 of more modern construction). 8 were  
 Council built (some now privately own-
 ed). 9 of the 37 are second or holiday
 homes. All but one (a farmhouse)of the
 other 28 are occupied all year. In    
 addition there are a further 7 houses 
 either under construction or recently 
 completed but not yet occupied.       
   There are also 13 caravans or mobile
 homes (not counting any touring vans  
 or those sited near farm buildings). 8
 of these 13 are for holiday use only. 
   Very few houses are available for   
 renting although some holiday homes   
 are offered as 'Winter lets'.         
   It would seem that there is little  
 demand for Council housing and none   
 available anyway!
