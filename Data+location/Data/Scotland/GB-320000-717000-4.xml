		<content>    Scotland's longest river is the    
 River Tay. It is 120 miles long.The   
 Tay starts at Ben Lui.The main places 
 it flows through are Perth, Newburgh, 
 Wormit, Dundee and Tayport then it    
 ends at the North Sea. Main sports    
 that are done on the Tay are salmon   
 fishing and boating. Two of the       
 biggest islands in the Tay are Mugdrum
 Island and Kerwhip Bank.Mugdrum Island
 is used for grazing cattle. Men go    
 over to Kerwhip Bank to shoot duck and
 geese. In the past the long reeds     
 which grow on Mugdrum and Kerwhip were
 used all over Scotland to make        
 thatched roofs on houses.             
    Many bridges cross the Tay. The    
 most famous is the Rail Bridge near   
 Dundee. The original bridge was blown 
 down in a storm in 1884, but a new one
 was built. A new road bridge connects 
 Fife with the centre of Dundee.       </content>
