		<title>04Dialect of Cowdenbeath</title>
		<content>  The Cowdenbeath dialect has changed. 
 Most elderly people surveyed agreed   
 that many words have disappeared from 
 common use in their lifetime. Some of 
 these words are; serk {skirt}, glor   
{mud}, pow {head}, tyke {rascal}, wain{
{child}, pug{engine}, gravat {scarf},  
 tawse {belt},tim {poor}, lippy {3.5   
{pounds of potatoes }, birl{spin}.     
{ meanings in blue}                    
 The majority of elderly people felt   
 that the dialect had become nearer the
 English taught in schools. American   
 words and phrases are also much more  
 in evidence than previously. Younger  
 people disagree with this and feel    
 that the dialect has not changed.     
 They do agree, however, with the older
 generation in that they think a       
 dialect is good as it is individual.  
 In fact everyone liked the dialect.
