		<title>06DALRY(KIRK) POPULATION</title>
		<content>    In 1985 the Stewartry District     
 Council estimated the population of   
 Dalry parish to be 629.There are about
 a hundred young people under the age  
 of 18. Few in the 18 to 40 age group  
 move into the area ,but many move out 
 to find work.There is a  net influx of
 older age groups as Dalry is a popular
 choice with the active retired.There  
 are still some families whose roots in
 the 'toun' go back for generations,   
 but most have chosen to settle in     
 Dalry within the last 50 years. In the
 nineteen thirties, the building of the
 Hydros brought workmen, and in the    
 1939_45 war  troops and land girls    
 were billeted in the area. Some       
 married into the local population and 
 settled here.The most recent incomers 
 are professional and business people  
 retiring from jobs in large cities    
 and from abroad.                      </content>
