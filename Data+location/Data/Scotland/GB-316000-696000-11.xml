		<title>11Lochore Meadows Activities</title>
		<content>  At the Meadows, there are several    
 organisations for naturalists, mainly 
{Friends of Lochore Meadows,}the junior
{Meadies Midgies}and{Project Peewit.}  
  Every Sunday during the summer the   
 Fife Ranger Service organises guided  
 walks in the area.                    
  One day this year, everyone at the   
 Meadows helped to build animal homes  
 around the park.We made homes for bats
 hedgehogs,kestrels and swallows.In the
 forest, we built small animal cairns  
 out of flat stones. The kestrel box   
 was put up the disused Mary Pit wheel.
 It was so high that the help of the   
 Fire Brigade had to be enlisted!      
  There is a 12 minute slide show on   
 the reclamation of Lochore Meadows.   
 Other activities include golfing,horse
 riding,putting,canoeing, sailing,     
 windsurfing and fishing.              
      Gordon Grant (10) and classmates.</content>
