		<content>   Employment in this area is made up  
 mainly of the industries of Farming,  
 Forestry and Tourism.                 
   The nine farms are predominantly    
 dairy-based and they each employ, on  
 average, two persons. There is also a 
 large Grain Merchant's and Animal Food
 Manufacturer's business at Lochhill   
 which serves the farming community and
 employs a number of people.           
   Forestry is centred on the two      
 wooded areas at Shambellie and on the 
 lower slopes of Criffel.There is a    
 large sawmill in New Abbey, employing 
 nearly fifty people, where most of the
 wood is sent for treatment.           
   Tourism is evident in the village of
 New Abbey with the ancient Sweetheart 
 Abbey,the Corn Mill and the Costume   
 Museum at Shambellie House. Serving   
 the tourists,and the local people, are
 a shop,two hotels and a tea room.     </content>
