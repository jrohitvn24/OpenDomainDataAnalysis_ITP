 children and adults.There is a club   
 for girls called the Girls Brigade.It 
 is for girls aged{5 to 16}.They have  
 entertainments like discos, parties   
 and going camping.Some seniors do     
 their Duke of Edinburgh Award.To      
 achieve this they hike,walk,camp and  
 take part in a sport.Every year they  
 have a competition and this year they 
 coloured eggs with different colours  
 of paint.Croy Girls Brigade gets      
 together with other groups and a judge
 picks the best one and that group wins
