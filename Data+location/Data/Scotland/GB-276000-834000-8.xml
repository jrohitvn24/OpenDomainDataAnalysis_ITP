		<content>  My dad and my brother get up at      
 7.00a.m. My dad works in Inverness. My
 mum works in the home. My brother goes
 to Secondary School. He is in his     
 first                                 
 year. I also have a younger brother.  
 The oldest brother is twelve, the     
 youngest is five. I am ten years old. 
  Mum goes to the Post Office on       
 Tuesday. We have a computer, a        
 television and a radio. There are lots
 of rooms in the house. We have 3 cats,
 1 ferret and a dog.                   
                                       
  FAMILY LIFE is very important in our 
 small community. There are several    
 interelated families _ grandparents,  
 aunts, uncles, cousins _ living near  
 to one another.                       
  The large old houses have            
 considerable space both inside and    
 out.                                  </content>
