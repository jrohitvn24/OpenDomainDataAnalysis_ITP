		<content>{Buzzard                               
  The buzzard eats small mammals like  
 mice,rabbits, shrews, voles and small 
 birds.There are many in Strathnairn.  
  They build their nests fifty feet or 
 higher above ground level.Usually 2-4 
 eggs are laid. The nest is built about
 two months before the eggs are laid.  
  They can fly up to 50 miles per hour.
 The chicks leave the nest after about 
 12 weeks.                             
{Kestrel                               
  The female lays 4-5 white eggs with  
 heavy reddish marking which she sits  
 on for four weeks. The male gets      
 food at first then then later on they 
 both feed the chicks till they leave  
 the nest.The adults are about pigeon  
 size and will hunt down any mammals   
 up to the size of a hare.             
  A kestrel has been spotted around the
 school playground recently.           </content>
