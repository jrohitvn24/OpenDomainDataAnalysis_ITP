		<title>12Gordon Castle</title>
		<content>   {GORDON CASTLE,}the seat of the Duke
 of Richmond and Gordon was built by   
 the Duke in 1775,a year before he     
 moved the local people to the planned 
 village outside the castle policies.  
 In 1834 a chapel was built alongside  
 the castle.                           
    In the 1930's because of the       
 pressure of death duties on the family
 the estate was sold to the Crown who  
 divided the land and rented it to     
 tenants for farming.                  
    During the Second World War 1939-45
 the castle was used to house Canadian 
 troops and at the end of the war      
 repair costs meant that part of the   
 castle was pulled down leaving only   
 the tower and some minor wings.       
    At present the building is occupied
 by General Gordon-Lennox a member of  
 the Gordon family who runs the land as
 a market garden.                      </content>
