 People in our school like to do lots  
 of different things with their spare  
 time.  One of the favourite sports is 
 football.  Lots of the boys like to   
 play football.  We have a teacher who 
 takes children skiing.  A lot of the  
 children like to do this.  Swimming is
 also popular.  Some children go to    
 swimming clubs like the Penguins which
 is held in Penicuik High School.      
 Other sport children like are cricket,
 horse riding, tennis and snooker.     
 Although most children participate in 
 sporting activities in their spare    
 time some prefer more leisurely       
 hobbies.  Fishing is a popular hobby  
 and some people also tie their own    
 flies.  Reading and playing with      
 computers are also popular.  A few    
 people prefer things like model making
 and bird watching.                    </content>
