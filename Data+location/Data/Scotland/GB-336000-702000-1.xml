		<title>01Leven:Landward Area.</title>
		<content>  The study area consists of very      
 fertile land which is intensely       
 cultivated.                           
  The land is undulating and slopes    
 from the North-west to South-east.The 
 highest point being 185m the lowest   
 being sea level.There are no rivers   
 but the area is drained by several    
 small streams which flow into the     
 Firth of Forth.                       
  There are ten farms. But there are no
 villages or towns but the town of     
 Leven is nearby.The area is well      
 served by roads which radiate from    
 Leven.There are no railway lines now  
 although there is evidence of one     
 which used to be a goods line between 
 Kennoway and Largoward.               
  The climate experienced in the area  
 assists the farmers.The number of     
 frost free days is below average for  
 the British Isles.Rainfall,too,is low.</content>
