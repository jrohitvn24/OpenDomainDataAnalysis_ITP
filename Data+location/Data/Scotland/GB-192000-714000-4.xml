		<title>04HOW TWO BURNS WERE NAMED</title>
		<content> (N.B. Burn= Stream)                   
 In 1294 a battle took place which gave
 two burns their names.The battle was  
 between the MacDougalls of Lorn and   
 the Campbells of Loch Awe whose       
 leader was Cailean Mor.(That means    
 Big Colin)They met(or were meant to)at
 a burn called the Conference Burn     
 .It got its name because they were    
 going to have a conference there.That 
 same burn was the border of their     
 lands,but before they met the         
 MacDougalls look in their crystal ball
 to see what would happen and the      
 crystal ball broke.This made them late
 for the meeting.When the Campbells    
 went to the meeting place,the         
 MacDougalls were not there so the     
 Campbells went onto the MacDougalls   
 ground and that is went a big battle  
 started.
