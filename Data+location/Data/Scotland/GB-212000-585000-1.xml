		<title>01The Colmonell Area</title>
		<content> Colmonell is a small village          
 (population 154) situated in the      
 valley of the river Stinchar in south 
 Ayrshire.                             
 It is a village with many links with  
 the past as can be seen by the castles
 which virtually encircle it.The ruins 
 of Craigneil to the south,Knockdolian 
 to the west and Kirkhill in the heart 
 of the village all bear witness to the
 areas past history.                   
 The parish church is believed to have 
 been established by Colmon,a follower 
 of St Ninian who was perhaps          
 Scotland's first missionary in around 
 400 AD.The church is justifably famous
 for its fine stained glass windows and
 also for it's churchyard which        
 contains the remains of Matthew       
 McLlwraith,a martyr of Covenanter     
 times.
