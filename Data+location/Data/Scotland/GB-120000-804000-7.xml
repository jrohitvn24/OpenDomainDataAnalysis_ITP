 The population today is 17 people.    
 During the last 50 years it has not   
 been above 40 people. The highest     
 population recorded was in 1821 when  
 436 lived on the island. Hovever due  
 to the clearances of people to make   
 way for sheep this had fallen to 127  
 by 1861.                              
 The population has slowly declined    
 ever since, although as can be seen   
 from the age breakdown of the current 
 population this trend might be        
 reversed. (see chart on next page)    
 The age distribution has changed      
 greatly over the last 10 years as     
 older members of the community have   
 died or moved away. This has led to a 
 reduced use of Gaelic Language on the 
 island although more than 25% of the  
 population can speak it fluently and  
 more than 50% can understand some.    </content>
