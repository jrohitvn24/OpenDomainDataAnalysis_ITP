		<content> Built in conjunction with a modern    
 shopping centre the library and arts  
 centre, in Buccleuch Street, provide  
 facilities second to none in relation 
 to the size of the town. Although     
 within the one building, the arts     
 centre is operated independently of   
 the library although both come under  
 the jurisdiction of the Recreation and
 Leisure Department of Midlothian      
 District Council. The library is      
 spacious and well-equipped with books,
 records and show cases. The arts      
 centre can be divided into two parts  
 and is a favourite place for coffee   
 mornings as well as exhibitions and   
 concerts. One of the best places in   
 Scotland makes possible the           
 presentation of first rate concerts.
