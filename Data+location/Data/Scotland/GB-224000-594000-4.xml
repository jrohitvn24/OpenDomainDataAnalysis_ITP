		<content> Barr Primary School, being one of     
 several small rural schools in the    
 Carrick area, comprises of two        
 class-rooms,G.P.room,staff-room and   
 toilets.The pupils are divided into   
 primaries 1-3 and 4-7.Most of the     
 twenty-six pupils are from outlying   
 farms and are transported to and from 
 school by  the school taxis which are 
 based in the village.During the winter
 many farm roads are blocked with snow 
 and pupils are often absent for weeks 
 at a time until the snow plough can   
 clear the roads.All pupils take school
 lunches(58 pence per day)which are    
 cooked in the school's kitchen by the 
 cook who lives in the village.Before  
 attending the village school,         
 pre-school children can attend the    
 village playgroup.When pupils reach   
 the age of eleven they transfer to    
 Girvan Academy(13km.from Barr).       </content>
