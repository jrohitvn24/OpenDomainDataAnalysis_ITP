		<content>   There are presently two churches    
 being used in this  block situated    
 on the main road from Lochinver to    
 Drumbeg.{                             
{                                      
{Free Church of Scotland               
 There has been no parish minister for 
 at least a year but the church is     
 still regularly attended by the       
 elderly congregation.The services are 
 held by the elders or visiting        
 ministers.There is also a{Free Church 
{Sunday School}which two pupils attend.
 Both the Church and the Manse are in  
 need of extensive costly repairs.{    
{                                      
{Free Presbyterian Church              
 Again this church has a small elderly 
 congregation.There is no minister at  
 this Church either. However the parish
 manse at Lochinver has been restored  
 and a minister has been called.       </content>
