		<content> Biography of a farmer                 
 He gets up at 6.45a.m. He then speaks 
 to his men and tells them what jobs to
 do for the day. After that he goes to 
 his office to deal with the mail.     
 Breakfast is at 7.15.a.m.  Most of the
 day is spent speaking to travellers   
 such as seed merchants or fertilizer  
 representatives. He goes round the    
 fields with these travellers finding  
 out what is best for the crops. 12    
 noon is lunch and 5.p.m. is tea and if
 the weather is good he will help work 
 till dark. Our farmer spends a lot of 
 time at meetings as he is a committee 
 member of the National Farmers'Union.
