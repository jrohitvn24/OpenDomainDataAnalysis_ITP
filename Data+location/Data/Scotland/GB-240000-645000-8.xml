		<title>08FARMING IN STEWARTON AREA</title>
		<content> As dairy farms are predominant the    
 most popular breed is Friesian or     
 British Holstein with a very few pure 
 Ayrshire or cross bred animals.Many   
 farms have milking parlours and milk  
 is collected by tankers and taken to  
 Milk Marketing Board creameries. The  
 farm buildings consist of the main    
 farm dwelling house, usually white,   
 and joined on to it housing for the   
 cattle. Storage for feeding stuffs is 
 usually in separate barns or sheds.   
 Most farms are owner occupied and     
 farmed by the farmer and helped by    
 some of his family with few other farm
 workers. Farmers' daughters find      
 employment in towns as do some of the 
 sons now. Some of the upland farms    
 have sheep and beef cattle which they 
 rear for sale in Kilmarnock, Paisley, 
 or Ayr markets.
