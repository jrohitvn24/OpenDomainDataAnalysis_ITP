		<title>09ABERDEEN: ROAD SAFETY.</title>
		<content> A Lollypop Man (or Lady) is a person  
 employed by the council to help       
 children safely across roads. He has a
 a round sign on a pole that looks like
 lollypop - a children's sweet. The    
 sign says STOP CHILLDREN.             
                                       
 There are two Lollypop Men in the area
 near Seaton School.                   
                                       
                                       
 When they want the traffic to stop    
 they walk in the road and hold up     
 their sign. The cars stop and the     
 children cross.                       
                                       
 Some Lollypop Men are retired from    
 their normal jobs and just do it to   
 make a bit extra. One said he         
 liked the job because he meets all the
 boys and girls.                       
                                       </content>
