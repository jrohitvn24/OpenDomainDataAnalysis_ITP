		<content> John Cairncross has been an           
 invalid,confined to a wheelchair,since
 1951,when he broke his neck while     
 playing rugby when a scrum collapsed. 
 John has maintained his connection    
 with the Jedforest Rugby Club ever    
 since.He was Secretary for a large    
 part of the 1960's and 1970's,and was 
 Club President in 1981.               
 In spite of being an invalid,John     
 plays his part in the community,thanks
 mainly to his father for taking him   
 around.                               
 Recently John was responsible for the 
 start of an effort to raise Â£27,000   
 for a Heart Scanner for Peel          
 Hospital,which is still the main      
 hospital in the Borders,though        
 Huntlyburn is well on the way.Â£23,000 
 has already been raised,several       
 thousands of this in Jedburgh.
