     Attached to the Ashgrove Filling  
 Station is a shop which is a boon to  
 the local people who would otherwise  
 have to travel 5 miles to either      
 Huntly or Keith for shopping as very  
 few travelling shops now visit the    
 rural districts.                      
                                       
     Not only local people use the     
 shop. Many passers-by stop to make    
 purchases and people stopping for     
 petrol quite often buy other things as
 well.                                 
                                       
    As well as groceries; newspapers   
 and clothing - particularly anoraks   
 and wellington boots - are for sale.
