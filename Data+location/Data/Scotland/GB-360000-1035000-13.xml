		<title>13LOCAL OPINION ON "POOL"</title>
		<content>  We interviewed Mr John  Groat,       
 North Myre, who owns the land on      
 which the excavation is situated. He  
 is very interested in "the dig" and   
 helped the archaeologists with the    
 initial removal of the soil which     
 covered the site, and has maintained a
 strong interest in the project.       
 Although Mr Groat will not receive any
 payment for the use of the land, the  
 site will be filled in and re-seeded  
 when the project is finished. Mr Groat
 also holds the opinion that since the 
 excavation was started there have been
 many more tourists to the South End,  
 and along with the trade brought from 
 the boarding of the archaeologists    
 this has greatly increased the social 
 activities of the area.
