 Allarburn Farm, just west of Elgin,   
 has been owned by the Taylor family   
 since 1923.  It keeps 60 milking cows 
 and 90 younger ones, Guernseys.  About
 120 gallons of milk per day go to the 
 Allarburn Dairy Ltd.  Along with milk 
 from other farms this is delivered in 
 Elgin and in the smaller towns and    
 villages within a radius of 15 miles. 
 Allarburn also keeps hens - 18500 of  
 them.  They lay about 75000 eggs each 
 week.  Three men are employed to look 
 after the cows and four full-time and 
 three part-time to look after the     
 hens.
