		<title>19ENTERTAINMENT IN DALRY(KIRK)</title>
		<content>    Dalry is used to making its own    
 entertainment, though the advent of   
 T.V,.at present available on three    
 channels with a fourth one promised   
 soon, and Videos has considerably     
 reduced the popularity of dances and  
 whist drives.Discos held in the Town  
 Hall are popular with the young folk  
 and attract youth from outside the    
 area.An enthusiastic drama group      
 presents an annual pantomime which is 
 full of local colour.Occasionally they
 do a one act play or a revue to raise 
 money for a special cause.There is an 
 annual parish social and throughout   
 the year there are a series of Coffee 
 Mornings and 'Teas' to raise money for
 charities The Music Club,subsidised by
 the Scottish Arts Council,each year   
 organise four concerts of classical   
 music performed  by professional      
 musicians.                            </content>
