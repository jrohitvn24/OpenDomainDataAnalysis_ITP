		<title>09UNEMPLOYMENT (1980s) DUNDEE</title>
		<content>  IN April 1985 an estimated 7000      
 people in the West End of Dundee were 
 unemployed. The job vacancies for     
 Dundee as a whole were estimated at   
 385, which meant 42 people chasing    
 every job. Many teenagers now are     
 unemployed, whereas in the 1930s it   
 was mostly men who were unemployed.   
 There is concern at the human cost of 
 unemployment with increasing crime etc
{ Dundee District Council,}working with
 the{Scottish Development Agency}and   
 other such bodies, are opting for     
{"self-employed systems",}in the hope  
 that any skilled workers who set up a 
 business will employ unskilled labour 
 and so alleviate the unemployment     
 figures.{The Blackness Project}is a   
 prime example of this scheme. One     
 aspect of this scheme must be noted:  
 for every five businesses set up,only 
 two are reasonably successful.        </content>
