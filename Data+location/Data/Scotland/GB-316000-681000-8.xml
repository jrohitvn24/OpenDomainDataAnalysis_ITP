		<content> Children between the ages of 5 and 12 
 attend either of two primary schools. 
 The first school built, Dalgety Bay   
 Primary, was traditionally designed   
 with individual classrooms. All the   
 classrooms form a square round a      
 central courtyard. A main feature of  
 these classrooms is the large glass   
 windows. This school also incorporates
 a nursery which offers pre-school     
 activities. The more recent school,   
 Donibristle Primary completed in 1979,
 is an open plan school where          
 individual classrooms do not exist.   
 Instead there are open areas with     
 class teachers and pupils from        
 different classes sharing space and   
 materials. Parents now have a choice  
 as to which school they send their    
 children. Normally they send their    
 children to the school which is closer
 to their home.                        </content>
