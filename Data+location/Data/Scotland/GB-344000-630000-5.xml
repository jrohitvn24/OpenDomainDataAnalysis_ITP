		<title>05THE GENERAL AREA</title>
		<content> This area is the north of Selkirk and 
 comprises three estates Fairnilee,    
 Yair and Sunderland Hall.  The rest   
 of the ground is forest and rough     
 pasture.                              
 Some of the land incorporates the     
 north common of Selkirk and is land   
 granted to the town by Royal Charter. 
 The forests are partly mixed wood and 
 partly conifer grown as a cash crop.  
 The three hills are Linglie, Peat Law 
 and Cribs Hill.                       
 The Three Brethern are three piles of 
 stones which mark the northern limit  
 of the towns lands.  Each year a      
 cavalcade of horses go out to the     
 Three Brethern when they ride the     
 town's marches.                       
 The Ettrick and the Tweed are         
 principal waterways and flow through  
 the area.                             
                                       </content>
