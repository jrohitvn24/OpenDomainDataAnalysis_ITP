  The housing in this area is varied.  
 There are the larger houses, usually  
 farm houses, the farm cottages, old   
 cottages which have been very         
 attractively renovated, the local     
 authority houses and new              
 bungalows.There is a mixture of home  
 ownership and rented property. The    
 farm cottages not required for farm   
 workers are rented privately. Some of 
 the local authority tenants have      
 recently taken up the option of       
 purchasing their houses.              
 Of Architectural Interest is the Lunan
 Bay hotel. This was originaly a       
 Georgian Mansion House, of which it is
 a fine example.It was built in 1815   
 and extended in 1850 by the Blair     
 Imrie family who also laid out the    
 most attractive grounds.
