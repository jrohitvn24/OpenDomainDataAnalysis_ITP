		<title>15INTERVIEW WITH FARMER</title>
		<content>{MR. STEWART OF CABBAGEHALL FARM}has   
 been farming here for 15 years and is 
 the second generation to have farmed  
 here.  The present farmhouse is 12    
 years old.  Farming is mixed arable   
 and the crops are cereals: mostly     
 barley, some wheat, potatoes and      
 turnips.  Wheat is most profitable.   
 The outdoor life of farming appeals to
 Mr. Stewart.  His farm is 284 acres.  
 He enjoys bowling as a leisure        
 activity.                             
 He feels there will be big changes in 
 farming in the future; farms could be 
 merged into larger units and machinery
 will become larger.  This is a good   
 area to farm because soil and weather 
 conditions are satisfactory.  He feels
 his life is pleasant and expects his  
 family to farm; his wife is involved  
 in the running of the business too.
