		<title>17FORTH AND CLYDE CANAL</title>
		<content>     Construction began on the Forth   
 and Clyde Canal in June 1768. The main
 problem was the Dullatur bog. It had  
 to be drained using ditches which led 
 into the Bonny Water and the River    
 Kelvin. The total cost of the canal   
 was Â£330,000. This was much more than 
 the estimate of Â£147,337.             
     In 1812 there a passenger         
 service began on the canal            
 running from Glasgow to Edinburgh. In 
 1893 day trips were started on a boat 
 was called The Fairy Queen which was  
 brought  into operation by James      
 Aitken. These trips kept up until the 
 second world war.                     
 Nowadays the canal is used for        
 pleasure and not for trade. Anglers   
 enjoy the coarse fishing there and    
 many competitions are held every year.
