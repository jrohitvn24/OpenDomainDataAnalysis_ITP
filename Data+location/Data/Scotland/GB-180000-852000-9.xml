		<title>09FISHING WITH MY DAD</title>
		<content>    MY DAD IS A FISHERMAN.   HE FISHES 
 FOR PRAWNS IN A BOAT WITH MY UNCLE.   
 THE NAME OF THE BOAT IS FRAMS BRO 1.  
    I WENT FISHING WITH MY DAD,AND I   
 THREW FISH TO THE SEAGULLS.   I HAVE  
 TO WEAR A SAFETY HARNESS WHEN I GO ON 
 THE BOAT.   I DO NOT LIKE THE BOAT    
 BECAUSE I FEEL SEA-SICK.   MY DAD DOES
 NOT CATCH MUCH FISH, IF HE DOES, HE   
 USES IT FOR BAIT.                     
    MY DAD HELPED TO BUILD THE FISH    
 FARM CAGES.   THEY GROW SALMON IN THE 
 CAGES.   THEY HAVE JUST LANDED THE    
 FIRST LOAD.   IT WAS TAKEN BY LORRY TO
 INVERNESS AND SENT BY AIR TO AMERICA. 
    MY DAD GOES FISHING A 6.30. A.M.   
 AND COMES HOME AT 5 P.M.   THE PRAWNS 
 ARE TAKEN TO THE VILLAGE BY MY UNCLE  
 AND THEN PICKED UP BY THE LORRY AND   
 TAKEN TO GAIRLOCH.                    
                                       
                                       </content>
