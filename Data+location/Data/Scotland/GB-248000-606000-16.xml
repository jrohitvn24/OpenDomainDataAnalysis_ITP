		<content> Inside the church is light and airy.  
 The floor of the nave slopes slightly 
 towards the pulpit and communion      
 table at the east end.  There is a    
 narrow gallery at the west end.       
 Pillars of cast iron, painted, support
 the roof.                             
                                       
 There are several memorials to local  
 people in the church.  Five of these  
 are stained glass windows which       
 include in them references to mining  
 which was until recently the major    
 employer in the district.  Mounted on 
 the walls are duplicate memorials to  
 two men who died last century serving 
 in India.                             
                                       
 The church itself was built for and   
 given  to the village by the Cathcart 
 family of Craigengillan on the far    
 side of the Doon valley.              </content>
