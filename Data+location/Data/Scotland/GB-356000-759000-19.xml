		<title>19SUNDAY IN BRECHIN</title>
		<content> On most Sundays my family has a long  
 lie in bed until 10 or 11a.m. to      
 recover from the entertainments of    
 Saturday night.We then have a large,  
 proper breakfast of bacon and eggs and
 toast.There is never time for this on 
 weekdays.All the family then have     
 a read of the papers (Sunday Mail and 
 Sunday Post).In good weather my Dad   
 works in the garden and I lie and     
 sunbathe and listen to the pop music  
 on Radio One. Mum does her housework. 
 If it rains we all watch the film     
 matinee on TV. At 5p.m. we get Sunday 
 dinner ready, usually roast beef,     
 vegtables and potatoes. After we have 
 finished everyone is so full that we  
 sometimes doze off.In the evening I   
 stay at home to have a bath and get   
 ready for school next day. I find     
 Sunday the most boring day of the     
 week.                                 </content>
