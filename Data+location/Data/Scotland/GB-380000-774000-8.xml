		<content> Some of the{farm cottages}(cottar     
 houses) and crofts have fallen into   
 decay, but several have been bought   
 and attractively renovated by people  
 who work outside the area.  There is  
 one site of four{council-owned houses,
 built 30 years ago, and recently      
 doubled-glazed, with new kitchens     
 installed to bring them up to present 
 day standards.  All the houses are    
 stone built with slate roofs, but few 
 are of recent construction because of 
 the{Disrict Council's policy}of not   
 allowing sporadic housebuilding in    
 rural areas unless specifically       
 required for agricultural workers.This
 controversial policy has just been    
 revoked.Although within commuting     
 distance of Aberdeen there is no      
 vacant housing available.
