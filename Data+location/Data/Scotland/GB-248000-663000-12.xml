		<title>12ST. MIRREN - PAISLEY</title>
		<content> St. Mirren Football Club, founded in  
 1877, is Paisley's only senior club.  
 Under the management of Alex Ferguson 
 ('Fergy'), the Love St. club were pro-
 moted to the Premier League in 1977   
 and have been there ever since.  In   
 recent seasons crowds have seriously  
 declined. This has resulted in St.    
 Mirren having to sell some of its best
 players to meet heavy financial comm- 
 itments.  Thus star forward Frank     
 McAvennie has left the club for West- 
 ham, although St. Mirren have signed  
 Frank McGarvie,a former 'Saints' play-
 er, from Celtic.                      
 Post-war highlights include the Scott-
 ish Cup victory of 1959 and the First 
 Division Championship win in Centenary
 Year 1977.  The Paisley club now look 
 forward to European football next sea-
 son, having qualified for the U.E.F.A.
 cup.                                  </content>
