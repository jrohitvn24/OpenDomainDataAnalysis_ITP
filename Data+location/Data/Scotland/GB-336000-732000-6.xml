		<content> Here are some of the games children in
 our area play:                        
{Wally} For this game you will need    
 more than two players, a tennis ball, 
 and a blank wall.  Draw a line about  
 one metre up the wall and another on  
 the ground.  The object of the game is
 to kick the ball above the line on the
 wall and after the line on the ground.
 Each player takes a turn.             
{Kick the Can}  To play this game you  
 need about 6 players and a tin can.   
 The game is like {Hide and Seek}except
 that if you are caught you hope that  
 some of the others will make it back  
 to base, kick the can away, and so    
 free you again.                       
{Football Tennis }2 players are needed 
 (4 for doubles), a wall or a net about
 one metre high and a tennis ball.It's 
 like real tennis only you use your    
 head, knees or feet to hit the ball.  </content>
