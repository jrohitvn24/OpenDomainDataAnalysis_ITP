		<title>07EMPLOYMENT IN DALRY(KIRK)</title>
		<content>    The main employers in the Glenkens 
 area are farmers,the South of Scotland
 Electricity Board,the Forestry        
 Commission and private forestry, and  
 the District Council Roads Dept.      
 There are few full time jobs for women
 but part time and seasonable work is  
 available in the hotels and shops and 
 as home help to the many elderly folk.
 Self employed tradesmen include a     
 plumber,joiner,builder, house         
 painter, slater and car mechanics.Some
 Dalry residents travel daily as far as
 Dumfries to their work, but others,   
 including teachers nurses and oilrig  
 workers, get home only periodically.  
    Over the last ten years,despite the
 increasing lack of vacancies, there   
 have never been more than 5 people    
 under 18 unemployed. Over 18, numbers 
 are slightly higher but all usually   
 find employment eventually.           </content>
