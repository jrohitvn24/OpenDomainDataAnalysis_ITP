		<title>16Old Limestone Quarry.</title>
		<content> "Dirty Dicks" 283667 is the nickname  
 of an old limestone quarry. It is now 
 a pond filled with old scrap cars. It 
 also has fish in it, such as pike and 
 perch.It is believed to be bottomless.
 Some people go for a swim there,but I 
 wouldn't as the pike bite your toes!  
 The ground is hilly and rough.People  
 go scrambling on motorbikes there.    
 On the other side towards Loanhead,   
 are gypsies.A long time ago the       
 gypsies used to steal you and take you
 away.                                 
 Nearby there is a clump of woods      
 called the{Deanies.}Trees are now     
 being taken away to make way for a    
 dual carriageway.Once there was a dead
 body found in these woods in a black  
 plastic bag.        KENNY MANTLE.
