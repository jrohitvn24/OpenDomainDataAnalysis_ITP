		<title>12FLANDERS MOSS NEAR GARTMORE</title>
		<content> S.W. of Gartmore, near to Offerance   
 Farm, lies{Flanders Moss,}the last    
 remaining part of a huge{raised bog   
 formed after the last Ice-Age. The    
 moss-lands used to stretch along the  
 Forth Valley to Stirling, but now much
 has been drained and reclaimed for    
 farmland or forestry. The Caledonia   
 Peat Company cut peat for fuel and for
 garden compost and the few remaining  
{bogs}are in danger of drying out, as  
 surrounding land drains and trees take
 over. The{Nature Conservancy Council  
 and the{Scottish Wildlife Trust}are   
 trying to preserve the last bogs as a 
{Nature Reserve.}Wildlife}includes:    
 curlew, redshank, meadow pippet,      
 grouse, butterflies and red ants.     
 Plants include: species of{spagnum    
{moss,}heathers, cotton-grass, sun-dews
 and a rare flower the{Labrador Tea,   
 like a small white rhododendron.      </content>
