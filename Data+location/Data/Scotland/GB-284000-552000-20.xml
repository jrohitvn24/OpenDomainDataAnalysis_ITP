		<content>   Most people in this area have cars. 
 Without a car it would be difficult to
 get anywhere.It takes about half an   
 hour to drive to Dumfries.            
   There is a regular bus service run  
 by Carruthers from Dumfries to Rock-  
 cliffe.The bus goes along the coast   
 road calling at little villages on the
 way.The journey takes an hour and a   
 quarter. There are four buses each    
 day and three on Sundays.             
   A private mini-bus goes from Barend 
 Holiday Camp,Sandyhills to Dalbeattie.
 It will pick up passengers but usually
 only if this has been arranged in     
 advance.                              
   In school term time a School Bus    
 takes the children from outlying areas
 to Dalbeattie Primary School,and all  
 the children to the Secondary School. 
 It passes our school gates twice a day
 but no one gets off or on!            </content>
