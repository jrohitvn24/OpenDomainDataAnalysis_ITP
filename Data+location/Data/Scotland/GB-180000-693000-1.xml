		<title>01The Moss</title>
		<content> Known locally as 'the moss' the area  
 was part of the large Poltalloch      
 estate.  Most of the land and houses  
 have been sold to private ownership.  
 The farms are run by the farmer alone 
 with casual help at busy periods      
 (lambing, haymaking, potato picking   
 etc).  Of the 22 houses 2 remain      
 3 holiday and the remaining 17 owned  
 by people working locally.  Several   
 houses do bed &amp; breakfast for tourists
 who come to see the standing stones &amp; 
 Dunadd hill where the Kings of        
 Scotland were crowned .  The river Add
 meanders through.  Once a good Salmon 
 river , now few run due to constant   
 netting at the mouth.  Some land has  
 had substantial money spent on        
 drainage but it is questionable as to 
 whether it has been worth while.  Some
 bog land has been forrested.  In the  
 past few years the Nature Conservancy </content>
