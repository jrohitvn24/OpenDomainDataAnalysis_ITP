		<content>{PLANNED SHOPPING MALL                 
  The controversial new shopping mall  
 is to be built in the area bordered by
 High Street,South Street,Scott Street 
 and King Edward Street,taking in      
 St John's Square and the surrounding  
 shops.                                
  The people formerly living in the    
 square have been rehoused in new flats
 in South Street.The St John's Square  
 shops have been moved to new premises 
 elsewhere in the town.One of the      
 larger shops,British Home Stores,has  
 had its floor space reduced while     
 demolition work is carried out.When   
 the mall is finally completed this    
 B.H.S. will be twice its present size.
  The shopping mall,estimated to cost  
 around Â£20m is due for completion in  
 1987.Demolition of the existing square
 is to be carried out by a local firm, 
 Dow Brothers.                         </content>
