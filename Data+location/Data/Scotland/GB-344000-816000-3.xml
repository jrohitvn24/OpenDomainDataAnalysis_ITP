 Gamekeepers are employed by the       
 estates to keep the farm lands free   
 of rabbits and to keep stocks of      
 grouse pheasants and patridges for the
 shooting parties in the autumn. At    
 these shoots many local people are    
 employed as beaters. The keepers also 
 keep the area free of foxes. There is 
 a carpenters business at Milltown of  
 Kildrummy employing three carpenters  
 who undertake all the joinery work in 
 the area and further afield. The staff
 at the Kildrummy Castle Gardens live  
 in the community and the estate       
 employs a forester.The catering and   
 domestic staff at the Inn and the     
 Kildrummy Castle Hotel are drawn from 
 the local community .There are two    
 teachers who teach at schools a few   
 miles from Kildrummy.                 </content>
