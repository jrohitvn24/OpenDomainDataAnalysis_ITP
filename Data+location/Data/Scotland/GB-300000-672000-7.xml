		<title>07COUNTRY PARK.</title>
		<content> When you go to our country park there 
 are many things the visitor can find  
 of interest.                          
   The whole park covers 700 acres but 
 most of it is outside our survey.We do
 have most of the activities that can  
 be enjoyed in  our area.As well as    
 canoeing,sailing,archery and climbing 
 there is fishing for trout and        
 orienteering.                         
 A bird-watching group has been started
 at the centre. People watch out for   
 early summer visitors such as         
 swallows,martins and warblers. The    
 resident birds on the loch provide a  
 year round interest.                  
 Our park provides the public with all 
 the things mentioned above. With its  
 mixed woodland, crags and water the   
 park is a very pleasant place to      
 visit.
