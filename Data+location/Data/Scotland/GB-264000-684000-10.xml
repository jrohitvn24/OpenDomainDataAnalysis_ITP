		<content> This area consists of relatively steep
 land of{igneous}origin which has been 
 covered by deposits of{boulder clay}  
 and{glacial sands and gravels.}The    
 River Endrick has exposed softer{     
{sedimentary}rocks and eaten a steep   
 sided valley up as far as the{Fintry  
{Loup}(665.861). This is a spectacular 
 waterfall formed where the river      
 plunges over a series of lava flows.  
                                       
{Loch Walton,}for some time a fish     
 nursery, was formed after the ice age 
 amongst various{glacial deposits.}The{
{Carron Reservoir}is the other large   
 tract of water in the area. It was    
 formed by damming the Carron Valley   
 and provides water locally and to the 
 Grangemouth area.                     
                                       
 The highest point in this square is   
 321m.                                 </content>
