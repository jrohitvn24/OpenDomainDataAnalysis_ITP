 Limerigg is situated 220 metres above 
 sea-level. The gradient is steep and  
 in winter,Limerigg is often colder    
 than the neighbouring villages. The   
 surrounding ground is mainly of rough 
 grass,thus the area is very exposed to
 the prevailing south-westerly wind    
 and in winter drifting as well as     
 heavy snow is a problem. The Black    
 Loch sometimes freezes over completely
 and the children, supervised by       
 adults,are able to ice-skate around   
 the edge.                             
 In summer,the weather can be very     
 pleasant and after a spell of hot     
 weather,both children and adults from 
 near and far come to enjoy a day's    
 swimming in the loch.
