		<title>06The Sub-Warden, Glenalmond</title>
		<content> The Sub-Warden's job in the College is
 to supervise functions, to liase      
 between the Warden and masters and to 
 stand in for the Warden when absent.  
{He believes that the boys in the      
{school have been pressured by big     
{business,advertising and the pop      
{culture.}The responsibility has been  
 taken away from us and since we throw 
 away our money, we are vulnerable to  
 the money-makers.                     
 He believes the level of discipline in
 the community to have been kept to a  
 reasonable standard but more response 
 could be given to authority.  The     
 punishments for the breaking of rules,
 e.g. smoking or drinking, are not a   
 sufficient deterrent.{Beating has been
{phased out due to outside pressure.}  
 The gullible attitude of the school   
 has increased but the discipline has  
 remained at the same level.           </content>
