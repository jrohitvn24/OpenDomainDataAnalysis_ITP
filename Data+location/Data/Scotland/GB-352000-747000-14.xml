		<title>14ANGUS HEATHERS</title>
		<content>   For nine years now{ANGUS HEATHERS   
 has been a great attraction for       
 visitors to Letham. Mr &amp; Mrs Sturrock 
 who own the heather farm are busy     
 every week-end and busiest during Bank
 Holidays and over Easter and the May  
 Week-end. They employ four permanent  
 workers and take on casual workers    
 when necessary.                       
  The owners had been surprised to find
 that "Lucky White Heather" on sale to 
 tourists at Inverness Castle had come 
 from Surrey in England, so on retiring
 from his job as an Income Tax         
 Inspector, Mr Sturrock decided to     
 begin Heather Farming which was a new 
 idea at the time.                     
  They have 140 varieties of heathers  
 for sale but do not send orders by    
 post and cannot export heathers unless
 they are inspected for diseases first.
