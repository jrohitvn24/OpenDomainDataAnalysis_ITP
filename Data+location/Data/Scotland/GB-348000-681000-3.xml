		<content> Allan Campbell was born in Gullane in 
 1907 and has lived at 1 Hall Crescent 
 since 1936,he is 78 years old. When he
 was young he travelled to Edinburgh by
 train. He went to school in Gullane,  
 the building is now used as a library 
 and play group hall.                  
 The bank corner was once occupied by  
 cottages,and there were no houses on  
 Main Street. Middleshot Road was      
 mainly grassy fields with football    
 pitches.                              
 Most children were given a shilling a 
 week and some earned more by caddying 
 and doing paper rounds.There were not 
 many clubs only Scouts,Guides,Boys    
 Brigade and football,there was also   
 Sunday School.In 1928 Gullane tennis  
 courts were built and in 1930 new     
 houses were built so Gullane's        
 population increased and everything   
 improved.                             </content>
