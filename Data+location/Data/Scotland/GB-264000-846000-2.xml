		<content> The Inner Moray Firth is an important 
 habitat for wildfowl and waders.Teal, 
 mallard,widgeon and shelduck come     
 south to the mudflats every winter for
 worms and small shellfish.Waders nest 
 in the saltmarsh past the harbour all 
 round to Longman Bay.The harbour      
 extension and the dump have soiled it 
 for them.Herring and greater black-   
 backed gulls now swoop over the dump  
 all year round.Guillemots,goosanders  
 and mergansers feed on sprats in      
 November and December.In summer       
 fishing boats came in for them,and    
 for the small herring called Kessocks.
 It was overfished.Now there is a      
 fishery order against it.People       
 sailing in the Firth have bottle nosed
 dolphins and porpoises nudging their  
 boats.There are sea trout and flat    
 fish for angling,but you mustn't poach
 the Queen's salmon.                   </content>
