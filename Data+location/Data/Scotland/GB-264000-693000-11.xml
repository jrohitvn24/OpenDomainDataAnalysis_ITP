		<title>11DUNCAN'S DAY</title>
		<content> A Typical Day in the Life of Duncan   
 I get up at 6.45, make my bed get     
 dressed. I have my brekfast at 7.30. I
 have a bowl of Start and a bowl of    
 porridge and two slices of toast and a
 biscuit. Then I look out the window to
 see what my Dad is doing on our farm. 
 Then I see the taxi is coming so I    
 take my bag and go into the taxi which
 takes me to school. At school I do    
 Maths, English and Art. At playtime I 
 play football with my friends Peter,  
 Alan,Martin and Paul. We have lunch   
 at 12.15 and another playtime at 2.30 
 and  we go home at 3.20.Then I go home
 then I do my homework. Then I go out  
 and help my Dad on the farm by driving
 the grain trailers while my Dad drives
 the combine then I go to bed at 8.30.
