		<title>07FORMAKIN HOUSE</title>
		<content>   One of the oldest-looking houses in 
 the district is in fact among the     
 youngest. Formakin with its Lodge     
 House, the "Monkey House" (so-called  
 because of the stone monkeys adorning 
 the roof-line), and its entrance gate 
 thought to be originally from Newgate 
 Prison, was completed in 1914 by Sir  
 Robert Lorimer for John Augustus      
 Holmes of Glasgow. The main building  
 was never inhabited and was built     
 mainly to house the owner's           
 considerable collection of objets     
 d'art. The gardens were open to the   
 public in the 1930's, but the owner   
 was bankrupted in the difficult years 
 of the late 1930's, and the estate    
 sold to A.E.Pickard in 1940 for just  
 Â£7000. The house and grounds are now  
 being restored by the Formakin Trust  
 and will shortly be open to the       
 public.                               </content>
