 The main feature in our twelve km.    
 area is that it is mostly{farm land.  
 The farms in our area are{Eastfield,  
{Luggate,Overfield,Papple,Pressmennan, 
{Ruchlaw Mains,Ruchlaw West Mains,     
{Whittingehame and Yarrow.             
{   }Most of the farms are arable farms
 and when we compared our interviews we
 found that our answers were very      
 similar.For instance all the farmers  
 believed in conservation and agreed   
 that East Lothian has good soil.They  
 all said that it was one of the best  
 areas to farm in Scotland and that    
 arable farming is more suitable for   
 this area.The acres that the farmers  
 owned varied between{265 acres and 365
{acres.}The number of employees varied 
 from one to fourteen workers.
