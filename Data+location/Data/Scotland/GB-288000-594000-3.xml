		<title>03Rivers, Lochs and Burns.</title>
		<content>  In the 12 square km we are           
 researching there are lots of burns,  
 rivers and lochs.The burns are Dead   
 Burn and Kirk Burn.The rivers are the 
 Cample and Templand River. Other names
 are Curling pond, New Loch,Black Ford 
 and Gullet Spout. The Crichope Burn   
 runs for about half a mile flat and   
 then goes over a waterfall called the 
 above mentioned Gullet Spout.It also  
 has very deep pools.In the Cample you 
 can catch salmon,burn trout and sea   
 trout.New Loch got its name because it
 was a New Morton Loch but through the 
 years it has been used for curling.   
 It has shrunk over the years.Dead Burn
 runs into  Crichope. Hells Cauldron,  
 Barleys Leap Souters Seat are all deep
 pools in Crichope burn.The mill dams  
 were used in the old days.They were   
 used for power made by dams and water 
 wheels.                               </content>
