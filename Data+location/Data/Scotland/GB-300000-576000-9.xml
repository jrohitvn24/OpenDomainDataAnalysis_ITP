  23 children go to the Sunday School  
 every week from 10.00 _ 11.00am. The  
 children get split into three groups. 
 There are three teachers. One takes   
 the small ones, one takes the oldest  
 children. We read out of the Bible and
 sing hymns and pray.                  
{Church}                               
  Every Sunday at Torthorwald church a 
 service is held from 12.15 _ 1.15pm.  
 Every week there are about 30 people  
 go. It is not very busy. They sing    
 hymns, say prayers and read out of the
 Bible. The church has a split parish: 
 Collin, Kirkmichael and Torthorwald   
 share the same minister who takes     
 three services every Sunday. The      
 building itself is very old. The      
 church is in the shape of a cross.
