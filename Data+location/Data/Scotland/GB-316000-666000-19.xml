		<title>19CURRIE SCHOOL CAMP</title>
		<content> SCHOOL CAMP AT KINDROGAN FIELD CENTRE 
 WAS ACTION PACKED AND VERY TIRING. WE 
 GOT UP AT QUARTER PAST SEVEN AND GOT  
 DRESSED. AFTER BREAKFAST WE MADE OUR  
 PACKED LUNCH AND WENT TO THE          
 CLASSROOM. WE COLLECTED NETS, TRAYS,  
 JARS AND A PIPETTE. WE COLLECTED POND 
 ANIMALS AND TOOK THEM BACK TO THE     
 CLASSROOM TO IDENTIFY THEM. WE THEN   
 PUT THEM IN SMALL CONTAINERS, PUT A   
 PIECE OF PAPER BESIDE THEM AND WROTE  
 THEIR NAMES ON THEM. AFTER THIS WE    
 WENT TO THE RIVER AND DID EXACTLY     
 THE SAME.WE WORKED ON THIS TILL SEVEN 
 PM. THEN IT WAS TIME FOR DINNER.AFTER 
 DINNER WE WENT DEER WATCHING AND SAW  
 THIRTEEN DEER. AFTER DEER WATCHING IT 
 WAS TIME FOR BED. WE THOUGHT KINDROGAN
 WAS WONDERFUL AND WE WOULD GO AGAIN IF
 WE HAD THE CHANCE.                    
                                       
                                       </content>
