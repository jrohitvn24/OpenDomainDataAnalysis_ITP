		<content> Alness is a small town on the north   
 side of the Cromarty Firth. Until the 
 late 1960's its population was under  
 2,000. The main forms of employment   
 were farming,forestry and quarrying in
 the surrounding countryside with      
 distilling being the major            
 manufacturing industry.               
 The development of oil-related        
 industries in the Cromarty Firth and  
 the building of an aluminium smelter  
 at nearby Invergordon at the end of   
 the 1960's led to an influx of people 
 from other parts of the country.      
 Alness became a dormitory town and its
 population increased rapidly from     
 2,800 in 1971 to 6,300 in 1981.       
 Despite the closure of the smelter in 
 1981 and a current unemployment level 
 of 26%,the total population of the    
 town has remained around the 1981     
 level.                                </content>
