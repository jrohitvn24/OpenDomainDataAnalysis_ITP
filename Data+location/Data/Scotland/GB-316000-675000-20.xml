		<title>20CRAMOND :Craigiehall Camp</title>
		<content>   Old Craigiehall House is now the    
 Officers' Mess for the Scottish       
 offices and the high security         
 modern administration offices are in  
 the House's old walled garden. The    
 residential,catering and recreational 
 accomodation is divided up by large   
 playing fields  and woodland. The     
 river, old architecture and farmland  
 make it seem very unmilitary despite  
 the smart uniforms and the saluting.  
                        There are more 
 civilians than army personnel in the  
 camp but there is a landscaped        
 magazine for ammunition and fierce    
 guard dogs patrol the perimeter fence.
 We met the Charge Hand who is         
 responsible for the five Alsation     
 guard dogs and one sniffer dog. He    
 took us inside the dogs' compound. We 
 preferred the friendly spaniel Sam who
 had accompanied his master, our host. </content>
