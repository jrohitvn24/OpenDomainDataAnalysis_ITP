		<title>01A Corner OF The Garioch</title>
		<content> Essentially composed of a river valley
 flanked on both sides by low          
 undulating hills, the area is         
 primarily used for agriculture.   The 
 valley floor is used for dairying and 
 there are three dairy farms situated  
 within the area, supplying the nearby 
 busy town of Inverurie.   Cereals &amp;   
 fodder crops are grown extensively    
 with only the steepest tops of the    
 hills given over to rough grazing.  As
 rich in history as  is in agriculture,
 old and new co-exist with mutual      
 respect.   Great standing stones are  
 left undisturbed in the midst of the  
 intensively cultivated fields, the    
 castle ruins of Balquhuin watch, as   
 they have done for over 400 years,    
 over ever changing farming            
  methods, and the great monument of   
 Harlow is sentinel over the now       
 peaceful battleground grazed quietly  </content>
