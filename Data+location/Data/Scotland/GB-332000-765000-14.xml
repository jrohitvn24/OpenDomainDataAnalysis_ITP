 There are 120 acres of rotational     
 crops. This year there is 4 and a half
 acres of swede turnips, 14 acres of   
 spring barley and 15 acres of forage  
 rape.The turnips are pulled and fed   
 to the cattle in the winter.The       
 sheep go on to the rape in autumn to  
 eat it.The spring barley is for       
 feeding and the straw is baled for    
 bedding the cattle in the winter.     </content>
