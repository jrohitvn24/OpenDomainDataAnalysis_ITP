		<content> Over the years there have been many   
 changes in the way of life on the     
 Altyre Estate,the most striking of    
 these being the decrease in the number
 of estate workers employed.In the     
 1950s there were 25 men employedin    
 forestry work,18 estate workers,5     
 gardeners and 8 gamekeepers.Today     
 there are only 3 foresters,1 part time
 gardener and 1                        
 gamekeeper.Tractors,ploughs,cultivator
 s and machinery for loading wood have 
 led to fewer men being needed.Before  
 the Second World War there were no    
 water supplies to the houses,buses to 
 town ran once a week and several vans 
 selling food and goods called         
 regularly.Wages were paid once a month
 and workers had a five and a half day 
 week and two days holiday a           
 year.Conditions are much better but   
 people are less contented.            </content>
