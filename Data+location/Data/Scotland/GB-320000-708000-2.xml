		<title>02Strathmiglo - The Town Hall</title>
		<content> Strathmiglo Castle,which was built    
 about 1535,was built so quickly that  
 James V of Scotland nicknamed it      
 'Cairneyflappit'.It was built in a    
 field to the south east of the village
 to be near the royal court at         
 Falkland.Its former site,surrounded by
 a deep square fosse,can still be seen 
 today.'Cairneyflappit' fell into      
 disrepair,and was demolished in 1734  
 because the people of Strathmiglo     
 obtained the right to its stones,which
 were used to build the Town Hall.     
 The Town Hall consists of a square    
 tower with an open balustrade.An eight
 sided spire,twenty-one metres high,is 
 mounted on top of this.On the bottom  
 half of the tower are the arms of Lady
 Margaret Balfour,daughter of Sir      
 Michael Balfour of Burleigh,who once  
 owned the lands of Strathmiglo.
