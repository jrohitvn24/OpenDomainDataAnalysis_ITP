		<title>10MOORING AT SCORAIG</title>
		<content>   TO GET ACROSS THE LOCH FROM SCORAIG 
 YOU NEED A BOAT.MOST PEOPLE THERE HAVE
 A BOAT.NEARLY ALL THE BOATS ARE 14foot
 CLINKER BUILT.ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE OWN
 A BOAT,MOST PEOPLE SHARE A"MOORING    
 BOAT",BUT NOT ALL HAVE A SHARE IN THE 
 YAMAHA ENGINE.                        
   THE "RUNNING MOORING" WORKS WITH A  
 LONG ENDLESS ROPE THREADED THROUGH A  
 PULLEY WHICH IS ANCHORED ABOUT 10metre
 OFF THE END OF THE JETTY.THERE IS AN  
 "EYE" SPLICED INTO THE ROPE ON WHICH  
 TO ATTACH THE BOAT,SO THAT IT CAN BE  
 PULLED OUT TO THE ANCHOR.             
   THE BOAT IS SAFER OUT THERE BECAUSE 
 WHEN IT IS OUT IT HAS LESS CHANCE OF  
 GETTING BASHED ON THE ROCKS.          
   THERE IS ALSO AN ENDLESS MOORING    
 SHARED BY MOST PEOPLE,AT THE          
 BADLUARACH JETTY.
