		<title>02DALRY-LIFE IN THE COUNTRY</title>
		<content> In the country life is not as boring  
 as it may sound.  In the summer hay is
 being made. In winter cows are calving
 and in spring the sheep are lambing.  
 I live outside Dalry.  Anything I need
 I either go to Saltcoats or Irvine.  I
 work on a farm.  I live in a family of
 8,4 brothers,one sister and my mum and
 dad.  Three of my brothers work on    
 farms,one on the other side of Dalry, 
 one in Dunoon and one on the same farm
 as myself.  My other brother works as 
 a baker in Dalry.My sister is married 
 and lives in Glasgow.  My mum is a    
 housewife and my dad works in Glasgow.
 We have two dogs and a cat.  Unlike in
 the town,where neighbours can keep an 
 eye on your house,in the country your 
 nearest neighbour maybe a mile away.  
 The cat is to keep out mice.  I enjoy 
 living in the country.  It gives me a 
 sense of freedom.                     </content>
