		<content> There is no village in this block,    
 which consists almost entirely of     
 prime agricultural land farmed by six 
 farms. Mostly arable, there is some   
 permanent pasture in the park land    
 surrounding Wedderburn Castle and     
 Kimmerghame House.  The 'policy' woods
 around the latter contain some very   
 fine trees, especially along the banks
 of the Blackadder Water.  This river  
 is joined in Square 7 by the Langton  
 Burn, known locally as the Verta, and 
 is crossed by two very fine bridges;  
 at Kimmerghame Mill (Square 9) and at 
 Mouth Bridge (Square 4), the latter   
 dating from 1790.  Wedderburn Castle, 
 an 18th Century house built on the    
 site of an ancient tower of the Humes,
 is surrounded by unusually high park  
 walls.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
