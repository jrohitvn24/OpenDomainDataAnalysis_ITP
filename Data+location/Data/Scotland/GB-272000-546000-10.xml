		<title>10Industry in Dundrennan</title>
		<content> Galloway boats and Mouldings is the   
 only industrial building in the whole 
 of Dundrennan.It specialises in making
 things out of fibre glass like sheep  
 dips,canopies for pick ups,gutters,egg
 white tanks and a few boats.          
   The factory was founded ten years   
 ago in Kirkcudbright,but it moved to  
 Dundrennan about five years later.    
   About 20 men work there and two of  
 these men take goods to different     
 parts of the country.Sometimes they   
 get orders from foreign countries.    
   In the factory there are a lot of   
 compressed air machines which are     
 usually used for cutting fibre glass  
 and wood.The process of making        
 anything at the factory is,first to   
 make a mould,then put fibre glass in  
 it,leave it to set and finally remove 
 the mould and you will have the shape 
 you want.                             </content>
