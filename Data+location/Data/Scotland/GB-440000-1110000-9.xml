		<title>09CHANGING TIMES:FARMING</title>
		<content>   There are few farms but many crofts 
 of varying sizes. The traditional     
 methods of farming are still widely   
 used although crofts now have new,    
 modern machinery. This machinery may  
 be co-operatively owned.  In the past 
 crofters did not make a profit. All   
 the food and animals produced were    
 used by the crofter and his family.   
 The men usually went to the fishing in
 the summertime and so the women were  
 left to work on the land. Today many  
 crofts are worked part time with the  
 crofter working elsewhere eg. Sumburgh
 Airport.                              
   The main crops grown have not       
 changed over the years ie. potatoes,  
 turnips, cabbage, barley and grass for
 hay. On the bigger farms they now make
 silage. The biggest farm in our area  
 is Sumburgh Farm which once belonged  
 to the Laird.                         </content>
