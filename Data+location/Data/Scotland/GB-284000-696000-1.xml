		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO MENSTRIE</title>
		<content> Menstrie is a village situated in the 
 centre of Scotland. It is bordered on 
 the north side by the{Ochil Hills}and 
 is near to the River Devon. Menstrie  
 is nearly all a residential area from 
 which most working adults commute to  
 nearby Stirling, Glasgow and          
 Edinburgh. Menstrie has an active     
 village life with many clubs catering 
 for every age group.                  
 There is a surprisingly large number  
 of old folks living in Menstrie. Many 
 have spent their whole life in the    
 village.                              
 There is a large continental coach    
 hire firm based in the village.       
 When a new primary school was built, a
 Youth and Community Centre was        
 established in the old school         
 premises.
