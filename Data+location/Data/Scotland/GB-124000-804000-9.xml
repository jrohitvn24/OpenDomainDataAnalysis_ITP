 The Post Office building is a wooden  
 10ft by 8ft garden shed. It provides  
 enough room for a counter and a       
 sorting table on which the mail can be
 put into bundles for delivery to the  
 islanders. We receive four bags       
 usually from Mallaig, Fort William and
 two from Glasgow.  The main trade of  
 the Post Office is stamps although    
 other items such as postal orders,    
 registered envelopes are stocked. As  
 it is a non-cash account office it    
 does not have services such as Giro   
 bank, National Savings or Government  
 Stock Bonds.                          
 The Post Office provides employment   
 for an islander when the tendancy is  
 to go to the mainland in search of    
 work. The Post Office houses the      
 library books, which are sent from the
 mainland every three months.          </content>
