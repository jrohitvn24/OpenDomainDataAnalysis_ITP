		<content> The island is low lying with it's     
 highest point on the North Hill Bird  
 Reserve where there are low sea       
 cliffs. The remainder of the coastline
 is rocky with three silver sand       
 beaches. The majority of the land is  
 enclosed by dry stane dykes made with 
 local stone.                          
     Most of the buildings are long    
 single story, stone built cottages    
 with flagstone roofs. There are a few 
 recently built houses.                
     Holland House is the largest      
 building and is situated in the middle
 of the island. Parts of the steading  
 date from the 17th century. There are 
 other buildings around it of interest 
 including a circular mill tramp.      
     As the population declines there  
 are many vacant and derelict cottages.
