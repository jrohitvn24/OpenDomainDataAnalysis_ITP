		<title>12Peat Cutting,Wick</title>

 Families work as a team with one      
 cutting, one lifting the peats out of 
 the bank and a few others laying them 
 on the ground. It takes about one     
 month for each side of the peat to dry
 so they have to be turned. After that 
 you have to stack them in threes so   
 that the air can pass through.        
 Once they have dried they are taken   
 home by tractor or trailer and stacked
 like a black house with spaces to let 
 in the air.In winter you put a cover  
 over them, as they have to be dry to  
 burn well.                            
 A modern machine,which cuts tubular   
 peats from the bank,is now used by    
 some people to take the hard work out 
 of this task.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
