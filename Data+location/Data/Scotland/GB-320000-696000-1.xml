		<title>01KINGLASSIE AND DISTRICT</title>
		<content> The area in this 'D' block contains   
 the village of{Kinglassie}with a      
 population of about 1500, and part of 
 the town of{Auchterderran.}Both these 
 settlements developed as a result of  
{coal mining,}but the mines are now    
 exhausted. However, a huge mining     
 complex is found in the north west of 
 the area at Westfield where open pit  
 and opencast mines are located.       
 Mining obviously has a considerable   
 impact on the environment in this part
 of Fife but the other major land use  
 i.e.{agriculture}is just as important.
 Most farms are involved in either     
 arable or pastoral farming or a       
 mixture of the two.                   
 The area is not considered as a       
 favoured area in Fife because of the  
 scars left by the mining industry and 
 the generally run down appearance of  
 the settlements.                      </content>
