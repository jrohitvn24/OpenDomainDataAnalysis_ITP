		<title>15LAW &amp; ORDER IN ASSYNT</title>
		<content> Assynt has one small police station &amp; 
 a staff of one. The policeman can call
 for aid to Bonar Bridge which would   
 send up a Patrol car if necessary. He 
 can call for help from the local      
 Special Constables if necessary. The  
 commonest crimes here are Deer &amp;      
 Salmon Poaching &amp; Drunk driving       
 however incidents recorded are not    
 frequent, crimes averaging out at 4   
 per month for the whole of the        
 policemans area. The policeman's      
 busiest time is during the Summer when
 there are many visitors. People       
 charged with Crimes have to travel to 
 Dornoch Court for trial &amp; sentence.   
 All in all we are lucky to live in a  
 relative crime-free area.
