		<title>08Employment in Stirling</title>
		<content>  We did a small survey in Stirling. We
 interviewed thirty-five people. Five  
 of them were unemployed. They had     
 dismal views of the prospect of       
 finding a job. They had been out of   
 work from four months to one year.    
   Of those who were employed two were 
 manual workers, five were professional
 persons, six worked in offices and    
 seventeen gave a service to the       
 public.                               
   For High School pupils and students 
 there are many casual jobs such as    
 babysitting, delivery of newspapers,  
 milk, advertisement leaflets;         
 restocking shelves and pricing items  
 in department stores. These casual    
 jobs subsidise them until they leave  
 school. This year it is expected that 
 a lot of small shops will have to     
 close down because of the revaluation 
 of rates.                             </content>
