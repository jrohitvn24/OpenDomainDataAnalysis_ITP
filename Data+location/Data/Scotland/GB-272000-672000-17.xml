		<content> The people of the area are kept       
 informed of local news and            
 events through the{Cumbernauld News. }
 The paper was first produced in{1961 }
 and now sells 12,500 copies per week. 
 The news and information is gathered  
 by a group of 8 people - an editor, 4 
 reporters, 2 photographers, and a     
 receptionist.  Information also comes 
 from local people who visit the office
 or telephone.  There are also events  
 which they know about in advance, e.g,
 a planned council meeting, gala day   
 etc.

{them informed of local issues}        
 particularly if it involves them      
 personally or their photograph is     
 included.  The number of papers sold  
 increases if a{serious crime or       
{accident }has ocurred in the area as  
 it is given more detailed coverage.   </content>
