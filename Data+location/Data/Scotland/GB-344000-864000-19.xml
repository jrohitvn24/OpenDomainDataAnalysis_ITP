 THERE WILL BE NO SCHOOL BECAUSE ONE   
 WILL GET ONE'S LESSON ON THE COMPUTER.
      YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO SAY "OH   
 NO,IT IS RAINING."  EVERY HOUSE WILL  
 BE BUILT ON THE BEACH AND WHEN IT     
 RAINS A BIG GLASS DOME WILL COME DOWN 
 OVER YOUR DREAM HOUSE WITH ITS SAUNA, 
 COMPUTER ROOM, SWIMMING POOL, GROW BY 
 ITSELF GARDEN AND A GAMES ROOM WITH   
 SNOOKER, DARTS AND ARCADE GAMES THAT  
 YOU DON'T PAY FOR.  TO COMMUNICATE,   
 YOU WOULD USE SPEED BUSES THAT ARE    
 REMOTE CONTROLLED AND LITTLE HOVER    
 BIKES AND CARS.  WITH YOUR BEACH, YOU 
 GET A 4KM STRETCH OF WATER AND YOU GET
 A JETTY WITH A SPEEDBOAT, A PLAY      
 CRAFT, A COUPLE OF FUN BOATS AND A    
 MASSIVE CRUISER FOR SIX PEOPLE.       
     {IDEAS BY SANDY McCONNACHIE.
