		<title>06Crofting in Aith</title>
		<content> Crofting is very small-scale farming. 
 There are 24 crofts in the area.      
 These crofts are mainly dependent     
 on sheep as most of the land is rough 
 hill grazing though a lot of it is    
 being fenced in, reseeded and         
 improved. The main breeds of sheep    
 are Shetland, Cheviot and Suffolk     
 crosses. The lambs are born late in   
 the spring and sold in late summer.   
 There is a lot of work to be done with
 lambing, dipping, shearing etc.       
 Only 3 of the crofts keep cattle.     
 The small amount of arable land is    
 used to grow winter feed for animals  
 and produce for home use. The crops   
 grown include hay, potatoes, turnips, 
 corn and cabbage. The use of machinery
 has increased in the last 20 years but
 as acreages are small there is much   
 unmechanised work.
