         Uddingston's largest factory  
is Tunnock's Bakery where mostly women 
and girls work to make its famous car- 
amel wafers as well as cakes and pies. 
Two other large works are Levi's cloth-
ing and Satchwell electrical controls. 
         There are some smaller works  
in the town including depots for cold  
storage vans. Nearby there is a large  
trading estate with big showrooms and  
shops and car-parks. Not so many people
are employed here even though it is so 
large.                                 
         Uddingston's industry is      
almost all away from the centre of the 
town, apart from Tunnock's.
