		<title>19CRAWTON</title>
		<content> There are few records about Crawton.  
 We know that there were twenty three  
 houses in Crawton and also twelve     
 boats went out to sea. The people in  
 Crawton were very poor. The ladies'   
 jobs were baiting the lines. However, 
 the fish became scarce and the people 
 of Crawton took a share in a large    
 Stonehaven boat which went further out
 to sea. The last fisherman packed up  
  and left Crawton in 1927. Now Crawton
 has a Bird Sanctuary called Fowlsheugh
 near it and it is a very beautiful but
 wild place. Today some people are     
 again living in Crawton but there are 
 no boats going out to fish. Today we  
 have read in the newspaper that       
 someone has bought land at Crawton and
 wants to build houses there.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
