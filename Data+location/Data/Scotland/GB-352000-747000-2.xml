		<title>02HISTORY OF LETHAM</title>
		<content>  Letham has a short history being     
 planned in 1788 by George Dempster and
 built on his estate of Dunnichen as   
 part of a programme of Agricultural   
 Reform which aimed to improve his     
 estate and the lot of his tenant      
 farmers and workers. It was to be a   
 source of labour for the estate and   
 healthy young men to "recruit for the 
 army and navy".Each feu was very cheap
 at Â£2 per acre. It was also to be a   
 centre for a cottage linen weaving    
 industry.The original houses have a   
 little window in the gable to light   
 the end of the loom.On the Vinney     
 (stream) two plash mills prepared and 
 spun yarn to supply these looms.The   
 cottage industry failed because of the
 Industrial Revolution and the income  
 of the villagers was much reduced.In  
 1811 the population was 350.
