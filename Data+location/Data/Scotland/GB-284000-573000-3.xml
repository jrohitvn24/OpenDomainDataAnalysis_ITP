		<content>   Our school is used for many things  
 after school such as Guides. The      
 Guides meet on a Tuesday night from

 2 Guiders. Sometimes if it is a nice  
 night they go out into the playground 
 or playing field. The Brownies meet in
 the school as well. There are 14      
 Brownies and 2 Guiders and 1 Ranger   
 helper. They meet on a Monday night
