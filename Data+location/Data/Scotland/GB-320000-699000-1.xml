		<title>01THE UPPER LEVEN BASIN</title>
		<content> THE AREA LIES TO THE WEST OF          
 GLENROTHES.IT IS 95 % RURAL,ONLY A    
 SMALL PRIVATE ESTATE IN LESLIE        
 INTRUDING.THE PRINCIPAL FEATURE IS THE
 RIVER LEVEN VALLEY-NARROW TO THE EAST 
 BUT FLAT AND  WIDE TO THE WEST        
 FLOWING FROM LOCH LEVEN.HERE THE RIVER
 WAS STRAIGHTENED BY BUILDING THE CUT  
 IN 1832.THE SIDES OF THE VALLEY ARE   
 STEEP AND CONTINUE TO  RISE SHARPLY TO
 THE NORTH WHEREAS IN THE SOUTH THE    
 RISE IS MORE GENTLE TO A MAXIMUM OF   
 192 M.                                
  MIXED FARMING PREDOMINATES WITH VERY 
 LITTLE OTHER INDUSTRY APART FROM THE  
 OPENCAST COALFIELD INTRUDING IN THE   
 SOUTH.EVIDENCE OF FORMER INDUSTRY E.G.
 BLEACHFIELD STILL REMAINS.DESPITE     
 HAVING VIRTUALLY NO AMENITIES THE     
 SMALL POPULATION IS FAIRLY STABLE     
 SINCE GLENROTHES WITH ITS WIDE RANGE  
 OF SERVICES IS NEARBY.                </content>
