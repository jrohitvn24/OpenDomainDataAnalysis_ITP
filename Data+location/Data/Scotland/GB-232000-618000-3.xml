{Masonhill, Kincaidston, Alloway,}     
{Doonfoot, and Seafield.               
{ }Castlehill, Belmont and Forehill are
 high density estates, mainly made up  
 of council houses, some of which have 
 been bought by tenants.               
   Kincaidston is a very new, very high
 density council estate. The terraced  
 houses are built in squares within    
 squares.                              
   Masonhill, Alloway, Doonfoot and    
 Seafield consist of privately owned   
 houses. Apart from the original       
 village of Alloway, the houses in     
 Masonhill and Alloway are post-war,   
 while Doonfoot and Seafield have older
 and usually bigger houses.
