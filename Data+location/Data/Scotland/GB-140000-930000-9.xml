		<content>{FISHING:}There are about 35 fishing   
 boats.{Prawns}are mainly caught       
 although there is a{white fish        
 by-catch as well, and they take in    
{sand eels}which are taken to the fish 
 meal factory where they are processed 
 for fish meal and oil.                
{Prawns}are tailed and the tails are   
 processed at Goat Island.{Herring}is  
 also caught but not often.            
 The biggest buyers at the Fish-Mart   
 are; the Stornoway Fishermans' Co-op, 
 who buy most of the fish for          
 themselves, Youngs Seafoods who       
 have a factory, which is down at      
 Goat Island, for{prawns, shellfish    
{and lobsters.}                        
 Most of the catch goes to the Aberdeen
 market.                               
 The vessels in the Stornoway fishing  
 fleet are between 40-70 feet in       
 length.                               </content>
