		<content> Every year we have a Burns'           
 competition which consists of reciting
 Burns' poems,solo singing,accompanying
 and playing a musical instrument.In P7
 there is a literature exam.           
  After the competition we perform a   
 concert for the old folks.Some people 
 recite Scottish poems,some play the   
 piano and some play the recorder.     
  We have inter-house competitions.One 
 of them is the General Knowledge Quiz.
 Others are rounders,football,         
 tug-o-war,flat,novelty and relay      
 races.The three houses which compete  
 in these matches are Brownlee,        
 Mauldslie and Milton.The house        
 captains are picked from P7 and they  
 choose the teams for the quiz and the 
 sports matches.
