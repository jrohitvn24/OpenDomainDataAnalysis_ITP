		<title>03THE PARISH OF ETTRICK.</title>
		<content>   The Parish of Ettrick centres       
 round Ettrick Kirk.Records of a church
 in the Valley go back to the 13th     
 century when by a charter of 1235 the 
 lands of Ettrick from the source      
 beyond Potburn in the West were gifted
 by King Alexander the II of Scotland  
 to the monks of Melrose Abbey.The     
 original chapel was sited further up  
 the river at Over Kirkhope but        
 reference to "the New Kirk of         
 Ettrick"is made in the middle of the  
 15th century and this is believed to  
 have been near the site of the present
 church.This was built in 1824 to      
 replace,according to the records a    
 dilapidated building with turf and    
 heather roof.Built into it are 2      
 original stones,one a probable        
 tombstone inscribed RSS Memento Mori- 
 1619,a record of an erstwhile Scott of
 Thirlstane.                           </content>
