		<title>16WEST END &amp; LOCHARDIL FARMS</title>
		<content>    While exploring{LOCHARDIL}and{HOLM}
 we found, to our surprise, a very old 
 farmhouse called{WEST END FARM.}There 
 were hens and cockerels. We counted   
 about 30, running all over the place  
 so obviously someone lived there.     
    The owner is a man in his seventies
 whose parents had farmed the place    
 originally. As Lochardil became bigger
 more and more land was sold off until 
 now he has only a few fields left. The
 crops which he used to grow were being
 damaged by children playing in the    
 fields so he just keeps chickens and  
 grows a few vegetables. He seemed sad 
 about it.                             
   {LOCHARDIL FARM}was a collection    
 of,empty buildings fenced off from the
 houses and was completely abandoned   
 and locked.                           
    The farms have disappeared and more
 will disappear as houses are built.   </content>
