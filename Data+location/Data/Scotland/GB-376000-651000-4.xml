		<content>    WE DID A TRAFFIC SURVEY OUTSIDE OUR
 SCHOOL WE FOUND OUT HOW MANY CARS,    
 LORRIES ECT. PASSED. WE COUNTED AT    
 DIFFERENT TIMES AND 2.15_2.30 WAS THE 
 BUSIEST.                              
    WE DISCOVERED THAT CARS WERE THE   
 MOST POPULAR,THEN LORRIES.            
    A RAILWAY USED TO GO THROUGH THE   
 DUNS AREA BUT ALL THAT REMAINS IS A   
 MARK WHERE THE TRACK WAS AND THE      
 STATION WHICH IS NOW A PART OF THE    
 INDUSTRIAL ESTATE                     
    THERE ARE FEW BUS SERVICES EXCEPT  
 FOR SCHOOL BUSES,PARTLY BECAUSE MOST  
 FAMILIES HAVE THEIR OWN TRANSPORT     
 AND BUS SERVICES RUN AT A LOSS.       
                                       
    150 OF OUR SCHOOL ROLL OF 207 COME 
 TO SCHOOL BY BUS AND AT THE           
 BERWICKSHIRE HIGH SCHOOL 600 OF THEIR 
 ROLL OF 761 DO.
