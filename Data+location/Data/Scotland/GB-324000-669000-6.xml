		<title>06THE HERMITAGE EDINBURGH</title>
		<content> A hermit once lived in the Hermitage  
 and that is how it got its' name. It  
 was a wild forest but now is a{wooded 
{park.}He probably lived on wild       
 berries, boar and squirrel.           
 In 1772 the Hermitage was sold to Sir 
 Charles Gordon of Cluny. By 1785 he   
 had finished building the{mansion     
{house}we can see today.  He built a   
 doo'cot up on the hills where pigeons 
 were kept for eating. The doo'cot     
 faced south so that the north winds   
 couldn't blow in.                     
 There is also an Ice House which faced
 north where he kept salted meat. The  
 ice was brought from the river in     
 winter and taken along many winding   
 passages so that the sun could not    
 melt it. It was then wrapped in straw.
 People believed that there was a      
 tunnel from the Ice House to the      
 servants' quarters in the house.      </content>
