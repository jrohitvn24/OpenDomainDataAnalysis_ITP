		<title>06FISHING FAMILY,ANNAN</title>
		<content> The family which I belong to is the   
 Willacy's.In Annan the family is well 
 known for it's involvement with       
 fishing.Five generations have been    
 involved.                             
 My dad built a boat, called the IVY   
 WILLACY,when he was 15.It was named   
 after my gran.                        
 The family,at one time,kept boats and 
 fished from Annan harbour.Today the   
 new boat,STAR OF ANNAN,is kept at     
 Kirkcudbright.                        
 My dad used to fish for shrimps but   
 now he fishes for Queenies.These are  
 small shellfish which look a bit like 
 scallops.After catching them they are 
 sold to a factory in Kirkcudbright.   
 They are then unshelled and           
 packed.They are sold to hotels and    
 fish shops.                           
 This fishing connection may end as    
 there is only one son to carry it on. </content>
