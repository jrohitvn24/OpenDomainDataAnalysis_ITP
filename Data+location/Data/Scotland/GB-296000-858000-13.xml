		<title>13SHOPPING IN DYKE</title>
		<content> As there are no shops in the Dyke     
 block local residents have to shop    
 outwith the area.In the Parish of Dyke
 there is a shop at Brodie and a shop  
 at Conicavel.Most of the shopping is  
 done in Forres or in the larger       
 supermarkets in Elgin or Inverness.   
  During a week a butchers van visits  
 twice, a bakers thrice, a grocers once
 and two different fish vans once each.
  The mobile library visits the village
 as does a coal lorry and a laundry van
 which collects by request.The postman 
 comes by van from Forres daily as does
 the milkman who also delivers the     
 daily papers to those who order them. 
  There is a mini bus which does a     
 double return journey on Tuesdays and 
 Fridays and a larger bus does the same
 journey on Tuesdays and Saturdays.Both
 buses go to Forres.                   
                                       </content>
