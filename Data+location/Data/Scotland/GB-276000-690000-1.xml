		<content> Our block can be divided into various 
 sections. St.Ninians and Whins of     
 Milton have grown and are now suburbs 
 of Stirling. Cambusbarron village has 
 retained its identity and is separated
 from the other two by a motorway. The 
 remaining area is farm and woodland.We
 have a large wellrun hospital with    
 good feeder services.Education to the 
 eighteenth year is provided with      
 minimal travel.Headquarters of police 
 and local government are within our   
 block.There are numerous small shops  
 and businesses,two hypermarkets which 
 serve a large area,and a quarry which 
 is controlled outwith our area.Of     
 historical interest we have a tower   
 and church and a Monument commerating 
 the Battle of Bannockburn.
