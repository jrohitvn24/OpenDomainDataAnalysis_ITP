		<content>  Th Community Centre was built in     
 l974 close to the site of an old      
 village hall dating from the early    
 l920's. The centre is owned by        
 Stenness Community Association which  
 is made up of members from the parish 
 elected annually. There are 14 members
 on the committee.The centre is hired  
 by the school and is used for gym,    
 music and drama.During the past year  
 the hall has been used regularly by   
 the Youth Club, Playgroup, SWRI, 'Slim
 and Trim', Drama Club, Community      
 Council and from time to time by other
 organisations. The centre is regularly
 used for weddings.Usually the centre  
 makes a profit but because of the     
 decline in the popularity of country  
 dances, last year it didn't. The      
 secretary, Mrs. Lilias Mathers would  
 like to see a Senior Citizens' Club   
 using the centre regularly.           </content>
