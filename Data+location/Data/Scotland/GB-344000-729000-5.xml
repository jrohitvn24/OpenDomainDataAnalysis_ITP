 a variety of nursery and playgroup    
 facilities. Mothers usually assist in 
 the running of these nurseries on a   
 rota basis.                           
{SCHOOLS }Three Primary Schools,       
 Eastern, Forthill and Barnhill, cater 
 for just over one thousand pupils in  
 the 5 - 12 year old range. Eastern

 refurbished building. Barnhill and    
 Forthill are more modern, purpose-    
 built schools. Forthill is the largest
 Primary School.                       
   Grove Academy caters for children in
 the 12-18 year old range with nearly  
 1000 pupils.The school building is due
 for modernisation.
