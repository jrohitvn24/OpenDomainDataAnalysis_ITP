		<content> The area is going through a transition
 from heavy to light industry.Soil     
 samples are taken for testing to the  
 regional chemical analysts working in 
 laboratories in Daldowie sewerage     
 works.Decisions are taken then about  
 site development. Waste land has gone 
 to industry,to housing and for        
 landscaping.The main problem is rising
 unemployment during the transition.   
 Pupils have problems about career     
 choice.Will a preferred carrer have   
 vacancies when trained?               
     The area provides services to the 
 city.We have substantial green belt.  
 The nothern sector is now very        
 beautiful on the banks of the Clyde.We
 hope that the proposed ring road will 
 not interfere with the rural aspects  
 here. This area of old Lanarkshire    
 and new Glasgow is again "A Dear Green
 Place."                               </content>
