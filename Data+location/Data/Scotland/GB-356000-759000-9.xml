		<title>09BRECHIN'S SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content> Brechin has a typical selection of    
{Market Town}food shops , mostly on    
{High St.,Swan St. and St. David St.   
 Some difficulties arise when unloading
 goods, due to the narrowness of the   
 streets, and some shops have limited  
 storage space. Staff work quite long  
 hours but openings exist in most shops
 for smart, pleasant, young people     
 willing to learn. Most shoppers(86%)  
 who buy their foodstuffs in Brechin   
 prefer the supermarkets (Finfare,     
 Co-op, Galbraith's) where they can    
 browse and buy items at cheaper       
 prices. However, 14% still prefer the 
 friendlier, quieter atmosphere of the 
 traditional grocer shops such as      
 Adam's. When asked their opinion      
 concerning the possible creation of a 
{pedestrian precinct}in the town centre
 over 70% of the sample were in favour,
 saying that it would be safer.        </content>
