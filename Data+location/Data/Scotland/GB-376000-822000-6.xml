		<title>06Farming-Arable-Collyhill</title>
		<content>   The farm of Collyhill lying to the  
 north east of Inverurie is primarily  
 an arable farm.  The farm has belonged
 to the Green family for 107 years.  Mr
 Green specialises in this type of     
 farming because the soil on Collyhill,
 varying from light to clay, is ideal  
 for crop growing and because he feels 
 most profit can be made from this.  On
 his 260 acres Mr Green grows barley,  
 wheat and turnips.  The main crop is  
 barley.  Most of his yield is sold to 
 agricultural suppliers to be used as  
 seed, some goes to the local          
 distillery in Oldmeldrum to be used in
 the making of Glen Garioch whisky and 
 the rest is kept to feed his own      
 animals.                              
   Collyhill also supports a flock of  
 80 half breed ewes and their lambs and
 a herd of 250 fattening cattle.
