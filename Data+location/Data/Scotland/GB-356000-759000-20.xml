		<title>20PENSIONERS IN BRECHIN</title>
		<content> We interviewed pensioners in the town 
 to obtain their views on several      
 topics.Although a few have moved here 
 in retirement, often from the rural   
 areas, most lived in Brechin  when    
 they were employed.They find the town 
 pleasant and quiet but  note that the 
 close-knit community means that people
 know other people's business and this 
 can be irritating at times.They find  
 plenty to do e.g. coach trips to      
 scenic areas or cities,concerts,      
 bingo, coffee mornings and walks in   
 the country and along the river.Some  
 regularly visit relatives in other    
 parts of the country.Most liked the   
 young people they knew and felt that  
 more facilities , such as a leisure   
 centre, in the town would cut down the
 vandalism of the mindless few.Overall 
 the vast majority seemed to enjoy     
 their "Golden Years" in Brechin.      </content>
