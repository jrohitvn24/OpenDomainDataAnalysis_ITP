		<title>03Donview Centre Bennachie</title>
		<content> This centre has been built by the     
 Forestry Commission to encourage the  
 recreational use of Bennachie Forest. 
 There is a car park picnic site and   
 exhibition depicting all the many     
 facets of life in the forest.Growing  
 around the centre are trees of the    
 types seen in the area which have been
 labelled as a guide to their          
 identification.                       
 From the car park a series of walks   
 over the Millstone Hill give          
 spectacular views of the surrounding  
 countryside.A 10km walk will take one 
 across the hills past the Iron age    
 Fort on Mither Tap and down into the  
 Urie valley while the short 1km path  
 provides a brief stroll among the     
 trees.                                
  These facilities prove very popular  
 with both local residents and         
 tourists and are crowded in summer.   </content>
