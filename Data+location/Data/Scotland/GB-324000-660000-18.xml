		<title>18AN ANNUAL EVENT IN PENICUIK</title>
		<content> The soldiers based at Glencorse       
 Barracks are the Royal Scots, the     
 Royal Highland Fusiliers, the King's  
 Own Scottish Borderers, the           
 Cameronians, the Black Watch and the  
 Queen's Own Highlanders.              
 Once a year on a Sunday in the middle 
 of June, there is an Open Day when the
 public are allowed into the barracks  
 for a look at what goes on.  The army 
 puts on different displays, e.g. mock 
 battles, shooting demonstrations,     
 police dogs and motor cycles.  There  
 are tanks which you can climb on top  
 of and go inside. This year the Golden
 Lions gave a parachuting display.     
 They were formed in 1969 to promote   
 free fall parachuting in the Scottish 
 Army. For fund raising there are side 
 shows, pony rides and a death slide.  
 The money made from the stalls at the 
 Open Day goes to local charities.     </content>
