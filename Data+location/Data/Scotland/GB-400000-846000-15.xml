		<content> Unlike{Longside,Mintlaw}was a planned 
 village which lies north of the River 
{Ugie.Longside,}however has grown      
 naturally throughout the years and has
 developed into a close_knit community.
{Longside}with its narrow streets  and 
 its large variety of houses may appear
 a quiet little village but you'd be   
 surprised at the entertainment,such as
 galas,roups and coffee_mornings that  
 the village can organise whereas      
{Mintlaw}does not have quite as much.  
  {Mintlaw}has three schools including 
 a six year academy but in comparison  
{Longside}has one primary school which 
 is built in two parts.Both villages   
 have a sports ground,although{Mintlaw 
 does not have a golf course it has    
 football grounds,bowling greens and   
 tennis courts the same as{Longside.
