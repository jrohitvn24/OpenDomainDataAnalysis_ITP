		<title>20Preparing for net-fishing</title>
		<content> Fishing on the River Tweed near the   
 village of Norham takes place at      
 Pedwell fishery. The fishing rights   
 are owned by Colonel Del Clermont.    
    The season for net fishing is      
 between February 14th and September   
 14th. Before the start of each season 
 the nets are checked and mended and   
 the boats repaired or replaced where  
 necessary. A tractor and trailer are  
 then employed to transport the boats  
 or cobles from their winter home, down
 to Pedwell landing, which is shallow  
 enough to permit the tractor to       
 enter the water.                      
    Thanks to Norham School, Mr Cameron
 and members of Norham WI for compiling
 this text, and Mrs E.Craig            
 Mrs.I.Grahamslaw and Mr C Moody for   
 taking the slides of local views.
