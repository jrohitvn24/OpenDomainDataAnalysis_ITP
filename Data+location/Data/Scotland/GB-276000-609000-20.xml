		<title>20The Sanquhar Post</title>
		<content> Sanquhar Post Office is the oldest    
 post office in Britain. The earliest  
 known existence of a PO is an entry in
 the Edinburgh Almanack of 1763, which 
 states that the post from Sanquhar    
 left Edinburgh on Saturday evenings at
 9pm and returned the following Friday 
 afternoon. Letters were a sheet of    
 paper folded, sealed with the address 
 written on the outside. The office was
 a room in the postmaster's house with 
 a window onto the street through which
 letters could be handed in or         
 delivered to the caller. By 1788, the 
 mail was being delivered to Sanquhar  
 from Edinburgh 3 times weekly. The    
 earliest reference to Sanquhar in     
 English PO records is dated 1802, when
 a 3 day post between Cumnock and      
 Sanquhar was recommended. Today there 
 is a postmaster, his 2 assistants and 
 4 postmen for the official business.  </content>
