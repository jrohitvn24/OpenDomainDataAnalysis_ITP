		<content>   As well as having smaller shopping  
 centres in each of the neighbourhoods 
 East Kilbride also has a main shopping
 area at the Town Centre with parking  
 available free at the multi-storey in-
 door car-park or any of the four large
 outdoor spaces. The shopping area is  
 completely pedestrianised with well   
 designed shopping malls (featured     
 recently in the BBC serial "The Mad   
 Death") accounting for a large per-   
 centage of the 1 million sq.ft. of    
 shopping space. The shops themselves  
 cater for all tastes ranging from     
 national multiples to the smaller     
 exclusive specialist shops and high   
 fashion boutiques. At the Town Centre 
 area is also to be found the main     
 library, a dual cinema, an entertain- 
 ment complex with roller discos, an   
 Olympic-size swimming pool and a youth
 centre.                               </content>
