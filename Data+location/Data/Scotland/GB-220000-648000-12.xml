		<title>12HOUSING IN SEAMILL</title>
		<content>                                       
 The majority of houses in Seamill are 
 situated in picturesque spots.        
   In{1896}there were only four houses 
 on Portencross Road which are still   
 there today.The scenery around these  
 houses was glorious green fields but  
 now the scenery is mostly houses.     
 However it is still a very picturesque
 community.                            
 The only other building which was in  
 the area in 1896 was the{Paisley      
{Home.}This was built in 1885, extended
 in 1894 and  is now known as the      
{Community Centre.}Another interesting 
 building is known as the{Fort,}as it  
 is built on the site of an Iron Age   
 fort.  At the time of writing it is up
 for sale.  There is also a dried up   
{duck pond}with an old house beside it.
 This is possibly going to be used for 
 private housing development.          </content>
