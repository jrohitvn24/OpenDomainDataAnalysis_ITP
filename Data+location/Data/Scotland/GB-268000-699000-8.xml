		<title>08DEANSTON VILLAGERS</title>
		<content> Deanston villagers lifestyle has been 
 influenced over the years by the Mill 
 and Distillery, the village having    
 been built for Mill workers. A small  
 industrial community was thus formed  
 in the middle of a rural area.        
 Although this industrial populace has 
 merged with the rural one through     
 inter-marriages it has maintained an  
 industrial identity, even after the   
 closure of the Mill and decline of the
 Distillery. Most working people now   
 travel to the larger towns for        
 jobs.The once thriving social life    
 based on the Mill Social Club has     
 now ceased. The nearby hotel has      
 closed, as have the Caravan Park and  
 the Bowling Green. The Primary School 
 is now the 'hub' of the village and is
 used for the children's club, church  
 services and any other meetings in our
 one shop cum Post Office community.   </content>
