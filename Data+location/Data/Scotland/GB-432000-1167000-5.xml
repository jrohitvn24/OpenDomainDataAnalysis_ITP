		<content> Police in Brae                        
 The Brae Police Office is a modern    
 building in the centre of Brae.It is  
 manned by 1 sergeant and 6 constables.
 They all belong to the Northern       
 Constabulary.Their headquarters are in
 Inverness.                            
 We see the Police at night driving    
 around Brae in one of their two Ford  
 Escorts.They come to school in the    
 summer time to teach us cycling       
 proficiency.They also come to school  
 at other times of the year to warn us 
 of dangerous things such as fireworks,
 road safety and going with strangers. 
 We have no courts,no sheriff or       
 lawyers in our area.
