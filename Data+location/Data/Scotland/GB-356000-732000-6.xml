		<content>   This year the station at Carnoustie 
 was closed.It is now an un-manned     
 stopping point for trains.It is used  
 regularly by commuters who are        
 travelling to work in Dundee and      
 Arbroath.In the summer,more people    
 use the train for pleasure.           
   Buses are another way of travelling 
 out of Carnoustie.They are more help- 
 ful for people who live or work in the
 small villages such as Monikie which  
 lie to the north of Carnoustie.The    
 services are quite regular but the    
 journeys sometimes take quite a while 
 because of the stops for passengers.  
   For shorter journeys taxis can be   
 used.There are three different taxi   
 services in Carnoustie.About 60% of   
 the people in Carnoustie use them.    
 (However more people use buses.) The  
 busiest time for taxi-drivers is      
 during Christmas and New Year.        </content>
