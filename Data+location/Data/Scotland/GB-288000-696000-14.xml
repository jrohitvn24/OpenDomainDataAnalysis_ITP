		<title>14GOLF COURSES AROUND ALVA</title>
		<content> The nine hole course in Alva is a     
 major attraction. It is situated on   
 the slopes of the Ochil Hills. It has 
 quite a large membership including    
 wandering sheep! There is a small club
 house. Children are allowed to use the
 course. The disadvantage is the hilly 
 site but it is close by the town and  
 handy for people to get to. The       
 Tillicoultry course also has{nine     
{holes}and a club house. Unlike Alva's 
 golf course it doesn't have any hilly 
 bits. There are a lot more lady       
 golfers in the{club}because the course
 is easier to play on. Golf addicts can
 get more{recreation}by playing on the 
 courses at Schawpark  and Dunblane.
