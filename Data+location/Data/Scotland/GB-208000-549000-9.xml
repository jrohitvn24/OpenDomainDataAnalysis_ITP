		<title>09HOUSING IN SANDHEAD</title>
		<content>   by John McLean aged 12              
 In Sandhead there are three different 
 kinds of houses. Their are the        
 original old stone- built houses, some
 younger houses built in the fifties,  
 and in the last three years there have
 been a lot of new houses built in     
 Sandhead. These are the first houses  
 to be built in the village since the  
 end of the last war. There is a       
 Creamery house and next to it there is
 the old Creamery. There have been new 
 bungalows built in the area of the    
 Creamery.  A lot of old people live in
 the houses in Sandhead Village. There 
 is a Church in Sandhead and the Manse 
 was built in 1975. Next to the old    
 school, which is now a house, new     
 bungalows have been built. Most houses
 have been built  by the Council and   
 some people have bought them so they  
 don't have to pay rent.               </content>
