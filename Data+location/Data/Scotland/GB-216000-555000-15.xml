		<content> The majority of the buildings in the  
{Main Street}are{old in design}with    
{thick limestone walls.}Many of them   
 date from the 17th and 18th centuries.
 One hotel was used as an old{coaching 
{inn,}and a certain house is dated     
{1790.}Some of the public buildings    
 still in use were built in the        
 nineteenth century.Two Council schemes
 were built before the{2nd World War.  
 The last Council schemes were built   
 especially with O.A.P.'s in mind.     
 There is no privately owned housing   
 estate. The majority of people live in
 old privately owned property or non-  
 council rented houses. One Council    
 scheme won the{Civic Trust Award}in   
{1962}for its design. Several Council  
 tenants have purchased their own      
 council houses to become property     
 owners. The privately owned houses are
 all well decorated on the outside.    </content>
