		<title>14LAW AND ORDER IN OAKLEY AREA</title>
		<content> In the  Oakley area the police station
 is made up of{1 police sergeant and 6 
{police constables.}Two constables live
 in the area itself.Community policing 
 ie.checking on the single pensioners  
 in winter.The main problems are caused
 by teenagers,mainly{petty vandalism   
{and breach of the peace}although van- 
 dalism is 33% down on the national    
 average.The police try to spend time  
 each year in{schools}talking to 12    
 year olds.They also take 2 schools in 
 our area for orienteering.The police  
 feel that this helps the relationship 
 between the children and themselves.On
 average{there are 2-3 house break-ins 
{a week,}and in the past year(June-May)
 there have been 130.Most acts of van- 
 dalism were done during the recent    
 miners' dispute but no ill-feeling    
 rests between the police and miners.  
 Villagers and police relate very well.</content>
