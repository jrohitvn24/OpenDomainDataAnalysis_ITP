 We interviewed Mr.M.Cooper,a member of
 the community magazine{"Comment".     
 "Comment" relies on contributions     
 locally and the views on matters from 
 previous issues.Its purpose is to     
 provide a platform for anyone to give 
 their opinion. It is printed locally  
 by A.Doggart every two months.        
 Since it began in 1980 there have been
 some 30 issues.                       
 On average the magazine is read by two
 people per issue.1000 to 1200 copies  
 are sold in the newsagents.           
 "Comments" main distribution points   
 are{Aberfeldy,Pitlochry}and{Dunkeld.  
 In the summer, they are also sold at  
 caravan sites in the area.
