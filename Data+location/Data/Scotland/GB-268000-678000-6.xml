		<title>06   THE JOBS PEOPLE DO</title>
		<content> Our area contains about 30% of the    
 housing in {KILSYTH,}and most people  
 who live in these houses need some    
 sort of{employment}.The area that we  
 have been given is mostly covered by  
{rough grazing land}so some people     
  work on the farms, but this involves 
 only a few people.                    
  The greatest source of employment in 
 our area are the two schools,{KILSYTH 
 ACADEMY and{BALMALLOCH PRIMARY.}      
 Between these two schools, over {100  
 people are employed.30/40% of these   
 people  have to travel to work from   
 out-side the area.                    
   Many people may have to travel out  
 side the area to get to their work.   
 Younger people may have part time jobs
 eg{delivering milk,delivering         
{papers.etc}.This can also be called a 
 source for EMPLOYMENT.
