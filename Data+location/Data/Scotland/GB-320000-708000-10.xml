		<title>10Health Care in Strathmiglo</title>
		<content> Strathmiglo has a Doctor's surgery.It 
 is open on Tuesdays and Thursdays     
 between the hours of 10_11am and      
 4.30_6pm.At other times if anyone     
 needs to see a doctor,it is neccesary 
 to go to the main surgery in          
 Auchtermuchty which is about 2.5 kms  
 away.For people who do not have a     
 car,getting to Auchtermuchty can be a 
 bit of a problem.The bus service is   
 infrequent and they often have to rely
 on a neighbour's help to get there.   
 There isn't a dentist here.The nearest
 dentist is in Auchtermuchty,though    
 many people go to Dundee,Kinross,Cupar
 and Glenrothes.The school dentist     
 comes once a year with his mobile     
 surgery and attends to the teeth ofthe
 children. The nearest hospitals are in
 Kirkcaldy,Bridge of Earn and Perth.It 
 is difficult for people who do not    
 have a car to get to these hospitals. </content>
