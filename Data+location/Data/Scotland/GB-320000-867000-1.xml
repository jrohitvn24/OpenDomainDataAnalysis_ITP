		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY LOSSIEMOUTH</title>
		<content>   This area of land is in the         
 North-East of Scotland, just south of 
 the Moray Firth. It is very flat, only
 rising to fifteen metres. The land is 
 badly drained, when it rains heavily  
 you often see water lying in the      
 fields.                               
   The only major road leads from      
 Lossiemouth to Elgin. The others are  
 minor. The airfield covers one-quarter
 of the land, and two-thirds of the    
 area is farmland.                     
   There are two cemeteries, only one  
 is being used, the other is old. Until
 twenty years ago there was a railway, 
 but it is closed now.                 
   Most housing can be found on the two
 council estates with only a minority  
 of private housing. There used to be a
 quarry which is now a park. There are 
 two caravan sites.
