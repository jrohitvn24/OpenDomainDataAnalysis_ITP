		<title>02FARMING IN THE OAKLEY AREA</title>
		<content> In the Oakley area there are 8 farms  
 with an average of 250 acres.Most of  
 them were{dairy farms}but the farmers 
 have found this unprofitable and have 
 changed to{arable farming and raising 
{beef cattle.}None of the farms keep   
 sheep or pigs.One of the farms rents  
 out winter grazing for sheep but none 
 raise sheep as dogs are a problem.    
{Main crops are barley and wheat.}Wheat
 is sold to D.B.Marshalls Chunky       
 Chicks,barley is sold to distilleries.
{Grain driers}are used in all farms as 
 the distillers are particular about   
 the percentage of moisture in the     
 grain.Although the{combine harvester} 
 is the most expensive piece of        
 machinery farmers prefer to buy their 
 own.Some hire out to other farms.     
 Farming is now so efficient that few  
 employ much outside labour.They are   
 mostly family run.                    </content>
