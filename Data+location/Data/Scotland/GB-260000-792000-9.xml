		<title>09How Laggan has kept in touch</title>
		<content> Until 1980 Laggan had very poor       
 T.V.reception. It was brought to our  
 attention by our local Doctor that by 
 1981 401 line T.V. would be phased out
 and we would be without T.V. Our only 
 solution (as advised by the B.B.C) was
 to have and maintain our own system.  
 With help from the H.I.D.B who granted
 us aid,we set about the first of      
 several self help schemes. The        
 physical, geographical and electronic 
 problems were solved and worked at by 
 the people of Laggan under the        
 guidance of their Doctor. The mast was
 erected on Dun da Lamb Pictish fort.  
 All homes in Laggan can now receive   
 colour T.V on 4 channels. Radio       
 reception depends on equipment and    
 geographical, but most people get all 
 stations. Daily news papers are       
 available by post at extra cost.      
 Laggan is now fully"in touch".        </content>
