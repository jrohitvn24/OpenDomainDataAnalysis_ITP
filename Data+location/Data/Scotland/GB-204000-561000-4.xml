		<title>04NAME THAT PIER</title>
		<content>      The Sir John Ross Pier was built 
 beside the East Pier in 1979 to       
 service the ever increasing ferry     
 trade. A schools competition was held 
 to name the new pier. A class from our
 school, Sheuchan Primary, named the   
 pier and received a trip on The       
 Galloway Princess as a prize.         
      Admiral Sir John Ross was an     
 Arctic explorer who, to remind him of 
 his travels in exploration of the     
 North West Passage, named his home the
 North West Castle. Built in 1820 it is
 now a hotel but its links with him    
 have been carefully preserved.
