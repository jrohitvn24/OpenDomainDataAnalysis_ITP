		<title>09THE CHURCH AT NEWLANDS</title>
		<content> ALTHOUGH NEWLANDS CHURCH IS JUST      
 OUTSIDE OUR GRID OF STUDY, IT PLAYS AN
 IMPORTANT PART IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE   
 NOW HAVE A NEW MINISTER. HE DOES 4    
 PARISHES INCLUDING OURS. HE IS ALSO   
 OUR SCHOOL CHAPLAIN. IN OUR CHURCH WE 
 HAVE SUNDAY SCHOOL AND A YOUTH GROUP, 
 WHICH IS JUST LIKE SUNDAY SCHOOL BUT  
 FOR OLDER CHILDREN. IT IS RUN BY A    
 LOCAL MUM AND DAD. WE ALSO HAVE THE   
 WOMEN'S GUILD FOR THE WOMEN OF OUR    
 PARISH. THEY HAVE LOTS OF ACTIVITIES, 
 INCULDING COOKERY, SEWING AND CRAFTS  
 AND FILM SHOWS. IN MAY WE HAVE        
 CHRISTIAN AID WEEK, WHICH WE ALSO     
 SUPPORT. WE HAVE A FETE, SPONSORED    
 WALK AND A DANCE. WE ALL TAKE PART IN 
 THESE THINGS. WE RAISE QUITE A LOT OF 
 MONEY FOR THE APPEAL. AT THE FETE WE  
 HAVE PONY RIDES, SIDE STALLS, TEAS AND
 A BARBECUE.                           
                                       </content>
