		<content> BECAUSE THE LAND IS SO GOOD FOR ARABLE
 FARMING, MOSTLY WINTER GRAIN, SOME OIL
 SEED RAPE, PEAS, POTATOES, TURNIPS AND
 GRASS FOR FATTENING CATTLE ARE GROWN. 
  SOME GRAIN IS GROWN FOR SEED, ONE    
 FARM HAVING A RETAIL SEED BUSINESS.   
 LARGE SILOS OF SILAGE TOWER ABOVE THE 
 FARMS.  CATTLE ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD    
 EITHER PRIVATELY OR AT BERWICK OR     
 RESTON MARKET.   ONE FARM HAS 100     
 DAIRY COWS WHICH PRODUCE 500,000      
 LITRES OF MILK PER YEAR.   THE FARMS  
 USE VERY MODERN EQUIPMENT.   ONE TO   
 THREE MEN AND A STUDENT, WITH THE HELP
 OF TRACTORRS, COMBINES, COMPUTERS TO  
 COUNT MILK YIELDS, CONTROL CATTLE FEED
 AND KEEP FARM YIELDS, ETC. FILED, CAN 
 RUN A FARM WHICH USED TO NEED         
 MANY WORKERS - LAND ARMY AND PRISONERS
 OF WAR - IN THE FIELDS.
