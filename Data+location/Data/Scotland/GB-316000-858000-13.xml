		<title>13THE VILLAGE POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> Miltonduff Post Office sells more than
 just stamps.It stocks a variety of    
 household goods and is a meeting place
 for the community.                    
 The busiest days are Mondays and      
 Tuesdays.Christmas is its busiest time
 of the year.                          
 Most people said that the Post Office 
 gave a good service and the fact that 
 you didn't have to queue up was much  
 appreciated.                          
 "The service is good and it serves the
 community,"was typical of peoples'    
 views.                                
 The Post Office was considered to be a
 friendly centre for information.It was
 very well run and a great benefit to a
 rural area lacking in good transport  
 facilities to the nearest city of     
 Elgin which is 4km away.
