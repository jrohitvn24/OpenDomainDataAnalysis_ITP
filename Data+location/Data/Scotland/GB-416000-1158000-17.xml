		<title>17Naomi's day on Papa Stour.</title>
		<content> I got up rather late this morning _   
 quarter to nine!I ate my "Start"      
 cereal and rushed to school arriving  
 at 9.12am.We did maths until play_    
 time. We played outside and came in   
 and did English.                      
   Lunch_time is at 12.30pm. and we    
 had mince and potatoes and jam tart   
 and custard for pudding.After lunch   
 we played fighting each_other.        
   In the afternoon we had art and we  
 made clothes for our"Borrower"people. 
 At half past three we left school and 
 when I got home I played with my      
 orphan lambs ({caddies})and my cat    
{Sylvester }(he hates the caddies!).I  
 had supper at 8.30,an omlette and     
 start cereal.After that I played my   
 fiddle for a while,then I went to bed.
   I read{Oor Wullie }in bed .When I   
 was younger I asked if I could have a 
 bucket to sit on like{Oor Wullie}!    </content>
