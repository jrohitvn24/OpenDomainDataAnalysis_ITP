		<content> Due to the scattered nature of the    
 housing in the district,only those    
 people who pay a fee to the Post      
 Office get newspapers delivered.      
 Bonchester P.O. and the Grocer's van  
 also sell them.Many people have       
 devised a rota system to deliver      
 Sunday Newspapers.Most children       
 get at least one comic or magazine.   
 Most homes have at least one T.V.set, 
 and very few have poor reception due  
 to the hills,as new aerials now boost 
 the strength of all four channels.    
 A{MOBILE LIBRARY}visits the area every
 fortnight,and although stock is       
 limited ,there is an efficient Request
 service.Schoolchildren may borrow     
 Regional Library Books through {      
{HOBKIRK SCHOOL. }As{RADIO}reception is
 good,many tractors even have them     
 fitted.Radio Tweed and Border T.V. are
 the most local broadcasting stations. </content>
