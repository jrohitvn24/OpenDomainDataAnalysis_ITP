		<content> Recreation in our D_block follows a   
 wide{variety of activities.}They vary 
 from{football to gardening to golf to 
{fishing and snooker.}We asked the     
 people in Bellfield, Shortlees and    
 Riccarton what recreations they took  
 part in during their spare time. We   
 found that the most popular was       
 gardening-16%, playing snooker-15%,   
 then swimming-11%. 9% played pool,    
 while jogging running tennis and golf 
 had 7% each. Fishing with 6% was 2nd  
 last and last of all was karate with  
 only 3%. There are some clubs in our  
 D_block, mainly fishing clubs, youth  
 clubs, netball clubs, football clubs, 
 and Riccarton and Bellfield bowling   
 clubs.{In our schools we have hobbies 
{clubs}including hockey, model making, 
 and bird watching.
