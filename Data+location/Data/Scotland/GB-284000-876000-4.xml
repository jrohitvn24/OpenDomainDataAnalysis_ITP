       DEER FARMING                    
   In our area there is a deer farm.   
 When we went to visit the farm we     
 found out the following information.  
      Mr MacDonald the farmer wanted   
  to start deer farming because it was 
 not going to be too expensive as he   
 already had the land for the deer to  
 graze.                                
      He has been red deer farming for 
 one year now and the deer are being   
 bred for the butcher or for selling to
 other farmers,who also feel that deer 
 farming would be profitable.          
    In May 1985 the deer are six months
  old and they are getting antlers.    
     There are 80 deer on the farm and 
 by next year Mr MacDonald hopes to    
 have about 150.The deer are fed on    
 nuts and hay in the winter and grass  
 in the summer.                        </content>
