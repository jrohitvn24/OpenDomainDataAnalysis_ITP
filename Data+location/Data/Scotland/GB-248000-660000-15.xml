		<content> The Hurlet Road is a busy winding road
 joining Paisley to the outskirts of   
 Glasgow at Nitshill. There have been a
 number of accidents on this road.     
 These are due to the sharp bends, the 
 narrowness of the road and the fact   
 that there is no pavement beside the  
 road.The speed limit is 60m.p.h.      
 Strathclyde Regional Council has      
 decided to straighten the road and    
 make it into a Dual Carriageway. The  
 project will take 4 to 5 months.      
 One of the main problems for the road 
 builders has been drainage as parts   
 used to flood easily.Many drains have 
 been built to take away rain water and
 a "French Drain" has been built to    
 drain spring water from the road. It  
 is made up of a layer of thick gravel 
 at the bottom on which a plastic      
 drainage tube is placed, covered by a 
 layer of lighter gravel.              </content>
