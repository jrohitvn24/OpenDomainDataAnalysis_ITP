		<title>10Landscape north: FINTRY</title>
		<content> This is an area of dramatic changes in
 scenery. The many{lava flows}which    
 make up the high ground contrast      
 markedly with the low lying{glacial   
{deposits}on top of the softer {       
{sedimentary rocks.}Stronend (629.895) 
 is a noted glacial site featuring     
 successive layers of rocks. East of   
 Culcreuch House is a{volcanic plug.   
{                                      
 The ice which moved from Loch Lomond  
 through the Endrick valley has left { 
{striations}on the higher ground where 
 the rock is exposed. On lower ground  
 the {boulder clay}has been formed into
{drumlins.                             
{                                      
 Large deposits of lake bed material   
 have been found in this area proving  
 that{the Endrick valley was formed by 
{ice}and the resulting lake stretched  
 as far upstream as Fintry.            </content>
