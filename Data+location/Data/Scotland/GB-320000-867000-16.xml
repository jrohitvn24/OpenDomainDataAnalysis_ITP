		<title>16A WEEKEND IN LOSSIEMOUTH</title>
		<content> I woke up on Saturday. Oh no! It's    
 going to be another boring Saturday   
 again. We'll be staying at home nearly
 all day. At least I'll be going       
 swimming with my cousin. My sister    
 will be screaming all day long and    
 shouting at her friends. There is     
 nothing good on the television after  
 11 a.m. It will probably rain again.  
 Next door will be shouting. My mum    
 will nag at me and make me do the     
 housework. I might as well go back to 
 bed!                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
