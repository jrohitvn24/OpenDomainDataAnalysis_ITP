		<title>08Why we stay in Colmonell</title>
		<content> We moved to Colmonell some eleven     
 years ago because it was more central 
 for my husband's agricultural work and
 also because my husband had spent his 
 childhood in arural area and did not  
 really settle in Girvan.              
 I like living in Colmonell now        
 although at first I found it very     
 difficult because it was a very close 
 knit community.                       
 I find like all rural areas that we   
 are deprived of some essential        
 services eg.doctors,dentist.          
 The public transport to this area is  
 poor and I feel for me it is essential
 to have some means of transport of my 
 own.                                  
 I feel that rural life is sheltered   
 and the children especially do not    
 have acces to the same social         
 activities which town children have.
