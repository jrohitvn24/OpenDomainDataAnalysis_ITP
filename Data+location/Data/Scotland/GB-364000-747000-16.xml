		<title>16THE CHANCE INN</title>
		<content> The hotel in Inverkeilor main street  
 is called "The Chance Inn". This was  
 once a coaching inn and you can still 
 see the low archway where the horses  
 and carriages would have gone through.
 Strangely enough, this is not the     
 first "Chance Inn". The first hostelry
 of that name was located approximately
 1 kilometre to the south on what is   
 now a country side road. This had     
 originally been the main road between 
 Dundee and Aberdeen, but when a new   
 road was constructed, (on the         
 same line as the main road today) then
 the inn was also moved, so as not to  
 lose its trade. Soon the main road    
 will be shifted again when the new    
 by-pass is built. Will there then be a
 third "Chance Inn"?                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
