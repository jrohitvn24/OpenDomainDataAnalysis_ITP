		<title>11CARAVAN SITE</title>
		<content> Aberfeldy Caravan site is run by the  
 County Council although it was        
 formerly privately owned.             
                                       
 The tourists interviewed liked        
 Aberfeldy for its fishing,fresh air   
 and friendly people.                  
 Many campers returned annually.       
 They liked the easy access to the     
 shops which offered good quality and  
 prices.                               
                                       
 Washroom and laundry facilities were  
 offered but opinion suggested that    
 more could be done.                   
                                       
 Many campers brought pets,mostly dogs.
