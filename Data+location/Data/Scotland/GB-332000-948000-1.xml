		<title>01Summary,Wick</title>
		<content> Our area covers only a very small part
 of the town of Wick,which has a       
 population of 7000.The landward area  
 has a considerable amount of grazing  
 land with the ruins of many old       
 crofts.Many are being replaced with   
 modern bungalows.Part of the area is  
 peat covered and this provides fuel   
 for local people.                     
 Newton Burn makes its way to Wick     
 River and alongside runs the old track
 of the Lybster to Wick railway.We have
 many old war ruins in our area.From   
 the top of Newton Hill we have one of 
 the best views including the gas      
 station,the creamery,the hydro        
 electric station,the primary          
 school,the secondary school and the   
 radio station.
