		<title>03The Adult Training Centre</title>
		<content> Mr Ray Lightfoot is in charge of the  
 Adult Training Centre at Crossmichael.
 He has been there 10 years. He loves  
 his work and would not do anything    
 else.                                 
 There are 34 handicapped people there.
 They make such things as baskets,     
 stools, trays, picture frames, tables,
 chairs. Mr Lightfoot shows them how to
 make things and use the machines.     
 The handicapped people start coming to
 the centre, five days a week, when    
 they leave school, aged 16 or 17. They
 continue there until they go into an  
 old folks' home.
