		<title>20PLANTS IN BURRA</title>
		<content>      THE VEGETATION IN BURRA IS MOSTLY
 MOORLAND AND GRASSLAND. THERE ARE VERY
 FEW TREES AND THEY DON'T GROW VERY    
 HIGH BECAUSE OF THE HIGH WINDS AND    
 LACK OF SHELTER. THEY ALSO HAVE TO    
 BE PROTECTED FROM THE SHEEP.          
      MOST OF THE PLANTS IN BURRA GROW 
 NEAR THE GROUND, LIKE DAISIES, BIRD'S 
 FOOT TREFOIL,WILD THYME AND LADIES    
 SMOCK.                                
      ON MARSHY GROUND ARE FOUND IRIS, 
 SUNDEW, KING CUP AND MARSH VIOLET. THE
 SUNDEW TRAPS INSECTS BY OPENING STICKY
 SPIKES.                               
      THE MOST COMMON PLANT ON THE     
 ROCKY SHORES ARE THRIFT OR SEA PINK.  
 THEY SURVIVE IN PLACES WHERE NOTHING  
 ELSE CAN LIVE.                        
      MANY OF THE PLANTS THAT GROW BEST
 IN SHETLAND ARE ALPINE PLANTS THAT    
 LIKE THE CLIMATE.
