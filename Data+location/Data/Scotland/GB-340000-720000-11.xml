 A group of us went to see Mr. Wilson, 
 the blacksmith, shoeing a horse.   A  
 horse needs new shoes about every six 
 weeks.   The shoes are all made in    
 advance or mass produced and brought  
 in.   The most suitable shoe is chosen
 from a large range of sizes.   The    
 hoof is prepared by removing the old  
 shoe and filing the hoof down.   Mr.  
 Wilson then heats the new shoe in a   
 huge coal fire until it is red hot.   
 It is then hammered into shape until  
 it is just right for the hoof.   The  
 shoe is fitted on with 7 long nails   
 which go right through the horse's    
 hoof but don't hurt as there are no   
 nerves there.   Mr. Wilson then checks
 the shoe and tidies it up by using a  
 claw hammer to break of the point of  
 the nail, and filing it down.
