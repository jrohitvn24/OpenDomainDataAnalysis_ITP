		<content>    This is a lovely,peaceful place to 
 live. There is farmland,forest,lochs, 
 a rocky coast and a bird reserve on   
 Rough Island.                         
    Most of the farms are dairy farms, 
 but there are a few beef cattle and   
 some sheep on the rough-grazing land. 
 The farmers grow grass for silage to  
 feed the cows.                        
    It is very hilly and there are lots
 of trees,wild flowers and birds. In   
 Rockcliffe it is so mild that palm    
 trees can be grown.                   
    Many people who live here are      
 retired.In the summer holiday-makers  
 come to fish in the lochs,walk on the 
 cliffs,play on the beaches and enjoy  
 the beautiful scenery.                
    There is one shop,one church,one   
 tiny school and one large hotel. It is
 very quiet,but we like it here.
