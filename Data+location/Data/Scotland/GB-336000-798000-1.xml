		<content> This area consists entirely of        
 hillground on the north side of the   
 glacially eroded Dee Valley. It is    
 dissected by the deep, almost gorge   
 like valley of the Tullich Burna and  
 to the east by the valley of the      
 smaller Coldstane Burn. Crannach Hill 
 forms a barren steep sided ridge      
 between these valleys. Its southern   
 end is glacially                      
 truncated and scarred by a prominant  
 sub glacial meltwater channel. The    
 Coldstane Valley is a hanging valley. 
 No one inhabits the area. Soil        
 development is poor and peaty Crannach
 Hill has suffered from heather burning
 reducing much of it to bare rock and  
 scree. Areas that have escaped burning
 show an unusually successful natural  
 regeneration of pine trees. Birch     
 woods are  well established in the    
 lower, sheltered parts of the area.   </content>
