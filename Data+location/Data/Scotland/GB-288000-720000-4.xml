		<title>04INCHBRAKIE CASTLE 1</title>
		<content>     The only positive remains of      
{Inchbrakie Castle}is the moat which   
 encircles a mound covered in fir      
 trees and rhododendrons, also a few   
 large boulders which we think, due to 
 their regular shape, could have been  
 part of the castle walls.             
     Perhaps Inchbrakie no longer      
 stands because of its connection with 
{Kate MacNiven,}(the last{witch}to be  
 burned in Crieff, at the Knock.)      
     The story goes that the laird of  
 Inchbrakie lost his knife and fork    
 whilst being distracted by a bee.  He 
 put down his cutlery to ward off the  
 bee and when he turned his attention  
 back to his dinner they were gone.    
 After a great search they could not be
 found.  When he got home Kate MacNiven
 had found them.  This led to the      
 belief that she had changed into a bee
 and had stolen the knife and fork.    </content>
