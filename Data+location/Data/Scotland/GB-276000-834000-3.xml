		<content>  We took a trip from school to Moy to 
 have a look round. The rhodedendrons  
 were in bud. We noted the date on Jock
 O Moys house 1906 and walked on to    
 Garden Cottage. A friend was out      
 walking her dogs. We stopped to look  
 at Gaelic writing on a stone and      
 walked up the Farm Road to the Farm   
 House. On our way round the village we
 saw a joiner/metal worker who comes   
 from Inverness to work in the         
 steading. We rang the old fire bell.  
 The cat emblem on a classmate's house 
 matched that on the farm steading.
