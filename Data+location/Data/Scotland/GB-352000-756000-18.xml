		<content> I have not missed school except for   
 two days. The school has 20 children  
 and we have two Computers. We like to 
 work on the computer and I like the   
 Logic discs best. We have two teachers
 and we do Language and Maths. We play 
 Rounders and I don't always win.      
                                       
                                       
{Crime Rate.}                          
 Surprisingly there is a fairly high   
 Crime Rate, but not the really serious
 type of crime prevalent in the larger 
 cities. There has been vandalism and  
 poaching in the Forest, also some     
 theft. The articles stolen are        
 Budgies,drills, an angle_grinder, a   
 typewriter and diesel fuel.
