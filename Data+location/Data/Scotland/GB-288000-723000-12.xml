 an area of approximately six and a

 The hotel is situated in very scenic  
 surroundings and is only open during  
 peak holiday periods.  Seven pounds   
 fifty pence is charged per person for 
 one night bed and breakfast.  Each    
 room has a wash-hand basin and a      
 parking area is supplied.  Other      
 services in the hotel include a       
 putting green, a dance floor, a piano 
 and outside tables for guests.        
   The majority of the guests return   
 annually for a holiday and come from  
 Yorkshire, Australia and the U.S.A.   
 During peak periods the hotel could   
 have as many as forty customers in    
 residence.
