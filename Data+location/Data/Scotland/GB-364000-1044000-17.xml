		<title>17FISHING</title>
		<content> There are three boats that fish in    
 Burness:{THE VALHALLA,THE DILL}and{THE
{MARY ELLEN. THE VALHALLA}is a big boat
 and is therefore able to go out to    
 deeper waters.{THE DILL}is a small    
 boat which fishes in shallow waters   
 where the Lobsters are between April  
 and August. After that they shed their
 shells and move into deeper water.{THE
{MARY ELLEN}is a medium sized boat     
 which fishes both in_shore and        
 off_shore.All of the boats fish for   
 Lobster and Crab.{THE MARY ELLEN}and  
{THE DILL}fish in Roos Wick because    
 it's very tangly (plenty of seaweed - 
 good Lobster ground) and is sheltered 
 by the Holms of Ire.{THE VALHALLA     
 fishes around Burness during the      
 summer months but by the end of the   
 year has covered most of the Lobster  
 ground around the island.
