		<content> The Speir family were once a very     
 wealthy family in{Linwood.}They lived 
 in{Burnbrae House }and owned much farm
 land around{Linwood.}5 members of the 
 Speir family are buried in the family 
 vault under the Old Parish Church     
 Hall.It is said that if the vault is  
 disturbed,then Mary Ann Speirs will   
 haunt the villagers of{Linwood.}      
 Permission has been given to knock    
 down the Old Parish Church Hall and   
 build a new Manse but,there are no    
 plans to do this so far.Another legend
 of{Linwood}tells of a poltergeist     
 which is said to be in the White House
 in{Linwood.}One woman who went to buy 
 this house was told by servants of    
 queer happenings during the           
 night.These stories scared the woman  
 and she decided not to buy the        
 house.It is now owned by Civil        
 Defence.                              </content>
