		<title>04BO'NESS SHIPBREAKER'S YARD</title>
		<content> The only shipbreakers yard in Bo'ness 
 is owned by Stephen Dalton and is in  
 the district of Grangepans. It is     
 closing down in 1985 after operating  
 for over 80 years. It has, during this
 time, had lots of types of ships to   
 break up but we know that the last    
 ship to be broken up was a ship that  
 laid pipes for oil. There is new      
 management taking over the building   
 though. These new owners are called   
 Thomson and Balfour. When the cranes  
 are removed and the ground cleared it 
 will be used as a wood yard.
