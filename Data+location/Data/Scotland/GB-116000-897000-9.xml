		<content>{FERRY }In Tarbert there is a vehicular
 ferry  which sails to Uig, in Skye,and
 Lochmaddy in North Uist.This is to be 
 replaced by a rollon-rolloff ferry in 
 1986 which requires major alteration  
 to terminals.                         
{BUS}There are about 6 buses in Tarbert
 at present.They run between Harris and
 Stornoway each day with a double      
 journey on Friday.They are used to    
 bring pupils to school each day but on
 Monday and Friday they also take      
 senior pupils to and from Stornoway.  
{TAXI}There are about 6 taxis in and   
 around the village.Some of them are in
 use to take pupils to school as well  
 as taking school meals to small       
 primary schools.                      
{AIR}This is only possible through     
 Stornoway Airport.                    
 All the roads are tarred;most of them 
 are in good condition.                </content>
