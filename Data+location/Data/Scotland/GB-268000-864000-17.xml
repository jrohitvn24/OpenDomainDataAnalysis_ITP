		<title>17HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> Our group consists of five people who 
 live in a small, cosy village called  
 Jemimaville in the Scottish Highlands 
 where the sea is about 15metres from  
 the bottom of most peoples gardens.   
 We get up between 7.30 and 8.30 in the
 morning to have our breakfasts and    
 catch the bus at 8.50. We arrive at   
 school at 9.00 and wait until the bell
 rings at 9.15 when we start our work. 
 We always do some reading, writing,   
 spelling and maths before the bell    
 rings at 10.45 for interval. Then the 
 boys sometimes play football until the
 bell rings at 11.15. We usually do    
 some English until 12.30 when we have 
 lunch, which on most days consists of 
 vegetables, meat and potatoes with    
 pudding or milk to follow. Lunch is   
 cooked in the nearby school of        
 Cromarty about six miles away
