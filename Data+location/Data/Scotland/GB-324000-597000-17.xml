		<title>17LIVING WITH TREES</title>
		<content> 1985  The valley folk have lost their 
 forebodings.They have "learned to look
 with kindlier eye upon the forest     
 legions which cushionthe rounded      
 contours of the rolling hills".No     
 longer do they see the forests as     
 invading hosts which march            
 relentlessly , ousting the soft-eyed  
 sheep , the gentle lamb.Rather they   
 are "beneficial cover to a thousand   
 living things, the deer ,the world of 
 wildlife".                            
  The trees have been accepted.        
 Meantime, the foresters load their    
 timber lorries ;wildlife officers cull
 the deer .Shepherds dig flocks from   
 snowdrifts, meteorologists observe the
 weather changes, seismologists keep   
 their "ear to the ground"for          
 earthquakes and explosions. Down in   
 the valley life goes on and prayer    
 flags flutter at the Tibetan Centre.  </content>
