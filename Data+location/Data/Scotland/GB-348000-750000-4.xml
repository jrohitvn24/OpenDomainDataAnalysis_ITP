		<title>04PITSCANDLY FARM</title>
		<content>{Farming}is the main industry in this  
 area.  Three brothers own Pitscandly  
 Farm.  The farm was built in the 19th 
 century  but it has only been in their
 family since 1923.  The farmers keep  
 cattle, sheep and grow crops.  There  
 are 406 acres on the farm divided     
 roughly into 12-14 acre fields which  
 are on 6 year{rotation. }They grow    
 barley, oats, turnips and processed   
 peas for animals.  It depends on the  
 weather, but they usually sow the     
 barley in the 3rd week of March and   
 harvest it in mid September.  They    
 sell their{crops}in Kirriemuir.       
 They have 24 Fresian cows crossed with
 Aberdeen Angus.  The farmers have 200 
{sheep}which stay out all year but have
 to come down during winter to avoid   
 snow.  Although the land is hilly,    
 they have never had any problems      
 farming it.                           </content>
