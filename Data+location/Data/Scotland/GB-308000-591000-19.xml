		<content>    Every morning my dad gets up       
 first.At 5.30 he collects the dog,    
 goes to the field and brings in the   
 cows to the parlour for milking.I get 
 up at 7.30 and my mum and sister get  
 up at 8.00. We all make our own       
 breakfast.I usually have tea and      
 toast. My sister goes to Lockerbie    
 Academy and I go to Johnstonebridge   
 School.Dad usually finishes the       
 milking about 7.15, then he has his   
 breakfast.                            
   My mum does the hoovering and makes 
 the beds until 10.00 when she makes a 
 cup of coffee for everyone.Then she   
 has to make the dinner for my dad and 
 his two workers. I have mine at       
 school.                               
   The two workers go home at 5.30 and 
 we have our supper. Then we might     
 watch tv or play bowls in the winter  
 and golf in summer.                   </content>
