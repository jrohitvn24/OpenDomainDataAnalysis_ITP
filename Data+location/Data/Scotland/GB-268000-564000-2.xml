		<title>02 HOUSES IN LAURIESTON</title>
		<content> In the village of Laurieston there    
 are 50 houses.32 of these are over 50 
 years old;some are over 100 years     
 old.Most of the new houses were built 
 between 1960 and 1970.                
 Many of the older houses have been    
 modernized in the past few years.5 of 
 these are holiday houses.All the      
 houses in the village are well kept   
 and have neat and attractive gardens.A
 small burn runs through the village   
 and here there are the remains of an  
 old water wheel and mill.Most of the  
 houses are in this part of the        
 village which is the main street.     
  The overall picture is of a very     
 attractive little community.
