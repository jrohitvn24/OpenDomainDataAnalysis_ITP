{ROAD :}OVER 90% OF OUR TRANSPORT IS   
 BY ROAD. VERY FEW PEOPLE TRAVEL BY    
 BICYCLE. PUBLIC BUS SERVICES ARE VERY 
 GOOD FOR LOCAL AND LONG-DISTANCE      
 TRAVEL. THE CAR IS THE MOST POPULAR   
 MEANS OF TRANSPORT. ROADS ARE         
 INCREASINGLY IN NEED OF REPAIR.       
{RAIL :}THERE ARE NO RAILWAY STATIONS  
 IN OUR AREA. HOWEVER, THERE IS A MAIN 
 LINE STATION APPROXIMATELY 4 KM AWAY  
 ALLOWING INTER-CITY TRAVEL WITHIN AND 
 OUTSIDE SCOTLAND.                   { 
{AIR :}OUR ONE SMALL AIRFIELD OPENED IN
 1964 WAS RECENTLY RESURFACED AND      
 REALIGNED TO BECOME"FIFE AIRPORT" AND 
 CATER FOR INCREASING BUSINESS TRAFFIC,
 THOUGH STILL ONLY FOR SMALL AIRCRAFT. 
 THE NEAREST MAIN AIRPORT IS IN        
 EDINBURGH(APPROXIMATELY 50 KM AWAY).
