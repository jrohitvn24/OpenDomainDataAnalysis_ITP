		<content> Larbert station was built in 1865, and
 renewed in 1975. It is on the main    
 lines from Glasgow to Perth, Dundee   
 and Aberdeen and from Edinburgh to    
 Stirling and Perth. It is a very busy 
 station-from the timetable we counted 
 20 trains to Glasgow, 32 trains to    
 Edinburgh and 64 trains to Stirling   
 and the North (and the same going in  
 the other direction) per day. This    
 station transports a lot of{goods}but 
 is predominantly a{passenger}service. 
 The goods trains mainly carry coal,   
 petrol and steel. The first edition   
 Ordnance map shows two stations in    
 Larbert. One was a cattle station and 
 served the local tryst or cattle      
 market. It helped in the decline of   
 the tryst, as{rail transport}became   
 cheaper than the drover method"on the 
 hoof".
