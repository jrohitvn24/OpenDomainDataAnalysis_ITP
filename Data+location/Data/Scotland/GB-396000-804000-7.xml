		<title>07ABERDEEN'S COASTAL WATERS</title>
		<content> Looking out to sea one usually spies  
 a variety of vessels lying offshore.  
 Those anchored relativly close to     
 shore are usually supply boats        
 either waiting for berths in the      
 harbour to be vacated or are          
 avoiding berthing charges.Amongthem   
 manoeuvere little trawlers and even   
 smaller salmon-cobbles.Further        
 offshore are larger oil tankers       
 waiting to be called to a rig to load 
 on oil destined normally for          
 Rotterdam.Between shipments the       
 cheapest option is to anchor offshore 
 rather than cruise up and down the    
 North Sea for a week or so.           
 Often on a clear day the gigantic     
 steel structure of an oil rig looms   
 on the horizon.Standing there as a    
 reminder,as if needed,of the present  
 dependence our society has on oil     
 as the major energy source.           </content>
