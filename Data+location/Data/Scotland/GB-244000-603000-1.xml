		<content> The river Doon roadens as it flows    
 through Bogton Loch with its          
 surrounding marshes which form an     
 ideal nesting ground for wild duck and
 other marsh birds.  The loch is       
 overlooked to the North and East by   
 the slag bings and houses of          
 Dlellington, a one time mining village
 with its post war suburb of Bellsbank 
 standing bleakly above the trees along
 the river. To the South and West of   
 the loch the ground rises steeply in  
 the grassy hills of the Southern      
 Uplands with scattered woods to       
 spruce and larch provideding shelter  
 for the Blackface Sheep and Galloway  
 cattle of the neightbouring hill      
 farms.
