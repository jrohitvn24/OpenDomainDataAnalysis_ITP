		<content> Next to Donibristle House is the      
 cricket pitch surrounded by bushes,   
 shrubberies, wild flowers and very old
 trees, some over lOO years old. The   
 cricket pitch is no longer used for   
 cricket instead many people walk the  
 dog there and it is a favourite play  
 area for children living nearby.      
 Children now play football and tennis 
 on the cricket pitch and often climb  
 the surrounding trees. Children also  
 like to pretend they are famous       
 explorers and find new pathways and   
 tunnels through the thick intertwining
 bushes. You will find small groups of 
 children playing hide-and-seek. One   
 child closes their eyes and counts to 
 lOO while the others hide. After      
 counting to lOO the seeker looks for  
 the other children until all have been
 found. The first to be found becomes  
 the seeker in the new game.           </content>
