		<title>10WILDLIFE IN ESKDALEMUIR</title>
		<content>  In 1970 the Economic Forestry Group  
 set up a Wildlife Devolopement        
 Project.This is seen, 15 years later  
 to have controlled the vermin in the  
 forest and to have greatly improved   
 conditions for all the wildlife which 
 colonise its area.The numbers of      
 different bird species have increased 
 from 35 to 85.                        
  Control of the sparrow crow by       
 wildlife management has resulted in an
 increase of the owl, the predator     
 which feeds on the vole an arch_enemy 
 of trees and young plants nest sites  
 of plover and curlew are now dound in 
 Eskdalemuir.                          
  Two animals which kill almost        
 anything are the min and the fox.The  
 latter attacks sheep and lambs with   
 disasterous results.Management of the 
 deer population is an important factor
 in the protection of the forest.      </content>
