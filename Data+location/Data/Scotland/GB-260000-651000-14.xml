		<title>14Transport E.K.Traffic Flow</title>
		<content>    Our starting place is Greenhills   
 Roundabout.The traffic going to       
 Newlandsmuir, (or part of Greenhills  
 itself), must pass three schools on   
 Crosshouse Road;Crosshouse Primary,   
 St.Vincents Primary and Ballerup      
 Secondary.Although there is an        
 underpass and a footbridge,some people
 use the road for quickness.The cars   
 passing are putting the scholars lives
 in danger.If the new Greenhills road  
 were to be opened at the Greenhills   
 roundabout the cars would use that    
 road as a through road and leave      
 Crosshouse road much safer and quieter
 for the residents of this part of     
 Greenhills.We did a survey of traffic 
 on Crosshouse road.We checked for one 
 hour daily for one week.The average   
 no.of cars was 167 cars per hour.The  
 average no.of buses was 28 per hour.  
 This road is too busy.                </content>
