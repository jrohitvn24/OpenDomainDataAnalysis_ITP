		<title>01Benmore Forest and Loch Eck</title>
		<content> Steep sided hills rising up on both   
 sides of Loch Eck.  The summits are   
 over 600m in height. The lower slopes 
 of the hills are planted with         
 coniferous forest.  The hill tops     
 which are very rocky are used for     
 grazing sheep.  There is a small      
 county hotel called  "The Coylet      
 Hotel" and also a small caravan park. 
 The freshwater loch is popular with   
 fisherman.  Above the loch on the west
 side is the "Paper Cave".  Tradition  
 has it that the family papers of the  
 Duke of Argyll were hidden in the cave
 during a period of clan warefare -    
 hence the name.  Most of the area is  
 owned by the Forestry Commission.
