		<title>08  MAUD MART TRADE</title>
		<content> Wednesday the busiest day of the week 
 Maud mart is the biggest one day sale 
 mart in Britain and was the first mart
 in Scotland to get an automatic       
 weighing bridge.They sell cattle,sheep
 and sometimes horses.You can see Sandy
 Duncan the local butcher there in his 
 grey bonnet.You can hear gates opening
 and closing letting stirks from one   
 pen to another,men whistling and      
 shouting, floats starting up.You can  
 smell the beasts.I tried to keep up   
 with the prices.The highest was Â£480, 
 the lowest Â£248.About 650 beasts are  
 sold every week,but the record is 1016
 Breeds are Charolais,Hereford and     
 Friesian.A man writes the weights up  
 on a blackboard, the heaviest today   
 was 650kg. The cattle are sold one by 
 one,they are ready to be killed &amp;     
 eaten.Sheep are sold in lots of 100 at
 one time.                             </content>
