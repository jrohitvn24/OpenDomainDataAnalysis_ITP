		<content> Most of the forestry in our area is   
 owned by Cawdor Estates. It is called 
 Delnies Woods.                        
 We went to interview the factor, Mr.A.
 De Candia .                           
 The forest is a l26 acres in area and 
 there are three main blocks of        
 forestry ; two were planted around    
 l9OO and one was planted in l957. Most
 of the trees are Scots pine and some  
 are European trees. e.g. birch, oak   
 and sycamore.                         
 The estate sells most of the timber to
 Gordon's{sawmill}in Nairn, so they do 
 not have to spend much money on       
 transport.                            
 Most of the trees are mature .This    
 means that the branches can be cut off
 to make room in the forest, and the   
 branches are then sold as{firewood.   
 Delnies Woods is a popular area for   
 recreation-walking and bird-watching .</content>
