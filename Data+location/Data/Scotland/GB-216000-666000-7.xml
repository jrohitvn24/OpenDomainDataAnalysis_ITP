		<title>07A SCHOOL DAY IN SKELMORLIE</title>
		<content>  School begins at 0900 hours when a   
 bell rings, all the children file in  
 and go to their classes.In P6 we say  
 "Good Morning" to our teacher and     
 then say the Lords Prayer.            
  We usually begin by doing Mathemat-  
 ical work,either number work or per-  
 haps measuring and scale or graph work
 We do both practical work and comput- 
 ation.                                
  Then we move on to English based work
 reading,writing,using the library,ans-
 wering questions and discussing.This  
 work is usually related to our Project
  This year our projects have been The 
 Plague and Great Fire of London,Energy
 Weather and Our Village.Environmental 
 Studies,Music and Art are also linked 
 in.                                   
  We have a lunch break from 1230-1330 
 hours and finish at 1515 hours.We go  
 to school from Monday to Friday.      </content>
