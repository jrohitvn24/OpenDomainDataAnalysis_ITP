		<title>12THE BASS INVERURIE</title>
		<content> The Bass is situated at the south end 
 of the town within the cemetry and    
 stands between the rivers Urie (Ury)  
 and Don. There are in fact two mounds,
 known locally as the Bass and the     
 Little Bass. They are small hills of  
 sand and gravel formed by the action  
 of the Urie in geoglogical times. It  
 is a fine defensive site on which     
 stood the first Norman motte and      
 bailey castle in N.E. Scotland. This  
 was built by the youngest brother of  
 King Malcolm IV, David, who was given 
 the title of Lord of the Garioch.     
                                       
 The 14th and 15th century castle  was 
 probably made of wood. It was         
 surrounded by a moat, which is now    
 filled in. The Inverurie Museum       
 contains specimens of mediaeval       
 pottery removed from the moat. This   
 formed the beginnings of Inverurie.   </content>
