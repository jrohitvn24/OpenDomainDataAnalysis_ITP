		<content> The area is dominated by highground   
 with some rough grazing. Lower slope  
 grazing and some afforestation.       
 Forestry for commercial use is        
 gradually encroaching on the area. The
 high ground will of course remain     
 unspoilt. Much of the area is not used
 by man and is rarely seen except by a 
 few hillwalkers. Cattle graze on lower
 grass areas and the occasional sheep  
 is to be found on higher slopes. Small
 streams crisscross the area providing 
 water for nearby farms although human 
 habitation is not present within the  
 block.
