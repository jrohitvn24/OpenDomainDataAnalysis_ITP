		<content> Wilton Dean is a small village on the 
 outskirts of Hawick.   It is a quiet  
 peaceful place, with 177 inhabitants. 
                                       
                                       
 The former school had two small rooms,
 heated by coal fires.   The children  
 worked on slates.   Fo some of their  
 work they went on Nature Walks.   In  
 the summer holidays , the school was  
 used by the adults for dancing and    
 bowling.                              
                                       
 Wilton Dean had no water supply other 
 than a well.   Outside the houses were
 gas lamps, attended by a man every    
 night and morning.  In the mornings he
 would wake people for work.           
                                       
 The adults looked on all the children 
 in the community as members of one big
 family.                               </content>
