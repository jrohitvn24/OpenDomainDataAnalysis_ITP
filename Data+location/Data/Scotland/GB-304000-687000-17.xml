		<content> I interviewed 60 children and asked   
 them what they did in their spare     
 time.15% of the children do dancing in
 their spare time.100% of the children 
 watch TV in their spare time.85% of   
 the children do sport, 45% do hobbies 
 15% of the children do work.75% of the
 children play.I was surprised that    
 only 5% did computing.5% also did     
 gardening and 5% went shopping.10%    
 went places like Edinburgh and some   
 went to Pony Shows.10% visit          
 relations and 5% go to church on      
 Sunday. I thought that this was       
 strange so I asked them again if they 
 went to church or visited their grans 
 and the 5% changed to 20% and 10%     
 changed to 60%.
