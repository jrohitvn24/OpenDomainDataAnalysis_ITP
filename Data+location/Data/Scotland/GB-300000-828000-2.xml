 Although Grantown-on-Spey lies        
 sheltered in the Spey Valley, it is   
 within easy access of the Cairngorm   
 Mountains, among the highest in       
 Britain.                              
                                       
 From Grantown-on-Spey there aee many  
 local hill walks.  To the North and   
 West of the town the moors stretch out
 past Dreggie to Laggan Hill and Gorton
 Hill.  Both are about 400 metres high 
 and give good views of the surrounding
 area.  To the south of the town lies  
 the Haughs of Cromdale,foothills of   
 the Cairngorms.  These hills were the 
 site of a famous battle in 1690, an   
 incident recorded in the popular folk 
 song.  For the more adventurous the   
 Cairngorms lie a mere 20km away.
