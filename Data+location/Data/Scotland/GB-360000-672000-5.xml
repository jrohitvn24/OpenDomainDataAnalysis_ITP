		<content>{THE KINDLY MONSTER                    
 Although it is not with in our        
 designated area I would like to       
 mention that not far away sits a      
 harmless monster,a volcanic plug      
 called {Traprain Law }. It is a good  
 hill to climb and from our village it 
 looks like a sleeping whale.          
         There is a legend that an     
 ancient king called {Loth }lived there
 and from him our area took its name of
{Lothian }.                            
           There was also a Celtic     
 tribe lived there.They were the {     
{Votadini. }They lived in mud huts and 
 made peace with the Romans when they  
 invaded Caledonia.                    
          In 1919 a silver treasure    
 from Roman times was found there and  
 can now be seen in the National Museum
 of Antiquities in {Edinburgh }and is  
 well worth a visit.                   </content>
