		<content>{Lifeguard Patrol on Portobello Beach.{
 Throughout the summer members of the  
 newly formed{Edinburgh Lifeguard Club 
 will patrol a section of Portobello   
 Beach every Sunday from noon to 4pm.  
 They will provide a rescue and first  
 aid service for beach users as well as
 offering advice to bathers about water
 conditions. Each patrol will end with 
 a{rescue demonstration.               
  This service has only been made      
 possible by months of hard training to
 obtain the necessary qualifications   
 and through fund raising events to    
 purchase the special safety equipment.
  Distinctive red and yellow flags mark
 the area which the Lifeguards can     
 cover at present but the next major   
 equipment target is a{rescue boat}_   
 costing around Â£1500 _ so that        
 ultimately the whole beach, from Joppa
 to Seafield, can be patrolled.        </content>
