		<title>19PENNY FOR THE POP</title>
		<content> On 5th November,Bonfire Night,        
 children in Stromness go round the    
 houses with 'pops':turnips cut and    
 shaped into the form of a head. Extra 
 features eg hat, pipe, hair might be  
 added.They knock on doors and ask for 
 " a penny for the pop ". After        
 commenting on the 'pop', the house-   
 holder will give the children some    
 money.(Each house usually has a supply
 of small change ready).The children   
 then move on round the other          
 houses.Later the 'pop' is thrown on   
 the bonfire where there's the usual   
 guy and fireworks.The origin of this  
 custom isn't known, but the children  
 are probably burning the Pope. Most   
 are unaware of the religious          
 significance of what they're doing. In
 fact there is no bigotry in the       
 Islands. The children keep the money!
