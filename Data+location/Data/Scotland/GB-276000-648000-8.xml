		<content> ALTHOUGH IN THE WINTER WHEN THERE IS  
 NOT ENOUGH SUN, THEY STILL FOUND IT   
 MORE ECONOMICAL.                      
 THE HOUSES HAVE NO PROBLEMS SUCH AS   
 DAMPNESS OR CONDENSATION AND THE      
 TENANTS THOUGHT THAT THESE TYPE OF    
 HOUSES WOULD BECOME MORE POPULAR IN   
 THE FUTURE.                           
 THIS SYSTEM OF HEATING HAS TWO MAIN   
 ADVANTAGES:                           
 1. THERE IS ALWAYS HOT WATER.         
 2. IT IS MORE ECONOMICAL THAN GAS,    
 ELECTRICITY OR COAL.                  
 THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE IS THAT IT IS   
 EXPENSIVE TO INSTALL SOLAR ENERGY IN  
 HOUSES.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
