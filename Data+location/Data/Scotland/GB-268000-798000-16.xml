		<title>16NEWTONMORE, THE VILLAGE  2</title>
		<content> cont./ The railway came in 1863 and   
 Newtonmore's population grew. Each    
 house originally had access for cows  
 to the pasturage beside the Spey,     
 called "The Acres". On part of this   
 meadow ground the golf course was laid
 out . The Golf Course has come to be  
 an important asset to the tourist     
 trade which has developed over the    
 last hundred years. Tourism is now the
 main industry and the main source of  
 income - the Village has fifteen      
 hotels and guest houses. Pony trekking
 was first promoted here in 1952.      
 The sporting estates and hill farms of
 the country westwards towards Laggan  
 keep communication links through      
 Newtonmore. The road has steadily     
 grown in importance and the major     
 reconstruction of the A9 main trunk   
 (over the last seven years) has seen  
 the road bypass the village.          </content>
