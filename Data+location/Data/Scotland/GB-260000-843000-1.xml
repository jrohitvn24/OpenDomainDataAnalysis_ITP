   We live in the Scottish Highlands   
 about 4km from Inverness. The land    
 in our area is mostly rural and in the
 main sparsely populated but stretches 
 into the suburbs of Inverness where a 
 lot of new houses are being built. The
 houses in Bunchrew are mostly recently
 built. Most of the people work in     
 Inverness, and usually travel there by
 car.                                  
   If people want to go swimming,      
 skating, to the theatre or cinema,    
 they have to travel to Inverness.     
 There is only one small shop in our   
 village and people either drive or get
 the bus to the supermarkets or stores 
 in the town.
