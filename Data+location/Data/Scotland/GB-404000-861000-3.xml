 Lairds game.To get the fishermen off  
 his land the{Laird paid 20 people each
{Â£5}to build new houses nearer to the  
 sea.They built their houses beside the
 old{kirk of St.Colm.}One fisherman    
 did not receive any money so he went  
 to the{neighbouring Laird for money.

 of the{March stream}thus founding
