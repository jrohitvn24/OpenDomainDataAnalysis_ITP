		<title>20FARMING - PART TWO</title>
		<content> Since farms in Crosshill and          
 Kirkmichael are now mostly owner      
 occupied and are worked mainly by     
 families, mechanisation plays an      
 important part in modern farming. In  
 the milking parlours specialised      
 automatic feeding is used. Other      
 cattle are fed from silos which       
 contain grain or finely chopped       
 silage. Extensive use is made         
 of tractors which have cabins for the 
 driver to sit in. Combine harvesting  
 is done mostly on a contract basis as 
 the machinery is expensive to buy and 
 maintain.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
