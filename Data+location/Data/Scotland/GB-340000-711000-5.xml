		<content>  Most people travel out of the area to
 work  and  many  are in jobs which are
 related  to  agriculture.  The  number
 unemployed  is  small  and most people
 enjoy their work.                     
                                       
  There  were  divided views on whether
 new  industries  should  be introduced
 into our area.  Some people  suggested
 that   other   industries  related  to
 agriculture should be introduced. Some
 suggested craft or cottage  industries
 but most people  wanted  the  area  to
 remain as it  is  at  present  because
 they  said  they enjoyed the beauty of
 the countryside.                      
                                       
  Those who travel to work outside the 
 area have chosen to stay here because 
 of  the   picturesque   villages  and 
 pleasant surroundings.
