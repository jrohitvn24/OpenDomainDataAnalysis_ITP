		<title>10Linwood and Johnstone</title>
		<content>{Linwood}is a small town on the        
 outskirts of{Paisley}in the{          
{Strathclyde Region.}The name Linwood  
 means{"Sheltered Neuk","Wooded Area". 
 There has been a village for many     
 hundreds of years,but Linwood has now 
 grown quite large.Many people came to 
 Linwood in the past to work in the    
 cotton mill,the paper mill and the    
 many mines here.More recently people  
 came to work in the car factory and to
 find housing when nearby{Glasgow}     
 became overcrowded.Unfortunately the  
 car plant has since closed and there  
 is now a lot of local unemployment.   
 Neighbouring{Johnstone}is another     
 small town.A famous son from{Elderslie
 in Johnstone was{William Wallace,}who 
 led the Scots in the{Scottish Wars of 
{Independence.}Johnstone today is a    
 busy and thriving place.
