		<title>04AUCTION MART</title>
		<content> The Mart which can sell about 6000    
 animals a week,was built in 1930 but  
 it had to be rebuilt in 1953 after a  
 big gale.There are four animal sales  
 in a month and one furniture sale.The 
 Mart has about 400 shareholders among 
 whom Â£8000 profit is shared.They      
 employ 3 full time workers and 10 part
 time workers.Prices vary depending on 
 quality &amp; demand.The highest priced   
 cow was Â£1470.Mr Slater,got Â£505 each 
 for 5 steers but he thought he could  
 have got more for them.Sometimes the  
 animals get frightened by the noise &amp; 
 strange surroundings.Some animals are 
 sent to the Slaughter House,while     
 others are sent south on the St.Ola or
 are bought for other Orkney farms.    
 Sheep are selling for between Â£50 &amp;   
 Â£70.The signs for bidding are a nod ,a
 twitch of the cheek,winks and  lifting
 a finger.                             </content>
