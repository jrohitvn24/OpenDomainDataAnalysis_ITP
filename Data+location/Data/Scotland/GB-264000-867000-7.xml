		<title>07ALNESS HOUSING</title>
		<content> Until the 1960's Alness was a         
 small, compact settlement. Three      
 parallel streets,High Street, Averon  
 Road and Perrins Road form the core of
 the original village.                 
 The first major new housing estate    
 built was Salvesen Cres.,situated in  
 the east end of town.In the early     
 seventies new housing schemes were    
 built to accomodate the increasing    
 population i.e. Kirkside, Firhill,    
 Westford, Coulpark,Burnside in the    
 west;Shilling Hill and Milnafua in    
 the east.                             
 As the population increased so did the
 number of private estates. Darroch    
 Brae, Obsdale Park,Whitehills and     
 Braeface Park are examples of private 
 housing areas.These houses are modern 
 with surrounding gardens. All these   
 estates are situated in pleasant      
 surroundings.                         </content>
