		<content>  Birnie Church is about 3km south of  
 Elgin and 1km from the River Lossie.  
 It is the oldest church in continuous 
 use in Scotland. It was built in 1140 
 on the former site of a 6th century   
 Celtic Church which in turn was       
 established by Brendan the Navigator  
 on a pre_Christian stone circle       
 sanctuary.The church font and the     
 unusual rectangular hand bell are of  
 Celtic origin.The church is on a hill 
 surrounded by trees and farmland.The  
 road to the church is tree_lined.In   
 1729 the west wall had to be rebuilt  
 and yet it looks the oldest wall of   
 the church.The walls are almost 4 feet
 thick.The church has 3 stained_glass  
 windows painted by a local artist.It  
 was the first cathedral of Moray.The  
 Minister,Mr Torrie,is its 23rd since  
 The Reformation.
