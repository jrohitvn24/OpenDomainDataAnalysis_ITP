		<content> Up until 1957 horses were used as     
 working animals on farms in this area.
 The introduction of machinery has had 
 an impact not only on the number of   
 farm workers but also on the occupancy
 of farm cottagesand on the number of  
 children attending rural primary      
 schools.                              
   In 1950 a 170 acre farm in the area 
 had 5 farm workers, yet in 1985 with  
 the farm now 600 acres in size, only 2
 farm workers were employed.           
   Machinery found on a typical 600    
 acre farm is:-                        
 3 tractors:2 cultivators;1 plough;1   
 drain drill;1 sprayer;1 combine;1     
 round bailer;1 muck spreader;1 slury  
 whisk;1 slury pump;1 slury tanker;1   
 grain dryer;1 landrover;1 truck.      
   Where specialised machinery is      
 needed agricultural contractors are   
 then employed.                        </content>
