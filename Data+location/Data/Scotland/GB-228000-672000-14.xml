		<content> In the early 1950's our school, {St   
{John's}, had over 1000 pupils. There  
 are now less than 200 on the roll.  At
 the age of 12, pupils from our school 
 transfer to {St Stephen's High School}
 in upper Port Glasgow.                
 Recent years have seen a great        
 expansion in educational opportunities
 for Port Glasgow people.  The town can
 boast one nursery, eight primary, two 
 six year comprehensive schools (both  
 with rolls of about 1200) and an Adult
 Training Centre.                      
 Recently the non-denominational and   
 Roman Catholic comprehensives have    
 been working together in order to     
 provide as wide a curriculum as       
 possible for their senior pupils.
