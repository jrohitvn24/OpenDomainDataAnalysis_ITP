		<title>10The A75 Euroroute-1</title>
		<content> The A75{Euroroute}is notorious for its
 vehicle{accidents.}Over the past few  
 years there have been numerous        
 accidents, many of which resulted in  
 serious injuries and death.           
                                       
 The main reason for this is the volume
 of traffic with which the A75 has to  
 cope. Lorries choose this route to go 
 south into the country from the ferry 
 port at Stranraer and since the       
 Heysham Line was closed down, there   
 has been an increase in their numbers.
 Not only is the volume of traffic a   
 problem but also the{size and weight. 
 It was bad enough when the lorries    
 were{32 tons,}but an increase in      
 weight to{38 tons}has led to serious  
 problems. The council have a never    
 ending job repairing and maintaining  
 the road and the vibrations caused by 
 the heavy lorries going by cause      </content>
