		<content> Most of the farming in the area is a  
 mixture of arable and stock breeding  
 for meat production.  There is also a 
 small amount of fruit farming.        
 The increased use of machinery and    
 contractors to do such jobs as        
 ploughing and crop spraying has meant 
 a decrease in the number of farm      
 workers. Chemical fertilisers are     
 commonly used nowadays.  There is a   
 fear that, as more farms are taken    
 over by firms or groups, things will  
 become more difficult for the smaller 
 family farms. In the autumn children  
 are employed to help with potato      
 lifting, and the schools close in     
 October for a week's "Tattie Holiday."
