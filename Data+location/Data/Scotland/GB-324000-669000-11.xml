		<title>11KINGS BUILDINGS EDINBURGH</title>
		<content> When we visited the King's Buildings, 
 which are part of{Edinburgh           
{University,}we were told that there   
 were approximately 20 departments.    
 The principal areas of research are   
 information technology, chemistry,    
 biology and physics.  The             
 non-university departments are a block
 which is associated with the British  
 Geological Survey, owned by one of the
 research councils. There is also an   
 animal breeding unit and the Royal    
 Observatory.                          
 The total number of people employed is
 around 500. Of these, about 250 are   
 academic staff. The total number of   
 students is about 2500. British       
 students make up about 95% of the     
 students. The rest are from overseas. 
 30 or 40% are female. There are also  
 about 700 post graduate students.
