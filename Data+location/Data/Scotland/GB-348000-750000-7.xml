		<title>07RESWALLIE ESTATE</title>
		<content> Reswallie House is now owned by       
 Colonel (retd.) J.D. Lloyd-Jones O.B.E
 (the administrator of Glamis Castle). 
 His land covers roughly seventy acres.
 The Colonel is very conscious of the{ 
{ECOLOGY}of his land. Much of his land 
 is covered by bogs and marshes and is 
 therefore useless, but he has about   
 twenty acres of usable{FARMLAND}which 
 he lets out out to local farmers.     
 As part of his{CONSERVATION}ideas he  
 has set aside fourteen acres of his   
 land for Scots pine trees. As well as 
 this he recently purchased a section  
 of the{DISUSED RAILWAY}which runs     
 through his land. On this there are a 
 considerable amount of Silver Birch   
 trees which he has decided not to     
 remove. Despite farmers' requests to  
 remove hedgerows he has decided       
 against it, to preserve the native    
 fauna and flaura.                     </content>
