		<content> If you are in Dunfermline you will    
 frequently hear the name "Carnegie" _ 
 the man who gave away Â£350 000 000. It
 is Andrew Carnegie, born in Moodie    
 Street in 1835.  He went to America in
 his childhood and became the "King of 
 Steel" and the richest man in the     
 world.                                
    When he came back he bought        
 Pittencrieff Glen to be used for the  
 benefit of the citizens of            
 Dunfermline.  He provided the money to
 build the Public Library, Swimming    
 Baths and Carnegie Hall.  He also set 
 up the Carnegie Trust which           
 administers the Carnegie money,       
 providing finance for many Dunfermline
 projects.                             
    Local schools benefit from the     
 trust with annual prizes and grants.
