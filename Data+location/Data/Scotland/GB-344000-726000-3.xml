  Our block has a long long history.It 
 contains{Morton Island}which was the  
 first place inhabited in Scotland.In  
 the early Stone age the land around   
{Morton}was completely covered with    
 sea and mud flats.Around{6000BC}a     
 group of 12 people came and camped on 
{Morton Island.}The land since then    
 has grown rapidly and is now thriving 
 forest land where deer and rabbit     
 prosper.                              
     Tayport also had the first{rail   
{ferry}in the world.It ran from Tayport
 harbour over the river Tay and was    
 built by{Thomas Bouch}in 1846.He also 
 built the more famous Tay rail bridge 
 which collapsed in 1879.              
     Tayport no longer has a rail      
 connection with the outside world     
 since the Tay road bridge was built in
 1966.                                 </content>
