		<title>16The Law and Laggan</title>
		<content> Laggan has had no resident policeman  
 since 1955.The nearest policeman lives
 in Newtonmore 8 miles away and the    
 nearest police station is in Kingussie
 12 miles away.Aviemore-25 miles away  
 is the closest fully manned           
 station.Most policing is done by      
 car,van,motor-cycle and in bad weather
 by Range Rover.There is a small court 
 which sits in Kingussie.The nearest   
 prison is Porterfield at              
 Inverness.Since we have excellent     
 liason between police and school,the  
 children still grow up knowing who    
 their local "Bobby" is.
