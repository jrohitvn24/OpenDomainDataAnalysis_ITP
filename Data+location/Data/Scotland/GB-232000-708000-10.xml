		<title>10Inversnaid  the Garrison</title>
		<content> The old Garrison of Inversnaid stands 
 on a knowe overlooking the old pass   
 from Loch Katrine to Loch Lomond at   
 the confluence of the Snaid and       
 Arklet. It was built in 1719 after the
 '15 rebellion to control the          
 Highlanders especially{MacGregors,}led
 by Rob Roy.                           
  There is a{legend}that just before   
 completion the builders were sitting  
 round the fire one evening when a     
 knock was heard on the door. When they
 answered it a band of MacGregors burst
 in,piled all the wood up,sent the     
 builders off into the night and set   
 fire to the place. It was a two       
 storeyed building,built round a       
 central courtyard. Only a few of the  
 walls remain. Garrison Farm now stands
 on the site. It is the setting for the
{Inversnaid Sheepdog Trials.  }        
                                       </content>
