		<content> EDUCATION IN THE AREA IS              
 COMPREHENSIVE.EDUCATION IS VALUED BY  
 MOST PEOPLE.                          
 THERE ARE 4 SIX-YEAR COMPREHESIVES IN 
 THE AREA AND 24 PRIMARIES.AS THIS IS  
 SCOTLAND,PUPILS LEAVE PRIMARY AT AGE  
 11 AND GO STRAIGHT TO SECONDARY.      
 THE KEYWORD IN EDUCATION AT THE MOMENT
 IS CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM FROM  
 PRIMARY TO 18+.                       
 THE MAIN CHANGE IN SECONDARY IS IN THE
 14-16 AGE GROUP WHERE 0-GRADES ARE    
 BEING REPLACED BY STANDARD            
 GRADES.THESE WILL ALLOW ALL PUPILS TO 
 GAIN SOME KIND OF QUALIFICATION AT THE
 AGE OF 16.                            
 TEACHERS ARE NOW IN DISPUTE WITH THE  
 GOVERNMENT OVER PAY. THERE HAVE BEEN  
 DAYS OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION AND         
 MANY TEACHING PERIODS HAVE BEEN LOST. 
 STRIKES ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE THROUGH
 1986.                                 </content>
