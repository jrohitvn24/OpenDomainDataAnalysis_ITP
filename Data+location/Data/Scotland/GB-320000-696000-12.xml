		<title>12WESTFIELD OPEN-PIT MINE</title>
		<content> February 1985 brought the end of      
 24 years coaling by Costain mining at 
 Westfield,{the deepest open pit       
{coalmine in Europe,}with a production 
 total of 34,500,000 tonnes of coal.   
 Often described as the{biggest man    
{made hole in Scotland,}the Westfield  
 pit near Kinross in Fife has been a   
 highly successful operation.          
 Westfield was developed in four stages
 from 1961 onwards and has produced a  
 total of some 22 million tonnes of    
 washed coal- that is coal in which    
 certain impurities have been removed  
 The four contracts were let in        
 1961,1968,1973 and 1976.              
 The fourth stage is a separate pit on 
 the south side of the B9097 road and  
 has been mined by open cast methods.  
 This mine has just been exhausted and 
 the company is in the process of      
 reinstating the land.                 </content>
