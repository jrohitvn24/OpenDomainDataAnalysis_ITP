		<title>03CARMUNNOCK VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Carmunnock is a very pretty little    
 farming village about 15 miles from   
 the centre of{Glasgow}.Anyone         
 interested in{history}or{architecture}
 would really enjoy a visit.           
                                       
 Most of the houses are 18th century   
 although Carmunnock's story dates as  
 far back as{The Bronze Age}.          
                                       
 Carmunnock was made a{CONSERVATION    
{VILLAGE}in 1974, which is just as well
 because the huge sprawl of{Castlemilk}
 is less than a mile away.             
                                       
 It is funny to think that the first   
 people to live in the{18th century}   
 houses must have lived through{       
{Covenanting}times and{Jacobite}       
 uprisings!                            
                                       
                                       </content>
