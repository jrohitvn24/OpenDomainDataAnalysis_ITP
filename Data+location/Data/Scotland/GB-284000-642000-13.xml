		<title>13Shopping Customs</title>
		<content> When shopping many people prefer      
 smaller shops in the village or the   
 mobile shops which travel round the   
 houses. They like them because you can
 talk to people and get to know the    
 shopkeepers. In Kirkfieldbank there   
 are two general stores an there is a  
 newsagents which also sells food. All 
 the shops in the village give a       
 friendly service and two are open on  
 Sundays. However, most people when    
 shopping for their weekly groceries go
 to Lanark by bus or car to the        
 supermarkets there. For clothes or    
 larger household purchases most       
 families would travel the twelve miles
 to the more populous area of Hamilton,
 Motherwell or Wishaw. Some people     
 would even go as far as Glasgow or    
 Edinburgh in order to find the exact  
 item they are looking for. Local      
 people also shop by post.             </content>
