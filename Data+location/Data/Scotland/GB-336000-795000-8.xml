		<title>08A DAY AT THE TOURIST OFFICE</title>
		<content> Checked weather at Field Centre.      
 Postcard arrives from American        
 cyclists. They had accepted my advice 
 to stay in Ballater and not try the   
 1:5 hill to Tomintoul in a heavy rain 
 storm. Braemar office phoned: is there
 a post bus to Glen Muick?  Letter in  
 to book for Braemar Games, where to   
 get them in now? Most places in       
 Braemar, Ballater full,it will have to
 be Dinnet, Aboyne or Tarland! Busy but
 manage coffee, then out to bank for   
 change.Lot of people eating ice-cream 
 so the weather must be better at      
 last. Dutch couple in. No cash for    
 boat home. Can they phone Holland?    
 Back later to phone again- having     
 found money. Phone call about caravan 
 for July-impossible all booked. Couple
 in for B&amp;B-double or twin? Almost     
 closing time- can I book room in      
 Inverness? Managed Aviemore instead.  </content>
