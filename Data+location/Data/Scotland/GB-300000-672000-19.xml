		<content>  Everyone we interviewed at the Regent
 Centre all knew about Beecraigs       
 Country Park.We interviewed twenty    
 five people and they all thought that 
 Beecraigs was an excellent idea.A few 
 people said they had been fishing at  
 Beecraigs in the past.Some people     
 liked,or would have liked to try      
 walking,climbing,archery,fishing,using
 the trim course and the barbecues.    
 Nobody wanted to do canoeing or       
 sailing.A few people went to art  and 
 craft demonstrations.                 
 Anna  and I went to the Cross to      
 interview people.                     
 When the numbers of people had        
 been put together we found that 75% of
 those interviewed knew of the         
 activities at Beecraigs.              
 55% went to the park about once a     
 month,15% went more than once a week. 
 Everybody thought the park a good idea</content>
