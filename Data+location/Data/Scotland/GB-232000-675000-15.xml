		<content>    In the middle of Cardross there are
 a few old beautiful trees, on which   
 there is a preservation order.        
 Recently 2 trees were cut down without
 permission by the regional council to 
 create a bus bay. These trees took    
 over a hundred years to grow so the   
 council now have to plant 2 more on   
 the insistance of Cardross Community  
 Council.                              
    Geilston House was built as a gift 
 to Cardross village from the Burns    
 family. They also left money in trust 
 to maintain the hall. Peolple could   
 only give donations for the use of the
 hall. As a result of massive inflation
 all the money has been used. The      
 Community Council are now taking over 
 the hall with the District Council's  
 help to make it a community centre.
