		<content>     After breakfast I helped Dad      
 to fill up the oil pump in the        
 tractor. Some of the oil went into    
 his eyes and he had to go up to the   
 house to wash the oil out. After that 
 we had sandwiches and a yogurt for    
 dinner.                               
    In the afternoon we braised the    
 fuel pipe of the tractor, put it      
 back on the tractor and then we washed
 it.                                   
    Before tea I did some side_raking  
 with the hay-turner and the 135, a    
 Massey Ferguson tractor. After tea we 
 brought the hogs down from the Heather
 Hill to be clipped during the next    
 day.After that I fed Kevie and checked
 the sheep again.                      
    At 9.30p.m. I went to bed.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
