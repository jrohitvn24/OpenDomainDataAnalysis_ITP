		<title>02Fishing in Fraserburgh</title>
		<content> Fishing is a very popular job.Fishing 
 can be dangerous when the sea is      
 rough.A boat can carry 1000 fish or if
 it is a big boat it can carry more.   
 There are about 7-8 crew in a boat and
 the longest a boat usually goes away  
 for is 8-10 days.Boats that are       
 fishing can fish until they are 3     
 miles from Fraserburgh.When you are   
 fishing beside Norway you can fish    
 until you are 15 miles from           
 there.Fraserburgh fish stocks are     
 dwindling so some boats will be going 
 elsewhere.Boats have automatic        
 pilots.There are three kinds of       
 fishing;purse,seine and trawl.When you
 trawl you use otter boards.To purse   
 you shoot the net,circle round it and 
 when the net is in a circle you haul  
 it in.To seine you shoot the ropes    
 instead of the otter boards.
