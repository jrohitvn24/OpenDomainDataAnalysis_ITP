		<title>09HEALTH CARE IN ARBROATH.</title>
		<content> In recent years many local people have
 campaigned to keep the Infirmary open.
 Mr.Kerr,the administrator,told us that
 two wards are now in use.He said the  
 Infirmary was important to the local{ 
{community}because it helped the{      
{population}to see relatives without   
 having to travel.It also provivides{  
{employment}for a few people in the    
 town.The Infirmary deals with people  
 who have heart attacks,chest          
 complaints,who need examinations.There
 is also a maternity unit.In the       
 future Mr.Kerr said the Infirmary     
 hoped to expand the surgical          
 services.People needing majmor surgery
 would need to start up a psychiatric  
 ward Mr.Kerr said that they worked    
 very closely with Arbroath Health Care
 to ensure good{health}care.
