<content>This is a low-lying area which slopes gently from South to North towards the Moray Firth. It is a very rich farming area as it is low-lying, gently sloping with very fertile soils. Part of the town of  Forres, mostly residential, lies in the south-west corner of the block, and the golf course is also found in this area. The main road and railway line linking Aberdeen and Inverness run from east to west through the block.There is also some woodland in the block, most of which is coniferous. A new business park has been built in the centre of the block which provides some employment for Forres. There are a number of interesting historical features to be found in the area, including  Sueno's Stone and remains on Cluny Hill .&lt;br />
