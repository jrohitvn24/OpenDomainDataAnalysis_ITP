		<title>13HOUSING IN SHIELDAIG</title>
		<content>    BECAUSE OF THE SCENIC BEAUTY AND   
 MILD CLIMATE OF THIS PART OF SCOTLAND 
 SHIELDAIG HAS BECOME RATHER A         
 FRAGMENTED VILLAGE WITH MANY HOUSES   
 BOUGHT AND USED ONLY AT HOLIDAY TIMES.
 ALMOST ONE THIRD OF THE DWELLINGS ARE 
 UNOCCUPIED IN THE WINTER MONTHS.      
    SOME OF THESE HOUSES BELONG TO     
 FAMILIES WHO HAVE MOVED AWAY BUT STILL
 FEEL THEIR ROOTS BELONG IN THE        
 HIGHLANDS.                            
    AS THE COUNCIL HAS BUILT A DOZEN   
 NEW HOUSES, YOUNG MARRIED COUPLES HAVE
 NOT FOUND IT SO HARD TO RENT          
 ACCOMODATION.                         
    MOST OF THE HOUSES WHICH ARE STRUNG
 ALONG THE SHORE FRONT HAVE BEEN       
 PAINTED WHITE WHICH GIVES THE VILLAGE 
 A FRESH CLEAN APPEARANCE.   JUDGING BY
 THE NUMBERS OF CAMERAS WE SEE, THIS   
 MUST BE ONE OF THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED  
 VILLAGES IN BRITAIN.                  </content>
