		<title>10Holidays in Crossmichael</title>
		<content> Crossmichael is an excellent place for
 holidays. There are many tourists in  
 the summer. That is when the town gets
 littered with chip papers. When the   
 tourist season is over the place looks
 much tidier, but you still see some   
 tourists at other times of the year   
 when it is cheaper.                   
 There are good shops and the pub is   
 very friendly. The Culgruff Hotel just
 outside Crossmichael provides ample   
 hospitality. There is a good          
 watersports club on the banks of Loch 
 Ken. There is wind surfing, canoeing, 
 and water skiing.                     
 Nearly every week there are fishing   
 competitions. The main species of fish
 is trout and there are also a lot of  
 pike and perch. The biggest pike      
 caught in the loch is 73 lbs. They    
 have still got its head in the Gun and
 Tackle Sports shop in Castle Douglas. </content>
