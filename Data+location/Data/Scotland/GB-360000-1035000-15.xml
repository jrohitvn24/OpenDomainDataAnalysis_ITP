		<title>15MRS SCOTT</title>
		<content>  Mrs Scott, born on 2nd July 1901     
 in South Myre of Sanday Island, has   
 never left Orkney in her life. She    
 went to Cross School in the South End 
 of Sanday which is opposite South Myre
 where she lived. After leaving school 
 she worked as a servant at Stove along
 with 42 others, then at Backaskaill.  
 When she was 22 years old she went to 
 Kirkwall where again she worked as a  
 maid in various places for another    
 nine years.                           
  When she came back to Sanday in 1931 
 she married John Scott, a tenant at   
 Stove which in 1921 was split into    
 nine holdings with tenants for each.  
  In 1972 there was a fire at Stove    
 which burnt out most of the buildings 
 and ruined the farm.                  
  On February 19th 1980 Mrs Scott's    
 husband died. She is now 84 years old 
 and has her 36 cats for company.      </content>
