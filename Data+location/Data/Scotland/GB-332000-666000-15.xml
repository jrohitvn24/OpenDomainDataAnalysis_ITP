		<title>15Historical Buildings</title>
		<content> Most of these buildings can be found  
 in the High Street. Starting at the   
 north end with Dalkeith Palace,       
 remodelled in 1701 from an earlier    
 castle, you pass St Marys Chapel,     
 built in 1845. Further along there is 
 the Corn Exchange(1854) and the       
 Tolbooth Hall(1827). Across the road  
 lies St Nicholas Church, recorded as  
 far back as 1372, restored in 1854.   
                                       
 Continuing onto Eskbank Road you would
 reach the War Memorial(1919) and the  
 Water Tower(1879). Elsewhere are the  
 Old Barracks erected in 1864 and used 
 by both Police and the military.      
 Nearby is Newbattle Abbey, founded in 
 1140. The present building was        
 contracted in 1580 and includes many  
 fine features. It is now a Residential
 Adult Education College.
