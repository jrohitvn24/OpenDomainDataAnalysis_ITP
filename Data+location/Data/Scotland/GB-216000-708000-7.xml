		<title>07A day in the life of Angie 1</title>
		<content>   I get up at eight o'clock but my    
 sister gets up at half past six to go 
 to the grammar school.I go into the   
 living room and I meet my Dad.Then I  
 go and have a wash get dressed and my 
 Mum would have my breakfast ready.I   
 eat it then I feed my rabbit.Once I   
 have done that I wait for the school  
 car.                                  
   I go into the school and say our    
 prayer then I do my news and maths. We
 go out for our playtime,come in and I 
 do my english.We have our lunch at    
 half past twelve and Mrs Warnock cooks
 it.I have a game of tennis.We have    
 only got three pupils in our school so
 it is hard to play any games but we   
 manage.We do art on a Thursday and it 
 is my favourite lesson.Then we do our 
 homework words.In our afternoon       
 playtime we go up to our little garden
 and water the flowers.                </content>
