		<content> The Post Office. Most of the services 
 the post office provides are well     
 used. The incoming mail is sorted at  
 Bixter, the next post office, and     
 delivered from there. The outgoing    
 mail is sorted at Aith then put to the
 head office at Lerwick.               
 The Telephone. The telephone is widely
 used. Of the 75 houses in the block,  
 59 have phones. The only kiosk in the 
 block is by the post office.          
 C.B.Radio. C.B. is popular in Shetland
 and is extensively used. There are a  
 number of C.B.ers in the block.       
 Television and Radio. Most people have
 t.v. and radio. Generally Shetland can
 receive all four channels but most of 
 this block cannot receive Channel 4 at
 the moment. There is a local radio    
 station which provides local news and 
 programmes of local interest.
