		<title>18STONEYWOOD(ABERDEEN).</title>
		<content> Stoneywood Mill is a paper mill. Some 
 families have worked in it for        
 three generations. The main water for 
 the mill comes from a pond &amp; a river. 
  The Stoneywood Park is boring.There  
 are only 8 swings &amp; a tiny chute.     
 Because of this people have signed a  
 petition for more equipment, but it   
 was ignored.There is plenty of grass &amp;
 trees there which boys use as their   
 goalposts.The council did erect goalp_
 osts,but vandals pulled them down.    
  The park was once a cattle market.   
 Also farmers engaged seasonal farm    
 hands there.It was called a "Feein    
 Market".Market Street in Stoneywood   
 got its name from this.               
  Dyce Academy &amp; Primary were built    
 about ten years ago.Before that every_
 one went to Bankhead Academy.Dyce     
 Primary is one of the largest in Scot_
 land.It has around 1000 pupils.       </content>
