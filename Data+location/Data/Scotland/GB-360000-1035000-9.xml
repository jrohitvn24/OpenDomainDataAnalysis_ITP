		<content>  The Wart, the highest point on the   
 island at 65 metres above sea level,  
 is the site of the{radio station}and  
{two steel pylons.}The taller pylon is 
 52 metres high and was erected by     
 Balfour Beattie in 1976. It has eight 
 dishes attached and has a red aircraft
 -warning light on top. This pylon is  
{not fully operational,}and its{purpose
 is{obscure.}The smaller pylon plays an
 important part in the{radio-telephone 
 links of the of the Northern Isles.   
 The first radio station  on the hill  
 was built in the early 1940s during   
 World War II. The diesel-generating   
 shed was sunk in the ground to prevent
 bomb damage. In 1955 the present      
 station was built and two engineers   
 used to attend to its electricity     
 generator.Now there is a mains supply,
 with standby generator.
