		<content>  Our school opened in{1884}and last   
 year celebrated its{centenary}with    
 many events. The{Victorian era}was    
 strongly featured with one classroom, 
 teacher and pupils, as it might have  
 been in 1884. Our art room became a   
 Victorian parlour with many{exhibits  
{made}by the{children themselves.      
  The gym./assembly hall was laid out  
 with school{memorabilia_}photographs, 
 Log Books, trophies etc. Some of the  
 most interesting exhibits came from   
{past pupils}in the form of snapshots, 
 Report Cards, needlework samplers and 
 letters.                              
  At a{dinner}former members of staff  
 joined with the present to reminisce. 
{More}than a{thousand}nostalgic{former 
{pupils,}many of whom had travelled    
{long distances,}attended an{Open Day  
 and happily{renewed friendships}begun,
 in at least one case,{fifty years ago.</content>
