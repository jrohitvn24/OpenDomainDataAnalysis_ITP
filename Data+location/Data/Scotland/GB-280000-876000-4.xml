		<title>04STOCK REARING,FEARN.</title>
		<content>  As most of the farms in the area are 
 arable or mixed farms, there are no   
 farms relying purely on stock         
 rearing.There are two dairy farms     
 which have about 120 milking cows     
 between them.The milk is collected by 
 tanker daily and sent to Nairn for    
 bottling.Some farms have sheep and    
 cattle.The cattle are wintered        
 indoors.Before 1980 almost all cows   
 calved in October.Nowadays most calve 
 in May which saves on winter feed     
 costs.Though sheep are left out in    
 winter,the ewes are taken inside for  
 lambing.Their winter diet consists of 
 bruised barley with added             
 fishmeal.Lambs over 10 weeks old are  
 sold, the nearest mart being at       
 Dingwall.Fearn Farm has some champion 
 animals.Mascot is the champion bull   
 and Petal the champion cow. They have 
 champion Clune and Charollais sheep.  </content>
