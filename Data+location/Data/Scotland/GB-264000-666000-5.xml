 used to supply water for the mills of 
 the city via the Molendinar Burn.     
 Officially opened as a park in 1924,  
 it has a walkway round the water, and 
 lots of grassland.  The island in the 
 middle of the Loch is an official {   
{Bird Sanctuary.}In addition to the    
 ducks and swans it provides a home for
 coots, moorhens, Canadian geese and   
 snow geese.                           
   Throughout the year Hogganfield Loch
 is visited by the local people -      
 joggers, people sunbathing and having 
 picnics on the grass, families taking 
 a trip round the Loch in the motor    
 boats and anglers fishing for pike and
 perch.  It is used for watersports and
 there is also a boating club for      
 Glasgow schools.  Presently there are 
 two sanded areas being constructed    
 which young children will enjoy.      </content>
