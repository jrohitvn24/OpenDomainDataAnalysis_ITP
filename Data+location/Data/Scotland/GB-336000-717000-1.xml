		<content> This D-Block lies to the North of the 
 market town of Cupar, Fife. It is an  
 area of gently rolling countryside,   
 the majority of which is farmed as    
 intensively managed grainland. The    
 highest point of this area is 173     
 metres at Myrecairnie Hill. About 1/3 
 of our block contains crops other than
 grass, including soft fruits, barley  
 and oilseed rape. Throughout the area 
 there are scattered patches of        
 woodland which is mainly deciduous, a 
 small proportion of which is owne by  
 the Forestry Commission. Overall,     
 woodland makes up about 8% of the     
 total area. A small stream meanders   
 gently through the South of this area.
  The settlement of pattern is         
 typically rural, incorporating large  
 farms and cottages, each quite a      
 distance from the next. There are 11  
 seperate farms in the area/no villages</content>
