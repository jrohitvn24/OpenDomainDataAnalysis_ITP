		<title>15Boys' games, Balornock</title>
		<content> I am a ten year old boy and I live in 
 Balornock,Glasgow.I attend Knockburn  
 Primary School.The children in our    
 school play lots of different games   
 like football,tig and rounders.My     
 favourite game is{Netbask Ball.}This  
 is how you play.You need two benches  
 and a ball.You also need two teams    
 with about six players in each and a  
 referee.Each team must choose one of  
 its players to be a keeper.One keeper 
 stands on each bench.Each team stands 
 spread out in front of the opposing   
 team's bench ie the bench with the    
 opposing team's keeper on it.The idea 
 of the game is for each team to try to
 get the ball to its own keeper while  
 stopping the other team from getting  
 the ball to its keeper.Each time a    
 keeper has the ball he scores a point 
 for his team.After ten minutes the    
 team with most points wins.           </content>
