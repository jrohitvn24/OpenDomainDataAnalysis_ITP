		<title>08LOBSTER FISHING, CARNOUSTIE</title>
		<content>  {Lobster fishing}is carried on at the
 small village of{Easthaven.} Frank    
 Dunbar is now a full-time lobster and 
{crab}fisherman, having fished in his  
 spare time for 30yrs.                 
   Mr.Dunbar spends about 6hrs. a day  
 tending his creels, taking in the full
 ones and putting down the             
 freshly-baited ones.  Frank uses 90   
 creels and these have to be repaired  
 from time to time.  He also makes his 
 own creels which he does mainly in the
 winter months.  It is very hard work  
 pulling up the creels and he hopes to 
 buy a larger boat soon, which will    
 pull them up by machine.              
   Once a week the{lobsters}and{crabs  
 are taken to{Jonshaven,}a village     
 north of{Montrose,}by lorry.  Then    
 they are taken to{Aberdeen}from where 
 they are flown abroad.
