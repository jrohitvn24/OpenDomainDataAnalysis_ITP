		<title>20Land Coverage Dalgety Bay.</title>
		<content> Before the construction of private    
 housing a large area of Dalgety Bay   
 was covered in deciduous and evergreen
 woodland. Over the years this has been
 cut down to make way for new building 
 sites. However,small areas of woodland
 have been conserved near the shore.   
 Areas of farmland used for growing    
 grain crops such as barley,oats and   
 wheat and as pasture for sheep have   
 been reduced to make way for          
 housing and roads. Farming land and   
 deciduous and evergreen woodland still
 remain toward Braefoot Point but even 
 some of this land has been cleared for
 the building of Shell/Esso liquid gas 
 terminal.
