 with 498 hectares of rented land and  
 267 hectares of owned land.Both have  
 houses on the farm.They have had the  
 farm for 16 years and it was run by   
 their father and uncle before         
 them.They occasionally have help but  
 most of the work is done by the       
 family.                               
   They keep 605 sheep,21 suckler      
 cattle and 1 bull;and 20 shetland     
 ponies and 2 stallions.They grow 8    
 hectares of hay, 1 hectare of corn and
 a few turnips and potatoes.           
   They have a tractor,baler,rotavator 
 and other machinery to help them.Their
 busiest time is from May through to   
 December.                             
   The animals are sold in Autumn to   
 provide livelihood through the year.  
 Most animals are sent by truck to
