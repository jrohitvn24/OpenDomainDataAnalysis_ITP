		<title>15LIFE STYLES AT SANDHEAD</title>
		<content>     The essential feature of life in  
 our community is that of the family.  
 As Page 7 CLUBS can show,the small    
 size of the community does not detract
 from the quality of life as the local 
 residents wish to live it. The women  
 of the district are particularly      
 active in organizing and supporting   
 the Churches, the school, the senior  
 citizens and various young peoples'   
 activities. Committees are formed and 
 the ladies and their husbands give    
 time, energy, and usually finance to  
 make any and eveything a success. I   
 would quote a Glaswegian lady thanking
 us for our annual support of her work,
 " I speak often of your school high up
 on the hill in its peaceful situation,
 but a hive of industry within, all for
 the benefit of those who are in need  
 of help." The school mirrors the      
 community in which it is based.       </content>
