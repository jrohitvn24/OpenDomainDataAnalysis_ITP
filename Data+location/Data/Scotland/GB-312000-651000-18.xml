		<content> Most of the people who go to church in
 West Linton are members of St. Andrews
 Presbyterian church. This church is   
 very old.                             
    Mr Burt was appointed as minister  
 to this parish in March 1985. Before  
 that he worked in a church in         
 Zimbabwe.                             
   The children like him very much as  
 he is young and is good fun. He has   
 two young children of his own so he is
 used to children. He tells us very    
 nice stories at the church service.   
   We have a weekly assembly on        
 Thursday morning in school and Mr.    
 Burt leads the service. He uses a     
 flannelgraph to show us pictures when 
 he tells us a story from the bible. At
 present he is telling us the story    
 about Elijah. After the story we sing 
 hymns.                                
   Many children go to Sunday school . </content>
