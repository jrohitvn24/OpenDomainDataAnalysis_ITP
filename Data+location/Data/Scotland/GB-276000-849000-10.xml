		<title>10MAINS OF CROY FARM.</title>
		<content> In Croy and its surroundings,         
 farming is  the main work.The main    
 farm in Croy is called The Mains Of   
 Croy farm.The livestock are cattle,   
 but only a few,and some sheep.Their   
 livestock are entered into Cattle     
 Markets such as the Fraser and        
 Macdonald Markets.Their fields contain
 grass,barley,potatoes,turnips,carrots 
 and corn but it all depends on what   
 season it is.Their sheds store        
 hay,straw,potatoes and other various  
 types of vegetables.A full day of     
 farming starts at five-thirty in the  
 morning till half past seven at       
 night.Machines such as                
 tractors,ploughs and combine          
 harvesters help people with farming   
 today.Today we don't need so many     
 people as in the past for farm work.
