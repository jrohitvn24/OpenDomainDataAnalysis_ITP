		<title>11BROUGHTY FERRY - POPULATION</title>
		<content> There is a tremendous cross-section of
 ages of people living in Broughty     
 Ferry. Younger families tend to live  
 in the newer private housing estates  
 such as Balgillo while older residents
 tend to reside in the more established
 parts nearer the centre of Broughty   
 Ferry.Some sheltered housing is       
 available for the elderly,and there   
 are several residential homes for     
 those unable to live on their own.    
 Broughty Ferry with its excellent,    
 convenient facilities is a much sought
 after area for retired people.        
  Considerable movement of population  
 is apparent especially as this is an  
 attractive residential area. This is  
 particularly evident in the housing   
 estates where families are younger and
 parents are moved subject to business 
 commitments.                          
                                       </content>
