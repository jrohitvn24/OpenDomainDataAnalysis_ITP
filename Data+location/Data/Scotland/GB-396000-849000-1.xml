		<content>    The block is in many ways typical  
 of rural Buchan in N.E. Scotland, but 
 has its own unique features.          
                                       
    It slopes gently from a height of  
 107 metres in the west to a height of 
 132 metres at the centre 46 metres in 
 the east. The land drains south       
 and east into the River Ugie system.  
 Land use is predominantly forestry    
 in the west and arable/stockrearing   
 in the east. There is one village,    
 Fetterangus, a planned settlement of  
 the 1770's near a much older and now  
 deserted site. The small settlement   
 at Cairnorchies seems to be based     
 on an old system of smallholdings.    
 Other habitations in the              
 block are based on farms or crofts.   
                                       
    There is evidence of human         
 occupation from prehistoric times.    </content>
