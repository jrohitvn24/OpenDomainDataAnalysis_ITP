		<title>19Trade, New Galloway</title>
		<content> New Galloway has 2 general grocer's   
 shops, a Post Office/gift shop, a     
 butcher's shop, an antique shop, a    
 boutique, a garage and a              
 hairdresser's. One can, also, buy coal
 and bottled gas(there is no piped gas 
 in New Galloway) locally.There are    
 also many self-employed businesses    
 e.g. joiner, architect, solicitor,    
 woodwork sculptor, window cleaner. In 
 fact, all basic needs are catered for.
 We have a Citizens'Advice Bureau in   
 New Galloway but for Consumer         
 Affairs, one must go to Castle        
 Douglas. For larger or more unusual   
 purchases, one must travel to Castle  
 Douglas/Dumfries or Ayr.              
  The shops, as in many small villages,
 are, also, meeting places. Shopping   
 can be time consuming but one is      
 compensated by the kindly, personal   
 touch shown to each customer.         </content>
