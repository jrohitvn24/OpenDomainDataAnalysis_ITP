		<content> In 1920 the majority of the houses had
 thatched roofs, no toilets or inside  
 water supply. Water was carried from  
 wells in the village street. Only     
 eight of the larger houses had inside 
 conveniences. There was no electricity
 or street lighting in the village.    
 Houses were lit by candles or paraffin
 lamps. Cooking was done on the open,  
 solid fuel kitchen range. There were  
 no tarmac roads, no school jotters -  
 only slates and slate pencils for the 
 children to use. There were no buses, 
 so all the people going to Dundee had 
 to walk daily to and from the station 
 to get the train. There were no       
 televisions, radios or telephones.    
 Communications were done by telegram. 
 Horse carriers brought goods from     
 Dundee twice a week for the village   
 shops, and the rail porters made their
 deliveries by hand barrows.           </content>
