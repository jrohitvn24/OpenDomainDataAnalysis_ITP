		<title>20NITHSDALE COVENANTERS.</title>
		<content>  In the 17th.century this area saw the
 struggle by Presbyterians who rejected
 the introduction of bishops into the  
 government of the Church of Scotland. 
  These presbyterians were adherents of
 the National Covenant which swore to  
 uphold original principles of the Kirk
 &amp; included ministers who had been rem-
 oved but who continued to conduct open
 air services.These conventicles were  
 well attended in this area.           
  The Stuart Kings instigated measures 
 to root them out,with Grierson of Lag 
 as their local agent.Many were killed 
 without trial or right of reply.This  
 savagery reached its height during the
 Killing Times of the 1680's.          
  In the graveyard at Kirkbog stands a 
 monument to The Nithsdale Martyrs who 
 were victims of these times.It was    
 erected by the descendants of exiles  
 who settled in New Zealand.           </content>
