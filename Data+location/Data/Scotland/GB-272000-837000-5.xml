 Dear Joanne and David,                
                       I am writing to 
 tell you about life in the 1920's.    
   When I was in school the teachers   
 were called Mrs Macintosh and Miss    
 Fraser.There were about sixty children
 and some of them were orphans.I wore a
 kilt to school.At the age of thirteen 
 I left school.I went to the Inverness 
 High school on my bike which was a    
 James.                                
     The A9 (the main road in Daviot)  
 has changed the village in the way    
 that people thought that it would go  
 right through the village, but instead
 it goes behind the church.            
   Every Tuesday my father went into   
 town in his Morris Cowley.            </content>
