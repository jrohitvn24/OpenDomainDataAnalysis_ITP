		<title>15FOOD</title>
		<content> In the old days people grew or reared 
 nearly all their own food, but        
 nowadays most people tend to buy it   
 from shops, markets or supermarkets   
 growing only what they can use        
 themseleves or freeze for the winter  
 months.  For most of us meat from     
 animals plays a large part in our diet
 but some people think it is wrong to  
 kill animals for food, so they only   
 eat vegetables.  They are called      
 'Vegetarians'.  Three of the most     
 common meats are Pork, Beef and       
 Mutton.  Foreign food has become very 
 popular.  There are two Chinese       
 restaurants in the town of Castle     
 Douglas.  People are more aware of    
 what foods are good for you.  Foods   
 such as brown bread, milk, vegetables 
 and fruit are good for you where as   
 chips, sweets, doughnuts and the like 
 are unhealthy.                        </content>
