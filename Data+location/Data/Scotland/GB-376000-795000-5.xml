		<title>05Forestry in Durris</title>
		<content> There are several forests in our block
 which have been planted by the        
 Forestry Commission.They consist      
 mainly of Sitka Spruce with some Scots
 Pine and European Larch.There is a    
 Forestry Office in the block and quite
 a lot of people are employed by the   
 Commission in forestry work.Many of   
 the forests were planted over forty   
 years ago,and are the right age for   
 cutting,so there is a lot of felling  
 to be done just now.You can hear the  
 sound of power saws every day and see 
 the huge lorries carrying the cut     
 trees away.Up in the forests there is 
 a lot of machinery for lifting and    
 dragging the trees out.So much wood   
 has been taken out lately that the    
 whole landscape round here has        
 changed.The timber is used for making 
 into pulp for paper,furniture and     
 pallets,and some for firewood.        </content>
