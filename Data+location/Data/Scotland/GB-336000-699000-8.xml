		<title>08 Births  and  Deaths</title>
		<content>  We did our survey in  the ten week   
 period from the 17th April to the 19th
 June 1985.We gathered information from
 our local newspaper the East Fife Mail
     Altogether there were 86 deaths.  
 43 were male and 43 female.(We were   
 surprised to find both sexes equal).  
 The average age of death was 71 years.
 The oldest person to die was female   
 aged 96 years.The youngest was a male 
 aged 33 years (No cause was given).   
    Of the 61 babies born 31 were boys 
 and 30 were girls.Our findings show   
 the births are not balancing with the 
 deaths which may lead to a drop in    
 population.                           
        We found it is the opposite    
 in Glenrothes New Town  where births  
 outnumber deaths.This is probably     
 because young couples are moving from 
 Levenmouth to Glenrothes where there  
 are more job opportunities.           </content>
