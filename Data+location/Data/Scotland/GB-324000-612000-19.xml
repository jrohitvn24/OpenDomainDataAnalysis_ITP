		<title>19ETTRICK VALLEY TOURISM.</title>
		<content>   In the valley there are two caravan 
 parks and they are open from March to 
 October.They are open that time       
 because in the Winter the weather is  
 too cold for tourists.Both the parks  
 are mostly static caravans but there  
 is some room for tourers and tents.You
 can also go fishing in the river      
 Ettrick or the Tima and at the top of 
 the Tima valley here is a small loch  
 where you can hire a rowing boat.There
 is a lot of walking on the forest     
 roads and there is also the Southern  
 Upland Way by which you can walk over 
 the hills to St.Mary's Loch.The       
 Southern Upland Way starts in the West
 at Portpatrick and finishes at        
 Cockburnspath in the North-East.Quite 
 nearby there is a Pony Trekking       
 Centre.Peace and Quiet are the main   
 attractions.
