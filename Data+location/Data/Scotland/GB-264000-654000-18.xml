		<content> OUR GOOD SCHOOLS IN EAST KILBRIDE.    
 This is a page about the education    
 system in Scotland.                   
  You might go to a nursery school from
 3-5 years of age then go on to a      
 primary school. You spend seven years 
 there and then go up to high school.  
  The earliest you can leave high      
 school is at the age of l6 but some   
 people stay for 6 years.              
  Most of the schools in East Kilbride 
 are fairly new and well kept. The     
 grass is cut regularly and smashed    
 windows are replaced quite quickly.   
  Recently teachers have been taking   
 action(including strikes) because they
 want to have their salaries reviewed. 
  There are 3 nursery, 20 primary and  
 6 high schools in East Kilbride. The  
 primaries in our area are Blacklaw,   
 Halfmerke,Hunter,Long Calderwood,     
 Maxwellton,St.Hilary's,St.Leonard's.  </content>
