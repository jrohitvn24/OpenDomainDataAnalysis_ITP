		<content> The sheep are fed on grass in the     
 summer and hay and cake in the winter.
 Other animals include two goats whose 
 milk is used for drinking by animals  
 and humans. There are two dogs, both  
 sheep dogs. The youngest one is being 
 trained and brings in the cows. There 
 are five cats, two horses and poultry 
 whose eggs are sold. The farm has     
 eleven out buildings which are used   
 for storing hay, silage, cake, straw, 
 machinery, housing the cows and calves
 and for milking. A typical day would  
 be to rise at 5.00am, bring in the    
 cows and milk them and finish by      
 8.00am. Mr.Shuttleworth would then    
 have breakfast and work in the fields 
 with the sheep or cattle. At 12.00pm, 
 he will have an hours lunch break and 
 then work outside again spreading     
 fertilizer or slurry or roll the      
 fields.                  (CONT.)      </content>
