		<content> Pennyvenie and Clawfin are the only   
 farms now left in the Cummock Valley. 
                                       
 There has been a farm at Pennyvenie   
 for more than 300 years.  The present 
 mainly stone-built steading replaced  
 one nearby reputed to have been the   
 home of John Patterson, a noted local 
 Covenanter in the seventeenth century.
 The family now working the farm is    
 directly descended from him.          
                                       
 The cluster of farm buildings lies    
 just off the B741 two kilometres east 
 of Dalmellington.  It is a family     
 business and Mr Ireland stocks sheep  
 and a few cattle on his 124 hectares  
 of rough grazing most of it steep open
 moorland.  Near the farmstead there   
 are some greener fields which at      
 intervals are fertilised, ploughed and
 seeded.                               </content>
