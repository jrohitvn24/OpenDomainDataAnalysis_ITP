		<content>{Housing and the Pulp and Paper Mill}  
      There is little in the way of    
 houses within the survey block.       
      However, what there is divides   
 nicely into four groups.              
      At the west of the survey area is
 council housing built originally to   
 accomodate workers of the Pulp and    
 Paper Mill built in the early 60's.   
      Further east and separate from   
 the council houses are executive      
 houses built originally for the Pulp  
 and Paper Mill management.            
      With the closure of the Pulp     
 section and the streamlining of the   
 Paper Mill, much of the workforce has 
 since left the area and these houses  
 are now much sought after by the      
 residents of nearby Fort William.
