		<content>{The Kate Kennedy Pageant,}a colourful 
 costume procession, takes place       
 annually in the streets of St.        
 Andrews.The principal members of the  
 cast are drawn from the {Kate Kennedy 
{Club}whose members are students or    
 members of staff in the University of 
 St. Andrews.They are assisted by a    
 small group of eleven year old boys   
 from one of the local primary schools 
 who act as pages. Although the origins
 of this pageant are fairly obscure it 
 is generally accepted that it started 
 as a student 'rag' when one student   
 dressed up as {Katherine Kennedy,     
{legendary niece of Bishop James       
{Kennedy.}The pageant has developed    
 over the years and now has a cast of  
 around seventy which includes well    
 known characters of university and    
 town through the ages.
