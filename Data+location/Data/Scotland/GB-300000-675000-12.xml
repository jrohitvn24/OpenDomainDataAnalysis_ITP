 which runs through Linlithgow,began   
 in 1818 and was completed in 1822.It  
 runs from Edinburgh to Glasgow and was
 built for passangers and barges       
 carrying coal and manure.

 "Victoria".There is also a Museum run 
 by the society showing the history of 
 the canal.                            
   There is a{Canoe Club}which meets   
 on a Thursday at the canal and is open
