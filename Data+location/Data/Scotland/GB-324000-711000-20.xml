		<content>{Rough shooting}is popular along the   
 hedgerows and in the woods. Rabbits,  
 pigeons and pheasants are all shot,   
 both as sport and, in the case of     
 rabbits and pigeons, as pests. The    
 rabbit has made a huge comeback since 
 its population was desinated by       
 Myxomatosis early in the 1950's. The  
 rabbit causes most damage in Winter   
 when it destroys fields of winter     
 wheat. The pigeon also in recent times
 has become the enemy of farmers.      
 Pigeons do great damage to oilseed    
 rape, especially in winter, and       
 attempts to control them are          
 necessary. Pheasants are more often   
 specifically introduced to provide    
 sport for huntsmen who pay the land   
 owner for the privilege of a day's    
 shooting.
