		<title>07THE VILLAGE (cont.)</title>
		<content> aid the less agile worshippers of the 
 past to mount their horses, their     
 wives behind them.  In the church is  
 kept a plaster-cast of the early      
 Celtic cross found in the manse       
 garden; the original now held in the  
 National Museum of Antiquities,       
 Edinburgh.  The church is to become a 
 "linked charge" with Gullane church in
 late 1985.                            
                                       
 Also situated at the western end of   
 the village, on the southern side of  
 the main road, is the school which    
 caters for primary pupils aged from 4+
 to 12.  The present school building   
 was opened in 1931 and was built as a 
 replacement for the then grossly over-
 crowded premises which were located on
 land now occupied by an extension to  
 the Kilspindie Hotel.  In July 1985   
 the school roll stood at 66 pupils.   </content>
