		<content>   Our survey showed that while the    
 Mearns area has a high proportion of  
 car owners, an efficient and reliable 
 public transport system is still      
 important for the young and elderly.  
   The Western S.M.T. bus company (now 
 Clydeside S.M.T.) provide two local   
 services and some passing-through     
 services to and from Ayr, Carlisle,   
 Castle Douglas, Newton Stewart and    
 Stranraer.                            
   Two main routes take traffic into   
 this area. These arteries are Ayr Rd  
 and Mearnskirk Rd 1km apart. At peak  
 times Ayr road carries about 1000     
 vehicles in each direction per hour.  
 This is halved at off-peak times. The 
 Mearnskirk road carries about 2/3 as  
 much as Ayr road.                     
   A proposed extension to the M77 from
 Haggs Castle should improve           
 the road network in this area.        </content>
