		<title>17The Canonbie By-pass</title>
		<content> Before June 1984 the A7 trunk route   
 from Carlisle to Edinburgh ran through
 the middle of Canonbie village and    
 crossed two bridges on the way north  
 to Langholm. In 1982 Balfour-Beatty   
 began work on a by-pass to the West of
 the village. It took them two years to
 build and it cost Â£7 million. The     
 by-pass is 4.65 miles long.           
 It was very noisy and dirty living    
 near it while it was being built so it
 was a relief when it was opened in    
 1984. Mr E. Armstrong a local         
 councillor opened the by-pass and the 
 pupils of Canonbie school were invited
 to the opening. Mark Little of the    
 school presented the scissors to Mr   
 Armstrong to cut the tape.            
 Traffic through the village has been  
 cut down a lot but the traffic on the 
 by-pass drives at speeds well over the
 legal speed limit.                    </content>
