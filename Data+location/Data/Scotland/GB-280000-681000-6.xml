		<content>{THE RIVER CARRON}flows past our school
 . We have been on several nature walks
 but have not seen many signs of life  
 in the river. Even water beetles were 
 scarce. The stones of the river bed   
 were covered with slime. This may have
 come from past industries which let   
 untreated waste empty into the river. 
{RE-CHEM}which destroys and makes safe 
 dangerous chemicals by burning, has   
 been under investigation for links    
 with animal and human defects. As yet 
 no trace of the{PCBs or DIOXINS}have  
 been found in soil samples.  Often    
 there is a pungent odour throughout   
 the area which is said to come from   
 the{SEWAGE WORKS.}One particular      
 sewage works converts the solid waste 
 to cake blocks. It is from this       
 process which the offensive odour is  
 said to come. Perfume has been used in
 vain to sweeten the air.              </content>
