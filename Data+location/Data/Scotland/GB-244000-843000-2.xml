		<content> Cluanie-an-Teanassie is a deer farm   
 It has 1500 acres of land, 1000 acres 
 being hill land comprising scrub,     
 birch and bracken, 250 acres are      
 grass land and 250 acres are          
 woodland.The latter is very important 
 in  deer farming as it provides       
 shelter and a place where the hinds   
 have their calves. There are 700 head 
 of deer-350 hinds, 300 calves and 50  
 stags. In winter they are fed on a    
 variety of concentrates. There is a   
 private abbatoir on the farm where the
 owners do their own slaughtering and  
 buchering. Different parts of the     
 animal are cut up,weighed and         
 packaged.Each package label shows the 
 part of the animal,weight,price per lb
 and and the cost of the package.The   
 venison is sold locally and some is   
 exported, mainly to New York
