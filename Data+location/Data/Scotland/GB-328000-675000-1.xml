		<content>  The block allocated to St Mary's     
 Primary School is 75 % sea. Much of   
 the area is used by the Forth Port    
 Authority for Leith Docks and related 
 industries.                           
                                       
 However within the small land mass    
 left unoccupied there is a surprising 
 variety of interesting locations.     
                                       
 This ranges from a Cricket Club which 
 is 100yrs old to the local graveyard  
 which contains the graves of seamen   
 killed in a naval engagement in the   
 Second World War. The area is very    
 historical and includes features such 
 as the site of several Black PLague   
 burial grounds.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
