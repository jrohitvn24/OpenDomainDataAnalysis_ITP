 Westside must be its piers.At Belmont 
 is the roll-on,roll-off ferry         
 terminal for the North Isles Ferry    
 and where fishing boats take shelter  
 in bad weather.In front of the        
 Westside shop is the pier for pleasure
 boats of all types.                   
   Sheep,ponies and cattle roam the    
 open heath and grassland and the Snowy
 Owl is frequently sighted.There is    
 much coastline with otters and        
 seabirds.                             
   The Westside has 4 large lochs and  
 there is a Triangulation Station on   
 Gallow Hill at a height of 99 feet    
 above sea-level.Gallow Hill is the    
 ancient execution site being the      
 highest point in South Unst.          
   The school,both shops and the Post  
 Office are all in the Westside of
