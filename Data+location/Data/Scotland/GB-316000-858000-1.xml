		<content> Mosstowie Primary School pupils from  
 primaries four,five,six and seven with
 ages ranging from 9 years to 12 years 
 of age produced the information for   
 the Domesday Project,1986.            
 There were 3 boys in P4,4 boys and 2  
 girls in P5,1 boy and 3 girls in P6   
 and 5 boys and 2 girls in P7,a total  
 of 20 pupils working in separate      
 groups.                               
 The pupils were apprehensive when     
 introduced to the idea but were soon  
 completely engrossed in the           
 researching,interviewing and writing  
 up of the material.Unfortunately the  
 Scottish schools' summer term was not 
 long enough to do full justice to the 
 work required to complete the project 
 in an area which had so much to offer.
