		<title>16FISHING INDUSTRY-DUNURE (2)</title>
		<content> Catches have changed with over fishing
 of Ballantrae Bank herring spawning   
 stock (now recovering),with new       
 markets home and abroad for species   
 such as hake,monkfish and nephrops    
 (prawns),with more efficient methods  
 and larger boats fishing further      
 afield eg Irish Sea,The Minch and     
 Rockall.Mechanisation has meant fewer 
 crew men are required as nets are now 
 often returned to makers for repair.  
 Crew deal with catch and few boats    
 have more than 2 men skilled in net   
 repair.Dunure fleet once largest in   
 Clyde now carries only 25 boats and   
 crew from Dunure totals about 50 men. 
 70% of 150 strong Clyde fleet depends 
 on prawns taken by trawl.The remainder
 can switch to prawn trawling but      
 depend on short summer herring fishery
 otherwise nomadic changing fishing    
 methods and grounds as necessary.     </content>
