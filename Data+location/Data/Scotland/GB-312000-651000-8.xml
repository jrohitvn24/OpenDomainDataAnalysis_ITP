		<content> My name is Sharon. I am English and   
 I have recently moved up to Scotland  
 as my father has been promoted. I had 
 thought a lot about coming here as I'd
 never lived in Scotland before. I had 
 to leave all my friends and relations 
 behind. Life was'nt easy as the boys  
 and girls teased me. In England  we   
 just don't do that!                   
 We have homework in Scotland but not  
 in England, partly because we had time
 to do all of our work in school.      
 On Mondays we had country dancing.    
 Here we only have it at Christmas. On 
 Tuesdays we had ordinary dancing. We  
 don't have it here.On Wednesday we had
 games,on Thursday we had gym.         
   In Scotland we stop earlier for     
 thesummer holidays. There is only one 
 age group in my new class but in      
 England we had composite classes.     
   I am slowly settling down.          </content>
