		<title>19Shiskine Primary School</title>
		<content>   In Shiskine School there are 47     
 children. The old part was built in   
 1865, and what is now the dining/gym  
 hall was one big classroom. In 1900   
 the porch was built and used as a     
 playroom. Two new classrooms were     
 built in 1967, one now used for the   
 P.5-7 and the other for P.1-2. In 1979
 another classroom was built, and is   
 used for P.3-4. There is also a       
 kitchen and a TV room. There is one   
 teacher in each classroom, a cook &amp;   
 assistant, cleaner, and from Aug.'85  
 an auxiliary/secretary.               
   We play mainly ball games in the    
 playground, dodge ball, netball and   
 football. The favourite game is "kick 
 the can". The object of the game is to
 free your team mates from the other   
 catchers, and hide.
