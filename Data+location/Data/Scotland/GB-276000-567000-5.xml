		<title>05A day in a farmer's life 1</title>
		<content> Mr Thomas Edgar is a local farmer.    
 This is one of his days.              
 A farmer's day usually starts at 5.30 
 am.  He gets up and goes to collect   
 the cows for milking.  He does this by
 standing at the milking parlour and   
 giving a long low whistle. The cows   
 know what the whistle means and come  
 down the hill. By the time Mr Edgar   
 has switched on the milking machine   
 and got the feed ready the cows are   
 coming into the milking parlour.      
 At 7 o'clock the milking is finished  
 and Mr Edgar goes to feed the calves. 
 It is then 7.30 am and Mr Edgar can go
 and get his own breakfast.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
