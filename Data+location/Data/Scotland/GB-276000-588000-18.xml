		<title>18Retiring To The Village</title>
		<content> Mr.Mc.Crossan retired to Moniaive     
 three years ago.He came here because  
 he liked the scenery,the peace and    
 quiet and the way of life.He also came
 here because some of his family live  
 and work in the village.He retired    
 when he was 58 years old and came from
 Clydebank near Glasgow.He was born    
 into a family of twelve and they only 
 had two rooms in a tenement building. 
 Like most people from that area he    
 used to work in the shipyards.He loves
 Moniaive but would like to see a much 
 improved bus service because he does  
 not have a car and there are only     
 three buses a day to and from the     
 village.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
