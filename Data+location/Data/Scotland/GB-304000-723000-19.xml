		<title>19ALMONDBANK-R.N. WORKSHOPS</title>
		<content> The Royal Naval Workshops (Almondbank)
 covers an area of about three hundred 
 square meters. The Workshops are      
 responsible for the repair and        
 maintenance of Chinook, Puma and Lynx 
 helicopters and therefore has         
 connections with all three branches of
 the Armed Services. The complex is    
 guarded by Ministry of Defence police 
 and guard dogs.                       
 Most of the civilian workforce travel 
 to the workshops from Perth, although 
 a small number from the local         
 environment, especially Almondbank    
 village, are also employed there.     
 Helicopters from all over the United  
 Kingdom are sent to the Almondbank    
 workshops for a variety of reasons    
 which include servicing beyond the    
 normal capabilities of routine        
 maintenance and repair outwith normal 
 Services facilities.                  </content>
