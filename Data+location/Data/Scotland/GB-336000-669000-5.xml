		<title>05FA'SIDE CASTLE</title>
		<content> FA'SIDE CASTLE IS ONE OF OUR FAVOURITE
 PLACES.WE GO MAINLY ON FRIDAYS AND    
 SOMETIMES AT THE WEEK ENDS. WHEN WE GO
 UP THERE FA'SIDE LOOKS NICE IN THE    
 INSIDE BECAUSE IT IS BEING REBUILT.   
    WHEN YOU GO INSIDE IT A MAN WILL   
 SHOW YOU ALL AROUND IT.HE TOLD  US    
 THAT HE HAD FOUND AN OLD PAIR OF      
 LEATHER SHOES AND SOME CANNON BALLS,  
 INSIDE THE CASTLE BEFORE IT WAS       
 REBUILT.IT HAS STONE WALLS IT HAS SIX 
 ROOMS IN IT, A DINING ROOM, A TOILET, 
 A KITCHEN  AND A DRAWING ROOM .OUT    
 SIDE IT HAS A GOOD VIEW AND IT HAS    
 BEAUTIFUL WINDOWS. THE CASTLE IS      
 PAINTED CREAM AND HAS TURRETS. IT     
 LOOKS LIKE A FAIRY TALE CASTLE. MARY  
 QUEEN OF SCOTS CAME TO STAY THERE FOR 
 A FEW DAYS.
