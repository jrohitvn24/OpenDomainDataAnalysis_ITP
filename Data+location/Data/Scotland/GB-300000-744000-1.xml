		<title>01Deer Forest N Of Dunkeld</title>
		<content> Topography-the southern edge of this  
 block comprises the highland fault    
 line, north of which the moors rise   
 gradually to the Grampian Mountains,  
 with only one minor road crossing     
 between here and the border with      
 highland region.   This parish of     
 Dunkeld and Dowally has been "deer    
 forest" since the 18th century though 
 it is increasingly managed at this,   
 the southern end of the vast Atholl   
 Estates, for commercial forestry.     
 The River Tay cuts through the hills  
 in an entranched flat bottomed valley 
 which forms the western edge of the   
 block.   The trunk road (A9) and      
 railway to Inverness and a B road     
 follow through the gap, while the road
 from Dunkeld to Blairgowrie (A923)    
 winds its way round the hills and just
 enters the SE corner of the block.
