		<content>  A castle standing on a rock is the   
 first impression of Stirling as you   
 approach it. Then gradually you begin 
 to see the Old Town further down the  
 rock. There are lots of old buildings 
 in this part of the town, which we    
 know as the Top of the Town. The Old  
 Prison, Mars Wark and the Holy Rude   
 Church, where James VI was crowned as 
 a baby, are a few of the buildings.   
 Stirling began as a crossing place    
 over the river. It wasn't so marshy   
 there so it was easier to cross.      
 Nowadays there are three bridges, one 
 for pedestrians, one for vehicles and 
 one for trains. People sometimes call 
 Stirling the "Gateway to the          
 Highlands". The River Forth winds     
 through the flat, open land which     
 surrounds the rock on which Stirling  
 is built. Now the marshy land has     
 dried up and is used for farming.     </content>
