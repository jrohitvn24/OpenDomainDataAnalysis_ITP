		<content>   Since Newport and Wormit are close  
 to Dundee, lots of people do their    
 bulk shopping once a week in a large  
 store there like Tesco or Asda. People
 also do specialist shopping in Dundee,
 for instance furniture or carpets.    
   Newport and Wormit's small shops are
 mainly good for odd things that have  
 been forgotten in the weekly shopping 
 or if things are quickly needed.      
   We interviewed Mr. Brown the owner  
 of Sinclair's, a well known, family   
 grocers. He told us that he may have  
 to make somebody redundant because the
 rates on his shop have become so high.
 He also told us that basics such as   
 butter, sugar, tea and bread sell     
 best.                                 
 We found that 75% of his goods came   
 from various "cash and carries" and   
 the rest from wholesalers such as     
 "Mother's Pride".                     </content>
