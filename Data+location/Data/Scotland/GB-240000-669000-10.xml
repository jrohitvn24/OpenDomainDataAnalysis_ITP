		<content>   One story concerns the ghost of an  
 Irish navvy who is said to haunt the  
 site of the new library, which is     
 where he was buried following his     
 death during the building of the      
 railway. People were worried in case  
 the building of the new library       
 disturbed him and he came to haunt    
 them.                                 
   Formakin House was the location of  
 the following: a newly married couple 
 ran out of petrol one night near the  
 House. The husband walked back to     
 Bishopton and while he was away an old
 woman appeared, said, "He'll no be    
 back," and disappeared. But he did    
 come back, but minus his head which he
 was carrying under his arm _ well,    
 that's what our informer said.....    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
