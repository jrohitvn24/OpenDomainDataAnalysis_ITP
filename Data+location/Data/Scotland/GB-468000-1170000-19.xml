		<content> Even though we live on an island      
 communications with the outside are   
 very good.                            
 There are 29 houses on the island and 
 every house has a telephone           
 About a third of the houses have{CB   
{radio}which can talk up to about 40   
 miles range. Most people use them to  
 talk inside the island instead of the 
{phone}and also to keep in touch with  
 the CB owners all over Shetland       
 mainland.                             
 Another important thing is the{TV}to  
 hear the news and comments from around
 the world and to see the programmes   
 that the ordinary family watches and  
 waits for, as do families all over    
 Britain. Also a third of the          
 households have video recorders.      
 All the boats and some of the houses  
 have{VHF radio.
