		<title>08Balmerino Abbey</title>
		<content> Close by our area you can visit the   
 famous Balmerino Abbey.It is a        
 Cistercian Abbey,now in ruins,but the 
 villagers are raising funds to try to 
 restore it to some of its former glory
 .The Abbey was built in 1229 by Queen 
 Ermengarde,the mother of Alexander 2nd
 .He supervised the building.During the
 Reformation,followers of John Knox    
 destroyed the abbey and killed the    
 monks.Nowadays,it is said that monks  
 can still be seen pushing wheelbarrows
 around the grounds.In the keep there  
 is said to be a ghost who sits and    
 checks the corn for mice and rats.Now 
 in ruins,the Abbey was,during its     
 glory,visited by many famous people,  
 including Mary Queen of Scots.
