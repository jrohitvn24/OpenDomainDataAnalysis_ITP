		<content> Livestock reared in this area is      
 mainly limited to beef cattle and     
 sheep,although some dairy cattle and  
 pigs are also kept.The beef cattle are
 mainly Aberdeen Angus,Hereford and    
 Charolais, while Cheviot, Suffolk and 
 Scottish Blackface are the most       
 commonly kept breeds of sheep.Most    
 farmers keep poultry for their own or 
 local use.Barley and grass are the    
 most common crops,some barley is sold 
 but most is kept to feed stock, the   
 grass being cut as hay or silage.Some 
 oil-seed rape is grown for sale as is 
 a small amount of wheat although our  
 climate does not really suit wheat    
 growing. Swedes are grown as winter   
 feed for sheep and cattle and quite a 
 lot of potatoes are grown and sold    
 locally. Some farmers also keep a few 
 hives of bees.
