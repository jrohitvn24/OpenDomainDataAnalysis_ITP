		<title>04TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS</title>
		<content>     Every family in the Glen must have
 a{private car }so they can get out of 
 the Glen to buy the messages etc.     
    There is no{public transport}apart 
 from the post bus. People can get a   
 lift down to Kirriemuir in the morning
 with the postman in his van.It costs  
 50p. Unfortunately you can't get      
 a lift back.                          
      Nearly all the houses in the Glen
 have{telephones.}Their number has no  
 more than 3 digits.The numbers go up  
 consequetivly because  they were      
 installed at the same time.           
       In Glenprosen not all houses    
 have{television.}The reason is        
 because some houses can't get a       
 signal.Some houses have television    
 but can't get all the channels and    
 some houses television pictures are   
 snowy.                                
     {Newspapers}are delivered by post.</content>
