		<title>09Sheep Shearing, Kinbrace</title>
		<content> Sheep shearing starts in late June.   
 Shepherds gather the sheep and take   
 them into the sheep sheds to make sure
 the wool does not get wet. The shearer
 clips the sheep and another person    
 rolls the fleece on a table. The      
 fleece is taken to a bag.This bag is  
 hung from the roof. The sheep are then
 dipped and marked. The children       
 help in most of the work. The work    
 never stops from early morning to late
 at night except for lunch and a tea   
 break. The sheep manager's wife       
 provides the food and the local women 
 help. The children are very dirty and 
 tired by the end of the day but are   
 pleased with the money they have      
 earned.Most of the shearers come from 
 New Zealand and go to work in the     
 different estates. The wool is        
 collected by the Wool Marketing Board 
 in Evanton.                           </content>
