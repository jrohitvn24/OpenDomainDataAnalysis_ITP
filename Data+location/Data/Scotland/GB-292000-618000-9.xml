		<title>09Housing in Crawford.</title>
		<content> In Crawford there are council houses  
 and private houses.Most of Coronation 
 Drive is council houses and on        
 Dunalastair Road there are two blocks 
 of council flats.There are more       
 privately owned houses in Crawford    
 than council houses or flats.         
 The other day in Crawford a house went
 on fire.Everything in the house was   
 ruined.The fire started in the bedroom
 and carried on from there. The fire   
 happened on the 21st May 1985.A house 
 in the same place was burnt down ten  
 years ago.                            
 There are two new houses being built  
 in Crawford at the moment.Both of them
 are bungalows.One is nearly finished  
 and the other has just got the frame  
 up.                                   
 The largest house in Crawford is the  
 old manse.
