		<content> I am eleven years old and I live in   
 Balornock,Glasgow.I attend Knockburn  
 Primary School and a typical Wednesday
 for me would be like the one I spent  
 on{May 15th 1985.}I got up at 7.15am  
 and had a bowl of Weetabix and glass  
 of milk for breakfast.I got washed and
 dressed and left for school at 8.35am.
 I walked to school on my own but met  
 my friends when I arrived.We played   
 "Impossible Ball" until the bell rang 
 at 9.00am.I spent the day in school   
 where we had lessons in maths,English,
 geography and gym.At 3.30pm school    
 finished and I walked home.I watched  
 television until tea-time when I had  
 my favourite-chips!After tea I did my 
 homework and then put on my uniform to
 go to Guides.I went for my friend and 
 we went to Guides together.We were    
 there until 9.30pm playing games and  
 badge work.I went to bed at 11.00pm.  </content>
