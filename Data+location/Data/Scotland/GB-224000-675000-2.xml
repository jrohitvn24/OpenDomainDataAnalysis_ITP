		<content> DRUG ABUSE IS A GROWING               
 PROBLEM AMONG                         
 YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE GREENOCK-GOUROCK  
 AREA.A WIDE RANGE OF DRUGS IS BEING   
 USED-FROM SOFT DRUGS LIKE VALLIUM AND 
 'GRASS' TO HARD DRUGS LIKE P.C.P.     
 (ANGEL DUST) AND HEROIN.THE AVERAGE   
 AGE OF ADDICTS IS FROM 22-31.THE      
 PUSHERS CUT HEROIN WITH GLUCOSE OR    
 FLOUR.AT THE MOMENT HEROIN IS VERY    
 CHEAP-0.02 OF A GRAM COSTS Â£10.PEOPLE 
 BUY HEROIN IN EITHER Â£10 OR Â£20 BAGS. 
 WHEN THE HEROIN  IS BOUGHT IT IS 91%  
 PURE,BUT BY THE TIME IT REACHES THE   
 STREET IT IS 28% PURE.THE AUTHORITIES 
 HAVE NOT BEEN SLOW TO RECOGNISE THIS  
 PROBLEM,AND A REHABILITATION CENTRE   
 FOR ADDICTS HAS BEEN SET UP AT        
 RAVENSCRAIG HOSPITAL.THE SOCIAL WORK  
 DEPARTMENT ALSO TRIES TO HELP ADDICTS 
 WITH THEIR MANY PROBLEMS.
