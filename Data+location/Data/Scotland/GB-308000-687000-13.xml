		<content> Today the traffic in Dunfermline often
 comes to a standstill at the rush     
 hour.  This happens on such busy roads
 as Appin Crescent and East Port.   At 
 the High Street the traffic comes to a
 standstill not because of the rush    
 hour but because of the construction  
 of new buildings.  The traffic is     
 narrowed down to one lane because of  
 scaffolding and also shuttering which 
 stops falling masonry from hitting    
 cars and pedestrians below.           
    The main traffic problem in        
 Dunfermline is probably car accidents 
 which happen fairly often.            
    Traffic coming in from the South at
 the moment is often rerouted because  
 of the new road being built through   
 the public park and this causes       
 further problems.                     
                                       
                                       </content>
