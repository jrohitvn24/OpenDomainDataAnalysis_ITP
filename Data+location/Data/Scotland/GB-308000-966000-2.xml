		<content> Pennyland Farm is owned by Mr. William
 Alexander. It covers 283 acres. He has
 lived there for forty years. The farm 
 buildings are over one hundred years  
 old. There are thirteen fields, nine  
 for animals and four for crops. He    
 grows forty tons of barley, cuts grass
 for hay and seventeen tons for silage.
 Most of the barley is sold, the rest  
 is stored in a barley pit while all   
 the silage is kept. The hay bales are 
 stacked in a barn, whose roof is soon 
 to be renewed.He has three tractors to
 pull the machinery. They are a plough,
 a disc harrow, a roller, sower, mower,
 baler and a combine harvester. All his
 foodstuff is used to feed livestock.  
 This year he has one bull, 64 cows, 62
 calves and 40 stirks. He rears his    
 cattle for beef. He sells his cattle  
 throughout the year to a              
 slaughterhouse or to cattle dealers.  </content>
