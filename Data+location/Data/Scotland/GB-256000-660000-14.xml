 In Cathcart there is a girl called    
 Shirley Stuart.  Shirley likes her    
 home very much probably because at the
 gable end of the garden there is a    
 fence splitting it from a playing     
 field. The area around Shirley's home 
 is very big and she enjoys it very    
 much. She goes down to the field and  
 makes it a bit safer for the dogs by  
 covering up the broken glass with     
 either cut up old boxes or she goes to
 old dens that are no longer used and  
 looks for carpets.  Shirley goes to   
 her local shopping area.  Shops there 
 have lots of things to choose from.   
 When it comes to birthdays her mum    
 takes her to new shops where there are
 lots of new toys to choose from.      
 Shirley is my sister and she is 9     
 years old and my name is Shona and I  
 will be 11 in July.                   </content>
