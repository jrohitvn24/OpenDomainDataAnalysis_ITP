 school caters for 37 children from    
 5-11 yrs.The Headteacher and Assistant
 teach general subjects.Art,Drama,Home 
 Economics,Music,P.E,are taught by     
 visiting specialists.Because of the   
 proximity to Aberdeen where several   
 parents work offshore in the North    
 Sea oil industry we have children of  
 various nationalities.100 yrs ago     
 children were of farming stock.In 1913
 there were 85 on the roll.Recently we 
 interviewed former pupils.There were  
 memories of:going summer picnics on a 
 hay wagon,singing the National Anthem 
 round the flag on Empire Day,seeing a 
 runaway barrage balloon during World  
 War 2,and the excitement of Musical   
 Festivals in the city.
