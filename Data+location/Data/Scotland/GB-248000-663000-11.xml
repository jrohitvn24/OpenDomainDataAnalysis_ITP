		<title>11THE FOUNTAIN GARDENS PAISLEY</title>
		<content> These gardens were once the property  
 of a prominent business man Mr. John  
 Love.  He was ruined when large       
 shipments to America proved to be a   
 disastrous venture.                   
                                       
 He changed the name from Hope Temple  
 Gardens to the one of Fountain        
 Gardens.  Flowers and shrubs were laid
 out in them and this is maintained    
 today.  Sometimes in the summer the   
 fountain is turned on, but this is an 
 irregular occurrence.                 
                                       
 During my observation this beautiful  
 amenity was largely unused, the public
 merely passing by.  Perhaps if more   
 local people are made aware of the    
 park's existence they will use it     
 more.  It would be unfortunate if this
 historic amenity were to be lost due  
 to lack of use or new development.    </content>
