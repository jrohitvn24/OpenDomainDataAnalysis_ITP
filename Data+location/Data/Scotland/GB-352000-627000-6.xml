		<title>06CLARILAW FARM</title>
		<content>{A farm}of 1000 acres owned until 1981 
 by the Duke of Roxburgh's estates and 
 let to a tenant farmer.               
{The farm}which stands at 155 metres   
 above sea-level consists of grassland 
 and grazing for cattle and sheep. Some
 of the land is very rocky.            
{Now privately}owned, run by a working 
 Manager who lives in one of the 8     
 cottages. Other 3 cottages are        
 occupied by farm workers, 4 rented.   
{The charming}old farmhouse with       
 adjacent outhouses formerly occupied  
 by the tenant is now empty.           
{Great improvements}have been made to  
 increase production of cattle and     
 sheep breeding by buiding a large shed
 for wintering early lambs and for hay 
 storage.                              
{A large silage}shed has been erected  
 for cattle feeding.
