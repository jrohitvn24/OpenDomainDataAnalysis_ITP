 In our village there is one primary   
 school and a special school for       
 boys.The primary school has 136       
 pupils,6 teachers,1 secretary,2       
 cooks,2 cleaners.Our school was built 
 in 1966 and took the place of the     
 earlier Victorian building which was  
 burnt down.School begins at 9.00am    
 with an interval of 15 minutes at     
 10.40am.We have an hour's lunchtime at
 12.30pm after which school finishes at
 3.15pm.When we reach 12 years of age, 
 we go to Bell Baxter High School in   
 Cupar.                                
                                       
 ENTERTAINMENT                         
 We are badly off for entertainment for
 young people in the village.Most      
 people travel to Glenrothes for       
 dancing,cinema,swimming &amp; sport.{     </content>
