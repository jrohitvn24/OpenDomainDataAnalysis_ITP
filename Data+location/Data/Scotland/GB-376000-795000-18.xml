		<title>18Living in Durris</title>
		<content> We carried out a survey in the class  
 to find out what pupils liked about   
 Durris and what they didn't like.They 
 said they enjoyed the fresh air,peace 
 and quiet and the lack of traffic.They
 liked the landscape of farms and      
 woods, which is good for exploring and
 watching wildlife.They were keen on   
 the views,the sounds and the          
 countryside smells.The disadvantages  
 were,firstly,that there were no shops 
 in our block.The one mentioned most   
 was the chip shop.The lack of clubs   
 for young people was also mentioned,  
 and several pupils said they would    
 like a park or play area nearby. It is
 the case that parents have to drive   
 their children to get to any of these 
 amenities,but the class thought that, 
 on the whole,they would rather live   
 here in Durris than in a town or city.
