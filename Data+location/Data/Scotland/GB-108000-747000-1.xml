		<title>01Crofting community Caolas</title>
		<content> Caolas is a crofting area typical     
 today of dying crofting community.    
 Crofts are mainly used for grazing    
 sheep and cattle with little crops    
 grown. The village houses mostly      
 occupied by elderly people are        
 maintained to high standard. Coastline
 fishing is evident in a very smallway 
 by local crofters. 'Acairseid an Duin'
 is the port for the offshore          
 commercial shell fishing trade        
 comprising mainly lobsters and prawns 
 The harbour which has been subject to 
 tidal conditions is presently         
 undergoing extensive improvement, to  
 facilitate easy access at all times.
