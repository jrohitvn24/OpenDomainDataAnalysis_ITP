		<title>02THE LANDSCAPE OF DALRY(KIRK)</title>
		<content>   This area is a landscape modified by
 man. It is mainly a valley connecting 
 two lochs, Earlstoun, a man-made area 
 of water to the north and Loch Ken    
 with its artificially raised water    
 level in the south .The valley        
 between, is that of a glacially       
 formed infilled trough which is the   
 flood plain of the Water of  Ken.This 
 river flows in a valley one kilometer 
 wide in a series of meanders contained
 within levees which are partly man    
 made. Prone to flooding, this stretch 
 of river has a gradient of no more    
 than 1 in 150. Tributary streams flow 
 into the Ken from the eastern edge of 
 the Rhinns of Kells. The valley       
 sides, made of greywacke cut by       
 dolomite dykes, form gently rounded   
 hills plastered with glacial drift    
 often in the form of drumlins.
