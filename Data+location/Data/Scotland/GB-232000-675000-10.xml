		<content>    Most people in Cardross travel out 
 of Cardross for employment. The       
 majority use private cars, often      
 sharing transport with friends to cut 
 the cost. Cardross is also served by  
 trains and buses. There is a bus      
 running to Helensburgh every 30       
 minutes and one to Glasgow, also every
 30 minutes. The electric train service
 is also adequate, one train running in
 each direction every 30 minutes with  
 more at peak travel time. To make life
 easier, it is necessary to have access
 to private cars.                      
    The main road to Glasgow is a very 
 busy one and divides the village in   
 two.
