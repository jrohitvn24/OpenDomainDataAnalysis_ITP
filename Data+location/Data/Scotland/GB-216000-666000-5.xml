		<title>05THE MODERN SKELMORLIE</title>
		<content>  Local industries such as Inverkip    
 Power Station, Hunterston Ore         
 Terminal, International Business      
 Machines,all expanded about 1965      
 bringing an increase in the local     
 population .Many new houses were built
 in groups or individually and new     
 local authority houses were also      
 built.THe village was now a dormitory 
 village for areas both North and      
 South.                                
  The incoming population was not local
 and brought many new ideas to the     
 community. But the newcomers and older
 residents soon mixed and worked       
 together for the good of the community
  One of the things the village needed 
 was a new school and the villagers    
 petitioned for and were given a new   
 school in 1975.
