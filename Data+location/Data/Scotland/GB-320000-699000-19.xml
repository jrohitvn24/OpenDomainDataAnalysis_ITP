		<content> BUILDINGS ARE USUALLY FARMS OR FARM   
 COTTAGES. FARMHOUSES TEND TO BE LARGE 
 COLD BUILDINGS SO SOME FARMERS HAVE   
 BUILT MODERN INSULATED BUNGALOWS AS   
 REPLACEMENTS. FARM COTTAGES ARE SMALL 
 SO OCCASIONALLY SOME HAVE BEEN JOINED 
 TOGETHER AS LIVING STANDARDS HAVE     
 INCREASED.                            
   OTHER HOUSES CLOSE TO THE ROADS HAVE
 BEEN BOUGHT BY WOULD BE COMMUTERS AND 
 RENOVATED USING LOCAL AUTHORITY GRANTS
   BUILDINGS TEND TO BE OF LOCAL DARK  
 GREY STONE ALTHOUGH SOME FARMHOUSES   
 AND FARM COTTAGES ARE WHITEWASHED.    
 THERE ARE VERY FEW DERELICT BUILDINGS 
 AS THE AREA IS ON THE FRINGES OF      
 GLENROTHES.                           
   NEW FARM BUILDINGS ARE A RESULT OF  
 FARMING PROSPERITY IN THE EEC.LARGE   
 NEW BARNS HAVE CORRUGATED IRON ROOFS &amp;
 SIDES ARE OF 'BREEZE'BLOCK OR BRICK   
 THE FLOORS ARE LAID WITH CONCRETE.    </content>
