		<content>  The Vale of Atholl Pipe band has a   
 long history, but it is only recently 
 that the band has achieved its current
 high standard.                        
  Since Ian Duncan became pipe-major   
 six years ago, the band has risen from
 Grade 4 to promotion in 1981 to Grade 
 1.                                    
  The junior band was formed in 1982,  
 becoming Champions of Grade 4 in 1984.
 In 1985 the Novice Juvenile band was  
 led by an ex-High School pupil,       
 seventeen year old Sharon Walker.     
  The band play at Highland Nights, the
 Highland Games and, of course, in     
 competition. Recently the band has    
 been invited to play at festivals in  
 France, Germany and the U.S.A.        
  The band is based in Pitlochry, but  
 members live all over Britain, with   
 one in Germany. At the moment there   
 six High School pupils in the band.   </content>
