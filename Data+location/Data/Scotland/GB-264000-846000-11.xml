		<content> The hairdresser in Grant Street is    
 William's.William and six ladies work 
 here,some part time.Every week about  
 150 people come to have their hair    
 done while they chat or listen to pop 
 music.                                
 Ladies mostly have a cut and style or 
 a perm.There are special rates for Old
 Age Pensioners.Often they style hair  
 specially to suit a bride's or a      
 bridesmaid's headdress.Little girls   
 come for a shampoo,style and blow dry.
 It is good to have nice sleek hair    
 that falls into shape after you shake 
 your head.Susan can dye or bleach     
 people's hair.Men go to William's too.
 They might have long or short hair cut
 or beards trimmed and styled.         
 Teenagers have quite different styles.
 They have their hair standing out in  
 spikes or shaved to look like a       
 Mohican.Only some though.             </content>
