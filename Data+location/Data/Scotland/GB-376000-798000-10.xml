		<title>10SOCIAL LIFE IN DRUMOAK</title>
		<content> Although Drumoak is a small place     
 there is quite a lot of social        
 activity and forms of recreation for  
 all ages.                             
 On the second Monday of every month   
 there is a meeting of the Women's     
 Rural Institute in the village hall.  
 The hall is also used by bowling and  
 badminton clubs for adults every week.
 On Tuesdays and Thursdays a Pre School
 Playgroup for 3 - 5 year olds meets in
 the mornings. Cubs and Scouts meet    
 every Friday evening in the hall and  
 after they are finished a Bingo Club  
 meets weekly.                         
 Every February there is a community   
 Dinner Dance which is very popular.   
 Groups like the school, playgroup,    
 hall committee hold social activities.
 The local Pub, the Irvine Arms, is    
 open seven days a week.               
                                       </content>
