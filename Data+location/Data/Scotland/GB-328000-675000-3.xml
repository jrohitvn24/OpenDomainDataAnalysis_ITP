 In the middle ages Leith was hit by   
 many plagues. The worst plague it was 
 hit by was the Black Death. Folk      
 got it from the rats that came off the
 ships and then went down into the     
 drains and tunnels and that's where   
 it spread. They would probably        
 get into your house and contaminate   
 the food. There was no cure for it in 
 those days.So that folk knew you had  
 the plague you would draw a red cross 
 on your door.                         
 A man would come round and            
 shout,"Bring out your dead!"          
 There are some plague victims' burial 
 grounds along at the eastern end of   
 Seafield on Leith Links.
