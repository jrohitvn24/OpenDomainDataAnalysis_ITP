		<title>09Sorbie Primary School</title>
		<content>    Sorbie primary{school}is the only{ 
{education}establishment in Sorbie.    
 It had approximately 124 pupils  early
 this century. An attendance officer   
 visited the school twice a week and   
 the school was called Sorbie Public   
 School.Since then the {school roll}has
 fallen dramatically and is now only   
 23. In 1978 there was a threat to     
 close the school because of the small 
 numbers, but this did not happen.     
    In 1982, the Moderator of the      
 Church of Scotland visited us and told
 us about his job, and showed us his   
 special ring.                         
    Every year we take part in the     
 dancing and music{festivals.}We also  
 enter the area sports. At the end of  
 the summer term we go on an outing.   
 This year we are going to the Magnum  
 Sports Centre near Irvine, to go      
 swimming and ice skating.             </content>
