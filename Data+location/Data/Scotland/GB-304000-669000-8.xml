		<title>08THE UNION CANAL</title>
		<content>  The Union Canal was built between    
 1818 and 1822 and stretched 48        
 kilometres from Falkirk to Port       
 Hopetown in Lothian Road, Edinburgh.  
  The canal was built at 70 metres     
 above sea level and it joins the Forth
 and Clyde Canal with a series of locks
 at Camelon. The engineering skills    
 include three aqueducts crossing the  
 Avon, the Almond and the water of     
 Leith and also a 633 metre tunnel near
 Falkirk.                              
  Evidence of former use can be seen in
 various ways  such as in grooves on   
 bridges worn by tow ropes as horses   
 pulled the barges. Mile markers can be
 spotted and former turning points can 
 be seen in Linlithgow and Broxburn.The
 canal is disused although a           
 conservation group are promoting the  
 use of the canal for various          
 recreation purposes.                  </content>
