		<content>  Mr&amp;Mrs Dawson from Stuartfield take  
 the children to school. Joan sets off 
 from home at 8.10am and goes by Old   
 Deer on to the New Pitsligo _ Mintlaw 
 road,then back into Maud to leave the 
 first run at school. Then out on the  
 Maud _ Old Deer road and turns up by  
 Bulwark to collect me at 8.40am,then  
 on over the back up Annieswells and on
 into Maud.She then sets off again for 
 the last run, the little ones that do 
 not go into school till 9.30am.       
   There is also a local service bus   
 run by Alexanders.Buses pass through  
 the village going to Peterhead,       
 Aberdeen and Turiff.But the service   
 has been greatly cut as most people   
 have cars now and do not rely on buses
 so much.Buses also collect senior     
 pupils that attend Mintlaw Academy.
