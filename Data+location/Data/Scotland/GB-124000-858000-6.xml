		<content> Sheep form an important part of the   
 economy of the crofters. Various      
 breeds are kept, such as Cheviot,     
 Suffolk, Blackface and a few Jacobs.  
 The lambs are taken to market in      
 September and October. Some crofters  
 send their sheep to the mainland for  
 wintering,although most are wintered  
 here. Some older animals are          
 slaughtered for home consumption. A   
 few families keep cows,mainly to have 
 a supply of milk for their own use.   
 One or two households keep goats;also 
 for milk. Land is cultivated on a     
 small scale to enable crops like      
 hay, corn and potatoes to be grown.   
 Several people own fishing boats. They
 fish locally for herring, mackerel and
 haddock, when in season. Some also    
 fish for lobsters and crabs.
