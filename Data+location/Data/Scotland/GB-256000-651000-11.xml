		<content> Eaglesham School is in Gilmour Street.
 Most of it is fairly new but there is 
 an old building which was the original
 school but is now used as the dinner  
 hall.There are fourteen classrooms    
 and 360 pupils to fill them up.Each   
 pupil has a uniform.We wear light     
 clothes in summer but all the rest of 
 the year we wear a uniform.The uniform
 consists of a navy blue and yellow    
 striped tie a grey (or white) shirt   
 a grey jumper and grey (or black)     
 trousers and if you are a girl a grey 
 skirt.When we asked the children few  
 of them liked the present school      
 uniform.All of them hated wearing the 
 tie.About half the children wanted a  
 new design of uniform and just under  
 half thought they should wear what    
 they wanted.In the school there are   
 22 members of staff.Out of all the    
 classes their favourite games are     </content>
