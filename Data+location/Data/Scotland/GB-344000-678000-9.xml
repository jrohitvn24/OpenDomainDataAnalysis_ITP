		<title>09THE VILLAGE - Employment</title>
		<content> only limited local employment         
 opportunities e.g. in the local shops,
 hotels and inns, retirement home, the 
 golf club and the nearby farming      
 estates.  Therefore in recent years   
 the village has become very much a    
 "dormer community" despite been a     
 conservation area. This has meant that
 new housing and other development is  
 strictly controlled, and in recent    
 times very little new building has    
 taken place except for "The Gardens". 
                                       
 Halfway down the village street, on   
 the north side,is the venerable Mercat
 Cross, on its plinth of steps.        
 Aberlady was a burgh of barony, and   
 this cross symbolised the fact.  It   
 has lost its cross-finial, presumably 
 at the Reformation.
