		<title>14A Fruit Farm</title>
		<content> Mrs. Peat owns a fruit farm on the    
 main road to Lanark; it is called "The
 Poplars".The farm is a family         
 business; Mrs. Peat is a widow and    
 her daughter helps her. They grow     
 annual flowers, vegetables, and soft  
 and hard fruit.The most popular fruits
 are raspberries and strawberries which
 freeze well. In the summer her day can
 begin at 4.30.a.m.and last until      
 10.p.m. At this time of year, she has 
 schoolchildren to help her with the   
 picking. About February she begins to 
 plant her seeds  for the summer       
 season. In 1961,when she and her      
 husband bought the farm (it was there 
 long before that)the produce was taken
 to be sold at the market.But now lots 
 more people have cars, she can sell   
 everything she grows to passing and   
 regular customers.
