		<content> There are no shops in Garvald, the    
 closest being 5 miles away, therefore 
 the villagers depend to a large degree
 on the twice weekly butchers van and  
 co-op travelling service. We tend to  
 grow our own fruit and vegetables and 
 few people favour tinned foods. There 
 is a hotel in the village which caters
 for breakfast, lunch &amp; evening        
 dinner.Most of the residents shop on  
 a regular basis, though the larger    
 families prefer a monthly shop at one 
 of the many 'super stores' in         
 Edinburgh, where prices are far more  
 competitive than Haddington. Most of  
 the older ladies still have a regular 
 baking session, though this is not so 
 usual among the younger generation.   
 However, nearly all of us are busy    
 during the summer months making jams  
 and chutneys.
