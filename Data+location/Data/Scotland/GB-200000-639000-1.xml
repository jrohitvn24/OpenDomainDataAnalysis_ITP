		<title>01Corrie Burn to Merkland</title>
		<content> This area is a National Scenic Area   
 and much of the land is owned by the  
 National Trust for Scotland.  Coire   
 Lan is in the North, and from here the
 Corie burn flows down to the sea.     
 Alongside the north side of the burn  
 is a foootpath leading to the summit  
 of Goalfell.  Some of the land is     
 owned by the Forestry commission, and 
 the southern slopes of Mool Donn are  
 uder coniferous plantations.  The road
 (A841) runs along the coast and passes
 a very few houses-some of which are   
 set back off the road.  There is also 
 a licenced restaurant - called        
 "Pirates Cove" - and although it is   
 not much frequented by islanders, it  
 is poular with visitors.  There are   
 two main cragy outcrops here, on the  
 northern slopes of both Mool Donn and 
 Meall Breac.  The coastal area is a   
 raised beach.                         </content>
