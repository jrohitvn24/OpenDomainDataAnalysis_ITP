		<content>{YOUNG PEOPLE}                         
 Young people around here are much the 
 same as anywhere else in Britain      
 today.They also like pop              
 records,discos and motor bikes.They   
 also like sports and football.In other
 words they like getting out and about.
        Because ours is a country place
 with very poor transport service.     
 Young people have to have transport to
 get around.We spoke to some young     
 people and they moaned a bit about how
 boring it is around here and one girl 
 thought that people were very nosy,but
 most of them thought life around here 
 was fine and that they'd really not   
 like to live any where else.
