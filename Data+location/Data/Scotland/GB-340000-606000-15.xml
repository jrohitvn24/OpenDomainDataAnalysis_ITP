		<content> BEING A FARMER'S WIFE WITH TWO YOUNG  
 CHILDREN, LIVING IN A LARGE, DRAUGHTY,
 VICTORIAN HOUSE, MUCH OF MY TIME IS   
 SPENT IN &amp; AROUND THE KITCHEN. THANKS 
 TO AN AUTOMATIC WASHING MACHINE       
 PLUMBED IN TO OUR WATER SUPPLY (WHICH 
 COMES FROM A SPRING ON THE HILL), I   
 CAN TACKLE TWO CHORES AT ONCE eg.     
 WASHING &amp; COOKING. A FOOD PROCESSOR &amp; 
 MIXER/LIQUIDISER ARE INVALUABLE AIDS  
 IN FOOD PREPARATION PRIOR TO COOKING  
 OR BAKING IN OR ON OUR 4-OVENED, OIL  
 FIRED AGA - FISH FINGERS GRILLED IN   
 THE HOTTEST OVEN DON'T SMELL!         
 OUR WATER IS HEATED BY AN ANCIENT     
 SOLID FUEL (COKE) BOILER WHICH STANDS 
 IN THE KITCHEN. IT HEATS 3 TOWEL RAILS
 UPSTAIRS. OPEN FIRES IN THE DININGROOM
 DRAWINGROOM &amp; STUDY &amp; ELECTRIC OR     
 CALOR GAS HEATERS ARE OUR ONLY OTHER  
 FORMS OF HEATING. THERMAL UNDERWEAR IS
 ESSENTIAL IN OUR HOUSEHOLD!           </content>
