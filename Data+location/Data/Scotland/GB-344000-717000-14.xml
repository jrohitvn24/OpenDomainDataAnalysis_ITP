		<title>14GUARDBRIDGE HOTEL</title>
		<content> Guardbridge Hotel is a small, pleasant
 establishment that welcomes children  
 and has beds for 8 people when full.  
 It is run by a local couple who       
 employ 2 part-time workers in the     
 evenings.  They receive approximately 
 150 visitors per day through their    
 small pub which is very popular with  
 the locals.  As well as this, they do 
 single meals for non-residents and    
 take bookings in advance.  Although   
 they only advertise occasionally in   
 the St Andrews Citizen, the hotel     
 (which is visible from the main road) 
 gets a lot of trade from passing      
 traffic, especially in their busiest  
 months - June to August.
