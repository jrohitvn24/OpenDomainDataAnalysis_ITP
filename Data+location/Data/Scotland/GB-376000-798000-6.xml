		<content> The main religion of the people of    
 Drumoak is that of the Scottish       
 Protestants - Presbyterianism.        
 The Parish Church was opened in       
 November, 1836, the Rev. Dr. Corbett  
 being the minister of the parish.     
 Today the minister is the Rev. Dr. W. 
 Serle, who lives in the manse on the  
 south side  of the North Deeside Road.
 The adult membership is 279 and 39% of
 the school children attend Sunday     
 School classes.  Roman Catholics and  
 Episcopalians attend churches in      
 nearby Banchory whilst other sects    
 meet in Aberdeen.The self supporting  
 United Free Church closed in 1950's   
 when ownership went back to the laird 
 who wished that the building be used  
 by the local community as a hall.     
 Between 1/3 - 1/4 of the population of
 Drumoak have no church connections.
