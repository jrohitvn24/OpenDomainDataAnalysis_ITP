		<title>09Tourism south: FINTRY</title>
		<content> Overnight and longer stay is offered  
 by both the Clachan and the Fintry    
 Inn. Both serve midday and evening    
 meals.                                
                                       
 Sadly the Youth Hostel, still on some 
 OS maps, closed recently. Visitors    
 wishing to stay are usually           
 accommodated by one of the several    
 farms or private houses offering bed  
 and breakfast.                        
                                       
 The area has many pleasant walks,     
 but stout footwear is usually needed. 
 A booklet of walks is available from  
 the Post Office etc.                  
                                       
 The fishing is popular and licenses   
 can be obtained for several local     
 stretches.
