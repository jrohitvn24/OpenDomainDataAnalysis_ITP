		<content>   50 years ago many people were       
 required to work the farms, so        
 cottages and bothies were built to    
 house the workers.  Now farms are     
 mechanised so the number of labourers 
 is greatly reduced.                   
   People had large families and school
 was well attended in winter, less so  
 in summer since children helped on the
 farms.  Pupils walked to school often 
 in bare feet. The trend now is to have
 small families, so one school replaces
 3; all children have transport        
 provided and have lunch at school.    
   Men often killed a seal and used    
 it's oil rubbed into their boots and  
 horse harnesses to protect the leather
 Now people wear rubber boots for work.
   Horses were used for all heavy work,
 even cows were harnessed to ploughs or
 carts. Now farm machinery has changed 
 all that and cars have replaced carts.</content>
