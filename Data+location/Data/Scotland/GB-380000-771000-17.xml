		<title>17Sheep Farming By Inverbervie</title>
		<content> Mr. Leslie is the Shepherd at Anniston
 Farm where he enjoys looking after two
 hundred and twenty five ewes.         
 Every day in winter he feeds them hay 
 and barley mix. In summer they eat    
 grass.                                
 The busiest time of the year is the   
 lambing season when he works long     
 hours, helped by his wife. This year  
 three hundred and thirty lambs were   
 born. They will be sold when they are 
 about seven months old for about Â£45. 
 The ewes, each worth about Â£35, are   
 kept for breeding.                    
 In June Mr. Leslie shears the sheep   
 and sends the fleeces to Kirkcaldy    
 where they are made into clothing.    
 Apart from "dipping" and "clipping"   
 times, Mr. Leslie works on his own    
 with the help of his two dogs which he
 trained himself.
