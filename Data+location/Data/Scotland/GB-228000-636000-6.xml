		<title>06SCOTRAIL WORKSHOPS</title>
		<content> These workshops have been in existence
 since 1870 approx, and were probably  
 built in Irvine because the town was  
 the only one in the area which had a  
 lot of engineering concerns.          
   Irvine depot provides a base for two
 departments -(1) Civil Engineering,   
 (2) Signal and Telegraph Engineering. 
 The latter department is very         
 important because it is the only      
 Signal and Telegraph equipment        
 workshop in Scotland. They make signal
 posts, signal control boxes, metal    
 boxes, cabinets and cupboards, and    
 repair telephone equipment.           
   At one time many people served four 
 year apprenticeships in the workshops 
 but today there are none.Economies and
 efficiency measures have meant a      
 reduction in numbers of employees     
 (1975 - 70 workers, 1985 - 24         
 workers.)                             </content>
