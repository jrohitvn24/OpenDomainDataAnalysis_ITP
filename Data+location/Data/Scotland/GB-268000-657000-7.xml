		<title>07A DAY IN THE LIFE OF</title>
		<content> Every morning Glenda gets up at       
 quarter past seven, her alarm clock   
 wakes her enabling her to be punctual 
 for her paper run.  School starts at  
 nine o'clock and for Glenda another   
 uneventful day begins.  Recently      
 school has become boring for her as   
 she would rather participate in other 
 activities such as more reading and   
 art. School meals are available at    
 lunch time but she prefers to lunch   
 in the cafe at ASDA.                  
                                       
 Night life in Blantyre is non-existent
 for teenagers, so Glenda visits her   
 friends houses or they come to hers.  
 There is a sports centre which can be 
 expensive and really only caters for  
 the sporty type.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
