		<content> Letham Primary School was built in    
 1890 when it had 2 classrooms divided 
 by a partition.  In 1890 it was       
 modernised and the 2 classrooms made  
 into 1.  A small library and toilets  
 were added.

 farms 6.                              
 Their means of transport is as        
 follows:                 16 walk; 10  
 use the school bus and 8 come in      
 private cars.                         
 There are 2 full time teachers and a  
 part-time teaching auxiliary.
