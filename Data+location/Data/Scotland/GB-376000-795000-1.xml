 Our block is situated in the hills    
 above the Dee Valley, about thirteen  
 miles west of the city of Aberdeen in 
 North East Scotland. It is an area of 
 low hills,farmland and forests,with   
 the River Dee flowing west to east    
 through the block. There are no       
 villages or towns,just one or two     
 small hamlets and two recently        
 built housing developments near the   
 primary school,as well as scattered   
 older cottages and farms.Employment   
 is generally in farming or forestry,  
 although most people now commute into 
 Aberdeen and many work in oil related 
 industry.The people enjoy the country 
 landscape with its fine views and     
 wildlife,but there are few amenities  
 and no shops,and so for everything    
 they need, people must travel by car  
 to the nearby towns.                  </content>
