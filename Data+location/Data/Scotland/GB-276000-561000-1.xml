		<content> Surrounded by rich, gently-rolling    
 farmland, Castle-Douglas has long been
 a market centre. Its present          
 flourishing cattle market is more than
 a century old and is still a main     
 centre for sales of Ayrshire and      
 Galloway cattle.                      
 It is fortunate in having Carlingwark 
 Loch and its shores as a civic park,  
 which now includes a large caravan    
 site. Boating, golf, tennis and       
 fishing are available on the spot.    
 Castle-Douglas is regarded as the     
 commercial capital of the district,   
 and it won a Saltire Society award in 
 1962 for its enterprise
