		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> The main built up area  in our block  
 is the village of Balloch.We also take
 in part of Culloden.The Culloden area 
 has been built only in the last few   
 years and the building is still       
 continuing.The rest of our area is    
 made of farm land and forestry. There 
 are some crofts in our area but many  
 of the crofts have been joined        
 together to form farms and others are 
 being de- crofted and will in the     
 future be ordinary houses.Few people  
 work in our area and most of the      
 people who live here work either in   
 Inverness or Ardersier where          
 Macdermotts make oil production       
 platforms.The railway line to         
 Edinburgh runs through our area and   
 also the A96 which is the main road to
 Aberdeen.
