		<content> When I first looked at Cargilfield I  
 thought it was unattractive.Once I got
 inside,I realised how lovely it was.  
 They have a sweet little chapel and a 
 cool swimming pool. There are lots of 
 sports such as cricket, athletics,    
 hockey, rugby and golf. The school is 
 beautifully furnished and the dorms   
 are quite tidy. The Headmaster has    
 been there for seven years. his room  
 has a lovely big sofa. If the children
 want a book, they can get one from the
 library. There are many computers in  
 the school for the children to use.   
 They can also learn French,Latin and  
 Greek. The teachers are very friendly 
 and helpful.There are 117 children at 
 the school and usually only 12        
 children in a class. The children are 
 nice but some of them really miss     
 their parents. Altogether it is a     
 lovely school. I felt very welcome.{  </content>
