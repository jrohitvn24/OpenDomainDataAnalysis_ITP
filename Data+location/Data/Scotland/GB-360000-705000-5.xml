		<content> The name Crail comes from 'Carr'- a   
 fortified place, and 'Ail'- corner.   
 Literally the 'Fort on the Corner'.   
 The sculptured stone of Sauchope in   
 Victoria Gardens, is an early         
 Christian relic.  Street names- like  
 'Gaits' (roads) and 'wynds'(lanes)    
 tell of bygone days.  The Tolbooth is 
 16th century with the belfry added    
 later.  It contains a fine Dutch bell,
 confirming Crail's trade links with   
 the Continent.  The shaft of the      
 Mercat Cross is 17th century.  The    
 Kirk of St. Mary, consecrated in      
 1243, has been altered and extended   
 over the years.  The most recent      
 renovation was in 1963.  The          
 Preservation Society, founded in 1957,
 has accomplished much in retaining the
 character of Crail.  A Museum is      
 growing in interest and value, thanks 
 to many gifts and bequests.           </content>
