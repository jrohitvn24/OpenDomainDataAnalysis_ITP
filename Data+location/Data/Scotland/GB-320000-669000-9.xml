		<content>  Now I'm here and I go to school every
 day.I also go to Chinese school on    
 Saturdays.At home I help my sister    
 with the housework.My Dad works in a  
 take-away,and he gets a day off on    
 Mondays.I miss my Gran a lot.My little
 brother doesn't even know what our    
 Gran looks like.Sometimes my Gran     
 sends pictures of her and her friends 
 and my little brother will ask which  
 one of these women is my Gran.I       
 wouldn't really like to live in       
 Vietnam now.I would like my Gran to   
 come here and live with us.Mostly I   
 think of my Gran before I go to sleep.
 I dream I am on "This Is Your Life"   
 and then a big surprise for me - my   
 Gran comes along and I get to give her
 a big hug.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
