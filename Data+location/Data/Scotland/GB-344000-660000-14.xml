		<content> CONCERTS,WHIST DRIVES AND DANCES ARE  
 HELD OCCASIONALLY IN THE VILLAGE HALL.
 THERE ARE REGULAR KEEP FIT CLASSES AND
 THE W.R.I.AND GUILD ARE HELD MONTHLY.A
 MOTHER AND TODDLER GROUP MEETS ONCE A 
 WEEK.THIS WAS FORMERLY A PLAYGROUP BUT
 THERE ARE NO LONGER ENOUGH OLDER      
 CHILDREN.THIS MEANS THAT THE GROUP NO 
 LONGER RECEIVES A GRANT.UNFORTUNATELY 
 THERE IS NOTHING FOR CHILDREN AND     
 TEENAGERS TO DO IN THE EVENINGS.SOME  
 OF US GO SWIMMING AND OTHERS ARE      
 LEARNING GYMNASTICS AND JUDO BUT SUCH 
 ACTIVITIES ARE HELD OUTSIDE OUR       
 SQUARE.THIS MEANS THAT CHILDREN WHO   
 DON'T HAVE TRANSPORT CAN'T JOIN IN AND
 OUR PARENTS NEED TO DRIVE US AS THE   
 BUS SERVICE IS VERY POOR.
