		<content>{Farrochie Farm }is a{dairy farm} on   
 the outskirts of Stonehaven (grid     
 ref.856863).The farm is 170 acres and 
 is tenanted by Mr David Martin whose  
 family have run the business for many 
 years.                                
 The farm has 110 dairy cattle and has 
 been affected by the construction of  
 the Stonehaven bypass which has split 
 the land in two and resulted in a     
 necessary move from the 100year old   
 buildings to the east of the bypass to
 a new dairy,with a grant aid,on the   
 west side.A new farmhouse was also    
 constructed.All the land on the east  
 will eventually be used for housing.  
 The main landuse of the farm is       
 pasture.The land is also used for     
 silage and barley.
