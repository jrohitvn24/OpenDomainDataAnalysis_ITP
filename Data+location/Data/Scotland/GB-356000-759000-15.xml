		<title>15SCOUTING IN BRECHIN</title>
		<content> After 75 years of scouting in Brechin 
 the scout hall in Bank Street suffers 
 badly from both wet and dry           
 rot.Recently a new site has been found
 for a new hall in Damacre Road.       
 Building plans have been drawn up and 
 75% of the total cost of Â£24000 has   
 been raised through grants and the    
 present scouts are trying to raise the
 rest of the funds. A few years ago the
 group was expanded to include a Beaver
 colony of 24  and a Venture unit of   
 12. The Scout troop has 27 members and
 there are Cub packs of 36 and 27. Each
 section has its individual programmes,
 leaders, activities and meetings which
 are held once a week. The whole group 
 sometimes combine for special         
 occasions such as camps in the Angus  
 Glens or day visits to   Ice Rinks,   
 Airports, Army Barracks and           
 Observatories.                        </content>
