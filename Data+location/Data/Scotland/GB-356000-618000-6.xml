		<title>06DENHOLM TREK</title>
		<content> The Denholm trek is a walk around and 
 through the village and was prepared  
 by the primary school.Post one is a   
 view of the Teviot and it's flood     
 plain and the old supports of the     
 suspension bridge.The post two view is
 in the village and is a view of       
 Leydens cottage and other buildings   
 like the Text House and West gate Hall
 and the old Stocking Mill.Leydens     
 cottage is thatched.Murrys house is   
 where the knitwear shop now is.Murry  
 wrote a dictionary and is famous.There
 is a monument to Dr John Leyden on the
 green.The church in the village was   
 built in 1844.In the main street there
 are five houses joined together to    
 help smugglers escape.So the story    
 goes.
