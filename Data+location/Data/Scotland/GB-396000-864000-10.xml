		<title>10The Lifeboat, Fraserburgh</title>
		<content>   By the summer of 1985 a public      
 appeal had raised the{Â£430,000}needed 
 to purchase the new{Tyne class        
 lifeboat{"The City of Edinburgh"}for  
 Fraserburgh. During the fund-raising  
 many groups contributed to the cost of
 particular items of the boat's        
 equipment, Â£79,000 was raised locally 
 and most of the rest in Edinburgh.    
   The{"Havelock"}was Fraserburgh's    
 first lifeboat entered in 1858. Three 
 Broch lifeboats have been lost in     
 service, the most recent being the    
{"Duchess of Kent"}with a loss 5 out of
 a crew of 6 in 1970.                  
   The lifeboat shed is in the North   
 Harbour Basin and the current         
 Fraserburgh lifeboat is the{"R.Hope   
{Roberts",}a{Solent class}boat.This    
 boat was built for{Â£72,000}in 1969 and
 came to Fraserburgh in 1979.
