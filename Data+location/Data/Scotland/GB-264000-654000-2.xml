		<content> EAST KILBRIDE AND THE CHURCH.         
     Most of our population belong to  
 the {CHURCH OF SCOTLAND,}our country's
 National Church,and are of Protestant 
 faith.Our local congregation meet in  
 CLAREMONT CHURCH,which was built in   
 1971.A church of the same name existed
 in GLASGOW,but due to members moving  
 out to overspill areas such as East   
 Kilbride,it was forced to close its   
 doors.The money made from its sale was
 given to a small congregation in East 
 Kilbride to build a new church for a  
 new community.It was suitably named   
 Claremont Church and now has a member 
 ship of 2000.                         
 Mr Steven,the minister at the church, 
 visits our school once every two weeks
 to talk to us about JESUS and how we  
 should follow his example.At the end  
 of school term our whole school visits
 the church for a thanksgiving service.</content>
