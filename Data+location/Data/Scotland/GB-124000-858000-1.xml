		<title>01Waternish, Isle of Skye</title>
		<content> Waternish is a peninsula in the       
 North-West of Skye. It is basically a 
 crofting community. Most local        
 inhabitants are part time crofters.   
 There is insufficent arable land to   
 justify full time crofting. Nowadays  
 very few grain crops are grown. It is 
 more ecconomical to buy supplies of   
 animal feed during the Winter. Most   
 householders do grow vegetables,mainly
 potatoes,for their own personal       
 use. The land is more suited for      
 hillfarming;namely sheep rather than  
 cattle. Some is used by the Forestry  
 Commission for growing trees. We have 
 none of the facilities larger         
 communities take for granted;         
 shops,buses,banks. The land was       
 originally part of Waternish Estate,  
 which has gradually been sold off,    
 piecemeal to land speculators.
