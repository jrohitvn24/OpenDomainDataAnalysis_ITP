		<title>01BLINKBONNY AND LONGYESTER</title>
		<content> The hill foots on the Lammermuirs     
 slope from south to north of this     
 block. The hills are heather covered  
 with a very impressive hill fort, its 
 ramparts easily identified. The       
 valleys are covered with gorse.       
 Blinkbonny Wood is a coniferous       
 woodland on a north facing slope and  
 dominates the area. Sheep graze on the
 higher land but the major use is      
 arable farming. The farms are         
 seperated by woodland shelter belts.  
 Longyester has its original           
 stone-built steading but a recent     
 addition is the massive circular grain
 dryer towering over the old farm      
 buildings. The primary school at the  
 road junction to the east of          
 Longyester now lies derelict and the  
 children now travel to Gifford. The   
 only bus to serve the area is a       
 private post bus.                     </content>
