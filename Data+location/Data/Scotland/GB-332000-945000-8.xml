		<title>08Highlights of the Year</title>
		<content> The first hightlight of the year for  
 me is New Year's day. New Year is a   
 fresh calendar year starting on Jan.  
 1st.We don't do any first footing     
 because we have a nice dinner but at  
 night it is even better because I get 
 to see most of my relations that live 
 in Caithness.Another highlight is the 
 summer fete.It is good because there  
 are games,raffles,horse rides and lots
 of fun.Then in July come the summer   
 holidays,usually lasting six weeks.I  
 can help on the croft,play football,  
 cycle,explore the countryside and go  
 to the playing fields with my friends.
 At the end of Oct. is Hallowe'en when 
 we go to each house telling funny     
 stories and jokes and in return get   
 sweets,toffee apples,crisps and money.
 Xmas is the last highlight. I get lots
 of presents and go to parties at      
 school and in the village hall.       </content>
