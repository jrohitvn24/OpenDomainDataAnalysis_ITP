		<title>16HOUSING IN LEUCHARS</title>
		<content> There are a variety of house types in 
 Leuchars.  This is partly due to the  
 fact that the original village of     
 Leuchars has been expanded to         
 accommodate the work of the RAF Base. 
 In the older part of the town - Main  
 Street and School Hill are privately  
 owned and terraced, the remainder are 
 semi-detached.  There were no detached
 houses nor any bungalows.  In the     
 newer part of the town such as St     
 Bunyans, Ferns Place, and most of the 
 RAF streets, the houses belonging to  
 the officers tend to be detached or   
 semi-detached, while those belonging  
 to the lower ranks are mainly         
 terraced.  This area differs from the 
 old part of the town due to the       
 gardens and open space.
