		<title>05CRAIGLEITH QUARRY,EDINBURGH.</title>
		<content> A hundred years ago there was a       
 working quarry at Craigleith.Hard     
 good quality sandstone of several     
 different shades was mined here. The  
 quarry was two hundred feet deep and  
 part of the floor of the quarry was   
 filled with deep water. Horses and    
 carts were used to haul the stones up 
 the steep track out of the quarry.    
                                       
  When shaped by the masons the stones 
 were transported from the quarry by   
 rail,either to Leith dock or to town. 
 Some was used to build the{New Town.} 
 Two large pillars of Edinburgh        
 University are from the quarry and    
 even some parts of Buckingham Palace  
 are faced with Craigleith stone.The   
 supply of sandstone gradually ran out 
 and the quarry has now been filled in.
