		<content> Children's games vary from age to age 
 and place to place.  Here are two of  
 the favourite games played in our     
 area.                                 
    FIREBALL is a game played by around
 twelve or more players, who stand in a
 large circle.  A ball is thrown round 
 the circle.  Whenever anybody drops   
 the ball they must run all the way    
 round the circle and back to their    
 place, while the ball continues to be 
 thrown round the circle.  If, when the
 player who dropped the ball is still  
 running round the circle, the ball    
 is bounced in his or her place, that  
 person is out.  This is continued     
 until only one person is left.  That  
 person is the winner.
