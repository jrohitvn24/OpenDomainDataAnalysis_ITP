		<title>18DEVILMENT NIGHT</title>
		<content> The 31st of October,Hallow'een, is    
 usually called{devilment night,}for   
 children go around doing devilment    
 -putting sticky mixtures on doors &amp;   
 windows &amp; esp.on the school;and on    
 cars.Air is let out of car tyres;signs
 are moved around to point the wrong   
 way or are shifted somewhere else, as 
 are 'movable'things such as gates,    
 barrows etc. Sometimes people are tied
 in their houses. The next morning     
 sometimes people have to clean up or  
 go and find what is missing but if no 
 damage has been done they do not      
 usually mind. Children watch out for  
 patrolling police who want to ensure  
 that no serious damage is done.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
