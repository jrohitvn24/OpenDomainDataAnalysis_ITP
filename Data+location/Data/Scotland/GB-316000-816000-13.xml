		<content> Although Tomintoul is a small village,
 the shopping facilities are very good.
  There are four main shops, two of    
 which have been in the same family for
 a number of generations.  These shops 
 not only sell food and general        
 house-hold and fancy goods but also   
 cater for the many tourists who visit 
 ,ur village in the summer and during  
 the ski-ing season.  John Ross's      
 "Spar", Iain Birnie's "Mace" shops and
 Campbell's Corner Store all have      
 off-licences.  The fourth shop is a   
 general store, newsagent and post     
 office combined.  There is also a     
 Butcher's Shop in the village.  Many  
 people travel to Elgin or Inverness   
 for major shopping expeditions.
