		<title>14TRANSPORT AROUND HOWNAM</title>
		<content> There is no public transport in the   
 area round Hownam in the Scottish     
 Borders, so between the 12 resident   
 families there are 17 cars, 4 land-   
 rovers and 1 motorbike, and all but   
 4 of the adults can drive.Providing   
 your own transport is essential for   
 larger items of shopping,though the   
 community is well served for every-day
 needs.The Post Office at Hownam sells 
 crisps,lemonade and cigarettes,and    
 throughout the week a baker,fishmonger
 butcher and grocer call at all the    
 houses.Milk is delivered for those who
 require it,as although only 1 milk cow
 is now kept in the area,goats are     
 becoming more popular, and 6 are at   
 present being used for milk.There is  
 now no school at Hownam,and of the 10 
 children,2 go to boarding school,and  
 the rest travel daily 4 or 11 miles by
 school bus to receive education.      </content>
