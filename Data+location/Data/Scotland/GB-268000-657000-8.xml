		<title>08HEALTH CENTRE FIRE</title>
		<content> During the early hours of Monday 12th 
 January 1981,{Blantyre Health Centre  
 burned down to the ground. The fire   
 was reported between 3 or 4am.  Fire  
 engines rushed to the scene and had   
 put it out before 5.30am.  The fire   
 was so intense, the firemen were      
 forced to wear protective clothing and
 use breathing apparatus.              
                                       
 The damage was very bad. Everything   
 was completely destroyed except the   
 safe. This caused lots of problems for
 staff and patients. By 10 o'clock, the
 doctors had started consulting in the 
 old clinic. Due to loss of records it 
 was difficult to prescribe medicine.  
 The porta-cabins were very unhygenic, 
 overcrowded and very inconvenient.    
 It took a long time to replace records
                                       
                                       </content>
