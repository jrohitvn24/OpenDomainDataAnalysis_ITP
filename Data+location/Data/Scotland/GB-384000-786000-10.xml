		<title>10Computers in Schools</title>
		<content> In the 1970's there was a slow        
 introduction of computers into        
 schools. Popular Machines were the    
 Apple, Sinclair Spectrum and the BBC. 
 Departments which got the machines    
 were those that showed most interest  
 in their potential use. Thus the      
 dpartments of Maths, Geography,       
 Chemistry, Physics received some of   
 the first hardware. Software was the  
 problem. Who would write the programs?
 The teachers? But when? Some working  
 parties were set up and slowly        
 software appeared most programs were  
 less than 48K sadly there were only   
 one or two machines per department    
 (except maths) and so the use of      
 computers was limited to really keen  
 staff only. The use of chalk, talk the
 overhead projector and slides/film    
 strips remained as the main teaching  
 aids.                                 </content>
