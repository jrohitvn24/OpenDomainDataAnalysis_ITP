		<content> Loch Crinan West of Lochgilphead.     
 The Crinan area is situated on the    
 west coast of Argyll about 10-15 miles
 west of Lochgilphead. Loch Crinan is a
 sandy and rocky estuary which provides
 shelter for sailing craft and         
 trawlers. Crinan is a small village   
 that contains a large hotel, cafe,    
 chandlery and boat yard.  It is also  
 the start of the Crinan Canal that    
 runs to Ardrishaig, thereby cutting   
 short a very long sea journey round   
 the Mull of Kintyre. It is heavily    
 forested on the hills behind Crinan,  
 planted mostly by the Forestry        
 Commission.                           
 Duntrune castle stands to the north of
 Loch Crinan. It is very old nd        
 inhabited by the owner of te estae.   
 Mostly used for sheep farming.        
 In the summer, the whole area is busy 
 with tourists,particularly Crinan     </content>
