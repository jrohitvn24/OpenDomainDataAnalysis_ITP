		<content> THE BIGGEST CHANGE AROUND WHITSOME IS 
 THAT THERE ARE FEWER PEOPLE NOW.   THE
 FARMS USED TO EMPLOY MANY WORKERS.    
 HORSES USED TO WORK THE FIELDS BUT    
 WITH TRACTORS, MILKING MACHINES AND   
 MICRO COMPUTER, ONE MAN CAN DO THE    
 WORK OF MANY.   THE SCHOOL HAD THREE  
 TEACHERS AND OVER 100 PUPILS 80 YEARS 
 AGO.   NOW IT HAS ONE TEACHER AND NINE
 PUPILS AND IS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE.
   THE VILLAGE HAD NO ELECTRICITY OR   
 PROPER DRAINAGE TILL 40 YEARS AGO.    
 PARAFFIN LAMPS WERE USED AND WATER    
 CAME FROM THE TWO VILLAGE WELLS.      
 THERE WERE ONCE THREE JOINER'S SHOPS, 
 A BLACKSMITH AND A PETROL PUMP.   NOW 
 ALL HAVE GONE.   THERE ARE SOME NEW   
 BUNGALOWS AND COUNCIL HOUSES BUT VERY 
 FEW YOUNG PEOPLE LIVE HERE.   MOST    
 SERVICES AND AMENITIES ARE AT DUNS,   
 CHIRNSIDE OR BERWICK. THERE ARE ONLY  
 TWO BUSES A DAY SO PEOPLE USE CARS.   </content>
