		<content> THIS 12SQ.KM. LIES TO THE SOUTH OF    
 EDINBURGH. IT IS A RURAL AREA WITH A  
 VARIED AND INTERESTING LANDSCAPE.     
 WITHIN THE AREA ARE THREE VILLAGES,   
 THE LARGEST OF WHICH IS PATHHEAD      
 THEREFORE  WE HAVE CHOSEN TO GO INTO  
 LIFE IN PATHHEAD IN MUCH MORE DETAIL  
 THAN THE OTHERS. THE OTHER VILLAGES   
 ARE EDGEHEAD AND DEWARTON. THE AREA   
 ALSO HAS A NATIONAL PARK WHICH        
 ATTRACTS A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THE AREA. 
 THERE ARE ALSO TO LARGE HOUSES;       
 OXENFOORD CASTLE, WHICH IS NOW A      
 PRIVATE GIRLS BOARDING SCHOOL AND     
 PRESTON HALL WHICH IS THE SEAT OF THE 
 CALLANDER FAMILY. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO 
 COVER EVERYTHING IN THIS SHORT PIECE  
 BUT WE HAVE TRIED TO COVER SOME THINGS
 WHICH WE THINK OTHERS MAY FIND        
 INTERSTING.
