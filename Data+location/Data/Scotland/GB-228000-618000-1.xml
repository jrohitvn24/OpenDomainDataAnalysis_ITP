		<title>01Doonfoot &amp; The Heads of Ayr</title>
		<content> The area just SW of Ayr is mainly     
 farmland.   The agriculture is        
 predominantly dairy.   Much of the    
 coast is rocky with sandy bays, which 
 in the summer attracts holidaymakers. 
 There is a Butlins Holiday Camp which 
 lies on the coast, between Greenan    
 Castle &amp; the Heads of Ayr.   It has a 
 capacity of 7000 people &amp; has an      
 average of 4000 per week.   It has    
 many facilities but is only open 19   
 weeks of the year.   This camp is well
 hidden &amp; is only really obvious from  
 the sea.   The Heads of Ayr is a      
 promintory &amp; is a local landmark.   It
 has its own caravan site, with a few  
 facilities.   To the extreme east of  
 the area is Doonfoot, a residential   
 part of Ayr.   It consistys of modern 
 housing development &amp; is still        
 expanding.   It includes a large,     
 modern primary school.                </content>
