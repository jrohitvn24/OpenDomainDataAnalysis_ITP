 In Hill of Beath Main Street there is 
 an Ex-Serviceman's Club.In our club   
 people go to play bingo and they win  
 money and prizes.Every Sunday night   
 people come to watch the cabaret and  
 the terrific band.Sometimes people who
 are engaged show their presents in the
 club.Most people have memberships     
 which they pay once a year.Sometimes  
 the committee organises discos for    
 adults.There are 12 members on the    
 committee.The contest for the gala    
 queen was held there in June 1985.18  
 girls went in for it and it was judged
 by our local headmaster,his wife and  
 the minister.
