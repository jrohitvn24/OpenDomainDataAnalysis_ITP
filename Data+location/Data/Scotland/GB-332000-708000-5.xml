		<title>05Pitlessie School</title>
		<content> Pitlessie Primary occupies a central  
 position in the village. It is an old 
 building with schoolhouse adjoining.  
 There has been a school on the site   
 since 1700 although the original      
 building was a very much smaller one  
 than the one standing today.          
 44 pupils attend the school and these 
 are divided into two classes. The     
 younger class of P1-P4 is taught by   
 Mrs.Welsh.The headteacher Mrs.Pratt   
 teaches the older class P5-P7         
 The school has a close-knit family    
 atmosphere and has strong links with  
 the village community.Several events  
 are organised each session involving  
 parents local people and pupils and   
 the recent formation of a parent-     
 teacher association has proved very   
 successful.
