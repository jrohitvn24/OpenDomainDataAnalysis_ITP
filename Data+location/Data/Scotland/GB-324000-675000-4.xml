		<content> The area surveyed by Fettes College   
 includes the suburbs of Trinity,      
 Goldenacre and Wardie and extends to  
 the Firth of Forth at Lower Granton   
 Road.  The area is mainly {residential
 but a significant part of the district
 is given over to residential          
 facilities.  On Lower Granton Road are
 a series of builders, plumbers and    
 electricians.                         
 The {Granton}area was developed by the
 Dukes of Buccleugh who built a harbour
 for the export of coal from their     
 mines.  The harbour also used to be a 
 ferry port for Fife but is now used   
 entirely for recreational purposes.   
{Trinity}was built on a plateau over-  
 :looking the Forth in the late 18th   
 and early 19th centuries.  Many houses
 here are large and some original plots
 have been subdivided to allow more    
 buildings to be built.                </content>
