		<content>{ Crofters}in this area rarely work the
 ground apart from planting a potato   
 crop and cutting hay in the Autumn to 
 feed their animals.  The majority of  
 them keep a few sheep , only a few    
 have any cattle, goats. Hens are      
 useful for eggs due to the distance   
 from shops.                           
   Sheep are{dipped }two or three times
 and clipped in June or July. Every    
 year sheep or lambs are gathered and  
 put into{fanks}(pens).They are then   
 sorted and taken by lorry to {Dingwall
 or{Lairg Auctions.}A good price for   
 a hog(one year old) would be around   
 Â£40. Usually the wether (male) lambs  
 are sold keeping the ewe lambs for    
 breeding in later years.              
   Sheep in lamb need extra feeding in 
 the harsh winter conditions. A good   
{Collie dog}is an asset to any crofter.
