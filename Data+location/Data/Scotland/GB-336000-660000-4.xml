   It took about ten minutes to get    
 to Borthwick.                         
   We set off from the graveyard which 
 was just opposite Borthwick castle.We 
 had to walk about one and a half miles
 over fields,up steep hills and across 
 marshes.I was all muddy and wet when  
 we arrived.At this time of year we    
 would normally have to pay to get into
 the castle but we were allowed a look 
 at it for free.                       
   The whole class couldn't all fit    
 in the mini bus so Michelle,Hazel and 
 I all stayed behind with Mr Ross.     
   I returned home for my dinner and   
 changed my socks and shoes.In the     
 afternoon four people worked with Mr  
 Wright and did some work on the       
 Domesday Project.The bell rang at     
 3.20pm.It had been an interesting day.</content>
