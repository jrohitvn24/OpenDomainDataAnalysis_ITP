		<title>19A CHILD'S SATURDAY, LIMERIGG</title>
		<content> There is no school at the weekend so  
 on Saturdays I don't get up until     
 between half-past eight and half-past 
 nine. I dress at ten o'oclock and I   
 watch television until 11.30am. Then I
 go down to my gran's,because my mum is
 out collecting milk money from        
 customers in Slamannan. When my mum   
 finishes,she comes to my gran's where 
 she counts the money and has her      
 lunch. At about 3.30pm. my mum,gran   
 and myself go to Falkirk which is a   
 large town about 11km. from Limerigg. 
 We go there every Saturday. We go to  
 many of the shops including the       
 supermarkets. We return home about    
 5.30pm. then we have our dinner at my 
 gran's. Two hours later we go home to 
 our own house and I watch the         
 television until it is supper time.   
 Then I make the tea for my mum and    
 afterwards I go to bed.               </content>
