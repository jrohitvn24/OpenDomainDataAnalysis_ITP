		<title>15Ecology - Migrating Birds</title>
		<content> Birds which pass through the Isle of  
 May fly to parts of the world. For    
 example a Kittiwake ringed as a chick 
 was recovered in Newfoundland the     
 following year. A Robin has been      
 recorded as taking only 6days to fly  
 from the May to Holland, while a      
 goldcrest flew from Finland in        
 seventeen days.                       
 Ringing returns also yeild useful data
 about the age that birds attain in the
 wild, about details of their breeding 
 sites and about their world           
 distribution. It is this kind of      
 information, accumulated over many    
 years by amateur ornothologists and   
 added to each season, which makes the 
 Isle of May observatory such a        
 valuable research site for the        
 avifauna of Western Europe.
