		<title>08CRIME IN PAISLEY</title>
		<content> Situated in the west of Scotland,     
 Paisley's crime rate is steadily      
 increasing.  There are a number of    
 reasons for this, the main ones being 
 the increase in alcoholism, drugs     
 abuse and glue sniffing.  The use of  
 drugs is the most worrying of         
 these problems as addicts are driven  
 to great lenghths to fund their hab-  
 bit, leading to an increase in theft  
 and burglaries. This lack of money and
 amenities in problem areas such as    
 Ferguslie Park can lead to other prob-
 lems such as discontent which can lead
 to vandalism, thus leading to more    
 crime.                                
 Policing these areas is difficult.    
 Special community involvement prog-   
 rammes are being set up to combat     
 crime, but lack of funds and the      
 difficult task mean that not enough is
 being put into these programmes.      </content>
