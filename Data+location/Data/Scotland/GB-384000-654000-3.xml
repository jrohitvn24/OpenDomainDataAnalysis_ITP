		<title>03HOUSING IN ALLANTON</title>
		<content> To the south of Chirnside lies the    
 village of Allanton with a population 
 of about 100. Most of the houses in   
 Allanton are privately owned as there 
 are only 4 council houses. A few new  
 bungalows were built in 1980. The     
 houses in Allanton were erected for   
 workers from the Blackadder Estate    
 which employed stonemasons,           
 carpenters, slaters and general       
 labourers to build the houses. Now    
 these houses are nearly all occupied  
 by elderly people but 6 are used as   
 holiday homes. The school closed in   
 the early 1930s. Then alterations were
 made and it was turned into the       
 village hall. This, combined with the 
 closure of many shops _ there were    
 several tailors _ has resulted in a   
 decline in the population.
