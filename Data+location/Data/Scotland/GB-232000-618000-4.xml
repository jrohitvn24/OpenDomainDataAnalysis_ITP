		<title>04 FAMILY LIFE IN SOUTH-AYR</title>
		<content>   Most families consist of Mum and    
 Dad and 2 children. Many houses are   
 detached with gardens and a           
 garage. About half of the families run
 2 cars. Most go on holiday at least   
 once a year. Half go abroad. Of those 
 who stay in Britain renting a house is
 most popular and favourite places are 
 the Highlands and Cornwall.           
   Weekends are spent shopping,        
 gardening, going car runs, picnics,   
 sailing and visiting. Many Dads play  
 golf and watching T.V. is popular.    
   A varied diet is enjoyed. This      
 includes meat, fish, fruit and        
 vegetables and some convenience foods.
   Fathers mostly work locally-but many
 travel abroad in the course of their  
 job. Most are professional men.       
   Only a sixth of Mums work full time.
 Most households have pets.
