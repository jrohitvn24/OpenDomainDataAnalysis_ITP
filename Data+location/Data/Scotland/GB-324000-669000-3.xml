		<title>03WILDLIFE IN SOUTH EDINBURGH</title>
		<content>  The SOUTH EDINBURGH area is not very 
 well known for its wildlife as much as
 it is for its upmarket residential    
 areas.People don't realize how much of
 it there is. For example the Braid &amp;  
 Hermitage is full of wildlife with    
 some people even seeing foxes.        
{Rabbits}are probably the most common  
 animal around these parts. Sometimes  
 you may see an unusual bird or animal 
 such as goldcrest. The{grey squirrel }
 is another common animal that lives   
 around here - you will hardly ever see
 a red squirrel. Coots and moorhens as 
 well as ducks and geese live on the   
 few ponds in the area. Gulls gather in
 large numbers on the Filter Beds for  
 the water supply.                     
 With its hills, golf courses and woods
 there are plenty of good places for   
 wildlife to exist yet be seen by us   
 city folk.                            </content>
