		<title>04BOYD'S CRANEBUILDERS,ANNAN</title>
		<content> Recently the town of Annan received   
 the bad news that{John Boyd's}the     
 cranebuilders were to be shut down.   
 The firm was founded by John Boyd     
 in 1947.It played an important part in
 the life of Annan,employing 150       
 people.                               
 In 1965 the works were merged with    
 Wellman Engineering Corporation Ltd.  
 In 1969 Clarke Chapman's took over and
 it was incorporated into the NEI      
 group.Because of the high standard of 
 workmanship,the original name was     
 kept.                                 
 Unfortunately the NEI group decided   
 that it was uneconomical to keep{John 
{Boyd's}open.Office staff are to be    
 transferred to Cowan Sheldon,         
 Carlisle.Unfortunately 105 workers are
 to be made redundant.This is bad news 
 for Annan,a town with 20%             
 unemployment.                         </content>
