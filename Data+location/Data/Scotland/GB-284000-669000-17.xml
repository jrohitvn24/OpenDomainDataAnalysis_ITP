 Black Loch,Limerigg,Slamannan. This   
 sport started in 1953 when Dr.Ian     
 Arthur brought his speedboat back from
 the South of France. The sport was    
 later taken up at Lochearnhead and    
 other lochs throughout Scotland,but   
 the centre for advanced skiing and for
 the main water ski competitions in    
 Scotland is at the Black Loch. The    
 Scottish overall water ski champion is
 John Arthur who has held the title    
 for 12 years. Melanie Chambers,who    
 holds the woman's title,is also a     
 a member of the Slamannan Water Ski   
 Club. Other members of the Scottish   
 team ski at the Black Loch. The club  
 has the use of 4 Boesch ski boats     
 which are specially designed for      
 water skiing. These boats are fitted  
 with 260 b.h.p.engines which are      
 necessary to maintain a steady pull.  </content>
