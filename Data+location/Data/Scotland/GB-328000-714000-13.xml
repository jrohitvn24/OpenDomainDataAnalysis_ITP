		<title>13Cunnoquhie - By Letham.</title>
		<content> Cunnoquhie is the only estate in our  
 square.   It extends to 1100 acres and
 comprises 3 farms - Cunnoquhie Mill,  
 Countyhall and Collairnie and a total 
 of 10 houses. One of the farms is now 
 rented.  Two houses are privately     
 owned and 4 are rented, 26 people live
 on the estate.                        
 Once there were around 20 people      
 working on the estate; nowadays there 
 are 6, with extra help when it is     
 required.                             
 The farms grow barley, wheat and oats.
   They make hay and silage.   The oats
 and hay help to feed the horses,      
 ponies and donkey.  The horses are    
 used for racing and hunting and the   
 ponies attend gymkhanas.              
 Peas, beans, potatoes and turnips are 
 also grown and there are bulls, cows, 
 calves, ewes and goats.
