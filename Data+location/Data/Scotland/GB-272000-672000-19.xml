		<title>19PROVOST OF CUMBERNAULD</title>
		<content>{Provost, }is the name used in Scotland
 for the chairman of the{District      
{Council. }He is first of all{elected  
{by the people }as a councillor then   
 the councillors of the ruling party   
 elect a leader who becomes known as   
 the Provost.  The position is held at 
 present by{Provost James Pollock}who  
 was elected in 1984 and will serve    
 until 1988.                           
 It is a very difficult role since he  
 has a full time job as well as being  
 Provost.  He has to divide his time   
 during the day equally between being  
 provost and his own job although most 
 of his evenings and weekends are taken
 up by his duties as Provost.  These   
 duties vary from{chairing council     
{meetings }and{hosting civic receptions
 for visitors to the town to{attending 
{many community events }such as gala   
 days, sports events etc.              </content>
