		<content> Larbert is a typical Scottish village 
 with a long main street dotted with   
 shops the length of it and houses     
 spreading out on either side of it,   
 while Stenhousemuir has a modern{     
{shopping precinct}with the shops      
 clustered together round a paved      
 pedestrian courtyard decorated by two{
{cannons},to remind passers by of the  
 famous Carron Iron Works. The precinct
 has a very good range of shops in it, 
 and ample parking. The{library}at the 
 precinct, is a modern building        
 providing an excellent service for the
 public. The staff are extremely       
 helpful, and charming with it. The    
 local{newspaper}is the Falkirk Herald 
 which has a reporter for the          
 Stenhousemuir and Larbert area. It is 
 produced by the extensive use of      
 modern technology based on computers.
