		<content>   Pennylands Camp,which lies to the   
 south of Auchinleck was built around  
 1940 by the Royal Engineers as        
 a training camp for the Tank          
 Corps.During that time the Barony     
 Road was lined with many tanks        
 because of the excellent cover        
 given by its avenue of mature trees.  
 The Officers used Auchinleck House as 
 their Headquarters. During wartime the
 camp was also used for other purposes.
 It was used as a transit camp for many
 regiments;Grenadier Guards,           
 Inniskillens and some Canadian        
 Regiments.Later the camp was used as a
 Prisoner of War Camp for German and   
 Italian P.O.W's.At the end of the war 
 it was used as a repatriation camp for
 Polish soldiers before they returned  
 to their own country.                 
   There is now little remaining of the
 camp.                                 </content>
