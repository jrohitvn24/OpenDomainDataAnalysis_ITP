		<content> The area is typical small holding     
 farming as you would expect on the    
 edge of suburbia where the            
 climate is not conducive to good      
 cropping. It is within commuting      
 distance to Aberdeen for those who    
 like to be relieved of city pressures,
 and unchanged for the local people who
 do not like the so called better life 
 style enjoyed in a metropolis.  The   
 area offers a unique quality of life  
 which can only be appreciated by those
 who live there.  It is suffering      
 from a reduction in population as     
 farming intensifies and, there being  
 no industry of any size which would   
 create employment worthy of mention.  
 The District Council appears to favour
 tourism in the area and a great effort
 is being made to attract visitors who 
 at the moment concentrate mainly on   
 the nearby Royal Deeside.             </content>
