		<title>13Recreation in Banchory</title>
		<content>    According to the people we         
 interviewed,Banchory's facilities for 
 leisure and recreation were           
 satisfactory, although several people 
 felt that a public swimming pool and  
 a leisure centre were needed to cater 
 for the needs of the growing          
 community,and especially for the young
 people in the area.                   
    The families interviewed all felt  
  that Banchory is an attractive place 
 to live in and most expressed the hope
 that it shouldn't grow much bigger.   
     They seemed to be very satisfied  
 with the quality of life in Banchory.
