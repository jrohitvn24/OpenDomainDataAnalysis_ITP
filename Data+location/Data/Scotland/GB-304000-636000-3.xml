		<content>{Biggar }is a burgh that is proud of   
 its traditions of these the most      
 famous is the {Neerday Bonfire}. The  
 bonfire is an occasion of great       
 festivity in the town and a parade    
 lead by a piper marches up to the     
 bonfire just before midnight to set   
 light to the bonfire. There are older 
 traditions like the {Biggar Play,}    
 which was tradionally performed by the
 young children of the town,but it is  
 no longer done and was only revived   
 recently by the {Biggar Museum        
{Trust.}Another tradition that has     
 disappeared is the battle that used to
 take place between the boys of Biggar 
 and Knocklea,which took place near the
 Biggar burn. A more recent tradition  
 is the Gala and the crowning of the { 
{Fleming Queen},which takes place in   
 June.At the same time the Riding of   
 the Marches takes place.              </content>
