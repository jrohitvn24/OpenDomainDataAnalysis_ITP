		<content>{q.4Are the changes for the better?    
 Oh,I don't think so theres not so     
 much activity in the village with out 
 the trains and buses.                 
{q.5What would you like to be changed? 
 I would like to see more houses being 
 built in the village and so there woud
 be more people to talk to. It's a fine
 wee village and a very freindly       
 village,but it would be fine to see   
 more people in it.                    
{q.6What is in the future for          
{Auchnagatt?} As I say it is a         
 small village I can't see anything in 
 the future for Auchnagat I would like 
 to see more houses being built.
