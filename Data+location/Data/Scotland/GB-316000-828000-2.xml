		<title>02THE GLENLIVET DISTILLERY</title>
		<content>   George Smith first began  distilling
 in 1822 and took out the first Customs
 and  Excise  licence   in  1824   thus
 creating  uproar in the illicit whisky
 trade. Distilling  still  continues in
 the traditional way but now, with  all
 the  modern  machinery, fewer  men are
 required  in the different departments
 - gas fired  stills now take the place
 of coal, and the  barley  is bought in
 already malted instead of  being  done
 at the distillery  with  peat cut from
 the famous  Faemusach Moss. Old timers
 claim it was this peat which gave 'The
 Glenlivet' its special flavour.       
   About 75% of whisky produced is sold
 to  blenders  but  'The Glenlivet'  is
 still  bottled at 12 year old for home
 and export.  There  are  20  duty free
 warehouses for storing whisky until it
 is required for blending or bottling.
