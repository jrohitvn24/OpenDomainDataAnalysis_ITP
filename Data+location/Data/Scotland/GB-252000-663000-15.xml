		<title>15THE WEEKLY SHOPPING</title>
		<content>  When we look at{trading}in this area,
 stretching from the inner city to the 
 residential suburbs, we do not see the
 giant stores or hypermarkets found in 
 the urban fringe.  The majority of    
 trading is done through small shops,  
 mainly for daily or weekly uses, lined
 along two of the major routeways,     
 Govan road and Paisley Road West.     
 There are also some large supermarkets
 along P.R.W, and there is a new       
{shopping centre}at Govan Cross,       
 accessible by Underground as well as  
 car and bus.  The Co-Op owns this     
 centre, and also have a major         
 wholesale distribution centre at      
 Sheildhall in the north west corner of
 the area.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
