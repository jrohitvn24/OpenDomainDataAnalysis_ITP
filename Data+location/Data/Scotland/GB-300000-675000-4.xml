		<title>04      St.Michaels</title>
		<content>{  St.Michaels }is one of the finest   
 churches in Britain.It was built in   
 the 15th century and was dedicated by 
{David de Bernham }the Bishop of {     
{St.Andrews}on the 22nd of May 1242.   
 One of the churches finest points is  
 the beautiful window in{St.Kathrines  
 aisle.The original stone crown above  
 the bell tower was removed in 1821    
 because it was considered dilapated   
 and dangerous.The present spire was   
 built of laminated timber super purity
 aluminium.                            
   St.Michael's now belongs to the     
 Church of Scotland and plays an active
 part in the local community.A fund    
 raising scheme has recently raised a  
 great deal of money for vital repairs 
 to the roof.                          
   The church is open to visitors and  
 is an important tourist attraction in 
 the town.                             </content>
