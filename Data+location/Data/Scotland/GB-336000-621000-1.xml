		<title>01A SECTION OF ETTRICK VALLEY</title>
		<content> This part is crossed by the River     
 Ettrick and the road from Upper       
 Ettrick to Selkirk. A few fields are  
 cultivated for hay and silage but most
 of the ground is steep rough grazing  
 carrying a stock of Scottish          
 Black-Faced Sheep and beef-type       
 single-suckling cows. Farming is the  
 main occupation but some of the farm  
 cottages have been bought by people   
 who commute to nearby towns. The area 
 contains blocks of coniferous trees   
 most of which have been planted in the
 last twenty years. The river is fished
 for salmon and brown trout and there  
 is a little shooting for pheasant and 
 grouse. Wildlife includes rabbits,    
 hares, roedeer, foxes, mink and       
 numerous small rodents and many       
 moorland birds. Although thinly       
 populated there is a very lively      
 social life centred in nearby village.</content>
