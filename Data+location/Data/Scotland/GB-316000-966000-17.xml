		<title>17A CASTLETOWN SCHOOLBOY'S DAY</title>
		<content> My name is Trevor MacLeod.At 8.10 am  
 I get up,dress and have a breakfast of
 Frosties and milk.At 8.45 am I set off
 for school on my bike.School starts at
 9.15 am.First we hand in our homework 
 and then we do some English.We have   
 playtime at 10.40 am when the boys    
 usually play football.After playtime  
 we do Four Rules of Decimals followed 
 by Maths.At 12.50 pm we stop for      
 lunch.I take a school lunch which may 
 be fish and chips and jelly and ice   
 cream.Then we have playtime until     
 1.55 pm when we do Project or Art work
 until 3.30 pm when we go home.At home 
 I make the fire and then play on the  
 computer until dinner.After dinner I  
 go down the street to play with my    
 pals but only on a dry night.We       
 usually play football or else we play 
 on our BMX bikes.Then I go home,have  
 supper and go to bed at 10.00 pm.     </content>
