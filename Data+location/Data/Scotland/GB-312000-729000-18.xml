		<content> There are 26 girls in our school.     
 We(Janice and Paula) asked the six P6 
 &amp;7 girls for their favourite          
 activities:                           
            Janice's is gymnastics (in 
 Perth);Paula's is ice skating (in     
 Perth) Karen F's is tennis;           
 Jacqueline's is swimming; Katherine's 
 is roller skating; Karen W's is horse 
 riding.                               
                                       
                                       
 Our favourite Pop Star is Madonna.    
 Janice likes to dress up as her.      
                                       
                                       
 At school we two, with Karen          
 F.,Nicholas R. and Jacqueline are     
 making a School Magazine. It is       
 exciting.
