		<content> The area in which we live is mostly   
 rural. There are a few villages like  
 Twechar &amp; Queenzieburn which surround 
 the small market town of Kilsyth. Long
 ago Kilsyth  was known as Monieburgh  
 but it's name was changed when a      
 castle was built on the site of an    
 ancient chapel in the 16th century .  
      Most of the local farmers keep   
 cattle ,sheep or pigs and give over   
 their land to rough  grazing or the   
 growing of  animal food.              
      People here have to travel       
 outside the area for work ,leisure and
 shopping but a great deal is going    
 on to improve the facilities. A       
 disused quarry has been transformed   
 into an attractive leisure park, the  
 centre of Kilsyth is being modernised,
 bothshops and houses and there is to  
 be a leisure park along the canal.
