		<title>06Kinmount House-1</title>
		<content> This beautiful house in the style of  
{Georgian Scotland}is now little better
 than a worn out wreck.                
                                       
    The house,built on the site of old 
 Kelhead House burnt down in 1800,was  
 ordered to be built by the{6th Marquis
{of Queensberry}and was finished in    
 1812.When it was built it was set in  
 large majestic grounds which now sadly
 do not belong to the house but belong 
 to the{Hoddam and Kinmount Estate.}The
 modern house is now only set in 13    
 acres of land with wrecked gardens,   
 jungle lawns and cracked paving       
 stones.It also has belonging to it 2  
 man-made lakes.                       
                                       
 Round these lakes there is a large    
 over grown bird reserve with Heron and
 Canada Geese being among the more     
 unusual visitors.                     </content>
