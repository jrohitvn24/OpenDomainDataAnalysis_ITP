		<title>16EMPLOYMENT AT SANDHEAD</title>
		<content> The main sources of employment in our 
 block are FARMING, WEST FREUGH,       
 DISTRICT COUNCIL, and SERVICES( shops,
 hotels, and taxis ).                  
 Farming has seen many changes, with   
 mechanisation; co-operative cropping  
 of silage, hay, and cereals; and the  
 introduction of computerised milking  
 parlours reducing manpower needs by as
 much as 30% to 50%.                   
 Some of the skilled workers from West 
 Freugh live in and around Sandhead,   
 these being what the locals call "    
 incomers " i.e. not natives. Most of  
 the locals employed by The Freugh and 
 the District Council earn their living
 in semi-skilled or labouring jobs.    
 The shops and hotels employ mostly    
 females with extra staff being taken  
 on during the summer months. There is 
 not much unemployment, but a lot of   
 residents are retired pensioners.     </content>
