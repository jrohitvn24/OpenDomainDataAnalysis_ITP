		<content> My day begins when mum wakes me up at 
 half past seven. I make my bed, put on
 my school uniform and then I have my  
 breakfast of cornflakes and toast.    
 After that I get my school bag ready  
 and set off for school. I either      
 walk or go in the car. When I arrive  
 at school I play with my friends and  
 when the bell rings at nine o'clock we
 line up. When the teacher comes into  
 our classroom we stand up and say     
 "Good Morning". Then we do some       
 writing, sums, language and reading   
 every day. At three thirty school     
 finishes and when I get home I change 
 into my outdoor clothes then do my    
 homework. While mum is making the     
 dinner I go outside to play and when  
 dad comes in we eat. After watching   
 T.V. for a short while I go to bed.
