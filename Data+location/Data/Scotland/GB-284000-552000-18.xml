		<content>   The joint Parish of Colvend and     
 Southwick was formed by King James VI 
 in 1612 and covers about 40 square    
 miles.                                
   Until the Reformation (i.e.about    
 1565) an ancient church at Colvend had
 been associated with the Nunnery at   
 Lincluden in Dumfries.It was pulled   
 down in 1771 and another church built 
 on the same spot. The present church, 
 built immediately north of the old    
 one, was completed in 1910. While the 
 new church was being built the        
 congregation met for public worship in
 Colvend School.                       
   The form of worship is Presbyterian 
 and Colvend Church is part of the     
 Church of Scotland. The nearest Roman 
 Catholic Church is in Dalbeattie where
 there is also a Scottish Episcopal    
 Church. Several smaller sects meet in 
 Dalbeattie or Castle Douglas.         </content>
