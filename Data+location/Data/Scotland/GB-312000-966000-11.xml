		<title>11BIRD WATCHING AT THE HARBOUR</title>
		<content>   Many birds gather to feed on the    
 sewage discharged into{Thurso Bay.}A  
 new sewage pumping works is being     
 built which will pump waste much      
 further out to sea so the harbour may 
 no longer be so attractive to bird    
 watchers.                             
   Many species of birds are sighted   
 here but during the winter months it  
 is the rare visitors from northern    
 regions that cause excitement.        
   The most interesting has been a     
 Ross's Gull which came in the winter  
 of 1984 and 1985 and stayed several   
 months.                               
   'Twitchers' came from as far as     
 London and even a Dutch honeymoon     
 couple travelled the length of Britain
 to see this rare sight.               
    Brent Geese and Little Gulls also  
 visit and we saw a Great Northern     
 Diver in summer plumage on our outing.</content>
