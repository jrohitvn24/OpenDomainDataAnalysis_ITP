		<title>14SHOPPING IN LEUCHARS</title>
		<content> In Leuchars there are only a few      
 shops.  A survey showed that 70% of   
 the Leuchars population did their main
 shopping in Dundee as there is only 1 
 newsagent, 1 butchers, 2 small        
 supermarkets and 1 cafe in Leuchars.  
 The other 30% of the Leuchars         
 population is mostly old people and   
 they use the shops in Leuchars.  The  
 main shopping days for Leuchars are   
 Friday and Thursday and half day is   
 Saturday for most shops.  There are   
 little problems with theft and all the
 shop keepers are pleased with the     
 custom that there shops get.
