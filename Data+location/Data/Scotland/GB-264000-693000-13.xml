		<title>13THE MINK FARM</title>
		<content>{Kippen Mink Farm}is situated about two
 miles south of Kippen Cross.It is run 
 by{Mr.A.Neill}with the help of two    
 workers.He started with two mink as a 
 hobby before going into business 15   
 years ago.There are{7500}white,light  
 and dark brown and black mink in cages
 at the farm.They are sociable animals 
 and prefer to have company in their   
 cages-if the wire between cages is    
 damaged all the animals from both will
 move in together!They are fed twice a 
 day on a mixture of animal and fish   
 offal and meal.The babies are born in 
 May and kept until the pelts are at   
 their best in December when they are  
 killed and skinned.The pelts are sent 
 to{London}where they are sold.It takes
 30 skins to make a jacket.The tails   
 are used for hats.Mr.Neill keeps some 
 females for breeding and the usual    
 litter size is five.                  </content>
