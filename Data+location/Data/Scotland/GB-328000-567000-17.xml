		<title>17The Registrar(cont)</title>
		<content> Such has become the popularity of{    
{Gretna }that weddings are performed on
 only {4 }days to leave {Tuesday}and { 
{Thursday}free for administration.In a 
 day the registrar can marry up to 14  
 couples.Each ceremony takes only 10   
 minutes to perform.                   
                                       
    Contrary to general belief an      
 application must be made to the       
 registrar before getting married in { 
{Gretna},and couples cannot just turn  
 up and expect to be married.The ages  
 of those who have  come to Gretna to  
 tie the knot range from {16 to  80.}  
 Pat enjoys her job very much          
 indeed,and hopes to continue until she
 retires.
