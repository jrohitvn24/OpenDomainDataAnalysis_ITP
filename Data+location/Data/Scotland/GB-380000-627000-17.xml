		<content> Saturday 3rd November 1984.           
 Duncanhaugh Mill was flooded! After   
 continuous heavy rain the River       
 Bowmont rose rapidly flooding low     
 lying fields. At 2.30pm the Haugh was 
 green by 2.45 the river was in the    
 house the gate into the Haugh         
 submerged! The swirling muddy water   
 came into the house by back and front 
 doors and the Baxi fire air vent      
 simultaneously. We hurriedly moved    
 books, electrical items and           
 furnishings upstairs. The flood       
 receded quickly after reaching a depth
 of 60cms. Everything was covered in   
 silt slime sand and other debris which
 had to be shovelled out before we     
 could lift the carpets. All the floor 
 coverings were ruined and wallpaper   
 spoilt. The house felt damp and cold  
 for weeks despite being heated day and
 night.                                </content>
