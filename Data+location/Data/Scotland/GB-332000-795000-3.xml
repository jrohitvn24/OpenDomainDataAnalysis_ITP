		<content> 1. Coniferous woodlands               
      Most of the trees in the area    
 have been planted by man, as is       
 evidenced by the fact that they are   
 planted in straight lines, and are    
 close together, resulting in tall     
 straight tree trunks.  However, a     
 small area on the south Deeside road  
 is semi-natural pinewood, probably    
 self seeded from a plantation or      
 perhaps a decendant of the old        
 Caladonian pine forest.  These are the
 trees that characterize a large part  
 of upper Deeside.  They have much more
 space to grow laterally than trees in 
 plantations and consequently twist    
 themselves into weird and wonderful   
 shapes.
