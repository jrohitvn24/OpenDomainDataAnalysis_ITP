		<title>06EMPLOYMENT IN KIP VALLEY</title>
		<content> The major source of employment in this
 area is the factory in Spango Valley  
 run by{International Business Machines
{.} They currently employ 2800 people  
  and have not yet reached their       
 maximum expansion. IBM moved to Spango
 Valley in 1954 where they rented a    
 factory from the government. They were
 attracted to the area by good road    
 communications and the nearby airports
 of Prestwick and Glasgow.Disadvantages
 of the site are lack of level ground  
 to the NW and SE and the marshy ground
 of the valley floor. Their factory    
 assembles visual display units. About 
 75% of the work force are local people
 .IBM runs a government sponsered      
 training scheme for people of ages 18 
 and over. The work force is retrained 
 by IBM. Other employment is provided  
 by schools, shops, farms, hotels and  
 Inverkip Marina.                      </content>
