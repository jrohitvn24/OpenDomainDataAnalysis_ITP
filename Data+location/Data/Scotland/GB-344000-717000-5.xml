		<content> The main employer in Guardbridge is   
 the long established Guardbridge paper
 mill, where approximatly 360 people,  
 mainly men, work full time. Originally
 all its workers lived locally, but now
 many travel from places like Dundee   
 and St Andrews and smaller villages   
 in the locality, most of whom travel  
 to work by car. As there are few      
 services in the village:one shop,one  
 hotel and one TSB branch bank, few    
 people find work in this area. Work on
 local farms at one time employed quite
 a few people; but now increased       
 mechanisation means that few are so   
 employed. Some people who live in the 
 village travel to work in St Andrews, 
 5 miles away, where there is a wider  
 variety of job opportunities. The     
 recent opening of a riding stables may
 give work to some locals.
