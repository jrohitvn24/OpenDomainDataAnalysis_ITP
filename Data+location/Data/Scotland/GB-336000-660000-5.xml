		<content>   Considering most of the land on our 
 patch is farmland ( the rest being    
 forest and village) there are many    
 farms.They tend to be rather small and
 quite similar.Much of the land is     
 grazing pasture for cows and sheep.   
 The crops grown are mainly barley and 
 wheat with a few turnips and potato   
 fields.Grass is grown for winter      
 feeding.                              
    There are eight farms on our patch 
 they are Blinkbonny Farm, Newlandburn 
 Farm, Mountskip Farm,Wright's         
 Houses,Loquhariot, Borthwick Mains,   
 Hagbrae and Crichton Mains.           
  Rather than write a little about     
 each farm we have decided to highligt 
 one;Newlandburn Farm.We visited both  
 farms and this is what we             
 discovered.(continued on page 6)
