		<content>  I woke up today and i watched the    
 Television. I went to the toilet and  
 then i got dressed. I ate my breakfast
 and then I went outside to wait for   
 the Taxi.                             
  I arrived at school and Robert,Gavin 
 and I played Football.                
  The bell rang and everyone went      
 inside. Mr.Nicholson our Art Teacher  
 came and we did interesting pictures. 
  We went outside to play and we did   
 High Jump.                            
  The bell rang so we went in and      
 started our Maths.                    
  We went to Lunch which was quite     
 nice.                                 
  We went to play outside and we had a 
 game of Football.                     
  We had a visit from two ladies who   
 told us about the Dores Gala. We all  
 got a tube of sweets from them.
