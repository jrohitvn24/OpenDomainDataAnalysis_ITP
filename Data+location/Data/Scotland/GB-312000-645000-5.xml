		<content> MOST PEOPLE LIKE GARDENING OR FISHING 
 OR MACHINE KNITTING. CHILDREN PLAY    
 FOOTBALL AND NETBALL; SOME CHILDREN   
 PLAY TENNIS OR DO GYMNASTICS. WE HAVE 
 GROUPS OF BROWNIES, CUBS, GUIDES AND  
 SCOUTS, A PLAY-GROUP, A YOUTH GROUP   
 AND MEMBERS OF A PIPE BAND. THE ADULTS
 HAVE THE W.R.I. (WOMEN'S RURAL        
 INSTITUTE), THE CHURCH GUILD, A DARTS 
 CLUB AND SOME BOWLING. THERE IS A     
 MOBILE LIBRARY FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY    
 READING. JOGGING IS POPULAR, MANY     
 PEOPLE HAVE PETS AND EVERYONE ENJOYS  
 WATCHING TELEVISION. SOMEONE KEEPS    
 FERRETS FOR CATCHING RABBITS. ROOKS   
 AND PIGEONS ARE SOMETIMES PESTS AND   
 ARE SHOT TO KEEP THEIR NUMBERS DOWN.  
 THE ROYAL OBSERVER CORPS MEET         
 REGULARLY AND DISCUSS MATTERS OF      
 NATIONAL DEFENCE. FOR THEATRES,       
 CINEMAS, CONCERTS AND MUSEUMS,        
 EDINBURGH IS THE NEAREST CENTRE.      </content>
