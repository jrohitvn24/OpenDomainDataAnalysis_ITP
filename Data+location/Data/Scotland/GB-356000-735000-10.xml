		<title>10A FAMILY'S DAY part 2</title>
		<content>   The family are all together again   
 for the main meal of the day, around  
 6pm.  This has given the children time
 to do their homework while mother has 
 been preparing the meal and their     
 father has been making his way home   
 from work.  The family use this time  
 together for catching up on each      
 other's news and the events of the    
 day.                                  
   Later in the evening Clare goes off 
 to Brownies, where she is a patrol    
 leader and Dad goes out about 8pm.to  
 the local Snooker Club.  Mum has a    
 chance to do her ironing while Daniel 
 watches his favourite T.V. programme.
