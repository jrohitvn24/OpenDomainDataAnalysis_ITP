		<title>05LUNAN AREA, TRANSPORT.</title>
		<content> There are two main roads in this area,
 both of which run north-east. The B   
 road runs along the lower ground near 
 to the coast and through Lunan        
 Village, whilst the A92 runs along the
 higher ground approximately 500 metres
 inland. Minor roads and paths connect 
 the two at various points. The only   
 public transport to use the B road is 
 the school bus which takes the primary
 school children to Inverkeilor        
 school.The Dundee to Aberdeen bus runs
 hourly along the A92 road, where there
 are request bus stops. The long       
 distance buses also use this route but
 only pick up passengers at the major  
 towns. The main railway line of the   
 British Rail Scottish Region to       
 Aberdeen runs through this section but
 Lunan station was closed in 1932.
