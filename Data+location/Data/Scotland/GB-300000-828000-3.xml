		<content> HISTORICAL GROWTH OF GRANTOWN ON SPEY 
                                       
 Grantown-on-Spey is recognised as one 
 of the best examples of a planned town
 in the Highlands of Scotland.  The age
 of Grantown can be accurately dated to
 1766 when Sir Ludovic Grant offered   
 lots of land for development.         
                                       
 Settlement within the area dates back 
 to much arelier times, but was mainly 
 concentrated around Castle Grant,     
 about one mile north east of the      
 present town.                         
                                       
 The town grew as a centre for linen   
 manufacture and as a market town.     
 Although the linen industry collapsed,
 its market function has continued.  In
 the late nineteenth century it grew as
 a tourist centre, especially after the
 visit of Queen Victoria in 1860.      </content>
