		<content>{A  TYPICAL  DAY IN MY LIFE}           
 When I get up every morning firstly I 
 get dressed and then I go and help Mum
 with the breakfast. Mum does my hair  
 because it is long and hard for me to 
 do my self.                           
 Then I brush my teeth and get my      
 packed lunch  ready and get shoes on  
 and go to school. The first thing I do
 when the bell rings is go inside      
 (unless I am already in) and then     
 normally I do sums until break time.  
 Afterwards I usually do English       
 language work. In the afternoon our   
 class normally does drawing,painting  
 and puppets and other craft activities
 Some times we go out for environmental
 studies.                              
 After school I go home and get into   
 trousers. Then I go to play on the    
 bales. Round about six o'clock I come 
 down and have my tea.                 </content>
