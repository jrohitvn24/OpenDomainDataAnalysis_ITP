		<title>08NEW ABBEY - HOUSING</title>
		<content>   The village has developed in two    
 parts. The older properties (several  
 belonging to Shambellie Estate or     
 Messrs. Kingan, who own the Sawmill)  
 lie along the winding village street. 
 A local authority housing scheme of   
 single storey dwellings,begun in 1932,
 was gradually extended until 1974.    
   Some Council tenants have purchased 
 their homes,and only one old cottage  
 in the Square is without an inside    
 toilet. Farmhouses are mostly 18th or 
 19th Century; most have been extended 
 and modernised, as have the cottages  
 for the farmworkers, some of which are
 now let as holiday houses.            
    A 15th Century house once occupied 
 by the last Abbot has been restored.  
 Shambellie House is now a Costume     
 Museum, the Laird living in a smaller 
 residence. The old School has been    
 converted to two private dwellings.   </content>
