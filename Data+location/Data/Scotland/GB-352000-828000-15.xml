 the 1980's has 2-3 children. Most     
 families have at least one car        
 sometimes more.All homes use          
 electricity as a source of power and  
 there are numerous electrical devices 
 to help with housework and for        
 entertainment in all of our homes.At  
 home we spend a lot of our leisure    
 time watching television listening to 
 music recordings or watching video    
 tapes.Most families only get together 
 for occasions such as weddings and    
 christenings or for festivals such as 
 Christmas or Hogmanay.For the first   
 time home computers are becoming      
 popular and many people are getting   
 one for their home.Nowadays many      
 families are separated by great       
 distances with family members living  
 and working in other towns or cities  
 or even in other countries.           </content>
