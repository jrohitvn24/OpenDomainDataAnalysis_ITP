 Forteviot village and lies to the     
 north of the B935. The building is    
 made of white harling and red brick.  
 The play ground lies in front of the  
 school and is laid out in a netball   
 court and various games. There is also
 a climbing frame, recently put  out of
 bounds due to the poor surface under  
 it.Grass lies to the north of the
