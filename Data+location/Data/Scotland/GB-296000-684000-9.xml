		<title>09A SHORT HISTORY OF CULROSS 1</title>
		<content>   Standing at the Mercat Cross in     
 Culross and looking in every          
 direction, one might imagine that one 
 had been transported into a different 
 century or that one was on a film set.
 In fact the town is frequently used as
 a film set, for the heart of Culross  
 is as it was in the l7th century;     
 little houses with pantile roofs and  
 crow-step gables, half-shuttered      
 windows, narrow cobbled streets with  
 their "croon o'the causey", a raised  
 path of wider, flatter stones where   
 the rich people walked to escape the  
 filthy gutters on either side. The    
 only difference here is that the      
 'croon' is much lower today than in   
 previous times to allow today's motor 
 cars to escape damage underneath. The 
 history of Culross actually goes back 
 even further - more than a thousand   
 years, in fact.                       </content>
