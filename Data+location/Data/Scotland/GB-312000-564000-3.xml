		<content> In this area,transport is mainly by   
 motor vehicles on the B724 and many   
 smaller side  roads.There is a regular
 bus service.   There is a railway line
 through the Parish ,but the station in
 Cummertrees is closed.   Passenger    
 trains,and goods trains,trains with   
 cars,and repair trains zoom past every
 day.   There are 4 railway bridges.   
 Every year old motor cars,vintage and 
 veteran, pass through the village.    
 We have no airports,but jets go over. 
 We have no harbours,but boats can sail
 out of Powfoot.There is only 1 boat   
 on shore there just now.
