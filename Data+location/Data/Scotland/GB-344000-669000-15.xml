		<title>15THE BOGGS HOLDINGS</title>
		<content>{   }The Boggs Holdings were set up    
 during the early 193Os to help reduce 
 the high unemployment which caused the
 great strikes in the mid 192Os.Forty  
 two small holdings were formed when   
 the Boggs Farm was split up. The farm 
 belonged to Winton Estate and is      
 situated to the North East of the main
 village.                              
     The fields in the Boggs probably  
 range from 6-1O acres each and in the 
 old days forty two families made thier
 living from hens, pigs, soft fruit and
 vegetables. Several had a cow to      
 produce thier own milk and butter.    
 Mr Mair who was a local vet says that 
 there was hardly a week went past     
 without the vets being in the Boggs to
 attend pigs. There are none now.      
      Because of economics 6 acres must
 produce a high profit to keep a family
