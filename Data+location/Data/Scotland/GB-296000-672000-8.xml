		<title>08Climbing at Beecraigs</title>
		<content> The instruction and activities at     
 Beecraigs are excellent. I can say    
 this because I have sampled them many 
 times myself. The worst thing about   
 climbing is that it takes so long to  
 set up the equipment. This was        
 certainly true with us as it took     
 about half an hour to set it all up,  
 but it was worth it. At first we were 
 feeding out the rope to someone who   
 was going down the hillside and then  
 pulling them back up. Then we went on 
 to the more exciting abseiling. This  
 was definitely the better of the two  
 and after we had been at it for a     
 little while we had races. This       
 involved abseiling down the hill,     
 unhooking yourself from the rope and  
 climbing back up it.
