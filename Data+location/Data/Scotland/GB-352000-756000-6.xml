		<content> The{Mushroom Farm}was started 25 years
 ago and the mushrooms are grown in    
 "houses",which is the name given to   
 the sheds.There are five "houses" in  
 which the mushrooms are grown in      
 rotation, one different "house"being  
 sterilised each time.The mushrooms are
 grown in large boxes which are        
 sterilised in Formaldehyde Crystals.  
 Conditions must be very sterile as    
 mushrooms are prone to disease.The    
 Compost itself is sterilised for two  
 weeks and then hand_mixed before being
 put into the boxes.                   
 The spawn (seeds) is kept at a        
 temerature of 70_75 degs until it     
 begins to "run", when the temperature 
 is reduced to 60_66 degs.The spawn    
 forms a mould in two weeks and 2      
 inches of peat is clapped down on top.
 After a further two weeks the         
 mushrooms are ready for picking.      </content>
