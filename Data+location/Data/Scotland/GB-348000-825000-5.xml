		<title>05My Day</title>
		<content> I woke up at 10.30am.   It was dullish
 I got upand had a stroll round the    
 house in my pyjamas.   Then at about  
 11.30am I bunged on my clothes.   Then
 I went through for my dinner.   Then  
 after that Angela came round for me at
 1.30.   So we sat around at the play  
 park.   Then Angela told me that we   
 sat around waiting for her.   Then    
 Fraser told us that Donna was at the  
 top of the square.   So we went up to 
 see her at 2.30.   So we went down to 
 the Bogie Bridge to have a look.      
 Then Donna wanted the toilet so we    
 went up to the publics, we waited     
 outside.   When she came out we went  
 to Angela's house for a drink of cola,
 then before we new it it was 5.00pm so
 we all went home for our supper.   I  
 had broth, beef &amp; potatoes and        
 custard.   Then Hazel and John cme in 
 for a while. I went to bed at 12.30am.</content>
