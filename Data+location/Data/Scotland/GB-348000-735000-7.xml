		<content> Within our unit there are 12 farms.   
 The soil throughout the unit is rich  
 and fertile, and most farms work a    
 four year rotation of wheat or        
 barley/grass/potatoes/turnips. The    
 majority of the farms are some 400+   
 acres in extent, and have invested    
 heavily in plant and machinery. With  
 the emphasis on capital investment,   
 little labour  is needed, and most    
 farms employ only 2/3 men. Some farms,
 however, have a few acres of          
 strawberries or raspberries, in which 
 the local schoolchildren find         
 employment in the summer holidays. In 
 addition, not all farms have          
 completely mechanised their potato    
 harvesting, and in the months of late 
 Sep/Oct/early Nov, schoolchildren are 
 employed to harvest the potato crop,  
 earning up to Â£150 for their labours.
