		<content>   Although a main railway and busy    
 major road cut across the area, the   
 district  itself is very poorly served
 by public transport.Only one bus      
 service with ten buses per day serves 
 the area, running from Barrhead to    
 Kilmarnock via Uplawmoor.             
   There were two railway stations     
 twenty five years ago, but now there  
 are none, the nearest station being   
 the end of the 'blue train'line at    
 Neilston.Though underused it is the   
 one direct public link with the local 
 secondary school and Glasgow.It is    
 threatened with closure as the        
 Government makes financial cutbacks.  
   Being a commuter area the populace  
 has to rely on private transport.In a 
 school survey we discovered that the  
 cars of Uplawmoor cover two and a half
 million miles each year.
