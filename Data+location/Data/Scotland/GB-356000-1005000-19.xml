		<title>19TOURISM IN DEERNESS (2)</title>
		<content> Boat trips start from Skaill which can
 take you to the{Brough of Deerness,   
 the Gloup, around the Mull Head and to
 the island of Copinsay. The{Gloup}is a
 huge sea cavern open to the sky,      
 connected to the sea by a passage     
 through the rocks. The boat glides    
 through the narrow entrance, then into
 the heart of the rock, which rises    
 sheer to the sunlight above. The{Mull 
{Head}with vertical sea cliffs has     
 colonies of kittiwakes, shags,        
 razorbills and puffins. Photographers 
 can obtain delightful pictures. The   
{Island of Copinsay,}now owned by{RSPB 
 is a bird reserve. Large colonies of  
 sea-birds are also found here. The    
 lighthouse, built during World War 1, 
 is being modernised with a view to    
 being automated and demanned.
