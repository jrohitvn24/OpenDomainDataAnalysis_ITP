		<content> CARBERRY TOWER IS A VERY OLD HOUSE.   
 THE OLDEST PART,THE TOWER DATES FROM  
 THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.THE WALLS OF   
 THE TOWER ARE SO THICK THAT THE ROOMS 
 IN IT ARE EXTREMELY COLD BECAUSE THE  
 HEAT OF THE SUN NEVER PENETRATES      
 THEM.IT USED TO BE OWNED BY A VERY    
 WEALTHY NOBLE FAMILY.NOW IT IS OWNED  
 BY THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.THEY USE IT 
 AS A CONFERENCE CENTRE FOR GROUPS OF  
 MINISTERS AND ELDERS FROM CHURCHES    
 THROUGHOUT SCOTLAND.THE PEOPLE MEETING
 THERE DON'T SPEND ALL THEIR TIME IN   
 SERIOUS DISCUSSION.THERE ARE MANY     
 THINGS FOR THEM TO DO IN THEIR SPARE  
 TIME.THEY CAN PLAY TABLE TENNIS,DARTS 
 BILLIARDS AND OTHER SPORTS .THERE ARE 
 TWO LIBRARIES.THEY CAN GO FOR WALKS IN
 THE BEAUTIFUL GROUNDS IN WHICH THE    
 HOUSE STANDS.THERE IS A CHAPEL WHERE  
 SERVICES ARE HELD.
