{A Day In The Life Of Sally King       
 On Saturday I begin the day by taking 
 the dog for a walk and then go        
 jogging.I come home and put my jodpurs
 and all of my riding gear and set off 
 for Greenloaning Riding School. This  
 starts at 10.30am. When I get there I 
 go into the office and check which    
 horse I'm on then run to the horse's  
 stable and help tack the horse up.    
  When my lesson is over I help in the 
 stable until Dad collects me. We have 
 lunch together which is always chicken
 soup,and then I go outside to play    
 because my Mummy is a night nurse and 
 so sleeps all day and if you wake her 
 up your in big trouble. Daddy makes   
 the tea and afterwards I lie in front 
 of the television with my dog,        
 Bentley,and later struggle up the     
 stairs to bed,exhausted.              </content>
