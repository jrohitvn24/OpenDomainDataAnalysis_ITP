		<title>04FARMING IN SOUTH INVERKIP</title>
		<content> There are three farms in this area.   
 Finnock Bog and Hill farm are both    
 dairy farms.  They have 350 livestock 
 and 160 hectares between them.        
 Berfern farm is a beef farm with 52   
 livestock and 30 hectares of land.    
 Both Berfern farm and Finnock Bog farm
 have been made smaller due to the     
 electricity board having built a power
 station. On the other hand the Hill   
 farm has expanded.  All of the farms  
 are tenants of the{Ardgowan Estate.   
 All the farms are family businesses   
 and all of them provide employment,   
 but only for one or two people.  The  
 attitudes of all three farmers is that
 they enjoy both the climate and the   
 farming in the area.
