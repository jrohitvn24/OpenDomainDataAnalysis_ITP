		<title>01DAVIOT,STRATHNAIRN,INVERNESS</title>
		<content> Daviot is a scattered rural area, six 
 miles south of the highland capital,  
 Inverness,bordering Culloden Moor.    
    The main road, the A9, runs through
 the village, separating the village   
 into to separate areas, Daviot East   
 and West. The A9 runs north from      
 Perth, right to Inverness and then on 
 up to Wick, in the far North.         
    The Strath is two hundred metres   
 above sea level and is mostly hilly   
 moorland with a lot of{heather},fir   
 trees!_and hill sheep farms.          
    Two landmarks, which can be seen   
 when coming in to Daviot are the      
{church}and the{quarry.}Because of     
 the quarry there is a lot of traffic, 
 especially lorries, going up and down 
 the A9.                               
    On the whole, Daviot is a pleasant,
 peaceful place but unfortunately, the 
 A9 encourages people to rush through! </content>
