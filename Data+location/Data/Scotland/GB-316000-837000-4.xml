		<title>04EMPLOYMENT IN BALLINDALLOCH</title>
		<content> How lucky it is that conditions in    
 this area are right for whisky        
 distilling, because this industry     
 plays an important part in the lives  
 of the people by creating employment. 
 About one _third of the bread winners 
 in Ballindalloch work at our two      
 distilleries. Farming is the second   
 most  common occupation .             
    Game keepers and fishing ghillies  
 are essential workers, to care for the
 game on the moors and  the fish in the
 rivers and to help those  who come    
 here, often from far away,to shoot and
 fish.                                 
   One fairly common occupation is     
 unexpected in this inland area.Several
 men work in North Sea oil-rigs or in  
 oil-related industries.Their families 
 remain at home while they fly by      
 helicopter between the mainland and   
 the rigs for their spells of duty.    </content>
