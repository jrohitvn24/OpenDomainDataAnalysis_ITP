		<title>12CROFTING IN PLOCKTON.</title>
		<content>  THERE ARE NO LARGE FARMS HERE,BUT    
{AGRICULTURE}IS CARRIED ON BY{CROFTING.
 CROFTS HERE ARE SMALL,WITH MAYBE ONLY 
 ONE OR TWO ACRES ON WHICH TO GROW OATS
 POTATOES,TURNIPS OR HAY.EACH CROFTER  
 ALSO HAS A SHARE OF THE{COMMON GRAZING
 WHICH IS ROUGH HILL GROUND USED FOR   
 CATTLE OR{SHEEP.}MOST CROFTERS ARE    
 ONLY PART TIME AND HAVE ANOTHER JOB   
 AS WELL.THE DUIRINISH CROFTERS KEEP   
 SHEEP,BUT IN PLOCKTON AND DRUMBUIE    
 THEY ONLY KEEP CATTLE.COWS WANDER     
 FREELY ON THE COMMON GRAZING,AND IN   
 HOT WEATHER IN SUMMER OFTEN BATHE IN  
 THE SEA OR LIE ON THE SHORE.IN{SPRING 
 THE FIELDS ARE PLOUGHED AND PLANTED.  
 DURING THE{SUMMER}GATHERING IN THE HAY
 NEEDS LOTS OF HELPERS.IN THE{AUTUMN   
 THE CROPS ARE HARVESTED,AND THAT YEARS
{LAMBS AND CALVES}ARE SENT TO MARKET.IN
{WINTER}THE CATTLE ARE FED WELL,AS THEY
 STAY OUT AND WILL CALF IN THE SPRING. </content>
