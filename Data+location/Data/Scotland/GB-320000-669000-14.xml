		<content>  In the morning at about 8.45 I leave 
 for school. My Dad goes to work at the
 same time. My Dad works in the high   
 flats. He works in the flats we stay  
 in. He brushes and mops the stairs. He
 is a caretaker. We get a free house   
 because of this. We get the telephone 
 free, and we don't have to pay rent.  
 At 12.50 my Dad runs my Mum to work in
 his car. His car is a Vauxhall Viva.  
 It is a T registration which means    
 that it was made between August 1978  
 and July 1979. My Mum works just off  
 Dundee Street in a children's nursery.
 She works there from 1.00 to 4.30. I  
 come home from school at 3.15. At 4.20
 I go with my Dad in his car to pick   
 my Mum up. We arrive back about 4.40. 
 My Mum makes the tea at this time. My 
 favourite tea is mince and potatoes. I
 watch television after tea. Sometimes 
 I go out to play.I go to bed at 10.00.</content>
