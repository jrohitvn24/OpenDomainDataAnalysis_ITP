 Dad gets up at 6 a.m. and gets        
 dressed. He puts on his outdoor       
 clothes,picks up the milk pail and    
 collects Jenny the cow from the       
 field.He milks her and when he comes  
 back we all have our breakfast        
 together. We always have toast and a  
 buttery. Dad then collects our two    
 sheepdogs, Queen and Bob, and they    
 walk round the fields checking the    
 sheep. My job is to feed the pet lambs
 by hand with made-up powdered milk. My
 sister and I go to the road end to    
 wait for the school bus. My sister    
 attends the Secondary School in       
 Kirriemuir which is thirteen miles    
 away and I travel three and a half    
 miles to the local Glenisla Primary   
 School. When I arrive I play with my  
 friends until the bell rings .        </content>
