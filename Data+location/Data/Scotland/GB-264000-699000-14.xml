		<title>14THORNHILL OUR CHURCH</title>
		<content> Our church is called Norrieston and it
 is mentioned as far back as 1649, even
 before there was a village of         
 Thornhill, only a cluster of houses   
 round the house of a man called       
 Norrie. The building as we know it was
 opened in March 1880. There is a      
 booklet which was written five years  
 ago to commemorate its centenary. The 
 minister is the Rev. Arthur Law. He is
 also our chaplain at school. There are
 264 adherents at present in his       
 church. Of the 52 children in our     
 school, only 20 go regularly to Sunday
 School. Sunday Schol is held after    
 church at 12.30 pm. There is also a   
 bible class for older children.
