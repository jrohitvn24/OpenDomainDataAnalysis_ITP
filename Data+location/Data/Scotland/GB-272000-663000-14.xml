 Our school is called Whifflet primary 
 school and it is in Coatbridge which  
 ic about 7 mles from Glasgow. Our     
 school was built in 1887 and is built 
 of grey stone. We think it would be   
 nice if the stone was cleaned like    
 the buildings in Glasgow. There       
 to be 700 pupils in our school but    
 they built 3 new schools in Coatbridge
 and lots of pupils went to them so    
 they dont have to travel so far. We   
 only have 73 pupils in our school now 
 . The headteacher, Mrs Thorburn       
 teaches p7 and there are 3 other      
 teachers. We have a janitor and an    
 auxiliary who comes in only in the    
 morning. We have a library, an art    
 room, a T.V. room and 4 classrooms.   
 Our playground is big and made of     
 concrete.                             </content>
