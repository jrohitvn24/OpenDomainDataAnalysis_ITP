{CHURCHES :}THERE ARE SEVEN CHURCHES IN
 OUR AREA(3 CHURCH OF SCOTLAND, 1      
 CATHOLIC, 1 EPISCOPAL, 1 BAPTIST AND 1
 CHURCH OF CHRIST). ALL THESE ARE      
 MODERN BUILDINGS, THE OLDEST BEING 30 
 YEARS OLD.                            
{CHRISTIAN :}THE MAIN RELIGION IS THE  
 CHRISTIAN RELIGION, BUT FEWER AND     
 FEWER PEOPLE ACTUALLY ATTEND CHURCH ON
 A REGULAR BASIS OR PRACTISE THEIR     
 BELIEFS.                              
{NON-CHRISTIAN :}NON-CHRISTIAN GROUPS  
 e.g. MORMONS, JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES,    
 MOSLEMS ETC., ARE MINORITY GROUPS AND 
 WOULD MEET IN SMALL HALLS OR PRIVATE  
 HOUSES. THESE MINOR RELIGIONS ARE     
 GENERALLY BETTER SUPPORTED BY THEIR   
 MEMBERS THAN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES.
