		<title>04"TATTIE PICKING" BY BRECHIN</title>
		<content> Unlike most crops{potatoes}are not all
 harvested by machines but many acres  
 are still picked by hand by casual    
 labour-mainly schoolchildren and      
 mothers.Farmers supply transport to   
 the fields in time for an 8a.m. start.
 The day lasts 8 hours with several    
 breaks to eat.It is hectic first thing
 in the morning as the farmer divides  
 the field into{"bits"}to be picked.   
 Younger children can get part bits.   
 The tractor, pulling a digger, turns  
 over the earth revealing the potatoes 
 and the picker puts them into a large 
 plastic basket. Another tractor       
 pulling a{"bogey"(trailer)}collects   
 the potatoes and takes them to the    
 storing shed in wooden boxes.A picker 
 earns a set wage of about{Â£10}a       
 day.The season lasts for three weeks  
 and local schools get an extended     
 autumn holiday.                       </content>
