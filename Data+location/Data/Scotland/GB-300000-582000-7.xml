		<content>      The Brown family has farmed Croft
 Maid for at least forty years and is  
 twenty acres in size. At present one  
 part time pensioner called Jock Bell  
 is employed. On the Croft they have   
 one cat,two bantam cockrels,fifteen   
 banty hens and twenty head of cattle  
 for fattening. They also have one     
 tractor, plough, harrow, roller and   
 muck spreader. They also borrow       
 machinery at hay making time from     
 nearby farms. They grow grass for     
 hay,and kale and turnips for winter   
 feeding of cows. Mrs. Brown does daily
 jobs such as calving, mucking out     
 byres, etc. The farm has 6            
 outbuildings- 2 byres, 3 hay sheds and
 a pig sty ( used as a store).The      
 house got its name from a nearby road 
 called Croche.                        
   The land includes a disused railway 
  last used in 1962 by goods trains.   </content>
