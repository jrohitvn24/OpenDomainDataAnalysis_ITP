		<content>    The medical practice consists of a 
 husband and wife team,living in the   
 neighbouring town of New Galloway and 
 operating a daily surgery in Dalry.   
 They make house calls when necessary, 
 provide emergency cover and dispense  
 medicines. They are assisted by two   
 health visitors who help with home    
 nursing care.A chiropodist visits the 
 town every two months.                
     Hospital treatment usually entails
 a visit to Dumfries and Galloway Royal
 Infirmary in Dumfries though there are
 6 G.P. and 22 geriatric beds in Castle
 Douglas. Most Dalry babies are        
 born at The Cresswell Maternity       
 Hospital, Dumfries. Local volunteers  
 provide a car service when needed     
 for routine appointments at, and      
 visits to hospitals. An ambulance from
 Castle Douglas is available in an     
 emergency.                            </content>
