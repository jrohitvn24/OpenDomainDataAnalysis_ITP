 We believe that the community here was
 formed because of the fertile land.   
 There were two large estates with     
 farms which provided jobs for many    
 people.A century ago the village of   
{Stenton}had a {butcher,a baker,a -    
{grocer,a cobbler,a blacksmith,a pub,  
{a tailor,weavers,a postoffice and a   
{carrier.                              
{   }Apart from the{postoffice}and the 
{pub}all these local businesses have   
 disappeared but{farming}is still the  
 main sourse of employment.The estates 
 employ only gardeners and gamekeepers.
 There are two people still employed in
 the ancient craft of{"dyking"}the     
 building of walls with dry stones.    
     There are three local industries  
 apart from{farming,Torness Nuclear    
{power station,Portland cement works}  
 and{Belhaven brewery.                 </content>
