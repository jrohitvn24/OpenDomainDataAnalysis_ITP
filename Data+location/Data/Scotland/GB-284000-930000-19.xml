		<content> At the beginning of the century many  
 people worked during the summer months
 in the shooting lodges_butlers,       
 footmen,ladiesmaids, housemaids,      
 cooks,kitchen_maids and gardeners.    
 All these people were employed because
 wages were so very low. Many people   
 were employed on the railway_a        
 station-master,porters and surfacemen.
 There were no motor cars to take      
 people elsewhere for entertainment so 
 they danced to fiddle music and       
 enjoyed concerts in the local hall_ an
 ex-army hut which was erected there   
 after the war. There were musical     
 evenings too in the houses. On        
 Saturday nights the young folks met at
 the local shop and had fun. On Sundays
 people walked miles to attend church  
 and the churches were full.           
                                       
                                       </content>
