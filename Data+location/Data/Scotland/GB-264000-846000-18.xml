		<content> In the ancient churchyard of Kilmuir  
 on the north shore of the Firth are   
 many graves of Patersons,all seafaring
 men.Some died or were drowned abroad  
 as long ago as the 18th century.Mr.Jim
 Paterson lives at Tigh na Mara in     
 North Kessock.He was a harbour pilot  
 in the Firth of Inverness,like his    
 father and grandfather.The pilots     
 lived in Craigton on the lower slope  
 of Ord Hill where they could see the  
 Firth from Ardersier and into the     
 harbour.Mr Paterson's two sons go to  
 sea.                                  
 Once a Paterson,an old pilot,met a    
 mermaid on the shore.He took her home.
 While she lived there all would go    
 well and the family would be safe.But 
 after a while she escaped back to sea 
 and took her spell with her.Mr.       
 Paterson is retired now.He keeps a    
 good garden.                          </content>
