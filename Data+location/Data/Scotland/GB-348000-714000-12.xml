		<title>12The Cathedral, St. Andrews</title>
		<content> In the historic town of St. Andrews   
 there are the ruins of an ancient     
 cathedral. It sits beside the sea at  
 the east end of town. Founded in 1160 
 and consecrated in 1318, it was       
 abandoned during the Reformation.     
 Thereafter the ruins were used as a   
 convenient source of stone for house  
 building in the town.The roof and bits
 of the walls are long gone.The visitor
 is free to look around without        
 admission charge. The grounds were at 
 one time the main graveyard of the    
 town and contain a large collection of
 monuments and gravestones. In the     
 Cathedral grounds is St. Rule's       
 Tower.The visitor has to pay to climb 
 to the top.
