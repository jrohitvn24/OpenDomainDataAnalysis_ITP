		<title>14Trade in Barrhead</title>
		<content>{ Trade}in Barrhead is mainly through  
 local shops where we are able to buy  
 most things we need.                  
  One of the large food chain stores   
 (Fine Fare) is presently building a   
 new{supermarket}in Barrhead.This is   
 good for shoppers but unfortunately   
 may force some small shops to close.  
  We have a small{shopping centre}in   
 Barrhead.It consists of a large food  
 shop,a butcher's,a fruit shop, a      
 chemist,a post office, anewsagent's, a
 bank,a travel agent,an optician and a 
 few general purpose stores.           
  Many traders in the town are{local   
 people and some businesses have been  
 in the same family for many years. In 
 the last few years some smaller shops 
 have been bought by Asians who live   
 outwith the area.
