 South West Greenock and Gourock(West) 
 lie on the South West Bank at the     
 mouth of the Firth of Clyde.          
                                       
 The block can be divided into two     
 distinctive areas.To the West we have 
 the sparsely populated Hilly,Moorland 
 and Farmland region.The populated area
 to the east splits into two quite     
 contrasting settlements.The Tourist,  
 residential Town of Gourock to the    
 North whose inhabitants live in       
 predominantly Private Housing.The     
 other populated settlement to the     
 south includes the Districts of       
 Braeside and Larkfield which are      
 Council Estates.Like most other areas 
 in the Inverclyde Region the major    
 cause for Social Concern is that of   
 Unemployment which has increased      
 steadily as Industry has declined..   </content>
