		<content> At midnight on Hogmanay (31st Dec) all
 of the ships and boats in the dock    
 blow their horns to celebrate the     
 beginning of a new year.  To celebrate
 Christmas (25th Dec) some of the local
 shops give presents to local          
 Children's Homes.  Schools sometimes  
 make up food parcels or give presents 
 to pensioners of the area.  Fetes are 
 held regularly within the area.  St   
 Kenneth's school hold a fete to raise 
 money for school funds or charities.  
 The Lady Octavia Park hold a fete     
 every year to help their play scheme. 
 The fetes usually include stalls which
 sell goods such as home baking, food  
 stuffs, second hand goods and books.  
 Also there might be games for people  
 to play and a beauty competition.     
 Many churches hold fetes in           
 summertime.
