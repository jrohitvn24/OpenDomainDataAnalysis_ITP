		<title>01Badcall Bay Sutherland</title>
		<content> Unlike Eddrachelles Bay, Badcall Bay  
 contains many small uninhabited       
 islands.  These islands are fairly    
 rocky; the coastline is even rockier, 
 with only a few smooth bays.  The land
 here is very boggy and marshy and is  
 not farmed.  The village, Upper       
 Badcall extends for about half a mile 
 along a twisty single track           
 unclassified road.  In the village    
 there is a telephone but no post      
 office.  However a moblile bank and   
 shop does visit the village every     
 week.  Just outside the are, in the   
 bay there are sea cages in which      
 salmon are matured.  They are hatched 
 at a hatchery at Duartmore Bridge.    
 There is no permanent shop, school or 
 church in the area.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
