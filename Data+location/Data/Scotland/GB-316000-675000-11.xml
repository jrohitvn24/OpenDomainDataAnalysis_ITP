		<title>11CRAMOND :Gala Day</title>
		<content> The Cramond and Davidsons Mains Gala  
 is a popular yearly event held at D   
 Mains Park which is just outside our D
 Block. We help to prepare and run the 
 stalls and roundabouts and take part  
 in the processions and ceremonies to  
 crown the queen. This was not a year  
 when the queen was chosen from our    
 school but as usual we were pages and 
 attendants. Our PTA ran the Gala      
 Disco. Each year our runners try to   
 win the relay race.                   
 It was a super day on 15 June. My     
 friend and I went along and made a    
 bee-line for the ice-cream tent. There
 was a massive queue for the           
 candy-floss. While searching for my   
 Mum we came across the ball in the net
 competition. This is where you have   
 three shots at a goal-keeper and if   
 you score all three you win a         
 football. We didn't win!              </content>
