		<title>16COLLESSIE QUESTIONAIRE</title>
		<content> A short questionaire was distributed  
 to each household in Collessie. Of the
 21 questionaires distributed only one 
 was not returned. From the survey the 
 population was put at 60 with an      
 average of three per household. The   
 length of time people have lived in   
 Collessie varied from about 1 year to 
 about 70 years. The reasons people    
 gave for living here were the scenic  
 peacefulness and availability of      
 housing in the village. A large       
 proportion of the village's population
 are retired with the working          
 population travelling as far away as  
 Bathgate and Edinburgh. Only a few    
 people worked locally, reflecting the 
 shortage of rural jobs in farms these 
 days. Due to the lack of regular bus  
 services almost everyone travels to   
 work by car.                          
                                       </content>
