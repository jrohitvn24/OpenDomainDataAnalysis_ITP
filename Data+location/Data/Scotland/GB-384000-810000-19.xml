		<title>19Clinterty House</title>
		<content>    {Clinterty House}was built in 1920.
 Behind the house are derelict 
quarries. It is five miles out of 
Aberdeen. It was owned by the Hays of 
Seaton. The house was later inherited 
by his son who married a French lady. 
A farmer later became the owner, but 
sold it to a doctor. He then rented it
out to students, [REDACTED] finally it was split up
into three different houses in the 
1970's.                          
    The people who live there now moved
 there because of the oil and the      
 Airport. All three owners have        
 transport because it would be         
 difficult without it, as the nearest  
 shop is two miles away. They don't    
 have much entertainment, just an      
 occasional visit to the theatre or    
 cinema, and they would be lost without
 the television or the telephone.      </content>
