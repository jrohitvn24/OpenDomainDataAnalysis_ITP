		<title>02The Town of Markinch</title>
		<content> This town,which was a burgh in its own
 right until recently,is fighting to   
 retain its identity as Glenrothes     
 building projects come ever closer.   
 Currently the population of several   
 thousand feel an affinity with their  
 own school,clubs and local institions 
 but they also utilise some of the more
 costly facilities provided only by    
 Glenrothes,such as swimming,cinema and
 the sports centre.The whisky_producing
 and bottling company of John Haig     
 closed lately after more than a       
 century of giving employment to this  
 area.The work people of a good skilled
 type and obtained re-employment more  
 readily than most in these times of   
 great unemployment.The current largest
 employer is the Tullis Russell paper  
 making company.All other firms in the 
 town are small concerns.The local     
 railway station also serves Glenrothes</content>
