		<content> Joe Corrie - 1894-1968 playwrite, poet
 and short story writer.               
                                       
 Joe corrie was born in Slammanan in   
 1894. In 1900 his family moved to     
 Cardenden where his father found work 
 in the local coal mine. At the age of 
 fourteen Joe joined his father at the 
 pit. It aws a hard and often dangerous
 life. When Joe was 20 his father died,
 leaving him to support his mother,    
 sister and younger brothers. When     
 World War One started Joe was sent to 
 work in Mossblowen Colliery in        
 Ayrshire. After the war he returned to
 Cardenden to find no job awaiting him.
 At this time there was deep unrest in 
 the coal fields due to the post-war   
 resesion, unemployment and poor       
 working conditions. There were strikes
 in 1920, 1921 and the general strike  
 in 1926. (cont.)                      </content>
