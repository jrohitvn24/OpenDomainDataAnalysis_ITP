 agricultural area. with one river 'Ale
 Water' running through it. No towns or
 villages occur from good grassland at 
 river levels the hills rise to 900 ft 
 where rougher grasslands occur.       
 There are four major farms in the area
 one farm has a dairy herd of about 80 
 cows, the other farms concentrate on  
 sheep and hill cattle. Most people are
 employed on the farms. A few work in  
 small towns some 5 miles distant.     
 Some old established deciduous woods  
 remain. New conifer woods are planted 
 on higher ground.                     
 Some cereals and root crops are grown 
 Entertainment is found in nearby towns
 and vilages. Most people have cars    
 although buses run on a nearby trunk  
 road
