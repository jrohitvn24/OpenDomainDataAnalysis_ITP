		<content> THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT HOUSE TYPES  
 IN THIS AREA.  FORMER FARM COTTAGES OR
 MINERS' COTTAGES HAVE BEEN RENOVATED  
 AND EXTENDED TO MAKE MODERN FAMILY    
 HOMES.  SEVERAL LARGE FARM HOUSES ARE 
 STILL OCCUPIED BY FARMING FAMILIES.   
 A NEW ESTATE OF 45 HOUSES WAS BUILT IN
 COUSLAND VILLAGE IN 1975-6.  THE      
 STREETS OF DALRYMPLE, STUART AND      
 CRANSTON WERE NAMED AFTER LOCAL       
 PEOPLE.   THE 200 YEAR OLD NORTH      
 LODGE, IN OXENFOORD ESTATE, WAS ONCE  
 OCCUPIED BY THE GREAT, GREAT          
 GRANDFATHER OF A FAMILY, WHO HAVE NOW 
 BOUGHT THE DERELICT HOUSE, TO CONVERT 
 IT ONCE AGAIN INTO A FAMILY HOME.

 HAVE BEEN LIVING IN PATHHEAD FOR SIX  
 WEEKS, WHILE THEIR HOUSES ARE BEING   
 RENOVATED-NEW BATHROOM, KITCHEN,
