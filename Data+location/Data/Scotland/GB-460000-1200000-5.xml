		<title>05Uyeasound Beaches.</title>
		<content> There are a few nice beaches in       
 Uyeasound but there is a particularly 
 attractive  beach that I like in      
 Muness.It is called Sand Wick.        
   One sunny day in 1984 I went up on  
 my cycle with my brother and had a    
 walk on the beach.I went for a swim in
 the sea and made a sand castle.It is a
 sandy and clean beach.                
   At dinner time Mum came up in the   
 car and brought some sandwiches.When  
 she saw we were safe and enjoying     
 ourselves Mum went away.              
   We played on the beach for a long   
 time.We had play fights and pushed    
 each other into the sea.We also buried
 each other in the sand.When we  were  
 bored we went home and had a bath and 
 had tea.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
