 When Granton Ice Plant which had      
 previously supplied ice for the local 
 fishing fleet closed down, Eyemouth   
 decided to build a plant beside the   
 harbour.                              
 It was built 5 years ago in 1980. Its 
 purpose is to supply the boats with   
 ice to keep catches fresh at sea.  The
 ice is made by running water over a   
 refridgerator plate that freezes      
 almost instantly.  When it cracks and 
 falls it is broken up by a large      
 blade.  Every 3 and 3 quarter minutes 
 2 and a half hundred weight of ice is 
 produced.  This is transported down a 
 tube into a lorry and on to the boats.
  Every day 50 tonnes of ice is        
 produced at the plant in the          
 refridgerator, the temperature is     
 16'C.  The water used is fresh.
