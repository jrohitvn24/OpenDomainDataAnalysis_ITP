		<title>15   The Candle Factory.</title>

   The Candle Factory in Linlithgow was
 opened in 1983.Most of the workers are
 female and work part time.They make   
 about 8 thousand candles a day and    
 their biggest order has been 4 million
 candles for Avon the cosmetic firm.The
 wicks and wax come from all over the  
 world but the wax mainly comes from   
 America.The candles are then sent to  
 other countries.                      
  It can take seconds to make small    
 candles and days to make big ones.    
 There are two methods of making       
 candles.One is by dipping or by       
 pouring molten wax into a mould and   
 the other is by compressing powdered  
 wax into shape.The dyed candles are   
 hand carvered by the workers while    
 still warm.
