		<title>14Water Problems</title>
		<content> Acid rain is becoming an increasing   
 problem in our area. It is caused by  
 fumes from motor vehicles and         
 industrial smoke which enters the     
 atmosphere, turning the rain acid. The
 acid is killing off 10% of fish every 
 year. Galloway is one of the most     
 severely affected areas in the world. 
 Another problem is silage effluent    
 from silage pits. This is the juice   
 from the grass which seeps out and    
 finds its way to the river; this      
 kills the food for fish, causing their
 death. In the past two years there has
 been a serious problem  with drought. 
 Last year use of water was restricted 
 with threat of water rationing.       
 Springholm burn stopped flowing       
 altogether. The waterfall at Spottes  
 Glen was reduced to a trickle. Rivers 
 had to be closed to fishers.
