		<title>14COASTAL ECOLOGY, KIRKCALDY</title>
		<content> Although the coastal area to the      
 immediate south of Kirkcaldy is       
 dominated by the surface workings of  
 Seafield Colliery, there is a pleasant
 coastal walk south to Kinghorn.       
 The coastline is predominantly rocky, 
 with sandstones and conglomerates     
 being the most common types to be     
 found. Some of the deposits do contain
 fossils, especially those nearer      
 Kinghorn.                             
 This coastal stretch is also well-    
 known for its offshore birds. These   
 include shags, gannets, terns, and    
 eider ducks etc., as well as different
 varieties of wintering geese.
