		<title>18Home Farm, near Fraserburgh</title>
		<content> Home farm is near Fraserburgh.There is
 the last remaining wing of Philorth   
 house which was built in 1873.That is 
 where the Frasers and Saltouns lived  
 but now the Andersons have taken over 
 the estate.Altogether there are 1200  
 acres,including 116 acres of grass.   
 They grow turnips,wheat,winter barley,
 spring barley,and peas for cattle     
 feed.The barley has not grown well    
 because they were late in sowing due  
 to the wet spring.They need warm      
 weather or they will lose the crop.   
 They keep cattle,sheep and horses.The 
 cattle are kept for their beef.They   
 are mostly crossbreeds.It is important
 to keep dogs on a lead because the    
 farmer found a dog eating a lamb.There
 is a market garden which sells veg.and
 fruit to local shops. Mrs. Anderson   
 said "There's always something        
 happening. Life is never dull."       </content>
