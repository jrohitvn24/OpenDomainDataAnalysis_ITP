		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> Today we went to the beach at Cruden  
 Bay,I asked my mum and dad if Heather 
 Burnett could stay with us.           
      "Yes",said mum.The weather was   
 lovely and hot.My mum's friends and   
 their children,Sharon and Wayne came  
 too.The journey was hard going.We saw 
 a lot of lovely flowers in the        
 gardens.When we got there we took all 
 the gear out of the bus to the beach. 
 The water was cold and shallow.The    
 sand was lovely and soft on the       
 beach.I decided to walk over the      
 bridge to see the clear shallow       
 water underneath. It was beautiful.   
  I played in the sand for a long      
 time.Then I went out to swim with     
 my sisters.The water was very salty in
 the sea.I saw dogs playing in it.They 
 were jumping all over the place.I     
 would like to go again.
