 Airyhall school opened in 1964 and    
 there are now 226 pupils, 114 boys and
 112 girls. There are ten permanent    
 teachers and 5 visiting specialists.  
 There is a secretary, a janitor and 3 
 cleaners. They have a stage, hall,    
 gymnasium, medical room, library and 8
 classrooms. The pupils range from 7 to
 12 years. One third of the pupils walk
 to school and the rest arrive by car. 
 Half take school lunches, 60 take     
 packed lunches and the rest go home.  
 Their football team have won a trophy 
 this year. Other trophies won this    
 year include Scottish country dancing,
 cricket, badminton and choir. At the  
 moment they have four computers but   
 are hoping for more. When the P7 class
 leaves, they mostly transfer to
