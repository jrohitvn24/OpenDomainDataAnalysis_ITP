		<title>10Sancta Maria Abbey, Nunraw</title>
		<content> This is a Cistercian Monastery of some
 30 Scottish, English and Irish monks. 
 Rising at 3.15am and retiring at 8pm  
 they follow the Benedictine rule,     
 their day divided between prayer,     
 community mass, divine office,        
 instruction, study &amp; work. To earn    
 their living, they rear almost 700    
 beef cattle on their 1200 acres,      
 growing barley to feed them. Nunraw's 
 influence on inter church relations is
 acknowleded nationally. But, as       
 contemplative monks, they insist that 
 their sole contribution is prayer.    
 Fr. Abbot is an ex-officio member of  
 the village society and takes a keen  
 interest in village activities.       
 Nunraw Chapel is public, the cloisters
 opened for processions on major feasts
 Countless people visit Nunraw for     
 spiritual help and all are welcomed   
 warmly.                               </content>
