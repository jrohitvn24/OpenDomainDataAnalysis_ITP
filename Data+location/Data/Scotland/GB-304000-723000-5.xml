		<title>05BLACHRUTHVEN FARM (2)</title>
		<content> Is managed jointly with Glendevon and 
 Newhouse farms - a total of 650 acres.
 At present 7 people are employed      
 permanently, half of the number       
 working 20 years ago. Casual labour   
 from Perth works during the summer in 
 the fruit fields. The farm operates a 
 Pick Your Own system - families can   
 have a day out fruit picking and      
 picnicking.                           
 Machinery includes 3 large tractors, 2
 small tractors for work between the   
 berry rows, a plough, harrows, a seed 
 drill and a strawberry planter. These 
 are shared among the three farms.     
 Fields divided by walls are being     
 replaced by fences. Hedges are of     
 hawthorn, ash, sycamore and wild rose.
 An irrigation system is presently     
 being installed. Water will be drawn  
 from the nearby Pow Burn. 1200m. of   
 150cm. pipe is required.              </content>
