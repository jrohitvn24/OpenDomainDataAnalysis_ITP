		<title>08PILTANTON BURN</title>
		<content>  All along the Piltanton, the banks   
 were overgrown with vegetation and in 
 some areas the burn was almost        
 obscured from sight by overhanging    
 reeds. Erosion from map{ref. 062 572} 
 was visible on the right hand bank    
 with a series of small rapids in      
 the burn. No depositon was present (or
 visible) until map{ref. 063 568}.     
  There were several points of         
 geographical interest along the area  
 studied. At the beginning map{ref.    
{057 578}there is a confluence of 3    
 burns, further on the map{ref. 062 572
 the rivers former course was visible. 
 At map{ref. 063 571}there was evidence
 of a disused dam where there was      
 extensive erosion of the banks        
 revealing brick red sandy soil. At the
 end of the section under study there  
 was a small tributary at{map ref. 077 
{565. }                                </content>
