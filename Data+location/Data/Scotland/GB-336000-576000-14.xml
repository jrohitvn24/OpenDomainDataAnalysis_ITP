		<title>14A Typical Day</title>
		<content> On a typical weekday in the school    
 term I get up at 7.45 and get my      
 breakfast for myself (usually it's a  
 plate of cereal). Then I go to my     
 granny's shop to get a pint of milk   
 for the school. We start school at    
 9.00 and we might get RE with Miss    
 Steedman, the infant teacher,followed 
 by sums with our own teacher until    
 break at 10.45. At break we usually   
 play football. After break we might   
 get reading work cards or topic work  
 till lunch at 12.30. I have a packed  
 lunch in school and then play football
 again until 1.30. After lunch we might
 get PE or write a story until break at
 2.30. Then we have another session    
 until school stops at 3.30. Then I go 
 home, get a bite to eat, get changed  
 and go out to play until 5.15 when I  
 come in for tea.Then I play and watch 
 TV until bed time at 10 or 10.30.     </content>
