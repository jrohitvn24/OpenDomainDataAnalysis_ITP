		<title>11Council Housing.</title>
		<content>  In{2868 and 2968,}apart from old     
 Gilmerton village,virtually all the   
 other housing is fairly recent dating 
 mainly from the{195O's and 60s.}      
 Counicl housing schemes  were built to
 house people from condemned           
 inner-city housing.                   
  Building styles include;-            
 (a)semi-detached houses               
 (b)two-storey terraces of four houses 
 (c)low-rise flats,4 or 5 storeys high.
  The short terraces blocks and semis  
 have  gardens front and back,but no   
 provision was  made for garages when  
 they were built.Each block of flats   
 houses approximately{2O}families.     
  In recent years many families have   
 opted to buy their houses from the    
 council.Some small private housing    
 schemes have developed.Houses are     
 being built by "Laing"in a small      
 estate just east of Drum Street.      </content>
