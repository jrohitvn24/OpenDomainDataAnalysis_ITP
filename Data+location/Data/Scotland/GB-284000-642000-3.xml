		<title>03Houses in Our Area</title>
		<content> The houses in the old village of      
 Kirkfieldbank are mostly grey         
 sandstone,cottage_type and larger     
 six and seven roomed houses built     
 around one hundred years ago.There are
 some modern council houses,both       
 terraced and in flats.These are called
 locally the "Electric Flats" because  
 they are fueled entirely by           
 electricity.Other houses may use coal 
 or calor gas .There is no coal gas or 
 natural gas in the village. There is  
 some pleasant private housing in the  
 west end of Lanark included in the    
 survey.There is also a fairly large   
 area of housing just three_quarters of
 a mile to the west of the village,    
 owned by the Council and known as     
 "The scheme"
