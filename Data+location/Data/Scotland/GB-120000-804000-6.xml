 Clanranald imprisoned his wife to     
 prevent her running away with a lover.
 In some versions of the story he      
 rescued her and in others she died    
 there.                                
 The remains of a dam above the old    
 mill are still clearly visible and the
 old stones are lying outside. The mill
 has since been used as a smithy but is
 now just a store.                     
 There are remains of dwellings, wells 
 and querns at the sites of the old    
 settlements all over the island.These 
 ruins and the evidence of the lazy    
 beds and runrigs which still mould the
 landscape are constant reminders of   
 the island's past and previous larger 
 population. Much of this history is   
 kept alive in the oral tradition of   
 the island.
