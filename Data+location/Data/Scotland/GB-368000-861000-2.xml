		<title>02Banff and Macduff</title>
		<content> The town of Banff is situated to the  
 west of the mouth of the River        
 Deveron.Originally it was built for   
 defensive and trading purposes.The    
 only evidence of defence today is the 
 ruined wall of the castle while trade 
 passes through on long distance       
 vehicles.Banff was built around the   
 11th century, whereas Macduff was     
 built only a few hundred years ago on 
 the other side of the river.It is a   
 more industrious town with a very busy
 harbour.                              
 The main historical attraction in the 
 area is Duff House which was designed 
 and built round about 1735 for the    
 first Earl of Fife who owned most of  
 the land at that time. The House is at
 present owned by the National Trust   
 for Scotland and is undergoing a slow 
 process of restoration.
