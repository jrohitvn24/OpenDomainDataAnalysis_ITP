		<content> Four days a week the milkman comes to 
 sell dairy products as well deliver   
 milk.                                 
 The postman delivers the mail every   
 day of the week except Sunday,and will
 deliver papers if you require them.   
 If you wish books to read,the mobile  
 library comes every second Wednesday  
 If you keep a book too long you may   
 have to pay a fine of 20p but that    
 only applies to adults.               
 Other visits are made by the          
 fishmonger's van and the baker's van  
 which are very useful to those people 
 without transport or those who are    
 unable to get out and about.
