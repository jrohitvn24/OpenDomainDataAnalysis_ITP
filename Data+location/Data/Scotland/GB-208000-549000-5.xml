		<title>05INDUSTRY AT SANDHEAD</title>
		<content>   The major industry in the immediate 
 vicinity of Sandhead is Dairy Farming.
 The rearing and nurturing of valuable 
 animals, (milk factories on the hoof),
 is a highly skilled as well as an     
 intuitive job that earns a good man a 
 high wage. The largest proportion of  
 land in our Block is under intense    
 cultivation to support fairly         
 intensive animal stocking in terms of 
 heads per acre.                       
   Most farmers favour the cultivation 
 of grass for silage, (it is cut green 
 and harvested at least twice), because
 it is not so dependent upon the need  
 for fine weather to produce a quality 
 crop. Crops like turnips and kale are 
 grown to be used as fodder in the     
 field as the animals strip graze under
 control of an electrified fence. Some 
 cereals are produced as rotational    
 crops which provide straw and food.   </content>
