 put a high value on their             
 quiet,residential life style.They     
 really appreciate the beautiful {     
{scenery}which surrounds them and are  
 generally tolerant of the             
 tourists,accepting them as an         
 inconvenient necessity.               
 On the whole people are found to be   
 very friendly and helpful,although    
 there is sometimes a slight rivalry   
 between 'locals' and 'newcomers'.It is

 resident for at least 40 years before 
 being fully accepted.                 
 Dislikes about Callander are few.The  
 Amusement Arcade is unpopular,except  
 with its clients;underage drinking is 
 worrying and the closing of the       
 railway is thought to be a mistake.A  
 few people are worried about their    
 lack of privacy in the{small community</content>
