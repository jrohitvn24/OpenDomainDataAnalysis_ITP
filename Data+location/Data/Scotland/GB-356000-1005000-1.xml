		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO DEERNESS (1)</title>
		<content> Section 03561005 covers the greater   
 part of Deerness the{ most easterly   
{parish on the mainland of Orkney.}It  
 is joined by a narrow isthmus of road 
 and sand dunes to the neighbouring    
 parish of St. Andrews and is          
 approximately 12 miles from Kirkwall  
 the main centre of population in the  
 islands. Deerness is principally an   
{agricultural}area of small mixed farms
 owned and worked by the family, and   
 being almost an island has many       
 sheltered{sandy beaches.}There is     
 plenty of{birdlife,}and the area is   
 low lying fertile and treeless, with  
 scattered single storey houses. The   
 fields are not large and are divided  
 by fences.Although there are no hills 
 or lochs to vary the scenery, the     
 beautiful green fields and{abundance  
{of wild flowers}provide one with a    
 sense of nature at its best.          </content>
