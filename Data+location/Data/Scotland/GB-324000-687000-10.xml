		<content> Pupils from the lower part of         
 Kirkcaldy attend the{West Primary     
{School}in Kirkcaldy, and those from   
 Kinghorn attend{Kinghorn Primary.     
 For their secondary education pupils  
 from both areas attend{Balwearie High 
{School,}a six year comprehensive      
 school in Kirkcaldy and one of the six
 secondary scools in Fife to contain a 
 Department of Special Education       
 catering for pupils with learning     
 difficulties.                         
 Since the catchment area for this     
 school is fairly wide it follows that 
 many pupils are bussed to school each 
 day.                                  
 All three schools above are local     
 authority schools administered by Fife
 Regional Council.
