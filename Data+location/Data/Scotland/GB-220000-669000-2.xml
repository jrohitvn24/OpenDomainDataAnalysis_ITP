		<title>02POPULATION OF SOUTH INVERKIP</title>
		<content> Apart from the south of{Inverkip}which
 has around one thousand people living 
 in it, the rest of the area to the    
 south west of Greenock is sparsely    
 populated. However there are a few    
 farms and a large hotel which together
 have a{population}of about 50 people. 
 The farm houses will be between one   
 and two hundred years old. Most of the
 farms will be rented from Sir Houston 
 Shaw Stuart, the owner of Ardgowan    
 Estate which covers most of the area. 
 Most farms are dairy or stock rearing.
 The houses in the south of Inverkip   
 are mainly modern detached bungalows. 
 These are owner occupied and are ten  
 to twenty years old. The bungalows    
 are made of brick and roughcast with  
 slate roofs.
