 The quarry was opened in{August 1983  
 and it has taken 2 years to dig down  
 to a depth of{30ft.}The maximum depth 
 will be 50ft. The reason for not going
 deeper than 50ft is that once the     
 limestone is extracted{the land has to
{be filled in and returned to          
{agricultural use}and a deeper hole    
 would require too much infill.        
                                       
 The quarry uses{nitrate based         
{explosives}packed into the rock and   
 set off by electrically exploded      
 detonators. The holes are filled with 
 soil and rubble to stop rocks being   
 thrown all over the quarry injuring   
 workers and damaging machines.        
                                       
 The quarry uses{large machines}such as
 rock crushers and excavators. The
