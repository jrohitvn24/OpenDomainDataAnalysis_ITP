		<title>05A day of an Ythanwells boy.</title>
		<content> I get up at 8 o'clock, get dressed and
 get my breakfast of cornflakes, milk  
 and toast.Then I go to school in the  
 school car.There we do English and    
 maths until we have a break at 10.45am
 when we eat a packet of crisps.Before 
 lunch we have either music, drama,art,
 phys.education,religious education or 
 swimming.Then we have school lunch.   
 Then we do environmental studies, art 
 and craft and practice our musical    
 instruments.I play the melodica. At   
 15.30 the school car takes me home.I  
 get a drink of orange and change into 
 my playing clothes.I do my homework,  
 go outside to help my father feed     
 the cattle and muck the byre and put  
 straw for bedding in the cattle       
 court.Other cattle get barley and     
 hay.When Dad is working in the field  
 and my brother helps me, we feed all  
 the cattle ourselves.                 </content>
