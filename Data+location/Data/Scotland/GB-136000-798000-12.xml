		<title>12CHURCH ON RHUM</title>
		<content> The church on Rhum is a member of the 
 Church of Scotland. It is part of the 
 Parish of Mallaig and the Small Isles.
                                       
 The minister, who is based in Mallaig,
 visits Eigg, Rhum, Muck and Canna as  
 part of his Parish. The usual minister
 can't always make it because he has   
 such a large Parish to cover so other 
 ministers from the Presbytery visit   
 the island. They visit Rhum once a    
 month during the winter on a Wednesday
 evening and stay till the following   
 morning. In the summer the minister   
 comes fortnightly.                    
                                       
 Weddings and baptisms are also held.  
                                       
 The church service is held in one half
 of the school building which is       
 situated on the southern shore of Loch
 Scresort.                             </content>
