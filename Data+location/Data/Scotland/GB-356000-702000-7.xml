		<title>07The Anstruther Lifeboat</title>
		<content>  The lifeboat"The Doctors",an "Oakley"
 type, self-righting 37ft boat has been
 in service since 1965 as the 6th boat 
 in 120 years. 62 launches saving 24   
 lives have been made but only 1 rescue
 has been made this year. A new boat is
 expected as a shed boat usually lasts 
 25 years. Last winter the lifeboat's  
 refit involved a hard cover cockpit &amp; 
 VHF direction-finding equipment. 7 men
 +2 back-up and 6 launchers make up the
 crew.The mechanic is the only fulltime
 employee. A crew member receives Â£29 a
 year + Â£4 for every exercise. This is 
 not a lot for risking your life! The  
 boat covers an area from the Forth    
 Bridges to the North Sea.             
  The annual Lifeboat Gala will be held
 on July 20th.There will be a raft race
 stalls, parades and a helicopter from 
 Leuchars. We hope a lot of money will 
 be raised.                            </content>
