		<title>01EAST LINTON DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>   East Linton, a long established     
 village of some 600 people, lies on   
 the River Tyne in the rich coastal    
 plain between the Lammermuir Hills and
 the North Sea. The surrounding area is
 mostly used for growing barley, wheat 
 and potatoes.                         
   Important road and rail lines       
 by-pass the village, which is a 30    
 minute drive from Edinburgh, the      
 capital of Scotland. The village has  
 several shops and a Post Office,      
 although many people do shop in the   
 nearby larger towns.                  
   The village is quiet and attractive 
 with much character. It is often the  
 haunt of artists who enjoy painting   
 historic Preston Mill. There is       
 considerable community spirit,        
 resulting in a wide variety of clubs  
 and activities for all ages.
