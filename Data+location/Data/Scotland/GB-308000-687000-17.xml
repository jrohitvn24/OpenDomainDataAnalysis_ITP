		<title>17LIFE STYLES</title>
		<content> There have been many changes in life  
 styles over the past years, for       
 example shopping.  Most people do     
 their shopping once a week or maybe   
 every fortnight.  Many people shop at 
 the two hypermarkets on the outskirts 
 of the town.  Because the majority of 
 families have a refrigerator and a    
 freezer it is possible to keep food   
 for quite a long time and so people do
 not have to go shopping as often as   
 they used to.                         
    Fashions have changed too.  The    
 summer fashion this year is floral    
 designs and pastel colours.  Fashions 
 change quickly nowadays and many      
 people wear an outfit for only one    
 year.  There are few teenage fashion  
 shops in Dunfermline but with the     
 introduction of the new shopping      
 centre that may change soon.
