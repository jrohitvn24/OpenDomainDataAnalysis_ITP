		<title>20DUNDEE LAW</title>
		<content>  {LAW: n. a roundish or conical hill.}
       {(Chamber's Scots Dictionary).  
   The LAW is a volcanic plug, 571     
 feet high, dominating the skyline of  
 Dundee. On the top, there is a{stone  
{pedestal}with a chart that identifies 
 prominent landmarks.                  
   There is also a{war memorial}to     
 commemorate the servicemen who died in
 both World Wars. A beacon is lit each 
 year on{Armistice Day,}the anniversary
 of the{Battle of Loos}and{United      
{Nations Day.                          
   From the top, the whole Tay estuary,
 the hills of Fife and the Sidlaws up  
 to Perth can be seen. There are signs 
 that at one time there was an{ancient 
{hill fort.}(The "dun" of Dundee       
 signifies a hill fort).               
   There used to be a{railway tunnel}  
 going through the hill, but now the   
 tunnel is disused and blocked up.     </content>
