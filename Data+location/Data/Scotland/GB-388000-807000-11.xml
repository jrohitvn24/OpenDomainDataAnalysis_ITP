		<title>11FIGHTING DRUG ADDICTION</title>
		<content> On Tuesday 18 June 1985 the           
 minister for Stockethill church came  
 to talk to us about his work. He often
 helps people who are drug             
 addicts. The most abused drug in      
 Aberdeen is alcohol.Other drugs you   
 can become addicted to are            
 heroine, cocaine and marijuana.The    
 minister goes to meetings in Edinburgh
 and also talks to children at an early
 age about the dangers of drugs to     
 prevent so many children becoming     
 addicts. Sometimes he goes to the     
 homes of young addicts to talk to     
 their parents about how to cope with  
 the problem.I think his job is very   
 important.
