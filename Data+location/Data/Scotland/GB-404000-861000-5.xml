		<title>05Fishing in St Combs   (2)</title>
		<content> The{railway}was used to transport men 
 and{nets}to the{larger ports,         
 otherwise the fishermen would have had
 to move away.                         
 The{railway}also enabled a{shellfish  
 fishery to flourish in{St Combs.      
{Shellfish}from{St Combs}were taken to 
{Fraserburgh}on the{10.30am train}and  
 were in{Billingsgate market}in{London 
 by the morning.100 years ago the whole
 village depended upon fishing,there   
 were{142}boats and{215}fishermen.     
{Herring}fishing was the most          
 important,but{large sailing boats}were
 used instead of{steam}drifters.White  
 fishing was also important,using long 
 lines from small sailing boats working
 from the shore at{St Combs.About 200  
 years ago small sailing boats were    
 able to catch{Cod and Haddock}only a  
 few miles from{St.Combs.}There was no 
{Herring}fishing at this time.         </content>
