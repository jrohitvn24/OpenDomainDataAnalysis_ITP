		<title>20POLWARTH FAIR</title>
		<content> THE ANCIENT POLWARTH FAIR WAS HELD AT 
 THE TIME OF ST MUNGO'S FEAST DAY IN   
 MID-JANUARY &amp; WAS KNOWN CHIEFLY FOR   
 FOOTWEAR. POLWARTH WAS A VILLAGE      
 RENOWNED FOR ITS SOUTARS OR COBBLERS. 
 IT MAY HAVE BEEN ON ONE OF THESE      
 OCCASIONS THAT ONE OF THE PACKMEN WAS 
 MURDERED ON THE SLOPING ROAD LEADING  
 DOWN FROM THE VILLAGE TO THE CHURCH.  
 IT IS KNOWN AS PACKMAN'S BRAE TO THIS 
 DAY &amp; THE SITE OF THE CRIME IS MARKED 
 BY A STONE. IT MAY BY SAID THAT THERE 
 IS CURRENTLY NO CRIME IN THE PARISH   
 BUT THEN THERE ARE NOT SO MANY PEOPLE 
 .
