		<title>06Cults Church</title>
		<content> For at least 800 years Cults Church   
 has been standing in the tiny         
 community of{Kirkton of Cults.}In     
 early times Cults was spelt "Quilque",
 "Cultis",or "Quiltis".                
 The present building was erected in   
 1793 and has changed little.A steep   
 stone stair climbs the outside west   
 wall up to the belfry.The inside of   
 the small church is simply furnished  
 with a gallery all the way round.     
 On the walls inside the church are    
 several memorials to the famous       
 "Wilkie" family.{Rev.David Wilkie}was 
 minister of the parish in 1774-1812.  
 The present minister is the{Reverend  
{Iain Forbes}, who is minister to four 
 combined parishes including Cults.Thus
 the church is no longer regularly in  
 use.
