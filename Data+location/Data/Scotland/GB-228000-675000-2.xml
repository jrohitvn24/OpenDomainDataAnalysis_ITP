		<content> The most popular spectator sport is   
 football.  Teams in Scotland are      
 divided into Leagues, the Premier,    
 First and Second according to ability.
 Teams move up and down these leagues  
 depending on how well they play.  The 
 local team Greenock Morton, whose     
 colours are blue and white play at    
 Cappielow Park, situated in the East  
 End of Greenock.  As they have just   
 been relegated to the First Division  
 they no longer attract as large a     
 crowd as they once did, but they are  
 still managing to survive.  Apart from
 football there is no other regular    
 spectator sports' arenas in the area. 
 However, because of television many   
 other sports are popular and compete  
 with football eg Snooker, darts and   
 horse racing.
