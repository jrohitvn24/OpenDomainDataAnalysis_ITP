		<content>   About 30% of our area is covered by 
 trees mainly{Scots Pine.}They add a   
 great deal to the beautiful scenery   
 but they are not grown for that       
 purpose. They are a{crop to}be sold to
 sawmills or pulpmills after 15-30     
 year's growth. The timber is then used
 for building purposes, palets,        
 boat-building,railway sleepers or     
 furniture. Pulp is used to make paper.
   A forester's work involves          
 collecting and extracting the seeds,  
 preparing nursery beds where the seed 
 is sown, then weeding. The seedlings  
 are then transferred to lines where   
 they grow for 1-2 years. They are then
 ready to be planted out in the woods. 
   Roughly{40-50 acres}are planted     
 every year with Scots Pine on dry     
 sites,{Norway Spruce}and{Sitka}on wet 
 sites and{Lodgepole Pine}on poorest   
 soils.                                </content>
