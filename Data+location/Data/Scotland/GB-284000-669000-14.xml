		<title>14LIMERIGG FORESTRY</title>
		<content> Two sections of land,covering more    
 than 400 acres,have been planted by   
 the Forestry Commission. Lodge-Pole   
 Pines were planted on deep peat while 
 Sitka Spruce  were planted on the     
 shallower peat. There are also some   
 Larch trees on the outskirts of the   
 forest. The planting took place in the
 early 1960's. At that time each pupil 
 of our school planted a tree which was
 then ringed with the child's name.    
 Until the late 1970's,forestry workers
 lived in the village and worked       
 locally but now all work is directed  
 from Aberfoyle. The forest is         
 plentiful in wild life. One might see 
 the grey squirrel,deer,rabbits/hares, 
 foxes,birds etc. There are several    
 pathways through the forest which     
 provide popular walks for the local   
 residents.                            
                                       </content>
