		<title>19THORNHILL THE SMOKE HOUSE</title>
		<content> The Smoke House used to be a meal-mill
 called Cessintully Mill.The waters    
 which flowed from several upland      
 streams were dammed up until required 
 to flow swiftly and turn the mill     
 wheel.This method is not,of course,   
 used today.Now it is a smoke          
 house,smoking mainly trout and salmon 
 and some eels.The smoke is made by    
 burning oak chips from American whisky
 barrels;this flavours the fish which  
 are  hung up in rows and "cooked" by  
 the smoking.There is a good market for
 this product today.Hotels and         
 restaurants buy it for their          
 clients.We can buy it at the mill but 
 it is expensive.
