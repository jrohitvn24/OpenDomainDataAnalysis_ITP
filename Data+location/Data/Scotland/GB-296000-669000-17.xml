		<content>       In this area there are 7 large  
 farms.   We found, from our land      
 survey that most of the surrounding   
 land is rough grazing land.   On this 
 land many farmers will graze cows, as 
 that is the only animal that will eat 
 such coarse grass.                    
      I have chosen one small farmstead
 out of all the large farms to write   
 about.   On this farmstead live       
 husband and wife, who breed rabbits   
 and goats.   The goats produce many   
 litres of milk per day.   There are 18
 goats on the farmstead and ten of them
 produce milk.                         
      The rabbits are bred for their   
 meat and their fur.   The meat is sold
 to the butcher.   Another thing they  
 do is take their horse up to a country
 park, just outside this area.   They  
 charge 50p for a ride with the horse  
 and cart, round the park.             </content>
