		<title>17SUMMER FARMING IN ETTRICK.</title>
		<content>   In late April or May the hill ewes  
 start lambing and the early lambs are 
 cut.By the end of May all the ewes    
 should have lambed.                   
   In June the hill cows and calves go 
 out to the hill along with the bull.  
   July is the time that the sheep are 
 sheared and counted.In late July some 
 of the crops are cut for silage.The   
 hay isn't made till August when it is 
 warm and dry and the grass can dry out
 before being baled.August is the time 
 when the sheep are dipped and the     
 lambs are sold.In September the tups  
 go out to the old ewes so that they   
 lamb first.The tups and bullocks are  
 sold in October and any new tups are  
 bought.
