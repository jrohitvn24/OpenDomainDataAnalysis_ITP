  {The River Cree}starting as the      
 Farden Burn,rises at Palmaddie Hill,  
 which is situated just north of       
 Glentrool.The river has many          
 tributaries,the largest of which are  
 the Minnoch and the Penkiln Burn.When 
 it reaches the end of its journey it  
 enters Wigtown Bay.The largest town   
 situated on the Cree is Newton        
 Stewart.With its many bends and curves
 the river is said to spell its name.  
 The Cree has its own song"The Bonnie  
 Banks O' Cree"written by a local      
 person.It is also mentioned in the    
 song "Bonnie Galloway."
