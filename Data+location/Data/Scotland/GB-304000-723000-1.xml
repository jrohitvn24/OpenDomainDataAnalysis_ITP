 The village is two and a half miles   
 west of Perth. There are twenty one   
 houses, some new and some old cottages
 modernised. No shops remain but there 
 is a hall which belonged to Tibbermore
 church - both now closed. West        
 Huntingtower has several buses passing
 through the village - Midland Scottish
 runs services to Pitcairngreen and St.
 Fillans by Crieff and Comrie, and     
 occasionally Tibermore. J.Duff and    
 Sons runs a local bus to Crieff and   
 Madderty, and Stagecoach runs via     
 Tibbermore to Auchterarder at school  
 times. A traffic count at mid morning 
 gave sixty eight vehicles going west  
 and fifty seven going east, a total of
 one hundred and twenty five in ten    
 minutes.
