		<title>06  Leon Garfield's Visit</title>
		<content> Leon Garfield the famous author of    
 childrens books such as 'Jack Holborn'
 visited our school on the 7th of May  
 1985.The visit had been arranged by   
 the local members of the Federation of
 Childrens Book Group.They are trying  
 to encourage children to read more and
 they thought a way of doing this would
 be to have the children meet a well   
 known author.                         
   When Mr Garfield arrived he was     
 shown into the hall where we waited   
 impatiently.I could only see the top  
 of his head because I was sitting at  
 the back.When I stood up to ask a     
 question I was surprised at his       
 appearence.He wore a purple shirt a   
 green suit and a red and white bow tie
     He comes from London and at first 
 we found his accent difficult to      
 understand but he answered all our    
 questions.I really enjoyed it.        </content>
