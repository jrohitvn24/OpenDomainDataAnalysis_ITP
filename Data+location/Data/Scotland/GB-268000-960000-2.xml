		<title>02INVERNAVER NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content> The Invernaver Nature Reserve is      
 situated just west of Bettyhill and   
 covers 1,363 acres.  It was declared a
 Reserve on 27 October 1960.  Visitors 
 to the Reserve are not allowed to     
 collect specimens or disturb nesting  
 birds, and must be careful not to     
 start fires.                          
 The Reserve's most interesting        
 features are the plants of the blown  
 shell-sand, the shingle terraces in   
 the estuaries, and the archaeological 
 sites on these terraces.              
 Many rare and interesting plants grow 
 on the Reserve because of the         
 different types of soil. Different    
 plants like different places to live -
 some need wet ground, some like sandy 
 soil and some grow on rocks.          
 Invernaver Reserve is important       
 because of the mountain plants which  
 grow by the seashore.                 </content>
