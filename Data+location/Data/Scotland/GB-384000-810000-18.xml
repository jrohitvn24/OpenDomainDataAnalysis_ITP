     People said they had lived in the 
 countryside for many years. All the   
 people interviewed kept pets. No one  
 was lonely and travelled into Aberdeen
 as little as possible. They bought in 
 bulk, usually at Asda, a Superstore 4 
 miles away.                           
    The fish man, butcher, baker called
 once a week. Locals have hardly any   
 contact with the Airport, using it    
 when they go abroad on holiday. They  
 experience no noise from the Airport. 
    Surprisingly, the local people     
 report there have been only a few     
 changes in the whole time they have   
 lived in the area. Only the           
 construction of houses and the College
 of Agriculture at Craibstone changed  
 the surrounding countryside. No one   
 has a desire to live in Aberdeen,     
 prefering the peace of the country.   </content>
