 occupied Hallyard until 1616, when,   
 the Palace and Lands were passed to   
 the Boswells',who sold it to William  
 Forbes of Craigievar. In 1627 the     
 estate was again passed over - tothe  
 Skeene family. The Skeene family kept 
 the estate until 1715 when because the
 estate was so heavily encumbered, it  
 was resigned to the Earl of Moray. The
 Palace was allowed to become a ruin - 
 stones were taken to repair the parish
 Church - until there are now only a   
 few stones to mark its site.
