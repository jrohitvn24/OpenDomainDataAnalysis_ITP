		<title>10PLEASURELAND IN ARBROATH</title>
		<content> On May 14th 1985.we heard that        
 Pleasureland was reopening after its  
 winter break thanks to a local radio{ 
{communication}.On May 18th.we took our
 bikes down.Richard's dad was the first
 on the dodgems.Richard had to pay for 
 both of us to get on.It was quite busy
  because a lot of people had heard of 
 the {event}.We had a lot of fun       
 bumping into each other on the        
 dodgems.Then we went on the ghost     
 train which is popular with most of   
 the{tourists}but a little bit scary,  
 especially when the skeleton touched  
 Alan.We left the ghost train and went 
 on to the arcade games.Richard was on 
 the Turbo,a racing car game,Alan was  
 on a Star Wars game,and Richard's dad 
 was on the pinball.Lots of people seem
 to enjoy their{recreation}at          
 Pleasureland.
