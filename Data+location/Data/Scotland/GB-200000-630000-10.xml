		<content>    The standard of education in       
 Lamlash has risen considerably from   
 when it was first opened as a         
 secondary school.It was only from 1971
 that pupils did not have to make the  
 trip to the Isle Of Bute to study for 
 Higher passes.Until 1971 the school   
 was only able to cope with O_Grade    
 tuition.                              
    It is now possible to sit Highers  
 from a choice of English,Music,Art and
 Design,Food and Nutrition, Biology,   
 Chemistry,Physics,Geography,History,  
 Modern Studies,Technical Drawing and  
 Mathematics.The staff consists of 32  
 teachers and two laboratory           
 technicians.There is also the         
 possibility of taking sixth year study
 subjects.
