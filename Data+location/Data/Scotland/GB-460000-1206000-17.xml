		<title>17Trouble with Trolls.</title>
		<content> Trolla water is behind the school.It  
 probaly got its name from the vikings.
 The vikings were very superstitious   
 people.A viking must have drowned in  
 the loch and the vikings didn't       
 believe man would have done it.So they
 decided it was a troll(which is a     
 little green man).Trolla water means  
 water of the wee men.In the olden days
 the 20 of December was called Tammas  
 Mass e'en which meant St.Thomas Eve.On
 this day the trolls were supposed to  
 appear.Nobody dared to go out that    
 night because they might be caught by 
 the trolls. On one 20th of December a 
 man set out to see his lady love in   
 Burrafirth.Everybody warned him not to
 go to see her as the trolls would get 
 him.But he didn't listen and went.From
 then on he was never seen again.
