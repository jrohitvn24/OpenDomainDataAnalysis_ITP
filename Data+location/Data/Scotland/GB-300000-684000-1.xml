		<content> The grid we have been studying, is    
 situated in Fife Region. It is a      
 mainly rural area, but contains four  
 small villages along the coast of the 
{River Forth. }There are three farms _ 
 Bullions, Bankhead, and Drumfin _     
 mainly{arable farms with a few        
{cattle. }The only fresh water is Loch 
 Roy, situated to the north of         
 Newmills.                             
 The largest village is{High           
{Valleyfield}in the north west corner }
 of the grid.It boasts a Community     
 Centre and a Health Centre, which     
 serve the surrounding villages.It is  
 a predominately mining village, but   
 now that Valleyfield Colliery has     
 closed down,{unemployment}is high.Many
 miners work in other pits and during  
 the Miner's Strike of 1984/85 feelings
 ran high.
