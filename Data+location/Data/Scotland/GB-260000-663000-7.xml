		<title>07     Parkhead Garage.</title>
		<content> Today, Mrs. Fryer and Mrs. Scouler    
 took us to the garage at Parkhead     
 where we met Mr. Shepard, the Traffic 
 Superintendant.There was a big        
 blackboard to tell the drivers what   
 bus to drive, and where to park.      
 Mr. Shepard showed us a Microbus,     
 which has facilities for people in    
 wheelchairs.They can pick you up at   
 your front door.Then we found out that
 L.A. on buses means Leyland Atlantean,
 the make of the buses.                
 In the main part of the depot he      
 showed us their new Apricot Computer  
 to record their bus drivers day on a  
 disk called a modular disk.In the cab 
 their is a Wayfarer Machine which     
 feeds information into the computer.  
 There is one for each day to record   
 the information on tickets and money. 
 If they make a mistake it highlights  
 it on the screen.                     </content>
