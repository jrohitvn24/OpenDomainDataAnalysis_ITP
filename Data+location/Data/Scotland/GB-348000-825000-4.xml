		<content> FOOTBALL                              
 My hobby is football.   I play for    
 several teams including the Scout Team
 the school team and a team in the boys
 league.   I play once every week in   
 the boys league.   Even sometimes     
 twice.   Neill Knox                   
 KARATE                                
 My hobby is kartae.   I joined a club 
 in Huntly and I am an orange belt.    
 There is a training two nights a week 
 and two hours non stop every night so 
 it is tiring.   Neil Paterson.        
 SCOUTS                                
 The Rhynie Scouts starteed in October 
 in October of '84.   During this time 
 we hope have been on camps and        
 competitions.   Our Scout leader is   
 Mr. Hall who was in the Army.   On    
 some days we have parties or          
 campfires.   Stuart Hunter.
