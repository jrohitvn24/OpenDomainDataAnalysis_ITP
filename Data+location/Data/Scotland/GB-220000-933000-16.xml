		<title>16Crofting at Unapool</title>
		<content>  One of the crofters at Unapool has   
 been crofting for over sixty years. He
 remembers as a boy helping his parents
 look after their one cow _ a necessity
 for fresh milk in those days _ and    
 eight sheep-the most the local farmer 
 would let them keep.                  
  Now he has a flock of 150 sheep, all 
 Cheviots, a  breed introduced from    
 the Borders at the time of the        
 Clearances. His lambing takes place in
 April and he hopes for about 90 lambs,
 depending on the weather conditions.  
 The females he keeps,the males and old
 ewes he sells at the Dingwall sales in
 September. His busiest time is from   
 July to October when he is either     
 gathering, clipping, dipping or       
 marking.                              
  Our crofter likes the hill work best_
 when he is out all day with only his  
 dogs for company.                     </content>
