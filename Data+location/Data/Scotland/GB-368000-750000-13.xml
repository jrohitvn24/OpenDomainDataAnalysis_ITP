		<title>13LUNAN BAY, TOURISM.</title>
		<content> Thousands of visitors every year come 
 to Lunan Bay. These are  in the       
 main day visitors,for the only        
 residential accommodation is at  the  
 Lunan Bay hotel and the occasional    
 holiday cottage to rent. There is no  
 provision for caravans or camping     
 though at times boy scouts have       
 obtained permission from the farmer to
 camp in a field adjacent to the beach.
 The long sandy beach is ideal for     
 children who also enjoy paddling in   
 the gently shelving sea. Swimming in  
 the sea is inadvisable due to the     
 currents formed by the river Lunan    
 entering the sea at this point. The   
 sand dunes make ideal sun bathing and 
 picnic spots.Recently a car park has  
 been built close to the beach. Duck   
 boards have also been put down over   
 the sand dunes; this not only eases   
 walking but also protects the dunes.  </content>
