		<title>02PATRON SAINT OF LOSSIEMOUTH.</title>
		<content> St.Gerardine  arrived in this area in 
 934 A.D.His real name is said to be   
 Garnat but his Latin name is          
 St.Gervadius.Some people say that he  
 is Irish whilst others say that he is 
 from the N.E.His cave was hewn from   
 the rock face and it is here that the 
 War Memorial can now be seen.In the   
 18th century,when stones were quarried
 from there for building,his cave      
 disappeared.St.Gerardine patrolled    
 the shore where the harbour is now,   
 with a lantern,which shone on the     
 breakers to warn sailors of the       
 danger.When Lossiemouth became a      
 burgh,the Town Council chose          
 St.Gerardine and his lamp to grace the
 Burgh Seal.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
