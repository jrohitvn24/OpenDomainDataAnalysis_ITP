 LANDSCAPE                             
     Bowershall is a hamlet lying 5 km 
 north of Dunfermline in West Fife. The
 land is mainly hilly ranging from 150 
 metres at Meldrums Mill burn to 249   
 metres at Roscobie Hill. There are    
 several small burns.                  
     The land is used mainly for hill  
 sheep farming and cattle rearing with 
 cultivated grass covering the largest 
 percentage of the land. Crops such as 
 barley, hay and silage are also grown.
 Throughout the area there are many    
 indications that coal mining and      
 quarrying such as Redcraigs Quarry    
 were important in the past but none is
 carried out now.
