		<content> In the village there are 4 holiday    
 cottages which are let out mainly for 
 the summer or fishing season. Gartly  
 is ideally situated for touring around
 the area.It has several distilleries  
 and several ancient buildings close   
 by, and has easy access to the coastal
 towns or mountains.  Most of the      
 fishing is done in the Huntly waters  
 but the River Bogie at Gartly does    
 afford some sport.
