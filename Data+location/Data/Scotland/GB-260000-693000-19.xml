		<title>19SEASONAL WORK ON THE FARM</title>
		<content> The seasonal programme for the farmer 
 begins with ploughing, normally done  
 between January and April. Some       
 ploughing, however, occurs as early as
 November to expose the bare earth to  
 the winter weather. Muck spreading    
 follows and then harrowing, seeding   
 and rolling are done in March or      
 April. Crop spraying follows in May or
 June. Silage is taken in June and hay 
 usually in July, although haymaking   
 can occur a little earlier if the     
 weather is particularly fine.Cereals  
 are harvested in August or            
 September,root crops in October. A    
 variety of chemicals_nitrogen,        
 phosphates, lime etc_are added to the 
 soil, and chemical sprays are used to 
 suppress weeds, mildew and insect     
 pests.
