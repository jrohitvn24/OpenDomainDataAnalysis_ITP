		<content>  Kilchrenan is a good place for bird  
 spotting. Since the second of march I 
 Have seen 75 different kinds of       
 birds. Some I have never seen before  
 in my life, like the spotted-         
 flycatcher, and the redwing.          
  The spotted flycatcher is a small    
 brownish bird with dark brown speckles
 on its breast. When the redwing       
 settles you can see a red blob under  
 its wings.                            
  I have only seen 4 different birds of
 prey this year, the kestrel, the      
 merlin, the buzzard and the sparrow-  
 hawk.                                 
  Both merlin and kestrel hover to spot
 their prey, the buzzard perches on    
 telegraph poles or trees to spot its  
 prey and the sparrow-hawk swoops on   
 its prey. Last year I saw the         
 hen-harrier, the the golden eagle and 
 the peregrine falcon.                 </content>
