		<content>{CULL OF HERRING GULLS}                
 This year, following complaints to the
 council about flocks of herring gulls 
 attacking children the problem was    
 investigated and the decision was     
 taken to carry out a cull.  Apart from
 the danger of aggressive gulls during 
 the nesting season, property owners   
 complained of gulls nesting on the    
 roofs and houses.  Owners were annoyed
 by gulls doing a lot of damage both to
 property and gardens.  Their droppings
 were a local nuisance, and when       
 droppings fell into chimneys moss     
 eventually grew on them blocking the  
 chimneys.  It was decided to reduce   
 the number of herring gulls by        
 destroying eggs.  This was done last  
 year but was not effective enough.  It
 is hoped that this effort will succeed
 in reducing the number by 25%.
