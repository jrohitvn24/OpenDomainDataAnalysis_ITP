		<content> Very fertile,with a southern exposure,
 the land is good for mixed farming.   
 Wheat and barley still grown,but now  
 mostly vegetables, planted by         
 machinery.  One farm uses an          
 artesian well.  A helicopter is used  
 for crop spraying.  A new crop,oil    
 seed rape,fills the fields with gold. 
 After harvesting it is carried in     
 tanks as it is a wet crop.  It is     
 dried at Authermuchty.  Some sheep and
 cattle are fattened but not bred.     
 Seed potatoes are grown, including a  
 specially large variety called Great  
 Britts;  Carefully dressed they sell  
 for twice the price.  The Latest      
 in farm machinery is used here.  A    
 flourishing market garden supplies our
 fruit and vegetable shop.
