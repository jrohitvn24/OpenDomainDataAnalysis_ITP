		<title>12Rogart - Trade (Post Office)</title>
		<content>  Everybody in Rogart uses the Post    
 Office (commonly known as the P.O.).  
 Until 1979, the P.O. was in the Cross 
 House. Today, it is in a specially    
 built building.                       
  Mr Mackenzie owns the P.O.. He       
 employs four full-time workers and    
 four part-time workers. It is not only
 a Post Office, but stocks everything  
 you can think of (from a thimble to a 
 giant panda). He supplies the         
 community's groceries.                
  It is open from Monday to Saturday   
 every week of the year. On Thursday   
 afternoon it is closed, but reopens at
 4p.m. to supply everybody with the    
 local Sutherland newspaper - "The     
 Northern Times" or "Raggie" as        
 everyone calls it.                    
  In the winter-time some people walk  
 to the P.O.. If you can't walk there, 
 neighbours will help ypu.             </content>
