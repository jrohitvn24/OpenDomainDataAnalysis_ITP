		<content>   Our Winters are not as severe as    
 in some areas of Scotland but it is   
 possible to get icy road conditions   
 from November onward.An extremely hard
 frost early this year froze filters at
 Loch Fada and the village was without 
 mains water for many hours! We usually
 have at least a little snow(some years
 worse than others) but it is rare that
 roads become blocked by snowfall.     
   However, when gales strike we some- 
 times get roads blocked by fallen     
 trees &amp; power &amp; telephone lines down. 
   Rainfall (recorded 7 miles away at  
 Kilmartin) for the 4 yrs '81-'84 gives
 an annual average of 1580.275mm. The  
 greatest monthly fall 296.4mm (Oct 83)
 least 14.5mm(May 84). We do get 'good'
 weather,particularly May/early Autumn,
 but high humidity brings the scourge  
 of the West Coast:- the dreaded midge!
 We get some fine, clear starry nights.</content>
