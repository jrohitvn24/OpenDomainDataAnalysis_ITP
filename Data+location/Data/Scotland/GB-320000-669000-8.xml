		<title>08A REFUGEE FROM VIETNAM</title>
		<content>  I was not born here, I was born in   
 Vietnam. I got here in a boat. I      
 remember when I was very young in     
 Vietnam that my Gran looked after me. 
 My Dad worked in a place where he made
 noodles, and I used to go there and   
 eat some of the noodle and then fall  
 asleep on top of the pile of noodles  
 then when I woke up I had flour all   
 over my face. I had to go to school   
 and I learnt to dance and sing and    
 manners. I only had two friends in    
 Vietnam. Then one day I had to go away
 in a boat. My Gran did not want me to 
 go with my parents; she wanted to keep
 me with her. It was so cramped on the 
 boat because there were a lot of      
 people. It was horrible in the boat.  
 We had the best part of the boat. We  
 were in the middle of the boat, some  
 people had to stay on the top of the  
 boat and they might fall off.         </content>
