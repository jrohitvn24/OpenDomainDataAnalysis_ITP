		<title>04Green Belt Area (EK North)</title>
		<content>   North of East Kilbride are low hills
 of about 200m - the Cathkin Braes.    
 This area is designated as Green Belt 
 to separate the New Town from Glasgow.
 It is mainly used for dairy and beef  
 cattle though some parts are left wild
 because of bare rock and poor soils.  
 Although the Green Belt should be pre-
 served as countryside there are some  
 small developments such as Philipshill
 Hospital built before the Belt was de-
 signated, electricity pylons crossing 
 fields to College Milton industrial   
 estate, caravan storage on a farm at  
 Kittochside which spoils the view, a  
 cleansing department dump in a disused
 quarry, and Rolls Royce test beds for 
 the testing of aeroplane engines.     
   Surprisingly, considering the       
 overall level of amenities in the     
 town, there are no recreational       
 facilities in this particular area.   </content>
