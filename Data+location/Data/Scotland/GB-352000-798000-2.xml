		<title>02Language in Aboyne</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Aboyne{dialect}departs only       
 slightly from the general             
 Aberdeenshire dialect which owes much 
 to the ancient{language}of Gaelic,    
 itself very similar to modern German, 
 both in{accent}and individual{words.} 
 It consists of a strange mixture of   
 English and old Scots, although       
 phrases like "whit like" (pronounced  
 "Fit like") meaning "How are you?" are
 still commonly heard.  Nowadays the   
 dialect is much diluted due to the    
 influx of English and Americans into  
 the area, and now the broadest strain 
 is only heard when older locals meet. 
 Continuity in the language has been   
 largely lost due to school_taught     
 English although many teachers have   
 now begun to introduce the Scottish   
 language into the English course.
