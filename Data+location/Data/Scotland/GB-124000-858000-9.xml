		<content> All houses in this section are        
 detached. Many are new, some are dated
 between the two World Wars and a few  
 are houses, which originally had      
 thatched roofs. All are stone         
 built. All, but one house have slate  
 or tiled roofs; the other has a zinc  
 roof. Thatched roofs were very hard to
 maintain. They needed constant        
 maintenance. However the houses       
 themselves were very cosy and warm in 
 the winter and lovely and cool in     
 summer. Very few houses have          
 doorbells. Most houses have open      
 fires. Nearly all houses have a mains 
 water supply and are connected to the 
 national grid for their electricity. A
 few houses have their own water supply
 from either a well or spring. All     
 roofs need to slope since we get so   
 much rain here. Flat roofs would be of
 little use.                           </content>
