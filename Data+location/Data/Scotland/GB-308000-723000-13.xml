		<title>13INDUSTRY IN PERTH</title>
		<content>  Industry in Perth is thriving. This  
 we discovered after a survey along the
{Lade,}an inland waterway running under
 the{City Mills Hotel,}which retained  
 the waterwheel when it was converted  
 from an old mill. This area has a high
 percentage of city centre industry.   
  Several{builders merchants}and       
{contractors}have settled along the    
 Lade and they say that despite keeping
 the workforce down to avoid cutbacks, 
 business is brisk although competion  
 is sometimes hard to beat. Many       
 companies agreed that a smaller       
 workforce enables them to give their  
 employees higher wages and more       
 overtime.                             
{ Car repairs}and{tyre services}also   
 figured along the Lade as did a{coach 
{repairs service}which had only 5      
 employees, all on overtime.Despite 1  
 redundancy,business is booming.       </content>
