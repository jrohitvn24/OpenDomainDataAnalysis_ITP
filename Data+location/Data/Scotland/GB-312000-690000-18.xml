		<title>18Housing in Hill of Beath</title>
		<content> Much of the housing in our village is 
 council housing.These are mainly      
 terraced and semi-detatched           
 houses.Recently some of the houses    
 were renovated.Next door to the school
 is the old schoolhouse which the      
 headmaster used to live in but it is  
 no longer used by headmasters.Opposite
 the school three new bungalows have   
 been built,but only one is occupied   
 yet.Most houses have their own gardens
 and some years ago Hill of Beath won  
 an award for being the best kept      
 village in Fife.Atthe top of Main     
 Street are a group of flats with three
 storeys in them.Very few of the houses
 have garages so cars take up a lot of 
 road space.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
