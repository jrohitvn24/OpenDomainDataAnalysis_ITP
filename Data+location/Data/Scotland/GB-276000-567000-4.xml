		<title>04The Galloway Cow</title>
		<content> The Galloway cattle have been found in
 the south_west of Scotland for        
 centuries.  It is said that the       
 Galloway was never crossed with any   
 other breed and so is the oldest breed
 of cattle in Britain.                 
 The animals are very hardy and can    
 adapt to the most severe conditions of
 wind, snow and cold.  Their heavy hide
 and long, thick, waterproof coat      
 protects them.  Galloways are good    
 grazers and can exist on coarse       
 grasses that would not support other  
 breeds.                               
 The Galloway is used for beef. They   
 are fed from little calves and after  
 about a year they are fat enough to be
 killed. Only a few cows and a bull are
 not killed but are kept for breeding  
 purposes.
