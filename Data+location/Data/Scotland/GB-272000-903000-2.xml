		<content>  From The Bank downwards, the road is 
 lined with birch and blackthorn trees.
 On the banks of the Corry Burn wood   
 anemones, celandines, daisies,        
 violets, daffodils and primroses      
 abound.                               
  The low ground is covered with rough 
 grazing. When we climb a little, the  
 hillside is covered with heather, some
 of which has been burned recently.    
  Grazing in the fields are Cheviot    
 sheep and Hereford, Aberdeen Angus and
 Shorthorn cattle.                     
  Rabbits are in plentiful supply.     
 Indeed, the crofters have erected a   
 rabbit fence in an attempt to keep    
 them off the grazing areas.           
  There are a great number of birds    
 here. The most notable being          
 ospreys,eagles and sparrow-hawks.     
 Foxes, roe-deer, red deer and Scottish
 wild cats are common.                 </content>
