		<title>02ADDIEWELL-HOW IT BEGAN</title>
		<content>    The village of{Addiewell}lies in   
 the Breich Valley midway between West 
 Calder and Blackburn.                 
    Although it is a depressed area    
 today that has not always been the    
 case,for in the late nineteenth and   
 early twentieth centuries Addiewell   
 was the centre of the world's oil     
 industry thanks mainly to the efforts 
 of{James "Paraffin" Young.            
    In 1865 Young first produced oil   
 from shale and set up his distillation
 plant at a 70 acre site in Addiewell  
 where he employed over 2000 people    
 producing paraffin,oil,wax,candles    
 etc.                                  
    Sadly after World War Two it became
 too expensive to produce oil from     
 shale and the industry gradually died 
 out leaving us only the great red     
 shale bings to remind us today of     
 Addiewell's former glory.             </content>
