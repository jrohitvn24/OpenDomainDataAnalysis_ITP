		<title>06Westfield: Open-cast coal</title>
		<content>  Almost 3 square kilometres of our D- 
 Block is coal board property, though  
 much of that has been returned to     
 grass by the{Coal Industry Estates.}  
 The part where operations are still   
 under way contains the{DISPOSAL POINT}
 Here the coal is separated from stone 
 and gravel by a washing process. The  
 coal is then graded for size before   
 being sent to power stations and other
 consumers.                            
  Although the present phase of mining 
 operations has come to an end, there  
 is still a million tons of coal on the
 site to be processed in this way.     
  In spite of the amount of work still 
 to be done, workers are at this moment
 about to be made redundant. This move 
 is causing a great deal of controversy
 locally.             Audrey Henderson,
