 Crawford has two policemen.They are Mr
 Stewart and Mr McDonald.They work with
 six other policemen who live in nearby
 villages.They work in Crawford as well
 as in the surrounding area.The main   
 part of their job is patrolling the   
 A74.                                  
 A typical day of the 9o'clock shift is
 checking the paper work,mostly of the 
 previous night's shift for half an    
 hour and then making sure you have    
 your paper work up to date.They then  
 patrol the A74 and various other      
 roads.When they are called to an      
 accident they get the road clear,     
 check to see if there are any other   
 accidents and care for any injured    
 people.                               
 Being a policeman in Crawford is a    
 very interesting job.
