		<title>09BONAR BRIDGE HIGHLAND GAMES.</title>
		<content> In 1888 Mr Littlejohn decided to start
 the{Invercharron Highland Games.}There
 were many events but in 1901 the      
 biggest attraction of all the events  
 was the{4000ft balloon jump.}In 1903  
 the games stopped for eighty years.   
 The reason is unknown.                
       In 1983 some local residents    
 decided to start the games again. The 
 programme included{athletics, cycling,
{Highland dancing, heavy events}and    
{tug-o-war.}In the events many famous  
 names appear. We also have our own    
 Pipe Band called{Bonar Bridge/Ardgay  
{Pipe Band}which come and play at the  
 games. Ullapool Junior Pipe Band also 
 come and play.                        
       Most years the prize money adds 
 up to around Â£3500. There are 39      
 trophies not counting medals to be    
 won.
