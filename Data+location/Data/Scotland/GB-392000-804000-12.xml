		<title>12BON-ACCORD BATHS 1</title>
		<content> The Bon-Accord Baths or "Uptown Baths"
 as they are known locally are situated
 in Justice Mill Lane,just behind      
 Union Street.                         
 Recently the District Council         
 tentatively suggested closing them    
 down because of the expense involved  
 in running them but a public outcry   
 has prevented this.                   
 The pool is popular with teenagers;   
 many go regularly at the reasonable   
 cost of 25p on weekdays and 45p at    
 weekends.However with a cafeteria on  
 the premises they usually end up with 
 spending more.They also attend with   
 their schools as several of the       
 Aberdeen schools don't have their own 
 pool.                                 
 The pool is well used,with special    
 times for ladies,toddlers and senior  
 citizens.
