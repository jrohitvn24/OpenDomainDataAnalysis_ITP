 green belt area round Glasgow ,there  
 are many recreational and sporting    
 facilities avaliable ,both public and 
 private .There are private golf       
 courses ,namely Cathcart Castle and   
 the Whitecraigs golf club and a public
 course at Deaconsbank .               
    Roukenglen Park and Eastwood Park  
 provide opportunities for swimming    
 ,boating and walking ,as well as being
 very attractive and picturesque in    
 themselves .                          
    Most other outdoor sports such as  
 football ,hockey and rugby are well   
 catered for either with the private   
 sector or the public sector .
