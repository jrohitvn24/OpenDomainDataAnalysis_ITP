 entreprenneur who started her own{    
{pottery workshop}in Larbert village.It
 grew quickly and she moved to bigger  
 premises where she and Karen still    
 hand throw an amazing range of items  
 from cress cats to large              
 casseroles.Increasing orders have     
 resulted in a "Larbert Pottery"factory
 at nearby Denny.Barbara has also an   
 interest in a "Studio" coffee and     
 craft shop at Linlithgow,where other  
 artists can exhibit or sell their     
 work.Hand thrown pottery is very      
 popular with passing trade, and       
 tourism,especially American,fill order
 books.In summer,for 50p,people can    
 throw a couple of pots on the         
 wheel.This is a popular {entertainment
 especially for local children.
