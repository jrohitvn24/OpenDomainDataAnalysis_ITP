		<title>15FISH SELLING</title>
		<content> Our group visited John Brown's Fish   
 Selling Office and interviewed        
 Alexander Strachan,the manager.In the 
 summer,Peterhead Harbour is used by   
 roughly 400 boats from Peterhead,     
 Buckie, Fraserburgh, Macduff, and     
 Lossiemouth.John Brown's Fish Selling 
 Office is used by 20 Peterhead boats  
 and 15 boats from other ports.After   
 the fish is landed it is sorted into  
 different blocks;Cod, Haddock and one 
 for the others.There are also 3 buyers
 working for each firm,1 for each      
 category.They bid for the fish.The    
 buyer who bids the highest gets the   
 fish.Peterhead as a port has          
 improved.Boats have stopped landing in
 Aberdeen because of industrial        
 disputes and because the cost of      
 landing there is greater.Peterhead is 
 now Europe's top White fish port.
