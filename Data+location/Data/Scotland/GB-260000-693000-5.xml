		<title>05ARNPRIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> There has been a school in Arnprior   
 for centuries serving the needs of the
 families of the Garden estate and its 
 farms. The present school celebrated  
 its centenary in 1976. The school     
 buildings were extensively modernised 
 and extended in the late 195o's and   
 the outcome was an excellent blend    
 retaining the character and atmosphere
 of the old school, while providing for
 the convenience and space of modern   
 facilities. There are two full_time   
 teachers and they concentrate on the  
 basic subjects _ language, maths and  
 environmental studies. There are,     
 however, also visiting teachers for   
 music, needlework, physical education 
 and, if required, provide remedial    
 assistance. At the moment there are 14
 pupils (7 boys and 7 girls). At the   
 age of 12 years the pupils typically  
 go on to High School at Balfron.      </content>
