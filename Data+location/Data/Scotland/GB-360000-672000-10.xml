 There are two historical houses in the
 area.One is called Whittinghame house 
 and belonged to the Balfour family and
 was the home of the former Prime      
 minister, Arthur Balfour.In more      
 recent years it was a large private   
 school for boys and employed many     
 local people. For the last two years  
 it has been unoccupied which is very  
 sad because it is a beautiful house.  
     The second house is Ruchlaw House 
 which is built in the Scots baronial  
 style.It was once the home of James   
 Bridie, the Scottish author and is now
 occupied by David Gilmour another     
 author who recently moved to the area.
 It is a family home.Some murals have  
 been uncovered recently in one room.  
 They are about the Jacobite risings.  
 The family were secret sympathisers.
