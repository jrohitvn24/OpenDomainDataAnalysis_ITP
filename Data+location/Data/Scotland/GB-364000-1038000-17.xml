		<title>17OLD PEOPLE'S HOME</title>
		<content> The people who own the home at        
 Ladybank came to Sanday on holiday in 
 summer time in 1984 to see what it was
 like. Then, in November they set it   
 up. They can cater for ten people, but
 at the moment they have three people  
 staying. They take people up to Sanday
 if they want a holiday and one person 
 is coming up in August. They cater for
 as long as the person wants to stay.  
 At the moment they are decorating     
 the rooms but not changing the layout 
 of the rooms if it can be helped.     
 They have one modern kitchen. Showers 
 and toilets are both upstairs and     
 downstairs. They plan to put a fire   
 escape upstairs. At the moment they   
 are fitting in nurse call buttons.    
 They are operated by lights. When the 
 button is pressed the light goes on   
 and they know which person needs help.
 The old folks have a T.V.in each room.</content>
