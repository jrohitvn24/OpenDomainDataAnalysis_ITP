		<title>12DALMENY AND POLLUTION</title>
		<content> Pollution from the oil terminal at    
 Hound Point and the marine terminal at
 Braefoot (the loading point for       
 Mossmorran, a chemical works) presents
 a major threat to the river and the   
 wildlife in the vicinity of Dalmeny.  
  However, the Leith Ports Authority   
 is very vigilant on this score. Hound 
 Point has sophisticated equipment to  
 cope with pollution-e.g. a computer   
 capable of locating a major oil-spill 
 occurring during darkness or fog. Fire
 fighting equipment is also located    
 nearby. A permanently manned ship is  
 also available to tackle any other    
 emergency. Facilities are also        
 available from the Braefoot terminal  
 to cope with chemical pollution.
