		<title>11THE EILDON HILLS (cont.)</title>
		<content>  In June during the Melrose Festival  
 Week there is a race over the         
 Eildons.Many excellent runners take   
 part in this race and the record is   
 25.36 minutes.                        
  At the bottom of the Eildons there is
 Melrose Golf Course which was founded 
 in 1880.It is only a small course with
 9 holes.It is a very hilly course with
 fairly short holes.                   
 Pony trekking is also popular on the  
 Eildons with Elywen Glen (just out of 
 our area) being the local centre for  
 it.                                   
  Some people are granted licences to  
 shoot rabbits and pheasants,although  
 nowadays less licences are granted.The
 Duke of Buccleuch's Hunt sometimes    
 uses the land around the Eildons.
