		<content> We did a survey of our area to        
 discover what people did for a living 
 A great number of people are employed 
 at the two M.O.D. bases of Coulport   
 and Faslane.There are policemen fire- 
 men,scientists, general labourers and 
 domestic staff all of whom are needed 
 to run these establishments.This has  
 made a huge impact on employment in   
 this area bringing many people from   
 all over the country to live here.    
 Before the bases came this was a      
 dormitory suburb for Glasgow with     
 people either travelling to work by   
 boat or employed in service industries
 in the village.There is still one     
 working farm in the district which    
 now concentrates on eggs and sheep and
 grows no crops.This means that much   
 formely productive ground now lies    
 fallow                                
                                       </content>
