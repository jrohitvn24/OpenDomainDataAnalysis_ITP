		<title>09HELPING AROUND THE FARMHOUSE</title>
		<content> Our dad works for Mr Dunlop and has to
 look after all the sheep and the      
 beasts.Seven of us live in Lanes Farm 
 Cottage and we all have to help our   
 mum and dad.                          
 Dad gets up at 05.30 to see to the    
 beasts and any lambs that have lost   
 their mother.Alastair,my new baby     
 brother, gets fed first so I get the  
 breakfast ready for dad when he comes 
 back from the byre.                   
 We have to tidy up our bedroom and    
 make the beds,hoover the floors,put   
 our toys away in the cupboard and then
 if it's a school-day make sure our    
 homework books are in our schoolbags. 
 At 08.35 the taxi arrives to take us  
 to the village.                       
 When there is no school I like going  
 out on the hills to help my dad-it's  
 much better than helping in the house.
