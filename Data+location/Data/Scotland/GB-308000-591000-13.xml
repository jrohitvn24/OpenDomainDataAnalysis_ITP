		<content>   Carpet Bowling is one of the main   
 pastimes in Johnstonebridge in        
 Winter.The Club meets in the Village  
 Hall, which is also the venue for a   
 very active W.R.I.                    
   Fishing on the River Annan is a     
 great attraction with some people even
 coming from abroad to try for salmon  
 and sea trout.A sewing class is held  
 in the school on Winter evenings and  
 the crook making class in Lockerbie   
 Academy is well attended by many of   
 the men.                              
   Many local people curl at Lockerbie 
 Ice Rink, entering competitions both  
 locally and further afield.           
   One of the main events is the local 
 show,held in August, where the results
 of keen gardening and handicrafts     
 prowess are judged. Even the local    
 children take part in this.
