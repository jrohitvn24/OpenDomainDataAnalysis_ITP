		<content> A Bronze Age Cist was discovered in   
 1866 at the highest point in Law.     
  The capstone of the cist was 2 feet  
 below ground level and was 1 foot     
 thick.The cist was one rough stone,9  
 inches thick,on each side and two     
 stones at each end.It was 3 feet 4    
 inches long by 1foot 8 inches wide by 
 2 feet 3 inches deep.The bottom was   
 natural rock. Underneath the capstone 
 was a crouched skeleton and a bronze  
 dagger.                               
 The dagger was about 5 inches long but
 the tip was damaged. Down the centre  
 of the blade was a mid-rib,rounded in 
 section.Two large rivets remained in  
 position,and a third large rivet,found
 loose,had presumably rested in the    
 notch in the top edge of the blade.The
 rivets were half an inch long with    
 expanded heads.The cist can still be  
 seen in a garden in Quarry Road.      </content>
