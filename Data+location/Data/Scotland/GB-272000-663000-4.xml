		<content> Education. The area has a sufficient  
 number of primary schools,but in      
 recent years the roles have fallen and
 continue to fall,primarily because    
 families tend to be smaller than in   
 the past. Sadly,though we have the    
 schools, facilities and equipment grow
 less due to the economic depression   
 ,and children are being denied of the 
 benifits, which would enrich their    
 educational needs.                    
 There is also a technical college     
 which caters for job_release personel 
 and for those wishing to pursue       
 further adult education.
