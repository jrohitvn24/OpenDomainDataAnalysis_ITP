		<title>07JENNIFER'S DAY AT MARYKIRK 1</title>
		<content>    My name is Jennifer and I am 11    
 years old.  I live in the new houses  
 in Marykirk.  I have one sister,      
 Kirsten, aged 14.  I was born in      
 Falkirk and we moved to Marykirk in   
 1977.                                 
    This is how I spend a Friday.  I   
 rise at 7:45 a.m., wake my sister,    
 wash and dress in my school clothes.  
 For breakfast, I eat rice crispies and
 a piece of toast and drink fresh      
 orange juice.  Before school, I help  
 my father by watering the plants in   
 the greenhouse where we grow tomatoes,
 cucumbers, peppers, melons, courgettes
 and flowers.  I learn my spelling then
 leave the house at 9:00 a.m. I call   
 for Debbie and we walk through the    
 park to school which begins at 9:30   
 a.m.                                  
                                       
                                       </content>
