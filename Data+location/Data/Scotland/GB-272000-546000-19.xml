		<title>19Dundrennan School Playground</title>
		<content> At playtime the boys mostly play      
 football and a few girls join in too. 
 We play the length of the playground. 
  Sometimes we play football rounders, 
 this is a game where instead of using 
 a rounders bat you just kick the      
 football as far as you can.           
  Occasionlly when we haven't got a    
 football we play hide and seek or     
 British Bulldogs, this is where we run
 from a wall to a sundial without being
 caught which is approximately twenty  
 metres.  If we are fed up we play a   
 Wallie Tournament, all we have to do  
 here is kick the ball against the wall
 and the first one to miss is out.     
  We play games like Three and In, here
 the first person to score three goals 
 goes in goals.                        
  The smaller children play schools    
 here they inpersonate the teachers and
 act the part of naughty children.     </content>
