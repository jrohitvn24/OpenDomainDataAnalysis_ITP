		<title>19EDUCATION IN ARBROATH.</title>
		<content>{Education}in our area has been unusual
 in that 1985 has seen teachers going  
 on strike because they felt they      
 deserved more money for the job they  
 did.In Scotland the dispute has been  
 going on all year and our area has    
 been badly affected.This has been     
 because the teacher's union in        
 Scotland decided to "target"the       
 constituency of the local M.P.Many    
 parents feel that this "targeting"    
 has been unfair because children in   
 targeted areas have missed weeks of   
 schooling before exams.Next year could
 be the same.The local{media}has       
 written about the dispute and public  
 meetings have been held with the{     
{politician}who represents the area    
 attending.On a happier note the new   
 High School is ready for use and the  
 new sporting{facilities}are already   
 in use.                               </content>
