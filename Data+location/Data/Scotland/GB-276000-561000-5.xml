		<content> The caravan park is at the bottom of  
 the town beside Carlingwark Loch. It  
 is usually busy and last year there   
 were 10162 tourists of which 209      
 were foreign. They have lots of       
 facilities - there are toilets,       
 laundries, showers, boats, tennis and 
 a putting lawn. In the laundries there
 are plugs for things like hairdryers. 
 The tennis and boats and putting can  
 also be used by the public. Whether   
 you are in a caravan or tent you get 6
 metres square. You can't book a       
 special place, you just get what is   
 there. In the low season a place costs
 Â£3.10 but in high season it costs     
 Â£4.00. In the high season Mr          
 Kirkpatrick the warden has an         
 assistant but usually during the year 
 he works alone.
