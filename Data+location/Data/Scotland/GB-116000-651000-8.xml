		<content> MY DAY-MARGARET FERGUSON(11 years)    
 When I get up in the morning I get    
 dressed,make my bed and have breakfast
 I am collected and conveyed to school 
 in the school car.                    
 At week-ends we either help Mum in the
 house with the housework or help Dad  
 doing something up in the fields.When 
 we help Mum we usually have to dust or
 hoover,clean the bathroom,wash dishes 
 or tidy our bedrooms.If we are helping
 Dadwe help him with the following     
 tasks:fencing,tidying up the          
 shed,sorting out potatoes,dosing the  
 lambs or anything else which needs    
 done on the croft.My sister and I have
 to help my Dad because he works in    
 Bowmore Distillery during the day and 
 runs the croft in the evenings and at 
 week-ends.I also look after the 2     
 dogs,6 ducks and 4 bantams.
