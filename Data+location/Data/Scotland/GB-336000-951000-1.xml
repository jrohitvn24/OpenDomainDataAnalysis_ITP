 This are includes the part of Wick to 
 the North of Wick River, the villages 
 of Papigoe and Staxigoe, and some flat
 fertile farmland.The South West corner
 is mostly a residential and shopping  
 area.  Beside the town is Wick Airport
 which is a vital link to the South.   
 To the East of Wick after passing     
 through a new private housing are we  
 follow the road along the coast to    
 Papigoe and Staxigoe.  The Coastline  
 is very rocky with spectacular        
 scenery.  To the South East we can see
 an oilrig which is situated just off  
 the coast of Caithness. North of Wick 
 we have a large area of good farmland 
 used mainly to raise beef cattle and  
 sheep, consisting of Upper Ackergill, 
 Shorelands and Field of Noss Farms.   
 The most Easterly part of the area is 
 sea.                                  </content>
