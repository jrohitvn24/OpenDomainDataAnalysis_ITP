		<content>   Loch Kindar, which is about a mile  
 long and half a mile wide, lies at the
 foot of Criffel. It is 40 feet deep in
 places but the water-level has been   
 reduced since thousands of trees were 
 planted on the hillside some forty    
 years ago.                            
   Since 1958 the loch has been owned  
 by Loch Kindar Angling Club. The      
 members keep the boats and boathouse  
 in good condition, and restock the    
 loch regularly with rainbow trout and 
 brown trout.                          
   There is an island with a causeway  
 leading to it from the east shore. The
 ruins on the island are believed to be
 that of a church but no one is sure.  
 The Angling Club has cleared the isle 
 of weeds and planted shrubs, azaleas  
 and rhododendrons, which make a splash
 of colour in the springtime.
