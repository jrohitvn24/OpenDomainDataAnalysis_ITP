		<content> Most shoppers in West Linton would    
 like to see a large supermarket built 
 that could sell a wide range of food  
 and other goods very cheaply but as   
 this is a very small shopping area    
 this is not possible.                 
    We have three food shops,a         
 news-agents,a chemists ,two garden    
 suppliers,a hairdresser who cuts both 
 men and women's hair, a drapers which 
 has recently changed hands and a post 
 office.                               
    Older people, mothers of young     
 children and people without cars tend 
 to shop locally. Those with transport 
 go to Edinburgh,Pencuik,and Peebles   
 the nearby city and towns.            
    Many people shop in the large      
 super-markets eg. ASDA,SAVACENTRE and 
 FINEFARE and buy enough food to last a
 month or more. Many people buy meat,  
 fish etc. to keep in their freezers.  </content>
