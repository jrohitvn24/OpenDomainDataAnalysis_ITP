 community.In 22 acres of park and     
 woodland 206 handicapped children are 
 cared for by 60 workers.Children fit  
 enough attend classes in school.There 
 are Guides,Scouts and sports.There is 
 a large library.Children in Germany   
 made furniture for them.Herbs are     
 grown for medicines.The community     
 bakes it's own bread.Bees are also    
 kept.The children live in Scandinavian
 style houses,the families consisting  
 of different ages and handicaps,so    
 each can afford mutual help.Craft work
 of a very high standard is produced   
 and sold.The children have pets: cats,
 rabbits,ponies and goldfish.It is a   
 remarkably happy place.
