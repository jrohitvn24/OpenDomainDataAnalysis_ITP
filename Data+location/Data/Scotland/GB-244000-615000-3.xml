		<title>03MUIRSTON FARM (LITTLEMILL)</title>
		<content>{ Muirston farm is owned by Mr Wyllie. 
 He{owns 950 acres}of land and{rents   
{290 acres more.}The farm is mainly    
 beef cattle and sheep.They have 270   
 cattle and 3 bulls, also 800 breeding 
 ewes.Each year he also grows          
 approximately 40 tons of hay,1200 tons
 of silage and 100 tons of barley.He   
 has 5 tractors.We were surprised that 
 Mr Wyllie only employs one other      
 worker,but during the busy times his  
 wife and family help.The Wyllie farm  
 has 4 working dogs.They keep a goat   
 because goats milk is the closest to  
 sheep's milk and can be used to feed  
 pet lambs.Mr Wyllie enjoy's being a   
 farmer , but does not like getting up 
 early.
