 The Moss is mostly marshland and scrub
 and long ago stretched 50 square miles
 but today less than 20 square miles   
 remain wild.It is split into several  
 sections and the section in the south 
 west corner of our block is called the
 Carse of Boquhapple.Much of it has    
 been planted and drained.During the   
 18th and 19th centuries a landowner   
 Lord Kames,who acquired Blairdrummond 
 estate,set out to improve parts of the
 bog and by 1844,170 acres had been    
 cleared between the River Forth and   
 the Goodie on our map.Today peat is   
 being extracted in this area.In olden 
 days the moss had to be crossed with  
 great care and Rob Roy was reputed to 
 have escaped when being taken captive 
 to Stirling Castle by knowing these   
 routes.
