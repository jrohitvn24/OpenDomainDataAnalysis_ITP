		<content> I wake up at about half past seven    
 have a wash and put my clothes on. I  
 then go down stairs to have my        
 breakfast. It consists of cereal,     
 toast and usually a drink of milk.    
 After,I brush my teeth and wash my    
 face then go down to school. It starts
 at nine o'clock  and at half past ten 
 we have play time. Then at quarter    
 past twelve it is lunch. School       
 finishes at half past three. Then I   
 take my dog for a walk for about 25   
 minutes. After that I play with my    
 friends or watch television. At about 
 quarter to six we have our dinner     
 which is usually a two course cooked  
 meal. Afterwards I do my flute        
 practice.At about half past nine I go 
 to bed and read for half an hour.Then 
 -sleep!
