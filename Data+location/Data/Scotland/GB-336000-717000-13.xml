		<content> Mrs.Smith started doing bed&amp;breakfast 
 in 1984, while the Open golf          
 championship was taking place in      
 St.Andrews. This venture proved so    
 succesful that she decided to continue
 this summer. The majority of her      
 guests are foreign visitors visiting  
 this area. She works closely with the 
 local tourist board who refer holiday 
 makers to her. In her spare time      
 Mrs.Smith enjoys flower arranging,    
 curling and gardening (they do not    
 grow vegetables but get a reasonable  
 supply by bartering with neighbours). 
 Her husband's hobbies include welding,
 making toys and a visit to the pub    
 once a week.                          
  Mrs.Smith shops mainly in Cupar,     
 Dundee and St.Andrews although vans   
 deliver groceries, fish and lemonade  
 to the farm, as well as usual milk and
 papers.                               </content>
