		<content> The local newspaper in our area is the
{Fraserburgh Herald}which is on sale   
 every{Friday},priced{17p.             
 It is just over one hundred years old,
 being{founded in 1884.}The present    
 editor is Mr.T Fowler,who helped us   
 with this project.                    
 I like the local paper as it tells you
 about people you may know as well as  
 concentrating on our local area.It    
 includes just about everything you can
 think of,from sport to local politics 
 and all of the following:             
 Adverts,car sales,poetry (local poets)
 church notices,round and about,public 
 notices,births,marriages &amp; deaths,    
 properties for sale,local news and    
 events,as well as many other items    
 which come up from time to time.      
 I think everyone should buy the local 
 paper as it is important to know what 
 is happening in your area.            </content>
