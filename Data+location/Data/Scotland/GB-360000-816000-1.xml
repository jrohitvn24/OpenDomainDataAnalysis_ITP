 The area extends from Harthill Farm in
 the south to the tip of Keig Village  
 in the north and is bisected by the   
 B992, Whitehouse/Keig road. The River 
 Don loops from SW to NE and is crossed
 by a road bridge (built 1817) half a  
 mile from Keig.                       
                                       
 It is an excellent farming area where 
 apart from the small farms of         
 Burnside, Meiklehaugh, Bandley and    
 Mill of Bandley, all the land is owned
 by Forbes Estate and rented to        
 Harthill Farms Partnership.           
 All woodland plantations are owned by 
 Forbes Estate which also operates a   
 small sawmill near Keig village.
