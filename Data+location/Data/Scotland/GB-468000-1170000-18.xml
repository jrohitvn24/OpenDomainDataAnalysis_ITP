		<content> Though the gales and storms are here  
 in the winter the temperature is not  
 usually below 0 degrees centigrade.   
 There is not a lot of snow because the
 sea keeps the heat through the winter,
 but through the summer the sea makes  
 us cool and its very rare to have a   
 temperature of 20 degrees centigrade. 
    When the wind is very strong there 
 is no shelter against it, no trees no 
 big hills. We measure the wind speed  
 with an anemometer on top of our      
 school and then we mark it on a graph.
    When the wind is right strong the  
 waves come in over the rocks and      
 cliffs. The air is full of spray and  
 the waves can move big slabs of       
 concrete and the water can go into the
 shop. When the wind drops the sea goes
 right calm and sometimes this brings  
 fog.
