		<title>13SCHOOLS IN CARNOUSTIE AREA</title>
		<content>   There are{two Primary Schools}in the
 Eastern part of Carnoustie.  One is   
{Panbride,}a{small three-teacher school
 which, in the past, took its pupils   
 mainly from the outlying districts of 
 the community.  Nowadays, however,it  
 is taking a larger percentage of its  
 pupils from the new housing areas     
 which are springing up.               
   The other school,{Carlogie,}is a    
 modern school with a{roll of 440.     
 This was opened in 1976 to meet the   
 educational needs of the increasing   
 population at the Eastern end of      
 Carnoustie.  When Carlogie first      
 opened it was right on the perimeter  
 of the new housing development,       
 but, so rapid has been the spread of  
 house building that now, only 9 years 
 later,it is surrounded on all sides by
 yet more new housing.
