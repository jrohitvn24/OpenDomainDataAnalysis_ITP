		<title>15NEW MINISTER FOR FAIFLEY</title>
		<content>      The Rev. John Dillon took charge 
 as the new minister of Faifley Church 
 following a special induction service 
 on Tuesday 4th of June.The Rev.       
 Stewart Borthwick of Abbotsford Church
 welcomed over 380 guests.             
      The Robing Ceremony was conducted
 by the wife of Faifley's Session Clerk
 Mrs. James Murray.                    
    Before his arrival the congregation
 of Faifley Parish had voluntarily     
 decorated the manse for the Rev.      
 Dillon and his wife Liz.,who is a     
 nursing sister, and he thanked them   
 for that before the close of the      
 service.                              
   Faifley Church has a special feature
 inside.There is a small chapel dedic- 
 ated to the people of Clydebank who   
 died during the Clydebank Blitz.The   
 strange thing about it is that it was 
 built by Germans as a symbol of peace.</content>
