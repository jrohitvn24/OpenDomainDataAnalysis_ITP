		<title>14PORT OF MENTEITH FISHING</title>
		<content> The Lake of Menteith is very well     
 known for its fishing. From old       
 records we have learned that the monks
 at the priory of Inchmahome introduced
 pike into the lake about 500 years    
 ago. This was an important source of  
 food and they used swans to catch the 
 pike. Today pike are considered to be 
 a nuisance because they feed on       
 smaller fish such as trout.           
  Fishing as a sport is one of the     
 things which brings in money to the   
 district. The fishing in the lake is  
 controlled by the Angling Association 
 who own 25 boats. A charge of Â£12 per 
 boat is made and each boat is allowed 
 to have 3 rods. Each rod is restricted
 to catching 10 fish. The Angling      
 Association was formed in 1967 and is 
 comprised of the owners of the land   
 surrounding the lake.
