		<title>11THE VILLAGE HALL,CARBOST</title>
		<content> The village hall is the only place    
 which has a stage and a large crowd of
 people can meet.It is used mainly for 
 dances and Bring and Buy sales.During 
 the winter,there is a Junior Youth    
 Club on Fridays and a Senior Youth    
 Club on Saturdays.                    
 At Christmas time local people put on 
 a Pantomime,written by                
 themselves.Everyone enjoys it,and the 
 hall is usually packed full!          
 Sometimes the school puts on a concert
 or plays for the village and the local
 Drama Group use the hall to rehearse  
 there for a yearly competition held   
 in                                    
 the Isle of Skye,usually in Broadford.
 The community raised funds to add an  
 extension to the hall,an extra little 
 room,which can be used for different  
 things,like storage,meetings,table    
 tennis and now a pool table.          </content>
