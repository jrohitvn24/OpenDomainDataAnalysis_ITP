		<title>01Copinsay : East of Orkney</title>
		<content> Copinsay is a wedge-shaped island with
 cliffs rising to 200ft in the east and
 sloping to sea level in the west.     
 The rocks are mainly middle old red   
 sandstone flags laid down in shallow  
 fresh water, they are some 350 to 400 
 million years old.  Copinsay, ungrazed
 for 10 years, is covered in rough     
 grass.  The island was purchased to be
 a nature reserve by friends of James  
 Fisher, author and naturalist, who    
 died in 1970, to his memory.  Copinsay
 is a seabird colony of national       
 importance with many types of birds,  
 especially large colonies of          
 kittiwakes and guillemots on the SE   
 Cliffs.  A lighthouse was build in    
 1914 and at present is manned by 6 men
 on a month on month off basis with 3  
 men on the island and 3 ashore.  The  
 lighthouse has been recently          
 modernised.                           </content>
