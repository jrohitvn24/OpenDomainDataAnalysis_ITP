		<title>11THE DROVERS INN SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>   In our block there is a house called
 Hillhead. A lady called Mrs Mary      
 Murray lives in it. Before 1801 the   
 house was called Mosscroft. It was    
 built in 1611, and carved on a stone  
 in the house are the letters I.McL.   
 which we think may have been the      
 initials of the builder.              
   Mosscroft was an inn which drovers  
 went to while waiting for their oats  
 to be ground at the mill. The mill is 
 now a farm called Longbeoch.          
   The drovers drank whisky which was  
 made from water from a dam further    
 down the road. It was and still is    
 illegal to make whisky without a      
 licence.                              
   There is a piece of land near the   
 house which is very difficult to      
 plough. The farmers think this was the
 old road to the inn.
