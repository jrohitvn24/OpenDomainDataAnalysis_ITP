 It is well worth the climb up the     
 steep sided promontory on the south   
 side of Lunan water, just where the   
 river enters the sea, not just for the
 view but to inspect the ruins of RED  
 CASTLE. The remains consist of a 13th 
 century curtain wall and a 15th.      
 century tower. The building is said to
 be on the site of a much earlier      
 castle built for William the Lion by  
 Walter de Berkley to counter the raids
 by Danish pirates.Lunan was at this   
 time a royal hunting ground, a fact   
 which is born out by the names of     
 farms in the area e.g. Courthill and  
 Hawkhill.                             
 At Imrie Crescent, Braehead of Lunan  
 there is a 45feet OBELISK. This was   
 erected in 1850 in memory of          
 Lt.Col.James Blair of the Bengal Army.
