		<title>15Irvine Marymass Races</title>
		<content> One highlight of our town's{Marymass  
{Festival}is the{horse racing}which    
 takes place on Irvine Moor on Marymass
 Saturday each year.This is reputed to 
 be the{oldest horse race meeting in   
{the World.}It dates back to{the 12th  
{century}when men from Irvine Carters  
 Society raced their cart horses at the
 Marymass Fair to prove whose horse was
 the best. The winning owner got more  
 business from merchants for having the
 fastest horses.The races are still    
 held on the moor on the Saturday      
 following the third Monday in August  
 each year and they are organised by   
 the{Irvine Carters' Society.}They are 
 for heavy cart horses, ponies and     
 donkeys and great crowds of people    
 enjoy watching these races and all the
 activities of the fair which is held  
 alongside.                            
                                       </content>
