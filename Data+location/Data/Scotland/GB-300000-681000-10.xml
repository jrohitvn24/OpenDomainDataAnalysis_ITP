		<content> On June 14 1985 our class kept a tally
 of persons using the centre between   
 9.00 am and 9.00 pm. We found that    
 1023 people used it in that time. We  
 did a survey every 10 minutes. 73     
 people took part in it. We found that 
 most of those surveyed used it for    
 swimming.(46) Badminton and squash    
 proved a second popular choice.       
 Snooker,multi-gym,running,weights,    
 fencing,life-saving and the cafe      
 facilities were also popular. The     
 evening was the busiest time. The     
 majority of people using the centre   
 lived locally,on average about 10 mins
 distance. We discovered that it was   
 greatly used by the people of Bo'ness 
 who were glad it had been built in    
 the town.
