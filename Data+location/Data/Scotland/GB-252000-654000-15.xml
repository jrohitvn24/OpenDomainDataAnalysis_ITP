		<content>      There are two large Primary      
 Schools in the area both of which use 
 the old closed-plan classroom system  
 where classes are set according to the
 age of pupils in a year-group.        
      Pupils are taught all the basic  
 ideas  of education in primary school 
 e.g. reading, writing and arithmetic  
 with some basic mathematics. In later 
 years they are taught some history and
 geography and they leave school with a
 good general knowledge.               
      Pupils start primary school at   
 the age of 5 and leave to go to       
 secondary school at the age of 12.    
 Primary school provides a solid basis 
 for more thorough education in later  
 years.
