		<content>  Invereck Home is in the countryside. 
 It is situated off the main road. When
 you go up to the home there is a long,
 wooded drive which leads to the main  
 building.                             
  As you approach you will see a sandy 
 coloured building which looks like a  
 castle.In front of the home is a      
 traffic island that you drive round.  
       At the side of the home are 6   
 cottages. In front of the cottages    
 there is a putting green and on each  
 side of the home are two fields. There
 are sloping grassy areas with trees   
 and flowers.                          
  The home is very attractive  and in  
 very pleasant, peaceful surroundings  
 which make it an ideal place for old  
 people.
