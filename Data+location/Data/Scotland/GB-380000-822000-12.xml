		<title>12Health of Bourtie farmers</title>
		<content> With the increased use of chemical    
 fertilizers, foliar and fungal spray  
 on farms, many farmers are conscious  
 of the effects on their food and      
 heath.  Most amilies who till the land
 in the parish of ourtie reserve a     
 small plot in a field close to the    
 farmhouse to row itchen vegetables    
 such a a row each of cabbage,         
 cauliflower, lettuce, peas, carrots   
 and a large plot of potatoes. When in 
 1980 a farmer discovered that a foliar
 spray used on an adjacent field crop  
 had demolished his crop of lettuces,  
 he was careful not to use that        
 chemical again.  This attitue has been
 reflected more recently in a marginal 
 turnaround to the older ways of crop  
 rotation and minimal use of chemical  
 sprays.
