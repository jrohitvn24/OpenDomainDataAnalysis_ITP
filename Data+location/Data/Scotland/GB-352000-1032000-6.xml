		<title>06SEA BIRDS IN EDAY</title>
		<content>    Along the coasts of Eday there are 
 many sea birds. Probably the most     
 common here is the fulmar or mallimack
 as the locals call it. They nest along
 the cliffs by the shore.              
    Also to be found are kittiwakes,   
 gannets, all sorts of gulls,          
 razorbills, arctic terns and          
 guillemots. All of these birds nest by
 the shore, lay their eggs in late     
 summer and the chicks are ready to    
 leave the nest by late autumn.        
    Most of these birds live on a diet 
 of fish, some catch and eat live fish 
 and some eat the remains or oil from  
 the fish.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
