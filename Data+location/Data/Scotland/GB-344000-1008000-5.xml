		<content>{SKATEHORN}was born in Kirkwall 150    
 years ago.He was the son of a pedlar. 
 He lived rough in fields and never had
 a job.Before going to sleep he stuffed
 the holes in the dyke with grass,     
 heather or straw. If it was a cold    
 night he would say he had left the    
 gate open and that was why it was so  
 cold.Everyone loved him and welcomed  
 into their homes and gave him food.   
{ANNIE HARPER}was a Spey wife from     
 Rendall. She lived in a small cottage 
 with her dogs to keep her company.    
 Annie walked around with a{cubbie}on  
 her back. In this basket she carried  
 all the food people gave to her.She   
 wore pieces of sack tied together with
 string.All the local people loved     
 Annie and her dogs.
