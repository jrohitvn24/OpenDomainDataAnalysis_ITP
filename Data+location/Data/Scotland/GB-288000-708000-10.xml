		<content> The 12 Km Sq block contains the       
 village of Blackford (area            
 approximately 1/2 Km Sq) and has a    
 distillery and a spring water water   
 bottling plant. The population is     
 approximately 500. The block is       
 crossed from east to west by a main   
 railway line and the A9 dual          
 carriageway road, each passing north  
 and south of the village respectively.
 Arable farmland and grassland cover   
 much of the southern half while rough 
 grazing and woodland cover most of the
 northern half.                        
   The Allan water river flows across  
 the block on its way to the river     
 Forth. It is fed from various burns   
 and streams running from the Ochil    
 Hills in the South and the rising     
 woodlands to the North. The north     
 eastern corner contains part of       
 Gleneagles golf course.               </content>
