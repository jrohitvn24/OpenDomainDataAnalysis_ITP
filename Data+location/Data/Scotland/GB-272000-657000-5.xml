		<title>05LIVING IN A TOWER BLOCK</title>
		<content>{Budgies, Gerbils, Mice}and other small
 animals are permitted because they    
 arekept in cages.  When people do     
 their washing they cannot hang it out 
 on the verandah because it makes the  
 tower look ugly.  Children cannot play
 on the verandah in case they lean over
 the rail and fall, so their mothers   
 must take them downstairs to play.    
 Little children need an adult to take 
 them down in the lift since the lift  
 buttons are out of their reach.       
 When there is a funeral, there is a   
 special cupboard space in the lift to 
 hold a coffin.  When there is a       
 wedding, the fire button is used so   
 that the bride can have the sole use  
 of the lift.
