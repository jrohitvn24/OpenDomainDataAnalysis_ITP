		<title>07THE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>      The village hall is where        
 Glenprosen School Children and teacher
 go every day. We go there at half past
 twelve for lunch. We go to the hall   
 for dinner because we do not have a   
 dinner room at the school. The hall is
 also used by the school on Thursday   
 afternoons for gym. The community use 
 the hall occassionally for ceilidhs,  
 parties and whist drives.             
      The hall is swept by Mrs. Riddell
 (the  retired roadman's wife) who also
 serves as dinner lady and cleaner for 
 school.                               
      The hall is 6m wide and 16m long.
 It has 11 windows and 2 doors, one    
 front and one back. We use the back   
 door to come in for our dinner. It has
 a small kitchen and male and female   
 toilets.                              
 Without the village hall social life  
 in Glenprosen would stop.             </content>
