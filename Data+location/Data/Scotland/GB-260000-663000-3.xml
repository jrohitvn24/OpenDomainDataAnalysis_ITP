		<title>03    Glasgow Cathedral</title>
		<content> Dedicated to St. Kentigern or Mungo,  
 it is one of only two mediaeval       
 Cathedrals in Scotland to survive in a
 relatively intact condition.It was    
 built in stages between the 12th and  
 15th centuries in the early pointed   
 Gothic style.                         
 The present Minister is Dr. William   
 Morris. When the Royal family visit   
 they sit in the Royal Pew which bears 
 their crest.                          
 There is a specially-designed carpet  
 which shows the Glasgow Coat of       
 Arms.The Nurses' Chapel has been      
 recently restored and the new tapestry
 in the lower church depicts scenes    
 from the book of Genesis.             
 German stained glass removed at the   
 end of World War II due to anti-Nazi  
 feeling has recently been discovered  
 in the cellars and may be restored.
