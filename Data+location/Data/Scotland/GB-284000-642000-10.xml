 Centre. It is called Gilchrist's      
 Garden Centre. They have a branch in  
 Aberdeen and one in Nairn. Old Mr.&amp;   
 Mrs. Gilchrist started the business   
 when they were young. You can buy     
 indoor plants and outdoor plants.     
 There are pet rabbits, fish and birds.
 There is a pond with  money thrown    
 into the water. The money is given to 
 charity. there is a cafeteria         
 downstairs and a restaurant upstairs. 
 The business has grown enormously in  
 the last twenty years. They now have  
 about twelve cars for delivering      
 plants and eight or nine vans. You can
 buy tools for the garden , bird seed, 
 soil and compost, souvenirs, sweets
