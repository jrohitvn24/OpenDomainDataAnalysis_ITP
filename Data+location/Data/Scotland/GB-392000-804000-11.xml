		<content> Our street is in an awful mess because
 of the buses and there are large holes
 in the road.There are holes beside the
 kerb and when people qash their cars  
 the water gets stuck in these holes.  
 The council have refused to fill      
 in the large holes and have only fixed
 the small holes.I think this is so    
 they can save money.                  
 I hope the bus depot is moved and the 
 roads improved.Instead it would be    
 nice if they built a leisure centre   
 and a car park because the Grain      
 Place would be a better place to live 
 in.
