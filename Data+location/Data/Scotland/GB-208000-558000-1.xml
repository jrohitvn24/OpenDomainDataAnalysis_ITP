		<title>01Castle Kennedy and Surrounds</title>
		<content> This area is mainly farmland. There   
 are some crops but most land is used  
 for grazing for cattle. Dairy farming 
 is predominant but there is some beef 
 farming.The bulk of the land in this  
 section is owned by Lord Stair.There  
 is one village,Castle Kennedy.There   
 are few amenities.People in the       
 village generally use Stranraer,three 
 miles away,for shopping, banking,     
 doctors, etc. The main tourist        
 attraction is Castle Kennedy Gardens. 
 There is a small Primary School of    
 about 50 pupils and 3 teachers. At the
 last census the village population    
 was 314. The A75 Euro-route runs      
 through this section.There are buses  
 to Dumfries and London as well as the 
 main railway line between Stranraer   
 and Glasgow/London. This is definitely
 a country area.
