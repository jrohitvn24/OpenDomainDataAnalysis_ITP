		<content> In our area we have one typical croft 
 which is still worked.It has a        
 thatched roof,made by covering reeds  
 with wire netting and weighting it    
 down.The crofter is self sufficient in
 many ways as he grows his own crops   
 and keeps hens,sheep and a cow.Many   
 crofts have been modernised and use   
 electricity unlike the paraffin lamps 
 of the past.The remains of old crofts 
 are very useful as sheep shelters.    
 Around our school we have many council
 houses varying in size from two roomed
 for the elderly to five roomed for    
 large families.There are also         
 privately owned houses including      
 detached,semi detached and            
 bungalows.These houses vary in        
 construction,some being wooden,others 
 stone built.
