		<title>03CHANGE IN RHU AND DISTRICT.</title>
		<content>  On interviewing many of the local    
 residents we discovered that most     
  agreed that the greatest change      
 to have taken place in Rhu over the   
 years was the vast increase in        
 population brought about mainly by the
 development of the nearby Faslane     
 Naval Base and of course, the         
 inevitable increase in housing to     
 accommodate employees. This has also  
 resulted in the increased volume of   
 traffic on the roads and where        
 previously, a narrow country road     
 wound round the shores of the Gareloch
 now a modern two lane,in one area     
 three lane highway cuts through former
 gardens of lochside mansion houses.The
 Clynder side of the loch has          
 experienced similiar changes but to a 
 far lesser extent-an increase in      
 population but only some upgrading of 
 roads at present.                     </content>
