		<title>03LANDSCAPE TO THE WEST</title>
		<content> To the west{Open Farmland.}The land-  
 scape in this part is dominated by the
 A9 road,the railway line,the River    
 Allan and farmland. On the A9 many    
 types of vehicle can be seen day or   
 night.The railway line is the main    
 Glasgow/Perth line and trains usually 
 pass this stretch every half hour or  
 so.The River is met by a tributary    
 called the Knaik near the railway     
 bridge and is fairly narrow &amp; winding 
 at this part. The river affords good  
 fishing for sportsmen &amp; herons alike! 
 The farmland here is well defined with
 regularly fenced or hedged fields,all 
 under cultivation. Farmhouses are     
 larger and surrounded by storage sheds
 and other farm buildings.
