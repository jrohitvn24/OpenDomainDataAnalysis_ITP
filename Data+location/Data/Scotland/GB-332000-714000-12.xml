		<content> In this part of North East Fife the   
 landscape is composed of smooth sided 
 rounded hills which slope gently down 
 to fertile,undulating river valleys   
 which in this area are known as{"Howes
{"}or{"Straths". }The highest point is 
 the Mount Hill at 221 metres and from 
 here the land drops down to a height  
 of around 40 metres in the valley     
 floor. The only stream of any         
 importance is the Ladyburn which flows
 East to join the main River Eden just 
 outside our area. The main rock type  
 is a type of fine-grain lava stone    
 called basalt or whinstone and in a   
 few places this rock comes to the     
 surface. Everywhere else though the   
 underlying rock is hidden underneath a
 very deep drift cover of glacially    
 deposited moraine which must be       
 several metres deep in places.
