 SCHOOL HOLDS A{SPRING FAYRE}TO RAISE

 HONOUR.                               
   THERE WERE LOTS OF STALLS, SUCH AS  
 CAKE AND CANDY, TOYS, CRAFT, PLANTS,  
 SOFT GOODS, BOTTLES AND JUMBLE. THERE 
 WAS ALSO A STALL WHERE YOU COULD BUY  
 ICE-CREAM AND THE SCHOOL DINING ROOM  
 WAS MADE INTO A CAFE WHERE YOU COULD  
 GET TEA, COFFEE, JUICE, SANDWICHES AND
 CAKES.
