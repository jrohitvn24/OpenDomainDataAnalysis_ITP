		<content> The area is part of the former{County 
{of Kinross,}now within{Tayside Region.
 The block is fairly sparsely populated
 covering a rural area and comprising  
 mainly farmland.  The northern part of
{Loch Leven}accounts for over a third  
 of the block.                         
{Milnathort}is in the north-west corner
 of the block, the upper half of the   
 village rising towards the 18th cent. 
 church. The north east corner of the  
 block rises in the lower slopes of the
{Lomond Hills.}Between these two higher
 areas the land is undulating,levelling
 towards the loch.  The west side of   
 the block, beside{Kinross,}is much    
 flatter.                              
 Agriculture is the main industry; high
 quality crops and stock are produced. 
 Tourism income is minimal, most       
 visitors either passing through or    
 outside the area on the {M90 Motorway.</content>
