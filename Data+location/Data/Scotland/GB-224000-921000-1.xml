		<content> This township is in the Parish of     
{Assynt}which is very sparsely popul-  
 ated. The land is rough moorland but  
 provides good grazing. There are few  
 trees and very old dykes surrounding  
 land previously cultivated. It is     
 famous for its{geological formations  
 so near the surface.  It may be       
 recognised by the 100 feet high       
 limestone{Stronchrubie Crags}which    
 border a nature reserve. Geologists,  
 archeologists and botanists come for  
 specimens from Universities all over  
 Britain. There is no industry here,   
 only farming,gamekeeping and tourism. 
 Two large historical features are     
{Ardvreck Castle}(seat of{MacLeods of  
{Assynt)and Calda House}(locally called
 the{"White House").}Ruins of sheilings
 speckle the land. There is one hotel  
 and a school but no shops. Many lochs 
 and rivers provide excellent fishing. </content>
