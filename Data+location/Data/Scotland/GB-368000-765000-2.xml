		<content>    Before the present school was      
 opened in 1968, there were 2 schools  
 for children of the village and       
 surrounding district.  The old schools
 were{Dunthill School}near the old     
 railway station  and{Napier School}in 
 the village.  Pupils from the village 
 attended Napier School until they were
 9 or 10 and then moved up to Dunthill.
    Liam now lives in Napier School    
 building and Dunthill is part of      
 Gillian's house.  Dunthill was the    
 oldest of the 2 schools.  It was      
 opened in 1874 and Napier School was  
 opened in 1898.  Most of the          
 information about the schools is in   
 the{old log books}kept by the Grampian
 Regional Archivist at Woodhill House, 
 Aberdeen.
