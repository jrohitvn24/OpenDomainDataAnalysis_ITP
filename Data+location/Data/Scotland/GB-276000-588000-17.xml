		<content> Mr.Black became a gamekeeper because  
 he liked the open-air and walking.He  
 was born in Cottage Row and as a boy  
 liked shooting and fishing.He goes to 
 Auchenstroan and Craigdarroch to shoot
 now and often kills deer and foxes in 
 the course of his duties.He has two   
 dogs and a ferret which he uses for   
 stalking hunting rabbits.He often uses
 a three wheel motor-bike to get around
 the hills as he is nearly 70 years    
 old.His other job involves him in     
 sweeping the streets and he has a     
 hobby of two old cars which he races  
 around in.
