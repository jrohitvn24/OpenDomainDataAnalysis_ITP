		<title>09The Croys</title>
		<content> The Croys is about 1.5 miles from KPD 
 and about 300 yds from the crossroads 
 at the top of the village of Bridge of
 Urr. The Croys house was built about  
 1700-1800. It was first owned by      
 Kilquhanity estate. It started as a   
 small farmhouse but was then sold to  
 Skirving who built on the rest of the 
 house, the middle and the East wing,  
 in the years 1875-1930. It has a large
 garden with a good selection of foods,
 for example peas, marrows, cucumber,  
 pears, apples and tomatoes. The garden
 has one door and is surrounded by a   
 wall which is about 6-7 ft. At one    
 point it is only about 5 ft. You can  
 get on to the wall but you have to get
 over a 3 ft fence. The apples taste   
 very nice and the pears are alright. I
 used to work there. I used to cut     
 grass, fetch wood and help clean the  
 10-20 rooms.                          </content>
