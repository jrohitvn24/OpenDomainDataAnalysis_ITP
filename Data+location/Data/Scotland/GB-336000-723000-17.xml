		<content>  Many of the adults in our area work  
 in the village of Leuchars,8 miles    
 away from Gauldry.Leuchars is the home
 of an R.A.F.base and one of Britain's 
 first line defence bases.My dad works 
 there as a chief technician._ He works
 in a hangar and there is a great deal 
 of noise from the aircraft.The        
 aircraft can often be seen flying over
 the village of Gauldry.They are mainly
 Phantom jets.We also often see Wessex 
 helicopters flying over.There is a    
 rescue base in Leuchars and in winter 
 especially,they are often called out  
 to assist hill _ walkers.
