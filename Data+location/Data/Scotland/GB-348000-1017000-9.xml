		<content> The{fire service}was started 12 years 
 ago by local people who were worried  
 about fires on the island.Eight local 
 people are part time{firemen}.The     
{service}has been used five times.On   
 only one occasion was there a serious}
 fire. Mainly they are called to       
 chimney fires.  If there was a very   
{serious fire}a{brigade}from Kirkwall  
 would be called out but it has not    
 been necessary yet.The men do get     
 special training twice a year.They    
 have to run and do special exercises  
{Water}to put out the fires comes from 
{hydrants,ponds}or even the{sea.}They  
 have special equipment.It is a small  
{portable fire engine}which is put on  
 the lorry.Their{uniforms}are{oilskins 
 and{rubber boots.
