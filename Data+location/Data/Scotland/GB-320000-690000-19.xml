		<content> (cont) traditional Scots game of      
 curling. Ice skating also takes place 
 when the ice is suitable. In the early
 1970's water ski-ing was started on   
 the Loch and soon became the centre   
 for water ski-ing, in Fife. A local   
 man John Adam, was Scottish water ski 
 jump champion several times in the    
 70's. Recently problems of pollution  
 and weeds have curtailed the use of   
 the loch for water ski-ing.           
                                       
                                       
 Within the last two years wind-surfing
 has become a popular pastime. Fishing 
 on the Loch, although a favourite     
 pastime is suffering from the effects 
 of pollution of old mine workings.
