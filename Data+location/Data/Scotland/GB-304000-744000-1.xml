		<title>01The Butterstone Area</title>
		<content> A delightful haven of tranquility     
 arising out of the northern shores of 
 Loches Craighoh, Lowes and Butterstone
 along a meandering stone wall lined   
 road, pocked sited pasture occasional 
 stone buildings. On the gentle slopes 
 board leaved woods, leading to steeper
 ground coniferous forest and still    
 higher grouse mors, with an abundence 
 of wild flowers and wildlife. Red     
 squirrel and red deer often seen      
 roaming unhindered; in preference     
 pheasants perch on five bar gates;    
 rather than damp meadows by the road. 
 From the moor a fast flowing burn     
 tumbles and jumps over rocks into the 
 loch. Butterstone despite mists       
 attracts fly fishermen, who attempt to
 catch trout. The whole area reverting 
 back to nature. There are no schools  
 or churches, hardly any population,   
 mostly making a living from tourism.  </content>
