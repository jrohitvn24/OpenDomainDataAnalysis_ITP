		<title>05VISITING HIGHTOWN OF CRAIGS</title>
		<content>   The farmer,{MR. McKEACHIE,}has owned
 this farm for about 18 years.He also  
 owns the neighbouring small holding-{ 
{JENNYGILL}.Although Jennygill is not  
 in our block the two farms are farmed 
 as one unit and both farms are typical
 of our area.                          
   Our visit was to {HIGHTOWN OF       
{CRAIGS.}Duncan asked Mr. McKeachie    
 when the farm was built.He couldn't   
 remember but said it was before his   
 time anyway.The farm is not very      
 modern but Mr. McKeachie said he liked
 doing things the "old way".           
   He employs two full time workers and
 his son also works part time.He grows 
 50 acres of hay and oats for feeding  
 purposes.There is a dairy herd of 71  
 cows which are milked twice daily.They
 are worked through 5 milking units.The
 rest of the livestock consists of 2   
 Friesian bulls and 1 Angus bull.      </content>
