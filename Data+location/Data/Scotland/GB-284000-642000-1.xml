		<title>01Clyde Valley Area</title>
		<content> The area covered in this survey is    
 largely rural and includes the village
 of Kirkfieldbank, which is located on 
 the River Clyde. At this point the    
 river is about 100 feet wide. The     
 village is the place also where the   
 smaller River Mouse runs into the     
 Clyde. In the area there are many     
 fruit growers; raspberries,           
 strawberries, and tomatoes grown under
 glass. There has been a decline into  
 tomato growing recently due to foreign
 competition. The area also includes   
 many fine farms. These are mainly     
 dairy or mixed arable and sheep and   
 cattle. Many of the local people      
 travel to Lanark or the Motherwell/   
 Wishaw area to find employment. The   
 area being in the Clyde Valley and    
 being slightly milder in summer than  
 on higher ground attracts many day    
 visitors.                             </content>
