		<title>17LIVING IN NEWTON STEWART</title>
		<content>   After coming from the south of      
 England I have lived in Newton Stewart
 for three months.It is a small and    
 pretty town with small shops.The roads
 have  much less traffic.I find the    
{climate}milder but with more          
 rain.There is a cinema which is small 
 but it has good films which are mostly
 P.G. so I can go to them.There is a   
 big park not far from where I live.It 
 has an assault course which is fairly 
 hard.On a Sunday we go on a walk to   
 somewhere interesting.A short drive   
 away are{sub_tropical}gardens open to 
 the public,and an attractive beach    
 nearby,with golden_brown sands.In     
 Newton Stewart area there is lots of  
 wildlife.My parents and I enjoy living
 in this small,friendly town.
