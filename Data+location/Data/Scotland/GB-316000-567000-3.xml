		<content>    At Mr Robinson's Distillery Farm,  
 we spoke to a farmworker who told us  
 that sea trout were caught but that   
 the season was now finished. The      
 season actually lasts from February to
 November. It's very expensive to get a
 licence to fish in the river. He told 
 us how the By_pass would affect the   
 farm. It will cut 14 acres off the    
 land. A bridge would be put over a    
 part of the river nearby and builders 
 work etc. would mean that the land    
 might have to be resown in places.The 
 coll on the river would be rebuilt,   
 but it was meant to be rebuilt a year 
 ago.                                  
    Chapelcross Power Station takes    
 millions of gallons of water from the 
 river every year.                     
   We found out that this part of the  
 river belongs to the Saville Estates  
 of London.                            </content>
