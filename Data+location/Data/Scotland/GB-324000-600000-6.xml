 brilliantly lit and richly carpeted , 
 with vivid decor . A gilt throne      
 draped with priceless red and old     
 brocade is placed beside the shrine   
 itself , a kind of alter surrounded by
 gilt Buddhas , and carrying silver    
 bowls of water and dishes of rice to  
 symbolise offerings. Displayed around 
 are many images of Buddha of which one
 thousand  are being made for the new  
 Temple which is under construction.
