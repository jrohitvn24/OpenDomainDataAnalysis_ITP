		<content> RED ROVER - This is a game for any    
 number over 8 people.  You form 2     
 teams.  Each team joins hands and     
 forms a line.  Each team then in turn 
 calls over someone by name from the   
 opposing team, saying a verse like    
 this: Red Rover, Red Rover.  Send     
 ....... right over.  The person then  
 tries to break the opposition team's  
 line.  If he or she does they return  
 to their team, but if not he or she   
 joins the team they could not break   
 through.  This continues until no one 
 is left in one of the teams.          
 CODE.  Two groups take part.  One     
 group choses a word and gives each    
 member a letter.  They are chased by  
 the other group who 'torture' them    
 when caught by twisting their arms or 
 pulling their hair to make them reveal
 their letter. This goes on until the  
 other team guesses the word.          </content>
