		<title>04Cults Hill</title>
		<content> Cults hill dominates the southeastern 
 corner of the locality, overlooking   
 the village and the River Eden below. 
 Midway up the hill is Cults farm and  
 beyond it a{limeworks}overlooks the   
 farm and cottages below.              
 The farm consists of a{farm house}and 
 four cottages for the farm workers.The
 limeworkers are housed beyond the     
 farm.A nearby field is currently being
 dug for lime.Across from the limeworks
 is a track to the{old Smithy}but the  
 building was knocked down long ago.   
 Cults has had a few businesses in the 
 past.Those businesses,now gone were   
 two Smithy's and another farm.Only the
 lime and{brickworks}still remain.     
 The hill itself when viewed from below
 is a pleasant aspect with rolling     
 fields and wooded areas.
