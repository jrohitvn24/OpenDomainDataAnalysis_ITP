		<title>12THE EFFECT OF THE BRIDGE</title>
		<content> IN 1971 THE BURRA BRIDGE WAS OPENED   
 AND IT AFFECTED BURRA LIFE GREATLY.   
 SOME PEOPLE WERE HAPPY ABOUT IT SOME  
 WERE NOT.ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES WAS    
 THAT THE DOCTOR WAS ABLE TO COME MORE 
 OFTEN.YOU DID NOT NEED TO GO TO       
 LERWICK IN A BOAT NOW YOU COULD JUST  
 GO IN A CAR. SOME PEOPLE WERE         
 UNHAPPY ABOUT THE BRIDGE.IN FACT A    
 LOT OF MEN LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE    
 THEIR JOB WAS FERRYING THE PEOPLE WHO 
 WERE GOING TO LERWICK TO DO THEIR     
 SHOPPING. AS A RESULT OF THE BRIDGE   
 THE POPULATION HAS INCREASED          
 TREMENDOUSLY AS BEFORE THERE WAS      
 LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR EMPLOYMENT IN  
 BURRA.HOWEVER,WITH THE COMING OF THE  
 BRIDGE PEOPLE WERE NOW ABLE TO TRAVEL 
 TO ANY OTHER PARTS OF THE ISLANDS     
 WHENEVER THEY WISHED.THIS HAS PROBABLY
 BEEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EVENT IN THE
 LIVES OF BURRA FOLK.                  </content>
