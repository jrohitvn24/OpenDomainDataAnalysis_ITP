		<content>{Pigkeeping and spinning}are not       
 usually associated hobbies, but they  
 can be and are! From the raw fleece   
 (of sheep not pigs), through carding  
 the wool, spinning then washing, then 
 knitting into a pullover or cardigan  
 is a very lengthy process. So, to pass
 the time, keep a pig, or to be more   
 accurate a sow. In the course of time,
 with luck will come anything up to 13 
 piglets which in turn will go to      
 market, the sow to a boar and so on.  
 From the standard {Landrace or Large  
{White}we have now moved into rare     
 breeds ie{Tamworth}and one or two     
 small litters. By this time the jersey
 or cardigan has been reknitted.       
                                       
 The pigs, like spinning and knitting, 
 can never be commercially viable. They
 are truly hobbies.
