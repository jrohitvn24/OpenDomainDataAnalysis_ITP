 At Ythanwells most of the people are  
 farmers. Their farms are big enough to
 provide work for the farmer and his   
 wife, but not to employ farmworkers.  
    Most of the ground is arable,      
 but on the higher ground there is some
 permanent grazing.Most of the farmers 
 have Massey Ferguson or International 
 tractors. They keep Hereford-Friesian 
 crossed cows mated to a Charolais bull
 to provide beef cattle.Each farmer has
 twenty to thirty cattle.The sheep kept
 are mostly black- or greyface ewes,   
 some crossed with Suffolk or Cheviot  
 rams.On each farm the farmer grows    
 turnips, barley, oats and grass for   
 hay, which is baled with a round or   
 square baler. Most farmers cut their  
 silage  and cart it into the silage   
 pits, but now some wilted grass is    
 baled and put in black polythene bags.</content>
