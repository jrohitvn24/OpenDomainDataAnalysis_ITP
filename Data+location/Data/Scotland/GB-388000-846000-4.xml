		<title>04Winter in New Deer</title>
		<content>   There was a terrific snowstorm at   
 the end of January 1984 and a large   
 area in central Buchan around New Deer
 was severely affected by the damage   
 done to electricity and water supplies
 and the disruption of transport.      
   Many thousands of wooden electricity
 poles were snapped or brought down by 
 the weight of ice on the cables. In   
 many cases the replacement poles had  
 to be ferried in by helicopter. The   
 lack of electricity meant that        
 numerous farms had no water because   
 they relied on electrical pumps.      
   Some households were without        
 electricity for 14 days despite the   
 fact that engineers had been draughted
 in from all over Scotland and even    
 from the North of England.
