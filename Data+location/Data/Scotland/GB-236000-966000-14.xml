		<content>{Peat}This is compressed vegetation    
 which is cut out of the ground, dried 
 then used for burning. Many people    
 still cut peat in the traditional way.
{Electricity }Introduced in 1957, not  
 long after the completion of the Loch 
 Shin Hydro Electric Scheme. Only a few
 houses in Durness are all electric.   
{Gas} Only a small percentage of people
 use gas.The gas that is used is called
 Calor gas and it is all bottled.It is 
 bought at the Mace store.{            
{Oil }A few people have oil fired      
 stoves and central heating systems.{  
{Coal }Many people burn coal along with
 peat. Coal is very expensive due to   
 the  high cost of transportation{     
{Wood }A regular wood round allows     
 people to burn soft wood logs.
