		<content> The Leisure Centre was opened in 1982 
 and provides the Borders with it's    
 largest recreational amenity situated 
 on the site formerly occupied by the  
 railway station on the now defunct    
 Carlisle-Edinburgh known as the       
 Waverely line. The Centre             
 attracts 2500-3000 people every week  
 who can engage in swimming, squash,   
 bowling, sauna including sunbeds, and 
 table tennis.                         
 Meals and snacks are provided in the  
 licensed bar and cafeteria. The pool  
 is a free form deck-level leisure pool
 with a small paddling area and an     
 attractive palm tree. The Centre is   
 also available for hire and social    
 events such as a Caribbean Evening    
 have been a great success.
