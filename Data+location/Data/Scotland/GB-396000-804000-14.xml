		<title>14THE COMMUNITY OF FOOTDEE</title>
		<content> Located to the east of Pocra Quay and 
 surrounded by the oil bases is the    
 picturesque village of Footdee,       
 colloquially known as 'Fitty'.This    
 Lilliputian 19th Century 'model       
 village'of single storey but and ben  
 cottages,laid out around four squares,
 still maintains its primitive charm   
 despite conceding to renovations.To   
 try and protect the character of this 
 Conservation Area the Council has     
 undertaken much of the modernisation  
 work in an effort to prevent piecemeal
 development.However locals now make   
 minor alterations often without the   
 required permission.They argue Fitty  
 is being turned into'a museum for     
 trendies to visit'or that others are  
 trying to make them live in the past. 
 Having survived the onslaught of oil  
 Fitty's problem are the proverbial    
 conflicts associated with Heritage.   </content>
