		<content> Both public houses in the village     
 attract a good following of darts     
 and domino players as well as holding 
 meetings of the pigeon-racing         
 enthusiasts and onion and leek clubs. 
    A sports committee dedicate their  
 efforts to a yearly quoits match, 5-a-
 side football competition for boys of 
 the area, and a childrens activity day
 of fancy-dress and races.             
    Having our own village school, we  
 also have our own fund-raising        
 Parent /Teacher association.          
    As most of these organisations     
 are voluntary, they depend on other   
 members of the community for financial
 support. This is realised by a        
 continuous calendar of coffee         
 evenings, dances, discos, whist drives
 and fetes, which in themselves provide
 an excellent source of entertainment.
