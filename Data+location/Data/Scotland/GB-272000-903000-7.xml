		<title>07Rogart - Lifestyle (Fleet)</title>
		<content>  The Fleet is a river which flows     
 through the Rogart valley. It has     
 existed since the Ice Age. It is a    
 very clean river and has many salmon, 
 brown trout and sea-trout in its      
 waters.                               
  The river has a good Angling Club.   
 Any person over the age of eighteen,  
 who is interested in fishing, can join
 by contacting Mr Angus, at the Rogart 
 Hotel. You can fish on six days of the
 week - it being illegal to do so on   
 Sunday. The fishing season for the    
 Fleet is from the 1st of June to the  
 30th September. There are other local 
 rules and these are explained when you
 join the Angling Club. An annual      
 membership fee of Â£2 per head must be 
 paid.
