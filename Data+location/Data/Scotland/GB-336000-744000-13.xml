		<title>13TRANSPORT AROUND GLAMIS</title>
		<content>     Almost every family in the Glamis 
 area has the use of one (or more)     
 motor vehicles.  These are either     
 owned by the family or are provided by
 the employer of one of the family.    
 Most pensioners have near relatives or
 friends with cars who take them on    
 regular shopping trips.  Teenage boys 
 favour Japanese motor cycles and      
 nearly all the younger children have  
 bicycles.                             
    Before the car came to be so       
 popular and considered a necessity,   
 there were regular and frequent bus   
 services to Dundee, Kirriemuir and    
 Forfar.  During the current transition
 from monopoly nationalised bus        
 services to private competitive       
 services, there is a trial            
 reorganisation of local routes. The   
 aim is to provide economic services   
 for travel to work and shops.         </content>
