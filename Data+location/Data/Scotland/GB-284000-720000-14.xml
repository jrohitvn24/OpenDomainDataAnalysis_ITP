		<content> Primary P2/3L were doing a project on 
 a "Growing Old/How Things Have        
 Changed" theme. As part of this work a
 survey was carried out on the elderly 
 people of Crieff. The children made up
 questionairs and then interviewed as  
 many of the elderly population as they
 could.                                
  The results showed that the majority 
 of elderly people were quite happy    
 with facilities for them , although   
 40% suggested a club with  musical    
 entertainment would be a great idea.  
   Among the hobbies an pastimes       
 enjoyed, the most popular were;       
 gardening, knitting, watching T.V.,   
 reading,  golf, fishing, meeting other
 people and visiting friends.          
  The most popular meeting places were 
 found to be the Churchguild and       
 Strathcare.
