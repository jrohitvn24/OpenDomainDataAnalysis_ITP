		<content> The Town Hall was built in the Italian
 style of architecture in 1862. Two    
 years ago it was refurbished and now  
 has a lovely hall,  in which various  
 entertainments are held, and small    
 meeting rooms.                        
                                       
 The libray is at the side of the Town 
 Hall and the museum is above the      
 library. The library is called the    
 Carnegie Library after Andrew Carnegie
 who gave the money to build it. The   
 museum contains items of local        
 interest.                             
                                       
 An Advice and Information Centre is   
 situated nearby in the High Street. It
 is open on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and   
 Fridays from 10a.m. to 12 noon and    
 from 2p.m. to 4p.m.
