		<title>19IRVINE * DREGHORN CHURCH</title>
		<content> The{Parish Church}is very unusual     
 being built with eight sides.Dreghorn 
 Parish church was built in 1780.The   
 idea for an eight sided church        
 was brought back from the continent by
 the{Earl of Eglinton,}who is buried   
 in the church graveyard with his      
 family. The stained glass windows are 
 the originals,(except one which was   
 replaced in 1982), as are the bells.  
                                       
               There have been three   
 churches on the same spot during a    
 period of{eight_hundred}years.The     
 church before was called the Columban 
 Church.The session house was once a   
 mortuary where they prepared the dead 
 bodies for burial,and was the mortuary
 for the church before.The oldest grave
 stone dates back to the{fifteenth     
{century.                              
                                       </content>
