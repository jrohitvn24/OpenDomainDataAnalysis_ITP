   Robert and I interviewed a man who  
 is unemployed and been so for 14      
 months .He had worked at Nigg.        
    When he got paid_off he immediately
 went for another job ,but he          
 was unsuccessful and has lost hope of 
 finding any work locally.  His wife is
 also unemployed and he is considering 
 moving to another area to try and find
 work. Financially they are just able  
 to cope but after high wages find it  
 very difficult. With the two major    
 employers in the area a) British      
 Aluminium completely closed down and  
 b) the Nigg yard almost on a care and 
 maintenance level unemployment is very
 high and prospects are poor.          
                                       
 .                                     </content>
