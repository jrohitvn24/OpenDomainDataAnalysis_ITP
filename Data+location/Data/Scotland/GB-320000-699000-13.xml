		<title>13RIVER LEVEN-MY PERCEPTIONS</title>
		<content> I HAVE LIVED HERE ALL MY LIFE SO I    
 FEEL PART OF IT,HAVING WITNESSED ITS  
 MANY CHANGES.                         
  WEATHER PERMITTING,THE SURROUNDING   
 COUNTRYSIDE OFFERS MANY PLEASANT      
 WALKS.MY FAVOURITE IS ALONG THE RIVER 
 LEVEN.DUE TO INCREASING UNEMPLOYMENT I
 WILL HAVE TO MOVE UNLESS A SUITABLE   
 JOB OCCURS,WHEN I WOULD DEFINITELY    
 STAY.AT 16 I AM AWARE OF THE GOOD AND 
 BAD OF THE AREA.IT'S SAD TO SEE THE   
 OPEN COUNTRYSIDE ENVELOPED BY         
 "SHOE-BOX" HOUSES AND THE RATE OF     
 VANDALISM IS CONSTANTLY INCREASING.   
  I LIVE IN WEST PARK,LESLIE AND       
 FORTUNATELY COMMUNITY SPIRIT SURVIVES,
 MAKING IT A FRIENDLY PLACE BUT WITHOUT
 ENTERTAINMENT FOR MY AGE.IN TWO YEARS 
 TIME I CAN GO TO DISCOS IN GLENROTHES.
  I LOVE THE AREA I LIVE IN AND HAVE   
 BEEN BROUGHT UP IN,BUT ISN'T EVERYONE 
 THE SAME?                             </content>
