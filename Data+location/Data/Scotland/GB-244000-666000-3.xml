		<content> The Excelsior Hotel is an imposing    
 structure nine storeys high which is  
 situated 100 yards from the main      
 terminal building of Glasgow Airport. 
 The hotel has 305 rooms and two rest- 
 aurants:the Ranfurley-which is a la   
 carte-and the Carvery.There is also a 
 function suite,a lounge,a bar and a   
 hairdressers.The clients are mostly   
 businessmen usually staying no more   
 than two nights.Because of the hotel's
 situation few tourists stay here      
 except for a few in the summer.       
    There are 138 full-time and part - 
 time staff in the hotel.Parking       
 facilities are inadequate,but plans   
 for further extension have so far been
 unsuccessful as the adjacent land     
 belongs to the British Airport Author-
