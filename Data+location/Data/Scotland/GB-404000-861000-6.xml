		<title>06Hairy - Willy/ Dried Fish</title>
		<content> In the village  of{St.Combs}an older  
 resident called{Mrs.J.Forman}dries    
 fish.For the past few years she has   
 been doing this on her own at home.   
 Before this she worked with another   
 lady for nine years using a fish      
 processing machine.                   
 Long ago people dried fish for a      
 winter's meal as they could not fish  
 as often during the winter.           
{Mrs.Forman}dries fish just for        
 something to do,but she does sell some
 of it and keeps the rest for herself. 
 When she is going to eat the fish she 
 mixes it with mashed potatoes and this
 is known locally as{'Hairy Willy'.}
