		<title>17Longevity in  Bourtie</title>
		<content> There are several families in Bourtie 
 where elder relations have lived into 
 thei nineties.  Longevity canot be    
 directly related to an outdor farming 
 life, but it will be interesting to   
 see whether use of chemical sprays in 
 more recent years has any efect on    
 lonevity in future generations.  There
 are several families living where four
 generations are still extant, the     
 eldest being over ninety, sometimes   
 over 100.  It is commonplace for      
 funerals held in Boutie Kirkyar       
 (churcyard) to be for persons in their
 eighties.  The most noted lifespan is 
 associated with the Duguid family of  
 Boutie House. Miss Mary Duguid died in
 1985, aged 97.  She was born in 1888, 
 when her farther, Peter Duguid, was 71
 years old.  he was born five years    
 after the Napoleonic War in 1817.
