 The chairman of A'Muchty and District 
 branch of the N.E. Fife cnservative   
 Assoc. is to visit the Commodore      
 computer show in London.Having        
 successfully used his own commodore   
 both in the local and European        
 elections, he and his branch are      
 convinced that the use of new         
 information technolgy for improved    
 contact with electors is just one of  
 the benefits to be gained.            
 Speaking in 'muchty the chairman said:

 party best able to respond to changes 
 in society and to the needs of the    
 people.I believe that using computers 
 in a local way,responds to local      
 desire for information about current  
 events.                               </content>
