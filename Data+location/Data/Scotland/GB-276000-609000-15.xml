		<title>15Music, Crafts and Dance</title>
		<content> In Sanquhar there is neither a cinema 
 nor a theatre, but there is a long    
 tradition of music in the town. There 
 is a musical society which competes in
 the annual Dumfries Music Festival as 
 do our youth organisations, school    
 choirs and young musicians from the   
 school orchestra, the silver band and 
 a nearby pipe band. Young people have 
 formed two "pop" groups and a dance   
 band. A violin maker of international 
 repute resides in Sanquhar. A dance   
 school teaching ballet, Highland and  
 tap dancing is held weekly and a      
 Scottish Country Dance class is held  
 regularly 4 miles NW of town. Old     
 crafts such as Crook-making, spinning 
 and weaving and hand knitting of the  
 traditional "Sanquhar" patterns still 
 survive. Examples of all these crafts 
 are displayed in our museum, which has
 just celebrated its tenth anniversary.</content>
