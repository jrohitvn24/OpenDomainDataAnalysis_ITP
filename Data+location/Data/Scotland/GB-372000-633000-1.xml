		<title>01General Description of Kelso</title>
		<content> Kelso is a small rural town in Borders
 Region with a population of just under
 6000 people.{Kelso Square}is famous   
 because of its ancient cobbles and the
 Town Hall. The{Abbey}has been standing
 for centuries but now only ruins      
 remain. The river{Tweed}runs through  
 Kelso and the{Teviot}flows into it at 
 the Junction Pool which is famous for 
 its salmon fishing.{Kelso Bridge}is a 
 small version of Waterloo Bridge in   
 London and it has lights which, at    
 night make beautiful reflections in   
 the river. There is lovely{farmland   
{round Kelso.}Oilseed Rape which is    
 bright yellow makes the countryside   
 very colourful. There is a{racecourse 
 and a{point-to-point}course for       
 horseracing. We also have many        
 different{clubs}for keepfit, sewing,  
 all kinds of sports, angling, music,  
 photography, etc. I like Kelso.       </content>
