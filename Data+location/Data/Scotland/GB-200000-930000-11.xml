		<title>11MUIR BURNING</title>
		<content>   One weekend at  Easter I went down  
 to my Gran's at Clashnessie.  The next
 day I went    heather (muir) burning  
 with Norman at the Falls-side of his  
 croft.                                
 You sometimes need to burn heather    
 when the old heather is too tough for 
 the sheep to chew.  The old growth    
 will be replaced by new shoots and    
 grass.                                
   When you set a fire you must watch  
 it until it burns out.  This          
 spring-time many fires in the Assynt  
 area ran out of control. This was     
 probably due to a long spell without  
 heavy rain.  Fire brigades from       
 Lochinver and Ullapool battled through
 the night to contain the blazes.      
 Luckily no livestock were killed.     
   Heather burning can only be carried 
 out until the 1st April before the    
 birds start building their nests.     </content>
