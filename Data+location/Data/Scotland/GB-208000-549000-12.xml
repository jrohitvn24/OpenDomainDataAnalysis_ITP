		<title>12EDUCATION AT SANDHEAD</title>
		<content> by Gavin Jakeman aged 11              
    Sandhead School is quite a small   
 school but I think it is a very good  
 one. We have 6 classrooms, a Remedial 
 Room, an Art Room, a staffroom, and an
 office. We have only 4 teachers in our
 school and so, of the two spare rooms,
 one is used as a Library/Computer Room
 and the other as an Audio/Visual Room.
 In the Computer Room we have 6        
 Sinclair Spectrum computers which we  
 hope to Interface and Microdrive next 
 session. We use the A/V Room for      
 watching TV programmes - both live and
 recorded; for looking at slides; and  
 for producing plays for our Puppet    
 Theatre. The school playing field is 1
 kilometre away, down in the village.  
 Visitors to the beach use the field in
 the summer and the goalmouth gets all 
 rough and holed, which is very bad for
 goalkeepers like myself.              </content>
