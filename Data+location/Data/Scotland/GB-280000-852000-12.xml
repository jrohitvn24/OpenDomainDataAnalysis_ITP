		<title>12LIFESTYLES IN GOLLANFIELD</title>
		<content> My dad works for the local oil        
 fabrication yard.He works less hours  
 now that he is on staff and he also   
 gets a car from them.He draws all the 
 plans in stages for the oil rigs.     
   My dad also comes in to why we live 
 here.We live here because he could    
 only get a job up here and not in     
 England.It is different from Yorkshire
 because in Scotland there is lots of  
 nice countryside and it is so         
 interesting,but in England it is so   
 noisy and cars are coming up and down 
 all the time                          
   On Sunday, first we would get up and
 go to church,then we have a           
 light lunch,then in the afternoon we  
 go for a walk and then we sometimes go
 for dinner in a restaurant.           
 Our house is a semi-detached bungalow.
