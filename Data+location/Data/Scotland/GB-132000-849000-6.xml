		<content> When visitors come to us for bed and  
 breakfast, they ask where they can get
 an evening meal and we send them to   
 one of the Edinbane Hotels or to the  
 restaurant in Kildonan. There is      
 another hotel in Greshornish, across  
 the bay. This is a good centre for    
 tourists; older people enjoy walking  
 and photographing the scenery and fot 
 teenagers there is a sports centre    
 with badminton, pool and table-tennis.
 On a summer evening the sunsets are   
 beautiful with the red still showing  
 in the sky at midnight. In clear      
 weather it is never really dark in    
 mid-simmer. In the evenings there is a
 variety of entertainment in the       
 hotels;  ceilidh, mucis and dancing   
 while there is disco dancing in the   
 sports centre. The scent of peat fires
 is also popular with tourists. Some   
 tourists enjoy water sports.          </content>
