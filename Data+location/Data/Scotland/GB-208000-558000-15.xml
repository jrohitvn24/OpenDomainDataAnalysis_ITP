		<content> I live in a Wigtonshire village. At   
 12.30 we have lunch. Some people      
 have it at school and others at home. 
 I have my lunch at home. I have meat  
 balls and toast. At 13.05 I go back to
 school and play 'King, Queen, Jock'.  
 Somebody throws you the ball, if you  
 drop it everybody runs away. When you 
 get the ball you shout'Stop'. Then you
 throw the ball to hit some-one below  
 the knee. When you hit them you are   
 called duchess and the other person is
 out. When the bell rings we come in   
 and do geography and painting. I paint
 a kite because we have just tried to  
 make one at school. At 15.00 we have  
 free choice so I do a word game on the
 computer. At 15.30 we go home and     
 after playing I have sausages, beans  
 and potatoes. Then I play on my       
 computer. At 19.30 I watch 'Coronation
 Street' on television then go to bed. </content>
