		<content>    NO ONE IN SHIELDAIG TODAY LIVES BY 
 CROFTING ALONE.   THE WALLED ENCLOSURE
 IS NOW USED FOR ROUGH GRAZING,        
 ALTHOUGH THE LIVESTOCK ARE STILL      
 TURNED OUT IN THE SPRING, WHEN        
 POTATOES AND HAY ARE GROWN.   THE     
 NURSE KEEPS CHICKENS ON THIS GROUND   
 AND THE ONLY COWS ARE A HIGHLAND COW  
 AND HER CALF.   A FEW HORSES GRAZE    
 HERE IN THE WINTER AND ARE USED FOR   
 PONY TRECKING BY THE TOURISTS AND     
 LOCAL CHILDREN.                       
    THE PEOPLE WHO OWN CROFTS NOW MAKE 
 THEIR LIVING IN OTHER WAYS _ FISHING  
 BUILDING OR THE SERVICE INDUSTRIES.   
    THE LAND IS NOW GIVEN OVER TO SHEEP
 REARING.   THEY GRAZE ON THE CROFT AND
 THE LAND SURROUNDING THE VILLAGE, EVEN
 IN THE VILLAGE ITS SELF.   THEY WILL  
 DEVASTATE YOUR GARDEN IF YOU          
 INADVERTENTLY LEAVE THE GATE OPEN.
