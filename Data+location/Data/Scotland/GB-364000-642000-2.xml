		<content> Gordon school was built ten years ago 
 in 1975.There are four classrooms but 
 only three are used that is because   
 there is not enough children.In 1885  
 the roll of the old Gordon school was 
 135 today 100 years on there are only 
 50 children.The school has a large    
 playground which is mostly tarmac with
 a quite large grass area.The          
 classrooms are quite spacious with    
 small groups of tables dotted around  
 it.There are two wet areas which      
 are shared between the classes.The wet
 areas are used for art and junk       
 modeling.The school has a large       
 hall.It also has a medium sized       
 dinning room.We have three teachers   
 and some visiting teachers .They teach
 p.e, music, drama and sewing.The boys 
 do art and craft.Gordon also has a    
 playgroup for pre school chidren.It is
