		<title>01The Area Around Loch Insh</title>
		<content> This area is situated about the centre
 of Spey Valley. There is only one     
 small vilalge called Kincraig which   
 houses a few hundred people. Also     
 included in this aea is Kincraig      
 Wildlife Park which is quite large and
 contains quite a lot of wild animals. 
 At present it costs five pounds for a 
 carload of people to go in and it is  
 popular with young children.Loch Insh 
 is themain attraction though with its 
 waersports centre sited at the eAst   
 end of the Loch. Here there are       
 facilities for a number of sports     
 including wind surfing, canoeing and  
 sailing, there is one railway which   
 connects Edinburgh with Inverness     
 running through Kincraig and one main 
 road the A9,bypassing it. The old A9  
 runs through Kincraig but was replaced
 a few years ago by a straighter,faster
 road.                                 </content>
