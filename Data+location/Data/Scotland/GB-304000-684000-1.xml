		<content>    The 12 square kilometres of our    
 study is a rural area to the west of  
 the ancient Scottish town of          
 Dunfermline. It is an undulating area 
 of countryside, sloping overall from a
 high point of 70 metres in the north  
 down to the Firth of Forth in the     
 south. The bedrock of mainly limestone
 and sandstone is overlain by a thick  
 layer of boulder clay, and this clay  
 is ideal for the arable farming which 
 dominates the area. Barley is the most
 common crop in 1985, but potatoes,    
 wheat, and many fields of oil-seed    
 rape were also seen.                  
    The rural nature of the area is    
 gradually being altered by the growth 
 of the villages of Cairneyhill and    
 Crossford, with many large housing    
 estates being built in the past few   
 years. Crombie village is, however,   
 somewhat in decline.                  </content>
