		<content> The effects of good housing, clean air
 and active life-styles combine to     
 create an enviroment in which such    
 health problems as exist at LINDEAN   
 are mainly associated with old age.A  
 local Health Centre staffed by four   
 general practitioners,district nurses,
 auxiliaries and office workers is     
 located in Selkirk, which also        
 possesses a small cottage hospital    
 mainly for geriatric and chronic cases
 .A general hospital,originally a      
 military hospital serving the Borders 
 Region is shortly to be replaced by a 
 modern hospital on a site near        
 Melrose.All of these provisions are   
 adminstered by the Border Health Board
 which also controls a hospital for the
 mentally sick and a college for       
 nursing. Specialist nursing and       
 treatment are provided by arrangement 
 with hospitals in Edinburgh.          </content>
