		<content>     The Lady of the Wood              
 'I went into the wood to explore and  
 it was very quiet. It had rained and  
 the trees were slender and smooth.    
 The twigs were delicate and covered   
 with blossom giving the air a fresh   
 and fragrant smell. The leaves were   
 soft and silky and the wind made the  
 trees murmur.                         
 Then I saw the tree called the Lady of
 the Woods. She was sitting right in   
 the middle of the wood. She swayed    
 from side to side and the wind gently 
 rustled the leaves glistening in the  
 sunlight. The smooth fragile leaves   
 danced as a wisp of wind caught them.'
 This was written by a boy of ten after
 we stood in the middle of our little  
 group of trees and really looked and  
 listened.
