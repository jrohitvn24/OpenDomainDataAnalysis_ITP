		<content> I get up at 0745 and get washed and   
 dressed. Then I have my breakfast. I  
 have cereal. At 0825 I call for Greig 
 and we go to school. We arrive about  
 0845. At 0900 we go inside and do some
 maths until break at 1040. I usually  
 play football up on the field. At 1100
 we come inside and do English until   
 1135, when we go to music. Sometimes  
 we sing or play some instruments. At  
 1230 we have our lunch. I have a      
 packed lunch of sandwiches, a drink   
 and some biscuits. Then I play        
 football until 1330 when we come      
 inside. We then do project work until 
 1520 when we go home. I get changed   
 and go out to play football until 1730
 when I have to go in to get my tea. I 
 have pizza, chips and beans. Then I   
 watch T.V. until 2115 when I go to    
 bed. I read until 2200 when I go to   
 sleep.                                </content>
