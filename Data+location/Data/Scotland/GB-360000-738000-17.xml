		<title>17ARBROATH LOCAL HISTORY.</title>
		<content> Arbroath Football Club has been       
 celebrating the hundredth anniversary 
 of its record breaking 36-0 victory   
 over Aberdeen Bon Accord and 1985 has 
 seen the anniversary of another{event}
 which was to be important to the town.
 This was the opening of Kerr's        
 Miniature Railway.The railway,which   
 has delighted many{tourists}and locals
 over the years,is the oldest miniature
 railway in Scotland.A special open day
 is planned.                           
       Although Arbroath is a very old 
 town,growing up around the Abbey,all  
 the really old{housing}in our area has
 disappeared.People interested in{local
{history}before the 19th. century would
 have to visit Kellie Castle,Arbirlot  
 village,or Hospitalfield House which  
 is now being modernised but was       
 previously an art gallery.
