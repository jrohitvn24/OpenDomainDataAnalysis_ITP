		<title>16INCOMERS TO CARBOST</title>
		<content> People choose to come and live in our 
 area for varied reasons.Often they are
 retiring.We asked one such couple to  
 explain why they chose here.          
 "We first visited Skye in summer      
 1962,spending a holiday at Talisker,4 
 miles from Carbost.This we so much    
 enjoyed that we continued coming back 
 every year for the next 13 years!By   
 that time my husband was about to     
 retire and so in 1975 we returned once
 more,this time to stay in our own     
 house which we had built.             
 We settled here because we had begun  
 to feel quite at home in this part of 
 Skye and knew that we could follow the
 leisure activities we both            
 enjoy-sailing,fishing and             
 hill-walking.We have made many friends
 and now would not like to live        
 anywhere else!"
