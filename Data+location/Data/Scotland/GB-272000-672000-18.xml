		<title>18POLICE IN CUMBERNAULD</title>
		<content> A{community policeman}tries to{prevent
 crimes happening rather than solving  
 crimes after they have happened. They 
 undergo{special training}and{do not   
{wear uniforms}so that they are more   
 like members of the public. There are 
 two police officers in this area whose
 job is to work closely with the{local 
{community.}One of ther duties is to   
 give people advise on making their{   
{homes and shops safe}from thieves.    
 Housebreaking is one of the most      
 common crimes in this area.           
 They also spend a lot of time {       
{visiting primary and secondary}schools
 in the area to teach young people     
 about the role of the police. Their   
 other main duty is organising         
 activities such as{youth clubs and    
{discos}in the evening. This is        
 important because many young people   
 who are unemployed may turn to crime. </content>
