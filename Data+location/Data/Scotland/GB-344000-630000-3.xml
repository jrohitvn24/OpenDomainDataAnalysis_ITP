		<title>03THE HOUSE AT SUNDERLAND HALL</title>
		<content> The house at Sunderland Hall is       
 occupied by Mr and Mrs Smyllie.  The  
 house was rebuilt about the end of the
 1600's by a Mr. Brice. On the same    
 site there was a house in the garden  
 overlooking the Tweed.                
 It was called Sunderland Hall because 
 the land was split (sunderland).  Some
 of the houses were demolished when the
 Selkirk to Peebles road was           
 straightened.                         
 When Mr. and Mrs. Smyllie bought the  
 land they sold cottages and bought    
 back some of the hill ground.         
 Mr. Hunter's house on the Peebles to  
 Selkirk road was once a childrens'    
 home.  The children were evacuees from
 Edinburgh in the Second World War.    
 They used to walk to Selkirk and back 
 on a Sunday for church.  Some of them 
 still return to the area to visit.
