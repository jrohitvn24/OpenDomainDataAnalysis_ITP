		<title>12FARMING - DEER</title>
		<content> A years' work of the head gamekeeper  
 on the Ben Alder Estate.              
 Ben Alder is 25,000acres. It is       
 financed from business in London and  
 belongs to Mr. Byam-Cooke. The estate 
 has 1,000 hinds and 400 stage at the  
 1985 deer count.                      
 Jan/Feb. The deer are fed on cattle   
 cake and hay at a cost of Â£5,000 a    
 year. Both male and females mix       
 together for the feeding in winter    
 time but this is abnormal behaviour.  
 They usually only meet at mating time 
 and stray on different parts of the   
 hills. A long trail of food is left to
 feed all ages of deer for 1-2 miles   
 long each day. The Royal stags with 12
 points on their antlers are given     
 whisky as extra food. The weather     
 changes quickly to arctic conditions  
 and Mr. Oswald keeps alert for hikers 
 in distress.                          </content>
