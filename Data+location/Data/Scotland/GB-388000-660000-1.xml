		<title>01Fertile valley E. of Reston</title>
		<content> The village of Reston lies in a       
 fertile valley with good A1 quality   
 land, and has over the years become   
 an agricultural centre for the farming
 hinerland. The main railway line runs 
 through  village but no longer stops  
 in Reston itself. This led to its     
 development as a cattle market        
 centre, which has in recent years     
 declined. This has resulted in the    
 overall decline of the village,which  
 had a population of 275 in 1981.  The 
 village has developed in a linear     
 pattern along the railway line. The   
 decline in agricultural activity as a 
 cattle centre has had an effect on the
 outlying farms with many properties   
 becoming derelict. Evidence of mans   
 influence in the area can be seen by  
 th removal of fences and the provision
 of double sized gates, to cater for   
 the modern combine harvester.         </content>
