 Lynturk Church is 121 years old.      
 Cushnie and Lynturk is a joint parish 
 served by one Church of Scotland      
 minister. The congregational roll is  
 275. Services are held each Sunday on 
 alternate months at Lynturk and       
 Cushnie. 12 children are on the Sunday
 school roll.                          
                                       
        {Halloween.                    
 At halloween we hollow out turnips and
 cut out a face so that the candle     
 light shines through. Then we all     
 dress up and go round to folks houses 
 where we perform a piece in the hopes 
 of being given a reward. This is known
 as Guisering.                         
 Some times we have parties and duck   
 for apples which are floating in a    
 bowl of water.
