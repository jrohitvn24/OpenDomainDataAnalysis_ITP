		<content>  In this area there are three primary 
 schools,{BENARTY}with a roll of 335,  
{CROSSHILL}(152),and{St. KENNETH'S RC} 
{SCHOOL}with nursery (131).{DUNMORE}   
{NURSERY}has about 40 pre-school       
 children. At present, Crosshill and   
 Benarty children transfer to{BALLINGRY
{JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL}(roll 433), though 
 this year more than a third have opted
 to go instead to Beath High. When the 
 new Lochgelly High School opens in a  
 few years' time, Ballingry JHS will   
 close. It seems likely that the BJHS  
 building will be converted for use as 
 a primary, and Benarty and Crosshill  
 will close. St. Kenneth's pupils move 
 on to St. Columba's in Dunfermline.   
 Attached to the BJHS building is a    
{SPECIAL EDUCATION UNIT}whose present  
 roll of 57 children come from a large 
 part of west Fife.
