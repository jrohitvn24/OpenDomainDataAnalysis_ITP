		<title>02SKERRIES INTERNAL TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> As this is an{island,}the most common 
 form of transport is small{boats,}34  
 in all mainly inshore pleasure craft. 
 The commonest length is 18-20 feet.   
 There are some larger and smaller     
 craft. There is one company owned     
 boat, the Boy Jan used for Salmon     
 farming. It is about  35 feet long.   
                                       
 There are 28{bikes}on the isle but    
 very few are used. There are 25{cars  
 most are on their last legs. The most 
 common type of car is a Mini. There   
 are 9{tractors}and 4{vans}used for    
 farming and moving stuff around the  }
 isle.                                 
                                       
 There are only 2 miles of single track
 road on Skerries so many places can   
 only be reached on{foot}and this is   
 still one of the most frequently used 
 forms of transport.                   </content>
