		<title>16THE TRAVELLING PEOPLE</title>
		<content>{There are travelling people's camps at
{Tarvit Mill and a site on Ceres Road  
{but there is no official base in this 
{area.}They live in caravans and use   
 old cars for transportation.They look 
 for casual labour and they collect    
 scrap metal and sell it.At harvest    
 time they make some money by picking  
 berries and potatoes.                 
     The girls help with housework and 
 looking after younger children and the
 boys help their fathers.              
     Probably their only luxury is a   
 television.They are proud of their    
 traditions and wouldn't want to live  
 any other way.                        
   {A new project has been formed to   
{teach their children.A teacher travels
{to their sites to teach basic reading 
{and writing.
