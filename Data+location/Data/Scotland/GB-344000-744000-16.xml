		<title>16Housing In Inverarity</title>
		<content> The housing in Inverarity village is  
 modern  compared  with the houses on  
 the nearby farms. The houses in the   
 village were built  pre_1940 and are  
 large two or three bedroom homes.Many 
 have been updated by the tennants in  
 the last few years.The older houses   
 are mainly owned by the large         
 farms.Mainy of these are in poor      
 condition as little money can be      
 spared to update the property.All of  
 the houses are not on a main sewer    
 system and this causes problems at    
 times of flooding.
