		<title>07EMPLOYMENT IN NEWTON MEARNS</title>
		<content> Newton Mearns does not have large     
 industries. However many people are   
 employed locally in shops, offices,   
 schools, hospitals and other service  
 industries.                           
   The majority of professional and    
 other workers commute to Glasgow,     
 Paisley and East Kilbride. They choose
 to live in this very pleasant high    
 amenity suburb of Glasgow and are     
 within easy reach of their places of  
 work. It is also very easy to reach   
 places of scenic beauty, yachting     
 marinas on the Clyde, and many other  
 tourist attractions.                  
   Many professional workers who are   
 transferred to Glasgow from other     
 places are very pleasantly surprised  
 by the quality of life that can be had
 in area such as this.
