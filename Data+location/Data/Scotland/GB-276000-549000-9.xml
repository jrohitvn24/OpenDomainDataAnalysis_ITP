		<content> Mr Innes is a designer, his office is 
 in Auchencairn. He designs tractor    
 cabs, speed boats, cars and caravans. 
 He sells his designs all over the     
 world.He designs tractor cabs for     
 Fords, his latest design has dark     
 windows and has digital instruments   
 inside. The engine is covered, not    
 open as it is on most tractors.       
 One of his best known designs is of an
 electrically driven car which can seat
 one person, it will be used in towns. 
 When he starts a new design he first  
 of all makes a model to see how it    
 will look, then he takes photographs  
 of it, adding different colours till  
 he thinks it looks right. From the    
 time he makes the first drawing until 
 the design is in production can take  
 from three to five years.
