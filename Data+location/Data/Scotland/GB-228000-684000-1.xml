		<content> Predominatly farmland the area is     
 sparsely populated and utiliZed for   
 stock both dairy &amp; single suckler cows
 &amp; sheep. Nearly all the land is owned 
 by Luss estates but most of the land  
 let.  Being so close to Helensborgh it
 is also much used for Recreation -    
 Mostly informal.  Glen Fruin running &amp;
 Joging races vie with walkers and     
 picnickers along the roads and close  
 to the river.  Highlandman's wood     
 (replanted 1985) is also used by RHU &amp;
 Dhuhillr residents to exercise dogs.  
 All the land is wet &amp;  boggy and needs
 constant maintenance to keep good     
 grassland.  There are obviously (to   
 the eye) good &amp; poor farmers as with  
 the state of walls and fences.
