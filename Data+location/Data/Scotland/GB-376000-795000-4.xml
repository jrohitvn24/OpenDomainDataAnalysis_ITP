		<title>04Forests in Woodlands</title>
		<content> Our community is called Woodlands of  
 Durris because of the huge amount of  
 trees around.Quite a bit of the block 
 is covered in woods.Most of them are  
 conifers.A lot of these are being cut 
 down and replaced by oak or more      
 conifers.The oak plants are enclosed  
 by a yellow tube to protect them from 
 rabbits.The conifers are mostly Sitka 
 Spruce,Scots pine,and Larch.The       
 forests were mainly planted           
 deliberately by the Forestry          
 Commission.Down in Woodlands Park,an  
 old estate,there are mostly           
 Rhododendron bushes,as well as        
 deciduous trees like Silver           
 Birch,Beech,Oak,Ash,Rowan and Horse   
 Chestnut.There are also evergreens    
 like Sequoia,Cypress,Cedar,Pine and   
 Holly. Woodlands Park is well known   
 for the variety of trees that grow    
 there.                                </content>
