		<title>06URIOCH FARM</title>
		<content> Urioch is a livestock farm, part of   
 Hensol farms group. It has 600 acres  
 of land; 100 acres of hill land, 30   
 acres of woodland and the rest is     
 permanant pasture. Each year 80 acres 
 of this is cut for silage and 10 acres
 for hay. Livestock include 90 suckler 
 cows and calves. There are about 200  
 sheep and lambs each year. There are  
 3 milking cows providing sufficient   
 milk for the house and the calves. One
 new building houses the calves during 
 winter. There they are fattened for   
 selling in the following spring. The  
 lambs are fattened, then sold. Three  
 permanent farm workers are employed   
 who work on all the Hensol farms, each
 farm having its own manager. Farm     
 buildings are old but in good         
 condition. The surrounding area of the
 countryside is pleasant.
