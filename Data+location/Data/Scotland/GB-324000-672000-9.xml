		<title>09Life of a Chorister</title>
		<content> When you are a{chorister}you have a   
 long hard day. School begins at 0830. 
 As well as the usual academic         
 subjects, music lessons and choir     
 practice have to be fitted in. The day
 ends with the sung service of Evensong
 and we finally go home at 1800.       
 The day occasionally includes a       
 special{service}such as Ascension Day 
 or someone's funeral. Our busiest days
 are Good Friday, with the St.         
 Matthew's Passion, and Christmas,     
 which is so busy that no-one opens    
 presents till Boxing Day.             
 At services we wear red cassocks,     
 white surpices and white ruffs. We are
 paid 4p per service and we are fined  
 20p for misbehaving.                  
 Being a chorister has its advantages. 
 On our tour to U.S.A. we got into     
 Disneyland free, because we gave a    
 concert there of Scottish songs.      </content>
