 Of nine houses in West Park in the    
 village of{St Combs,}six people had   
 jobs and three were at home.Only two  
 people actually worked in the village 
 itself.This reflects the general trend
 in the village as there are a couple  
 of shops,a chip shop,a joiner,a motor 
 mechanic,a hotel and the school.Most  
 people work in either,{Fraserburgh,   
{Peterhead}or the sorrounding area.If  
 they work outside the village they    
 travel mostly by bus or car.
