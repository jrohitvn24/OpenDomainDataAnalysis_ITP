		<title>15HAWICK RUGBY CLUB.</title>
		<content> Hawick Rugby Club is over lOO years   
 old. The club has a most famous       
 history including many Scottish       
 championships and Border League       
 titles and it has produced 48         
 internationalists, including the most 
 capped Scottish player, Jim Renwick,  
 with 52 caps. Mansfield Park is a well
 organised ground with a big stand as  
 well as clubrooms and squash courts.  
 It is a very busy place between       
 September and April with as many as   
 3OOO people attending some matches. It
 requires hard work on the part of the 
 committee who have to organise these  
 matches as well as making arrangements
 when the team travel to play away from
 home. The ground staff also work very 
 hard to keep the pitch in good order  
 and to keep the whole ground looking  
 nice.
