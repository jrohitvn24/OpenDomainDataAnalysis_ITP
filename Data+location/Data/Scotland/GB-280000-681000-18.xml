		<content> Denny and Dunipace are situated in    
 Central Region, the most historic part
 of Scotland. Dunipace appears to have 
 more historical association than      
 Denny. In Roman times, the{Antonine   
{Wall}was 4 or 5 kilometres South and  
 the Celts in our area were very       
 fierce. Legend tells us that the      
 Romans made a peace treaty with the   
 local tribes and to commemorate it 2  
 hills were built which are still there
 and are called the Hills of Dunipace. 
 Even the name is part Gaelic and part 
 Latin, Dun=Hill, Pace=Peace. Years    
 later, the Gaelic poet,{Ossian,}wrote 
 of combats between great Celtic heroes
 on the banks of the River Carron.     
 Picts and Scots also fought nearby.   
 The 8th century{Dunipace Brooch,}now  
 in a museum in Edinburgh, reminds us  
 of the artistic qualities of our      
 Celtic past.                          </content>
