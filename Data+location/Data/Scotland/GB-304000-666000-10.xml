		<title>10THE LIVINGSTON TEENAGER</title>
		<content> The Livingston teenager is apparently 
 faced with a host of activities to    
 choose from.                          
 However,despite the wide choice of    
 sports,the shopping centre is accepted
 as a general meeting place and on     
 Saturdays,the centreis mobbed wwith   
 teenagers.                            
 Melvilles disco (one of the most      
 sophisticated in Britain) is open for 
 teenagers on a Wednesday evening and  
 this is popular for "eyeing up the    
 talent".                              
 At the moment,the town is crawling    
 with break-dancers and bicycle motor  
 cross cyclists.                       
 Our walls are liberally decorated with
 graffiti,as everyone wants to voice   
 their opinions.                       
 Glue sniffing is a major social       
 problem at present.
