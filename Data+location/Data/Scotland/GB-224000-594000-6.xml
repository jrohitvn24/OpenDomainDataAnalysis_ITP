		<title>06EMPLOYMENT IN THE BARR AREA</title>
		<content> 95% of the area is "highland" used    
 mainly for sheep-there is relatively  
 little employment.Those who are       
 employed on the land are mainly       
 shepherds.There is a high proportion  
 of tenant farmers whose children      
 usually have to leave the area to find
 employment. The village is a          
 "dormitory village" with the people of
 working age travelling to Girvan or   
 Ayr to their places of employment.    
 The nearby Forestry Commission at     
 Changue Forest employs a small        
 percentage of the villagers. The two  
 hotels provide employment for         
 only four people.The store/post office
 employs four ladies(part-time).       
 Strathclyde Regional Council employs  
 the teachers,janitor and cook(in the  
 school),the hallkeeper, roadman and   
 water-works operator. The minister and
 doctor also "work" in the area.       </content>
