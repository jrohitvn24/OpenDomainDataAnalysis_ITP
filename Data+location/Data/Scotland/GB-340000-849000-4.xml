		<title>04 Whisky Distilling in Keith</title>
		<content>Distilling Scotch whisky is one of the 
main industries of Keith.The Strathmill
Distillery was founded in 1832 by A.G. 
Johnston.It is now owned by Justerini  
and Brooks and employs 20 people.      
 The process of making Scotch Whisky   
takes over 3 years.First the malt      
barley arrives at the distillery       
where stones are sifted out before it  
is ground to a coarse meal.It is       
thoroughly mixed with spring water and 
the malt extract is drawn off into     
fermenting tubs called Wash Backs.Small
amounts of yeast are added to form     
alcohol.This dilute alcohol is then fed
into the copper stills where it is     
boiled and condensed into a clear      
spirit.The spirit is filled into wooden
casks which are stored in large bonded 
warehouses.After a minimum  period of  
3 years it is removed for   blending   
or bottling for sale to customers.     </content>
