		<content> The island is formed entirely of hard 
 volcanic rock (greenstone) and rises  
 60 metres above sea level. It is      
 tilted slightly eastwards, resulting  
 in steep cliffs on the west and       
 south-west.                           
 The sea has carved a series of rock   
 arches, stacks and caves along the    
 steep west cliffs, and many small     
 inlets along the low lying east coast.
 Some of these inlets divide the island
 in three at high tide; the main       
 island, the North Ness, and Rona which
 is joined to the main island by an    
 iron bridge. A deep steep sided       
 valley, The Black Heugh bisects the   
 main island. The Black Heugh has been 
 dammed at its western end to form a   
 freshwater loch. Beyond the dam is the
 Mill Door, a fine example of a natural
 arch. The average rise and fall of the
 tide is 3 metres.                     </content>
