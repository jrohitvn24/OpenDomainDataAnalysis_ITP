		<title>13THE BRECHIN ADVERTISER</title>
		<content> This newspaper was founded by David   
 Burns and the first copy published on 
 3/10/1848.It cost 2 old pence. Adverts
 only filled one page of that edition  
 which included national and           
 international news as well as local   
 stories. Nowadays 3500 copies are     
 printed weekly. No reporters are      
 employed and all the news that appars 
 is provided by the public. It is sold 
 in Brechin and in shops up to 15 miles
 away. About 100 copies a week are sent
 abroad to Brechin exiles in places    
 like Canada, India and Australia. The 
 present cost is 12p. Usually there    
 are 16 pages. An analysis of a recent 
 edition revealed the following        
 proportions. Adverts, from local firms
 and organisations, now account  for   
 75% of the space; local news occupies 
 15%; photographs 7%. The remaining    
 space has letters.                    </content>
