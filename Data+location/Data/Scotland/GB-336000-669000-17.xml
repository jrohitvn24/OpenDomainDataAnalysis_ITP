		<title>17CARBERRY CANDLES</title>
		<content> THE CANDLEWORKS WAS A LAUNDRY FOR     
 CARBERRY TOWER. THERE ARE 14 STAFF IN 
 THE  FACTORY. THE WAX COMES FROM SHELL
 OIL. THEY DO NOT MAKE CHURCH CANDLES  
 BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OF BEESWAX. THE 
 DYES AND MACHINERY COME FROM GERMANY. 
 THE CANDLES ARE ALL SHAPES AND SIZES  
 DESIGNS AND COLOURS. THE MOULDS MAKE  
 THE SHAPES. OVER ONE MILLION CANDLES  
 ARE SOLD EACH YEAR. THE CANDLES ARE   
 SOLD TO SHOPS HERE AND IN HOLLAND AND 
 ICELAND AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THERE IS 
 A CANDLE SHOP NEXT TO THE FACTORY. IT 
 IS NEW.                               
 THE TALLOW WORKS IS NEXT DOOR. IT USED
 TO BE A SAW-MILL. TALLOW IS OLD OIL   
 AND FAT USED FOR LIPSTICK, HAIRSPRAY, 
 SOAP POWDER AND ANIMAL FOOD.
