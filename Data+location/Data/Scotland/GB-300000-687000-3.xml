		<title>03PLAYGROUND GAMES IN OAKLEY</title>
		<content> At Inzievar primary we did a survey of
 playground games.Football was the most
 popular boy's game and then toy       
 fighting.The girls like{Clockworks}   
 best.In this game one person spins    
 everybody round then lets go.They each
 form a shape.She tells them what they 
 look like and they must act like it.  
 She says Clockworks sleep everybody   
 flops down and shuts their eyes.She   
 dances round and taps people who then 
 follow her.After tapping them all bar 
 one they all shake this one saying    
 wakey,wakey,sleepy head,don't forget  
 to make your bed.This person is now   
 up.Racing and tig were the most popu- 
 lar mixed games.Younger pupils played 
 imaginary games such as Cops and      
 Robbers or T.V.cartoon adventures.    
 Games such as{badminton and netball}  
 are practised.In the summer time they 
 practise for the school sports.       </content>
