		<title>05HURLFORD/CROOKEDHOLM HOUSING</title>
		<content> Councillor Nesbit was interviewed     
 about the housing in Hurlford and     
 Crookedholm. The first houses in      
 Crookedholm were built in the 1930's  
 by the authority who built 64 council 
 houses. Another 78 were built between 
 1946-1959. Some more were built round 
 1980. Crookedholm was built before    
 Hurlford. The population of Hurlford  
 is 5000, much more than Crookedholm's 
 1180. The architect who built the     
 houses was Clark Fyffe. In the olden  
 days there were houses like dens.     
 About ten peole slept in the same     
 room. Some people even slept in the   
 kitchen. Now there are 1350 council   
 houses in Hurlford not including all  
 the private houses. Seright Square,   
 one of the biggest streets in         
 Crookedholm, was built in 1930.
