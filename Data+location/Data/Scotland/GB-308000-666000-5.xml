		<title>05A71 By-Pass  East Calder</title>
		<content>  The A71 By-pass was built in 1979    
 and opened in 1980 to decrease the    
 traffic travelling through East Calder
 Main Street and Mid Calder.It helps   
 people  travelling from Livingston and
 the West of Scotland to Edinburgh.    
  The By-pass was built through Oakbank
 Shale Bing and over the R.Linhouse.It 
 cut through several farms which caused
 some problems: cattle had to go under 
 the road through a cattle creek;new   
 field drains had to be built;passing  
 drivers threw litter;land was lost.   
  To-day part of a field is still wet; 
 fences need to be repaired in case    
 cattle get on to the road;crossing the
 road with tractors and trailers is    
 difficult.                            
  Traffic in Main St has decreased but 
 Langton Rd. is busier.Local trade has 
 not been affected because more houses 
 have been built in East Calder.       </content>
