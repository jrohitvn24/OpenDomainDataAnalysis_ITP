		<content>{GARTLY}(pronounced commonly locally as
 "Gairtly") appears first as Grantully.
 The name possibly comes from Gaelic - 
 Gareun-tully meaning "birds' field    
 among the knoll",or from Gort-tully - 
 "The field of the knoll (The spelling 
 "Gortuly" also appears), or "Garadh   
 antulaich"-The enclosure on the       
 knoll". In any event there ARE many   
 knolls in the Gartly area.            
 NJ534336{DOVECOTE.}This is a rare and 
 old example of a conical bee-hive     
 type. It was built beside an ancient  
 castle{THE PLACE OF GARTLY}of which   
 now remains little more than a grassy 
 mound over some stones. The Place of  
 Gartly figured often during the reign 
 of Mary Queen of Scots, as she stayed 
 there at least twice. The last date   
 recorded is 1682,and some time after  
 it was burnt down reputedly by a      
 wronged husband returning from battle.</content>
