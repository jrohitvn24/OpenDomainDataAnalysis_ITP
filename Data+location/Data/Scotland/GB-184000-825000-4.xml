		<title>04FORESTRY IN LOCHALSH</title>
		<content> People visit the forest as they like  
 to get away from motor cars and have  
 some peace.But they do not just like  
 to see conifers.They like to see broad
 leaved trees.The Forestry Commission  
 is planting a lot more broad leaved   
 trees now than it previously did.This 
 is to encourage people to visit and   
 increase the conservation value.Broad 
 leaved trees bring more wildlife and  
 people like to see them.People like to
 walk in the forest but they need to   
 have identified walks.There are no    
 such walks in Ratagan except at       
 Dorusduain.There is a need for marked 
 tracks and boards on which there would
 be information about the area.It would
 also be important to grow the trees   
 far bigger than at present as people  
 like to see big trees.
