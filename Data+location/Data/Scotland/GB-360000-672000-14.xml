		<content>{CHURCH AND RELIGION                   
 Religion used to have a much bigger   
 part in people's every day life in    
 small Scottish communities like ours. 
 Nowadays,although we still go to {    
{Church }sometimes ,it doesn't seem so 
 inportant now.We all go to {Church }at
 Christmas,Easter and times like that  
 and most of the children in the Parish
 go to Sunday school.                  
           In the past people used to  
 be afraid of the minister but our     
 local minister is nice and everybody  
 likes him.He goes to three {Churches} 
  and two schools.The {Churches}are    
 Stenton,Whittingehame and EastLinton. 
 He goes to East Linton every week but 
 takes it week about  with Stenton and 
 Whittingehame.He wouldn't move to     
 another Parish because he likes this  
 one.He thinks the people are friendly.
 Not nosey,just interested.            </content>
