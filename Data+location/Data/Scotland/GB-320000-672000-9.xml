		<title>09CRAIGCROOK CASTLE,EDINBURGH.</title>
		<content> There it stood looking very evil      
 indeed,staring nastily,at all around  
 with a grimace on its ugly black      
 face.It seemed to be turning towards  
 you in the twilight,its old wrinkled  
 stone face definitely seemed to be    
 meaning no good at all.In fact, he    
 looked absolutely terrifying.A tall,  
 cloaked statue patrolled the grounds  
 assisted by a doberman pincher.As I   
 was staring motionless through the    
 foggy,misty air I thought I saw a     
 couple of white faces lurking behind  
 the statue, as if the three were      
 having a conversation.I ran.....fast. 
    The castle today is really quite a 
 pleasant building.Although it was     
 originally built as a{'keep' in 1545  
 to be used for{defence of Edinburgh}in
 time of{siege}it has now been         
 modernised and turned into offices.
