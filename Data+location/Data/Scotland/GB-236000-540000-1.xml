		<content> This area contains many ancient sites 
 which are maintained as property of   
 the Department of the Environment.    
 There is a stone circle, cup and ring 
 marked stones, a cross and many earth 
 works and camps with standing stones. 
 The meaning of these early artifacts  
 is little understood at present.  The 
 dominering aspect of this area is the 
 Fell of Barhullion, which was         
 obviously a prehistoric defence       
 position, containing both fresh water 
 loch and earthworks.  Also on the site
 is a Triangulation point which is a   
 white stone triangle with holes to    
 facilitate a theodolite for measureing
 distances and angle accurately also   
 height measurements.  Below the fell, 
 most of the land is boggy and the     
 remaining land slightly wooded from   
 olden deciduous woods which probably  
 originally covered much of the area.  </content>
