  The school was subscribed to by      
every working person in Scotland. It   
was opened by King Edward 7th in 1908  
as a memorial to Queen Victoria and to 
the Scottish soldiers and sailors who  
died in the South African War. It was  
also visited by Queen Elizabeth 2nd on 
its 50th anniversary.                  
  The school is for boys from nine-and 
a-half to eighteen who are sons of     
serving or former Scottish servicemen  
and women of the Regular forces. The   
parent must be either Scottish born or 
serve in a Scottish regiment and,if an 
officer ,must have served at least four
years in the ranks.
