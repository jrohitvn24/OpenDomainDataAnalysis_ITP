		<title>12PORT OF MENTEITH FARMING</title>
		<content> Farming is restricted to the          
 northern,eastern and south eastern    
 shores of the Lake.                   
  On the northern shore it is a narrow 
 strip,about two fields wide which     
 slopes quickly on to hill grazing.    
  At the eastern end the land is       
 flatter and better for farming. Here  
 grass,both for feeding cattle,in the  
 form of silage or hay and as a cash   
 crop is grown. Also some barley and   
 oats.                                 
  At the south eastern corner there is 
 a little more emphasis on crop        
 growing,barley,winter wheat,maize and 
 of course grass for silage and hay.   
  The animals bred are sheep and beef  
 cattle.                               
  Silage is made by mixing grass and   
 treacle and storing in a covered pit  
 for 5_6 months before use.
