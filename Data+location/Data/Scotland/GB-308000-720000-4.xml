		<title>04Council House Renovations.</title>
		<content>  In the{Craigie}area of south-west    
 Perth many{council houses}are being   
{modernised}to make them more comfort- 
 able for the residents. It takes seven
 to ten weeks to complete each house   
 and in the meantime the occupants live
 free in{luxury caravans}for up to     
 eight people, but that is really a bit
 cramped. Larger families are temporar-
 ily decanted to houses which have     
 already been modernised. Our houses   
 are having new roofs, windows and     
 doors. The kitchens are being enlarged
 by knocking down a wall, and new units
 put into kitchens and bathrooms.      
{Central heating}(choice of gas, solid-
 fuel or electricity) is being install-
 ed and the whole house redecorated.   
 Houses near the{quarry}are having     
{double-glazing}to keep out the sound  
 of blasting.{Everyone is absolutely   
{delighted with the final results.     </content>
