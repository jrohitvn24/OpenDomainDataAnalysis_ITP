		<title>12Peat cutting</title>
		<content> Peats are cut during May and June.    
 Peat cutting rights accompany the rent
 or ownership of the older houses and  
 crofts.There are two ways of cutting  
 peats:traditional and modern.         
 The first stage of the older method is
 to line the bank.Then the turf is     
 removed with a flachter or a converted
 horse plough pulled by a tractor.This 
 is known locally as 'turring the bank'
 In a squad of 4 the peats are cut with
 a tusker-1 cuts,1 lifts the peat out,2
 spread them to dry.In a dry year they 
 are ready for'setting up'on edge in a 
 herring bone pattern at 10-14 days.   
 The newer method uses a J.C.B.equipped
 with 2 buckets.The ditching bucket    
 removes the turf.The second bucket    
 specially made for peat cutting cuts  
 12 peats at a time'a case of peats'The
 peats are then spread as before.When  
 dry they are built in a stack at home.</content>
