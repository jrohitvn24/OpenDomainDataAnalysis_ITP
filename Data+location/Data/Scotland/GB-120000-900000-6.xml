		<title>06Rhenigidale Postman</title>
		<content> There is no Post Office nor any shops 
 in Rhenigidale.There is a Post Box    
 near the school on the main path into 
 the village. It is a small red post   
 box hanging on a wall. The postman is 
 my uncle Mr Kenneth Mackay. He has to 
 walk to Tarbert and back on Tuesdays ,
 Thursdays and Saturdays to get the    
 mail. He has to carry all the mail and
 any daily newspapers or magazines in  
 his post bag. If there are any urgent 
 supplies needed then he will carry    
 them also. The walk from Rhenigidale  
 to Tarbert takes the postman about 2  
 hours. If the weather is icy, snowy or
 very wet it will take longer. Perhaps 
 once or twice a year he may have to   
 put his journey off until the         
 following day due to adverse weather  
 conditions like a blizzard or gales,  
 as the path is quite exposed.
