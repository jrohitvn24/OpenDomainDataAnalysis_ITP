		<title>16         FARMING</title>
		<content> Farming in this area is important     
 because of the fertile soil.Hay,      
 turnips and pulses for silage are all 
 winter crops for feeding cattle.The   
 farmers can have a little hay and     
 turnip and pulses for silage,or they  
 have a lot of the one crop.Because of 
 the rich soil and the climate of this 
 area we grow soft fruit such as       
 Strawberries and Rasberries for jam   
 and canning or for dye.Farmers would  
 have some cattle.They might have some 
 sheep up in the high areas where the  
 grass isn't very rich.They might have 
 a few pigs for fattening and some     
 chickens for eggs.There was a private 
 nursery in the area again showing how 
 ideal the soil is for growing young   
 plants.
