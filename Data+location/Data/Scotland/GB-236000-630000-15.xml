		<content> The Rev.A.S.Sutherland has been the   
 Minister of Symington Norman Church   
 for sixteen years. A service is held  
 every Sunday from 10.30am to          
 11.30am.About 100 people come to      
 church on a Sunday morning.The church 
 is much the same as it was in olden   
 times .As you go in the Church  if you
 look at the ceiling you will see that 
 there are oak beams showing.On either 
 side of you are pews with green       
 cushions on them.If you walk right    
 down you will come to three steps and 
 on your right hand side is a pulpit.If
 you look up and to your left you will 
 see the balcony where the organ plays 
 but there are pews there as           
 well.Symington Church is a popular    
 place for weddings.In the last year   
 there have been many christenings and 
 thankfully few funerals.There are a   
 total of 10 stained glass windows.    </content>
