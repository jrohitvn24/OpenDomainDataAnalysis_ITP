		<title>20  LORISTON COUNTRY PARK? 2</title>
		<content> to this eyesore ther is the other     
 aesthetic problem of wind blown debris
 since the tip is on an exposed hill.  
 The area also suffers from white acid 
 run-off water leaching from the tip.  
 The Countryside Commission for        
 Scotland don't presently list it as an
 "officially recognised" County Park   
 since it does not match up to their   
 criteria.                             
 The Leisure and Recreation Department 
 who pride themselves on their amenity 
 provision would seem to be undeterred.
 They have produced a booklet entitled 
 "Loriston Country Park" encouraging   
 visitors to its sea, hills and cliffs 
 but fails to mention the presence of  
 the tip! Ironically if the tip is to  
 removed in future years naturalists   
 feel that the inevitable neat,grassed 
 reclaimed site will be a far less     
 valuable habitat for wildlife.        </content>
