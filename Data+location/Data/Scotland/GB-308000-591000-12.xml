		<content>    Johnstonebridge Church lies down   
 beside the River Annan quite a        
 distance from the houses that make up 
 Johnstonebridge. It can be seen quite 
 clearly from the A74 Dual             
 Carriageway.                          
    The minister died in 1984 and so   
 far no new minister has been          
 appointed. The charge is shared at the
 present between two temporary         
 ministers. There are six people in the
 church choir.The doctor plays the     
 organ and trains the choir.           
    The children go to church but after
 the first two hymns they leave the    
 service and go upstairs to Sunday     
 School.There are two teachers and     
 about eighteen children in Sunday     
 School.
