		<title>12AROUND LITTLEMILL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> One house next door to the school is  
 now privately owned, but was          
 originally built for a Mr.Crocket who 
 was the Littlemill Pit manager. The   
 house was,therefore,the property of   
 the Coal Board and it was only in the 
 last ten years that it was released   
 for private sale.                     
 The schoolmaster stayed in the school 
 house at the other side of the school.
 The local nurse also lived in a part  
 of this house so that she could be    
 easily contacted.                     
 The house still belongs to the        
 Education Department and is now       
 inhabited by the retired headteacher  
 of Coylton Primary School.
