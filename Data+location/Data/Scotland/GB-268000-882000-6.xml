{Whisky Distillery}called{Balblair.}It 
 was built in 1749.It now employs 16   
 people,8 of which are from Edderton.2 
 of the 16 are ladies.Half of the      
 employees are shift workers and the   
 other half are day workers. The       
 Distillery is open all year round 24  
 hours a day, 7 days a week producing  
 one and a half million litres of      
 whisky a year.From start to finish the
 process takes 3 days.Then the whisky  
 matures in oak barrels for 3 years but
 if you require malt whisky it takes 8 
 years.The whisky is transported south 
 by lorry where most of it is blended  
 with other whiskies but the 8 year old
 malt is bottled and sold as{Balblair. 
{The Craigroy River}supplies the water 
 required by the{Distillery.}It is now 
 quite a tourist attraction with 500   
 visitors annually.                    </content>
