		<title>09A PUPIL'S DAY IN CUMNOCK</title>
		<content>   The worst thing in a pupil's life is
 getting up in the morning. Even in    
 winter it is freezing cold because    
 girls have to wear skirts and some    
 people do not get a free bus pass in  
 the  winter and the school is         
 sometimes cold.   When I get to       
 school, I have to report to my tutor  
 and if you come in late you have to go
 to your tutor then the school office  
 to register.  On a Monday I get two   
 periods of art together. It is good   
 but the periods go in very slowly.    
 Biology is good but involves too much 
 writing.  English is sometimes all    
 right but essay writing and copying   
 from the blackboard is boring. History
 is good and usually interesting.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
