		<title>18'SPARE TIME' AROUND HOWNAM</title>
		<content> Most of the people living  round the  
 village of Hownam in the Scottish     
 Borders,when asked what they did in   
 their spare time,answered,"What spare 
 time?" There are no'Gentleman Farmers'
 here,and no nine to five jobs, and so 
 called 'Spare Time'is as likely to be 
 used exercising a pup, or nursing an  
 ailing animal,as doing anything solely
 for pleasure.However,everyone does    
 spend some time watching television,  
 and almost all listen to the radio or 
 to records.Reading is a very popular  
 passtime,and the area has the service 
 of a good mobile library,once every 2 
 weeks.Most ladies find some time for  
 knitting, and about half of them do   
 sewing,crochet work or embroidery too 
 The majority of the population spend  
 some time gardening,producing fine    
 arrays of flowers,but good vegetables 
 too to supplement the winter larder.  </content>
