		<title>09Torridon camp site</title>
		<content> The{camp site}which is near the Youth 
 Hostel in Torridon,is open all year   
 round.It is staffed from April to the 
 end of September.30to 40 tents are the
 most that have camped so far, though  
 it can hold more.{Charges are 50p per 
{tent per night;}it does not matter how
 many peole nor how big the tent is.The
 site is run by{The District Council}It
 is used mostly by young people,hikers 
 and climbers.Many are foreigners Dutch
 mostly.Sometimes the same group return
 every year,staying longer every time, 
 sometimes up to two weeks. There are  
 very few cyclists,due to distance,and 
 having to carry equipment;most come by
 car or van,parking in the adjacent car
 park.There is a toilet block with hot 
 water and showers.Obviously,good dry  
 weather brings more campers, but even 
 in winter enthusiasts camp in the area
 in tents, vans and caravans.          </content>
