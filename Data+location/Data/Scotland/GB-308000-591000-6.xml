		<content>    We live at Johnstonebridge, near   
 the school. My mum and dad are        
 artists. My mum prefers to paint      
 landscapes, and my dad lectures at the
 Technical College in Dumfries. He     
 prefers to paint still life and       
 portraits. My mum has exhibited in    
 Paris, Edinburgh, Carlisle and        
 Dumfries. My dad does not exhibit his 
 work very much but sometimes he puts  
 some paintings or drawings in along   
 with my mum.                          
    We keep a goat and two geese. We   
 have two dogs, three cats, three      
 kittens and a lamb.We usually buy a   
 pig or two, and when they are heavy   
 enough, we take them to Smiths, the   
 butchers in Lockerbie.                
    In the summer my dad holds a       
 painting class at a hotel in Beattock 
 and I pose for him.
