		<title>17ANIMALS IN THE DORNIE AREA.</title>
		<content> There are very many wild animals round
 the school.In the area of Dornie      
 animals which are rare elsewhere are  
 quite common.On the hills can be found
 red and roe deer,foxes,pine martins,  
 wild cats and badgers.On the shore are
 otters and in the loch are seals.The  
 most interesting birds of prey are    
 golden eagles,buzzards,kestrels and   
 sparrow hawks.Ravens are quite common 
 and there are many herons on the      
 rivers and lochs.The most important   
 animal is possibly the golden eagle   
 which is attracting much publicity    
 because it is taking lambs in the     
 Glenelg area.Mr Grant believes this   
 is because there is a very great      
 number of eagles and they have        
 destroyed all their natural food such 
 as hares, rabbits and ptarmagan.
