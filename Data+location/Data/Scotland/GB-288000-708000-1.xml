		<content> Local tradition asserts that the name 
 Blackford derives from the drowning of
 Queen Helen at a ford near the Milton 
 of Panholes in the 9th century. While 
 traces of human settlement and        
 activity are apparent from early      
 times, the village of Blackford itself
 dates from the second half of the 17th
 century. Little physical evidence of  
 the early village survives but some   
 house sites date back to the burning  
 of Blackford by the Jacobyte army in  
 1716. In the original parish church   
 yard, one of Scotlands only two Lych  
 Gates can be seen. The local Blackford
 church has a link in an important     
 event in Scottish history. The        
 minister of Blackford the Reverend    
 John Clark, put  forward the famous   
 motion to the Auchterarder Presbytery 
 which led to the Disruption of 1843
