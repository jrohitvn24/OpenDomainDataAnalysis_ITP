		<title>07ELPHINSTONE SHOPS AND BUSES</title>
		<content> THERE ARE TWO SHOPS IN THE            
 VILLAGE.THEY SELL EVERYTHING FROM     
 SWEETS TO WASHING UP LIQUID.WHEN      
 GORDON WAS INTERVIEWED HE SAID THAT HE
 OPENED AT 7.30AM. UNTIL 1.30 THEN     
 FROM 2.30 'TIL 6.30PM.HIS SHOP IS ALSO
 THE LOCAL POST OFFICE. HE GOES TO A   
 LOCAL CASH AND CARRY CALLED McNABS FOR
 HIS SUPPLIES. THE OTHER SHOP          
 "JESSIES" OPENED AT 6.30 TILL 1.00    
 THEN FROM 3.00PM. TILL 6.00PM.IT SELLS
 PAPERS, FROM THE DAILY RECORD TO THE  
 EVENING NEWS.                         
                                       
    THE LOCAL BUS SERVICE IS THE       
 EASTERN SCOTTISH WHICH PASSES THROUGH 
 ELPHINSTONE EVERY TWO HOURS. THIS     
 MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE       
 VILLAGERS TO TRAVEL LOCALLY AS THE    
 NEAREST TOWN, TRANENT, IS ONLY TWO    
 MILES DISTANT.                        
                                       </content>
