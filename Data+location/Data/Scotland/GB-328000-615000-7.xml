		<title>07FARMING - ETTRICK VALLEY.</title>
		<content>  Farm Work  -  Farming is the main    
 source of employment and the work is  
 shepherding,  working with cattle, and
 some tractor work.  The busiest times 
 are lambing in April and May, clipping
 in July, haymaking when the weather   
 permits and the Autumn sales.  Snow in
 Winter makes feeding livestock on the 
 hills very difficult and can be the   
 busiest time of all.                  
  Farm Crops - No cereals are grown and
 the fields are used for hay and       
 silage. Silage is cut grass which is  
 either put into a pit or put into big 
 plastic bags and sealed.  It is used  
 for Winter feeding.
