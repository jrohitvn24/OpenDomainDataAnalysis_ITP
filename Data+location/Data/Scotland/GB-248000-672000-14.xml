    The Co-op has been praised for     
 painting over the graffiti on the     
 front of it's Faifley shops.          
    Now just a fortnight later the     
 vandals have been at work again and   
 though not serious graffiti has       
 started to appear again.              
    In January District Councillor     
 Betty Brown had hit out at the state  
 of the shop frontage.She claimed that 
 other shops in the area had managed to
 keep their buildings clean and only   
 the Co-op had not.                    
    Last month the Faifley councillor  
 told the Environmental Committee      
 meeting that she was pleased to see   
 the Co-op had been repainted.         
    Now the graffiti seems to be creep-
 ing back again leaving the management 
 with another costly painting bill     
 looming in the near future.           </content>
