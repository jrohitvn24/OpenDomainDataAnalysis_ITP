		<title>19A Night Out in Strathmiglo</title>
		<content> The Strathmiglo Inn is being restored 
 in the hope of capturing even more    
 than at present,the images of the 18th
 century. The restoration will also    
 include an enlargement of the         
 premises.Many local people do not use 
 the Inn.They find it expensive both   
 for eating and drinking. Both The     
 Royal Hotel and The Tavern are popular
 with locals.The Tavern,once The       
 Railway Tavern because of its         
 proximity to what until the 1960's was
 Strathmiglo Station,has just opened a 
 new restaurant which has been named   
 the Signal Box, for obvious reasons.  
 Opposite The Royal Hotel at the east  
 end of the High Street is a house with
 an arched pend above which it says    
 IM IB 16.It is said this building was 
 once a stable and travellers changing 
 horses may have rested in the Royal   
 Hotel.                                </content>
