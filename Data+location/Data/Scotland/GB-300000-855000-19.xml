		<title>19DAD'S ARMY West Forres</title>
		<content> During the Second World War a special 
 unit of the Home Guard made use of an 
 underground bunker near Forres        
 Airfield.This unit was sent on        
 exercises and some of the results were
 straight from 'Dad's Army'.One mission
 was aimed at capturing Forres Airfield
 and involved crossing the River       
 Findhorn.A raft was constructed but   
 the tow rope broke and unfortunately  
 the crew drifted helplessly down the  
 river.Another sortie was a surprise   
 night raid on a nearby castle but this
 turned into a surprisingly noisy      
 retreat when a bee hive was           
 overturned.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
