		<content> I usually get up at about quarter to  
 eight in the morning and get my       
 breakfast at eight o'clock.  I leave  
 the house at quarter past eight and   
 have a game of football before we get 
 in.  My school day on a Friday morning
 consists of reading, maths, basketball
 and language.  Friday afternoon       
 consists of art and drama.  We finish 
 at quarter past three.  When I get up 
 the road I get changed and go to      
 football training down at the centre. 
 I get back from that at about six     
 o'clock.  I watch the television most 
 of the night or I play darts and then 
 I go to bed at about twelve o'clock,  
 because it's Saturday the next day.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
