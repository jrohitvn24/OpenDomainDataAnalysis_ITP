		<title>16The Registrar</title>
		<content> The registrar was born in Gretna.She  
 became registrar in 1955 when the     
 population was about half of that     
 today.There have been a lot of runaway
 marriages with the boom time being    
 during the 1960's.The runaways have   
 come from all over{Europe},and as     
 faraway as{America }and{Russia.}One of
 the strangest requests came from a    
 gentleman who wished to marry his     
 plant.This gentleman was redirected to
 the{Blacksmiths Shop}at{Springfield,} 
 the original marriage centre,where he 
 married his intended in a mock        
 ceremony over the anvil.              
      In a week{Pat}performs about 35  
 marriages.Indeed in the first half of 
 1985 500 weddings had taken place.
