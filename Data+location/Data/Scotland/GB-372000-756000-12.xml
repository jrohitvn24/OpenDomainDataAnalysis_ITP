		<content>    Most of the houses in our block are
 council houses and have been built in 
 the 20th century.                     
    They are mainly 2 storied, brick   
 built houses, semi-detached with their
 own garden.                           
    There are some privately built     
 houses but these are usually older and
 it is unlikely that there will be many
 more of these built as the ground is  
 "Commonty" and no more bulding will   
 be allowed. Council houses are mainly 
 rented but the present Conservative   
 goverment has allowed the tenants to  
 buy them in recent years.
