		<title>01THE REAY AREA</title>
		<content> The block is mainly rural with a      
 height range of 117 metres, the       
 highest point being Creag Leathan in  
 the southern third of the block with a
 height of 127m.This area is open      
 moorland because of its exposure to   
 the elements due to its height. As the
 height of the land drops towards its  
 lowest point of 10m on the coast this 
 type of scenery gives way to stock    
 rearing and cereal farming.           
   The village of Reay is concentrated 
 in the north-west of the square and   
 hence this is where most of the       
 amenities are found.                  
   An old-folk's home is situated in   
 the centre of the block among one of  
 the few patches of woodland found in  
 the area.
