		<title>19Farming Poem The Tractor</title>

 He started the tractor,its engine was 
 creaking,                             
 The wheels moved with a terrible      
 squeaking,                            
 It shot out the farmyard with         
 incredible speed,                     
 And as for the animals they took no   
 heed.                                 
 The front of the bonnet was covered in
 oil,                                  
 The engine was certainly having to    
 toil.                                 
 Suddenly his field came into sight,   
 So he turned the wheel with the       
 fiercest of might,                    
 He lowered the plough to the ground,  
 It started to make a churning sound.  
 Soon the field was completely         
 finished,                             
 But the fuel in his tank had          
 certainly diminished.                 </content>
