		<title>01Slopes South of Maxton</title>
		<content> This is a sparsely populated area to  
 the south of the hamlet of Maxton. It 
 contains only a few scattered         
 settlements although bisected by a    
 trunk round the A68. The area is on   
 ground rising gently to the south of  
 the river Tweed, and the landscape is 
 dominated by the view some 4 miles to 
 the Norht of the the triple peaks of  
 the Eildon Hills. In places the       
 distant Cheviat Hills can also be seen
 some 15 miles to the south.The main   
 land use is agricultural and the      
 majority of the population in this aea
 are employed in this sector. however, 
 some may work in nearby villages or   
 small towns, the community of Newtown 
 St Boswells (3 miles) in particular   
 houses the local council office.
