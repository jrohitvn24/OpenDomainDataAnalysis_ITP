		<title>10THE VILLAGE - Main Street</title>
		<content> sharp left and seawards, in a street  
 called The Wynd, stand the walls of   
 what are known as The Maltings, this  
 being a large warehouse for the       
 storage of grain which was exported   
 from Kilspindie in the old days, from 
 farms in this richly fertile area. The
 hoist used for lifting the grain sacks
 can still be seen.                    
 Almost opposite The Maltings is the   
 village community hall.  It is still  
 in fairly regular use - various local 
 organisations e.g. badminton club,    
 youth club etc meet there - but the   
 hall itself is in a fairly delapidated
 state even though a great deal of     
 community  effort is utilised to      
 maintain it.  A number of old houses  
 surround the sea green which causes   
 the road to take a sharp turn to the  
 right before heading on its way to    
 Gullane.                              </content>
