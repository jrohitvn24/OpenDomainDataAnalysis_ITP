		<content> The River Don runs from west to east  
 through the centre of the area which  
 includes parts of the three parishes  
 of Tullynessle &amp; Forbes, Keig and     
 Alford. The villages of Alford and    
 Montgarrie serve mainly the           
 surrounding farming community though  
 in recent years there has been an     
 emphasis on developing tourism to     
 provide  more jobs locally. A popular 
 attraction is Haughton House Country  
 Park which has a caravan and camp site
 with picnic and play areas and        
 woodland walks for day visitors.      
 Winters are severe and the growing    
 season short. The soil is generally   
 fertile and the land mainly arable    
 farmland. One tenth of the area is    
 woodland, mainly birch.
