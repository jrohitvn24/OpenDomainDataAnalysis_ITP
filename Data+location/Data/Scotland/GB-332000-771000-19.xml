		<content>{HOW I SPENT SATURDAY 8th JUNE 1985.   
                                       
   I awoke at 9:10am. For breakfast I  
 had Coco Pops and a cup of tea. After 
 that I watched Godzilla, who is a     
 Prehistoric Dinosaur, on T.V. At      
 10:00am I fed Dad's cattle and helped 
 him put up an electric fence.         
  In the afternoon Mum took us to the  
 fair at Kirriemuir. We went on a      
 roundabout and the Waltzers. Then we  
 visited the Spin &amp; Skidd.That was     
 great! Afterwards I had a candyfloss  
 and pie and potatoes for tea.         
  At 9:30pm my family went for a car   
 run round Glen Clova. We then went to 
 Kirriemuir for fish and chips. I went 
 to bed at 24:00.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
