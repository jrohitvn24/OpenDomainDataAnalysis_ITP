		<title>10Dairy Farming</title>
		<content> There are 3 Dairy Farms in this block 
 and only 14 altogether in Caithness.  
 The cows are Ayrshire or Friesian x   
 Ayrshire and replacements are home-   
 bred.They are milked twice per day.   
 Two of the farms have parlours and the
 other has round the byre milking.The  
 milk goes straight to the bulk tank   
 and is collected daily by bulk tanker 
 and taken to the N.of S.M.M.Board     
 creamery at Wick.                     
 The cows are outside from June-Sept.  
 and fed concentrates while being      
 milked.The rest of the year they get a
 selection of barley,bale silage,hay,  
 beet pulp,minerals and concentrates.  
 The farms are family concerns with one
 farm employing a full-time dairyman   
 and all of them using casual labour.  
 Recently the farms have been subject  
 to milk quotas.
