		<content>{MILNES HIGH SCHOOL}was founded in{1845
{Alexander Milne}a local boy who worked
 at Gordon Castle left on being ordered
 to cut his hair.He emigrated to {New  
{Orleans}in America where he died      
 leaving $100 000 to build a school in 
 Fochabers. The school was called      
{Milnes Free School}later to be known  
 as{Milnes Institution.                
   In{1982}the first phase of a five   
 phase programme to build a modern     
 school was completed.Due to the       
 economic pressures on public spending 
 the construction has extended over a  
 number of years.It is hoped to        
 complete the whole project by 1988.   
   Milnes serves the surrounding areas 
 pupils being bussed from{Lhanbryde,   
{Garmouth,Orton,Spey Bay}and{Braes of  
{Enzie.         }                      
   The school day runs from 08:50 until
 15:50.                                </content>
