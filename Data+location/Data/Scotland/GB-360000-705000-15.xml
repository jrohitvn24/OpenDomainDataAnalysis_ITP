		<content> ARTS AND CRAFTS IN CRAIL.             
 It is fortunate that some of the old  
 crafts still survive in Crail, e.g.   
 the local blacksmith and the cabinet  
 makers.                               
 In 1965 a Pottery was set up in a     
 derelict building, restored to        
 incorporate a large studio above the  
 workshop and wood-fired kiln, making  
 stoneware, earthenware and porcelain. 
 The clay is hand-thrown and the glaze 
 is locally made. It is a family       
 business employing up to 5 people.    
 The Little Gallery has decorated      
 furniture,flower paintings and        
 hand-made bronzes. A new resident in  
 Crail paints flower studies in water  
 colours and oils, which are printed on
 articles sold by the National Trust &amp; 
 others.  His wife is a professional   
 china restorer and remodeller of      
 antique pieces.                       </content>
