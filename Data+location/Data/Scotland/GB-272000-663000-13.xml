 In the late 19th century Coatbridge   
 became known as the "Iron Burgh"      
 because of the large number of iron   
 works and related industries. Since   
 then heavy industries have rapidly    
 declined and practically              
 disappeared.The unemployment rate is  
 one of the highest in the U.K. To help
 the unemployed Strathclyde Regonal    
 Council aided by the European Social  
 Fund have set up an employment grants 
 scheme.The aim is to encourage        
 businesses to employ more people aged 
 between 18 and 24. In  Whifflet       
 primary school there is an office of  
 the Y.T.S. which is the Youth Training
 Scheme which is also trying to help   
 the young unemployed.
