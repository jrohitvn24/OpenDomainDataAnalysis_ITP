		<content> A few children from Juniper Green     
 conducted a survey of the games we    
 play in 1985.  The ten most popular   
 are football, rugby, badminton,       
 basketball, volleyball, hockey,       
 ice-skting, swimming, tennis and      
 ski-ing. All of these games are played
 by boys and girls except football and 
 rugby which are played by boys        
 only.Basketball is a game played by   
 two teams of various numbers.  It is  
 played in a hall and at either side of
 the hall is a basket just over two    
 metres from the ground. The aim of the
 game is for each team to throw the    
 ball into the opposing team's basket  
 as many times as they can.Volleyball  
 is played with two teams and a light  
 ball which you keep going across the  
 net with your hands.
