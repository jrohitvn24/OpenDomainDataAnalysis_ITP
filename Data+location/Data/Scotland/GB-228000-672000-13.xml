		<title>13HOUSING IN PORT GLASGOW</title>
		<content> Most houses in Port Glasgow are owned 
 either by the District Council or by  
 the Scottish Special Housing          
 Association. There are some privately 
 owned houses in the Lilybank area in  
 the extreme west of the town and also 
 some privately rented tenement flats  
 in central Port Glasgow. This central 
 area has a fairly high proportion of  
 elderly people whose families have    
 moved "up the hill" or left the       
 district. Families on the Council     
 housing list also show a distinct     
 preference for housing in the town    
 centre. To meet the needs of the      
 elderly the District Council has built
{sheltered housing}. There is also a   
 policy of granting tenancies in       
 certain multi storey blocks only to   
 the elderly, the physically           
 handicapped and to families with older
 children.                             </content>
