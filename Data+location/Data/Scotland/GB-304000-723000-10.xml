		<content> There is quite extensive woodland in  
 the area, both deciduous and evergreen
 trees grow but these are all planted  
 woodland, not older than two hundred  
 and fifty years and there is nothing  
 remaining of the ancient Caledonian   
 forest which once covered this area.  
 The fields are divided by fences and a
 few hedges, though these have mostly  
 been removed in order to give maximum 
 cultivation. The remaining hedges are 
 not more than one hundred and twenty  
 five years old.                       
 The soil is light and dries easily.   
 About forty years ago when the farm   
 came into the hands of the present    
 owners, there were at least ten men   
 employed for every three at the       
 present day.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
