    There would be obvious             
 disadvantages.People living there     
 would require a car. There are no bus 
 services and no shops The odd grocery 
 van passes but food can be            
 expensive.You would have to be        
 careful to buy the correct amount of  
 food because you couldn't just pop out
 to the shops.Winter would be a        
 problem.The roads get snowed up and   
 blocked and it could be very lonely.  
   It might be a better idea to move   
 there when you are older.
