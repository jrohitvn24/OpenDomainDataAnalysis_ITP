		<content>   Originally a Royal Borough, New     
 Galloway is a relatively small village
 in the beautifully picturesque        
 Glenkens area. It consists of closely 
 knit, colour washed houses astride the
 main street. There are 2 small housing
 estates and about 30 detached         
 dwellings on the outskirts of the     
 village. A small group of houses      
 extend along the line of the old      
 Edinburgh Road which used to run      
 through the settlement. The meeting of
 the 2 roads, old and new, is marked by
 the imposing Town Hall which forms one
 of the corners of the junction. The   
 street pattern and the Scottish       
 vernacular architecture of the village
 makes it worthy of conservation.There 
 is a Church, School and basic shopping
 facilities. Due mainly to an influx of
 English people, the population has    
 increased to, approximately, 370.     </content>
