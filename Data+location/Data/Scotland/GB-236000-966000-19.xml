		<content>   Because of its isolation, public    
 transport in Durness is very limited. 
 There is a daily bus service to Lairg 
 via Kinlochbervie departing at        
 8.45 a.m. and returning about 5.00p.m.
 This bus carries the mail as well as  
 passengers. Very few people use the   
 service and it is heavily subsidised  
 by Highland Regional Council.         
   Roads to Durness are single track   
 with passing places.  These roads are 
 very narrow and twisty, particularly  
 the road east round Loch Eriboll. The 
 A838 from Tongue to Lairg via Durness 
 is the longest stretch of single track
 "A" class road left in Scotland.      
   Other services are a monthly WRVS   
  mini- bus  to Inverness for hospital 
 visiting and a Red Cross car for those
 who have no transport to and from     
 hospital. It is also possible to hire 
 a mini-bus locally for group outings. </content>
