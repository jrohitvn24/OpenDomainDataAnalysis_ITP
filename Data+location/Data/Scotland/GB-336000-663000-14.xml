 THERE ARE 360 HOUSES IN PATHHEAD      
 VILLAGE, SOME OF WHICH DATE BACK TO   
 THE 16th CENTURY. IN RECENT YEARS MANY
 NEW HOUSES HAVE BEEN BUILT ON THE WEST
 SIDE OF THE VILLAGE. THESE HOUSES ARE 
 COUNCUL OWNED AND MAKE UP MORE THAN   
 2/3 OF THE HOUSES IN THE VILLAGE. THE 
 OLDEST HOUSES ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE  
 MAIN STREET AND AS PATHHEAD IS IN A   
 CONSERVATION AREA MANY OF THE HOUSES  
 RETAIN THE ORIGINAL STONE WORK AND    
 FEATURES. THE AGES OF THE HOUSES CAN  
 BE BROKEN DOWN INTO 5 AGE GROUPS.
