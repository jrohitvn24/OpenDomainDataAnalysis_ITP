 The industries at Heathhall are varied
 in age as well as product e.g. the    
{Uniroyal}factory has been established 
 for 85 years, whereas the {Express    
{Bakery} is only 12 years old.  There  
 is also difference in the number of   
 employees.  The{Uniroyal,}which is the
 larger of the 2 factories has 881,    
 where the{Express Bakery}only has 35  
 employees.  About 90% of these        
 employees live in Dumfries.  The other
 10% have to travel a short distance to
 work.  Rubber products are made by{   
{Uniroyal}e.g. footwear, conveyor      
 belts, carpet underlay.  The bakery   
 makes a mouthwatering variety, e.g.   
 potato scones, baps and many different
 types of cakes, cream and otherwise.  
 Both factories get their raw materials
 by road haulage and by sea.
