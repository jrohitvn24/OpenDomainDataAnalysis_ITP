 The village shop provides many of the 
 basic essentials and some of the      
 luxuries for everyday living in       
 Carsphairn.It was built as a shop in  
 1885.At that time, farming supplies,  
 such as sheep dip and saddles were    
 also sold.                            
  Nowadays, the shop sells sweets,     
 cigarettes, ice cream, groceries,fruit
 and vegetables and newspapers.There   
 are about forty to fifty customers a  
 day. Many of them are from Carsphairn 
 village, although in the summer there 
 are also a lot of tourists _ some of  
 them foreigners.Most of the supplies  
 are from firms in Ayr, Dumfries and   
 Glasgow.
