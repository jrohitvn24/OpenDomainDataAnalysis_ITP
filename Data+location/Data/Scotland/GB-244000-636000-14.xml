		<content> At primary school you usually start at
 the age of five. When you progress    
 through the school from Primary 1-7   
 the work becomes harder. It is called 
 primary school because this is the    
 first school you go to. When you are  
 in Primary 4, 5, 6, and 7 you get     
 Geography and History. You can get    
 activities like P.E., Art, Sewing and 
 Singing. In most classes you would    
 expect to get a project of some kind. 
 There are school outings which go to  
 Millport, Culzean Castle and lots of  
 other places. Our hours at school are 
 from 9 o'clock in the morning till    
 quarter past 3 in the afternoon.      
 Pupils leave the primary at the age of
 11 or 12. In primary school the       
 teacher has a time-table. The         
 time-table tells you when you get P.E.
 and T.V. programmes.
