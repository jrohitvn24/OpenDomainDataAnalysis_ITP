		<title>03TRANSPORT IN EAGLESFIELD</title>
		<content>  Eaglesfield is situated close to the 
 A74{road}which traverses the          
 south-west end of the original main   
 street.At this point the railway line 
 is crossed by the dual-carriageway and
 where the disused station once        
 stood.There is still evidence of the  
 sidings and branch line which were    
 presumably used by the quarries which 
 once operated in the area.Although    
 there is now a flyover farm traffic   
 still has to use the A74 and this     
 causes problems as drivers coming     
 through from the motorways are not    
 always aware of this fact and there   
 have been a number of fatal accidents.
  To use the{railway}you have to go to 
 Lockerbie, Annan or Carlisle.         
{ Buses}run to Lockerbie, Annan or     
 Carlisle but are expensive and not    
 well used as most people have{cars.}
