		<title>19Vandalism in Cowdenbeath</title>
		<content> People in Cowdenbeath are becoming    
 worried about vandalism.There are some
 houses in Cowdenbeath getting         
 vandalised.These houses are in        
 Greenbank Drive,Hill Crest and        
 Mossbank.The houses are being boarded 
 up because they are to be knocked down
 in the future because of structural   
 failure.Young people are going into   
 these boarded up houses and doing     
 damage.Tenants still living there are 
 becoming worried that these intruders 
 might set fire to the houses which    
 might spread to theirs.One housewife  
 complained that one day when she and  
 her family returned from an outing all
 the windows at the back of the house  
 had been smashed.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
