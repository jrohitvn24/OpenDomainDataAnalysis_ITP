		<title>02LANDSCAPE TO THE EAST</title>
		<content>{Landscape}divides into  2 distinct    
 types:the area to the east,which is   
 the foothills of the Ochils and the   
 area to the west,a more populated open
 family area.                          
{Foothills of Ochils.}This appears to  
 be a windswept area of gently rolling 
 hills covered with heather;ideal for  
 grouse &amp; pheasant shooting which      
 starts in August.There are many minor 
 roads,with passing places,joining and 
 leading to small farms which estate   
 workers &amp; shepherds tenant.Sheep in   
 this area are the small hardy Scottish
 blackface.There are small patches of  
 estate plantation, otherwise the area 
 has a few groups of trees planted as a
 windbreak. Drystane dykes can be seen 
 where farm boundaries  once were,now  
 they are gradually being replaced by  
 fences.Skeletons of forgotten crofts  
 can be seen on the hillside in the sun</content>
