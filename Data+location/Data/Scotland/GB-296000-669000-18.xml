		<content>     I had a talk with them and this is
 what I was told.                      
     One day I was chatting with them, 
 while having a cup of tea.   I asked  
 them if there were many small         
 farmsteads in this area and the answer
 was "No".   This surprised me         
 immensely as I thought they would be  
 popular.   I asked them why they moved
 to Ballencrief, to take up farming.   
 I  was told that when they were       
 married they had a chance of a cottage
 in Ballencrief.   They moved there and
 found fields full of weeds and rough  
 grass, which only goats would eat.    
 They took up the idea and started     
 farming goats.   Just out of          
 curiousity I asked if they thought    
 farming on a small time basis will be 
 going on in 200 years time and they   
 said "Yes, because more people are    
 turning to small farms."              </content>
