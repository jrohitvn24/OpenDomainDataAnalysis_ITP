		<content>   The area in this study is part of   
 the parish of Stenness in Orkney, a   
 parish which gets its name from the   
 standing stones on the point or       
 'ness'. 56% of the study area is made 
 up of land and the remainder is water.
 Of the water area most of it is taken 
 up with the Stenness Loch, an arm of  
 the sea and the remainder is the      
 Harray Loch, a freshwater loch itself 
 joined to the Stenness Loch through a 
 narrow opening over which passes the  
 Brig o' Brogar. Where the Stenness    
 Loch joins the sea properly a bridge  
 called the Brig o' Waithe passes over 
 it carrying the main road, the A965   
 between Kirkwall and Stromness, the   
 two principal towns. The area has been
 anciently settled as we know from some
 of the many prehistoric monuments     
 which are found in the locality.
