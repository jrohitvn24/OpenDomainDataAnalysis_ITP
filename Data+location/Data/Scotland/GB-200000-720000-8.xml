		<title>08THE LOCAL BUS SERVICE.</title>
		<content> The bus service is the only commercial
 communication to Oban apart from the  
 telephone. The bus is more than a     
 means of transport as Johnnie the bus 
 driver takes supplies for the shop and
 prescriptions for the old age         
 pensioners and people who are ill.    
  Next school year I will be on the bus
 every school day because I will be    
 going to Oban High School which is the
 closest secondary school to our to us.
  There is a rumour that the bus       
 service will stop because the special 
 grants might be withdrawn and then all
 of the children would have to stay in 
 the school hostel during term time.   
 I would not like that at all!         
  Not only would it affect the school  
 children but it would stop people     
 who have no cars going to Oban for    
 shopping or other business which they 
 cannot do here in Kilchrenan.         </content>
