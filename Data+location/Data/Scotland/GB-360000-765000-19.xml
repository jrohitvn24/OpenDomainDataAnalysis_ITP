		<content>    My name is Steven. Last night I    
 went to Taranty Fair near Brechin.    
 It used to be a Horse and Cattle Fair 
 long ago but now it is just a funfair.
 It happens every year on the first    
 Tuesday after the second Monday in    
 June.                                 
    There were lots of things to do    
 there, some easy, some hard. I went to
 the Dodgems which was great fun. My   
 Dad put the machine at full throttle  
 and I had to steer. Im surprised with 
 bashing into people that they did not 
 have a headache. I was also on the    
 waltzer but I am never going again as 
 it was so scarey. At one stall you had
 to shoot a millimetre square. Even if 
 you did get 21 points or over you only
 got a small cheap teddy-bear, which   
 was not worth 30p. Though some stalls 
 were not value for money, I enjoyed it
 all.                                  </content>
