		<title>15LARAS DAY CONT.</title>
		<content> I walk to school and on my way meet my
 best friend ELAINE LENNOX.I normally  
 look for insects which is one of my   
 hobbies.I spotted a worm, a spider, a 
 ladybird and a beetle.It was Monday   
 and during music the class played     
 pop/records.For lunch I ate           
 sausages,chips,beans,toffee/cake and  
 custard.All the girls played          
 handstands at lunch/time.At school we 
 did maths and English finishing off   
 our day with physical education.When I
 came home at 4o/clock I took GUY for a
 walk to buy some sweets.For tea I ate 
 beef olives and herb potatoes with    
 French beans.For seconds I had caramel
 pudding.At 9.30 I went to the toilet, 
 changed into my night/clothes,        
 brushed my teeth and jumped into my   
 warm bed. I usually read till 10.30   
 and then fall asleep thinking of my   
 busy day//////////////////////        </content>
