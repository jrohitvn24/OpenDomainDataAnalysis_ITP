		<title>19FORESTRY AROUND LAMLASH.</title>
		<content>    The forestry in Lamlash occupies an
 area roughly 2.5Km square in the north
 west part of Lamlash.The land it      
 occupies would otherwise be rough     
 moorland,which is of very little use  
 to the dairy farmers of Lamlash.      
   The Coniferous trees were planted   
 during a period from 1960_1962.At the 
 present moment they are not yet fully 
 mature.This means that the forestry   
 will have to wait until at least 1995 
 before they will be ready for cutting 
 and exporting to the mainland.        
    It is only on the highest and most 
 exposed areas that the forestry does  
 not penetrate,due to the poor soils   
 and high winds.There is always the    
 threat of deer eating the younger     
 trees and scraping the bark off the   
 older trees,For this reason the deer  
 population is kept to a minimum.
