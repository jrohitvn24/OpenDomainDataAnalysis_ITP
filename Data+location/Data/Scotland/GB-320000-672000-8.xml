		<content>   In 1762 John Watson died and left   
 Â£5000 to a charity to use as they     
 thought best. In 1822 this amount had 
 been expanded to Â£110,000 and was used
 to start a school with boarding       
 facilities to house and educate the   
 fatherless children of the            
 professional classes. The school was  
 in use up until 1981 at which time it 
 became the{Scottish National Gallery} 
{of Modern Art.}                       
   The gallery has three floors with 22
 galleries. It also has a library for  
 studying art and the artists of the   
 20th century. The gallery also has a  
 tea shop which sells small prints of  
 the paintings and post-cards.         
   Many of the larger sculptures and   
 exhibits are displayed in the grounds 
 outside. The grounds are very         
 extensive,extending right down to the 
 Water of Leith.                       </content>
