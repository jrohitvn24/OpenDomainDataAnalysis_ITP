		<content> The villages of Gullane and Dirleton  
 are bordered on the landward side by  
 fields and golf courses and on the    
 seaward side by sandy beaches.        
 Gullane is the larger village with a  
 variety of shops and services while   
 Dirleton, since the building of the   
 by-pass, has few services or shops.   
 Main expansion of Gullane has occurred
 in the last thirty years but Dirleton,
 apart from the occasional new house,  
 has hardly changed in fifty years.    
 The safe, sandy beaches and links golf
 courses make Gullane an attractive    
 tourist area.The famous Muirfield Golf
 Course is situated on the north-east  
 boundary of the village.              
                                       
 All of the information contained in   
 the following pages was researched and
 collated by the P6 and P7 pupils of   
 Gullane Primary School, June 1985.    </content>
