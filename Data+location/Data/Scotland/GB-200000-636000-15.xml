		<content>   Situated at Rosaburn, Brodick, is   
 the Heritage Museum.  There is a      
 working smiddy, an old Arran Cottage, 
 a coach house with geological,        
 archaeological and shipping displays, 
 old agriculture implements and the    
 school's heritage project. Attractions
 this season were displays of          
 lace-making, spinning, weaving and    
 horseshoeing.                         
   Though man has advanced greatly     
 through the invention of new machinery
 and materials some of the island's    
 population have chosen to come here   
 and pursue what might be described as 
 the old crafts - spinning, weaving,   
 knitting, basketry, pottery,          
 wood-carving etc. The Art and Craft   
 industry in Brodick is thriving with a
 shop opening recently in Glasgow and  
 some local craftsmen exporting to     
 other parts of the world.             </content>
