		<title>01Kingdom of the White House</title>
		<content> The south and mid west of the block is
 mainly sea with part of a striking 3  
 mile beach backed by sandunes up to   
 the main road which have been grass   
 implanted in a largely successful     
 attempt to prevent them shifting.  A  
 small camping/caravan site is situated
 towards the northern end of the dunes.
 The central area of the block is      
 coniferous forest surrounded by       
 farmland, mainly rough grazing but    
 with some cultivated grassland.The NW 
 corner marks the start of an area of  
 rocks and cliffs and is covered by    
 heather and peat.Here is situated the 
 'White House of the Northern Gate',   
 which stands alone and can be seen for
 miles around.The remaining area is    
 residential with Dunnet village       
 nestling in the dip between the farm- 
 land hills.The only occupation in the 
 area is farming sheep,diairy &amp; silage.</content>
