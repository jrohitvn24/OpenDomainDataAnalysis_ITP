		<title>20The Parish Minister</title>
		<content> On the 29th of May we interviewed the 
 local minister,Mr Hodge.He has stayed 
 in{Longside}over 6 years.The people of
{Longside}chose him to work in{Longside
 He came because he wasn't very happy  
 where he was.He has always wanted to  
 be a minister and has been for 19     
 years.Mr Hodge enjoys living in{      
{Longside}because of the environment   
 and people and wishes to live in      
{Longside}until he retires.His most    
 common service is on a Sunday which is
 an hour long and there are usually    
 over a 100 people there.Mr Hodge and  
 his organist work out all the hymms   
 they are going to sing each week and  
 they never sing the same song more    
 than once a year.He also goes round   
 prisons helping people and some people
 that do not go to his church ask for  
 his help.The church he works in is    
 over 150 years old.                   </content>
