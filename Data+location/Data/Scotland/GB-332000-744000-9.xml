		<content> The main A94 Trunk road from Perth to 
 Aberdeen runs through our area.One bus
 per day runs in each direction. This  
 shortage of public transport makes car
 ownership almost essential. We found  
 in a survey that 81% of households    
 owned at least one car.               
 The railway line from Perth to        
 Aberdeen which ran through our area   
 was lifted about two years ago.       
 A large percentage of households (75%)
 have a telephone.                     
 Our school has a large catchment area 
 and many pupils have long distances to
 travel to school.A mini-bus is        
 provided by the education authorities 
 to transport us to and from school.
