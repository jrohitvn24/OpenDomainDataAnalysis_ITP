		<title>12HOBBIES IN KILMARNOCK</title>
		<content> We asked one hundred people in New    
 Farm Loch eleven questions on         
 hobbies.We found that the most popular
 hobby was reading. 12% of the people  
 we interviewed were members of        
 competitive teams. One of the people  
 we interviewed never watched          
 television and 38% watched for more   
 than three hours per day. 64% listened
 to the radio for more than half an    
 hour each day.However we were         
 surprised that only 2% of the people  
 in New Farm go jogging. During the    
 last month 39 people have been to the 
 Dick Institute, which is Kilmarnock's 
 Public Library, and 16 have been to   
 the Kilmarnock Leisure Centre, where  
 you can swim or play badminton or     
 football. If they could afford it,    
 20% of the people would like to go    
 skiing as their hobby.
