		<title>11THE WEAVER</title>
		<content> The weaver is to be found at "Sweet   
 Brier" on the Main Street.  You can go
 in and watch the Weaver making all    
 sorts of rugs.  She first opened in   
 April l985, so she has not had a lot  
 of visitors so far.  She has two      
 bigger shops in Aberdeen and Glasgow. 
 She uses Cheviot wool for travelling  
 rugs, tweed and wool for knee rugs,   
 and fine wool for cushions.  It takes 
 5.5 days to set everything up and     
 weave a floor rug, but once everything
 is set up it only takes 2 days.  The  
 colours that the weaver uses in her   
 products are natural colours like dark
 red, blue, brown and green which are  
 very much like the colours of the land
 scape around Tomintoul itself.        
 Visitors are made very welcome and    
 can drop in at any time during the    
 day.
