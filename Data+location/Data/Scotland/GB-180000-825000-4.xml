 Shinty is a very old game.            
 Shinty is played by 12 players on each
 side including the goalie.            
 The game is played with sticks called 
 Shinty sticks or Caman in Gaelic.     
 The sticks are used to hit a leather  
 ball stuffed with cork.               
 The local game is played at Kirkton   
 used by Kinlochshiel.                 
 The players wear sweaters,socks and   
                                       
 shorts in red and white.              
 Boots must be free from metal plates  
 and there should be no protruding     
 spikes or nails.                      
 The local team is called Kinlochshiel 
 because the teams come from Kintail,  
 Lochalsh and Shiel.                   
 Kinlochshiel won the league cup this  
 year 1985.
