		<content> Port Glasgow's shopping and market    
 facilities are not of a very high     
 standard. The town centre{shops}have  
 not got the same variety as many of   
 the larger nearby towns e.g. Paisley  
 and Greenock. It is for this reason   
 that many people do travel to these   
 larger towns for shopping or even go  
 all the way to Glasgow.               
    For very-day needs then either the 
 shops in the centre will do or the    
 local shopping areas built in the     
 housing schemes. At present there are 
 no{markets}in Port Glasgow.           
    There are other{businesses}which   
 are found in the town, most of them in
 the town centre. These are the usual  
 High Street banks, Post Offices, Legal
 Firms and an assortment of other      
{trades}and businesses. Local people   
 would like to see the shopping        
 facilities of the town improved.      </content>
