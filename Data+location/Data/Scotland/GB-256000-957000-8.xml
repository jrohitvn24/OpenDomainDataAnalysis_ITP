		<content> St Andrews church was built in 1690 on
 the site of an older church. The old  
 est grave is around 1690. It is a     
 Mackay church and the crypt and       
 plaques on the walls bear witness to  
 that fact. It is regularly visited by 
 members of the Clan Mackay whose chief
 is Lord Reay.The church is small and  
 whitewashed with crowstepped gables.  
 The gallery and the {Laird's loft }   
 are reached by an outside stair and   
 not from inside the building. The     
 church is in the shape of a cross but 
 parts of the arms of the cross have   
 been sealed off and are now side      
 rooms.One of these is the vestry where
 the minister prepares for services and
 the other is used for meetings.
