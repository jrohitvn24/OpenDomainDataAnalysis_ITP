		<content> RAINFALL ON THIS EASTERN SIDE OF THE  
 SCOTTISH BORDERS &amp; AT THIS HEIGHT OF  
 200M ABOVE SEA LEVEL, IS NOT VERY     
 HIGH, GENERALLY ABOUT 24.5". THE      
 SUMMER OF 1985 WAS UNUSUALLY WET BUT  
 WAS BALANCED BY A VERY DRY OCT., SO   
 THAT A DIFFICULT, BUT NOT HOPELESS,   
 HARVEST HAS LED TO A GOOD DRILLING    
 SEASON &amp; MANY FIELDS ARE AGAIN GREEN  
 WELL BEFORE WINTER. RECENTLY THE      
 AUTUMN ASPECT OF THE AREA HAS ALTERED 
 AS FARMERS SOW AT THE BACKEND &amp; NO    
 LONGER RISK WAITING FOR THE SPRING,   
 WHICH IS OFTEN LATE, COLD, WET &amp;      
 SHORT. THIS MEANS A VERY BUSY HARVEST 
 TIME WITH A LARGER WORKFORCE &amp; MORE   
 MACHINERY &amp; VERY FEW STUBBLE FIELDS,  
 WITH THE EFFECT THAT HAS ON THE       
 PARTRIDGE POPULATION &amp; THE HUNTING    
 COMMUNITY, IN THIS AREA THE           
 BERWICKSHIRE HUNT.
