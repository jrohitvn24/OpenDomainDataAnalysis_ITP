 When trees are planted by the Forestry
 Commission,they are planted very close
 together.  As they grow towards the   
 light and because they are so close to
 each other, they grow very tall and   
 straight.  The trees do not grow long 
 branches because there is no room.    
 The thinning of trees begins after    
 about thirty years  The other trees   
 will be left to grow for sixty years. 
 When they are cut down, the thick end 
 of the trunk is sold to sawmills to be
 sawn into logs.  The dividing line    
 between thick and thin trunk is where 
 the 16cm diameter comes.  The thin    
 part of the trunk might be exported to
 Norway or Sweden.  There it is made   
 into pulp for paper_making.           
 Near Inverness there is a factory for 
 making timber into chipboard.         </content>
