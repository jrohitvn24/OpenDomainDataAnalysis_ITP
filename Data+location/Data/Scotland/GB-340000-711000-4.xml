		<content>  Pitscottie is a  hamlet  three  miles
 from Cupar.  It has around twenty-five
 houses and buildings and a  population
 of about sixty  people. It is built on
 a crossroads.   One of the roads  runs
 from  Ceres  to  St. Andrews  and  the
 other from  Crail  to  Cupar.   It  is
 surrounded  by  farmland.  Children go
 to Ceres Primary School by bus.       
  Jute  was  once grown in the area and
 100  years  ago there was a linen mill
 in Dura Den  which used Ceres burn for
 power.  In  Pitscottie  now there is a
 garage, a  bus hire service, a general
 store and an agricultural contractor's
 business.  In the centre of Pitscottie
 is  an  attractive  public house which
 sells   midday  meals  to  locals  and
 tourists.                             
  Most of the homes are  single storey,
 privately owned cottages.             
  Pitscottie is a peaceful hamlet.     </content>
