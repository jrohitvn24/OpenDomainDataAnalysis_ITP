		<content>  We visited the{sheltered housing     
 which is situated beside our school.  
 Most of the people had lived in{East  
{Kilbride}standard housing but one of  
 them lived in sheltered housing       
 somewhere else before coming to Plover
 Drive.The old people get a call from  
 the wardens on the intercom twice a   
 day to check that they are alright.   
  On Mondays,Wednesdays and Fridays    
 different meals are provided at the   
 lunch club in the community centre.   
 They all enjoy the many activities    
 provided such as bingo,auctions and   
 jumble sales.All have families visit  
 them regularly.Although the busy      
 Crosshouse Road is nearby the old     
 people do not find it a problem.The   
 ladies all liked living in Greenhills 
 and thought no improvements could be  
 made, but the hill to the shops seemed
 to be a drawback.                     </content>
