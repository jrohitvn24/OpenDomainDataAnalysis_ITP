 SECONDARY EDUCATION                   
                                       
  Our secondary education is in Annan, 
 four miles from here .                
  When pupils of Cummertrees are 12,   
 they move to Annan Academy,the only   
 secondary school in this district.    
  The pupils would get to school by    
 service bus,or a school bus.          
  There are in between 11OO and 12OO   
 pupils in Annan Academy.Annan Academy 
 is quite modern,with five storey block
 buildings.
