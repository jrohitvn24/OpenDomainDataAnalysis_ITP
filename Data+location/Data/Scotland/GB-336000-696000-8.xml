		<content>      Our school has 140 pupils on its 
 roll. This figure includes nursery    
 pupils.                               
      The children mostly come from the
 area immediately surrounding the      
 school and from part of Methil,lying  
 South of Methilhaven Road, although   
 some nursery children come from the   
 "Bird" scheme North of Methilhaven    
 Road in Buckhaven.                    
      The building is old. It was built
 in 1908.A modernisation programme     
 is to be started in August this year. 
 The heating and wiring systems are to 
 be replaced,the classrooms are to be  
 renovated ,redecorated and fitted with
 fixed furnishings.Best of all,we are  
 to have our own kitchen ,where school 
 meals are to be cooked.No more central
 kitchen dinners!                      
      We can hardly wait till April    
 l986,when the work will be completed. </content>
