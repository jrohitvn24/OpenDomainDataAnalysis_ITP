{five visiting teachers.}The music and 
 drama teachers come once a fortnight,

 term. A wind instrument tutor takes   
 five pupils once a week. There are    
{after school clubs}for gymnastics,

{special. Three children from P.7 cook 
{their own lunch and invite three      
{guests. They plan, budget, shop, cook 
{and clear up. The afternoon is devoted
{to activities. P. 7 is divided into   
{three groups, one baking, one playing
