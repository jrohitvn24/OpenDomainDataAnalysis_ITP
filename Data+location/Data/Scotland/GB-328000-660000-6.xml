  Field boundaries are mainly          
 hedgerows. A recent disturbing  trend 
 is the removal of some to increase    
 field sizes. At Parduvine, the farmer 
 has cut a hedge down to ground level. 
 The shadow it cast delayed the        
 ripening of the crop by several weeks.
 Also he wants to straighten the stream
 beside this hedge to lessen the risk  
 of flooding.                          
  There is a large amount of wildlife  
 including Roe Deer,Rabbits,Hares and  
 the usual wild birds such as          
 Chaffinches,Sparrows and Owls about.  
 Many game birds are to be seen, such  
 as Pheasant and Grouse.
