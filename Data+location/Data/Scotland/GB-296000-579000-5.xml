 Kirkton is a small village in the     
 country.                              
 Most people who live in Kirkton would 
 not like to move into the town because
 of the hustle and bustle of the area. 
 They prefer the quietness of the      
 country.  The style of the new houses 
 in the area is not well liked, people 
 prefer the old style.  There are not  
 many complaints about the housing.    
 In Kirkton there is only one shop so  
 the public go into the town to buy the
 bulk of their shopping.
