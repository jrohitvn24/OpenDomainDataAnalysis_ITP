		<title>08  Local History_Lentran</title>
		<content>  Lentran is a place where older people
 still remember a meal mill, a bobbin  
 mill, a blacksmith's shop and a police
 station, but now we find none of them.
  Originally, the police station was at
 Drumchardine but later shifted to     
 Kirkhill.                             
  There are many self contained houses 
 in Lentran; one of which is           
 Berryfield.                           
  The name Lentran means"the meadow of 
 corn crakes,"and they often used to be
 heard in the neighbourhood though not 
 so frequent lately.                   
  The Lentran estate is the property of
  a former provost of Inverness and his
 house dates back to 1866 when it was  
 built by a London Stock broker,H.E.   
 White.However one native remembers the
 house destroyed by fire and this date 
 was of the present building, and not  
 the original one.                     </content>
