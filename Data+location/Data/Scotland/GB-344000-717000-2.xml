		<title>02GUARDBRIDGE - ITS HISTORY</title>
		<content> The village of Guardbridge is of      
 relatively recent origin, though as a 
 crossing point over the Eden it has   
 been important for hundreds of years. 
 According to the 3rd statistical      
 account it derives its name from 'Gair
 or Gaur' meaning a triangular piece of
 land and 'bridge' refers to the bridge
 built by Archbishop Henry Wardlaw     
 which used to carry traffic.  It has 6
 arches; but due to heavy traffic is   
 now used by pedestrians.  A modern    
 bridge stands beside it, taking       
 traffic from St Andrews to Cupar and  
 Dundee.  The surrounding area seems to
 have been of some importance as a port
 in the distant past, and cargoes of   
 coal, whisky, ale and potatoes were   
 loaded/unloaded. There is even        
 evidence of a railway pier so that    
 goods by rail could be brought right  
 down to the river.                    </content>
