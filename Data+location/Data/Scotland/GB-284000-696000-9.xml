		<title>09HILL FARMING AROUND MENSTRIE</title>
		<content> The hills around Menstrie take up more
 than a third of our area, they are    
 mainly used for sheep farming and     
 rough grazing. In the winter the sheep
 are taken down into pens. In our area 
 the lambing comes late in Spring. And 
 before the lambing season the gorse is
 burnt to prevent the lambs from being 
 caught in the spiny branches. Some    
 sheep each year are killed by falling 
 down gulleys or slipping down the     
 almost sheer south side of the hills. 
 Every few weeks the sheperds move the 
 sheep to a new grazing pasture. The   
 fleeces of the sheep are sent to the  
 Wool Marketing Board. Many of the     
 sheperds live on small holdings       
 situated on the lower faces of the    
 hills. The peaks of the hills are too 
 rocky to be of use to farmers.
