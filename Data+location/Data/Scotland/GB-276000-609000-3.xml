		<title>03A Sanquhar Family</title>
		<content> Many families in Sanquhar can trace   
 their family tree through 4 or 5      
 generations, and some even longer.    
 Others, however, are "incomers" to the
 area. The Brydsons moved here in 1976 
 when Mr Brydson was appointed as a    
 Social Worker employed by the Regional
 Council. His work takes him to many of
 the nearby villages. Mrs Brydson is a 
 teacher in the local primary school   
 and has been involved with some of the
 youth organisations in the town.Their 
 two daughters, aged 12 and 16, both   
 attend Sanquhar Academy and are active
 members of the town's Silver Band,    
 attending the twice-weekly rehearsals.
 Both parents were born in Dumfries &amp;  
 Galloway, and at weekends the family  
 often visits their many relatives who 
 live in the region. To further their  
 education the girls will reluctantly  
 have to leave Sanquhar.               </content>
