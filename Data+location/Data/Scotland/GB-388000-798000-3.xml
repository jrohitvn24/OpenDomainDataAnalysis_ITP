		<content>{ Captain Lumsden}is the biggest single
 land owner in{Banchory-Devenick.}He is
 the laird. A lot of the land is rented
 out for farming and some of the houses
 and cottages on the estate are also   
 rented out by him. Most of the other  
 houses have a medium sized garden.    
  There are a lot of farms in the      
 area and moorland on the higher       
 ground where it is not suitble for    
 farming.There is marshland but some   
 has been drained by farmers.          
  Just a few new houses are allowed to 
 be built and only on a site where     
 there used to be an old building.     
 Nearly all of Banchory-Devenick is    
 countryside. The{Roman Catholic       
{College of Blairs}owns a lot of land  
 as does{Auchlunies Estate.
