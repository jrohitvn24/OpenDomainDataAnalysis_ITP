		<title>07Unemployment  in Viewpark</title>
		<content>                                       
        In the Viewpark area there are 
1,810 unemployed, a high percentage of 
the population. Many young people join 
a Youth Training Scheme but not many   
find a job afterwards. One local scheme
(ITEC) trains youngsters to use comput-
ers and many do find work after it.    
        The unemployment rate has gone 
up in the last few years. The police   
say that there is also more vandalism  
and house-breaking in the area. Thieves
mostly go for video-recorders or TV's. 
        The unemployed can use their UB
40 card to use the baths in Bellshill  
free. Many go to the library. Most days
you can see groups of youngsters       
hanging about the streets or the local 
'Glen' with nothing to do. Many pupils 
in our school have someone in their    
family who is unemployed.
