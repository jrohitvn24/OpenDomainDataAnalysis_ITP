		<title>20Transport, New Galloway</title>
		<content> Due to New Galloway's rural setting,  
 car ownership is really considered    
 essential.The Postal Service bus,     
 which runs twice daily, carries few   
 passengers, and, these are, generally,
 the older inhabitants. The nearest    
 Railway station is at Dumfries,       
 30Kms.S., or at Ayr,35Kms.N. The      
 nearest sea port is at                
 Stranraer,80Kms.W. where a ferry runs 
 to Larne, Ireland. For other sailings,
 one has to use an English sea port or 
 go to Ardrossan in Strathclyde. The   
 nearest airport is at Prestwick,3Kms. 
 N. of Ayr. There are 4 exits from New 
 Galloway.-A712,A75W. to Stranraer;    
 A762,A713N.to Ayr or A713S.to Castle  
 Douglas;A762S.to Laurieston.One may   
 then go S. to Kirkcudbright,E. to     
 Castle Douglas,or W.to Gatehouse-of-  
 Fleet. The roads are all well-surfaced
 but twisting,and caution is advised.  </content>
