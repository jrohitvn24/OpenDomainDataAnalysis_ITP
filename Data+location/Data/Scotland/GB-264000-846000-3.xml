		<content> The conifers in the woods of Kessock  
 and Drumsmittal on Ord Hill are being 
 felled for export to Sweden.Below,    
 going west along the road past        
 N.Kessock to Charleston,you see many  
 modern bungalows.Then come the old    
 houses.Mr.MacRae,the retired          
 headteacher of Drumsmittal School     
 lives in the Mill House.The water from
 the old dam came down the lade to the 
 mealmill behind the house.Now you go  
 up steps there to the council estate. 
 Next door lives Mr.Donald Gillies,the 
 sheep contractor.For nearly a century 
 his family have rented Black Isle     
 grazing to winter lambs from the north
 and west of Scotland.Now farmers begin
 to winter their own lambs with bought 
 feed.Twenty years ago Mr.Gillies drove
 a flock of sheep over the ferry and   
 through Inverness to the mart for the 
 last time.                            </content>
