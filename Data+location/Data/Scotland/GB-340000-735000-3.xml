		<content> The area has been settled since about 
 3000 BC. In the SE corner of the block
 near Craighill on a high bluff        
 overlooking the Fithie Burn is the    
 site of an{IRON AGE FORT}and{BROCH.}  
 The oldest historical settlement is   
 the hill-foot village of              
 Balgray/Tealing but only the Kirkton  
 with its old church lies within the   
 block. Some new bungalow-type houses  
 are being built here.                 
 The newest settlement is{INVERALDIE}  
 situated in the centre of the block   
 close to the Forfar Road. During the  
 last war the RAF built quarters for   
 airmen here. The camp cinema is still 
 used as a hall. After the war         
 squatters from Dundee moved into the  
 disused buildings. Then the local     
 Council were forced to build modern   
 flatted accommodation. Recently new   
 semi-detached houses have been built. </content>
