		<title>11LIFE IN KNIGHTSRIDGE</title>
		<content>                                       
   I live in Knightsridge in Livingston
 and have done so all my life. I don't 
 think there are enough play facilities
 - all we have are a couple of swings  
 and some chutes dotted around. There  
 is only one big park and it's really  
 supposed to be a football pitch.      
   I think that some of the houses in  
 Knightsridge are nice. I like my      
 house, it is a four apartment terraced
 villa, and it is close to the woods   
 but some of the trees are being       
 knocked down and this spoils it. There
 are shops near my house too but the   
 area is very littered and vandalism is
 rife. The shops all have metal        
 shutters to protect them but these too
 are covered in graffiti. The area is  
 being renovated at the moment and this
 should help Knightsridge to become  a 
 better place.                         </content>
