		<title>17FAMILY LIFE IN BANCHORY</title>
		<content> In my family, Mum is usually the boss,
 for Dad is usually away in Abu Dhabi  
 working in the oil industry. He comes 
 home every month. There are five      
 people in our family. We spend most of
 our spare time going for walks and    
 watching television. Our house has    
 four bedrooms and three bathrooms, as 
 well as a living room, dining room and
 kitchen. Mum is kept very busy with   
 the housework and my new baby sister, 
 Lucy. Lucy wakes us all up at 5 a.m.  
 so we don't get much sleep! After     
 school I like to study insects and    
 look after other animals. I often help
 a friend of mine, Gillian, to look    
 after her horse. We clean out the     
 stables and groom the horse. My other 
 sister gets me into trouble sometimes,
 but most of the time she is O.K. My   
 dad works in the oil business, and    
 that is why we moved here from Leeds. </content>
