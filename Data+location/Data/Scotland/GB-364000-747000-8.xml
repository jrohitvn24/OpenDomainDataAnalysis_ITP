		<content> The village takes its name from the   
 word "Inver" meaning "at the mouth of 
 " and Keilor, a small stream which    
 enters the sea about 2 km away.The    
 village has 5 streets with a mixture  
 of private and council housing.There  
 are houses for senior citizens and    
 recently more houses have been built  
 especially for the elderly and        
 handicapped.                          
 The village serves as a centre for    
 nearly all of the daily activities of 
 the area.                             
                                       
{CLUBS}_ Most of the people who live in
 this area go to organizations in      
 Inverkeilor.There are a lot of clubs  
 for adults and children in the village
 .When we asked people in the area if  
 they would like more facilities their 
 answers varied,but many people would  
 like a bowling green.                 </content>
