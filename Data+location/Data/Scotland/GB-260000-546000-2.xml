		<content>  This area is under the influence of  
 the Gulf Stream drift, which means    
 that the climate is very mild.  Snow  
 rarely falls, and if it does, it does 
 not last for more than a day or two.  
 The prevailing winds are              
 south-westerlies which bring with them
 moderate falls of rain.  When other   
 parts of the region may be having     
 quite severe weather, we have been    
 known to be basking in sunshine.  This
 mild climate is most conducive to     
 pasture land which makes up 90% of    
 this block.  The land is well drained 
 by small streams, all having their    
 outlet at the coast nearby, and once  
 providing the scattered population    
 with their household water supply.    
 The area is well serviced with        
 scondary roads. Cart tracks and       
 footpaths link most of the farms.
