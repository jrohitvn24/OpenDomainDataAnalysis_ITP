		<title>20Government Offices, Wick</title>
		<content> The Government Offices situated at    
 Girnigoe Street consists of the       
 Department of Employment, Department  
 of Health and Social Security, Job    
 centre, Department of Agriculture  and
 Fisheries, and the Tax Department.    
 Information from the Job centre       
 stated that 25.9% of the males from   
 the area served (John O'Groats to     
 Bonar Bridge),and 9.1% of the females 
 were unemployed.There are not very    
 many jobs available at the moment,    
 Dounreay and Kestrel Marine offering  
 the most. There are a few seasonal    
 jobs  such as hotel work but these    
 offer no long term employment         
 opportunities. The outlook for school 
 leavers is very poor but it is hoped  
 that the proposed extension of        
 Dounreay will bring more jobs to the  
 county.                               
                                       </content>
