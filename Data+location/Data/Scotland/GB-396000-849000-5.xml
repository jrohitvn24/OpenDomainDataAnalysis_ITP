		<content> The forester must treat all stumps    
 with fungicide within half an hour    
 otherwise the spores will attach      
 themselves to other healthy trees.    
 This disease can cause a serious loss 
 of wood production.                   
    By far the most damage, however, is
 caused by rabbits.  Since 1953 and    
 1954 the disease Mixamatosis has      
 helped to control the rabbit          
 population but there are growing      
 numbers again and they take the buds  
 from young trees which is stunting    
 their growth.  Another problem from   
 the wildlife of the forest arises from
 the roe deer.  They brouse on trees in
 winter.  In early summer they drag    
 their antlers through the branches in 
 order to strip the velvet off them.   
 They attack both conifers and         
 hardwoods alike in this way.
