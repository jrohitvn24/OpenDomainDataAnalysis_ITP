		<title>18COMERTON RIDING STABLES</title>
		<content> Part of the leisure scene in Leuchars 
 is the riding stable.  Roughly 12     
 people go a week, Saturday is the     
 busiest day.  We also found out that  
 summer is the busiest season.         
 Comerton have 14 horses and ponies    
 consisting of riding horses, show     
 jumpers and eventers.  Their horses   
 eat hay which is bought from a hay    
 farm in Upper Largo (but sometimes    
 they buy it from elsewhere).  The     
 lessons cost Â£4.50 per day and when   
 they go out on treks, they go riding  
 up to Tentsmuir Forest and beach or   
 just up to the moors.  They take their
 horses to quite a few shows such as   
 one-day events and hunter trials and  
 they have got a a lot of rosettes and 
 cups for cross country events.  They  
 also have a few certificates.         
                                       
                                       </content>
