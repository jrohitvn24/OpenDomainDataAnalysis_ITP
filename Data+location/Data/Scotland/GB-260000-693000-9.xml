		<title>09ARTS AND CRAFTS IN ARNPRIOR</title>
		<content>  One mile north of Arnprior, on the   
 road to the Lake of Mentieth is       
 Tipperdarroch and in the farmhouse is 
 one of the smallest workshop studios  
 in Scotland. Using a modern micro     
 electronic dental drill, diamond burrs
 and rubber polishers, the craft of    
 hand engraved glass is carried out by 
 a craftswoman who claims to find much 
 of her inspiration from the natural   
 beauties of  the surrounding country. 
 In a world of mass production many    
 people appreciate a present which has 
 been hand crafted and a personal touch
 is often added by way of initials and 
 dates.  Commissions find their way to 
 all parts of the world - America,     
 Russia, India and Australia for       
 example.  Each piece of hand engraved 
 crystal glass is unique and signed by 
 the engraver.                         
                                       </content>
