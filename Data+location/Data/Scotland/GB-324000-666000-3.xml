		<content>    THE BUSIEST TIME OF YEAR FOR A HILL
 SHEEP FARMER IS FROM MID APRIL TO THE 
 END OF MAY BECAUSE THAT IS THE TIME   
 THE LAMBS ARE BORN.A BUSY  DAY FOR A  
 FARMER IS RISING AT 5'OCLOCK AND AFTER
 A CUP OF TEA GOING ROUND THE HILL TOPS
 AND ALSO INSPECTING THE SHEEP IN THE  
 FARMS.LAMBS IN A HILL SHEEP FARM DO   
 NOT USUALLY DIE VERY OFTEN ABOUT 1 IN 
 EVERY 1 HUNDRED.USUALLY THERE ARE     
 ABOUT 700 BREEDING EWES  ,180 EWE     
 HOGGS(LAMBS FROM 6 TO 15 YEARS OLD)AND
 ABOUT 16 TO 20 RAMS.THE NORMAL LIFE   
 FOR A EWE IS 8 YEARS.  FARMERS KEEP   
 THEM UNTIL THEY ARE 6 YEARS OLD THEN  
 THEY ARE SOLD AT THE MARKET AND TAKEN 
 TO AN ARABLE FARM FOR ONE OR TWO      
 YEARS.HIGH UP THERE CAN BE A LOT OF   
 SEVERE FROST AND LOTS OF SNOW.STRONG  
 GALES REGULARLY SWEEP THE FARM WHICH  
 IS OVER{500}METRES IN HEIGHT.
