		<title>07THE MILL &amp; CLIMBING BOTHY.</title>
		<content>   Close to the Clova Hotel there is a 
 very old stone building.It was        
 originally a water mill but through   
 the years it has been put to various  
 uses  _ for milling grain, generating 
 electricty and as a fish hatchery.    
 Today it is used as a climbers' bothy.
 It can and does accomodate up to 30   
 persons especially at weekends. The   
 building is single storied and        
 contains only one room. It is bereft  
 of furniture but it does contain a    
 solid fuel stove. The cost of the     
 overnight accomodation is Â£1.35 and a 
 bath may be taken at the hotel for    
 50p.                                  
   During 1984 the mill wheel has been 
 repaired and made operational. It is  
 an overshot wheel. A mill pond is     
 currently in the process of being     
 constructed.
