		<title>02 FARMING IN SYMINGTON 1985</title>
		<content> The farmer I interviewed has{114}cows.
 He does not have any more cows because
 of the{MILK QUOTA.}The Milk Quota was 
 introduced to try to cut down the     
 butter mountain to a butter hill. This
 is an E.E.C. ruling.                  
 A cow has to be washed,clipped,combed 
 then kept clean though the night and  
 while travelling before going to      
 market.He goes to{KILMARNOCK }and {AYR
  market because they are the nearest  
 to him. He has not got any pigs       
 because he has not got the room for   
 them.                                 
 He has {48}lambs left from lambing    
 time.                                 
 He said that there is going to be     
 major development in the next 2 years 
 and it is to make things easier for   
 him and his 2 sons. The things he is  
 making are a new shed,a parlour,2     
 silage pits and a slurry tank.        </content>
