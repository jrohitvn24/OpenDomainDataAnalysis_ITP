		<title>13RECREATION GALA QUEEN</title>
		<content> The culmination of Civic Week is the  
{Gala Day}on Saturday in a local park. 
  It is to be hoped that the weather is
 good.  The{Gala Queen}and her court   
 attend in full panoply and she        
 is crowned amid rejoicing.She will    
 reign for the following year,lending  
 her royal presence at many events.    
 She is chosen by ballot from one of   
 the local schools,in yearly rotation. 
  In the morning there is a parade of  
 fanciful floats,which passes through  
 the gaily decorated town to a site    
 where the floats are judged and prizes
 awarded.                              
 There is  a fancy dress competition,  
 bands playing and games of all sorts. 
 That evening there are concerts and   
 social events in the clubs.           
 SUNDAY-Children's Film Show and a day 
 of relaxation and perhaps relief.
