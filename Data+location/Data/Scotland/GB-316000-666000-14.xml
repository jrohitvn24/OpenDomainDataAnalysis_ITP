 It was about 7.42 am when I got up.   
 Quickly I ran downstairs and opened   
 all my presents.  There was a cassette
 recorder which I really wanted, a     
 spiral pad, magic pens and Â£15.  After
 school I had a birthday tea. I invited
 my two friends, Frances and Kerry.    
 Kerry gave me a writing set and a pen 
 and Frances gave me a Ghostbusters    
 record and a packet of Smurf          
 transfers.  We then went to the Wimpy 
 Bar which is in Princes Sreet.  It is 
 very big.   There you can buy         
 hamburgers. rolls,chips, soft drinks, 
 teas, coffees and milk shakes. We all 
 had a great time.  Then we went home. 
 When it was time to go home Frances   
 and Kerry each got a goodie bag filled
 with sweets.
