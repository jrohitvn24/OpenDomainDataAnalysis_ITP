 Every year there are three important  
 events.                               
 During the summer term,all the feeder 
 primary schools of Plockton High      
 School meet on the High School sports 
 field.There are flat races,80m,100m,  
 400m and a relay race. While these are
 being run,other competitors try the   
 long jump. After that there is an     
 obstacle race and a tug-of-war.       
 Our school has not won the shield     
 yet but we had some finalists.        
  At Christmas time there are parties  
 in Achmore,Killilan and Balmacara.The 
 pupils from each village go to their  
 own parties.Santa goes to all the     
 parties with toys.                    
  The Sunday School have a picnic at   
 Balmacara Forestry site.The weather is
