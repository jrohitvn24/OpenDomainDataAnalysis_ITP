		<title>20The Fish_Farm at Kylesku.</title>
		<content>  With the opening of the Kylesku      
 Bridge and the loss of ferry          
 employment, the new fish farm which   
 started at Kylesku in March 1985 was  
 very welcome.                         
  At the start, the work was centred at
 Ullapool where sections of the 'pens' 
 were made. At Kylestrome, they were   
 asssembled into floatation units which
 were then towed up the loch and nets  
 attached. Smolts (fish about one year 
 old and weighing about 150g) were put 
 into the floating pens. When the      
 salmon mature in one or two years,they
 will be sold.  At present, only four  
 people are employed but once the fish 
 farm is established, it is hoped more 
 workers will be required.
