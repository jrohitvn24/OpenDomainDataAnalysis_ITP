		<title>12OUR SCHOOL COMPUTER</title>
		<content>  We got our school computer about 2   
 years ago and we raised the money by  
 tattie picking and one of the Dads ran
 in the Glasgow Marathon and gave his  
 sponsor money for the computer.We had 
 a marvellous day picking potatoes.    
 Pupils,parents,former pupils, even a  
 prospective pupil &amp; teachers all      
 worked together to pick a two &amp; a half
 acre field. The farmer,a parent,had   
 said we would get Â£100 per acre, but  
 when the Head Teacher went in for the 
 cheque it was for Â£360 not Â£250 as the
 tractormen had donated their wages for
 the day. We had done so well that all 
 the children got an extra Â£2 &amp; mothers
 got a bag of potatoes each. With the  
 Marathon sponsor money (Â£247) and our 
 tattie picking money we had enough for
 our computer package and also for a   
 disc drive. We now have 2 monitors,2  
 BBC computers and 2 disc drives.      </content>
