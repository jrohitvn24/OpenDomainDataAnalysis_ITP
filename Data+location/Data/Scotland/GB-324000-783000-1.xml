		<title>01Lochnagar - The Summit Area</title>
		<content> This area of Lochnagar massif is the  
 most extensive area of upland,        
 subalpine vegetation in the Eastern   
 Cairngorms.  Large snow wreaths       
 remain well into the summer and these 
 provide many interesting plant        
 communities including alpine saxifrage
 and alpine speedwell.  The cliffs in  
 the area are a haven for many plant   
 rarities including Blue Sow Thistle   
 and Norwegian Cudweed.  The area has  
 two major land uses - recreation and  
 game.  Only deer and grouse shooting  
 operate commercially but the cliffed  
 coirie provides some of the finest    
 winter mountaineering in the country. 
 On many days, the area will appear    
 bleak to the visitor, but in both     
 summer and winter clear skies reveal a
 beauty which inspired Byron to write; 
                                       
                                       </content>
