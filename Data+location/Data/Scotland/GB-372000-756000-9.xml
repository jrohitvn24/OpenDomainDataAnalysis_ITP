		<title>09Day In The Life Of A Parent</title>
		<content>    I usually get up about 7:30. I do  
 not eat breakfast but I have a cup of 
 tea. I take the dog out and get my    
 children up for school. I make their  
 breakfast and then they go to school. 
 After that I get peace to watch the   
 rest of T.V.am. Then I make the beds  
 and do the housework while listning to
 Radio 1. After that I have dinner.    
 After dinner I go shopping if there's 
 anything I need. On the way up to the 
 shops I go in to see my mother. After 
 I've been up the town I take my son   
 home from school. He is younger than  
 my daughter and he comes out of school
 earlier. When I get home I have a cup 
 of tea. Then I make the tea and my    
 daughter comes home from school at    
 4:00. After tea I sit down and watch  
 the "telly". I go to bed at around    
 11:00.                                
                                       </content>
