		<title>12FOOD IN NEWTON MEARNS</title>
		<content>   Mums usually go shopping twice a    
 week to provide food for the rest of  
 the family. When people get up in the 
 morning, they have for their breakfast
 cereal or toast or egg and bacon. At  
 school some children have school      
 dinners which is usually some sort of 
 meat and vegetable and then for       
 pudding they can have sponge and      
 custard. Other children have packed   
 lunches which are usually sandwiches, 
 a drink and some crisps. A few        
 children go to their homes and their  
 Mum can make them lunch.              
    At 5.30 it is tea-time. Our meals  
 are different most nights, but we have
 to eat them whether we like them or   
 not.                                  
    Before we go to bed we usually have
 drink, perhaps hot chocolate or tea.  
 If we are hungry we can have toast but
 we usually have chocolate biscuits.   </content>
