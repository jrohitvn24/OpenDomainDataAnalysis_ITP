		<title>20Changing Times, Kinbrace</title>
		<content> In later years fewer people were      
 employed on the estates because of    
 mechanisation and because in the past 
 wages were much lower. Christmas      
 parties were still well attended and  
 the local hall was packed with young  
 and old. A mobile cinema brought      
 entertainment. The station closed.    
 Television came on the scene. With the
 advent of motor cars people went      
 elsewhere for pleasure and the Hall   
 was no longer used. During the summer 
 months divinity students lived at     
 Kinbrace. They visited our school     
 and homes and encouraged people to    
 attend church. Nowadays the Hall is   
 rotting away.The Church cannot afford 
 to send students. Only six people     
 attend church. Only two children from 
 Kinbrace attend our school.
