		<content> Virtually everyone living in our study
 area their own means of the transport 
 to get to and from work and travel to 
 neighbouring towns for shopping and   
 services. No place is more than 10 min
 travelling time from Cupar. Alexanders
 operate 2 service routes in our area  
 but as the figures show the frequency 
 is a bit patchy, especially at        
 weekends. For instance on the Cupar to
 Auchtermuchty road, the main link to  
 the Forth Road Bridge, there are 12   
 buses each week day,8 on Saturday     
 and 4 on Sunday. On the Cupar to      
 Newburgh route, the main road to Perth
 and beyond, there are only 6 buses    
 each weekday,5 on Saturday and none on
 Sunday. As you can see it is as well  
 local people have their own           
 independent means of transport.
