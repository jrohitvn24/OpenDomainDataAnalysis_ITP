		<content> Although the greatest emphasis in this
 area is the cultivation of barley,    
 there is also considerable livestock  
 farming. There is relatively little   
 rough grazing land here , but a       
 considerable acreage is sown under    
 grass for grazing beef and dairy      
 cattle.                               
 The main breed of dairy cattle found  
 in the area is the{Friesian,}with a   
 few{Ayrshires}and  a selection of     
{Friesian crosses.}There is also a     
 growing number of{Charolais}bulls and 
 cows being kept in south Fife. These  
 cattle, first introduced to Britain in
 1961, are being kept in their own     
 right and also for cross breeding with
 Friesian cows to produce more         
 'efficient' cattle. There are no sheep
 currently kept in this block.
