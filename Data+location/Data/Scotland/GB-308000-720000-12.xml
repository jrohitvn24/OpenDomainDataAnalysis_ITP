		<title>12Perth Highland Games.</title>
		<content>  The{South Inch}was the setting, and  
 from early morning{bagpipes}could be  
 heard over{Perth}as solitary pipers   
 and kilted bandsmen practised for the 
{competitions}later in the day.        
{ Tourists}from all over the{world}were
 thrilled to see{tartan kilts}swinging 
 as massed{pipe bands}marched by, and  
 cameras clicked continuously as lithe 
{Highland dancers,}from as far away as 
{Canada and Australia,}competed against
 their Scots counterparts. There were  
 pipe bands from{thirty two countries  
 including Denmark, Holland and far off
 Queensland.The last won their section.
  Visitors' eyes  widened as they saw  
{cabers}tossed,{hammers}thrown, 56lb.  
{weights}clearing{high bars.}It was all
 there.{Huge crowds}had a great day.   
  An added bonus was that in one of the
{wettest summers}on record, on Sunday  
 11th August 1985, it stayed{dry.      </content>
