		<title>14Girls' games,Balornock</title>
		<content> I am an eleven year old girl and I    
 live in Balornock which is in the     
 North side of Glasgow.I attend        
 Knockburn Primary School.The children 
 in our school play lots of different  
 games like balls,ropes and Chinese    
 Ropes.My favourite game is{Chinese    
{Ropes}and this is how you play.You    
 need about thirty elastic bands which 
 you tie together into one big rope.You
 need two people to hold the rope out  
 straight.These people are called      
 "enders".The rest of the people       
 playing have to jump the rope.The rope
 is held at different heights by the   
 enders.They start by holding the rope 
 at their ankles and then they go up   
 gradually to knee,thigh,waist,shoulder
 etc until the rope is above their     
 heads.At each change of height the    
 jumpers jump the rope.If they cannot  
 jump one height they must take an end.</content>
