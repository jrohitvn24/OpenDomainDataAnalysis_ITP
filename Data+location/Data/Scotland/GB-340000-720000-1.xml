		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO BALMULLO</title>
		<content> Welcome to Balmullo!   The pupils of  
 P.4 and P.5 have great pleasure in    
 introducing you to our village and its
 surrounding agricultural land.        
                                       
 Balmullo, which is in North East Fife,
 is the only village in the area       
 we have studied.   The name "Balmullo"
 probably means "the town under the    
 headland".   The nearest towns are    
 Cupar and St Andrews, both about 6    
 miles away, while about 7 miles to the
 north, across the River Tay is the    
 city of Dundee.                       
                                       
 We have gathered the information for  
 the project in several ways.   We have
 been out and about to look at the     
 area, interviewed local inhabitants   
 and issued questionnaires.  We would  
 like to thank all the people who      
 helped us.                            </content>
