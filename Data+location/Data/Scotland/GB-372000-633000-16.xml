 Kelso have a very good rugby team. In 
 the team there are four players who   
 have played for Scotland. They are my 
 uncle, Eric Paxton, John Jeffery, Gary
 Callander,and Roger Baird. Kelso is   
 one of the best rugby teams in the    
 Borders. Kelso RFC play at{Poynder

 for spectators, a clubhouse where     
 players and members can relax, and    
 floodlights. Kelso have played very   
 well this season. They have won       
 several{Sevens Tournaments.}They have 
 won the Hawick Sevens, Gala Sevens and
 the Melrose Sevens which is the oldest
