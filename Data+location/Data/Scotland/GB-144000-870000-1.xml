		<content> FLODIGARRY VILLAGE AND ENVIRONS       
 The area has a mountain ridge with    
 foothills and flat moorland leading to
 the sea. There is a stretch of cliff  
 in the northern section.              
 The crofting village, called          
 Flodigarry, one larger and a smaller  
 part half-a-mile furthersouth,        
 is grouped on a slope facing the sea. 
 there is a large land-slip which just 
 clears the village. The ground is sub 
 -siding from the moorland to the sea. 
 Overlooking the village is the Hotel  
 and its annexe facing south-east. The 
 fourteen inhabited houses are all     
 detached mostly white-washed,         
 two-storey, traditional buildings     
 facing the sea. The newer houses are  
 bungalow-styled but blend well with   
 the others.                           
 The views of hills, sea, mountain and 
 moorland are very beautiful.          </content>
