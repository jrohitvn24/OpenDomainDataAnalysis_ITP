		<title>14The River Dee</title>
		<content> The River Dee runs through our block. 
 It is famous for its salmon fishing   
 and its royal connections.There are   
 lots of small streams that join the   
 Dee in our block.The river runs down  
 to Aberdeen and into the North Sea.   
 Aberdeen gets its name from the River 
 Dee as the word "aber" means "mouth", 
 so Aberdeen means,"The mouth of the   
 River Dee".The river starts up in the 
 Cairngorm Mountains.It runs from west 
 to east through our block and is quite
 wide.It has a lot of stones in its bed
 and banks and varies from quite deep  
 to very shallow.It is not too fast    
 flowing except in spate.Many people   
 pay a lot of money to fish for salmon 
 on the Dee.Poaching is a problem.The  
 Dee is very clear and clean and is    
 good for wildlife,including otters and
 kingfishers.Many people use it for    
 leisure and it supplies all our water.</content>
