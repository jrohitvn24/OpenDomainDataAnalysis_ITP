		<content>    Before 1941 there were 2 Church of 
 Scotland churches in Cardross. In 1941
 Cardross Parish Church was bombed. The
 Burns Church, built in 1844 through   
 the generosity of Mr. Burns, became   
 the only C of S church in Cardross.   
    The money granted by the government
 after the war was used to build a     
 complex of church halls. There is also
 a small Roman Catholic chapel called  
 St.Mayhew. There has been a chapel on 
 this site for hundreds of years.      
    The Burns church, now known as the 
 Parish Church, plays an important role
 in village life. It is the centre for 
 most of the activities and it is the  
 unit which binds the people together.
