      HOW TO PLAY QUEENIE QUEENIE WHO'S
 GOT THE BALL.                         
   One person turns round and the other
 people stand in a line and the person 
 who's got the ball throws it behind   
 their back and somebody in the line   
 catches the ball.They all put their   
 hands behind their backs and the      
 person who threw the ball turns round 
 and says"Queenie Queenie who's got the
 ball. Is she tall or is she small or  
 is she like a cannonball."            
   Then the person tries to guess who's
 got the ball.If they are right the    
 person who has the ball is "it" and if
 he is wrong he is "it" again.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
