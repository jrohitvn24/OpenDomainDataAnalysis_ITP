		<content> There is no formal provision for      
 Nursery Education &amp; no Playgroup in   
 Deanston but children can attend the  
 latter in Doune or Thornhill.         
 Primary pupils from Deanston attend a 
 village school which was once provided
 by the Cotton Mill owners. Now it is a
 L.E.A. 2-teacher school with 39 pupils
 It has visiting specialist staff for  
 P.E./Music/Needlework/Remedial Studies
 The children of the Rural area travel 
 to either Doune or Thornhill for      
 Primary education.                    
 When they reach Secondary School age  
 all the pupils travel by bus to       
 McLaren High School in Callander. This
 school has 750 pupils aged from 11\   
 to 18 years and has a catchment area  
 of 16 small feeder schools.           
 A good percentage of the pupils go on 
 to Further Education at Universities  
 or Colleges throughout the U.K.       </content>
