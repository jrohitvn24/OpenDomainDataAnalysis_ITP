		<title>20SOCIAL CONCERNS OF SANDHEAD</title>
		<content> One must be in common with all rural  
 areas in expressing the worries of    
 lack of job prospects; constant       
 depopulation - especially of younger  
 elements; increasing numbers of old   
 people choosing the peace and quiet of
 the country; lack of transport; high  
 cost of living - especially such      
 essentials as fuels for home and cars;
 and educational policies which do not 
 support the smaller schools and their 
 children, who have much longer days   
 because of the distances they have to 
 travel. In closing this last page I   
 would say that despite the rather long
 list of worries, Sandhead and its     
 environs - with its people, young AND 
 old, is a wonderful place to live and 
 work and it gives one so much pleasure
 that it is only when given the task of
 thinking about it that one realises   
 what one has to worry about!          </content>
