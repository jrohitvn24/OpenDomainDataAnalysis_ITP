		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY</title>
		<content>      The 12km. square is predominantly
 rural in character, with the land     
 being used for the growing of barley, 
 oats or grass for silage or rough     
 grazing for cattle and sheep.         
    There are only two residential     
 areas in it, namely, the private      
 housing estates{LOCHARDIL}and{HOLM,}  
 but they are extending and some of the
 farmland will disappear over the next 
 few years as other housing estates    
 take over.                            
    To the west, the{RIVER NESS}and{   
 the{CALEDONIAN CANAL}run through the  
 area with a few beautiful houses      
 bordering them. To the south and east 
 the ground rises fairly swiftly and is
 dotted by many different types of     
 farms.                                
    It is an area which is now         
 undergoing changes which will, in the 
 next 10 years change its character.   </content>
