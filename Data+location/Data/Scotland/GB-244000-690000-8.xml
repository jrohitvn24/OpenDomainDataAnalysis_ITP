		<content> In this community (which covers the   
 parish of Buchanan ) there are lots of
 activities, fishing,sailing,bingo,    
 curling and bowls.                    
{Fishing}is a popular activity. Only a 
 couple of people go fishing.          
{Sailing}is another popular activity.  
 There are a lot of young people in the
 Milton who sail.                      
{Bingo}is held in a hall in Drymen.    
 Adults and children go as it is a     
 family night out. The bingo is only   
 held once a month in the winter time. 
{Curling}goes on in the winter (when   
 there is a frozen pond in the Drymen  
 show field). There is a trophy to be  
 won every 12 months.                  
{Bowls}takes place in the Memorial Hall
 beside Buchanan primary school.
