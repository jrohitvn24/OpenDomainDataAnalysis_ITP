		<title>11BRIDGE OF WEIR - CONCERNS</title>
		<content>  Today people are concerned about a   
 number of important things. Firstly   
 everyone complains about the way      
{prices are going up,}especially       
 petrol.{Wages do not buy as much}as   
 they used to. Also{unemployment is    
{getting worse}everywhere, and people  
 worry about their jobs.               
  Parents are most concerned about     
 violence. Most will not allow their   
 children to wander after dark.        
{Football hooliganism}is often reported
 in the news. Some people think that   
 there is{too much violence}on         
 television and it is encouraging young
 people to cause trouble.              
{ The belt was banned in schools}but   
 now many people are worried about     
 discipline.{Should the belt be brought
{back ?}Many of them think so. Perhaps 
 that would help the problem of        
 violence.                             </content>
