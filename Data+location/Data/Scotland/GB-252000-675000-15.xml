		<content>{Craigton Sunday School}is held in the 
 school most Sundays.The teacher is    
 called Miss Fleming.Five children     
 go to it.Some years at end of term, it
 visits Cairns Church in Milngavie.    
 The Sunday School has been  going for 
 a long time.My dad and his brothers   
 went to it as boys.                   
  {The Preaching Brae}is to be found on
 Barloch Moor in Milngavie.It was used 
 long ago by people worshipping God out
 of doors.These people had quarrelled  
 with their own church and had no      
 where to meet.                        
 It is a natural amphitheatre on a     
 small hill.Recently a proper stone    
 platform has been built. A service is 
 held every year on the Sunday of      
 Milgavie Gala Week and people from all
 the churches are invited.
