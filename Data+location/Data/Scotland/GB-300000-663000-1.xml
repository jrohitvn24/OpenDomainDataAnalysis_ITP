 its name to the surrounding district, 
 including Polbeth and Harburn,the

 building. On the drove road used to   
 take cattle to market West Calder was 
 a stopping place for drovers over the 
 centuries which preceded the building 
 of the railway.In the eighteen -

 hurriedly erected for the incoming
