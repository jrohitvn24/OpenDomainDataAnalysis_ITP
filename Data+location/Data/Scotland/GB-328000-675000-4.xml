{       THE CAT AND DOG HOME           
  Just a short distance from the       
 school is Seafield Cat and Dog Home.  
 If a cat or a dog gets lost and       
 the Police find it they take it to the
 Cat and Dog Home and then it is put   
 into a cage.                          
 If the owner does not come for it at a
 certain time the cat or dog can be    
 sold to someone else.If nobody wants  
 it it will be put down.The Cat and Dog
 Home is near the links.               
 It is the only one in Edinburgh.People
 go to the Cat and Dog Home sometimes  
 if they dont want their cat or dog.   
 Some people don't take their pet to   
 the Cat and Dog Home they just let it 
 run wild in the street and eat out of 
 the rubbish bins in the street.
