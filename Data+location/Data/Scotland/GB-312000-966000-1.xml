		<title>01THE MOUNT PLEASANT BLOCK</title>
		<content>   The 4km x 3km block covered by{Mount
{Pleasant School, Thurso}is mainly     
 grazing and arable land. It does      
 include the school's own catchment    
 area of the town of{Thurso.           
   The part of{Thurso}in the block     
 contains a number of interesting      
 features including{Old St. Peter's    
{Church,}the river estuary, the        
 harbour, a brickworks, a large        
 furniture shop, a number of small     
 business concerns and a relatively new
 council housing estate.               
   The farmland is largely flat and    
 open with almost no tree cover except 
 Lady Janet's Wood near{Thurso Castle.}
 The little high ground that there is  
 in the block provides a view point    
 over the whole area and across the    
{Pentland Firth}to Orkney.             
   On the southern edge of the block   
 are Caithness flagstone quarries.     </content>
