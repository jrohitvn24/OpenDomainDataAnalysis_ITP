		<content> My name is Caroline Murphy and I live 
 at  Hermitage Crescent. I really like 
 living here because I have quite a lot
 of friends. We hardly ever fall out,  
 and all our parents are friends and   
 they hardly fall out either.          
                                       
 In our Crescent there is a big round  
 grass lawn. It is brilliant for       
 playing football, rugby, cricket and  
 to make up a BMX cycle course. It is  
 wonderful in winter, when it snows    
 heavily, to have snowball fights. But 
 the best thing about playing here is  
 that only one or two cars come in     
 each day.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
