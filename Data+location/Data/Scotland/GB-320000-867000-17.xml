		<title>17COULARDBANK ESTATE LOSSIE</title>
		<content>   The Coulardbank Estate was built in 
 the 1980s. It is a council estate     
 which includes 40 RAF houses.The land 
 that the houses are built on is badly 
 drained and some houses have a        
 problem with dampness. Some people    
 have had to move out because of it.   
   A main road goes round the estate   
 and all the houses are in groups off  
 the main road. These streets are all  
 on the Coulardbank estate: Bailey     
 Place, Rockall Place, Fairisle Place, 
 Forties Place, and Cromarty Place are 
 all shipping areas, Shackleton Place  
 is named after the RAF plane.         
   A lot of playspace is provided in   
 the estate with play equipment. There 
 are few other facilities and no       
 garages, although there are big       
 carparks. The bus service has been    
 improved with 6 stops in Coulardbank.
