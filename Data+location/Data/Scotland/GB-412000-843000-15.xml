		<title>15HERRING INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> In 1910 there was a boom in the       
 herring industry just before the First
 World War. The boats used were called 
 Zulus, Scaffies and Fyfies-all types  
 of drifters which had nets which hung 
 down like curtains into the water.The 
 fishing boats  were first powered by  
 steam.The boats went out, caught the  
 fish and then landed their catch      
 because the fish didn't keep          
 long.Gutters worked in the market from
 6 in the morning till late at night,  
 earning poor wages.After the fish were
 gutted, they were rinsed and soaked   
 with salt. A cooper came and checked  
 the barrels then the lids were put on 
 and stamped.After all the barrels were
 packed they were exported all over the
 world but mainly to Russia.
