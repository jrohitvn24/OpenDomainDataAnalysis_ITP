		<title>15The Dams</title>
		<content> Carron Ironworks was the biggest{     
{industry} in the area. It is now in   
 the hands of the receiver who is      
 selling the buildings, but as yet has 
 not been able to sell the area known  
 as the Dams -a large{lake}or resevoir 
 of water used by the company. "In the 
 lake there are two swans who have     
 cygnets. The reeds are black. There is
 plenty of space to explore round and  
 plenty of animals for the nature      
 lover. There are little pools with    
 fish in them where Carron Works dumped
 their slag to the south of the Dams.  
 There are lots of rabbit warrens      
 there, and lots of trees and bushes.  
 It would make a good{nature reserve}  
 ."It is already a good nature reserve 
 -though, when the Dams were drained   
 and the lake reduced in size, the     
 balance of wildlife changed as the    
{environment}became marshy.            </content>
