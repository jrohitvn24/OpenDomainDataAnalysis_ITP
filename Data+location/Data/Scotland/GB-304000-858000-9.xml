		<title>09INDUSTRIES-FORRES EAST</title>
		<content> There are not many industries in the  
 East of Forres. There are no          
 manufacturers at all in this area.    
 However, there is a lot of            
 Horticulture (fields, crops, ploughed 
 land). There is a quarry where they   
 dig up stones from the ground for     
 building roads.                       
                                       
 There is a service station which sells
 fuel for cars and lorries and they    
 also have a car-wash, and a little    
 shop that sells confectionery. The    
 Garden Centre occupies a large area of
 land at Bogton. They sell seeds,      
 house-plants and trees. It has a large
 tree display and attractive           
 surroundings.                         
                                       
 There is also a sewage works in the   
 area which copes with all the waste   
 from Forres and surrounding area.     </content>
