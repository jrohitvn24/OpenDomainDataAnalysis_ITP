		<title>18SKENE ESTATE (CONTINUED)</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Estate was passed to a daughter,  
{Lady Jane Hamilton}since there was no 
 son to inherit the title.She was      
 married to Captain Farquharson;he was 
 wealthy and owned considerable land in
 the area.They never occupied Skene    
 House.Captain Farquharson has never   
 owned the Estate but is held in trust 
 for the Hamiltons.The present Lady    
 Hamilton has just died,June 1985,and  
 so the house and lands will pass to   
 her two daughters.                    
 Since World War II,the Estate has been
 slowly broken up due to the lack of   
 money.The farms on the Estate were    
 sold to the sitting tenants;those men 
 who originally farmed the land for the
 Laird.{Skene House}has not been       
 maintained and is now derelict;even   
 the gardens are now used for farming.
