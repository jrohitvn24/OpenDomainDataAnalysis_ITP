		<content>{BROOMHOUSE NURSERY} is owned by       
 Glasgow District Council. It supplies 
 plants and flowers to the city.       
 Plants from Broomhouse are used in    
 National Competitions.  This year our 
 exhibit "A Dear Green Place" won a    
 silver gilt at Chelsea Flower Show.   
 Last year they swept the prizes at    
 Liverpool Show.  They hope to host a  
 national show from the new Exhibition 
 Centre at Finnieston in 1987.         
{DALDOWIE GARDEN CENTRE} is run by     
 Strathclyde Region.   Opened in 1973, 
 it supplies trees, shrubs and plants  
 to the region. 70 employees maintain  
 gardens and playing fields of the     
 region.  Mr Reid, the manager, sees as
 his aim the provision of plants and   
 flowers to less advantaged areas of   
 the region.
