		<content> Although now a suburb of Dundee,      
 Broughty Ferry still retains much     
 of its individual character. It is an 
 important part of Tayside Region's    
 many attractions. Situated four miles 
 east of the City Centre, it still     
 shows many signs of its origins as a  
 fishing village clustered close to the
 Tay.                                  
   In the past a ferry operated for    
 many years between Broughty Ferry     
 Castle and Tayport on the Fife bank of
 the Tay.During the 19th Century,      
 Broughty Ferry, then an independent   
 burgh, became the favoured residential
 area of many of the Dundee business   
 men who prospered with the development
 of the Jute trade both here and in    
 India. Many of their fine houses are  
 still to be seen, some now converted  
 to hotels, Institutions and flats.
