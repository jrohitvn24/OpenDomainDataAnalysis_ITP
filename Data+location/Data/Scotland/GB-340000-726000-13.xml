		<content>   92% of the traffic passing through  
 the area consists of cars or light    
 goods vehicles. Only a small          
 proportion consists of; buses, heavy  
 goods vehicles and motor cycles. The  
 majority of the population travel to  
 work by car. A breakdown of the       
 transport used follows; Car pool 4.7%,
 Car passenger 6.5%, Car driver 52.3%, 
 Bus 14.1%, Train 1.2%, Motor cycle    
 2.1%, Pedal cycle 3.5%, Foot 8.2%,    
 Works at home 4.1%, Others 2.3%.      
   Although the railway passes the     
 area, the lack of a halt prohibits use
 of trains as a means of transport.    
   Children are transported to         
 secondary school by bus and children  
 who live in rural areas come to       
 primary school by mini-bus. A regular 
 bus service runs through the area.    
   Cycling is cheapest, as there is no 
 toll to pay on the Tay Bridge.        </content>
