		<title>05Beef farming in Evie</title>
		<content>   Beef is the main farming enterprise.
 The stock is mostly cross-cows bred   
 with Charolais or Simmental bulls.    
 Some Hereford and Aberdeen Angus bulls
 are also used.                        
   Steadings tend to be larger in      
 proportion to acreage when compared to
 the Scottish mainland.  This is due to
 the long winter keep from November    
 until May.  Tied byres are becoming   
 less common and most of the cattle    
 sheds being built are cubicles or     
 slats.  Sloped floor byres are        
 particularily suited to Orkney which  
 has limited straw for bedding.        
   Most farms have their cows calving  
 in the spring. Calves are suckled over
 the summer and weaned when the cattle 
 come in.  They are then fed until 18  
 months to 2 years when they are sold  
 for beef at the Kirkwall Mart,        
 Stromness Mart or abattoir in Kirkwall</content>
