            ****                       
                                       
 This block of squares is mostly wood  
 and land.  There are no shops or      
 schools.  There is about 8 or 9 farms 
 at the most.  So the rest of the land 
 is fields.  Also there is dissused    
 quarries.  There are reservoirs which 
 are covered with soil.  There is not  
 much to do in the country but round   
 the coast there are towns and villages
 which have castles and caves to look  
 at.  If you took the A92 road, this   
 takes you to the villages.  We try to 
 keep Fife as tidy as we can for       
 tourists to recommend our country.    
 We hope you like the sights you see on
 your travels.
