  The stags battle to defend herds in  
 September. They can reach 4 feet      
 and can weigh up to 250 pounds.       
  The summer coat is reddish brown  and
 in the winter it is a grey brown .    
 When the calves are born they can be  
 spotted by foxes or birds of prey.    
 They are covered with spots for       
 camouflage.Soon calves can run and    
 then they go and join the herd and    
 their spots soon disappear.           
  Lots of red deer come down from the  
 hills to graze in our area in winter. 
{Pine marten

 common but is now one of Britain's    
 rarest animals.They eat birds,voles,  
 mice and other kinds of animals       
 including insects.

 marten and others have been seen here.</content>
