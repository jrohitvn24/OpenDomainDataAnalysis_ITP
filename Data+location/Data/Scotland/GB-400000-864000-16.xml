		<content> Recollections of Elizabeth Downie,    
 born l905 and Jane Craig, born l925:-.
 l905: Steam drifters went out to sea  
 at midnight on Sunday. The curers were
 waiting at the market at the break of 
 dawn to buy the catch brought in. The 
 herrings  were sold by the cran.Prices
 varied according to the size of the   
 herring. The women were ready to gut  
 and pack the barrels which  were made 
 by the coopers. The Russians were one 
 0f the best buyers. There was plenty  
 of work for the women as they         
 travelled with the boats. l925:The    
 houses were old fashioned but clean.It
 was better then because you were more 
 contented.There were only horses and  
 carts.The clothes weren't fashionable 
 and mostly dark colours.The shops were
 mostly small.The school was strict and
 hard.There were few jobs for girls.   
 Diseases: Scarlet Fever &amp; Diptheria.  </content>
