 In the morning the boy wakened by his 
 electric alarm clock went into the    
 bathroom, washed and used an electric 
 toothbrush.  He got changed and       
 listened to his radio.                
 A teasmade had already made tea for   
 him and mum has made taost in the     
 electric toaster and cooked eggs in   
 the Microwave (ultrafast).            
 Dad has a radio telephone to contact  
 people directly from his car..........
 At school the boy used a computer. He 
 did baking in the afternoon.          
 After school he played on his own     
 computer and watched television.      
 After tea he played with mini arcade  
 games before going to bed.
