		<title>15LUNAN AREA, CLIMATE.</title>
		<content> 1\The weather in this area is usually 
 drier than in other parts of Scotland,
 we also enjoy many hours of sunshine  
 even in th winter months. The         
 temperatures are very rarely          
 high,probably this area is slightly   
 colder than the west coast of         
 Scotland. However the summer of 1985  
 has been a particularly wet one, the  
 wettest in this area for 200 years. As
 can be imagined the farmers have      
 suffered greatly and so far it looks  
 as if this harvest will be            
 disastrous. It is now early October   
 and some fields of grain are still not
 harvested, the protein peas which     
 should be harvested dry are so wet    
 that some farmers are considering     
 ploughing them in. The schoolchildren 
 are now on their autumn break, when   
 many help with the potato picking, but
 due to rain,few tatties are harvested.</content>
