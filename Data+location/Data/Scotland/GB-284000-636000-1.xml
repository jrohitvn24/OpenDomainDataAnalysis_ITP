		<content> The village of Douglas Water lies in  
 the valley of the stream of the same. 
 The farms on the lower slopes of the  
 valley are mainly dairy farms,although
 some are rearing cattle for beef. The 
 crops grown are mainly grass and      
 fodder. The higher ground is used as  
 rough pasture for sheep grazing and   
 hill cattle. As the ground becomes    
 higher, some of the rough moorland has
 been planted with young trees. The    
 damp peaty soil of some of the        
 moorland encourages bird and plant    
 life. Apart from derelict spaces of   
 the old miners rows and railway       
 station, the village itself consists  
 of some council houses, a few private 
 houses, a hall a public house and a   
 school.  A mobile welding company, a  
 glazier, a plant hire, and a local    
 coach hire business have bases in     
 Douglas Water.                        </content>
