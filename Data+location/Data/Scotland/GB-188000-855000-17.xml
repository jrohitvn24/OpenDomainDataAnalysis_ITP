		<title>17The pier,Torridon</title>
		<content> There is a small jetty at Torridon    
 that is used for small boats to dock  
 and anchor. These are chiefly small   
 sailing yachts,dinghies,rowing boats  
 and cabin cruisers,which are owned    
 both by local people and visitors.The 
 small boats of the local static gear  
 fishermen also come in here.          
 Local people collect edible winkles;  
 these are left at the pier for the    
 buyers to collect by lorry. Once      
 gathered the winkles are left in open 
 mesh bags below high tide line as they
 must be covered with sea water at     
 intervals to keep them alive.There are
 no houses beyond the jetty;Vehicles   
 use it as a turning place as the road 
 is narrow,single track.There are fords
 marked on the map,but these are not   
 used much now as the road bridges them
 However,the line and crossing places  
 of these fords can still be seen.     </content>
