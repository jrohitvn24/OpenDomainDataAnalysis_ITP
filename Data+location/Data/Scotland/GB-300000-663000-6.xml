		<content>  The one part of West Calder everyone 
 remembers is the Co-operative         
 Society,who were the ones that gave an
 electricity generating plant and      
 street lights to West Calder.The      
 president of this company is Robert   
 W.Rankine who has seen all the changes
 in recent times.The most important of 
 all was shale mining and the 5        
 sisters,which are made of shale.Shale 
 mining stopped about 22 years ago and 
 to make the 5 sisters a lot of men    
 worked very hard.The 5 sisters are    
 really only the shale that was dug up 
 from the mine and not used.Now in West
 Calder since shale mining is exhausted
 we use North Sea oil  which started   
 about 10 years ago.Only a couple of   
 shale miners are left in our community
 but they will soon be gone.
