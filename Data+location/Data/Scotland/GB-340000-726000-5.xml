		<title>05The Tay Bridges</title>
		<content>   The principal features in this area 
 and immediately to the west of this   
 block are the road and rail bridges   
 across the River Tay to the city of   
 Dundee.                               
   The road bridge, which is a toll    
 bridge despite objections, carries    
 water gas and telephone wires from    
 Dundee to Newport. It is sometimes    
 damaged in winter by ice floating     
 downstream.                           
   Before the bridges were built there 
 were ferries going across the Tay.    
 That was mainly why Newport was       
 developed in the first place.         
   There used to be a rail halt at the 
 side of the rail bridge but it has    
 been knocked down. There are proposals
 for a new one but it isn't likely to  
 be built.
