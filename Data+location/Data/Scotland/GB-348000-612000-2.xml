 luxury knitwear and, over the years,  
 firms such as Pringle of Scotland,    
 Lyle and Scott, and others, have      
 created a worldwide reputation for    
 their quality garments.               
                                       
 In terms of new industry, Hawick has  
 established a diverse range of small  
 and medium companies which are        
 producing such varied products as     
 road-sweeping vehicles, timber-framed 
 houses and aluminium doors and        
 windows.                              
                                       
 Many old buildings have been          
 tastefully renovated to house new     
 industry and, in addition, modern     
 factories have been built on the      
 outskirts of the town. Lastly, Hawick
