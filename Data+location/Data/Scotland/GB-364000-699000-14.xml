		<title>14Ecology - Migrating Birds</title>
		<content> In addition to observing the birds the
 Obervatory is also a base for ringing 
 birds. Most of the birds ringed at the
 observatory are quite common, but the 
 grand total of species recorded mounts
 steadily, and now stands at 238. A    
 total of 250 species by the end of the
 century is by no means improbable.    
 Each recovery of a ringed bird, alive 
 or dead, adds a little more to our    
 knowledge of the annual movements of  
 that particular species, for every    
 ring has a number which is unique to  
 that individual bird.                 
 Three "heligoland" traps have been    
 built on the island. These are        
 effectively large open mouthed funnels
 of wire netting, narrowing down to a  
 catching box. When ringing is taking  
 place bird are encouraged down it.    
 They are then taken out identified,   
 weighed,measured and ringed.          </content>
