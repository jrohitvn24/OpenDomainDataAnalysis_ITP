		<title>17THE ECUMENICAL CHURCH.</title>
		<content>   The Church in Knightsridge is part  
 of the Ecumenical Parish in the new   
 town of Livingston. The members of    
 four Protestant faiths meet and       
 worship together. These are the Church
 of Scotland, the Congregational Union,
 the Methodists and the Episcopal      
 Church in  Scotland.                  
   The Church in Knightsridge, as yet, 
 does not have a building of its own.  
 They meet every Sunday in the main    
 hall of Knightsridge Primary school to
 worship together. The Sunday School   
 also use rooms in the school. The     
 minister is also the minister to the  
 congregation at Carmondean, a         
 neighbouring area.
