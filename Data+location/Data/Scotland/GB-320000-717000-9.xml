		<title>09Newburgh Annual Pageant</title>
		<content>    Annually in Newburgh a Pageant is  
 held. A group of people come and ask  
 for Volunteers to perform. There is a 
 different theme every year one year it
 was the Jungle Book and last year 1984
 it was King Arthur and the Knights of 
 the Round Table. There is usually a   
 big turn out of people wanting to join
 but it's not only children that join, 
 some adults join too. The adults have 
 the big parts and the children  take  
 on the smaller parts. If you do not   
 like the idea of taking part in the   
 Pageant you can always help to make   
 costumes and props. The Pageant is    
 held in the ruins of Lindores Abbey.  
 There are two nights for the Pageant, 
 one night is for old age pensioners   
 only. The next night is for anyone.   
 The performers usually parade down the
 High Street before going down to the  
 Abbey.                                </content>
