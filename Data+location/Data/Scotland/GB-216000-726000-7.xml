		<content>  People visiting our village often    
 say,"But what do you do in the winter 
 ?" It is true that most of the        
 population are involved in some way   
 with the tourist industry but we do   
 have our own lives to lead! Much of   
 the winter season is spent preparing  
 for the influx of Summer visitors such
 as painting, decorating adapting      
 buildings. However socially many clubs
 and evening activities begin when the 
 visitors leave. In this village       
 badminton,bowls,darts,tennis are just 
 some of the activities which occupy   
 us. The local Hotel has a bar which is
 open all year round for locals and    
 Discos are often held in church halls 
 or hotels  for the younger adults.    
 Often these events involve a lot of   
 travelling for the participants, this 
 is something one gets used to living  
 in a rural area.                      </content>
