  Following the re-organisation of     
 Local Government, the Community       
 Council was formed in 1977 to take the
 place of the Parish Council.It acts as
 a link between the public and the     
 District &amp; Regional Councils,having no
 power of its own.It comprises six     
 members elected by the community it   
 serves;the officials are the Chairman,
 Secretary and Treasurer.Meetings are  
 held in the Kirk Hall for 7 months of 
 the year,in Greenloaning School in    
 June &amp; January &amp; in Braco Hall for the
 A.G.M.normally on the first Monday of 
 the month.                            
  Close contact is maintained with     
 District &amp; Regional officials with    
 responsibility for services in the    
 area, and they have been helpful in   
 dealing with problems brought to their
 notice by members of the community.   </content>
