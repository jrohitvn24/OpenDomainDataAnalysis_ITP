		<title>02RECREATION IN KIP VALLEY</title>
		<content> The recreational facilities are mainly
 found in 3 areas: IBM factory,        
 Greenock High School - youth club &amp;   
 swimming pool (open to public once a  
 week) and Invekip village.  In the IBM
 there is an outdoor bowling club,     
 social and sports clubs and a creche  
 for members.  There is a library,     
 public park and a large marina.       
 As you can judge from the information,
 Inverkip has more facilities than the 
 private housing estate at Flatterton, 
 so in Inverkip the people interviewed 
 were satisfied with the facilities but
 in Greenock they are said to be       
 unsatisfactory. Greenock people       
 interviewed suggested that more play  
 areas for children and more places    
 like community centres etc, to keep   
 children off the streets, should be   
 built in their area.
