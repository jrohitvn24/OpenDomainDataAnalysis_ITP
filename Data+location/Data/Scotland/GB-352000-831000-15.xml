 its own entertainment as a very       
 self-sufficient Community Club is run 
 on all weekday evenings (except       
 Thursdays) in the autumn/winter and   
 spring terms in this school. Community
 Club activities include badminton,    
 bowls and table-tennis.               
 Thursdays are the nights (once a      
 month) when the Women's Rural         
 Institute meets.The other Thursdays   
 are free for the use of school or any 
 who may apply.                        
 The P.T.A.,a Brownie Pack,and a       
 pre-school group also meet regularly  
 in the school.
