		<title>07The Ayrshire Post.</title>
		<content>   The Post has been Ayr's local       
{newspaper}for 106 years.  With a      
 readership of 120000 it is Scotland's 
 largest provincial paper and is part  
 of a large national group of papers.  
 This however has no bearing on        
 editorial freedom and the paper will  
 print any story of local interest.    
 The most important issue carried this 
 year concerns the M.O.D's plans to    
 build a signals installation in the   
{Galloway Hills.} The complex will     
 cover many square miles and will      
 deprive S.W. Scotland one of our last 
 areas of{outstanding natural beauty.  
 The Post is campaigning to halt the   
 project.  A local journalist feels    
 more responsibility to his readership 
 than a reporter with a national paper.
   The Post's circulation is rising    
 steadily _ a healthy sign for the     
 future of our most popular local paper</content>
