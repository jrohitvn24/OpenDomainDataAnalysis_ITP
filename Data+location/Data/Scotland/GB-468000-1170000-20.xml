		<title>20RELIGION IN SKERRIES</title>
		<content> Skerries has one small{Church of      
{Scotland}and services take place twice
 every Sunday one at 11:45 and one at  
 5:45.{Sunday School}is at 12:00 and   
 five women who live on Skerries take  
 turns in teaching the children who are
 aged between 3 and 12.                
    There are three{elders}and one     
 retired elder. The Rev.James Dey takes
 the services normally but the{minister
 from Whalsay, a neighbouring island   
 visits to take weddings, Commmunions, 
 Christenings. etc.                    
    Once a year we have a{Hunger Lunch 
 where people give to a Third World    
 Charity what they would spend on their
 Sunday lunch and eat only soup and    
 bread instead. Another annual event is
 the{Sunday School Picnic.}Nearly every
 able person is present. A variety of  
 races and games take place and        
 refreshments are served.              </content>
