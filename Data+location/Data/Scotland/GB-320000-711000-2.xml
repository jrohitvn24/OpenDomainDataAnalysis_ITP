		<content>   Auchtermuchty is a small town with a
 large history.Auchtermuchty means{    
{uplands of the wild boar.}The town has
 been built near the site of a{Roman   
{camp.}In the{15th century}the area    
 was thickly covered with forest.{Mary 
{Queen of Scots}and other members of   
 the{Royal Family}hunted wild boar.    
   In{1517}the town was created a{Royal
{Burgh}and in{1595 King James VI}gave  
 it a new{Charter}and included 3,000   
 acres of land.                        
   Between{1800 and 1900}the population
 was doubled due to the great increase 
 in{handloom weaving.}The Burgh was at 
 its most prosperous about 1815. In{   
{1817}all the local linen merchants    
 became bankrupt. The burgh, with debts
 of almost Â£3,000 was forced to sell   
 the Burgh lands and two mills.        
   Auchtermuchty is now administered by
{North East Fife District Council.     </content>
