		<content>   1. Fishing.                         
      The River Dee is one of Britains 
 most outstanding salmon rivers.  From 
 February of each year fishermen are   
 spread all along the banks of the     
 river.  Whilst salmon is the prize    
 fish to be caught sea trout are also  
 found in the river.  Since the 19th   
 century fishing on the Dee has been a 
 top status symbol, with the fishing   
 rights being almost all privately     
 owned. Perhaps the most famous        
 fisherperson is the Queen Mother, who 
 has a fishing cabin near Ballater.    
 2. Tourism.                           
      The fine scenery of Deeside and  
 Balmoral castle attract many visitors 
 each year.  Most of these travel on   
 the North Deeside road from Ballater  
 up to Balmoral and Braemar. They      
 usually just pass through the Coilacr-
 iech area, at most stopping for lunch.</content>
