		<content>  Going north up from the Kessock      
 Bridge,you will reach the Black Isle  
 Peninsula.The Centre is to your left. 
 From there the steps wind down to     
 North Kessock.                        
 Here is all you want to know about    
 touring the north.If you call in      
 summer you might meet a bus load of   
 people speaking German,French,Italian 
 or even Japanese.Here tourists can    
 book rooms or find out where to buy   
 craftwork.All events,like Highland    
 Games,are advertised on leaflets.You  
 can buy maps and souvenirs.           
 Seven busy ladies work here in summer 
 and three in winter.They answer 36000 
 enquiries a year.At the old Muir of   
 Ord office,before the bridge was built
 only 3000 were answered.              
 There is a big picnic area where you  
 can enjoy(or photograph)a lovely view 
 of Inverness and the Firth.           </content>
