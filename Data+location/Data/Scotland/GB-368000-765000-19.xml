		<content>    At Canterland plantation, we saw   
 roe buck territory markings and signs 
 that squirrels had been eating cones. 
 Sitka Spruce, Scots Pine and Larch are
 the main coniferous trees growing at  
 the plantation.  On the way to        
 Canterland and around our village you 
 can see many broadleaved trees like   
 Silver Birch, Copper Beech, Oak, Elm, 
 Sycamore, Rowan, Hawthorn, Willow and 
 Ash.                                  
    Not much work has to be done at    
 Canterland Forest because the trees   
 need no attention until they are ready
 to be felled in a few years' time.    
 When they are felled, they will be    
 sold to builders, to farmers for      
 fencing or will be shipped to Sweden  
 from Montrose to be pulped for the    
 paper industry.
