		<title>13OLD HOUSES IN DUNDONALD AREA</title>
		<content>  There are several different types of 
 houses in and around the village of   
 Dundonald.                            
  The oldest of the houses in the      
 village are in the Main Street and in 
 Tarbolton Road. One of them was built 
 around 1720. Another was the old Toll 
 House where people had to pay when    
 entering the village. In the garden of
 this house can be seen the remains of 
 the old weigh_bridge. These old houses
 are of historical interest and their  
 appearance cannot be changed outside, 
 though most have been modernised      
 inside.                               
  Many of the farms around the village 
 too are very old. Dankeith Farm, for  
 example, was originally the stables   
 for Dankeith House. During the war    
 members of the RAF lived there and    
 after that, monks worked the farm. The
 present owner took over in 1967.      </content>
