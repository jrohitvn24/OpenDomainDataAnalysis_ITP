		<title>13Uyeasound Playpark.</title>
		<content> The Playpark is just below the        
 school.It was built in 1984.The school
 children told the Community Council   
 what equipment they would like.       
   In the Playpark is a slide and a    
 swing which is a tyre fastened to a   
 log by four chains.The aerial slide   
 is a piece of wire with a tyre        
 fastened to it.The crow's nest is a   
 metal basket fastened to a pole with a
 rope ladder and a net to climb        
 up.There is also a rocking horse.     
   I like the swing best because you   
 can go awful high and you can bump    
 into a tyre when you go a certain way.
   There was only a rocking horse for  
 the Playgroup so they bought a set of 
 swings made up of two single swings   
 and one for two children sitting      
 opposite each other.
