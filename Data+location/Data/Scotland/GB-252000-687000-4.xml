		<title>04FIRE SERVICE IN BALFRON</title>
		<content>    Balfron{Fire Brigade}is what is    
 known as a "Retained Brigade", which  
 means that the firemen are all        
{volunteers}who have another job which 
 they do unless they are called out to 
 fight a fire. The firemen all carry a 
 pocket "Bleeper" which alerts them    
 when they are needed.                 
    In Balfron there are ten firemen   
 altogether. They meet to practise on  
 two nights in the week. They have one 
 fire-engine which they keep well      
 serviced always. They attend about{one
{hundred fires}each year, the most     
 common being grass fires and house    
 fires. Sometimes the Fire Brigade is  
 called out to car accidents, on       
 average about twenty in a year. They  
 have been known to{save}animals too, {
 for example when a kitten is stuck up 
 a tree and cannot climb down.
