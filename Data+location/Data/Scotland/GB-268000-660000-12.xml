		<title>12The Library in Viewpark</title>
		<content>            The library is in a modern 
building at one end of Viewpark. It has
over 3,500 members (1,100 junior).     
There are over 17,500 books (4,400 jun-
ior) as well as music cassettes and    
computer games to borrow. There are th-
ings on sale advertising the library. A
librarian and three assistants make    
up the staff. In a week they issue     
about 2,000 books and 150 music tapes. 
They also issue toys from the toy      
corner. There is also a resource       
centre there which the public can use  
to have printing or photocopying       
done (10p).                            
One section has reference books and    
another has leaflets telling you       
about rights and benefits. A local     
history corner has maps, photos and    
newspaper cuttings about the area.     
Some children go to get help with th-  
eir school work and are made welcome.  </content>
