 There are no shops in our block,      
 although Bonchester Bridge does have a
 Post Office and General Store,and a   
 Public House.People get the bulk of   
 their shopping in either Hawick or    
 Jedburgh,or one of the more distant   
 cities.                               
{MOBILE SHOPS}provide a valuable       
 service to the district,and a         
 grocer,butcher,and fishmonger/baker   
 deliver door-to-door once or twice a  
 week.Milk comes three times a week,   
 and coal and logs are aso available   
 from various contractors.Specialist   
 clothing and equipment suppliers visit
 farms regularly.A{BLACKSMITHS}in the  
 block  supplies many types of hardwear
 and does many agricultural repairs. A 
{GARAGE}supplies petrol and a small    
 market garden grows plants for sale in
 the open markets in nearby towns.     </content>
