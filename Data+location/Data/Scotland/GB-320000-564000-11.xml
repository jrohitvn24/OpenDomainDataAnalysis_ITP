		<title>11PLAYGROUND GAMES,ANNAN</title>
		<content> Here are some boy's playground games: 
{      SPOT              MARBLES.      
{Spot}is played with as many people as 
 possible and a football.Everyone is   
 given a number and 3 lives.In order,  
 the ball is kicked against  a wall.Any
 one missing the wall loses a life.    
 After three misses that person is out 
 of the game.The winner is the last    
 person in.                            
{Marbles}are small,coloured glass      
 balls.We play holesy and drainsy.The  
 idea is to roll your marble and your  
 opponent's into a hole or into the    
 small round holes in drains.Whoever   
 gets both marbles into the hole first 
 is the winner and keeps the marbles.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
