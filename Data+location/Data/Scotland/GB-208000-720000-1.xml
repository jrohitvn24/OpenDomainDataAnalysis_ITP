		<title>01Cladich &amp; district, Argyll</title>
		<content> Land use in this block is confined to 
 a few dwelling houses, some           
 afforestation, rough grazing, roads   
 and open ground. The area is          
 essentially isolated and whilst a main
 trunk road passes through the area few
 people spend time here. Highland      
 cattle are the permanent residents of 
 the area. The village of Cladich is   
 near one of the main North/South drove
 routes and was at one time a busy     
 junction. Today Cladich is used by    
 occasional holiday visitors seeking   
 almost total peace and quiet.  The    
 area is in general used for grazing   
 cattle and sheep. However, plantations
 of trees for commercial use are       
 gradually encroaching on the generally
 undeveloped landscape.
