		<content> My name is Graeme.I'm 11 years old.   
 This is an account of The Friday Chase
 the most important day of my year. Up 
 at 6 o'clock, change and up to the    
 ponies. Groom them for half an hour,  
 oil their feet and saddle them up.Jump
 on and off we go to the meeting       
 point.St Mary's clock strikes eight   
 and we're away round the Tower Knowe  
 and up the Howgate.At every window    
 people watch and wave.We part and the 
 married men move to the front.The     
 cornet takes his place followed by    
 unmarried men and the chase begins.   
   As I gallop up the hill I hear      
 people shouting my name but I am      
 concentrating too  hard  to look and  
 my eyes are watering in the wind.Too  
 soon the chase is over and the Cornet 
 hands the flag to the Acting Father.  
 I'd like to do it all over again but  
 my pony is tired.                     </content>
