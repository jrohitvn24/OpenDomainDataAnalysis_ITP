		<title>11Tam  O'Shanter Museum.</title>
		<content>   Ayr is the centre of the{Burns'     
 country and in the centre of Ayr is   
 the{Tam O'Shanter Museum. }It was     
 originally a dwelling house, then an  
 inn.  It was during this period that  
 the Burns connection was fostered.    
 There is no proof Burns frequented    
 this inn but as the sole remaining    
{18th century}building in Ayr it was   
 purchased by the Burns Club with the  
 intention of commemorating the poet.  
 Since its opening in 1957 many items  
 with a Burns connection have been     
 donated and each year about 8000      
 people visit.  It is from here the    
 Burns' Ride begins the journey to Brig
 O'Doon.  The ride is a re_enactment of
 the poem and an important event in    
{Burns' Festival Week}each June.       
   Plans by the District Council to    
 make structural changes and license   
 the premises are being opposed.       </content>
