		<title>20RURAL POLICING DOLPHINTON</title>
		<content> The village of Dolphintion is divided 
 into two seperate police areas. The   
 west side is covered by Strathclyde   
 Police Force and the east side by     
 Lothian and Borders. Vandalism is on  
 the increase and over the past two    
 years there have been a number of     
 housebreakings in the district. The   
 house-breaking crimes, so far         
 deteced, have been carried out by     
 persons from Edinburgh and further    
 afield. A policeman in rural areas has
 different duties to carry out from his
 colleagues in the city, such as       
 prevention and detection of           
 sheep-worrying and poaching and       
 supervision of compulsory             
 sheep-dipping. One advantage is that  
 the policeman has knowledge of most of
 the residents in the area. Law and    
 order seems to be well controlled in  
 Dolphinton in the 1980s.              </content>
