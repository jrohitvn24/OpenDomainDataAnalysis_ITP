 are the social club, the swimming     
 club, the Boys Brigade, the Girls     
 Brigade, the badminton club and the   
 Scottish Womans Rural Institute. The  
 social club is in the old school      
 building and it has such facilities as
 a pool table, darts, piano, cards,    
 dominoes and a bar. It is open four   
 days a week and occasionally provides 
 live entertainment. The Boys Brigade  
 meets in the hall on Wednesday nights.
 The Girls Brigade is in the school on 
 Wednesday nights also. The junior     
 badminton is held in the school       
 and the seniors play in the hall. The 
 S.W.R.I. is held in the hall and 17   
 women go to it. It meets once every   
 month.
