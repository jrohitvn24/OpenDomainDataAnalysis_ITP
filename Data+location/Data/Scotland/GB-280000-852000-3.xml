		<title>03LOCH OF CLANS GOLLANFIELD</title>
		<content> The  Loch of the Clans is beside      
 Bemuchlye Farm.Bonnie Prince Charlie  
 was supposed to have slept there with 
 his army before the {Battle of        
{Culloden.}                            
  The loch starts in a boggy place and 
 runs into clear water.It has started  
 to silt up  and is now very small.    
  The loch side would have been covered
 with Conifers and Scots Pine which    
 would have given Charlie and his      
 followers cover if they ever got      
 attacked in the night.                
  Now the Scots Pine is very           
 scarce.Infact the trees on the side of
 the loch are partly dying,but all is  
 not lost; the seedlings are coming    
 through   which is good news for all  
 the wildlife ;these include,osprey,   
 hawks,heron,swan,and Canadian geese.
