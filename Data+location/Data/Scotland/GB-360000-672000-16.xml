		<content>{OLD PEOPLE.}                          
 There are lots of{old people}in our   
 area.They are just like any other{old 
{people}in Britain they look back whith
 affection and think that they had a   
 better life than us.Some of them have 
 lived here all their lives some even  
 came to our school.Here is what one   
 woman said"there were dances in the   
 village hall every Saturday and we    
 cycled to the pictures which are      
 closed down now."                     
 They played games much the same as us 
 like skipping and tig they also raided
 apple trees.I think they had a happy  
 life better than ours.The{old people} 
 enjoy walks and the scenery.I think   
 the{old people}were the most          
 interesting to talk to.               
 The things they dont like are drugs   
 and vandalisim.
