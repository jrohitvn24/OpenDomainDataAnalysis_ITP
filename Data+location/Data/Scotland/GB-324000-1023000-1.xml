		<content> The block is an area of low rounded   
 hills with sizeable areas of wet,     
 boggy ground and of open loch.   The  
 east and north are intensively farmed 
 with beef cattle (wintered indoors)   
 and sheep.   Some cereals are grown as
 well as root vegetables and fodder    
 crops.   The virtual absence of trees 
 gives a very open feel to the         
 landscape.    A RSPB reserve occupies 
 a sizeable piece of the centre.   "The
 Loons", with its viewing platform     
 specializes in resident and migrating 
 water birds.   In the south is a part 
 of a seconed world airfield.   Once a 
 Royal Navy base it is now used by     
 grazing cattle.   The loch of         
 Broadhouse provide drinking water for 
 a large part of North Mainland.   A   
 pumping station on the shore pumps the
 water to a storage tank on Ravie Hill 
 whence it is distributed.             </content>
