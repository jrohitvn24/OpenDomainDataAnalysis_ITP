{FOOD :}WE RARELY EAT A COOKED         
 BREAKFAST. WE HAVE A LIGHT LUNCH AND  
 HAVE OUR MAIN MEAL IN THE EARLY       
 EVENING. WE BUY MANY KINDS OF FOOD,   
 AND FOREIGN FOOD IS NOW POPULAR       
 ESPECIALLY CHINESE, INDIAN AND        
 ITALIAN.                              
{LEISURE :}MOST LEISURE TIME IS SPENT  
 WATCHING TV. MANY FAMILIES OWN A MICRO
 COMPUTER, OFTEN USED FOR GAMES BUT    
 ALSO WITH PROGRAMMING IN MIND. READING
 IS STILL A POPULAR HOBBY AS ARE       
 GARDENING AND MUSIC.                  
{PETS :}MOST HOMES HAVE A PET, THE MOST
 COMMON BEING THE DOG. OTHER POPULAR   
 PETS ARE CATS, RODENTS, FISH, RABBITS,
 BIRDS.
