		<title>06Employment In Newburgh Area</title>
		<content> There is a limited number of jobs     
 available in this area.These include  
 the transport company of TNT,hotel    
 work at the local Hotels,The Ythan and
 The Udny Arms.There are only two shops
 in this area which provide some work  
 for the local people such as a shop   
 assistant or for younger people       
 delivering newspapers.                
 The biggest source of employment here 
 must be farming.Just about all the    
 surrounding land is taken up by       
 farming which provides jobs for local 
 people. Because Newburgh has a limited
 number of jobs about three fifths of  
 the population don't work here but    
 commute to Aberdeen,Peterhead or      
 Ellon.Also a few of the local people  
 travel to the North Sea to work with  
 the oil industry.
