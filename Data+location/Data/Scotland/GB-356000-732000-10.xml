		<title>10Caravanning in Carnoustie.</title>
		<content>                                       
  There is a caravan site in           
 Carnoustie which lots of people visit.
                                       
 Most people come because of the sea-  
 side and the beach.There are wardens  
 who look after the toilets.One lady   
 said she comes to the site because the
 toilets are the best in Scotland.     
 People say that the wardens could not 
 be more helpful than they are.A key is
 needed for the toilets so that no-one 
 writes on the wall or puts whole      
 toilet rolls down the toilet.         
                                       
   Many people feel as though they are 
 in the country-side,the area is so    
 peaceful and quiet.Walk out of your   
 caravan,through a gate and you are in 
 a park.The park is called Carnoustie  
 House Grounds.                        
                                       </content>
