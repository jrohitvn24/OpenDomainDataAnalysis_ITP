		<content> Aboyne Primary School has 230 pupils  
 and 9 teachers backed by Visiting     
 Specialist Teachers. Most children are
 resident in the village, some travel  
 by school bus.                        
 In the five hour day children are     
 involved in a variety of skills and   
 interests with principal concern for  
 reading and number skills and         
 awareness.                            
 Oil related settlement since 1975 has 
 increased the school population fron  
 170 to 230 (there was a peak of 270   
 in 1979) and in that period the native
 North East Scot representation changed
 from two-thirds to one-third.         
 From school, extra-mural and village  
 activities the children, if they chose
 to, may glean a full, educational and 
 rewarding life in a safe and pleasant 
 environment.                          
                                       </content>
