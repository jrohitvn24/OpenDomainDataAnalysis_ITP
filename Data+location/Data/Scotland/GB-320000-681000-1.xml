		<content> Cow and Calves is a small,rocky,      
 uninhabited island in the Firth of    
 Forth.                                
                                       
  It belongs to Fife Region and is in  
 the parish of Aberdour.There is a 10  
 fathom channel lying to the north of  
 the island,between Cow and Calves and 
 Oxcars,and another between Cow and    
 calves and Inchmickery.The name is    
 presumably derived from its shape.    
                                       
  At one time oyster beds were         
 exploited in the area but it is no    
 longer used by man.
