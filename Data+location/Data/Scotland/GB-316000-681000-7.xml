		<title>07Housing Dalgety Bay.</title>
		<content> Dalgety Bay was developed as a        
 residential satelite for approximately
 10000 people to ease the pressure of  
 the expansion of Edinburgh.The Moray  
 Estates Developement Company sold land
 to Housing Developers who proposed to 
 build low density quality private     
 housing. The town was originally      
 planned as an all private housing     
 development. In the early 1970's,     
 however, the Local Authority and      
 Scottish Special Housing Association  
 were approached to provide housing for
 workers in the Industrial Estate.     
 Since the initial proposals many more 
 firms have built within Dalgety Bay   
 providing a variety of homes from     
 large executive homes to small first  
 time owners bungalows and flats. All  
 the available land has since been     
 built upon, the last phase of building
 being on the shoreline.               </content>
