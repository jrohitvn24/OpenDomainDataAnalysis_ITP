		<title>20Conservation area,Murroes</title>
		<content>   The area at{Murroes Den}which       
 includes the church, doocot and castle
 has been made a conservation area by  
 Dundee district council. This means   
 that many outside repairs or cutting  
 down trees may need permission from   
 the council.                          
   The{church,}which has existed since 
 the 13th century, was gifted by       
 Gilchrist, Earl of Angus, to the Abbey
 of Arbroath, but was rebuilt in 1648  
 and again in 1848.{Murroes House or } 
{Castle}was built in the early 17th    
 century, more for comfort than        
 defence. In the den nearby is a       
{doocot,}which once provided the castle
 with pigeon meat during the winter.
