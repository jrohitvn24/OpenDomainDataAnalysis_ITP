		<content>   This is a healthy place to live and 
 few die from infectious diseases.No   
 mothers die in childbirth as all are  
 confined in a modern maternity unit in
 Dumfries. Our children are healthy,but
 the young are at risk from accidents  
 e.g.road traffic, (especially motor   
 cycles) farm machinery,power saws,etc.
   There is a high incidence of raised 
 blood pressure,leading to strokes and 
 heart attacks.Smoking, overeating, and
 alcohol are blamed.Many of the elderly
 die of cancer,and treatment has little
 effect.                               
   Due to contraception,families are   
 smaller and fewer young people work on
 farms.Retired people from the cities  
 settle here,so there are more elderly.
 This is a problem for the welfare and 
 medical services,with an increasing   
 shortage of suitable accommodation    
 when they become confused and infirm. </content>
