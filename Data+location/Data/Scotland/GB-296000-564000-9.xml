		<title>09NEW ABBEY - HOME LIFE</title>
		<content>   On an ordinary morning I would rise 
 at about 6.30am and have breakfast.   
 I would leave the house at about 7.45 
 and arrive in school at 8.45 am, after
 a journey by car and bus.             
   My favourite subjects at school are 
 Biology and History, as I like animals
 and wildlife, and learning about the  
 past. I like all of my subjects, but  
 have a lot of homework in the evening.
   After school, when I arrive home I  
 often go outside and help my father on
 the farm.  Yesterday we were putting  
 bales of silage into bags, before it  
 gets too wet. On the farm I look after
 the pigs and help to feed the calves. 
 At the moment we have about 60 pigs   
 and piglets.                          
   On Wednesdays I go to the Girl Guide
 Unit in the Guild Hall at New Abbey,  
 which I enjoy very much.              
   I usually go to bed around 9.30 pm. </content>
