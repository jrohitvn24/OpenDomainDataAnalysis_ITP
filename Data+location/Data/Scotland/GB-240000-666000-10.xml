		<title>10CONSERVATION AND PLANNING</title>
		<content> The nucleus of Houston village was    
 designated a{CONSERVATION AREA in     
 1968.                                 
 This has helped to preserve and       
 improve the picturesque quality of the
 villagescape. This is achieved by     
 detailed planning applications.Design 
 is tasteful and attempts to blend old 
 and new by using suitable materials   
 and scale,e.g.North Street features a 
 recent gap site addition which has a  
 traditional pen leading to an inner   
 courtyard with a continuity of street 
 frontage. Older buildings change their
 use,e.g.the old school is to become a 
 library and museum.                   
 Outwith the old village ,developments 
 must accord with Green Belt limits.   
 Existing trees are protected and      
 non-residential use is  opposed  to   
 retain amenity.                       
                                       </content>
