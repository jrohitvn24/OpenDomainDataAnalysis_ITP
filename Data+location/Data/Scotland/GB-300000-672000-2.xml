		<content> The survey area for Low Port Primary  
 School is a mixture of farmland and   
 thickly wooded  places. The           
 country-side is undulating and ranges 
 from 188 to 254 feet above sea        
 level.Several small streams run       
 through this area and they feed into  
 the old reservoir, which is now a     
 water sports centre.                  
 There are some interesting things to  
 be seen. One of these is an ancient   
 hill fort, known locally as Peace     
 Hill,it  has not been excavated but is
 quite clearly marked on the map.      
 Another interesting thing we found out
 was that there are several small      
 volcanic plugs to be found in some of 
 the fields. Some of these are small   
 enough for the local farmers to remove
 with modern, heavy lifting equipment. 
 One was removed from Riccarton farm to
 level out a field corner.             </content>
