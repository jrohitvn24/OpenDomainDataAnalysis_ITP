		<title>01East of the Kilmartin Valley</title>
		<content> The land rises steeply from the       
 Kilmartin Valley.  The highest point  
 is 231mtrs in the northwest of the    
 area .  It falls sharply in the east  
 of the area to the single track road  
 which runs northward, skirting Loch   
 Leathan.  Forestry plantations grow on
 the nort, west and south of the loch. 
 The remainder of the area is rough    
 grassland, grazed by sheep.  Bracken  
 grows on the ridges and slopes of the 
 ground.  The land is uninhabited now  
 ecxcept for one farm, Klibride, and a 
 new cottage situated in a glen where  
 the land is more fertile, and four    
 houses built by the Forestry Comm., in
 the southwest of the area. Some of the
 forests are fringed by deciduous      
 trees. A few weather-beaten trees     
 survive beside streams and the farm is
 surrounded by woodland.
