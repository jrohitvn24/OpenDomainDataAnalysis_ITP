		<title>15 OUR NEW LIFE IN PEEBLES(1)</title>
		<content>   My Dad's school was at Peterlee near
 Durham,it was closed down because of  
 the fall of pupils. He was the        
 headteacher and could not face being  
 moved to Hartlepool or Newcastle so he
 applied for a job in Penicuik and was 
 successful.                           
   Penicuik was his home town and he   
 had lived in Durham for twenty years  
 so it was difficult trying to get used
 to the idea that we would have to move
 back to Penicuik.                     
   We put our house up for sale and    
 after a worrying five months, it was  
 sold. Then we had to find a house. I  
 was so cross at having to move, I cut 
 the sale sign down but it did no good.
 We moved over to Penicuik and we      
 stayed with our Gran for about three  
 months (continued).
