		<title>01LIVINGSTON NEW TOWN</title>
		<content>   Within the last twenty years this   
 part of Central Scotland has changed  
 dramatically. Where fields and farms  
 once were we now have a new town with 
 a vast industrial area.               
   The area of Knightsridge is mainly  
 owned and rented out by Livingston    
 Development Corporation but there are 
 a few owner occupied houses. The      
 amenities are limited and the shopping
 precinct consists of only a few shops.
   Houston Industrial Estate is the    
 main industrial area in Livingston and
 was also the first to be built.The M8 
 motorway lies to the north of the     
 estate and affords easy access to     
 local businesses.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
