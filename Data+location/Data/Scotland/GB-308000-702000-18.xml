 growing.Local fund-raising brought    
 outdoor changing rooms at{King George 
{V Park. Derelict land}at the old rail 
 station by the Scottish Development   
 Agency has been{landscaped}as the     
 Davies Park. Part of the old line     
 southwards may be used as a walk. The 
{Kirkgate Park}road needs repair after 
 many years as the route to a well used
 local amenity. The old East Church is 
 now well used as a day{Church Centre  
 throughout the week. Elderly and      
 disabled people can now reach it by   
 minibus. The old Millbridge Hall has  
 been condemned and demolished. Plans  
 are in hand for a new suite of halls, 
 mainly for local youth organisations. 
 Locals also hope for more use of      
 school buildings and would like a new 
 public{swimming pool}as the Green     
 Hotel pool is small and overused.     </content>
