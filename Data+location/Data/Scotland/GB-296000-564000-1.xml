		<title>01NEW ABBEY - INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>   This area lies 7 miles south of     
 Dumfries on the A710 (Solway Coast)   
 road. It was formerly in the county of
 the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright but,   
 since regionalisation, has been in the
 district of Nithsdale in Dumfries and 
 Galloway Region.                      
   A burn called the New Abbey Pow cuts
 through the area and flows into the   
 River Nith estuary on the east.  This 
 estuary is part of the Solway Firth   
 and has dangerous quick-sands and fast
 running tides.                        
   The ruins of Sweetheart Abbey have, 
 for hundreds of years, dominated the  
 village of New Abbey (population 600) 
 and now attract many tourists.        
   There are fine woodlands, including 
 magnificent Scots pines, in the       
 district.                             
   The climate is mild and pleasant.
