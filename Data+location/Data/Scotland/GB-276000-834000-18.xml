		<title>18Young Thoughts of Moy</title>
		<content>  I love living in Moy. We came because
 we didn't like the town. I want to    
 stay in Moy or go to Edinburgh. I     
 would like to be a hairdresser. I like
 Moy because of the peace and freedom. 
 I like walking in the woods and going 
 to the Loch for picnics. We take our  
 swimming costumes.                    
                  _                    
  I like living in Moy because it is   
 peacefull. When I grow up I would like
 to be a Film Star. I would have to    
 leave Moy.                            
                  _                    
  I love living in Moy. I would like to
 be a farmer on Moy Farm. I am glad I  
 would not have to leave Moy for this  
 job. I do not want to leave Moy ever. 
 The reasons for not leaving are the   
 peace and trees to climb, the freedom 
 and the forest walks. I love the      
 countryside.                          </content>
