 A survey on how pupils' families are  
 employed showed that the majority are 
 employed in some capacity by          
 B.U.T.E.C. (British Underwater Test   
 Evaluation Centre) at Kyle.           
 They include drivers, security men,   
 helicopter pilots, cleaners, cooks,   
 seamen, computer-operators etc. but   
 they are not necessarily living inside
 our Domesday Block.                   
 We also looked at the occupiers of    
 houses on this block and discovered   
 that many were retired people.        
 All the houses are privately owned.   
 The National Trust owns most of the   
 land but does not employ many people. 
 Auchtertyre Farm employs only one man 
 at present and some croft fields are  
 worked by people not resident on the  
 block.
