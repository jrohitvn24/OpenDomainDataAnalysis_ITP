		<title>16KILSYTH TELEPHONE EXCHANGE</title>
		<content>     The telephone exchange was opened 
 on 30th June 1971. It is a TXE2       
 electronic exchange which replaced    
 an earlier STROWGER exchange(so       
 called after its Kansas inventor).    
 It has 5000 lines,4200 of which are   
 in use just now.                      
     There is to be a digital telephone
 exchange built in Queenzieburn in two 
 to three years time .                 
     In the future if you were going   
 out you could phone the exchange and  
 tell them not to allow any more calls.
 When you got back you could phone     
 the exchange which would recognise    
 your voice and free the telephone. You
 might tape a message if you were going
 away. The exchange would pass on      
 the message at whatever time you      
 wanted.
