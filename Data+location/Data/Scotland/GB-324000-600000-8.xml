		<title>08A TIBETAN TEMPLE</title>
		<content>  Towards the end of the 1970's it     
 became clear obvious that enlarged    
 facilities were essential , and so    
 the Samye Project came into being,the 
 construction of a Tibetan temple after
 the style of original Samye monastry  
 consisting of three floors each in    
 distinctive Tibetan style.            
  The work is in two phases.The first  
 phase consists of the construction of 
 the actual Shrine room and two smaller
 floors to provide accomodation to     
 visiting lamas and to house various   
 relics.The shell of this building is  
 now complete.                         
  Phase 2 will be the construction of  
 the wings of the monastry,providing   
 student accomodation, lecture         
 ,therapy and translation rooms.Two    
 libraries one for tibetan and the     
 other for English works and space for 
 video and tape archives.              </content>
