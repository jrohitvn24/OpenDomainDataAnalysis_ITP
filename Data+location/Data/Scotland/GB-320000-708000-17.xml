		<title>17Child's View of Strathmiglo</title>
		<content> I am 12 years old and I have lived    
 here all my life.I like living in     
 Strathmiglo because there's lots of   
 things to do.There's lots of clubs to 
 go to or we can go to the park where  
 there's nearly always some one to play
 with.I would like to have a swimming  
 pool here because we have to go to    
 Cupar pool and I can only go at the   
 weekends.If we had a pool here I could
 go nearly every day.There used to be a
 cinema here but not in my time.It     
 would be quite good to have a cinema  
 here but they wouldn't make enough    
 money.Instead we have lots of country 
 walks.At school there are only 71     
 pupils.I like a small school because I
 know everyone.I go to the library here
 and in Cupar. I like the Cupar one    
 but I don't like our one becuse I have
 read all the good books. I would not  
 like to move away from here.          </content>
