		<title>01HARRAY</title>
		<content> This area of Harray consists, on the  
 east side, of moorland hills rising to
 200 metres. These are used extensively
 for peat cutting. On the west side the
 land slopes down to level ground which
 is intensively farmed with sheep and  
 cattle. Running east-west through the 
 middle of the area is the "Lyde Road" 
 (The lyde being the gap in the hills  
 between Harray and Rendall). Most of  
 the farms are off this road, many of  
 them being small holdings. The whole  
 area is sparsely populated. In the    
 N.W. corner is Corrisall farm, this is
 a museum of farming life and          
 implements during the 18th Century.
