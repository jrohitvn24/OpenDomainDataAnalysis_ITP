		<content>{Entertainment}is well provided for the
 people of {Biggar} by the {Theatre    
{Workshop.} The Theatre Workshop       
 provides two main forms of            
 Entertainment Plays and Films. Of     
 these perhaps the Film shows have     
 suffered the most in recent years due 
 to the introduction of the video.The  
 plays are very popular and they are   
 usually amateur ,but of a very high   
 standard.The one that attracts most   
 attention is the Christmas            
 Pantomime.Apart from the Theatre      
 Workshop there is the {Biggar Music   
{Club};this has an excellent reputation
 for getting good artistes from the    
 world of Classical Music. There is    
 some entertainment in the form of     
 Dicos for the teenagers,but there     
 probably is room for improvement here.
