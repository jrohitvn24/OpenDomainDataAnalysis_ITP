		<content>{Dunbar Castle}was built on a rocky    
 headland and belonged to the Earls of 
 Dunbar who were established in Dunbar 
 after the Norman Conquest in England  
 .In the 15th Century the Earldom was  
 confiscated and reverted to the       
 Crown.By 1523 a blockhouse was built  
 on the landward side of the Castle and
 was the most modern in Europe at the  
 time.Some of the fortifications were  
 destroyed by Order of Parliament      
 following Quenn Mary's abdication.    
 Further destruction followed when the 
 new entrance channel for the Victoria 
 Harbour was cut.                      
{The Battery}was built in 1781 on      
 Lammer Island.It had a rounded front, 
 which faced seaward,pierced by        
 embrasures for the main armaments.It  
 was later used as a hospital          
                                       
                                       </content>
