		<title>09CHURCH IN GLENPROSEN</title>
		<content>      The small church measures        
 externally only 15 metres by 6 metres.
 Joined onto the church are a small    
 wooden vestry and a stone vestuable.  
 The small vestuable has an unusual    
 wooden yett.In the vestuable there is 
 a memorial to all the people killed   
 during the world wars.                
     Inside the church we estimated    
 that at 5 people to a small pew, the  
 church could hold 150 people.The      
 average attendance however is 20      
 people.The roll of the United churches
 is 320 but of these only 30 live in   
 Glenprosen and use the church here.The
 services in Prosen Church are every   
 second and fourth Sunday at 12:15pm.  
 There is only one bell and it is rung 
 from the outside of the church before 
 every service. Collection is taken in 
 an old fashioned wooden collecting box
 on a long pole.                       </content>
