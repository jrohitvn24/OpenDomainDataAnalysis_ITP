		<title>13A day in the life of Stuart</title>
		<content> WEDNESDAY                             
 My name is Stuart McDonald.I wake up  
 every morning about 8 o'clock,wash and
 have some Alpen for breakfast.        
 Later,about 8.30am,I brush my teeth.  
 About 8.35am I run down to school. I  
 play football until the bell rings at 
 9am. I go into the classroom and get  
 my day's assignments. We usually get a
 page of maths, language, spelling,    
 project,etc. I set to work straight   
 away and finish about 11.30am when I  
 do extra project or another pastime   
 until the bell rings at 12.45pm.      
 I go home and have my lunch of meat,  
 chips and beans,etc. I then brush my  
 teeth and come back to school, and    
 play till the 1.45 bell rings. We all 
 go inside and get changed for a game  
 of football. We march up to the local 
 park and play football for one and a  
 quarter hours.                        </content>
