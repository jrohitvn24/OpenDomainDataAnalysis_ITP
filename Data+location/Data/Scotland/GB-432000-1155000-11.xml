		<title>11Transport in Aith</title>
		<content> As Aith is not on a main road cars are
 almost essential to every day life. Of
 the 201 people in the block, 154 own  
 cars. There is a garage in the village
 which services, repairs and deals in  
 cars. It sells petrol, as does the    
 shop. Daily bus services running on   
 the main west road can be connected   
 with at Bixter, about 3 miles away.   
 A minibus service is run for this     
 purpose once a week. An old folks bus 
 takes old people to Lerwick once a    
 week.The school children from the     
 surrounding district go to school by  
 bus. Tractors are used for work on the
 crofts and to transport peats etc. A  
 few young people have motorcycles and 
 some crofts have trikes for rounding  
 up the sheep on the hill. Many        
 children have bicycles and some of    
 the local children cycle to school.
