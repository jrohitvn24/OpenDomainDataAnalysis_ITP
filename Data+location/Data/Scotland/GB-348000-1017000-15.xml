		<title>15THE OUSE AND LAIRO WATER</title>
		<content>{The Ouse}is a long arm of water which 
 was formed when the{coastline}broke   
 and the water rushed in.It is{tidal}so
 it drains of water when the tide goes 
 out.People dig in the sand for        
{cockles}.Around the mouth of the{Ouse 
 there are a few rocks where{mussels   
 grow.Mussels are very difficult to    
 pull off the rock because they        
 attach themselves by a bundle of short
 threads.                              
            LAIRO WATER                
 Near by,lies{Lairo Water}.It is       
 completely closed off from the sea by 
 a strip of land.This is called an     
{"ayre." Swans}nest here nearly every  
 year.{Long Tailed}ducks which are     
 winter visitors have been seen,so     
 have{Tufted }ducks.The water there is 
 salt water,not fresh water.{Lairo     
{Water}is not very deep.
