		<title>16COACH HIRE IN MENSTRIE</title>
		<content> Matchett's is a large Continental     
 Coach Hire firm that is based in      
 Menstrie. Its fleet consists of       
 mini-buses, standard coaches and a    
 large two-decked coach for luxury     
 travel.                               
 The mini-buses are used for           
 engagements such as moving students to
 the University of Stirling which is   
 nearby, and for the use of the        
 disabled.                             
 Matchetts also work in conjunction    
 with two or three other coach firms to
 share the burden of the heavy workload
 of the coach hire business.           
 They also run a small ice-cream       
 vending business using vans which tour
 the neighbouring housing estates.
