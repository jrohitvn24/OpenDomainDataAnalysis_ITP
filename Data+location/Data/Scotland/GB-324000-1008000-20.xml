 It caters for all age ranges and      
 interests.There are lots of           
 competitions ,like searchwords,odd one
 out,odd views,round the town races in 
 fancy dress,sand castle building ,    
 greasy pole climbs over the pier,a    
 swimming gala at the local pool,pet &amp; 
 baby shows,and sea based activities.In
 the past the show people came with    
 'fair' activities but now there's     
 little except ',housie housie,        
 candyfloss and goldfish.Now there's   
 groups brought from other parts to

 parade of floats and a firework       
 display.A big night out for some folk.</content>
