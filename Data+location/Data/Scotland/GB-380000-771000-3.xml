		<title>03Education in Inverbervie</title>
		<content> Due to so many new houses being built 
 in Inverbervie in the last ten years, 
 the school roll has increased         
 considerably. During this time the    
 school has become too small for all   
 the children so an extension was      
 added.After the work had started the  
 school had to get three temporary     
 portacabins for classes to work in.   
 Now everthing is back to normal and we
 have a new office, library, special   
 teaching areas, headmaster's office   
 and an assistant head's office.       
 Unfortunately these facilities are    
 still too small for the 228 pupils of{
{Inverbervie School}and further        
 extensions may be required.           
 After seven years at Bervie Primary   
 the children complete their schoolling
 at{Mackie Academy}in Stonehaven,      
 travelling by bus leaving at 8.30am   
 and returning at 4.30pm.              </content>
