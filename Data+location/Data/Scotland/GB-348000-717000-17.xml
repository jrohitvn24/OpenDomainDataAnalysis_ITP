		<title>17THE OPEN CHAMPIONSHIPS</title>
		<content> ST.Andrews is regarded as the "Home of
 Golf" and has held the Open           
 Championship 22 times, the first      
 occasion being in 1860.               
    In 1984 St.Andrews was host to the 
 113th competition which was won by    
 Severiano Ballesteros of Spain. The   
 weather throughout the Championship   
 was magnificent and the arrival at    
 Leuchars of Concorde bringing V.I.P.s 
 direct from New York attracted huge   
 crowds. Even on practice days, there  
 was a record attendance with over     
 40,000 spectators.  This meant that   
 the total prize money could be        
 increased by 10% to Â£451,000. (The 1st
 prize was Â£55,000.) This decision     
 caused much controversy since many    
 people felt that the money could have 
 been more usefully spent on providing 
 sponsorship for promising young       
 British golfers.                      </content>
