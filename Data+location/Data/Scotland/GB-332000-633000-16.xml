		<title>16VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> THE VILLAGE HALL WAS COMPLETED AND    
 OPENED IN 1952 AND HAS SINCE BEEN THE 
 CENTRE OF SOCIAL ACTIVITY IN THE      
 COMMUNITY. IT IS REGULARLY USED BY THE
 WOMEN'S RURAL INTITUTE, BADMINTON CLUB
 AND BOWLING CLUB. DURING THE SUMMER   
 THERE ARE FREQUENT BARBECUES AND      
 OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES ORGANISED BY A VERY
 ACTIVE HALL COMMITTEE. THE HALL IS    
 PRIVATELY OWNED AND FINANCED BY THE   
 COMMUNITY. THE SCHOOL HOLDS ITS ANNUAL
 CHRISTMAS PERFORMANCE THERE AND ALSO  
 ALL SOCIAL OR FUND RAISING EVENTS     
 WHICH OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME. A NEW  
 KITCHEN HAS BEEN ADDED RECENTLY GIVING
 THE HALL A SPLENDID NEW FACILITY TO   
 SUPPLEMENT THE LARGE STAGE AND SEATING
 SPACE IN THE MAIN AREA.
