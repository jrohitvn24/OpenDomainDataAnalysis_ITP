		<content> Summer starts here about the end of   
 June! July August and September are   
 the warmest months of the year.       
 Autumn is long and draion out and the 
 winter weather starts about mid       
 November.  Sometimes a mild spell     
 follows and then the winter storms    
 strike  about February. Sometimes     
 these storms can be violent blocking  
 roads and cuttinng off farms in       
 remoter areas, but they don't last    
 long. The cold weather does,and snow  
 falls as late as April with severe    
 night frosts. Last year the rainfall  
 was 95.57cms. Sunshine averaged 3_4   
 hrs per day,and the best months were  
 April and May. This year the trend    
 seems to be slightly different, with a
 snow storm at the end of April.This   
 weather  makes the season for the     
 farmers very short.
