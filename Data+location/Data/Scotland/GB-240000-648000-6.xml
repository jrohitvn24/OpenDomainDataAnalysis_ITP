		<content> R.HOWIES AND SONS SET UP BUSINESS IN  
 DUNLOP AS JOINERS AND CARTWRIGHTS     
 IN 1850.NEARLY ALL THE TIMBER USED    
 THEN WAS GROWN LOCALLY. OVER THE YEARS
 THE FIRM HAS UNDERGONE MANY CHANGES   
 BUT THE BUSINESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN      
 RELATED TO AGRICULTURE. HOWIES HAVE   
 BECOME MORE SAFETY CONSCIOUS OVER THE 
 YEARS. NOWADAYS EMPLOYEES IN THE      
 INDUSTRY WEAR MASKS, PROTECTIVE       
 CLOTHING AND TIN HATS TO AVOID INJURY 
    COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED     
 FOR STAFFING INFORMATION AND STOCK    
 CONTROL AND THE FIRM BANK LOCALLY.    
 HOWIES IS STILL A FAMILY FIRM AND     
 BECAUSE MOST OF THE FAMILY LIVE       
 LOCALLY THEY TAKE A LIVELY INTEREST   
 IN COMMUNITY AFFAIRS.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
