		<content>   The school I attend is{Penninghame  
{Primary School.}It has a roll of      
 two_hundred and thirty_three pupils,  
 not the highest in its history but far
 greater than in 1873 when forty_four  
 pupils attended on the first day of   
 term.It is the biggest school in the  
 area with one headmaster,one assistant
 head,nine teachers,one secretary and  
 one janitor.As well as class teachers 
 there are P.E.,art,music,remedial     
 teachers and teachers of musical      
 instruments.                          
   In 1964 the school moved into the   
 present building.This building has a  
 big playground which is divided into  
 two parts,one for the infants and one 
 for the bigger pupils.The bigger      
 pupils have a netball court and a     
 football pitch.Near our school is a   
 church to which we go at the end of   
 term.                                 </content>
