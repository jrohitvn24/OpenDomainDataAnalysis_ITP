		<title>13THE BRICKWORKS, THURSO</title>
		<content>  {Thurso Brickworks}near the estuary  
 of{Thurso River}replaced the old      
 Caithness flagstone industry when     
 concrete became a more suitable       
 building material. When the flagstone 
 industry was at its height the boats  
 used to load up at this part of the   
 river.                                
   The brickworks are operated by      
 Omand Contractors, a local company.   
 They also run a garage, haulage       
 business and auction rooms nearby.    
 The previous owner of the Brickworks  
 was John Fyfe Ltd.                    
   Five men, including a foreman, are  
 employed making bricks and concrete   
 blocks. The raw material comes from   
 Melvich Quarry about 30 miles away.   
   About 4500 bricks are made each day 
 and they are sold mainly to local     
 building firms.
