		<content>      Randolph Gordon Erskine Wemyess, 
 landowner and coalowner,whose family  
 still stay at Wemyss Castle,died in   
 1909 and that same year his widow     
 built the hospital now standing in    
 Denbeath in his memory for a total    
 cost of Â£10,000.It provided           
 general treatment for the local people
 and for the miners injured in his     
 pits.                                 
      Today the hospital does not      
 perform surgical operations or offer  
 emergency services, but has care and  
 recovery wards as well as geriatric   
 wards. It also has an outpatient      
 physiotherapy department and offers   
 chiropody facilities, appreciated by  
 the old folk in the area.             
      The clock in the tower on top of 
 the hospital is unusual.The hands are 
 in the form of a pick and shovel,the  
 traditional tools of the coal miner.  </content>
