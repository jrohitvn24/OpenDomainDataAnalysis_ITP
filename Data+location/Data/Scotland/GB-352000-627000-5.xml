		<content>{General Information.}Farming is now   
 highly mechanised, therefore there are
 fewer farm workers. Most workers have 
 a basic five day week with the        
 exception of shepherds who have a     
 seven day contract. With few          
 exceptions workers have a rent free   
 house, but free milk and potatoes are 
 seldom allowed. Fertilizers and       
 insecticides are extensively used on  
 the land. Most farms have some form of
 drier for hay and grain. Hay is       
 usually formed into oblong bales for  
 general use or larger round bales     
 which are used in circular feeders.   
 Some straw is also formed into round  
 bales which are used for bedding and  
 overwintreing cattle in courts or     
 sheds.                                
 The remaining stubble is usually      
 burned off.
