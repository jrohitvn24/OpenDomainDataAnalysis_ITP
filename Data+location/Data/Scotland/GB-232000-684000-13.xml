		<content> The country side in this area is      
 very pretty and people like to come   
 here for their holidays.   They like  
 to visit Loch Lomond, go for a sail   
 and visit the islands.   Some people  
 come back year after year.   Bed and  
 Breakfast is provided at many farms   
 and cottages.   People come from all  
 over the world to stay for a night or 
 a week.   Many of those who come      
 are Americans.   Some families move   
 into a caravan beside their homes in  
 the summer in order to provide Bed and
 Breakfast in their houses. It is a    
 a very busy time and the children help
 to set the table and make the beds.
