		<content>  When I studied the sphere of         
 influence of the Lochans. I found that
 the area south of the village was     
 beginning to take the shape of the    
 crystaler{hypothesis}theory that all  
 settlements should link up in a       
 hexagonal. But, west of the village it
 is very hilly, the heighest point     
 being 182 feet, so it is very sparcley
 populated and in my interviews I did  
 not get any one from that area.       
  I never interviewed anybody from the 
 north of the village. I think because 
 most of them will go to the major town
 in the area{STRANRAER.                
  East of the village there are good   
 roads to it but there also good roads 
 to neighbouring village of{STONEYKIRK.
  Considering the reputation of the    
 Lochans village, which is very        
 unpopular, many will go to Stoneykirk.
