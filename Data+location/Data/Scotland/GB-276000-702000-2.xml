  During the first half century the    
education of the boys tended to be more
practical than academic with a view to 
the boys entering the boys service     
(although this was not compulsory).This
period was supervised by the Royal Army
Education Corps, however, with the     
raising of the school leaving age the  
academic side became more important. To
accommodate this increase in academic  
work the teaching staff changed over to
civilian teachers. Subjects being      
taught are english, mathematics,       
statistics, latin, french, german,     
modern studies, economics, physics,    
chemistry, biology, art, woodwork,     
metalwork, technical drawing,          
engineering, physical edn., music,     
piping, drumming, highland dancing and 
soon computing.
