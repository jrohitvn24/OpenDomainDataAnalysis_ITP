		<title>01SUMMARY OF STOER</title>
		<content>  This block is situated in the {North 
{West Highlands }of Scotland in the    
 parish of Assynt.It includes the      
 hamlets of Clashmore, Balchladich,    
 Clashnessie, Culkein and Achnacarnin. 
   The ground is hard and rocky, mostly
 covered in grass and heather. Few     
 trees survive here because it is so   
 windswept. There are mainly sheep     
 reared here,and perhaps a few cows.   
   On the southwest side of this       
 peninsula the coast  has dangerously  
 steep cliffs and stoney beaches but on
 the opposite coastline there are some 
 cliffs but also a very sandy beach    
 popular with tourists.                
   It is a very sparsely populated area
 and there are not many people left who
 speak the {Gaelic }language. Attempts 
 to revive gaelic classes in Sutherland
 schools failed but classes are now    
 starting in{Rhue Stoer Community Hall.</content>
