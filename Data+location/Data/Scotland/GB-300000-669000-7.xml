		<content> The main aim of MOTEC is the training 
 of apprentices in the{Road Transport} 
 Industry. The training unit has been  
 designed to provide realistic working 
 conditions in which{apprentices}can   
 have experience of all aspects of the 
 trade. Those selected for this        
 training come from the Road Transport 
 Industry but there is also a training 
 plan for{Youth Opportunity(unemployed 
{youngsters)}in this ultra modern,     
 highly technical and well organized   
 unit. The apprentices and             
 occasionally,management course people 
 all enjoy superb recreational         
 facilities such as cinema,sports      
 field,games hall, squash courts and   
 swimming pool, under the supervision  
 of qualified staff. However the future
 of MOTEC is unsure because of high    
 costs. The building was opened in     
 1972.                                 </content>
