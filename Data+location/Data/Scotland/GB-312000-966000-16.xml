		<title>16VISITING A SENIOR CITIZEN</title>
		<content>   Mrs. McLean lives in a sheltered    
 house. She is 78 years old and has    
 always lived in{Thurso.}She likes to  
 be called{Jinad}which is Caithness    
 dialect for Janet and for many years  
 wrote articles and poems for the local
 newspaper using this name.            
   She has a great interest in old     
 things and looked after the Local Folk
 Museum for many years.                
   Jinad loved school but told us that 
 there were many barefooted children   
 then. School was heated by a small    
 fire which didn't give them much heat 
 as the teacher stood in front of it.  
   A home she had to bring in 10       
 buckets of water a day. They ate      
 porridge and milk, tatties and herring
 and on Sunday mince and tatties.      
   When{Jinad}left school she gutted   
 fish for 35 shillings a week and      
 worked from 7a.m. until 11p.m.        </content>
