		<title>03The Old Graveyard - Kennoway</title>
		<content>  The old{Parish Graveyard}is to be    
 found midway up the{Causeway.}It      
 borders the site of the old{Mercat    
{Square}where trade was mainly         
 conducted in days gone by.            
  The yard is enclosed by a high stone 
 wall and within this wall the original
 parish church and its graveyard were  
 sited. In time the church fell into a 
 state of ruin and today no trace      
 remains except the graveyard itself.  
 One of the earliest remaining         
 gravestones is that of Jean Robertson 
 who died on Dec.9th 1702. Entry to the
 yard is through a heavy iron gate and 
 on the right hand side as you enter is
 the{Mort House.}Here corpses were     
 allowed to decay before burial in an  
 effort to thwart grave robbers who    
 sailed across the Firth of Forth from 
 Edinburgh to obtain cadavers for the  
 medical school.                       </content>
