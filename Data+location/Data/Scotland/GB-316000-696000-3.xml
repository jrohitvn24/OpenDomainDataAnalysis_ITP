		<title>03Ballingry: The Rise and Fall</title>
		<content>  Until the late 19th century, there   
 was in Ballingry parish a pastoral    
 community of hardly more than 400     
 people. When mining developments began
 at the{MARY}and{GLENCRAIG}pits, how-  
 ever, all that changed. Houses went up
 in{Glencraig, Crosshill, Lochore}and  
 finally,{Ballingry.}By 1951, the 400  
 had increased to an amazing 14000!    
  Most of these local mines had closed 
 by the early 1960s, and now all that  
 remains of the 'Mary', at one time the
 deepest mine in Scotland,is a monument
 in the shape of her winding gear, set 
 on the edge of{LOCHORE MEADOWS COUNTRY
{PARK,}the coal board's showpiece of   
 land reclamation. With it went many of
 the miners' houses and Ballingry is   
 now left with a population of under   
 10000, and a legacy of unemployment.
