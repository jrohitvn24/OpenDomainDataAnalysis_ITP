 The River Drynoch,which runs into Loch
 Harport,can be fished for trout and   
 salmon,when in season and with a      
 permit.At the estuary there are often 
 people picking winkles when the tide  
 is right.They can sell them to a buyer
 from Portree.One local fisherman farms
 an oyster bed in the loch.Mackerel are
 caught from the pier or by boat.The   
 loch provides good shelter for boats  
 and is used by fishing boats and      
 yachts.Sometimes there are windsurfers
 or canoeists.Coal is also delivered to
 the coal yard by sea and oil for the  
 distillery is brought by tanker to the
 pier and pumped up to huge storage    
 tanks through pipes which run all the 
 way up the pier.
