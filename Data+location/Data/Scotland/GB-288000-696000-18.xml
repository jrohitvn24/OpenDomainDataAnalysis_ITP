		<title>18DISASTER IN ALVA</title>
		<content> On November 3rd 1984 very heavy rain  
 brought{floods}to Alva. The last great
 floods were in 1877 when all the      
 Hillfoots towns were affected. Here is
 part of a{ballad}written by Primary 6 
 after this{event.                     
  THE BALLAD OF THE GREAT ALVA FLOOD   
                                       
 The 3rd of November was not a good day
 No-one in Alva could go out to play,  
 Down came the rain for hours &amp; hours, 
 With never a break between showers &amp;  
                             showers.  
                                       
 At the West end of Alva folk suffered 
                            the worst  
 The drains all filled up:they were    
                       ready to burst. 
 The Back Road collapsed &amp; the cars    
                           had to stop 
 Workmen were pumping there all round  
                            the clock. </content>
