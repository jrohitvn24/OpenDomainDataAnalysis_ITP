		<content>{Our Community Hall.  } LUCY CHAPMAN.  
      Many activities take place in the
 Quarff Community Hall which was opened
 in 1926. In 1984 an extension was     
 built which included a kitchen, bar   
 and cloakrooms. It is used as a Youth 
 Club two days in the week. Once a week
 there is a whist drive when a card    
 game called 500 is played. Sometimes  
 people have their birthday parties in 
 the hall and wedding receptions. We   
 have sales of work and occasionally a 
 disco with coloured lights. Sometimes 
 there are dances when a local group or
 band comes to play. During the Folk   
 Festival there was a concert in the   
 hall; folk singers came from the      
 mainland and overseas. Last week a    
 Childrens' Circus came to entertain   
 us. All the acts were perfomed by     
 teenagers. There were clowns,         
 unicyclists and stiltwalkers.         </content>
