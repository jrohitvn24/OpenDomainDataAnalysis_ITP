		<title>06Housing at Ythanwells</title>
		<content> Most of the houses are about 100 years
 old. They are built of stone and lime,
 with slated roofs.Each house has its  
 own water supply, either by gravity or
 pumped from wells,and an open fire    
 with tiled fireplace and a back boiler
 for heating water,a bathroom and      
 electricity. Mostly the houses have 2 
 storeys,the upstairs rooms having     
 sloping ceilings.The estate built most
 of the farmhouses and owns the land.  
 There are no council houses in the    
 district, but in recent years some of 
 the deserted crofthouses have been    
 bought by newcomers and modernised    
 with the help of a grant from the     
 District Council.
