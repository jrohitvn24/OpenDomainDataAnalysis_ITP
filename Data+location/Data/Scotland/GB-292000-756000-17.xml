		<content>  Most people who live in Pitlochry are
 there by choice; it is a popular      
 retirement area. However, this is not 
 always the case: within our area is a 
 National Children's Home. John Ford,  
 recently arrived from Dundee, has     
 fresh impressions of Pitlochry and its
 good and bad points.                  
  Pitlochry, to him, appears quiet,    
 peaceful, with an air of somnolence,  
 which together with the scenery, the  
 better housing and the lack of        
 vandalism make it a pleasant place to 
 stay. But there were problems:        
 inadequate transport services, lack of
 sports facilities, especially a       
 swimming pool, and poor, over- priced 
 shops.                                
  For someone like John, Pitlochry has 
 some of the qualities of a refuge, so 
 much so that he does not look forward 
 to returning to the big city.         </content>
