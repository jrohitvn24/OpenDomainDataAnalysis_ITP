		<content> The new road links also brought more  
 people,wanting to settle in the area. 
 This show in Crossgates where recently
 two new private housing schemes have  
 sprung up.One to the west of the      
 village where the new road is being   
 built,and another of which part is    
 still under construction,to the south.
 Due to the closeness of the new road  
 being built,which will connect        
 Dunfermline with Kircaldy and         
 Glenrothes,the houses in the estate to
 the west,have decreased in price,and  
 some owners are moving to the southern
 estate.                               
    Also recently,the Lauder Technical 
 College has moved to new buildings in 
 Hallbeath,and between Crossgates and  
 Hallbeath a {Bells Scotch Whiskey }   
 bottling factory has opened.This has  
 paved the way for a new industrial    
 estate in the area.                   </content>
