		<title>15GOLDEN HINDE,FORT AUGUSTUS.</title>
		<content>  In the spring of 1985 a replica of   
 Sir Francis Drake's Golden Hinde      
 passed through Fort Augustus on the { 
{Caledonian Canal.}                    
 Our school was allowed to go on board 
 and a guide took us down below where  
 we saw the huge cogs that turned the  
 sails.We also saw some of the weapons 
 that would have been used in the time 
 of Sir Francis Drake including the    
 huge cannons that would have been     
 used in battle.The size of the cannon 
 balls was about the same size as      
 those used in the game of bowls.We    
 were then shown where they slept.They 
 didn't sleep in ordinary beds,they    
 slept in hammocks.                    
 The replica of the {Golden Hinde}     
 looked very realistic and we all found
 our time aboard her very interesting.
