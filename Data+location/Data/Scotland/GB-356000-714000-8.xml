		<content> Farmers are now prepared to make      
 extensive use of pesticides,          
 herbicides and other chemicals in     
 order to improve the amount and       
 quality of their crop yields.         
 These sprays are most often water     
 soluble for ease of application and it
 is inevitable that many of the        
 chemical products thus applied find   
 their way via rain water run-off into 
 the small streams and burns.          
 Chemicals have had this effect on the 
 Kenley Burn which is suffering from   
 the effects of chemical pollution. The
 growth of algae, particularly at the  
 mouth of the burn, has greatly        
 increased indicating the excessive    
 presence of nitrates in the water.    
 This reduces the oxygen level in the  
 water and there is a subsequent       
 decrease in fish life. The algae is,  
 in effect, choking the burn to death. </content>
