		<title>13MODERN KITCHEN</title>
		<content> A modern kitchen is fitted with a wide
 range of washing machines,cookers and 
 cupboards.It is all included in the   
 price of a house.The cooker is a hob  
 and has a cooker hood to take away    
 appetising aromas and the cloying     
 smells in the kitchen.The fridges have
 ample space.There is a compartment    
 for frozen food.All these appliances  
 are built in the latest housing       
 design.The washing machine is fully   
 automatic with all a family's washing 
 programmes at the touch of a button.  
 Normally a person would pay over Â£1000
 to install all of the kitchen utensils
 like microwaves and cooker hoods etc. 
 You  would say that they are real     
 luxury kitchens!
