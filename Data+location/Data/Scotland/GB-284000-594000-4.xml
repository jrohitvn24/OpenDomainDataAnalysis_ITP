		<content>   There are several financial         
 institutions in Thornhill. These have 
 grown up to serve Thornhill and its   
 surrounding areas. The oldest         
 institution is the Trustee Savings    
 Bank (TSB) which was established in   
 1842. This is a part time sub-branch  
 of Britain's oldest TSB in Dumfries.  
 The main bank is a main branch of the 
 Bank of Scotland. The only full       
 building society is the National      
 Provincial, which opened in 1983. It  
 is a sub-branch of the main branch in 
 Dumfries. The two solicitors in the   
 village:- Robert Wilson and son and W 
 M Henderson act as agents for building
 societies. These are the Leicester and
 Nationwide respectively. Finally there
 is a Post Office which was established
 in 1850, originally it was a crown    
 Post Office but now it is a           
 sub-branch.                           </content>
