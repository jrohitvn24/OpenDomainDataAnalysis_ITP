		<content> We do not have public transport. The  
 direct result of this is that most    
 families have at least one car. Fuel  
 costs are very high; higher than on   
 the mainland. At the moment petrol    
 costs about Â£2.11 per gallon.         
 Once a month pensioners go to Portree,
 by mini-bus. This bus was provided by 
 the Isle of  Skye Round-Table.        
 The post car will take you to and from
 Dunvegan, from Monday through till    
 Saturday. The car only takes four     
 passengers. It is very handy for      
 people who do not drive.
