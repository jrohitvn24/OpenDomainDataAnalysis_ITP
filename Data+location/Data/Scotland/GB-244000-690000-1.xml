		<content> The main{landscape}of our area is

 green woodpecker,ptarmigan,moorhen,   
 crow,blackbird,ravens,kestral,        
 sparrowhawk,buzzards,collared _ dove, 
 wood  pigeon,bluetit,robin,           
 chaffinch,bullfinch,fox,badger,shrew, 
 deer,mole,vole,otter,grass _ snake,   
 rabbit,adder,hares,mice,squirels,     
 domesticated sheep and cattle and wild
 cats. Collies are kept  by farmers as 
 sheep dogs and the locals keep cats   
 and dogs as pets. In Milton we have a 
 school,village hall,church,mill and   
 boatyard. There is also{St.Maha's well
 whose water heals when drunk.         
  There is also a youth club which     
 began in March 1985. Sometimes we go  
 canoeing.                             </content>
