		<title>07Stuck In The Snow</title>
		<content> On Thursday 17th of January 1985 when 
 some of primary 6 and 7s went         
 orienteering in the snow. There were 2
 other schools went as well.           
   When we got there we got stuck in   
 the snow at{Mabie Forest}so we had to 
 sit in the back of the bus while      
{Eaglesfield}pushed the bus out of the 
 snow.After a while we got out of the  
 bus and went down to our starting     
 point.                                
   When we came back to the bus it was 
 stuck again but in a differant place. 
 So the teacher got out and pushed the 
 bus.Once they had got the bus out it  
 went flying into the wall we all      
 screamed but we came back to school   
 alright.   BY
