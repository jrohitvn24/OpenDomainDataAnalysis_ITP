		<title>01THE KINNEFF AREA</title>
		<content>{THE KINNEFF AREA}is in the North_East 
 of Scotland along the coast between   
 Aberdeen and Montrose. Kinneff is a   
 small village with about 50 houses, a 
 guesthouse,a shop,a hall and a church.
 The main coast road South from        
 Aberdeen passes through the village.  
 The{SCHOOL}is about half mile from the
 village and has a roll of 21 children 
 with 2 teachers.                {     
{TODHEAD LIGHTHOUSE}stands on the coast
 flashing its signal 29 miles out to   
 sea. There are several ruins of old   
 castles scattered down the coast. The 
 old Kinneff village is nearer the sea 
 and the{OLD KINNEFF CHURCH}still      
 stands there. The Scottish Crown      
 Jewels were hidden there at one time. 
     We have lots of farms in our area.
{SLAINS PARK FARM}is the biggest one.
