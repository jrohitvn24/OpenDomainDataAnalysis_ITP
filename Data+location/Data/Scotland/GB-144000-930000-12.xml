		<content> I interviewed{MR Fergeson, grazing    
{clerk.}He said that in North Street   
 they only dip and cut their sheeps    
 wool once a year. They are only       
 allowed 12 adult sheep on their       
 crofts but they can have lots of      
 lambs. Most of the crofters sell their
 lambs, through{The Highlands and      
{Islands livestock scheme}and they are 
 sold on the Mainland. Some of the     
 crofters are using suffolk and cheviot
 rams in order to get heavier lambs. At
 the moment there are no cattle on     
 North Street but many years ago nearly
 every family had their own milking    
 cow.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
