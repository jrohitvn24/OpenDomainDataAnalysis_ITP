		<title>10A WATER BAILIFF'S DAY 1</title>
		<content> THE VERY NATURE OF THE WORK INVOLVED  
 IN THIS JOB MAKES A SHORT DESCRIPTION 
 VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE         
 DIFFERING SEASONS AND WEATHER         
 CONDITIONS WITHIN THOSE SEASONS ,AND  
 ALSO OPEN /CLOSED SEASON OF THE RIVER 
 ITSELF.THEREFORE THE BEST WAY MY      
 FATHER CAN DESCRIBE HIS JOB IS TO TELL
 YOU ABOUT TWO SEPARATE DAYS.          
    A DAY DURING THE FISHING SEASON    
 STARTS AT 08.00 ,AT WHICH TIME MY     
 FATHER GETS A REPORT FROM THE NIGHT   
 BAILIFF ABOUT THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S    
 ACTIVITIES.THE DAY'S WORK BEGINS WITH 
 A PATROL OF THE RIVER AND A CLOSE     
 INSPECTION OF ALL THE RIVER BANKS AND 
 PATHS.ANY PERSON FISHING WOULD BE     
 ASKED TO SHOW THEIR PERMIT AND HAVE   
 THEIR TACKLE CHECKED.THE REMAINDER OF 
 THE DAY WOULD BE TAKEN UP OBSERVING   
 PEOPLE FISHING TO ENSURE PROPER       
 METHODS OF FISHING.                   </content>
