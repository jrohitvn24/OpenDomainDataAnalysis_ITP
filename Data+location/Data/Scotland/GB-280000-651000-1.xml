		<content> Situated on the outskirts of an       
 industrial belt this area is mainly   
 fields many of which are used by      
 farmers for grazing sheep or cattle.In
 the centre is the village of Law,which
 is Gaelic for hill,and west of it is  
 Overtown,another small village.Both   
 villages were at one time connected   
 with coal mining and one small private
 mine is still worked in Law.          
  Originally council housing areas,both
 have now been expanded by private     
 contractors.Each village has a Gospel 
 Hall,Presbyterian Church,Primary      
 School,Bowling Green and a bus service
 run by local operators.Overtown also  
 has a garage offering servicing and   
 petrol but Law has no such facility.  
 The main railway line to the south    
 passes close to both villages which   
 are also bounded by 2 "A"class roads. 
 Nearby is a General Hospital.         </content>
