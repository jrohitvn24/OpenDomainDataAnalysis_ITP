 There are two churches in Bettyhill - 
 the Church of Scotland and the Free   
 Church of Scotland.  They are situated
 near each other in the centre of the  
 village.  The Reverend Clifford       
 Rennie, minister of the Church of     
 Scotland has a very large parish      
 stretching twenty five miles from     
 Bettyhill to Altnaharra.  In addition 
 to preaching at the Church of Farr, in
 our village, he takes services in     
 Altnaharra and Strathnaver each       
 Sunday.  The Free Church minister is  
 the Reverend Andrew Fraser from       
 Edinburgh who was previusly a         
 missionary in Peru.  He has an even   
 larger area to cover and is           
 responsible for Free Church           
 Congregations in Tongue, Farr, Strahty
 and Halladale.                        </content>
