		<content>    INLAND FROM THE VILLAGE OF         
 SHIELDAIG IS A LARGE WALLED AREA OF   
 LAND CALLED 'THE CROFT'.   IN THE PAST
 PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE VILLAGE WOULD 
 HAVE A STRIP OF THIS LAND FOR         
 CULTIVATION AND GRAZING.   YOU CAN    
 STILL SEE THE PILES OF STONES CLEARED 
 FROM THE STRIPS, AND PILED AT THE     
 SIDES.                                
    DURING THE WINTER COWS AND SHEEP   
 WOULD GRAZE ON THIS LAND.   AT AN     
 APPOINTED DATE IN THE SPRING THE      
 ANIMALS WOULD BE REMOVED TO GRAZING   
 OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE, AND VEGETABLES,  
 ESPECIALLY POTATOES WOULD BE PLANTED. 
 SOME OF THE LAND WOULD BE IN HAY.     
    IN THE SUMMER THE WOMEN AND        
 CHILDREN WOULD TAKE THE COWS TO THE   
 SUMMER HUTS OR 'SHIELINGS' AND LIVE AT
 THE HIGHER GRAZING LAND.   THE MEN    
 WOULD STAY AND WORK ON THE CROFT.
