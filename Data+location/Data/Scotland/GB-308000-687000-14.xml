		<content> The beautiful Pittencrieff Glen is    
 probably the main tourist attraction  
 of Dunfermline.  Within the Glen there
 is a large number of things to see,   
 such as the Music Pavilion,           
 Pittencrieff House, the cafe,         
 greenhouses with tropical plants, the 
 Carnegie monument, the old            
 locomotive,paddling pools and many    
 animals including peacocks, rabbits,  
 donkeys, goats, guinea pigs, fish and 
 a large variety of birds in an aviary.
    Another prominent feature of       
 Dunfermline is the Abbey.  It is made 
 of brick and stone, but the brick and 
 stone is beginning to crumble and     
 because of this the Abbey has to be   
 closed for a while so that it can be  
 repaired.  Visitors to the Abbey can  
 see a glass case with the remains of  
 King Robert the Bruce in it.
