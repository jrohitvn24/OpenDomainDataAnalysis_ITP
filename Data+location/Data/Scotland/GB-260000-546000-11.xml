		<content> There is no resident police man in the
 area, but it is overseen by the       
 resident police man in Gatehouse, 5   
 miles away.  He patrols the village in
 his van at least once a day, and will 
 see to any crime in the area - which  
 is very infrequent.  Once a year the  
 school children take cycling          
 proficiency tests.  Much of the work  
 is done in school, but the police come
 once or twice to instruct the children
 on the road, sometimes actually taking
 them for a cycle run, instructing them
 as they go.                           
 Any person who is committed for trial 
 appears before the Sheriff Court at   
 Kirkcudbright.
