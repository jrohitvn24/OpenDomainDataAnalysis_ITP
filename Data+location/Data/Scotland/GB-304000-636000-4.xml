		<content>{Agriculture }is the principal industry
 of the {Biggar}area.The mainstay of   
 the farms in the area is stock rearing
 with an emphasis on sheep especially  
 in the Upland parts of the            
 district.However some farms in the    
 valley bottom keep cattle;the most    
 succesful of these is perhaps {Boghall
{Farm},where a dairy businees is run   
 from.The other important aspects of   
 the farming scene in Biggar are the { 
{Auction Market }and the {Slaughter    
{House. }Of these perhaps the most     
 important is the {Slaughter House}    
 ,which markets its products under the 
 name Biggar Beef. This business is now
 worth over two million pounds and much
 of the business is done south of the  
 Border.Finally there is an important  
 Agricultural Show in July,which       
 attracts a large number of people to  
 the area.                             </content>
