  {The Melrose Motor Museum}opened in  
 1982.It is situated near Melrose      
 Abbey.It has over 30 different cars   
 and 40 motorbikes and bicycles.It also
 has sirens from air raids in World War
 2.The oldest car is a{1909 Albion     
 which is also the largest.The most    
 popular model is a{Harley Davidson    
 Bike.The Americans like the{Bentleys  
 best though.The smallest models are   
 some matchbox cars.There is a         
{handpulled cart from Sri Lanka}which  
 was last used in 1973.The cars came   
 from the owner (Mr Dale),an overflow  
 from the museum in{Myreton}and some   
 are on loan.In the summer Mr Dale will
 take out the{Rolls Royce or Bentley   
 and give tourists a guided tour of    
 Melrose.The collection was originally 
 formed because Mr Dale had an interest
 in cars.                              </content>
