		<title>14Life of a Helicopter Pilot</title>
		<content>    There are 2 areas of operation in  
 the North Sea.                        
  (a){The East Shetland Basin}involving
 a round trip of about 3 hours.        
  (b){East of Aberdeen}with a round    
 trip of about 2 hours. Short haul     
 flights are carried out twice daily.  
    Paul feels that the popular image  
 of a pilot is a rather glamourous one.
 He is not particularly well-paid      
 (Â£14,000 p.a.) and he derives little  
 pleasure from piloting a craft which  
 is "noisy, vibrates, is cramped and   
 hot as a greenhouse". The highlight of
 each trip is the meal they receive    
 when they reach the Rig.              
    Paul does not feel that he will    
 stay in Aberdeen or Helicopters much  
 longer. Aberdeen is expensive and cold
 and he would prefer fixed-wing        
 Aircraft to Helicopters.
