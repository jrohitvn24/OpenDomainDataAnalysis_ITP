		<content>     When you go North towards the     
 Firth                                 
 of Forth the soil becomes very light  
 and sandy,but when you go South the   
 ground rises and the soil gets        
 heavier.Even further south the ground 
 rises again and the soil becomes      
 heavier still.                        
    On the sandy ground the farmers    
 have to irrigate the soil very often  
 because the soil drains very easily.A 
 lot of potatoes  are grown in sandy   
 areas because the ground is softer and
 lighter.Arable farmers grow barley,   
 wheat, turnips, oilseed rape and      
 ordinary rape. At the foot of the     
 Lammermuir Hills nearly all the farms 
 there are sheep farms because the     
 land is to steep for tractors to get  
 up and down and the farmers do not    
 need to spend money to buy fences
