		<content> At the SE of the village is the church
 built of whinstone with a roof of west
 moorland flags. The graveyard runs    
 round the church bounded by a drystone
 dyke as is the manse which is also    
 made of whinstone.                    
                                       
 There are four semi-detached houses   
 made of bricks with slate roofs. There
 is a car park in front of the gardens.
                                       
 There is a small house made of stone -
 it has harled walls. The village hall 
 is built in the same way as the house.
 There is a telephone box outside the  
 hall. The school is to the North of   
 the village and has a school house    
 joined onto it where the teacher      
 lives.
