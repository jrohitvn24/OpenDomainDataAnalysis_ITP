 There are four buses on Whalsay 3 big 
 29 seater buses and 1 20 seater bus.  
 Two of the buses drive children to and
 from the school every week. The buses 
 used to belong to Tammy Arthur but due
 to ill health and the high cost of    
 replacement buses the running of them 
 was taken over by the Council in 1979.
  The buses take children under five to
 the playschool on Monday,Wednesday and
 Thursday.                             
  Buses also run workers to the Fish   
 Factory at 7.00 am and home at 5.00pm.
  They also do{special runs}to take    
{Senior Citizens}and{S.W.R.I.}members  
 to and from their meetings held in the
 Symbister Public Hall.                
  On other occasions a bus may go to   
 the Shetland Mainland with a party on 
 an outing.                            </content>
