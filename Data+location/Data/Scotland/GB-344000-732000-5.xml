		<content>    At Burnside of Duntrune there is a 
 bridge over the Fithie Burn.Before the
 bridge there is a weir and a resevoir 
 which was used to feed the water      
 through to the old mill.The mill      
 began life as a flax mill,then it     
 became a wheat mill and finally it was
 a saw mill.The mill is now in ruins.On
 the resevoir behind the weir there are
 geese.Sometimes the geese lose their  
 eggs because the nest is too low in   
 the water and the eggs are too cold to
 hatch.The geese return every year     
 perhaps because the man who lives in  
 the old school house beside the bridge
 feeds them every day.
