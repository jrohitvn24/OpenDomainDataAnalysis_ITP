		<title>06DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content> The farm has been in the same family  
 since 1942.In the past few years the  
 farm has expanded to become one of the
 largest dairy farms in the area.Being 
 near to Glasgow Airport does not seem 
 to cause many problems to the animals 
 or to the farmer and his family.The   
 only disadvantages of living and      
 working on the farm,with little       
 outside help,are the long hours and no
 holidays.                             
     The sixty Ayrshire cows on the    
 farm,are milked twice a day-at 5am and
 5.45pm.The milk then goes to the      
 Scottish Milk Marketing Board,where it
 is bottled and pasteurised and        
 eventually delivered to the customers.
