		<title>03Shiskine Valley - Farming</title>
		<content>   Farming is the main activity in the 
 Shiskine valley. The land is used by  
 fifteen different farmers. The farms  
 are all quite small, most having      
 fields on the valley floor given over 
 to grass, rising to hill grazing for  
 sheep and beef cattle on either side  
 of the valley.                        
   Dairy farming is the most common,   
 but some have beef cattle, and many   
 have sheep as well. Most of the dairy 
 herds are Friesians and the milk is   
 collected by tanker and taken to the  
 Kilmory Creamery for making into the  
 famous Arran dunlop cheese.           
   Hay is still made, but silage has   
 become much more common. Other crops  
 grown are barley and turnips for      
 winter feed, and a few potatoes as a  
 cash crop. One farmer specialises in  
 soft fruit growing, and another in    
 market gardening.                     </content>
