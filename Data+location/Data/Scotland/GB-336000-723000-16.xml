		<content> At 07:00 on Sunday morning,12th May   
 1985 I got up and dressed before going
 downstairs to join my family.Our      
 visitors,including baby Thomas had    
 breakfast with us of bacon and fried  
 eggs.After,we went,with our dog,for a 
 walk.We returned home at 10:30.We     
 decided to go to Perth to Elco        
 Castle,and had a picnic in the grounds
 .We returned home by 14:00 and I      
 erected my tent in the garden and     
 played with my friend till tea,which  
 consisted of roast chicken,roast      
 potatoes,boiled potatoes,battered     
 leeks,bread sauce,lemon stuffing,     
 followed by fresh fruit salad and     
 cream.I washed my hair at 19:00 and   
 then went to bed.
