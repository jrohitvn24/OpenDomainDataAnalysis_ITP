 are cows and there are 2 bulls,and 78 
 calves.The farmer grows most of his   
 own crops mainly oats,barley,turnip   
 and grass.He owns 162 hectares of     
 land.In spring he has to{calf}the     
 cows,{plough}the fields,{sow}the crops
 and{spray}the fields.Then in summer he
 has to finish spraying the fields,{cut

 In autumn they are involved in the
