 1876. The present minister came in    
 1970. In 1886 the manse was built.The 
 church has central heating and two    
 stained glass windows.There is a      
 senior and junior choir which sing to 
 the electric organ.Each sunday Mrs    
 Currier brings flowers to brighten up 
 the church. There are 5 sunday school 
 teachers. The church bell is no longer
 used,instead they play a record on    
 sunday mornings and at weddings.      
  There are several Methodist, Jehovah 
 witness and Catholic families in  the 
 area.Two families go to Ba'hai        
 meetings.We sometimes have visits by  
 young people from Faith Acres Bible   
 School who come to school and tell us 
 Bible Stories and we sing songs with  
 them to a guitar ,like Have you got   
 the Sunshine Smile and Good News.
