		<content>  Part of{N.E.L.(National Engineering  
{Laboratory)}is in the North East of   
  our square.N.E.L.is the main         
 technology resource in East           
 Kilbride.The company is made up of    
 various buildings.Each building, or   
 divisions as they are known,          
 concentrates on a specific aspect of  
 engineering research, trying to       
 investigate ideas and improve them.   
 They all play a major roll in         
 tomorrow's technology.N.E.L's main    
 concerns are offshore structures and  
 operations, automation, process &amp;     
 machinery &amp; robotics.Most of their    
 high research skills are in demand by 
 other companies.They also take on     
 other kinds of problems like designing
 and testing.To shorten this,it's an
