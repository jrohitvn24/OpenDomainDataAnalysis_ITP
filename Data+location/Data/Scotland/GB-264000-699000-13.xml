		<content> We live in an agricultrural           
 community.A lot of people either own  
 farms or work on them.Dykes is a      
 privately owned agricultural workshop 
 and is situated on the Aberfoyle      
 road.There are a lot of haulage       
 businesses,one of which is Thomson's  
 which is based opposite the           
 school.Mr.Thomson carries hay,grain   
 and animal feed around                
 Britain.Bisset,a bigger firm,carries  
 nearly anything but livestock and he  
 travels around Europe. Paul's father  
 has two lorries and travels within    
 Scotland.Mr.Cartney goes often to     
 Skye,the Western Isles and sometimes  
 to England.Many people commute        
 daily.Some work in Stirling and some  
 even travel as far as Glasgow and     
 Edinburgh.
