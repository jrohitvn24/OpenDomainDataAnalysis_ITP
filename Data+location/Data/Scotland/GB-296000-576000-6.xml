		<content> The director of Roads &amp; Transport for 
 Dumfries &amp; Galloway said that the     
 proposed pedestrianisation of the town
 centre should be financed by 1986.The 
 work should start in 1987 and be      
 finished by 1988.The work will cost   
 roughly Â£430,000 half the money will  
 be paid in the financial year of 1986 
 and the other half in the next year.  
 The benefit of having the town centre 
 pedestrianised is that the shoppers   
 can mill about when shopping and visit
 more shops hence giving the           
 shopkeepers more business.            
 All the shop owners we spoke to said  
 that the pedestrianisation of the town
 centre would mean an increase in their
 number of customers.We surveyed 100   
 people,here are the results:          
 WOULD PREFER PEDEST.     79%          
 DIDN'T WANT  PEDEST.     18%          
 DIDN'T MIND               3%          </content>
