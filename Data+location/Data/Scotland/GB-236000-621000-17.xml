		<title>17WORKING FOR THE COMMUNITY</title>
		<content>   The buildings which figure largely  
 in the lives of people of Dalmilling  
 and Whitletts are{the church, local   
{schools and the community centre.}All 
 of these help to bring together people
 who,in their own special ways,provide 
 starting points,which lead to helping 
{the elderly,}playing an active role in
{play groups}for young children or even
 giving time or skill to give children 
 of school age and teenagers the chance
 to develop skills and pleasure gained 
 from taking part in{games}and in{sport
{related activities.                   
   Some of the club groups are funded  
 by grants from{Strathclyde Regional   
{Council}or from the{Sports Council.   
 This money helps to provide the pieces
 of apparatus and equipment which are  
 necessary for particular activities.
