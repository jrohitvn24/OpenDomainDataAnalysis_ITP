		<title>17HEALTH  MEDICAL &amp; DENTAL</title>
		<content> Mr Bennie is our very popular school  
 dentist. He has a dental unit in our  
 playground and visits our school every
 Monday. A dental hygenist comes once  
 every fortnight to check our teeth for
 plaque. Mr Bennie told us that most of
 us will have good teeth when we leave 
 school, but in 15 years time, 3-12 out
 of the 31 in our class will have no   
 teeth. Sometimes the school doctor and
 nurse give us a routine medical check-
 up. There is one doctor in Dornoch. He
 consults every day from 9 until 11am. 
 There are several district nurses who 
 visit sick and elderly people, also   
 mothers and babies. You can buy many  
 medicines at the chemist and he makes 
 up the doctor's presciptions. There is
 a dental practice and chiropodist in  
 Dornoch. The nearest hospital is in   
 Golspie but often patients are sent to
 the better facilities in Inverness.   </content>
