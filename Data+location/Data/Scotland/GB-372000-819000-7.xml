		<content>  Traditionally education was held in  
 great respect in rural Aberdeenshire. 
 Today, education is an important      
 source of employment and stimulation  
 in the Inverurie area.                
  The block based aroung Burnhervie is 
 in the catchment area for Kellands    
 Primary School in Inverurie. This is  
 a modern  award winning school in a   
 heavily forested site of several      
 acres. Pupils from the block are      
 bussed in and out to school each day. 
  Secondary school pupils, those aged  
 over 11, travel each day to Inverurie 
 Academy, the senior school in the     
 area.                                 
  A very small part of the block to the
 south around Keithney, lies inside the
 catchment area for Alehousewells      
 Primary and Kemnay Academy.
