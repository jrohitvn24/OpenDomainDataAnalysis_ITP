		<title>04CREE BRIDGE,NEWTON STEWART</title>
		<content>   The Cree Bridge,the only road bridge
 in Newton Stewart,is situated in the  
 middle of the town.                   
   Newton Stewart and the{Cree Bridge  
 were possibly built where they were   
 because it was the nearest point from 
 the sea at which the{River Cree}could 
 be forded.                            
   As it was a dangerous river to cross
 in the winter townsfolk got together  
 and built a flimsy wooden bridge which
 lasted for sixty_one years until it   
 was washed away by a flood in 1806.   
   The granite bridge was designed by  
{John Rennie(1761-1821)}who also       
 designed the original Waterloo,London 
 and Southwark bridges.Work began in   
 1813.John Rennie was famous for his   
 bridge_designing and was offered a    
 knighthood,but refused.               
   The Cree Bridge links Newton Stewart
 with the small village of{Minnigaff.  </content>
