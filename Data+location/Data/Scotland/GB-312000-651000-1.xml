		<content>  The population at the last census in 
 1981 was 843 but a 1985 count of the  
 residents gives a figure nearer 1100. 
 Since 1950's there has been a gradual 
 increase in the demand for houses as  
 West Linton is a very desirable       
 commuter village that attracts people 
 with executive and professional       
 occupations who like to work in the   
 city and live in the country.         
 The village is only 7 miles from      
 Penicuik and 16 miles from Edinburgh. 
  As well as many local Scottish       
 people we have many English people who
 work for large international          
 firms,government departments etc. We  
 also have people living here from     
 Wales and Ireland.  Nearly all the    
 people are British.  We have no ethnic
 minorities.
