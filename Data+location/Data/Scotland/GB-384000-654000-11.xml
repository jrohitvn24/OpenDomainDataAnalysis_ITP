		<title>11CHIRNSIDE PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> We have a computer, calculators and   
 electronics kits, and soon we hope to 
 have an electronic keyboard in the    
 Primary department. The Special Unit  
 has a computer and an electronic      
 keyboard.                             
 Other people who work in the school   
 are a secretary, an auxiliary, a      
 janitor, 2 cleaners,and 3 canteen     
 ladies. The auxiliary takes dinner    
 duty, tapes radio programmes and helps
 children and teachers. The janitor and
 cleaners keep the school very tidy.   
 The canteen ladies provide main-course
 meals for 55 to 65 children. About the
 same number bring packed lunches.     
 School meals cost 47p.                
 We take part in several sports _      
 football, hockey, netball, basketball,
 badminton and athletics. Gymnastics   
 and Brownies are held after school.
