		<content>   The Gilmerton Post Office and small 
 shop, located at the most western side
 of the settlement, is essential to the
 community as it is the sole supplier  
 in the village.  It supplies pensions 
 and groceries to those who cannot     
 travel and convenience goods to other 
 village inhabitants.  As a shop it    
 sells limited groceries,              
 newspapers,cigarettes and sweets.     
 Some of the prices of the goods in    
 the shop are slightly higher than in  
 Crieff, but this is compensated for by
 the saving in the bus fare.  The shop 
 is also used by passing traffic as it 
 is situated on the side of the main   
 road.  Mrs. McKenzie, who has run the 
 Post Office for 20 years, runs it     
 mainly herself but in the summer      
 season employees some extra help when 
 there is more passing trade.
