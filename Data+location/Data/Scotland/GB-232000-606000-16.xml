		<title>16A WEEKEND WITH SAMANTHA</title>
		<content> Every Friday my brother and I stay    
 overnight at my grandparents' house.On
 Saturday morning we have breakfast at 
 8 o'clock,usually cereal,toast and tea
 or orange juice.Then we go swimming.  
 My little brother who is 5 is being   
 taught to swim by Papa and Gran. He   
 wears a plastic ring round his waist  
 to keep him afloat.After our swim Papa
 takes us home and we have lunch with  
 Mum and Dad which is usually a meaty  
 sandwich and a glass of milk.Saturday 
 afternoon is spent with our other     
 grandparents.We have dinner at night  
 in our own home then we watch         
 television until bedtime. On Sunday I 
 read or play games with my little     
 brother. In the summer we go down to  
 the boat which is berthed in Maidens  
 harbour.
