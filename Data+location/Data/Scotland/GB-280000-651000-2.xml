		<content> Quite near the school there is a farm 
 called the East Law farm.There are 17 
 fields in East Law.On the farm there  
 is a plough,a combine harvester,5     
 tractors and a machine for            
 distributing the feed to the animals. 
  There is 1 hired worker who helps the
 farmer,his son and wife to run the    
 farm.They usually buy their cattle at 
 local markets such as the ones at     
 Lanark and Hamilton.In ten months one 
 cow supplies 6000 litres of milk.There
 are two bulls,one dairy and one beef. 
 The cows that supply beef have white  
 heads.There are 400 cattle over all   
 and 130 of them are Fresian cows which
 supply milk.                          
  It costs Â£2450 to feed all the       
 animals a week. The farmer and his    
 workers rise at 5a.m.each morning and 
 finish work between 8 and 8.30.at     
 night.                                </content>
