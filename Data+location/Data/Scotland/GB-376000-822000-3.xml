   Because most of the housing in our  
 area is on new estates either council 
 or private,80% of the population is   
 young with children of school age.The 
 majority of householders are newcomers
 to the area and enjoy a relatively    
 high standard of living because of    
 high employment in oil and oil-related
 industries.Due to the nature of their 
 work the population tends to be       
 transient.                            
   In the rural parts of our block the 
 population is more of a sedentary     
 nature with their roots and culture   
 firmly embedded in the North-East of  
 Scotland.Several branches of the same 
 family live and work within the       
 vicinity with the resulting close knit
 community cohesiveness which is not   
 so apparent in the town.
