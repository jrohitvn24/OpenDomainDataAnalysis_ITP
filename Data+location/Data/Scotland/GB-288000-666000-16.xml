 oldest inhabited houses in Scotland.

 The people who live there own{32 acres
 of land.  It is about 1 mile out of   
 Blackridge.  We call it the{White     
{Gates}because the gates at the        
 entrance are white.  Bedlormie House  
 is supposed to have a{secret passage  
 which runs from Bedlormie House to    
 Bedlormie Farm, although people say   
 that it runs from Bedlormie House to  
 Westcraigs.  It was said that{Bonnie  
{Prince Charlie}used the passage to    
 escape from his enemies.  Bonnie      
 Prince Charlie was given hospitality  
 at Bedlormie and entertained there    
 as well.  It has 9 main rooms, 1      
 cloakroom, 2 bathrooms, 1 kitchen, 1  
 butlers pantry.  There is supposed to 
 be a{ghost}in Bedlormie House.
