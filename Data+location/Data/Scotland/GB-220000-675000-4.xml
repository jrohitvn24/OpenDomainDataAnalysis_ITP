		<content> Although there are no Military        
 Establishments in the area its        
 inhabitants are very aware of the     
 presence of neighbouring Military     
 Bases across the Water.               
 The American Polaris Missile          
 servicing and stores base is          
 situated in The Holy Loch.There are   
 also two British Naval concerns in    
 the area.The British Navy has a       
 large complex at Coulport which is    
 responsible the storage,maintenace    
 and supply of arms for the Submarine  
 Fleet.At Faslane on The Gare Loch     
 there is the Submarine Base of the    
 British Fleet.This paticular base     
 has often been the Target of Anti     
 nuclear Protest Groups.This           
 concetration of military              
 esablishments makes the whole area a  
 Prime target area in the event of     
 Nuclear Conflict.                     </content>
