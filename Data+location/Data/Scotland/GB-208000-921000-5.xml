		<title>05EASY ECONOMICS IN ASSYNT</title>
		<content> Economics in Assynt is served by two  
 establishments:- the Post Office and a
 branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland. 
 The Post Office was set up in 1876,   
 the first mails were telegraphed until
 1918. Today, our daily mail does not  
 arrive until teatime, arriving from   
 Lairg rail station some 48 miles away!
 The Post Office offers all the usual  
 facilities eg:- Savings Banks etc.    
 Rural Post-buses serve the other      
 communities from Lochinver. The Bank  
 was established in 1905 &amp; is the only 
 Bank for many miles. With a staff of  
 six, it looks after 600 local accounts
 &amp; the needs of the Fishing Industry   
 and the Tourists. The Bank here has a 
 tiny sub-office in Drumbeg, open once 
 a week. The Bank's services have this 
 year been part-computerised to bring  
 it into line with those in the towns &amp;
 cities. Distance is a problem still!  </content>
