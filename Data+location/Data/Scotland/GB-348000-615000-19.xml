 the Centre a year. It is open 5O weeks
 a year and 7 days a week. They have   
 facilities to play football, snooker, 
 Pool, table tennis, darts and to      
 practise sports like Judo. There are  
 also an assortment of table games like
 cards, chess and dominoes which       
 members can book. As well as these    
 games there is a bar for older members
 of the Centre. The Youth Centre has   
 changed slightly over the years but   
 still fulfils a useful function in    
 Hawick. It gives the local youths the 
 opportunity to fill their spare time  
 constructively.                       </content>
