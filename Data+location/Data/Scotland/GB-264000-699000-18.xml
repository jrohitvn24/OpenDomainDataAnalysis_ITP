		<title>18THORNHILL HOUSING</title>
		<content> In the village of Thornhill the houses
 vary from old to new and from little  
 to large. There are bungalows,        
 cottages and many houses with two     
 storeys. In Main Street the majority  
 of houses are about 100 years old. In 
 Low Town and Back Yetts most are      
 newer.Sometimes the bigger gardens are
 divided and someone builds a house in 
 half of the feu. Two of the listed    
 buildings have been turned into an    
 antique shop. One of the cottages     
 which used to be a butcher's shop is  
 now a grocer's. We have counted 185   
 houses, 5 retail shops, 2 hotels, 1   
 Post Office and 2 agricultural        
 workshops, and ofcourse 1 school.
