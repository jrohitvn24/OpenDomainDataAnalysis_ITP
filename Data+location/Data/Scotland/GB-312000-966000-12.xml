		<title>12THE NEW FURNITURE STORE</title>
		<content>    {A   large   furniture shop}has    
 just extended its premises in{Thurso  
 to 16,000 sq.feet and also added      
 storage space of 10,000 sq. feet so   
 giving our part of the town of{Thurso 
 a large, modern furniture store.      
   There are twelve employees. They in-
 clude managers, sales assistants,     
 carpet fitters and delivery men.      
   Most of the furniture is British    
 made and some is actually manufactured
 by the company. In the electrical     
 department we found many items        
 imported from Japan.                  
   The firm attracts customers from a  
 wide area and has even delivered to   
 Belgium.                              
   Prices are very competitive. Some of
 the prices noted were a leather suite 
 reduced from Â£2500 to Â£1800 for the   
 opening sale, a double bed at Â£169 and
 a micro wave oven at Â£223.            </content>
