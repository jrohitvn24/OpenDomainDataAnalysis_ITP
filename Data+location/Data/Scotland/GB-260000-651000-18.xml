		<content>   A local shopping survey was done at 
 the Greenhills Shopping Precinct on   
 19th June 1985.We interviewed twelve  
 people.Nine of the people we          
 interviewed lived in Greenhills,two   
 lived in Whitehills and one lived in  
 Gardenhall.Five people said they did  
 their daily shopping at the Greenhills
 Shops.We asked them if the shops were 
 adequate and ten people answered NO.We
 also asked them what other shops they 
 would like to see,if any.Three of the 
 twelve said that they would like a    
 bank,one person said a fruit shop,four
 people a supermarket and one person a 
 cafe.We asked them if they only used  
 these shops because it was convenient.
 Eleven people said yes and one person 
 used them because she liked them.All  
 of the people said that these shops   
 are more expensive than at the Town   
 Centre.                               </content>
