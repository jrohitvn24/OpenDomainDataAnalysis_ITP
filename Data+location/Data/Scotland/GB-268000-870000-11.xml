 Because it was and still is an        
 agricultural area relatively few      
 houses are to be found:in the past    
 only farm houses and farm cottages.   
 Nor was there a local village or      
 hamlet.However over the past 10-15    
 years there has been considerable     
 private house building,particularly   
 around the Newmore School (GR         
 697717).As a result there are now two 
 distinct types of houses - the old    
 farmhouse/cottage and the new bunglow.
 The old houses are built of the local 
 sanstone,have slate roofs and wooden  
 sash windows; the houses have two     
 storeys but the cottages only one.Over
 the years many have been modernised   
 and the evidence is obvious: new      
 extensions atthe front (porch) and/or 
 the rear(kitchen/bathroom),new        
 windows,an upstairs and the like.Often</content>
