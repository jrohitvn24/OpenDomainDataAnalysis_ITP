		<content> West Linton primary school is a state 
 school for children from 5-12 years of
 age. We do not pay fees. It is a semi 
 rural school 16 miles from Edinburgh. 
 The roll is about 160 and we have 7   
 teachers including the headmaster. We 
 also have specialist teachers for art,
 music,sewing and physical education.  
   The building is large and has been  
 modernised a few years ago. We have a 
 large gymnasium which is sometimes    
 used for village activities.eg,dances.
   We have a school kitchen that cooks 
 for us and for the old people from the
 the village who are supplid with      
 lunches. Many children do not take    
 school lunches but bring their own    
 packed lunches with them.             
   Transport is provided for children  
 who live in outlying districts.       
   When we leave this school we go to  
 Peebles High School, 14 miles away.   </content>
