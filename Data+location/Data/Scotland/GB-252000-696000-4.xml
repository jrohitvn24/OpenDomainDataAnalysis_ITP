		<title>04"FOUNTAIN FORESTRY" GARTMORE</title>
		<content> In comparison to the Forestry         
 Commission,{Fountain Forestry}is a    
 Scottish-based company which manages  
 forests for various owners in         
 Scotland, Canada and America. Around  
 Gartmore they use Fir Hill, Crinigart 
 Woods, and Easter and Wester Cow Park 
 (known locally as the "Wee Wood").    
 As the soil is fertile and the sites  
 sheltered many trees grow to 60 years 
 old, with some even 100 years old.    
 Sitka Spruce, Douglas Fir and Scots   
 Pine are grown, but some{deciduous    
 woods are also planted, the trees     
 being replaced with a similar variety 
 where possible. Larch, beech, birch,  
 oak and rowan are grown for wood to   
 make furniture (until recently, the   
 birch being "turned" to make cotton   
 reels), while the{coniferous}wood is  
 at present sent to Norway and Sweden  
 to make paper and chipboard.          </content>
