		<title>01Wideford Hill St Ola</title>
		<content> This area of survey is immediately to 
 the north west of Kirkwall.   It is   
 dominated by Wideford Hill which is   
 225 metres high, sloping down to the  
 sea on the north side.   The lower    
 part is farmed.   The top of          
 Wideford Hill is covered with numerous
 radio aerials and microwave           
 telecommunications equipment.   It    
 provides a good viewing point for all 
 of Orkney.   To the east Wideford Hill
 slopes down more gently with Kirkwall 
 at its base.   The lower slopes are   
 intensively farmed.   At the edge of  
 Kirkwall is an 18 hole golf course and
 the old war time airbase at Hatston.  
 This is now an industrial estate and  
 is the site for many light industrial 
 firms.
