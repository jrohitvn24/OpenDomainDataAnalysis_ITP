		<title>18ST FITTICK'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The remains of St Fittick's Church lie
 due west off St Fitticks Road.The four
 walls of the church are still standing
 but it has succumbed to the elements  
 since falling into disuse in the early
 19th Century.Positioned in the north- 
 wall is the window specially built    
 to allow the lepers from the local    
 colony to watch the service without   
 being seen or coming into contact with
 the congregation.In the graveyard,    
 which has been badly vandalised, are  
 austere tablets to those who lost     
 their lives at sea and also the more  
 extravagent gravestones to those who  
 survived and made their fortune       
 especially as wine or cloth merchants.
 The oldest parts of the ruin are      
 thought to have been built in 1242 by 
 David de Bernham,Bishop of St Andrews,
 in honour of St Fittick who was washed
 ashore at Nigg Bay in the 7th century.</content>
