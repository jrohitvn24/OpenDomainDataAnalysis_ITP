		<content> The name {CRAILING}may come from      
 Crailyn meaning brisk pool-refer      
 ing to the Oxnam Water.{ECKFORD}means 
 oak ford-still recognised on the      
 Teviot. The earliest evidence of man  
 is in Eckford where Burial Cists and  
 the site of an ancient dwelling have  
 been found. Eckford was once a sizable
 village. There was a Pele Tower and   
 another nearby at Moss Tower. They and
 the village were destroyed by English 
 invaders in the 1500's. In the 1700's 
 local farmers were noted Improvers.   
 They enclosed fields,drained and      
 manured them and grew crops such as   
 cereals,flax,turnips and even tobacco.
 A marel pit was dug which is now      
 Wooden Loch. Wooden Hill was first    
 planted with trees then. Twice weekly 
 coaches between Hawick and Kelso ran  
 along a turnpike providing            
 communication.                        </content>
