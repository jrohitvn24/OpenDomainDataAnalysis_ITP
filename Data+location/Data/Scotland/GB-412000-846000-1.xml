		<title>01Peterhead, Aberdeenshire</title>
		<content> Peterhead is a town of contrasts. It  
 is known as the 'Bloo Town' (Blue     
 Town) because it is so cold, but is   
 built of pink granite. The main       
 shopping area contrasts between new   
 concrete buildings and modernised     
 traditional buildings. There is a     
 contrast between the bustle           
 surrounding the very busy harbour and 
 the fact that unemployment in         
 Peterhead is about 13%. There is a    
 contrast between the wealthy,         
 oil-related 'incomers' and the poverty
 of the locals who are not involved in 
 fishing or oil. There are about TEN   
 different religious denominations     
 amongst the indigenous population of  
 Peterhead. There is contrast between  
 the 'grand' private houses away from  
 the sea and the smaller fishermens    
 houses nearer the sea.
