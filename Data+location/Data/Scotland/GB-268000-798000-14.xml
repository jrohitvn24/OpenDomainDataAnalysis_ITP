 In Newtonmore the traditional place of
 play is{The Eilan,}situated beneath   
 the commanding hill of Craig Dhu, and 
 is close to the confluence of the Spey
 and the Calder south of the village.  
{Newtonmore Camanachd Club}was formally
 constituted about a hundred years ago.
 The club first won the Camanachd Cup, 
 the trophy for the championship of    
 Scotland, in 1907 and they have since 
 repeated that feat on another 26      
 occasions, their nearest rivals, Kyles
 Athletic and Kingussie, on 19 and 8   
 occasions respectively. The club has  
 an equally illustious record in the   
 other major honours of thr game.      
 Newtonmore Primary School is the vital
 nursery for what is the obsessive     
 interest of the local community.      </content>
