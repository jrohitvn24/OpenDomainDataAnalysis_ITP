		<content> It's my job at home to do the         
 gardening.  Every second weekend I cut
 the grass.  Through the week I dig the
 garden.  I am trying to grow          
 tomatoes, onions, lettuces, spinach   
 and marrows.  I have five rows of     
 potatoes planted.                     
 I also help with odd jobs around the  
 house by washing the dishes and       
 keeping my room tidy.  Sometimes I    
 help my dad on the farm.  Through     
 harvest I help.  I sit on the combine 
 and sometimes I have to sit on the    
 barley bin because it sometimes       
 overflows.  Then I help stack the     
 bales in the sheds.  During silage I  
 help with the choppers, switching     
 their engines on and off.  Usually I  
 just sit in the tractors.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
