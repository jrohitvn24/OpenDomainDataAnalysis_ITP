		<content> The area offers little in the way of  
 entertainment for the under 18's but  
 their is a youth club which meets     
 during the winter and an institute    
 where anyone can play snooker or      
 badminton.The village also has a      
 football team for under 12's,under16's
 and an amateur team which plays in the
 Dumfries League.There is a bowling    
 club and,for the O.A.P.'s,an Evergreen
 Club but this is as far as            
 entertainment facilities go.Shops tend
 to be limited in their selections     
 and,because of carriage charges,more  
 expensive than normal.This means that 
 most people do their main buying out  
 of Moniaive.Tourism helps the area and
 many visitors come each year to       
 fish,walk or simply enjoy the         
 scenery.A preparity school called     
 Crawfordton House is 2mls.out of the  
 village but very few locals attend it.</content>
