 The Abernyte Area is a happy,friendly 
 neighbourhood with one small village  
 and two tiny hamlets.The area has two 
 different kinds of land, one third of 
 it flat, down on the Carse of Gowrie  
 and two thirds hilly, on the Braes of 
 the Carse of the Sidlaw Hills.The land
 rises from 15 metres at the Milk Bar  
 to 254 metres at Abernyte Hill,its    
 highest point.There is one main stream
 crossing the area flowing from        
 Pitmiddle Hill down to the Tay.       
 It is a farming area with rich soil   
 for mixed farming on the hill and     
 fruit farming on the lower land.As    
 well as being a farming area many     
 people, who live in the area work in  
 Dundee or Perth.It is a popular place 
 for people from Perth and Dundee to   
 come for drives,picnics and walks.
