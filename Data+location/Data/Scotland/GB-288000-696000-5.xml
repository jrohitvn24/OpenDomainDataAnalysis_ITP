		<title>05THE GLEN AT ALVA</title>
		<content> The Alva{Glen}is between Torry and    
 Nebit. About 100 years ago the lower  
 part of the Glen was specially laid   
 out with paths,bridges,trees,and      
 flowering shrubs for the local people 
 to enjoy their{recreation.}There is a 
 memorial to Mr John Eadie who was born
 in Alva. There are two waterfalls. The
 Glen also leads to the Ochil{Hills}and
 to the source of the Devon. People can
 also fish in the Dam.                 
  The Glen has paths including a zig   
 zag path up to the back of the Glen   
 and a square piece of land where the  
 band used to play. A burn separates   
 the Glen into two. It is part of the  
 beautiful Alva{landscape.}
