		<content>{Landscape:}                           
 The area is composed of low{hills}    
 (180m) with about one third tree      
 cover.  There are both scattered      
 mature deciduous and plantations of   
 pine, also there is much scrub birch  
 on uncultivated land.  There are      
 conifer plantations at the Bell Wood  
 5498 and on Queen's Hill 5200.  The   
{river}Dee flows along the south edge  
 of the area with many meanders and    
 braided islands.  The Tarland burn    
 also flows from the north west of the 
 area exiting from the south edge.     
 There are small artificial{Lochs}(Loch
 of Aboyne and at Rose Hill).  To the  
 East of Aboyne Loch the low land is   
 marshy with scrub birch and alongside 
 this the line of the old railway can  
 be seen.  There are many scattered    
 farm buildings and the settlement of  
 Aboyne in 5298.                       </content>
