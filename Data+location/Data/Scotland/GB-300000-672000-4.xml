		<content> Mr and Mrs Taylor own Wester Ochiltree
 farm.The farm is a fairly large one of
 507 acres.Mr Taylor keeps livestock   
 and grows crops as well.He grazes 153 
 acres,uses 254 acres for grain,127    
 acres for hay and silage and 60 acres 
 for rape,which fattens 1200 lambs.    
  Mr Taylor keeps 200 beef cattle in a 
 flying herd,which means that he buys  
 and sells but does not breed any      
 stock.He sells his stock at an auction
 market in Stirling not in the         
 slaughterhose in Linlithgow.          
  Mr Taylor enjoys living on the farm  
 and thinks the advantages are the     
 peace and quiet.The disadvantages     
 are not getting the public services   
 that others have.                     
  Mr Taylor employs 2 farmhands to help
 him.The special feature on his farm is
 the Peace Knoll,which was an Iron Age 
 Fort.                                 </content>
