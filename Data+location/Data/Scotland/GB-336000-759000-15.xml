		<title>15The Devil's Stone,Cortachy</title>
		<content>   In the{River South Esk}by{Cortachy  
{Church}is a huge boulder known        
 locally as the{Devil's}Stone.There are
 two stories as to how it came to be   
 there.                                
   The first one is that the{Devil}was 
 angry with{the minister}for           
 continually preaching that the Devil's
 way was wrong and so he hurled the    
 huge stone from nearby{Tulloch        
{Hill}hoping to kill him.Apparently he 
 missed and the stone crashed into the 
 river.                                
   The second version says the stone   
 was thrown by the Devil,angry at the  
 building of an earlier church on the  
 present site.Again he missed.         
   Another odd thing about the stone is
 that people swear that if it is       
 submerged by the river,a member of the
{Airlie}family will die.
