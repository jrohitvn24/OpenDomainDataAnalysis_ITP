		<title>11Ardross Castle</title>
		<content> The castle was built between 1838-46, 
 taking eight years to build. It has 98
 rooms including bathrooms.            
 In 1910, the owners Perrins (of Lea &amp; 
 Perrins sauces) built a heated        
 swimming pool in the castle. It was   
 intended for th e use of family and   
 guests who got wet and cold whilst out
 deer-hunting.                         
 The largest room was the Great Hall   
 which was used for banquets. There    
 have been many County balls and       
 Celebration balls held in the Great   
 Hall.                                 
 When the Perrins owned the castle they
 employed about 22 gardeners and a     
 further 22 staff working in the house.
 Even today there are still peacocks in
 the grounds.                          
 Decorative turrets were built, but    
 many are false.
