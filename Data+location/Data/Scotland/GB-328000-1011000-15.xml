		<content>  The present church of Stenness dates 
 from 1906. The oldest gravestone in   
 the churchyard dates from the 17th.   
 century. The old name of the church is
 the church of the Holy Cross and the  
 possibility that a holy cross stood   
 here is real for not far to the west  
 is the site of the pagan Stone of Odin
 beside the Stones of Stenness.The     
 church has recently been restored, a  
 new outside toilet built and car-park 
 made; a new graveyard lies to the     
 south-east. The minister of the       
 church, Rev. Williams has just retired
 after 40 years service and the new    
 minister is Rev. Thomas Clark. The    
 parishes of Orphir to the south and   
 Stenness are joined together under one
 ministry. The church continues to play
 a very active part in the parish of   
 Stenness.
