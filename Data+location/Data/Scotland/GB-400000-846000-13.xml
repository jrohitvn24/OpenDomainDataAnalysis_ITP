		<title>13A Pheasantry</title>
		<content> He has four types of pheasant.They are
 the yellow Golden pheasant,the Chinese
 ring neck the Melanistic,common       
 English and he has some cross         
 breeds.Mr Davidson does not mark his  
 birds for security.The cock weighs    
 about 7.7kg and the hen weighs about  
 6.6kg.The male has the fanciest tail  
 but the female's tail is the same     
 length as the male's and their tails  
 are about 60cm long.Pheasants start   
 laying eggs when they are a year      
 old.If the birds are caged they will  
 live for about 14 or 15 years but in  
 the wild they live about 6 years.     
 Pheasants eat wheat and drink lots of 
 water.Pheasant eggs are slightly      
 smaller than hen eggs.But they taste  
 just as good.Most people think that   
 the young female tastes the best.He   
 buys back the shot birds and exports  
 many of them to the continent.        </content>
