		<title>10MARYKIRK CHURCH 1</title>
		<content>    Marykirk Presbyterian Church is in 
 the parish of Aberluthnot.  Trees grow
 around the church.  It has big windows
 and inside, at the front, is the      
 pulpit which used to be on another    
 wall but now covers a lovely window.  
 Upstairs, is the church hall which is 
 5 years old.  There used to be a      
 gallery where the hall is.  There is  
 another room where the Sunday School  
 meets, a meeting room and a toilet.   
 The Church is about 200 years old.    
 The very first minister in 1474 was   
 John Chalmers, a Roman Catholic.  Now 
 you can see the ruins of the first    
 church in the old graveyard.  On the  
 way to Luthermuir, there is a new     
 cemetry.  Luthermuir is also part of  
 the parish.  The present minister is  
 Mr Blaikie.
