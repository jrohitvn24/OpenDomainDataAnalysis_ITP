		<title>03Family life in Laggan</title>
		<content> Families in Laggan work and play      
 together.With no available public     
 entertainment,old games are played at 
 home ie cludo,monopoly,playing        
 cards,darts.Most mothers who work     
 arrange their hours to be at home for 
 their children.No fathers work away   
 from home.Outings are always family   
 outings.Most homes have modern        
 equipment ,but children are still     
 encouraged to do tasks about the home 
 and garden.The policy of early to bed 
 and early to rise is applied in most  
 homes.The main family meal is in the  
 evening when all are present.T.V can  
 intrude on this family occaision and  
 ,indeed,T.V causes most arguments at  
 home.
