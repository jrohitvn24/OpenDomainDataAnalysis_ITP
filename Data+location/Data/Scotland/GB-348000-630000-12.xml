		<content> The farm of LINDEAN was a tenanted    
 farm until 1913, when its buildings   
 and fixed equipment were compulsorily 
 acquired-under the provisions of a new
 Smallholders (SCOTLAND) ACT- by the   
 then Board of Agriculture and resold  
 to 13 smallholders selected by the    
 Board. The farmlands remained the     
 property of the "laird", who received 
 annual rents.The original acres were  
 divided into holdings varying in size 
 between 7 and 170 acres.To provide a  
 dwelling for each smallholder 5 new   
 houses were built.With small          
 adjustments these arrangements        
 continued until the 1960's,when 8 of  
 the holdings were sold and            
 reconstituted as a ring-fence farm of 
 340 acres. Only one of the            
 original holdings survives in anything
 like its planned size and fulfilling  
 its initial purpose.                  </content>
