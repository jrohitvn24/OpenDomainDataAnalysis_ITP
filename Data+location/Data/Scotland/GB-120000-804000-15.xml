 Unless a new family come to the island
 the school will shut again in 4 years 
 time as there are no younger children 
 on the island.                        
 The classroom is part of the house    
 itself. There are 2 downstairs rooms  
 one of which is the kitchen/living    
 room the other is the classroom.The   
 children have to use the teacher's    
 bathroom for water and toilet         
 facilities. However the school itself 
 has all the facilities that a mainland
 school has, such as a television and  
 computer. Pupils also have a lot of   
 individual attention.
