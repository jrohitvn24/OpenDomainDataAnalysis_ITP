		<title>02Landscape around Fearn</title>
		<content> The area within our grid is basically 
 flat farmland.Few trees are evident   
 but many roads are lined with beech   
 hedges.The verges also contain whins, 
 wild brambles and cow parsley but     
 these are cut back during the         
 summer.Because of the flatness and the
 soil fertility field sizes have been  
 increased.Excessive rain and clay     
 soils also cause some fields to flood 
 at certain times of the year.The      
 village of Hill of Fearn stands out   
 because of its situation on a knoll.  
 It has remained a compact unit even   
 though many new council houses have   
 been built in recent years.Arabella   
 can hardly be described as a          
 village-it's really a cluster of      
 houses which have arisen because of   
 its situation at a crossroads.
