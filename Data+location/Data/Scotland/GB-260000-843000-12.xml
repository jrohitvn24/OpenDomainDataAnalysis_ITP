    My dad is the only British Telecom 
 man in the area. If he gets a call-out
 he takes the person's phone number and
 address and goes there. He sometimes  
 has to replace phones. When he is at  
 work he has only one break from 12.00 
 to 12.15 pm. Dad works from 8 am to 4 
 pm. When he comes home on a Thursday, 
 he takes me to dancing in Inverness.  
    Sometimes my dad has to work on a  
 Saturday, which he doesn't like. He   
 has also been away on courses to learn
 more about new telephones. These last 
 for one or two weeks and have taken   
 place in Edinburgh and Harrogate.     
 Dad takes his holidays during the     
 school holidays and looks after my    
 brother and me. Sometimes when dad is 
 working mum takes us into town and we 
 meet him during his break.
