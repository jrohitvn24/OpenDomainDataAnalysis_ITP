		<title>01DALRY - INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> Dalry, with just over 5000 people, is 
 located in the Garnock Valley. 19th   
 Century iron mining led to the growth 
 of an industrial community within a   
 farming area and the slag heaps remain
 a feature of the landscape. Many Dalry
 men worked in the nearby Glengarnock  
 steelworks till they closed, leaving a
 major unemployment problem in the     
 Valley.Ryeside Mills, previously      
 employing women making ladies'clothes,
 has also closed. The major employer in
 the town is Roche Chemicals,a Swiss   
 company making pharmaceuticals,       
 including Vitamin C. Many Dalry people
 travel to Irvine New Town, Hunterston 
 or Glasgow to work.It is a close-knit 
 community with many organisations, but
 with close ties with neighbouring     
 towns.The surrounding farmland is used
 mainly for traditional dairying and   
 stockrearing.                         </content>
