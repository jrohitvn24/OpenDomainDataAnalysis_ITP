		<content> This  block consists largely of       
 rolling, rather unspectacular hills,  
 heather covered and rising at several 
 points to heights of just under 500m. 
 Along the western edge ad round the   
 n/e corner runs a narrow strip of     
 farmland. Average altitude of this    
 farmland is about 250m and it is      
 mainly kept under rotation crops with 
 turnips grain, grass, the main object 
 being the rearing of beef cattle. In  
 some parts there is a predominance of 
 rotation grass. The cultivated land   
 rises from west to east, gradually to 
 meet edge of moorland,although there  
 are some forestry plantaitons along   
 this edge. The moor or hill land      
 extends eastwards to extreme edge of  
 block. In general the area is adapted 
 to grouse shooting but there is little
 other use for the land and there is no
 habitation on the hilly part          </content>
