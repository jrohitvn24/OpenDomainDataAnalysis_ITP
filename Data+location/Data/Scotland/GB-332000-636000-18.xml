		<title>18ST.RONANS WELLS INNERLEITHEN</title>
		<content> The Doo (Doves) Well on the slopes of 
 Lee Pen was known to the local people 
 long before its mineral waters were   
 analysed in 1777 and Sir Walter       
 Scott's novel St. Ronan's Well made it
 famous in 1834.Once it was thought    
 that Innerleithen would become as well
 known as Harrogate as a Spa.Crowds    
 flocked to drink the waters and the   
 population rose into thousands but the
 Hydropathic Hotel was built in Peebles
 and so fame as a Spa passed us by.    
 Visitors still take the pleasant walk 
 up the hill,resting on seats placed so
 they can enjoy beautiful views over   
 the town.The Custodian will show you  
 the well in her garden.You can drink  
 the mineral water in the Pavilion and 
 sign the visitor's book.You will see  
 that about two hundred people visit   
 the well each year from places like   
 U.S.A. ,Canada and Australia.         </content>
