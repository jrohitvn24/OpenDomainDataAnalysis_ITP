		<content> Each year, as in many Royal Burghs in 
 South Scotland, Sanquhar elects three 
 principals - the Cornet, his Lass, and
 their "protector" the Ensign - to lead
 the Riding of the Marches. During the 
 week-long festivities the March Riding
 Standard is flown over the town and   
 there is a variety of activities for  
 all ages. On the Saturday, the Burgh  
 Piper rouses the townsfolk at 6am; at 
 8am the Cornet and his party are sworn
 in before setting off at the head of a
 cavalcade of riders to inspect the    
 town's boundaries. On his return, the 
 Cornet reports on the condition of the
 Marches, the Sanquhar Queen is crowned
 and then follows a day of outdoor     
 entertainment (parades, sports, massed
 bands,funfair) ending with a fireworks
 display at 10pm. Many of the riders   
 are Principals from other towns with  
 similar festivities.                  </content>
