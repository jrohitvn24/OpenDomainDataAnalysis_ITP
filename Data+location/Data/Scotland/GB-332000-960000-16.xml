		<title>16EDUCATION IN KEISS</title>
		<content>   There has been a school in Keiss for
 more than 220 years. The school today 
 has 3 teachers with 63 pupils coming  
 from Keiss, Auckengill and Lyth.  We  
 have visiting teachers of music, art, 
 P.E, and needlework for part of each  
 year, and a remedial teacher comes    
 each week. Two thirds of the children 
 stay for lunch which is cooked in the 
 school.A two course meal costs 55p.   
   The school opens at 9.50,and shuts  
 at 4.00pm, in order to fit in with    
 buses. Lunchtime lasts 55 minutes.    
   Favourite games in the playground   
 include Army (a war game), football   
 (which is played by the older boys and
 girls), tig, and skipping (played by  
 the girls).                           
   This year the school had to close   
 early 6 times because the snow was    
 making the roads slippery &amp; difficult.
   The school year is 40 weeks long.   </content>
