		<title>09A CARNOUSTIE FAMILY'S DAY.</title>
		<content>   A typical day in the life of a      
 family in this area might be something
 like the following.                   
   The family consists of{mother,      
{father}and their two children,{Daniel 
 aged 14 and{Clare}aged 9.  Father     
 works as an{Insurance agent}in the    
 nearby city of Dundee, while mother   
 is a{Modern Languages teacher}at the  
 local High School.  Daniel attends the
 High School, while Clare attends      
 Primary School.                       
   Mother is first to rise in the      
 morning, about 7am. and she prepares  
 breakfast for the rest of the         
 family.  Everyone lends a hand with   
 the washing-up, the children tidy     
 their bedrooms and all are ready to   
 leave home by 8.30am.  Daniel and     
 Clare have lunch at school, as does   
 mother, since she can use her lunch   
 hour to catch up on some marking.     </content>
