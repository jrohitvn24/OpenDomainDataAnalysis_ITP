		<title>04Durie Farm.</title>
		<content>      Durie Farm is situated south-east
 of {Durie House}and south of{Ladyhill 
 plantation.The farm is part of the    
 1,000 acre Durie Estate owned by      
 Mr.Peter Christie.The farm buildings  
 consist of a farm house,a cowshed,a   
 stable,an implement shed and doocot.  
   The farm has between 150-300 cattle 
  which are stopped from entering the  
 house and grounds by cattle grids.The 
 main crops are wheat,barley and       
 rye.The barley is sent to a Scottish  
 based Canadian firm ,to be made into  
 whisky.Once when the fields were so   
 muddy that the tractor got bogged down
 so he employed a New Zealand pilot    
 based at an Edinburgh airport to spray
 his crops.Mr. Christie thought that he
 was flying too low and was going to   
 hit the electricity pylons.After every
 flight he had to return to Edinburgh  
  to refuel.                           </content>
