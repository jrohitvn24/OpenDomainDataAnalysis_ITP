		<content> Boats brought supplies to Inchkeith   
 from the early days of the lighthouse,
 visiting it four times a month and    
 twice on Sundays, so that the         
 lightkeepers could go to church. The  
 boat men were usually fishermen or    
 otherwise unoccupied lightkeepers.    
 Communications between the island and 
 shore have greatly improved over the  
 years. Boats and casual visitors are  
 more frequent, there is a helicopter  
 landing pad in the lighthouse         
 courtyard and there is also a direct  
 telephone line to the island. On the  
 island the lightkeepers use an old    
 tractor as a means of transport       
 between the lighthouse and harbour.   
 The improvement of communications     
 between the island and mainland has   
 also had disadvantages - vandals have 
 actually come out in boats and smashed
 windows, spray-painted walls etc.     </content>
