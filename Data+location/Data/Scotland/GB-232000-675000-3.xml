		<content>    Jean Watson was a servant in a     
 large house called Whitehill of       
 Keppoch in Cardross. She was accused  
 of stealing a piece of tongue from her
 master so she ran away from the house.
    She reached the swollen burn of    
 Auchenfroe which she tried to cross.  
 She nearly drowned but eventually made
 it, reaching London. There she married
 a shipbroker named Moore. She became  
 wealthy and sent money for a bridge to
 be built in Cardross over the burn.   
 Today the bridge can be seen with two 
 special stones in it. On one is       
 inscribed the motto of Cardross,{"Not 
{we, but God."} The other bears the    
 armorials of the Montgomery family.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
