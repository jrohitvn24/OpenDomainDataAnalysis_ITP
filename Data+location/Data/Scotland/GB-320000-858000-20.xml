		<content>  On the banks of the River Lossie a   
 wasp bike was hidden beneath a small  
 part of the bank where the river had  
 eaten it away. We walked along the    
 bank and found a birds nest in the    
 bank which we couldn't identify but   
 the egg shells were beneath the nest. 
 The eggs were small, white with red   
 dots. There was a small weir on the   
 river. At Cloddach Quarry we saw a    
 large tree which had been dug up. It  
 was a black oak. It was very heavy.   
 The black oak was supposed to be 10000
 years old. We also found Giant Hogweed
 growing on the banks of the River     
 Lossie. This plant is very dangerous_ 
 if you touch it, your skin can be     
 badly blistered. Moray District       
 Council are trying to irradicate the  
 plant but they have to spray at       
 exactly the right time and this is    
 proving very difficult to get right.  </content>
