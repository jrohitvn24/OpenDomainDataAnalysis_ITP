		<title>18CRAMOND :Residents' Opinions</title>
		<content>{Cramond is a desirable residential    
 area. Most people come here for the   
 amenities of a garden suburb and for  
 the location as houses are near the   
 airport,Glasgow motorway,Forth Road   
 Bridge and the centre of Edinburgh.   
 People who moved here for the peace   
 and quiet don't find it peaceful      
 enough as road and air traffic are    
 noisy problems. The rates are the     
 residents' only other source of       
 annoyance. Mostly the houses are      
 pleasant detached buildings in their  
 own gardens and the local schools are 
 known as excellent centres of         
 education. Most residents have one or 
 two cars. There are plenty of         
 petrol stations. For those without    
 cars transport is difficult with  only
 one regular bus passing through. There
 is a demand for a better provision.   
 Shopping facilities could be better.  </content>
