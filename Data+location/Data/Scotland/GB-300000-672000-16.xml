		<content> Beecraigs country park has 500 acres  
 of trees.Most of the trees are        
 coniferous they are Norway spruce,    
 sitka , silverfir spruce,lodgepole    
 pine, hemlock and larch.              
 Several forestry workers care for the 
 trees and work at thinning out the    
 thickest areas and planting young     
 trees in other parts of the forest.   
 There is a sawmill very near the park 
 where the wood from the park is turned
 into fence posts.                     
 Some parts of the park have broad     
 leaved trees such as beech, birch,    
 sycamore, and elder growing. This part
 of the woodland provides a home for   
 many birds and grey squirrels.        
 Badgers ,foxes and roe deer also live 
 in the wooded places in the park.     
 There are several way_marked walks    
 through the woods.
