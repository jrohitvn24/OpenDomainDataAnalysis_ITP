		<content>{A TYPICAL DAY IN MY MUM'S LIFE        
 My mother is the village postmistress.
 she is not fat like you imagine but   
 young and nice looking.Her day starts 
 before 8 0'clock.She gets the post    
 office books ready while my dad and   
 brother and I get our breakfasts.I    
 help my mum take out the sweets and   
 cards to the post office.             
     Monday and Tuesday are her busy   
 days because of pension.She waits in  
 the house for customers after she puts
 up the open sign.If no one comes she  
 does housework or gardening.We go home
 for lunch and my mum talks mostly     
 about what the customers have said.   
                     In the afternoons 
 house work or post office work,or     
 preparing our dinner .At night she    
 kitts and watches televishion.        
       she goes to the W.R.I sometimes 
 and plays Badminton and jogs.         </content>
