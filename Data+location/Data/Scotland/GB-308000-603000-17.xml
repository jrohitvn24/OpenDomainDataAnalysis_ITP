		<title>17UPPER ANNANDALE EDUCATION</title>
		<content>   Moffat Academy is an example of a   
 dying species-an all-through Burgh    
 school.There has been a school on the 
 site(N.end of the town)since 1834,the 
 present since 1933.Several modern     
 extensions have allowed the school to 
 adapt to changing needs.The Academy is
 now the only school in the town,the   
 culmination of a process started by   
 the 1872 Education Act.Some 20 schools
 have been identified in and around the
 town in the last 100 years.Several    
 died out by the turn of the century as
 the Academy gained the confidence of  
 more parents.During the first half of 
 the century 7 rural schools closed,the
 children now travelling daily to the  
 Academy.Recently the last private     
 shool,an amalgam of 4 such,closed due 
 to a lack of support.The present      
 Academy has 420 pupils(aged from 5    
 to 16) and 33 teaching staff.         </content>
