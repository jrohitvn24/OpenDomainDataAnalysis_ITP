		<content>   Mr Keiller works with the{Forestry  
{Commission.}When we went to interview 
 him he gave us a lot of information.He
 told us that he intended to plant{    
{100,000}trees altogether. He would    
 manage this by planting{1000}trees a  
 day with his four workmates. The trees
 he was planting were{Sitka Spruce.}   
 Behind them were{Japanese Larch}      
 which are insect free. The young trees
 for planting are two years old. The   
 place where Mr Keiller was planting   
 the{Sitka Spruce}trees was the place  
 where he had planted them{40}years    
 before. The reason he was back        
 planting the{Sitka Spruce}is because  
 the{40}year old trees were blown down 
 last year. A big machine made holes{2 
{metres}apart for the men to put the   
 trees in. Mr Keiller has worked with  
 the{Forestry Commission}for more than{
{40}years.                             </content>
