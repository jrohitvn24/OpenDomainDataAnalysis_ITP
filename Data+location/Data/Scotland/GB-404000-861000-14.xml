		<title>14Calf Rearing &amp;Sheep Shearing</title>
		<content> Mr Ross (the farmer) owns about 80    
 calves. The calves start in Somerset  
 where they are born,then at 6 weeks of
 age they go to a calf rearer who feeds
 them milk,pellets,hay and water.At    
 this point they are all kept in pens  
 but on the last week they are freed   
 and are then put into one large pen   
 and the milk is stopped . At 9 weeks  
 of age they come to Mr Ross.They are  
 once again put into one big pen and   
 are fed pellets, hay and water.       
 The sheep in the farm are not owned by
 Mr Ross but by his son Brian. Mr Ross 
 did own some sheep but recently sold  
 them. The sheep were sheared about a  
 week ago. The Rosses hire qualified   
 people to do this work, it takes about
 3 hours as there are only 50 sheep and
 20 lambs, but only the biggest lambs  
 are sheared. Mr Ross takes great pride
 in rearing his animals.               </content>
