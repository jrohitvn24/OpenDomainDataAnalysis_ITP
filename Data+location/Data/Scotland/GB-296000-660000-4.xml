 nursery school,five primary schools   
 and no secondary school.              
        The{nursery school,}which is   
 situated{in Stoneyburn,}takes pupils  
 of 3-5 years from both Addiewell and  
 Stoneyburn.For younger children who   
 don't go to nursey school there is a  
 pre-school playgroup three mornings a 
 week in Addiewell Community Wing.     
    Of the{5 primary schools}the       
 smallest is Woodmuir which serves the 
 village of Breich. It has only two    
 teachers.Both Addiewell and Stoneyburn
 have two primary schools one of which 
 is a Catholic school and one a        
 non-denominational school.The oldest  
 building is the R.C primary school in 
 Stoneyburn which is pre-war.The others
 are fairly new.                       
    Secondary pupils travel to West    
 Calder and Blackburn.                 </content>
