		<content>  The town gets very little through    
 traffic by road as an alternative     
 route inland exists _ the{"High Rd".  
  The{main railway line}to{Largs}runs  
 through the town and there is a lot of
 disruption because this line is being 
{electrified,}involving the raising of 
 all the bridges to accommodate the    
 cables.                               
  The railway is therefore safe from   
 closure - it also serves Ardrossan    
 harbour and links with the{ferries    
 there.                                
  The town is well served by{car-parks 
 although the recent{pedestrianisation 
 (see page 5) has increased pressure on
 parking areas. A new{one-way road     
{system}has been introduced.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
