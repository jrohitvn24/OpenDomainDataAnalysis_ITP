		<content> To learn about changes in St Margarets
 since 1952, we invited former pupils  
 and teachers to tea in the History    
 classrooms and taped our interviews.  
 In 1952 there were 280 girls. Most of 
 the boarders were at Auchterarder,    
 Perthshire, still evacuated after the 
 war. Everything seemed smaller and    
 quieter but not so very different.    
 Still green tunics, skirts and blazers
 but hats were worn, felt in Winter and
 straw in Summer. Almost everyone ate  
 school lunches, liver and semolina    
 unwillingly though! At break milk and 
 a sticky bun. One rule said that no   
 pupil in uniform was to enter a sweet 
 shop. Now we buy kit-kats from a      
 school machine. School House was the  
 only teaching block; now there are    
 ten. We would have missed our new     
 library, computer rooms and labs!
