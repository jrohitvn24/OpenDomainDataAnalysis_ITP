		<content>   Being a rural area there are not a  
 wide variety of jobs available        
 locally.  In the town the main places 
 of employment are on the Harlaw       
 Industrial Estate.  Here there are    
 electrical engineering works,         
 factories making parts to be used in  
 the oil industry and a meat processing
 factory.  In another part of town     
 there is an abattoir which provides   
 jobs for a few people.                
   In our survey we found that only 30%
 of those questioned worked within a 5 
 mile radius of their home, 32% worked 
 in Aberdeen, 17% worked offshore on   
 oil rigs and the remainder were either
 retired , unemployed or worked on the 
 land.  20% of those questioned had    
 oil-related jobs.  A large percentage 
 of those who travel a distance to work
 said they would prefer to work locally
 if jobs were available.               </content>
