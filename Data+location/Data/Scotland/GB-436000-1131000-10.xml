		<content>      WE INTERVIEWED 10 FISHERMEN, 10  
 FULL TIME, ALTHOUGH 2 HAVE NOW GIVEN  
 UP.THEY THEY LIKE THEIR TIME OFF,THE  
 VARIETY OF WORK AND THE SATISFACTION  
 OF A BIG CATCH AND GOOD PAY. DISLIKES 
 WERE ROUGH WEATHER AND EARLY RISING.  
 ON AVERAGE THEY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR  
 19 YEARS. OTHER JOBS THEY MIGHT HAVE  
 LIKED WERE MOSTLY PRACTICAL WITH FOUR 
 CHOOSING THE MERCHANT NAVY.           
      MOST FISHERMEN GET UP BETWEEN    
 MIDNIGHT AND 5 A.M. IN SUMMER AND 3   
 A.M. AND 6 A.M. IN WINTER. MOSTLY THEY
 CATCH HADDOCK, WHITING, LING, PLAICE, 
 SKATE, HERRING AND SAND EELS. THEY ALL
 LIKE TO EAT SOME OF WHAT THEY CATCH   
 AND HADDOCK SEEMS TO BE THE FAVOURITE.
 PROBLEMS OF THE JOB ARE LACK OF SLEEP,
 BAD WEATHER AND NO FISH. DANGERS ARE  
 GETTING TANGLED IN EQUIPMENT, FALLING 
 OVERBOARD AND BAD WEATHER. OPINION WAS
 THAT BOATS WOULD GET BIGGER IN FUTURE.</content>
