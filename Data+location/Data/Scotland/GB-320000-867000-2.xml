		<title>02AIR STATION LOSSIEMOUTH</title>
		<content>   Lossiemouth became a military       
 airfield during World War Two.        
 It trained pilots to fly bombers.     
 After the war it became a naval base, 
 until 1972 when it was taken over by  
 the R.A.F. Since then R.A.F.          
 Lossiemouth has grown rapidly.        
   Three hundred civilians work on the 
 base, their jobs varying from clerical
 work to washing aircraft. Two and a   
 half thousand uniformed people are    
 based there, involved in at least     
 sixty different kinds of jobs. For    
 instance dog-handling, policemen and  
 firemen. Air Traffic Control also play
 an important part, as R.A.F.          
 Lossiemouth is the largest operational
 flying station in the U.K. It is one  
 of the most important stations in the 
 defence of this country and for       
 N.A.T.O.
