		<title>11LOCAL HISTORY: THORNHILL</title>
		<content>   Built on a thorn ridge- hence its   
 name- a small settlement, consisting  
 of a few thatched cottages known as   
 Thornhill, is recorded to have existed
 as early as 1369. In 1662, a new place
 called "Nue" Dalgarno was erected a   
 few 100 yards SE of Thornhill. During 
 1779 the two small communities joined 
 up and the name "Nue"Dalgarno was     
 dropped in favour of Thornhill. With  
 the building of the Dumfries to       
 Glasgow road in 1715 the village began
 to stretch northwards. This road was  
 now used by carters to haul coal from 
 Sanquhar, 11 miles to the north. With 
 an upsurge in population the need for 
 schools, churches and public services 
 created further expansion of the      
 village during the 19th century.      
 Private and public sector housing have
 since contributed to the present state
 of the village.                       </content>
