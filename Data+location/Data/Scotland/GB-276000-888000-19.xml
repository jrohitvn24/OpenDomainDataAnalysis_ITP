		<title>19HERITAGE TRAIL</title>
		<content> On June 11th our class walked round   
 part of the Heritage Trail with       
 Councillor Bell. We started in the    
 Council Chambers. This is a impressive
 room, with a large painting of Queen  
 Victoria. There also were photograghs 
 of Dornoch and its golfing history. We
 went to St. Michael's which is the    
 oldest house in Dornoch. Across the   
 road there is an arched bridge which  
 was once the only crossing over the   
 burn. We stopped at the Mercat Cross. 
 Here fairs and markets were held. The 
 lane across the road was known as "Dog
 Steet" because shepherds left their   
 dogs there. In the graveyard there is 
 a stone which was used to measure     
 cloth. We continued into the cathedral
 which was built in 1224, under Gilbert
 the Bishop of Caithness. It was burned
 in 1570 and restored in the 19th      
 century. It is now a fine building.   </content>
