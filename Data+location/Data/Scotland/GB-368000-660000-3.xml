		<content> Cranshaws House is situated alongside 
 ten cottages, eight of which are semi-
 detached while the other two are      
 single homes. Near the cottages is a  
 duck pond.                            
                                       
 Cranshaws House has a swimming pool   
 and big gardens. On the farm there are
 seven sheds. These are used as lambing
 sheds, for hay and straw storage, one 
 with grain hoppers, for holding       
 fleeces and for stabling riding       
 horses. Roughly in the middle of the  
 farm there is a medium sized castle   
 (tower built in 1350).                
                                       
 The ruins of the old church lie 220   
 yards South, South West of the castle.
 Only part of the West wall remains    
 within the churchyard.
