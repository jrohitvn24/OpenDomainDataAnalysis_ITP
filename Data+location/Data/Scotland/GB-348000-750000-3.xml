		<title>03ANIMALS AT MID-DOD</title>
		<content> The{farming}includes 150 ewes. Their  
 lambs are kept until a certain age and
 are then fattened and sold at Forfar{ 
{Market.}On the farm there are also a  
 few cows, their calves are sold in    
 Kirriemuir where the new owner will   
 fatten them and sell them for meat.   
{CHANGES}-Once the owner of Mid-Dod    
 leased another 2 farms. Now the owner 
 farms all 3 himself. Fields have also 
 become larger. The number of workers  
 has decreased due to the introduction 
 of machinery.                         
{PROBLEMS}-The wind lifts the top soil 
 creating great difficulties.  Also the
 drainage is very old.  This means the 
 soil can become damp.  If machinery   
 damages the pipes they are just       
 replaced.  Another problem is frost.  
 Most crops are planted in Autumn and  
 have to survive the Winter.  If the   
 frost is too hard the crop can ruin.  </content>
