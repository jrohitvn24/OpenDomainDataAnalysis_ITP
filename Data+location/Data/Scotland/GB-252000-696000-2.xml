		<title>02LOCAL HISTORY OF GARTMORE</title>
		<content> The name Gartmore means "the big      
 enclosure". At one time cattle were   
 driven to markets in the south along  
 the drove roads, being rested over-   
 night in Gartmore. Place names still  
 reflect this - Market Place, Wester &amp; 
 Easter Cow Park, Slaughterhouse Lane  
 (now Park Avenue).{Gartmore House}was 
 owned for many years by the Grahams,  
 the first was the son of the 4th. Earl
 of Menteith. In 1730 Robert Graham MP 
 was Lord Rector of Glasgow University,
 and Sir Walter Scott wrote parts of   
 "Rob Roy" there. Many of Rob Roy's    
 exploits took place around Gartmore.  
 Gartmore was a true{estate village    
 built on a rocky hill as the surround-
 ing land was so fertile. 90 years ago 
 there was a bakery, butcher's, 2 pubs,
 3 cobblers, smiddy, 2 churches, and a 
 secondary school. Until 1949 the rail-
 way went from Aberfoyle to Buchlyvie. </content>
