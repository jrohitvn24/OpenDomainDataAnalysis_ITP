		<title>05Fraserburgh Harbour</title>
		<content> It was on the 9th of March 1576 that  
 Sir Alexander Fraser opened the       
 harbour.The first extension was built 
 in 1821 when King George 111 was on   
 the throne.                           
 In 1971 the harbour was deepened by a 
 dredger.They had to dam up the pier.In
 1978 it was deepened again.The        
 Faithlie is the deepest place.It is 4 
 metres deep.Here are the names of some
 of the piers:Bruce's Jetty,Chalmers'  
 Jetty and Bissett's Quay.             
 There are two lighthouses,one at the  
 harbour and the newer one at          
 Kinnaird's Head.On the Balaclava Pier 
 there are huge sheds for nets and     
 things like that.In the harbour the   
 boats are tied to the pier with thick 
 ropes. .                              
 The North Sea was called the German   
 Ocean until 1818.
