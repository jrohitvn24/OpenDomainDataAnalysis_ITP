		<content> We did a small survey with Primaries  
 4,5,6,and 7.There were nine animals in
 our survey list,these being dogs,     
 cats,rabbits,guinea pigs,hamsters     
 fish,mice,birds and horses.The most   
 popular group was mice because people 
 said they had them behind their       
 skirting boards!The smallest number   
 was for hamsters.There was only one of
 them and that belonged to Iain Poe.He 
 calls his pet Tickie.It is a          
 multi-coloured hamster and sleeps all 
 day.It eats bits of dried fruit,      
 lettuce,biscuits,bits of Mars Bars    
 and,if he gets the chance,Iain's      
 fingers!It has a yellow wheel which it
 sometimes plays in.Iain also had the  
 most pets-20 in total.He has one      
 dog,one hamster,ten birds and the     
 mice!
