		<content>{The Claymore Restaurant,Harapul}was   
 re-opened in May 1985 after having    
 been closed for ten years.            
 It was decided to re-open as the      
 restaurant is considered to be an     
 asset to the village which,with an    
 increasing tourist trade will provide 
 an amenity hitherto absent.           
 The restaurant can seat 60 people with
 15 tables of 4 people.An average of 50
 people a day eat at the Claymore.     
 The Claymore opens at 11am and closes 
 at 9.30pm. The restaurant has three   
 kitchen staff and four waitresses.    
 The owner is Mr.Nigel Macdiarmid of   
 Kyleakin. A great deal of work was    
 required to bring the restaurant back 
 into serviceable condition and much of
 this was done by the owner himself.
