		<title>13A LOCAL LIBRARY,CUMBERNAULD.</title>
		<content> Our local Library is in Condorrat     
 Village.It is only a few years old and
 inside it is very modern.However the  
 outside of the building has been made 
 to fit in with the other houses in    
 the village.To do this the architect  
 has used slates instead of roof       
 tiles,he has put dormer windows on the
 roof although there is no upstairs and
 the walls have pebble_dash on them.The
 library is spacious inside and has    
 room for many books .When my class did
 a project on the library we found out 
 that{it had 80 bookshelves,}each      
 bookshelf had{5 shelves}and this gave{
{352 metres of shelf space.}Condorrat  
 library has both a children's and     
 adult's section and the non_fiction   
 books are classified using the{Dewey  
{Decimal Classification System. }      
                                       
                                       </content>
