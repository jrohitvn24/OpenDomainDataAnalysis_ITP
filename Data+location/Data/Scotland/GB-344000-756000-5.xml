{You }need a base and a person who is  
 called a seeker.The seeker counts up  
 to an agreed number while the other   
 players hide.                         
     The seeker must not look where the
 other players are hiding while he or  
 she is counting.He or she must not    
 start looking for the other players   
 until he has finished counting up to  
 the agreed number.If he finds someone 
 and gets back to the base before they 
 can,then the person who has been      
 caught is out.But if they get back to 
 the base without being caught then he 
 is not out.The first person who gets  
 caught is out for the next game.
