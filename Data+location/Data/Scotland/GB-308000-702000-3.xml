		<content> There are two main{soil groups}in this
 area,both of glacial origin.{Podsols, 
 derived from fluvioglacial outwash,   
 tend to be on the lowest land and near
 to Loch Leven.Being derived from sands
 and gravels,these are more leached but
 also more easily worked than the{Brown
{Forest}soils.These are derived from   
 till and have greater clay content.   
{Till}forms low elevations such as     
 Gallowhill(1003) and much of the west 
 of the Kinross Basin.{Fluvioglacial   
 sediments contain more sandstone,     
 which lies eastwards from the lavas.  
{Alluvial}soils lie along shallow      
 valleys.                              
 Like much of the higher parts of      
 Central Scotland's lowland(around     
 150m),the Kinross Basin has moderate  
{climatic constraints}upon farming.    
 Under the warm day climatic conditions
 the soils,generally of red-brown sandy</content>
