		<content>    MOST OF THE BUILDINGS IN THIS BLOCK
 WERE BUILT OVER 100 YEARS AGO, THE    
 EXCEPTIONS BEING THE TEVIOTDALE LODGE 
 HOTEL AND TEVIOTDALE COTTAGE WHICH    
 WERE CONSTRUCTED IN THE 1930'S. THE   
 HOTEL WAS BUILT AS A SHOOTING LODGE,  
 THE COTTAGE FOR THE CHAUFFEUR. A SHED 
 BEHIND THE COTTAGE WITH AN ENORMOUS   
 DOOR HOUSED AN AUTOGIRO, A TYPE OF    
 AIRCRAFT. IT TOOK OFF AND LANDED IN A 
 NEIGHBOURING FIELD.                   
 IVY COTTAGE WAS DERELICT TWELVE YEARS 
 AGO BUT WAS BOUGHT FROM THE ESTATE TO 
 BE REBUILT AND ENLARGED. IT IS THE    
 MOST MODERN BUILDING IN THIS          
 BLOCK,BUILT AROUND THE SHELL OF A     
 FORMER THREE-ROOMED COTTAGE.          
 TEVIOTDALE IS A REMOTE RURAL AREA     
 OUTWITH AN INDUSTRIAL BELT. IT IS     
 LARGELY TENANTED FARMLAND, OWNED BY   
 THE BUCCLEUCH ESTATES. THESE FACTORS  
 EXPLAIN THE LACK OF NEW HOUSES.       </content>
