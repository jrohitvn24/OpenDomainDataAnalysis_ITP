		<title>16INDUSTRIES I - NAIRNS</title>
		<content> Michael Nairn, who was born in        
 Kirkcaldy, was the man who invented   
 linoleum in 1847. At that time it was 
 the main industry and was very        
 important to the town. At one time    
 6,000 people were employed, but now it
 is only about 700. At that time       
 Kirkcaldy was known by the smell of   
 linoleum. In addition to linoleum     
 Nairns now make many floor coverings, 
 e.g. durofloor, cosy soft, classic and
 cushionfloor. Wall coverings are also 
 made under the name of Kingfisher.    
 Because Nairns was conveniently near  
 the harbour it was able to obtain raw 
 materials from abroad. These are      
 linseed oil, pigments, resin and      
 woodflour.                            
 With modern machinery vinyl can be    
 manufactured 4 meters wide. Nairns    
 export their goods to 111 countries   
 all over the world.                   </content>
