 school) was built.  It was built on   
 farmland and started with 200 pupils. 
 Later it rose to 7oo pupils.          
 There are 16 classrooms and rooms for 
 a headteacher, two assistants, a      
 secretary and a janitor.  There are   
 also 16 toilets, a gym/dining hall    
 with its own kitchen, a stage/ T.V>   
 room and a medical block.             
 In one of the classrooms is a nursery,
 where 20 children attend in the       
 morning and a different 20 attend in  
 the afternoon.                        
 Our school is built on a square and in
 the centre is a play area with a sand 
 pit, adventure area and some rabbit   
 hutches.We have a football pitch and  
 other grass areas and there is a hard 
 surfaced area with a climbing frame
