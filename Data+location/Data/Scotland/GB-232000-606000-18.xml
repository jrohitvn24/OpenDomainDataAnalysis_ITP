		<content> Each year a Gala is held in Crosshill 
 during the first week of June.The Gala
 Queen is chosen by the school pupils  
 from the girls in Primary 7 class.    
 This year many of the activities due  
 to take place during the week were    
 cancelled .The crowning of the Queen  
 was followed by a procession through  
 the village to the football ground    
 where a fete and mini-sports took     
 place.   In Kirkmichael the Gala Queen
 is chosen by the teenagers. Each day  
 there is an event involving different 
 groups of people so that all ages are 
 catered for.The highlights of the week
 are the car treasure hunt on Wednesday
 and the buffet dance on Friday held in
 the school. The Gala Week is organised
 by a committee of the villagers.
