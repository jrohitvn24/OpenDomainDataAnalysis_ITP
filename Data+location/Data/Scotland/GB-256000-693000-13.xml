 formed and a constitution drawn up in{
{1946}although there had been a village
 team for many years before. The club  
 did not have their own playing field  
 until{1977}when a pitch was made      
 behind the school. The team, playing  
 in amber and black, play in the{FORTH 
{AND ENDRICK LEAGUE,}a league of eleven
 teams from nearby villages. At the    
 present time there are 28 signed      
 players on the team books and the     
 first half of the eighties has seen a 
 fair measure of success for the club  
 who won the{LEAGUE TROPHY}for the     
 first time in{1982. THE MCGREGOR      
{FERGUSON CUP AND THE GARVIE TROPHY}   
 have each been won three times and in{
{1984, THE TELFER TROPHY}was also      
 won.New dressing rooms are being built
 as part of the village hall and will  
 be ready for use for season 1986.     </content>
