		<title>16Housing in Voe.</title>
		<content> Many new houses have been built in Voe
 over the past 10 years.This has mainly
 been due to the construction of the   
 Sullom Voe Oil Terminal,which lies    
 only 10 miles to the north of Voe.    
 BP built a housing scheme for its     
 employees,named Mulla, after the hill 
 which they are built on.There are 25  
 detached houses in this scheme.The    
 occupants of these houses change      
 frequently as they are often          
 transferred to work elsewhere for BP. 
 Voe house was also bought by BP and   
 houses the terminal manager's family  
 at the moment.There are also three    
 council owned housing schemes in      
 Voe;Norderhoull,Norbrek and Isles     
 Road,all of which are semi_detached.  
 Voe is a very picturesque place in    
 which to live and so has also         
 attracted many to build privately.
