		<content> Also included in this block is the    
 deserted village of{Molinginish.}This 
 village is on the north side of Loch  
 Trollamarig and nobody has lived here 
 for quite some time. There are some   
 houses left but only one with a roof  
 on. Again there is no road to this    
 place but an access path branches off 
 the Tarbert to Rhenigidale path. The  
 walk from Tarbert to Molinginish is a 
 shorter distance but the croftland    
 supported less families than at       
 Rhenigidale. If the weather is calm it
 is possible to go across from         
 Rhenigidale in a small boat and walk  
 to Tarbert from there. Thus making the
 journey shorter and easier.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
