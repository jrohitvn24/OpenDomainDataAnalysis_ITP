		<title>06CANOE SLALOM</title>
		<content> At the bridge over the Tweed two canoe
 slaloms are run each year.            
 The first event is in spring when the 
 river is still high from the winter   
 snows.  It is run by Edinburgh        
 University Canoe Club and is Division 
 2 and 3 ranking. Competitors from all 
 over Britain take part in the event.  
 Their results are taken from this     
 event and all the others they         
 participate in and their standing is  
 ranked along with all other           
 competitors in their division         
 throughout Britain by the British     
 Canoe Union and the Scottish Canoe    
 Association.                          
 The second event is run in the summer 
 by the Selkirk High School Club who   
 are the only Scottish school to run a 
 National ranking event.  This event is
 for Division 4 and Novice Paddlers.
