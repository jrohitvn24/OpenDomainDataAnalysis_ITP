		<title>10LOCAL POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> We live in the area served by the     
 Northern Constabulary. The local      
 policeman usually works eight hours a 
 day but if he is required to work more
 than eight hours he does.His beat or  
 area is Smithton, Balloch,Culloden,   
 Cradlehall and Westhill.              
 The policemans job increases in the   
 Summer because of the increase in     
 population due to tourism.            
 Our local policeman patrols in a car  
 and has a portacabin next to his      
 house where he does his paperwork and 
 where he keeps stolen or lost         
 property.                             
 We can't contact our local policeman  
 on the phone by the number 999 but we 
 could get a policeman in the Inverness
 Police Station.There are two council  
 houses kept seperate from the rest for
 two policemen's families to live there
 until they move onto another town.    </content>
