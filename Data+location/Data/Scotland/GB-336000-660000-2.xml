    According to the map, although it  
 is chiefly farmland, there is a       
 variety of interesting features:      
 farms, old quarries, old churches,    
 part of a recently opened country     
 park at Vogrie, interesting cottages  
 in the villages of Borthwick Mains and
 Newlandrig, an historic castle, many  
 sights of historical interest and the 
 old, disused Waverly Railway line.    
  Hidden from the road is the important
 Borthwick Sand Quarry which supplies a
 large amount of sand for Lothian      
 Region. Of all the many old, disused  
 lime works in the area only one is    
 still working-Middleton Lime Works.   
  The land is hilly; Crow Law being 802
 feet high and Tyne Water threads it's 
 way through the valleys on it's       
 journey to the sea.
