		<title>05 FARMING  AROUND  FORDYCE</title>
		<content>            - TYPICAL -                
                                       
 All farms follow their own particular 
 speciality but we gathered,that a farm
 servant's typical day would begin at  
 7a.m. and end about 5p.m.,whereas a   
 farm owner would start at 6.30a.m.and 
 finish at 11p.m.,in all but the winter
 season. In the last 20 years many     
 changes have taken place,the main     
 being that machinery has replaced man-
 power so that there are far fewer     
 labourers. Most farms have become more
 specialised,are run by l manager and l
 or 2 employees, have better buildings 
 for animals and grain storage and have
 much better drainage. Fertilisers and 
 Chemicals are used by all, and a seven
 year rotation of crops is usual.  The 
 main problems,of course,are still     
 Weather and Rising Costs.
