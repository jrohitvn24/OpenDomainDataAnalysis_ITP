		<title>18THE FUTURE OF PORTESSIE?</title>
		<content>      BY THE YEAR 2086, A BIG CHANGE   
 WILL HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE WORLD.  I
 THINK THAT THE WORLD WILL BE FULL OF  
 COMPUTERS, MAYBE EVEN RULED BY        
 COMPUTERS AND ROBOTS.  CARS WILL HAVE 
 MINDS OF THEIR OWN AND WILL BE ABLE   
 TO TALK TO YOU.  MAYBE, THEY WILL EVEN
 DRIVE YOU WHERE YOU WANT.             
      HOLIDAYS WILL BE SPENT IN SPACE, 
 IN A SPACE HOTEL.  THERE WILL BE      
 HUNDREDS OF ROCKETS TO TAKE YOU THERE.
 IT WILL BE JUST LIKE CATCHING A BUS.  
      THE WEATHER WILL BE CONTROLLED   
 BY PEOPLE USING A MACHINE IN SPACE. IT
 WILL RAIN WHEN ONE WISHES AND THE SUN 
 WILL SHINE WHEN NEEDED.               
      PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE FOR  
 AS LONG AS THEY WISH.  NO ONE WILL DIE
 BECAUSE OF ALL THE MEDICINES THAT WILL
 BE INVENTED.                          
      I THINK THAT IN A HUNDRED YEARS  
 EVERYTHING WILL HAVE CHANGED A LOT.   </content>
