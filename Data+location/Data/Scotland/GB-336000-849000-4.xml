 The Hill of Mulderie rises to 311     
 metres above sea level.  It is        
 elongated in shape and has gentle     
 slopes.  The upper slopes are covered 
 in conifer plantation, planted by The 
 Forestry Commission.  The plantation  
 covers an area of 248 hectares or 620 
 acres.  Before the Forestry Commission
 started planting, the Hill of Mulderie
 was barren except for a few trees.    
 The first trees were planted by       
 Forestry workers in 1948.  Ten years  
 later in 1958, a further section of   
 Mulderie was planted.  More   trees   
 were planted in 1980.                 
 Before the trees were planted, some   
 local people used to cut peat to      
 provide fuel for their fires.  Peat   
 cutting was done on the low ground at 
 the foot of Mulderie Hill. No peat is 
 cut there now.                        </content>
