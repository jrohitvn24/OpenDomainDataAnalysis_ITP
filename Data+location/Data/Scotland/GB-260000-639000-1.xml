		<title>01Ayrshire Upland Border</title>
		<content> This is a watershed area of rolling   
 upland over 700 feet above sea-level. 
 It lies in the lee of Loudoun Hill - a
 local landmark.   Although moorland   
 there are good plantings of beeech    
 trees round lower fields.   The land  
 which was glaciated is snad, peat and 
 thin soil, therefore land use is      
 marginal agriculture with forestry    
 creeping in the area is sparsely      
 populated - most peopel are involved  
 in farming-barley, hay, rough-grazing 
 and moor.   The isolated primary      
 school has been converted to an       
 outdoor centre.   The block contains  
 the battlefield of Drumclog where the 
 religious covenanters beat the        
 Dragoons in 1679.   The area appears  
 to be little changed over the years   
 except for the pressure on marginal   
 land for forestry use.
