		<title>09INVERKEILOR CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Inverkeilor Church is one of      
 Inverkeilor's main attractions.It was 
 built 119 years ago and has been      
 re_built before,as it is mentioned in 
 charters as long ago as 1178 when     
 Arbroath Abbey was built.It is hard to
 know who built the Church but it is   
 dedicated to Saint Connon.The oldest  
 part of the Church is known to be the 
{North Esk}panelling which has an      
 engraved coat of arms.This is also    
 known as "{The Gallery}".The bell's   
 age is not known but it is thought to 
 have been there since the 18th        
 century.                              
   One well known minister from the    
 17th century was{Joshua Durie}.It     
 is probable that he acted as an envoy 
 to King Charles 1,and he is remembered
 today by his gravestone which has a   
 Latin verse on it.
