		<content>   The Carpet Bowling Club meets every 
 Monday in the winter.While the annual 
 membership fee is Â£1,everyone pays 10p
 each night and this becomes the prize 
 money.The winners get part of the     
 money and the runners-up get the rest.
 You can play with a partner or on your
 own.You roll your bowls up a long     
 board with rings at the end like a    
 target.You have to try to get your    
 bowls nearest to the middle.          
   The Women's Rural Institute,or the  
 W.R.I., meets in Colvend Church hall  
 once a month.They do crafts like      
 knitting,sewing or baking.They talk   
 about serious matters to do with the  
 countryside.

 but it is attached to the Church. They
 have speakers talking about missionary
 work and church affairs and raise     
 money for the Church.                 </content>
