 Newport on Tay is a fairly small town 
 in the parish of Forgan situated on   
 the south bank of the Tay in North    
 East Fife. It consists of two small   
 villages; Wormit and Newport. Both    
 gradually joined into each other.     
   Wormit was established when the Tay 
 Rail Bridge opened and Newport was    
 originally a ferry-port. The railway  
 station is now closed but people      
 generally use the road bridge anyway. 
   Most people in Newport work in      
 Dundee, using here as a dormitory     
 town. The poulation has changed       
 rapidly over the years from around    
 1000 in the 1830's to nearly 4000 in  
 the parish at the last census in 1981.
   The area surrounding Newport on Tay 
 is mainly gentle hills and fertile    
 farmland with lots of trees spotted   
 all over the place.                   </content>
