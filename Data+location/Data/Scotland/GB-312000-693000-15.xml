		<title>15TRANSPORT - SERVICES</title>
		<content> With the demise of the mining industry
 in the Kelty area there has been a    
 decline in transport services.  Kelty 
 had a railway station, now closed, on 
 the Perth, Edinburgh route.  The      
 village had an Alexanders Bus Garage  
 which has also closed within the last 
 few years.  With the closure of this  
 garage, Kelty was left virtually      
 isolated.  There is a half hour bus   
 service to Cowdenbeath, an hourly     
 service to Dunfermline.  There is also
 a two hour service with buses passing 
 from Perth to Edinburgh.  Most traffic
 now by passes Kelty.
