		<title>07SOLWAY VIADUCT,ANNAN</title>
		<content> Many of us play along the dismantled  
 railway line which now carries a      
 pipeline of waste cooling water from  
 Chapelcross Atomic Power Station to   
 the Solway Firth.                     
 When the old railway line existed it  
 was used mainly for transporting iron 
 ore from Cumberland to steel works in 
 Lanarkshire.A viaduct was built across
 the Solway.Four thousand tons of iron 
 were used to build the Solway Viaduct 
 which measured 1940 yards in length-at
 that time the longest bridge in       
 Britain!It was opened on 13/9/1869.   
 Six years later frost damaged part of 
 the Viaduct.In 1881 ice sheets from   
 the rivers caused so much damage that 
 it became unsafe.Repairs took three   
 years to complete.By then cheap       
 Spanish ore was replacing the Cumbrian
 ore.It was finally demolished in 1934 
 leaving only the embankments.         </content>
