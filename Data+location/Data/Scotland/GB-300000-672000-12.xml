		<content> Most of the work to be found in Low   
 Port's survey area is agricultural or 
 through Lothian Region's Park Ranger  
 Service.                              
 Mr and Mrs Aitken, the largest farm   
 owners in the area, employ ten men.   
 this does not seem to be a lot of     
 people for all the land and the       
 thousand head of cattle and the       
 sheep.The work is covered because the 
 Riccarton and other farms in this     
 family are highly mechanised.         
 Mr and Mrs Taylor, who farms Wester   
 Ochiltree, employs two full-time      
 workers. Mr Taylor works a very long  
 day.                                  
 The park Rangers are the other        
 employed people in our survey area of 
 the park.As well as six full time     
 Rangers there are several Youth       
 Training Scheme part_time workers.
