		<content>{Tiree is an island,where no trees grow
{because ofthe sandy land and the      
{wind.Most of the land is used for     
{farming and crofting.The languages are
{English and Gaelic.On Tiree there is  
{only one pier and one airpoirt.       
{Lately a radar station was built on   
{Ben Hough.The school is at Cornaig.On 
{the Reef three football teams play,   
{this year East won and Balemartin won 
{the five_a_side.Tiree is a very flat  
{island and only has a hill here and   
{there.The shops are small and  they   
{do  not have much choice.On page 15   
{there is a page on the boat and on    
{page 16 there is  the translation in  
{Gaelic.Page 19 is on discos and page  
{20 is the translation.
