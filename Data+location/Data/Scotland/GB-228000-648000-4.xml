		<content> The main purpose of the Dalry factory 
 is to supply the world market with    
{Vitamins}and other fine chemicals for 
 the pharmaceutical industry.  With 750
 workers, it is a major employer.      
{The Swiss Company}began making Vitamin
 A here in 1957 on a 7 acre site.  By  
 1972 it had expanded to 21 acres, with
 plants making Vitamins B1 and B5 and a
 range of chemicals.  In 1983 a large  
 new complex was completed for the     
 manufacture of Vitamin C.  Costing    
 Â£150 million, it increased the site   
 size to 46 acres.  A railway siding   
 was built to bring in coal directly to
 fire the plant's own power house.     
 Sophisticated chemical engineering    
 techniques are combined with high     
 standards of working conditions and   
 facilities.  Over 90% of the output is
 exported, for the pharmaceutical, food
 and animal feed industries.           </content>
