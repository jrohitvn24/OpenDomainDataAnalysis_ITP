 My grandad has worked with the railway
 for thirty five years as a signal man.
 When there are trains coming he has to
 accept them by pulling the signals in 
 the cabin to let them through. It is a
 single track line that goes from Blair
 Athol to Dalwhinnie and through to    
 Newtonmore and Kingussie. When he has 
 accepted the train he phones the      
 signal box in Kingussie to tell them  
 where the train is. There is a        
 telephone at the crossing gates and   
 hikers ring up the signal box to see  
 if it is safe to cross the line or    
 not. He works day and night shifts for
 7 hours at a time and it is good pay.
