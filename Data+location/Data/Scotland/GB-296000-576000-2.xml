		<content> We wanted to find out in 1985 what    
 the people in Dumfries thought was the
 most important local issue.           
 The results are as follows:           
{RENT &amp; RATES               32%        
{TRAFFIC SYSTEM             12%        
{DIRTY STREETS}             {8%        
{NO COMMENT                 12%        
{NOTHING FOR TEENAGERS       4%        
{BYPASS                     20%        
{PEDESTRIANISATION           4%        
{ROADS                       8%        
 Local government is funded primarily  
 from the rates levied on property.    
 There was a rates revaluation which   
 meant that combined with the cut in   
 the Rates Support Grant,the rates had 
 to be increased substantially.        
 After the revaluation it meant that   
 the rate in the pound was increased to
 47.3p,an increase of 25% for domestic 
 ratepayers.                           </content>
