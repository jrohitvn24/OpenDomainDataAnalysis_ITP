 area and six playgroups for under     
 school age children.Nether Robertland 
 Primary in Pokelly Place,opened in    
 1973,is a semi open plan school with  
 374 pupils from the town and          
 surrounding countryside. The          
 headteacher is Mrs Jessie Hunter and  
 there are 14 full time teachers and 6 
 visiting teachers.Serving the other   
 part of the town is Lainshaw Primary  
 which has 4 separate buildings,the    
 oldest of which was built in 1876.Next
 year,hopefully,in June 1986 the school

 McKinnon and her 365 pupils are taught
 by 14 teachers and 5 visiting         
 ones.Both schools are up to date in
