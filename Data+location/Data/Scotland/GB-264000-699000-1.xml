 The block we are studying is a        
 rectangle 4km by 3km. The south west  
 corner is located at grid reference   
 26406990 on the O.S. map no.57        
 Stirling and Trossachs. Thornhill is  
 six miles from Callander, nine from   
 Stirling and six from the Lake of     
 Menteith, the only lake in            
 Scotland. When the lake is frozen over
 people skate and have curling         
 matches. Gartincaber Tower is said to 
 be the centre of Scotland. It is just 
 to the north east of our block.We have
 part of Flanders Moss in our rectangle
 and the whole of the village of       
 Thornhill.There are 19 farm steadings 
 in all,one being used as a fish smoke 
 house.There are 481 people in the     
 village of Thornhill and 93 in the    
 neighbouring farms making  a total    
 population of 547.                    </content>
