		<title>11A DAY IN OUR SURVEY</title>
		<content> AFTER GETTING PERMISSION FROM THE     
 LANDOWNER , SEVEN OF US WENT OF TO    
 SURVEY THE AREA ROUND COLDINGHAM LOCH.
 THIS IS PRIVATE LAND AND THE LOCH IS  
 USED FOR TROUT FISHING . FIVE BOATS   
 WERE OUT ON THE LOCH WHEN WE WERE     
 THERE. ON THE LOCH WE SAW A FAMILY OF 
 SWANS , TWO ADULTS AND SEVEN CYGNETS, 
 SOME COOTS AND WATER HENS WERE ALSO ON
 THE LOCH. IN THE SHALLOW WATER NEAR   
 THE EDGE , WE FOUND A LIZARD AMONG THE
 YELLOW FLAGS. WE RECORDED FOURTEEN    
 DIFFERENT SPECIES OF WILD FLOWERS. OUR
 MOST INTERESTING FIND WAS AN IRON-AGE 
 HILLFORT. ONE SIDE OF THE FORT WAS    
 BUILT ON A STEEP ROCKY OUTCROP AND THE
 REMAINDER WAS SURROUNDED BY TWO       
 RAMPARTS SEPARATED BY A DITCH. TTHERE 
 WERE TWO ENTRANCES ,WHICH WERE NOT INN
 A STRAIGHT LINE SO THAT THEY COULD BE 
 MORE EASILY DEFENDED. WE HAD A VERY   
 INTERESTING TIME.                     </content>
