		<content> In the Western Isles the primary      
 language is Gaelic, with English as a 
 second language. Nearly everyone in   
 the village of Rhenigidale speaks both
 languages. Some of the houses have    
 Gaelic names e.g {Tigh na Mara}_ house
 by the sea and{ Sith Phort}_ peace    
 haven. Other gaelic words include{    
{ceilidh}_ a visit, informal gathering.
{Dun _ Eideann}_Edinburgh, and{beinn}  
 _mountain/hill.{                      
{                                      
{Health }The nearest medical help is   
 Tarbert. If necessary the doctor can  
 arrive quickly by boat. However the   
 weather can be unsuitable in an       
 emergency and in these circumstances, 
 as happened a few years ago, a        
 helicopter has to be used. It is      
 comforting to know that this facility 
 is available should weather and       
 circumstances make it necessary.      </content>
