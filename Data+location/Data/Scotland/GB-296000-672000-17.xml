		<title>17The Craigs, Torphichen</title>
		<content> The Craigs is a wooded area with      
 grass clearings, of approximately 3   
 acres on the outskirts of Torphichen. 
 It was at one time owned by Mr.William
 Wolfe who lives overlooking the Craigs
 and a few years ago he gifted it to   
 the scout movement. The scouts use it 
 as a camp for weekends or longer      
 periods in the summer. They sleep     
 under canvas or in huts which have    
 bunk beds in them and gas lighting. It
 is also the venue for competions      
 between scout groups. Some weekends   
 scout groups  go to the Craigs to take
 part in improving the area by removing
 trees damaged by Dutch elm disease,   
 gathering litter, putting red shingle 
 in pot holes in the road and cutting  
 wood in preparation for camp fires and
 barbecues.
