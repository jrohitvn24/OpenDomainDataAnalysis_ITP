		<title>06SOCIAL CONCERN</title>
		<content> THERE ARE TWO MAIN SOURCES OF SOCIAL  
 CONCERN IN THE AREA.                  
 UNEMPLOYMENT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE       
 SCOURGE OF OUR TIME.AS WELL AS        
 CREATING MAJOR FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS IT 
 HAS LED TO MANY SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE
 HOMES OF THE UNEMPLOYED.MANY OF THOSE 
 PEOPLE WHO WERE MADE REDUNDANT WERE   
 GIVEN SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY.IN 
 MANY INSTANCES THIS MONEY WAS         
 SQUANDERED AND AFTER A PERIOD OF      
 PLENTY FAMILIES WERE CONFRONTED WITH  
 THE REALITY OF LIVING ON A VERY       
 RESTRICTED INCOME.THIS HAS GIVEN      
 RISE TO A VARIETY OF DOMESTIC         
 PROBLEMS.                             
 THE OTHER CAUSE FOR CONCERN IS THE    
 LACK OF FACILITIES FOR THE YOUNG      
 PEOPLE IN THE AREA WHO HAVE VERY      
 LITTLE HOPE OF GAINING FULL TIME      
 EMPLOYMENT AND FIND IT INCREASINGLY   
 DIFFICULT TO GAINFULLY PASS THEIR TIME</content>
