		<title>10RALSTON GOLF COURSE PAISLEY</title>
		<content> Ralston Golf Course is 77 years old   
 and covers about 500 square kilometres
 of undulating land which used to be   
 farmland.  It has over 400 members    
 aged between 10 to 80 years.  The fees
 are Â£l89 per year.  This money is used
 to employ a professional golfer, 3    
 ground staff and good changing        
 facilities.                           
                                       
 The members can sit in the well-kept  
 garden area where they can relax with 
 a drink or a snack after their game.  
 One hundred golfers play each weekday 
 but at the weekend the attendance     
 rises to between four and five        
 hundred. Famous golfers play there in 
 competitions.  It has a very bright   
 future as there is a long waiting list
 due to more T.V. coverage of          
 competitions and people having more   
 leisure time.                         </content>
