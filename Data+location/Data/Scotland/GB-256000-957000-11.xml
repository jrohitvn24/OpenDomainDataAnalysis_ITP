		<title>11Leisure Activities, Tongue</title>
		<content> A survey of the children's leisure    
 activities showed that by far the     
 biggest number liked playing on their 
 bikes best of all. The next two most  
 popular pastimes were horse riding and
 fishing with reading and football     
 coming much lower on the list.        
 Adults interviewed gave whist playing 
 as ther favourite pastime with the    
 Wednesday Club (a group for the over  
 60s) and knitting and reading coming  
 next.                                 
 Activities which adults,would like to 
 take part in  but could not because of
 lack of facilities, were swimming,    
 evening classes and tennis.
