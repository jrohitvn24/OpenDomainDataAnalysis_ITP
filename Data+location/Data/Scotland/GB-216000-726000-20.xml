		<content> GAMES WE PLAY: Rounders               
 Rounders is best played outdoors where
 there is room to run around and hit a 
 ball.                                 
  You will need one bat,one ball,four  
 markers. The markers(eg beanbags)are  
 placed on the ground to mark the four 
 corners of a large square. Bat and    
 ball should be placed at the bottom   
 left corner of the square.            
  Two teams of equal number are chosen 
 one team will bat while the other     
 retrieves the ball for the bowler.    
  The ball is thrown by the bowler to  
 the first batsman who is allowed three
 attempts to hit the ball.On a         
 successful hit the batsman run as far 
 round the square as possible before   
 the bowler catches the ball. Each run 
 round the counts as one point. Teams  
 change when there is no one left to   
 bat or if the ball is caught offthebat</content>
