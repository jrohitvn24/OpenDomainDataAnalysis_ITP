		<title>13A LOCAL CONTROVERSY</title>
		<content> The chipshop was at one time proposed 
 to be closed.  It was vital for the   
 councils' needs.  It lies on the Cupar
 Road and is very popular.  A local    
 lady set up a petition to stop the    
 closure and managed to get 1480 people
 to sign it.  After a few weeks it was 
 decided that the chipshop was not to  
 be closed. There was also an article  
 in the paper about how the chipshop   
 was to be closed and it caused quite a
 stir in Guardbridge.  The shop stays  
 open until 12.00 midnight and is doing
 very well at the moment.  They have a 
 lot of passing trade and the locals go
 there quite often as well.
