		<title>05IRVINE RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> This station has been in existence    
 since 1840 with the opening of the    
 Glasgow,Paisley,Dalry,Kilwinning,     
 Irvine and Ayr line which was built   
 by a company of businessmen who were  
 promoting trade.The line was run later
 by the London Midland and Scottish    
 Railway Company and is now part of    
 Scotrail.At the moment the line       
 running between Irvine and Glasgow is 
 undergoing electrification at a cost  
 of Â£80,000,000, doing away with diesel
 locomotives.The advantages of the     
 scheme are that the trains will be    
 quicker, cleaner and more             
 economical.Unfortunately parts of the 
 line south of Ayr will not be         
 electrified in the near future and    
 passengers going to Stranraer will    
 have to change at Ayr to diesel locos.
