		<title>07Old Buildings in Milnathort</title>
		<content>    Milnathort Town Hall was opened in 
 1855. As well as serving the needs of 
 the community, which it still does    
 (from badminton to coffee mornings),it
 had then a police post and cells.     
    Milnathort had a thriving 19th c.  
 weaving community and a much older    
 meal and flour milling trade. The     
 smiddy in Wester Loan was once a weav-
 er's cottage, and the old mill still  
 stands in the centre of the village.  
    Just outside Milanthort is{Burleigh
{Castle (photograph B) }This red sand- 
 stone 15th c. castle used to have a   
 moat. In the summer tourists from this
 country and abroad visit the castle.  
 Local children often play round it.   
 The castle is said to be haunted by a 
 ghost called "Grey Maggie".           
    Two ancient standing stones (3000  
 to 4000 yrs old) are in a field at    
 Orwell Farm, 4km from Milnathort.     </content>
