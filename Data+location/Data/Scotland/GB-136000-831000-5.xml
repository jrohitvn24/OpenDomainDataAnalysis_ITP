		<content> Our school has two teachers for 25    
 pupils-13 girls and 12 boys.The       
 children are in composite classes,one 
 being for Primaries 1-3 and the other 
 for Primaries 4-7.The rest of the     
 staff consists of a visiting Art      
 teacher and Gaelic teacher.We also    
 have a cleaner and a dining assistant.
 The school consists of one main       
 building which is used as a canteen   
 and G.P.room.,and two huts for        
 classrooms.The toilets are outside in 
 a separate unit.                      
 The school is situated in a most      
 scenic spot,1 mile from the village.It
 sits at the top of the hill,with views
 of Loch Harport and the Black and Red 
 Cullins.                              
 There is plenty of space to play in   
 and lots of wooden adventure equipment
 to play on,built by Mr.Donaldson.
