 Christine Wallace, John and Melville) 
 - though only three generally play at 
 any one time. The husband and wife

 two sons plays drums.

{electronic accordions}and a set of    
 "champion drums". These include one   
 snare drum, one foot drum, two high   
 tandems and one floor tandem, a high- 
 hat and one cymbal.
