		<content> If the cattle are unwell in any way,  
 this may affect the quality and       
 quantity  of the milk produced.       
                                       
 Another problem for the farm worker,  
 which is the reason why many people do
 not want to work on farms, is that the
 longest working days tend to be during
 the best of the summer weather and    
 some workers have to work from 6.00 am
 to 10.00 pm with very few breaks for  
 several days on the trot.             
                                       
 The main breeds are{Hereford/Fresian} 
 cross to give a good milk yield.  An  
 average of{4.5 gallons}per cow per day
 is produced.  The milk is sold through
 the{Scottish Milk Marketing{Board.}   
 Cows are kept indoors from October to 
 April but it varies depending on the  
 mildness of the winter.
