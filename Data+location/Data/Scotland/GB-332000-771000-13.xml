		<title>13SHEEP FARMING IN THE BLOCK.</title>
		<content>    One of the two shepherds in the    
 block has in his care during the      
 summer months a total of approx. 1805 
 sheep i.e. 700 ewes, 260 hogs, 25 rams
 and 820 lambs.                        
    Lambing is kept late, usually about
 17th. April, since falls of snow and  
 severe weather conditions are not     
 unknown in March and April.           
    There are about 2/3 clippings per  
 year held in June (hogs) and July     
 (ewes). Around August/September old   
 ewes ,perhaps about 200,are sold in   
 Kirriemuir. About 270 ewe lambs are   
 kept for stock while the other 550 are
 fattened. Some of these are sold in   
 Forfar for meat while the rest are    
 sold for export in Lockerbie.         
    The breed of the sheep in the block
 is Blackface or Blackface cross       
 Swaledale.                            
                                       </content>
