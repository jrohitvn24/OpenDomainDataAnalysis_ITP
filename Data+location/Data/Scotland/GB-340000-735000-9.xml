		<title>09THE BROILER UNIT</title>
		<content> Like the piggery this is part of a    
 larger chicken rearing and marketing  
 organisation. The unit is situated on 
 the old airfield. Day old chicks are  
 brought here from the hatchery at     
 Kinross to be reared. The chicks run  
 free on the floor of 8 large sheds and
 are fed a special wheat mix prepared  
 by the company. Great care must be    
 taken to ensure that the temperature  
 remains at the correct setting as the 
 birds grow. Special alarm systems are 
 built in to prevent overheating or    
 break down of the electrical hot air  
 system. When the chickens are 6 to 7  
 weeks old they are sent to the firm's 
 factory at Coupar Angus where they are
 killed and prepared for market. The   
 labour force at the unit consists of a
 manager, a foreman and 3 workers. The 
 chicken manure is given away free to  
 local farmers.                        </content>
