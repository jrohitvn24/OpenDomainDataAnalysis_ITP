		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> Almost two thirds of this block are   
 covered by the sea and the other third
 is farmland. The land rises gradually 
 from the waters of Udale Bay, giving  
 beautiful views across the Cromarty   
 Firth to Easter Ross and the now      
 disused aluminium smelter at          
 Invergordon. Out in the Firth, there  
 are often oil rigs which come here to 
 be repaired. The waters of the Firth  
 are very often quite busy with the oil
 rigs and their repair vessels and with
 the Naval vessels which put into      
 Invergordon. There are no villages or 
 shops, though there is one garage and 
 petrol station which is at the extreme
 end of the village of Jemimaville,    
 and which serves a very large area of 
 the Black Isle. The farming is of     
 the mixed arable type, with beef      
 cattle and sheep,as in the other areas
 of the Black    Isle.                 </content>
