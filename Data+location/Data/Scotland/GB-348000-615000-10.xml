		<title>10HAWICK FIRE STATION.</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Hawick Fire Station was built in  
 l973. Everyone of the firemen in      
 Hawick enjoy their job very much. Some
 of the men have had accidents in fires
 themselves and have been injured. The 
 shifts are called watches and the four
 colours of watches are red, white,    
 blue and green. There are seven men in
 each watch so that means there are 28 
 men in the whole of the Hawick fire   
 service. There are three fire engines 
 in Hawick, one is manned by a whole   
 time crew and two are manned by a part
 time crew. The fire engines get called
 out roughly l2 to 2O times in a month.
 Sometimes on the way to a fire the    
 fire engine can have a puncture. There
 have been crashes but Hawick has been 
 fortunate in this respect.
