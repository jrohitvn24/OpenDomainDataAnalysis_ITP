		<title>09FISHING IN SKERRIES</title>
		<content> Fishing in Skerries like a lot of     
 other isles in Shetland. I goes back  
 to the age of the{yoal}and{sixern}and 
 has developed over the years. Even    
 today the community  depends on the   
 sea and what it gives.                
 The biggest in the Skerries fleet is  
 72 foot long{COMET LK253.}The next is 
 56 foot long{HORIZON LK250,}both were 
 built in Norway. Lastly come{JASPER   
{LK57}and{BOY JAN LK244}both bought    
 second hand. The Boy Jan is used for  
 service to the{salmon farm}which at   
 the moment is growing 45,000 fish. The
 fish landed are mostly white fish, but
 rough fish are also caught. Herring   
 have not been fished here in many     
 years. The lobster has not been fished
 here commercially for some time but   
 people do fish them in small boats in 
 the Autumn. Fishing is a popular      
 Summer pastime using small boats.     </content>
