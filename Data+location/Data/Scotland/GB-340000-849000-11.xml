tourist centre,it attracts a lot of    
passing trade and is a good base for   
anyone touring the N.E.of Scotland.    
 One of the popular attractions is the 
Whisky Trail.The Trail follows a route 
of about 60 miles through beautiful    
countryside and includes visits to six 
malt whisky distilleries.              
 The Festival of Traditional Music and 
Song takes place in Keith on a weekend 
in June each year.Ceilidhs,concerts and
musical competitions are held featuring
the traditional music of N.E.Scotland. 
 Around Keith there are several        
interesting walks.One of the most      
popular is to the Falls of Tarnash     
which are on the Burn of Drum about    
a mile from the town.                  
Visitors may stay in one of the 8
