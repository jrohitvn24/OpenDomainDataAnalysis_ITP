		<title>07Traffic  on A737,Paisley</title>
		<content>   A survey was taken of the traffic   
 which passes our school. We took two  
 surveys, one on the afternoon of{     
{Tuesday 28th May}and another on the   
 morning of{Wednesday 29th May  1985}. 
   A total of{1841}vehicles passed     
 altogether. The commonest type of     
 vehicles was the car with{1405};{261} 
 lorries,{21}bikes,{80}buses and{76}   
 private vans also passed the{John     
{Neilson HS}.                          
   There is no doubt that the {A737}is 
 a very busy road and therefore        
 dangerous.This causes great concern as
 there are many houses and schools in  
 the area and children are constantly  
 in danger as they tend not to use     
 pedestrian crossings.                 
   Only recently, one of our younger   
 pupils was knocked down and fractured 
 his hip.                              
                                       </content>
