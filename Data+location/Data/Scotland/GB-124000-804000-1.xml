		<title>01THE ISLE OF CANNA</title>
		<content>                                       
 The island of Canna is the most       
 westerly of the small isles of the    
 inner Hebrides. It is almost 5 miles  
 long and about 1 mile wide. The island
 of Sanday, which is connected to to   
 Canna by a footbridge, is nearly 2    
 miles long and up to 0.75 miles wide. 
 The 2 islands are hereafter referred  
 to collectively as Canna.             
 The population of Canna is currently  
 17 people. The majority of those      
 employed work for the National Trust  
 for Scotland who were given the island
 in 1981 by the previous owner Dr John 
 Lorne Campbell. Canna has been treated
 as a bird sanctuary since 1938. The   
 whole island, although farmed, is     
 designated a Nature Conservancy       
 Council Site of Special Scientific    
 Interest for biological and geological
 reasons.                              </content>
