		<title>06A DAY AT THE "TATTIES"</title>
		<content> In our area, it is  possible to make  
 extra pocket money at different times 
 of the year. In October we get a two  
 week holiday and many people go potato
 picking, otherwise known as "tattie   
 howkin'".                             
 You have to be up about 6.20a.m to be 
 ready for a day at the tatties.I get a
 lift up to the field on the back of a 
 trailor. We start work at 7.15 in the 
 morning and work right through to     
 8.30. We get a about 20 minutes for a 
 "piecie time", then back to work.You  
  have to work quite quickly because   
 the men who throw the tatties into the
 trailer do not care if your back is   
 sore.                                 
 At 12.00 we have our lunch.This break 
 lasts for half an hour.The last break 
 is at 3.20  and ends at 3.30. About 15
 minutes from the end the gaffer comes 
 round with the money.                 </content>
