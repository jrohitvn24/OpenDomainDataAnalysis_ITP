		<content>   The education in East Kilbride is   
 very thorough with six primary schools
 and two high schools in our 'D' block.
 There is never far to walk to school, 
 and with the under passes and so on   
 there is a high level of safety.      
  Just now all over the country        
 teachers are in protest over their pay
 which is too small.                   
  There are several nurseries which    
 cater for 3_5 year olds.Then they go  
 to primary school till they are twelve
 .At this stage they have High school  
 which they attend till they are 16 or 
 17 years of age.After this stage they 
 may take further education in college 
  or university _although these are not
     compulsory .                      
 In primary the main mathematics is    
 Scottish Primary Mathematics Group and
 in High School there are modules.     
   Most people like school.            </content>
