		<title>11FARMING CHANGES SINCE 1930'S</title>
		<content> on marginal farms,near Hownam, in the 
 Scottish Borders,government grants and
 medical research have led to improved 
 methods and more stock.Sale animals,  
 required to be lean,so continental    
 sires imported to cross with native   
 breeds.Winter feeding has improved,hay
 turnips and cereal for sheep;hay and  
 silage,sometimes from sealed plastic  
 sacks,for cattle.Calves get extra in a
 creep.Machines  have taken the heavy  
 work out of farming.Hay and straw are 
 formed into bales of various shape,the
 rolled ones lying outside till needed.
 No thatched stacks are seen now, the  
 combine harvests in one operaion.Grain
 is bought in on marginal farms, from  
 those in a more fertile area. Once,a  
 sack tied with string kept the worker 
 dry,with tackety boots on his feet.Now
 he has a comfortable light suit of    
 plastic,including boots and gloves.   </content>
