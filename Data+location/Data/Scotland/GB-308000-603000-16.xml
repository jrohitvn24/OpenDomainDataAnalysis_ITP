 British Isles 1974 saw a change in the
 pattern of local government.The Town  
 Council,with the Provost as its figure
 head,and 10 members having total      
 responsibility for town disappeared.In
 its place we have the present 3-tier  
 set-up.{THE COMMUNITY COUNCIL}with 12 
 elected members but acting mainly as a
 pressure group.{THE DISTRICT COUNCIL} 
 with 1 Moffat member,based in Annan   
 and having control of Environment,    
 Housing and Tourism.{THE REGIONAL     
{COUNCIL}in Dumfries having 1 district 
 representative and wider powers in    
 Roads&amp;Transportation,Education etc.   
   Many local people feel that local   
 affairs are controlled from afar and  
 that local interests would be better  
 served had{COMMUNITY COUNCILS}more    
 power.Many older people regret the    
 passing of the{OFFICE OF PROVOST.     </content>
