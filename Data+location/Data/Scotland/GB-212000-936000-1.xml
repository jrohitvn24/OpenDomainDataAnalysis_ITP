		<title>01S. ISLANDS - EDRACHILLES BAY</title>
		<content> This area is nearly entirely composed 
 of sea. There is only a small bit of  
 mainland in the east and a few small  
 uninhabited islands. On the mainland  
 there is part of the Duartbeg Nature  
 Reserve which is composed of deciduous
 trees. It is one of the few areas od  
 deciduous woodland in North West      
 Scotland. There is a small road       
 leading to the reserve, at the end of 
 which is a derelict farmhouse. On the 
 coastline there is a large amount of  
 seaweed which grows well in the       
 relatively warm Atlantic Ocean.
