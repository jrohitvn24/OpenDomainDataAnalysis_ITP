		<title>01Land north of Kingsburgh</title>
		<content> Main road of Northern Skye goes       
 through top part of this area.  Not   
 the original road - new one was built 
 to accommodate 2 lanes of traffic.    
 Much of the area is undulating        
 moorland from the main road down to   
 the shore of Loch Snizart Beag.       
 Across the loch is Lyndale  Point -   
 baren moorland with a couple of small 
 inland lochs.  Much of the area is    
 uninhabited.  The only settlement in  
 the area is part of Kingsburgh, but   
 many of the houses are in ruins and   
 crofts (system where land was split   
 into regular plots and rented out to  
 families) no longer worked.  Much of  
 the land used as rough grazing for    
 sheep.  Forestry encroaches on this   
 area - not natural but specially      
 planted by the Forestry commission.
