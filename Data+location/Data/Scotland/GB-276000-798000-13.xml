		<title>13FARMING in SPEY VallEY (3)</title>
		<content> As the farms here lie close to, if not
 in, the flood plain of the Spey Valley
 the risk of{flooding}is constant. The 
 spey waters are held back at{the Spey 
{Dam,}some 12 miles upriver and if     
 the overflow gates are opened due to a
 build up there a sudden heavy flow    
 ensues. The police are then notified  
 and a{flood warning telephone system  
 instigated. A call at 4 a.m. is not   
 unusual and farmers may have to       
 venture out to ensure their livestock 
 will be safe. To round up and count   
 seventy head of cattle on a dark      
 stormy night requires a special       
 dedication and, of course, his whole  
 livelihood depends on this commitment.
 His work is a{seven day week}job      
 although once the livestock is        
 attended to in the mornings time can  
 be found for market, shopping or an   
 occasional game of curling in Aviemore</content>
