<title>39FARMING AROUND BUCHLYVIE 1 - updated  2011</title>
<content>

Farming is the main industry still but has seen many changes since 1986. What with B.S.E. in 1996 and Foot &amp; Mouth Disease in 2001, although not in this area, the restrictions of movement of cattle and sheep left farmers to keep animals on their farms with no movement to markets or from farm to farm. In 1996 animal passports were introduced and every animal must have an eartag on each ear. &lt;br />&lt;br />There are now only 3 farms which milk cows. Gowstone milks 100 Friesian and Jersey cows. Gartentruach uses robot milking for its 120 Friesian and Holstein cows while Wester Mye milks 70 Friesians by milking machine and grows barley, silage and hay to feed them. Woodend has no cattle and its 340 acres are rented out to neighbouring farmers. Cashley was sold to Gowstone and Whiteleys farms, with the farm buildings converted into houses. No farmers grow potatoes or turnips now. Causwayhead has a small beef herd. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
