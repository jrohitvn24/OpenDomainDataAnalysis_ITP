		<content> Almost half the dwellings throughout  
 the village were built by the{local   
{authority}about 30 years ago. There   
 are flats and semi-detached houses.   
 Both within and outside the village,  
 the{privately-owned houses}show more  
 variety, and may be up to 250 years   
 old. Several are of selected red      
 sandstone, others are of mixed stones 
 found in the fields. Most roofs are of
 slate. Many walls are harled or       
 painted white.{A new development}of 26
 houses and bungalows was built 7 years
 ago.These vary in size, but the       
 planning authorities decreed their    
 harled brick walls and tiled roofs.   
 A{typical house}has a garden, views of
 the hills, a downstairs kitchen,      
 lounge and dining room, and upstairs  
 a bathroom and 2,3 or 4 bedrooms.     
{Common luxuries}are a study, utility  
 room, shower, and downstairs lavatory.</content>
