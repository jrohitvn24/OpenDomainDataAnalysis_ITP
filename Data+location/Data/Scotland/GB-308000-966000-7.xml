		<title>07Gala Week</title>
		<content> We have a Gala Week to raise funds to 
 improve the town's amenities. The     
 first one was held in 1949 at Millbank
 and there has been one every year     
 since. The most important parts of the
 Gala are the open air crowning, floats
 and weather. The Gala takes place     
 during the second week in July. Flags,
 decorations and a stage are put up the
 week before by the Town Council. Loud 
 speaker vans tour the streets telling 
 people about coming events such as    
 swimming competitions, discos, coffee 
 mornings, treasure hunts, baby shows, 
 "It's-a-Knockout" and ceilidhs. They  
 hope to have a mini-marathon and a    
 break dancing contest. The newly      
 crowned Gala Queen leads the          
 procession in a horse drawn carriage  
 followed by the Thurso Pipe Band and  
 floats with people in fancy dress.    
 Last year Â£3000 was raised.           </content>
