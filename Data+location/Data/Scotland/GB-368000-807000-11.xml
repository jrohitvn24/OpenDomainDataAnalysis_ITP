		<title>11ANNUAL EVENTS</title>
		<content> "Burns Night" is one of the annual    
 events in Midmar.It is held on the    
 25{th}January.We talk about Robert    
 Burns, sing songs and read his poetry.
 We eat haggis and when it comes in,   
 the piper walks in front.Everyone gets
 a glass of whisky to wash down the    
 haggis.Someone makes a speech called  
 the Immortal Memory.A man gives a     
 speech toasting the lassies and says  
 how much we need them.After that a    
 lassie stands up and replies to his   
 toast and then there is dancing.Most  
 people wear kilts.One of the most     
 important events is the Ceilidh.We    
 have dancing and people singing and   
 playing violins.Some dances are called
 the Gay Gordons, Strip the Willow,    
 the Eightsome Reel and the Dashing    
 White Sergeant.At the end they play   
 "Auld Lang Syne"                      
                                       </content>
