		<content>{ 100}senior pupils were asked,"Where  
 does the main breadwinner in the      
 family go to work?" The results were: 
                                       
 Local       {8}   Kirkcaldy        {5}
 Dunfermline {8}   Lochgelly        {3}
 Glenrothes  {2}   Rosyth Dockyard {13}
 Cowdenbeath{21}   Other           {14}
    There were{26}unemployed.          
                                       
  Locally, there are not many shops for
 people to work in, but there is the   
 gas plant and open-cast mine at       
 Westfield.                            
  Cowdenbeath, where the biggest number
 work, has shops and factories and     
 there is a good bus service.          
  Although Glenrothes is a big town,   
 has lots of factories and is not far, 
 there is no public transport from     
 Ballingry.
