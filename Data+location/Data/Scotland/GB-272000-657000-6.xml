		<title>06MONEYLENDERS</title>
		<content> Jean and Colin were short of money.   
 Colin had just found a new job after  
 six months unemployment and their     
 children needed new clothes and shoes.
 One morning a man knocked at the door 
 and offered to help out with their    
 money problem.  He sugested a loan of 
{Â£50}to be paid back at{Â£2.50}per week.
 Jean accepted his offer and took the  
 money, but she did not sign any       
 documents.  The moneylender did not   
 mention how much interest she would   
 have to repay on the loan.  By the    
 time most of the payments had been    
 made, Jean was again very short of    
 money and was persuaded to borrow a   
 further{Â£75}to pay off the original   
 loan and give her cash to spend.      
 After two more loans Jean was repaying
{Â£16}per week which she could not      
 afford and the total amount she owed  
 was now many hundreds of pounds.      </content>
