		<title>11SCHOOL IN CUMBERNAULD - 1</title>
		<content> My school is called ST. Francis of    
 Assisi.It is a primary school, which  
 means it takes children from 5 to 12  
 years of age.Our school{like many in  
{our town of Cumbernauld is quite new.}
 In fact our school is the newest and  
 is about 4 years old.All of the other 
 schools in the town have been built in
 the last 25 years except Cumbernauld  
 Village School,which is still in the  
 original building in the old village. 
 Our school building is different from 
 other primaries in the town because it
 only has 7 classrooms,and the others  
 usually have at least 14 rooms.The    
 size of schools is becoming smaller   
 because pupils are becoming fewer.The 
 number of primary school pupils has   
 reduced so much that in the past few  
 years {2 primary schools have had to  
{close}although the buildings were new.
