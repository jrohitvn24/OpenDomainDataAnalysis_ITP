		<title>05LOCAL HISTORY OF CHURCH</title>
		<content> On the site of the kirk at Inveresk   
 about 3,000 years ago there was a     
 Druid sacrificial temple.  Roman      
 relics have been found in the area    
 around the kirk and graveyard.  By    
 using aerial photographs,             
 archaeologists have shown that there  
 was a triple line of defensive        
 ditches.  Christianity was first      
 brought to Musselburgh by an Irish    
 woman called Modwenna about 500 ad.   
 Since that time two stone churches    
 have been built on the same site.  The
 Reverend Adamson is the 18th minister 
 of Inveresk Kirk since 1562.  The     
 church has some beautiful features eg 
 the Strachan stained glass window, the
 communion table (it is thought to be  
 from Antwerp) dates from the 1700's   
 and shows the Last Supper in          
 magnificent carving.
