		<title>14FARMING IN BRORA  2</title>
		<content> THE SEEDS OF CORN ARE CUT OFF THE     
 STALKS AND CRUSHED. OATS AND BARLEY   
 SEEDS ARE FED TO ANIMALS.             
   FARMS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO FARMERS 
 BECAUSE IT IS THEIR LIVING.MOST FARMS 
 ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO BUY BECAUSE OF  
 ALL THE LAND WHICH IS INVOLVED.A LOT  
 OF BOYS THAT HAVE LEFT SCHOOL AND ARE 
 ON THE DOLE GET EMPLOYED ON FARMS.    
   IN THE SUMMER TIME YOU GET SOME     
 SALES IN BRORA. THEY ARE HELD UP NEAR 
 CLYNE.THERE ARE SHEEP SALES AND CATTLE
 SALES. IF ALL THE ANIMALS ARE NOT     
 BOUGHT, THEY GET SOLD TO THE SLAUGHTER
 HOUSE .                               
   MOST OF THE FARMS ARE RUN BY        
 MACHINERY.IT SAVES THE FARMER AND THE 
 HORSE FROM HARD WORK.THE MOST COMMON  
 MACHINES USED ARE : BALERS, COMBINE   
 HARVESTERS, TRACTORS AND TRAILORS,    
 PLOUGHS AND CUTTERS.                  
                                       </content>
