		<content>   All along the coastline are steep   
 cliffs and sandy beaches.Long ago the 
 hidden coves and deep caves made this 
 an ideal coastline for smugglers. Some
 houses in Rockcliffe are built close  
 to the cliff and have used it to make 
 interesting gardens.                  
   From our school,whichever way you   
 look you will see hills and trees. The
 hills are grassy except for some rocks
 and bushes on the tops. The highest is
 White Hill which is 143 metres above  
 sea level. All around are fields which
 change colour as the crops are grown  
 and harvested and where cattle or     
 sheep or horses graze peacefully.     
   The Forestry Commission has planted 
 fir trees above Rockcliffe and the big
 Dalbeattie Forest begins near White   
 Loch,but there are still many patches 
 of very old oak, ash and beech trees.
