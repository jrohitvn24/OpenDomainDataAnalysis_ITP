There are 3 senior community nurses/unscheduled care practitions who work part time in rotation.The nurses are well supported by the doctors at Portree and Broadford Hospitals.&lt;br />&lt;br />Other health workers such as the school nurse,the dietician,the podiatrist(foot care specialist) and the speech and lanuage therapist visit the Island on a regular basis.Sometimes an occupational therapist will come across and do an assesment of the disabled's home.The nearest hospitals are Portree Hospital and the Dr Mackinnon Memorial Hospital at Broadford.Both journeys are a twenty five minute ferry journey away plus a fifteen road journey there after. The nearest general hospital is Raigmore which is 108 miles away.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
