		<title>05Growing Up On Farms Is Fun.</title>
		<content>  We all agree it is great fun living  
 on a farm.We would not like town life 
 because of traffic &amp; fumes. Here is   
 fresh air &amp; quiet space to play.Nearby
 live relatives.Only our cats dislike  
 visitors who couldn't even take a     
 photo of them.Our collies work.Our    
 cats keep down vermin.Girls &amp; boys    
 alike enjoy working with animals &amp; on 
 the land or driving when old enough to
 help our fathers.Girls also help in   
 the house.                            
 Among us we play the fiddle,recorder, 
 piano,guitar &amp; chanter before         
 progressing to bagpipes.Some of us go 
 to Highland Dancing.Many of our homes 
 &amp; farms are about a hundred  years old
 &amp; are often passed down through       
 generations.                          
 We see nature around us though pests, 
 especially rabbits,are controlled by  
 shooting,snaring or ferreting.        </content>
