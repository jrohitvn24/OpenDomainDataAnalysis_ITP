		<title>06Burreldale Moss in Bourtie</title>
		<content> Peat as a fuel has traditionally been 
 harvested from the Burreldale Moss on 
 the edge of Bourtie parish.  The main 
 portion of the Moss, however, lies    
 within the parish of keithhall and    
 Kinkell.  Residents have by tradition 
 the right to cast (dig) their own peat
 for private use, but only one farmer  
 now does this. The method used        
 consists of removing the top layer of 
 turf and heather; then peat is cast in
 rectangular chunks measuring 2 x 1 ft.
 Starting at the surface and working   
 downwards on a peat face approximately
 five feet long.  The best peat is     
 found in the lower layers.  The peat  
 blocks are then set up in pyramidal   
 stacks or rickles to dry for a week   
 and then removed to the farm for      
 stacking outside in peat walls.  Peat 
 stacked outside burns better than peat
 from inside a shed.                   </content>
