		<title>13GROUP THERAPY-GALSTON</title>
		<content> If children or young adults are in    
 court or home trouble it is the duty  
 of the Social Worker to take the child
 into his/hers confidence and try to   
 help the child to speak about their   
 troubles. This is called I.T. or      
 Intermediate Treatment.They introduce 
 them to groups of children with       
 similar promlems.They will help the   
 chidren to talk amongst themselves and
 mend their ways.After a few weeks they
 will take them on outings to try and  
 show them there is another side to    
 life.Then they will write a report to 
 the Children's Panel and hopefully    
 re-integrate them successfully into   
 their community.The police are happy  
 with this method as it seems to help  
 the crime rate in Galston which is    
 below average for the region.The main 
 crime is vandalism which is committed 
 by the age group in the group therapy.</content>
