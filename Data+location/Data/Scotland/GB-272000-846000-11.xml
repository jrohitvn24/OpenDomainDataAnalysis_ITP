		<title>11CROFTING</title>
		<content> The crofter we interviewed told us    
 that the croft has been in his family 
 for 40 years.Altogether it covers 5   
 acres of land.He keeps no cattle but  
 has some sheep,hens and a couple of   
 dogs.He grows cabbages,oats,potatoes  
 and hay.Crofting is not his full-time 
 occupation.He works in Inverness and  
 crofts part-time.Many of the people on
 neighbouring crofts do not work their 
 land but rent it to one man who works 
 several crofts as a small farm.As he  
 has a larger area of land to work than
 one croft,he can afford to buy        
 expensive equipment to help him.      
 Registered crofts can only be owned by
 people who have a crofting background 
 but in our area many people have      
 applied to have crofts de-crofted so  
 they can use them as dwelling houses.
