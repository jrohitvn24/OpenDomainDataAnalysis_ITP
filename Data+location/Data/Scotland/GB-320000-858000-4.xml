		<title>04Making Whisky.</title>
		<content>  The ingredients which go into making 
 whisky are malted barley,water and    
 yeast. The barley is crushed into     
 grist and seven and a half ton loads  
 of it are loaded into the Masher      
 Warts. After water is passed through  
 the grist at increasing temperatures  
 it lies for seven and a  half hours   
 and then the wet grist called "Graft" 
 is put into the stills.Once in the    
 still it is boiled and vapour rises.As
 the vapour cools it runs away as a    
 clear alcoholic liquid.               
  The Distillery produces 14,000 litres
 of whisky a day.The whisky has to be  
 stored in Oak Barrels for at least 3  
 years before becoming real whisky.    
 During this time the barrels affect   
 the colour of the liquid and it turns 
 to its usual tan colour.
