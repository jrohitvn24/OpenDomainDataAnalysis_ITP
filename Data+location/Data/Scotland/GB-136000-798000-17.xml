		<title>17TOURISM, RHUM</title>
		<content> Tourists visit Rhum mainly during the 
 summer and at Easter. Some only come  
 for a day trip on The Shearwater which
 sails from Arisaig. A large cruise    
 ship, The Black Prince, visits Rhum   
 occasionally for the day. Both these  
 types of tourist may go hillwalking   
 or stroll around the village in this  
 short time.                           
                                       
 Many of the tourists use the          
 Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, The       
 Lochmor, to get to Rhum. Tourists can 
 stay in the Castle, camp on the       
 shore_side site or stay in a bothy.   
 The Castle offers a choice of standard
 of accomodation.                      
                                       
 Slide shows describing the work       
 carried out on the Reserve are given  
 and ceilidhs are held when sufficient 
 numbers of people are on the island.  </content>
