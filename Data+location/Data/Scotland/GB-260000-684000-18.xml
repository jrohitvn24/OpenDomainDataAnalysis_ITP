		<title>18The Menzies Hall: FINTRY</title>
		<content> Built in the centre of the village by{
{Sir Walter Menzies}in 1907, it is now 
 beside an area of grass and trees.    
 Many improvements have been carried   
 out, internally by the Hall Committee,
 the District Council being responsible
 for the exterior.                     
{The main hall}is used by the Drama    
 Society, Women's Rural, aerobics class
 and badminton, large meetings, coffee 
 mornings, concerts, parties and       
 dances. Annual events held include,   
 the pantomine, flower show, crafts    
 fair and the Art Club hanging party.  
{The adjacent lesser hall}accommodates 
 bowling and is useful for small       
 meetings and for serving refreshments 
 (linked to kitchen and toilets).      
{Two small rooms}house a weekly bank   
 and twice weekly surgery. There are   
 public toilets attached.
