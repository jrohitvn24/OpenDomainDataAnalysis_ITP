		<title>13Horse riding, Murroes</title>
		<content> In this area there are{horse lessons }
 every weekend.Many people come from   
 all over, from Fife,Dundee,Broughty   
 Ferry or Monifieth.The people who own 
 all the horses are called the McKays  
 and they have 29 horses.The McKays    
 also have some horses down at         
 Camperdown and they are busy there    
 too.TheMcKays buy lots of new horses  
 and about 150 people go there on      
 Saturday or Sunday.These are some of  
 the horses.Sooty,Annie,Queenie and    
 Goldie.                               
                                       
   They also have lots of donkeys.     
 About twice a year they have a{donkey}
 derby.My dad makes up a silly schedule
 with lots of  funny pictures.         
   The riding lessons cost Â£2 and you  
 get jumping or trekking. You don't get
 to choose, but I enjoy it.
