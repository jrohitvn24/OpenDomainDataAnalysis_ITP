		<title>04PAPER MILL</title>
		<content> The Guardbridge Paper Mill was        
 established in 1872 and had a capital 
 of Â£30,000.  Building of the mill was 
 finished in August of the next year.  
 Today the Paper Mill has a capital of 
 over Â£840,000 and has 360 workers.    
 The Paper Mill delivers worldwide and 
 gets its raw materials from various   
 countries.  The paper today is made   
 from wood fibre, esparto grass and    
 cotton.  Pulp bales are added to      
 thousands of gallons of water.  The   
 mixture passes to a machine which     
 binds the fibres together then dries  
 it by squeezing the water from the    
 paper.  It is then passed over suction
 boxes then steam heated in a cylinder.
 The paper is then cut, packaged and   
 distributed by a sister company called
 Scotflow which has 10 lorries for the 
 Papermill.
