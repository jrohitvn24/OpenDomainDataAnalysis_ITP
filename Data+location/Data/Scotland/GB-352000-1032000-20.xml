		<title>20SEALS IN EDAY</title>
		<content>    You may find seals on the shore at 
 any time of year but more especially  
 in October when they up to have their 
 young.                                
    The grey seals are roughly 1.5m in 
 length. Their habitat is either an    
 offshore sandbank or some low tidal   
 rocks.                                
    You will be almost sure to find    
 seals on Sealskerry where they lie in 
 the sun and can be heard calling to   
 one another from a fair distance away.
    For some years the seal pups were  
 hunted for their fur in an annual seal
 cull but for the last two or three    
 years this has not been happening. The
 fishermen now complain that the number
 of seals is on the increase and they  
 eating up all the stocks of fish.
