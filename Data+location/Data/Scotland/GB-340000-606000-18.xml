		<content> MANY TOURISTS USE THE A7 AS IT IS     
 DESIGNATED A SCENIC ROUTE FROM        
 CARLISLE TO EDINBURGH AND CARRIES A   
 LOT LESS TRAFFIC THAN THE MOTORWAYS.  
 THIS TOGETHER WITH A GREAT VARIATION  
 OF SCENERY MAKES A WELCOME ENTRY INTO 
 SCOTLAND AND LEADS THEM TO THE        
 KNITWEAR MANUFACTURING TOWN OF HAWICK.
 THE BED AND BREAKFAST ESTABLISHMENT   
 PROVIDES A ROOM WITH SHARED BATHROOM  
 AND A BREAKFAST OF CEREAL, BACON AND  
 EGG, TOAST AND TEA IN THE MORNING FOR 
 ABOUT Â£7.50 PER PERSON PER NIGHT. THE 
 HOTEL PROVIDES SIMILAR ACCOMMODATION  
 WITH BAR FACILITIES, A CHOICE OF      
 EVENING MEALS, HAS PRIVATE BATHROOMS  
 AND CHARGES Â£13 PER PERSON PER NIGHT. 
 THESE BUSINESSES PROVIDE WORK FOR TWO 
 FAMILIES AND OCCASIONAL EXTRA HELPERS 
 AND SO HELP KEEP THE POPULATION       
 STEADY.
