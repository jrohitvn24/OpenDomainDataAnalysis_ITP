		<content> The caravan park is very popular and  
 busy during the summer months due to  
 its advantageous position in relation 
 to the town and beaches.One lady and  
 her family have come here for six     
 years running.After renting a caravan 
 for the first few years,she bought one
 which is permanently there.In general 
 she thought the facilities available  
 in the caravan park and St Andrews    
 were not terribly good with most      
 things geared towards golfing.She has,
 however,found the facilities in the   
 camp site have improved with the new  
 hall and bar completed this year.She  
 felt that children were not catered   
 for terribly well with few            
 entertainments.The beach is very      
 convenient and good walks are near at 
 hand.In general she and most          
 caravaners are pleased with the site  
 and area.                             </content>
