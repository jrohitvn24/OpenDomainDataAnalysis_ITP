		<title>07Sheep farming in Inversnaid</title>
		<content> In November you put the tup out to the
 hill so they can mate the ewes. In    
 January you bring the tups off the    
 hill. In the Spring we have dosing and
 dipping. We dose the{sheep}to get rid 
 of worms. We dip the sheep to prevent 
 scab. At the beginning of Summer we   
 clip hoggs and eild ewes. The hoggs   
 are hard to clip because it is the    
 first time they are clipped. In the   
 middle of summer we do milk clipping  
 i.e. clipping the ewes that have      
 lambs. It is very arduous because you 
 have to work long hours. At the end of
 summer or beginning of autumn we do   
 speaning ie.taking the lamb away from 
 their mothers. This is the time you   
 have to go to the{market}with wethers 
 and substandard ewe lambs.
