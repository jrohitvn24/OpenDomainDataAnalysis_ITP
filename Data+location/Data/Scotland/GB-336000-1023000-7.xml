		<content>   Ploughing begins in January and the 
 land is ready for sewing by March or  
 April. Barley or Grass-seed is usually
 sewn.  A well treated field of grass  
 will last from 7 to 12 years before   
 ploughing and reseeding.  Slurry and  
 chemical fertilizers are increasingly 
 used to ensure a high crop yield.     
   The main fodder crop is silage with 
 some farms taking 2 cuts, one in early
 June and one in early August. Other   
 farms cut once in late June.  Orkney's
 climate is more suited to silage than 
 hay although some farms supplement    
 their main crop with hay.             
   In September the barley is harvested
 A combine and driver is usually hired.
 In winter the propcorned barley is    
 bruised, mixed with minerals and fed  
 to the cattle along with silage. The  
 barley straw is used for feeding or   
 bedding.                              </content>
