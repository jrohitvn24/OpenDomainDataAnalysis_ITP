 IN CLASS WE DREW A CHART AND THEN WENT
 AROUND ALL THE CLASSES TO FIND OUT HOW
 MANY PEOPLE PLAYED EACH GAME. THE MOST
 POPULAR GAME THAT DAY WAS FOOTBALL    
 THEN CHASES. ONLY FOUR PEOPLE PLAYED  
 BULLDOGS. WE MADE A NEW LIST AND PUT  
 THE MOST POPULAR GAME AT THE TOP AND  
 THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO PLAYED THAT
 GAME BESIDE IT. FOOTBALL 75, CHASES   
 43, HIDE AND SEEK 41, BALLS 28, ROPES 
 15, BULLDOGS 4, POLE TIG, ROUNDERS,   
 PINK MURDER AND HOSPITAL TIG, ALL 0.
