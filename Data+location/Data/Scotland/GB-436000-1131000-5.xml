 BRIDGE END.WE COMPARED THEM WITH      
 SURNAMES IN HAMNAVOE.INKSTER IS THE   
 MOST POPULAR SURNAME IN BRIDGE        
 END,FOLLOWED BY CHRISTIE THEN SMITH.IN
 HAMNAVOE POTTINGER IS THE MOST POPULAR
 THEN LAURENSON,AND FULLERTON,GOODLAD  
 AND INKSTER ARE THIRD EQUAL.          
     MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE   
 SAME SURNAME ARE STILL CLOSELY RELATED
 AND TEND TO LIVE IN ONE PART OF THE   
 ISLAND.PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO MOVE   
 FROM ONE PART TO THE OTHER NOW.SINCE  
 THE BRIDGE CAME FAMILIES HAVE MOVED IN
 FROM OUTSIDE BURRA OR OUTSIDE SHETLAND
 AND THERE MAY BE ONLY ONE FAMILY WITH 
 THAT SURNAME.SOMETIMES PEOPLE MOVE IN 
 WITH THE SAME SURNAME AS PEOPLE       
 ALREADY THERE.THERE ARE SEVERAL SMITHS
 WHO ARE NOT RELATED TO OTHER SMITHS IN
 BURRA.
