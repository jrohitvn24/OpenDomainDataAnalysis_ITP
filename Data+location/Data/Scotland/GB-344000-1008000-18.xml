		<title>18FARMING</title>
		<content>  Farming has always been important in 
 Orkney.At one time most of the people 
 lived on small crofts but now there   
 are fewer people and the farms are    
 larger ( 130 acres is average ) and   
 modern.                               
  Orkney{beef}is famous.It comes from  
 the herds of Aberdeen Angus, Hereford,
 Charolais and other beef breeds.      
{ Milk}is less important, but Orkney   
{cheese}is made and exported.          
{ Sheep}numbers have increased, mainly 
 Cheviots, though Orkney does have a   
 unique local breed_the{North Ronaldsay
 which exists on seaweed for most of   
 the year and which looks like a goat. 
{ Barley}is the main grain,but in      
 addition some{bere}( a primitive      
 variety of barley ) is grown for use  
 in bere bannocks.                     
{ Goats,hens,pigs,horses}and other     
 animals are less important.           </content>
