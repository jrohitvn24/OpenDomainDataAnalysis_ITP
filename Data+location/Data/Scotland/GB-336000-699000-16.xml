		<title>16 Methil Docks</title>
		<content> Methil main trade for generations was 
 the export of coal from local coalpits
 initially owned by the Laird of Wemyss
 He was responsible for the development
 of the docks in 1869.The docks were   
 then bought by North British Rail Co  
 in 1889 but since 1968 they have been 
 handled by the Fife Ports Authority.  
  The coal exports have declined,the   
 main export is now scrap metal.Imports
 are timber,wood pulp for the paper    
 mills,grain and fertiliser which go to
 Central Farmers(a co_operative set up 
 by Fife and Tayside Region).Important 
 too is steel imported to manufacture  
 the steel jackets and platform decks  
 made at nearby R.G.C. offshore        
 fabrication yard.                     
   The Forth is a sheltered deep water 
 estuary and tankers and oil rigs use  
 Methil as a service base and to do    
 repairs.                              </content>
