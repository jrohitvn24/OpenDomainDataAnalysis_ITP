		<title>18HISTORIC HOUSE.</title>
		<content> Ochiltree Castle was built in 1540 by 
 a man called Stirling. It was restored
 in 1980 and won an award.It is a good 
 example of a fortified house.         
 There have been only four families    
 living in it during its existence.The 
 present owner is Lady Rusby and her   
 husband.                              
 The house has four floors with two    
 rooms on each. Upstairs there is an   
 old fireplace and also a hole in the  
 wall called the Laird's Lug covered by
 a tapestry in the past. The Laird went
 up to this hole in the room next door 
 and listened to what  people had to   
 say about him.                        
 The grounds of the castle are quite   
 small and are surrounded by open      
 country,  now used for farming.
