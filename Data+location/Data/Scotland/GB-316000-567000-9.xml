		<content>     The{Everholm}is a large flat piece
 of ground on the eastern bank of the  
 river close to the town centre. It    
 used to be part of the grounds of the 
 castle at the Moat. For many years the
 land was used for grazing cattle but  
 in 1975 the new District Council had  
 the idea of making it into a sports   
 ground and riverside park. It took    
 until 1980 to get the idea started but
 now there are lots of attractive      
 features there. Each year new things  
 are added to make it better. There is 
 now a{trim track, football, hockey}and
{rugby pitches}as well as an{athletics 
{circuit.}Many sports clubs and        
 individuals make use of these fine new
 facilities. It is also used for some {
{Riding of the Marches}events like the{
{Cornet's Chase}and the{Raft Race.
