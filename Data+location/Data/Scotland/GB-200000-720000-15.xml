		<title>15WILD FLOWERS</title>
		<content>  I know of 70 different varieties of  
 wild flowers in Kilchrenan. They vary 
 from the very common i.e. the butter- 
 cup and daisy to the rare and         
 beautiful orchids of which there are  
 many varieties and these have now     
 become protected species.             
  We are lucky that Kilchrenan is a    
 conservation area which means that we 
 are not allowed to pick the wild-     
 flowers such as the bluebell,         
 primrose, for-get-me-not and violet   
 because they are becoming extinct in  
 other parts of Britain.               
  You can tell the condition of the    
 ground by the flowers which are       
 growing on it such as the wild iris   
 and bobcotten which grow on boggy     
 land, the speedwell and foxglove      
 which grow on dry and rocky ground,   
 and the marsh marigold and wateravon  
 which grow near rivers.               </content>
