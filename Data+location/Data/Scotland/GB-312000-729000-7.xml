		<content> This is a predominately farming area. 
 In our delineated map area there are  
 six main farms.These are both cattle  
 and arable farms.                     
                                       
 The cattle, beef and dairy, are cross 
 breeds mostly and include Ayrshire,   
 Jersey, Friesian, Galloway,           
 Aberdeen_Angus, Hereford and Highland.
                                       
 On the arable farms are grown mostly  
 raspberries, peas and potatoes as well
 as the usual oil_seed rape, wheat,    
 barley, turnips and grass for grazing 
 and silage.                           
                                       
 Of the 383 people who live in the     
 designated area  89 live in farmhouses
 or cottages outwith the two villages  
 of Guildtown and St.Martin's.
