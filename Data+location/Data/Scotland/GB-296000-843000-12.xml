		<title>12SCHOOLS IN FERNESS</title>
		<content>   The parish school for Ardclach was  
 situated  first on the west bank of   
 the River Findhorn. At that time this 
 upland farming area was the main      
 centre of population. When the village
 of Ferness  was built by the local    
 landowner, included within it was a   
 new school building at first          
 maintained privately. Additional      
 private schools in the parish also    
 existed at Fornighty, Achnatone and   
 Dulsie. In 1890 Ferness school took   
 over from Ardclach as the parish      
 school. In the period 1951- 1976 the  
 other schools closed one by one       
 leaving Ferness as the only single-   
 teacher school in the county. Until   
 recent decades the roll (formerly up  
 to about 50 pupils ) demanded a second
 teacher to be employed.
