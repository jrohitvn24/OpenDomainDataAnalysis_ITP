		<content> IN PARTS OF OUR AREA THERE IS A VERY  
 HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE (41%)          
 ESPECIALLY IN DRUMCHAPEL AND          
 KNIGHTSWOOD,WHEREAS IN BEARSDEN THERE 
 IS A VERY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WITH  
 MOST WORKERS ENGAGED IN OFFICE WORK OR
 SELF EMPLOYED.DRUMCHAPEL AND          
 KNIGHTSWOOD GAINED THESE HIGH RATES   
 WHEN THE GOODYEAR AND SINGER FACTORIES
 CLOSED DOWN WITH A LOSS OF 10000 JOBS.
                                       
 THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE AREA IS   
 BARR &amp; STROUD LTD AND SUPPLY FACTORIES
 TO THIS COMPANY IN THE AREA PROVIDE   
 FURTHER JOBS.                         
 OTHER JOBS ARE MOSTLY IN THE SERVICE  
 INDUSTRIES EG SHOPS.                  
 THERE IS A GREAT CONTRAST BETWEEN THE 
 SHOPS IN DRUMCHAPEL AND BEARSDEN.     
 DUE TO HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT THE SHOPPING 
 CENTRE IN DRUMCHAPEL IS ALMOST LIKE A 
 GHOST-TOWN.                           </content>
