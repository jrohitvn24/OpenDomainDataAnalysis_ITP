		<content>   In May there was a notice in the    
 local paper about a meeting to form a 
 BMX club in Lossiemouth. There was a  
 poor response but despite that a      
 commitee was formed. The district     
 council leased a bit of land to them  
 for four years and also gave them a   
 grant. Money was raised by holding    
 sales, a disco and  a sponsored cycle 
 run. The members drew the plans for   
 the track and had them checked by an  
 engineer. It took two to three months 
 to get planning permission. Many      
 people offered to help, both members  
 and parents. A local building firm    
 sold Quarry Red cheaply. The track was
 fully operational by November. The BMX
 club has forty-six members and it     
 costs three pounds to become a member.
