		<title>01East Lothian Farmland</title>
		<content> The area is predominately agricultural
 with a mixture of large farms like the
 Byres, Harperdean &amp; Alderston mains   
 and smaller holdings. Crops grown on  
 the larger farms include wheat, barley
 and vegetables. eg. Potatoes, leeks,  
 cabbages etc which are cultivated on a
 large scale at West Garleton but also 
 by smaler units around Camptoun. A    
 certain amount of dairy farming is    
 carried on with Alderston supporting  
 120 head of cattle plus growing       
 cereals, potatoes &amp; other vegetable   
 crops for animal feed. The upland area
 is used for grazing both beef cattle  
 and sheep. A major quarrying operation
 has been carried out at Bangley near  
 Huntington for 50 years. Manager Bob  
 Keenan explained that expansion in    
 recent years meant that 0.25 million  
 tons of crushed trachite are extracted
 annually for use in road building.    </content>
