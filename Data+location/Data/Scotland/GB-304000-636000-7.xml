		<content> In the {Biggar }area there is one {   
{Primary School,}a {Secondary School } 
 and a {List D School}. There used to  
 be a {Primary School } in the         
 neighbouring parish of {Skirling,}but 
 this was closed by the Education      
 Department of the Borders Region.     
 Biggar Primary School is close to the{
{Secondary School} and indeed it was in
 part of what is now the Secondary. Now
 the Primary is housed in the Victorian
 building,which was at one time the    
 old  Biggar High School.The {Secondary
{School }draws from a very large area  
 of the Upper Ward streching from      
 Crawford in the South to Carnwath in  
 the North. It has probably the largest
 catchment area in Lanarkshire. The {  
{List D School} at Loaningdale provides
 a important service for socially      
 deprived children with learning       
 difficulties.                         </content>
