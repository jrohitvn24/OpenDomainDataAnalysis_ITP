		<title>02CHANGING FACE OF DRUMOAK</title>
		<content> During the past twenty years          
 significant changes in the shape of   
 the parish landscape have occurred.   
 The once famous Royal Deeside Railway 
 which passed through Drumoak en route 
 to Balmoral has been lifted.In place  
 of the station yard there is now a    
 caravan site.Many field dykes (walls) 
 shown in 1970 OS Map 1:10560 have been
 demolished as farmers make larger     
 fields to suit large scale farming. On
 the roadways the A93 traversing       
 Drumoak from East to West is no longer
 a quiet country road but a busy route 
 for commuter transport to Aberdeen.   
 The village of Drumoak has also grown 
 with recent building of 60 municipal  
 and over 100 private houses.          
 Despite the changes including the     
 influx of population,Drumoak still has
 a quiet rural community atmosphere.
