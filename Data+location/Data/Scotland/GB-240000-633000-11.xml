		<title>11The Life of a Policeman</title>
		<content>{Law and Order}is the rules that govern
 our country and our D-block and people
 who don't obey these rules,{the       
{offenders,}are punished. A policeman  
 is a member of a force and he is      
 employed to keep "law and order".     
 We interviewed a policeman to find out
 what life is like for him, helping to 
 keep "law and order" in our D-block.  
 To be a policeman you have to train   
 for two years. He has been a          
 policeman for 17 years. He wears a    
 uniform like all other policeman so   
 that they can be easily recognised. He
 is an ordinary beat policeman although
 at one time he worked as a{traffic    
{policeman.}He says,"It's a good       
 job and I enjoy it. I like meeting    
 people and I get a lot of satisfaction
 from the job."
