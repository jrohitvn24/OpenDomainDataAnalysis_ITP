		<title>15LIMERIGG VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content> In a survey done by Limerigg Primary  
 pupils,we found that the most common  
 number of people occupying one house  
 is 2. The largest number of people in 
 any one house is 10. Most of the      
 houses in the village are owned by    
 Falkirk District Council and most of  
 the tenants have always stayed in     
 Limerigg. We found that shopping was  
 mainly done in the neighbouring towns 
 but the majority did use the mobile   
 vans for bread,fish and butcher meat. 
 Approximately one-third grow their own
 vegetables. The village shop is used  
 occasionally by everyone but the      
 regular customers tend to be          
 pensioners. There is also a mobile    
 library van which visits the village  
 once a week and is used by nearly     
 one-third of the villagers. Finally   
 the survey proved that all but a very 
 few really enjoyed staying in Limerigg</content>
