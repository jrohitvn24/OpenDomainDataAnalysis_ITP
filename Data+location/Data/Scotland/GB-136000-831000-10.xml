		<title>10PLAYING FIELD,CARBOST</title>
		<content> Although our village does not have a  
 proper park,there is a field of about 
 half an acre which we use as a play   
 area.It belongs to the Highland       
 Regional Council,who bought it as a   
 site for the new primary school.      
 The local Community Council raised    
 funds to put some equipment in the    
 field such as swings,chute,parrallel  
 bars,see-saw,roundabout and 2         
 goalposts.                            
 The surface is really too uneven and  
 the grass too long for a proper game  
 of football,but when the new school is
 built in 1987, the field is to be made
 into a proper sports field for use by 
 the community.
