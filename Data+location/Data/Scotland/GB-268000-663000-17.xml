		<content> He helped{Mr. Smith}put on the{tyre.  
    At last they were able to{go in}and
{choose their units}for the{kitchen.   
 This was not so easy as they were to  
 find out. Mrs. Smith preferred{red    
{ones}while Mr. Smith liked the{wooden 
{ones.}They started{to argue}and soon  
 everyone was{staring}at them.They     
 finally decided to{buy}some which were
 entirely{different}to settle the      
 argument.                             
    At last{everything}was packed in   
 the{car}and they{set off for home.    
{Alas!}their{unfortunate shopping      
{expedition}was not over as the{boot of
{the car}flew open on the{motorway}and 
 they had to{draw up}on the{hard       
{shoulder}and{close it.}So ended our   
 shopping day at the{SUPERSTORE.
