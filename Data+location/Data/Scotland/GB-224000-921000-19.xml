 called out is to the{mountain rescue  
 post to help co-ordinate rescues and  
 standby to call in other rescue       
 services. He also watches{sheep       
{dipping,}briefs{special constables}(2 
 resident here) and trains children for
 cycling proficiency.{Poaching}is the  
 worst thing that happens in           
 Inchnadamph , though it is rarer now. 
 The value of{red deer is 85p per      
{pound, the value of salmon is up to Â£3
{per pound.}The worst event this year  
 was a caravan blaze beside the hotel. 
 The contents were worth approximately 
 Â£1,600). The cause was thought to be  
 electrical. In general the policeman  
 only makes patrols of the area.
