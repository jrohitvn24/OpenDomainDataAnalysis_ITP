		<content> Outside our school runs the Barrhead  
 Road which runs from Paisley towards  
 Nitshill,on the outskirts of Glasgow. 
 It is a very busy road because it     
 carries traffic from Paisley to the   
 southern suburbs of Glasgow and links 
 up with other roads to East Kilbride  
 etc. The road is particularly busy in 
 the early morning and in the evening. 
 The speed limit for traffic using the 
 road is 40m.p.h.Several people        
 including pupils from the school have 
 been knocked down on this road.       
 Another problem with the road is the  
 fact that the exit from the Hawkhead  
 private housing estate is onto this   
 road. This leads to more chance of    
 accidents.It has been suggested       
 that traffic lights be put up outside 
 the school but so far nothing has been
 done.The school does discourage pupils
 from crossing the road.               </content>
