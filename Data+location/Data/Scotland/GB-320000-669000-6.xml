		<title>06LONGSTONE BUS DEPOT</title>
		<content>  Longstone bus depot is situated at   
 the end of Murrayburn Road. It has 416
 drivers and 184 buses. Many people    
 have become bus drivers because of the
 good wages and the Social Club in the 
 depot. In the club there are snooker  
 tables, gambling machines, darts and  
 televisions. The bus drivers work 8   
 hours a  day for 5 days a week. There 
 is a canteen in the depot. The drivers
 drive lots of different buses; there  
 are coaches, midi buses and double    
 deckers. It all depends what duty the 
 drivers are on as to what bus they    
 drive. Many buses now have alarms in  
 them so that if the driver is attacked
 he can call for help. This happens    
 occasionally. Buses are serviced and  
 repaired at Longstone but if they are 
 badly damaged they are sent to        
 Shrubhill.Buses have adverts on them: 
 one covering the bus costs Â£9000/year.</content>
