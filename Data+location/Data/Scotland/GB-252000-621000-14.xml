 some depending on the time of the     
 year.                                 
  {Hide and Seek.}One person(the       
 seeker) counts up to a certain number 
 as the other children run away and    
 hide.The object of the game is for the
 person counting to find the other     
 children and return to base to count  
 them out. First person caught is then 
 'het' i.e. the seeker.                
   {Skipping.}Skipping with a rope can 
 be played alone, but is often played  
 by a group.Two people are 'enders'and 
 'ca'(swing) the rope while the others 
 take it in turns to skip. This is done
 to a variety of rhymes and songs.     
  {Tig.}This game involves one child   
 who is 'het' chasing the other        
 children .When he touches one then    
 that child is 'het'i.e.the chaser.
