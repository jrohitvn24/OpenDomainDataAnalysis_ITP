		<title>08Kirkcaldy High School</title>
		<content> The school has 1690 pupils and 121    
 teachers. The average number of pupils
 in a class is 31 although the classes 
 in practical subjects are under 20.   
 The Rector thinks the standard of     
 behaviour is quite good but is        
 gradually getting worse with many     
 cases of bullying. In general the     
 pupils get on well with the Staff. The
 first punishment is the issuing of a  
 yellow sheet on which something has to
 be written. The school is well        
 equipped with many computers and a    
 great deal of the administration is   
 computerised. The school is well      
 situated in the middle of its         
 catchment area although on a busy     
 road. The first and second years are  
 in a separate building half a mile    
 from the Senior building which means  
 that Staff have to travel back and    
 forward.                              </content>
