 turnips.The soil is very light and    
 stony.                                
  The busiest time in the year for the 
 farmers is spring. They have got to   
 plough fields,look after lambs and    
 look out for foxes. The foxes will    
 also be looking for excess food for   
 the newly born cubs which eat         
 ravenously.
