		<title>03Principal Features Of Cupar</title>
		<content> Apart from the obvious features-{     
 churches,schools and parks in Cupar,  
 there is a great number of additional 
 features in and around the town.The   
 Cross (the ancient central trading    
 area in Cupar),the Cattle Mart(held   
 on Tuesdays),the War Memorial,Moat    
 Hill,the Duncan Institute (now Cupar  
 Library),the Corn Exchange,the        
 Industrial Estate,Hawklaw (a M.O.D    
 communications centre) and the River  
 Eden which flows through the southern 
 part of Cupar.                        
  The County Buildings are another     
 feature. Situated in the centre of    
 Cupar, they date from the Georgian    
 period. Preservation in Cupar has not 
 been overlooked, the most recent      
 example being Crossgate House. It is  
 now a supermarket, the facade of the  
 original Georgian building having been
 restored and thereby preserved.       </content>
