		<title>18THE ANTONINE WALL</title>
		<content>     The Antonine Wall was built by the
 Roman 2nd, 6th and 20th legions to    
 keep back the Barbarians in 142 A.D.  
 It stretched from the River Forth     
 in the east to the River Clyde in the 
 west. It was 40 miles long and 3      
 metres high. The wall was made of turf
 topped with wooden planks and the base
 was made from stone. In front of      
 the fort was a ditch 4 metres         
 deep. There were thousands of Romans  
 and slaves working on the wall which  
 took two years to build. Five hundred 
 people lived in the fort at Castle    
 Hill.                                 
      Nowadays we can only see the     
 remains - of the ditch, a bit of the  
 wall, the wall surrounding the fort,  
 stone foundations of the headquarters 
 and bathhouse, the well and the       
 military way which is a tree lined    
 road.                                 </content>
