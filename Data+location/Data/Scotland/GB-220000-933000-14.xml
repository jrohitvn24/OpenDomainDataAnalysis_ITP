		<title>14Kylestrome Estate</title>
		<content>  A large, private, sporting estate,   
 Kylestrome Estate, covers half of our 
 section and beyond. Kylestrome Estate,
 part of the Westminster Estates is one
 of the largest employers in the area, 
 employing eight people full-time, as  
 well as having some seasonal workers. 
  There is an annual cull of forty     
 stags and forty hinds, only the older 
 animals being killed. Because of the  
 environment, no grouse shooting is    
 done. Shelter belts of private        
 forestry give the deer some protection
 from the weather.                     
   A flock of breeding black_faced ewes
 keeps the shepherd busy.              
   Electricity has been generated      
 privately at Kylestrome since 1920,   
 using the Maldie, a fast flowing burn,
 to turn the turbines. Only after a    
 very dry spell is the diesel generator
 in use.                               </content>
