		<content>   Mr.Kinloch whose father was         
 headmaster has lived in Cardross all  
 his life. He was 7 when the Second    
 World War broke out.                  
   He remembers the fire in the old    
 church and being terrified by the     
 bombing. He never saw a banana until  
 he was 14. His mother used to give her
 sons the pulp of an orange and make   
 marmalade with the skin. She used to  
 make her own lemonade. When the war   
 ended people who had bicycles         
 decorated them with crepe paper and   
 paraded through the streets rejoicing.
   He played rounders and king ball as 
 a boy and joined the Golf Club when he
 was 8. On Sunday nights the family    
 played cards or had a musical evening.
 He can remember when the electric     
 trains replaced stream trains.
