		<title>04An Important Scottish Town</title>
		<content> Lanark  was once a very important     
 Scottish town. It has one of the      
 oldest bowling clubs in Scotland and  
 that is the site of Lanark Castle. All
 that marks the site is a plaque at the
 entrance to the bowling club. The     
 plaque wrongly says it was once a     
 Roman fortification. It was, however, 
 first built in the reign of King David
 1 (1124-1153).There are disputes about
 the existence of a castle, but        
 records state that the first Scottish 
 Parliament was held there 1129's. In  
 those days castles were made of wood  
 and they could easily be burnt        
 down. Lanark castle was no exception  
 and was burned down and rebuilt many  
 times. It was allowed to fall into    
 disrepair in the fourteenth century.  
 The street leading to  the site has   
 always been called the Castlegate.
