		<title>12Glenalmond:House master (1)</title>
		<content>{Daily Routine:}The in college house   
 master does not live in the 'house' so
 he arrives at his study between 8     
 o'clock and 8.15 and will then attend 
 to pressing matters until chapel.  He 
 teaches three to five periods and     
 then, between the end of lessons and  
 lunch he runs the house 'bank' and    
 deals with punishments etc.           
   Following lunch he takes games,     
 according to his abilities. Later he  
 returns to his study to work until 7  
 o'clock.  He is on duty from 8 to 11  
 o'clock when he finds time to work and
 see prefects as well as boys.         
{Life style:}Although the in college   
 house master does not live in the     
 house, his home and study are         
 connected by telephone.  In spite of  
 this he has to rely heavily on the    
 prefects and tutors to solve internal 
 problems.                             </content>
