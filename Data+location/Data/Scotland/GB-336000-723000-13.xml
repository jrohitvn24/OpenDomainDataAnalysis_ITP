		<title>13Our Churches</title>
		<content> There are two churches in our area.One
 situated in the Main Street in Gauldry
 is a small building with seating      
 capacity for 100 people.It was        
 originally a weaving shed and         
 purchased by Mrs.Anstruther Duncan for
 her estate workers.They came mainly   
 from the Highlands of Scotland and    
 were members of the United Free Church
 .The other church is in a beautiful   
 woodland setting in Balmerino.This is 
 the original parish church with a     
 capacity of 300 people.In 1938 the    
 United Free Church combined with the  
 Church of Scotland in this parish.The 
 present minister,Mr.Stevenson,conducts
 a service each Sunday at 10:00        
 alternating each week between Gauldry 
 and Balmerino.Mr.Stevenson has a "link
 ed"charge with the Parish of Wormit.He
 also preaches a sermon in Wormit      
 church each Sunday at 11:30.          </content>
