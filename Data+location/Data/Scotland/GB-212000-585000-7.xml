		<title>07Religion in Colmonell</title>
		<content> There is at present only one          
 functioning church in Colmonell. The  
 church is the Church of Scotland      
 church at the west end of the village.
 There is a certain amount of confusion
 over the number of churches which have
 stood on the site of the present      
 church but the most widely held belief
 is :Around 400 AD there was a Saint   
 called Ninian who was the first       
 missionary to come to Scotland. One of
 his followers was a man called Colmon 
 and he built the first church on the  
 site.At that time Colmonell was a     
 Pictish settlement,the remains of     
 which can still be seen behind        
 Boghouse farm.                        
 A number of other churches followed on
 the same site until the present church
 which was built in 1772.
