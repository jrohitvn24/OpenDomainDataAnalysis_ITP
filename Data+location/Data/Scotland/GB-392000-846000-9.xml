 there are 29 geriatric patients in the
 hospital at the moment.There are 27   
 nurses that do day duty and night duty
 using 10 wards;10 rooms are not used  
 There is a  big garden and a summer   
 house,a budgie and a tank of fish.    
  The Doctor's Surgery is held in a    
 room in the Station Hotel.A visiting  
 doctor is there each weekday at midday
 for one hour and there is an afternoon
 surgery of one hour also.If you get a 
 prescription you can either hand it in
 at the Post Office(this is what an    
 elderly person or someone who has no  
 car has to do), or you can drive to   
 the Chemist in the next village 4     
 miles away.                           
   If someone is seriously ill,has an  
 accident or is getting an operation   
 they go to Aberdeen.
