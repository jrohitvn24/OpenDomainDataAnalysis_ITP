		<title>17VARIED RELIGION IN ASSYNT</title>
		<content> There are three main denominations in 
 the Parish of Assynt:- the Church of  
 Scotland, The Free Church, &amp; the Free 
 Presbyterian. The Episcopalian Church 
 has a service each month, conducted by
 a visiting Minister. The              
 Superintendent of the Deep Sea Mission
 holds services every month. The Roman 
 Catholic Priest conducts sevices here 
 at regular intervals. A new Christian 
 Group called The Beacon Fellowship    
 have started holding Bible Study &amp;    
 Worship Meetings in members homes.    
 Attendences are not large but         
 percentage wise compares well with the
 national average. Each week there are 
 six Bible Study Groups here each      
 taking its own special form and       
 suiting the individual. All in all,   
 the Community is well served with many
 &amp; various Religious forms.
