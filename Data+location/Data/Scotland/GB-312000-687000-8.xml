		<title>08GROWTH OF CROSSGATES 2</title>
		<content> There is little employment in         
 Crossgates itself,and there are only a
 few industries in the area.Those are: 
  {Crawfords Potato Merchant,a Plastic 
{Factory,Reids the Builders,}and       
 various garages,employing few people. 
  Crossgates is classed as a{dormitory}
 settlement,meaning that its           
 inhabitants are{Comuters}and travel to
 surrounding towns to work,taking      
 advantage of the excellent road links 
 it has.To the west of the village is  
 the{M90}motorway between{Perth}and{   
{Edinburgh}.{Dunfermline}is only a five
 minute drive away.A new dual          
 carriage way is being built, which by-
 passes Crossgates, taking the         
 exeptionally heavy traffic from its   
 roads.This will provide an excellent  
 road link with{Lochgelly}and{Kircaldy.
