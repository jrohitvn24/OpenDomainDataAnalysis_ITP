		<title>03PAUL'S DAY IN KINNEFF</title>
		<content> I got up at 7a.m. I washed my face and
 hair then had breakfast. I watched    
 Popeye on television then brushed my  
 teeth and got ready for school. I     
 cycled down to call for Barry. We went
 to the shop for our playpiece. At     
 school we did Maths,Language and then 
 spoke about a policeman. At interval  
 we played on the computer. We had pies
 and milkshake for lunch. After lunch  
 we did English and cycling            
 proficiency.                          
    I got home at 3.30p.m. and         
 changed my clothes. I went to the shop
 for potatoes. I then went down to the 
 village to play. I came back and      
 helped my stepbrother with a few logs.
 After tea I went back down to the     
 village to play on my bicycle with my 
 friend.                               
    At 9p.m. I had a shower and went to
 bed.                                  </content>
