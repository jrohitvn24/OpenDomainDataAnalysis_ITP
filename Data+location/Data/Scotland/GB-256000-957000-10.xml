		<title>10Mail &amp; Bus service Tongue</title>
		<content> There are two bus services in the area
 One leaves Tongue in the morning and  
 travels east to Thurso, calling at all
 the small communities off the main    
 road on the way and emptying 14 letter
 boxes on the way. The driver takes    
 parcels and goods to Thurso as well   
 and brings back all sorts of things...
 from laundry to wreaths. As well as   
 all these things he carries passengers
 and school children. The other mail   
 bus goes south to Lairg to meet the   
 train. It carries goods and paaengers 
 and brings back mail and daily papers.
 This  means that the morning paper and
 letters are delivered around tea-time.
 Both buses have to contend with very  
 bad conditions in wintertime. One bus 
 driver was marooned inThurso for a    
 week because of snow, and two years   
 ago one had to be lifted to safety by 
 helicopter                            </content>
