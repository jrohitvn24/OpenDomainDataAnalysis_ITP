		<content> Boys of eighteen study various        
 subjects, but in this case the boy    
 studies Geography, English and Ancient
 History for A-level.  In his spare    
 time he reads novels and plays tennis 
 and basketball.  He also listens to   
 music in his study.  The boy thinks   
 that public school prepares one for   
 later life, but it is a disadvantage  
 to be away from home for such long    
 periods.  He thinks a cafeteria system
 should be established, and finds      
 juniors arrogant.  He also feels that 
 more facilities should be introduced, 
 including more tennis courts.         
 After leaving the school, he looks    
 forward to University and married     
 life. He wishes to relax after        
 A-levels and find a job. On the whole,
 this boy does not enjoy public school 
 life; he finds it trivial and boring.
