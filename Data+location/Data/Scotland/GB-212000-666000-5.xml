     Toward primary school is a typical
 rural school.It was built in 1875 and 
 is 110 yrs.old.                       
     105 yrs.after it was built (in    
 1980) an extension was added.This gave
 the school two new classrooms and the 
 existing classrooms were changed into 
 a lunch hall and a kitchen.           
     Toward school has two teachers and
 29 pupils.The headteacher takes       
 classes 4,5,6 and 7 the other teacher 
 takes classes 1,2 and 3.              
     Toward school has superb          
 facilities and is a great school      
 (according to me)
