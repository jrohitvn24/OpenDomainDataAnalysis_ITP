		<title>06MILTONDUFF DISTILLERY</title>
		<content> The distillery is situated 5 km West  
 of Elgin,Moray in the plain of        
 Pluscarden,known as the Garden of     
 Scotland and is famed for the growth  
 of fine barley.                       
 The whole process of distilling takes 
 place at Miltonduff Glenlivet.The     
 malted barley is stored in the hoppers
 which can hold two lorry loads each of
 40 tonnes.The malted barley is crushed
 in the grinding mills to produce the  
 grist which is the malt after it has  
 been ground.The grist is mixed in the 
 mash tun with hot water.The liquids   
 called worts from the mash tun are    
 drained into the underback and then   
 pumped to fermenters.In the fermenters
 yeast is added,ordinary white and     
 brown which is the yeast left from    
 beer making.After fermentation the    
 liquid is called wash.
