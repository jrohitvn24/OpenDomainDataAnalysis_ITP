		<content> Our block is entirely farmland and    
 lies to the west, just outside the    
 town boundary of Cupar. The landscape 
 consists of rounded hills, gentle     
 slopes and fertile valleys or straths.
 Though field cropping is the main land
 cover the area is well endowed with   
 woodland patches, hedgerows and areas 
 of permanent meadow. This attractive  
 landscape offers a wide range of      
 habitats for a great variety of plant 
 and animal life. Farming dominates the
 local economy though many farm        
 cottages are now occupied by people   
 who commute to work in neighbouring   
 towns. Buildings vary from ruined     
 castles to well preserved 19th century
 farm steadings to modern farm         
 structures. Rural cottages  are all in
 good repair, fully occupied with      
 families who rely on Cupar as a main  
 base for schooling and shopping.      </content>
