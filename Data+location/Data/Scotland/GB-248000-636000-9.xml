		<title>09TRANSPORT-GALSTON</title>
		<content> Galston has always been closely       
 associated with transport links. The  
 town grew up around a ford and later a
 bridging point.A meeting place in the 
 centre of town is called the four ways
 and suggests the town's function as a 
 route centre.This success as a meeting
 place brought a greater volume of     
 traffic as the strategic A71 route    
 linking  North Arshire with the M74 to
 England and the South.This increased  
 volume of heavy  traffic caused great 
 congestion.After great debate a       
 by-pass was built to the North of the 
 town sterilizing the town centre of   
 noise and air pollution:contrary to   
 expectation commercial businesses have
 not suffered.As the salmon returned to
 the purified Irvine so the motorist   
 has returned to the centre of the     
 town.The railway linking Kilmarnock to
 Strathavan was closed in the 60's     </content>
