		<content> We interviewed Mrs G                  
 and Mrs H from                        
 the Pentland Art Club. The club meets 
 on Thursdays and lasts for three      
 hours, starting at 7.00pm. It costs   
 Â£4.00 per year for adults and Â£2.50   
 for children and OAP's. There are 85  
 people in the art club and there is a 
 commitee of eight people running the  
 club. At the end of August they have  
 an annual exhibition. They sometimes  
 sell some of their work. The syllabus 
 is varied and they have talks and     
 demonstrations or do practical work.  
 They sometimes go outside or to the   
 museum to paint or draw. The club also
 visits art galleries. Apart from      
 drawing and painting the club         
 practises silver work, tapestry,      
 embroidery and printing. This is the  
 eighteenth year of the Pentland Art   
 Club's existence.                     </content>
