		<content> Thomas Carlyle and Jane Welsh         
                                       
 Jane Welsh, niece of the Rev. Walter  
 Welsh, minister of the Parish of      
 Auchtertool, fell in love with the    
 rising historian and essayist Thomas  
 Carlyle. For five years they did much 
 of their courting at the manse in     
 Auchtertool (Old Schoolhouse). In 1826
 they married and from then until her  
 death in 1866, Jane and her husband   
 returned every summer to holiday in   
 Auchtertool. From letters written by  
 Mrs Carlyle it would seem in spite of 
 their strong mutual affection, their  
 marriage was full of quarrels and     
 misunderstandings. Often Mrs Carlyle  
 turned up at her Uncles manse in need 
 of comfort and rest. It must have been
 very difficult to live with such a    
 calvanistic, imperious man.
