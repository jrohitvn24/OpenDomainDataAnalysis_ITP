 Mr Ross uses organic cultural methods 
 and we were interested to see that he 
 had a pond in the garden which was    
 full of tadpoles. He breeds frogs to  
 eat the insects that otherwise would  
 eat the plants because he will not use
 pesticides.                           
   People come from quite a distance to
 look at and buy plants. Mr Ross has   
 a very brisk business sending plants  
 to many parts of the country.
