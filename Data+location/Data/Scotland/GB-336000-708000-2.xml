 The only school in the area is a      
 Primary School which has a roll of 31 
 children.They begin school at about   
 five years old and spend seven years  
 in Primary before transferring to     
 Secondary Education. The roll has     
 fallen sharply in the last 10 years.  
 The school used to have three teachers
 but now has only two - the headteacher
 and an assistant. The schoolhouse is  
 no longer lived in but is used as     
 staffroom and bookstore. Five of the  
 children are transported to and from  
 school by taxi as there is no bus     
 service on their roads and all of them
 live more than two miles from school. 
 All the others walk or cycle to school
 or come by private car.
