      The Wemyss Coal Company built    
 houses in various styles.             
      The main workforce lived in      
 back-to-back,two-storeyed houses with 
 outside stairs to the houses above.   
 These houses,which fell derelict in   
 the seventies and which are now being 
 renovated by a private development    
 company with Government aid,are in a  
 triangular block with its base in     
 Forth Street and its apex in Don      
 Street.Single-storey terraced blocks  
 were built in Barncraig Street,Bow    
 Street, Wall Street and Den Street.   
 Semi-detached villas were provided for
 officials in Kenmore Terrace and      
 Wellesley Crescent.                   
     In the seventies,modern bungalows 
 were built by Kirkcaldy District      
 Council on the West side of Ward      
 Street.                               </content>
