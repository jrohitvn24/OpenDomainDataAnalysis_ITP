		<title>03SHALE BINGS</title>
		<content>   Our Heritage from the Scottish Oil  
 Industry is a landscape filled with   
 man-made mountains. These{Bings}(from 
 the Gaelic 'beinn'-a mountain) are    
 shale waste, pink, silent reminders of
 a once booming industry. The waste    
 material is now put to many uses,     
 mainly as foundation for roads such as
 the M8 and the Livingston dual        
 carriageway. The shale refuse is also 
 used in land reclamation schemes      
 notably the one operated by B.P.'s oil
 refinery at Grangemouth. The refuse is
 also used for the making of bricks.   
 Many bings have been reduced but      
 enough still remain to remind us of   
 Paraffin Young's magnificent          
 achievements in the pioneering era of 
 the oil business.
