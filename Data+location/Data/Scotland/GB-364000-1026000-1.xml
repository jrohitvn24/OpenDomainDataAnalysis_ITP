		<content> This area of the island includes      
 Whitehall Village.  In the village    
 there are three shops, one bank, one  
 pub, and a post office.  The shops    
 stock food, sweets, icecream, and     
 bread.  At Christmas they take in toys
 and other nice things for Christmas.  
 The school in the centre of the island
 teaches about sixty pupils and has    
 four teachers with seven visiting     
 teachers. When you are fourteen years 
 old you have the chance to go to a    
 shcool on the mainland where more     
 education is given.  The rest of the  
 area consists mainly of farmland.  The
 bank (The Bank of Scotland) is only   
 open on a Thursday when a cashier     
 comes out from the mainland.  Another 
 feature of the village area is the    
 Weavers shop, he has a hand weave loom
 and specialises in tweeds.  This shop 
 is also an outlet for local knitters. </content>
