 There is one church in this area, the 
 Church of Scotland situated in the    
 village of Lunan. The last resident   
 minister retired in 1952 after which  
 the church was joined with that of    
 Inverkeilor, where the present        
 minister lives. In 1983 these two     
 churches were linked with Friockheime 
 and Kinnel Church since when only     
 monthly services have been held at    
 Lunan. These services are held at     
 10a.m., the last Sunday of each       
 month.The attendances are fair, with a
 hard core of about ten regular        
 worshippers.                          
 SUNDAY SCHOOL. There is no Sunday     
 School at Lunan, the nearest is held  
 in Inverkeilor.
