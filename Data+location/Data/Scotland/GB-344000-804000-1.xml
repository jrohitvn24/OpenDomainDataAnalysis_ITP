		<title>01       AREA OF SQUARE</title>
		<content>   This block lies in an area of one of
 the most beautiful parts of Britain.  
 It forms part of the {'Howe of Cromar'
 (Valley of Cromar) and lies some 52   
 kilometres west of Aberdeen.          
   The block extends from the western  
 extremity of the village of Tarland   
 westwars towards the hamlet of Logie  
 Coldstone and Northwards to the       
 scattered hamlet of Migvie.           
   The area is very rural and consists 
 almost entirely of arable farmland.   
 There is also a little woodland cover 
 both of pine and deciduos trees.Within
 the area there are three country      
 houses with surrounding estates.The   
 farms are almost entirely contained   
 within the estate of the {MacRobert   
{Trust}which at the time of writing is 
 offering its farms for sale and/or    
 tenancy.
