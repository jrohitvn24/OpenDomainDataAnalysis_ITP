		<title>13Finavon Castle</title>
		<content> Finavon Castle,now a picturesque ruin,
 stands on the banks of the Lemno,close
 by the junction of the Lemno and the  
 River South Esk.The castle lies East  
 of the A94 about ten kilometres North 
 of Forfar.You can visit this          
 interesting ruin by seeking permission
 from the local estate.All that is     
 visible of the castle from the road is
 the tall shattered tower built in     
 1593.The original castle was built by 
 the Linsays in the Fourteenth         
 Century.The castle collapsed in 1712  
 probably because the walls were       
 undermined by the Lemno.Since then it 
 has remained a ruin.In 1952 Doctor    
 Simpson,a reknowned                   
 archaeologist,supervised a major      
 excavation of the ruins and many      
 interesting items of pottery,glassware
 and two sets of draughts-boards were  
 recovered.                            </content>
