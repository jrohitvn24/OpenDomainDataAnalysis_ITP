		<content>  Cloddach Quarry lies next to the     
 River Lossie, three kilometres from   
 Elgin. The first materials went       
 through the plant in 1971. It makes   
 ready mixed concrete, concrete        
 building blocks and road materials.   
  Lorries are weighed on the weigh     
 bridge to check the amount of sand    
 sold in a year.                       
  The employees come from Mosstodloch, 
 Lossiemouth, Fochabers and Elgin.     
 Cloddach Quarry produces 15,000       
 building blocks a day at 28p each.    
  There are two machines.The first     
 machine takes cement and puts it into 
 a hopper on another machine.This      
 machine vibrates cement into blocks.  
  They started digging at the south end
 of the deposit. They have found a     
 collection of practice bombs left from
 the time it was Bogs of Mayne         
 airfield.                             </content>
