		<title>14The Riverside Area</title>
		<content>   Above the Everholm is{North Street} 
 where many of the sandstone cottages  
 have been modernised. They have a     
 lovely view over the river.           
   There is a{caravan site}which       
 belongs to the District Council. It is
 used a lot by tourists in the summer  
 but in the winter it closes.          
   Next to the caravan site on the hill
 above the river is the{Scout Hut}which
 is used by the various troops of Boy  
 Scouts and Cubs.                      
   This area is one of the nicest parts
 of Annan and there are many lovely    
 walks to be had by the river between  
 Annan and the next village of         
 Brydekirk.
