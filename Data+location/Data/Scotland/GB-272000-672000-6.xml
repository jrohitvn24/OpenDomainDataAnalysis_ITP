		<title>06CUMBERNAULD-A SAFE TOWN</title>
		<content>                                       
 Because Cumbernauld is a new town and 
 also very modern,roads and pathways   
 are very well planned.To make the town
 as safe as possible the{pathways and  
{roads are separated}except in the     
 older areas.Where I live in Westfield 
 there are no paths alongside roads but
 sometimes we do have to cross the     
 smaller roads.This means that where I 
 live{is very safe for pedestrians}and 
 accidents hardly ever happen.Close by 
 in Condorrat village there are paths  
 alongside the road and we have to be  
 careful when walking there.The        
 shortest routes around Cumbernauld are
 by road but the safe path takes much  
 longer.Sometimes people say           
 Cumbernauld was{designed for cars not 
{people.}
