		<title>11   A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>  My radio alarm wakes me to North     
 Sound.I get up at 7:30am,get dressed  
 and go for my breakfast.I watch TV for
 a while then get my school bag and my 
 play piece ready.I leave for school at
 8:30 and kiss mum.Dad works one week  
 offshore for Britoil on Beatrice Alpha
 in the North Sea then he's home for a 
 week.When he's at home he goes down to
 the Fire Station to check and clean   
 things.He is one of 10 part-time fire 
 men.There is one fire engine,a pump   
 water tender,callsign Echo721.His most
 unusual call out has been to take a   
 calf out of a well.On my way to school
 I call for Chris and we walk up to    
 school and play a game of football    
 before the bell rings. After school I 
 get 20p for sweets and change into my 
 play clothes.I go in for my supper at 
 6:oopm then mum helps me with my home 
 work.I watch TV and go to bed at 9:00 </content>
