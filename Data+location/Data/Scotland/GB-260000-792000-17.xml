		<title>17Travel in Laggan</title>
		<content> Our nearest airport is 60 miles away  
 at Dalcross Inverness.Our nearest     
 working station is Kingussie 12 miles 
 away although a few trains do still   
 stop at Newtonmore.To reach these a   
 car or bus is necessary and here the  
 Laggan dweller has a problem.Without a
 car driver our only method of leaving 
 Laggan is by school bus (not on       
 Saturdays) or since 1975 a post       
 bus (which stopped this year). The    
 school bus only operates as far as    
 Kingussie and only during term        
 time.The post bus is dependant on     
 train arrivals bringing mail and is   
 therefore late in winter.When the     
 traveller manages to leave Laggan the 
 infrequency of trains both North &amp;    
 South can be an added problem.Thus    
 having our own shop and village hall  
 and self sufficient skills are very   
 important.                            </content>
