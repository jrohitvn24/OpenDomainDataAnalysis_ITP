		<content> Myth surrounds the stone circles.     
 It is said that the "Great Ting"- or  
 general parliament of Shetland met at 
 one of the circles in Unst before     
 being removed to Tingwall.Anyone found
 "guilty" by the Foude(judge) and      
 udallers had the right of appeal to   
 the voice of the people. The accused  
 then had to run to the most westerly  
 circle of stones. If he reached the   
 circle in safety ,his life was        
 preserved,but if popular opinion was  
 against him,he was pursued and anyone 
 might put him to death before         
 reaching the sanctuary. Another tale  
 suggests that witches were burned     
 alive at the Rounds of Tivla. These   
 witches were usually elderly spinsters
 blamed for inexplicable tragedies-such
 as still-born calves or the sudden    
 death of an animal.
