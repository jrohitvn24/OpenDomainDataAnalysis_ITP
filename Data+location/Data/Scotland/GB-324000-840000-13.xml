		<title>13A Flood in Aberlour.</title>
		<content> About two years ago, there was a flood
 in Aberlour.                          
 It rained so heavily that the drains  
 couldn't cope and the streets were    
 filled with water.                    
 Gardens were washed away, plants were 
 lost and there was mud everywhere.    
 Thousands of pounds worth of damage   
 was done to farms as seed which had   
 just been planted and fertiliser was  
 washed away. Later it sprouted about  
 half a mile away beside the old       
 railway line.                         
 The water running down the fields cut 
 fizzures in the ground so we could see
 the different layers of soil and      
 gravel right down to the boulders.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
