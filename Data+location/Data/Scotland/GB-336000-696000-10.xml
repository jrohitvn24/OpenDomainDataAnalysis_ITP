		<content>       The pupils in Primary 7 in      
 Denbeath Primary School started the   
 "Domesday Project" in April 1985.     
      The whole class helped to compile
 the statistics and write the material.
 Going on trips round the area and     
 writing to people and interviewing    
 them was good fun.                    
      Three pupils -Elaine Rhinds,Lynn 
 Millar and Wendy Garty - were asked to
 be editors and they were helped by    
 their class teacher Mrs. Deas and     
 their headmaster Mr.Taylor.
