		<content> The area covered by this survey is a  
 rural one.   It is situated on the    
 tidal Solway Firth, and the land is   
 flat and fertile.   The farms are on  
 the whole fairly prosperous, producing
 grass crops, beef and dairy cattle,   
 and some sheep.                       
 The sparse population centres on the  
 villages of Powfoot and Cummertrees.  
 Most people are employed either in    
 agriculture, or work in the nearby    
 towns of Annan or Dumfries.   There is
 a certain amount of seasonal          
 employment in the tourist industry,   
 which revolves round the golf course  
 at Powfoot.                           
 The normal village social activities  
 are still to be found, although due to
 the declining rural population, and   
 the proximity to Annan, fresh         
 amenities have not developed.
