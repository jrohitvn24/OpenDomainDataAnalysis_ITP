		<content> THE CRIME RATE IN THESE 4 AREAS IS    
 INCREASING EVERY DAY.IT IS GETTING TO 
 THE STAGE WHERE THE CRIMINALS DO NOT  
 EVEN WAIT TILL DARK TO COMMIT THEIR   
 CRIMES.IF THE CRIMINALS DO GET CAUGHT 
 THEY EITHER GET A LIGHT FINE OR A     
 SHORT JAIL SENTENCE.SO WHEN THEY GET  
 OUT THEY JUST START AGAIN. MOST PEOPLE
 THINK "OH IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN TO     
 ME".SO DO NOT BOTHER COMPLAINING TO   
 THE POLICE FORCE.                     
 DRUMCHAPEL IS THE AREA WHERE CRIME IS 
 MORE SERIOUS WHEREAS IN BEARSDEN THE  
 CRIME RATE IS NOT AS HIGH.            
                                       
 MORE POLICEMEN ARE NOW "ON THE BEAT"  
 BUT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH TO COMBAT    
 THE RISING TIDE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. 
                                       
 ONE AREA OF DRUMCHAPEL IS A VIRTUAL   
 "NO-GO" AREA FOR THE POLICE.
