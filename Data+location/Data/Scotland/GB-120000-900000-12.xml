		<title>12Crops grown in Rhenigidale</title>
		<content>{Potatoes}In Rhenigidale we grow nearly
 all the potatoes that we need         
 throughout the year. Bags of seed     
 potatoes are bought and these are     
 planted in lazy beds and covered with 
 soil, manure and fertiliser. Hopefully
 around Autumn there will be a good    
 crop of potatoes.{Lazy beds}are long, 
 flat, rectangular, raised mounds of   
 earth made years ago by digging a     
 ditch all round and piling the earth  
 in the middle. All the vegetables and 
 corn are sown in these.               
{Hay}Some of the grass is spread with  
 fertiliser in the Spring and by Autumn
 there is a good crop of grass. This is
 cut by scythe and dried on{hay racks.}
 These are long tent shaped structures 
 made out of fencing posts and wire.   
 The grass is hung on each strand of   
 the wire, covered with a net and left 
 to dry.                               </content>
