		<content> There is only one doctor for the whole
 area.The doctor's surgery is part of  
 his house,which belongs to{Highland   
{Health Board},so when he retires he   
 will have to get another house and the
 new doctor will get that one.At the   
 moment there is only a relief nurse   
 because the full time nurse retired;  
 she got the MBE for exceptional work. 
 We hope to get a new nurse.The nearest
 big hospital is 80 miles away.Surgery 
 hours are Mond.Wed.Frid.10am:Tues.6pm 
 in Torridon;Tues10am in Kinlochewe in 
 the Nurse's house there.The doctors &amp; 
 nurses have to cover the villages of  
 Shieldaig,Kinlochewe,Torridon,Alligin,
 Diabaig &amp; Achnasheen;making house     
 calls to all those places.As there is 
 no chemist,doctor prescribes and sells
 medicines.On Thurs.doctor's day off, a
 Lochcarron doctor is on call.Doctor   
 attends mountain rescue&amp;road accidents</content>
