		<content>{TRANSPORT}                            
 Most people thought that the public   
 transport was quite good and that the 
 buses were nearly always on time,and  
 the fares cheap.The people interviewed
 said they used the bus service        
 regularly.                            
{AMENITIES                             
 Local people seemed to enjoy living in
 Peterculter,but they think a greater  
 variety of shops is needed. There are 
 two churches in the area and the      
 people we asked said they were needed 
 for different reasons.There is a      
 library and also a community centre.  
{CHILDREN                              
 The children we spoke to liked the    
 area but thought there should be more 
 activities for them.They all liked the
 school and the teachers because they  
 said they didn't get much work!  CONT.
