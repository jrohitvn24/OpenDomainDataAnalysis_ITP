		<title>20CHRISTMAS AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{Christmas}is a time for children and  
 at{Easterfield Primary School}this is 
 a very busy time.                     
 A lot of effort is put in organising  
 the{children's party.}Pre school      
 children are invited as well as all   
 parents who wish to attend. A{'Santa  
{Claus'}is booked and presents bought  
 for all children. On the day itself   
 the children play such games as       
{'Farmer's in his Den', 'Pass the      
{Parcel'}and{'Musical Arms'.}For tea   
 there are sausage rolls, biscuits,    
 jelly and ice cream. After, Santa     
 arrives and distributes the presents. 
 At the end of the afternoon each child
 receives a balloon and apple or       
 orange. An other important aspect of  
 this time of year is the school       
{Nativity Play}which attracts many     
 parents and shows children the        
 real meaning of Christmas.            </content>
