		<content> BOGSIDE MINE.It was sunk in the late  
 1950's. At that time it was producing 
 fifteen thousand tons of coal each    
 week. At this time nine hundred men   
 were employed. Unfortunately on       
 January, 27th, 1984 the mine was      
 flooded. After this seven hundred men 
 were transferred to many other        
 mines.On March, 12th, 1984 a nation   
 wide strike took place by mine        
 workers. The one hundred and fifty men
 left at Bogside went on strike. The   
 strike lasted over a year. Now only   
 a skeleton staff is left, about forty 
 three men. They are mainly occupied   
 with maintenance and salvage. No one  
 at the moment, however, has told the  
 staff to completely brick up the mine.
 A change in political attitude could  
 perhaps change the future of the mine 
 although  it would need tremendous    
 capital investment.                   </content>
