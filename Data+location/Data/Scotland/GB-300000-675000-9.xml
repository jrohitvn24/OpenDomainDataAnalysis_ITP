 The{Regent Centre}got its name from   
 the {Regent Murray}who was shot at    
{Linlithgow Cross}on the 20th January  
 1570.During the 2nd World War this    
 area was a factory owned by ICI and   
 was used for the making of ammunition 
     The{Regent Centre}of today is a   
 modern shopping complex and was built 
 1981-1983.The first shop opened was   
 Wm. Lows in June 1983.Other shops     
 followed,{R.S.McColls, City Bakeries, 
{Freezways}and the newest-{Haddows Off 
{Sales. }                              
     We found that before the Centre   
 was built most people travelled to    
 shop. Now that it is built it saves   
 money for travelling.{Wm Lows}is the  
 most popular place for shopping in    
 Linlithgow.We also found that older   
 people tended to use the {Regent      
{Centre}as it was more convenient.     </content>
