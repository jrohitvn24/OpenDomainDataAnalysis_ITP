		<title>09Homes in Norham</title>
		<content> Houses in Norham are as varied as     
 their occupants! Sandstone houses, a  
 hundred years old, rub shoulders with 
 their more modern brick-built,        
 pebble-dashed neighbours. But the old 
 houses have been modernised, and about
 half the houses in the village have   
 some form of central-heating. Most    
 have at least one open fire for       
 burning solid fuel. The village has no
 mains gas supply.                     
    An average home is a semi-detached 
 or terraced bungalow or two-storeyed  
 house, with a garden, two or three    
 bedrooms, bathroom with W.C., kitchen 
 and main living room.                 
    Owing to the mass production of    
 furniture, the village home contains  
 much the same as its urban            
 counterpart.
