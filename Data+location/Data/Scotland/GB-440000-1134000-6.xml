 When I get up on Saturday morning I   
 wash my face, brush my teeth and put  
 on my clothes. After breakfast we go  
 shopping for our week's supply of     
 food. When we come home I watch       
 football on televison. If it's a good 
 day I will go out to play on my bike. 
 When it's tea-time I put my bike away 
 and get my tea. After tea I watch     
 television for a while, then I go to  
 bed at about ten o'clock. When I get  
 up on Sunday I have my breakfast and  
 go to Sunday School. We learn about   
 Jesus and other people in the Bible.  
 After dinner, we sometimes take a trip
 to Walls in our car and caravan. After
 tea we go to church. When I come home 
 I do my reading. Before I go to bed at
 about nine o'clock, I brush my teeth  
 and wash my hands and face.
