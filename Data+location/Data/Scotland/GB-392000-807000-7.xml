		<content> ABERDEEN: ST. MACHAR'S CATHEDRAL.     
                                       
 Near Seaton Park near Old Aberdeen    
 stands an old building called         
 St.Machars Cathedral. Due to old age  
 the cathedral crumbled but it was     
 restored and is still  used as a      
 church today.                         
                                       
 Before going into the cathedral you   
 pass through a graveyard where all    
 types of people are buried. Through a 
 door you will find the graves of      
 Bishops of Aberdeen.                  
                                       
 Inside the cathedral you will see the 
 Coat-of-Arms  on  the roof. There are 
 statues of important religious        
 figures.                              
 Today tthe Cathedral is used for      
 marrriages and the Sunday service is  
 still held every week.                </content>
