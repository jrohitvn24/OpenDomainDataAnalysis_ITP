		<content>        This grid area is in Fife,     
 Scotland. In this grid area there is  
 one town, Lochgelly, covering         
 approximately 1 square kilometer and  
 the small village of Glencraig.       
                                       
        The surrounding countryside is 
 mainly farmland with 1 square         
 kilometer of inland water, mainly Loch
 Ore and 2 small streams,R.Ore and     
 Lochfitty Burn.                       
                                       
        There is also an area known as 
 Lochore Meadows Country Park, which   
 has been created from abandoned mine  
 workings.                             
                                       
        The rest of the grid area is   
 open countryside with 7 farms.
