		<content> The Holm of Huip is an island. It is a
 grazing land for many sheep, there are
 approximately seventy ewes. During the
 lambing season lambs are often        
 attacked by Black Back Gulls, these   
 are carnivourous sea birds who attack 
 and often kill defenceless young      
 lambs. The Holm is a place where you  
 often sea seals, and birds nest there 
 as it is so peaceful. Farmers go      
 across twice a year to shear and dip  
 the sheep. The air field is quite a   
 big field with a small bit of concrete
 for the plane to land on. A small hut 
 is also provided to shelter in. The   
 field that the plane lands in has a   
 small mound that is an ancient buriel 
 ground. This mound is called the Green
 Hill. Little Linga is a seal sanctuary
 owned by the Fern Trust, this island  
 also has sheep grazing on it.
