		<content> The land around Rhynie is all farming 
 ground so there is many farms.   most 
 are crofts but there are a few bigger 
 farms.  Most cattle are sold for beef 
 but some are sold for stock.   The two
 main breeds of cattle are Hereford and
 Charlois.   A lot of sheep stay up in 
 the hills so they have to be hardy.   
 The breeds are Blackface and Texel.   
 Pigs aren't very common in this area. 
 Infact only two farms have pigs.   The
 crops are mainly winter and spring    
 barley, silage, hay, and vegetables.  
 One farm has started growing Oil Seed 
 Rape.
