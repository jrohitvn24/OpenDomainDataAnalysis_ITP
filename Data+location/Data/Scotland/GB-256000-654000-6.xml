		<title>06TRANSPORT IN THE BUSBY AREA</title>
		<content>  The main method of transport is by   
{private car}with 75% of households    
 owning at least one car(compared with 
 45% in Scotland).During the peak hour 
 (8-9am) 1,788 cars used the main      
 commuter roads to and from Glasgow.As 
 the roads are over-used there are     
 plans to build a by-pass to the east. 
  The two forms of{public transport}are
 bus and rail.The bus services are run 
 by the Regional Council and by a      
 subsidised company.This means in Busby
 there is a frequent bus service but   
 only hourly to Waterfoot.Thorntonhall 
 has no bus service.                   
  Busby and Thortonhall have railway   
 stations on the diesel line to        
 Glasgow.There is a half hourly service
 with more trains at peak times.There  
 are plans to electrify this old line  
 which is a single track south of      
 Busby.                                </content>
