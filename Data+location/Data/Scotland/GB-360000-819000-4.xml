		<content> The 115 members of Keig, the          
 smallest of the three churches, are to
 be congratulated on being self        
 supporting, admirable in a country    
 parish with one shop and a primary    
 school with less than 20 pupils.      
 The Church with its valuable pipe     
 organ is much admired by visitors.    
 Mrs. Agnes Ledingham has been a       
 faithful organist for over 40 years   
 and Church and Hall are well cared for
 by the Beadle,Mr Fred Laird.          
 Women now share in the work of the    
 Kirk Session and Board and there is a 
 small but active Woman's Guild.       
 Church services, once every two weeks,
 are as well supported as in any other 
 country parish by the faithfull       
 members. On 13 October 1985 a         
 special service was held to celebrate 
 the 150th. anniversary of Keig Church.
