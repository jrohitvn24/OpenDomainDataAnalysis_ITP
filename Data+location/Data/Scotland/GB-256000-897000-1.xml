		<title>01The Lower Shin Valley</title>
		<content> The River Shin flows south through a  
 steep sided gorge. The river is famous
 for salmon, which may be seen leaping 
 up the falls on their way to their    
 spawning grounds. Much of the water   
 which formerly flowed down the river  
 was diverted by tunnel to the Power   
 Station at Inveran forming part of a  
 Hydroelectricity scheme completed in  
 1954. The valley is flanked by        
 moorland to the east and forestry     
 plantations to the west. Two roads    
 follow the River Shin also the railway
 line, leading to Lairg. A road to the 
 west coast follows the Oykel Valley. A
 hotel on the moor commands magnificent
 views of both valleys. The population 
 of the area is very low, there being  
 only a few dwellings near the Power   
 Station and a few scattered crafts and
 converted cottages.
