		<title>12THE HILL LAND ON EDAY</title>
		<content>                                       
    Most hill land on Eday, which is   
 now grassland, started off as wild    
 heather. To reclaim this land for     
 farming, first you have to pace out   
 your piece of land, then you burn off 
 the heather.                          
    When burning heather you must keep 
 a constant watch on the flames because
 the wind could spread the flame and   
 the fire could go out of control.     
    When the fire is put out it is time
 to plough. You start by going down and
 up the hill. When it is ploughed it   
 must be seeded. After the seeding     
 comes harrowing. Then last of all you 
 have to roll the ground and wait for  
 the grass to grow.                    
    Many farmers on the West Side of   
 Eday have just taken out hill in this 
 way.                                  
                                       </content>
