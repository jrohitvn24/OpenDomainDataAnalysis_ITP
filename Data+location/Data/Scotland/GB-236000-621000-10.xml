		<title>10  THE CREAM OF THE CROP</title>
		<content>  Among Scotland's chief exports are   
 those products related to milk such as
 cream,tinned Scots evaporated milk and
 Scottish cheddar cheese, which are in 
 demand in countries as far away as    
 North and Central Africa, Turkey and  
 Iran.                                 
  Much of the credit for the success of
 these products is due to the skill and
 industry of the people employed at the
{Hannah Research Institute,}which is a 
 government run organisation near Ayr. 
  Not content to work strictly with    
 dairy products the researchers have   
 recently concocted another brew more  
 typical of Scottish exports_a liqueur,
 called Heather Cream, which is also   
 becoming one of Scotland's top selling
 exports.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
