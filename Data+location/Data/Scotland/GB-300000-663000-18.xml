		<title>18SCHOOL LIFE</title>
		<content> Life in school today is alright.We get
 to mix with other children and have   
 our own classroom in school,with our  
 teacher who tells us what to do.Our   
 school time is from 9a.m.until        
 3.15p.m.We get a break at 10.30 for 15
 minutes to play and a break for lunch 
 from 12.15 to 1.15.We have raised a   
 lot of money these past few years for 
 charity by having jumble sales,       
 sponsored things etc.Recently we      
 worked for the Ethiopia Appeal.       
 Some of the things we study are       
 Arithmetic, English,Project work,     
 Poetry, Stories and computer work.We  
 also have some activities like craft, 
 television,gym, art and music.        
 We work in groups in the class and    
 there are 33 pupils in my class,13    
 boys and 20 girls.
