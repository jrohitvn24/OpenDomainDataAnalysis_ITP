		<content> There are many parks but some parts   
 of them are unusable due to{vandalism.
 When new facilities like swings and   
 chutes, are installed in playgrounds, 
 they are misused by a minority of     
 people spoiling them for others.      
 We are well supplied for indoor and   
 outdoor sports like squash and        
 basketball, football and golf, but we 
 wish there was a swimming pool open to
 the public.                           
 We have a riding stable and horses at 
{Silverknowes}and a harbour at{Granton 
 for{sailing}but the cost is high and  
 most people cannot afford to use these
 facilities as in some parts of the    
 area there is{unemployment.}          
 One place free for everybody is the   
 esplanade. Local people, and visitors 
 from the caravan park beside the golf 
 course, enjoy walking there. The air  
 is clear and the view is brilliant.   </content>
