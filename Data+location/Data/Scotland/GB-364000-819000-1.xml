		<title>01Bennachie and Tilliefoure.</title>
		<content> This area lies to the south of        
 Bennachie, includes a stretch of the  
 river Don and Milstone Hill. It is    
 approximately 20miles to the NE of    
 Aberdeen between Monymusk and Keig.   
  An area of much natural beauty with  
 a picturesque drive beside the        
 river through the Lords Throat to     
 Keig,there are points along the river 
 for fishing and,in the shallower      
 reaches, bathing.                     
 Much of the area is forest owned by   
 the Forestry Commission who have      
 provided a car park and Information   
 centre with access to a number of     
 walks.                                
 There are crofts, farms and           
 traditional dwellings along the       
 roadside sheltered by the hills from  
 the north winds. The lowland is either
 pasture or cultivated for silage to   
 feed the animals in winter.           </content>
