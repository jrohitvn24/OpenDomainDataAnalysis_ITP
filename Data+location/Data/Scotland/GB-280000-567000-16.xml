		<content> George Smith has been employed by Sir 
 Michael Herries of Spottes Hall for   
 the past 15 years as estate handyman. 
 This includes game keeping. George was
 born on the estate of Spottes 59 years
 ago. Sir Michael's estate is about    
 1,200 acres. George rears about 200   
 pheasants on the estate. They now buy 
 them in at about 6 weeks old. The main
 vermin is foxes and carrion crows.    
 They feed the pheasants on barley and 
 wheat. The mill at Glen of Spottes    
 ceased to work about 45 years ago.    
 There used to be a house there. The   
 joiner's shop was above the mill      
 (with the remains still there).       
 Nowadays people often walk their dogs,
 go for a swim below the waterfall or  
 fish there. There is a footbridge     
 halfway down the glen. On the map     
 there is reference to a chapel but    
 only a few stones are left.           </content>
