		<title>12Education in Gourdon</title>
		<content> In the mid 19th century a school was  
 opened in Queen Street at which       
 attendance was voluntary. It was      
 funded partly by an endowment and by  
 the pupils paying fees of 1d. per day.
 By 1868 a large and successful day    
 school had started in the{Mission     
{Hall.}More than 200 children attended 
 and one sole female teacher taught    
 over 100 during the morning and the   
 same again in the afternoon. Two years
 after the Education Act of 1873 the   
 first purpose built school was built  
 and served the village until it was   
{destroyed by fire in 1955.}A new 4    
 teacher school was built on the same  
 site although in the 1980's the school
 roll fell to less than 40 so that the 
 school became a{2 teacher unit,}one of
 the spare classrooms being then used  
 by the Village Playgroup and Mother   
 and Toddlers Group.                   </content>
