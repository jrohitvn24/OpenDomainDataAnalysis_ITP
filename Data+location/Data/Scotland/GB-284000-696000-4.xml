		<title>04STATISTICAL SURVEY-MENSTRIE</title>
		<content> Our recent survey of around 1000 homes
 in Menstrie revealed several          
 interesting facts. Many families have 
 four in the family. In fact 75% of the
 people we interviewed had a family of 
 four. Some of the people we           
 interviewed had come from the north   
 east of Scotland and Glasgow. Many of 
 the people who came from the north    
 east came because of Glenochil        
 Detention Centre nearby, the men being
 prison officers. D.C.L. brought       
 families from Glasgow to work in the  
 local yeast factory. Much of the      
 population work nearby but some work  
 as far away as Papua, New Guinea. In a
 lot of cases both the husband and wife
 work. Our survey underlined the fact  
 that Menstrie is a commuter area which
 is amply served by buses and trains   
 nearby.
