   BUCKIE HARBOUR IS NO LONGER ONE OF  
 THE MAIN FISH LANDING PORTS IS        
 SCOTLAND. BUCKIE STILL HAS A          
 CONSIDERABLE FISHING FLEET BUT MOST OF
 THE BOATS NOW WORK OUT OF PETERHEAD,  
 OR WEST COAST PORTS SUCH AS LOCHINVER,
 KINLOCHBERUIE, AND MALLAIG. HOWEVER,  
 IN 1985 THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN 
 FISH LQNDINGS AT BUCKIE AND A         
 PARTICULAR FEATURE HAS BEEN DANISH    
 SHRIMP FISHERMEN LANDING THEIR CATCH  
 AT BUCKIE. THIS WAS FIRST STIMULATED  
 BY A STRIKE IN PROCESSING FACTORIES IN
 DENMARK BUT LANDINGS STILL CONTINUE AT
 BUCKIE WELL AFTER THE STRIKE HAS BEEN 
 SOLVED. MORAY SEAFOODS FACTORY        
 PROVIDES THE MAIN MARKET FOR THE      
 SHRIMPS.                              
   BUCKIE FISHING BOATS CARRY THE      
 REGISTRATION LETTERS BCK.             </content>
