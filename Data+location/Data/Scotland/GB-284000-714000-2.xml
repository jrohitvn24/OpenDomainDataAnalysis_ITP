		<title>02FARMING MUTHILL MAIN CROPS</title>
		<content>                                       
 The land in our area is used mainly   
 for farmland and woodland.            
{Barley} is the most common crop. The  
 head is used for{malting}.Before it is
 malted it has to be tested to make    
 sure it is suitable. The rejected     
 barley is crushed and given to the    
 cows. The stalks are used for         
 bedding cows, sheep or pigs in winter.
{Wheat} and {oats} are also grown but  
 there is less of these than barley.   
 The oats are sold for seed. The wheat 
 is used for animal feed.              
{Grass} is grown on much of the land   
 for grazing {cows, horses}and {sheep} 
 .In winter, sheep from the hills are  
 brought down to this area where there 
 is more food. The cattle and sheep are
 taken to market at Stirling or Perth. 
{Rough grazing} is grass that is not   
 fertilised - used mainly for sheep.   </content>
