		<title>02Farming in Papa Westray</title>
		<content> There are seventeen farms ranging from
 thirty acres to three hundred and     
 thirty five acres, farmed by families 
 who get most of their living off the  
 land.                                 
{Crops }Most of the farms cultivate a  
 few acres for oats, turnips and       
 potatoes. All the farms make hay and  
 eight also make silage for winter feed
 as most of the cattle are housed for  
 six months in winter.                 
{Animals }Beef cattle are bred on all  
 the farms. Aberdeen Angus cows are    
 crossed with continental breeds which 
 can be obtained from an artificial    
 insemmination group.                  
 Six farms keep sheep, mostly North    
 Country Cheviots crossed with Suffolk,
 the lambs being sold in October, or   
 November.In one farm Shetland Ewes are
 crossed with Suffolk.No horses have   
 been used in twenty years.            </content>
