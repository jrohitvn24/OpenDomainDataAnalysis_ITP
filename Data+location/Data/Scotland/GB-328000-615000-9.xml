		<content>    Most of the entertainment in this  
 part of the Ettrick Valley is centred 
 round the local Inn.  Locals and      
 holidaymakers enjoy the friendly      
 atmosphere of the country inn while   
 sampling the good food and            
 refreshments.   Pool, darts and       
 dominoes are available for those      
 wishing to play.  During the Summer   
 months the occasional cricket match   
 takes place climaxing at the end of   
 the season with a friendly match      
 between local employers v employees.  
   During the Winter friendly          
 competitions are arranged with a team 
 from the Inn challenging the local    
 badminton and bowling clubs with the  
 return matches being held in the Inn. 
   Residents in this area travel only a
 few miles to the local hall for       
 dances, whists, shows etc. held       
 yearly.                               </content>
