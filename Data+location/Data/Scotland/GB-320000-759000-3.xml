		<title>03Post Office in Glenisla.</title>
		<content> There is a post office in Glenisla,   
 which opens every day except Sunday.It
 closes on Wednesday and Saturday      
 afternoons. A mail bus and a Royal    
 Mail van serve the glen. The mail bus 
 comes every day except Sunday from    
 Alyth, about twelve miles distant,    
 with letters, parcels and milk. Daily 
 newspapers are brought by this bus and
 delivered with the mail. The post     
 office sells postcards, sweets and    
 papers. It is very small and forms    
 part of the house in which the people 
 who run it live. The mail bus doubles 
 as a bus service and passengers may   
 travel to and fro from Alyth on it.   
 There is only one delivery of mail    
 each day and similarly mail is        
 uplifted only once each day.
