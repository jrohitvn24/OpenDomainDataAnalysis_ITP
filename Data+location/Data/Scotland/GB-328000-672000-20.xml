		<content>{The Portobello Bypass.                
 At present Portobello is in the middle
 of 3 years of{"road up" signs}and     
{traffic diversions}due to the         
 construction of the new bypass road.  
 This new road will be known officially
 as the{East Approach Road to Leith}and
 will cost around Â£25 million. It will 
 be an integral part of the projected  
{City Bypasses}and will help to        
 distribute traffic from these roads   
 and improve access to the port of     
 Leith and the industrial estates at   
 Baileyfield and Seafield. It will also
 help to{relieve congestion on         
{Portobello High Street}and improve    
 conditions for shoppers there.        
 However during the construction period
 local bus services are being seriously
 disrupted and loud concerns are being 
 voiced by traders whose business is   
 falling due to poor access.           </content>
