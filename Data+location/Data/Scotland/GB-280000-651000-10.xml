		<content> A bus garage is situated in our       
 village(Law).The name of the company  
 is Irvine of Law and they own 18      
 buses.Each service bus has a          
 conductress.It costs Â£50 to pay the   
 drivers and conductresses each per    
 day.Both drivers and conductresses    
 work up to 8 hours on each service bus
 a day.On single buses 53 passengers   
 can be seated,while the double deckers
 carry 82 passengers.The drivers drive 
 up to 316.8 miles per day.Throughout  
 the day approximately 800 people      
 travel on service buses.              
  Irvine buy their buses from all kinds
 of dealers over Scotland and England. 
 We were surprised to find that        
 although a bus is about twice as large
 as a car,the tax is the same.The buses
 vary from 36-40 feet.                 
  Hutchison operate a similar service  
 in Overtown.                          </content>
