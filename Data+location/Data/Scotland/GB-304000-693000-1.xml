		<content> The landscape of block 03040693       
 Knockhill is hilly and undulating in  
 the South West, and there is a large  
 marshy area in Outh Muir in the North 
 East. This area lies to the North West
 of Dunfermline in West Fife the lowest
 point is 223 metres in the South East 
 to 364 metres at the summit of        
 Knockhill.                            
 The land is mainly used for sheep and 
 cattle rearing, but there is evidence 
 of earlier coal mining in the area.   
 A racing circuit has been established 
 on the slopes of Knockhill and both   
 motor cycling and car racing takes    
 place here.                           
 Few people live in the area and they  
 are mainly farm workers. There are    
 radio communications masts on         
 Knockhill and the A 823 is the only   
 road that crosses the area from the   
 South East to the North West.         </content>
