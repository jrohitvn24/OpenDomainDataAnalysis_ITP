		<content> T.A.UNIT---EAST KILBRIDE.             
   Within our designated area we have a
{TERRITORIAL ARMY UNIT-}T.A.for short. 
 It is called 222 squadron of{ROYAL    
{CORPS OF TRANSPORT.}Eighty per cent of
 the volunteer members of this unit    
 live in East Kilbride and they train  
 two evenings a week and at week-ends. 
 They are not full-time soldiers,but   
 their training is very tough and in a 
 national emergency they could be      
 called upon to defend our country.    
 Their headquarters in the town consist
 of a huge drill hall and garaging for 
 large army vehicles and during a      
 sortie from the unit,the vehicles     
 travel in convoy.                     
 This week-end 21-6-85 the unit go on  
 exercise to LINCOLNSHIRE,ENGLAND for  
 two weeks.
