		<content>{PUBLIC TRANSPORT}is limited in this   
 rural area,and almost every household 
 owns a vehicle.A{Postbus}runs to      
 Hawick on six afternoons every week,  
 and a{Community Bus}owned by the      
 district goes to Jedburgh on a Friday,
 and Hawick on a Saturday.People may   
 also fill any spaces on the two High  
 School buses going to Hawick and      
 Jedburgh.The drawback is,that these   
 buses only touch one small part of the
 block,and are out of reach of many    
 elderly people,although the Community 
 Bus makes detours if requested.       
{PRIVATE TRANSPORT}is usually a        
 car,although many young people have   
 motor bikes,and Farmers of course have
 a very wide range of vehicles.There is
 also a{Haulage Firm}in the block which
 specialises in transporting livestock.
{HORSES}are ridden for pleasure,fox-   
 hunting,and on some hill farms.       </content>
