		<title>09OIL SUPPLY BOATS</title>
		<content> Oil supply vesssels have become a very
 familar site in the sea around        
 Aberdeen.Instantly recognisable by    
 their specially designed high bow and 
 low broad stern.This enables anchoring
 from the rear which facilitates easier
 loading onto the rig,and towing the   
 rig if required.Some only berth in the
 harbour for a matter of hours.Once    
 loaded its straight back out to the   
 rig,usually making three journeys a   
 week.They are mainly of Scandinavian  
 or benelux origin.Only a very small   
 percentage are British.They literally 
 transport everything from food and    
 water to paper,pipes and drill bits.  
 One exception are personnel who are   
 flown out by helicopters.Working on   
 these boats can be very hazerdous.    
 heavy seas with 80 foot swells occur  
 and seamen can be crushed when a boat 
 and rig collide in high,stormy sea.   </content>
