		<content> Over 80%  of the houses have private{ 
{telephones}and there are two public   
 telephone boxes.{Mail}brought from    
 Newton Stewart each morning is sorted 
 in the post office and is taken out by
 postmen in vans or on foot.There is   
 one delivery every  day except on     
 Sundays and  Post Office holidays.Mail
 can be posted at the Post Office or in
 one of the two other{post boxes.}     
{Television}reception has been improved
 by having a booster aerial put on     
 Bankfield Fell. People can now also   
 get more {Scottish}programmes. A large
 percentage of houses now have 2 TV    
 sets, partly due to increase in number
 of families with computers. More than 
 half of school's families have{videos.
 The Regional{Library}van which calls  
 in the village once a fortnight is not
 heavily patronised.
