 Mr Duncan MacRae went to Dornie School
 in 1922 when he was six. The school   
 was run by two teachers as it is now. 
 Mr. MacRae remained at the school     
 until he was 15. He studied           
 maths,English and latin. The children 
 had to walk to school and during      
 summer went barefoot. They were only  
 allowed to wear boots when the first  
 snow appeared on Skye. There were no  
 school meals but some people provided 
 barrels of apples and oranges and     
 large biscuits called Tobermory       
 biscuits. They had cocoa to drink. Mr 
 MacRae's childhood was spent on the   
 croft. He had to take the cattle out  
 every morning to the hill and bring   
 them back at night. The hay for the   
 cattle was cut with a scythe. This was
 done in bare feet and was quite       
 painful.                              </content>
