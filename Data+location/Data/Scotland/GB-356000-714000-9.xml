		<title>09DOVECOTS</title>
		<content>  Fife has long been remarkable for the
 number of its dovecots. By the end of 
 the eighteenth century there were 360 
 in the county. Many dovecots in Fife  
 were demolished within recent years,  
 yet no fewer than 93 have been        
 recorded.                             
  There are two rectangular dovecots on
 the north side of Boarhills standing  
 within 70 yards of each other.The     
 western one measuring 13 feet 5 inches
 by 13 feet 10 inches is in ruinous    
 condition while the eastern one       
 measuring 14 feet 10 inches by 14 feet
 6 inches is  entire.They are built    
 of rubble and are harled.The flanks   
 are crow_stepped,the back wall is     
 higher than the front,and there is a  
 lean_to roof of timber.               
      They probably date from the      
 seventeenth century.
