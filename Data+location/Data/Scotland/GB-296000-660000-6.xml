		<title>06UNEMPLOYMENT IN BREICH AREA</title>
		<content>    The{biggest problem} in this area  
 is unemployment. In the households of 
 our class of 39 pupils there are 25   
 unemployed persons.                   
    What are the reasons for this? Well
 in the last year West Lothian's two   
 biggest employers, British Leyland at 
 Bathgate and the N.C.B. at Polkemmet  
 colliery, have closed with the{loss of
{almost 6ooo jobs.}In addition many    
 smaller firms have either gone out of 
 business or moved away.               
    What is being done? In this area   
 the Manpower Services Commission has  
 set up Various Workshop Schemes in    
 Stoneyburn and there are two community
 schemes known by their initials,      
 B.E.A.G. and C.O.W.L. Community       
 Education also tries to help by       
 running courses and activities for the
 area's  unemployed, especially the    
 young.                                </content>
