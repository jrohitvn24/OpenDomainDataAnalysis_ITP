		<title>14FARMING</title>
		<content> The main type of farming is dairying. 
 The climate and type of soil is an    
 advantage and the large markets       
 adjacent to Renfrew (eg Glasgow)      
 provides a ready market for milk. The 
 average size of farm is around 100    
 hectares. Rape is grown on most farms 
 as a fodder crop for winter feed and  
 as a cash crop for the extraction of  
 vegetable oils. Drainage is a problem 
 on most farms. Field drains using     
 tiles are used. The main breed of     
 dairy cow is Ayrshire with some       
 Friesians. Recent EEC decisions to cut
 back milk production by 45% has caused
 a number of problems. A characteristic
 building on all farms is the silo     
 where the winter feed is stored. A    
 problem facing farmers is the disposal
 of silage effluent. If it escapes onto
 the land it can cause serious         
 pollution.                            </content>
