		<content>        The countryside is hilly       
 sloping up from the Solway Firth and  
 is mostly farmland with quite a lot of
 woods.We have a river called the      
 Kirtle.We live near the A74 in the    
 village ofKirkpatrick-Fleming.The     
 school inext to a railway line.       
 There are no towns in our area but    
 there are 15 farms.                   
   The main railway line from London to
 Glasgow runs through our village      
 beside the A74.                       
   Most people in Kirkpatrick-Fleming  
 work as farmers because in this area  
 there aren't as many jobs as in a     
 town.                                 
   Most people live in farmhouses      
 because our dads are farmers. Some    
 people live in cottages or council    
  houses in the village.
