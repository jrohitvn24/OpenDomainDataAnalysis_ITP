		<title>03THORNHILL OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school lies beside the Kippen road
 in Lowtown. It has fifty two pupils   
 and three teachers; Mrs McAree, Mrs   
 MacGregor and Mrs Stevenson. We also  
 have visiting teachers for music,     
 P.E., art, sewing and a remedial      
 teacher who works with children who   
 need special help. We use the swing   
 park opposite for football and have   
 netball in the playground. There is   
 quite a busy road road to cross and   
 the headteacher always supervises our 
 crossing. We are at school for six and
 a half hours, from 9 am. to 3.30pm.   
 Our main subjects are English,        
 Mathematics, Arithmetic and           
 Environmental Studies (History,       
 Science and Geography). There is a    
 Health Visitor who comes to see our   
 general health. We also have visits   
 from the Dentist, Chiropidist and     
 Audio-Visual specialists.             </content>
