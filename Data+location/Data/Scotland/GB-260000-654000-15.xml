		<title>15Visit to Village Theatre EK</title>
		<content>  In June 1985 my primary class went on
 a visit to East Kilbride Theatre. This
 modern and well equipped small theatre
 was opened in 1977 by the famous Scot-
 tish actor Mr. Andrew Cruickshank.    
  The theatre is used by the E Kilbride
 Light Opera who perform a musical show
 once a year, the E Kilbride Repertory 
 Theatre Club who put on five plays and
 one pantomime every year and the EK   
 Gilbert and Sullivan Society who stage
 an opera annually. The theatre is used
 for a Festival in August, while other 
 uses include Young Farmers' Club Shows
 and displays by dancing and gymnastics
 clubs. Most of the clubs are amateur  
 though famous professional actors do  
 sometimes perform here also. We were  
 shown backstage, were taught the      
 technical terms for the equipment and 
 were allowed to work the lights, the  
 sound and the mirror ball.{(L.Petrie) </content>
