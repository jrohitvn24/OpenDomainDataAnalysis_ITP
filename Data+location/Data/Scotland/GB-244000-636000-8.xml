		<title>08DAILY LIFE IN CROOKEDHOLM.</title>
		<content> Most of the people in Crookedholm if  
 they have work, as there is high      
 unemployment in the area, travel to   
 Kilmarnock or Hurlford. The majority  
 are manual workers. All of the school 
 children in the village attend either 
 the small local primary or James      
 Hamilton Academy, both within walking 
 distance. Most of the housing is local
 authority. Leisure time can be spent  
 in the countryside around the village 
 or at the various events in the       
 Community Centre (eg. bingo, discos,  
 youth clubs). In nearby Kilmarnock    
 there are many pubs, hotels, wine     
 bars, bingo halls, a cinema, a        
 theatre, a country park and many      
 smaller parks. Kilmarnock also has an 
 excellent shopping centre. There are  
 good libraries in Kilmarnock and      
 Hurlford.
