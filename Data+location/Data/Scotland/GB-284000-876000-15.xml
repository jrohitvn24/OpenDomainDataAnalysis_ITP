  INTERVIEW WITH MR BOA                
 John Horton and I went to interview Mr
 Boa on Monday the twentieth of May    
 1985. We found out the following      
 information.                          
    Mr Boa is 86 and he has lived in   
 this area for 34 years.He used to work
 as a hallboy in a mansion and also as 
 a shepherd.He retired at the age of 70
 in 1969.He made his first walking     
 stick at the age of seven.Most of his 
 wood comes from Caithness and Loch -  
 Ness.It takes a whole day to make a   
 walking stick but four days to varnish
 it and for the varnish to set in.Mr   
 Boa works 8 hours a day at one walking
 stick.He made a stick for Prince      
 Charles and Lady Diana.He never       
 received any letters of thanks.He     
 became interested in sticks because   
 his uncle showed him how to make one. </content>
