		<title>11Churches,Kinbrace</title>
		<content> There are two Churches in Kinbrace.   
 The Free Church is a stone building   
 and was built in the 1890s. The Church
 of Scotland is made of timber covered 
 with corrugated iron and was built in 
 1920. Monthly services are held in the
 Free Church but there are no services 
 in the Church of Scotland due to lack 
 of interest and depopulation. The     
 churchyard near Kinbrace is on a sandy
 knoll. There is a very interesting    
 gravestone with mortality emblems- a  
 man's face, a coffin and a bell. It is
 dated 1779. In a lonely spot amid the 
 hills not very far from Kinbrace is a 
 churchyard and the ruins of a very old
 church which was last used at the     
 beginning of the 19th century. Around 
 are the remains of homesteads which   
 were burnt at the time of the         
 notorious Highland Clearances.
