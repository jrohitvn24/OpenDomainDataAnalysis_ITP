		<content> Most of the men are involved with an  
 occupation involving the land eg.     
 agriculture, haulage, factory and as  
 such are extremely busy at certain    
 times of the year with sowing,        
 harvesting etc. The major activities  
 are:- Farmers Mertings - These are    
 held on a monthly basis and usually   
 consist of a guest speaker and        
 discussion. They are normally well    
 attended. Rhynie Football Team -      
 Because of the weather matches are    
 played in the Summer League, that is  
 April to September. There is strong   
 competition and unfortunately Rhynie  
 has not been extremely successful in  
 the past few years. This is primarily 
 due to the fact that the majority of  
 young men here had to leave the       
 village to find work and an           
 unavailable for the week-night        
 matches.                              </content>
