{pupils}                               
 Craigievar School is 106 years old.   
 There are 30 pupils.  The building    
 used to be a County Library.  There   
 are two permanent teachers and        
 five itinerant teachers for music,    
 art, drama, physical education and    
 home economics.  Our uniform is a grey
 skirt or trousers, a green, grey and  
 maroon tie, a green shirt and grey    
 pullover.  The annual sports and prize
 giving are held in the adjoining      
 field and is attended by our          
 parents. We go to school at 9.00a.m., 
 have lunch in school from 12.30 to    
 1.30p.m. and go home at 3.30. The     
 house adjoining our school, now       
 privately owned, was occupied by      
 previous Head Teachers. We            
 sometimes perform concerts for parents
 and members of the local community.   </content>
