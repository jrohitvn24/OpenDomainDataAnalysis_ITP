		<title>15BANCHORY DEVENICK CHURCH II</title>
		<content>  The site of the church has been a    
 place of worship since the{800's}when 
{St.Devenick}founded a settlement here.
 He brought Christianity here and did  
 most of his work here. He is buried   
 beneath the south wall of the existing
 building.                             
  During the{1600's}this was a{Roman   
{Catholic settlement}run by priests but
 then came the{Reformation}and the     
 first minister of the Presbyterian    
 Church.                               
{ George Morrison}was our most famous  
 minister for he built{The Shakin' Brig
 over the Dee joining the two old      
 parts of the parish. Since then the   
 River has changed course and the      
 bridge is no longer in use and is     
 now in disrepair.
