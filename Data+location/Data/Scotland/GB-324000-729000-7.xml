		<title>07THE MOBILE SHOP IN ABERNYTE</title>
		<content> There is a mobile grocery van in      
 Abernyte which is known as "Andie's   
 Van".The owner has the shop and the   
 van.He drives it ina radius of 6 miles
 around his shop in Abernyte.Many of   
 his customers are old people or people
 who do not have cars.He keeps his van 
 in the garage next to his shop.He can 
 refill it every day,with fresh bread, 
 vegetables,dairy produce,freezerfood, 
 sweets and other groceries.Regulations
 say he is only allowed to carry a     
 certain amount of food.At one time he 
 had a lot of customers but now many go
 to the supermarkets in Perth or Dundee
 If his customer is out they leave a   
 note.He gets anything his customers   
 ask him for as there is not that much 
 variety in his van.The van is a green 
 3 ton Ford van when empty and 4 ton if
 full.It costs Â£290 to tax a year.The  
 V.G.Van is 17 years old.              </content>
