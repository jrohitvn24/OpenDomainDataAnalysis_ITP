		<content> Education in Lochgoilhead starts with 
 playgroup for under fives.The village 
 school is a non-denominational,       
 co-educational primary.The 27 pupils  
 are taught by 2 teachers.Mr.MacGregor 
 (Head Teacher) teaches Pr.4-7 and Miss
 MacLuskie Pr.1-3.The pupils attend    
 school 5 days a week,Monday-Friday,   
 from 09.00-15.30(infants 09.30-15.00).
 After seven years at primary school   
 they attend Dunoon Grammar School     
 which is a non-denominational,        
 co-educational,six year comprehensive.
 As Dunoon Grammar School is so far    
 away (over 30 miles) the children     
 board in the School Hostel from Monday
 to Friday.The pupils are conveyed to  
 and from Dunoon by bus.The bus leaves 
 Lochgoilhead at 07.30 which means an  
 early rise for the children,especially
 those from Carrick Castle which is six
 miles from Lochgoilhead.              </content>
