 magnificent 16th century castle called
 Earlshall. The present owners, Major  
 and Mrs Baxter, have opened 10 of the 
 30 rooms to the public, and last year 
 had 4,000 visitors. Special features  
 inculde; a display of over 100 basket 
 -hilted swords in the Long Gallery; a 
 small museum; a rod and gun room; a   
 collection of mugs and Jacobite       
 glasses; some beautiful wood          
 panelling and a famous oak screen.    
 Most of the rooms have wooden         
 ceilings, beams exposed and           
 beautifully painted with coats of arms

 The castle has a large formal garden  
 which includes Yews shaped liked      
 chessmen, the old castle well and
