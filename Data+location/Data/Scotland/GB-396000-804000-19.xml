		<title>19LORISTON COUNTRY PARK  1</title>
		<content> The most northerly part of Loriston   
 Country Park lies within our D-block, 
 although what actually exists does not
 fufill ones expectations of a Country 
 Park.                                 
 The idea of designating the area a    
 Country Park was put forward  by the  
 Council in 1970 with ambitious plans  
 to cater for golfers,birdwatchers,    
 walkers and picnickers.Simultaneously 
 local farming was to be maintained    
 thus creating and preserving a        
 'country atmosphere".Even then there  
 was some sceptism about the proposals 
 when one considered the actual        
 location and in reality these plans   
 have never come to fruition.          
 One of the major features of the      
 "park"today is the City's domestic and
 industrial refuse tip where about 800 
 tonnes of pulverised rubbish is       
 produced and dumped every week.Added  </content>
