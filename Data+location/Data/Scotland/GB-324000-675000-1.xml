		<title>01THE POWDERHALL INCINERATOR</title>
		<content> The Powderhall Incinerator was opened 
 in 1971 by the Lord Provost at the    
 cost of Â£1900000. It burns 800 tonnes 
 of refuse every week.  The chimney is 
 200 feet tall.  There used to be two  
 other incinerators in the city, one at
 Russell Road and the other at Craig-  
 :millar.  One was destroyed by fire,  
 the other was closed down.            
                                       
           {Pollution                  
                                       
 Residents in the Wardie and Trinity   
 areas have complained about the dust  
 and the fumes.  The Inverleith Associ-
 :ation protested that the dust was    
 becoming unbearable.  It was particu- 
 :larly bad when there was a haar or a 
 light easterly wind.  1300 residents  
 signed a petition for the Health      
 Service to take action.  The Inciner- 
 :ator is to be gradually phased out.  </content>
