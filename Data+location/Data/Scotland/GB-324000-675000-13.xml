		<title>13SOUTH LEITH PARISH</title>
		<content> Founded in 1483, it was where         
 education began in Leith. From this   
 Leith Academy emerged and from 1560,  
 the Kirk Session was responsible for  
 it.  The Church now has a roll of     
 about 1900 and is adapting and        
 changing to meet the needs of the     
 present community.                    
{LEITH ACADEMY                         
 Records from 1560 show that under     
 various names it has occupied several 
 sites.  In 1806, 1898 and again in    
 1931 new buildings were needed as the 
 old ones were inadequate.  For the    
 past 20years the people of Leith have 
 been fighting for a new school for    
 their children. The tree buildings    
 used at present are old, in need of   
 repair and ill equipped. A new school 
 at Quarrtholes would cost over Â£5     
 million, but with its improved fac-   
 :ilities would give a brighter future.</content>
