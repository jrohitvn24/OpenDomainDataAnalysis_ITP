		<title>18LAND USE</title>
		<content> Much of the land is uncultivated open 
 moorland used by crofters as common   
 grazing for black face sheep.An annual
 unorganised muirburn takes place each 
 spring to encourage young heather     
 growth for sheep to eat.Bare rock is  
 exposed at many places.Where peat     
 exists close to a road it is cut      
 during May and June to be dried and   
 used as domestic fuel.Much manual     
 effort is involved because the uneven 
 terrain does not permit the use of    
 machinery.The fenced croftland has    
 been improved for grazing by using    
 shell sand from local beaches,and     
 reseeding.Small areas of the poor     
 peaty soil have been formed into      
 lazybeds about 6m wide with drainage  
 ditches running down the slope on     
 either side.Hay,potatoes,and some oats
 are grown on these lazybeds.
