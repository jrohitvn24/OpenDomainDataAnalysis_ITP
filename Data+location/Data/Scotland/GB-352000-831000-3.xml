		<content> NJ526314{SLATE BRIG}(BRIDGE). This is 
 an old unused bridge over the River   
 Bogie, built with slates from the old 
 quarries in Gartly.                   
 NJ526314{PILL BOX}One of the very few 
 relics of the Second World war. It is 
 situated at a bend on the B9002 road  
 by a bridge over the River Bogie and  
 the main Aberdeen-Inverness railway.  
 NJ522324{GARTLY STATION.}This used to 
 be the name of the village as written 
 on the maps,as a station was          
 officially opened on 19th Sept 1854 as
 a stop on The Great North of Scotland 
 Railway Line (GNSR). Regular services 
 continued (later as part of the LNER) 
 until the 1960's when the station,    
 though not the line, was closed. For  
 several years the name was removed    
 totally from the maps until letters   
 from the pupils explained that an     
 expanding village still existed.      </content>
