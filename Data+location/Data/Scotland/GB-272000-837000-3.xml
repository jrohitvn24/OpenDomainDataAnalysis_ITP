 swim in the summer in the river.The   
 river sometimes floods and then people
 can't swim.There are 102 steps down to
 the river.There are two paths to the  
 river,one is over the A9 and the other
 is on other side of the valley.People 
 go to the little burn just up the road
 from the river.It has a little        
 waterfall in it which you can slide   
 down into the water below.There is a  
{public park}by the{Daviot Primary     
{School.}It has a climbingframe,two    
 swings ,a slide ,a sea-saw and a bench
 to sit on. It is quite big park and   
 very well looked after.There is a     
 litter bin just outside the fence of  
 the park.The grass is cut             
 every-so-often by the people of       
 Highland Region.
