		<content> Our block lies some 6 miles west of   
 the city of Aberdeen, mainly on the   
 south side of the River Dee.  Most of 
 the suburban housing is on the north  
 side and the south is still largely   
 pleasant parkland and woodland.       
 Kingcausie Estate occupies a good part
 of our area.  There is a rose farm    
 with its adjoining tourist attraction 
 Storybook Glen.  There are small      
 housing developments at Burnhead,     
 Fernieslack, Kirkton.  Milltimber in  
 the north of our block is part of a   
 larger housing scheme.  Most people   
 commute to Aberdeen and are engaged in
 oil related industries.  The River    
 Dee is a fine salmon fishing river.   
 The whole area popularised by the     
 Royal Family is favoured by visitors  
 to Scotland.
