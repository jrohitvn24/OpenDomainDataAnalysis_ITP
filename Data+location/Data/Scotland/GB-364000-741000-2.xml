		<title>02ARBROATH ABBEY</title>
		<content> This famous abbey was founded by King 
 William,the Lion in the 12th century  
 for the monks of Tiron. Long before   
 the abbey was completed, King William 
 died and his body was buried in front 
 of the high alter.It grew to become   
 the second richest abbey in Scotland. 
          However, Scotland at this    
 time was frequently attacked by the   
 English and so the nobles wrote a     
 letter to the Pope,in Latin,asking for
 their independence.                   
     The letter was composed by Bernard
 de Linton and when it was finished,the
 noblemen  came from all over Scotland 
 to sign it and add their seal.        
       The reformation changed         
 everything.The monks moved  away and  
 the abbey soon fell into ruin. Much of
 the stone of the abbey was used by the
 people of Arbroath for building their 
 homes.                                </content>
