		<title>02WATER OF LEITH</title>
		<content> We have been studying the vegetation  
 along the Water of Leith from Powder- 
 :hall to Ferry Road.  Here are the    
 results.                              
{Wild Vegetation  Landscaped Vegetation
 Ivy, Nettles,    Primrose, Oak Tree,  
 Thistles, Yarrow Rhododendron, Lime,  
 Ferns, Foxglove  Elderberry, Beech,   
 Hogweed, Reeds,  Sycamore, Ash,       
 Old Man's Beard  Pussy Willow         
             {Pollution                
 Parts of the Water of Leith are very  
 beautiful, but pollution has spoiled  
 some areas.  There is much rubbish in 
 the water; e.g. tin cans, wood, bits  
 of metal, plastic bottles.  Graffiti  
 on the walls spoils the appearance of 
 the walkway.  Despite this it is a    
 popular place.  Certain amenities have
 been provided such as benches, a play-
 :park and a tiled pathway so that you 
 can enjoy your walk.                  </content>
