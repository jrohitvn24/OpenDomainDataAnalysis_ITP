 OF LESLIE IN THE GENTLE FOOTHILLS OF  
 THE LOMOND HILLS WITH ITS OUTLOOK

 SURPRISINGLY HAS ONLY A DAY MAID WHO  
 WORKS IN THE HOUSE. THE PRESENT OWNERS
 OWNERS HAVE NEVER TAKEN IN ANY LIVE-IN
 MAIDS, BUTLERS etc,BUT STILL USE IT AS
 A FAMLIY HOME.

 USED IT AS A FAMILY HOME WITH HELP.   
 AROUND THE HOUSE ARE 7 ACRES OF MIXED 
 DECIDUOUS AND CONIFEROUS TREES WHICH  
 BOTH ACT AS SHELTER BELTS TO LANDSCAPE
 IT,AND AS WELL AS SOME FIELDS FOR     
 GRAZING.                              </content>
