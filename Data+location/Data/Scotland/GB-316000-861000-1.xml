		<content> The southern half of Block 0316/0861  
 is almost entirely flat, low-lying,   
 arable farmland.  The River Lossie    
 meanders in and out again on the      
 eastern edge.  Many ditches and       
 drainage canals criss-cross the land  
 to prevent it becoming water-logged.  
 The Forestry Commission's Nursery at  
 Newton occupies the north-west corner.
 The wood-covered hill, Quarry Wood,   
 fills the rest of the northern half.  
 A most beautiful stretch of the A96   
 cuts through this lovely wood.  The   
 wood conceals several worked-out      
 sand-stone quarries, gravel pits and  
 ancient earth-works.  The area is     
 dotted with farm-houses and steadings 
 with, here and there, larger country  
 mansions.  This is a most pleasant    
 place to live and work.
