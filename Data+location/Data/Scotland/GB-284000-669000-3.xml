		<title>03LIMERIGG CROFTING 2</title>
		<content> In her garden Mrs Kay grows turnips,  
 carrots,cabbages and other vegetables 
 which are for her own use. The croft  
 dates back to 1728 and originally the 
 roof would have been thatched. When   
 built,it was called "The Wee Black    
 Loch" but it is not known exactly when
 the name was changed. The croft is of 
 linear shape. The first room is used  
 as a store room. Next is the barn     
 where the young calves are kept.      
 Through a door is a multi-purpose     
 room,ie living room,bedroom and also  
 where the meals are cooked in pots    
 which are suspended from the"swee"and 
 hang above a very large coal fire.    
 There is another bedroom next door.   
 The croft has a supply of cold water  
 but there is no running hot water or  
 plumbed in toilet.                    
 Mrs Kay,now in her eighties keeps     
 remarkably good health.               </content>
