		<content>  Coll relies heavily on tourism to    
 keep business going,namely Hotel,     
 Guest House,Shop and Self Catering    
 Accomadation. During the summer months
 a lot of Yachts visit the island, some
 for a few hours or perhaps a few days 
 depending on the weather. There can be
 over 400 yachts in during the season  
   Families with holiday houses are    
 also regular visitors.                
    People with special intrests in    
 bird watching botany,geology and      
 diving visit the island regularly.    
  There are very few recreation        
 facilities provided on the island.    
 People like to make thier own         
 entertainment. Visitors do not come   
 here for an entermianment filled      
 holiday.
