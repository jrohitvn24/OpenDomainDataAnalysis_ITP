		<title>03AREA CHANGES II - PATHHEAD</title>
		<content> The old houses of Pathhead were       
 knocked down ten/fifteen years ago.   
 They were so old that the toilets were
 outside. Some of the people who lived 
 there were rehoused in the new multi  
 storey flats. It used to be a very    
 busy area but shops and factories     
 have closed down because people       
 started to buy carpets instead of     
 linoleum. Most of the men worked at   
 the linoleum factories. Pathhead used 
 to have a selection of entertainment. 
 They had the Rio and Carlton cinemas. 
 They also had the Pathhead Concert    
 hall. Now they only have the Kingsway 
 Bingo Hall. British Rail closed down  
 the railway station because of lack of
 profit. There is one listed building  
 in Pathhead.  It is the Feuars Arms.  
 It stands alone in the middle of      
 delerict streets. Someday the area    
 will be rebuilt.                      </content>
