		<title>13Andover Pr. School, Brechin</title>
		<content>    Andover School was built in        
 1859.There is an Annexe as well as the
 main building.The main building       
 contains classes 4-7.The Annexe       
 contains classes 1-3.The main building
 has a clock tower which has 4         
 faces.Andover is in the South-East of 
 the town.There is a School house but  
 it is used as a resources room,       
 printing room and a paper store. Mrs  
 MacIntosh is the school secretary     
 she prints things for the school      
 like notes for the parents.The        
 corridors are narrow and there are    
 pegs on the wall.The walls are made of
 half wood and half plaster so pin     
 boards are essential.The ceilings are 
 high and the radiators are clumsy.    
 Class 4-5 is composite.There is a     
 library area and we have sinks        
 throughout the school.There was some  
 repair to the ceilings last year.     </content>
