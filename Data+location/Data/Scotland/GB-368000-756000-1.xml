		<content> The 1985 Domesday Survey of{Montrose} 
 attempts in brief compass to highlight
 some of the issues which form part of 
 the contemporary scene. In-depth      
 treatment has not been possible       
 because of constraints as regards the 
 length of each article imposed on the 
 research team.{                       
{Montrose}is an ancient{Royal Burgh,}  
 now administered by Angus District    
 Council. It is bounded on the North by
 the River North Esk; on the South by  
 the River South Esk; on the West by   
 Montrose Basin and on the East by the 
 North Sea.                            
 Much of the underlying soil in the    
 East of the town is sand,while that of
 the West is formed of alluvial clay.  
{Montrose}is situated astride the A92  
 road and is served by the North       
 Eastern Region of British Rail.
