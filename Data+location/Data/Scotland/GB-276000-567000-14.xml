		<title>14The Bridge of Urr</title>
		<content> The bridge is really old. It was first
 built in 1542 by John McNaught of     
 Kilquhanity for the murder of William 
 Sinclair. It was built from stones    
 from Dryburgh Monastery.              
 The bridge was rebuilt in 1983 because
 it was not wide enough and a lorry hit
 the side. When they rebuillt it they  
 left two of the  original stones      
 bearing two coats of arms. One is that
 of King James V and the other is that 
 of John McNaught of Kilquhanity       
 himself.                              
 The bridge is the only crossing point 
 from Corsock to the Bridge of Urr.    
 When the river is low you can         
 sometimes stand on a small ledge under
 one of the arches and you will be able
 to see a plaque.
