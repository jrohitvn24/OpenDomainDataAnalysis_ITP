<title>23S.W.R.I. BUCHLYVIE ("The Rural")</title>
<content>

Formed in July 1919, Buchlyvie W.R.I. celebrated its ninetieth anniversary in 2009 with a happy, stylish gathering of members, guests and officials. The number of members nationally has gone down, with Buchlyvie now having 30-40, a fraction of its original 90 to 100. The banner is proudly displayed at each meeting, as is the specially embroidered blue linen table cloth. The second Tuesday remains "Rural Night" although the "light of the moon" to guide members is less vital, if more romantic, in these days of street lighting and the motor car. The varied syllabus is still as attractive as the committee can devise, but Buchlyvie WRI, like all organisations, struggles to compete for members against the wonders of television, the internet and other electronic devices.&lt;br />&lt;br />From a long drama tradition in the village and institute, the "Rural" established the "Buchlyvie Pantomime" in 1970. The pantomime production has been a great success, putting on shows six nights in a week, with collections for charity. It is now known as the "Village Pantomime" and is open to all who wish to tread the boards.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
