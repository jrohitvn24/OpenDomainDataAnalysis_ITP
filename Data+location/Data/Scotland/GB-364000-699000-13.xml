		<title>13Ecology - The Observatory</title>
		<content> While the superb seabird cliffs and   
 colonies of the Isle of May are       
 important in the context of eastern   
 Britain, it is an observatory for the 
 study of migrating birds that the     
 island is world famous.               
 Situated at the crossroads where the  
 north/south and east/west routes meet,
 the May is a stopping place for       
 thousands of birds of many species on 
 their biannual movements.             
 The observatory was established in    
 1934, but the island has been used for
 migration studies since 1907. The work
 of two Fife ladies, Miss Evelyn Baxter
 and Miss Leonora Rintoul, from 1907   
 onwards is still regarded as a major  
 contribution to our knowledge of the  
 factors affecting bird movement in the
 North Sea area. Nowadays the          
 Observatory is fully manned during the
 spring and autumn migration period.   </content>
