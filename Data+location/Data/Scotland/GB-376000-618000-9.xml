		<title>09AN UPLAND FARMERS MORNING</title>
		<content> A normal day in my life as an upland  
 farmer near Hownam,in Scotland,with   
 suckler cows and sheep,is from 6.45   
 a.m. to 8.p.m. I start the day with a 
 cup of tea,and then it is outside to  
 face the elements.I feed and milk the 
 goats and give the orphen lambs their 
 pellets.I let out the 2 sheep-dogs and
 go around the farm to check that the  
 livestock have come to no harm over   
 night.I find a ewe with mastitis which
 has to be caught, and given an        
 injection of penicillen and a tube of 
 penicillen must be inserted into her  
 udder.Hopefully I have caught it in   
 time,and she will recover.Then back to
 the house where my wife should have   
 fed the goat-milk to the orphen lambs,
 and have my breakfast ready. It is a  
 fine morning so my next job is to turn
 the hay,then if the weather holds, I  
 can bale some in the afternoon.       </content>
