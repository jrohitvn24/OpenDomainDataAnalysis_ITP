		<title>02MIRE END FARM :CAIRNEYHILL</title>
		<content> The farm is owned by Mr Duncan, and he
 has lived there for nine years .It is 
 on the outskirts of Cairneyhill       
 village and consists of 182 acres of  
 mixed land, with winter barley, spring
 barley, 84 cattle and 200 sheep.      
    The farm has only 2 workers,       
 himself and his wife, but he has many 
 machines e.g. 3 tractors,2 ploughs,2  
 balers, etc.                          
    He faces the problem of his crops  
 drying up in the summer,so he has to  
 irrigate them,and his land is also    
 split in two by a railway line which  
 takes coal trains to the Longannet    
 power station .Some old huts on the   
 farm, used as bases for soldiers in   
 the second world war, are now used for
 storage. As its name suggests, there  
 is also an area of the farm where the 
 land is too marshy to be used for crop
 growing. It is left for rough grazing.</content>
