		<title>20Football hooliganism</title>
		<content> A social concern is something that the
 whole community is worried about.The{ 
{media}emphasise the concern about     
 behaviour of football fans. The       
 government is concerned about keeping{
{law and order}in and around football  
 grounds before, during and after      
 matches. The clubs are encouraged by  
 the government to take responsible{   
{attitudes}and help the police to catch
 hooligans.                            
 Clubs have installed video cameras to 
 scan the crowd to identify trouble    
 makers and the police can arrest them.
 To prevent invasion of the pitch it   
 was suggested that the clubs should   
 enclose the fans with wire fencing.   
 However, after a recent disasterous   
 fire in a stand this would be safety  
 hazard. Alcohol is banned in Scottish 
 grounds and as a result fans seem to  
 be better behaved.                    </content>
