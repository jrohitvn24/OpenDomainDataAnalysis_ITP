		<content> LIKES                                 
 Most of us like this area because     
 there is a lot of lovely nature to    
 learn about and there are safe places 
 to play and walk.The trees are very   
 popular because we can climb          
 them.People like the country school   
 they go to.                           
 DISLIKES                              
 The majority of us feel sad about the 
 destruction of nature.Lots of us      
 dislike the cutting down of trees     
 because animals and birds are made    
 homeless-think-if you woke up and     
 there were no birds chirping.Others   
 have different ideas.Some dislike the 
 dangers of the narrow,twisting roads. 
 A lot of people live along way from   
 friends.It can get very boring.This   
 area is out of the way and it is very 
 difficult to get to hospitals and     
 doctors quickly.                      </content>
