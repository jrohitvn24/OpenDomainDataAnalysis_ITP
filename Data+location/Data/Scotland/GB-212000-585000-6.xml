		<title>06Transport in Colmonell</title>
		<content> Colmonell is one of the few areas in  
 Scotland that has a community bus as  
 its only means of public transport.The
 bus is called the Honey Bee.          
 The Honey Bee runs to Ballantrae once 
 a day (At around lunch time.) and to  
 Girvan three times a day during the   
 week.                                 
 The Honey Bee is unusual in that on   
 Saturdays it runs a limited service to
 Girvan with volunteer drivers from the
 community instead of its usual driver.
 The bus can also be hired by local    
 community groups in the evenings or on
 Sundays.                              
 The Honey Bee is also used to         
 transport the pupils who travel to and
 fro from Girvan Academy and to bring  
 school lunches from Girvan to the     
 village primary school.
