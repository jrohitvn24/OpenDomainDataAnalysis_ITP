		<content> During the tourist season most of the 
 jobs in Ullapool are tourist related  
 from bed and breakfast,guest houses,  
 motels,hotels to shops and camping    
 sites.                                
 The people employed in many of these  
 jobs come to the Ullapool area only   
 for the high season.                  
 Other important sources of employment 
 are the Highland Regional Council     
 Roads,Water and Sewerage Departments, 
 the Fishing Industries,the Forestry   
 Commission,the Quarry,Education and a 
 local Building Contractor.            
 In addition to these major employers  
 there are many small,self-employed    
 businessmen employing plumbers,masons,
 electricians,joiners,engineers,       
 painters and decorators.              
 The sub-Post Office and British
