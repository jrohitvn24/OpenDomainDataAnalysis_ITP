		<content> There have been great changes in the  
{employment}situation in the past      
 decade with a general decline in      
 traditional industries like {textiles}
 for example there used to be a shirt  
 factory in Lanark and one out at the  
 new {Industrial Estate}at             
 Caldwellside. There are however two   
 knitware factories ,which are still   
 surviving despite strong overseas     
 competition. There is no large scale  
 employer apart from {New Lanark}      
 Consevation Trust ,which has a large  
 Manpower services' workforce. The     
 emphasis is on small scale factory    
 units such as those at the {Industrial
{Estate}at Caldwellside.The {District  
{Council}have recently encouraged the  
 development of another small {        
{Industrial Estate }in Lanark          
 itself.Finally it is to be noted that 
 many people work outside the town.    </content>
