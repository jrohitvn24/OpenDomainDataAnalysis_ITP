		<content>   When a cow has calved she gives milk
 for ten months. Suckling cows feed the
 calves for about seven months. The    
 bull calves are then put out to rough 
 grazing until they are fourteen months
 old and fattened for the butcher.     
   The farmers keep two bulls to mate  
 with the cows. A Friesian heifer's    
 first calf is usually a Hereford since
 they are small and grow quickly.      
   The dairyman uses electric milking  
 machines to suck out the milk twice a 
 day. The milk is piped into a tank to 
 cool it, until the milk tanker comes  
 and takes it away to the creamery.    
   Each farm employs only three or four
 men.They all have tractors and fix    
 other machines to the back to do the  
 work. In summer they may employ extra 
 workers to cut silage or hay.
