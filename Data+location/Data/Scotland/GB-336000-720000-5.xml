		<content> The S.W.R.I. started in 1917,         
 alternately using Kilmany and         
 Rathillet churches. The 102 members   
 met monthly at full moon as this made 
 walking along unlit roads a lot       
 easier. These people had              
 demonstrations to show them practical 
 everyday skills such as butter-making,
 baking or knitting. Nowadays          
 demonstrators show only 30 members    
 very different skills such as basket- 
 weaving and flower arranging .Women   
 from the W.R.I. didn't meet in July   
 and August as this was the busy       
 harvest season and they had to help on
 the farm. The members of the W.R.I.   
 today still don't meet then but they  
 don't have to help as more and more   
 mechanical machines are being used on 
 farms.
