 There is no doctor, dentist or nurse  
 on the island. There is a doctor on   
 the Island of Eigg who comes out if   
 needed but usually diagnoses minor    
 complaints over the telephone. If     
 there is an emergency a helicopter is 
 called out or the doctor could charter
 the Eigg boat to bring him across.    
 Basically it is preferable not to     
 require medical assistance except on a
 ferry day so that treatment can be    
 sought on the mainland.               
 Dental treatment is similarly         
 inconvenient. There are sometimes     
 dentists among the National Trust work
 parties who visit the island who can  
 give check_ups but any resident       
 requiring treatment has to go to the  
 mainland for it.
