 Sited on the Kippen Road just outwith 
 the village is the{Ross Caravan Park, 
 which has 23 residential caravans.    
                                       
 Forming the edge of the village, the  
 50-house,{Fintry Hills Estate}is the  
 largest concentration of housing      
 and owner occupation. These were built
 to a density of a third acre per house
 in the late 60s and 70s.              
                                       
{Culcreuch House,}now a commercial     
 concern is still a family home.       
                                       
 Further into the village is the{Mill  
{House,}a vestige of the textile days  
 of the 19th century. Adjacent is the  
 edge of a well laid out{Council Estate
 described in square{02600684.
