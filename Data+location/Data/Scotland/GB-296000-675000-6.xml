		<title>06How Schools Have Changed</title>
		<content>   In the 1950's there were only three 
 schools in Linlithgow:_ Linlithgow    
 Academy,which was where Lowport       
 primary is today,St.Josephs primary   
 which was beside St.Micheals          
 R.C.church and Linlithgow primary     
 which was where the Westport primary  
 is today.                             
   In the 1960's St.Josephs moved up to
 a new building at Preston Road and    
 round about the same time Linlithgow  
 primary moved to their new building at
 Preston Road as well.The Academy also 
 moved to new premises at Braehead     
 Road.The old Academy became offices   
 before becoming Lowport Primary.      
   By the 1980's Linlithgow was        
 expanding and Lowport had too many    
 children so they built a new Primary  
 school in the middle of Springfield   
 housing estate.
