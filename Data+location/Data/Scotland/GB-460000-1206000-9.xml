		<title>09Local Museum - a local issue</title>
		<content> The Unst Local History Group  is a    
 flourishing group which has been      
 formed for 4 years and has held three 
 successful exhibitions on local       
 history.So successful were these      
 exhibitions that there was a general  
 feeling in favour of a small local    
 museum.Sites were discussed and meet- 
 ings were held and finally a choice   
 was made between 2 sites.At this point
 the local councillor felt the choice  
 made was unfair and took a firm stand 
 against it.Further meetings were held 
 with the Shetland Amenity Trust who   
 are behind the funding of such        
 projects and even a local referendum  
 was held which came out against the   
 first choice.Finally a stop gap of an 
 old shop was taken up while tempers   
 cool and hopefully a decision about a 
 permanent site will be made in the    
 near future.                          </content>
