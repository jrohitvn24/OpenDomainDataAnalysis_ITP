		<title>02A Shiskine Girl's Day 8/6/85</title>
		<content>   I'm Catriona Robertson from Shedock 
 Farm, Shiskine. On Saturday I rose at 
 9.30am and watched some T.V and then  
 dressed in tee shirt,trousers and     
 jumper. I had an orange,toast and tea 
 for breakfast. My friend came round to
 play and we went to the pool. When I  
 came back I had French toast for my   
 lunch. After lunch I went out to play 
 with my friend. I came in at 3.00pm to
 raid the house for biscuits and sweets
 My friend went home then.             
   I sat and read until my tea was     
 ready. For tea I had meat, vegetables 
 and potatoes. After my tea I played   
 round the farm. When I came in I had a
 bath. After my bath my Mum and Dad    
 came up to the sitting-room and we all
 watched television together.          
   At 9.30pm I went to bed _ the end of
 a lovely day!
