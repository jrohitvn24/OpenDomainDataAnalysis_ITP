		<content>    Housing styles are very mixed,     
 varying from traditional houses and   
 cottages over 200 years old,to        
 modern bungalows less than a year.    
 Property is both privately and council
 owned.Many of the older cottages have 
 been extended with an extra storey at 
 the back, but preserving the original 
 frontage.                             
    Every house has its garden and     
 householders take great pride in      
 maintaining them. In 1981 Dalry was   
 voted the best kept Scottish village  
 in 'The Britain in Bloom' competition.
    The columns of smoke rising from   
 chimneys at dusk testify to the       
 widespread use of coal, peat and wood 
 for heating. Oil, bottled gas and     
 electicity are also used for both     
 heating and cooking.                  
    Most households now have cars and  
 street parking is widespread.         </content>
