		<title>14The Manse Wood, Tongue</title>
		<content> 'We don't have many trees in Tongue,  
 but there is a small wood beside the  
 school and we went there one after    
 noon to see how many different kinds  
 of trees there were. We found nine    
 different kinds, birch, hawthorn, ash 
 larch,elm, beech, rowan, alder, white 
 beam. We measured their girths and    
 found the elm and the beech had the   
 biggest girths. There were quite a lot
 of beech and elmtrees, but there was  
 only one white beam. The big beech    
 trees had been planted years ago, but 
 a lot of the small trees had just     
 seeded themselves.'
