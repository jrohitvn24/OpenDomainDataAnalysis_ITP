		<title>18SATURDAY IN NEWTON MEARNS</title>
		<content>      Each Saturday morning people tend
 to get up from their beds at a later  
 time because they have no work or     
 school to attend. Children get up     
 earlier than adults and watch         
 television while the adults lie in    
 bed. By late morning, after they have 
 eaten, the adults go to their various 
 activities. These include gardening,  
 occasional shopping, going driving or 
 playing sports. Children play with    
 their friends, do sport, or go to     
 watch professional football matches.  
      At night many people go into the 
 busy town for a meal in a restaurant  
 or stay in with the children and then 
 watch television or a video recording.
 Younger adults go out for a drink or  
 to the cinema and all retire to bed at
 a later time than usual.
