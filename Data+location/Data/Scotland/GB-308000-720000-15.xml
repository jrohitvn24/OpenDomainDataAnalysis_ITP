		<content>  Five of us went to the big{D.I.Y.    
{store}in{Glenearn  Road}and it was    
 great fun. The manager showed us round
 the store and then answered all our   
 questions. He was patient. People do  
 work on their houses by themselves as 
 it is cheaper than using tradesmen.   
  There are{16 000 different items}for 
 sale. They have tools for all sorts of
 jobs and materials for tackling most  
 things in a home.                     
  There are{thirty employees}there and 
 the {shop}is{open  seven  days a week,
 except  for  Christmas. They are very 
 busy on{Sundays}when most people have 
 time  to shop. The manager  said that 
 they had got{busier}from{passing trade
 since{Tesco's}had opened on a{Sunday. 
 The shop sells furniture in kits and  
 electrical goods such as drills and   
 lawn mowers.{Texas Homecare}has       
 branches all over Britain.            </content>
