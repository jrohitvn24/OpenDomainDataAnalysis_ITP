		<title>17Changes in Durris</title>
		<content> There have been quite a few changes   
 round here in the past twenty five    
 years or so,although the landscape    
 itself has not altered much.          
 Agriculture,which is still important, 
 has changed because of the ammount of 
 machines that are now used.There are  
 fewer farmworkers now,and crops like  
 oil seed rape have replaced others.   
 Many more people travel to work in    
 Aberdeen,partly because of the oil    
 boom,and it has also meant more       
 houses being built,and new people     
 moving in.The old estate house has    
 been made into flats.Transport has    
 changed too.There are hardly any      
 buses,and the Deeside railway has     
 closed.Everybody relies on the car    
 now.This in turn has led to the       
 closure of the two local shops,but the
 school has more pupils now and has had
 an extension built on to it.          </content>
