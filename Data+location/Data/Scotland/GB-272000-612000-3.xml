		<content> Kirkconnel and  Kelloholm (which lies 
 in the adjacent block) cannot be      
 separated since the latter is an      
 expansion of Kirkconnel.              
 Census 1981 Pop. 2851                 
 L.A. and Housing Assoc. housing 857   
 Private housing                 80    
 Registrar stats. 1984                 
 Births 35 Deaths 32 Marriages 18      
 Over the 16yrs. since Fauldhead       
 colliery closed and the subsequent    
 closure of the other small mining     
 operations in the area the pop. has   
 fallen from around 5000 to its present
 level which if current trends are     
 maintained, is likely to prevail.     
 The former N.C.B. houses of Kellobank 
  are rapidly being bought and         
 renovated by young couples.This is an 
 encouraging development. Employment is
 stable but no growth is forseen.
