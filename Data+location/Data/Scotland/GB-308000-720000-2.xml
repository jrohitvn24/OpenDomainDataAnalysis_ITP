		<title>02Carla Meets Prime Minister.</title>
		<content> On 10.5.85  I  was told the exciting  
 news - Iwas to meet  the {first lady  
{Prime Minister.}I dressed in my Junior
 Red Cross uniform; navy skirt , white 
 blouse  and  red tie . On  the blouse 
 sleeves there is  a{Red Cross }symbol 
 and the letters Perth and Kinross. At 
 the City Hall a security man came with
 a photographer to take my photo for an
{Identification  Card,}then  I was sent
 home but I was  not  allowed to go to 
 school for{security reasons.}I return-
 ed at 6.25 p.m., showed  my  pass  and
 was searched . Finally {Mrs. Thatcher}
 arrived. She put money in my collect- 
 ion box. I put a sticker on her black 
 dress. Mr.Thatcher refused one so the 
{P.M.}wore his too. Later I saw her on 
 T.V. making her speech at the Scottish
 Conservative Party Conference, still  
 wearing the two stickers I had given  
 her. What a thrill it was!            </content>
