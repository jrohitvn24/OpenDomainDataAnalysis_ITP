		<title>13Churches in Evie</title>
		<content>   There are sites of several previous 
 churches in this area, but the Old    
 Church,which is now used as a bus     
 garage, was built on the geographical 
 centre of the parish.  Families walked
 over the fields and hills to a noonday
 service, taking their lunch with them,
 so that they could stay on for an     
 evening service.                      
   The present church, built in 1897 as
 a United Free Church, is now Church of
 Scotland. The minister preaches once a
 Sunday and also serves churches in two
 other parishes. There are just over   
 100 communicant members, but the      
 average Sunday attendance for worship 
 is about 35. The building is bright   
 and cared for. Music is provided by an
 electric 2-manual organ. Organisations
 consist of the Sunday School and      
 Women's Guild. The church is still    
 seen as a basic part of the community.</content>
