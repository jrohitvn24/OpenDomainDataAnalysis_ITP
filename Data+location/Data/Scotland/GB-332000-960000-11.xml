 The Post Office is run in a building  
 which was a garage half way along the 
 High Street.   In addition to posting 
 mail, it offers other services like   
 paying Pensions, Child Benefit, and   
 Girobank.  Even Railcards for cheaper 
 railfares may be purchased here.      
   Because it is a focal point in the  
 community{notices about events}are    
 posted up there, and there is always  
 someone to talk to about{village news.
  {Mail}is delivered to homes from     
 about 1pm.  The mail from the south is
 brought to Wick on the morning train, 
 and brought to the village by road    
 just before mid-day.  The time mail is
 delivered to homes may vary because   
 weather conditions can affect the     
 arrival of the train in Wick.  On some
 occassions bad weather will mean no   
 mail from the south.                  </content>
