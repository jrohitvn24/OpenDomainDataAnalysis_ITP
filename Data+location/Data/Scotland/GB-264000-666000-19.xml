		<title>19PROVAN HALL</title>
		<content>   Formerly known as Hall Mailing,     
{Provan Hall}is situated in the        
 recently developed Auchinlea Park.    
 The present house, thought to date    
 from the{1470's,}provided a country   
 seat for successive Prebendies of     
 Glasgow Cathedral. (A Prebend or Canon
 was the official of the Cathedral.    
 Provan is a corruption of Prebend.)   
                                       
    The House, now in the care of the  
{National Trust,}has been described as 
 perhaps one of the most perfect       
 examples remaining in Scotland of the 
 simple Monkish houses of the          
 pre-Reformation times.                
                                       
    Unfortunately, Provan Hall is      
 rarely opened to the public and the   
 Parks Department use the building to  
 store their grass mowers and other    
 gardening equipment.                  </content>
