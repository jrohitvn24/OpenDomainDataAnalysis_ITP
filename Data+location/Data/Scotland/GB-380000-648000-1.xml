		<content> This block is entirely agricultural;  
 six farms cultivating prime arable    
 land on which barley, oil seed rape   
 and potatos are the main crops.       
 Cattle and sheep graze rotational     
 grass.                                
 The only settlement is the hamlet of  
 Sinclairs Hill - Square 2 - which     
 contains 12 houses and a disused      
 school.  All the farms have a row of  
 from six to eight cottages, half of   
 which are no longer used for farm     
 employees and are now either disused  
 or let as holiday cottages. Squares 1,
 5 and 9 are crossed by the giant      
 pylons taking electricity to the      
 National Grid from Torness nuclear    
 power station, due to open in 1987.   
 The pylons were being erected during  
 this survey.
