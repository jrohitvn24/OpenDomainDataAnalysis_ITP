		<title>14WESTFIELD MINE : MARKETS</title>
		<content> One of the main reasons that Westfield
 Pit was developed in 1955 was as a    
 supplier of{coal to power stations for
{the generation of electricity.        
 The coal is processed on site in the  
 coal preparation plant, where it is   
 washed  and certain impurities are    
 removed.                              
 The processed{coal of high quality}is 
 sent to the coal-fired power station  
 at{Longannet}and the{poorer quality   
 coal waste from the preparation plant 
 is sent to the power station at       
{Methil.}The remaining coal is         
 available for distribution by coal    
 retailers.                            
 The coal which goes to{Longannet}is   
 carried by{rail}using the             
 'merry-go-round' system - the coal    
 going to{Methil}is carried by{lorry}  
 which brings about traffic congestion 
 as these lorries travel fairly slowly.</content>
