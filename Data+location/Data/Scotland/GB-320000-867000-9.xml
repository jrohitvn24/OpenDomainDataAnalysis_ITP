		<title>09SCOUT HALL LOSSIEMOUTH</title>
		<content>   Building started on the new scout   
 hall at the beginning of 1985 and was 
 finished in Easter 1985. It was opened
 on the 6th of April by Councillor     
 Hossack. The old scout hall was in a  
 bad state of repair which was why a   
 new hall was built.                   
   The money came from jumble sales and
 other fund raising activities. The    
 scouts raised thirteen thousand pounds
 and they got a grant of thirty-nine   
 thousand pounds from Moray District   
 Council.                              
   The facilities that are in the hall 
 include a kitchen, toilets, 2 stores  
 and an office. The hut is used by 18  
 scouts, also cubs and Venture Scouts. 
   The scouts think the hall is good   
 but dampness is getting in already and
 damaging the walls, making them       
 mouldy.
