		<title>16GOURDIE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content> The South East Kilometre of our block 
 consists mainly of the Gourdie        
 Industrial Estate although there is a 
 small farmstead called Gourdie        
 Cottages.This land has been taken over
 by the Milnfield Research Group who   
 are experimenting with different      
 crops.                                
 The Industrial Estate is dominated by 
 the world renown National Cash        
 Register Company which specializes in 
 Electronic machines,Cash Registers and
 Banking Terminals. The"Cash"came to   
 Dundee shortly after the second world 
 war and at one time in the late 60's  
 was Dundee's largest employer with    
 over 6000 employees. The advent of    
 electronics as opposed to mechanical  
 production however meant a reduction  
 in the workforce and they now employ  
 only 1000 people.
