		<content> In 1984/85 the school roll was 15 and 
 with political pressure to close rural
 schools, the school was threatened.   
 The community attended in full force a
 meeting with the Director and the     
 School Council and displayed very     
 strong feelings about the high        
 standard of education in the school   
 which later gained an unconditional   
 reprieve.The school has again a       
 permanent Headteacher with 1 assistant
 and 19 pupils.                        
 The school was built in 1666. The     
 schoolhouse was added in 1706 and the 
 playground was provided in 1870. The  
 roll in 1850 was as small as 3 and has
 reached 60 plus at other times.Now the
 school caters for children aged 5 to  
 12 years whereas it used to range to  
 14 years. Today children are busy in  
 activity corners which are scattered  
 around one large classroom.           </content>
