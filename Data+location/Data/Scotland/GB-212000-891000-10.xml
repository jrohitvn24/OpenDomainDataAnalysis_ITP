		<title>10A CHILD LOOKS AT ULLAPOOL.</title>
		<content> The landscape in and around Ullapool  
 is very beautiful indeed and Loch     
 Broom is pretty and usually calm but  
 can be rough and extremely fierce when
 there is a storm.                     
 There is not much flat land around    
 Ullapool, only that by the sea and by 
 the banks of the river.               
 Surrounding Ullapool are hills,rough- 
 grazing, fields,forests,rivers and    
 mountains.                            
 The hills are covered with heather,   
 brown in winter and deep purple in    
 late summer.                          
 On clear,still,sunny days the hills   
 are reflected in the waters of the    
 loch.                                 
 In winter the river sometimes freezes 
 over and in some places the ice is    
 strong enough for ice-skating.In      
 summer it is sometimes warm enough to 
 swim in.                              </content>
