		<content> Portobello became a{holiday resort}for
 Edinburgh families in the 18th and    
 19th centuries when{seabathing}became 
 fashionable. Even around 1960 "Porty" 
 was still being described as          
{"Edinburgh's bracing holiday resort." 
  Today, although no longer a major    
 resort, Portobello retains something  
 of a resort character, with many guest
 houses and small hotels, bars, public 
 parks and{promenade}with its{amusement
{centres}and summer entertainment.     
  Unfortunately many seafront buildings
 have been neglected but some amenities
 have been improved e.g. the{beach}is  
 the subject of continuous treatment to
 maintain sand levels and the seawater 
 is cleaner for{water sports}since the 
 Seafield sewage works opened. However 
 in an age of mass international       
 tourism it is unlikely that Portobello
 could return to past glories.         </content>
