		<title>03The land behind Carlingwark</title>
		<content> The land behind Carlingwark House is  
 made up of marsh and bog holes. Round 
 about Carlingwark are a lot of little 
 streams running through.              
 There is a wood next to one of the    
 fields. There is a stream that looks  
 like the letter T.                    
 Many have fences beside them, which   
 you have to climb to get over when you
 want to cross the water.              
 There is a lot of long grass and a few
 trees in the fields. Most of them are 
 crooked with branches sticking out    
 over the place. There are very few    
 hills but most are flat with bumps.   
 The streams have a few stones and old 
 bits of twigs in them.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
