		<title>17A TYPICAL SUNDAY - MICHAEL</title>
		<content> My name is Michael and I am 10 years  
 old. 0n a usual Sunday I wake up at   
 8am, wash and get dressed. I read the 
 'Sunday Post', then for breakfast I   
 have cereal and toast. At 8.30am I    
 pack my football bag. I wake my mum   
 and dad up at 8.45 and then they wash,
 dress and have breakfast. They take me
 in the car to a football game. We play
 for 1 hour, then come home. I have a  
 bath and wash my hair before lunch.   
 Often my brother and I go for a game  
 of golf. I have a rest when we come   
 home about 4pm. Half an hour later I  
 watch{Scotsport}on television. This is
 football, boxing, golf and all        
 different sports. I have tea, then go 
 out with my friends about 6.30pm to   
 play football up the hill. About      
 8.30pm I come in, get my pyjamas on   
 and have some cereal and an apple for 
 supper. At 9pm I go upstairs to bed.  </content>
