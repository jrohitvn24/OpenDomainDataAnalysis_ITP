 I am off school.I got dressed.I went  
 into Aberdeen with my Mum to get a    
 Fathers Day present.I went to get some
 breakfast in a cafe.My Mum went to get
 food for our guests coming.I went to  
 get my Fathers Day present while my   
 Mum went shopping.                    
 I went and got my hair washed for the 
 Sunday School trip at Haddo House.I   
 had soup for my lunch.I went in the   
 car to Wendy's house.Wendy and I did  
 handstands and played football.There  
 was races but we didn't win.Wendy is  
 my best friend.                       
 Wendy bought her Dad a Fathers Day    
 present.We had tea there,then went    
 home. When I got home our guests had  
 arrived.I put the camp bed in my      
 sisters room. We talked and giggled   
 and in the end went to sleep.         
 It had been an enjoyable day.         </content>
