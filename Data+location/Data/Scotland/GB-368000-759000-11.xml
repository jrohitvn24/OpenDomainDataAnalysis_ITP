		<title>11Farming around Montrose.</title>
		<content> There are both{dairy and arable farms 
 in the Montrose and Hillside area     
 although the land is predominantly    
 used for growing crops. Some farms    
 also rear cattle for fattening. Crops 
 grown in our area are barley, wheat,  
 potatoes, turnips,raspberries         
 carrots, rye, peas, beans, calabrese, 
 kale, grass and{oil seed rape}which,  
 as a recent crop, has changed the     
 landscape to iclude bright yellow in  
 an otherwise green patchwork. Economic
 factors have encouraged farmers to    
 look to alternative crop types and    
 markets. Farming does not employ many 
 people most farms being run by their  
 owners although seasonal work is      
 available at berry, carrot, and       
{"tattie"}time. Tayock and Gilrivie    
 Farms,owned by Roy Middleton, produce 
 an average of 7,300 litres of milk per
 week. Some sheep are kept at Langley. </content>
