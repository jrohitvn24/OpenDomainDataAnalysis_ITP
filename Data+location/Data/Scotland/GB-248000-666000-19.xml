		<title>19LIVING IN RENFREW</title>
		<content> Here are some quotes about life in    
 Renfrew from schoolchildren.          
{Anne Taylor: "At night I go to the    
{Roberson Park. But that shuts when it 
{gets dark so you can't stay there very
{long. In the park there really isn't  
{anything to do but it keeps you out of
{trouble. If you stand about the       
{streets, someone will phone the police
{and we will get moved on, so really   
{the park is the best place to be."    
 Deborah Vernal: "My Mum is very fair  
 with me. I can talk to her about      
 anything, but my Dad doesn't let me do
 anything and worries all the time. He 
 hates me going to discos or parties or
 going out with boys."                 
{Richard Crighton: Tuesdays and Fridays
{my Mum is at work so I let myself in. 
{Mum makes the dinner when she comes in
{and I usually read a book or make     
{model. There is nothing to do here."  </content>
