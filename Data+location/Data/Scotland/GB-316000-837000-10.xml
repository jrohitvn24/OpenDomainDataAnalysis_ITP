		<title>10PAST BALLINDALLOCH SCHOOLS</title>
		<content> Since the very first school in the    
 area was built in the 17th century in 
 what is now the churchyard ("a black  
 bigging"of mud and turf divots)there  
 have been many changes and additions. 
 In 1818 the Heritors of the Parish of 
 Inveravon decided to erect another    
 building to accommodate both the      
 school and school-master's dwelling on
 the hillside above the church.Many    
 people at the time protested at the   
 site chosen as they said it was "being
 built on a bog".Later there was built 
 another school,which had, to begin    
 with, only one large room.About 1911  
 two other rooms were added.At this    
 school pupils were taught up to       
 Secondary level and had about 90      
 pupils.Since then it has had several  
 extensions to bring it up to modern   
 standards as the present Primary      
 school.                               </content>
