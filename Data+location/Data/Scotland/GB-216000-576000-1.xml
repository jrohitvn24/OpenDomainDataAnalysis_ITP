		<title>01Arcleoch Forest South West</title>
		<content> This is the original or oldest part of
 the forest.   The trees planted date  
 from 1958 to 1970.   This area also   
 contains the highest land thoughout   
 the whole forest and is planted mainly
 with Sitka Spruce imported from Queen 
 Charlotte Islands Western America.    
 Arecleoch House original and new      
 stands within the forest arera and the
 forest is named after the old         
 Arecleoch Farm and estate.   The      
 ground which is not afforested is     
 rough open hill grazing belonging to  
 Chirmorie Farm lying SE from Arecleoch
 House.   This area is also disected by
 the main Glasgow-Stranraer Railway    
 line.   The whole area could be       
 classed as glacial upland moor the    
 main soil type being peaty gley.  This
 makes the tree crop very unstable due 
 to wind.
