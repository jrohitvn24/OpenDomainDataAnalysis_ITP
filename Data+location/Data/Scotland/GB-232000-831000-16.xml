		<content> Organised{shinty}originated in        
 Strathglass and Strathglass shinty    
 club is the oldest club.  The Shinty  
 Centenary was held in 1980. Cannich   
 has a very active{Indoor Bowling}Club 
 which attracts members both young and 
 old and lively matches are played     
 against neighbouring clubs. A         
{Badminton Club}is also run during the 
 winter months and there is a{Football 
 club who use the playing field in the 
 village regularly. The bar in the     
{hotel}has a pool table and darts can  
 also be played in the hotel.          
                                       
 Considering the area is so far from   
 the nearest main city, the{recreation 
 facilities are reasonably good and    
 possibly more than adequate for such a
 small population.
