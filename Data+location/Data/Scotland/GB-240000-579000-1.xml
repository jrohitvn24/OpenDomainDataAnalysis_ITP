		<content> Loch Trool extends for 3km up the Glen
 of Trool.  It is surrounded by hills, 
 mainly forested by coniferous         
 plantations.  Loch Trool is owned by  
 Lord Grantchester, who has a          
 residence, Glen Trool Lodge, on the   
 north shore.  On the NE shore of Loch 
 Trool, where it enters the Waters of  
 Trool is a large Forestry Commission  
 campsite 'Caldons', popular with      
 walkers.  A Forest Trail around the   
 Loch and a Forest Trail to the south  
 have been waymarked.  The ascent of   
 'Merrick' - at 843m, the highest peak 
 in the Southern Uplands - begins near 
 Buchan Farm.  A memorial 'Bruce's     
 Stone' by the road between Glen Trool 
 Lodge and Buchan records the ambush of
 an English army on the southern shore 
 opposite, by Robert the Bruce in 1307.
