		<content>   ST ABBS HARBOUR.   THE FIRST HARBOUR
 IN ST ABBS WAS BUILT IN 1833 . IT WAS 
 QUITE SMALL AND THERE WAS NO          
 BREAKWATER TO PROTECT THE BOATS FROM  
 THE FIERCE NORTH EAST GALES WHICH BLOW
 CONSTANTLY ON THIS PART OF THE COAST. 
 IN 1890  , SIR ANDREW USHER , WHO HAD 
 COME TO LIVE IN ST ABBS GAVE MONEY  TO
 THE PEOPLE OF ST ABBS TO BUILD A NEW  
 HARBOUR .THIS WAS DONE BY ENLARGING   
 THE ORIGINAL HARBOUR .BOATS CALLED    
 PUFFERS'USED TO COME AND LAND COAL    
     . THE HARBOUR WAS ALSO USED BY    
 DRIFTERS , WHICH HAD BIG SAILS AND .  
 FISHED FOR HERRING. THERE WERE BOOM   
 GATES AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE          
 HARBOUR AND THESE WERE LOWERED,IN     
 STORMY WEATHER TO PROTECT THE FISHING 
 BOATS.TODAY THE  BOOM GATES ARE GONE  
 AND ALL THE BOATS ARE DRIVEN BY       
 DIESEL. THERE ARE ONLY 4 TRAWL BOAT   
 AND 6 INSHORE LOBSTER AND CRAB BOATS. </content>
