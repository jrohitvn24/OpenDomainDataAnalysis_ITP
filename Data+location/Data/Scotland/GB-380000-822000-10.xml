		<content> While towns on the outer edges of the 
 parish of Bourtie has contined to row 
 with the advent of new industry in    
 berdeenshire, Boutie itself has       
 remained isolated and loyal to its    
 farming traditions.  Most households, 
 if not wholly occupied in farming     
 crops and rearing animals, have some  
 connection with the land, such as     
 organic gardening, smallholding and   
 horse breeding.  There are several    
 households with free-range ducks,     
 geese and hens. the community is      
 served by a daily postal delivery, a  
 weekly waste disposal run, and,       
 because most residents have individual
 septic tanks, gordon district Water   
 Services provides a service to syphon 
 and remove sewage once every two      
 years. If the septic tank overflows in
 the intervening period a charge is    
 levvied of Â£30.                       </content>
