		<content> Maryculter Church is the parish Church
 of Scotland. The present building     
 dates from 1787 and contains          
 interesting old box pews and a fine   
 glass picture. The Church was enlarged
 in 1882 by an organ transept. A hall  
 and kitchen facilities were added in  
 1963.It is linked with Banchory-      
 Devenick and Cookney. There are       
 between 270-310 members. In addition  
 to the Sunday services a Bible Study  
 is held mid-week and a group called   
 Quest has recently been started by    
 Rev. David Simpson for teenagers.     
 There are 71 Roman Catholics in the   
 area who meet in the Chapel of nearby 
 Blairs College. A member of the       
 College Staff acts as part-time       
 priest. The Steiner foundation at     
 Camphill is Theosophist.
