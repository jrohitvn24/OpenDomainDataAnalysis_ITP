		<title>11PETERHEAD POWER STATION</title>
		<content> Peterhead Power Station was started in
 1973 and finished by 1980.It was built
 because of the amount of people coming
 to this area finding jobs in the oil  
 industry.The station's 170 metres high
 chimney makes an unusual impression on
 the landscape and can be seen from a  
 great distance.Oil is pumped through  
 an underground pipeline,starting at   
 the Harbour of Refuge and going       
 straight to the 3 storage tanks at the
 station.From there the oil goes to the
 boiler,where it helps to bring the    
 water to boiling point.The steam      
 produced goes to the turbine which    
 drives a generator,producing          
 electricity.The electricity goes to a 
 transformer,before going onto the     
 National Grid system.
