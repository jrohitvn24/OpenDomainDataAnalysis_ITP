		<content>   If you take a walk,or a drive along 
 Harbour Road you will see to your left
 a company of which my father is the   
 Assistant Production Manager.It is a  
 meat company called 'Swifts' because  
 of the founders surname.Their marginal
 profits are low at the moment but I   
 have been told they will improve in   
 the near future. From one of the      
 offices in the building you can see   
 all the commotion of the workers whose
 job it is to cut, pack,store and put  
 the meat in the several chillers,which
 keep the meat fresh until use.There   
 is a company which recently took over 
 'Swifts', it is a multinational       
 corporation which has many diverse    
 interests.
