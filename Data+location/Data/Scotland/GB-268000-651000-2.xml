		<title>02Mining in SW Hamilton</title>
		<content>   For many years Hamilton was heavily 
 dependant on coal mining and the Duke 
 derived a lot of revenue from it.     
 After 1850 various companies leased   
 the miners and developed them further 
 by sinking shafts well outside        
 Hamilton.                             
{COLLIERY CLOSURES                     
   The Collieries in our area were     
 abandoned before the war with Earnock 
 and Eddlewood Pits closing in 1932 and
 Cadzow in 1937. Mining switched to the
 lower parts of the seams beside the   
 Clyde and was finally closed in 1950. 
{EFFECTS OF COLLIERY CLOSURES          
{  }The first effect was the transfer  
 of workers to Fife. However, the loss 
 of employment in the area has not been
 made up by newer industries.          
   The local authority then had the    
 opportunity to demolish the{miners'   
{rows }and rehouse their tenants.      </content>
