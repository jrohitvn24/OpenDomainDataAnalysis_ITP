		<content> THE POPULAR VIEW OF THE EATING HABITS 
 OF THE SCOTS IS THAT THEY EAT A LOT OF
 PORRIDGE.A RECENT SURVEY ON DIET      
 CARRIED OUT IN GOUROCK REVEALED A VERY
 DIFFERENT PICTURE.FOR BREAKFAST MOST  
 PEOPLE ATE BACON AND EGGS OR BREAKFAST
 CEREALS SUCH AS CORN FLAKES.HARDLY    
 ANYONE ATE PORRIDGE.                  
   MANY LOCAL PEOPLE ARE BECOMING  MUCH
 MORE HEALTH CONSCIOUS AND SEEM TO HAVE
 A GOOD IDEA  ABOUT WHAT FOODS ARE GOOD
 OR BAD FOR YOU.MANY PEOPLE NOW TRY TO 
 EAT MORE ROUGHAGE-FOR EXAMPLE FOODS   
 LIKE BRAN FLAKES-AND LESS FATTENING   
 FOODS.
