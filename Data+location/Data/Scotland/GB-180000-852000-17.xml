		<content>    MY DAD IS IN THE TORRIDON AND      
 KINLOCHEWE MOUNTAIN RESCUE TEAM.      
 THEY WORK IN THE MOUNTAINS AROUND     
 TORRIDON AND KINLOCHEWE.              
    THERE ARE ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE IN   
 THE TEAM AND THEY ARE CALLED OUT ON   
 AVERAGE SIX TIMES PER YEAR.   THEY    
 HAVE TO KNOW THE MOUNTAINS,  ROPEWORK 
 AND FIRST-AID.   THEY ARE USUALLY     
 CALLED OUT AROUND FOUR OR FIVE P.M.   
    THEY DO MOST OF THEIR TRAINING     
 AROUND SHIELDAIG.   THEY TRAIN ON     
 SATURDAYS MOSTLY AND SOMETIMES GO TO  
 GLENMORE LODGE FOR A WEEK.            
    AS THERE ARE MANY MOUNTAINS IN THIS
 AREA A MOUNTAIN RESCUE TEAM IS        
 ESSENTIAL.   MANY CLIMBERS COME AT ALL
 TIMES OF THE YEAR TO ENJOY CLIMBING   
 AND THE GLORIOUS VIEWS OF THE AREA.   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
