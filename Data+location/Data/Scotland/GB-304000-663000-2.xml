		<content> During the 1850's shale mining was the
 chief industry in this area. The man  
 who brought this boom was{James       
{'Paraffin'Young.}The oil was extracted
 from the shale by burning it in a     
 vessel called a retort. The natural   
 black colour changed during the       
 process to the pink we see today. The 
 importance of{Contentibus}is that this
 landmark will soon disappear. The     
 waste material is sold to W.H. Malcolm
 who use it as part of the foundation  
 in road making. The waste is also used
 in brick making. Lothian Region       
 Derelict Land Rehabilitation Unit are 
 responsible for this bing and when it 
 is level will use the land for the    
 development of the town. At present   
 the bing is used by motor bike        
 scramblers. This however is an        
 unofficial use.{
