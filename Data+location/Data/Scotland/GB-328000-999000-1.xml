		<title>01Hoy, Lyrawa Hill</title>
		<content> This area of Hoy is on the East side  
 overlooking Scapa Flow. Lyrawa Hill   
 is about 100 mtrs high and covered    
 with heather and peat.  There is a    
 small holding on the north side which 
 is intensively farmed grassland.      
 By the roadside on top of Lyrawa Hill 
 is the solitary grave of Betty        
 Corrigall. She committed suicide in   
 the 19th centur. As neither parish    
 would bury her she was buried on the  
 parish boundary.  She was preserved in
 the peat soil and was accidentally dug
 up several times during world war two.
 Afterwards her grave was marked by a  
 gravestone. Many tourists visit the   
 grave. About 1 1/2 kilometers off     
 Green Head. Underwater, lie several   
 wrecks of the German Navyy (The       
 Karlsruhe, Hindenberg) which were     
 scuttled after world war one in Scapa 
 Flow.                                 </content>
