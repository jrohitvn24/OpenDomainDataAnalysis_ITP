		<title>10Another Day Again</title>
		<content> She woke up  gradually with the sound 
 of her mother's voice telling her to  
 get out of bed and get ready for      
 school.Out of bed she stumbled and    
 wriggled her toes about to try and    
 find her slippers.She went off to get 
 dressed in her school uniform.After   
 breakfast of cornflakes,toast and     
 pineapple juice she played her        
 computer for thirty minutes.She then  
 collected her school things and went  
 off but forgot to take her new digital
 watch.School lasted till half past    
 three and after changing into her     
 jeans and jumper she got out her      
 roller_skates to play around in an    
 unused car park.Dinner was at five    
 o'clock and afterwards she played     
 chases with her pals for a couple     
 of hours.She then went home exhausted 
 for a supper of tea and a meat        
 sandwich                              </content>
