 is SCOTLAND'S{SIXTH}largest town and  
 has been planned and built around a   
 village of 2400 inhabitants by a

 1947.The population is now about 75000
 Our specific block lies to the N.E. of
 the town centre and is linked to the  
 neighbouring town of Hamilton and M74 
 by a new Expressway built with funds  
 from the{E.E.C.}Half of our area is   
 residential and half farmland with the
{Calderglen Country Park}bridging the  
 gap between the two.The Rotten Calder 
 river flows through the park and later
 joins the famous River Clyde.         
 A profitable community of industry and
 housing,shops and offices,schools and 
 social amenities has now developed.   </content>
