		<content> Skibo Castle and its estate, until    
 recently including Clashmore and      
 Clashmore Woods, donimate here. The   
 castle is just S of the A9 but not    
 visible from the road which runs W to 
 E across the middle of the block. On  
 this road is Clashmore, an attractive 
 late 18th C. village with many fine   
 old trees; it was built when the woods
 to the N were planted by a former     
 proprietor of Skibo. The castle, much 
 enlarged around 1900 by Andrew        
 Carnegie, stands on an escarpment     
 looking S over parkland to the Dornoch
 Firth and hills beyond. Below it are  
 Loch Ospisdale, a fishing loch, and   
 Loch Skibo, an arm of the Dornoch     
 Firth, where sea trout and salmon com 
 in to the mouth of the River Evelix.  
 Ospreys nest here.
