 In planning the new town of East      
 Kilbride, access roads and major      
 roads were carefully planned.For      
 the pedestrian,there are roads leading
 to underpasses for safe walking to    
 town centre or neighbourhood shops.   
 Major roads link the main sections of 
 the town and provide through routes to
 10 motorways in all directions.Road 11
 junctions are large roundabouts where 
 pedestrians and cyclists use under    
 passes for safety.Major roads provide 
 direct routes to Glasgow taking 20    
 minutes by car or 40 minutes by       
 regular bus services.Edinburgh,about  
 an hour's car ride, is reached by     
 the M8. motorway.Glasgow airport is 40
 minutes on the A77.The M74 takes one  
 South to England.
