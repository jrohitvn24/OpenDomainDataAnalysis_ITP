		<title>17HOUSING IN DALBEATTIE</title>
		<content> Before granite was discovered locally 
 the houses in Dalbeattie were made    
 from stone and brick.There is one of  
 these houses in the High Street with  
 the date shown on the wall.It says,   
 "Hugh McGeorge built this in 1781".   
  When granite was discovered it was   
 used for terraced houses in many of   
 the streets.In time granite  became   
 too expensive for this.Council housing
 schemes were built of cheaper material
 like brick, with a roughcast finish,  
 four homes to a block and two storeys 
 high.Many of these houses are now     
 being bought by the tenants from the  
 Stewartry District Council.           
  Private housing developments sprang  
 up in more recent years on the        
 outskirts of the town with detached   
 and semi-detached houses,some         
 bungalows and some of two storeys.
