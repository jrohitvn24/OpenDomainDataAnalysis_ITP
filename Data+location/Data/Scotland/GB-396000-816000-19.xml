		<title>19FARMING IN BALMEDIE</title>
		<content> Mr Christie who is a local farmer owns
 a field in our area, which is         
 surrounded by trees like many other   
 fields in the area we are studying.In 
 Mr Christie's field he grows winter   
 barley. There is a croft by the name  
 of Drumhead Croft. The owners have a  
 small acreage of land and keep a small
 number of cattle and sheep. Their land
 is slightly hilly and is good for     
 growing grass. In Balmedie there is   
 Eigie Farm they do not use it for     
 farming any more. It has an old       
 farmhouse which is now a ruin. There  
 are many fields around it with cattle 
 and sheep. Most of the other farmlands
 in our area are either rotational     
 grasslands or cereal crops. Down      
 towards the sand-dunes there is rough 
 grazing for the cattle and sheep.
