		<title>08Entertainment in Shawlands</title>
		<content> To walk through Shawlands is like     
 walking through a glutton's           
 paradise.The choice of food is very   
 cosmopolitan with Greek, Italian,     
 Indian and Chinese cuisine to tempt   
 the diner.  These premises provide sit
 down and carryout facilities. At night
 the area around Shawlands is busy with
 people bringing custom to the many    
 public bars and lounges. The abundance
 of these premises has its roots in the
 past when surrounding areas eg,       
 Battlefield,Cathcart and Mount Florida
 were 'dry areas' ie no alcohol was    
 sold. However this has changed in     
 recent years and now public bars are  
 springing up in these areas. Apart    
 from food and drink, places of        
 entertainment are limited.  The main  
 amusements are snooker clubs, bingo   
 halls and for those who enjoy outdoor 
 pursuits, cricket,tennis and bowling. </content>
