		<title>19Trade in Dalkeith</title>
		<content> Dalkeith enjoys a wide range of       
 shopping facilities in keeping with a 
 town which had an important position  
 as a market town.                     
 The only remnant of this tradition is 
 the weekly livestock market held in   
 Ironmills Park on Mondays. There is   
 also a trading standards office       
 situated in Ironmills Park.           
 The main shopping area of the town is 
 in and around the High Street. Most of
 the major chain stores are represented
 including Boots, William Low,         
 Woolworths and the Co-op. Dalkeith    
 also has a modern shopping precinct,  
 named Jarnac Court in commemoration of
 Dalkeith's twin town in France.       
 There is also a good selection of     
 locally owned stores situated in the  
 town centre. Dalkeith also has a main 
 Post Office and branch offices of the 
 Gas and Electricity boards.           </content>
