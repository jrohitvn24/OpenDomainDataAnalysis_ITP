		<content> THESE SHOPS ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO PROVIDE
 YOU WITH SOME MESSAGES BUT MOST OF THE
 SHOPPING IS DONE AT THE TOWN          
 CENTRE.THERE IS A BUS STOP AT THE     
 BOTTOM OF THE HILL WHICH IS 5 MINUTES 
 WALK FROM MY HOUSE. MOST OF THE BUSES 
 GO TO THE TOWN CENTRE, NORTH CARBRAIN 
 OR GLASGOW. I LIKE THE HOUSES BECAUSE 
 THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM IN THEM AND    
 THERE IS A LOT TO DO NEARBY. THE      
 HOUSES ALSO HAVE BACK AND FRONT       
 GARDENS. I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT MY   
 AREA. I DONT DISLIKE ANYTHING. I WOULD
 HATE TO LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE.
