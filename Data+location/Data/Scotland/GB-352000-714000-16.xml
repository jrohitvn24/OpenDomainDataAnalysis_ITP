		<title>16FARMING : Livestock</title>
		<content> On the farm,cultivated crops are grown
 as the soil is grade 1 and very       
 suitable for arable farming.However,  
 there is still livestock as during the
 winter the farmer buys in cattle from 
 the local market.On average 250 are   
 bought in to be fattened up during the
 winter and sold again in the spring.  
 The cattle are kept inside during the 
 winter and fed on grain and hayledge  
 grown on the land.The farm also has   
 170 breeding sheep which are          
 constantly on the farm.Their lambs,   
 when born in the spring,are all taken 
 and sold at the market.The highest    
 price for them is in May at the       
 beginning of the season,but the price 
 gradually drops as more lambs become  
 available.All the lambing takes place 
 indoors over a period of 4 weeks and  
 needs constant attention.
