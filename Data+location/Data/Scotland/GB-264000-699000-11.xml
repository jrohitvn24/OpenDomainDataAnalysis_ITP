 Thornhill has no newspaper of its own 
 because the village is very small.The 
 newspaper that gets nearest to a local
 one is the "Stirling Observer".The    
 "Observer"is published twice a week.On
 Wednesday there is the town           
 edition.The country edition is read in
 the village more than the town one.The
 country edition carries much the same 
 general news but all the villages in  
 the district have their own           
 "spot".Mrs.Carr is our local          
 correspondent and sends in the news   
 each week.Anything of interest in the 
 village is reported and notices are   
 also sent out in this way.Ifthere is  
 something very important for the      
 readers there is usually a picture.Our
 headteacher sends in school news which
 she knows people will enjoy reading   
 about.                                </content>
