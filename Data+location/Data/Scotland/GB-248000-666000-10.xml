		<content> Renfrew has a variety of forms of     
 religious worship available. Like most
 of Scotland the main church is the    
 Church of Scotland. Renfrew has 3: Old
 Parish, North and Trinity. North      
 Church is distinguished by having as  
 its minister Lorna Hood one of the few
 but increasing number of women        
 ministers. Church attendance is above 
 average and most people have some     
 church connection. About 16% of the   
 population is Roman Catholic catered  
 for by its own school and 2 churches. 
 There is a strong local membership of 
 the Orange Lodge but this does not    
 result in sectarianism within Renfrew.
 There are also  Episcopalian, Baptist,
 Salvation Army and Jehovah's Witness  
 churches in the town.
