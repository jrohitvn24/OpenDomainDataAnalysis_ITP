		<title>11Hallowe'en at Kylesku</title>
		<content>  The 31st of October is an exciting   
 night for us at  Kylesku. After tea-  
 time the children dress up. Some are  
 ghosts, some witches or skeletons.    
 Even a superman can be seen in Kylesku
 that night.                           
  My dad collects all of us and takes  
 us in his car round every house in    
 Unapool and Kylesku. When we go into  
 the houses we all sing songs and      
 entertain the people. Usually we are  
 given apples and oranges, sweets and  
 nuts and sometimes money.Everything   
 given to us is kept in one bag and    
 divided equally at the end of our     
 night out.                            
  Travelling from house to house is fun
 when there are so many of us packed   
 into the car.                         
  Our last visit is to a house where   
 there is a party. At 11.30 we all go  
 home, exhausted.                      </content>
