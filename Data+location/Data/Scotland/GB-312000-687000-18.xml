 road which starts at the Halbeath     
 Interchange(on the M90) and goes near 
 Cowdenbeath, Lochgelly, Cardenden,    
 Kircaldy and finally Glenrothes.There 
 is also another main road in the area.
 This is the M90 from Edinburgh to     
 Perth and is used by many commuters.  
 The major railway line which runs     
 through Dunfermline, Cowdenbeath,     
 Lochgelly, Cardenden is also used by  
 many commuters.                       
 There are a few industries in the     
 area including open cast mining which 
 employs only 4O workers; Reids which  
 is a building contractors; Crawfords-a
