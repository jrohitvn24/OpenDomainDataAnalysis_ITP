		<title>09DALZIEL FLYING CLUB</title>
		<content> The Pigeon-Fanciers Club in Bellshill 
 Road, Known as the{Dalziel Flying Club
 was founded in 1922.  The club has 36 
 members, known as{Lofts,}the oldest of
 whom, Mr Clark, is 87 years of age.   
 The pigeons shortest race is 66 miles 
 but the longest has been 602 miles    
 from Nantes in France.  When pigeons  
 are racing they do not know where they
 are going and sometimes get lost!     
 During training sessions they fly for 
 short distances, eg from Lesmahagow or
 Wishaw back home to Motherwell.  Good 
 birds can fly at 70 miles per hour.   
 Both male and female pigeons are      
 raced.  It is safe to start racing    
 pigeons when they are 12 weeks old.   
 They are transported to the race start
 in baskets by road and rail.  The     
 winner of the race is the pigeon who  
 gets home first.
