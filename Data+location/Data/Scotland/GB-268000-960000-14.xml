		<content>{FISHING IN BETTYHILL }                
 Fishing is very important locally for 
 lots of reasons and can be divided up 
 into various categories. These are:   
{COMMERCIAL SEA FISHING} There are four
 people who own fairly large boats and 
 who add to their income by commercial 
 fishing.  Their catch is entirely     
 lobsters which are kept in live boxes 
 in the sea until there's enough to    
 justify collection by a fish merchant.
 There are plenty of crabs to be caught
 but no market for them. The large     
 stocks of white fish, herring and     
 mackerel offshore are fished by large 
 boats from the rest of Scotland and   
 even England but not by local boats.  
 This is partly because there are no   
 decent harbours along the coast and   
 the size of local boats is restricted.
