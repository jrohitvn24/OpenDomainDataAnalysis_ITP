		<title>20PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> In Primaries 1 and 2 (five/six years) 
 the most popular games are imaginative
 games such as mummies and daddies and 
 super babies, which is a game where   
 girls pretend that they are super     
 babies and catch the boys who are the 
 baddies. They play ordinary games as  
 well like tig.                        
 Primary 4's usually play football and 
 rounders.                             
 In Primary 5   they play soldiers and 
 tig and sometimes they play 'chainy'  
 where someone is 'hit', they have to  
 catch someone else who joins up and   
 they catch another and so on.         
 In Primaries 6 and 7 they play games  
 like football (both girls and boys)   
 and helpy which is another kind of    
 tig. They play hide and seek as well. 
 In the summer the girls play skipping 
 and practise headstands against the   
 school wall.                          </content>
