		<title>03ESKDALEMUIR SHEEP FARMING</title>
		<content>  Just as the introduction of sheep to 
 the area in the 13th century led to   
 the slow removal of the mainly        
 deciduous primeval forest so the      
 introduction of re_afforestation in   
 1938 by the Forestry Commission and   
 again in 1965 by the Economic Forestry
 Group resulted in dramatic decrease in
 the numbers of sheep.                 
  Nevertheless,on the lower slopes of  
 the valley well established sheep     
 farms remain stocked with Cheviots and
 to a lesser extent Blackfaces.        
  With an exceptionally hardy          
 constitution and a very adaptable     
 nature both these breeds do well.     
  Pedigree rams and ewes are bred and  
 sold .Sheep are given sheep feed and  
 mineral blocks throughout the two     
 months before lambing which takes     
 place in April and May and sold at    
 lamb sales in August and September.   </content>
