        Most of the farming in the area
 concerns livestock as the hilly nature
 of the land is best for this type of  
 farming. A few dairies are to be found
 such as Robinsland (square 15,51) but 
 much of the land is only suitable for 
 sheep,                                
   In the 1960's traditional breeds eg.
 Hereford,Aberdeen Angus and the Short 
 horn were replaced by the more        
 economical foreign breeds such as the 
 British Charlois, Romanolga and the   
 Limousin. These are more economical as
 being bigger produce more meat.       
   The most common breed of sheep is   
 the Blackface. The common sire for the
 fat lambs is the Suffolk. Blackfaced  
 ewes are often crossed with           
 Leicesters. Ewe lambs of this cross   
 are kept and bred with the Suffolk    
 which results in fat lambs.           </content>
