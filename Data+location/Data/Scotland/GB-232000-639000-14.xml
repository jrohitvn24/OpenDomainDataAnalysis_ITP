		<content> Once{Irvine}was the busiest seaport on
 the west coast of Scotland and goods  
 were carried from the ships by pack   
 horses. The men who owned the pack    
 horses were called{Cadgers.}Later they
 began to use carts and changed their  
 name to{Carters.}They were very       
 important men and travelled as far as 
 Glasgow with their goods.On at least  
 one occasion they carried goods to    
 Aberdeen.{King Robert the Bruce}asked 
 for their help and men from Irvine    
 Carters Society helped Bruce defeat   
 the English at the{Battle of          
{Bannockburn.}Because of this, Bruce   
 decreed that Irvine should become a{  
{Royal Burgh.}The Royal Charter was    
 presented in 1372 by Bruce's          
 grandson,{King Robert II,}the first   
 Stuart monarch.The Carters also fought
 for{Mary Queen of Scots}at the Battle 
 of Langside.                          </content>
