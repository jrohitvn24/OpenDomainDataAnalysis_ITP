		<title>06FARMING - ETTRICK VALLEY</title>
		<content>   Farmland in Ettrick Valley is mainly
 grades 6 &amp; 7 and consists of steep    
 rough grazing with a small percentage 
 of workable fields mainly beside the  
 River Ettrick which runs across this  
 section. The ground height is 700 ft. 
 to l500ft. Of the six farms in this   
 area, one belongs to the Forestry     
 Commission and is given over to       
 conifers. The others, classified as   
 less favoured areas are stocked with  
 sheep and beef cattle.                
 Farm Animals - The farms are stocked  
 with the hardy cheviot sheep or the   
 Scottish blackfaced sheep and the     
 cattle are beef-type cows out         
 wintering and single suckling. Lambs  
 and calves are sold in the Autumn at  
 the store sales where they are bought 
 by farmers from low ground to fatten  
 for the market.
