		<title>20RATES RISES</title>
		<content>  In 1985 the rateable values of       
 properties in Scotland have been      
 reassessed and in many cases increased
 by a significant amount. It is        
 according to the rateable values that 
 householders pay a local taxation to  
 fund the local services such as Educt-
 ation, the Police, refuse collection  
 and Hospitals. Edinburgh has been     
 particularily badly hit by current    
 rates rises and when we questioned    
 local residents about their views,    
 more than 80% of them felt that the   
 quality of the services did not       
 justify rate rises of more than 100%.
