		<content>   "The Pet and Garden Shop" is a good 
 place for finding all sorts of food   
 for all kinds of pets.The most common 
 food which is sold there is dog       
 biscuits.In fact about 100lbs. (45kg.)
 are sold in one day.                  
   Cages for budgies are also sold     
 along with fish-tanks and almost      
 everything else that any pet would    
 need to live a happy life.            
                                       
   Dogs are the most common animal that
 the vet sees.Of these the labrador is 
 the most common.The vet also works on 
 many birds like budgies.The oldest    
 bird he has worked on was 57 years old
 and it was a parrot.                  
   Generally the vet sees 20 animals in
 a day.He mostly works on young pets   
 rather than old.He is sometimes called
 out through the night.Diarrhoea is the
 most common illness in all pets.      </content>
