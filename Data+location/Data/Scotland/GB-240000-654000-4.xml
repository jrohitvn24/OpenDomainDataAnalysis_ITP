		<title>04A DAY ON A DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
   Our farm,Netherton, is about 160    
 acres of grassland,with about a       
 quarter of an acre for growing        
 vegetables for ourselves.             
   My day begins at 6.00a.m.  when my  
 husband and I rise to prepare for the 
 morning milking.We milk 48 dairy cows 
 (Ayrshire and Friesians) twice a day. 
 During milking I feed the youngest    
 calves,up to 3 months old,with warm   
 milk,cake and a little hay.           
   After breakfast, the byre has to be 
 cleaned and washed,and the milking    
 machines,pipeline and milk tank have  
 to be sterilised.                     
   The rest of the morning is spent in 
 tractors,cutting or spreading hay.    
   About 4.00p.m.the cows are milked   
 and the calves are fed again.In the   
 evening we bring in the hay and stack 
 the bales.Many helpers are needed.    </content>
