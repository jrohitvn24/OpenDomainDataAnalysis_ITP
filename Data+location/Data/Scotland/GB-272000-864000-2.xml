		<title>02FISH FARMING ON THE FIRTH</title>
		<content>  Though two thirds of this section are
 the waters of the Cromarty Firth, this
 does provide the setting for one of   
 the newer industries in Scotland. Four
 of the pupils of Newhall School       
 visited the Fish farmout in the bay,  
 spending a most enjoyable afternoon   
 learning how fish are farmed and      
 helping to feed them. The farm was    
 first started some three years ago by 
 Robert Davie, a fish merchant from    
 Cromarty. Then. with three partners,  
 and assisted by a loan from the       
 Highlands and Islands Development     
 Board, the Cromarty Salmon Company,   
 was formed. Mr. Davie is now managing 
 director and the firm employs a       
 manager and a young assistant who is  
 working under the Youth Opportunities 
 scheme. Brian
