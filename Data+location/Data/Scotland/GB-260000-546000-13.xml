		<content> This, being a rural area is not at all
 well served by public transport.  A   
 public service bus goes through the   
 area in the morning picking up        
 commuters for business in             
 Kirkcudbright, and also the school    
 children going to the Academy. This   
 bus returns at 4pm carrying the       
 children home.  During the holidays,  
 no bus runs.                          
 The Post Office runs three mini-buses 
 each day,leaving the Post Office in   
 Borgue at 9.00am after bringing in the
 children to school.  It leaves again  
 at 10.30am, and another bus           
 leaves at 3.30pm to carry the children
 home.  This is a very important       
 service for the people who do not have
 cars.
