		<title>01Glen Noe and Clan MacIntyre</title>
		<content>  Glen Noe drops from high ground near 
 the east summit of Ben Cruachan to sea
 level at Loch Etive. The glen is the  
 traditional homeland of Clan          
 MacIntyre. The land is part of Glen   
 Noe estate and is private. This part  
 of the estate farms about 1000 black- 
 face ewes. Stalking yields about eight
 stags per annum. There are only two   
 houses, the homes of Mr George        
 Fleming, Estate owner, and of Mr      
 Ronald Gordon, Farm manager. Post is  
 delivered by Royal Mail launch on Loch
 Etive as there are no public roads in 
 or to the glen. A ruin sometimes      
 associated with Clan MacIntyre is now 
 considered to be of too recent        
 construction. MacIntyre's from America
 have placed a commemorative Cairn and 
 plaque on the shore. There are sober  
 suggestions that the glen is haunted  
 as ghostly sounds of a bell ringing   </content>
