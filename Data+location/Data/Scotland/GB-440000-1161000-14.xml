 The Voe concert party is a group of   
 local people who perform around       
 Shetland.They sing songs,do sketches  
 and recite poetry all in the Shetland 
 dialect.They compose their own        
 material which is mainly about topical
 local events.Humour is the main       
 ingredient of their performances and  
 the audiences are always greatly      
 entertained.                          
 After the concert a dance may be held.
 This would consist of waltzes and     
 reels,being danced to traditional     
 Shetland music which would be provided
 by the concert muscians.The money     
 raised goes to the Voe hall funds.    
 There was a concert party about 25    
 years ago but it disbanded until 1980 
 when it restarted,much to everyones   
 delight.
