		<content> Every year, on the{31st}of{October,   
 children from Croy go guising.They get
 dressed up in costumes and go round   
 the many houses in Croy telling jokes 
 and singing songs.They do this simply 
 for sweets and peanuts.               
    Nearly every year there is a       
 Halloween party at the Youth Club and 
 everybody gets packed full of food    
 before going out guising.We normally  
 get our photo taken and there are lots
 of turnips,which are hollowed out and 
 have a face cut in them and a candle  
 inserted inside, sitting on the       
 window_sills.                         
    You can see the many different     
 costumes that the people are          
 wearing.They range from animal        
 look_a_likes to weird looking robots  
 and demons,even cartoon characters.
