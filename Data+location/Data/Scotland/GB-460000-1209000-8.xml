		<title>08The Local Policeman</title>
		<content> Our policeman, P.C.Harry Edwards has  
 lived in the area for 8 years. Being  
 the only policeman on the island he   
 has no chance of promotion without    
 moving. He has become, through his    
 helpful attitude and his involvement  
 in youth activities a highly respected
 member of a practically crime-free    
 island. He enjoys living here and     
 dislike being called to work elsewhere
 He often visits our school for road   
 safety, cycling proficiency and Top of
 the Form Contests which are organised 
 by the Northern Constabulary. One of  
 his hobbies is birdwatching and he can
 often be seen with his binoculars 'on 
 the beat'. He dislikes living in the  
 police house with its attached cell.He
 has had a variety of duties in his 8  
 years here but the oddest was         
 'arresting' 3 charity raising convicts
 heading for Muckle Flugga.            </content>
