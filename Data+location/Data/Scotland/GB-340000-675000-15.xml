  Grandmother's home in a threestorey  
 block in {LEITH WALK},Edinburgh was   
 our starting place for a shopping trip
 to the {CITY OF EDINBURGH}.After      
 getting up at 6 oclock we left for    
 there at 7.30a.m in daddy's car.We had
 breakfast at gran's and went in the   
 bus to the city.Mum's shopping was    
 done in {PRINCES ST.}and in the St.   
 James' Centre.Mum bought a new dress  
 and a pair of shoesafter being in a   
 lot of shops trying things on.From the
 start of the day my brother had held  
 us up for he is so slow.Gran did her  
 own shopping and I got a toy.Shopping 
 finished it was back to gran's by bus 
 and back home by dad's car.
