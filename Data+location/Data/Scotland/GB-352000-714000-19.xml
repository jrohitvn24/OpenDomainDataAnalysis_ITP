		<content> Brownhills House,St Andrews, which is 
 an old Victorian Mansion set in       
 extensive grounds, enjoys an enviable 
 position approximately 1 mile South-  
 East of St Andrews, and has commanding
 views over St Andrews Bay.The property
 has been extensively renovated and    
 converted to form seven luxury self-  
 contained flats,each with a garage.The
 flats are furnished to a very high    
 standard,with luxury kitchens,coloured
 bathroom suites with showers and with 
 full electric central heating,yet each
 flat retains many of the attractive   
 features of the original house. All   
 flats share a mature walled garden.   
 This type of conversion is becoming   
 common in the St Andrews locality with
 increasing demand for property with   
 character.
