		<content> The McSeveny's live in a rented farm  
 cottage owned by Pitbladdo Farm. It   
 was originally two cottages but has   
 been recently connverted into one. It 
 wasn't fully modernised by the farm   
 owners but Mr.McSeveny is currently   
 modernising it. The kitchen is very   
 small but he is fitting a wood burning
 stove. The wiring in the house is poor
 ,it has rising damp and needs a new   
 roof. Central heating is being        
 installed this summer. The cottage    
 consists of one main lounge, one large
 and one small bedroom, a kitchen and  
 the recently added bathroom!          
  The farm track (from Pitbladdo)      
 passes the cottage door and at the    
 rear there is a garden of about 1/3 of
 an acre. Here the family grow         
 vegetables although they get potatoes 
 from the farm.
