 This meets every week in one of the   
 masters' houses.  About twenty boys go
 each week and about 3 masters.  We    
 speak on topics related to life and   
 the Bible and Christianity.  Each     
 meeting starts with prayers and       
 singing.  Then there are notices and  
 after that a look at the week's topic.
 At the end there is a closing prayer, 
 and then a chat over coffee and       
 biscuits.                             
{Sunday School}                        
 This meets every Sunday in the Music  
 School for masters' children.  There  
 are four classes with a teacher for   
 each (masters' wives) and a total of  
 20 children.  They work with Scripture
 Union material which is relevant to   
 their age group and sing, pray and    
 collect money.  Each year they perform
  a Christmas Play.                    </content>
