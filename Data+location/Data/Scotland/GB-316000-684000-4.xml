 was'nt very nice so we cancelled it.  
    Saturday morning and I went to see 
 the horses at the farm and I later    
 rode{Dazzler,}(my horse).  After I had
 finished my ride I helped my mother to
 paint our fence.                      
    On Sunday I finished painting the  
 fence and afterwards I played on my   
 bicycle.
