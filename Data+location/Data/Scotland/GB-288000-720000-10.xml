		<title>10SAWMILL</title>
		<content>     The sawmill has been on the       
{Abercairney Estate}for over 100 years.
 The first kind of power it used was a 
 water wheel.  Then it was driven by   
 tractor and now is fully electric.    
     The sawmill is open occasionally  
 depending on the weather and it       
 employs 2 people.  The working hours  
 are from 8 am to 5 pm.  The workers   
 get 6 weeks for holidays but do not   
 usually take them as other jobs are   
 offered when the mill is closed.      
     Approximately{130 tons}of{Scots   
{Pine, Spruce}and{Larch}from the Estate
 are used per year.                    
     It is made into stobs or batters, 
 firewood and is used for general      
 repair work on the Estate.            
     As little is sold, it is not a    
 financially profitable part of the    
 Estate.
