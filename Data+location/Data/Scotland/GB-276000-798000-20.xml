		<title>20TRANSPORT IN BADENOCH</title>
		<content> Although Kingussie was{by-passed}by   
 the A9 trunk road in 1979, the new    
 road provides easy access for         
 residents to shopping facilities in   
 Inverness and Perth. {Tourism}is a    
 main industry in this area and is     
 assisted by greatly improved road     
 links with the south. {High speed     
{buses}compete with the train service  
 for passengers and are ever increasing
 in popularity due to the economy and  
 comfort offered. At the time Kingussie
 was by-passed bus transport consisted 
 of two buses northbound and two       
 southbound weekly.  Nowadays there is 
 a choice of twelve per day each way!  
{Train services}have also improved with
 the use of the High Speed 125 train   
 and of updated rolling stock.  London 
 can be reached in seven hours.
