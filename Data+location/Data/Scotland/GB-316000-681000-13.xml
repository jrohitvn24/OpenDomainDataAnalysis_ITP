		<content> Within Dalgety Bay there are a number 
 of places of historical interest.     
 These include the medieval kirk of    
 Saint Bridget and the remains of      
 Donibristle House, the former seat of 
 the Earls of Moray. There are also    
 First and Second World War relics.    
 During the 1914-18 war, gun           
 emplacements were constructed at      
 Braefoot Point to protect the         
 approaches to Rosyth naval base       
 further up the Firth of Forth. A pier 
 also at Braefoot Point still remains. 
 This was used for the offloading of   
 supplies and munitions. During the    
 Second World War, numerous pill boxes,
 anti-aircraft guns and buildings to   
 house the troops were built. The      
 function of the troops was to guard   
 the airfield. These wartime relics can
 be seen at Braefoot Point.
