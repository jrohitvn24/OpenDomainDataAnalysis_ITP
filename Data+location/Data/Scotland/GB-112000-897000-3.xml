		<title>03HOUSING IN TARBERT,HARRIS</title>
		<content> There are many different types of     
 houses in the Tarbert area.The first  
 comparison we made was between council
 and private housing,here 54% of the   
 houses are private houses and 46% are 
 council owned.This however does not a 
 true picture since there is a higher  
 propotion of council houses in Tarbert
 than anywhere else in Harris.         
 The next thing we looked at was the   
 style of houses,2.7% are flats,17.6%  
 are croft houses,31.7% are detached   
 and 42.6% are not detached.           
 The size of the houses range from ones
 with one bedroom to houses with more  
 than six bedrooms,the most common size
 of house however is a three bedroomed 
 one,more than half of the houses in   
 our area are of that size.
