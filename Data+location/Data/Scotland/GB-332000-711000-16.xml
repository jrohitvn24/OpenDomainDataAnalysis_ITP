		<content> The{Community Council}is made up of 9 
 elected members, who serve for 3      
 years. Its function is to help        
 residents with problems or deal with  
 any complaints. It meets once a month 
 and its meetings are open to the      
 public, although few people attend.   
 The Community Council can report any  
 damage to roads, pavements and public 
 areas to the{District Council.}It can 
 help tenants of Council Houses to get 
 repairs done by contacting the        
 District Council for them. The        
 Community Council organises events to 
 raise money for local improvements.   
 Such an event would be a sponsored    
 walk. It looks over plans for any new 
 buildings. It can see to the          
 replacement of street signs. It can   
 make sure that the village has        
 sufficent public transport.
