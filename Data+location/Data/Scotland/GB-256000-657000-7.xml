		<content> When we heard that we were to go to { 
{Castlemilk}for the DOMESDAY PROJECT we
 wondered what we'd be in for.         
 Not many of us had ever been there,   
 but we had certainly heard all about  
 it!!                                  
                                       
 To us {Castlemilk}means {Gang Warfare}
 Drugs{Glue Sniffing}and Vandalism.    
 As we drove and walked about we began 
 to realise that there is very little  
 for people to do.                     
                                       
{Castlemilk}is an enormous housing     
 scheme but up until last year there   
 wasn't even a {PUB}. The new Pub is   
 called {the OASIS}which we all thought
 was a good idea, as it is the only    
 "watering hole" in a sort of desert.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
