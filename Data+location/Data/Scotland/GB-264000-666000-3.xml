		<title>03COMMUNITY PROJECT IN ACTION</title>
		<content>   The most successful aspect of       
 the community project has been the    
 minibus which has taken the children  
 on many outings, and the parents on   
 shopping expeditions etc. Parents who 
 already worked within the school now  
 have a meeting place funded by the    
 project and this has proved very      
 popular as this is a much needed      
 facility in Ruchazie.                 
   Very recently a{Home-maker}was added
 to the staff.  Her job involves       
 working in the homes of families      
 experiencing difficulties in basic    
 home management. The success of this  
 in turn is hoped to prove beneficial  
 to the children and therefore to the  
 school.                               
   Links between education and social  
 work have so far failed to develop as 
 was first hoped due to the different  
 expectations of each discipline.      </content>
