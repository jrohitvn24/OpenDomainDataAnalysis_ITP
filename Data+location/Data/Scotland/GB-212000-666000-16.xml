		<content>{NEOLITHIC CAVE.                       
    Neolithic man lived in this        
 cave thousands of years ago,perhaps   
 its hard to believe but it is true.   
                                       
    The cave,which is in the grounds of
 Tollard Residential Home, is not very 
 big. It used to be a lot bigger but   
 over thousands of years soil and      
 leaves have covered it up and now it  
 is only two metres high.If a team of  
 archaeologists excavated it they would
 probably find fossils,primitive tools 
 and lots of shells because although   
 the cave is set quite far back in the 
 country side thousands of years ago   
 the sea would be just in front of the 
 cave and therefore the Neolithic man  
 would have lived off the sea and      
 shore.
