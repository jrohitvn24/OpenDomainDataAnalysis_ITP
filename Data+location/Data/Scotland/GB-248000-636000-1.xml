		<title>01INTRODUCTION-GALSTON</title>
		<content> Galston is a small town with a        
 population of 6,000. It is situated in
 the upper Irvine valley 7 kilometres  
 from Kilmarnock.                      
 At the meeting of the upland and      
 lowland Ayrshire it is a natural      
 routeway and market centre.Its        
 industrial function has varied in form
 over the years and has been based on  
 textiles and coal-mining.             
 These factors have allowed the town to
 develop into a more important service 
 centre than the neighbouring towns of 
 Newmilns,Darvel and Hurlford. This is 
 reflected clearly in the amenity index
 and community services. The           
 surrounding countryside is typical of 
 rural Ayrshire and has for its base   
 Dairy and sheep farming.
