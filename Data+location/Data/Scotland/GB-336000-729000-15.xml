 team must reach the base and shout{   
{"Reelie Foe".}The game is over when   
 all the running-away team are caught. 
                                       
{  CATTY-A-BATTY }: A piece of wood    
 with four sides numbered 1-4 is laid  
 on the edge of a pavement and flicked 
 up into the air with a bat. It is then
 hit as far as possible. The distance  
 is measured in bats-e.g.20 bats = 20  
 points. The winner is the player with 
 most points.
