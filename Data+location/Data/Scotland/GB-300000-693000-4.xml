		<title>04A FAVOURITE WALK</title>
		<content>  THIS WALK WAS WALKED IN JUNE.THE     
 PLACE WALKED WAS JUST NORTH OF SALINE.
  FROM THE ROAD MANY FIELDS CAN BE     
 SEEN,THE FIELDS CONTAIN GRASS FOR     
 SHEEP AND CATTLE.                     
  A FEW FARM HOUSES LINE THE ROAD AND  
 A SPRING FLOWS BETWEEN THEM.          
  THE VALLEY IS 'U' SHAPED AND THE     
 HILLS ARE UNDULATED.THE SPRING SEEN   
 EARLIER RUNS THROUGH HERE AS A MISFIT 
 STREAM.                               
  THERE ARE A FEW TREES,WIND BRAKES,AND
 MANY RABITS CAN BE SEEN EVEN A FOX    
 CARRYING ITS PREY.                    
  A DENSELY WOODED STREAM RUNS UNDER   
 THE ROAD,MANY BIRDS CAN BE SEEN AND   
 HEARD WITHIN THESE TREES.
