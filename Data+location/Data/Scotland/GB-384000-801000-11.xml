		<content>{FARMING                               
    The farms in the area from         
 Peterculter to Miltimber are mainly   
 large but there are a few crofts.We   
 visited three farms,(1)WESTFIELD      
 (2)FOGGIETON (3)UPPER BEANSHILL.      
 Most farmers own about 40 acres,and   
 some farmers let their land to other  
 farmers.                              
                                       
{FARMERS                               
     All of the farmers thought that   
 farming was worthwhile,and they all   
 said that they enjoyed it very much   
 although they don't make a lot of     
 profit.                               
                                       
{FARM PRODUCTS                         
    We found the land was mainly for   
 grazing and their cattle were fattened
 for meat.All the farmers grow crops   
 including wheat,barley,potatoes,corn, </content>
