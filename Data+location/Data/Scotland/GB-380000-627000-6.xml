		<title>06Yetholm Community Council</title>
		<content> The Community Council was inaugurated 
 in 1977 and consists of 11 members    
 representing 660 electors. It is      
 exceptional for a rural Council in    
 Roxburgh District as this area is     
 split into 4 wards:- Ward A (Bowmont  
 Water) 2 seats, Ward B (Kirk Yetholm &amp;
 Landward) 3 seats, Ward C (Cherrytrees
 to Hoselaw) 1 seat and Ward D         
 (Yetholm) 5 seats. The Council works  
 closely &amp; actively with Regional &amp;    
 District Councillors each on the C.C. 
 and covers many aspects of local      
 government:- roads, conservation,     
 planning, public transport, rights of 
 way, council housing, recreation &amp;    
 tourism. A long campaign ended in the 
 location of a Public Toilet in Kirk   
 Yetholm, new footpaths between the    
 villages have been completed and the  
 Council took an active part to ensure 
 the school stays open.                </content>
