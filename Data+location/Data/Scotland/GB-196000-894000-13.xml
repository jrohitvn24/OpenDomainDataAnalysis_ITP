		<title>13BADLUARACH/SCORAIG-PEOPLE</title>
		<content>   THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CHANGES DURING 
 THE LAST 50yrs.IN THE 1930s THERE WERE
 AROUND 80 PEOPLE LIVING IN 13 HOUSE-  
 HOLDS,BUT THERE ARE NOW ONLY ABOUT 19 
 PEOPLE LIVING IN BADLUARACH.          
   THERE ARE ONLY 4 PEOPLE WHO HAVE    
 LIVED IN BADLUARACH ALL THEIR LIVES.  
 THERE IS AT TOTAL OF 6 GAELIC SPEAKERS
 THERE.                                
   ONE FAMILY OF INCOMERS IS FROM THE  
 OUTER HEBRIDES.OTHERS COME FROM THE   
 SOUTH OF SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND AND     
 WALES.                                
   SIMILARLY,ON SCORAIG ON THE OTHER   
 SIDE OF THE LOCH,THE POPULATION HAS   
 DROPPED CONSIDERABLY.BY THE EARLY     
 SIXTIES ALL THE OLD CROFTERS HAD LEFT 
 THEIR CROFTS TO LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE.  
   FROM 1963 ONWARDS NEWCOMERS STARTED 
 TO SETTLE ON SCORAIG AND THERE ARE NOW
 ABOUT 60 PEOPLE LIVING IN 18          
 HOUSEHOLDS.                           </content>
