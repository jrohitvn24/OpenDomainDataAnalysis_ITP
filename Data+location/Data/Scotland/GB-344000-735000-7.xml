		<content>    As there is no Health Clinic in the
 area, local people are normally       
 registered with Doctors and Dentists  
 in Dundee or Forfar. Hospitals are    
 also centred in Dundee, the two main  
 general hospitals being Ninewells and 
 Dundee Royal Infirmary.               
    There is a Health Clinic at        
 Whitfield, Dundee, which is a local   
 base for the School Doctor, Dentist,  
 Nurses and Health Visitors.  Routine  
{medical inspections}for pupils are    
 carried out annually by the School    
 Doctor and Nurse, while the School    
 Dentist visits each school twice per  
 session with a mobile surgery to carry
 out inspections and treatment.        
    Pupils' eyesight and hearing are   
 checked annually by the orthoptist and
 audiographer.
