		<title>12Two Local Sports Teams</title>
		<content>{Baltasound United F.C. }Became united 
 with Uyeasound in the early Sixties   
 because there were not enough players 
 to form a strong team in either       
 area.The team's football pitch is     
 Harry's Park which they share with a  
 flock of sheep. They hope to get a new
 purpose built pitch in the future. The
 average age of the present team is    
 about 22 and there is a lot of local  
 interest locally amongst teenagers.The
 new strip is white with black pin     
 stripes,black shorts and socks.       
{Baltasound Badminton Club.}Badminton  
 is one of the most popular sports and 
 is played regularly through the winter
 in the Baltasound Hall. There is an   
 'A'and'B' team which compete with     
 teams from around the island. There is
 a knockout championship for anyone who
 wants to take part at the end of the  
 season.                               </content>
