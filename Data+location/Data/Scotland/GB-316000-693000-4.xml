		<content>        Mining in Lochgelly ended in   
 1967 after almost 400 years of        
 coal production. Unemployment in      
 allied industries such as brickworks, 
 a foundry and machine shop were also  
 a result of pit closures.             
         Most of the work-force in the 
 area have to travel outwith the       
 town. Rosyth Naval Dockyard and       
 Electronic Industries, within a 22km  
 radius,are major employers.           
        Dunfermline District Council   
 have established the Cartmore Estate  
 to attract light industries.          
        From the 1981 Census, the      
 number of employed people in the      
 Lochgelly North &amp; South Districts was 
 3,700; 5% were unemployed.
