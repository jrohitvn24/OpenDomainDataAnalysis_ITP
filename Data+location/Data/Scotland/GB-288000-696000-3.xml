		<title>03LIVING IN ALVA</title>
		<content>                                       
 A small survey showed that people     
 choose to live Alva for three main    
 reasons. There is a good choice of    
{housing}at reasonble prices. Alva is a
 quiet place and attractive with the   
 hills and glens behind it. People     
 whose{jobs}are not in Alva find it    
 quite easy to reach their work. The   
 airports at Glasgow and Edinburgh can 
 be reached in less than an hour.      
 People who have to travel around in   
 their work find Alva's position in    
 Central Scotland very useful. Another 
 survey showed that{home life}in Alva  
 could be improved if there were       
 special{shops}which sold things like  
 books,records and shoes. People would 
 also like a restaurant.
