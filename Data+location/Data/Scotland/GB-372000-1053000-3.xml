		<title>03NORTH RONALDSAY'S SHEEP</title>
		<content> Our sheep are very rare,they are      
 native to North Ronaldsay.There are   
 hardly any of them anywhere else in   
 the world.                            
 It is said that they resemble         
 goats,they are moorit (brown),black   
 and a touch of grey.And around the    
 size of a large labrador.             
 The lambs are born in May,the ewes    
 have up to four lambs but most of the 
 time when they have three or four     
 lambs one or two are drowned because  
 it is too much for the mother.        
 Their fleece is very soft for         
 spinning by hand which some people do,
 but it is usually sold.First of all it
 is given to Hugh Trebb to be weighed  
 then it is put on the boat and goes   
 to a Mr C.Scott who sells it to       
 Scottish,English and Welsh Wool       
 Growers.There it is sorted and put to 
 an auction.                           </content>
