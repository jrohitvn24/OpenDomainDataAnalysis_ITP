 PAPER THE{AIRDRIE AND COATBRIDGE      
 ADVERTISER.THE COMMUNITY COUNCIL HELD 
 THEIR MONTHLY MEETING RECENTLY. A     
 NUMBER OF PEOPLE TURNED UP TO HEAR THE
 RESULTS OF A PUBLIC MEETING THAT HAD  
 BEEN HELD. THE MEMBERS WERE PLEASED TO
 HEAR THAT HOUSES IN PART OF GARTLEA   
 ARE TO BE PARTIALLY MODERNISED.THIS   
 WILL MEAN NEW WINDOWS, REWIRING,      
 CENTRAL HEATING AND OTHER REPAIRS.    
 AFTER THE BUSINESS WAS FINISHED, TWO  
 MEMBERS OF ALCHOLICS ANONYMOUS GAVE AN
 INTERESTING TALK ON THE PROBLEMS THAT 
 ALCHOLOLISM BRINGS. SOME MEMBERS FELT 
 THAT THESE TALKS WOULD BE BETTER AIMED
 AT THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE AREA AND   
 WERE SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT THREE      
 AIRDRIE SECONDARIES HAD SHOWN LITTLE  
 INTEREST. THE COUNCIL AGREED THAT     
 UNDER-AGE DRINKING IS A PROBLEM IN    
 AIRDRIE AND URGED ACTION.             </content>
