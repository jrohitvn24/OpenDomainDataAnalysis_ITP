		<title>20ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, W.KILBRIDE</title>
		<content> All the{information}on this disk and  
 the disk about Seamill, was carefully 
{gathered}together by{all the members  
 of the{three primary seven classes in 
{West Kilbride Primary School, viz.,   
{P7a, P7b, and P7c. }They did all the  
 hard work of conducting interviews,   
 writing reports and in some cases     
 taking recordings of interviews for   
 transcript later.  Once all the       
 information had been gathered, theirs 
 was the task of{sorting it all out    
 into the appropriate categories and   
 then using the best of all the        
 information to compile the individual 
 pages on the disk. All this work was  
 done in a very{enthusiastic}and       
{hard-working}fashion.                 
 Without all this hard work, a lot of  
 interesting facts about West Kilbride 
 might never have been found out or    
 saved.                                </content>
