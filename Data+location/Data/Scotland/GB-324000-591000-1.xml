		<content> Once this was all open rough grazing, 
 dry stone wall country. Now some      
 remains but most of the hills have    
 been taken over by the Forestry       
 Commission.                           
 The pine trees have eaten up the      
 sheep.  The remaining farms occupy the
 rich river land where cultivated grass
 feeds beef cattle and sheep. The      
 shepherd and his dog have gone . The  
 farmer moves his flocks from a land   
 rover. Sometimes he tries a field of  
 barley and loses it all in a bad year 
 like 1985.                            
 The houses are widely scattered. Farms
 are substantial but not opulent,      
 cottages are single storey. Local     
 employment is farming or forestry. The
 few other householder work in  small  
 town 15 miles away. Everyone gets     
 about by car, only holidaymakers walk.
 The roads are good and well           </content>
