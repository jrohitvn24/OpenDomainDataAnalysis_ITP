		<content>{PLAYGROUP: }The Canonbie play group   
 meets in the village hall. The usual  
 age for children to start playgroup is
 3 or 4. Not all children in the area  
 go to playgroup.                      
{PRIMARY SCHOOL:} All children in the  
 area go either to Glenzier or Canonbie
 primary school at the age of five. The
 school at Canonbie had 64 pupils in   
 1985 and three permanent teachers.A   
 gym teacher and an art teacher come   
 once a week.                          
{SECONDARY SCHOOL:  }At the age of     
 twelve the children move to a         
 secondary school, usually Langholm    
 Academy.At age 16 they must travel to 
 Lockerbie or Annan if they want 16+   
 education as Langholm Academy is not  
 large enough to supply a full range of
 courses. This may mean up to 47 miles 
 of daily travel for children taking   
 highers.                              </content>
