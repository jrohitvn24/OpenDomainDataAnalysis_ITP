		<title>11MOSSTOWIE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> There are eight on the register at the
 moment.The playschool is very popular 
 with the children and the mothers     
 because it is preparing them for      
 school. Most people would like to see 
 more sports held in and around the    
 hall and a better variety of clubs for
 old and young people.Most people think
 facilities are adequate but some would
 like better accommodation and extra   
 facilities such as a full time        
 caretaker or a bar.                   
 Nearly everyone in our area uses the  
 hall on a regular basis.              
 Mosstowie School.                     
 It is located 4 miles South West of   
 Elgin.The original building was  built
 in 1875 and an extension was added    
 with two classrooms and a diningroom  
 in 1970.
