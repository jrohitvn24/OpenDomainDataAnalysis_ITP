		<title>15A day at the berries</title>
		<content>   The{berries}are hard work.You start 
 as early as 7.30 am and finish at 4.30
 pm.You are given a crate which has    
 sixteen trays. Depending on the       
 weight, you can get 40p to 50p a      
 crate.                                
   When you start in the morning you're
 given a dreel or row. You take a metal
 frame to carry your crate. In the     
 morning it is cool and easy to pick,  
 but as the day goes on it gets very   
 hot. I like the{raspberries}better    
 than the{strawberries.}At the         
 raspberries you don't have to bend    
 down.                                 
   The berries start at the end of June
 and end in August. I usually save up  
 all my berry money and spend it all   
 after the summer holidays.I think the 
 one thing that keeps you going is     
 knowing you're earning money.
