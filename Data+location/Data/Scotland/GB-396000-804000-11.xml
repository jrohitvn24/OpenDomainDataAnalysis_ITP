		<title>11FISH MARKET</title>
		<content> Once the fish are landed from the     
 trawlers they are stored in locally   
 made boxes with protective ice.The    
 fish market comes to life around 4am. 
 That's when Aberdeen's 200 fish       
 workers start unloading the fish.     
 Then the fish are weighed and laid out
 in display boxes for the buyers to    
 inspect them.The auction starts at    
 7.30am and may continue until midday. 
 The port handles mainly haddock.Once  
 sold the fish are then gutted and none
 is wasted.After filleting the         
 trimmings,head,tail, scales and bones 
 are frozen into blocks for export to  
 Scandinavia.There, the fish offal is  
 processed into mink food.Another      
 export is fish meal which is mainly   
 used as an additive to animal feed.   
 There are still a few remaining kilns 
 on the quays for smoking kippers and  
 haddock producing the famous 'Smokie'.</content>
