		<title>11LUFFNESS ESTATE</title>
		<content> This ancient estate occupies the land 
 to the east of the village.  There was
 a 12th century castle here, very large
 and important, a seat of the Earls of 
 Dunbar and March, the moat for which  
 and vestiges of the angle towers      
 remain.  A ruined priory which was    
 founded in 1268 is to be discovered in
 the grounds.  The castle was partially
 demolished in 1537, by the victorious 
 English after the Battle of Pinkie,   
 but the two lower storeys of the Keep,
 with ten-foot thick walls defied the  
 demolishers and are incorporated in   
 the present fortified house, which was
 erected in 1584. The Hope family      
 gained possession of the estate in    
 1713 and still hold it.  The 17th     
 century garden is especially fine and 
 opens, within the Scottish Gardens    
 scheme, to the general public.
