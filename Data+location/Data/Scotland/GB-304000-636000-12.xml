		<content>{Health}Services in Biggar are         
 reasonable for a small centre of      
 population.There is a small {Cottage  
{Hospital} built about the turn of the 
 century,which deals with fairly minor 
 injuries,more serious ones are either 
 sent to Edinburgh or Law Hospital.    
 Next to the Hospital there is a {     
{Health Centre}. The institution of a {
{Health Centre }is fairly recent and   
 falls into line with developments     
 elsewhere.The general health care     
 needs are provided by two             
 pharmacies,the sort of country        
 practise that could be affected by new
 Government proposals on               
 pharmacies.Outside Biggar there is a  
 residential place for the Elderly     
 called {Cornhill},which is run by the 
 Region.
