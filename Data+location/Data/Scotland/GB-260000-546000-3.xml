		<content> There are two small collections of    
 houses in the area.  The oldest, is   
 the village of Borgue.  This small    
 village is situated round a 'T'       
 junction where the minor road from    
 Kirkandrews joins the B727.  There are
 20 privately owned stone built houses 
 built along these roads in ribbon     
 development, and within the last four 
 years, four small brick council houses
 have been built for retired people.   
 Apart from these four houses there has
 been no development since the turn of 
 the century.  About one kilometre     
 along the Kirkandrews road is another 
 collection of seven stone built       
 houses, one of which is occupied by   
 the village blacksmith, and another by
 the local joiner.  This area is kown  
 as Sunnybrae, where eight five        
 apartment flats were built in 1950 by 
 the county council.                   </content>
