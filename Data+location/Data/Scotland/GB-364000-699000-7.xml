		<content> In the 9th century the May was used as
 a retreat by the missionary Adrian    
 (Ethernan) and his followers for a few
 years. This ass ociation of St. Adrian
 with the May is of major importance.  
 With his followers, St Adrian was     
 based on the May and spent much of his
 life evangalising on the Fife coast.  
 The Danes after devistating all of    
 Britannia, landed on the Isle in      
 March, 875 A.D. and St Adrian and his 
 followers were martyred.              
 Shortly before the middle of the 12th 
 century King David I, who was         
 responsible for setting up so many    
 religeous houses and episcopal seats  
 in Scotland, made a gift of the May   
 and its fishings to the Abbey of      
 Reading in Berkshire. The Priory of   
 May remained with the monks of Reading
 for almost one and a quarter          
 centuries.                            </content>
