		<content> THE RIBBON GAME started when a girl in
 our school brought in her gymnastic   
 ribbon. Ribbons are used to make      
 interseting shapes in the air.        
 HIGH TIG is often played in this area.
 There are two catchers, and every one 
 else has to run and find a high place 
 to stand or sit, while the catchers   
 count up to 100.   The players' feet  
 must not touch the ground.  If the    
 catcher touches someone with their    
 feet on the ground, that person is out
 and must stand still until someone    
 else touches them to release them.    
    The game continues until the       
 catchers have caught everyone.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
