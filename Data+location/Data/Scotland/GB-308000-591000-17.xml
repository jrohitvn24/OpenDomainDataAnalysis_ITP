		<title>17Accident Blackspot - Two</title>
		<content>     There have been so many accidents 
 involving vehicles crossing from one  
 side to the other and hitting traffic 
 going in the opposite direction  that 
 there are now many more stretches with
 crash barriers on the central         
 reservation.                          
     The volume of transport on the    
 road apparently does not warrant      
 making it up to Motorway standard.    
     The road is so dangerous that     
 school children have to be transported
 across it to school even though the   
 distance may be quite short.          
     The long straight stretch of road 
 at Johnstonebridge invites drivers to 
 speed especially those driving large  
 lorries.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
