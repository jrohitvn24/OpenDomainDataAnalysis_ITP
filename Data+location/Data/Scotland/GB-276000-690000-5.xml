 of the Christian Religion from        
 France.He preached all over Scotland  
 and founded a mud and wood{Church}at  
 St.Ninians around 400 A.D.The first   
 stone building was dedicated 1241 and 
 in 1734 a{bell tower}was added.The    
 third reconstruction was used by the  
 Jacobites to store gunpowder and it   
 was blown up in 1746.                 
 The present stone building was built  
 by 1751 and was to be temporary. It is
 still in regular use.The bell rings in
 the original tower and the church hall
 is used by many clubs.                
 The Church is roughly rectangular with
 a pulpit,communion table,choir stall  
 and pews.There are pictorial stained  
 glass windows and a pipe organ taken  
 from a cinema.The church plate is of  
 historic value.Members support a
