 1. You pick someone to go in the      
 centre. They call someone to run      
 across. They try to catch the person  
 who is running across.                
 2. If that person is caught he stands 
 with the person already in the        
 centre. Then they call out another    
 name and both of them try to catch    
 him.                                  
 3. If nobody is caught everyone       
 runs across.This continues until there
 is one person left. ALISTAIR

 "We form a circle with someone in the 
 centre.The person in the middle throws
 a ball to someone in the circle.      
 If they drop the ball the letter D    
 of donkey is gone. Nothing happens if 
 it is caught. You carry on until the  
 word is finished.The person who last  
 dropped the ball is donkey." LAURA    </content>
