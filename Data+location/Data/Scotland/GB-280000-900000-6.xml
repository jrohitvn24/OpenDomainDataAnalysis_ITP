		<title>06Education in Golspie.</title>
		<content>    Children of primary school age     
 attend{Golspie Primary School}which is
 the only primary school in the        
 village.The primary department of the 
 school has a role of 172 children.    
 (1985) The school also has a nursery  
 department, which takes children in   
 the year before they start their      
 primary education.(All local children 
 attend the nursery,-there is no       
 waiting list.)                        
   Children of secondary school age are
 more fortunate than other children in 
 Sutherland as they can complete their 
 full secondary education at{Golspie   
{High School.}Other secondary schools  
 in Sutherland are either 2-year or    
 4-year secondaries and the children of
 these schools have to move on to      
 Golspie to do a full six years.These  
 children are either bused to Golspie  
 daily or live near-by in hostels.     </content>
