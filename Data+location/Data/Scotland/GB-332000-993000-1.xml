		<content> Both the islands lie at the south end 
 of Scapa Flow.   Fara is uninhabited  
 and is rough moorland.   Flotta is    
 inhabited by about 100 people engaged 
 in farming.   However the dominant    
 feature here is the Flotta oil        
 terminal.   Oil is piped here from the
 Piper &amp; Claymore oilfields in the     
 north sea.   The volatile gases are   
 seperated off, then it is taken away  
 by tanker for refining elsewhere.     
 Most of the employees at the terminal 
 commute by boat from Orkney mainland. 
 There is a small airstrip on the west 
 of Flotta to service the oil terminal.
 The remaining land being covered      
 with moorland and heather.
