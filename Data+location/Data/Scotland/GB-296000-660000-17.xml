		<title>17SPORT IN THE BREICH VALLEY</title>
		<content>    As with many other areas of life in
 the Breich Valley most{sportsmen have 
{to travel to find sporting facilities,
 the only exception being football.In  
 fact footballers are well served with 
 amateur teams in each village and a   
 Junior side in Stoneyburn.            
    Other sports don't fare so well.   
 Swimmers have to travel to Whitburn,  
 golfers to Bathgate, athletes to      
 Fauldhouse,gymnasts and rugby players 
 to Livingston.                        
    The local Community Centres have   
 offered a variety of sports in the    
 past but for a number of reasons      
 interest does not last long.          
    One bright spot is that plans are  
 afoot to build a floodlit,all-weather 
 pitch,suitable for tennis and         
 football, in Addiewell.               
                                       
                                       </content>
