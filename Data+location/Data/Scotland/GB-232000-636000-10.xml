		<content>{Dreghorn fire station}is manned by 50 
 firemen.Strangely nobody answers 999  
 phone calls,all the 999 calls go to   
 central control in Johnston and are   
 transferred to the nearest fire       
 station to the incident.When we       
 visited the fire station,they were    
 called out to a fire while we were    
 talking,and we saw the teleprinter    
 readout from Johnston.The{equipment   
 used,usually on a small fire,is a hose
 25m long,breathing equipment,torches  
 and ladders.It takes about 15 minutes 
 to put out a medium sized             
 fire.Carelessness by people with,chip 
 pans,electric fires and cigarette ends
 are how most fires start.In our school
 when the fire bell goes we all walk   
 out and line up in the playground.It  
 took 2 minutes 45 seconds to clear the
 school during our last drill.
