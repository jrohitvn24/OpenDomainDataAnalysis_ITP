		<title>02FARMING INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>     In our 4km x 3km block,farming is 
 the only 'industry' carried out.Within
 our area,we have seven farms as we    
 know them and one croft. For the      
 Doomsday Project, we looked closely at
 four of the farms. Their methods and  
 products have changed little apart    
 from the growing of barley. Growing of
 winter barley began four years ago.   
 Spring sown barley, we think, has been
 grown over the last fifteen years.    
 Before this, root crops,              
 particularly turnips, were grown. This
 died out about twenty years ago.
