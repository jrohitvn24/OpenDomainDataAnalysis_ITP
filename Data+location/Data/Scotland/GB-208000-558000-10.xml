		<content> This is essentially a dairy farming   
 district.The herds are either pure    
 Ayrshires- dehorned and brown and     
 white - or now more usually Ayrshire/ 
 Friesian crosses more often black and 
 white.Herds are 100-200 milking cows  
 and followers(young stock). Milk      
 production is modern and mechanised   
 with milking parlours. Milk is piped  
 to refridgerated tanks and then it is 
 collected daily by bulk tankers and   
 taken to the Galloway Creamery in     
 Stranraer for processing and liquid   
 milk sales. The land is farmed to     
 produce cattle feed, mainly grass for 
 grazing. Silage is very common but hay
 is less so now due to the wet climate.
 Some barley is grown whereas oats were
 the usual cereal crop fifty years ago.
 Straw is used for bedding animals.    
 Turnips and peas are for cattle food. 
 Main crop potatoes are a cash crop.   </content>
