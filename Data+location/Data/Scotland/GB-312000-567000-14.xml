		<title>14The Sawmill-1</title>
		<content> The{forest and sawmill}on Kinmount    
 estates are run by the head forester  
 Alec McDermott. Alec has to be quite  
 fit for his job as he has a large area
 of forest to look after. The full     
 extent of his job ranges from doing   
 paperwork to sawing logs.             
                                       
 The sawmill has a{yearly output of 670
{tonnes}of wood. This wood is sold to  
 mines for pit props, to farms as      
 fencing, to pallet makers and         
 furniture makers.                     
                                       
 A lot of machinery is involved in the 
 processing to prepare the wood for    
 market. First it is cut and trimmed by
 chainsaw then it is taken to the      
 sawmill where it goes through three   
 saws. It is then taken by truck to    
 market.                               
                                       </content>
