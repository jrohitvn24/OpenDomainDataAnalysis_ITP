{*************************             
  The oldest school,Whitletts Primary, 
 dates back to 1873,when Whitletts was 
 a mining community in its own right.A 
 new extension was added in 1908.The   
 school now provides education for 150 
 pupils and has 8 teachers,including   
 the head teacher.                     
  All three schools provide a blend of 
 traditional and more recent forms of  
 curriculum, which enable the children 
 to go on educational visits,to take up
 hobbies which interest them and to    
 work with computers.                  
{               ******                 
  During the evenings and at week-ends,
 Dalmilling School is used for clubs by
 the Community Education Service.Also a
 summer play scheme is run each year.  
 These are enjoyable and worthwhile    
 community activities.                 </content>
