		<content> this are inccludes almost two-thirds  
 the island poulation (130 in all) also
 both churches, the school, most       
 crofts, best loch fishing, island road
 system, the harbour and pier, the     
 coup, the doctor, shop-post           
 ofice-petrol pump, two farms, and the 
 island hotel - the latter employs up  
 to 15 people in season and is the     
 single largest employer.  An "advance 
 factory" has just been completed, and 
 mains electricity and mains water     
 system have been introducted to this  
 island recently with EEC aid. A       
 home-improvement scheme has jut been  
 complted, the total imput amounting to
 over Â£50,000 per house and securing   
 the future of the island for the      
 foreseeable future.  There is no      
 television broadcast to Colonsay and a
 ferry only 3 times weekly - lack of   
 com'ation remain the biggest problem. </content>
