		<content> Near the Montrose Road crossroads     
 there is a large{standing stone}in a  
 field and it is a very unusual one.   
 Unlike the other stones in the area it
 is a Pre-historic stone and,          
 therefore, has no carvings on it. It  
 has, however, been noted in the       
 archives of the Museum.               
 In the corner of the Montreathmont    
 Forest nearest the School several{    
{Bronze Age}cists have been found.     
 Other Bronze Age relics have been     
 found in many places in the area.     
 About 30 years ago a farmer turned up 
 a vase when he was ploughing. When    
 examined by experts it was found to   
 have belonged to the{Beaker People.   
 This now reposes in the Museum in     
 Dundee.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
