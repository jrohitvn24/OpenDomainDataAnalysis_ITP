		<content>   There is an hourly bus service      
 provided by Western S.M.T. connecting 
 Auchinleck to surrounding towns and   
 villages.Recently the same company    
 introduced a{Cityliner}bus linking    
 Glasgow to Dumfries by a fast (limited
 stop) service This bus runs 4 times a 
 day and Auchinleck is a stopping      
 point.                                
   A new railway station was opened in 
 Auchinleck in 1984 with a direct link 
 to Glasgow and Dumfries.Only some     
 passenger trains stop and fares have  
 to be paid on the train.              
   Both bus and rail companies offer   
 concessionary fares for old age       
 pensioners outwith peak periods.      
   There is also a Coach Hire business 
 based in the village.
