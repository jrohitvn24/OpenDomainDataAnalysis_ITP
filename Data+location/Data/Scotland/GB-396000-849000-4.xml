		<content> There are of course, many problems    
 with growing plantation of trees but  
 the wind in these parts can cause     
 severe damage to hectares of the      
 forest.  If trees are lost due to     
 damage by gales they loose their value
 and are more difficult to cut up and  
 handle generally.  Oaks and beeches   
 are the hardwoods found round the     
 borders of the existing estate.       
    Thinning out of the trees started  
 twenty five years ago.  After this,   
 the trees were thinned every 5 years  
 until they reach forty years of age.  
 They reach a top height of 30 metres. 
    Apart from the problem created by  
 the elements, there are other forces  
 at work which can damage the trees.   
 The fungus, Butt Rot, is a relic of   
 the old woodland site.  It attacks the
 roots and central column of the tree _
 the heart wood.                       </content>
