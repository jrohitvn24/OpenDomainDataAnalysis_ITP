		<title>07Fine Fare Bus</title>
		<content>    The bus leaves every Tuesday at    
 10.10am, arriving Inverness around    
 11am.{Shoppers travel free}but are    
 required to spend a{minimum of Â£5}in  
 the Superstore. Highland Omnibuses are
 paid by the store for transporting the
 people. There are normally between 30 
 and 40 people from Grantown using the 
 bus. These figures rise before        
 Christmas and during the school       
 holidays.                             
    Our survey showed{more people      
{disapproved of this bus than approved.
 They thought that trade in Grantown   
 shops would suffer, leading to some   
 closing, leaving people who could not 
 travel worse off than before. Those   
 who did approve found it cheaper than 
 Fine Fare in Grantown and enjoyed the 
 trip to Inverness shops, especially   
 pensioners who found they could save  
 money on their groceries.             </content>
