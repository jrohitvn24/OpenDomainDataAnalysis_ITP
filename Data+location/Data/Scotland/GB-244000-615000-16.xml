		<title>16LITTLEMILL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school is a Primary school dealing
 with the first seven years of the     
 children's education. During this time
 the aim of the school is to develop   
 the child to the best that his or her 
 abilities will allow with work that is
 appropriate to their age aptitude and 
 ability. The school is not only       
 interested in the academic development
 of the child but in the development of
 the whole person through social       
 education and a growing awareness of  
 the need to co-operate with others in 
 everyday life. This side of           
 development is very important in a    
 small community to prepare the        
 children for situations they may      
 encounter in the larger world outside.
