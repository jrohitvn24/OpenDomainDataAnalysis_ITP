   Fochabers,being a dormitory village,
 has a number of supply shops namely   
 three grocers,two butchers,two bakers,
 a chemist,a fish and chip shop,a      
 clothes retailer,a shoe shop,a fabric 
 and also a woolshop and an electrical 
 supplier. These along with the petrol 
 filling station serve the everyday    
 requirements of the local public. A   
 trip to Elgin would be the norm for   
 the weekly supplies.                  
   There are other establishments aimed
 not so much at the locals but at the  
 passing visitor or the tourist. These 
 include four antique dealers and a    
 reastaurant and gallery selling a     
 variety of souveniers. Many visitors  
 also pay a visit to the Nursery which 
 is a garden centre supplying a wide   
 range of materials for the outdoor and
 indoor horticulturist.                </content>
