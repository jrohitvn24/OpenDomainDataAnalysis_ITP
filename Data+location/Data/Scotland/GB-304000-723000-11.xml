		<content> On this "light" land, cereals are     
 grown and Loanleven produces barley   
 for malting for the production of     
 whiskey, barley for brewing for the   
 production of beer, oats for animal   
 feeding and some for milling into     
 oatmeal. We saw fields which were     
 bright yellow with the flowers of oil 
 seed rape, a crop which has only been 
 grown for a few years. The seed is    
 milled and the oil extracted for the  
 manufacture of margarine and cooking  
 oil.                                  
 We were shown the Charolais and       
 Limousin bulls which are used on the  
 farm to breed Hereford, Friesian and  
 Angus cows. About one hundred cattle  
 are produced each year to supply beef,
 and sixty to seventy calves are fed   
 over the winter in the cattle shed.
