		<title>06Stray dogs in Kirkcaldy</title>
		<content> People who get a puppy for Christmas  
 or their birthday love their little   
 pet until it gets older when the owner
 gets bored having to take it walks and
 feed it. Then they just abandon their 
 dog in the streets. The dog starts to 
 cause trouble raking in buckets or    
 even bites someone. That is why we now
 have 'Dog Patrols' going about picking
 up strays. In the last year there were
 26 stray dogs picked up in the streets
 in Kirkcaldy. These dogs are being    
 taken to kennels where people can come
 to see if their lost dog has been     
 picked up. However some have to be put
 to sleep. The other problem is that   
 some owners just put their dogs out to
 roam free and they leave a mess on the
 pavements or in gardens where children
 play.
