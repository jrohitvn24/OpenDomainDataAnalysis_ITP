		<content> Drumblade is a rural area in          
 Aberdeenshire approximately four miles
 from Huntly. This small area consists 
 of only one school. There are no shops
 in the area. Drumblade is a rather    
 hilly part of country. There are many 
 farms in the area. Drumblade is a     
 peaceful place apart from R.A.F. jets 
 that occasionally go past.The weather 
 in Drumblade can be quite dodgy with a
 taste of most kinds (mostly damp).    
 Drumblade farmland is mostly crops and
 grazing. There is one dairy farm in   
 the four by three kilometre square.   
 there isn't many houses in the area   
 apart from a row of houses at         
 Brideswell.
