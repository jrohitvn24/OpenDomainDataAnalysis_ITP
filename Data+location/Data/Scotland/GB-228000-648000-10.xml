		<title>10DALRY KARATE CLUBS</title>
		<content> There are two clubs, one at Roche with
 about 40 members and one at Dalry     
 Primary with about 100. Most train    
 three times a week.  Roche have four  
 "black belts," Dalry Primary,         
 eleven.Every three months there is a  
 grading when you learn some basic     
 blocks and move on to a kata then some
 fighting.If you pass , you move up to 
 a higher belt. The belts are white,   
 yellow, green, purple, purple and     
 white, brown, brown and white, black, 
 and then you are a master.            
 We need more adults to help us set up 
 leisure activities. I feel that, with 
 unemployment increasing, how to use   
 free time is vitally important.  If   
 young people cannot find something    
 constructive to do, they will find    
 something destructive.  Some of my    
 friends, with nothing to do, hang     
 about and get into trouble.           </content>
