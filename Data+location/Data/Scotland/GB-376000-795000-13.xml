		<title>13Wildlife in Woodlands</title>
		<content> There is lots of wildlife in our area,
 like rabbits,foxes,deer, otters,frogs 
 and toads,salmon and many birds.      
 Rabbits make their homes on open areas
 or at the edges of woods. They also   
 like sandy areas because it is easier 
 for them to make their burrows.Foxes  
 live in dens in the forests and hunt  
 open areas.They hunt things like      
 rabbits,hens from farms and young     
 deer.Farmers and gamekeepers shoot    
 them and trap them.Salmon live in the 
 fresh,clean waters of the River Dee.  
 Fishermen fish for them.The salmon go 
 up river every year. They jump very   
 high out of the water.Roe deer live in
 forests and graze in open areas.They  
 destroy trees by rubbing their antlers
 on the bark. There are lots of game   
 birds like pheasants and partridges in
 the area. The pheasants are shot for  
 sport.                                </content>
