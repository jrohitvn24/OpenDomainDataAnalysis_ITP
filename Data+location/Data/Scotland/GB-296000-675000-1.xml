		<title>01Introduction To Our Block</title>
		<content>   The block encompases land in both   
 Lothian and Central Region _ the      
 border being the River Avon.          
   There are two main resedential areas
 _ the smaller one being the village of
 Whitecross and the greater the Western
 end of Linlithgow and Linlithgow      
 Bridge. Much of the latter housing is 
 in the form of private estates but    
 there is also a fair percentage of    
 local authority housing.              
   Whitecross is a small village which 
 grew up around the brickworks but now 
 very few people from the village find 
 employment there.                     
   Otherwise the block consists of     
 farmland much of which is arable or   
 rough grazing.                        
   The main Glasgow to Edinburgh       
 railway line runs through the block as
 does the M.9. motorway and the Union  
 Canal.                                </content>
