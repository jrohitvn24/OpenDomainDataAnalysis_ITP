		<content>    In the{Bank}there are 18 people    
 employed, 10 men and 8 women. The bank
 staff work even when the bank is      
 closed in the morning before 9.30am   
 and after 3.30pm. On average the bank 
 has{1000 customers}each week, but they
 deal with less customers since they   
 put the "Auto-teller" outside.        
    There are 400 children in the      
 village who are keen to save their    
 money and join the{Supersavers Club.  
    The building in Cotton Street is   
 the main bank for the area and there  
 are branches in the villages round    
 about.                                
    Similarly, the{Post Office}serves  
 the area and all the mail is "sorted" 
 in a special "sorting house" behind   
 the Post Office. Pensions are paid at 
 the Post Office and some people keep  
 their money in the Post Office Savings
 Bank.                                 </content>
