   On our visit to {HIGHTOWN OF CRAIGS}
 ,which we have detailed on Page 5 and 
 6,Steven asked what forms of          
 communications there were.He was told 
 by Mr. Telfer that there was no bus   
 service or visiting vans such as      
 bakers,butchers e.t.c.Their only forms
 of communication are  the post van    
 which comes once a day and the milk   
 tanker which comes twice a day.It was 
 explained to us that if any of the    
 local people wanted anything in the   
 way of supplies then they had to find 
 their own means of transport to reach 
 Dumfries which is approximately 5     
 miles from Hightown of Craigs.
