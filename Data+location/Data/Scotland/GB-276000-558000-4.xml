 The gamekeeper has to control         
 animals which kill his stock.         
 Foxes and mink may kill a hundred     
 young pheasants at a time, just for   
 the pleasure of killing.              
 During a year, the gamekeeper kills   
 forty or fifty adult foxes and about  
 sixty cubs.                           
 He also kills about ten or twelve     
 mink.                                 
 Other predators are weasels, stoats,  
 rats and birds of prey, although they 
 usually kill for food.                
                                       
 Rabbits are not a great problem as    
 their numbers are small.              
 Deer destroy the bark on young trees, 
 but there are not a great many        
 of them.                              
 Badgers, also, live in this area.     </content>
