		<title>12Stock and Arable Farming</title>
		<content> Stock and Arable farming is the second
 most common type of farming next to   
 Hill and Upland farming in the area   
 round Torphichen. Stock and Arable    
 farms rear beef calves until they are 
 fully grown and they sell them for a  
 profit. There are quite a lot of      
 different breeds these are Fresian,   
 Aberdeen Angus, Limosin, Herefords and
 Charolais. The farmers also grow crops
 to feed the animals. They grow Barley,
 Hay, Wheat and Corn but they normaly  
 grow more than they need so they can  
 sell the extra for a profit. Most     
 farmers prefer hedges and fences as a 
 stock proof boundery. In this area it 
 used to be all dry stane dykes but it 
 cost to much too repair them nowadays 
 at Â£7 a yard whereas fences cost only 
 Â£3 a yard to erect.
