		<content> After recorder it is time for break. I
 play on the climbing frame.  At       
 11.05am we go inside and do maths     
 until lunch.  We go outside to play   
 after we have had our lunch.  I go and
 play on the climbing frame again.  Mr.
 Scott comes out for us at 1.30pm.  We 
 go inside and have theme until 3.00pm.
  We go through to the Girls' Bathroom 
 and change into our shorts for gym.   
  We have gym until 3.30pm.  Some of   
 the girls stay on and go to Netball   
 Club.  Then it finishes at 4.00pm.  I 
 go home on my bike.  When I get home I
 play outside or watch the television. 
 At 5.15pm when dad comes home we have 
 our tea.  After tea it is time for    
 Guides.  At Guides we practice for a  
 concert.  Guides finish at 8.30pm.
