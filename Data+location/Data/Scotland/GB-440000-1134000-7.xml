		<content>{Games children play at school.}       
      We sometimes play{"Stick in the  
{Mud".}A catcher is chosen. When a     
 child has been caught by the catcher, 
 he stands with his hands and legs     
 spread out. He can be "freed" by      
 another going under his legs.         
      Another game is{"Fishes in the   
{Net".}One person is the catcher, who, 
 having caught someone, joins hands    
 with him. The game continues until    
 everyone is caught. The last one to   
 be caught is the new catcher.         
      We play lots of catching         
 games, football, tennis, rounders and 
 we skip to rhymes such as :           
                                       
  Two little sausages,                 
  Frying in a pan,                     
  One went pop,                        
  And the other went bang.
