		<title>05CROSSE &amp; BLACKWELL</title>
		<content> In 1829,2 apprentices called Edmund   
 Crosse and Thomas Blackwell took over 
 a firm for Â£600 and so started Crosse 
 and Blackwells.The firm expanded      
 rapidly and was soon known worldwide  
 for its high quality goods.Although   
 there are many branches of this       
 factory overseas,the main production  
 is in London and Peterhead.In the late
 60's Peterhead's Crosse and Blackwells
 employed about 1000 people.Nowadays   
 this is under 400.However, as the     
 factory is expanding to make room for 
 "high-tech" machinery on the factory  
 floor,the number of jobs shall soon   
 increase.                             
      Factory jobs range from the      
 Personnel Department to the factory   
 floor,from laboratory workers checking
 food standards,to buyers who try to   
 purchase the best,highest quality     
 goods,for example, beans from America.</content>
