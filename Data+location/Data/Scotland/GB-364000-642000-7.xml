		<title>07HOW GORDON HAS CHANGED.</title>
		<content> 1861 The town was just one long       
 street.It had a railway station.The   
 popultion was around 931.180 pupils   
 attended school=4 classes of about 45 
 pupils. Two thirds of the houses had  
 two or less windows.There were many   
 trades eg fishing tackle maker,tailor,
 milliner,tea dealer etc.              
 1985 Today Gordon is one long street  
 with two new housing estates.All the  
 houses have plenty of windows.the     
 population is about 600.Compared to   
 100 years ago  housing conditions are 
 very good.There is no railway but it  
 doesn't matter because lots of people 
 have cars,bikes etc.Families today are
 smaller so there are only fifty pupils
 at the school.The new school was built
 ten years ago.Nowadays there are only 
 four shops.This is because people go  
 to town for a better choice.
