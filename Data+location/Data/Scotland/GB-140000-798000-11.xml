		<content>{Kilmory Glen}is the centre of a long  
 term study of red deer.Island deer are
 culled annually but in 1972 culling in
 here stopped.The population has almost
 doubled making it possible to investi_
 gate effects population density has on
 the breeding success of the deer &amp; on 
 their feeding &amp; social behaviour &amp; the
 indentification of causes of variation
 in the breeding success between each  
 deer. Recognition of individual deer  
 is essential. Natural variations in   
 facial characteristics &amp; coat markings
 are used &amp; many are caught &amp; marked   
 with coloured ear tags &amp; collars.Their
 capture also provides an opportunity  
 to collect weights, measurements &amp;    
 blood samples.Information is collected
 by detailed observation of behaviour &amp;
 regular censuses. Censuses taken over 
 the rest of Rhum allow comparisons of 
 low population with this high density.</content>
