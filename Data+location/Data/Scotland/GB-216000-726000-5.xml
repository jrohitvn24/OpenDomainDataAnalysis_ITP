		<title>05TOURISM IN DALMALLY</title>
		<content> From a tourist point of view there are
 many reasons for visiting the Dalmally
 area.                                 
  The first of these would be to visit 
 and investigate the various historical
 points of interest. These include     
 churches,monuments, bridges, old      
 villages.                             
  The second would be hillwalking.     
 Around Dalmally there are several     
 peaks of varying heights which can be 
 tackled according to the experience of
 the walker. The most notable of these 
 is Ben Cruachan 1101metres high which 
 is quite a challenge for any walker or
 climber.                              
  Thirdly the area is popular for      
 fishermen. Within the immediate       
 vicinity there are rivers and lochs   
 rich in both salmon and trout. Permits
 of course must be obtained before     
 using most waters.                    </content>
