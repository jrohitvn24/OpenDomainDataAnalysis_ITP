		<title>18HOUSING IN BREICH VALLEY</title>
		<content>    The bulk of housing in the Breich  
 Valley is owned by the Local         }
 Authority.In Addiewell there is one   
 large mansion,called Loganlea         
 House,situated at the top of the      
 village.Apart from that the only      
 private housing is that which has been
 bought from the council or the one    
 remaining miners'row where the houses 
 have all been modernised and sold.It  
 is much the same story in Breich      
 although in Stoneyburn there has been 
 a bit of private building during the  
 last ten years.                       
    Most of the Local Authority housing
 in all three villages is post         
 war.Stoneyburn has the biggest variety
 of housing including a number of      
 blocks of flats.
