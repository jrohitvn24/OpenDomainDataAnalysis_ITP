		<title>14AIRFIELD West Forres</title>
		<content> This airfield is now owned and used   
 privately by Sir Hector Laing,        
 Chairman of United Biscuits,and many  
 famous people have landed here when   
 visiting his estate.These include     
 Margaret Thatcher.The early history of
 the airfield is very                  
 interesting.During the war it was     
 known as Forres Airfield and it had a 
 very important role in the defence    
 system.It was one of the main         
 operational training units-19         
 O.T.U.Pilots,navigators etc. who had  
 trained at separate units came        
 together for the first time to fly    
 Lancaster Bombers.They used very old  
 Whitley Bombers for training and there
 were many accidents during training   
 flights.Because of wartime security   
 very few people realise the vital part
 played by Forres Airfield.
