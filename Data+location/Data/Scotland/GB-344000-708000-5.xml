		<content>    The majority of houses are         
 privately owned either as owner       
 occupier or tenant.There are only two 
 council houses,the police house and   
 the roadmans house.                   
   The types of houses in our area     
 consist of old stone built            
 cottages,detached,semi-detached and   
 terraced.The terraced houses are now  
 mainly derelict.                      
   Houses are heated by coal fire,     
 electric heating or gas central       
 heating. As there is no mains gas     
 supply,gas is stored in               
 cylinders,propane gas.But electricity 
 is probably used the most for heating.
   All houses are connected to the main
 supply for water and sewage.
