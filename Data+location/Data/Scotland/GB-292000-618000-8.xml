		<content> Crawford Parish Church is linked with 
 the village churches in Elvanfoot,    
 Leadhills and Wanlockhead.The minister
 for the four churches is Reverend     
 Baillie.He lives at present in        
 Leadhills as the manse in Crawford has
 just been sold.A new manse is being   
 built in Crawford.                    
 The church in Elvanfoot is soon to    
 close and the people will then worship
 in Crawford Church.                   
 Crawford Church was built in 1975.It  
 is a lovely building with some very   
 attractive stained glass windows.     
 Before the present church building was
 built the church was on another site  
 near the river.At this time it was    
 called St.Constantine's Church.       
 Reverend Baillie visits our school    
 once a fortnight to take our school   
 assembly.
