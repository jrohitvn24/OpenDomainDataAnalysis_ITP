		<title>04Ayr Cattle Market.</title>
		<content>     Ayr market has been on its present
 site for almost 100 years and, in     
 spite of a need to expand, will remain
 so due to the prohibitive cost of     
 rebuilding.  The market, which serves 
 most of South West Scotland has become
 one of the largest{fatstock markets}in
 the country with a throughput of about
 90000 cattle, 14000 calves and 130000 
 sheep per year.  In the past Ayr dealt
 mainly with dairy cattle but in recent
 years the trend has been towards      
 beef.  Ayr market is growing steadily 
 and surveys show larger markets like  
 Ayr continuing to grow while markets  
 in smaller towns are disappearing.    
   With approximately 2000 people      
 coming into town on each of the two   
 market days each week a great deal of 
 trade is brought to Ayr which in turn 
 plays an important part in the town's 
 prosperity.                           </content>
