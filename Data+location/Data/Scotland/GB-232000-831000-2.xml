		<title>02ECOLOGY : CANNICH AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
 Because of the sheltered position of  
 the village of Cannich the{climate}can
 range from being very mild in summer  
 with severe weather often with        
 extremely heavy snowfalls and hard    
 frosts in winter. Thick mist often    
 lies over the area around the River   
 Glass which runs through the Strath.  
                                       
 The{land type }in the surrounding area
 is mainly either woodland or rocky    
 hills interspersed with peat bogs.    
                                       
{Pollution}is virtually non-existent.  
 There are no factories or quarries,   
 nor is there any substantial traffic {
 in the area, the smoke from household 
 fires being the only sign of          
 pollution although most homes use     
 electricity as a means of heating.
