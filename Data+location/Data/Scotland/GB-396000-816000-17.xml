		<title>17SALMON FISHING IN BALMEDIE</title>
		<content> Our group discovered that salmon      
 fishing was becoming more difficult to
 make a living at. There is now a      
 shortage of salmon in the sea off     
 Balmedie. The size of fish caught is  
 between 4lbs and 15lbs. The salmon are
 caught in two different kinds of net. 
 The Stake net lies on the beach and   
 fish swim into it themselves and      
 become trapped in the maze of nets.   
 The Drag net is pulled by a boat and  
 the fish are trapped in the net. The  
 fishermen also catch flat fish and    
 sometimes catch mackeral. The Stake   
 nets are about 36ft long 20ft wide and
 the area of the net is about 30 square
 yards. The salmon is sold to fish     
 merchants, it is very expensive, it   
 can cost Â£2 per pound.
