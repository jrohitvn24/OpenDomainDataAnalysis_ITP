		<title>01Landscape of Forteviot.</title>
		<content> Forteviot the once Pictish Capital of 
 Scotland,lies six miles South West of 
 Perth on the B9112 and five miles West
 of Bridge of Earn along the B935.     
 The Ochil hills are South of our      
 village.The River May lying West of   
 Forteviot flows North from the Ochil  
 hills into the River Earn which in its
 turn flows East into the River Tay.   
 The land of Strath Earn is very       
 fertile mixed farmland owned mainly by
 The Laird and his son who own most of 
 the land,letting it out mainly to     
 estate workers.                       
 Today's village is not the original   
 one.Between 1925-1926 the old line of 
 cottages was pulled down and the new  
 courtyard of terraced houses, designed
 by the Laird himself, erected.
