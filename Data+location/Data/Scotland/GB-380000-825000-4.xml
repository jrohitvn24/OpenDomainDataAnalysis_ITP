		<content> Oldmeldrum is a burgh of Barony, still
 hereditary property of the Laird of   
 Meldrum who lives on the historic     
 estate of Meldrum House north of the  
 burgh. Although he has the right to   
 hold a weekly market, there has been  
 none since the World War of 1939-45.  
 Meldrum House is run as an hotel      
 specializing in gourmet food, often   
 prepared by the laird himself. Farmers
 from the surrounding agricultural area
 do their weekly shopping in the       
 hypermarkets and department stores of 
 Aberdeen, 20 miles to the south. Local
 shopkeepers still do a regular trade  
 in spite of the competition and there 
 are three carpentery businesses, two  
 plumbing contractors, a slater and two
 electricians fully employed on local  
 work. Two butchers' shops thrive in a 
 meat-eating area famed for its prime  
 cuts of Aberdeen-Angus beef.          </content>
