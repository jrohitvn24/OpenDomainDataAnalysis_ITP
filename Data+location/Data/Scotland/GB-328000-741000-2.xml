 In and around Newtyle there are some  
 very interesting places to visit.There
 is{Kinpurnie Tower}which long ago was 
 used as an observatory. It was built  
 by{James McKenzie,Lord Privy Seal of  
{Scotland.}He was interested in        
 astronomy.                            
   {Kinpurnie Castle}Gardens are       
 sometimes open to the public.Other    
 things like the{Keillor Standing      
{Stone,Privy's Prap and Hatton Castle  
 are all part of Newtyle's History.The 
 Standing Stone has a wolf or bear,a Z-
 rod and spectacles marked on it.I     
 think it is pre-Christian in age as   
 there is no cross on it.It is to be   
 found at G.R.373398.Privy's Prap was  
 built as a meridianal marker due south
 from{Belmont Castle.}It too was built 
 by James McKenzie.Privy means private 
 and Prap means stack.(S.Mitchell P7)  </content>
