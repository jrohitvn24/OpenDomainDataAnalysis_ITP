		<content> In our local{health clinic}here in    
 Bellfield babies are taken by their   
 mothers to be{weighed}and have        
{injections}to protect them against    
{disease. Children}from Bellfield      
 Primary School have their teeth       
 checked regularly by the{dentist}at   
 the clinic. At the clinic there are   
{doctors}and dentists available for    
 everyone to see.{Many older people}go 
 to the clinic to see the{chiropodist  
 to have their feet checked. Some are  
 not able to do their housework or look
 after themselves properly. Sometimes a
 vistor called a{"Home Help"}from the  
 Health Service visits these old people
 to help with housework and shopping. A
{"Meals on Wheels"}service is also     
 available to make sure that old people
 are properly fed.
