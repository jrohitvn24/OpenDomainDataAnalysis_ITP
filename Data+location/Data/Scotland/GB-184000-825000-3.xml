		<content> Well over half the number of trees    
 planted in our area are Sitka spruce. 
 Larch,pine and Norway spruce are also 
 planted.Broadleaved trees are not     
 planted on any great scale because    
 they do not grow as quickly as        
 conifers.The climate is more suited to
 conifers.These conifers are cut down  
 when they are 40 to 50 years old.The  
 logs are sent to Fort William and the 
 small pieces of wood go for fire wood.
 When the trees are felled the land is 
 replanted with trees again.There are  
 over twenty people employed in the    
 forest.They work on felling, planting,
 weeding and fencing. Some are         
 employed on wildlife control. There   
 are two foresters.They have the job of
 organising the work for the men and   
 then checking that it is done         
 properly.
