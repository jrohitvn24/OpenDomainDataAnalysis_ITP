		<content>   Most of the farmland in our area is 
 owned by the{Munro Ferguson}family of{
{Raith Estate.}The whole Estate        
 consists of 500 acres of woodland and 
 2000 acres of arable land, although it
 is not all in our area.               
{ Raith House}was built in 1695 and was
 bought by the Fergusons in 1725 .The  
 woods were planted in 1785 and the    
 lake was built about the same time.   
  Six workers are employed on the      
 Estate to look after the{beef cattle  
 which are reared and fattened there   
 and to farm the crops which include   
{wheat, barley, oilseed rape, peas,    
{potatoes }and{Brussels sprouts.       
  As{pheasants}are reared in the       
 woodland two gamekeepers are employed 
 to look after these. The Laird also   
 employs a factor, an estate joiner and
 a housekeeper.
