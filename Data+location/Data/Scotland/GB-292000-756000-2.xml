		<content> Running like a spine through our area,
 as it does for Scotland ,is the major 
 trunk road, the A9, connecting        
 Inverness and the north to Edinburgh  
 and points south.                     
 Until quite recently it was also a    
 nightmare to drive , particularly in  
 the summer. Although leading  to      
 prosperity for the various stopping   
 places,of which Pitlochry was one,it  
 also led to a main street clogged with
 lorries and fumes,with four mile      
 queues and nowhere to park .          
 But the Pitlochry by-pass was opened  
 in 1980, having taken two years to    
 build, and costing approximately Â£1   
 million per kilometre to construct. On
 average 10,000 tonnes of vehicles     
 travel the by-pass daily. The road has
 increased the tourist trade with      
 visitors staying for longer periods in
 the summer due to ease of access.     </content>
