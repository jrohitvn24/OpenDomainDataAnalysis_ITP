		<title>09INDUSTRY TOURISM AND CRAFT</title>
		<content> An important industry in our area is  
 tourism. Many shops and hotels depend 
 on a busy tourist season. The tourist 
 officer is based in Dornoch and there 
 is a tourist office to help visitors  
 find suitable places to stay. The     
 Highland Regional Council has helped  
 set up an industrial estate on the    
 site of the disused station. These are
 small units which are mainly used as  
 craft workshops. We went on a visit   
 the workshop 'Treecraft', which makes 
 boomerangs, shinty sticks and garden  
 furniture. The boomerangs are sold all
 over the world. Another craft workshop
 'Highland Armoury' make copies of old 
 weapons such as targes, claymores and 
 dirks . At 'Dornoch Glass' you can see
 glass flowers being made.  Grants of  
 Dornoch is a well known local butcher.
 They send meat to shops in Inverness, 
 Glasgow and Edinburgh.                </content>
