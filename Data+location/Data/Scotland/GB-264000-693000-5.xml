		<content>{Andrew Rennie}was born in 1890, one of
 four children, in a house (now        
 demolished) at the top of{Station Brae
 He remembers a very different Kippen, 
 dirt roads and fewer people. He       
 attended school in the{Village Hall   
 until the age of 14 when he left to   
 work in{The Smiddy.}For work he wore a
 blue flannel shirt,trousers and a     
 leather apron split up the middle to  
 make shoeing horses easier. Andrew was
 the village blacksmith for over 50    
 years. He enjoyed his work and        
 described the many tasks including    
 singeing sheep's heads for the "toffs"
 for broth! A smiddy was a fascinating 
 place for the children and he often   
 had an audience, on whom he enjoyed   
 playing tricks!                       
 Andrew Rennie died,aged 95,just two   
 months after coming up to school to   
 give us his fascinating life-story.   </content>
