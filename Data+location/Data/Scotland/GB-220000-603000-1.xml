		<title>01SOUTH AND EAST OF TURNBERRY</title>
		<content>  Turnberry is a small seaside village 
 (pop. approx. 200), south of Turnberry
 Hotel with its 2 world-famous golf    
 courses. The housing is mixed; half is
 council owned, some of the private    
 houses are luxurious, many of the     
 owners travelling to Girvan, Ayr etc. 
 for employment. Local employment being
 in the hotel of on local farms. The   
 farms are medium-sized on fairly hilly
 land, mainly engaged in cattle and    
 sheep rearing. The fields are divided 
 by the hedges, and there are some     
 small streams and copses breaking up  
 the landscape. Apart from an increased
 use of fertilisers the land use is    
 traditional for the west coast of     
 Scotland, as are the farm buildings.  
 Apart from the 2 main roads the roads 
 are single track, winding, but well   
 signposted. The beach, which is sandy 
 and rocky, is not easily accessible   </content>
