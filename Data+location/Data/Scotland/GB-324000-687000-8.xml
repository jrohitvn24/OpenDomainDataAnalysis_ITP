		<title>08SEAFIELD COLLIERY, KIRKCALDY</title>
		<content> Seafield Colliery is the deepest mine 
 in Scotland and one of the largest    
 undersea mines in Europe.             
 All of the tunnels run under Kirkcaldy
 Bay, and in fact Seafield is linked to
 its sister colliery, Frances, in the  
 north of Kirkcaldy by undersea        
 tunnels.                              
 There are three main tunnels 1\-2     
 miles long, as well as a large number 
 of smaller tunnels. Water continually 
 seeps into the tunnels and, of course,
 has to be pumped clear. The deepest   
 tunnel in Seafield is 1000 metres     
 below the surface, at the deepest     
 point.                                
 There are two shafts each 600 metres  
 deep. One of these is used to bring up
 the coal, and the other to transport  
 supports and other materials as well  
 as the miners themselves.
