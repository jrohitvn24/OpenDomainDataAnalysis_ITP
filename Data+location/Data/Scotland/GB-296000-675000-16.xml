		<title>16Linlithgow's Local Paper.</title>
		<content>   Our local newspaper is the Journal  
 and Gazette.Here are some reports from
 the 2nd of May 1985's issue.          
   The establishment of a link between 
 Linlithgow and the Edinburgh Festival 
 is in the news.The week-long Festival 
 Link will include tours,trips,        
 exhibitions,son et lumiere and an     
 enactment of a 17th century civil war 
 engagement at the Peel.               
   Another article is about the        
 government plans to privatise the bus 
 service.Concern is being expressed    
 that it will result in the            
 disappearance of all rural routes,    
 leaving Linlithgow with only a through
 service to Edinburgh and Falkirk.     
   Linlithgow Academy has been closed  
 for one day as teachers were on       
 strike.Industrial action is being     
 taken by members of the E.I.S.union to
 press for an independent pay review.  </content>
