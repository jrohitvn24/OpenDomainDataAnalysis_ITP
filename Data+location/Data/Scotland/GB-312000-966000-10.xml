		<title>10THE HARBOUR FISH SHOP</title>
		<content>  {The Harbour Fish Shop}is owned and  
 run by three generations of the MacKay
 family - Alex. MacKay senior, his son 
 and grandson. They buy fish at Wick,  
 Scrabster and Kinlochbervie.          
   Haddock at Â£1.30 a lb. is the       
 most popular fish sold and halibut the
 most expensive at Â£2.20.              
   Friday is the busiest day and on    
 Thursday afternoon we watched them    
 filleting the fish and putting it in  
 the refrigerator ready for sale. The  
 waste fish is used as bait for        
 lobsters and crabs. For smoking fish  
 there is a kiln where they hang the   
 fish on poles to smoke over night.    
   Lobster and salmon prices vary from 
 Â£2 to Â£5 per lb. Other prices are -   
 cod Â£1.25, whiting Â£1, plaice Â£1.50,  
 lemon sole Â£1.60, dabs Â£1, skate 80p, 
 herring 95p, monkfish 80p, crabs 40p, 
 kippers 86p, cockles 60p, winkles 50p.</content>
