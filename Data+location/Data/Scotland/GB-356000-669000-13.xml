		<content> Although apparently a rural           
 village,only a minority of the        
 residents make their living locally.  
 Of the villagers and those on the     
 farms in the area,5 are farm owners   
 and about 13 farm workers.About 18    
 profesional,13 managerial &amp; 5 clerical
 workers live in the area but nearly   
 all go at least as far as Haddington  
 to work.Only a few drive as far as    
 Edinburgh everyday.It is not possible 
 to go to work by public transport.    
 There are 18 retired householders,    
 half of whom held professional posts  
 There are about 38 housewives, some   
 of whom have part time jobs and some  
 have retired with their husbands.     
 Recently a number of younger          
 families have come to live in the     
 village and the children go in the    
 school buses to Yester Primary and    
 Haddington Secondary .                </content>
