 grazing but some crops such as potato 
 and barley are harvested. 7 farms are 
 in ths area plus a piggery and an     
 Animal By-Products factory.

 scheme in Britain is transforming     
 10.36 sq.km of derelict land into     
 Lochore Meadows Country Park. 200,000 
 young trees have been planted.        
       More tree-planting has been     
 done on the road to Glengraig.
