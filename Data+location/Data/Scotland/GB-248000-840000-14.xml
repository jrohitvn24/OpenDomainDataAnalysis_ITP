		<title>14THE SAWMILL IN KILTARLITY</title>
		<content> Balgate Sawmill is run by Ian Stewart 
 who has recently modernised the old   
 sawmill in the village.The wood for   
 the mill is felled within a 30km      
 radius of the village and is all soft 
 wood - Scots Pine,Douglas Fir,Spruce  
 and Larch.Nearly all the finished     
 timber is sent to England and Wales as
 "carcassing"for the building industry.
 About 15 people are employed,between  
 felling,transporting and in the mill  
 itself.                               
 As well as finished timber the mill   
 also produces pulp from "thinnings",  
 saplings which are thinned from       
 planted areas.Nothing is wasted.Bark  
 is used for horticultural composts,and
 sawdust for chipboard.                
 Most of the waste is exported to      
 Sweden for making into paper.
