		<content>   The present Greenock road was       
 begun in 1793, and the railway from   
 Paisley to Greenock started in 1841.  
 Bishopton Primary School is the oldest
 in the district, and was known as     
 Erskine Public School until 1971.     
   The village in the 1930's, unlike   
 nowadays, had a wide variety of shops.
 There was a grocer with a tea-room, a 
 dry-salter, 2 greengrocers, a draper  
 and later, a joiners. The post office 
 was located in the present newsagent's
 shop, while its present site was a    
 radio and hardware shop. The Bank of  
 Scotland was built for the British    
 Linen Bank, and the present chemist's 
 and hairdresser's was the Commercial  
 Bank. There were also a cobbler, a    
 fishmonger (later a bicycle shop), a  
 joiner/coffinmaker and a baker. The   
 major growth in the village coincided 
 with expansion of the R.O.F. in WW2.  </content>
