		<title>12THE TANNERY, KINGHORN (2)</title>
		<content> Since, of course, animal hides will   
 begin to decay, it is essential that  
 they are processed fairly quickly     
 after reaching the factory. Various   
 fungal diseases, eg.,hair slip, can   
 ruin a batch of hides.                
 The sheepskins are converted into     
 pickled pelts prior to sale. This     
 involves liming to remove the wool,   
 de-liming and treatment with ammonium 
 sulphate to soften the skin, and      
 pickling in salt, sulphuric acid and  
 an anti-mould for long term           
 protection. The wool removed is also  
 graded and sold.                      
 Cow hides are treated in a similar    
 manner before being sold to the       
 finishing tanner for the manufacture  
 of various grades of leather.         
 Lastly, the factory is also involved  
 in fat melting to produce high quality
 dripping.                             </content>
