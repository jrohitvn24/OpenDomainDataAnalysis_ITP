		<title>03My Home in Kylesku</title>
		<content>  Unilke most people I live in a hotel 
 all year round. My parents own Kylesku
 Hotel.                                
  The hotel started as a house for the 
 ferryman in the early nineteenth      
 century. Drovers bringing the black   
 cattle from the North West crossed    
 in the then ferry _ a rowing boat.    
 Sometimes these drovers would spend a 
 night with the ferryman and as the    
 years passed the  house became an inn.
  The majority of our guests spend a   
 week with us, enjoying the beautiful  
 scenery and the peace and quiet of the
 area. Many spend their time walking on
 the hills, fishing the many local     
 lochs and sailing, while others go in 
 their cars to deserted, sandy beaches.
  I enjoy living at the hotel, meeting 
 lots of people, but I prefer the      
 Winter months when the hotel becomes  
 my home again.                        </content>
