		<content> Mrs B lives in Lanark Road with her   
 husband. They have lived there for 61 
 years. They have three children but   
 they have all left home.              
 Mrs B enjoys gardening and her hobbies
 are sewing and baking, but she        
 dislikes household cleaning.          
 Mrs B shops at a supermarket and local
 shops because they are easy to get to 
 and she has got to know the           
 shopkeepers. She buys meat, rolls and 
 bread in these shops, but most of her 
 vegetables are home grown.            
 If it is a nice sunny day she and her 
 husband like to go for a walk or take 
 a ride in the car.                    
 If she was not at this interview she  
 would be washing dishes and cleaning  
 the kitchen.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
