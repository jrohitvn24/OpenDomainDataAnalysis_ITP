   Locharbriggs Primary School is one  
 of the major primary schools in the { 
{Heathhall}area.  It is situated       
 approx. 2 miles from Dumfries town    
 centre.  The school was built in 1954 
 and since then there have been further
 developments.                         
  The school has 420 pupils but        
 decreasing rapidly.  There are 16 full
 time teachers and 5 non teaching      
 staff.  The school has 17 classrooms  
 and a large playing area.  After      
 visiting the school, we found out what
 the pupils thought about the school.  
  We found that the pupils favourite   
 subject was Maths, and there was a    
 keen interest in sport.               
  The school has a large catchment area
 and many pupils have to come by bus.
