		<title>15Golf in Carnoustie</title>
		<content>   A great tourist attraction to many  
 golfers visiting Carnoustie is        
{Simpson's Golf Shop.}The shop has     
 nearly every golfing need you could   
 think of.Recently a new owner has     
 taken over the running of the shop,   
 until then it had always been owned by
 a local Carnoustie family.            
   The shop is 102 years old and in the
 beginning clubs were made there.Nowa- 
 days you can see old pictures of men  
 cleaning the clubs in the shop.       
   The dearest set of golf clubs that  
 the present owner has ever sold was   
 Â£410.00.The most popular set of clubs 
 which he sells are those made by      
 Swilken of St.Andrews,the home of     
 golf.However,for beginners,he re-     
 commends a good second-hand set.      
   On average about 80 customers a day 
 visit the shop. The average age is    
 about 40.Many are American women.     </content>
