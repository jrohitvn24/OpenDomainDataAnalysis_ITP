		<content> In a traffic count from 12.05 till    
 12.35 we found the most popular make  
 of cars was Vauxhall,then came Ford   
 ,British Leyland and Datsun.For vans  
 and lorries Ford was the most popular 
 with Vauxhall/ Bedford close behind.  
   Cars driving in the direction of    
 Carnock came up the road every three  
 minutes because of the traffic lights 
 just down the road.                   
  There are lots of private coach      
 companys such as                      
 Jacks,Allisons,Alexanders,Rennies and 
 Greyhound Coaches.All of these        
 companys are based in and around      
 Dunfermline.Curtis Motors is the main 
 Vauxhall dealer in the area selling   
 new and used cars.Norman Rollo Motors 
 is also based in Dunfermline selling  
 new and used Volvo cars.
