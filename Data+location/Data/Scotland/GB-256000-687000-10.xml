		<title>10Landscape west: FINTRY</title>
		<content> This area consists of rocks of the    
{Old Red Sandstone Age}and in parts of 
 the{Calciferous Sandstone Series.}They
 are generally soft and composed of    
 sandstone, shale, and limestone. Thus 
 the landscape is rolling with{boulder 
{clay}deposits forming excellent       
 examples of{drumlins.                 
{                                      
{The dominant landscape feature is the 
{River Endrick.}It flows through the   
 middle of the area east to west, in   
 large meanders. The wide flood plain, 
 made of alluvium, has good examples of
 river terraces. This part of the      
 valley often floods and so land near  
 the river usually has permanent grass.
 Several of the tributary streams, like
 Ballikinrain Burn, have carved quite  
 dramatic and steep sided glens.
