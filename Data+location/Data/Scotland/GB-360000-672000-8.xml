 Around us stand rows of farm  cottages
 in the midst of fields,or around the  
 main farm house.They are built of     
 local stone and most of them have     
 pantiled roofs.A few of the cottages  
 are derelict or even unoccupied but   
 mainly they are occupied by farm      
 workers or rented by people.          
  During our survey we found out that  
 the majority of houses are owner      
 occupied apart from the farm cottages.
 There are just 24 council houses in   
 this area,but there is a long term    
 plan for to build more council houses 
 in{Stenton}.                          
  Just about all the houses in{Stenton}
 and{Whittingehame}are built with local
 red stone and have pantiled roofs.The 
 council houses are 50 years old and   
 blend in well.
