		<title>14TRANSPORT - MOTORWAY</title>
		<content> The M90 by-passes Kelty immediately to
 the West.  The M90 has scarcely been  
 advantageous to the Kelty Community.  
 In fact, it could be said that it     
 facilitates the commuter to leave     
 Kelty and back home in the evening.   
 The Bus Services have been cut        
 drastically.  If there had'nt been the
 motorway the buses would have kept    
 more of their passengers.  Instead of 
 travelling by bus the commuters travel
 by car and carry colleagues with them.
 Again, the motorway has had adverse   
 results for trade, ASDA Superstore in 
 Dunfermline, and recently the FINE    
 FARE Store in Cowdenbeath along with  
 the free bus services provided has    
 effected the shopkeepers in Kelty.
