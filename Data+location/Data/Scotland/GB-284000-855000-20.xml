		<title>20NAIRN:A DAY IN THE LIFE OF..</title>
		<content> I am 12 years old. On school days I   
 get up at 8 o'clock, wash and put on  
 my school uniform.I go downstairs to  
 the kitchen where I have a plate of   
 Frosties for breakfast.               
   I brush my hair, collect my         
 schoolbag and walk to school which I  
 reach at 8.45am.I sit with my friends 
 until the bell rings at 9.00 for      
 registration.Then I have 2 classes    
 before break when I sit in the        
 concourse with my friends.I buy crisps
 from the tuck shop and go for a walk. 
   After 2 more classes it is lunchtime
 when I have chips and coke to eat.Two 
 more classes and it is 3.50 and time  
 for home.                             
   At home I change and do any homework
 then usually go downtown to the shops.
 At 6.00 the familly sit down for a    
 meal and in the evening I watch TV,   
 listen to records or finish my work.  </content>
