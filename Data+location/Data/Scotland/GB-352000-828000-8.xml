		<content> In a survey conducted in Kennethmont  
 60% of the ratepayers in this area    
 felt that they did not get "value for 
 money" in terms of services provided  
 by local government. The main         
 complaints concerned the roads and    
 especially snow clearance ,in winter, 
 of minor roads, some roads often being
 uncleared for hours. There were also  
 complaints about snow not being       
 cleared from the pavement running from
 Kirkhill to the school, as this often 
 forced children to walk to school on  
 the main road. Refuse collection was  
 another source of complaints and some 
 residents wanted a phone box provided 
 at Kirkhill and public toilets at the 
 playing field.59% of those asked      
 thought that the present rating system
 should be abolished and that a fairer 
 system could be devised for financing 
 local government.                     </content>
