		<title>13     Leven Coastguard</title>
		<content> Leven coastguard station has only one 
 full time coastguard Mr Theobald,who  
 told us all about his work.He said he 
 has ancillary helpers who are ready to
 drop everything and go when needed.   
    The main station is at Fife Ness   
 which is responsible for many miles of
 coastline.The coastguards watch for   
 signs of bad weather and look out for 
 ships in trouble but they could be    
 called out to rescue people cut off by
 the tide or children stuck on cliffs. 
 Only recently,Mr Theobald said,a mine 
 left over from the war had been found 
 on a beach and bomb disposal men had  
 to be called in.The R.N.L.I. provide  
 lifeboats,helicopters are stationed at
 Leuchars but common equipment like    
 ropes is kept at their stations.      
  They sometimes get hoax calls but    
 they'd rather go out and find a       
 mistake had been made than a life lost</content>
