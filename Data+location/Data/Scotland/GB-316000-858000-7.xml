		<content> The wash from the fermenters is pumped
 to the washcharger which supplies the 
 stills.All the alcohols are removed by
 distillation and the liquid called Low
 Wines collects in a receiver.The Low  
 Wines are pumped back to the Feints   
 Charger from which they go into the   
 Spirit Still for a second distillation
 The new malt spirit is reduced to     
 maturation strength before being      
 filled into oak barrels to mature.    
 The barrels are stored in the bonded  
 warehouse for three years and         
 sometimes more                        
 The oldest barrel has been in the     
 warehouse for over twenty years.The   
 owner of the whisky will remove it    
 from the bonded warehouse when it     
 reaches the point of maturity.It is   
 only then that the Excise Duty will be
 paid.
