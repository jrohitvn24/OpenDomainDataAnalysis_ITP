		<title>10BLANTYRE PRIORY</title>
		<content> On the summit of a rock, rising       
 perpendicularly from the river, stand 
 the ruins of {Blantyre Priory,}being  
 situated opposite to the ruins of     
{Bothwell Castle.}Its aspects          
 contribute materially to the romance  
 that pervades this interesting        
 locality. It was founded some time    
 before the year 1296. {Walter Stewart,
 was the first commander of this       
 Priory, and Lord Privy Seal in 1595   
 was raised to the peerage under the   
 title of{Lord Blantyre}on July 10th   
 1696.                                 
                                       
 The priory was surrounded by orchards,
 traces of which remain today, although
 it itself is not habitable any more.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
