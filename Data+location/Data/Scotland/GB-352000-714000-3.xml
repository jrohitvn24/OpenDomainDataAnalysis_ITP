		<title>03COASTAL EROSION</title>
		<content> This area of coastland is very exposed
 and vulnerable to the strong waves and
 tides which are the main cause of     
 erosion.  The cliffs are composed of  
 rocks of varying resistance to erosion
 and the waves exploit this            
 characteristic by eroding the softer  
 rocks at the base of the cliffs,      
 leaving layers of more resistant rock 
 unsupported.  This rock eventually    
 falls and the coastline retreats.     
 Erosion has taken place here for      
 hundreds of years so it is not a new  
 problem.  In some places in St.       
 Andrews, the cliffs have been         
 stabilised, but it is an expensive job
 and the cliffs to the East of St.     
 Andrews cover such a large area that  
 protection is not economically        
 possible, so the cliffs remain open   
 and exposed to the wind and waves.
