		<content> One of my favourite games at school is
 called Man Hunt.You must have more    
 than two people to play.One person    
 counts to 100 while the others        
 hide.After a count of 100 the search  
 begins for the people who are         
 hiding.They try to get back to the den
 and shout Man Hunt.If the person who  
 counts spots them running to the den  
 she tries to reach there before       
 them,to shout Man Hunt.If successful, 
 the person is trapped in the den.The  
 last person to be found can free all  
 the others if she reaches the den and 
 shouts Man Hunt before the counter.If 
 this happened the same counter would  
 be out again and the game continues as
 before.
