		<title>08The Causeway - Kennoway</title>
		<content>{ The Causeway,}or{"Causie"}as it is   
 known locally, is the original main   
 street of Kennoway. It starts just    
 north of Sandy Brae and leads uphill  
 to end behind the Swan Hotel in the   
 centre of the village. The Causeway   
 ceased to be the main road in the     
 1950's when New Road was constructed  
 immediately to the east to take its   
 place.                                
  The "Causie" is virtually all that   
 is left of the old settlement and many
 of the structures which remain are    
 listed buildings.                     
  Two of the most historic houses are  
 Forbes House, where a Dr Forbes once  
 held his surgery, and Seton House,    
 where Captain Seton lived.            
  There is a house still with no gas,  
 electricity or toilet facilities in   
 which an old man has lived since his  
 birth.                                </content>
