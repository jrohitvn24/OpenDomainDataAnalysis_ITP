		<content> Balerno Paper Mill is owned by the    
 DRG and International Company. Mr.K, a
 company employee, says that he enjoys 
 his work but that it can get a little 
 boring. Mr.K has been working in the  
 mill for 10 years now. Most of the    
 mill's buildings were completed       
 between 1900 and 1910. The mil has    
 computers in three parts of the works.
 The mill is a safe place provided the 
 employees do their jobs correctly. The
 mill employs a total of 104 workers.  
 These people are engineers, mill      
 workers, security officers, technical 
 workers, office staff and management. 
 Some workers have to wear protective  
 clothing such as face masks,          
 respirators and overalls. Materials   
 come from as close as Fife, to as far 
 away as Japan,Germany and Scandinavia.
 Recently the DRG has been forced to   
 make some redundancies due to losses. </content>
