		<title>12THE GARDEN ESTATE, ARNPRIOR</title>
		<content> The two foresters responsible for     
 tending the trees on Garden also      
 operate the sawmill. Trees are trimmed
 using a power saw and taken to the    
 sawmill by tractor and trailer. There 
 the timber is cut into lengths of     
 5'6", 12', or 14' as required. The two
 main circular saws in the mill are    
 powered by a tractor engine. Most of  
 the timber is used on the estate -    
 larch for fences and gates, spruce for
 repairs to farm buildings. Some wood  
 is sold to timber merchants - elm for 
 coffins, ash for tool handles, sports 
 goods and so on.  The foresters work  
 mainly in the mill in winter and on   
 the plantations  for most of the rest 
 of the year - planting in spring,     
 fencing etc in summer and tree felling
 in autumn.
