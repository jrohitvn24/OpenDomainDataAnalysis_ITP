		<content> This small picturesque loch is        
 situated just to the northwest of the 
 town itself.                          
 In recent years the loch has been     
 developed as a small outdoor centre.  
 At present four instructors are       
 employed by the Y.M.C.A. funded by the
 Manpower Services Commission. Courses 
 are being run for unemployed persons  
 on sailing and canoeing in the summer,
 and in walking and climbing in the    
 winter.                               
 The loch is also used by local        
 secondary schools for sailing and     
 canoing instruction.
