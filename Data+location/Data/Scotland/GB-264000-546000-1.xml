		<title>01THE LAND AROUND THE DEE</title>
		<content> On the left bank of the Dee the land  
 is dividedd into small farms (mainly  
 sheep and cattle), joined by narrow   
 roads. Senwick House, a country hotel,
 sits beside one of these roads. The   
 land consists of gentle hills with    
 small rocky outcrops and woodland. The
 Dhoon Bay is a popular bathing resort 
 and nearby is the recent Millhall     
 Housing Estate. The tidal river,      
 though seemingly wide, has a very     
 narrow channel, marked by buoys and   
 used now only by the fishing fleet    
 from nearby Kirkcudbright and         
 occasional pleasure-craft. The point  
 of St.  Marys Isle, a private estate, 
 is wooded, rocky and uninhabited. On  
 the opposite bank is a young deciduous
 wood and arable farmland. On the shore
 is the Kirkcudbright Lifeboat Station,
 manned by a part-time volunteer crew.
