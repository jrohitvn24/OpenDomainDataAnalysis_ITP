		<content> The first school in Haddington for    
 senior pupils was called the          
{Haddington Grammar School}founded in  
{1379.}This school was attended by{John
{Knox,}but falling roles meant that by 
 1875 only two pupils attended. For the
 next five years Haddington was without
 a secondary school. However, in{1879  
 it was decided that there was enough  
 demand for a secondary school and so  
 another building was constructed.     
 This building was named after John    
 Knox and was called{The Knox          
{Institute. }But in{1947}the school was
 renamed{Knox Academy}and a modern     
 extension was added.                  
                                       
{SUPERNATURAL }There is said to be a   
{White Lady}which haunts{St. Mary's    
{Church. Somnerfield Avenue,}where     
 supposed{witches}were burnt, is also  
 said to be haunted.                   </content>
