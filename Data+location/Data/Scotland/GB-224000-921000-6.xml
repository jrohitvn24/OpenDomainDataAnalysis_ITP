		<title>06Inchnadamph Church</title>
		<content> Inchnadamph church was perhaps built  
 in{1835.}It has changed little since  
 then. The walls outside are harled    
 stone and inside is wood lined and    
 lathe and plaster. On top, is a tiny  
 spire with a weather vane. It has     
 plain dormer windows at one side only 
 except for a little vestry window. It 
 has no electricity or water. In the   
 graveyard is the{ancient tomb of the  
{Macleod family}which was built in the 
 middle of the{15th Century by Angus,  
 great-grandson of the first laird as a
 penance for burning down a previous   
 shrine. The first protestant          
 minister was{William Gray,in 1576.}The
 church is sadly no longer used. A new 
{Parish church}was built in{Lochinver  
 in 1903.Old Gaelic bibles and comment-
 aries are still to be found inside.   
 The graveyard is rarely used for      
 burials now due to high soil acidity.}</content>
