		<title>09Water in Bourtie</title>
		<content> Bourtie boasts a water reservoir at a 
 height of 500 feet where the Pitgaveny
 ride meets Airyhillock.  Water pumped 
 in from the Rivers Ythan and Deveron  
 is maintained by the Grampian Water   
 Board and feeds townships as diverse  
 as Oldmeldum and Insch, 15 miles away.
 ironically only five homesteads close 
 to the reservoir receie Mains water   
 supply from it.  Some farms in the    
 parish closer to Inverurie are        
 provided with Inverurie mains supply. 
 But the rest of the surrounding       
 district has to provide its own water.
  Residents of Bourtie are therefore   
 perhaps proud of their ability to be  
 self-sustaining and self-reliant, when
 in years like 1976 and 1984 the       
 summers were so dry that water was    
 precious throughout Aberdeenshire.    
 Bourtie resident are thrify and keep a
 water supply from their own wells.    </content>
