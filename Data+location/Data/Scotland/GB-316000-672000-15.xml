		<title>15QUEENSFERRY ROAD</title>
		<content> Our school, Clermiston, is very close 
 to the Queensferry Road which goes    
 from the city of Edinburgh to the     
 Forth Road Bridge. Over the past ten  
 years, since the road bridge was      
 built, traffic has become heavier and 
 heavier and the road is now the       
 busiest in Scotland. Our class did a  
 traffic survey on Thursday 23 May 1985
 for 10 minutes around 1.30pm and then 
 again around 2.30pm. Here are the     
 results (traffic in both directions). 
                                       
                       1.30pm { }2.30pm
{Cars                     342       405
{Buses                     10         5
{Lorries/Vans             131       103
{2-wheeled transport        4         6
{                                      
 This gives a projected figure of about
 3000 vehicles an hour at a busy period
 making crossing the road hazardous.   </content>
