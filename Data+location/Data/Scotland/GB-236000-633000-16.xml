		<title>16EMPLOYMENT IN DUNDONALD</title>
		<content>  There is very little work for people 
 actually in the village of Dundonald  
 itself. The workers have to travel to 
 work in some of the towns round about 
 such as Irvine, Ayr, Prestwick,       
 Kilmarnock or even the city of        
 Glasgow.                              
  In the 1960's some factories were    
 built close to the village providing  
 local employment. These factories made
{Nylon, Ball_bearings}and{Tractors.}   
 Sadly all of these factories have now 
 closed although a new {Chemical}works 
 has been built fairly recently which  
 provides some employment.             
   In 1966 it was decided that the     
 nearby town of{Irvine}should be       
 developed as a "New Town" to attract  
 industry and provide more jobs for    
 local people. Unfortunately, this has 
 not proved to be the success it was   
 hoped and there is heavy unemployment.</content>
