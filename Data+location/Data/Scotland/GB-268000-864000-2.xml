		<content> My name is Ian McHardy and I am 11    
 years old. I live in the little       
 village of Jemimaville on the Black   
 Isle.   Jemimaville is a one-sided    
 street about 300metres long.The sea is
 not far from the end of most peoples  
 gardens. There is a barley field in   
 front of the village and trees dotted 
 about here and there.    My Mum       
 teaches Art in a High School about 25 
 miles away from Jemimaville. My Dad   
 has a buisness guiding people in the  
 mountains, skiing, climbing, ice      
 climbing and mountaineering. I also   
 have a younger brother called Alan.   
   At the end of the village there is a
 small glen called U-dale. We have a   
 swing and two rope bridges up U-dale. 
 It's brilliant fun up there. We also  
 have a gang and gang-hut at the back  
 of the village. It is built from wood 
 and is shaped like a very small house.</content>
