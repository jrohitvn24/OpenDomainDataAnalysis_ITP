		<title>11Ancient Stone Circles</title>
		<content> Unst was a place of some importance in
 Pictish times.Within our block, the   
 remains of three Drudical circles can 
 be seen.The largest,near the Kirk of  
 Balliasta,appears as three concentric 
 circles of stones, built above ground-
 level.The outer circle measures 67    
 feet across,and the diameters of the  
 middle and inner circle are 54\ feet  
 and 40 feet, respectively.A tumulus of
 stones-12 feet in diameter-in the     
 middle suggests that this may have    
 been a temple.One mile East,along the 
 hill of Cussa Field,similar concentric
 circles,of smaller circumference,are  
 seen.These are named the "Rounds of   
 Tivla" on the O.S. Map and known      
 locally as the "Fairy Rings".A third, 
 smaller enclosure-consisting of only  
 two circles,is located 80 feet from   
 the "temple".The diameters of these   
 circles are 22 feet and 17 feet.      </content>
