		<content> Sir David Wilkie is without doubt the 
 most famous person who ever lived in  
 the village of Pitlessie.             
 He was born on the 18th November 1785 
 and was brought up in the{manse of    
{Cults,}a short distance from the      
 village where his{father, the         
{Reverend David Wilkie,}was minister to
 the parish.                           
 As a boy, David Wilkie went to        
 Pitlessie village school and it is    
 said that even at that time, his      
 talent for drawing was remarkable. His
 most famous{painting}with regard to   
 Pitlessie is{"Pitlessie Fair".        
 Sketches of buildings which provided  
 the background for this painting can  
 still be identified in the village    
 today.                                
 After a highly successful career as a 
 painter to the king, he died at sea at
 the age of 56 years.                  </content>
