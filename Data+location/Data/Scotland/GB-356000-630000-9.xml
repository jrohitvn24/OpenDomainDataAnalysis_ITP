		<content> Newtown Gala Week began as a Gala Day 
 which was organised in 1979 as part of
 the local celebrations for the Queen's
 Silver Jubilee.The local Community    
 Council were given a grant to start   
 the Gala Day, and they det up a       
 sub-committee for this                
 purpose.Representatives from each club
 in the village joined the committee   
 and they set about organising a Gala  
 that would cater for all.They did this
 with such success that the original   
 day soon became a full week.          
     The events include the talent     
 contest, a country and western musical
 evening,a Mr. and Mrs. Quiz Show,a    
 bowling contest, pet show, football
