		<title>07ROBERTSON'S TOFFEE FACTORY</title>
		<content> Robertsons Toffee Factory started     
 in 1955.At present it employs 23 local
 people,with pupils from the school    
 employed for the busy summer months.  
 Much of the work is now done by       
 machine.Fudge and Toffees are made and
 all the ingredients have to be brought
 from south.For the fudge they use     
 sugar,glucose,condensed milk,vegetable
 fat,butter and flavouring.Plain fudge 
 is the best seller,but they make many 
 flavours.All the wrapping of fudge and
 toffees is done by machine.Their      
 product is sold all over Britain and  
 even small packages are sent abroad.  
 The fudge is taken to a depot in Fife 
 for distribution,in their own         
 container lorry.The factory gets many 
 visits from schools and tourists.
