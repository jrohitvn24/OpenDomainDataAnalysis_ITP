		<title>12The Smithy at Balmullo</title>
		<content>                                       
 Mr. Wilson, the blacksmith, has       
 provided shoes  for up to twenty-four 
 horses in one day!   This is still    
 quite an important part of his work.  
 Sometimes the horses come to the      
 smithy but Mr. Wilson and his son also
 travel out to farms to shoe horses,   
 with portable equipment.   In fact,   
 Mr. Wilson has even travelled to      
 England for his customers!   However, 
 most of his business is within about  
 fifteen miles of Balmullo.            
                                       
 As well as shoeing horses, Mr. Wilson 
 also repairs farm machinery and makes 
 things such as wrought-iron grates.   
 For this he has a lot of heavy        
 machinery such as a grinder, welding  
 equipment and cutters.
