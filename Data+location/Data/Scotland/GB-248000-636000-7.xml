		<title>07COAL MINING-GALSTON</title>
		<content> The coal mining in Galston made it    
 quite popular.The fathers and sons    
 worked in the coalmines and the women 
 and daughters worked in the lace      
 factories.The mining companies built  
 "Miners Rows"near the pit heads.The   
 Community expanded to approximately   
 6000 inhabitants in 1911.The demand   
 for coal dwindled and the population  
 dropped.During the later half of the  
 19thC and up until the General Strike 
 in 1926 coal mining was the main      
 source of employment.The first pits   
 were at Gauchalland ,Burnhouse,       
 Burnhousehill and Courthorn.Before    
 coal was mined peat was burned,this   
 being obtained from Galston Muir.At   
 one time there were 15 collieries in  
 the district employing 1100 men.
