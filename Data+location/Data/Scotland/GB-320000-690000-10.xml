		<content> At the west end of the village of     
 Auchtertool there is a collection of  
 buildings owned by the Distillers     
 Company Ltd. The buildings were first 
 used as a brewery from 1650. In the   
 18th Century the brewery was noted    
 throughout Fife for its excellent brew
 and had its praises sung by the local 
 poets. In 1845 it was converted to a  
 Distillery by Walter Bartholomew from 
 Kirkcaldy. The Whisky was a pure malt 
 and the average annual output was     
 86,000 gallons. It continued as a     
 Distillery until 1927,when the present
 owners changed to producing malt for  
 the use by other Distilleries. In 1971
 malting was stopped and now only the  
 duty free warehouses are used for     
 maturing Whisky bought from other     
 companies. It has however a small     
 capacity and the warehousing          
 work is carried out (cont)            </content>
