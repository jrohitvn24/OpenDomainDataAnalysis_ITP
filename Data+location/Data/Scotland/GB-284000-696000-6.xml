		<title>06"GHOSTS" AT MENSTRIE CASTLE</title>
		<content> Menstrie Castle was built in the 16th 
 century. Its renovation in 1957       
 brought Mr and Mrs Drysdale to live in
 it. A few months after moving in Mrs  
 Drysdale was woken up by a knocking on
 the wall. She went downstairs to see  
 if her neighbour needed help but she  
 was fast asleep. The noises continued 
 becoming more frequent over the years 
 and came to an end on the 4th of March
 1985. The fact that Mrs Drysdale lived
 in the castle as a child has not been 
 considered a connection and the       
 Drysdale's idea of someone knocking on
 the wall outside has not been thought 
 of as an explanation. The noises which
 happened at No 2, Menstrie Castle have
 still not been explained.
