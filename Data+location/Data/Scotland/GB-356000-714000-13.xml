		<title>13BUDDO ROCK</title>
		<content>  Along this part of coastline a       
 prominent stack of rock,called{Buddo  
{Rock}is situated.It is made of        
 sandstone and was once part of the    
 cliffs behind.Being of a harder       
 material it is more resistant to      
 erosion.There has been the formation  
 of a natural arch giving its          
 distinctive appearance.Beyond this    
 rock a cattle shed stands which used  
 to be the old lifeboat station built  
 between 1860 and 1890,now open on the 
 landward side,while from the shore    
 side a lifeboat could be launched.Not 
 far from the cattle shed a track leads
 up towards Chesterfield Farm and then 
 onto Boarhills village passing a      
 rectangular dovecot.Further along this
 piece of coastline there is a 3 to    
 4 metre high wall built to prevent    
 erosion by the sea.
