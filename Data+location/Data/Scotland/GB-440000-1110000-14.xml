		<content>   Our weather is very variable in both
 summer and winter. We have a lot of   
 rain and a lot of gales compared to   
 other places. Generally, our          
 temperatures are moderate at all times
 of the year.                          
   Around our coasts live many species 
 of sea birds. There is a large colony 
 of Eider Ducks nesting at the cliffs  
 of Compass Head. Curlews, Puffins and 
 Crows are just some of the birds.     
   In the spring and summer there are  
 many wild flowers eg. Primrose,Bird's 
 Foot Trefoil. Heather is dominant on  
 exposed hillsides.                    
   There are many wild sea animals eg. 
 Otters, Porpoises and Seals. On       
 occasion basking Whales can be        
 spotted.                              
   The relatively unspoilt countryside 
 attracts many visitors.
