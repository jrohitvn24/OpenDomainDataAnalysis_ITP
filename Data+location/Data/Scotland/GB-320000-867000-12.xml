		<title>12RUBBISH DUMP LOSSIEMOUTH</title>
		<content>   The rubbish dump is on the outskirts
 of Lossiemouth beside the A941 and is 
 surrounded by woods on three sides.   
 It was closed at the start of         
 September 1985 because it was full up.
 The disadvantages in the location of  
 the dump were the smells, which       
 reached nearby houses, and the litter 
 which blew into the woods. To stop    
 that from happening the council put   
 nets round it but that was only partly
 succesful. As a result when people    
 came into Lossiemouth the dump was an 
 eyesore.                              
   The seagulls, which are a nuisance  
 in town because they make nests and   
 attack people, all came to the dump   
 to look for food. Now the dump is     
 closed they will probably come into   
 Lossie scavenging. The closure of the 
 dump has brought pleased reactions    
 from the people nearby.               </content>
