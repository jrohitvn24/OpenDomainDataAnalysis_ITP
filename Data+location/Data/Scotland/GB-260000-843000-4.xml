		<content>   There are many different kinds of   
 houses in our area. A lot of them have
 been built fairly recently. There are 
 only about five old houses in the     
 village. The modern houses are nearly 
 all kit houses. People buy a plot of  
 land and then build the type of house 
 they want on it. There are four houses
 being built at the moment. The        
 majority of houses are owner occupied.
 There are some very large old houses  
 in the area. One of these (Bunchrew   
 House) is split into flats and rented 
 out to people. There is also a        
 residential caravan site in Bunchrew.
