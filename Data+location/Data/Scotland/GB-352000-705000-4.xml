 Carnbee reservoir was built in 1929,  
 it is an earth dam. The reservoirs    
 total capacity of water is 50.6       
 million gallons. The reservoirs water 
 surface is 15 acres and the           
 surrounding area all together is 180  
 acres. The maximum depth is 32 feet.  
 The reservoir only serves round the   
 coast that is Crail, Kilrenny,        
 Anstruther, Pittenweem, St. Monans and
 Elie.                                 
 During 1984 when the water level was  
 very low everybody had to reduce the  
 amount of water they used. People     
 were told not to wash their cars so   
 often.                                
 Carnbee Reservoir is situated to the  
 west of this square. At the back of   
 the reservoir is Carnbee Law. Carnbee 
 Law is 142m in height. Carnbee Law is 
 used by the farm near-by  for grazing.</content>
