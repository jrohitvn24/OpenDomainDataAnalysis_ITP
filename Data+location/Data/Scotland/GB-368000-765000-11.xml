		<content>    Few people attend Marykirk Church. 
 Those who do attend are mostly older  
 people though some new families have  
 joined recently.  During the Sunday   
 Service, after the second hymn, the   
 Sunday School children go through to  
 the Sunday School room where the      
 teacher reads a story and the children
 work at different activities.  The    
 Women's Guild members come from       
 Luthermuir and Marykirk.  Mr Blaikie  
 came in 1979.  He visits people in    
 their homes especially if they are    
 ill.  During the year he holds special
 services for Christmas, Easter,       
 Harvest, Communion and officiates at  
 christenings, weddings and funerals.
