		<content>{Noise}                                
      There was a great deal of noise  
 in and around the quarry from all the 
 machinery, so much so that the men    
 working in particularly noisy places  
 had to wear ear-muffs, and visitors to
 noisy machine houses were supplied    
 with disposable ear-plugs called      
 pop-plugs.                            
                                       
{Dust}                                 
      There was also a great deal of   
 dust from the crushing machines and   
 the quarry owners had installed       
 expensive machinery to prevent the    
 workmen breathing in the dust which   
 would otherwise block there lungs. The
 workmen also wore face masks.         
      However the tress around the     
 quarry were extremely healthy and one 
 holiday maker from Devon took home a  
 bag of dust every year for his roses. </content>
