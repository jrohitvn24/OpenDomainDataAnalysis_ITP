		<content> Rhu 25/83 &amp; 26/83                     
 A good example of shallow entrance    
 or mouth of a fiord. Before dredging  
 this was too shallow to allow shipping
 to pass through to Naval Base at      
 Faslane. In years gone by Narrows     
 known as 'The Jumblies' due to the    
 turbulent waters there.               
 24/83 - block surrounded by sea on 3  
 sides as Rosneath forms toe of        
 Peninsula. Highland Boundary Fault    
 Line runs through toe.                
    The name Rosneath may be derived   
 from 'Ros' a point and 'Nevydd' a 6th 
 century bishop or 'Neimidh' a         
 sanctuary.                            
    Rhu took name from Gaelic 'rudha'  
 meaning promontory. This refers to Rhu
 Point, a spit formed of shingle. Could
 be classed as 'Gateway to Highlands'as
 it lies to n/w of Highland Boundary   
 Fault Line.                           </content>
