		<content> Islay is about 40 Kilometres long and 
 32 Kilometres wide:approx.380 square  
 kilometres or 150,000 acres.          
 The climate is mild because of the    
 effect of the {North Atlantic Drift}of
 the {Gulf Stream.}                    
 Although there is a predominance of   
 holiday homes(second homes)in the     
 block,the villages of Portnahaven and 
 Port Wemyss are not the busiest of    
 tourist centres.There is a steady flow
 of tourists in the summer months but  
 with the exception of those with      
 residences very few are based in the  
 block.This is due mainly to the lack  
 of hotels and other suitable          
 accomodation.This area provides very  
 few facilities for tourists.There are 
 no caravan/camping sites and very     
 little in the way of recreational     
 facilities.
