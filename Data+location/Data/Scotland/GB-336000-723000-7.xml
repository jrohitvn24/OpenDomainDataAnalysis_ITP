		<title>07My family's week day</title>
		<content> My family's day begins at 07:00 when  
 we all get up and have breakfast.While
 we have a cup of tea my mother makes a
 packed lunch for my sister and me.My  
 sister is 16 years old and has to     
 leave the house early as her school   
 bus leaves the village at 08:00 to    
 take her to Madras College in         
 St.Andrews 12 miles away.I still go to
 the village school so I can leave home
 at 8:40.My mum sets off at 8:00 on her
 moped for St.Andrews where she works. 
 My father is an insurance agent and   
 leaves by car for Dundee at 9:30.At   
 15:15 I arrive home from school and   
 take our two dogs out for a walk.My   
 dad arrives home at 15:00 but usually 
 goes out to work again after          
 tea,returning at 21:00.Both my mum and
 sister return home at 16:30.The rest  
 of the day is for leisure and homework
 .We go to bed at about 21:00.         </content>
