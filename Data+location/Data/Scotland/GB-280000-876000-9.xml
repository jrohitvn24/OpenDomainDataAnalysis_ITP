		<title>09Plane Crash,Fearn.</title>
		<content> In the summer of 1984 we saw a big    
 black cloud of nsmoke and two         
 parachutes in the air over Locheye.My 
 mother and I went straight to the     
 scene of the crash and we saw bits of 
 an F1-11 just beside the loch.It blew 
 up and the flames started a fire in   
 the bushes.The fire brigade was soon  
 at the scene and had it under         
 control.While another F1-11 kept      
 flying over the area, a helicopter    
 flew in and took the crew away.They   
 were unharmed.Next day American crash 
 investigators were there and they took
 most of the bits of wreckage away for 
 examination.The crop in the field     
 where it crashed was ruined.Luckily   
 little or no damage was done to       
 homes.Planes still fly regularly over 
 Fearn en route to the Tain Bombing    
 Range. Many fly quite low over the    
 school.                               </content>
