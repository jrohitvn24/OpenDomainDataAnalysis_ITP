		<content>  One hot clammy night in the middle of
 August the lady was awakened by one of
 her children crying. She tumbled out  
 of bed and headed down the split      
 staircase to the childs room. Having  
 quietened him, she was wearily        
 plodding back upstairs when she found 
 her way blocked by a figure. More     
 surprised than alarmed, she looked    
 closer at the apparition. It was that 
 of a tall man, formally dressed and   
 with a round, genial looking face.    
 Before she could take further action, 
 the figure bowed politely and moved   
 gracefully to one side of the         
 stairway, smiling kindly. The lady    
 stepped past, nodding in return and   
 walked to her bedroom door. It was    
 only when she was safely inside that  
 her hair began to prickle and she     
 rushed to her bed, shaking with       
 fright!                               </content>
