		<title>19TANNOCH LOCH</title>
		<content>{Tannoch Loch }is a well known Milgavie
 beauty spot and a good place to find  
 ducks and  other wild life.The birds  
 are very tame and when you go there   
 they want to be fed.There are Coots   
 and Mallards and little ducklings     
 which are sometimes eaten by Herons.  
        The trees round about Tannoch  
 reflect into the water and make it    
 look colourful.The wild flowers on the
 banks are attractive.The nests are    
 usually in the reeds and rushes and   
 very well camouflaged.                
        The loch is private and the    
 people from round about it can go for 
 a row in it, if they have a boat.     
 Tannoch Loch is a peaceful place to   
 visit.
