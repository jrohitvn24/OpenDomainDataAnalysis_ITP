		<title>06CROFTING IN SKERRIES</title>
		<content> Crofting in Skerries has decreased    
 over the years. The old people say    
 that when they were younger the whole 
 island was covered in{rigs}(small     
 patches of cultivated land) but now   
 there are only a few rigs left on the 
 island.{Potatoes}and{oats}are the main
 crops grown in Skerries.              
   Also, a few people grow{Shetland    
{Cabbage}in yards near their houses. In
 earlier days these cabbages were grown
 in{krubs}(little round yards          
 surrounded  by stone dykes).          
                                       
  No-one in Skerries has a{cow}now     
 although there used to be a lot of    
 them here. The last one was sold in   
 the{1960's.}The sheep which are kept  
 here are all{Shetland sheep}and most  
 households have a few sheep. A few    
 people also keep{hens}and{ducks.
