		<content> In the past people did not have       
 freezers so they used salt to pickle  
 their meat and fish to preserve them. 
 SALT FISH                             
 Gut the fresh fish and wash them well 
 in cold water.Take a handful of rock  
 salt and sprinkle over the bottom of  
 the basin.Lay the fish in layers with 
 their backs down until the basin is   
 nearly full.Cover each layer with     
 plenty of salt making sure salt goes  
 inside the stomachs of the fish.      
 Leave for three days then take out the
 fish.Tie two fish together by their   
 tails.Hang outside in good weather on 
 the fence or clothes line.Dry above   
 the fire inside for roughly two weeks.
 soak over night in water then boil on 
 the top of potatoes
