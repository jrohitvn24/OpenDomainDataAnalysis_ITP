 The farmers sell their beasts and     
 sheep at the cattle market in Castle  
 Douglas, 20 km away.  This market is  
 held every week where cattle and sheep
 are sold to the local butchers.       
 Special days are set aside for the    
 sale of various breeds for the farmers
 to restock, or sell their surplus     
 breeding stock.  At these sales,      
 breeders meet from far and wide -     
 often as far as Australia and New     
 Zealand and Europe where specialised  
 breeds such as belties are bought to  
 be exported as breeding stock.  Many  
 of the Galloway cattle breed around   
 Borgue find their way to foreign      
 ports.
