		<content> People in Lochgoilhead have to        
 carefully budget their weekly accounts
 as their is no permanent bank in the  
 village.The Royal Bank of Scotland    
 comes every Thursday, weather         
 permitting. The bank is held in the   
 Village Hall from 10.00-12.30 and     
 13.30-15.00.                          
 The only other financial institution  
 is the Post Office which is run by    
 Mr.Paterson.He is known as Jimmy the  
 Cannuck because he spent some time in 
 Canada.                               
 The general economics of the village  
 are very closely bound to the tourist 
 industry. A bad tourist season has an 
 adverse effect on many people in the  
 village.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
