		<title>01The Hinterland of Kirkhill</title>
		<content> The area is very rural - good         
 farmland, woods and forests. There are
 no large commercial or industrial     
 operations. The land is flat around   
 Kirkhill rising to the back at Cabrich
 and Knockbain. Running across the     
 middle of the block is the A862 until 
 recently the A9 the main road to the  
 north from Inverness. However since   
 the opening of the Kessock Bridge the 
 traffic now crosses the Black Isle    
 making this area much quieter. The    
 village of Kirkhill is the main centre
 of population very close to the Beauly
 Firth. Monaick Castle recently        
 renovated has begun producing wines   
 from local products, fruits, berries, 
 plants etc. from the countryside. The 
 latest addition is a restaurent &amp; wine
 bar. There is a beautiful woodland    
 walk through the forest at Moniack    
 owned by the Forestry Commission.     </content>
