		<title>08UPPER TERRYVALE FARM.</title>
		<content> Mr Ritchie owns{Upper Terryvale farm }
 which covers 350 acres and keeps beef-
 cattle and sheep.He has 350 Hereford  
 Cross_Fresian cows which he keeps for 
 18 months to 2 years before selling.  
 He also keeps 300 sheep during winter.
 The main crop grown is barley for     
 feeding the cattle but he also grows  
 silage,hay and turnips for feed.      
 Pigeons and rabbits are a serious pest
 to crops and are dealt with in a      
 variety of ways i.e. using life_like  
 scarecrows and gassing and shooting   
 rabbits.                              
 Busy times of the year are spring,when
 putting in the crops,harvest_time and 
 bringing in the winter feed.It is not 
 unusual for Mr Ritchie to work through
 from 6.30am till late at night.
