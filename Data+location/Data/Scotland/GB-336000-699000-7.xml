		<title>07My Visit To The High School</title>
		<content> Buckhaven High School is huge.It has  
 1600 pupils.I go there after the      
 summer holidays.I am terrified I get  
 lost or go to the wrong classes and   
 get lines on my first day.            
   We went into the lecture room,Mr    
 Grant the Rector came in to talk to us
 then Mrs Rodger a guidance teacher    
 asked us a few questions.The P.E.     
 teacher told us we would need blue    
 shorts and a white Tee_shirt for gym. 
 Some prefects came in then to show us 
 around so we were put into groups.    
   We visited the geography,music and  
 art classes,the language and science  
 labs.where I was told to put my hair  
 under my collar in case it went on    
 fire if it touched a Bunsen burner.   
    Some teachers sound nice others    
 strict but as the prefects are to     
 guide us round the first few days I   
 think I will like it.                 </content>
