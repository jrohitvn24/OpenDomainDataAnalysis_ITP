		<title>12Tourism in Fraserburgh</title>
		<content> If you like sports or just like       
 holidays in a nice quiet place then   
 Fraserburgh's just the place for you. 
 It has a luxurious beach which extends
 for about 4 Km. It has fine, clean    
 sand and the water is usually calm. A 
 few years ago the surfing             
 championships were held in            
 Fraserburgh. Above the beach there are
 tearooms, toilets, a paddling pool,   
 mini train, swings, a climbing frame, 
 fireman's pole and a rocking horse.   
 You could go sailing.  There is a     
 caravan  site. There is a large dune  
 called "Tiger Hill".  There is an l8  
 hole golf course. If you go for a swim
 you must be a good swimmer because    
 there are strong currents.  Beside the
 beach there's a caravan site. There is
 also a harbour where you can watch the
 fishing boats. So now you know about  
 it, why not come for a holiday?       </content>
