 On display in the local museum is the 
 Eyemouth Tapestry, measuring 15ft x   
 3ft it was commissioned to commemorate
 the 100th anniversary of the Great    
 Fishing Disaster of 1881 when half the
 fleet and 129 men were lost, many in  
 sight of the shore.  The tapestry was 
 designed by Alistair .I. Scott, sewn  
 by 24 local women using coloured      
 threads, tapestry wool and gold       
 threads.  It took 2 years to complete.
 It consists of 5 panels, the first 3  
 illustrate the tragic events which    
 occured that day, the last two depict 
 the equipment which helps to ensure   
 the safety of fishermen today.  The   
 name panels list the names of each    
 boat and man that was lost.  The      
 tapestry was completed in 1981, the   
 same year that the Eyemouth Museum was
 opened.                               </content>
