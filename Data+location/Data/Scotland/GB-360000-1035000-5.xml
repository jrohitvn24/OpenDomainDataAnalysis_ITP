		<title>05RAZOR SHELLS AT STOVE</title>
		<content>  A{local delicacy}is{razorfish,}known 
 locally as{spoots.}They taste lovely, 
 but they have to be caught, which is  
 hard as they{live under the sand.     
  To catch them you need a bucket, a   
 large knife and a{very low tide.      
 To begin with, the bucket is held in  
 one hand and the knife in the other,  
 and you{walk backwards}looking for a  
{spout of water}or a{little hole}giving
 away their whereabouts. As soon it's  
 seen, the{knife}is thrust into the    
 sand around the hole and moved in a   
 circular motion, down and inwards, to 
{trap the shell}in the tunnel of the   
 fleeing creature. Holding the knife   
 still, a hole is then dug with the    
 free hand, to reveal the knife and    
 hopefully the stranded razor-shell.   
  They should be{boiled}out of the     
 shell and are delicious when{coated in
{flour}and{fried in butter.            </content>
