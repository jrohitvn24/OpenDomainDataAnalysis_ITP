		<title>09FUN IN DRUMNADROCHIT</title>
		<content>     There is very little for the young
 people to do in the evenings,so many  
 people hang around the shop talking   
 and larking about or going to the     
 local {Youth Club}to listen to records
 and play pool etc. A few stay at home 
 and watch television. As there are no{
 Cinemas or  Theatres  in Drumnadrochit
 people make their own {Entertainment. 
 At the weekends{Discos  ,Ceilidhs}and 
 Sales of Work  occasionally take place
 in the{Glenurquhart Public  Hall.}For 
 the adults there are the {Pubs}and    
 Clubs  where Bands sometimes play or  
 else they go to Inverness where there 
 is a wider choice of {Entertainment.  
{The}younger people also go to Town if 
 they have the money.They go to visit  
 the Cinema or to wander around the    
 shops and buy records and clothes.
