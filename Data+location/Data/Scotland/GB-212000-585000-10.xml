		<title>10Colmonell Fair</title>
		<content> In August,in the manse grounds,there  
 is a fair in aid of church funds.At   
 the fair you can buy second hand toys 
 and things like that.If you pay 25p   
 for children and 50p for adults you   
 get something to eat and drink.If you 
 are a person who likes old churches   
 you can go round the church and go and
 see the covenanters grave.If you go   
 down past the church hall and on down 
 to the manse there are lots of        
 enjoyable games.At the fishing game   
 you get a fishing rod with string     
 attached toit,and a magnet attached to
 the string.There are nails and money  
 in envelopes which you have to try to 
 catch.There is a darts game where     
 there is a pound and a five pound note
 on the board if you get all your darts
 in the note you get it.There are lots 
 of other good games at the fair.It is 
 good fun and helps the church as well.</content>
