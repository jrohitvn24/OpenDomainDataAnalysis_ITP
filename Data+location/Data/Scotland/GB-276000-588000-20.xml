		<title>20Village Shops</title>
		<content> The village shops offer limited goods 
 to the villagers and the prices tend  
 to be higher than those in a town.This
 is not the fault of the shop-keepers  
 as they have to pay extra for         
 transporting the goods.There are three
 grocers,a butchers,a post-office and  
 fancy-goods shop,a junk shop run by an
 ex-belly dancer and a haberdasher's   
 which is up for sale as it has not    
 been making money.The main village    
 population do their shopping in       
 Dumfries or to a lesser extent        
 Thornhill and use the village shops   
 only when they run out of things.     
 Because of the poor bus service       
 however,many people have to shop in   
 the village,particularly the elderly, 
 and the food shops can be surprisingly
 busy.
