		<content> My name is Joanne, I am ten years old 
 and live in Creca. I go to Newington  
 school in Annan. The bus picks me up  
 at 8.30am and brings me home at       
 4.30pm. I have to get up about half   
 past seven to get washed and have my  
 breakfast before leaving to wait for  
 the bus. My favourite subjects at     
 school are writing stories, history   
 and maths. I have been picked to play 
 a brass instrument but I would prefer 
 to play the guitar. On Tuesday, after 
 school, I go to Highland dancing      
 classes. Most weeks my mum takes us   
 swimming at the pool in Annan. I have 
 three badges for swimming. I collect  
 rubbers and have 97 of them. I have a 
 B.M.X. bike and like going out on it. 
 I usually do my homework before tea   
 and afterwards I can watch television 
 or play with friends. I like to read  
 when I go to bed.                     </content>
