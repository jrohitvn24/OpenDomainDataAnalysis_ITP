		<content>      In Quarff, where so many people  
 commute to full time employment,      
 crofting has become a spare time      
 occupation. A croft is a small area of
 arable land used for mixed farming. In
 addition, a crofter also has a share  
 in the "scattald." Most crofters rent 
 their crofts, and, under the Crofting 
 Acts, have security of tenure and     
 therefore cannot be evicted. A croft  
 is always busy and there is always    
 something to do. For example, spring  
 is the lambing time and peats have    
 to be cut for winter fuel. In early   
 summer the rye grass is cut and the   
 peats are taken home. In mid summer   
 the sheep have to be clipped and the  
 wool is sold. In late summer the hay  
 is baled or 'coled' and taken home for
 winter feeding. In autumn the lambs   
 are taken to the marts to be sold.
