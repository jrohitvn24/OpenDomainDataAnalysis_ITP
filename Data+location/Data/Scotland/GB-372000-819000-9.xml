		<content>  There are no real facilities for     
 entertainment outside the home in the 
 block. There are a wide range of      
 sporting, social and recreational     
 facilities in nearby Inverurie which  
 are used by people in the block.      
  There is still an opportunity for    
 local people to make their own        
 entertainment by joining Inverurie    
 based clubs such as the Garioch       
 Musical Society which exists to       
 produce operetta and stage shows      
 once a year.                          
  There are good sporting facilities in
 Inverurie such as the excellent       
 Squash Club and the Social and        
 Sporting Club based on the local      
 football team, Inveruie Loco Works,   
 a relic from the days when Inveruie   
 had a large loco repair works.
