		<content>{BLINDWELLS OPEN CAST MINE }- The site 
 lies one mile east of {TRANENT.}In    
 1978 after many test borings were     
 taken from the surrounding area it was
 decided that the Blindwells site had  
 one of the best yields.Production     
 target is 5.01m tonnes to be reached  
 in 1986/7.As with all coal sites the  
 area is acquired,prospected and leased
 by the N.C.B.The site is situated     
 above several seams of coal of varying
 thickness and determined by the N.C.B.
 to be economically viable.The total   
 workforce is 135. 30% of these people 
 are from Tranent - no local miners are
 employed.The labour force is small by 
 comparison to deep mining and this    
 method of winning coal requires few of
 the traditional deep mining skills.   
 The land must be restored to the same 
 condition after production finishes.
