		<title>10AMERICAN SCHOOLS (cont).</title>
		<content> The schools are regularly inspected by
 a representative of a European school 
 council to keep a check on the schools
 standard which is now very high.The   
 pupils have their own student council 
 which contributes in a large way to   
 the running of the school.            
    The pupils and teachers alike are  
 very friendly and enjoy being at the  
 American school (although they would  
 prefer to be back in America).This is 
 brought out by the decor and the      
 attitude shown by both sets of people.
