		<title>10The Queen's visit to Kylesku</title>
		<content>  August the 8th 1984 was a very       
 important day for Kylesku. For days   
 before it was all hustle and bustle   
 in preparation for the Queen's visit  
 to open the new Kylesku Bridge.       
  Early in the morning of the great day
 the Royal yacht, Britannia, could be  
 seen at anchor in Loch a Chairn Bhain.
 People and cars were everywhere. Then 
 the rain started and midges attacked  
 from all sides.                       
  It was still raining when the Queen  
 came ashore accompanied by Princess   
 Margaret. They made the journey       
 through the crowds up to the bridge   
 where the opening ceremony was        
 performed. The Assynt Pipe Band played
 as the Queen crossed the bridge to see
 the exhibition of its construction.   
  To the strains of the bagpipes       
 playing "The Waters of Kylesku", the  
 Queen left on board the ferry.        </content>
