		<title>18      Home Renovation</title>
		<content> Most Glasgow people used to live in   
 tenements built of sandstone about    
 ninety years ago. Some of the         
 tenements became shabby and even      
 dangerous so the Council pulled many  
 of them down and built new high flats 
 instead. Then people realised that it 
 would be better to renovate the old   
 tenements, and this is still going on.
 When a flat is renovated, some        
 families are found a new home         
 temporarily, but others have to live  
 with all the muddle.                  
 Any rotten woodwork is replaced,      
 the outside walls are cleaned, the    
 rooms are re-wired and sinks, roofs,  
 bathroom suites and windows are all   
 renewed.                              
 This all usually takes about three    
 months, but it is worth the           
 inconvenience because people like     
 living in old tenements.              </content>
