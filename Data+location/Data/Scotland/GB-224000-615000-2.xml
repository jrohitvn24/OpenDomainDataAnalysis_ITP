		<title>02POPULATION IN DUNURE</title>
		<content> The nature of the population of Dunure
 has changed considerably over the past
 50 years.Where once the village was a 
 cluster of fishermen's cottages around
 the harbour - mostly one or two       
 apartments occupied by large families,
 with the building of Council and      
 private houses the village has grown. 
 Fishermen and farm workers' cottages  
 have been sold and modernised,and a   
 different population has evolved who  
 commute daily to business in nearby   
 towns.Wives also have joined the      
 changing times and many travel to     
 work.The village now houses only 38   
 fishermen and their families and      
 numbers 20 retired fishermen.Retired  
 and redundant farm workers are also   
 housed here.The 1981 census records   
 population of 527 in village and      
 figure of about 900 for whole area is 
 latest obtainable from Registrar.     </content>
