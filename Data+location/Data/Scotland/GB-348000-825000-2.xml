 The first thing you do is take the    
 kartae out of the shed and push it up 
 the hill.   It's fine and comfortable 
 because it's got a seat and it's      
 difficult to over turn it because of  
 the suspension in the front of it.    
 You come speeding down and in to the  
 layby at the bottom and it's covered  
 with sand and you speed in and put on 
 the brakes.
