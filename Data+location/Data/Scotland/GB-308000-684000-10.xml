 Modern pop music is very different    
 from the music of hundreds of years   
 ago. Today there are electric         
 amplifiers and guitars.  There are    
 visual displays a well as coloured    
 flashing lights and projected film    
 screens.                              
 Some of the pop groups, are Big       
 Country,Nazareth and the Skids.  The  
 Skids have now split up, like many    
 other groups, whreas Big Country and  
 Nazareth are going and are very       
 popular.  Barbara Dickson and Lulu    
 lived in Dunfermline at one time.     
 Lulu first sang in public at Rosyth.  
 She had some big hits. Barbara Dickson
 is very popular at the moment.  She   
 had a number one hit with Elaine Page 
 early in 1985. Carnegie Hall is no    
 longer big enough for her concerts.
