		<content> My name is Judith Baird.I am 11 years 
 old.On Thursday morning I woke up at  
 8am and saw my older sisters off to   
 High School in Biggar.I hurried       
 downstairs,had a plate of cornflakes  
 for my breakfast,brushed my teeth and 
 hair and set off for school.The bell  
 rang at 9am.We did some Maths and     
 Language work until playtime at       
 10:45am when we played skipping.We    
 then had our P.E.lesson,when we played
 rounders.I went home for lunch        
 at 12:30pm and then played skipping   
 again until the bell went at 1:30pm.In
 the afternoon we did project work and 
 at 3:30pm went home.I got changed and 
 went for my piano lesson to Symington.
 I returned home and had tea.When I had
 finished,I washed my hair ready to go 
 to an accordian concert at 7pm.I      
 came home at 11:30pm and went to bed.
