		<title>03Old Castle-Castle Kennedy</title>
		<content> The Old Castle is one of the main     
 attractions of the Gardens. It stands 
 opposite the Garden Centre. The Castle
 was known to be standing in 1482. It  
 was burnt down in 1716. It is thought 
 that a maid put a warming pan into a  
 bed and the sheets caught fire. The   
 present Earl of Stair told us that the
 2cnd. Earl of Stair was returning from
 Paris when it burnt down. Today the   
 ruins stand. You can go inside them.  
 Some of the windows are barred. There 
 used to be a spiral staircase but now 
 there is just a round hole leading to 
 the top. The Old Castle is just at the
 entrance to the Gardens, near to the  
 walled garden. The new Castle is      
 called Lochinch Castle and is where   
 Lord and Lady Stair live. The new     
 Castle is not open to the public.
