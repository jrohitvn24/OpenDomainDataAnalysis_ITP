		<title>09Employment in Guildtown Area</title>
		<content> There are very limited job            
 opportunities in this area. Fewer than
 5% of the population work on the land.
                                       
 In the village itself there work:_    
    at the school_ 3 Teachers, 2 Cooks 
 and 1 cleaner.                        
    at the garage_ 3 Mechanics, etc.   
    at the Inn   _ 4 full-time, 2 part-
 time workers.                         
 Other than these 15 people there are  
 the District Nurse and the Sub- Post  
 Mistress.                             
                                       
 Unless as above stated, all people    
 seeking employment must travel outwith
 this area. Most go to Perth, some to  
 Dundee and one to Coupar Angus.       
                                       
 However, it should be stated that all 
 3 Teachers at the school travel from  
 outwith the immediate area daily.     </content>
