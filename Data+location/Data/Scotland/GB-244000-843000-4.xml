		<content> The environment is well suited to deer
 farming.The farmers are very happy in 
 their environment. In their own words 
 -"Its the greatest place on earth."   
 They lead a very active outdoor life, 
 and after a very full day on the hill,
 they often pursue their great love of 
 Scottish Country Dancing, travelling  
 often many miles to various classes a 
 a few times a week. Initially, a lot  
 of capital had to be spent on deer    
 fencing, and as this has to be        
 repaired periodically the expenditure 
 is quite high. The one fear that the  
 owners have is whether enough money   
 can be made from the farming          
 enterprise to meet the high costs of  
 maintenance. They are so happy in     
 their environment that they hope more 
 city dwellers will come out to the    
 country to visit the farm,and share   
 their enjoyment.                      </content>
