		<content> "I live at Inveruplan near a river. My
 house is alone beside trees. I help my
 father with his job as the Estate     
 Gamekeeper. These are some of the     
 things I do to help him. I weed the   
 garden &amp; open the gates to let the van
 through. We have 5 dogs, 2 are        
 Collies, &amp; the other 3, fox terriers. 
 They help my Dad to catch foxes. I    
 take in the peats for our fire. You   
 cut peats from peat-banks in the      
 ground. When you cut peats you have to
 let them dry &amp; then we can take them  
 home. Cutting peats is very hard work.
 I also help my mother in the house    
 like washing dishes &amp; making my bed.  
 In the winter, deer come down to our  
 house &amp; I help my Dad to feed them"
