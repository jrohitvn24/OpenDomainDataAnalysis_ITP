		<title>08THE FEUARS</title>
		<content> The Feuars formed in 1805 is a body   
 of nine persons elected from among    
 holders of perpectual leases to manage
 the affairs of the village for the    
 common good.                          
 A School and mill were given to them  
 conditionally on payment of Â£4        
 interest on cost of building to Geo   
 Dempster who also gave them bleaching 
 greens,grazing and a 'plash' mill to  
 administer.Rent from these was to be  
 divided between maintaining village   
 roads and any purpose they themselves 
 decided.Votng was secret using a      
 voting stick an example of which may  
 be seen in Glamis Folk Museum.        
 Now all but a few roads are maintained
 by Tayside Region.                    
 The first Chairman was George Dempster
 of Dunnichen.In 1985 the chairperson  
 is Mrs Irene McLaren.
