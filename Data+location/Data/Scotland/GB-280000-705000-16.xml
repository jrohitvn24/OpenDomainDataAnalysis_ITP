		<title>16A SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> I get up about 7.30am,wash,get dressed
 in my school uniform which is grey    
 shirt,trousers,pullover &amp; green tie;  
 have breakfast of cereal,toast &amp; tea, 
 brush my teeth then go with my sister 
 to Greenhaugh to wait for the minibus.
 It comes at 8.30 and after we all pile
 in it sets off for school, picking up 
 others on the way. We have time to    
 play until the bell rings at 9am.When 
 we have said the prayer we do Mental  
 Arithmetic and as this is Wednesday,  
 World News. At 10am. we go in to music
 until playtime at 10.40. After that we
 do maths until lunchtime at 12 noon.  
 In the afternoon we have language, art
 and a chapter of our story before     
 going home on the minibus at 3.30pm.  
 When I get home I go out to play with 
 my friend Jamie until it is time for  
 tea. After tea I sometimes go out     
 again or watch TV before going to bed.</content>
