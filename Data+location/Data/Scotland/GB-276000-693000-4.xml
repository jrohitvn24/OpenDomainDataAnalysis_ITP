		<title>04Thistle Centre    Stirling</title>
		<content> The centre has historical parts       
 too. The old names of streets such as 
 Orchardcroft, Castle Gait, Bastion    
 Wynd and Ochilview Mall have been     
 kept. Hanging from the ceilings are   
 collages showing the signs of the old 
 trades of Stirling. These are the     
 Baxters, Fleshers, Skinners, Taylors, 
 Shoemakers, Hammermen and Weavers.    
   The Bastion is an old dungeon. It is
 in the Thistle Centre and was         
 originally on the old Stirling Wall.  
 The Bastion is now used as a small    
 museum. There is a tape recording     
 running all the time telling about its
 history. There are two showcases      
 displaying different types of medieval
 costumes.                             
 The Thistle Centre is indeed a very   
 pleasant shopping area,and when you go
 there it is more like an outing than  
 shopping.                             </content>
