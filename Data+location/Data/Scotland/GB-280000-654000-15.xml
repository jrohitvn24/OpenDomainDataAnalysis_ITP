		<content> Much of the local history is tied up  
 with 1. Cambusnethan Parish &amp;         
      2. Coltness Estate               
   1. The area occupies a part of      
 Cambusnethan Parish. There has been a 
 church in area since 1649{(GR.807554) 
 (relacing a 12th Century one moved    
 here from outside the area). 1837 this
 building was declared "ruinous and    
 dangerous" and replaced by another to 
 the west across the road{(GR.806554)  
 Cambusnethan Old Parish Church. Both  
 churches were endowed by the local    
 landowners, firstly the Stewarts of   
 Coltness and after 1839 the Holdworth 
 family who bought the estate. Still   
 standing today are the ruins of the   
 original church and graveyard (famous-
 Guiness Book of Records, grave of the 
 largest baby in the world). After the 
 Disruption of 1843 the Free Church of 
 Cambusnethan (now Cambusnethan North) </content>
