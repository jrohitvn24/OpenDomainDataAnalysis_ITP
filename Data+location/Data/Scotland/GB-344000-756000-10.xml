		<title>10A Working Day At Tannadice.</title>
		<content> A Typical Day At Balmadity Farm.      
 My dad and I get up at 6:30 a.m. and  
 have our breakfast.At 7:0 a.m. after  
 waking up Mum, we have to begin work. 
 First we feed the animals.The calves  
 are all kept in one field and are fed 
 with barley.Then we feed the sheep    
 which are kept in an other field.My   
 father uses an electric fence to keep 
 the sheep in and one of my jobs is to 
 use the tester to make sure it is     
 working.We then feed the young calves 
 in the barn.Then we go to Shandford   
 Farm which belongs to my Grandpa.There
 I help my uncle Graeme herd the cows  
 and sheep.We don't give our calves    
 names, there are too many. Each calf  
 has a number and we weigh each calf   
 and write it's weight down in the book
 beside it's number to check that it is
 growing properly.It is hard work on   
 the farm and I'm tired by teatime.    </content>
