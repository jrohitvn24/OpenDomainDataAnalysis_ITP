		<title>11Shopping in Linlithgow.</title>
		<content>   People living at the west end of    
 Linlithgow were asked for their       
 opinions on shopping facilities in the
 town.As a result of this survey,we    
 found that one of the main complaints 
 was about the siting of the shopping  
 complex at the east end of the        
 town.Transport seemed to be one       
 problem and this prevented them using 
 the complex regularly.Another         
 complaint was the lack of parking     
 facilities in the town.Though the     
 provision at the shopping complex is  
 satisfactory,elsewhere it is very     
 difficult to find a parking space.    
   Many people complained about the    
 lack of certain kinds of shops-in     
 particular children's clothes shops.  
   Some people still prefer to do the  
 bulk of their shopping in Edinburgh or
 Falkirk as prices are cheaper and     
 there is more variety.                </content>
