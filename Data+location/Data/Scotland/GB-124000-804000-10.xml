 Canna subscribers are connected to    
 Mallaig, as are the other Small Isles,
 by a radio link. Before 1966 the      
 service was totally inadequate. In    
 1966 the radio link was installed and 
 although experimental at first most of
 the islanders now have individual     
 phones and enjoy the same service as  
 people on the mainland. The line off  
 the island is subject to interference 
 in bad weather but it is seldom that  
 it is impossible to speak to people on
 the mainland. This is important as it 
 is our life_line to the mainland.     
 There is a public booth outside the   
 Post Office which is mainly used by   
 fishermen and yachts people or other  
 visitors to the island. It is an old  
 push button A and B telephone.
