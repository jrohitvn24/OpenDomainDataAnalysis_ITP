		<content> The hamlet of Upsettlington is part of
 the Ladykirk Estate. It comprises     
 Ladykirk house, the Home farm,        
 Waltersteads farm and cottages. After 
 the 1st. World War the present owners 
 father started a large rebuilding     
 program, primarily to give employment 
 to ex-service men- for instance 20 men
 bicycled from Norham daily, in        
 addition to men on the estate and in  
 all 120 cottages were renovated and in
 some cases rebuilt including Ladykirk 
 village itself. In 1937 the owner paid
 a large amount to bring electricity to
 the estate from Coldstream.           
   After the 2nd. World War Major Askew
 _the current owner_  continued the    
 renovation work. Again ex-service men 
 were employed and bathrooms and       
 lavatories were installed in all the  
 cottages. The old Ladykirk house      
 (built 1790) was then rebuilt.        </content>
