		<title>16GAME FACTORY</title>
		<content>  Seven years ago the Frans Buitelaar  
 Game Factory was built on the out_    
 skirts of Letham to process game from 
 the glens of Angus and Perthshire and 
 from Aberdeenshire.Rabbits are snared,
 deer,hares,pigeons,pheasants,grouse   
 and wild-fowl are shot.The game is    
 brought in in small amounts privately,
 or by game dealers in larger amounts. 
  The game is processed,quick_frozen   
 and exported to Germany,Holland,France
 Italy,Belgium and Scandinavia via     
 Dover or Felixstowe in refrigerated   
 trucks. August to February is the     
 busy season and the 10 permanent      
 workers from Letham and Forfar are    
 increased to 15. The deer and rabbit  
 skins are tanned and used in making   
 leather goods in England.             
  The Dutch parent company is based in 
 Boston,Lincolnshire.
