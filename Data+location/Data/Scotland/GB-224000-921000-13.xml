		<title>13Woman's Life in Inchnadamph</title>
		<content> Women here turn their hands to any-   
 thing and work hard. They like animals
 and care about people. They help with 
 the cows and feed the lambs,hens,dogs,
 cats and poultry. Women get up at 7.00
 and go to bed at 11.00pm. They must   
 make a packed lunch for the menfolk,  
 giving them tomato, venison, cheese or
 egg sandwiches plus biscuits, buns and
 a flask of coffee. Dinner (6.00pm) is 
 soup, meat and vegetables and pudding.
 Washing is done by electric machine   
 and hung to dry. In sparetime, a woman
 might knit and usually goes to the    
{Women's Rural Institute}in Lochinver  
 once a month. Also once a month there 
 are{Presbyterian services}in Elphin   
 (16km) where she may go with her      
 family. Holidays are spent visiting   
 relatives elsewhere. In summer she may
 take paying guests for bed and break- 
 fast or work part-time in the hotel.  </content>
