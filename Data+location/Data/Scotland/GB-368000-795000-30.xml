50-50 is our favourite game because it keeps us fit and it is very fun you need 5 or more people to play. First you need to pick any random person to count. Then you need to find somewhere to be your base or home. Next the counter needs to count to 50 while everyone else hides. When the counter has finished counting he/she has to look for everyone else hiding. The counter needs to tag you before you get to base/home. So when the counter isn't looking you can run back to base and when get to base you need to say 50-50 home and when you tag somone you need to say 50-50 caught. The last person at base is it for the next game. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
