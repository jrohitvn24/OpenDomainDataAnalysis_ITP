   There are two types of housing in   
 this area,council houses and private  
 houses.The council homes are on two   
 estates,Douglas and Whitfield.Douglas 
 was built in the early 1950's.There   
 are tenements and semi_detached houses
 in Douglas.Whitfield was built in the 
 late 1960's.The houses are a Swedish  
 design called Skarne blocks.From the  
 air the houses are shaped in a hexagon
 with drying areas in the middle.This  
 is not a good idea because of         
 vandalism.To make the houses more     
 private and less open,they are being  
 alterted.Houses are being built by    
 Barratt,Baird and Bett companies in   
 the private sector.
