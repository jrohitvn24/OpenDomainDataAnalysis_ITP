		<title>14Religion in Guildtown Area.</title>
		<content> All of this area is in the Parish of  
 St.Martin's. St.Martin's Church is the
 only one in the area. It is Church of 
 Scotland by denomination. The Minister
 is the Reverend Mr. J. Shirra who also
 has a Church in Scone, six miles away.
 Mr.Shirra visits the local school     
 almost every Tuesday afternoon.       
                                       
 Only six families in the school       
 actually attend the Parish Church.    
                                       
 Others attend ones nearer their homes 
 ( eg in Burrelton for those who live  
 in Wolfhill) or those of their own    
 denomination (eg Baptist, Methodist,  
 R.C., Congregationalist.) Others      
 prefer to go to Perth or Dundee where 
 their parents attended.               
                                       
 There are two Moslem families in the  
 area who have no Mosque anywhere near.</content>
