		<title>15LAW&amp;ORDER RAFFORD AREA</title>
		<content> The Rafford area is very law abiding  
 and there were no serious crimes last 
 year in Rafford.There is no permanent 
 police station in Rafford but every   
 morning police cars go to the area and
 they have accasional speed traps.On   
 Friday 21st June there was a bush fire
 in the Rafford area and the police had
 to attend. Only one fire engine went  
 to the fire. The fire started when    
 they  were burning sticks on Thursday 
 and then the fire restarted. The most 
 frequent incidents are traffic        
 offences and the only vandalisism is  
 breaking of windows. The bad spots on 
 the road are the many blind bends and 
 the narrowness of the road is also a  
 hazard. The police are often called   
 out in the winter when the roads      
 easily become blocked by drifting     
 snow and many houses can become cut   
 off.                                  </content>
