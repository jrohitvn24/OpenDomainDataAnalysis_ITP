		<title>04LOCHAR MOSS</title>
		<content>   The most prominent feature of this  
 area is the {LOCHAR MOSS.}Mention has 
 already been made of its effect on the
 roads into the area.In past times it  
 served as a natural moat to protect   
 the town of Dumfries.                 
   Its main use was to provide fuel for
 the people in the district.Tons of    
 pure peat were cut and dried on the   
 moss before being transported by      
 horses and carts thus lowering the    
 level of the moss considerably.The    
 sphagnum moss was used for insulation 
 between the walls of houses and the   
 denser material for fuel.With         
 the coming of the railway giving      
 access to cheap coal from Upper       
 Nithsdale,peat cutting declined       
 greatly. Today a lot of the land has  
 been reclaimed  and areas of the moss 
 are presently being reclaimed by      
 extensive drainage work.              </content>
