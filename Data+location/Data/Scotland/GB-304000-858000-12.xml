		<title>12LIFE STYLES FORRES EAST</title>
		<content> The year 1985 in Forres has not       
 brought any stunning new trends in {  
{fashion}but there are a few starting  
 in London.This year Forres's fashion  
 for girls is skirts,(knee-length)     
 flowery blouses and three-quarter     
 length trousers and all these clothes 
 are on pastel shades which is         
 definately in.                        
 For the boys, the styles are:         
 trousers, white and very baggy, and   
 shirts also, white and very baggy.    
 Although these fashions are in for    
 boys, you still get the few who dress 
 in the styles of punk, mod and casual.
  Accessories for the girls are:       
 earrings, jumbo clips for the hair and
 pastel coloured necklaces.  Also for  
 the hairstyles it is either bobs, hair
 cut short or very long hair tied back 
 in a long pleat.  All in all,         
 fashion-wise, Forres is quite trendy. </content>
