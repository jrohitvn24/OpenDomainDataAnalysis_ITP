		<title>16Interview with the Russels</title>
		<content> Mr and Mrs Russel have rented the     
 shop and house for two years now. They
 both work in the shop but only Mr.A.  
 Russel works in the upholstery        
 business. They mostly sell newspapers 
 and stamps,but also sell food,        
 cigarettes and other things. As it is 
 a small shop most people get their    
 groceries in Castle Douglas and only  
 get things like milk from the shop.   
 Mr.A.Russel has had the upholstery    
 business only four years. He covers   
 antique chairs and other furniture.   
 The mill beside the shop was used for 
 grinding corn and was shut down in    
 1959 as it was uneconomical, no-one   
 would work in it and it could not be  
 used.
