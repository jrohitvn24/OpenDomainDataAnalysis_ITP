 in{St.Combs}is just above the national
 average having{4.8.}We also discovered
 that the average amount of children in
 a{St.Combs}family is above the        
 national too having{3.2.}There are few
 divorces in our area as it is a       
 friendly community. Nearly all the    
 children in our D block attend either

{Academy,}depending on age.In recent   
 years more and more incomers have come
