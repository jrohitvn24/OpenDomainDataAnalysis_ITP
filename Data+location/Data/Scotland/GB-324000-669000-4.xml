		<title>04EDINBURGH, SHOPS vs CENTRE</title>
		<content> We visited 12 shops consisting of 7   
 food shops (2 grocers, delicatessen,  
 baker, dairy, confectionary and a     
 greengrocer)and 5 others( chemist,    
 ironmonger and 3 newsagents. 5 of the 
 shops had been in business for many   
 years and the sweet shop since 19th   
 century.                              
 Since Cameron Toll Shopping Centre was
 built, most of the shops had been     
 forced to lower their prices. Some    
 said that business had been reduced.  
 One shop had been an ironmonger for 43
 years and had felt a recent big loss  
 of business.The Centre with 45 shops  
 had been built on a very good site at 
 the junction of many main routes in   
 the quiet bit of the city.People could
 easily use cars or the good bus       
 service to do their main shopping. Now
 the local shops served the older folk 
 who weren't able to travel.           </content>
