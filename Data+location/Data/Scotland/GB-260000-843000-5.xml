		<content>   Coal, gas, oil and electricity are  
 the most common kinds of fuel used in 
 this area.In Bunchrew caravan site    
 (residential) they have coal fires and
 gas cookers.The gas is obtainable on  
 the site itself, therefore saving the 
 residents having to travel to         
 Inverness. Most of the new houses have
 coal fires and electric cookers.      
 Bunchrew is not a smokeless zone so   
 wood is burned as well as coal. There 
 are two houses in the village with oil
 heating. The houses on the outskirts  
 of our block are near enough to have  
 gas piped into them. Gas central      
 heating is popular in these new       
 houses.
