		<content> The landscape is noticeable without   
 trees, small areas have been          
 cultivated into farms, but the rest is
 moorland, of which some has been used 
 for peat cutting and the rest for the 
 common grazing of sheep. The people   
 who live in the area ae mainly farmers
 Most of the farms have been in the    
 same family for several generations.  
 Originally the land was divided into  
 the square fields of the crofting     
 system, and still the old croft houses
 can be seen, but now they are in      
 ruins. Many of the old houses were    
 bult of local stone from the nwo      
 disused quarry, and some of the       
 out-buildings had walsl and floors    
 made from whole pieces of Carthness   
 flagstones. There is a strong         
 community spirit, everyone helping out
 at harvest time etc.
