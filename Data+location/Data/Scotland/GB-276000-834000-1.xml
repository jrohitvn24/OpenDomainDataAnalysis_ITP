		<title>01Introducing Moy</title>
		<content>   MOY-Magh in Gaelic meaning meadow or
 plain is situated 12 miles south east 
 of INVERNESS. It stands 275 metres    
 above sea level with the surrounding  
 hills rising to 600 metres. Much snow 
 can be expected in winter.            
  The area around Moy is made up of    
 farmland and forestry. In 1945 the    
 landowner of the time _ the 29th      
 Chief of MACKINTOSH _ fued 2000 acres 
 to the Forestry Commission. The       
 present chief _ Lachlan the 30th Chief
 _ lives in Moy Hall which is situated 
 to the north of Loch Moy. The present 
 Moy Hall is the fourth Moy Hall and   
 was completed in 1957.                
  In Loch Moy there are two islands. On
 one stands a tall granite obelisk     
 erected by Dame Margaret Mackintosh in
 memory of her husband Aeneas 23rd     
 Chief. The second island _ a clachan  
 and home for birds _ was a prison.    </content>
