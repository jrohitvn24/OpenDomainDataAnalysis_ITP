		<content> The sporting fixtures are against a   
 number of different teams.  Most are  
 between other Scottish public schools,
 but some, notably in Cricket and      
 Hockey are played against club teams. 
 For instance, the Cricket 1st XI plays
 against the M.C.C. amongst others.    
 There are hockey fixtures against     
 teams from Perth, for instance, a team
 from General Accident.  Without a     
 doubt, though, the main fixture for   
 any sport is that against our         
 Perthshire neighbours, Strathallan.   
   There are differing attitudes to the
 sports played. The main clash of      
 opinions is about Rugby. Many do not  
 like it, and do not like being forced 
 to play it.  It is normally the case  
 that they do like Soccer, and many    
 arguments can be heard about the      
 merits of the two sports.
