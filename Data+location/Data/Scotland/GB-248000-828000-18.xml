		<title>18SCHOOLS IN DRUMNADROCHIT</title>
		<content>{Drumnadrochit}has both a primary      
 and a secondary school,which          
 originally shared the same{1892}site. 
 A new primary school was built in     
 1978.At present it has 72 pupils in 4 
 classes. However the number of pupils 
 is dropping which means there will    
 only be 3 teachers in the new session 
 resulting in more composite classes.  
  {The secondary}has 100 pupils coming 
 not only from Drumnadrochit but also  
 from Glenurquhart,Glenmoriston and    
 Cannich (up to 23 miles away).There   
 are 10 full time teachers and 5 part  
 time.Improvments have been made       
 demolishing some of the old buildings 
 and replacing them by demountables. In
 the first 2 years pupils take 13      
 different{subjects}.By the end of 2nd 
 year they have to choose specific     
 subjects from the 17 on offer for     
 'O'grade and 'H'grade courses.        </content>
