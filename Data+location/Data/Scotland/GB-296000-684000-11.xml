		<title>11A SHORT HISTORY OF CULROSS 3</title>
		<content>   Culross also became well-known for  
 its baking girdles and in l599 James  
 VI granted the Culross smiths a       
 monopoly for making them. It was to   
 last l5Oyrs. In l575 Sir George Bruce,
 the most important person in the      
 history of Culross, took over Culross 
 colliery. He made Culross so          
 prosperous it was made a Royal Burgh  
 and he built himself a house so grand 
 it was dubbed "The Palace". In l625 a 
 great storm destroyed the under-sea   
 mine workings and shortly after, Sir  
 George died. Mining died out and with 
 it salt-panning. Carron,across the    
 Forth, produced cheaper cast-iron     
 girdles.The people of Culross tried   
 other professions, without success.   
 The village fell on hard times. In a  
 way this was the secret of Culross's  
 success today. They couldn't afford   
 new houses and wider streets.         </content>
