		<title>15The climate of Durris</title>
		<content> In our block the weather varies a lot.
 In spring we often get a lot of wind  
 and rain and the occasional hot,sunny 
 day.It is now midsummer and the       
 weather is still very changeable.In   
 summer we can get a lot of fine days, 
 even into September.Autumn round here 
 is quite windy,but usually dry. Our   
 winter starts in mid November and     
 doesn't stop until April.We often get 
 heavy snow,particularly in January.It 
 can also be very cold in winter with  
 temperatures as low as -27c,which     
 causes problems.However,every winter  
 is not as bad as that,and sometimes it
 can be quite mild.Another feature of  
 our climate is fog.This can come at   
 any time of year,but the summer fog or
 "haar"is strange.It comes over the    
 hills from the sea,about ten miles    
 away,and can be very thick.You never  
 quite know what our weather will do.  </content>
