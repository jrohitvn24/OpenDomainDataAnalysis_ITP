		<title>11Farming in Tongue</title>
		<content> There are only two farms in Tongue    
 area, one being the {Home Farm }with  
{Tongue House,}and the other belongs to
 an estate and is managed.  Both grow  
 crops which are mainly used as feeding
 for the stock which is cattle and     
 sheep. One farm has a large rough     
 grazing viz.24000acres and there are  
 six workers. The other is much smaller
 and there are only two workers.       
 Cereals are not grown, the weather is 
 generally not very good for them, but 
 hay and silage are made.              
 Any other arable ground in the area is
{croft land, }family owned small       
 holdings. Very little cultivation is  
 done on these, some potatoes and      
 turnips, but hay is made for winter   
 feed. Some cattle are kept and many   
 sheep.
