		<title>15The Pump House</title>
		<content> When the Hydro Electric Scheme started
 there were flood-banks put along parts
 of the river. There was also a pump   
 house built on Carlingwark Lane. When 
 there is a high flow of water coming  
 down the river to make the electricity
 the pumps can be put on to control the
 flow of water from Carlingwark Loch to
 the River Dee.                        
 The fields round about the lane are   
 mainly meadow-land. The lane was a man
 made waterway which was constructed   
 for the purpose of taking marle which 
 was then regarded as a fertiliser. The
 lane was designed to take barges      
 filled with marle from Carlingwark    
 Loch to the River Dee and then they   
 went downstream to all the farms along
 the river.
