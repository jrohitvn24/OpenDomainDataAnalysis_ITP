		<content> This led to the withdrawal of a       
 full-time missionary around the       
 beginning of this century. Slamannan  
 Parish minister then assumed full     
 responsibility and this remains the   
 situation at the moment.              
 On 30th December,1951 the old church  
 building was virtually destroyed      
 during the height of a gale. The      
 Rev.Alexander Cameron,M.A. with the   
 help of the local miners rebuilt the  
 present building. During the          
 mid-seventies more renovation work was
 carried out and the overall decoration
 of the building improved.             
 Throughout its 100 year existance the 
 mission church has witnessed great    
 changes. From the halcyon days of the 
 mining industry right through to the  
 present days of depression. The local 
 community  guard jealously their      
 inheritance.                          </content>
