		<title>15Kirtle Kirk</title>
		<content> Kirtle Kirk was built in 1840 and     
 renovated in 1897 when the Bell Tower 
 and Vestry were added. The foundation 
 stone was laid by Mr Johnston Ferguson
 of Springkell. The original Kirk was  
 built by Rev. John Irving of Bonshaw  
 and is situated by the Lodge Gate to  
 Bonshaw Tower. The Manse sits to the  
 west of the Kirk on ground belonging  
 to Bonshaw. The parish is linked with 
 Eaglesfield. There is a Ladies Choir  
 and Guild.                            
 Creca village has no church. There is 
 an old mission hall now a dwelling    
 house. Villagers attend Kirks and     
 churches in neighbouring parishes.
