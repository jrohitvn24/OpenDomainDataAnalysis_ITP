		<title>11HEALTHY MILTON CHILDREN.</title>
		<content> In Milton School,health is carefully  
 watched.When the{audiometrician}comes 
 to test ears,she puts earphones on us 
 and turns knobs on a machine behind   
 us.If we hear a certain sound,we tell 
 her.The{nurse}tests our eyes by       
 standing in front of us,holding a card
 and we say the letter or copy the     
 direction of the hand on the card.Each
 spring the{dentist's}van comes for two
 weeks .It is fitted like the surgery  
 in Markinch.We wash out our mouths    
 with pink liquid after he examines our
 teeth.A cable from the van gets       
 electricity from the school.The{school
{doctor}thoroughly checks us in our    
 first and last years,but the{nurse  } 
 comes often to check hair and         
 skin.I like the{chiropodist}best,for  
 he is funny when he examines your     
 feet.All schools in Fife have the same
 care as Milton of Balgonie.           </content>
