		<content>    In our area Leisure and Recreation 
 facilities are extremely limited.     
 There is a clay-pigeon shoot which is 
 open to people 16 years of age and    
 over. Walking in the area is          
 restricted due to farmland,walking on 
 the roads is dangerous due to         
 excessive speed of vehicles.          
                                       
   There is a swimming pool in Cupar   
 which is approximately 8 miles away.  
 Cinema and theatre are catered for in 
 St. Andrews which is 6 miles away.    
 Excellent golfing facilities exsist in
 St. Andrews. Youth organisation are   
 also to be found in St. Andrews and   
 Cupar. The major problem is transport 
 to the facilities as the public       
 transport service is extremely limited
 . Children have to rely on parents    
 transporting them to these centres    
 which is not always convenient.       </content>
