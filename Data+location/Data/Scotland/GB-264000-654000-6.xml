		<content> MOTHER'S DAY IN EAST KILBRIDE         
 My mum gets up at about 7.50am on a   
 school day.She gets washed,dressed and
 then goes to the kitchen for breakfast
 After that she washes the dishes and  
 gets ready to go to work.She teaches  
 near Hamilton at a school for handi-  
 capped children.Work begins at 9.00am 
 and finishes at 3.00pm.My mum is      
 always tired after her day teaching   
 home-economics.Usually she makes a cup
 of coffee when she gets home,and sits 
 watching the television.It is soon    
 time for her to make the dinner,so I  
 usually help her by peeling potatoes. 
 After  dinner my big brothers do the  
 dishes and my  parents and I go to the
 shopping  centre.My parents get the   
 food while I buy sweets.When we get in
 my mum has more coffee and tea,then   
 she watches television till around    
 11.30pm.                              </content>
