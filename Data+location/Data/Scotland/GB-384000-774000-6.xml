		<title>06GAMES WE PLAY IN KINNEFF</title>
		<content> Some of the games we play in the      
 playground or at home are_football,   
 pool,hide_and_seek,high_tig and{      
{"Bottle of Poison."}                  
   To play{"Bottle of Poison"}you      
 choose two catchers who stand beside  
 each other and hold out their hands   
 with their fingers apart. The other   
 players hold one of the catcher's     
 fingers and get ready to run away from
 them when they say "Bottle of Poison  
 1_2_3". The catchers can say "Bottle  
 of Poison 1_2_4",or something like    
 that but they have to say "Bottle of  
 Poison 1_2_3" before they go chasing  
 the players. When they catch you,     
 you must put your arms up against the 
 wall until someone comes and goes     
 under your arms.Then you are free.It  
 is best having a catcher guarding     
 those caught.When everyone is caught  
 then you change catchers.             </content>
