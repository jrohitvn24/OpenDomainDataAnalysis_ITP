 employs about 40 people.  It has grown
 in size and now is a large firm with  
 a fleet of 6 lorries which are always 
 on the move taking the products the   
 length and breadth of the country,    
 to places as far away as Cardiff,     
 Bristol and London.  The vegetables   
 are{leeks, cabbage, cauliflower,      
{lettuce, swedes}and{potatoes}and the  
 fruit is{raspberries}and{strawberries.
 This produce comes from about 60      
 different farms in the area.          
   The large shed where the work is    
 done is a hive of activity, with      
 conveyor-belts carrying potatoes to be
 sorted, graded, washed and packed.    
 Until they are transported the        
 vegetables are taken to another shed  
 which is kept cold to keep them fresh.</content>
