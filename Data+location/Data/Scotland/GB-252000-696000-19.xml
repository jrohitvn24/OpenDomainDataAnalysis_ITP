		<title>19GARTMORE HOUSE - PAST OWNERS</title>
		<content>  {Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham   
 lived in Gartmore House until 1900 and
 was a well-known author and poet. He  
 travelled in Argentina and Uruguay as 
 "Don Roberto", and he and his black   
 horse, Pampa, were a well loved sight 
 in Gartmore. He died in 1936 and was  
 buried on Inchmahome in the Lake of   
 Menteith. A memorial is erected at the
 top of the village to him.            
  {The Cayser family}bought Gartmore   
 House in 1900 and lived there until   
 the estate was bought in 1956.  Most  
 villagers worked for the estate and   
 bought their houses when the estate   
 was sold. In the Cayser burial ground 
 there is a Moondial set to Gartmore   
 time.                                 
   Gartmore House was then bought      
 by the{De La Salle order}of teaching  
 brothers who, until 1982, ran a List D
 school for Roman Catholic boys.       </content>
