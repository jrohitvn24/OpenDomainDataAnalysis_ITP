		<title>15Pitreavie Castle (1)</title>
		<content> The land on Which Pitreavie Castle    
 stands, which is in squares eight and 
 twelve, did not pass into the hands of
 the government until ninetten thirty  
 eight.  It cost the air ministry      
 12,306 pounds.                        
 Ever since NATO was formed in         
 1948,Pitreavie has been the home of   
 the Joint Maritime Headquarters in the
 north. There is only one other base   
 like this in the whole of the U.K.,   
 and it is therefore quite important.  
 There is quite a lot of houses to     
 accomodate the R.A.F. personel and    
 their families. The recreation        
 facilities are quite good, including a
 NAAFI Officer's Club, a gym, squash   
 courts, tennis courts and a fottball  
 pitch.    Paul Steele
