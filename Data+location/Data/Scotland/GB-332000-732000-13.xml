 of Liff.It is a large hospital for the
 mentally infirm and was formerly known
 as West Green.It now incorporates an  
 old dwelling called Gowrie House      
 bought for the use of old patients.   
 Next to the house is a small tennis   
 court surrounded by large grassy areas
 intermingled with flowers and shrubs. 
    To the South of the hospital there 
 are the Gardens of Gray.These gardens 
 were used to produce food for the Earl
 of Murray and his family who lived in 
 the Gray House.For more information
