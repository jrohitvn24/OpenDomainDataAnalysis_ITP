		<content> The need for an efficient and regular 
 bus service can be seen by the fact   
 that there are only a few local shops 
 and this necessitates travel to       
 Kirkcaldy, Dunfermline or Edinburgh   
 for clothing, furniture, electrical   
 goods and foodstuffs not available in 
 Dalgety Bay. Transport is also        
 required to take people to work       
 outwith Dalgety Bay. Even though the  
 majority of families own a car, wives 
 and children still require transport  
 to get them to work and to the High   
 School. There is an hourly bus service
 between Dunfermline and Leven, and    
 between Edinburgh and Leven. These two
 routes provide a half hourly service  
 to Kirkcaldy. A local service from    
 Dunfermline to Dalgety Bay runs hourly
 from Monday to Saturday.
