		<title>12SHEEP FARMING : CANNICH AREA</title>
		<content>{Sheep farming}in the area consists    
 mainly of{Scotch Blackface}with a few 
{Cheviots. }On most farms the younger  
 Blackface Ewes are bred pure while    
 older ones are mated with Border      
 Leicester and Suffolk rams to produce 
 a bigger lamb.  Some flocks are       
 maintained totally on hill land, some 
 part hill part arable and some on     
 arable alone.  Annual Autumn culling  
 of hill ewes provides a certain amount
 of sheep for low ground farms where   
 cross breeding is the system followed.
 Many lambs, especially from hill land,
 are sold at store auctions, like the  
 calves, but a certain amount are      
 reared to "finishing point" i.e.      
 butchering conditions.  In the last   
 few years entire flocks have been sold
 from some hill areas and the ground   
 left to deer alone.
