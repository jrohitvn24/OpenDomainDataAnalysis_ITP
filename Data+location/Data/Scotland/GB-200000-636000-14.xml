		<title>14THE SAWMILL - ARRAN</title>
		<content>   The sawmill at Cladach has been in  
 operation since 1914.  Originally     
 owned by Arran Estates it is now run  
 by the Clark family.                  
   There is a large range of equipment 
 including circular saws, pressure     
 tanks, tractors and a forklift truck. 
 All replacements come from the        
 mainland and are shipped over by      
 ferry.                                
   Those employed at the sawmill work 8
 hours a day, 6 days a week.  Two men  
 are employed to cut the wood before it
 comes to the sawmill and soft woods   
 mainly are selected. Anyone can buy   
 the sawn wood.  Most of it is sold for
 fencing, building and sheds.          
   Wood is sent to Oban, Ayrshire and  
 England but the main market is on     
 Arran. Surplus wood is sold as fire-  
 wood and the sawdust goes to farmers  
 for bedding for their animals.        </content>
