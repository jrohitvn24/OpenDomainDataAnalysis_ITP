		<title>16WESTFIELD MINE : POLLUTION</title>
		<content> The excavations associated with       
 Westfield pit have brought about      
{severe water pollution}which has      
 affected both the water entering the  
 pit and the streams flowing in the    
 vicinity of the mining complex.       
 The water which lies in the foot of   
 the pit and the Lochty Burn which     
 flows around the southern boundary of 
 the mine are{bright red in colour and 
{can support no life at all.}(The water
 in the pit has a{ph value of 2.5 }    
 - highly acidic )                     
 Acids, in particular sulphuric acid,  
 are being created in the ground waters
 entering the pit. Several streams     
 which are bright red in colour enter  
 the pit along natural aquafers. This  
 polluted water also finds its way into
 the natural streams making the{Lochty 
{Burn}technically{one of the most      
{polluted water courses in Scotland.  }</content>
