		<content>   The Hydro-Board is the largest      
 single local employer including       
 fourteen engineers working on a       
 shift/standby system. There is an     
 exhibition explaining the function of 
 the dam employing three people.       
   Pitlochry power station and dam was 
 completed in 1950, with a length of   
 486 yards including the cut-off wall. 
 It generates about 54 million units of
 electricity a year from water flowing 
 off a catchment area of 706 square    
 miles . The water flows at a rate of  
 16 m.p.h. through the two Kaplan      
 turbines turning the blades which     
 drive two 7,000 kw generators. When   
 operated at full capacity about 1.5   
 million gallons of water passes       
 through them each minute.             
   There is a 35 step fish ladder which
 so far this year has been used by 431 
 fish, a marked decline on past years. </content>
