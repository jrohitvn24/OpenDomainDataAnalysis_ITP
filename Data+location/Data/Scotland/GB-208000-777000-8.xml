{Tree Harvest}                         
      The trees will be harvested in   
 stages. The first crop from a         
 plantation is not usually ready for   
 harvesting until the trees have been  
 growing for about twenty years.       
      The timber from this crop will be
 used to make paper and chipboard      
 which is used in the manufacture of   
 modern furniture.                     
      A second and third crop can be   
 harvested as the trees grow bigger,   
 and eventually reach maturity. At this
 stage the trees will have been growing
 for at least thirty years. The trees  
 will then be sold to a sawmill which  
 will saw the timber into boards for   
 house building and furniture making.
