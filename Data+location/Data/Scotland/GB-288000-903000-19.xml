		<content> BRORA HIGH SCHOOL IS THE ONLY SCHOOL  
 IN BRORA, EXCEPT FOR TORDALE WHICH IS 
 FOR HANDICAPPED PEOPLE.               
    THE DISTILLERY MAKES CLYNELISH     
 WHISKY AND OTHER KINDS OF DRINKS. IT  
 SENDS THE DRINKS ALL OVER THE         
 HIGHLANDS.                            
    THERE IS A SMALL SURGERY IN BRORA. 
 IT HAS A WAITING ROOM, A DENTIST, A   
 BABY ROOM AND AN EXAMINING ROOM. THERE
 ARE TWO DOCTORS. THEY ARE CALLED Dr   
 MACDONALD AND Dr BETTS-BROWN. THE     
 DENTIST COMES IN ABOUT ONCE A WEEK.   
    THERE ARE A LOT OF SHOPS IN BRORA  
 FOR SUCH A SMALL VILLAGE. THEY MAKE   
 QUITE A LOT OF MONEY. MOST THINGS THAT
 ARE NEEDED WOULD BE ABLE TO BE BOUGHT 
 IN BRORA.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
