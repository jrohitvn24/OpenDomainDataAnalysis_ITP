		<content> The area we are surveying is 12       
 square kilometres. It consists of 2   
 main areas of housing, Foxbar and     
 Glenburn. There is very little        
 industry, with the exception of       
 Grants in Glenburn and the carpet     
 works at Elderslie. The rest of our   
 area is mainly open spaces, used for  
 various activities, including         
 farming,recreation and open moorland. 
 There are a number of parks, Brodie   
 Park, The Glen Park(a country park),  
 Robertson Park and 2 golf courses,    
 Paisley Golf Club and Elderslie Golf  
 Club.The southern end of our area is  
 much higher than the rest. This area  
 of upland is called Gleniffer Braes.  
 The other outstanding feature is the  
 Stanely Reservoir, almost in the      
 middle of the area.
