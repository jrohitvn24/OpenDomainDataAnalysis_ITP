		<title>17A Staxigoe Wedding</title>
		<content> On Friday 21st June Shiela Gunn was   
 married to William Mowat in the Parish
 Church, Wick. The bride was beautiful 
 in a white wedding dress with cream   
 sleeves, and the two bridesmaids were 
 in long turquoise dresses with white  
 shoes. The 130 guests sang two hymns  
 "Thine be my Son", and "Morning has   
 Broken". After the wedding service we 
 went to the reception in Staxigoe     
 Hall. This was the first wedding      
 reception since 30 years. The wedding 
 meal was magnificent with different   
 kinds of meat, salad, and salmon. For 
 dessert there was strawberry          
 cheesecake, fresh fruit, meringues and
 cheese. At about 9.30 pm the dance    
 started with Bobby Coghill's dance    
 band. More guests arrived for the     
 dance which continued until 2 am.
