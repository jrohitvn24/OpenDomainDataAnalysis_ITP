		<title>05The Cairn</title>
		<content> The Cairn can be found on a grassy    
 patch on Cairnlee Avenue East.It is   
 about 4000 years and was built by     
 prehistoric hunters and farmers.It is 
 protected under the ancient monuments 
 act and it is an offence to remove    
 stones or otherwise damage it.        
 The Cairn is one of the oldest parts  
 of Cults.It was originally one of     
 three Cairns but unfortunately in     
 December 1829 the other two Cairns    
 were demolished to help repair flood  
 damaged banks on the River Dee.       
 There are four places on the Cairn    
 where there are hollows.We think that 
 the people who demolished the other   
 two Cairns might have needed more     
 stones so they took some from this    
 Cairn.                                
 We think that the Cairn is still in   
 good condition even after 4000 years.
