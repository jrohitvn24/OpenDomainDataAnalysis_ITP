		<content> Except for the  ploughing of the      
 infield there is no cultivation of    
 the land.  These fields are used to   
 hold surplus stock before it is taken 
 to market at Ayr.  The soil of the    
 valley is poor.  Most years the area  
 has a lot of rain  and the growing    
 season is short.  The farm lies more  
 than 200 metres above sea level except
 for the former policies of Camlarg    
 bordering the Cummock Water which Mr  
 Ireland uses for grazing new lambs.   
                                       
 Our group paid two visits to          
 Pennyvenie Farm to talk to Mr and Mrs 
 Ireland.  During the second of these  
 we walked over part of his lands to   
 see places and things he had told us  
 about. This included part of the      
 former village of Pennyvenie and the  
 disused railway that served the old   
 mines.                                </content>
