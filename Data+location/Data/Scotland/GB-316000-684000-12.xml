		<title>12BUS PASS ROW IN DALGETY BAY</title>
		<content> Recently in our area there has been a 
 row about the giving of free bus      
 passes to school children.The row     
 has been going on for some time       
 now,because many children are within  
 the limits of two miles from          
{Inverkeithing High.}Even though people
 have different views about the matter 
 it still looks like a fair majority of
 children in the{Bay}are not going to  
 get their passes.Also many parents    
 have been measuring the distance from 
 their homes to the{High School}to see 
 if their children should get          
 passes,and to try and persuade the    
{Education Authority}to give one to all
 the children in{Dalgety Bay.}In our   
 class only three children will get    
 one.It will cost our parents about{Â£70
 to us buy a season ticket.A return    
 journey costs{36p}a day so we would   
 save up about{Â£70.                    </content>
