 contains the eastern half of a town   
 with a {population}of{7725},called {

 to the north of the town is the{Moray 
{Firth.}The {River Nairn}passes through
 our D-Block.In the eastern half of our
 block we have part of a village called
{Auldearn.}About three quarters of our 
 D-Block consists of farm land.In the  
 north east corner of our block there  
 is part of a forestry plantation of   
 the{Culbin Forest.

 is the{Dunbar Golf Course},which runs 
 parallel to a caravan park and a      
 stretch of marram covered sand dunes  
 and tidal coastline.Traversing our    
 block is the A96 road and the         
 Aberdeen-Inverness railway.           </content>
