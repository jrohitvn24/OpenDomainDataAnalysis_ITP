		<title>09DORNIE POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The Post Office at Dornie serves the  
 area of Inverinate, Sallachy,         
 Auchtertyre and Dornie.It is not a    
 sorting centre therefore any letters  
 posted are sent to Kyle and then if   
 necessary on to Iverness.The main     
 business of the post office involves  
 the payment of pensions and child     
 benefit allowances as well as the sale
 of stamps.Previously there was much   
 work in the purchase of postal and    
 money orders as well as the sending of
 telegrams but this has been reduced.  
 During July and August the post office
 is busy with tourists buying and      
 sending post cards. The majority of   
 customers are however local. With the 
 removal of the sorting it has been    
 possible to use the extra space for   
 other goods such as wool, fishing     
 tackle and greetings cards.
