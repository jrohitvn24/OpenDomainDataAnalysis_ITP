		<content> The area we have studied is situated  
 in the{West of Scotland}approximately 
 twelve miles from{Glasgow.}Our area is
 a rural one comprising a great deal of
 arable land,farms,small-holdings and  
 small villages.Although linked to     
{Glasgow} by the{M8}motorway,areas of  
 habitation are connected by winding   
 roads lined with hedgerows.The small  
 villages of{Kilbarchan,Brookfield and 
{Crosslee}which lie deep in the        
 countryside provide ideal homes for   
 people who commute to nearby{Glasgow.}
 Alternatively retired people who want 
 to have a quiet life also stay in     
 these villages.To the east of{        
{Kilbarchan}are the small towns of{    
{Linwood}and{Johnstone.}Both towns had 
 factories but when they closed down   
 many jobs were lost.Now the two towns,
 especially{Linwood}have a high level  
 of unemployment.                      </content>
