		<title>14Length of Day _ Mulben</title>
		<content>                                       
 Spring comes later to Mulben than to  
 the South of England.  Mulben is, of  
 course, 500 miles further north.      
 Crops are sown later in the North of  
 Scotland, but are ready for harvesting
 almost as soon as crops in the South  
 of England.                           
 There are more daylight hours here in 
 Summer  than in the South.  On        
 June 24th, we calculated the length of
 day in the North of Scotland and      
 compared it with the number of hours  
 of daylight in the South.             
 In London, sunrise and sunset were at 
 04.44 hours and 21.22 hours, _  giving
 16 hours, 38 minutes of daylight,     
 while in the North of Scotland, we had
 17 hours, 55 minutes of daylight.     
 Sunrise and sunset were at 04.13 hours
 and 22.08 hours.
