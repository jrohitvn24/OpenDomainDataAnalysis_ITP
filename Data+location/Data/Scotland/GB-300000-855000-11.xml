		<title>11FISHING West Forres</title>
		<content> A part of the River Findhorn is leased
 by Moray District Council to Forres   
 ANgling Association.Permits may be    
 bought to fish with rod and line for  
 salmon and sea trout from 11th        
 February to 6th October from Red CRaig
 to Findhorn Bay.There are several     
 favourite pools on this stretch: Red  
 Craig,Cothall Shot,Limekilns Pool,St  
 John's Pool,New Pool and AShen Tree   
 Pool.The Findhorn is a spring river   
 and the fish travel up the river in   
 spring.On one night in  1780 one      
 thousand fish were caught by net in   
 the SLUIE POOL.Fishing by net is no   
 longer permitted.Since 1900 however   
 numbers have declined perhaps because 
 more fish are caught at sea.Another   
 reason is that every year organised   
 gangs from further south use          
 explosives and poison to poach        
 salmon,killing everything for a mile. </content>
