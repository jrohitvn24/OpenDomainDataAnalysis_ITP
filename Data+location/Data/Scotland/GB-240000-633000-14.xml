		<content> St.Michael's is the Catholic Church,  
 which was built in 1953. Its beliefs  
 are everything that the Lord taught   
 when he was on earth. On a Sunday the 
 church has 3 masses,at 9.am, 11.am,   
 and 7.pm. A mass is a reading from the
 Scripture and some prayers connected  
 with the Last Supper. Every week day  
 there is a mass at 10.am except       
 Tuesday, when it is held at 7.pm.     
 Thursday is Corpus Christi, which is  
 the Feast of the Body and Blood of    
 Christ and a Holyday of Obligation.   
 Father Walsh hears confession twice a 
 day except Sunday. Although there are 
 more Protestants than Catholics in our
 D-block there is better attendance at 
 mass than at Protestant church        
 services. St.Michael's has a regular  
 congregation of just over 500         
 worshippers.                          
                                       </content>
