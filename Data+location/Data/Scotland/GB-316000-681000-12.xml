		<title>12Family Life Dalgety Bay.</title>
		<content> From a survey, we found that many     
 families came from different parts of 
 Scotland, England, Wales and America. 
 This accounts for the many different  
 accents in the town. The main reason  
 for moving was that the husband had   
 taken up new employment in the area.  
 The majority of new jobs were in      
 Edinburgh with a few with firms  in   
 the local industrial estates. Many    
 families preferred to stay in Dalgety 
 Bay as opposed to Edinburgh because it
 was more scenic; some families had    
 their own yacht and wished to join the
 sailing club; house prices were       
 marginally less than in Edinburgh     
 ranging from 40,000 to 80,000 pounds  
 and travelling time to Edinburgh by   
 road is just 20 minutes.
