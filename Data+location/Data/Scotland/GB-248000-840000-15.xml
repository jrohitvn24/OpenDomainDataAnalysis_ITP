		<content> Beaufort Castle,in the north east of  
 this block is the family seat of Simon
 Fraser,Lord Lovat,and much of the land
 in the Kiltarlity area is owned by    
 Lovat Estates.In all the estates cover
 a total area of 25000 ha.,much of     
 which lies to the west and south of   
 this block.The estates provide        
 employment for many local people in a 
 variety of jobs mainly connected with 
 farming and sporting interests such as
 salmon fishing in the River Beauly and
 game shooting.Most of the best arable 
 land of the area is let to tennant    
 farmers and the Forestry Commission   
 control almost all the commercial     
 woodland,but the estate's Home Farm,  
 near the castle,is used for breeding  
 cattle which are exported world wide  
 as breeding stock.Hereford,Simmental  
 and Angus cattle form the main stock. 
 Barley is also grown at Home Farm.    </content>
