		<title>16MY HOBBY AT PORTESSIE BEACH</title>
		<content>      MY DAD HAS A BOAT CALLED THE     
 OSPREY.  IT IS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD.  
  MY DAD CATCHES LOBSTERS, PARTINS AND 
 EELS IN THE CREELS THAT HE HAS PUT IN 
 THE WATER.                            
      I USUALLY HELP DAD IN THE BOAT.  
 IT IS GREAT FUN.  TO CATCH PARTINS AND
 LOBSTERS, WE USE DIFFERENT KINDS OF   
 BAIT MOSTLY SALT HERRING, SMOKED      
 HERRING OR PLAICE.  THE MOST COMMON   
 PLACES TO CATCH THEM ARE THE BEACON,  
 MUCKS AND THE CROWN.  WE SELL THEM TO 
 SOMEONE IN CULLEN WHO COOKS THEM FOR A
 RESTAURANT.  IF THEY ARE 2 POUND      
 LOBSTERS, YOU WOULD GET Â£10.50 FOR    
 FIVE OF THEM.                         
      WHEN I AM NOT WITH DAD, I CATCH  
 FISH IN THE ROCK POOLS.  I USE A CLEEK
 -THAT IS A BIT OF STICK WITH A HOOKED 
 BIT OF METAL AT THE END OF THE STICK. 
 IF I AM AT THE ROCKS FOR 2 HOURS, I   
 WOULD CATCH ABOUT 3 GRINDIES.         </content>
