    Recorded telephone message to      
 farmers and growers, given by the East
 of Scotland College og Agriculture.   
{ WINTER BARLEY-}Problems should now   
 all be past. Consideration should now 
 be given to new varieties which might 
 be grown next year.                   
{ WINTER WHEAT}-Any fungicide needed   
 should be applied now, particularly   
 against sooty mould.                  
{ SPRING BARLEY}- Early varieties      
 are now headed. For later varieties it
 is still worth spraying.{             
{ POTATOES }-A blight warning is       
 still in force. Seed crops are showing
 damage from weedkiller sprays. It is  
 brought to your notice that no        
 weedkiller is entirely safe.          
{ CATTLE}-Cattle at grass are now due  
 for worming. The college will be      
 pleased to advise about drenches.     </content>
