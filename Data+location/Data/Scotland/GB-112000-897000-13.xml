		<title>13HEALTH CARE IN TARBERT</title>
		<content> There are two doctors in Tarbert.One  
 is permanent and the other replacement
 doctors in practice occupy the other  
 job.                                  
 DR Robertson,the permanent            
 doctor,travels round other places too.
 The most common illness in Harris he  
 treats is upper respiratory tract     
 infections,and the most serious       
 illness he had to deal with was       
 cancer.The medical supplies come from 
 Glasgow and Stornoway.                
 The hours he works are flexible{      
 because he has to travel out to       
 patients who cannot get transport to  
 Tarbert to his surgery.He also has to 
 consult up in Harris House in some    
 evenings.                             
 The district nurse helps the doctor by
 doing the routine calls,changing      
 dressings and doing checkups in       
 schools.                              </content>
