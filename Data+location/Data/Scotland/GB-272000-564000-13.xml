		<content> In my family's sparetime, we usually  
 just sit and read the paper or watch  
 TV. Mum often gets us together to work
 in the garden. Sometimes we go out in 
 the car to visit friends or relatives.
 Some families go out jogging or       
 cycling along the country roads. My   
 family likes riding across the fields.
 It can be a great pleasure if you just
 take it easy. It is not a good idea to
 try jumping over 10 ft walls.         
 When we were young we played games of 
 pretend. We would pretend to be heroes
 from TV programmes, like He-Man and   
 the Master of the Universe. We also   
 played at families. There would be a  
 Dad, Mum, baby and the daughter       
 zooming off with her boy friend on his
 motor bike or wee sports car.
