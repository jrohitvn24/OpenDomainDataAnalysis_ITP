		<content> Half this block consists of sea Loch  
 Slapin and most of the land           
 uncultivated moorland and hill.  The  
 areas 1 and 5 have been fenced drained
 and are now partly covered with       
 forestry commission plantations of    
 conifers, the remainder being         
 uncultivated moorland with a single   
 track road linking the villages of    
 Broadford and Elgol. There is the     
 ancient site of Don Ringill in Square 
 5. The East of Loch Slapin is all     
 uncultivated moorland with the remains
 of the old township of Sursuish       
 (square 11 &amp; 12) but with no habitable
 buildings. A rough track follows the  
 cliffs and is negotiable by Land Rover
 only. There are several sites of      
 antiquities and small fresh waer lochs
 popular with fishermen and            
 naturalists. An area of no permanent  
 human habitation but great beauty.    </content>
