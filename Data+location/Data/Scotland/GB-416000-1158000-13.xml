		<content> Most of the changes in the last few   
 years have been in agriculture.The    
 first modern tractor came to the      
 island in 1960 (a two wheeled tractor 
 had previously replaced the           
 temperamental Icelandic ponies used   
 for ploughing in 1952).Now a bailer,  
 rotavators,ploughs etc are in common  
 use.                                  
   We don't have mains electricity here
 so most people have their own diesel  
 generators.The school's is the largest
 with 5 kw.Generators are only run in  
 the evening usually for a few hours   
 because it's not economic to run a    
 generator for a small load.Therefore  
 freezers and fridges can present      
 difficulties.A small wind generator   
 (producing 12 volts) has run success  
 fully for many years.A bigger wind    
 generator failed,the brakes wore out  
 and the blades fell off within months.</content>
