		<title>05HOME LIFE ON A FARM</title>
		<content>{Homelife}at Auchterforfar farm is     
 demanding. The family work from 7.30 -
 5.00.  The farmer's first and last job
 each day is to check the stock.  His  
 most hated job is{ paperwork }which is
 very time-consuming. However he enjoys
{harvesting}if the weather is good as  
 he can see the results of his labour. 
 Although they live out of town they do
 not miss anything in Forfar.  They    
 aren't too isolated and make frequent 
 visits into town.  The farmer is a    
 church elder and a crime prevention   
 officer.  His wife goes shopping every
 week.  In the evenings his wife knits 
 and reads while the farmer watches TV.
 They have a collie which is a working 
 dog and only occasionally allowed in  
 the house.                            
 Everyone on the farm would            
 recommend farming as a{profession}as  
 they love the countryside.            </content>
