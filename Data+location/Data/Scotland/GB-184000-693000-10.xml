		<title>10RELIGION IN GLASSARY</title>
		<content>   THERE IS ONLY ONE CHURCH IN GLASSARY
 AND THAT IS THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.   
   MOST PEOPLE OF THE VILLAGE ARE      
 NOMINALLY PROTESTANT BUT THERE ARE    
 ONLY TWO FAMILIES WHO BELONG TO THE   
 ROMAN CATHOLIC RELIGION.              
   VERY FEW OF THE VILLAGERS ATTEND    
 THE LOCAL CHURCH NOR DO MANY OF THE   
 CHILDREN ATTEND SUNDAY SCHOOL. THIS IS
 PROBABLY A REFLECTION OF THE GENERAL  
 ATTITUDE TOWARDS RELIGION IN MOST OF  
 PRESENT DAY SCOTLAND.                 
   THE CHURCH HOWEVER IS USED BY MOST  
 OF THE POPULATION AT SOME TIME IN     
 THEIR LIFE, ESPECIALLY FOR BAPTISMS,  
 MARRIAGES AND DEATHS. ON THE OCCASION 
 OF THE LATTER THE CHURCH CAN OFTEN BE 
 FULL TO CAPACITY.                     
   AT EASTER, REMEMBRANCE DAY,         
 CHRISTMAS AND SPECIAL SERVICES THERE  
 CAN OFTEN BE A FAIR SIZED             
 CONGREGATION.                         </content>
