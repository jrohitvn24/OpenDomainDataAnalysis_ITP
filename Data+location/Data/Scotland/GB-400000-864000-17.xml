		<content> The schools have changed since 1965   
 because you didn't have to wear a     
 uniform at the Academy.There are a    
 lot more houses and shops.  Hair,     
 clothes, shoes etc. have all changed. 
 The harbour has been deepened and they
 are going to take in supply boats to  
 fuel them. Everything has gone up in  
 price but there is a lot more pay.    
                                       
 There are many videos and computers.  
 There is a lot of under aged drinking 
 and you can't get a proper night out  
 without under aged drinkers fighting. 
 The Broadgate (Broad Street) has got  
 an island for crossing the road, phone
 boxes and a new bus shelter. All the  
 buses used to be double deckers. There
 is a new shop and tea room at the     
 beach. Many houses are more modern.   
 Many young boys are running around in 
 new cars. .                           </content>
