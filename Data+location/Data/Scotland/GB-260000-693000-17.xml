		<title>17FARMING IN ARNPRIOR</title>
		<content> All of the farms keep some fat stock  
 cattle although one of the small farms
 has only 8 such animals. Typical herd 
 sizes vary between 40-60, but two     
 farms have 200 and 150 beasts         
 respectively. Herefords are the basic 
 breed, but these are usually crossed  
 with such other breeds as Charolais,  
 Limousin, Simmental, Aberdeen Angus or
 Friesian.  Only one farmer has a pure 
 herd - Simmentals - for stock rearing.
 Altogther the farms have more than 700
 fat stock cattle. There is also one   
 small breeding herd of 20 Friesian    
 dairy cattle.  Few other animals are  
 now kept on the farms - two farmers   
 have 20 or 30 hens, one has a few     
 ducks and geese and one keeps two     
 horses. All, of course, have working  
 dogs - border collies.
