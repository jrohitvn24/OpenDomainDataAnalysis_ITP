 point of the{River Ythan.}It is the   
 point where all the main roads meet:  
{A92(T),}Ellon to Peterhead heading in 
 a north easterly direction;{A92(T)    
 Ellon to Aberdeen heading in a        
 southerly direction;{A920}heading in a
 westerly direction and the{A948       
 heading north. There is a B road,     
{B9005}coming into Ellon from a north  
 westerly direction. There is a large  
 number of roads which are unclassified
 in the surrounding areas and also in  
 the town itself. Instead of all of the
 traffic going into Ellon a new{by-pass
 is planned to stop all the traffic    
 travelling into the town itself. It is
 planned to start by the beginning of  
{1986.}The disused Aberdeen to         
 Fraserburgh railway line which ran    
 through Ellon was closed in{1976.
