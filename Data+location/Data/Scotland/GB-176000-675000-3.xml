		<content> Achahoish Graveyard is reached by     
 going through a gate beside the old   
 and new Ellary bridges, and following 
 a path for about 50 metres.           
 One of the stones in the graveyard is 
 that of Katie McLellan aged 2 who     
 strayed from home on Saturday 16th    
 April 1892. Next day a search party of
 over 100 assembled on the hill. A     
 shepherd found Katie's body lying on a
 grassy green patch 2 miles from her   
 home. A large number of the search    
 party proceeded to the spot where the 
 remains were found and in accordance  
 with an old Highland custom erected a 
 cairn of white stones gathered from   
 the hillside. This can still be seen  
 on Ellary hillside and to visit it and
 read the inscription on it makes a    
 pleasant afternoon's walk.
