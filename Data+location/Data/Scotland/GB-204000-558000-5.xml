		<content> One of the most famous sights in      
 Stranraer is the{North West Castle.   
 It used to be the house of the famous 
 arctic explorer{Rear Admiral Sir John 
{Ross,}and it was built in{1815.}His   
 father Rev.Andrew Ross was minister of
 Inch, which is near Castle Kennedy. He
 joined the navy at the age of nine and
 after fifteen years was made          
 lieutenant. However,it is an arctic   
 explorer that he is best remembered.  
   It was on his second voyage in      
 search of the North-west passage that 
 Ross found the Magnetic North Pole.   
 The difference between Grid North and 
 Magnetic North is 6 degrees on the    
 Stranraer map in 1985.                
   Stranraer has an{old castle}in the  
 town centre which was latterly used as
 a prison. It is being restored at the 
 present time. The{tolbooth}is still in
 use as a museum.                      </content>
