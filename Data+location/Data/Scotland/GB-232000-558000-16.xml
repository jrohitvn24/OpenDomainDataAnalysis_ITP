		<title>16KIRKCOWAN VILLAGE IN 1925</title>
		<content> The{streets}were only dirt and stones 
 and in Summer they became dusty and   
 had to be sprayed by a water-cart.Some
 streets no longer exist and new houses
 have been built in other parts.There  
 were more shops then.Shops which have 
 disappeared include a{tailor's,}a{    
{draper's,}a{blacksmith's,}a{milliner's
 and a{shoe maker's.}The ironmongers   
 sold petrol less than{10p}a gallon but
 there were few cars.{P.C. Robertson}  
 was the policeman and he patrolled    
 behind the houses and if he found     
 anyone stealing apples he gave them a 
 skelp and sent them away.Trees were   
 planted in the village to mark the    
 victory at the battle of Waterloo in{ 
{1815.}The road up to where the{       
{Poorhouse}stood was referred to as the
 Auld(old)Road.Tramps were given       
 somewhere to sleep and something to   
 eat and drink there.                  </content>
