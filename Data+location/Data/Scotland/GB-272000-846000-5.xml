 The land on which Culloden House      
 stands ,was originally owned  by      
 the chief of the Mackintosh           
 clan,Mackintosh of Mackintosh. In     
 1626 the land came into the hands of  
 the Forbes family who commissioned the
 building of Culloden House as their   
 family seat around the middle of the  
 17th century.Culloden House was built 
 in the Adam style.Duncan Forbes was   
 the most famous person in his         
 family.He had been the town lawyer, a 
 MP of Inverness and from being MP of  
 Inverness he became Lord Advocate. In 
 1737 Duncan Forbes became Lord        
 President of the Court which was very
