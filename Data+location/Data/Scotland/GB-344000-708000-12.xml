		<title>12THE VILLAGE NAME</title>
		<content> Our local village is called Peat Inn. 
 Peat Inn got its name from the peat   
 bogs which surrounded the village and 
 the inn which was in the village.     
 The village has not always been       
 called Peat Inn it used to be called  
 Westfield of Radernie.The name was    
 changed when Westfield farm and       
 buildings were knocked down.          
   The old village name is still       
 preserved in the address of the shop  
 which is Westfield cottage.
