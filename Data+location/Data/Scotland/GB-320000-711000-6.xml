		<content>   After lunch we played Hide and seek 
 and Monsters. When I was Monster I    
 caught Debbie and Michelle. In the    
 afternoon we corrected work and had a 
 spelling test. Before we finished Mrs 
 Orr told us the end of the story she  
 was reading to us.                    
   When I got home I watched the       
 television. At teatime I had chips,   
 peas and a small pie and a hot cup of 
 refreshing tea. I went for Margo. We  
 went down for Debbie. We had a great  
 night. There was Margo, Shonagh,      
 Debbie, Sharron and I. At 8.30pm I    
 said "Goodbye" to Shonagh and I set   
 off down the road. I met Miss         
 Macphail, our Headteacher, on my way  
 home. I had a drink of milk and toast 
 for my supper. I got washed and       
 changed into my nightie. I got into   
 bed and hoped tomorrow would be       
 another great day like today.         </content>
