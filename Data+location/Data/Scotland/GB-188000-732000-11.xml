		<content>                                       
 Unemployment is not a major problem in
 Connel.Many retired people live in the
 village.                              
 Connel is a delightful place with     
 beautiful scenery so it is popular    
 with the tourists.As a result many are
 employed in the tourist industry      
 running guest houses,bed and breakfast
 establishments and hotels.            
 At Dunbeg there is a Scottish Marine  
 Biological Association Research       
 Laboratory which employs about 90     
 people.                               
 There are a few farmers and crofters. 
 The remainder of the people are       
 employed in various occupations,such  
 as civil service,engineering,banking, 
 teaching,nursing,etc.Most of these    
 people travel daily to Oban to work.
