		<title>13Transport To Gourdon</title>
		<content> People are dependent on buses, taxis  
 or private cars for transport, the    
 area being no longer served by a      
 railway. An hourly{bus service}between
 Aberdeen and Montrose is operated with
 some buses coming down into the       
 village itself. A bus is also provided
 to take secondary pupils to the Mackie
 Academy in Stonehaven. The Montrose to
 Inverbervie rail link which served    
 Gourdon was opened in the 1860's and  
 operated for just over 100 years,     
 being finally closed down in 1966. The
 former track provides a pleasant      
 coastal pathway to either Inverbervie 
 or Johnshaven. The former line also   
 provides BMX racing bike enthusiasts  
 with a ready made track for this      
 currently popular activity.
