		<content>{Religion }plays an important part in  
 the community through the {Gillespie  
{Centre }and the various churches. At  
 one time {Biggar }had three Protestant
 churches,now as a result of various   
 amalgamations there is only one.The   
 main church of the Community is the   
 old Medieval church of {St Mary's}.   
 Although the other two churches are   
 redundant,one the Moat Park is used as
 a resource centre for the Biggar      
 Museum Trust and the other is used as 
 a Community Centre run by the         
 church.The {Gillespie Centre } has    
 proved very successful and must serve 
 as an inspiration to other communities
 with redundant churches.The Catholic  
 Community have a small chapel,which   
 serves the Biggar area;this is called{
{St Isidore's}.
