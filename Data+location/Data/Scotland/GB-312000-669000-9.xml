		<content>   ONE BLAST PRODUCES ABOUT 1800 TONES 
 OF ROCK. THE SMALLER ROCKS ARE LOADED 
 BY A DIGGER ON TO DUMP TRUCKS AND     
 TAKEN TO THE CRUSHING PLANT.  LARGER  
 ROCKS ARE BROKEN UP BY DROPPING A FOUR
 TON STEEL BALL FROM A HEIGHT OF ABOUT 
 TWENTY METRES. AT THE CRUSHING PLANT  
 THE ROCKS ARE CRUSHED AND THEN GRADED 
 ACCORDING TO SIZE. THE SIZES GO FROM  
 12" DOWN TO DUST.                     
    FOSSILS HAVE ONLY BEEN FOUND IN THE
 TOPSOIL WHICH WAS STRIPPED OFF THE    
 SURFACE AS THE BASALT IS A VOLCANIC   
 ROCK AND NOT GOOD FOR FINDING FOSSILS 
 IN. THE ONLY VALUABLE MINERAL FOUND   
 HERE IS FOOLS GOLD.                   
    THE STONE IS TRANSPORTED IN A FLEET
 OF LORRIES TO EDINBURGH AND LIVINGSTON
 FOR THE MAKING OF ROADS. WHEN THE     
 QUARRY STARTED THE CANAL WAS THE      
 METHOD BY WHICH THE STONE WAS         
 TRANSPORTED AWAY FROM THE QUARRY.     </content>
