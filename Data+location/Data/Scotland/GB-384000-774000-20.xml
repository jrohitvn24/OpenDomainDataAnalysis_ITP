		<content> In school we have two{computers.}The  
 pupils use them to play educational   
 games and experiment with basic       
 programming. There is a computer at   
 Slains Park farm. It is used to record
 animal food rations, milk yields and  
 weight gain. All farm accounts are fed
 into the computer. All the latest     
{agricultural machinery}is used too,   
 such as automatic grain driers,       
 turbo_charged tractors with electronic
 lift controls and combine_harvesters  
 with a rotary threshing concept. The  
 crops are sprayed with special        
 chemicals to eliminate weeds and      
 fungus  and prevent damage. Often     
 helicopters are used to do spraying.  
 In 1984 a M.o.D. station was built in 
 our area. It is an early warning{radar
{station}connected to 26 others and is 
 used to pin_point movement of anything
 in British waters.                    </content>
