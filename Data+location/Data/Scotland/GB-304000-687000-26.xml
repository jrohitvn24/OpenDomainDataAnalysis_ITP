<title>26Dairy Farming</title>
<content>

The farm used to describe Dairy Farming in the 1986 accounts is thought to have been Rosebank Farm, which is situated in Craigluscar Road.  In 1986 this farm was a dairy farm but it is no longer a dairy farm. &lt;br />&lt;br />Easter Clune Farm which is situated west of Rosebank Farm is still a dairy farm and they are building a new milking parlour. Also Carneil Farm in the village of Carnock is also a dairy farm.  However dairy farming in this area has decreased over the past years and a lot of farms are just arable farms (they just grow crops).&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
