		<title>13FARMING - DEER</title>
		<content> March. The snow breaks up, the weak   
 deer die. The stags cast their antlers
 and eat them as they contain valuable 
 minerals. Chemical licks are put out  
 to supplement their diet.             
                                       
 April. Foxes are breeding and are shot
 as they kill far more than they can   
 eat. The 2 terrier dogs work hard at  
 this time of year. Road mending and   
 bridge repairs after the winter ice   
 and snow must be done. There are 6    
 miles of road to be maintained from   
 Dalwhinnie to Ben Alder House. The    
 1,000 acres of trees need their fences
 repaired as well.
