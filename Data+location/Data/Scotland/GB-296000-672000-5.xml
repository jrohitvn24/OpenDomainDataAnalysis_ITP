		<content> Torphichen preceptory was the         
 headquarters of the Knights of St.    
 John in 12th century Scotland. The    
 building is maintained by the ancient 
 monuments division of the Scottish    
 Development Agency and owned by Lord  
 Torphichen. Set around the preceptory 
 is a ring of sanctuary stones, these  
 were positioned at - Westfield,       
 Gormyre, Couston and Craigmailing. Of 
 these only the one at Craigmailing no 
 longer exists. A fair trial was       
 something that was often lacking in   
 medieval justice, however if a        
 convicted criminal came within the    
 ring of stones the knights would      
 protect him until he was given a      
 trial. On the upper floors of the     
 building there is an exhibition on the
 history of the building and the       
 Knights of St.John.
