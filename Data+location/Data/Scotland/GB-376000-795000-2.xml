 The jobs in our block are mainly to   
 do with the land.The most popular job 
 is probably farming,followed by       
 forestry.Farming takes all the better 
 land,and the rough land is used for   
 tree planting.If the land is too      
 marshy for trees it is left as it     
 is.There are six people in our class  
 whose dads are farmers.Other people   
 in the area work as gamekeepers,      
 woodcutters,lorry drivers and         
 teachers.A lot of people have to      
 travel to go to work.Some work in the 
 nearby town of Banchory,six miles     
 away.They work in shops and offices   
 there.Most,however,travel into        
 Aberdeen,about thirteen miles away,and
 many of them work in oil related      
 business, which has become very       
 important in the last ten years.Very  
 few people are unemployed here.       </content>
