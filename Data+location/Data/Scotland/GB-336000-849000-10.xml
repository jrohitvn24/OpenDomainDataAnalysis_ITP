		<title>10Prize_Winning Beasts, Mulben</title>
		<content> A Mulben farm, The Tam, was in the    
 News at the end of May.  Three beasts 
 from it were sold at the Heavy Cattle 
 Auction at the Central Auction Mart in
 Stirling.                             
 The beasts were bullocks {Blackie }and
{Creamy,}and heifer,{Jean. }The two    
 bullocks and the heifer were the      
 heaviest cattle in the United Kingdom.
 The heaviest of the three beasts,     
 Creamy, weighed 1194 kilos.  The      
 lightest, Jean, weighed 1004 kilos.   
 To fatten his cattle, Mr. Addison, the
 farmer fed them a barrowload of       
 turnips each daily, along with corn,  
 cake and bulk fodder.                 
 After winning the prize as heaviest   
 cattle, the beasts were sold.         
 When we went to Mr. Addison's house,  
 he showed us their photographs, their 
 rosettes and the sponsoring Bank of   
 Scotland's blue sash from each beast. </content>
