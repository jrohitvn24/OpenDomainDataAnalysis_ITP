		<content> The Brae school was first opened in   
 1877 with three teachers and          
 33 pupils.The school was a junior     
 secondary until 1970 then it became a 
 Junior High School.In 1976 the Primary
 department moved to a new building.The
 Secondary department moved to the new 
 site in 1981.In 1985 there were 38    
 nursery,138 primary and 265 secondary 
 pupils.The Primary has 6 classes and 8
 teachers.The Secondary has 19         
 full-time and 10 part-time            
 teachers                              
    There is alot of school transport  
 because many of the pupils live       
 outside the Brae area.This means      
 attendance is poor in bad weather.It  
 also affects after school activities. 
 The school is modern and very well    
 equipped.The pupils treat their school
 with care and respect.
