		<title>16A day in the life of.. young</title>
		<content> My name is Heather Greenwood and I am 
 11 years old.I usually get up at      
 8.00am and get ready for school.My    
 school is called Alexandra Parade and 
 is for primary children aged 5 to 12. 
 Lessons begin at 9am and include      
 English, Arithmetic and Art. Sometimes
 we go swimming in Whitehill Pool and  
 once every 3 weeks the local minister 
 Mr Campbell comes and we have a       
 service. I like my school and my      
 favourite subject is Arithmetic.      
 When school finishes at 3.30pm I go   
 home, do any homework I might have and
 then I go out on my bike with my      
 friends. After tea I sometimes go out 
 to play in the court behind my        
 tenement building or perhaps if it is 
 wet I might stay in to watch          
 television. I like Dynasty best.      
 Then after my supper it's off to bed  
 at round about 10pm.                  </content>
