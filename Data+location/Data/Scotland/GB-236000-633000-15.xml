		<title>15HOMES TO RENT,DUNDONALD</title>
		<content>  In Dundonald, as well as very        
 attractive private homes, there are   
 many houses which can be rented from  
 the Local Council or from the Scottish
 Special Housing Association.          
  The Council houses are built on the  
 eastern side of the Main  Street and  
 are mainly semi_detatched villas with 
 a few blocks of terraced houses as    
 well. The houses are built in         
 different sizes to suit large and     
 small families and the average rent is
 about Â£40.80 paid fortnightly.        
  The S.S.H.A. houses were built around
 1970 to provide homes for workers in  
 the new factories built around the    
 village,providing employment locally. 
 Lots of new people moved into the     
 village around that time many of them 
 from Glasgow.These houses are built in
 long terraces, traffic free, at the   
 top end of the village.               </content>
