		<title>07GAIRLOCH BLACKSMITH</title>
		<content>{Gairloch blacksmith}was originally a  
 church until the end of world war II, 
 then it was a joiners and presently a 
 smithy.                               
 Mr Findlater runs the blacksmith      
 helped by his father and three other  
 workers.Mainly his work involves      
 making gates and fences using many    
 different designs,repair work and he  
 occassionally shoes horses.           
 The blacksmith's is a very noisy place
 to work because of the machinery they 
 use and the constant clanging of      
 hammers, moulding metal into shape.   
 The building still retains the stain- 
 glass windows although the belfry has 
 been removed and re-erected in the    
 corner of the garden.Also,the roof has
 been renovated.                       
 Jobs can vary from contract work for  
 firms to simple tasks such as putting 
 a handle on a coal shovel.            </content>
