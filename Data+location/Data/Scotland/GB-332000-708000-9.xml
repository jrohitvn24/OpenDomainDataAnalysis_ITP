		<title>09The River Eden</title>
		<content> The River Eden starts at{Gateside     
 where several springs and streams     
 form its source at the foot of the    
{Lomond hills.}It is fed by a number of
 small burns along its way,and having a
 very level course it is never very    
 low-not even in summer drought.       
 The Eden's course is between 12 and 14
 miles long,and works its way through  
{the plain of the Howe of Fife.}When it
 reaches{Pitlessie}it is 9 miles from  
 the sea.                              
 Many local people{fish}the river      
 during the fishing season. The fish in
 the Eden are plentiful and vary from  
 minnows and sticklebacks to trout and 
 salmon.Each year a permit has to be   
 bought to fish the river and it is a  
 very popular{local pastime.
