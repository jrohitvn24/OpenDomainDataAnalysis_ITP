		<content>   In our school area there are many   
 intresting walks. Much of the area was
 originally farmland, and many         
 landmarks can still be seen today,    
 when out walking.                     
   From the{Steadings Inn,}which was   
 once the steadings of a local farm,   
 you can view the sea above the        
 rooftops of the town.                 
   Walking back along{Dunearn Drive,}we
 pass the site of the old quarry,which 
 now contains the Dunearn Roadhouse.   
   In following the Valley stream,     
 which flows along{Valley Gardens,}and 
 through Wilson Avenue Park, we come to
 the{giant tree}which has stood here   
 since before the houses were built in 
 the 1930's.                           
   The area has several interesting    
 trails to follow, many of which are   
 outlined in our headmaster's{"Local   
{Links"}book.                          </content>
