		<content>{St Combs}is the youngest of the three 
 fisher touns having been founded in   
 the year{1771}to replace{Corsekelly}a 
 mile to the south.Yet in a sense it is
 the oldest centre too, for the remote 
 ancestors of many a{Cairnbulg and     
{Inverallochy fishermen}lie in the kirk
 yard of{St.Combs}around the ruins     
 of its ancient pre_Reformation church.
 It lies in the{Parish of Lonmay}yet   
 today{St.Combs village}now yet by far 
 the largest centre of population in   
 the Parish has{no church.St.Combs}is a
 fishing village that is{south east}of 
{Fraserburgh and north of the Loch of  
{Strathbeg.}Long ago the{Loch of       
{Strathbeg}was part of the{North Sea,  
 it was a natural harbour where ships  
 could anchor in safety.One night a    
 terrific storm blew up and the        
 entrance to the harbour was blocked   
 with sand.                            </content>
