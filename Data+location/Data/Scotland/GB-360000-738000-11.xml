		<title>11FARMING AROUND ARBROATH</title>
		<content>{Farming}in area is mostly livestock   
 and crops.The farmers employ people   
 from Arbroath  and the surrounding    
 district to help around the farms.In  
 the summer the farmers employ people  
 to pick their berries and in the      
 Autumn they get people to their       
 potatoes.Most of the work nowadays is 
 done by machinery so there is not as  
 much{employment}for the local people  
 on the farms as there was in the      
 past.Some of the farms sell their     
 produce to factories and companies far
 away.Some of the farmers  have their  
 own{transport}to save costs.The crops 
 grown are wheat,barley,potatoes,raspb-
 erries,and grass crops for            
 stock.Recently oil rape seed has been 
 grown.This is because E.E.C.          
 regulations have made {trade }in this 
 crop more profitable.
