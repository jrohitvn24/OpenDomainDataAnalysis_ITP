		<title>05NATURE AROUND LIVINGSTON</title>
		<content> Our area has a large amount of        
 greenbelt, farmland, deciduous and    
 coniferous trees. The woodland next to
{Selm Muir Wood}is dark and dense.  It 
 is part of{Lord Morton's}estate.      
 Because of this natural habitat many  
 wild animals can be seen in this      
 area; roe deer, foxes, badgers, wild  
 cats, rabbits and many small rodents. 
 On and near the{Morton Reservoir}many 
 species of ducks and gulls can be     
 seen. Also many kestrels and owls are 
 to be found in this area. The         
 main streams which flow through our   
 area are{Linhouse Water}and{Murieston 
{Water,}both being tributaries of the  
{River Almond.}They are full of life   
 which constantly  change with the     
 seasons. These waters are extremely   
 popular with local children for       
 fishing and other recreational        
 pursuits.                             </content>
