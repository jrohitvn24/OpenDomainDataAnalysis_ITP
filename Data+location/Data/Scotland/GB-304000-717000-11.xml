		<content> A lovely spring morning. I am up at   
 6a.m.,feeding stale bread to a gang of
 local sparrows, and listening to the  
 birds singing their morning songs.    
 My first task is to clean out the     
 fire, take out the ashes , bring in   
 the coal and wood. These mornings are 
 still chilly enough to warrant a fire,
 and its cheery, red glow brings warmth
 to the whole house.                   
 The garden demands attention, hoeing, 
 planting,digging,weeding,the grass to 
 be cut-and there is a lot of this-and 
 this takes up most of my morning.I    
 find time to visit the school library 
 to change my books,and to attend to   
 the Hydro-Electric man who asks to get
 into the village hall to read the     
 meter.After lunch I spend some time   
 scything long grass around my         
 garage,then I take out my bicycle and 
 ride to Dunning to do some shopping.  </content>
