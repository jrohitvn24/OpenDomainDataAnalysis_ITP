{COUNTRY LIFE}All like living here and 
 they enjoy the peace of an isolated   
 area.Most mention the occasional      
 wintry weather but overall it has     
 little effect as people adapt         
 accordingly.All are hopeful about     
 future country life.Most welcome plans
 to build two council houses.          
{ISOLATION}Disadvantages of living far 
 from towns,lack of convenient public  
 transport and lack of prompt emergency
 services are outweighed by the benefit
 of living in quiet countryside with   
 helpful friendly people and also being
 without crime,drugs and vandalism.    
{TOURISTS}Nearly all would welcome more
 tourists who could be attracted by    
 better amenities,including public     
 toilets.                              
{JOBS}Most want more jobs in the area  
 so that young people will stay here.  </content>
