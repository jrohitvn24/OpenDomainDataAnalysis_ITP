 The town of Wick,made a Royal Burgh in
 1589, is divided into two parts by the
 river-Wick and Pulteney.Wick was      
 called Vik ,meaning bay ,by the       
 Vikings.Pulteney was called after Sir 
 William Pulteney who was chairman of  
 the Fishery commission in 1808.       
                                       
 Many farms and villages have names    
 ending in -ster which means homestead 
 or small homes.                       
                                       
 Along the bank of Wick river there are
 two statues.One was erected in memory 
 of James T Calder,who wrote the       
 History of Caithness,which is well    
 read by people today.The other was to 
 the memory of John Alexander,M.D.who  
 was the medical officer in the county 
 in the late 19th century.
