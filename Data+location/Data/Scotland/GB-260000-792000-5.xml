		<title>05Heating the homes in Laggan</title>
		<content> The fast flowing streams of the       
 Monadhliath mountains provide a vast  
 amount of Hydro-Electric power for all
 of Britain and every house in Laggan  
 has electricity.Despite this many     
 people use wood and peat which they   
 harvest themselves.Coal is brought    
 from the Newtonmore merchants 8 miles 
 away.Although a few homes have        
 installed oil-fired central           
 heating.The 1985 price of oil makes   
 this a very expensive form of         
 heating.Bottled propane and butane gas
 is available from the local shop (see 
 trade)and is used for cooking and     
 heating.It would be safe to say that  
 wood and peat smoke can be scented    
 readily around 5o'clock each evening  
 as the stoves are stoked to prepare   
 the home for warmth and the evening   
 meal.
