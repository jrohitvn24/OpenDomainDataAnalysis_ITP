		<title>15Farming - Kennoway</title>
		<content>  Although situated in a fairly rural  
 area, Kennoway does not derive many   
 benefits from the surrounding farms.  
 Very few of the village's population  
 find employment on the farms compared 
 to earlier in the century.            
  Many of the farms themselves have    
 changed in nature over the years,     
 mainly as a result of economic        
 pressure. Where there were once many  
 thriving smallholdings, today there   
 are, in most cases, ruins with the    
 land incorporated into much larger    
 farms.                                
  Most of the farms are{arable         
 producing a mixture of products       
 including{cereals, root crops,        
{legumes, brassicas and soft fruits.   
 There is no dairy farming and only a  
 little stock is kept on a very small  
 number of farms.
