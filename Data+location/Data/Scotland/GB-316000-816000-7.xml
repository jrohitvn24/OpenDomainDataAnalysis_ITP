 In Tomintoul there is a church and a  
 chapel. The former is called          
 Kirkmichael Parish Church and the     
 latter St. Michael's Catholic Chapel. 
 The population is evenly divided      
 between the two faiths. Next to St.   
 Michael's Chapel there is an old      
 convent which is now used as a holiday
 place for nuns and children. The      
 minister of Kirkmichael left to take  
 up another charge in February 1985 and
 will be replaced this summer. In the  
 village there are 3 graveyards, one   
 for the chapel, one for the church and
 a new cemetery for both Protestants   
 and Catholics. The church hall is used
 for Sunday School and as a meeting    
 place for the interdenominational     
 Tomintoul Youth Group.
