 There is a small supermarket with     
 petrol pumps, garage and calor gas    
 supplies.The Youth Hostel is situated 
 at the east end of the causeway and   
 isopen for six months during summer.  
 Onthe Thurso road there is the old    
 school building now a weaving and     
 craft shop and snack bar.             
 When the ride goes out much of the    
 Kyle is uncovered and seals can be    
 seen basking on the sandbanks just    
 north of the causeway.                
 There is one farm in the area, the    
 rest of the land is mainly moorland.
