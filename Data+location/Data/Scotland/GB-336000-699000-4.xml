		<title>04 Childrens Catching Games</title>
		<content>{CHAIN TIG-}One person is'it'.If caught
 you link on their arm and try to catch
 the others.When four are caught they  
 divide into twos until all are caught.
 The first person caught is now 'it'.  
{STICK IN THE MUD -}Play it with seven 
 or more people.One person is 'it'.He  
 has to try to catch all the others.If 
 one is caught they stand still with   
 their legs open as if they were "stuck
 in the mud".They go free if someone   
 crawls through their legs.If they are 
 caught three times they  will be 'it'.
{HUNT-}Two equal teams,one team thinks 
 up a word-each person gets a letter.  
 This team runs away and the others    
 catch them and try to make them give  
 their letter.When everyone is caught  
 they jumble up the letters and try to 
 find the word.
