		<title>17BIOGRAPHY:JOSEPH THOMSON</title>
		<content> Joseph Thomson:explorer was born in   
 1858 in Penpont.Educated in the local 
 school and at Edinburgh University he 
 won prizes for geology,botany and     
 chemistry.                            
  As a member of the Royal Geographical
 Society East Africa Expedition between
 1878 and 1880 he was responsible for  
 finding a practical route to the      
 interior which would connect the great
 chain of central lakes to  the east   
 coast.                                
  His greatest journey of exploration  
 was his expedition to Masai land in   
 Equatorial East Africa. This was the  
 last large expanse of the continent   
 still unmapped.His success in explor- 
 ation  led to fame at the cost of sha-
 ttered health and impaired vitality.  
 He died in 1895 and was brought from  
 Africa for local burial. Thomson's    
 Gazelle &amp; Falls bear his name.        </content>
