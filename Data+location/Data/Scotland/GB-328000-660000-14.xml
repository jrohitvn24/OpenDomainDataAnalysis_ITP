		<content>   Later on I usually watch television 
 programmes such as "The Price is      
 Right" and "The Hunter".              
   After a glass of milk and a biscuit 
 I go to bed around 9.30.              
   I like Carrington because it is     
 quiet and peaceful but it has its     
 disadvantages. It does not have any   
 shops or transport facilites. You     
 would really need a car for transport 
 as Gorebridge, the nearest town is 4  
 miles away. Special transport has to  
 be arranged for Carrington school     
 children and other isolated villages  
 around.Scotland usually has more snow 
 than England and in Winter the small  
 villages in our area often become     
 snowed in.
