   In 1425 the building of{Linlithgow  
{Palace}was begun by James the 1 on the
 site of an earlier manor.In later     
 years the Palace was added to by a    
 number of Kings.The Palace was the    
 birthplace of Mary Queen of Scots and 
 tourists vist it regulary because of  
 this. The Palace was out of use until 
 1633. Later Cromwells army held it    
 from 1650 to 1659.In 1746 the Palace  
 caught fire and was gutted.           
   Today the {Palace}is one of the main
 tourist attractions in the town.Lots  
 of people from all round the world    
 come to visit it.Some members of our  
 class saw the Chinese Prime Minister  
 when he came in June of 1985 to visit 
 the Palace.It is held in trust for the
 nation by the Secretary of State for  
 Scotland and is looked after by the
