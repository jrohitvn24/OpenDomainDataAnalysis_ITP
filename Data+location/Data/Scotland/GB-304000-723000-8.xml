		<title>08PARISH OF TIBBERMORE (1)</title>
		<content> The parish of Tibbermore lies a few   
 miles west of Perth and forms part of 
 the Strath of Earn, 'strath' being a  
 Scots word meaning valley. The Earn   
 valley, together with Strathmore,     
 forms two of the most important       
 agricultural areas in Scotland.       
 We visited a typical farm, Loanleven, 
 and we looked at the farm buildings.  
 The farmhouse was very large and      
 commands a beautiful view over fertile
 fields to the Ochil hills.            
 We were shown the large barn, brick   
 built with a semi-circular corrugated 
 asbestos roof. It measured about one  
 hundred feet by forty feet and housed 
 the two huge combine harvesters,      
 together with hundreds of bales of    
 straw.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
