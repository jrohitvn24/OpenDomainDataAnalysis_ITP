		<title>07Housing, Fearn.</title>
		<content> There is a mixture of house styles in 
 Hill of Fearn-old and modern private  
 houses as well as new areas of coucil 
 houses.Arabella has no council        
 houses,only some recently erected     
 private homes.Most houses are one or  
 two storeys high.Many farms have      
 cottages which used to be for         
 farmworkers, but now they are rented  
 out as there are fewer people on the  
 land.The houses in Muldearg Road, Hill
 of Fearn have recently been renovated.
 Externally they have been painted a   
 grey colour and new flagstones have   
 been laid to replace cracked ones.The 
 windows are now double glazed.New sink
 units have been installed which are   
 brown in colour.There have been       
 structural alterations inside also.The
 street looks much smarter now.
