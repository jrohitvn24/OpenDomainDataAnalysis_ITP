		<title>03CROFTING ON WHALSAY</title>
		<content>  On our island there are over 80      
 crofts but most are quite small.Few   
 people are full-time crofters,few     
 cattle are kept,only a handful of     
 milking cows.In the past 15 years the 
 number of sheep kept has fallen from  
 just under 2000 to under 700.         
  Crofting is obviously not so         
 important to families as once was.    
  Crops grown include hay,corn,potatoes
 and kale-Shetland long stalked cabbage
 ,all grown mostly for animal feed.    
  The northerly situation of our island
 means that spring is late coming,     
 summer is short but because of the    
 long days crops grow quickly.         
  Lambing starts in April,a typical    
 croft keeping about 27 ewes,producing 
 34-40 lambs of which 30 or so are sold
 at the yearly sale held in September. 
 Use is made of the nearby islets for  
 grazing during summer.                </content>
