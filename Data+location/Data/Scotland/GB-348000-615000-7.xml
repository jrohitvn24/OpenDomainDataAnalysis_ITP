		<title>07HAIG MATERNITY HOSPITAL.</title>
		<content> The Haig Maternity Hospital was opened
 in l93l and was popular because of the
 high risks of having babies at home.  
 The nearest hospital before this was  
 in Edinburgh which is 5l miles away.  
 The Haig is still well used today but 
 any difficult births are taken to     
 Edinburgh. We interviewed Matron      
 Crozier and asked her about the       
 running of the Haig. Most babies are  
 born during January, February and     
 March. The quietest months for births 
 are June and July. She told us that   
 there are still slightly more boys    
 born than girls and the most popular  
 names for children used to be Mary and
 John although there are much more     
 unusual names chosen today. The       
 average age for a mother to give birth
 in the Haig is between l8 and 22. The 
 oldest lady to give birth was 46.
