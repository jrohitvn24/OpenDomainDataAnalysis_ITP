		<title>09LIVING IN THE COUNTRY</title>
		<content> All the houses in Inverugie are       
 large,and we have the impression that 
 wealthy people live there.Nearly      
 everyone out there asked us in,gave us
 things to eat and explained to us that
 they had either come for quietness or 
 for their husband's work.The people in
 Inverugie are extremely friendly.When 
 questioned,no one said that they'd    
 rather move back to the town or city  
 because of the noise and traffic.Most 
 of the houses are large and have      
 elegant gardens because,of course,they
 love gardening.All the people,we      
 interviewed thought that the town was 
 more "scary" than the country and they
 had all made the right choice by      
 moving there.Half of them had lived in
 a farm or house in the country for    
 most of their life.
