		<content>    High blocks of flats ,a modern     
 library and shops are built close     
 together here and there are schools   
 and halls where people can meet .     
 Plenty of buses run through this area 
 and we could see a{Barrage Balloon}   
 (which was used during the last war)  
 high up in the sky above us           
 advertising an Open Day at a car      
 market .Lots of streets are called    
 after Scottish Glens .Most of the     
 houses are on one side of the main    
 road while on the other side you can  
 find two huge stores with a garden    
 centre .Here you can buy              
 lots of furniture and put it together 
 yourself .There used to be a farm here
 but it was burned down .There are     
 still some green fields although new  
 houses are being built which will     
 cover them up .
