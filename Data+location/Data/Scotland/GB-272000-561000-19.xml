		<title>19Interview with Mr Coltart</title>
		<content> Mr Coltart has been farming for 40    
 years. He lives alone at Wheatcroft   
 Farm. There are a few cottages about  
 Wheatcroft. Mr Coltart has no workers 
 on the farm. He did have one but not  
 now. If he needs any help he gets a   
 man from one of the cottages. He      
 starts work at 6.30 am and finishes at
 5.30 pm.                              
 He has 20 cows and about 30 calves. He
 has no sheep. He does not milk the    
 cows. He just lets the calves milk    
 them. Over the past 20 to 30 years he 
 said there has not been much change.  
 Two or three years ago he had a bull  
 but he has sold it. Tony Coltart      
 thinks his farm will be the same for  
 another 10 or 20 years.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
