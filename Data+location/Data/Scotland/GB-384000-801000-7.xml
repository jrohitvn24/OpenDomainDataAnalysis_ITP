    The American school has 2 locations
 the primary school in Milltimber and  
 the secondary school in Cults.Both    
 schools were established in 1972 to   
 cater for American children whose     
 families had moved to this area beca- 
 use of the oil boom in the North Sea. 
 For the first 7 years the schools were
 badly run and had an extremely bad    
 reputation.Because of this the school 
 role decreased dramatically.A closure 
 was threatened in 1979 and so the     
 schools were bought by several oil    
 companies.                            
{PRIMARY SCHOOL                        
    Today approximately 165 pupils     
 attend the elementary school,many of  
 whom only stay a few months at a time.
 The average length of attendance is 2 
 years.The age range of the pupils,most
 of whom are American,is 6-11.         </content>
