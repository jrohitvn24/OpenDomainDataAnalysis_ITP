		<title>08THE VILLAGE OF LIFF (CONT)</title>
		<content> The village used to boast of having a 
 Brewery,Bakery,Joinery,Cobblers and   
 Post Office but as so often happens in
 a rural community these facilities    
 have disappeared.                     
  There are no amenities whatsoever in 
 the village and the nearest shopping  
 area is approx.2km away in the village
 of Muirhead.                          
       The population of the village is
 around 300 a large proportion of whom 
 are old age pensioners.               
        There are many magnificent     
 views to be seen in this area         
 especially during winter time.        
         In harmony with the general   
 landscape there are many              
 fields,growing the type of crops that 
 have already been mentioned on        
 previous pages.
