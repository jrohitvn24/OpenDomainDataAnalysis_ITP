		<content>    Usually, we work on maths until    
 break at 10:40 a.m. when we play at   
 skipping.  After break we have        
 assembly with the school chaplain.  We
 work on language until lunch break    
 starts at 12:30 p.m.  Our cook        
 prepares a two course meal for 30     
 pupils and teachers.  After lunch, we 
 play together at rounders until 1:30  
 p.m. when it is time for class work   
 until 3 o'clock.  At 3:10 p.m., we    
 have sewing.  I am making a sampler of
 different stitches.  When school ends 
 at 3:55 p.m., I go home and watch     
 television and check the greenhouse   
 before tea.  During the evening, I    
 take my dog, Smokey, for a  walk.  I  
 watch more television and I usually   
 read before falling asleep.
