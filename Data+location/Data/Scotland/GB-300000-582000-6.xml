		<content>    Barshill is an upland farm of two  
 hundred and sixty six acres and is    
 privately owned by the Marshall       
 family. More than half of the land is 
 rented out to other farmers for       
 grazing. The Marshall's themselves use
 the rest of the land for grazing their
 one hundred and fifty sheep. They also
 have six cows, three collies, two     
 kittens and a cat. The Marshall's have
 farmed Barshill for fifty four years. 
 On their land they have an old Iron   
 Age Fort. On this site, they cannot   
 plough or grow anything apart from    
 grass. At one time, the government    
 paid them for the up keep of the fort 
 but this does not happen any longer.
