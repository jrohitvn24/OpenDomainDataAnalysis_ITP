		<content> Osprey Electronics, founded in  1975  
 is based at Wick Industrial Estate.   
 They make underwater cameras and are  
 the second largest producers in the   
 world.                                
 After the camera is designed the ideas
 are drawn up on paper by draughts men.
 Each camera takes about 30 - 40       
 drawings of all the parts before it is
 ready to build. In all the completed  
 plans take 12 weeks to draw. The next 
 stage is the machine shop where the   
 aluminium camera parts are cut exactly
 by computerised machines. The assembly
 line is where the camera and its      
 electronic parts are put together. The
 finished camera is checked in         
 pressurised water tanks to see it     
 doesn't leak and withstands pressure. 
 They are sold from Aberdeen for use in
 inspecting oilrigs, underwater        
 pipelines, etc.                       </content>
