		<content> This is Tiree's{Domesday Book.}So I   
 will tell you about some of the       
 sports and pastimes we play living in 
 the nineteen eighties.In Tiree every  
 Wednesday around about May            
 East,Central and West play football.  
 Each team plays twice and the team    
 with most point is the champion of the
 island.Hockey is also a popular sport 
 and the girls and women play once a   
 week in the summer.If you have a boat 
 you can go fishing.When the weather is
 good you can also go swimming but     
 sometimes the wind makes the sea too  
 choppy.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
