		<title>11ELPHINSTONE GRAVEYARD</title>
		<content> THE GRAVEYARD NEAR ELPHINSTONE PRIMARY
 SCHOOL IS A LITTLE SPOOKY. THERE IS A 
 SKULL AND CROSSBONES GRAVESTONE THERE.
 THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES MEANS THAT   
 THE PERSON THAT DIED,DIED OF THE      
 PLAGUE. THE GRAVESTONE IS SO OLD WE   
 COULDN'T SEE WHOSE GRAVE IT WAS. IT   
 HAD MOSS AND CREEPY CRAWLIES ON IT.   
 BEYOND THE GRAVEYARD IS A NATURE      
 TRAIL. THERE IS A PATH THAT LEADS DOWN
 TO A LITTLE RIVER . IN THE RIVER THERE
 IS A LOT OF JUNK INCLUDING A          
 DARTBOARD. NO FISH COME DOWN THE      
 RIVER,IT IS PROBABALY CONTAMINATED BUT
 IN THE SUMMER YOU FIND TADPOLES,      
 FROG SPAWN AND FROGS. IN THE WINTER   
 IT GETS DRAINED OUT. IF YOU WALK      
 STRAIGHT ON YOU WILL FIND MANY PLANTS.
 THERE ARE PINE TREES AND BRACKEN AND  
 MARES TAILS.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
