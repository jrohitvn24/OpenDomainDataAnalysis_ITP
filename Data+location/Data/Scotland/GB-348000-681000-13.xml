		<content> The Scottish Fire Training School,    
 which trains all firemen in Scotland, 
 was opened in 1953 by Sir Vivien      
 Henderson. Initial training of a      
 fireman takes 16 weeks after which    
 time he is considered operational.    
 Intake per session is approx. 60,most 
 of whom pass basic training.          
                                       
 The Scottish Development Department   
 Bridging Depot covers 23 acres and has
 been in use since 1955.4 workers are  
 employed to grit blast the rust off   
 bridges before painting them.A bridge 
 can take up to 2 years to repair.It is
 the only bridge depot in Scotland and 
 therefore services a large land area.
