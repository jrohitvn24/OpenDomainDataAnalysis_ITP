		<title>17RELIGION AT SANDHEAD</title>
		<content>   The church in Sandhead is relatively
 modern, having been built in the 1960s
 to serve a growing community in the   
 village. It is the youngest of 3      
 churches which serve the Parish of    
 Stoneykirk in which our block stands. 
 Miss Weir of Balgreggan Estate was    
 very generous in her support for the  
 building of this church. The churches 
 are served by one minister, who lives 
 in a new manse built near the church. 
 He is also the school chaplain and    
 services are held in the school at the
 end of each month with special        
 services in the church at the end of  
 each term. The minister preaches at   
 two of the 3 churches each Sunday,    
 turns being taken to miss a service,  
 and because of the distances involved 
 the minister needs a car. The village 
 also has a Gospel Hall which is used  
 by a sect called Plymouth Bretheren.  </content>
