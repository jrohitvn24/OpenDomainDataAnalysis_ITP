		<content>{Knitwear.}In the area there is a      
 knitwear factory. It produces jumpers 
 and cardigns, casual wear and         
 sportswear. Plain and yoke garments   
 are made, the plain bodies of the yoke
 jumpers are knitted in the factory and
 then given out to people to knit in   
 the yoke by hand in their homes. 85%  
 of the products go to the U.S.A. and  
 the rest goes to countries such as    
 Britain, Germany, France and Spain.   
 The garments are kitted on            
 electric-powered machines. Five people
 work in the factory of whom two live  
 in the area.                          
{Salmon.}Salmon-farming is a growing   
 industry. The young salmon are brought
 in from Scotland or Norway and they   
 are kept in cages in the sea until    
 they are big enough to sell. They must
 be fed three times a day.
