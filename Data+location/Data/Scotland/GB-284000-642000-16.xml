		<content> "Tex" is a local character. He came to
 live in Kirkfieldbank from Glasgow    
 thirty-three years ago when he married
 a local girl. He has done many jobs;  
 postman, registrar, mechanic and at   
 present he drives a taxi, runs a      
 mini-bus service and is the local     
 undertaker, as well as being a justice
 of the peace. He is also the caretaker
 of the church which he cleans and     
 helps to maintain. One of his hobbies 
 is reading local history about which  
 he is very knowledgeable. He recently 
 renewed his pilot's licence and flies 
 small planes with a flying club. His  
 nickname came about when he came back 
 from Texas after the war, supposedly  
 wearing a ten-gallon hat and speaking 
 with an American accent. Although he  
 is now sixty, he has no plans to      
 retire because he enjoys his work so  
 much.                                 </content>
