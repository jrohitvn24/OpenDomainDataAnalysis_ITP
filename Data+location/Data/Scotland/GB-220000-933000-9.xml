		<title>09The Kylesku Bridge</title>
		<content>  In August 1982 the preparations for  
 the building of the Kylesku Bridge    
 started. Portacabins came and with    
 them caravans, offices, lorries,      
 cranes, tractors and many workmen.    
  It took a while for any progress     
 in the building of the Â£2.75m bridge  
 to be seen, but they were constructing
 a pier and supports for the legs, on  
 the North side and the South side     
 simultaneously.                       
  The bridge looked as if it would be  
 made of steel, until they put shutters
 on it and poured concrete over it.The 
 next stage was the construction of the
 centre section_ on the shore of the   
 kyle.When completed it was winched    
 into position and the whole deck      
 tarred.                               
  Once finished the bridge measured in 
 excess of 275m and gave a clearance of
 24m above High Water Mark.            </content>
