		<title>08Religion in Ythanwells</title>
		<content> All the indigenous population belongs 
 to the Church of Scotland, but few are
 regular church goers. The dwindling   
 population and poor attendances made  
 it necessary to amalgamate with Auch- 
 aber and services were reduced to once
 monthly at Ythanwells church,until it 
 was decided 3 years ago to join the   
 Parishes of Ythanwells, Auchaber,     
 Forgue and Inverkeithney and to sell  
 the local church.It was bought by a   
 farmer and is now used as agricultural
 store.The Church bell was bought by   
 the community with funds raised at    
 functions, and is now installed in the
 cemetery.The parish minister comes to 
 school fortnightly for religious in-  
 struction, in which all pupils take   
 part, although the children of in-    
 comers do not belong to the C.of Scot.
 They also learn hymns, prayers and    
 Bible stories.Some go to Sundayschool.</content>
