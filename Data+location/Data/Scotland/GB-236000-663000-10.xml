		<title>10BRIDGE OF WEIR - GAMES 2</title>
		<content> This is how we play a game called{Blue
{Murder.}First of all you need two     
 teams{(A}and{B)}with an equal number  
 of players.Then toss a coin to see    
 which team will chase first{(A).      
 Meanwhile the team to be chased{(B)   
 choose any word according to the      
 number of people in the team.For      
 example a team with{6}members needs to
 find a word with{6}letters and each   
 team member takes a letter.Boundaries 
 of the game must be discussed.Team{B  
 then scatter and team{A}after counting
 to twenty chase them. As each member  
 of team{B}is caught they are persuaded
 to tell their letter to team{A.}The   
 correct letter must be revealed so as 
 not to spoil the game.Once team{A}get 
 all of the letters they can rearrange 
 them to discover the word.The teams   
 then change over and the game begins  
 again.                                </content>
