		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF BLOCK</title>
		<content>   This area consists of a river       
 valley, that of the river South Esk,  
 with hills rising to 500-600 metres   
 above sea level on either side. The   
 part of the valley which runs through 
 the block lies in a NW-NE direction.  
   The area is sparsely populated with 
 only 2O permanent residents and 3     
 seasonal workers contained in 9       
 households.                           
   The only road running through the   
 block is the B955. This is not a      
 through road for vehicles.            
   The main buildings apart from       
 dwelling houses are a primary school, 
 a hall, a church and a hotel.         
   The land is mainly devoted to sheep 
 farming, forestry and game such as    
 grouse, pheasants, partridges and red 
 and roe deer.
