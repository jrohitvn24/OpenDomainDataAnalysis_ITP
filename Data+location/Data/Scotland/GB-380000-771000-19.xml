 We asked 164 families represented in  
 the school to fill in a questionnaire.
 From the 118 returned we found that 14
 families lived on farms, 47 in older  
 houses, 57 in new houses. 52 families 
 have come to stay here within the last
 5 years, a further 34 within the last 
 10 years.                             
 While some residents had moved from   
 S.Africa, Zambia, Middle East and     
 U.S.A., 23 families had previously    
 resided in England, the other         
 newcomers coming from all parts of    
 Scotland.                             
 At least 32 fathers were involved in  
 oil related jobs, 22 were self        
 employed while only 1 was unemployed. 
 10 mothers were employed full time    
 while 43 had part time jobs working   
 locally.                              
                                       </content>
