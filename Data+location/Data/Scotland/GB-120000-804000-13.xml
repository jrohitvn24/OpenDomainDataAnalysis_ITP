 Most of the houses are traditional one
 storey croft houses with 2/3          
 downstairs rooms and bedrooms/store in
 the roof. The schoolhouse is similarly
 constructed but slightly larger. There
 are 2 modern bungalows built in 1972  
 and 1977.                             
 The 2 large houses on the island are  
 Canna House, built in 1858, which has 
 always been the Laird's house and in  
 which Dr and Mrs Campbell still live  
 and Tigh Ard which was built in 1905  
 for the then Laird's son. Tigh Ard is 
 used by the National Trust for        
 Scotland for Work parties and other   
 visitors to the island and can        
 accomodate 10 people.
