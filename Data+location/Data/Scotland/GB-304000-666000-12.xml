<title>12The Town Centre - 2011</title>

<content>As an update to the 1986 article, the 4 "Big Stores" mentioned: Woolco, Presto, Fine Fare and John Menzies are all but distant memories.   The Centre continues to be fully undercover but was heavily expanded in the late 1990s and again in 2008.   The 3 main stores now are the ASDA Wal*Mart Supercentre, Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams.   The centre continues to be a major employer in the town and has been complimented by further retail developments such as the Livingston Designer Outlet, as well as a number of retail parks with large stores including Curry's and PC World, JJB Sports, REID Furniture, PoundStretcher, Matalan, B&amp;Q, Sainsbury's and Toys "R" Us.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Bus Station was demolished in the late 1990s and buses now run on a road between The Centre and the Livingston Designer Outlet.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Livingston Development Corporation was wound up in 1996 and the area is now managed by West Lothian&lt;br />
