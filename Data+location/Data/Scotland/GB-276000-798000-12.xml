		<title>12FARMING in SPEY VALLEY (2)</title>
		<content> Farmers here either own their land or 
 lease it, the lease usually passing   
 from father to son. Following a sound 
 practical upbringing many sons now    
 attend college or university to study 
 agriculture and thus add academic     
 training to natural interest. As the  
 nearest vet is based some thirty miles
 away these farmers, having benefited  
 from a broad education, can cope with 
 many animal malidies on their own.    
                                       
 Stock sales are held in nearby        
 Kingussie on four occasions every     
 autumn by the Aberdeen and Northern   
 Mart. These sales are well attended   
 and are considered a social highlight 
 for farmers and shepherds, a rare     
 chance to catch up with friends, some 
 of whom live in quite isolated parts  
 of the valley.
