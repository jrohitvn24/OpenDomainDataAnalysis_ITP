		<content> Arbroath Academy is a six-year compre-
 hensive school. Our roll at the       
 beginning  of session 1984-85 was 950 
 pupils and 70 members of staff.       
  As a comprehensive school, we cater  
 for pupils of very different abilities
 from a wide range of background. At   
 one extreme we have a group of mildly 
 mentally handicapped children who     
 belong to our Special Education Unit. 
 At the other end of the ability range 
 we have pupils preparing for Higher   
 Education in Colleges and Universiti  
     We try to encourage pupils to     
 develop a wide range of interests     
 through extra-curricular activities.  
   We try to prepare them for the world
 they will enter when they leave       
 school.All this we try to do within   
 a framework which will allow pupils to
 live and work happily together.
