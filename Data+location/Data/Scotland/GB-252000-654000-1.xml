		<title>01GAZETTEER OF NEWTON MEARNS</title>
		<content>      Newton Mearns is a pleasant      
 residential area on the south side of 
 Glasgow surrounded by farmland. It is 
 on the edge of Fenwick moor and is    
 built on slightly hilly ground which  
 rises to the west. The property in the
 area is largely of a very good quality
 and owner-occupied. It is a           
 well-established residential area with
 pockets of fairly new housing         
 developments, built around two main   
 roads running through the area. There 
 are many trees growing in this suburb 
 which give it a very nice appearance  
 in the summer. The air in this part of
 the country is very clean and fresh   
 having blown in from the Atlantic.    
 There is a significant minority of    
 Jewish families in the local          
 population who have lived here for    
 many years.                           
                                       </content>
