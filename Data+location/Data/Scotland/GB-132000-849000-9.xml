		<title>09EDINBANE - CALUM HAMISH</title>
		<content> Everyone knows my Granda, Calum Hamish
 Macfarlane. He has lived most of his  
 life in the croft house his father    
 built. My Grandfather was a           
 stone-mason. Fifty years ago he helped
 to build our school. His last job was 
 building an entrance gateway for the  
 Lodge Hotel. During the Depression in 
 the 1930s Granda went to London to    
 Work. That was went he wrote his song 
 about Edinabme. Here is part of the   
 fourth verse:- "Is fhada bho'n aite mi
 's an d'fhuair mi m'arach og Is bho'n 
 a Ghaidhlig mi A bardachd is a ceol"  
 "I am far from the place where I was  
 brought up. I am far from the Gaelic  
 tongue the poetry and the music.      
 Granda has written other songs as     
 well. he also sings and plays the     
 bagpipes.
