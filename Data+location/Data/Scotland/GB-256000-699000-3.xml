		<title>03PORT OF MENTEITH CHURCH</title>
		<content> We have visited the grave of Steven   
 Veitch,the first headmaster of our    
 school who died in 1883.              
  From the Reformation until 1689 the  
 church was Episcopalian.This must have
 been a troublesome time probably even 
 more dangerous to this individual than
 life today with its threat of nuclear 
 war.Rev.J.D.McQueen,who was minister  
 from 1915 to 1956 found 2 pewter      
 Communion Cups inscribed "Port Kirk"  
 in the manse garden. It is thought    
 that they may have been buried for    
 safety during the troubles of the     
 Reformation.There are also two silver 
 cups dated 1765 and inscribed "By the 
 Minister and Kirk Session of Port of  
 Menteith for the use of the Said      
 Parish 4th June 1765."                
  The Church is now linked with        
 Aberfoyle Parish Church and shares the
 services of the Minister, Dr. Orr.    </content>
