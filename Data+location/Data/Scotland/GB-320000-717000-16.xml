		<content>    Down by the River Tay there are big
 boats and little boats. Some are      
 fishing boats. Big boats go up and    
 down the{River Tay}nearly every day.  
 They come from all over United Kingdom
 taking goods to and from the harbour  
 at{Perth}about 10 miles upstream.     
    Every summer{salmon}come up the Tay
 to spawn. Some of the men from        
 Newburgh work at the salmon fishing.  
 In the middle of the River Tay there  
 is a big island. Nearly every year    
 People take cows across to it to      
 graze in a boat called the Iron Duke. 
 There is a small island called        
 Kirwhaup.                             
    The River Tay is Scotland's longest
 river. When the tide is out there are 
 many mudbanks which the boats have to 
 avoid. The banks of the river have    
 been built up to stop the fields from 
 flooding during high tides.           </content>
