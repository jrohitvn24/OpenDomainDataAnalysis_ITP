		<title>05EMPLOYMENT IN TARBERT,HARRIS</title>
		<content> Compared to the rest of the country   
 the rate of employment is quite high. 
 Over 10% of people are self-employed  
 e.g weaving,pottery,crofting.Although 
 a lot of people are crofters,they     
 usually have another job and have     
 crofting as a hobby.A lot of people   
 are employed in roadworks,public      
 services,shops,working in the hotel   
 and garage services.Many women are    
 also employed in Harris House or      
 looking after the elderly.Although    
 there isn't much fishing as an        
 industry here,some people work on the 
 Hebridies,as  cooks,engineers etc.    
 Tourism boosts employment because     
 hotels might be busier,more bus-      
 drivers might be needed .Many people  
 are employed seasonally because of    
 tourism e.g. working on the boat ,more
 bus-drivers and shop assistants in the
 summer.                               </content>
