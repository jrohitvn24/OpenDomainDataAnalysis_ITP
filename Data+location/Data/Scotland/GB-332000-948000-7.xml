		<content> Wick radio station,taken over by the  
 Post Office in 1922,is very important 
 because it covers an area extending to
 300 miles east of Wick.The annual     
 running cost is about half a million  
 pounds.                               
 In the last 20 years,the radio station
 has changed considerably.It used to   
 have most of its calls from fishing   
 boats but now they come from oil rigs 
 in the North Sea.Many messages come   
 through in foreign languages.         
 There are six masts,some receivers and
 some transmitters.Some of the smaller 
 receivers are being replaced by a     
 larger one.The radio station also has 
 a telex system,where messages are     
 printed out instead of being spoken.  
 One of the machines they have is a    
 back up generator,which is used in    
 winter,when there is a power cut.
