		<content> During World War Two Easter Ross had  
 airfields from Evanton to Fearn.      
 As well as having operationl anti-sub 
 units it ws also a traning area for   
 air gunners. The noise of planes using
 the Tain bombing range is still very  
 much of a nuisance.  The remains of   
 buildings and runways are still       
 stretching from Fearn aerodrome       
 through Loans of Tullich to           
 Ashfield.Fearn drome still has the    
 occasional light plane land with      
 civilian passengers and it is becoming
 important as an industrial site.      
     The flight path of the bombers    
 using the Tain range overflys part of 
 our block. This range has been in use 
 since 1934
