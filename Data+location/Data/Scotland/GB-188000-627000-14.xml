		<title>14Arran &amp; Shiskine Transport</title>
		<content>{Boat}We depend on the car ferry, MV   
 Isle of Arran for many things, such as
 food, drink, cars, machinery etc.It is
 our most important form of transport  
 as it is our{only link with the main- 
{land.                                 
{Bus} The bus timetable is very much   
 linked to the ferry timetable. When   
 the boat is late in arriving it can   
 greatly upset the bus times. Far fewer
 buses run in the winter than in the   
 summer, and only one on Sundays. Buses
 run children from all round the       
 island, to and from the High School in
 Lamlash.                              
{Car} Most people on Arran have cars.  
 People need cars to get to the shops, 
 go to the mainland for supplies, or   
 just to get around-they are{essential!
{Bike}Lots of people have bikes such as
 BMX bikes, racers, rally-type, and all
 sorts of others.                      </content>
