		<content> There is one Police Officer whose     
 territorial duty extends from         
 Carsphairn,12Kms.N. of New Galloway to
 Mossdale,5Kms.S. Community policing is
 the key word as, very rarely,is the   
 law broken.Our Policeman checks the   
 bikes and prepares the children for   
 their cycling test given by the       
 Stranraer Transport Police. Talks are,
 also, given on road safety and not to 
 talk to strangers(this is a difficult 
 concept to understand as the village  
 is so open and friendly).If an arrest 
 is made, the person is, generally,    
 transferred to Castle Douglas Police  
 Station. There is a Sheriff Court at  
 Kirkcudbright and at Dumfries for     
 lesser matters but serious crimes are 
 dealt with at Dumfries High Court.    
 There is, also, a prison in Dumfries, 
 for Young Offenders.
