		<content> You need three or more players usually
 girls and a long rope.  Two people    
 turn it.  The other player jumps in   
 and as soon as the rope comes near    
 their feet they jump over it and carry
 on like that.  As you turn the rope   
 say a rhyme like this:                
                                       
                                       
   " Fudge, Fudge tell the judge       
   Susie's gonna have a baby.          
   How many doctors will she need?"    
                                       
                                       
 At the end of the rhyme the two       
 people turning the rope turn it as    
 fast as they can.  The person tries to
 jump it and counts out the number     
 until she is caught out.  The person  
 with the highest score is the winner.
