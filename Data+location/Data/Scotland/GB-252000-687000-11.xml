		<title>11FARMING IN THE BALFRON AREA</title>
		<content>    The farms in the area are all{mixed
{livestock farms,}with two specialising
 in dairy farming and one in the       
 production of pigs. The average size  
 of farm is approximately 100 hectares.
   {Crops}are grown mainly to feed the 
 livestock i.e. the cattle and sheep on
 each farm. The main cereal crop in the
 district is barley and most of the    
 area is in permanent grassland used   
 for pasture or cut for silage or hay. 
 Probably on account of the high       
 rainfall, most farmers produce silage 
 rather than hay.                      
    Over the past 20 years, the labour 
 force on farms has been reduced, and  
 much of the work e.g. lime-spreading, 
 hedge-cutting, harvesting and sheep-  
 shearing is now done by contractors. A
 large number of{trees}is in evidence  
 on the farmland in the area and this  
 provides work for the local sawmill.  </content>
