 Whist Drives.{Whist Drives}are held in
 the village sometimes. People sit at  
 tables for four, playing with a       
 partner at a card game called Whist.  
 The two people with most points move  
 on to the next table. The winner is   
 the person with the highest score.    
 Sometimes in Springfield we have {    
{Coffee Mornings}for charity. To enter 
 you pay 50p for adults, 25p for       
 children. You  can buy coffee and
