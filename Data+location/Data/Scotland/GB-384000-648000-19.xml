		<content> I LIKE WHITSOME BECAUSE IT IS A NICE  
 LITTLE VILAGE AND NOT TOO OVER -      
 CROWDED. ONE THING IS THAT IF THE     
 SCHOOL CLOSED DOWN IT WOULD LOSE ITS  
 ATMOSPHERE AND PEOPLE WOULDN'T MOVE   
 HERE BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NO SCHOOL 
 TO GO TO. I LIKE LIVING IN WHITSOME   
 BECAUSE I USED TO LIVE IN THE TOWN AND
 I HAVE NOTICED A GREAT DEAL OF        
 DIFFERENCE AND WHITSOME IS SO QUIET   
 COMPARED WITH THE NOISY TOWN. IT WOULD
 BE BETTER AS WELL IF YOUNGER COUPLES  
 WITH CHILDREN MOVED IN SO THEN THE    
 SCHOOL MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF  
 STAYING OPEN.
