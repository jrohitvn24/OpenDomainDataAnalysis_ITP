		<title>17Public Attitudes to Housing</title>
		<content>   Most people interviewed were pleased
 with the condition of their housing,  
 of which most were council houses, but
 thought that rent and rates were far  
 too high. Some people did complain    
 about the length of time it took for  
 repairs to be done. There was a great 
 difference in opinion about leisure   
 facilities. Some were happy, others   
 were not (especially concerning facil-
 ities for youth). The most popular of 
 these were Church groups and garden-  
 ing. Sport is very popular with the   
 youth of this area. Attitudes towards 
 the neighbourhood differed according  
 to the area you were in. Most people  
 were satisfied, but others strongly   
 disliked the area in which they lived.
 People passing through seemed to give 
 the area a lot of trouble, although   
 the people who lived there were very  
 nice.                                 </content>
