 meets in Langside Primary School in   
 Tantallon Road every Friday night at 7
 o'clock. We start our activities with 
 a company inspection. The company     
 consists of 4 squads of privates,  one
 captain, two lieutenents and one      
 warrent officer about thirty in all.  
 After this we have twenty minutes of  
 physical training. This is followed by
 one hour of badge work which includes 
 such things as drill,fire prevention  
 and first aid. The evening ends with a
 period of games. The Boys' Brigade    
 also meets on a Sunday morning for    
 Bible class. About one third of the   
 boys in the company play musical      
 instruments.
