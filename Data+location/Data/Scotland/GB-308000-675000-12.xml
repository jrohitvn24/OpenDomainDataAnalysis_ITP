		<title>12HOUSING IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content> The typical house in this area is a   
 stone-built cottage with a slated     
 roof,dating mainly from late 19th     
 Century and early 20th Century.Most of
 these were built to house farm        
 workers(and some for those who worked 
 in the now-defunct shale-mining       
 industry),but most are now owned by   
 people who work outside the area.     
   Newton village has,in addition to   
 the above type of housing,a'scheme'of 
 houses built,in the 1930's by the     
 local authority.The small section of  
 Queensferry which abuts this area     
 contains private housing of the       
 timber-frame variety built within the 
 last six or eight years.
