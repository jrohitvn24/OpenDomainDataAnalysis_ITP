		<title>06MURIESTON TRAIL, LIVINGSTON</title>
		<content>{Murieston Trail}is a walkway and      
 bridle path for the use of the        
{Livingston}public. The nature walk    
 contains landscaped greenways,        
 woodlands and streams and provides a  
 habitat for a variety of animals and  
 birds. On the trail is{Nether         
{Williamson,}a Georgian farmhouse which
 dates back to the 1600's. It was the  
 home of{Lizzie Brice,}the last witch  
 to be burned at the stake, in this    
 area. On our outing we also passed    
{Skivo Farm,}which is an eighteenth    
 century farmhouse. Part of this farm  
 is now used as kennels. Two Skivo dogs
 followed us as far as the Murieston   
 battery farm. We were also chased by  
 geese from{Wester Murieston Farm.}    
 Alongside the path we found pieces of 
 old crockery and bottles in what we   
 called the 'bottle field'. We followed
 the arrows on the trail to get home.  </content>
