		<title>19KIRKCALDY HARBOUR</title>
		<content> Kirkcaldy harbour was owned by the    
 town council until 1968. The dock in  
 its present form was built in 1909.   
 Mr. Bayliss is the harbour master at  
 Kirkcaldy, Methil and Burntisland     
 harbours. The dock is 280 feet long   
 and 18 feet deep. The harbour belongs 
 to the Forth Ports Authority. The dock
 holds between five and six ships.     
 About 400 ships used to dock there    
 annually. Now the number is between 70
 and 100.                              
 The imports are wheat and barley for  
 Hutchison's flour mill. Malt is made  
 from the barley and is sent to the    
 Orkneys. Scrap metal is exported to   
 Spain and other countries.            
 The weighbridge can take a weight of  
 50 tonnes.                            
 The harbour business is declining     
 because of improved road transport and
 fewer ships being available.          </content>
