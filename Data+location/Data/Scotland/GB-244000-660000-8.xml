		<content> Moredun Convent is now a private      
 nursing home. We asked Anna MacNab,   
 the matron, a number of questions.    
 There used to be apple trees in the   
 garden, but these were removed        
 recently to make way for new houses.  
 Thirty six people are employed in the 
 home, many only part time, and there  
 are 26 old people there at the moment.
 The nurses have a limited social life 
 and not much leisure time. They do    
 have hobbies and Anna's are watching  
 T.V. and knitting.                    
 There are 34 rooms in the convent     
 which vary in size, some singles, some
 doubles.                              
 Parts of the grounds are protected by 
 the council because the trees are very
 old and have to be conserved. Only the
 younger ones are cut down.            
                                       
                                       </content>
