		<title>17ATTITUDES STRACATHRO</title>
		<content>    My name is Samir Ranjan. I am 9    
 years old and I live at Stracathro    
 Hospital.My dad is a Senior House     
 Officer. My sister and I go to        
 Stracathro School.                    
    I used to live in India and there I
 went to Agie Mission school.I liked   
 that school.We lived near Patna and   
 had an uncle near Bombay. Then my dad 
 wrote from England that we had to go  
 from India just when my exams had     
 started.In England we had many        
 difficulties because my mum could not 
 speak English but we got through.     
    I have been in Durham, South       
 Shields and now Stracathro. My mum    
 thinks this is a quiet place. I like  
 it here.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
