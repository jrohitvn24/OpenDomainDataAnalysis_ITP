		<title>10PRONY HILL FARM: SPRING</title>
		<content> Nowadays ultranonic scanning can find 
 out how many lambs each sheep is carr-
 ying.Those with twins or triplets are 
 separated out and fed more concentrat-
 es.From mid Feb the ewes are fed high 
 protein food to help form the lambs.In
 early Mar sheep are dosed for worms   
 and vaccinated against the common dis-
 eases.In late Mar the ewes are brought
 to low ground so they can be looked   
 after.The first lambs are born in ear-
 ly Apr and the last about 5 weeks     
 later.At this time the farmer and his 
 family work very long days.When a lamb
 is born it is take with its mother to 
 the turnip field.Weak lambs are kept  
 indoors until they are strong enough  
 to go out.If the lambs get chilled    
 they are put in a lamb warmer-a heated
 box-and fed by a stomach tube.Soon    
 after the lambs tails are docked and  
 they are given 'keel marks'.          </content>
