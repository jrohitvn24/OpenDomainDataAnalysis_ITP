		<content> THIS IS AN AREA OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. 
 THIS IS DUE MAINLY TO A RELIANCE ON   
 'HEAVY' INDUSTRIES,SUCH AS            
 SHIPBUILDING,WHICH HAVE DECLINED IN   
 RECENT YEARS. PEOPLE IN THE AREA DO A 
 VARIETY OF JOBS. A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF
 THOSE EMPLOYED WORK IN THE ELECTRONICS
 INDUSTRY AND RELATED JOBS. THE BIGGEST
 EMPLOYER IN THIS FIELD IS IBM,WHICH   
 HAS BEEN IN GREENOCK FOR 30 YEARS.    
 THE NUMBERS EMPLOYED IN SHIPBUILDING  
 AND HEAVY ENGINEERING IS RAPIDLY      
 DECREASING. JOB PROSPECTS FOR SCHOOL  
 LEAVERS ARE BLEAK. A YOUTH TRAINING   
 SCHEME HAS BEEN SET UP BY THE         
 GOVERNMENT TO TRAIN YOUNG PEOPLE FOR  
 SPECIFIC JOBS.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
