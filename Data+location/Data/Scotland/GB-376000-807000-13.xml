		<content>{ Mechanisation}of Estate operations   
 has had a major effect on the number  
 of people employed and more work is   
 being done with the aid of machines by
 far fewer people.                     
 The Estate grounds,which were         
 originally very private,are now used  
 much more by local organisations such 
 as cricket,football and pony clubs.   
 Scouts and guides have their camps in 
 the grounds and{Dunecht House gardens}
 are opened for charity twice every    
 year.                                 
 These are the main changes noted on   
 the Estate by{Lord Cowdray. }
