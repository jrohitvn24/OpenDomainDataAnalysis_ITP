		<content>   At national level this area is      
 included in the{Angus East  }         
 constituency which is at present      
 represented in Parliament by Mr.      
 Peter Fraser.  As well as being a     
 Conservative M.P., Mr. Fraser is      
{Solicitor General for Scotland.} At   
 local level the area is represented on
 Tayside Regional Council by Mrs. Jane 
 Hendry, and on Dundee District Council
 by Mr. Alan Grewar.                   
   Though the{Community Council}has no 
 powers of government, it plays an     
 important role in conveying the needs 
 and opinions of local people to the   
 Regional and District Councillors.  A 
 survey conducted by the pupils showed 
 that many people wished the Community 
 Council to have more power.
