		<title>09Music in the John Neilson</title>
		<content>   Staff in the{John Neilson High      
{School}were interviewed about music.  
  {Pop},{rock}and{folk music}are the   
 most favourite. Most of the staff like
 classical music; only one or two      
 dislike it.{Handel (the younger)}and  
{Bach}are the favourite composers.Most 
 of them listen to music on a record   
 player or tape recorder. One of our   
 teachers said he liked the music he   
 played himself.Only one of our        
 teachers would join a pop group.      
  {Miss Mackie}, music teacher, said   
{she}liked to play old and modern music
 to her pupils and that the music      
 taught in schools has hardly changed  
 over the years.                       
  {Electronic music}is used more in    
 music lessons but recorders, melodicas
 and glockenspiels are still in use.
