		<title>18A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>  I get up at 7am every morning and    
 then have my breakfast and watch      
 TV.When I am ready , my friends       
 run me to school for nine o'clock.My  
 teacher is  Mrs Calder and there are  
 only 8 in the whole school. At 10.30  
 we have our milk and then go out to   
 play .When we come in we do maths     
 and watch  "Good Health" on TV.At     
 12.00 we stop for lunch.I have a      
 school lunch but some people have a   
 packed lunch.Outside we play" Kick the
 Can" or"Rounders" until afternoon     
 school starts.Soon it is time to go   
 home.Mum comes in the car to pick me  
 and my friends up. Children's         
 television  is on and I watch it till 
 my dad comes home from work to tea.I  
 get ready for the Junior Boy's Brigade
 I like going to it because we play    
 games and we have an inspection before
 going home.                           </content>
