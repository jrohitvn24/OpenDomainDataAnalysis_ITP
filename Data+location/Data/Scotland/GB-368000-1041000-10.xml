		<title>10THE SANDAY KNITTING ASSOC.</title>
		<content> The{Sanday Knitting Association}is a  
 co-operative whose members knit       
 special woollen goods which are then  
 exported to many corners of the world.
 Before being packed, all goods are    
 inspected to ensure that they are the 
 proper size, neatly knitted and that  
 the colours are correct and in the    
 proper place.                         
                                       
 The manageress in charge is{Mrs.      
{Elspeth Sinclair.}She takes orders and
 opens{The Wool Hall}where inspections 
 take place and where visitors and     
 local people can view the goods every 
 other Wednesday night. The Wool Hall  
 is situated in{Lady Village,}and there
 are over 100 people who knit for the  
 association - not only in Sanday - but
 also in other parts of Orkney and even
 the mainland of Scotland.
