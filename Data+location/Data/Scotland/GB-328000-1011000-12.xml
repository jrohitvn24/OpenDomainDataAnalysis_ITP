		<content>    33% of our area is taken up with   
 lakes or, as they are called 'lochs'. 
 The two lochs in this area are a. the 
 Stenness Loch and b. the Harray Loch. 
 The Stenness Loch is an arm of the sea
 and is salt water. It is connected to 
 the Harray Loch through a small       
 channel but the Harray Loch is a fresh
 water loch. At one time the Stenness  
 Loch was the most popular fishing     
 loch. Sea trout and the occasional    
 salmon were caught there. Today the   
 best fishing loch is the Harray Loch  
 where brown trout are caught. The     
 Harray Loch is one of the best trout  
 fishing lochs in the whole of Britain.
 Sometimes very large trout are caught,
 the biggest one weighing 7.5          
 kilograms.Flies and spinners are used 
 to catch the trout. The Standing      
 Stones and Merkister Hotels cater     
 specially for angling holidays.       </content>
