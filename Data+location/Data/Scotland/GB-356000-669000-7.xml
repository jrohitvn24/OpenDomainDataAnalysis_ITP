		<content> Apart from fish in pools and indoor   
 tanks, there are rabbits in hutches,  
 she goats with kids, hens &amp; a large   
 cock, which is frequently gathered in 
 the arms of a tiny girl &amp; carried     
 about, to its evident delight There   
 are a few resident cats and even      
 moribund baby hedgehogs have been     
 rescued and survived to hibernate     
 successfully. Dogs number 18, mostly  
 pedigreed of several breeds. Two      
 trusted unemployed girls benefit      
 from the fees they earn for feeding   
 and exercising two dogs whose owners  
 are at work. Conversely, a city dog   
 weekends here.  An aged arthritic     
 dog is wheeled in its carriage to     
 the haugh for gentle exercise. Pets   
 lives are paradisal in Garvald..
