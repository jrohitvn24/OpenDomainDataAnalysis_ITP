		<title>12CHURCH ATTENDANCE</title>
		<content> There are 6 churches in Eyemouth, the 
 Parish Church,St Andrews Catholic     
 Church,Methodist Church, E.U. Church, 
 Episcopal Church and Baptist Church.  
 The Parish Church, with about 500     
 members,has the largest congregation  
 over 50% of whom attend regularly.The 
 Episcopal Church,with 30 members is   
 the smallest but has,along with the   
 Baptist Church,the highest percentage 
 of regular attenders.All churches have
 a Sunday School but although these are
 fairly well attended by members,in    
 fact,only about 10% of local children 
 attend Sunday School,and 70% of       
 children are only in church during    
 school services at Christmas and      
 Easter.Apart from weekly              
 collections,money is raised by holding
 sales of work,afternoon teas,coffee   
 mornings and Gift Day collections.
