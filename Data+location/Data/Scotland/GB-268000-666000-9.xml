		<content>  The Townhead area, and even more the 
 Easterhouse area, have high           
 unemployment (25 - 35% in 1985). In   
 the case of Coatbridge, the decline of
 its heavy industries of coal and      
 iron-working was not replaced by      
 sufficient numbers of alternative jobs
 in light industry. But unemployment is
 particularly a youth problem, and     
 figures show that a generation of     
 young people is growing up without    
 ever having experienced full-time     
 work. A couple of YOP schemes, or a   
 year on the Youth Training Scheme, are
 for many followed by years on the     
 dole. They then become trapped in a   
 vicious circle, in that they cannot   
 get a job without experience, and they
 cannot get experience without a job.
