		<title>03THE PICTS IN STRATHNAIRN</title>
		<content>  Long long ago when our strath was    
 nearly all covered in trees people    
 known as Picts thought of places to   
 build forts on the top of big hills   
 with steep cliffs on nearly all of the
 sides.Here they felt safe from        
 their enemies.                        
  We have been to see a hill fort in   
 square 02660831.It is on top of a     
 very,very,very steep hill.I like hill 
 climbing so I was good at climbing up 
 to that hill fort but I am glad I     
 was not fighting my way up.           
  All the large boulders standing about
 showed us where the walls were.The    
 defenders would have had an excellent 
 view of their enemy coming up         
 Strathnairn.The look out could warn   
 those who lived in the farms around   
 the fort.                             
  They had a well near the hill fort   
 so could stay until it was safe.      </content>
