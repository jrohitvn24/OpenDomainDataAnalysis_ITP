  Thanks go to the classes who gave up 
 their own computer time for us.       
  Special thanks go to our teacher's   
 daughter, Morag Winton, for helping us
 with the photographs and for taking us
 to interview people. Many of them said
 how nice it was to see pleasant,polite
 youngsters and seemed surprised. That 
 could be because they only hear about 
 young troublemakers. What a pity.     </content>
