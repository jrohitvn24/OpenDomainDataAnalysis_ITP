 and I am ready to have breakfast at   
 8.00am.I wear my school uniform which 
 consists of a grey skirt,a white      
 shirt,a black and white tie and a grey
 cardigan.At 8.30am I leave for school 
 which starts at 9.00am.Our morning    
 break is from 10.30am until 10.45am   
 and we stop for lunch at 12.30pm.The  
 afternoon is from 1.30pm until        
 3.15pm.Our work for the day is usually
 maths,English or project but depending
 on the day we could also have P.E.,art

 cafeteria where I buy a hotdog,       
 flavoured milk,chocolate and crisps.As

 like to watch television.After tea I  
 go out to play or watch television    
 again.Before going to bed at 9.45pm I
