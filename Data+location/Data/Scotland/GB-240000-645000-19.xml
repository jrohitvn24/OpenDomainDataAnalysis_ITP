		<content> Around the town and in the countryside
 many people have taken to jogging and 
 a few of the joggers have entered the 
 Ayr Half Marathon and the Glasgow     
 Marathon. Young people enjoy pop music
 and some may be seen walking around   
 listening on a walkman or to a large  
 transistor to their favourite singers.
 There are a few who dress in punk     
 clothes and have way out  styles but  
 in the main the young people wear the 
 popular light coloured fashion        
 clothes. The older woman who prefers  
 more expensive exclusive clothes may  
 buy them in Jen McLeod's in Brown     
 Street. The people in the countryside 
 tend to wear conventional fashions of 
 trousers or skirts and Pringle        
 knitwear or other casual clothes.     
 Farmers' weddings are very fashionable
 affairs.                              
                                       </content>
