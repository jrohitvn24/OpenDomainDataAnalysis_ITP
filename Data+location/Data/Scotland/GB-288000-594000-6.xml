		<content> Thornhill lies 13 miles north of      
 Dumfries on the Glasgow road and is   
 now in the main a domitory settlement.
 People staying there travel to        
 Dumfries or Sanquhar for employment or
 are involved in farm work around the  
 village itself.The main employer is   
 the estate of the Duke of Buccleuch.  
 The only industry Thornhill had       
 recently was its sausage factory      
 originally established by the         
 Kirkpatrick family.When the family    
 eventually sold the factory it went   
 into decline and it was eventually    
 closed in the mid 1970s by its then   
 owners the FMC.The first industry in  
 Thornhill was mining related,but it   
 died in the middle of the last century
 with the arrival of the railway.Rail  
 transport was faster and cheaper and  
 horses and carts could not compete.
