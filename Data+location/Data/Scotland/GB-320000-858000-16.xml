		<title>16Sites Around Birnie.</title>
		<content>  Birnie lies only a few miles South of
 Elgin which has been the main town in 
 Moray for hundreds of years. Elgin has
 a cathedral, burnt down by the Wolf of
 Badenoch in 1390, and is currently    
 being restored. The ruins of Elgin    
 Castle lie at the top of Lady Hill,   
 where the monument of the Duke of     
 Gordon towers over the City of Elgin. 
 There are many churches in Elgin      
 including St Giles Church which stands
 in the middle of the High Street.     
  There are also many churches in the  
 Elgin Area including Spynie Church,   
 Pluscarden Abbey and Birnie Church.   
  Six miles to the North lies the Moray
 Firth Coast along which there are many
 beautiful beaches enjoyed by the      
 number of tourists who visit the area.
 The beaches at Lossiemouth, Hopeman   
 and Roseisle are particular pleasant.
