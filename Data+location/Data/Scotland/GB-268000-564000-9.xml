		<title>09A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> AN AVERAGE SATURDAY                   
 Saturday begins at 9o'clock in the    
 morning,and, following a breakfast of 
 toast and cereal I go to the library  
 at the nearby town of Castle Douglas.I
 usually shop for stationery and sweets
 before going home for lunch which is  
 at 1p.m. My family enjoy being        
 together and lunch is very much a     
 family meal and social occasion.Lunch 
 might consist of soup and bread       
 followed by salad, and cheese and     
 biscuits.After lunch I escape to the  
 garden where a favourite tree provides
 me with much pleasure.I enjoy watching
 animals and birds.Soon a bike ride is 
 decided on with my brother.After this 
 we have supper which is our main meal 
 of the day,perhaps consisting of a    
 chicken casserole,broccoli and        
 potatoes and raspberry meringue and   
 cream.Then I read my book ,then bed.  </content>
