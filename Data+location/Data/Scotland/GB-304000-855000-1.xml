		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW -RAFFORD AREA</title>
		<content> The area we visited lies on high      
 ground to the South East of Forres,a  
 town near the Moray Firth in the North
 East of Scotland.                     
  The land is almost entirely rural    
 with forests or farmland being the    
 dominant feature.The farmland is a    
 mixture of cultivated grassland and   
 crops.The main crop is barley which is
 used for malt in the whisky industry. 
  Apart from isolated farms the nly    
 house in the area lie in upper and    
 lower Rafford.There is a mixture of   
 old properties and new bungalows.The  
 only large mansion in the area is     
 Blervie House , a large Georgian style
 house with its own grounds.           
  Most people apart from farmers       
 commute to Forres,Elgin or Kinloss    
 where there is a large NATO           
 airbase.There are few amenities in the
 area.                                 </content>
