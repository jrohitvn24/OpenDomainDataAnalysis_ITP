		<title>16FARMING NEAR INVERURIE</title>
		<content> The crops that are grown on the farms 
 in the area include barley, oats,     
 turnips, potatoes, hay and silage. A  
 recent crop introduced to the area is 
 oilseed rape which is grown for its   
 oil and animal feed. After harvesting 
 the crops are sent to merchants, but  
 some are kept for winter feed.        
                                       
                                       
 The cattle include Aberdeen Angus and 
 Hereford which are reared for beef.   
 The dairy cattle include Ayrshire and 
 Friesian. In winter the animals are   
 fed on barley, oats, hay and silage.  
 As the winters can be quite cold and  
 severe most of the animals are housed 
 indoors during the winter months.     
                                       
 The nearest market is in Aberdeen. The
 Mart (market) in Inverurie was closed 
 a short time ago.                     </content>
