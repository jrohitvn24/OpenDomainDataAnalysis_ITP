		<content> We did a survey of the parents of     
 children in the school to find out the
 sort of jobs they did.  We found there
 was only a small level of             
 unemployment.  Only three fathers were
 unemployed and we think that the      
 mothers who are unemployed do not want
 a job outside their home at the       
 moment.  We think this, because very  
 few of the mothers of children in the 
 last three years of Primary school did
 not have a job, but in the first two  
 years of Primary school less than half
 of the children had a mother in       
 employment.  Quite a lot of the       
 mothers had jobs which were part-time,
 only working mornings or afternoons   
 during school hours, or working in the
 evenings when there would probably be 
 someone else at home to look after the
 children.                             
                                       </content>
