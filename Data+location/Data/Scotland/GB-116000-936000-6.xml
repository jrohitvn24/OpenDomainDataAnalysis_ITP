		<title>06Harris Tweed.</title>
		<content>  Although this material is called     
 'Harris' tweed it is woven in most of 
 the islands in the Outer Hebrides,    
 mainly Lewis.                         
  When tweeds are sold they are stamped
 with the 'orb' mark, which means that 
 the product is 100% pure new wool and 
 hand-woven. were it not for this mark,
 the weaver would be out of business,  
 as the same tweed, could be produced  
 on a power loom, but being hand-woven 
 it is more expensive to buy, and in   
 turn entitles the weaver to a higher  
 wage.                                 
  An average tweed is thirty eight     
 weavers yards long, a weavers yard is 
 8 feet so a tweed is 304 feet.        
  The weft threads are called 'picks', 
 and there is on average 18 picks to an
 inch of material.
