		<title>02Pitlessie Village</title>
		<content> Pitlessie village is bordered by the  
 River Eden to the north and the A92 to
 the south east.The village obviously  
 came into existence due to the river. 
 Houses in the village are generally of
 the small cottage type, many of which 
 are centuries old.Larger stone built  
 houses, also fairly old, are to be    
 found in the{older, more central part 
{of the village.}Only a few privately  
 built modern houses exist, along with 
 two groups of post war council houses.
 There are few amenities in Pitlessie, 
 a{Post Office/village shop, hotel,    
{primary school, village hall and a    
{public park.}All other amenities have 
 to be sought outwith the village.     
 The village was at one time a thriving
 community.But this activity has       
 dwindled over this century and        
 Pitlessie has become, as many others, 
 a{pleasantly quiet dormitory village. </content>
