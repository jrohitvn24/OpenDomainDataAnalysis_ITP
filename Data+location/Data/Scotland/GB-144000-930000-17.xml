		<content> I interveiwed{Mrs Gold}about buying   
 from catalogues. She said she buys    
 from catalogues because it is more    
 conveniant and there is more variety. 
 She found the prices about the same as
 on the Island and in the catalogue.   
 She has never had any trouble buying  
 from{Kays},she says they are very     
 good. Mostly she buys clothes and     
 toys.{Toys due to Christmas and       
{clothes for Summer.}She views their   
 fashion choice as reasoable, and the  
 goods also of reasonable quality. I   
 asked her if she thought catalogues   
 varied in quality, she answered , no  
 but some catalogues are more fashion  
 orientated than others. In her opinion
 catalogues make an enormous profit,   
 but in spite of this she thinks they  
 play a great part in our lifestyle,   
 because they are a way of shopping.
