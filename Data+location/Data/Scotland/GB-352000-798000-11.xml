		<content>{Local History:                        
{Place Name}_ The name "Aboyne" is a   
 compound of the Gaelic words "A", a   
 ford, and "boinne" or "buinne", a     
 current of rippling water, ie a ford  
 across the River Dee, a little south  
 of the church.                        
{Historic Buildings}_ Aboyne{Castle}was
 built in 1400.  It remained in the    
 Gordon family until 1914.  From then  
 until 1937 it became derelict.  It was
 then re_acquired by the Gordon family.
 The restoration to its present state  
 began in 1974 and was completed in    
 1979.  Since then it has been the home
 of the present Lord Aboyne.  The      
 castle is occupied all year.  Part of 
 the out buildings added in 1869 are   
 used as garages.  No additions have   
 been made since the restoration.  The 
 castle is not open to the public as   
 Lord Aboyne feels it is too small.    </content>
