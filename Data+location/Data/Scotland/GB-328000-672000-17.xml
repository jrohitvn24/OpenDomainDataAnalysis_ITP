		<title>17LOCAL POLITICS</title>
		<content> The area, basically, tends to support 
{Labour.}We did a survey in May 1985,  
 which showed 38% supported{Labour,}15%
 supported the{Conservatives,}17% were 
 for the{SDP/Liberal Alliance,}6% were 
 for the{SNP}and 24% were for other    
 parties, or would not say. We have a  
 Labour MP, 2 Labour and 1 Conservative
 Regional Councillors, and 3 Labour and
 2 Conservative District Councillors.  
  The vast majority of people (74%) saw
{unemployment}as the most serious      
 problem in our society today.         
  In general we came to the conclusion 
 that local people know very little    
 about politics and the people who     
 represent them. Less than 2/3 knew    
 that{Dr. Gavin Strang}was their MP or 
 what his party was; less than half    
 knew who their Regional Councillor    
 was; and less than 1 in 6 knew who    
 their District Councillor was!        </content>
