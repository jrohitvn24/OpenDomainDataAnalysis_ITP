		<content> When Jean asked for more time to pay, 
 the moneylender turned nasty.  He took
 her Child Benefit Book from her and   
 threatened to send in the Bailiffs.   
 In the end Jean and Colin had to sell 
 their television, music centre and    
 Jean's engagement ring to pay off     
 their debt.                           
{It is against the law for moneylenders
{to call at a house uninvited.} Most of
 them do not have a licence from the   
 Office of Fair Trading, which is also 
 a criminal offence.  Many moneylenders
 harrass or threaten people who cannot 
 keep up repayments, and that too is an
 offence.                              
 Anyone with debt problems should      
 contact their Citizens Advice Bureau.
