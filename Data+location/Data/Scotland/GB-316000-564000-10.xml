		<title>10Village of Newbie near Annan</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mary Sheldon who has   
 lived at Newbie all her life.These are
 the{changes}she has noticed :         
    "I was born at Newbie Mains in     
 1923.The houses in Three Trees Road   
 must be over 100 years old as my      
 grandfather worked at Cochrans        
 (boiler_making factory) for 25 years  
 and left work 3 days before I was     
 born.They built the houses with bricks
 which were made at Newbie.When I was a
 girl we used to enjoy the lovely parks
 which have now been left to grow wild,
 and the ponds where we used to feed   
 the fish while sitting in the rose    
 garden.                               
    I still think Newbie is a nice     
 place to live, but lots could be done 
 to smarten up this village and give us
 more social help. There is nothing for
 children or adults to do without going
 into Annan."                          </content>
