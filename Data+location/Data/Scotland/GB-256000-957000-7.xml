		<title>07The Living Church Tongue</title>
		<content> The population of Tongue is quite     
 small and therefor Church membership  
 is small but attendance at Sunday wor 
 ship is proportionately quite good.   
 There is a Sunday School consisting of
 mainly up to 6 year olds at the moment
 and a small but lively Woman' Guild of
 mainly older women. The{Guild}organ   
 ises{sales, festivals,carol concerts  
{and other fund raising events}and is a
 great support to the church financial 
 ly as well as spiritually. The{Sunday 
{School}uses Scripture Union material  
 and often participates in services.   
 At the moment there is no organisation
 attached to the church for the teenage
 group but this will perhaps come in   
 time. Since St Andrews is a church of 
 Scotland it has{Elders}who are the    
 Kirk Session and who with six members 
 of the congregation make up the Congre
 gational Board and run the church.    </content>
