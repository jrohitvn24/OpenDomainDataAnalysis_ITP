		<title>17THE REV. A.Q. MORTON 2</title>
		<content> His theory is that writers identify   
 themselves by their use of the most   
 frequently used words - 'a', 'the' and
 the commonest conjunctions and        
 prepositions. The frequency of use and
 position in the sentence of these     
 words gives an expert like Mr. Morton 
 the information he needs. In lOOO     
 words he can find about l5 habits and 
 could probably identify the writer if 
 he had an authentic sample for        
 comparison. Mr. Morton's fame as an   
 expert in this field has led him to   
 appear as an expert witness in courts 
 as far distant as America and, more   
 recently, Australia.
