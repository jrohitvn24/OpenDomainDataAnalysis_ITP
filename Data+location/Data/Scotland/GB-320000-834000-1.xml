		<title>01Morinsh side of Ben Rinnes</title>
		<content> This block consists almost entirely of
 SW shoulders of Ben Rinnes (840mtrs)  
                                       
 with the Hill of Knocknashalg as its  
 main feature                          
 There is no industry and the rocky    
 heather ground contains grouse and a  
 few pairs of Ptarmigan. However the   
 grouse population has seriously       
 declined and many resons are          
 given,poor heather for feeding,due to 
 bad burning of heather, increase in   
 vermin and in the tick population.    
 One disturbing feature is a           
 bulldozed                             
 track which leads from GlenRivers to  
 the plateu of Ben Rinnes It is a blot 
 and a scar on the landscape and       
 should never have been allowed, why   
 are these hill roads allowed to be    
 made without any planning permission.
