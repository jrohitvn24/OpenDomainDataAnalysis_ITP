 All around the island, dry-stone sheep
 pounds have been built to collect in  
 the sheep. There are ten of these en- 
 closures still in use.                
 At high-tide the sheep are rounded up 
 by the men. Each owner recognises his 
 own flock by the ear-markings which   
 are cuts made into the ears. The      
 sheep are gathered in for shearing,   
 dipping, worming and for killing.     
 Their flesh has a stronger taste      
 because they eat seaweed on the shore.
 They usually stick to tangle or       
 lamanaria. They also keep to their own
 area of the shore which is called a   
 clo-jung.
