		<title>07Kirkconnel:Poetic Tradition</title>
		<content> While Robert Burns has, as far as we  
 can tell, no recorded association with
 Kirkconnel he would know it well      
 through his journeys between Dumfries 
 and his native Ayrshire. However,     
 Kirkconnel boasts its own poetical    
 heritage as being the birth-place     
 of James Hyslop (23 July 1798) whose  
 most notable work was 'The Cameronian 
 Dream'.                               
 Alexander Anderson (30 April 1845) who
 wrote under the pseudonym 'Surfaceman'
 and who became Chief Librarian at     
 Edinburgh University had several works
 published ,including 'A Song Of Labour
 and Other Poems'.                     
 This literary tradition is continued  
 today by Robert Mathieson who has had 
 'Your Finest Hour and Other Poems'    
 published.(Mr. Mathieson supplied the 
 information on page2,'Kirkconnel:In My
 Young Days'.                          </content>
