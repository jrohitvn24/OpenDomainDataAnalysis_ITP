		<title>01The Shore At W Gailes Golf C</title>
		<content> The area is more than two thirds sea  
 popular for local fishing boats to    
 moor when fishing for mackeral.       
 There is a large rock named the       
 Lappock Rock beneath the water.   The 
 rock is marked by a bouy seen from the
 shore.The rest of the block is made   
 up of beach and a stretch of golf     
 course.The beach is used by joggers   
 and dog walkers from Barassie.   To   
 stop erosion the beach is at this part
 being held in place by concrete blocks
 and wire.   Between the beach and     
 golf-course is a stretch of high sand 
 dunes.   Included in the block are two
 fairways of the western Gailes private
 golf Club.   This course is a typicla 
 seaside links course used during the  
 preliminary round of the open         
 championship.
