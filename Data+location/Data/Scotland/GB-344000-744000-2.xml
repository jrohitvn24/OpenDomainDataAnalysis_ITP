 The population of Inverarity is about 
 one hundred and eighty.Most of the    
 population is made up of males. The   
 people mainly live in four or five    
 person families The families, apart   
 from those in the village, are widely 
 spread apart.                         
 The majority of the populatoin is made
 up of children below the age of       
 twelve.The other large group is in the
 twenty to fifty age range.From our    
 survey we also found that Inverarity  
 had very few elderly people in the    
 community.We also found that there    
 were about three boys for every one   
 girl.                                 
 Most of the working population work on
 the land with a few travelling into   
 nearby towns,such as,Forfar or Dundee.
