 There is a very successful salmon     
 fishing station at the mouth of the   
 River Naver. It catches around 3500   
 salmon per year and these are taken by
 road and rail for sale in             
 Billingsgate. The fishery is          
 controlled by the landlords on the    
 banks of the river, and the only      
 locals who benefit are a few casual   
 employees who work there for a few    
 weeks each summer. However, there is  
 also some unofficial netting on the   
 river.{LOCH FISHING }The numerous     
 lochs in the surrounding hills are    
 full of brown trout. Local hotels own 
 the rights to some of those but in    
 practise they are open to all.        
 Bettyhill is an excellent place for a 
 fishing holiday. The local lobster    
 fishermen will occasionally take      
 visitors on sea angling trips.        </content>
