		<title>07Ferryman at Threave Castle</title>
		<content> I arrive at the Castle at 9.30 am. I  
 bring the boat out of the shed and    
 check the engine. If everything is all
 right I fill it up with petrol. The   
 next thing I do is to take the boat   
 across to the island so that I can    
 sweep the Castle floors before the    
 visitors start coming.                
 Once I have finished the floors I go  
 outside and see if there are any      
 tourists wanting to come across to the
 Castle. If no-one is standing at the  
 steps I have a look and see if anyone 
 is coming down the path from the farm,
 Kelton Mains (which is 0.5 mile away).
 If I can see any people coming I take 
 the boat across and wait for them. If 
 no-one is coming I help Mr Welsh (the 
 castle guide) cut the grass which     
 could take 5 days to finish. If the   
 weather is good we have lots of       
 tourists visiting the Castle.         </content>
