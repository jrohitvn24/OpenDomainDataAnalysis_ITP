		<content>  Most of the farms in  our  area  have
 between 300-600 acres of land.        
                                       
  The main crop is barley but  recently
 some farmers  have  been  growing  oil
 seed rape and many  have  successfully
 introduced  vegetables.               
                                       
  Cattle and sheep are found on most of
 the farms.  Most  of  the  cattle  are
 Hereford X Friesian but there are also
 Charolais,   Simmental  and   Limousin
 crosses.  Lambs  produced  are  mostly
 Suffolk crosses.  The fattened animals
 are sold at Cupar Market to butchers. 
                                       
  One  farm  has  battery  hens for egg
 production.                           
                                       
  All of the farmers  interviewed  came
 from farming families.
