		<content> Living as we do, in close proximity to
 the busy dual carriageway Dundee-Perth
 road and only 6 miles from the centre 
 of the city of Dundee, is very        
 beneficial from the point of view of  
 our business of boarding dogs and     
 cats. Owners like the idea of their   
 pets going into the country to be     
 looked after while they themselves are
 absent from home. But, the continuous 
 roar of the traffic from early morning
 till late in the evening is in stark  
 contrast to the beautiful views of the
 fields, hills and trees seen to the   
 North-West. Looking Eastwards,        
 multi-storey housing on the skyline   
 remind one how close Dundee has got to
 Longforgan in the last 20 years, and  
 the main fear is, how long will the   
 remaining 2 mile green belt remain in 
 existence to protect the surrounding  
 landscape for future generations.     </content>
