		<title>14A Dundrennan Dairyman</title>
		<content> My dad is a dairyman. He has an early 
 start in the morning, getting up at 4 
 o'clock. He walks down to the farm    
 with the dog and sets up the dairy and
 parlour before going out to the field 
 to bring the cows in to be milked.    
 Each cow has to have her udder washed 
 before she is milked and while she is 
 milking she gets dairy nuts to eat.   
 Once she is finished she is let out   
 into the cubicles where she can either
 lie down or go into the feeding       
 passage to eat the silage.After the   
 cows are all milked he lets them out  
 to the field.He does the same at 3 o' 
 clock in the afternoon.When he is not 
 milking he helps calf the cows.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
