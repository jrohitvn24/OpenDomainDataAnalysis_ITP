		<title>18ROYAL CELEBRATIONS: SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>   Mr Learmont, a senior citizen living
 in Shawhead, remembers when King      
 George VI was crowned in 1937. The    
 people of the parish celebrated with  
 sports such as running races, tug o'  
 war and five-a-side football. Every   
 child received a coronation mug.      
   Queen Elizabeth II was crowned in   
 1953 and that was a great celebration.
 People watched it on the television   
 but only 3 houses had televisions: the
 Learmonts, the Johnstones and the     
 Proudlocks. They thought that it would
 not be very good reception but it was.
 They had small black and white        
 screens. After the programme there was
 a bonfire up on the Doons which is a  
 big hill and the fire could be seen   
 for miles around.                     
   The Queen's Silver Jubilee was in   
 1977. There were sports and pony rides
 and the children got a jubilee crown. </content>
