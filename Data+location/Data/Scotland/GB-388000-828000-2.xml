		<title>02POPULATION</title>
		<content> This area is dominated by{arable land.
 The population is randomly distributed
 throughout the region and resides in  
{farmhouses and small cottages.}There  
 are no settlements of any significant 
 size and the population travels to    
 Ellon for everyday services and       
 requirements. The farms have remained 
 in family ownership over many         
 generations so the population has seen
 few changes until the early 1970's    
 when there was an influx of{oil       
{related personel.}The landscape       
 portrays an image of profitable       
 agricultural activities, shown by well
 maintained farmhouses and buildings,  
 the size of fields and the level of   
 mechanisation found on the farms. The 
 region is likely to remain            
 predominantly agricultural as{oil     
{reserves}are only predicted to last   
 until the 1990's.                     </content>
