		<content> Twisting, narrow roads connect one    
 small farm to another. The type of    
 farm depends on the quality of the    
 land around it: hay, crops, sheep,    
 cattle or a combination. Mid-way along
 the coastal road is the Gibbhill      
 sawmill where trees from nearby       
 coniferous plantations are stripped   
 and sawn. Further on is Seaward       
 Caravan Park, a popular resort with   
 the area's many Summer visitors. On   
 the Kirkcudbright side of the Dee is a
 boat-building yard, adjacent to the   
 Yatching Club H.Q. Along the mud-flats
 of the estuary are moored many small  
 boats. At the historic site of the    
 Castledykes are the schools, the      
 football pitch and a recent housing   
 scheme. Building has also begun of a  
 sewage reprocessing plant. Beyond the 
 town lies St. Mary's Isle, a          
 beautiful, wooded private estate.     </content>
