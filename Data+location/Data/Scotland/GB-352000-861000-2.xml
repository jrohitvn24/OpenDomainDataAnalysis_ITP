 In the village the trees are mostly   
 deciduous.  Around our school there   
 are many different types of fully     
 grown trees, e.g. Lime, Elm, Beech,   
 Sycamore, Oak, Ash, Whitebeam, Maple, 
 Horsechestnut and Sweetchestnut.Young 
 Rowan and Whitebeam trees grow at the 
 "Bleachy",a picturesque amenity area  
 planted out in 1976/77.Also growing   
 there, beside the Fordyce Burn,are    
 Elderberry, Willow, Sycamore and      
 Laburnum. Our survey showed that      
 Sycamore and Maple were the trees     
 grown mainly in Fordyce, but the      
 wooded areas i.e. Greenhill           
 Plantation, Cottonhill, Towie Wood,   
 Hillend Plantation and Fordyce Hill   
 Plantation are mainly of Spruce and   
 Firwoods.Copper Beeches are to be     
 found at the Old Manse.               </content>
