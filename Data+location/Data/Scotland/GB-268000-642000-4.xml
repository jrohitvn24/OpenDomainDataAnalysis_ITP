		<content> From a survey we found that tastes in 
 entertainment tended to vary between  
 different age groups.Teenagers liked  
 pop music and discos while older      
 people,especially 50 + often preferred
 Theatre and Classical music.Ballroom  
 Dancing and Music Recitals were also  
 mentioned.Many people go out of       
 Strathven to Glasgow, East Kilbride   
 and Hamilton in order to find suitable
 entertainment. Many people thought    
 that a new Cinema was needed(the old  
 one was unprofitable) since the       
 nearest is in Hamilton.Young people   
 also said a Discotheque was needed to 
 keep teenagers off the streets.There  
 are attempts to raise money for a     
 Swimming Pool beside the new Sports   
 Centre. The Ballgreen Hall is the     
 scene of many discos and concerts and 
 the Town Mill of plays. The other main
 leisure facility is the Sports Centre.</content>
