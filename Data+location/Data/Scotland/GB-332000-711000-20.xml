		<content> Near Springfield there is a{Porage    
{Oats factory.}The factory is one of   
 the most up to date factories in      
 Britain. It employs up to 80 people, 7
 of them coming from Springfield.      
 A.&amp;.R. Scott have been producing      
 porage, a breakfast food from oats for
 more than a 100 years. The oats are   
 cleaned by passing through a separator
 which sorts the grain into 4 different
 types. Then the oats, intended for    
 milling are passed down the kiln and  
 then dried and partially toasted. Then
 only the best are made into oatmeal.  
 The pinhead oatmeal is steamed and    
 then passed through rollers to make   
 oatflakes. These flakes are our porage
 oats. Animal feed is one of the main  
 by products from the factory. People  
 make a lot of other things with porage
 oats, for example, muesli, another    
 popular breakfast food.               </content>
