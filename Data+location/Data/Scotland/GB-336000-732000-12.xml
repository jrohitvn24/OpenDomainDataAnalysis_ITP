		<content>{Balgowan Square}is a piece of waste   
 ground between Balgowan Avenue and    
 Helmsdale Avenue. It is a bleak place 
 where a church hall stood until it was
 burned down in 1973. Since then grass 
 has been planted but nothing else has 
 been done to it. Dundee Institute of  
 Architects ran a competition to       
 convert a piece into a play area and  
 we thought of the square. We measured 
 it and consulted the play furniture   
 catalogues. Then we made a scale plan 
 of the square. Now we are just waiting
 for the District Council to put our   
 plan into action!!                    
 Not far from our school runs the old  
{Dundee to Newtyle Railway.}Though the 
 line was closed in 1955 it had been   
 very busy in the 19th Century carrying
 farm produce,livestock and linen into 
 Dundee and coal,manure and            
 manufactured goods out to Newtyle.    </content>
