		<content> Most of the people who live in this   
 block belong to the Church of         
 Scotland. The Parish Church is in the 
 village of Auchencairn and there are  
 approximately 150 people on the Church
 roll. The average congregation however
 seldom exceeds twenty-five.           
 Auchencairn Parish shares its Minister
 with the neighbouring parish of       
 Rerrick which has its church in       
 Dundrennan. The Minister holds a      
 service in both churches each Sunday. 
 The church is over one hundred years  
 old and is in good repair but the cost
 of the up-keep of the Church and the  
 Manse is a heavy burden on the        
 Congregation and it is a continuing   
 battle to raise funds to keep the     
 Church going.
