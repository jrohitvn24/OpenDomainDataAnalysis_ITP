		<title>18TOURISM  IN  FORDYCE  AREA</title>
		<content> Fordyce is a tiny village with only   
 l34 inhabitants,yet,though there is no
 residential hotel, a great number of  
 visitors come in summer, for, not only
 is it a historic showcase but it is a 
 good centre for car tourists to the   
 Moray Firth. It has had amenities     
 developed to encourage tourists and it
 is proposed to construct toilets and  
 other conveniences for them. The new  
 licensed Hawthorne Restaurant,opened  
 in l984,serves meals 'with a local    
 flavour' to its guests. There is a    
 beautiful park, formerly the village  
 bleaching green, which was planted out
 with young trees in l967 and made into
 a picnic area with tables and bench   
 seats. Ben Cummings' Well was built   
 there,beside Fordyce Burn,in l953 -   
 Coronation Year - so that visitors can
 have a drink from a clear mountain    
 stream.                               </content>
