		<title>20BROCH AT BUCHLYVIE</title>
		<content>{FAIRY KNOWE}Grid ref.586943, is a     
 small green knoll 1 mile east of the  
 village, first recorded as a{tumulus} 
 in 1796 and since excavated in 1975.  
 The site was discovered to be first of
 all a timber{round-house}of the Iron  
 Age, about the 1st century A.D. in    
 which the post holes were visible and 
 parts of timber uprights remained. In 
 the 2nd Century a{stone-built broch   
 was erected on the same site,         
 apparently with no break in occupation
 of the place, probably by Buchlyvie   
 people. These later residents had a   
 knowledge of weaving and working in   
 metals, did mixed farming and were    
 apparently in contact with the Roman  
 forces either by trading or by        
 looting.Some 500 small finds are in   
 the{Smith Museum, Stirling.}Finds     
 range from a Neolithic axe to Roman   
 artefacts.                            </content>
