		<content> In 1925, Sanquhar, then little more   
 than the High Street, had its own     
 cobbler, clog-maker, two tailors, a   
 bakery and an abattoir - none of these
 establishments are now in evidence.   
 The main employers were two forges,   
 two coal mines, a brickworks, a       
 brewery and agriculture. The town had 
 4 ministers, one doctor and one       
 policeman. Gas was the source of power
 and the lamplighter, who was also the 
 town crier, rang the Tolbooth bells   
 twice daily - when the shops were to  
 open and close. Horse drawn transport 
 was dominant - milk, groceries and    
 coal being delivered by cart. A semi  
 professional football team  had its   
 stadium on the outskirts of the town. 
 Youth organisations- Guides, Brownies,
 Cubs and Scouts - were well supported;
 and for adults the town offered  golf,
 green bowling and quoits.             </content>
