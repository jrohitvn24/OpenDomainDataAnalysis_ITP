		<title>11CRUISING CLUB.</title>
		<content> During the winter months cruising is  
 limited therefore an opportunity      
 arises for navigation talks.A popular 
 course is"THE YACHTMASTERS            
 COURSE".Near CHRISTMAS there is       
 a frostbite series.The "REDWING "     
 trophy is awarded to the boat that    
 cruises furthest from TROON.There is  
 also  an ocean youth club for ages    
 13/14.They live on a ship 71 feet long
 with a professional skipper, 2 mates  
 and 12 young people.The normal        
 clothing is oilskins,a life/jacket and
 harness in either yellow or red.Safety
 equipment must include rockets and    
 flares life/jacket and flotation      
 gear.Every member must be skilled in  
 "MAN OVERBOARD DRILL!"also everyone   
 must be able to sail a boat in case of
 an emergency arising on board the     
 ship.A most enjoyable sport.
