		<title>04One Week's Leisure Time - 1</title>
		<content>                                       
    On a Monday my leisure time is     
 after school. I have guides in the    
 South Esk church from 7 o clock to 9 o
 clock. We have 5 patrols called after 
 flowers. I am in the Primroses patrol.
 I have been in the guides for about a 
 year and a half. We have to pay 30    
 pence for guide funds. I also have an 
 orchestra practice for about 5 months 
 every year. I play a cello which is a 
 big version of a viola.               
    On a Tuesday I usually just go out 
 to the back garden and play with my   
 next door neighbour. Or some nights I 
 just sit in and watch a comedy on T.V.
    On a Wednesday I go to Highland    
 Dancing from 4.45 pm to 6.30 pm. We   
 pay Â£20 for 10 weeks. That is for a   
 lesson ona Saturday and Wednesday. I  
 enjoy my dancing but it is hard work. 
 I am on my gold bar grade just now.   </content>
