		<title>19GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content>   In order to find out the most       
 popular game in Knightsridge we       
 conducted a survey throughout the     
 school. The game which was enjoyed    
 most by 95% of the children was Chain 
 Tig. In this derivation of the basic  
 game of tig, the chaser endeavours to 
 catch the other children, but when    
 caught they join hands and proceed to 
 catch as many others as possible.     
 Eventually a long chain of children is
 formed and once they are all caught   
 and holding hands the game begins     
 again with the last caught as chaser. 
   The other popular games include     
 skipping and ball games to which      
 traditional rhymes are sung. The girls
 enjoy hopscotch and a complicated game
 which involves jumping over joined    
 elastic bands! The boys prefer more   
 boisterous games such as British      
 Bulldogs and Two Man Hunt.            </content>
