		<title>14CHILDRENS GAMES</title>
		<content>     At play-time we often play{       
{football.}We don't have a proper      
 football pitch because the school is  
 too small so we play on the tarred    
 area of the playground. As there are  
 only eleven children who play, we     
 change the rules to suit.             
    Another game we play is called     
{'Three Little Matchsticks.'}This is a 
 miming game where one person (the     
 king) has to guess what the others are
 doing. Once the king has guessed a    
 mime correctly, he has to chase       
 everyone until he catches the new     
 'king' and the game starts again.     
    We also thought up a game called   
{'Cabbages.'}One person is 'It' and he 
 chases the others. If someone is      
 caught they have to lean against the  
 wall. They can be freed if someone    
 runs under their arms. Once everyone  
 is caught the game is over.           </content>
