		<title>19CASTLE - CROOKSTON ,GLASGOW</title>
		<content> At Brockburn Road in the middle of the
 Pollok housing scheme stands the ruin 
 of Crookston Castle, one of the oldest
 fortified buildings in the country.   
 The lst castle was wooden and was     
 built by Sir Robert De Croc in the    
 (12th, it was rebuilt in the (l5th by 
 Sir Alex. Stewart. Another owner was  
 Darnley the lst, and he took part in  
 the uprising against James IV.  In    
 l488 the king led an attack on the    
 castle with Mons Meg (cannon).  The   
 castle surrendered in under l day.    
                                       
 Legend says that Mary Queen of Scots  
 and Lord Darnley stayed in Crookston  
 Castle and that she watched the Battle
 of Langside from the Castle but there 
 is no evidence to prove this.
