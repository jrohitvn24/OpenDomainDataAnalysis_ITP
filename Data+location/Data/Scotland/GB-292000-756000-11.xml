		<content>  It would be easy to imagine the local
 community being swamped by the tourist
 invasion,but this is far from true as 
 a very strong sense of identity is    
 maintained mainly by memberships of a 
 myriad of clubs and orgaisations.     
  Prominent amongst these are          
 national groups like the Rotary, the  
 Round Table which organises the       
 November fireworks display , and Help 
 the Aged which is particularly active 
 with the numerous retirement homes    
 like Chequers or Sunnybrae.           
  The charitable instincts of the      
 community are perhaps best seen by    
 recent examples: the Tayside Body     
 Scanner Appeal raised over Â£1500  from
 the school alone after a sponsored    
 walk, while another Â£250 was raised by
 pupils for one of their fellows whose 
 house was destroyed by fire.
