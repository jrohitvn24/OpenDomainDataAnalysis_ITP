		<title>05PENSIONERS' CLUB GREENOCK</title>
		<content> There is a{pensioners' club}in        
 Aberfoyle Road.  Here the old people  
 in the area can have their lunch every
 weekday at a cost of 45p.             
 The club is funded by the council. 7  
 people are employed - they cook,serve 
 and clean up.  Between 60 - 90 people 
 use the club each day.                
 After their lunch, some of the old    
 people remain behind to play games    
 such as bingo, cards, dominoes, chess 
 and carpet bowls.                     
 We interviewed some of the pensioners.
 All of them agreed that the meals were
 the {"best"}in Greenock!              
 The pensioners are all very happy with
 the club because it not only gives    
 them the chance to have a good meal   
 every day, but also the opportunity to
 meet other people.                    
{We think this is ideal for pensioners}
