		<content> During the school year several social 
 gatherings are held.These generally   
 involve raising money for the school  
 fund.A coffee evening held in November
 provides an evening out for a large   
 number of the community.As well as    
 serving coffee,the P.T.A.runs several 
 stalls and raffles.                   
    Another great attraction is the    
 concerts performed by the             
 children.These are usually at         
 Christmas and at the end of the summer
 term.School funds have just provided a
 stage for the children to make their  
 performances even more enjoyable.     
    When it comes to party time at     
 Hallowe'en or Christmas,everyone joins
 in.Santa and Rudolph are supplied by  
 the guards at the local M.O.D.range.  
    The school is also used as a       
 Polling Station.
