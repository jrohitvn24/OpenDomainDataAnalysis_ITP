		<title>15Bannachra Castle Arden</title>
		<content> The ruins of Bannachra Castle can be  
 seen in the garden of Bannachra House.
 It was built in the sixteenth century 
 by the Colquhouns because the         
 Macgregors and Macfarlanes were       
 fighting against them.   The castle   
 looks right up Glen Fruin and the     
 River Fruin is like a moat on one side
 of it.   Sir Humphrey Colquhoun was   
 killed in the castle in 1592 by a     
 poisoned arrow.   The castle was      
 destroyed at the time  of the Battle  
 of Glen Fruin in 1603.   In a field   
 below the castle there is a cairn     
 which marks the spot where some boys  
 are said to be buried.  They had come 
 out from Dumbarton to see the battle.
