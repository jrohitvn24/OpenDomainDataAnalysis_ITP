		<content> Our survey has shown us that the roads
 which carry most traffic are{Ferry    
{Road, Pennywell Road}and{West Granton 
{Road.}These roads are all bus routes  
 and they all carry heavy lorries as   
 well as the usual motor vehicles. This
 affects{Ecology}because motor vehicles
 pollute the air. We noted that the    
 busiest times were when people were   
 travelling to and from work (around   
 09.00 and 17.00 hrs.).{Granton Harbour
 is used to berth a lot of yachts.     
 There are pilot boats and lighthouse  
 supply ships based there. Although    
 the harbour does not attract a lot of 
 foreign ships, lately there have been 
 regular visits by oil tankers         
 connected with the{North Sea Oil      
{Fields.}On Tuesday 21st.May 1985 the  
 "Bridgeman" from Granton arrived in   
 Grangemouth to pick up oil.
