{A Saturday in the Life of Nathan      
{Bradley, age 7.                       
                                       
  On Saturday 8th June 1985 my mum and 
 I went to the beach at Portobello. We 
 caught crabs, fish and a baby eel. We 
 also collected some rocks for my      
 mum's garden. When we got home we got 
 washed, changed and went up town to do
 some shopping for my brother's        
 birthday and for my holidays in       
 Portugal. I chose a pair of swimming  
 trunks.                               
  After tea I went with my dad to the  
 jet spray to wash the car. The water  
 came out so fast that the hose nearly 
 jumped out of my hand. Later I played 
 with my computer and then I went to   
 bed.                                  
         Nathan Bradley.
