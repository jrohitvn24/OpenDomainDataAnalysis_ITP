		<title>19PARKING</title>
		<content> VEHICLE PARKING IS A REAL PROBLEM IN  
 GALASHIELS AS THE STREETS WERE NOT    
 BUILT TO ACCOMMODATE THE PRESENT      
 VOLUME OF TRAFFIC.                    
 IN THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN THERE ARE   
 MANY DOUBLE YELLOW LINE AREAS WHERE   
 PARKING IS FORBIDDEN AT ALL TIMES. IN 
 OTHER PARTS THERE IS'LIMITED PARKING' 
 WHERE VEHICLES MAY ONLY STAY FOR A    
 MAXIMUM OF 20 MINUTES. TRAFFIC WARDENS
 ARE ON PATROL THROUGHOUT THE DAY.     
 SEVERAL OF THE LARGER SHOPS HAVE THEIR
 OWN CUSTOMER PARKING AREAS.THESE ARE  
 PARTICULARLY NECESSARY NOWADAYS AS    
 MANY FAMILIES SHOP ONLY ONCE EACH WEEK
 SO THEY LIKE TO WHEEL THE SHOPPING    
 TROLLEY RIGHT TO THE CAR AND LOAD THE 
 CONTENTS DIRECTLY INTO THE BOOT.      
 BOTH CHANNEL AND BANK STREET ARE ONE  
 WAY STREETS FOR TRAFFIC AND PARKING IS
 PERMITTED ON ONE SIDE ONLY.EVEN WITH  
 THIS THE STREETS ARE QUITE NARROW.    </content>
