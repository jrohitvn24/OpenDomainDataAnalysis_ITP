 glourious career.                     
                                       
 That career came to an ubrupt end on a
 bright Saturday afternoon.  On the 5th
 of September 1931 John Thomson made   
 his last save.                        
 It was an "old firm game" Celtic v    
 Rangers, the first half had been      
 rather dull and the fans hoped for a  
 more exciting second half. Five       
 minutes into the second  half, the    
 ball broke loose to Rangers young     
 center forward Sam English. Sam saw   
 his chance, but John Thomson was alert
 and came off his line, dived at Sam   
 English's feet like a scrum half, and 
 was hit on the head by Sam English's  
 knee. You could have heard a pin drop 
 in the stadium when the fans realised 
  young John was badly hurt. (cont.)
