		<content> This area is very mountainous, rising 
 to 280 m. A steep sided u-shaped      
 valley,Rackwick Valley has been cut in
 the northwest of the area. The ground 
 is all Moorland with Heather and Peat 
 bogs. A lot of this ws destroyed by   
 fire in Rackwick valley in 1984, but  
 growth has quickly started again. The 
 hill tops suffer from frost damage,so 
 there is little vegetation, just bare 
 shattered rock on the summits. The    
 Dwarfie Stone in Rackwich valley is   
 the only example in Britain of a rock 
 cut tomb, dated 3000 bc. It was the   
 residence of Trolld, a dwarf famed in 
 Norse legend.  This monument has an   
 inscription carved, in persian in 1850
 by Major William Mouncey. He was an   
 eccentric who had been a spy in       
 Afganistan and Persia. He wore Persian
 costume and spent several nights      
 inside the stone.                     </content>
