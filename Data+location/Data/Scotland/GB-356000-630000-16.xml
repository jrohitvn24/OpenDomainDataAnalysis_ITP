		<content> Our area is part of the Scottish      
 Tourist Board which has nine          
 infromation centres in the Region, the
 nearest being Melrose.Our area is not 
 a well-known part of Scotland.Many    
 tourists pass through on the way to   
 Edinburgh.                            
     Tourists can stay in a number of  
 guest houses in the villages or in the
 hotels, the two largest being the     
 Dryburgh Abbey and the Buccleuch Arms.
 The former is a three star hotel set  
 in its own grounds while the latter   
 beside the A68 is an old coaching inn.
     There is a lot to see in the area,
 much of which is within walking       
 distance.Around each village are many 
 pleasant walks.One popular walk is fro
 Newtown to St.Boswells along the      
 Tweed.This route leads to Dryburgh    
 Abbey,an 11th.Century Church where Sir
 Walter Scott and Earl Haig are buried.</content>
