 7:30 on a cold misty morning.Sleeping 
 peacefully.On goes my alarm,up I get. 
 Go down stairs,let the dog out,make   
 the breakfast and get dressed and     
 washed.At last everythings ready.At   
 8:30 Jillian calls on me.We go to     
 school.Reading for half an hour,really
 boring,but its soon over.At least     
 theres choir.We got some songs from   
 the musical "Fiddler on the Roof".Come
 back from the hall and did maths until
 playtime.After playtime we got        
 language.We did writing about drama   
 cards then we got story."Ladyhawke" is
 the title,its really good.After lunch 
 we had art and discussion.Quite       
 good.We go home at 3:15.We are giving 
 a display tonight.Got washed again and
 went back to school.Display was great 
 fun.Everyone loved the artwork and the
 dance we did.                         </content>
