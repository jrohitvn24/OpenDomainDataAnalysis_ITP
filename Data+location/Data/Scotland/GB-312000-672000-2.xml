		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AN ELEVEN YEAR   
 OLD BOY IN NEWBRIDGE                  
 My day starts typically by rising even
 though I don't want to.Once up,I      
 dress, go downstairs and breakfast on 
 branflakes.Next I pack my gym kit,    
 homework book, dinner money and pencil
 case in my canvas schoolbag.I travel  
 to school on a 25 seater bus.On       
 arrival I usually take in the milk for
 pupils under 7.I normally play British
 Bulldogs, football or motorbikes until
 bell time at 8.58am.In school my work 
 includes mathematics, language, craft,
 project, physical education, singing  
 and religious education.My favourite  
 subject is art and my favourite sport 
 is vaulting.Once school is over I     
 arrive home at 3.40pm when I watch    
 television till teatime.I go to bed at
 9.30pm while my brother goes at       
 10.00pm. I wish  I could go then.     </content>
