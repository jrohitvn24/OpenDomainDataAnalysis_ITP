		<title>15Insch pupils visit Academy.</title>
		<content>  On Wednesday the 5th of June at about
 7.05 I was up and getting ready to pay
 a Familiarisation Visit to Inverurie  
 Academy.As I ate my breakfast I wond_ 
 ered what kind of things we would have
 to do.I left the house at 8.00 and    
 went down to the bus stop in the      
 Square where I met three of my class_ 
 mates.As the bus arrived at 8.10.I    
 felt quite nervous.                   
  When we arrived at the Academy we    
 went into the dining hall,where our   
 bus fares were refunded.We bought our 
 dinner tickets and we were told which 
 classes we were in.                   
  Two Prefects took us to our first    
 class, English.The teacher was Mrs.   
 Still, and she explained about our    
 course.After that we visited the      
 Science Department,where we completed 
 interesting Chemistry and Physics     
 experiments.                          </content>
