   During the second part of our visit 
 we were shown round by Mr. Telfer,one 
 of Mr.McKeachie's workers.Mr.Telfer   
 showed us the various buildings on the
 farm and also the machinery.There were
 three combine harvesters,all H        
 registrations.Mr.Telfer also showed us
 the muck spreader,reaping machines and
 tractors.One of the tractors was a    
 MUffield 60BMC Diesel which is used   
 for drainage.                         
   Mr.Telfer then took us to our mini  
 bus to go back to school.We said we   
 had all had a lovely time and we went 
 back stacked with lots of interesting 
 information.
