		<content> This flat area of light sandy soil    
 about 40 hectares in extent,a river   
 terrace on the banks of the River     
 Findhorn,is now used for farming.In   
 the Middle Ages when Darnaway Castle  
 belonged to the Crown and Royal       
 parties visited,jousting and          
 tournaments were held in this pleasant
 natural amphitheatre.In 1563 Mary     
 Queen of Scots visited Darnaway and a 
 tournament to celebrate her visit was 
 held.An old manuscript relates that a 
 canopy was erected amongst the oaks   
 for the ladies.There are still massive
 oaks at the river's edge but it is    
 doubtful that they would be those     
 mentioned in 1563.It is known that the
 oaks must have been fairly large in   
 1829 when they withstood the          
 exceptional flooding of the Findhorn  
 River.
