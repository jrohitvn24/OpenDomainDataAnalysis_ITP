		<title>09SHOPPING - STRANRAER</title>
		<content>  Stranraer is not a very big town, and
 therefore hasn't got very many large  
 shops. Three of the largest shops are 
 the Co-op, William Low and Fine Fare. 
 All three offer a wide variety of     
{foods.}George Street is the most      
 popular street for shopping in.       
 Stranraer has nine clothing shops the 
 two most popular being Galls and      
 Skirt n' Slack. They both sell women's
 and children's clothing. There are    
 only a few men's clothing shops in    
 Stranraer.                            
  For greater choice and variety of    
 goods it is necessary to travel to{Ayr
 or{Glasgow.                           
  There are several shops which supply 
{agricultural goods}to cater for the   
 large farming community.              
  There are plenty of cafes and snack  
 bars in the town, of which, the Ivy   
 Leaf is the most popular.             </content>
