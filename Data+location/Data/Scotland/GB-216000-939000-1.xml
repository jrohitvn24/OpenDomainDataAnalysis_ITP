		<content> This area has a short coastline with  
 some islands. The main road in n.w.   
 Scotland passes through the area. The 
 Eddrachills Hotel is situated beside  
 the road. The hotel provides full time
 work for 3 people in the winter and 6 
 in summer. Hotel visitors mostly come 
 for the fishing. The mobile library   
 visits the hotel once a fortnight.    
 Salmon fish cages are located on the  
 coast and the nets are hung on tall   
 poles to dry and repair. The          
 landscape is predominantly wet and    
 boggy with many inland lakes. There   
 were some sheep and a derelict farm on
 the coast apart from the hotel there  
 are no other houses. There is a nature
 reserve surrounding a lake near the   
 coastline: unusually for this area,   
 the reserve has deciduous trees. The  
 old single track road has been        
 replaced by a new 2 track road inland </content>
