		<content>                                       
 The area lies east of Rutherglen and  
 extends as far as the Rotten Calder   
 which is a left bank tributary of the 
 River Clyde,which flows westwards,and 
 passes approximately one kilometre to 
 the north of our block. To the south  
 lies the New Town of East Kilbride.   
 The greater part of our area is       
 farmland ,largely dairying.Sheep      
 rearing to is practised on a small    
 scale. Some cereal cultivation takes  
 place on a small scale on favoured    
 slopes,but cultivated grassland       
 predominates on account of altitude   
   There is a residential area in the  
 northwest corner of the block,which   
 can be divided into two sections      
 according to occupation and income
