		<content>  Mrs. Bain is our gym. teacher. Her   
 house is a very large{Victorian       
{mansion,}and has a large garden with  
 fields attached. The house has 13     
 rooms, 4 of which are bedrooms, but   
 she would like a second bathroom. To  
 heat her house, Mrs. Bain has two coal
 fires, oil central heating and a      
 Raeburn. She does not like the        
 situation, because the house faces on 
 to the road. She would like it to     
 face the river. Mrs. MacLean has a    
 150 yr. old{converted terraced        
{cottage.}It has 4 bedrooms, a         
 kitchen/dining room, a bathroom and a 
 living room. The house is heated by   
 gas central heating and a wood-burning
 stove. It has a small back            
 garden/patio and faces East/West. Mrs.
 MacLean doesn't like the situation as 
  proximity to the park makes it noisy.
