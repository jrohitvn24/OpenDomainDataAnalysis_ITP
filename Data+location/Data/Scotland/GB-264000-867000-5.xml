		<content> Before the rapid expansion of Alness  
 the Doctor's surgery consisted of a   
 converted house,but as the population 
 of the town increased so did the need 
 for a larger surgery.To relieve the   
 problem The Robertson Health Centre   
 was opened in 1978.The centre has     
 seven general practitioners,one       
 trainee doctor,two nurses and two     
 health visitors.Every week the surgery
 holds a pre-natal clinic.Maternity    
 facilities are available in Dingwall  
 and Inverness.                        
  A dental surgery is included in the  
 building where there is one dentist   
 who treats a large number of patients.
 Outwith the Health Centre there is    
 another dentist in the High Street    
 situated beside an Opticians.         
 For animal health in the area, there  
 is a vet in the High Street as well.
