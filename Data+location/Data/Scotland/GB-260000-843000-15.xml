		<title>15CHILDRENS GAMES</title>
		<content>    At home, we have different games,{}
 the most popular of these being the{  
{computer.}Eleven of the thirteen      
 pupils in our school have home        
 computers. The favourite computer game
 is called 'Felix in the               
 Factory' (Felix gets chased by the    
 Gremlins) and 'Hunchback' (where the  
 Hunchback has to rescue Esmerelda).   
 Some people have programs to help them
 with their maths.                     
    Indoor games like{Lego, board      
{games, cars}and{dolls}are popular.    
    Most people have{bicycles}and we   
 spend a lot of time playing on these. 
 We also play on{go-carts}down the     
 school hill. They are made out of wood
 and old pram wheels. Some people play 
 'Cops and Robbers.' When the robbers  
 have been caught, they become the cops
 and the game starts again.
