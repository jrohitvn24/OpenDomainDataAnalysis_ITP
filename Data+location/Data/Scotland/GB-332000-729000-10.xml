		<title>10DUNDEE - TECHNOLOGY PARK</title>
		<content>  In 1983 George Younger, Secretary of 
 State for Scotland, gave permission   
 for a technology park to be built     
 beside {INVERGOWRIE.                  
  This area was created an Enterprise  
 Zone in 1984.The advantages of this   
 are that companies are exempt from    
 rates till 1994, although water rates 
 must still be paid.They also have     
 allowances on taxes and generally do  
 not need planning permission to build,
 or alter, a building.The government   
 requires fewer forms to be filled     
 in.Companies receive grants for new   
 machinery and buildings,creating      
 jobs,new starts and expansions.       
  The Scottish Development Agency      
 acquired this land and began the      
 difficult task of trying to attract   
 companies from all over the world to  
 the site. The area was good fertile   
 land but it met all the criteria set. </content>
