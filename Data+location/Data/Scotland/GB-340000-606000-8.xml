		<title>08TRANSPORT AT COMMONSIDE</title>
		<content> THE PEOPLE OF COMMONSIDE RELY SOLELY  
 ON THE ROADS AS THEIR MEANS OF TRAVEL 
 THROUGH THE AREA. THE A7 TRUNK ROAD   
 RUNS THROUGH THE BLOCK, WITH TWO MINOR
 ROADS LEAVING THIS. THE BUS SERVICE   
 FROM EDINBURGH-CARLISLE RUNS SIX TIMES
 DAILY ON THE A7 TAKING THE            
 COMMONSIDERS TO THE NEAREST TOWN OF   
 HAWICK FOR THEIR BASIC NEEDS. THESE   
 ROADS RUN IN THE SOUTH-EASTERN CORNER 
 OF THE AREA SO LEAVING THE            
 NORTH-WESTERN AREA COMPLETELY         
 ROADLESS. MOST OF THE PEOPLE RELY ON  
 CARS FOR TRANSPORTATION SO THAT THEY  
 CAN GET AROUND AT THEIR CONVENIENCE.  
 SOME OF THE CARS ARE NOW RUN ON DIESEL
 LIKE THE TRACTORS AND LANDROVERS. A   
 FEW PEOPLE STILL RELY ON HORSES TO    
 TRANSPORT THEM OVER THE FIELDS TO     
 CHECK LIVESTOCK BUT MANY NOW OWN      
 THREE-WHEELED MOTOR BIKES TO TRANSPORT
 THEM OVER HILLY GROUND.               </content>
