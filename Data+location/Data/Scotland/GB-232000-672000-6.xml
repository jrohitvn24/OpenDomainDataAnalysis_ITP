		<title>06RECREATION</title>
		<content> The provision of{leisure}facilities   
 varies according to age. For the 5_11 
 age group there are playgroups and    
{playschemes}although they are         
 insufficient in numbers.              
    The teenage element of the         
 community is severely neglected.      
 Community Centres provide discos as   
 well as sporting facilities, but there
 is no large sports centre, the nearest
 being in Greenock. For many teenagers 
 there is little to do, and boredom can
 set in.                               
    Adults being old enough to take    
 alcohol have hotels, pubs and clubs   
 for{recreation}but this is about all. 
 The elderly are catered for mainly by 
{churches}and other religious          
 organisations. The scope for          
 recreation is not enough. There       
 should be a review of the recreation  
 system and vast improvements made.s   </content>
