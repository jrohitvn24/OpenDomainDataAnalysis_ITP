		<content>{ Causey Mounth}is the road through    
 Banchory-Devenick going{south}from the
 banks of the Dee . It climbs from     
 Aberdeen up Tollowhill to the Banchory
 - Devenick Crossroads then past Causey
 -port Farm towards the new dual-      
 carriageway, the A92 to Stonehaven.   
 This was the original route from the  
 time of the earliest settlements. By  
 this roadway are{standing stones and a
{burial circle from the Bronze Age.}The
{Romans}travelled on this to &amp;         
 from their camp at Culter. Between    
 the Crossroads &amp; Causeyport Farm a    
{causeway}was built crossing Haremoss  
 bog. This area has since been drained 
 but the road is still elevated. At the
 farm a{port or gate charged a toll}to 
 road users. Traffic increase and the  
 route's limitations caused a new      
{turnpike road}to be laid from Aberdeen
 to Stonehaven which{opened in 1785.   </content>
