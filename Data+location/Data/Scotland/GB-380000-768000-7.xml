 prepare to go out in his van selling  
 fish. The first thing he does is pack 
 the fish into the van. On the van he  
 sells mostly{haddock}and in the summer
 he sells a lot of{herring.}He also    
 sells cooking fat and fishdressing.On 
 Tuesday and Wednesday he travels to   
 Fife and on Thursday and Friday he    
 travels to Perthshire. On average he  
 travels 150 miles each day. Even      
 during the most inclement weather Mr. 
 Ingram still goes out. Mr. Ingram     
 started this job because he got a     
 chance of a van and he has been doing 
 this job for 18 years. The thing he   
 likes best about his job is the       
 travelling. Mr. Ingram gets back about
 7.00pm and when he returns he washes  
 the trays and van.
