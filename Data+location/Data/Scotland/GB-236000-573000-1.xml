		<title>01Nature Reserve in Cree Wood</title>
		<content> The Valley of the River Cree runs     
 along the East side of the block.  A  
 steep rise takes the Wood out to open 
 moorland which covers about two thirds
 of the area.  Cree Wood is a bird     
 reservation maintained by the Royal   
 Society for the Preservation of Birds.
 This old deciduous wood contains      
 mainly Oaks, Ash and Birch, densely   
 covered, heavy with lichen, but clear 
 of undergrowth.  It has been well     
 cropped and managed for many years.   
 Few timbers exceed 80cm circumference.
 There is major growth from stumps.    
 Sparsely populated farming community.
