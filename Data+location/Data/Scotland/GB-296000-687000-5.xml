		<content> CHANGING LANDSCAPE                    
 A lot of the farms in our area have   
 changed from dairy farms to complete  
 arable farms. The reason for this is  
 mainly cost. It apparently  is        
 expensive to comply with all the      
 standard for dairying and machinery   
 needed for milking is very costly.    
 Dairying is also very time consuming  
 for the farmer. Our area grows mostly 
 winter or spring barley and a new crop
 to the area called oil seed rape has  
 been introduced within the last two   
 years. The growth of this crop has    
 doubled in Fife in the last year. This
 adds a lovely splash of yellow colour 
 over the area in May/June. Some beef  
 cattle are kept but mostly cows with  
 suckling calves. The calves are       
 fattened and sent to be slaughtered.
