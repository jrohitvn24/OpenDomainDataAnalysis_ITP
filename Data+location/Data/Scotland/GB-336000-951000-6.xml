		<title>06The Fitness Trail</title>
		<content> Along by the riverside of Wick is a   
 fifteen obstacle fitness trail donated
 by the Trustees Savings Bank. A lot of
 the obstacles are easy, but a few are 
 quite difficult, so instruction boards
 have been put up for fitness freaks   
 who don't know what to do.            
 The trail has proved popular in Wick, 
 being used by groups such as Scouts   
 and fitness clubs, or just the odd    
 passer by with nothing to do.         
 It is built for everyone. If one is   
 not feeling fit enough for monkey     
 bars, one could maybe try something of
 an easier taste such as stepping      
 through tyres.                        
 The trail has also been armed with    
 benches for the exhausted athlete or  
 the person who loves to sit and watch 
 other people being energetic.         
 The Wick fitness trail is very much   
 appreciated by all age groups.        </content>
