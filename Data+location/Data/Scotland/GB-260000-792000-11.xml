		<title>11Medical Care for Laggan</title>
		<content> The practice of the Laggan Doctor must
 be,in area, one of the largest in the 
 National Health Service. The nearest  
 hospital is Raigmore at Inverness 60  
 miles away.The nearest ambulance is in
 Kingussie 12 miles distant. The doctor
 has his surgery at home, having 9     
 surgery sessions per week. In a day of
 house calls he can travel distances of
 over 270km. In winter his practice    
 becomes an outpost hospital when road 
 conditions prevent travel to hospital.
 We must travel 12 miles to Kingussie  
 for prescriptions. When there is no   
 transport, medicines are sent by      
 post. In urgent cases the doctor will 
 have a supply of small drugs at the   
 surgery. The Dentist's surgery is in  
 Kingussie. From Newtonmore we have the
 service of a district nurse, health   
 visitor and chiropodist. An optician  
 from Inverness attends once a month.  </content>
