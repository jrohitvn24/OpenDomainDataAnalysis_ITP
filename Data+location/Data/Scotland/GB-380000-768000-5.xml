		<title>05Fishing From Gourdon</title>
		<content> The fishing population of the village 
 has become greatly reduced especially 
 with the discovery of oil in the{North
{Sea,}many of the male population      
 now working in oil related            
 industries.In Gourdon there are 4     
{trawlers}sailing out from the harbour 
 at the moment. The most popular       
 fishing however is{creel fishing      
 because there are 12 of these boats   
 but there are some of those which go  
 to both creel fishing and{line        
{fishing.}Line fishing is using hooks  
 and a thin rope which is held down by 
 weights. Only one boat goes{prawn     
{fishing}at the present time and there 
 are only 2{seine net boats.           
 Gourdon is a{tidal harbour}which means
 the tide goes out and in twice a day. 
 This affects the fishermen who have to
 wait for high tide and sail at all    
 different times of the day and night. </content>
