		<title>19RIVER AND COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content>    Dyce is surrounded to the north by 
 countryside and to the south by the   
 City of Aberdeen.                     
    The land is used intensively for   
 agriculture and the main products of  
 it are crops such as {barley, oil seed
{rape and dairy produce}. There are    
 also a number of{pig rearing units}in 
 the area.                             
    The {River Don}flows through the   
 area and forms the eastern and        
 northern boundaries to the town       
 itself. It is a large river and flows 
 past the town in a large meander loop.
    Dyce is now truly a suburb of      
 Aberdeen and{pressure on the          
{countryside for building space is ever
{increasing.}Until only a few years ago
 the site of our school was good       
 agricultural land.
