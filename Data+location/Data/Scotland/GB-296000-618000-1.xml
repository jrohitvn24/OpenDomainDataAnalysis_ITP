Crawford is mainly used for the farming
of hill sheep.There are several farms  
in the area.The main farms being       
Whelphill,Stoneyburn and Midlock.      
Stoneyburn and Midlock straddle more   
than one block.We will therefore only

Most of the land is used for rough     
grazing.

area which are tributaries of the

is the Camps Reservoir which supplies  
water to the towns in the industrial   
belt of Lanarkshire.
