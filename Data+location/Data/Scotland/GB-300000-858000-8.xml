		<title>08POPULATION FORRES WEST</title>
		<content> Population of this area is divided    
 between the town  of Forres and the   
 rural areas.  The people either live  
 on housing estates in town or on      
 farms.  In {isolated areas}where      
 farming is an {essential}- part of    
 making a living.  In our area the     
 three main housing estates are {      
{Pilmuir, Thornhill }and {Burdshaugh.} 
 In the {rural areas}there are two main
 villages called {Broom of Moy}and  {  
{Kintesssack.}There are ten farms and  
 stately houses.  The population in {  
{urban}and{rural}areas around Forres is
 forever increasing.  The main reason  
 for this is because of a{ Royal Air   
{Force Station}at{Kinloss}whose        
 occupants sometimes move to Forres to 
 buy privately owned houses. Another   
 reason is on the coast of the Moray   
 Firth there lies an oil rig making    
 company.                              </content>
