		<title>17GIANT HOGWEED West Forres</title>
		<content> Along the banks of the River Findhorn 
 and on waste ground Giant Hogweed is  
 increasingly becoming a problem.It is 
 a tall coarse herb which grows up to  
 two metres high.It has a              
 grooved,hairy,hollow stem and if the  
 stem is broken it releases a white    
 juice which,if is in contact with skin
 it causes a very bad burn.It can leave
 some skins sensitive to strong        
 sunlight and a recurrent rash.Hogweed 
 is becoming increasingly difficult to 
 eradicate.It is not listed under the  
 Weed Act.The seeds are washed down    
 river but riparian landowners are not 
 permitted to use weed-killer in case  
 this causes pollution.Unless all      
 landowners help tackle the problem in 
 the same year the seeds will continue 
 to disperse and the problem will      
 escalate.
