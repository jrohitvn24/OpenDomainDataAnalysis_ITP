		<content> There are ten lorries at Bannatyne's  
 Four go to the mainland three times a 
 week. The lorries can carry up to     
 twenty tons. The lorries bring        
 fertiliser, animal feed, building     
 material, spirits, food for the Co-op 
 and coal from the mainland. The       
 lorries take cheese, livestock and    
 cobbles to the mainland. They go to   
 England only on special furniture     
 removals. There are six lorries which 
 stay on the island. There are four    
 mechanics who work at the garage. They
 service other people's cars as well as
 their own. In the winter they sell    
 about 700gallons of petrol a week and 
 in the summer 1200-1800 depending on  
 the tourists. They always have cars   
 available to rent. There are 18 people
 working at the garage. They have 7    
 different kinds of lorries. It costs  
 Â£4000 a month for ferry charges.      </content>
