		<content> Mr Brown of Kirkpatrick Durham has a  
 peat business. He cuts the peat about 
 20 miles away from the village at a   
 place called Glenshimeroch. It is cut 
 by a machine that runs off a tractor. 
 There is a sort of dredger at the back
 of the machine. It goes down into the 
 peat. The peat is then taken up and   
 dumped in a sort of compressor. It is 
 then squashed out through tubes at the
 back. When the sun dries it up it     
 cracks into separate pieces.          
 People are then employed for the      
 summer to bag it. They are usually    
 children but sometimes grans and      
 grampas come to help. They get 10p a  
 bag. Mr Brown and two men that are    
 employed full time then go round      
 villages and towns in a lorry and sell
 the peat.
