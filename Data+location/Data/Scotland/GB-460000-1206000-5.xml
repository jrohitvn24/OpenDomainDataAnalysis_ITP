		<content>{Pilots:}the Airport employs 6 pilots. 
 They have three planes,a Dash 7 and 2 
 Twin Otters. The Dash 7 flies from    
 Aberdeen to Unst. It has 50           
 seats,weighs 4400 pounds, and carries 
 9900 pounds of fuel.It can't carry any
 more unless on a ferry flight when you
 can put a fuel tank where the         
 passengers normally sit. Pilots can be
 trained with the Air Force,or         
 Privately or in the the State School  
 of Flying.The pilots enjoy their job. 
{Customs and Excise:}they check for    
 drink, drugs and firearms being taken 
 in and out to and from the rigs. They 
 handle about 50 to 300 bags a day of  
 workers going to and from 3 oil fields
 - Ninian North, Central and South. All
 the searching is done by hand as they 
 have no sophisticated X-ray equipment.
