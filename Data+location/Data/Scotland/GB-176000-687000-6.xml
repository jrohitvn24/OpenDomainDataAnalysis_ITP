		<content> Building of Inverlussa Manse.When the 
 fishermen from Achnamara landed in    
 Ireland they stole some slates from a 
 monastery to put on the Manse         
 roof.When the Irish priest discovered 
 they were to be used for a Scottish   
 Manse it is said that he cursed the   
 building.                             
 Stone Bridge,Achnamara.On the shore of
 Loch Sween between the road bridge and
 the loch at the south side of the     
 village,is the very old clapper       
 bridge.It is said that when this      
 bridge was built,local people who     
 would not attend church were punished 
 by having to help build the bridge. It
 is formed of two slabs 13'3" and 10'5"
 supported on 3 piers.
