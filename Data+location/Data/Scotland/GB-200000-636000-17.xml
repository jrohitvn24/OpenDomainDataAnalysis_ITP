		<title>17HOTELS IN BRODICK</title>
		<content>   Hotels and boarding houses line the 
 main shore road and vary in size and  
 standard as one would expect.         
   Many school children's parents are  
 involved in the hotel business since  
 they either own, run or work in hotels
 during the holiday season.            
   The busiest time is from Easter     
 until September.  Schools presently   
 amass local holidays together to have 
 2 weeks holiday in October to         
 accommodate those who take their      
 holidays when the tourist trade       
 declines.                             
   The larger hotels can accommodate   
 about 60 people and are open to       
 non-residents since the short journey 
 from the mainland encourages day      
 trippers.  Cold stores, several giant 
 freezers and storerooms are common    
 though provisions do come weekly from 
 the mainland.                         </content>
