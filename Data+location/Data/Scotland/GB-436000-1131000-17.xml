		<content>      MANY FACILITIES IN BRIDGE END    
 HAVE DISAPPEARED IN THE LAST 10 OR 20 
 YEARS.AT ONE TIME THERE WERE 4 SHOPS  
 AND NOW THERE IS ONLY ONE.THE POST    
 OFFICE HAS BEEN CLOSED AS WELL AS THE 
 SCHOOL AND BRANCH LIBRARY.MUCH OF THIS
 HAS BEEN A RESULT OF THE BRIDGES      
 LINKING BURRA TO THE MAINLAND.THE     
 SCHOOL WAS CLOSED WHEN THE LAST       
 TEACHER RETIRED AND THE CHILDREN WERE 
 MOVED TO HAMNAVOE.THERE WERE 18       
 CHILDREN AT THE SCHOOL THEN AND NOW   
 THERE ARE OVER 40 WHO TRAVEL DAILY TO 
 HAMNAVOE.                             
      WITH AN INCREASE IN POPULATION,  
 THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN HOUSING,
 A SMALL COUNCIL ESTATE WITH SHELTERED 
 HOUSING AS PART OF IT AND A NUMBER OF 
 PRIVATE HOUSES. OTHER NEW FACILITIES  
 ARE A PLAYPARK AND A BUS SHELTER AS   
 WELL AS AN EXTENSION TO THE HALL. THE 
 SCHOOL IS NOW AN OUTDOOR CENTRE.      </content>
