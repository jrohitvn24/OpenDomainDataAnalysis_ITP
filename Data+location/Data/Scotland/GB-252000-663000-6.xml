		<title>06SOCIAL CONCERNS IN GOVAN</title>
		<content>   There have been expressions of      
 concern in the area about{racial}     
{conflict.}It is said that coloured    
 shop owners in particular are subject 
 to burglaries and harassment. One     
 asian shop assistant lost an eye in an
 apparently motiveless knife attack.   
 The problem about using racism to     
 explain this is that other shops are  
 also burgled and robbed. Perhaps the  
 high level of unemployment in the area
 is a clearer root cause of crime. the 
 whole community suffers. One further  
 concern is that different groups      
 within the community, tend to arrive  
 at different explanations for the     
 problems they experience.             
   There is evidence of anti-asian,    
 anti- catholic, anti-protestant,not to
 mention anti-social behaviour. There  
 is also a strong{community spirit;}the
 will to live in harmony must survive. </content>
