		<title>04MILTON AREA UNEMPLOYMENT.</title>
		<content> Industry near Milton has changed.Farms
 were mechanised,mills closed and 'Big 
 Hooses'like Balfour House,providers of
 many jobs,employed fewer workers. Our 
 block became a{coal mining}area,but   
 paper and whisky industries provided  
 jobs.By 1967 only 2 big pits existed, 
 on the River Forth.One closed in 1984 
 and the other is now smaller.Linoleum 
 factories in Kirkcaldy and engineering
 firms in Leven shut down.Haig(whisky) 
 Markinch closed in 1983.{Unemployment}
 is now very high.People{travel}to work
 at various jobs_firms like Cameron    
 distillery(1822),Cameron Hospital-1911
 and paper mills in Glenrothes(oldest  
 1806),but Kirkcaldy District and Fife 
 Regional Councils are the largest     
 employers.Electronic and other        
 factories in Glenrothes,the oil jacket
 yard at Methil and the new whisky     
 bottling plant at Leven provide jobs. </content>
