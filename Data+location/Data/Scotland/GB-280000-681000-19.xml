		<content> In 1147, David I founded St.Mary's    
 Abbey at Cambuskenneth, Stirling. A   
 document said that the Chapel of      
 Dunipace had to pay money to the      
 Abbey. The famous Crusaders, the      
{Knights Templar,}did not have a house 
 in Denny but they owned land which is 
 still known as Temple Denny. They are 
 said to have had a sanctuary where    
 people in trouble with the law could  
 be safe. "Go to Denny" is an          
 expression still in use and is thought
 to refer to this sanctuary. In the    
 13th century,{William Wallace}was     
 educated by his uncle, a priest, at   
 Dunipace. Later he attacked Airth     
 Castle to free that uncle who was a   
 prisoner there. Wallace and{Bruce}had 
 a meeting at Dunipace. After Bruce    
 died his body was taken to Dunfermline
 for burial. The procession stayed a   
 night at Dunipace.                    </content>
