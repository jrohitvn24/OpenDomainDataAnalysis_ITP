		<title>17A DAY IN MY LIFE IN PENICUIK</title>
		<content>              MONDAY                   
 On Monday I get up around 7.30 a.m.   
 and get dressed.  I get my bag and    
 guitar and around 8 o'clock I call for
 Keith.  At 10 past 8 we go to school. 
 When we arrive we put the milk in the 
 classrooms and put out the computers. 
 At 9 o'clock school begins.  At 10.45 
 a.m. we have a break for 15 minutes.  
 At 11 o'clock I go to guitar lessons. 
 At 12.30p.m. I go home for lunch and  
 at 12.50 p.m. I call for Keith.  At   
 12.55 p.m. we go back to school and   
 collect the milk.  We are back in     
 school from 1.30 until 3.15 p.m. when 
 I go home.  I haver a drink and watch 
 television until tea time.  At 6.45   
 p.m. I go swimming until 9 o'clock.   
 Then I get my supper and take it to my
 room.  I watch 'The Young Ones' and   
 eat my supper.  At 10 o'clock I go to 
 sleep.                                </content>
