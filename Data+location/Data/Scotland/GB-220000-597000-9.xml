		<title>09Inside Penkill Castle</title>
		<content>  Although the castle is fairly small, 
 it has many rooms.Inside is a         
 Banqueting Hall,Kitchen,Pantry,many   
 bedrooms and a spiral staircase.The   
 East Wing contains the Banqueting Hall
 which is fairly large and the kitchen.
 The Pantry is facing north because in 
 those days there were no fridges and  
 the North wind kept the food          
 fresh.                                
  Many of the rooms have beautiful     
 paintings, many by the Pre_ Raphelites
 who used the castle as a retreat at   
 the end of the century.               
  There is a spiral staircase in the   
 tower with a long painting,"The king's
 Quair", depicting James VI.           
  the "Curse of Penkill" room is so    
 called because there is a picture on  
 one wall with a curse above which     
 reads"Move Not This Picture,Let It Be;
 For Love Of Those In Effigy"          </content>
