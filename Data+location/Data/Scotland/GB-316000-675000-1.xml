 We know most about the part of our D  
 block which is east of the River      
 Almond. This is the heavily populated 
 residential suburb of Edinburgh which 
 has grown up around the old seaside   
 village of Cramond. People like to    
 live in Cramond because of the        
 quietness and beauty of the Almond    
 River, of the Firth of Forth and of   
 the green belt areas in the north west
 of the city. People come to Cramond   
 for the opportunities for recreation  
 and leisure,to visit the historical   
 sites,to enjoy the wildlife and to    
 follow the shore and river walks.     
 More than half of Cramond D block is  
 the Dalmeny Estate, home of the Earl  
 of Rosebery. Except for the Army Camp 
 at Craigiehall this area is sparsely  
 populated.
