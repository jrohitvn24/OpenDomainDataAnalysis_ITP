		<title>01ACHNAIRN BY LOCH SHIN</title>
		<content>  This block is dominated by Loch Shin 
 and by an area of rough common grazing
 with some small Forestry Commission   
 coniferous plantations, rising gently 
 from the Lochside. There are only a   
 few houses, predominantly in square 12
 (Achnairn) and squares 2/3 (Shinness  
 Lodge). There is one main road passing
 through the block from Lairg to       
 Scourie on the west coast and one     
 minor road,, but apart from these,    
 only tracks. The majority of the      
 population have at least some crofting
 interests keeping sheep and cattle,   
 growing potatoes and making hay for   
 winter feed. However, many supplement 
 their incomes through bed and         
 breakfast ir renting out houses in the
 summer to tourists and there is also a
 camping and caravan site in square 12.
 These supplementary sources of income 
 and other employment opportunities    </content>
