     Each year in early July, as part  
 of Annan's{Riding of the Marches      
 Celebrations, the Hole in the Hedge   
 Ceremony is re_enacted.               
     A small boy, between 5 and 10, has
 to climb through a hole in a hedge,   
 near to a house where tradition       
 states, that centuries before a small 
 boy, looking through a hole in a hedge
 spotted the English approaching on a  
 raid. He was able to warn the adults  
 nearby and thus save the local people 
 being taken by surprise.              
     For centuries raiding parties from
 both the English and the Scottish     
 farmers have crossed the border to    
 steal each other's cattle, and this   
 ceremony commemorates this part of the
 area's{turbulant history.
