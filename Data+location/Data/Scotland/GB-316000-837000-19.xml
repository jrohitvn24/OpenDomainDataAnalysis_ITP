		<title>19FORESTRY IN BALLINDALLOCH</title>
		<content> Some of the higher slopes of our area 
 are used for forestry. Most of the    
 trees grown are conifers,because of   
 their faster growth.They are therefore
 called softwoods. However, some       
 hardwoods are also grown,each tree to 
 start with inside a plastic tube,     
 which promotes growth rather as a     
 greenhouse does.                      
  There are also some Research areas   
 for forestry experiments.             
  The foresters must protect the trees 
 from diseases,from deer and rabbits   
 which damage the young trees, and from
 fungi which may kill the trees.       
  The lowest part of the tree is       
 generally used for building materials,
 the next part for boxes and pallets,  
 the next for chipboard, and the top   
 section for paper.
