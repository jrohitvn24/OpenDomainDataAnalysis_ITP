		<content> The rivers farmland and woods of the  
 area provide habitat for many types of
 animals. There is one known family of 
 Badgers resident in the area. Foxes   
 travel in and out of the area , a fair
 estimate would be 4 at any given time.
 Red Squirrels inhabit the woods the   
 expanding population of Grey Squirrels
 has not reached this area yet.        
 There are about 4 Ror Deer but like   
 the foxes others come and go.         
 Mink,which originally escaped from a  
 Mink farm are a nuisance along the    
 rivers because they kill water birds. 
 The Eckford Gamekeeper destroyed 27 in
 1984,27 in 1985,14 in 1986 and        
 estimate that 6 remain.               
 The countryside sustains average      
 numbers of weasels,stoats,moles,      
 rabbits and hedgehogs and small       
 rodents.
