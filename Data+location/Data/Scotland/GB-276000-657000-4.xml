		<title>04INDUSTRY IN THE LOCAL AREA</title>
		<content>  The major employer in the local area 
 is the British Steel Corporation's    
 Ravenscraig plant.  stretching over a 
 large area, the Ravenscraig is a fully
 efficient steel plant.  Using coal    
 from Scottish pits and iron or from   
 England, the Ravenscraig produces     
 large quantities of high grade,       
 light_weight steel.  There has been a 
 history of steel making in the local  
 area.  At the present time, there is a
 great political debate about th future
 of Ravenscraig, especially after this 
 week's decision that Gartcosh strip   
 mill is to  close.                    
  New, smaller industries have been    
 introduced into the local area due to 
 the work done by the Scottish         
 Development Agency who help them by   
 giving them loans and grants etc.
