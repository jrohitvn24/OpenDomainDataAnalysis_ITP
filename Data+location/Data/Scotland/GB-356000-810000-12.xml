 Grampian Region Library Service send  
 us books to choose from each term.    
{SCHOOL SWIMMING}                      
 Each week our senior class visits     
 Alford Academy for swimming lessons.  
 At the end of each year we sit        
 distance and survival tests.          
{SKIING}                               
 During winter some senior children    
 visit the Lecht Ski slopes for        
 lessons.                              
 Due to small numbers and age ranges   
 the children have difficulty          
 participating in team sports.         
{SCOTTISH COUNTRY DANCING}             
 The school team is made up from girls 
 in Pr.3 - Pr.7.  Despite the          
 differences in age the girls did      
 extremely well in the North East      
 of Scotland Music Festival this year. 
 Kilts are worn at the Festival.       </content>
