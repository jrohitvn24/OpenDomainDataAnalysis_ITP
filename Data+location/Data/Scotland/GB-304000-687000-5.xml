		<content> Some of our girls in our class        
 interviewed the children at Carnock   
 School and Milesmark School to find   
 the favourite food of children.       
 We found that the most popular food in
 Carnock was salad.And the most popular
 food in Milesmark  School are crisps  
 and pizzas .                          
 We found in Carnock School that quiet 
 a lot of people ate apples but at     
 Milesmark School hardly anybody ate   
 fruit at Carnock School 40 children   
 stay for School dinners and           
 packlunches where as at Milesmark     
 School only 20 people stay for School 
 dinners and and 8 for packlunches.    
 The popular thing the children ate was
 crisps out of Milesmark and Carnock   
 School. My favourite food is salad ,  
 crisps and beans.
