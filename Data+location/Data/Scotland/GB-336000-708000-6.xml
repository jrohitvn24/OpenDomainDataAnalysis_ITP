		<title>06CRAIGROTHIE AND CHANCE INN</title>
		<content> The hamlet of Craigrothie has a pub   
 and a school.  There used to be a shop
 in the pub building but it closed     
 years ago. Daily papers are collected 
 from Ceres by one of the villagers who
 then sells them. There are several    
 newly built houses and modernised     
 houses and cottages. There are also   
 some Local Authority houses most of   
 which have been bought by the         
 tenants.Craigrothie is in a           
 conservation ares which makes new     
 building very difficult. The hamlet   
 will not grow much which means that   
 the school roll is falling.Some       
 building is going on in Chance Inn.
