		<title>18FARMING AROUND GLAMIS</title>
		<content>    As with the topography , the       
 farming around Glamis can be divided  
 into two types.                       
                                       
    1) The rich farmlands, worked in   
 large holdings, in the Strath.  This  
 is intensively managed, growing grass 
 for grazing and for hay and silage,   
 winter and spring sown barley, wheat, 
 potatoes, some peas, and recently oil 
 seed rape.  The rape crop in spring   
 adds a striking new colour to the     
 landscape.  The main stock is imported
 breeds of cattle - mainly Limousin and
 Charolais - kept for both breeding and
 fattening, and some of these are prize
 winning animals at local and national 
 shows.  This land is worked by farm   
 labourers.  It gives the impression   
 that there are no poor farmers.
