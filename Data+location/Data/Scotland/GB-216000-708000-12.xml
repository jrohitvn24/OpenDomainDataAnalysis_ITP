		<content>  Cairndow is a part of the area that  
 is covered by the mini head quarters  
 at Inveraray.There are two other      
 places that are covered and they are  
 Minard and Furnace.They answer        
 complaints and attend to              
 accidents,firearm certificates and    
 sheepdipping.They do sheep dipping    
 because people say that if the sheep  
 are not dipped properly they might    
 die.Our constable is a district       
 officer and he goes to rural districts
 like Cairndow or Inveraray.He covers  
 about 38 miles and that stretches from
 Birdfield to Lochgoilhead and Carrick 
 Castle and 5 miles up the Dalmally    
 road.He doesn't have a beat like a    
 city policeman.He does occurrence work
 like sudden deaths,road               
 accidents,fires and cars getting      
 broken into.
