		<content>  The burn then narrows again and the  
 water once more becomes cloudy. The   
 amount of weeds increases as does the 
 slime. There is also a distinct smell 
 of{rotten eggs}where the burn is      
 joined by a tributaary which flows    
 from{GARTLAND MAINS.}                 
  Some of the sources which contribute 
 to the pollution were, the discharge  
 from sewage works at Lochans village; 
 the dumping of rubbish on the banks;  
 farm drainage{e.g. silage and manure  
{effluent;}field drainage; stagnant    
 water entering the burn. This suggests
 that as the burn continues the amount 
 of pollution increases.               
  This is demonstrated by the clouding 
 water, and the addition of a foul     
 smell as the burn leaves the area. The
 only sign of litter however was in the
 village.
