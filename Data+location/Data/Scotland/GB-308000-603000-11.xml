   In the wooded area at Barnhill and  
 Beechwood Roe and Fallow Deer have    
 been spotted.Toads and Frogs can be   
 seen in almost every pond in the area.
 Weasels and Stoats are attracted into 
 the area by birds eggs which they eat 
 in Summer.Foxes are attracted by      
 Mice,Voles,Shrews and Rabbits.        
   It can be seen that the survey area 
 contains a wide variety of habitats   
 for plants and animals.Local          
 naturalists and ornithologists are    
 however disturbed by the number of    
 habitats which are vanishing from the 
 area.Commercial forestry,land         
 improvement and drainage schemes are  
 seen to be responsible.Happily,a      
 number of bodies including Forestry   
 groups,youth organisations and the    
 Wildlife Club are joining to preserve 
 some of the more traditional habitats.</content>
