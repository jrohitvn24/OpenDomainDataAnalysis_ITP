		<content> The Provost enjoys visiting Youth     
 Groups, Organisations and Receptions  
 and goes everywhere he is asked as he 
 regards this as an honour.  He has    
 only been Provost for 2-3 months and  
 already has ambitions for Clydebank's 
 Centenary Year in 1986.  He hopes that
 Queen Elizabeth II and her husband,   
 Prince Philip, will visit Clydebank   
 and sail in the Britannia to Rothesay 
 Docks since the Britannia was built in
 Clydebank.                            
 Provost Grainger spends approximately 
 50 hours each week working as Provost 
 and has the use of the Provost's Chain
 which is worth about Â£16000.
