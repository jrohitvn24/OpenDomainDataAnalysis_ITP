		<title>02DOUNBY AGRICULTURAL SHOW</title>
		<content> The{Dounby Show}is one of the main    
 events that happens in our area. It is
 held in August at the Show Park. At   
 the Show all kinds of things happen.  
 People from the West Mainland come to 
 show off their{cattle, sheep and      
{other animals.}There are also tractors
 and farm implements on display.       
 There are sideshows and stalls where  
 you can win or buy things such as     
 chips, candy floss, sugary doughrings 
 and melons. There is also a beer tent 
 where most people crowd on a hot day. 
 At night there is a parade when       
 trailers and floats go round with     
 people on them dressed up in funny    
 clothes. There is a prize for the     
 best or funniest one.                 
 There is a happy atmosphere at the    
 Show and I would recommend it to      
 anyone.                               
                                       </content>
