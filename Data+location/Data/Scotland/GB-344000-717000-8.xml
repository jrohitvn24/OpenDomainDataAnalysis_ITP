		<content> The main area studied was the shore of
 the Eden estuary.Here the mud flats   
 exposed at low tide are a prime source
 of food for many migrants and local   
 wading birds.The population, both     
 types and numbers, varies with the    
 seasons and when we visited the area  
 it was a quiet time. Even so there    
 were numbers of Eider duck, who       
 occasionally nest here; pairs of      
 Shelduck ready to move off into the   
 country side to nest a pair of mute   
 swans who are the local residents; and
 flocks of Dunlin feeding on the mud   
 flats. Herons are frequently seen     
 fishing at the mouth of the estuary.  
 Rabbits and hares were also spotted.
