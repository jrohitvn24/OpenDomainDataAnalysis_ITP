 The transport on Canna consists of 2  
 landrovers, 2 tractors and 1 van. The 
 roads on Canna are private so vehicles
 do not need to have tax or M.O.T.     
 Canna is connected to the mainland by 
 a passenger ferry called the Lochmor  
 which sails from Mallaig run by       
 Caledonian Macbraynes.                
 This ferry runs 4 times a week in the 
 winter and 5 times a week in the      
 summer because then the ferry comes   
 twice on a Saturday. As well as being 
 the only means of transport on and off
 the island the ferry is very important
 to the community because it brings the
 post and food ordered from shops in   
 Mallaig or further afield.            
 Islanders have to pay freight         
 according to weight on items carried  
 on the ferry.                         </content>
