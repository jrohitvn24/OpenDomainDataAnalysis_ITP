		<content>  From the amount of traffic travelling
 to and from the Lochans; it appears   
 that there were many more going to{   
{STRANRAER}than going to the Lochans.  
  The reason for this could be that    
 many housewives were going to         
 Stranraer to do there weekly shopping.
 The majority were local with only one 
 car being a tourist on the second     
 census.                               
  However, on the first census there   
 were a notable number of tourists     
 going in the direction of{PORTPATRICK.
 There seems to be very few cars owned 
 in the Lochans than expected. This    
 can be accounted for, as within an    
 hour 5 taxis passed going to the      
 Lochans and then taking their         
 passengers on to Stranraer.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
