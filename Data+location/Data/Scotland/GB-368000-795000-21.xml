Smart board-our class has a big board that is connected to the computer that you can write on or touch to make something happen. If you turn it on with a remote it will come on the same as the computer but if you want to have it on without everyone else seeing what you are doing on the computer then you can press the freeze button on the remote.&lt;br />&lt;br />Traffic Lights-traffic lights are when everyone has a card pocket on a piece of card. Everyone starts with a green card and if you get in trouble you go on orange/amber and if you do something again or you do something really bad the first time you go on red.   &lt;br />
