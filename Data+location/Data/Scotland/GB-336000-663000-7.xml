 AT THE MOMENT IN PATHHEAD WHICH NOW   
 HAS A POPULATION OF 900 THERE ARE ONLY
 7 SHOPS. A BAKER, A GROCER AND WINE   
 MERCHANT, A MINI SUPERMARKET, A       
 NEWSAGENT, A GENERAL STORE PLUS POST  
 OFFICE AND A FISH AND CHIP SHOP.THERE 
 IS ONLY ONE PUBLIC HOUSE AND A HOTEL  
 SITUATED JUST NORTH OF THE VILLAGE.   
 THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY TRADESMEN     
 RESIDENT IN THE VILLAGE. SEVERAL      
 BUILDINGS WHICH WERE USED AS SHOPS    
 HAVE NOW BEEN CONVERTED INTO HOUSES.  
 MOST FAMILIES GO TO THE LARGE STORES  
 IN DALKEITH OR VISIT THE LARGE        
 SUPERSTORES IN EDINBURGH ONCE A MONTH 
 TO STOCK UP WITH PROVISIONS. THE LOCAL
 SHOPS ARE NOW USED MOSTLY FOR         
 PERISHABLE GOODS.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
