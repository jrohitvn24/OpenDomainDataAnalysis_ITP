		<title>04FARMING INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> Five farms in the area were surveyed  
 as a sample - Shielhill, Craighill,   
 North Powrie, Whitewalls and Moatmill.
 The largest is Shielhill with 210     
 hectares but this does not include 36 
 hectares owned by this farm on the    
 Sidlaws for summer grazing and land   
 which lay off the surveyed block.     
 The average farm size is around 100   
 hectares. All are mixed farms with    
 emphasis on grain. A special          
 commercial venture is the{PIGGERY}at  
 Muir of Pert using part of the disused
 airfield.{CHICKEN}rearing is also done
 on part of the airfield. There are a  
 number of{SMALLHOLDINGS}in the area.  
 This was land bought by the Government
 in the 1930's and leased to local     
 people to help employment. They are   
 now too small to be economically      
 worked. Some have been amalgamated -  
 others used for building.             </content>
