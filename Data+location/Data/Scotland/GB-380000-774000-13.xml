		<content>  The{Church}is a popular tourist      
 attraction. The visitors' book reveals
 visitors have come from many parts of 
 the world. Parts of the Church date   
 back to the early thirteenth century. 
 In an earlier Priest's room James     
 Sibbald, Vicar of Arbuthnott, wrote   
 the famous{Missal of Arbuthnott,}now  
 in the Art Gallery and Museum at      
 Paisley.  Unfortunately, a fire in    
 1890 destroyed some of the earlier    
 buildings.  The Church is now in good 
 repair and used for Church of Scotland
 services.{Lewis Grassic Gibbon}(James 
 Leslie Mitchell), auther of Sunset    
 Song is buried in the churchyard.     
 Bloomfield, on the Riesk Road, where  
 he lived as a child, is just out of   
 our block.  Beside the{River Bervie,  
 near the Church, is a popular pic-nic 
 spot, and at Easter numerous eggs have
 been rolled.                          </content>
