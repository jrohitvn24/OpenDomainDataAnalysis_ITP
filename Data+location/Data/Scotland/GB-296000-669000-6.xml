		<content>    Bathgate houses a fair amount of   
 leisure and recreation facilities.    
 There is a swimming pool, a B.M.X.    
 track, a bingo hall, a running track, 
 a community centre, discotheque,      
 various adventure parks, a snooker    
 hall, video arcades, tennis courts and
 a cinema.                             
      The swimming pool is an old      
 building, recently renovated.   It is 
 an attractive building with a brown   
 and red exterior.   The interior is in
 blue, white and brown tiles.   It has 
 a deep end of approx. 3metres, a      
 length of 25metres and breadth of 6   
 metres.   It used to have a diving    
 board but it hasn't any more.   It    
 costs 22p. to get in, for half an     
 hour.                                 
    The B.M.X. track in Bathgate is the
 main one in West Lothian, where many  
 championships are held.               </content>
