		<title>04     FARMING continued</title>
		<content>   All farms were very well mechanised 
 and consequently very few workers were
 employed per farm. This would have    
 been 8 to 10 times more 50 years ago. 
 In all 17 workers were employed.      
   All the farmers had been in the area
 for many years with an average of     
 almost 50 years. The shortest being 14
 years and the longest 140 years.      
 Needless to say they all said that    
 they liked living in the area and only
 a few expressed any desire for        
 changes. These included better        
 shopping and market facilities and    
 more work in the area.
