    The variety of{wildlife}around     
 Blackridge is good because around     
 there are moors, woods and open       
 spaces.                               
  There is a good variety of birds such
 as Coal tits, Blue tits, Coots and    
 Chiffchaffs.                          
   The {burn}that runs by Blackridge   
 has hardly any wildlife because of    
 pollution.  The wildlife in and around
 Blackridge is decreasing because      
 people keep killing them.             
   Some people have a collecion of     
 birds eggs.  This is making the{bird  
{population}in Blackridge decrease.    
 The bird population is also           
 decreasing because their{habitat}is   
 being destroyed by people cutting down
 trees and by pollution.
