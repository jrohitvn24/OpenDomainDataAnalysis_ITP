		<content> Our area is surrounded by fairly      
 steep_sided hills with the mountains  
 of the Highlands towering above us to 
 the north.It is a rather wet,but      
 generally mild area with an average   
 annual rainfall of 1416mm with most   
 falling in October.The maximum        
 temperature so far this year has been 
 23.5'C recorded on June 2nd and the   
 minimum of _11'C in January.Leaving   
 the village green,we ascend the hill  
 and soon pass through wooded areas in 
 which there is a greater percentage of
 deciduous trees than conifers with the
 main species being beech,sycamore,    
 silver birch and ash, in the shade of 
 which grow bluebells and ferns in     
 profusion. Higher still, we come to   
 rough grazing pastures with the       
 occasional cluster of oak trees.From  
 here,one can look down upon the       
 Gareloch and the Firth of Clyde.      </content>
