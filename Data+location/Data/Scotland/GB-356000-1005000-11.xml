		<title>11FARMING IN DEERNESS (2)</title>
		<content>{Dairy}farming though less popular than
 beef production nevertheless provides 
 a steady monthly income. Good ground  
 with an all grass policy and 1 tonne  
 of concentrate per cow per year yields
 an average 4000 to 4500 litres per    
 cow. The{grazing season}lasts from May
 to October. In winter the cows are    
 housed inside a double tied cowshed   
 with round the shed milk pipeline. The
 main winter feed is silage together   
 with concentrates. Milk is stored in a
 refrigerated bulk tank and is         
 collected by Milk Marketing Board     
 tanker and taken to the cheese making 
 factory at{Kirkwall.}Pasteurised milk 
 is sold at the retail shop. Since lst 
 April 1984 milk production has been   
 controlled by{quotas}through          
 legislation introduced by the European
 Parliament.
