		<title>11GEOGRAPHY OF KINNEFF AREA</title>
		<content> In the{Kinneff area}there are 9 farms.
 The crops are mainly grass ,wheat     
 ,barley and potatoes. In one field    
 there is flax. One of the farmers has 
 been subsidised to grow flax as an    
 experiment. If the flax is a success, 
 they will grow a larger quantity next 
 year. At{Todhead}the cliffs are very  
 steep and dangerous.They are inhabited
 by seabirds such as seagulls ,        
 cormorants and wild ducks. Seals can  
 sometimes be seen in the{North Sea.   
 Todhead was named from the name (tod) 
 _a fox. Foxes used to be and still are
 in this vicinity. Hares,rabbits and   
 other wild creatures can be seen. Near
 the coast are the ruins and sites of  
{ancient castles}reminding us of the   
 past. The  main coastal road south ,  
 carrying heavy traffic ,passes through
 the village of Kinneff.
