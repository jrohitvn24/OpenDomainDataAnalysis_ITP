		<title>16Adult Recreation in E/Calder</title>
		<content>  There are few sports in East Calder  
 except bowling and football. We have  
 to travel to other places.We swim in  
 Livingston and Broxburn,play golf in  
 Whitburn,Livingston and Pumpherston,  
 and football in Edinburgh.            
   There are very few clubs in East    
 Calder.We travel to Livingston for    
 chess and Mid Calder for keep fit.    
 There is going to be a sewing club    
 soon. We already have Young Wives and 
 Woman's Guild.There are two bowling   
 clubs. We also have a pigeon club in  
 Oakbank which is open every night.    
 People take homing pigeons and swap   
 them or talk about them.              
  Some people would like more to       
 do in East Calder.Suggestions are a   
 chess club,yoga,cinema,theatre and    
 music groups.One adult thinks that    
 people here are apathetic about       
 organising activities for themselves. </content>
