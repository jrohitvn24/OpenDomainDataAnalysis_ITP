 the area.It comes from Elgin and goes 
 to Aberdeen.The railway crosses the   
 River Spey 7km south of Fochabers.The 
 nearest station is Elgin (about 12km).

 B9015 which connects Mosstodloch and  
 Rothes.                               
  The farms used to be crofts but were 
 consolidated to form larger farms.    
 Varied crops are grown including oats,
 hay and barley.Sheep are grazed on the
