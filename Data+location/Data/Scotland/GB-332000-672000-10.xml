		<content> There are five primary schools        
 (Pinkie, Burgh, Campie,         ).    
 Loretto is a private fee-paying school
 with pupils from different parts of   
 the world. Musselburgh Grammar School 
 is the local comprehensive school with
 about 1100 pupils.  This school is    
 built upon a Roman camp site.  The    
 grammar school was founded in 1660 and
 was at that time a school for boys    
 only.  It is said that Sir Walter     
 Scott was one of its famous former    
 pupils.
