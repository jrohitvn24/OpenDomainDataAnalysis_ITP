		<title>18NAIRN:FARMERS FIELD</title>
		<content>    Fairly close to the centre of the  
 town is a large area of open space    
 which is grassed over.It is owned by  
 the local farmers and annually is the 
 site for the{agricultural show}which  
 is a small version of the type to be  
 found throughout Britain.             
    The field is in constant use during
 the summer for many other events such 
 as{vintage car rallies, sheepdog      
{trials, }and fetes. It has an all year
 use as a traing ground for sports such
 as football.                          
    It is only within the last         
 generation that the field has found   
 itself in a central position since    
 the housing to the south and west is  
 postwar. Without it Nairn would appear
 far less open to its detriment.       
    Other areas of open space occur    
 around large houses such as Newton (a 
 hotel) and Viewfield (council offices)</content>
