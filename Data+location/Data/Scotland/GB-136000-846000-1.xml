		<content> Predominantely peat moorland with a   
 small part of forestry encoaching on  
 the part. The Loch is fairly large and
 the source of the Riva Tora, used by  
 nesting birds and the geese fly here  
 for the night. Area used for rough    
 grazing for the sheep. Also widely    
 heather covered.                      
 No habitation, but extensively used by
 local inhabitants for cutting peats,  
 which are dried and used for winter   
 fuel. The visible track was made just 
 for the carts to bring down the peats.
 Apart from the local crofters, we are 
 probably the only people to visit this
 area from a leisure point of view. The
 walk to the top of Ben Roishader is   
 very worthwhile.
