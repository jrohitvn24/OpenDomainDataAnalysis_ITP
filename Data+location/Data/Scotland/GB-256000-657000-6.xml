		<content> What is a{jeely piece}?It's a Scottish
 expression for bread and jam : a cheap
 snack for kids!                       
                                       
 So what's a{Jeely Piece Club}? Well   
 it's a{playscheme}unique to{Castlemilk
                                       
 It was started in the mid seventies by
 a group of mums to give their own kids
 something to do and to provide a baby 
 sitting facility for working mums     
                                       
 Originally they had a struggle to get 
 facilities but their persistance has  
 meant that they now run{4 clubs}and a{
{resource centre}                      
                                       
 Although they now have an{urban aid}  
 grant the mums still run the clubs    
 themselves. They are open all year,{  
{8.30am}to{10pm}for all ages (including
 a creche)                             </content>
