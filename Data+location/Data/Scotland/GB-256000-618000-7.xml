		<title>07POLICEWORK IN CUMNOCK (2)</title>
		<content>    There is quite a lot of paper work 
 to be done.  Sometimes it varies from 
 1 hour to 4 hours depending how       
 important the enquiry is.Policemen    
 can meet all kinds of people from a   
 road sweeper to a managing director.  
 They have to visit houses, factories, 
 schools and offices in the course of  
 their work. The policeman who was     
 interviewed said he had become a      
 policeman because of security, pay and
 career prospects. He also said the    
 most unpleasant thing he had to do was
 dealing with children who have been   
 killed. But he recommended the police 
 force as a career because of the job  
 security and the satisfaction of      
 working with the public.  Candidates  
 for the police force must possess 4   
 O'grade passes in the SCE and if male 
 must be 5'9" tall or 5'4" if female.
