		<content> The hangars and other buildings on an 
 old airfield are used for storage,    
 factories and retail stores.          
 Factories include metal works,        
 sawmill, joinery and bakery. Some     
 contract others to do some work for   
 them e.g. "Badgers" screen print bags 
 for a bag factory.                    
 Most of the aircraft hangars are used 
 for storing chemicals, alcohol and    
 E.E.C. surplus grain. other smaller   
 stores include meat, and materials for
 a new Telecom line. Shops sell mostly 
 household goods.                      
 The old runway is used for testing    
 vehicles like fire engines etc. It is 
 also used by learner drivers, and for 
 pigeon racing and flying model planes.
