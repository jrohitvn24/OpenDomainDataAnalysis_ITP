		<title>14GUIDE DOGS IN FORFAR</title>
		<content> I am proud to live in Forfar as it has
 the only{Guide Dog}Training Centre in 
 Scotland.It is situated on the Dundee 
 Road and was opened in 1965 by        
 Princess Alexandra.                   
 You can usually see the trainers      
 working the dogs in the Forfar        
 streets.They are mostly Labrador      
 puppies but you can see Alsatians too.
 The trainers put up barriers on the   
 pavements to teach the dogs to go     
 round them before they get on the busy
 streets.The Centre does not like      
 guided tours in the evening because of
 the excitement and barking.To train a 
 dog needs patience.A high-spirited dog
 will fail the training.After training,
 the dog is matched up with its{blind} 
 owner who stays at the Centre to get  
 used to the animal.Some people run in 
 marathons or shake collection tins to 
 raise money for the Guide Dogs.Do you?</content>
