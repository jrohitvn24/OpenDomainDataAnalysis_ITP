 At the present time most Primary      
 Education is based on a thematic      
 system. Once a theme is decided upon  
 for the class to study eg local       
 environment the teacher must ensur    
 that the children,through the theme   
 cover several areas of the curriculum.
 With in the theme children will uses  
 many research skills to find out about
 their environment such as map         
 skills,interviewing,reporting,mathemat
 ical analysis. These skills are of    
 great interest to the children as they
 are learnt for a particular purpose ie
 their thematic study. By the end of a 
 school year all aspects of the        
 curriculum                            
 eg.maths,science,language,geography,hi
 story,physical education,drama and art
 should have been covered at the childs
 ability and through the theme.        </content>
