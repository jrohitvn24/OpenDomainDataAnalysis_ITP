 it is assisted by Strathclyde Regional
 Council and the Government. Although  
 money is restricted Clydebank supports
 one of the largest community pro-     
 grammes in Scotland.The {ENTERPRISE

 has had beneficial effects for

 swimming baths.Most entrances fees are
 at juvenile rates.There are no council
 travel concessions.
