 in Dyce - {1. ASDA SHOPPING CENTRE    
{           2. VICTORIA STREET}        
 We did a survey to find out why people
 used each of these.

{1. ASDA -}many people from Dyce and   
    from other towns shop at Asda. Most
    people said they liked shopping in 
    the super-store because the prices 
    were reasonable and the staff were 
    friendly. 72% of people we         
    interviewed agreed about these     
    points. Most people liked shopping 
    there because you can buy all of   
    your main needs in one place. The  
    Asda shopping centre also contains 
    smaller shops such as a chemists, a
    fish shop, travel agent and a      
    record shop.{
