		<content> MOST OF THE STUDY BLOCK IS LESS THAN  
 46METRES ABOVE SEA LEVEL.THE BLOCK IS 
 DOMINATED BY GENTLE SLOPES EXCEPT FOR 
 WHERE THE "DEAD"CLIFFLINE TURNS       
 PARALLEL TO THE SHORE AND ALSO ALONG  
 THE LOWER REACHES OF THE              
 GOLLACHY,BUCKIE,AND RATHVEN           
 BURNS.WHICHHAVE GORGE FEATURES.THE    
 FREUCHING BURN ALSO HAD A DEEP STEEP  
 SIDED STRETCH OF VALLEY BUT THIS HAS  
 RECENTLY BEEN FILLED BY THE LOCAL     
 AUTHORITY AND THE NEW SURFACE LAID OUT
 AS GRASS AND PATHS.THE SHORELINE HAS  
 BEEN MUCH MODIFIED BY MAN AS A RESULT 
 OF HARBOUR DEVELOPMENT AND COASTAL    
 PROTECTION WORKS.THERE ARE SMALL      
 SECTIONS OF SHINGLE BEACH BUT THE     
 SHORELINE IS MAINLY ROCKY WITH A FINE 
 WAVE CUT PLATFORM.EVIDENT AT LOW TIDE 
 BETWEEN BUCKPOOL AND PORTGORDON.
