		<content>    In 1941 Cardross was bombed by     
 German bombers. On one night 400      
 explosive and 2000 incendiary bombs   
 were dropped on this tiny village. One
 of the buildings that was worst hit   
 was the old Parish Church. Lots of    
 Cardross people tried to put out the  
 fires. One bomb came through the roof 
 and fell behind the organ; nobody     
 could get at it. As the flames went   
 through the organ pipes, great        
 whooshing noises were heard. The      
 church was destroyed and now only a   
 ruin remains as a reminder of that    
 night. The rest of the village was    
 badly bombed , the golf club house was
 destroyed, even the animals in the    
 fields were slaughtered. The most     
 probable theory on the bombing is that
 Cardross was mistaken for Bowling,    
 where there were large petrol storage 
 tanks.                                </content>
