		<title>16PEATS FOR FUEL IN SANDWICK</title>
		<content>   Here I am lying in the peat basket  
 about to be burned. I can remember    
 when I was back at home in the peat   
 bank. "Oh, that was the life!" We     
 heard a rumble of wheels and knew that
 the people had come to dig us up.     
   The spade like instrument used is   
 called a 'tushkar'.After we have been 
 "cassen" or cut we have to be         
 raised, turned and put in bags.       
 Raising is when we get set on edge in 
 small piles to dry. When we get turned
 we go through the whole process again.
 A week or two later the people come   
 back again and put us into bags. The  
 bags are stacked into the trailer and 
 the tractor takes us to the house.    
 There we are built into a stack from  
 where we are taken into the house in a
 basket ready to be burned.            
                                       
                                       </content>
