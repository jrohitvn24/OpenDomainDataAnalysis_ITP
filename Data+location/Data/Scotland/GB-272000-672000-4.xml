		<title>04TRANSPORT AROUND CUMBERNAULD</title>
		<content> Due to its position midway between {  
{Glasgow}and{Stirling, Cumbernauld }was
 well placed on the main communications
 link from west to east.               
 Road links were opened in the 18th    
 century and extended south to{Airdrie}
 and on to{Carlisle.                   
 The {Forth and Clyde canal}runs close 
 to the town and once helped its       
 industry by giving access to both     
 coasts.                               
 The opening of the{railways}spelt the 
 end of the canal and coach service but
 the town was well placed to take      
 advantage of the easier communications
 offered.                              
 The choice of{Cumbernauld }as a centre
 for a {New Town}owed much to this ease
 of {Communication,}and the growth of  
 the town since 1956 has been rapid and
 continuous.                           
                                       </content>
