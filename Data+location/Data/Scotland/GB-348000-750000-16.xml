		<title>16QUARRYING IN RESTENNETH</title>
		<content> Fledmyre quarry along with Lochhead   
 quarry is the main {industry}in the   
 area.  Fledmyre quarry begun 5 years  
 ago and has worked 7 acres.  When it  
 was surveyed they predicted a {mining 
{life}of 25-30 years producing 400-500 
 tons per day but to date they often   
 produce in excess of this so it is    
 uncertain if it will last the alloted 
 time.  The {quarry's procedure}is that
 the black top soil is skimmed of the  
 surface to reach the sand and kept for
 later infilling.  Large diggers are   
 used to extract the sand to a legal   
 limit of 2 metres above the water     
 table so as not to pollute the water. 
 The sand is filtered with the biggest 
 stones being removed and the rest are 
 crushed and made into gravel of       
 varying sizes.  The{sand and gravel}  
 produced goes mainly to the building  
 trade and road construction.          </content>
