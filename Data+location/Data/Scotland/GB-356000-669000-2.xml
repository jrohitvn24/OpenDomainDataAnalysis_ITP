		<title>02Garvald Weather</title>
		<content> In East Lothian, Garvald is reputed to
 be a remote village frequently cut off
 by winter snows. Infact it lies so    
 near the east end of the Lammermuirs  
 that the total precipitation is under 
 20" and drought is as common a problem
 as too much rain or snow.  Much of the
 year the weather is sunny but the     
 valley in which the village lies faces
 south west and the prevailing west    
 wind tends to hurtle down. However the
 easterlies are colder and bring the   
 dreaded haar, usually for three days  
 at a stretch and make the chimneys    
 smoke.  The village is in a frost     
 pocket and can be white whilst the    
 surrounding fields are green and      
 sunny.  l985 has been very            
 exceptionally wet and sunless.
