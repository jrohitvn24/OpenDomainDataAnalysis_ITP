		<title>18Gamekeeping In Dundrennan</title>
		<content> The gamekeeper is a busy man. He      
 works every month of the year.In      
 February he catches up the hen        
 pheasants to put in a pen to lay the  
 eggs,which will be put into the big   
 incubator. The eggs are usually in the
 incubator for a week and a half, then 
 they are put into hatchers for the    
 other half of the week.               
   When the  young are hatched they are
 put under an electric hen which is a  
 heater that keeps them warm.          
   At 9 weeks old  they go to the woods
 to be reared. By then the gamekeeper  
 should have fox snares and traps set  
 for foxes, stoats, weasles, and mink. 
 At three and a half months old they   
 are released into  the woods to be    
 shot.By then the gamekeeper is sorting
 things out for the next year.
