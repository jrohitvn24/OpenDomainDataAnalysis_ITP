		<title>11ATTITUDES in HOUSTON</title>
		<content> Since Houston consists of an old area 
 and many new housing areas,the        
 community is a varied one.In new      
 estates like Craigends, the population
 is mainly young, often newly married  
 couples who have rising incomes,      
 children of primary school age        
 and a need for many services.         
 This contrasts with the older more    
 traditional population of the old     
 village. New building in the          
 conservation area is restricted so    
 there is less influx of 'incomers'.   
 There may be some resentment among    
 older people about rapid change, but  
 this is offset by hope of improved    
 services and by some revitalization in
 the area. The matters of local concern
 differ according to age,needs and     
 location in the area. There is a      
 thriving community council and parent 
 teacher association .                 </content>
