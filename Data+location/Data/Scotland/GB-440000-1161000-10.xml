		<title>10The Beach in Voe.</title>
		<content> Voe is teeming with wildlife.The      
 hills,burn,fields,sea and beach all   
 provide ideal habitats for many       
 creatures.                            
 The beach in Voe is a pebbly and stony
 one.It is an ideal place for a walk as
 there is so much to see.              
 The beach itself is littered with an  
 assortment of shells;periwinkles,     
 razor shells,mussels etc.Many kinds   
 of seaweed can also be found.         
 Sandhoppers and sea slaters swarm     
 under the rocks. Flowers such as the  
 tormentils and violets grow on the    
 grassy bank above the beach.          
 Binoculars would give a close up view 
 of the many coastline birds which can 
 be spotted from the beach.            
 Just off from the beach are three     
 mussel rafts.
