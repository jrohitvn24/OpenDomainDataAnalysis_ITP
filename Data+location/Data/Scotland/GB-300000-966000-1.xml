		<content> The block touches the sea at its NW   
 corner and undulates its way to its   
 southern edge where it starts to climb
 towards the hills in the next block.  
 It is cut from east to west by the    
 main north coast road and it is       
 dominated in the NE corner by the     
 river Forss, one of the most important
 salmon rivers in the area and the     
 Forss House estate containing two     
 disused mills and the post office for 
 the area.  The land is utilised for   
 silage and pasture except in the      
 central to western squares where it is
 enclosed but uncultivated and used for
 rough grazing, mostly sheep.  In the  
 intensively cultivated land the       
 grazing is dairy and sheep and almost 
 all of the dwellings in the area are  
 farms, most of the exceptions being   
 long since abandoned and derelict     
 shells, built in local quarried stone.</content>
