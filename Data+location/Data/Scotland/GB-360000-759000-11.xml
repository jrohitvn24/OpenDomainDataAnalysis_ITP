		<title>11Brechin In The 1980's-1</title>
		<content> I like Brechin because it is a quiet  
 place and there is not much violence  
 or trouble.There are not many big     
 lorries which come through the Town   
 because there was a By-Pass built a   
 few years ago. Lorries only come into 
 Brechin when they are delivering to   
 the Supermarkets.                     
    I think there could be more        
 interesting things to do.We do not    
 have a Leisure Centre,only a Community
 Centre.we have to travel 7 Miles to   
 the nearest Swimming Pool which is not
 very convenient.                      
    There are quite good shops in      
 Brechin but I like going to Dundee to 
 get a better choice of clothing.We    
 have one good Department Store.There  
 is one really expensive Clothes Shop  
 in Brechin called Rags.It costs       
 between Â£50 to Â£100 for a jumper but  
 they really are beautiful.            </content>
