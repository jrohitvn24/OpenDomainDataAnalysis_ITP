		<content> Weekly rehearsals continue through the
 winter months in preparation for the  
 annual production of the{opera}which  
 runs for one week and attracts large  
 crowds from all over the Borders and  
 beyond.At present there are between   
 forty and fifty keen amateur members  
 from Innerleithen and district and the
 standard of singing is exceptionally  
 high.The conductor and musical        
 director is Mr Jack Waldie,who is also
 organist and choir master at the local
 parish church.                        
 If necessary as in last years Carousel
 the members' children also take the   
 stage,and there is a very experienced 
 stage crew who think nothing of       
 extending the stage in the Memorial   
 Hall.Beginning in 1909  with Gilbert  
 and Sullivan the choice has been wide 
 from The Desert Song to The Dancing   
 Years from The King and I to Oklahoma.</content>
