		<content>    {Hairmyres }is situated in the out 
 skirts of East Kilbride on the road to
 Eaglesham. The hospital was built     
 during the war by the Polish prisoners
 of war.There are 21 wards with about  
 15 to 30 patients in each ward.       
 Expectant mothers can no longer go to 
  Hairmyres due to the closure of the  
  maternity unit.Also,very young       
  children must be transferred to other
  hospitals as there are no            
  paediatricians.                      
  I interviewed an ambulanceman from   
 Hairmyres hospital.He said that it was
 a very pleasant place to work.They    
 work a day shift, a night shift and a 
 backshift.He works 8 hours a day.They 
 have 32 ambulance drivers in an       
 ambulance depot.The busiest shift is  
 weekend backshift.They are trained not
 to think that it is their fault when  
 someone dies in their ambulance.      </content>
