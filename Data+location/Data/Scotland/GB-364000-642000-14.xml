		<title>14THE PARK IN GORDON.</title>
		<content> The park is situated near the         
 crossroads on the  Kelso road.You     
 drive up to the gates and you park on 
 the grass.There aren't any new        
 facilties coming to the park. There   
 are swings and a shoot, tennis and a  
 bowling club.You can hire bowls for a 
 day.You cannot hire tennis equipment. 
 There might be a new park going to be 
 built behind the school field.This    
 is a better place for at the moment   
 children have to cross the main road. 
 A councillor says that there might be 
 a football pitch going to be built.We 
 have been  down to the park three     
 different days doing a survey. No one 
 came, we think this is because it is  
 badly situated.
