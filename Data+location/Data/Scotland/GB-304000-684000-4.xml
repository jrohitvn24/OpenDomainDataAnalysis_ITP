		<title>04CROMBIE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>    There are now less than 200 people 
 living in this village which was      
 mainly built to provide housing for   
 workers at the nearby ammunition      
 depot. This depot supplies the Rosyth 
 Naval Dockyard, and the village's     
 fortunes are closely linked with those
 of the Dockyard. Many of the houses   
 are now empty, but the remainder are  
 tidy and well kept. There is one      
 general store, owned by a Pakistani, a
 working men's club, and a small school
 with only 23 pupils. (See page 7)     
    A religious meeting hall, on the   
 eastern outskirts of the village, has 
 recently closed, and 3 new private    
 houses have been built adjacent to it.
 The main road from the Forth to the   
 Kincardine Bridges, by-passes Crombie 
 with no speed restrictions, but the   
 children of the village have two small
 parks which keep them off the road.   </content>
