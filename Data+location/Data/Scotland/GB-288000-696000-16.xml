		<title>16THE FAMOUS ALVA BAND</title>
		<content> There has been a{Brass Band}in Alva   
 since about 1880,but the present band 
 was formed in 1910. About 30{musicians
 now play in the band. They don't all  
 live in Alva,but travel from places   
 like Crieff and Dunfermline because   
 the band is good.                     
  All the instruments are very         
 expensive. The Tuba costs Â£3,200,a    
 Trombone costs over Â£1,000. They raise
 money by coffee mornings,prize draws, 
 public appeals and sponsors. The band 
 plays at{events}like gala days,       
 concerts,services and contests. If a  
 band is 1st or 2nd in the Scottish    
 Championships,it goes to play in      
 London. The Alva band has been 7 times
 since 1973. John Hudson of{Foden's    
{band (Preston)}is its new musical     
 director.
