		<content> The reduction of the labour force     
 required on farms due to mechanisation
 and the closure of a large boot and   
 shoe factory in Maybole has led to a  
 movement of labour away from the area.
 This reduction in population has led  
 to the closure of many village shops. 
 A scheme of Council houses has been   
 built with water,electricity,coal     
 fires and indoor sanitation.Almost    
 every home has a television set,some  
 have two.The quality of life is much  
 improved.Mothers are working outwith  
 the home and can afford to purchase   
 labour-saving appliances.Elderly      
 residents,living alone,receive "meals 
 on wheels" from Ayr.The manse has been
 sold as the minister has joint charge 
 of Crosshill and Dalrymple where he   
 resides.Police house is unoccupied.   
 Head teacher does not live in village.
 Many residents have cars,some have 2. </content>
