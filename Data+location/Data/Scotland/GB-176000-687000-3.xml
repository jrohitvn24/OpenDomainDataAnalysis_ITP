		<content>  The farm is 170 years old,approx 100 
 acres,all beef cattle.The farmer has  
 lived there since he was born.There   
 are 26 beasts all Charolais and 12    
 calves are born each year.Breeding    
 cows are kept till 8 years old.They   
 are bought and sold mainly in Stirling
 or privately to farmers or cattle     
 dealers.Each is worth Â£300-600.They   
 are pure bred but not yet pedigree.   
                                       
 Cattle graze out in summer.In winter  
 they are indoors  ,fed twice daily on 
 home grown hay and silage supplemented
 with barley.Two tractors are          
 kept to work machinery,most of which  
 are for production of silage for      
 winter feeding.One grown animal eats  
 50 kilos of silage per day.The family 
 work the farm with evening help from  
 two village boys.
