		<content> Durness is surrounded by moorland,    
 mountains and sea cliffs. There are   
 many beaches in Durness most of which 
 are sandy.                            
 Durness sits on limestone rock which  
 gives unusually fertile soil for the  
 Highlands.                            
 There are no rivers in Durness, just  
 two burns, Sango burn and Allt Smoo   
 which flows into Smoo Cave before     
 reaching the sea at Geodha Smoo. The  
 cave is made up from three caverns,the
 outer one being immense.To get into   
 the others a boat is needed.There is a
 hole in the roof of the outer cave.The
 narrow inlet leading to the cave      
 provided a sheltered harbour for      
 fishermen.A ruined store house and    
 a rusty winch is all that remains of  
 this activity. There are a few other  
 smaller caves in the vicinity as well 
 as at Sangobeg sands.                 </content>
