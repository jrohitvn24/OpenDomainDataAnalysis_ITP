		<title>03SHOPPING CENTRES IN ERSKINE</title>
		<content> Ten years ago Erskine had only a few  
 shops but since then changes have been
 made.  A shopping centre had been     
 planned and on the 4th January, 1985, 
 Bridgewater Shopping Centre was       
 officially opened.  It is situated in 
 the centre of Erskine with two        
 connecting pedestrian bridges making  
 it easily accessible for shoppers from
 the different areas in Erskine.       
 A large area has been made into a car 
 park.  The first shops to open were a 
 large supermarket, a frozen food      
 shop, a newsagents and a shoe shop.  A
 new library has recently been opened. 
 There will be further developements to
 the main shopping centre with a       
 chemist and bank planned to open in   
 the near future.  Erskine has also got
 three smaller shopping areas.  Each   
 has a selection of shops that serve   
 the people in that particular area.   </content>
