		<title>16School Morning in Dumfries</title>
		<content> Every morning except Saturday and     
 Sunday I get up at 7.30 am to go to   
 school. I usually get there at 8.10   
 am. We play about until 9.00 am. I am 
 in Primary 7.                         
    My best friend is Paul Stakounis.  
 My teacher is Mrs.O'Donnell. Every    
 moning she takes in the lunch money.  
 Then we start off our Maths from a    
 text book which is called "Scottish   
 Primary Mathematics Group". Our       
 teacher has what she calls the "help!"
 table. It is always very busy. Nine   
 pupils have already finished this     
 book, which has 122 pages. Then we get
 our break from 10.35 to 10.50 am. Then
 we come in and do our English. We do a
 book called "Main Line English", also 
 Reading Laboratory and a selection of 
 other text books. At 12.30 we go to   
 lunch.
