		<content> This area is dominated by the small   
 settlement of Kinlochewe and the hilly
 area forms part of a national nature  
 reserve featuring rough heathery      
 hills, some parts of which have been  
 planted with coniferous trees. The    
 village of Kinlochewe has around 80   
 inhabitants and includes a primary    
 school with one teacher, a post       
 office, hotel, several food stores and
 2 petrol stations. There is a small   
 proportion of the inhabitants engaged 
 in seasonal employmenr, and permanent 
 employment comes from the estates,    
 nature conservancy council but        
 self-employment is the main means of  
 employment. The area has a number of  
 small crofts, mostly stocked and      
 grazed with sheep, and one sizeable   
 tenanted mixed farm.
