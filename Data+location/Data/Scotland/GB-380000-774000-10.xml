		<content> Formerly there was a Parish School    
 with 3 teachers in the 1920s.The      
 population declined, and the school   
 was closed in 1973, leaving the block{
{without any educational facilities.   
 Children in the west go to Redmyre    
 Primary School and then to Mearns     
 Academy, Laurencekirk. Those in the   
 east go to Inverbervie Primary School 
 and then to Mackie Academy,           
 Stonehaven. Although parents have a   
{choice of schools,}their choice is    
 subject to the availability of Council
 transport to the schools. From their  
 secondary schools the children have   
 the same opportunities for further    
 education as do any children. Tuition 
 in music and dancing (highland,       
 ballet, tap) is available privately in
 neighbouring areas. Pre-school        
 children can attend the{Playgroup}in  
 the Parish Hall two mornings a week.  </content>
