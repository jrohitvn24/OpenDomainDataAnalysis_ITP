		<content> The school has its own kitchen with a 
 cook and a server.  The dining room is
 also used for Music and Television.   
 As the school has no hall, it has the 
 use of the Games Hall at nearby       
 Melville House on a Thursday          
 afternoon.  During the summer months, 
 we play games on their huge playing   
 field and we also hold our sports     
 there.                                
 The school has an active              
 Parent-Teacher Association.  Some of  
 the members come into school to read  
 stories and help with Cycling         
 Proficiency training.                 
 The school chaplain visits on Friday  
 afternoons and conducts a short       
 assembly.
