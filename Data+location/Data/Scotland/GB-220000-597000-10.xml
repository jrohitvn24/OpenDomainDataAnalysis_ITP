		<title>10Grant's Distillery-Girvan</title>
		<content> Grant's produce both malt and blended 
 whisky, but as Girvan's distillery is 
 a lowland one the whisky all goes to  
 be blended with others.               
 It is one of the most automated       
 distilleries in Europe and employs    
 about 200 people  on an 84 acre site. 
 Girvan was chosen as the site for     
 Grant's new distillery in 1963        
 because:                              
  1.The water was of god quality       
  2.There were adequate road and rail  
 links                                 
  3.There was flat building land       
  4.Unemployment was high in Girvan    
                                       
 Now Girvan produces grain whisky at a 
 rate of 2,500,000 proof gallons per   
 year from maize imported from America.
