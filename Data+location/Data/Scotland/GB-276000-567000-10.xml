		<content> Chipperkyle is a large house, about   
 2 00 years old. It has about 40 rooms 
 and a large garden and courtyard. All 
 the rooms are still as they used to   
 be. Most of the rooms have paintings  
 or drawings in them.                  
 Everything that used to be in the     
 rooms is still there. There are still 
 even old dishes.                      
 The lady of the house is away just now
 and the house is being decorated and  
 central heating and eletricity being  
 put in.                               
 The house keeper cleans the house 3   
 days every week.                      
 The beds that are in the house are    
 from the Army. Her great grandfather  
 brought them back.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
