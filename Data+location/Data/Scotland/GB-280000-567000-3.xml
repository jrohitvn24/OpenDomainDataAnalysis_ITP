		<title>03Petition for change</title>
		<content> There is a problem in Springholm      
 because Regional Councillors have     
 refused to change the speed limit from
 40 mph to 30 mph. Mr Michael          
 Ancram,Minister of State at the       
 Scottish Office, has given his        
 approval to improve warning signs and 
 "series of bends" signs as well as to 
 the possibility of widening the       
 footpath.                             
 A petition was signed by nearly all   
 the villagers who wanted the speed    
 limit to be reduced. This was         
 supported by the police, the local    
 community council, the regional roads 
 and transportation committee and the  
 MP Mr Ian Lang, but unfortunately it  
 was not obtained. No adequate reason  
 was given. The nearby village of      
 Crocketford (also on the A75) has a   
 speed limit of 30 mph, so we would    
 like the same.                        </content>
