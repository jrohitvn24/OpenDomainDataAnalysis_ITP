		<content> Situated two hundred metres north of  
 Coldstream Farm Scottish Gas have a   
 Transmission Reduction Station.The gas
 comes from gas fields 120 miles N.W of
 St Fergus near Peterhead.It comes from
 these fields through welded steel high
 pressure pipelines to St Fergus and   
 hence through similar underground     
 pipelines through Scotland and down   
 into England.The pipelines carry gas  
 at very high pressure{(up to 70 bar). 
{    }At several points throughout     
 Scotland the pressure is reduced to   
  local internal pipelines.{(Which     
{operate at pressures up to 21 bar).}  
 This is the maximum pressure which our
 pipelines to the site named           
 Mountfleurie Transmission Reduction   
 Station operates and the equipment    
 there further reduces the pressure    
 such that it can be distributed into  
 the local grid system for Leven area  </content>
