 its beautiful sandy beach and places  
 of interest.It has a cinema and bingo 
 hall for the evenings and a  museum in
{Broughty Castle,}which lies by the    
 beach,for a rainy day,and swimming in 
 the Tay is perfect on a warm day.

 lying in pleasant grounds,and it is   
 open to the public,with a low

 large parks and open spaces,with      
 tennis courts,a bowling green,a       
 putting green,crazy golf and other    
 sports facilities.The pleasure
