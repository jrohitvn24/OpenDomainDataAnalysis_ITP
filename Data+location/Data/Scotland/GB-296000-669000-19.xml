		<content> Moles, hedgehogs, shrews: What have   
 they in common?                       
 They all eat insects such as spiders, 
 ants, slugs and worms.   They all have
 sharp teeth to eat their prey.        
 Rabbits, hares: Two of the family of  
 grazers, who are able to live in most 
 types of country.   Hares tend to live
 in more open surroundings while       
 rabbits are more adaptable, able to   
 find food and burrowing places almost 
 anywhere.   The rabbit needs roughly  
 0.5kg. of green food each day and     
 about 1/4 of its own body weight.     
 The farmers around this area of       
 Bathgate find that moles and rabbits  
 are a great problem.                  
 Foxes:These carnivorous animals are   
 alert and intelligent and most foxes  
 have adapted to living in towns and   
 parks because they often visit these  
 places to find food.                  </content>
