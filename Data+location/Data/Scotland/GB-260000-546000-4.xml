		<content> A public hall was erected in 1932 by  
 the efforts of the parishioners.  This
 hall is used by both the old and young
 in the community, for their many and  
 varied activities.  The Rural holds   
 its monthly meeting on the second     
 Tuesday of each month, and on the     
 first Tuesday the Guild holds its     
 meetings from October to Easter.  A   
 badminton club was reformed two       
 seasons ago and is now thriving with  
 thirty members.  They have one club   
 night a week, and one match night as  
 they are members of a league.         
 On a Tuesday afternoon, the Mothers   
 and Toddlers group meet in the hall.  
 The minister holds a youth club for   
 children between 12-18 years on       
 alternate Friday nights.  An indoor   
 bowling club also uses the hall.
