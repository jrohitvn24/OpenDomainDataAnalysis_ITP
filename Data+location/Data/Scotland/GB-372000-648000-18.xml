 THAT OF SEVERAL KINSMEN IN THE OPEN   
 VAULT WHICH CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A     
 GRILLE AT THE EAST END OF THE CHURCH  
 WHICH HAS A CROWNED ORANGE AT ITS     
 APEX. THIS WAS SIR PATRICK HUME'S     
 CREST WHICH HE FREQUENTLY HAD STAMPED 
 IN GOLD ON THE LEATHER BINDING OF HIS 
 BOOKS &amp; THAT HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED BY A 
 GRATEFUL SOVREIGN, HAVING BEEN        
 INSTRUMENTAL IN THE ACCESSION OF      
 WILLIAM OF ORANGE. ORIGINALLY THE     
 MANSE, WHICH WAS BUILT BY LORD        
 MARCHMONT WHEN HE BUILT HIS OWN HOUSE,
 WAS LIVED IN BY THE MINISTER.
