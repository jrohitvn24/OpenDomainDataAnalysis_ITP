		<content>  Though only a small town, Pitlochry  
 has five churches. Each church has a  
 regular congregation ranging from 50  
 in the Baptist church to 300 in the   
 Church of Scotland. Summer visitors   
 swell these numbers considerably,     
 particularly the Catholic church with 
 something like a 400% increase.       
  Females, over thirty, form the main  
 congregation, though this can also    
 change in the summer months. The      
 Sunday schools have a healthy         
 attendance.                           
  Perhaps because of the composition of
 population in the area, church going  
 is still seen as a normal activity,   
 though from a school survey, it       
 appears more from a sense of duty than
 deep religious belief. About 30% of   
 the pupils are regular visitors to    
 church.                               
                                       </content>
