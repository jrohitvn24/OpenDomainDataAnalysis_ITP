		<content> Apart from an occasional dance in a   
 local hotel what little entertainment 
 there is, is provided by amateurs who 
 work for charities. People have to    
 travel to Edinburgh for cinemas,      
 concerts, theatres etc.               
    The WHIPMAN PLAY is a folk festival
 held in June. This caters for         
 adults and children. It consists of   
 competitions,fancy dress parades, pipe
 bands and dances etc.                 
    A dance is held and two plays are  
 produced by the amateur dramatic      
 group each year.                      
    The P.T.A. organise two dances, a  
 whist drive and other events each     
 year to raise money for school funds. 
    Home entertainment depends on      
 television, radio, records, computer  
 games and videos. Our survey found    
 that computer games  and films on     
 videos to be the most popular.        </content>
