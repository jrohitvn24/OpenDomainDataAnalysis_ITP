		<title>11LIMERIGG DOG BREEDING 1</title>
		<content> My name is Mairi Brown. I am nine     
 years old. My mum,dad and I breed     
 dogs. We have Labrador Retrievers and 
 Pointers. If you have a bitch and you 
 want to breed,you must find the best  
 dog possible. After the bitch is      
 mated,the puppies grow inside the     
 mother's tummy for 63 days,before they
 are born. The mummy produces milk to  
 feed her young until they can lap milk
 from a dish - usually in about 3      
 weeks. Puppies' eyes open  in about   
 10 to 14 days and they are able to    
 crawl at 2-3 weeks. You have to feed  
 puppies 4 times a day,until they go to
 their new homes when they are 8 weeks 
 old.                                  
 Most people buy a puppy as a family   
 pet,but a few buy a puppy for showing 
 at dog shows. A dog must be taken to  
 "Ring Craft" classes to learn how to  
 stand and move properly.              </content>
