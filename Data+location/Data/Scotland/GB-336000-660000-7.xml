 Crichton Church was built in 1449 by  
 Lord Chancellor Crichton and was      
 dedicated to St Mungo.The church was  
 built about 500yds from his great     
 castle, which is now a historical     
 ruin. The church would serve the the  
 occupiers  of the castle, the         
 inhabitants of Crichton village and   
 surrounding area. It is still used as 
 a place of worship only on alternate  
 Sundays along with Cranston Kirk.     
   The original structure  of the      
 building has changed slightly. A roof 
 has been lowered and part has been    
 added at the back. The roof is not    
 original either.                      
   It was formerly a collegiate church 
 which means religious people studied  
 there.It is still a very beautiful old
 stone church.
