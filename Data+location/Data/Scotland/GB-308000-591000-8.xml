		<content>    Johnstone Show is held every year  
 in August and is a very popular event 
 in the community.                     
    There are classes for baking,      
 handwork, flowers, vegetables and a   
 childrens' class. There are always    
 sports held in the afternoon for old  
 and young alike. The show has been    
 going on every year since about 1924. 
     Johnstone Community Council       
 started in 1977 and is going from     
 strength to strength. There are       
 various events held every year        
 including a Car Treasure Hunt, an     
 outing for the Senior Citizens, a Fun 
 Day for the children, and Social      
 Evenings. This year the first Burns   
 Supper for 27 years was a great       
 success.                              
      The W.R.I.,started in 1926, used 
 to meet in the school but now meets   
 through the winter in the Parish Hall.</content>
