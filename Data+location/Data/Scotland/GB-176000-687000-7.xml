 THE FORESTRY COMMISSION TO HOUSE      
 IMMIGRANT FOREST WORKERS, LOCALS      
 PROVIDING A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE   
 LABOUR FORCE MECHANISATION HAS CHANGED
 THE FACE OF FORESTRY IN KNAPDALE.THE  
 INTRODUCTION OF THE FORWARDER,        
 PROCESSOR AND THE HARVESTER HAVE      
 RESULTED IN GREATER EFFICIENCY BUT    
 FEWER JOBS.SINCE THE VILLAGE WAS      
 FOUNDED THE NUMBER OF FORESTRY WORKERS
 HAS FALLEN FROM ABOUT 80 TO 3O.MUCH OF

 OF CHEMICAL WEEDING.THE WORK OF THE   
 F.C. CAN BE DIVIDED INTO 2 SEPARATE   
 PARTS HARVESTING AND MANAGEMENT.

 OF STANDING MATURE TIMBER TO THE      
 ROADSIDE.THE CHAINSAW AND WINCH HAVE  
 BEEN REPLACED BY THE HARVESTER AND    
 FORWARDER.continued on page 8         </content>
