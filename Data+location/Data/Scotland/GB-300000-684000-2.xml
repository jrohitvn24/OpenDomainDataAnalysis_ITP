		<content> Below High Valleyfield is the small   
 village of{Low Valleyfield}_ mainly   
 residential,some new houses,some old. 
 Here too the S.S.E.B. are in the      
 process of a large{land reclamation   
 project,using waste fly ash from      
 Longannet Power Station to reclaim    
 land to as far out as Preston Island. 
 This is a large scale project which   
 will result in landscaped land,planted
 with thousands of trees.              
 Along the coast,to the east,are the   
 villages of{Newmills}and              
{Torryburn,}virtually running together.
 They are quiet villages with very few 
 amenities.The children in these two   
 villages attend Torryburn Primary     
 School, which also has Nursery        
 facilities.
