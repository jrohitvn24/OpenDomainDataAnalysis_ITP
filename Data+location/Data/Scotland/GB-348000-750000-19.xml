		<title>19RECREATION-GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content>{Recreation}in Forfar includes a 109   
 acre 18 hole{golf course}1 mile out of
 the town.  The course is one of the   
 best in the district and compares     
 favourably with most others, while the
 catering in the clubhouse is          
 infinitely superior to most.  Forfar  
 golf course was opened on 6 September 
 1871 when permission to play on       
 Auchterforfar Moor was granted. The   
 undulating nature of the ground, due  
 to the previous flax cultivation,     
 makes it a challenging course for even
 the best players.  The course is      
 presently run by 20 people, 4 of whom 
 do the manual{work}around the course. 
 On average the greens are cut twice a 
 week but this increases during warmer 
 months.At present there are about 1000
 members mostly from Forfar.  It has   
 increased dramatically in recent      
 years.                                </content>
