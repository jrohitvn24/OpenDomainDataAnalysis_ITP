		<title>01THE HOLMS, COPINSAY,</title>
		<content> The Holms are Ward Holm, Black Holm   
 and the larger Corn Holm. The rocks of
 Ward Holm and Corn Holm are mainly    
 middle old red sanstone flags laid    
 down in shallow fresh water and are   
 some 350-400 million years old. Black 
 Holm differs in that it has a sill of 
 igneous greenstone. Bands of white and
 rosy quartzite can be found at the    
 S.E. corner. The Holms are covered in 
 rough grass. The Holms are connected  
 to each other and the nature reserve  
 of Copinsay at low tide and are       
 considered part of the reserve. There 
 are many types of sea birds including 
 Puffins and a colony of Artic Terns on
 Corn Holm. The Holms are populated by 
 colonies of Grey Seals. Corn Holm has 
 one of the best colonies of oyster    
 plant in Orkney on its beach.
