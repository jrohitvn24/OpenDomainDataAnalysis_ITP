		<title>20Johnstone Social Concerns</title>
		<content> In Spateston today there are many     
 social problems, too many!            
 Vandalism is one of these problems;   
 probably the worst.Everywhere you look
 there is grafitti scrawled across     
 walls and buildings. We have open-air 
 telephone boxes, or rather one's that 
 have had their windows smashed in and 
 their doors pulled off.               
 Another problem in Spateston is drug  
 abuse. Many people would be surprised 
 that a small place like Spateston     
 should have such a probem, but it has.
 If you go near the shopping cente at  
 night you are sure to meet some idiot 
 who is stoned out of his/her brain!   
 Solvent abuse is another serious      
 problem but in Spateston people don't 
 just sniff glue, they take drink and  
 drugs as well.                        
 It is mostly unemployed teenagers     
 involved in these problems.           </content>
