		<content>     Every year we have a Greenhills   
 Festival held at Ballerup High School.
 Sometimes there is a celebrity who    
 opens the festival.There are floats   
 advertising organizations.There is a  
 lot of competitions people can enter  
 for example"Beat the Goalie""Knock the
 Coconut down"and also "Throw the      
 wellie".There are displays of Karate  
 and Judo that let the public see the  
 art of defence.There are also pony    
 rides and very good prizes to be won  
 and people never go away from the     
 festival empty handed.Last year people
 had to through six dice and get six,  
 sixes to win a Ford Fiesta.           
    The public can buy plants.There is 
 a local band that play songs that     
 have been in the charts years         
 back.Over all it is a good day out.
