		<title>20Farm Machinery at Newburgh</title>
		<content> Farmers in this area need various     
 types of machinery to farm the        
 land.Much of the area is flat land    
 with a few gentle slopes here and     
 there.Quite often farmers find        
 themselves ploughing up a good many   
 stones in their fields which must be  
 removed before machinery like Combine 
 Harvesters can get to work.           
 The soil around Newburgh is sandy so  
 that the drainage is good where as at 
 Tipperty the soil is heavy clay so    
 there is poor drainage.The machines   
 find the clay soil hard to work in,so 
 the farmer uses double wheeled        
 tractors.These tractors are used      
 mainly for ploughing or planting.     
 The most common machines are Combines 
 and Tractors.The combines are used for
 cutting corn,wheat or barley.A tractor
 is used for pulling heavy machines.
