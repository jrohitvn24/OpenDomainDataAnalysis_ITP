		<content> Blackfords location astride the main  
 route from Stirling to Perth          
 traditionally generated work as did   
 local agriculture both with its demand
 for services and also with its supply 
 of products for processing by local   
 industry. Blackfords main natural     
 resource, local spring water, further 
 led to the development of water       
 related industries. These factors have
 their influence today, but in         
 different proportions to what they    
 once were. Undoubtably the opening in 
 January 1981 of the new section of the
 A9 by-passing the village to the south
 has had its effect. There is still    
 sufficient business to support in the 
 service sector, two hotels, a guest   
 house, an inn and several ded and     
 breakfast establishments, but a       
 transport cafe has closed down and a  
 hotel lies empty.                     </content>
