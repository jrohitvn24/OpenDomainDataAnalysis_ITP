		<content> James Steedman left school in May 1985
 at the age of sixteen and does not    
 have a job.He is a very good cook and 
 has won various competitions so he    
 would like to find employment in      
 catering.Although he loves the        
 village,he feels that it can be dull  
 for people of his age.If he stays he  
 will almost certainly not find work as
 for boys like him there is nothing but
 farming or forestry jobs.He hates the 
 thought of having to do these but,even
 if he wanted to,his chances are       
 limited of getting employment here    
 anyway.In his heart he knows that to  
 find a job,any job,he will have to    
 follow the example of many of the     
 other young people from the village   
 and leave.This makes him very sad.
