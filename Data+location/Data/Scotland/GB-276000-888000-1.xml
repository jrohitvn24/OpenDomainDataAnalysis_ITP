		<content>{GENERAL INFORMATION:}                 
 Dornoch is a small town just east of  
 the A9 and is situated near the sea.  
 Its sandy beaches, historic buildings 
 and world class golf course attracts  
 many tourists. Dornoch is one of the  
 three largest towns in the district.  
 The cathedral in the town is the only 
 one in the area. Dornoch has four main
 hotels which cater for tourists and   
 golfers and also many guest houses as 
 well as two caravan sites. Dornoch has
 one school which has a Primary School 
 and a two year Secondary School. Much 
 of the employment is in the service   
 areas. The pace of life in the area is
 slow, and change is gradual. A newly  
 proposed bridge across the Dornoch    
 Firth could bring improvements in     
 employment, tourism and easier access 
 to Ross-Shire and Inverness. It could 
 also mean a new railway for Dornoch.  </content>
