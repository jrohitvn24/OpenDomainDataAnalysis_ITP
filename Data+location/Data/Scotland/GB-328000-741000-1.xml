		<content>  Most of this area lies in the old    
 county of Angus but parts to the      
 north and west are in Perthshire.{    
  It is an agricultural area with some 
 of the best soils in Scotland.These   
 are loams derived from glacial drift  
 itself formed from the underlying{Old}
{Red Sandstone}of Devonian geological  
 age.                                  
  The area is situated on the northern 
 flanks of the{Sidlaw Hills}and        
 stretches northwards and downwards    
 into the Vale of{Strathmore.}Strath is
 an old Scottish word meaning wide     
 valley and more means large.          
  Most of the inhabitants live in the  
 village of Newtyle or in the scattered
 farms. Those who don't work in        
 agriculture or servicing it travel to 
 Dundee and work there. It is about 12 
 miles away.
