		<title>18The Game Keeper 2</title>
		<content>   The fun of stalking is to get as    
 close as possible before you shoot the
 deer(about 100 yards). Some people say
 that you can get a better shot at it  
 from above but our keeper says it is  
 just as good to crawl from below. When
 they go to weigh it they take the     
 belly out and that is what they call  
 larder condition. Today there is a lot
 of forestry which spreads the deer.   
 The keeper thinks there are not as    
 many deer now than what there were    
 ten years ago.                        
   The game keeper stocks the river by 
 putting 50 000 eyed ova salmon in the 
 river each year to help natural stock.
 The predators that kill the fish are  
 heron, eel, seal, Brown trout,        
 Mergansers, Goosanders, Cormorants and
 Mink. The game keeper can't do any    
 thing about them.
