		<content> Our block consists of the town of     
 Huntly. The population is 4300. The   
 rural area to the south of Huntly     
 includes the valley of the river Bogie
 which flows north to meet the river   
 Deveron at Huntly. The town is        
 by-passed to prevent congestion in our
 narrow streets. The area has farming  
 industry and commercial interests.    
 Many topics have been studied; shops, 
 fashion, food, churches, hospital,    
 Scotts hospital, railway station,     
 transport, farming and the mart.      
 A day in the life of a farmer and a   
 day in the life of a pupil are        
 studied.
