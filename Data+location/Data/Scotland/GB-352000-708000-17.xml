		<title>17TRULY RURAL PERSON</title>
		<content>  Mrs. Mc.Creadie is truly rural;      
 daughter of the local joiner, she was 
 born and educated in Dunino and for   
 the last 21 years (1963-84) was       
 Headteacher at Dunino School. She     
 spent her childhood and young         
 adulthood (1921-46) at Bellrock View, 
 altered by her father in 1910 and     
 renamed, appropriately, since it      
 offers a view of the Bellrock         
 Lighthouse.Many years ago the local   
 tailor stayed in the house and to this
 day the hill going towards the house  
 is still known as "The Tylers Brae".  
 Mrs. McCreadie has seen several       
 changes, from the threshing mill and  
 binders to the combine harvester, over
 the last 60 years.  Farms were labour 
 intensive, conditioned by horse power,
 employees included coach and          
 groomsmen and the day started at 5a.m.
 in the stables.                       </content>
