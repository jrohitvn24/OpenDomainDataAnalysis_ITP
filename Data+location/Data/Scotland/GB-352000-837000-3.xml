		<title>03HOUSING IN HUNTLY</title>
		<content> There is all kinds of housing in      
 Huntly. There are flats for the old   
 people in Granary street. They were   
 ready for use on the 5 May 1982.      
 They are designed so that the old     
 people will not be lonely. They have a
 warden there. Some of the old people  
 said Granary Street was called        
 Granary Street because there was once 
 a mill there.                         
 Nelson street has houses dating back  
 to 1888 the houses are made of stone. 
 Our block has many of the new council 
 houses. They were built about 10 years
 ago. These consist of 5 storey blocks 
 of flats semi-detatched and terraced  
 houses all with gardens. Some streets 
 have larger private houses dating back
 to around to 1900.
