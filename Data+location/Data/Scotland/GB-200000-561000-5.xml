		<title>05LESWALT VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  The village is the population for the
 block and one of several dormitory    
 villages for the Stranraer area.      
 Farming, dairy, beef and sheep,       
 employs few workers, a car sales and  
 service station, the shop and the     
 school seven more.  The minister, of a
 shared parish, and the school staff   
 live outside the area.  The villagers 
 are attracted by fine old cottages,   
 excellent council housing and         
 attractively modern bungalows and     
 presently include skilled and         
 unskilled tradesmen and professional  
 people - a doctor, radiographer and   
 nurse, accountant, teacher and        
 policeman, a deep-sea diver and       
 Sealink seamen, a fencer, a dyker and 
 firewood merchant-surely a very       
 cosmopolitan community.  July         
 population was 146 adults and 53      
 children of school age.               </content>
