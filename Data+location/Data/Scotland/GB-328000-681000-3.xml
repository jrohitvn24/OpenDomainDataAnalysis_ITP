		<title>03Mary Queen of Scots Visit</title>
		<content> In 1564 Mary Queen of Scots visited   
 the island and the occasion was       
 commemorated by an inscribed stone    
 bearing her Coat of Arms and the      
 date.The stone was originally erected 
 within the French fortress which was  
 located at the southern end of the    
 island.  Today the stone is located   
 above a gateway in the courtyard of   
 the lighthouse and is beautifully     
 painted. The Coat of Arms of Mary     
 Queen of Scots consists of a sheild   
 with a rampant lion on it, a white    
 horse either side of it and a crown   
 above it.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
