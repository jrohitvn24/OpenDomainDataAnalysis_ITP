		<content>  Waid Academy celebrates its centenary
 next session. We will be the hundredth
 group of children to begin first year.
  In 1800 Lt. Andrew Waid left money   
 and instructions that a school"Waid's 
 Orphan Academy" was to be built on    
 ground he owned. It was to take in,   
 accommodate, clothe and educate orphan
 boys and seamen's sons living in      
 poverty. They were to wear blue sea-  
 style suits and red neckcloths. For   
 various reasons the school was not    
 completed until 1886. Called "The Waid
 Academy" built not on Lt. Waid's land 
 but on the north side of the town, it 
 admitted 94 pupils, both boys &amp; girls.
 The fees were a minimum of Â£2 per year
 but there was free education for 10   
 children, preference given to orphans.
  We look forward to the many special  
 celebrations planned for next session.
