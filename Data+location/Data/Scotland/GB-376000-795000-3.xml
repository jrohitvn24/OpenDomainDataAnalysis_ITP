		<title>03A Day on the Farm in Durris</title>
		<content> Farming is important in Durris,with a 
 lot of beef cattle raised and crops   
 like oats and barley grown.Here is a  
 description of a typical farm day.    
   First thing in the morning Dad milks
 the cow and gives the milk to Granny. 
 He feeds his bulls which,are inside   
 all the time until they are sold,     
 usually in October.He then walks round
 all the other cows and calves to see  
 if they are alright.Grandad feeds the 
 hens and ducks and in the duck's house
 there are rats.Just now it is time for
 hoeing turnips and fencing and for    
 better weather for the hay.About five 
 o'clock they do the same again.My     
 Grandad collects the duck's eggs and  
 the hen's eggs and he feeds both sets 
 of birds.There might be extra work to 
 do in the evening,so it can be a long 
 and tiring day for the farmer.
