		<content> There is no playschool in our area but
 most pre-school children can go to    
 Cupar or Gauldry kindergartens. Four  
 year old pre-school children come to  
 Rathillet school once a week for two  
 hours to get used to the school. The  
 pupils from Logie and Kilmany now     
 attend Rathillet school because Logie 
 closed in 1970 and Kilmany in 1981.   
 Even though most of the pupils live   
 within two miles they get ferried to  
 school by mini-bus because the main   
 road is so busy.Pupils living at      
 Ballindean and Fincraigs attend       
 Gauldry school and later Madras       
 College in St.Andrews for secondary   
 education.When the pupils finish      
 primary 7 here they go up to          
 Bell-Baxter High school in Cupar.
