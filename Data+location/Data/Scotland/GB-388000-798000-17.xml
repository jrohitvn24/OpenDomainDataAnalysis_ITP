		<content> A{mini-bus service}has just started   
 based in Maryculter. It is called     
{Dial-a-Ride.}You telephone if you are 
 wanting picked up and takes you into  
 the city where you can use the city   
 bus service if necessary.             
{ Nearly every household in the area   
{has a car.}If people have good cars   
 they must have good jobs. There are   
 good jobs here because of the         
 prosperity from The Oil Industry in   
 nearby Aberedeen.                     
  We have a coal merchant who lives in 
 Banchory-Devenick and he needs{lorries
 that can take heavy weights.          
  We have a{car dealer in}the community
 but no garage. There are of course    
 many{farm vehicles}in this rural area.
  We daily see{aeroplanes and          
{helicopters}flying overhead on their  
 way to busy Dyce Airport in the north 
 of Aberdeen.                          </content>
