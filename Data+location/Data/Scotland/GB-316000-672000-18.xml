		<content>{FOOD I LIKE}by Warner, aged 10.       
 I like a lot more kinds of food than  
 my dad does. I like it well-cooked but
 not burned. From a fish and chip shop,
 I like white pudding or German        
 sausage. I also like my mum's curries 
 with chapattis or nan bread, and her  
 cheesecake and trifle. My Dad makes   
 mince that is the best I ever tasted. 
{MY PETS}by Jennifer, aged 10.         
 I have four pets - a rabbit, a guinea 
 pig and 2 fish. My rabbit is called   
 Snowball, the guinea pig is Squeak,   
 and the fish are Caramera and Jaws. In
 the afternoon I let Snowball and      
 Squeak out in the garden to run about 
 and get some exercise. When they get  
 tired, I lift them and put them on the
 straw in their hutch. On Saturdays I  
 clean the hutch out and put in fresh  
 straw, sawdust, newspaper, and some   
 material for their comfort.           </content>
