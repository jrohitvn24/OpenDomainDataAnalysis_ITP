      A few people in Quarff work at   
 crafts or small industry. Karen-Anne's
 mother grafts jumpers. She grafts     
 necks and cuffs. Sometimes she puts   
 pockets on the jumpers. She gives them
 to a man who sells them. Most women in
 Quarff are expert knitters.           
      An old man in Quarff does        
 leatherwork. He makes purses, bags and
 mends shoes. Malcolm's mother cures   
 sheepskins for sale. There is also a  
 man who makes furniture; he will      
 design and produce whatever you want. 
 Lynn, Lyall and Russell's dad is a    
 builder; he builds garages and houses.
