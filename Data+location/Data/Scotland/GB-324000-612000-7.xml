		<title>07ETTRICK VALLEY DIALECT.</title>
		<content>   Any visitors to Ettrick Valley      
 probably wouldn't understand the      
 locals when they spoke because they   
 have a language of their own.         
   If a shepherd says,"Come bye,"to his
 dog he means it to go round the sheep 
 to the left,"Awa tae me,"means to     
 go round to the right."Bide           
 there,"means stay there and,"Awa back"
 means go back.                        
   A shepherd wouldn't say,"I need a   
 shelter because my sheep are quite    
 frightened from this storm,"they would
 say,"Ah need a bield cos ma sheep ur  
 gey feart fae this storm."            
   Somebody in Ettrick wouldn't say,   
 "Get this mouse out of my house,"they 
 would say,"Git this moose oot o ma    
 hoose!"                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
