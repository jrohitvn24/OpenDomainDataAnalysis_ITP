		<title>03NEW ABBEY - EDUCATION</title>
		<content>   New Abbey school is a fairly new    
 open-plan rural school. It was opened 
 in May 1975 and replaced the old      
 granite building which had served the 
 needs of the community for over a     
 hundred years.                        
   Between 1975 and 1981 the pupil roll
 dropped from 67 to 42 and teaching    
 staff was reduced from three to two.  
 Now, however, the roll has gradually  
 increased and there are again three   
 full-time teachers. The school is also
 served by a remedial specialist twice 
 weekly and specialist teachers in art,
 music and physical education once a   
 week. During the past year the older  
 children have been offered tuition in 
 swimming, sailing and orienteering.   
   All round New Abbey children's      
 educational and recreational needs    
 seem to be well catered for.
