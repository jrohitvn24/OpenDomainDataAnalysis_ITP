		<content> Mr J.F.Munro is the main local        
 employer.He runs a general building   
 and haulage business and employs 17   
 people two of whom are in the         
 office.He started work in Dornie 18   
 years ago but it is only in the past  
 11 years he has had his own           
 business.He finds the major advantage 
 in being in Dornie relates to the     
 quality of life rather than any       
 financial one.There are disadvantages 
 in being so far from the centres of   
 population and from public services.  
 When he left school he joined the     
 navy.This did not only let him see the
 world but he met different people.This
 helped him later in his business.He   
 would recommend this to anyone and    
 quotes the Gaelic proverb"If you think
 you can or dream you can-begin it."
