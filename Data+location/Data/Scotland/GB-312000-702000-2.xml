		<title>02Loch Leven, Kinross-shire</title>
		<content> A large part of our block, 38.5% of   
 it, forms the northern end of{Loch    
{Leven. }Round the shore of the loch   
 are nature reserves controlled by     
 The Nature Conservancy Council.       
 The public are allowed on only a few  
 restricted sites, access to which was 
 provided under an agreement with      
 Kinross Estates in 1964.              
 One of these sites is Burleigh Sands. 
 It has a good car park and picnic area
 set under Scots pines, and is visited 
 by local people and summer visitors.  
 Many bird species nest around the     
 shore but some seem to prefer the     
 islands in the loch because foxes are 
 active in the area.                   
 The loch is stocked with{Loch Leven   
{Trout,}which has a deep pink or red   
 flesh and is very tasty. The loch is  
 a popular venue for anglers who hire  
 boats from the pier near{Kinross.     </content>
