 MOST OF THE PRIVATE HOUSES IN LARKHALL
 ARE SITUATED AROUND MACHANHILL AND    
 CARLISLE ROAD.FROM OUR INVESTIGATION  
 WE DISCOVERED THAT THE SAME NUMBER OF 
 PEOPLE LIVE IN PRIVATE HOUSES AS IN   
 COUNCIL HOUSES.IN GENERAL THESE HOUSES
 WERE BUILT IN THE 20TH CENTURY,WITH   
 MOST BEING BUILT BETWEEN 1940 AND THE 
 PRESENT DAY.ALTHOUGH MOST WERE BUILT  
 IN IN THE PAST 40 YEARS SOME PRIVATE  
 HOUSES ARE EVEN OLDER MANY OF THESE   
 BUILT IN THE 19TH CENTURY.THE MOST    
 COMMON TYPES OF HOUSES ARE THE VILLA  
 AND BUNGALOW AND IN GENERAL ARE       
 USUALLY SEMI-DETACHED ALTHOUGH THERE  
 ARE SOME LARGE DETACHED HOUSES IN THE 
 TOWN.SOME OF THE HOUSES HAVE PROBLEMS 
 SUCH AS DAMPNESS OR CONDENSATION.THE  
 PRIVATE HOUSES ARE MAINLY HEATED BY   
 GAS WITH ONLY A FEW USING ELECTRICTY
