		<content> Shinty is a popular sport in the      
 Highlands.There are twelve players in 
 each team and there are at least two  
 reserves.You can also play six-a-side.
 Our shinty team is called Strathglass 
 and last year we won the MacMaster Cup
 but Lovat won it this year.           
 Lovat,Strathglass and Beauly are      
 the three teams near here but there   
 are a lot more.A caman is like a      
 hockey stick,but it is designed so    
 that you can use both sides.          
 Each team has their own strip.To start
 a game of shinty the referee throws up
 the shinty ball for the centers to    
 hit.At half-time or at any stage      
 of the game players can come off and  
 the reserves can go on.At the end of  
 the match they have refreshments.The  
 younger generation play in age groups.
 There are four age groups-under 12's, 
 under 14's,under 17's and under 21's. </content>
