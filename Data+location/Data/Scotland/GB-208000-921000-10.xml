		<title>10HIGHLAND HEALTH MATTERS</title>
		<content> We are fairly well seved here for     
 Health care. We have a general        
 practitioner in Assynt. He has a panel
 of 840. The surgery is quite well     
 equipped with a new electro-cardiac   
 machine partly bought by public       
 subscription. It is felt that there   
 should be another Doctor. Distance to 
 travel is not taken into account by   
 the authorities- only numbers! The    
 surgery doubles as a Dentists Surgery.
 Equipment for this was donated. We    
 also have itinerent specialists       
 visit us. The nearest major Hospital  
 is in Inverness.(100mls). We also have
 a splended new Sheltered Housing      
 complex here. Built in 1984 to cater  
 for our elderly, we consider ourselves
 lucky to have it. There is also a     
 District Nurse resident here plus a   
 full time Ambulance Driver. The poor  
 doctor also doubles as the Chemist!   </content>
