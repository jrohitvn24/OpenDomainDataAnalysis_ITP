		<title>01Tynron and Shinnel Water</title>
		<content> A landscape dominated by sheep        
 farming; higher parts covered with    
 rough grass and bracken, with much    
 improved grassland for hay and silage 
 on lower slopes and valley flats.     
 Some hill cattle, eggs and chicks     
 produced at Lann Hall Hatchery, sheep 
 milked at Kirkland.  Variety given by 
 small patches of conifers, a ribbon of
 mixed woodland along the Shinnel and  
 the famous juniper wood near the ford.
  Attractive Shinnel Water forms an    
 elbow, with Airdlinn a local beauty   
 spot.  Rounded hills up to 335m with  
 crags at Craigturra and Tynron Doon, a
 Conical hill visible for miles.  Two  
 beautiful lochans at Aird and         
 Capenoch.  Population of about 60 half
 living in and around Tynron village,  
 no amenities save a post-box,         
 telephone, village hall and the Kirk  
 used once a month.                    </content>
