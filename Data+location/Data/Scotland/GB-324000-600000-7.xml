 advanced Lamas of their tradition ,   
 lead study courses at Christmas ,     
 Easter and Tibetan New Year , and also
 during the summer from july to        
 september.From time to time qualified 
 teachers from other religions visit   
 the centre to give instruction.Both   
 religious and meditation instruction  
 is given most of the year.            
  On a hill nearby a retreat house     
 facility exists where students can    
 spend periods of time in complete     
 solitude in order to stabilise their  
 practice.
