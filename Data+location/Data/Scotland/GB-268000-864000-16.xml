 plants which she grows herself, a     
 blacksmith, a mountaineering guide,   
 the local shopkeepers and the manager 
 of the Cromarty Firth Port Authority. 
 Some of these travel daily into       
 Inverness or Dingwall. Unfortunately  
 there are few opportunities for work  
 for school leavers in the area, and   
 they often have to take jobs as shop  
 assistants and the like in Fortrose,  
 Dingwall or Inverness. Travelling is  
 very difficuilt for these young people
 as there is only one bus a day in each
 direction. Fortunately neighbours are 
 kind and helpful and often provide    
 lifts in their cars.
