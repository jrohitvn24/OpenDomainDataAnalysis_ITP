		<content> By 1953, Sanquhar had expanded to     
 include two council-built housing     
 schemes, the streets being named after
 famous Covenanters and local families 
 of note. One street, built in 1947, to
 house 28 mining families from Larkhall
 in Lanarkshire, was referred to as    
 "Larkie Town". Three garages now coped
 with the needs of motorised transport,
 and electricity had replaced gas as   
 the main source of power. The farms   
 had become more mechanised, with      
 horses being replaced by tractors and 
 farmers were now able to attend       
 markets outwith the immediate area. A 
 few families now owned a television   
 and a travelling cinema visited the   
 town each Saturday (entrance fee being
 5 jam jars).A large extension had been
 made to the school and a now defunct  
 weekly newspaper, "The Nithsdale      
 Observer", was published in the town. </content>
