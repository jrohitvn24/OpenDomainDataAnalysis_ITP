		<content>   We start school at 5 years old.     
 After we've finished at Primary School
 at 12 years of age we go to Secondary 
 School in Dalbeattie.                 
   In school we try to do Mathematics, 
 Spelling, Reading and some other      
 Language work every day. We usually do
 History,Geography,Science and Art in  
 our school Projects.                  
   The children in our school are all  
 different ages but we play and work   
 together quite well.We think the small
 numbers are good because there are no 
 bullies and you get more attention and
 more room to play outside.            
   This year we are going to have the  
 school modernized.We are having new   
 toilets put inside and carpets on the 
 floor. It will be very nice when it is
 finished.
