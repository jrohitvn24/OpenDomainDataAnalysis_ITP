		<content>  Every April, August, September and   
 October sales are held by Reith and   
 Anderson, Dingwall, at Rogart Auction 
 Market. Most local families make sale 
 day a day out; so around 300 people   
 attend.                               
  At least 7,000 lambs, 3,000 sheep, 30
 rams and 500 head of cattle are sold  
 annually. In August, buyers come from 
 Aberdeenshire and the Borders to buy  
 Rogart lambs for fattening. The       
 remaining sales are attended by local 
 people, who buy to increase or improve
 their stock.                          
  The weather can affect the quality of
 the lambs. A hard winter can cause    
 animals to lose a lot of weight. A    
 good spring can mean lambs are in     
 excellent condition.                  
  If the seller gets a fair price, he  
 will sell. If he gets a poor price, he
 may be forced to take them home again.</content>
