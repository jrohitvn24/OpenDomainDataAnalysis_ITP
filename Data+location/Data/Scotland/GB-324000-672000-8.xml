		<title>08Hospital Closure</title>
		<content> Founded in 1885,{Bruntsfield Hospital 
 is one hundred years old, but no one  
 now feels like celebrating its        
{centenary.}It is waiting only for the 
 Secretary of State to approve its     
 closure.                              
 This hospital, founded by Edinburgh's 
 first woman doctor, Sophia Jex-Blake, 
 set out to care just for{women and    
{children.}Originally it was staffed   
 entirely by women and has remained,   
 throughout the years, extrememly      
 popular with its patients, who liked  
 its friendly, "family" atmosphere.    
 Because of the cash crisis, the       
 Lothian Health Board discussed the    
 re-development of the{Royal Infirmary}
 to take over the work of the smaller  
 hospitals. So has this hospital       
 outlived its purpose? Some still      
 believe that there is a case even yet 
 for fighting for its survival.        </content>
