		<title>15Coast - The Caves</title>
		<content> The name Wemyss is derived from the   
 Celtic 'uaimh' which means cave.      
 There were once eleven caves near the 
 shore of East Wemyss but this number  
 has been reduced to nine because of   
 earth movements and mining operations.
 The caves are :                       
 1  Gasworks Cave - can go in.         
 2  White Cove Cave - closed.          
 3  Sloping Cave - DANGEROUS.          
 4  Jonathan's Cave - can go in.       
 5  Un-named Cave - DANGEROUS.         
 6  Well Cave - DANGEROUS.             
 7  East Doo Cave - closed.            
 8  West Doo Cave - can go in.         
 9  Court Cave - DANGEROUS.            
 10 Michael Cave - covered up.         
 11 Glass Cave - filled in.            
 The rocks in which the caves are to be
 found are a particularly soft variety 
 of Red Sandstone. The sea was at least
 8m higher when the caves were formed. </content>
