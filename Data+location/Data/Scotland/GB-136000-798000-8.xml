		<content> Shearwaters are the subject of a three
 year study which aims to investigate  
 mortality &amp; factors affecting breeding
 outcome.Burrows are being monitored to
 assess the influence of their physical
 characteristics on breeding success.  
 Preliminary results indicate drainage 
 is important; poorly_sited burrows are
 at risk of flooding following heavy   
 rain.Food samples collected from adult
 birds throughout the breeding season, 
 together with weighing of feeds given 
 to chicks,provide info.on influence of
 feeding ecology on breeding outcome.  
 Potential predators include golden    
 eagles, white_tailed sea eagles, great
 black_backed gulls, brown rats &amp; even 
 red deer! Meal remains left by avian  
 predators provide info.on their impact
 while trapping &amp; observation indicate 
 rats scavenge abandoned eggs &amp; dead   
 chicks but are not predators.         </content>
