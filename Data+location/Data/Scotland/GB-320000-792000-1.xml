		<title>01The Royal Dee at Inver</title>
		<content> The physical appearance of 'the block'
 described is that of a flat-bottomed  
 valley with higher ground to either   
 side (450m).  It is traveled from     
 east/west by the River Dee and the    
 main road (A93) on the northern side  
 of the river. The area is principally 
 planted with conifers with farmland on
 valley floor growing small amounts of 
 cattle foder with cattle and sheep in 
 enclosed rough grazing.  The open     
 moorland is used for deer stalking and
 grouse shooting.  This rural area is  
 sparsely populated and those living   
 here find employment as tenant farmers
 or estate workers.  The only amenity -
 the Inver Hotel - has a small passing 
 trade from th thousands of touristthat

 the summer months attracted by the    
 villages Braemar to the west,Ballater
