		<content> Within a large public park stands     
{Camperdown Wildlife Centre,}whose     
 purpose is primarily educational.  It 
 houses most of the indigenous animals 
 of Scotland.  There are 435 animals   
 here, representing 20 mammal          
 species, 36 bird species and one kind 
 of reptile.  The mammals include Red  
 and Fallow deer, Red squirrels, Pine  
 Martins, Pole Cats, Weasels, and a    
 Brown Bear.                           
 Although it was opened in 1968 by the 
 Parks and Recreation Department, the  
 actual Centre was only built in 1973. 
 The running costs of the Centre amount
 to some Â£65,000 per year.             
 On our visit there, Mr Valentine, the 
 Ranger, showed us round and told us   
 about the different animals. Everyone 
 at the Centre is keen to involve young
 people in learning about their native 
 wildlife.                             </content>
