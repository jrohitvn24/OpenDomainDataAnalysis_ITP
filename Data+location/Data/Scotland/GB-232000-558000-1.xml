 Kirkcowan is a village of about 200   
 inhabitants in the North West of our  
 block. Flowing East and South East    
 through{rough grassland}is the River  
 Tarff which flows into the River      
 Bladnoch. Several{beef farms}are      
 situated to the South and East of the 
 area, while nearer the village is a{  
{dairy farm}where Fresians are kept for
 their milk. The{highest point}is      
 Boreland Fell near a disused quarry.  
 Small areas of{coniferous trees}have  
 been planted. The one main road runs  
 near the River Bladnoch South to      
 Wigtown which gives the district its  
 name. Wigtown comes from the Norse    
 word Vic  meaning bay. The nearest    
 towns are Newton Stewart to the East  
 and Stranraer to the West.
