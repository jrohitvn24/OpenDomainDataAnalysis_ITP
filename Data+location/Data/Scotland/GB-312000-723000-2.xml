		<title>02A boy's view of Gannochy</title>
		<content> There aren't many cars or other       
 traffic so there is plenty of space to
 play.There's a lovely pond with an    
 Island in the middle and lots of      
 ducks.                                
 There are many children in the area so
 there's always lots of people to play 
 with.                                 
 There's lots of space for cycling and 
 playing football and there is a tennis
 club for energetic youngsters and a   
 bowling club for older people.        
 Most of the houses have big gardens   
 with hedges or walls around them so   
 there's lots of privacy.              
 You would think you were in the       
 country there's fields and trees and  
 even a burn but it is very convient   
 because it is so near the town.       
 Over all Gannochy is a very good place
 to live for adults and children alike.
