		<content> Nethertown of Croys is a farm which   
 is a part of three farms.  The        
 three farms work as one and all help  
 each other with animals and crops.    
 Nethertown of Croys used to be a dairy
 farm, but when Mr and Mrs Hutton moved
 in they turned it into a beef farm.   
 Nethertown of Croys is 200 acres.     
 They use this for grazing cattle and  
 growing crops.  Their main crop is    
 oats. It is used to feed the cattle.  
 The breed of cattle they have are     
 Galloways and they have a few Hereford
 cattle. There are over one hundred    
 cattle. Mrs Hutton and her daughter   
 Jennifer have two horses but purely   
 for pleasure. Mr and Mrs Hutton do not
 actually own the farm. They rent it   
 from Mr Keswick who lives in Bridge of
 Urr.
