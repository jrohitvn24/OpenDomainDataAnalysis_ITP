{    (STRANRAER &amp; GLEN LUCE.)}         
                                       
                                       
  From the area studied it was found   
 that the{PILTANTON}burn does not      
 comply with the characteristics of a  
 theoretical river.                    
  The river was relatively straight    
 with a few curves and with only slight
 evidence of the formation of a meander
 towards the mouth. Instead of widening
 towards the mouth, the Piltanton burn 
 started off narrow then widened       
 slightly at Lochans village but then  
 narrows again at the sewage works     
{(ref. 068 565).}                      
  The flood plains also varied in width
 along the burn but none were present  
 at the end of the river.
