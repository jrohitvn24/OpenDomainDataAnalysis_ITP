		<title>02SHAWHEAD PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   In Shawhead School there are 64     
 pupils aged between 4 and 12 years in 
 classes Primary 1 to Primary 7. There 
 are three classrooms and three        
 ordinary teachers. There is one cook  
 and one lady who helps the cook and   
 tidies up the school at night. We also
 have other teachers like our gym      
 teacher, our art teacher and our      
 Health Visitor.                       
                                       
   We have a big playground and a big  
 playing field. My dad made the        
 playground and helped to build the    
 school as well with his digger.       
                                       
   At break the boys play football most
 of the time. We play lots of other    
 games like Fifty Buzz, Catchy, British
 Bulldog, Kingsey and so on.
