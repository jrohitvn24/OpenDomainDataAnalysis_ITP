 The information for these pages has   
 been gathered by the 31 children and  
 two teachers of{Tongue Primary}School.
 One or two contributions have been    
 made by local residents and much help 
 and patience has been extended to the 
 children while they were working on   
 the project. The children are all     
 happy living in Tongue although in the
 words of one of them 'It is a very    
 quiet place, but it can sometimes be  
 distracted by planes.'.
