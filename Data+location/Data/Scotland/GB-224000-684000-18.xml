		<title>18ROAD SAFETY IN THE RHU AREA.</title>
		<content> Road safety is a major cause for      
 concern in our area.Accidents are     
 occurring because people are not      
 adhering to the speed limits on both  
 the new road and on the narrow roads  
 through the villages of Clynder and   
 Rhu and there is growing concern      
 that,with the proposed Trident        
 development at the Faslane Naval Base,
 an even greater volume of traffic is  
 going to cause further problems       
 especially on the stretch of road     
 through Rhu where there is a          
 notoriously sharp bend leading out of 
 the village.As the request for a      
 by_pass to be built above the village 
 was ruled out,Rhu and Shandon         
 Community Council has suggested to    
 Trident officials that as much of the 
 heavy building materials as possible  
 be brought into the area by either sea
 or rail in order to ease the situation</content>
