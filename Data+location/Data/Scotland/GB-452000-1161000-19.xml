{                                      
  Football is one of the most popular  
 leisure activities on Whalsay.        
  The Football Field at Saeter was made
 in 1964 and since then there have been
 many alterations to it.               
  The Parish Cup is one of the trophies
  competed for in Shetland and Whalsay 
 have won it roughly 11 times.         
  All footballers here are amateurs who
 start in school teams and may ,like   
 Wilbert Jamieson,play for the team for
 18 years.
