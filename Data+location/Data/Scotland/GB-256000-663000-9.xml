{Jesus,}but as a prophet and not as the
 'Son of God',is the{MUSLIMS.}Their God
 is known as{ALLAH}and their book is   
 known as the{KORAN.}Mohammed was the  
 last prophet of Allah,and is the most 
 important to the MUSLIMS. The Asian

 day.Muslims main festival is called   
 EID and falls twice a year.
