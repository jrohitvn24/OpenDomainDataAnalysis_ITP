		<content> Chirnside Parish Church is the only   
 church being used for worship in the  
 village. Before World War 1 there were
 3 churches. The North Church is now   
 being used as a community centre and  
 the third church was demolished so    
 that sheltered housing could be built.
 There is also a mission hall. Rev W P 
 Graham has been minister for 17 years 
 and preaches to an average            
 congregation of 50. He is also        
 minister to the churches at Bonkyl and
 Edrom which have fortnightly services.
 He is chaplain to the Knoll Hospital, 
 Duns, and to Chirnside Primary School,
 which he visits twice a month. A      
 Sunday School is held for children    
 aged 5 to 12 years, with an evening   
 group for older pupils. At the Sunday 
 School Club, on Tuesdays, the         
 activities include drama, games and   
 visits.                               </content>
