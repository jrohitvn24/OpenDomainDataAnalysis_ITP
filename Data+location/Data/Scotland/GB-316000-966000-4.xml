		<content> The Norfrost freezer factory in       
 Castletown started life in an old     
 Nissen hut with 3 workers in 1971.The 
 first freezers were produced in 1974. 
 Now,10 years on,the factory building  
 is about 74,000 sq.feet and employs   
 110 workers .2 000 freezers are       
 produced each week and it is hoped to 
 increase this to 4 000.The factory's  
 annual turnover is Â£6 000 000 and the 
 profit is about Â£1 000 000.Freezers   
 are sold to many different countries  
 such as Denmark,France,Australia,     
 America,Pakistan,Dubai and Kuwait.    
 Different freezers are produced to    
 suit the differing climates of these  
 countries.                            
   The factory makes its own           
 tools, generates its own electricity  
 and transports its own freezers.The   
 success of the factory is based on    
 these factors and a lot of hard work. </content>
