 Dirleton Castle was built in the 13th 
 Century by an Anglo Norman family     
 named de Vaux. It was passed on       
 through marriage to the Hallyburtons  
 and finally to the Ruthvens. In the   
 mid 17th Century  it was attacked  and
 bombarded  by  Cromwell's troops led  
 by General Monk; to stop it being used
 again they left the castle in ruins.  
 It is now in the care of the National 
 Trust and is open to the public.The   
 approx attendance per year is 25000,of
 which 36% are visitors from abroad,

 Edinburgh Festival.
