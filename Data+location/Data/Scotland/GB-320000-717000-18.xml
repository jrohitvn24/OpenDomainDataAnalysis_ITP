		<title>18Newburgh - the old Factory</title>
		<content>   {Linoleum}used to be the main       
 industry in{Newburgh.}The factory was 
 built in{1891}and{Mr Greig}the founder
 was a{great benefactor}to the town.   
 The factory was called the{Tayside    
{Floorcloth Company}and was the{main   
{employer}with more than{400 people    
 working there. Unfortunately in{1978} 
 the business suddenly{collapsed}and   
 nearly all the workers lost their     
 jobs. It was bought by{Mr Louvell of  
{Chiltern Herbs,}who kept only a small 
 work force. For a time they produced a
 little linoleum but nothing after     
 1980, when part of the factory was    
 destroyed by fire.                    
    There is a story in the town that  
 the Council is to demolish all of the 
 factory except the offices and make   
 it into a housing estate.
