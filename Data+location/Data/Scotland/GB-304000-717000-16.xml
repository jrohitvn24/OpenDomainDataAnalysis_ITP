		<content> Dupplin Castle lies to the north east 
 of Forteviot village. It was rebuilt  
 in 1967. The previous castle was built
 between 1828 _1830. The part known as 
 the Stirling wing was built in 1740.  
 During W.W.2 the house, as the family 
 like to call it, was damaged by fire  
 while being used as a hospital for    
 Polish soldiers.                      
 The new castle was built because the  
 old one was too big and the sandstone 
 was in a bad state of repair, along   
 with the roof.                        
 Dupplin Castle's estate covers 1100   
 acres. Before the war it employed 11  
 gamekeepers and 20 household staff.Now
 there are 5 domestics and 1 gardener. 
 There are 16 employees on the farms, 6
 forestry workers, 6 gamekeepers, 3    
 tradesmen and estate office workers.  
 The estate belongs to a trust and the 
 Laird is only a tenant.               </content>
