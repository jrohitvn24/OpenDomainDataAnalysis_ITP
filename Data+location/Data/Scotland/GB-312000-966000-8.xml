		<title>08LORD THURSO'S LAND</title>
		<content>  {Lord Thurso}owns the Ulbster estates
 which now amounts to about 40,000     
 acres. The centre of the estate is the
{River Thurso}attractive to visiting   
 anglers for salmon and trout fishing. 
   Much of his land is let to tenant   
 farmers but{Lord Thurso}farms a small 
 acreage at{Thurso East Mains}and keeps
 a small flock of pedigreed Suffolk and
 crossbred Suffolk sheep there.        
   About 500 acres of the{Thurso East} 
 farm are let to Mr. Morris who rears  
 beef cattle and sheep and grows oats, 
 barley and grass.                     
   The farm was previously a dairy farm
 but because of Common Market 'butter  
 mountains' and 'milk lakes' he now    
 produces beef. The farm cottages are  
 now let mainly as holiday homes.      
  {Lord and Lady Thurso}are well known 
 in the area and spend much time taking
 part in community activities.         </content>
