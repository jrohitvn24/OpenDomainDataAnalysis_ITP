		<content> The{old Police House at 46 Brae Road  
 where the Anderson family now live was
 built around 1885-87. It had at that  
 time one cell in one room. There was  
 only 1 policeman and 46 Brae Road was 
 used as the police house for          
 approximately 35 years.               
 Before the police used the house in   
 Brae Road it was a private house which
 it is now once again. The cottage     
 across from the lighthouse in Brae    
 Road was the original police station. 
 Today nearby{Bervie Police Station}is 
 a partially manned office (messages   
 can be left on a teleprinter) with 3  
 officers serving the local communities
 including Gourdon in their patrol     
 cars. The opening of the Bervie Police
 Station made it no longer necessary to
 have a village bobby based in Gourdon.
