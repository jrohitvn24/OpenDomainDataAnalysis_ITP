		<content> A few of us went to visit the         
 recreational officer for Irvine,Mr    
 McEwing.He's in charge of organising  
 the festival.                         
{          NOTES}                      
{1.}Money for this comes from          
 Cunninghame District Council.     {   
{2.}The idea came from Mr.McEwing,     
 Mr.Freckleton and Mr.Robertson.       
{3.}A good way of entertaining and     
 attracting people to the town.        
{4.}Held on 18th-22nd of July.         
{5.}Current events for this year-

 fishing trips,breakdancing,stalls etc.
                                       
 Last year was the first festival and  
 it was very successful due mainly to  
 the excellent weather.                
 Perhaps after a number of years the   
 Harbour Festival will become one of   
 Irvine's traditions.                  </content>
