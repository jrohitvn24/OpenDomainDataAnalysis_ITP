		<content> After conducting a survey on the rural
 population in this area we found the  
{majority}of inhabitants were between  
 the age of{16-65}and were connected to
 the{farming industry.}Those who were  
 not, tended to live in larger more    
 expensive housing whereas small farm  
 cottages are inhabited by farm hands. 
 The short distances travelled does not
 entail a dependence on motorised      
 transport. The majority either travel 
 on{foot or cycle}to their place of    
 work. The{commuting section}of the    
 community are mainly engaged in job   
 activities in the{urban section}of    
{Aberdeen.                             
 Due to a small population the demand  
 for shopping facilities was limited   
 therefore{everyday goods}were bought  
 in{Ellon,}whereas{specialised goods   
 were bought in{Aberdeen.
