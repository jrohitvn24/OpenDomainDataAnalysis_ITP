		<title>18A day in my life in Insch.</title>
		<content>  I get up at about eight and put on my
 clothes.I have my breakfast,very often
 a bowl of cornflakes,toast and a cup  
 of tea.Soon I wash and get ready for  
 school at half past nine.             
  The bell rings,so into the sums until
 eleven! Playtime over,we're on to     
 English,and after that it's dinner    
 time.                                 
  I wonder what's for dinner? I soon   
 find out;stovies and oatcakes,and     
 ginger sponge for pudding.            
  In the afternoon there's games and I 
 play netball until playtime.          
  For the last hour and a quarter we   
 work on our project.                  
  I go up to my friend's house and we  
 climb the old pine to see if there's  
 any cones,but there's none. So we play
 on our skates. My tea's at six and I  
 go to my bed at nine.
