 The area is rural, mainly             
 hill-farming.                         
 It includes part of the village of    
 Aberlour, variously known as          
 Charlestown of Aberlour or            
 Aberlour-on-Spey. Aberlour is a       
 planned village, with a wide main     
 street housing shops and tradesmen to 
 serve the surrounding area. The       
 landscape is green and hilly,         
 including patches of pine forest and  
 clumps of birch and other deciduous   
 trees.                                
 The river Spey runs through the area, 
 which also includes much of the       
 scattered community of Edinvillie.    
 The A 95 Granton to Elgin road runs   
 through the village.
