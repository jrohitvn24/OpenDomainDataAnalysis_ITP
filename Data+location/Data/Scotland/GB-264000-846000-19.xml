		<content> Until 1982 cars and lorries crossed   
 the Firth by ferryboat from North     
 Kessock.If there were more than 20 in 
 the queue hurried drivers went 23     
 miles by Beauly.Now people only come  
 for the bus.They go to the grocers or 
 the Post Office and tourists eat at   
 the N.Kessock Hotel.There is a boat   
 centre and a hairdresser.It is a quiet
 highland village.This was a port for  
 Black Isle grain and timber.Here the  
 coal and mail came in.Now there are   
 council houses and a village hall for 
 dances,discos,badminton and the W.R.I.
 People keep beautiful gardens and     
 compete in the annual flower show.    
 The "Maid of the Ferry"is chosen at a 
 summer dance and attends all local    
 functions for a week.In the hotel bar 
 are photographs of ferryboats,even    
 sailing boats,from the last century.
