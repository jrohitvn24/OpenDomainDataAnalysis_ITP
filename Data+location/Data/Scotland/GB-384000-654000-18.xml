		<title>18CHIRNSIDE:JIM CLARK</title>
		<content> Jim Clark was born on 4 March 1936 at 
 Kilmany, Fife. When 6, Jim moved to   
 Edington Mains, Chirnside. At 9 he    
 drove his first car around the farm.  
 He loved cars, and, with the help of 4
 local businessmen, started to compete 
 in motor racing events. In 1957 he won
 his first race, at Charterhall, near  
 Duns. By 1963 he was the World Grand  
 Prix Champion, a title he won again in
 1965. He won 25 World Grand Prix races
 and many other honours. In 1968 on 7  
 April at Hockenheim, he was tragically
 killed in a Formula 2 race. He crashed
 into a clump of trees and was killed  
 instantly. Jim Clark is remembered in 
 Chirnside by the Jim Clark Memorial   
 Clock and his grave in the Parish     
 Churchyard. The Jim Clark Edington    
 Trophy is presented every year at the 
 school sports to the house winning the
 most points in track events.          </content>
