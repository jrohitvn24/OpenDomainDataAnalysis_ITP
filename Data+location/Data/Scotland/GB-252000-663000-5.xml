		<title>05GOVAN PUBLIC V's POLICE</title>
		<content> Although the police are seen to have a
 difficult job,they are unpopular with 
 teenagers who feel harassed by the    
 police moving them on from street     
 corners where they gather often just  
 to talk. The police are rough in      
 manner, often coarse in speech and    
 somtimes manhandle youngsters.  They  
 are also blamed for providing         
 inefficient support to house holders  
 and for answering 999 calls tardily.  
    In their defence,much of the theft 
 and vandalism in the area is committed
 by teenagers, often linked to drugs   
 and glue-sniffing,although the latter 
 is on the decrease.  Open support for 
 the police by providing evidence in   
 court is rare sinse the public are    
 afraid  of recrimination from those   
 accused.
