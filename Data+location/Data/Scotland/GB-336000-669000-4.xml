		<content> NORTH ELPHINSTONE FARM IS ABOUT HALF A
 MILE FROM ELPHINSTONE.IT IS QUITE A   
 BIG FARM WITH FIELDS.MOST OF THE      
 FIELDS GROW CORN.THERE ARE TWO BIG    
 SILOS ON THE FARM AND TWO BIG BARNS   
 NEXT TO THE SILOS.ONE OF THEM HAS     
 TRACTORS IN IT AND THE OTHER HAS BULLS
 IN IT.THE FARMER WHO OWNS IT IS CALLED
 MALCOM HARVEY.IN THE SUMMER I GET A   
 JOB CLEARING OUT THE GRAIN BINS AND   
 TAKING THE WILD OATS OUT OF THE CORN  
 FIELDS.THERE IS A LITTLE SHED ON THE  
 FARM WHERE THE THE FARMER KEEPS CALVES
 AND I CAN FEED THEM WITH A BABY'S     
 BOTTLE WITH MILK IN IT.PEOPLE PLAY ON 
 THE BALES WHEN THE FARMER IS NOT      
 LOOKING.
