		<content> Our block has an aging population.    
 This is reflected in the small number 
 of children of school age and younger:
 1 Pre-school(0-5years)...7            
 2 Primary(5-12years)...9              
 3 Secondary(12-18years)...5           
 EMPLOYMENT                            
 There is very little local employment 
 except in the farming/crofting        
 field.Farming is usually a family     
 concern and crofting is usually only a
 part-time occupation-a serious        
 pastime,only the elderly make make it 
 their full employment.There are a few 
 jobs in the service industries eg.    
 teacher,postmaster,postman,shop       
 assistants,home-help and lighthouse   
 keeper.Most of the young people move  
 away to try to find employment.       
 Portnahaven and Port Wemyss were      
 essentially fishing/crofting          
 communities.                          </content>
