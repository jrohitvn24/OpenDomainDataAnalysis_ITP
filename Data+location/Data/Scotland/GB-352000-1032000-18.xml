		<title>18STANDING STONES IN EDAY</title>
		<content>    Among the many archaeological sites
 on Eday, are a few standing stones.   
 One of these is above the Burn of     
 Mussetter. It is situated on the high 
 saddle that separates the valley of   
 Mussetter from the Skaill area.       
    This standing stone is a pointed   
 one which is said to have been thrown 
 down and re-erected some years before 
 1928.                                 
    It is now leaning to the north     
 east. It is about 3.2m long and       
 measures o.7m by o.1m at ground level.
    No-one knows why these stones were 
 erected,the origins are lost in the   
 mist of time.
