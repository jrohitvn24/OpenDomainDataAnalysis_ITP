 Limerigg village owes its existance   
 to coal mining. The pits of the area  
 reached their peak in the latter half 
 of the 19th century. The growth in    
 population brought with it the demand 
 for schooling and organised religion. 
 At the beginning  of the  1880's      
 Limerigg mission was started through  
 the good offices of Slamannan Parish  
 Church. By 1885 the church building   
 was in being; built from corrugated   
 iron. The first missionary was the    
 Rev.George Waugh,B.D.; and the parish 
 minister was the Rev.Robert Horne. Rev
 Horne is well remembered for the fact 
 that his son Robert reached high      
 office in the British Government,     
 serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer
 during the First World War.           
 With the decline in mining the        
 population decreased very rapidly.    </content>
