 The nurses' job in Crawford today is  
 to help people get better and to help 
 children to grow strong and healthy.  
 Two nurses work in Crawford at        
 present.They are Nurse Moffat and     
 Nurse Park.                           
 Nursing today has many advantages.    
 There are modern medicines and more   
 doctors and nurses than before.       
 The surgery used to be the nurse's    
 cottage.Nowadays quite a few doctors  
 come to Crawford from Douglas and     
 Moffat.They have a lot of patients so 
 they use the surgery as their         
 consulting room.Surgery is held on    
 Mondays,Wednesdays and Fridays.Nurse  
 Moffat and Nurse Park help the        
 doctors.They both live in Crawford but
 cover a much larger area as they have 
 to visit other villages.
