		<title>02MOUNT PLEASANT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{  Mount Pleasant Primary School}is in 
 the town of{Thurso}on Scotland's far  
 north coast.It is situated in the     
 County of{Caithness.                  
   The school was opened in 1966 to    
 cope with the large increase in       
 population brought about by the       
 placing of the{Dounreay Atomic Reactor
 in the area.                          
   Mount Pleasant is housed in a modern
 well constructed building. It is      
 fortunate that at the time of building
 there were no constraints on spending 
 and so materials and facilities were  
 provided that would not have been     
 forthcoming today.                    
   The school was built to house two   
 streams of pupils and placed in ample 
 playing fields. Now with falling roll 
 it houses a single stream of pupils   
 and a nursery unit giving a total     
 child population of 240.              </content>
