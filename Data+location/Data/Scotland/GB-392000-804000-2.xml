		<content> As a result of the oil boom the west  
 end of Aberdeen is one of the most    
 expensive housing areas not only      
 within the City but within Britain.The
 houses are built of granite.Typical   
 house styles are tenements,large      
 terraced houses,detached villas,and   
 bungalows.A survey at Aberdeen        
 Solicitor's Property Centre 7/6/85    
 revealed that the average asking price
 for two apartment renovated tenement  
 flats was Â£25.000.Most of the large   
 detached houses along Albyn Place,    
 Carden Place,Queen's Road have been   
 converted into oil related offices,   
 doctor's surgeries,hotels and law     
 offices owing to the prestigious      
 nature of the buildings and the ease  
 of parking.As this is a designated    
 Conservation Area developers must     
 conform to certain planning           
 regulations and standards.            </content>
