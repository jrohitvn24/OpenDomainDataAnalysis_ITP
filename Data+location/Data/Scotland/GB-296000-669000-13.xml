		<title>13Interview with retired lady</title>
		<content>    We decided to interview Mrs.Craig, 
 a retired lady, who has lived in our  
 area for a number of years.           
      She lives with her husband in    
 Napier Avenue and has two sons, who   
 are now at University.                
      Mrs. Craig used to work at our   
 school and was a Primary 5 teacher.   
 We put some questions to her about her
 life and how retiring affected her.   
                                       
 Q:On average, what time do you get up 
 in the morning?                       
 A:Seven o'clock.                      
 Q:What do you do to keep busy in the  
 morning?                              
 A:Housework and I take college classes
 in computing.                         
 Q:Do you find you have masses of spare
 time?                                 
 A:No, I always have something to do.
