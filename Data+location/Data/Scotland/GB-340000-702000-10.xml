		<title>10Robinson Crusoe.</title>
		<content> In Lower Largo there is a statue on   
 the side of a house near the coast.   
 The figure is dressed in skins and    
 looks out across Largo Bay.The statue 
 is on the site of the house where     
 "Robinson Crusoe" was born in 1676.   
   Alexander Selkirk was the son of a  
 cobbler and a wild and adventurous    
 boy.His sense of adventure inspired   
 the author Daniel Defoe to write the  
 'Crusoe' story.Selkirk left home and  
 travelled widely by boat.As sailing   
 master of the 'Cinque Ports' he argued
 with officers and was placed ashore on
 an island called Juan Fernandez. There
 he stayed in solitude for 4 years and 
 4 months until discovered by an       
 English sea captain who returned him  
 to England where he told his story to 
 Defoe who immortalised him in the     
 'Robinson Crusoe' book.
