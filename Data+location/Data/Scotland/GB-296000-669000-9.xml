		<title>09School Life Now and Then.</title>
		<content>    School life has changed in many    
 ways.   We decided to write a report  
 on school life.   We entitled it      
 "School Life Past and Presant".   We  
 interviewed an adult and a child who  
 had attended our school.              
      We found out that both adult and 
 child enjoyed attending this school.We
 discovered that the main cause for the
 child today enjoying school is        
 maths but the adult enjoyed the       
 aesthetics subjects like art,sewing   
 etc.                                  
      During the adult's childhood they
 did not use computers at school but   
 today we do.We asked two children if  
 they enjoyed working on the computer  
 both answered" yes" so perhaps that is
 one of the many reasons children enjoy
 school today.
