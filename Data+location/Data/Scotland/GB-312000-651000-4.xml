		<content> Our school has a large playground that
 has a big grassed area on which       
 parents have built an adventure       
 play-ground for us so that we can     
 makeup our own games eg Space Travel, 
 Horse Riding,Houses etc.              
    Roller boots are very fashionable  
 just now with girls. These are        
 roller skates attached to boots. We   
 skate on the smooth part of the       
 playground and in the bicycle shed.   
 Girls of all ages like to roller      
 skate.                                
    We play many other games according 
 to our age.  The little ones like     
 to play with dolls as babies. Tig is  
 very popular with both boys and girls 
 but most boys of all ages like to play
 football. The older boys are allowed  
 to go down to the sports field when   
 the weather is suitable.
