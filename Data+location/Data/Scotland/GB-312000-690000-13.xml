		<title>13Kirkton Farm.</title>
		<content> Kirkton Farm is on the N.W.side of    
 Cowdenbeath near the B917 road leading
 from Cowdenbeath to Kelty.The farm    
 cottage is opposite what used to be   
 the manse for Kirkford church.My uncle
 works on the farm which has cows and  
 pigs,a few ducks and chickens and     
 about 30 sheep.My uncle's job is      
 working on the tractors,moving the    
 hay and manure around the farm and    
 taking hay to other farms.The farmer  
 sometimes gives my uncle a few eggs to
 take home.The farmer owns two collies 
 which he uses to round up the sheep   
 and a cat to keep away the rats and   
 mice.
