		<title>16Leven Scouts at Camp.</title>
		<content> On a Friday evening in early May,1st  
 Leven Scouts set off for 'Durie       
 Estate' north of the town ,for a      
 weekend camp.                         
 On arriving at the site we put up all 
 the tents;there was a tent,a cooking  
 shelter and a hike tent for each      
 patrol.                               
 On Saturday we had to get up early to 
 cook our own breakfast of bacon and   
 eggs.After breakfast we made useful   
 camp gadgets and after that we        
 prepared and ate dinner.Later, we went
 on a nature walk to Silverburn and    
 spent an hour there.In the evening our
 parents came to visit the camp.       
 We only stayed half the day on Sunday.
 We took all of the equipment down,    
 then we packed all of our personal    
 kit and walked home.{
