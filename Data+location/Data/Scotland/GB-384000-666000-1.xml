		<content> Coldingham Moor is the wetlands area  
 of Berwickshire, lying 3 iels to the  
 north west of Coldingha village. This 
 common Moor is very exposed to the    
 weather, at a height of 600ft.The     
 greatest part of the moor is in       
 its natural state with wed soils,which
 are cold bluish clay and very rocky.  
 This     and barren moor has several  
 types of peatmosses, and grasses on   
 the wetter pars. The land was once    
 used for collecting peat, but is now  
 used for grazing. Despite the ares    
 ideal location on the coast for       
 tourist development, this is lost     
 through it relative unattractiveness  
 although there is a caravansite. A    
 predominant feature of this area is   
 the abundance of redundant farm       
 buildings which scar the landscape on 
 land which was at one timme fertile,  
 is now useless for farming.           </content>
