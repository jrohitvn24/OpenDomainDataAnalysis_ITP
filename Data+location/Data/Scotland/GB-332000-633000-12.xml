		<content> THIS YEAR THE TENTH TRAQUAIR FAIR WILL
 TAKE PLACE IN THE GROUNDS OF TRAQUAIR 
 HOUSE, THE OLDEST INHABITED HOUSE IN  
 SCOTLAND. FROM SMALL BEGINNINGS THIS  
 FAIR HAS BECOME A LARGE AND COLOURFUL 
 EVENT. IT IS ORGANISED BY THE TRAQUAIR
 CRAFTWORKERS AND OWNERS OF TRAQUAIR   
 HOUSE AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING  
 REGISTERED AS A CHARITABLE TRUST TO   
 PROMOTE INTEREST IN THE ARTS, CRAFTS, 
 MUSIC AND DRAMA. DONATIONS AND        
 COMPLIMENTARY TICKETS ARE GIVEN TO    
 LOCAL HOMES AND CHARITIES. THE EVENT  
 IS WITHOUT PARALLEL IN THE BORDERS,   
 WHERE CRAFTSMEN GATHER TO DEMONSTRATE 
 AND SELL THEIR WARES, AND FRINGE      
 THEATRE GROUPS, MUSICIANS, PUPPETEERS,
 MIME ARTISTES AND PERFORMERS OF ALL   
 KINDS PROVIDE A GLORIOUS INFORMAL     
 DEMONSTRATION OF THEIR OWN TALENTS,   
 CREATING A MAGICAL ATMOSPHERE OF A    
 VERY SPECIAL COUNTRY FAIR.            </content>
