		<title>03THE EFFECT OF THE OIL</title>
		<content> Midmar has always been a rural area,  
 most of the land being farmland.Some  
 people have lived and worked here all 
 their lives.Some farmers never moved  
 far from the district, only to take   
 their cows to mart on Fridays at      
 Aberdeen or Alford.More people have   
 moved into Midmar because of the oil  
 discovered in the North Sea off       
 Aberdeen.The oil companies such as BP 
 Shell and Total have situated their   
 bases in Aberdeen.Some of the oil     
 peole prefer living in the country so 
 builders are building bigger and more 
 expensive houses for their benefit.The
 area has changed, in that a wholegroup
 of expensive houses has been built    
 near the school and many old steadings
 and houses are being converted into   
 large dwellings.
