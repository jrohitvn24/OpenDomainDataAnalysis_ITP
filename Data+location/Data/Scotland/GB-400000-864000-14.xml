		<title>14Maggie's Hoosie, Fraserburgh</title>
		<content> Maggie's Hoosie is in Cairnbulg, near 
 Fraserburgh. It is very old. It is a  
 traditional fisher's cottage which is 
 going to ruins. Some people want to   
 knock it down. The Banff &amp; Buchan     
 District Council has to spend Â£l0,000 
 to have it restored. It has no water, 
 no sanitation, no gas and no          
 electricity. Cars can't manoever      
 beside the hoosie so a wall will be   
 knocked down. It would cost Â£l,200 for
 wages for a caretaker to bring it up  
 to tourism standard. It has a thatched
 roof. The earth floor has a peat fire 
 on it and the fire is just lit on the 
 floor. There is a crane from the wall 
 that swings the kettle over the fire. 
 Maggie's full name was Margaret       
 Duthie.
