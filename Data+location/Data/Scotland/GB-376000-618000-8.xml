		<title>08WORKING DOGS--BORDER COLLIES</title>
		<content> In the area around Hownam,in Scotland 
 almost all the dogs are rough coated  
 border collies,which mostly do a full 
 days work with cattle or sheep. Some  
 old dogs past working are quite often 
 kept as pets.Television has made a    
 star of the collie,and at last every  
 one can appreciate the power these    
 dogs have,the understanding with their
 masters.The help of a good dog is in- 
 valuable,the power of his eye can turn
 the most stubborn of sheep.However now
 some shepherds prefer to check their  
 flocks on motorbike,or in a landrover,
 and one wonders if the collie will be-
 come obsolete.The International Sheep-
 dog Society  keeps a record of most   
 collies, thus breeding can be traced  
 back for many generations.It is wize  
 to have dogs eye-tested at 2 years old
 for retina trouble,and if it is found 
 breeding from this dog is bad policy. </content>
