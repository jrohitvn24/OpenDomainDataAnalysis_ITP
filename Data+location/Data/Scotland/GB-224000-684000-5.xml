		<title>05CHANGES IN THE HOMES OF RHU.</title>
		<content> With changing life_styles comes the   
 need to alter the style of homes.With 
 the ever_increasing cost of           
 maintaining and running the mansion   
 houses,many have been converted either
 to form hotels or other institutions  
 such as homes for the elderly or      
 children,however at present, of the   
 two children's homes we had in our    
 area,one closed down 3  years ago and 
 there are plans to close the other,   
 Blairvadach, in the near future as the
 trend is for children to be fostered  
 rather than institutionalised.Many of 
 the cottages,whilst retaining their   
 original character,have been          
 modernised and some of the villas have
 been split into upper and lower flats.
 The development of the Faslane Naval  
 Base has also led to the building of  
 an estate of terraced;semi_detached   
 and detached houses and maisonettes.  </content>
