 This farm has an acreage of {178 acres
 and it is fallow area for Aberdeen    
 Angus,Char Leys and commercial cattle.
 Sheep are also kept on the farm. The  
 owners are in the Smithfield and are  
 regular visitors to the Royal Highland
 Show and Smithfield.                  
 There is not much of a winter death   
 rate as the livestock is kept inside  
 all this time.{Some crop}is grown, but
 it is mainly a livestock farm.        
 The College{buys}all its {fruit and   
{vegetables}from this farm, but        
 business profits still go up and down.
 The College does not cause any        
 problems for Wester Campsie, nor do   
 poachers.                             
 There is not much leisure time        
 available in this job and religion is 
 not a strong factor in life.
