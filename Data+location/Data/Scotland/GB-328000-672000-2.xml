		<content> The shops in and around{Portobello    
{High Street}make up the{main shopping 
{centre}in our D block. The centre     
 provides a fairly comprehensive range 
 of convenience and durable goods.     
 However it suffers from traffic       
 congestion and restricted parking.    
 Recently its supremacy has been       
 challenged by the new{Asda hypermarket
 on the city outskirts.                
  Some 4,500 people work in the area,  
 the main{sources of employment}being  
 the recently built national government
 offices at Meadowbank, the retail     
 trade and various light industries and
 warehouses on the{industrial estates  
 at Seafield and Baileyfield.          
  Extensive areas of{railway land}are  
 also a feature of the area, including 
 the large container depot at          
 Portobello and the service depot at   
 Craigentinny.                         </content>
