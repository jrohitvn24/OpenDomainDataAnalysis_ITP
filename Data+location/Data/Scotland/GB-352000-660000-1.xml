		<title>01Hopes Reservoir</title>
		<content> The main feature is the Hopes         
 Reservoir created by the dam built    
 across this flat-bottomed valley.  It 
 is surrounded by hills, the highest   
 527 metres lying to the west is an OS 
 triangulation point.  The hills are   
 steep-sided and flat on top.  Water   
 drains from the hills by narrow fast  
 flowing streams into the reservoir.   
 Heather is the main ground cover on   
 the hills with some gorse and ferns on
 the lower slopes.  Trees, mainly birch
 appear on the sheltered banks of the  
 reservoir and in the valley to the    
 east of the dam.  A mettled track     
 leads to the reservoir and a rough    
 track follows its southern edge to a  
 sheep pen.  There is only one house-a 
 shepherds cottage.  the main uses of  
 the area are sheep farming and        
 recreational activities such as hill  
 walking, fishing &amp; shooting.          </content>
