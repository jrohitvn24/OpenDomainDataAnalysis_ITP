		<content> Religious beliefs in Kennethmont are  
 mainly Christian. The church in       
 Kennethmont is Church Of Scotland.    
 Some years ago church attendances were
 high, but more recently due to a      
 steady decline in attendance the      
 churches of Kennethmont and Gartly    
 were merged under one minister. In the
 Spring of 1985 due to further falls in
 attendance Kennethmont, Gartly, Clatt 
 and Rhynie parishes were merged to    
 form one new parish of "Noth". All    
 four church buildings are used at     
 present but services are only held    
 once a fortnight in each church; Clatt
 and Rhynie one Sunday, Kennethmont and
 Gartly the next. A new manse is to be 
 built in Kennethmont.                 
    The majority of the population do  
 not attend church regularly,if at all.
 Religion seems to be less relevant to 
 people nowadays.                      </content>
