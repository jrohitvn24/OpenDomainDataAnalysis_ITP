		<title>05A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SARAH</title>
		<content> I USUALLY GET UP AT 7AM., GET DRESSED 
 FOR SCHOOL AND RUN DOWNSTAIRS.  I     
 UNLOCK THE BACK DOOR, PUTTING ON MY   
 RIDING BOOTS.  I RUN TO MY PONY'S     
 STABLE, GRAB HIS HEADCOLLAR AND THEN  
 RUN ALONG TO THE GATE OF HIS          
 FIELD, WHERE I CALL HIM TO ME.   I    
 THEN TAKE HIM ALONG TO HIS STABLE TO  
 BRUSH HIM.  THEN I GO INSIDE FOR MY   
 BREAKFAST.                            
 READY FOR SCHOOL, I GO TO THE BOTTOM  
 OF THE FARM ROAD WITH MY LITTLE       
 BROTHER TO CATCH THE SCHOOL BUS.  WE  
 ARE IN SCHOOL FROM 9AM. TILL 3.15PM.  
 WITH 1 HOUR FOR LUNCH.  SOMETIMES I   
 TAKE A PACKED LUNCH OR I MAY HAVE     
 SCHOOL DINNERS.  I WORK AT LANGUAGE,  
 MATHS, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, MUSIC,  
 ART OR P.E.                           
 BEFORE TEA, I RIDE MY PONY.  AFTER    
 TEA, I DO MY HOMEWORK AND AM READY FOR
 BED BY 8.30PM.                        </content>
