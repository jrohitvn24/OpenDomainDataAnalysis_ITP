 much{wood}is burnt tho' becoming more 
 expensive since families can no longer
 gather a year's supply of fallen      
 wood.Merchants operate and logs cost  
 from Â£30-Â£40 per tractor load.Stoves  
 may also be fuelled by{coal products} 
 or oil,used for cooking and to heat   
 radiators throughout the home.Others  
 prefer an open fire in the family room
 and electric or calor gas heaters     
 elsewhere,cooking on gas or electric  
 cookers.Larger buildings may have     
{oil-fired or calor gas}central heating
 and a few homes are all{electric.}    
 Farm and forestry machinery is driven 
 by{diesel oil}and all local cars use  
{petrol.}
