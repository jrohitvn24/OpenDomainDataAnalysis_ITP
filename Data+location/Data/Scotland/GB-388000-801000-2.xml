		<title>02The Shakkin Briggie</title>
		<content> The Shakkin Briggie is a local bridge 
 on the River Dee with an intresting   
 background.It was constructed so that 
 Cults people could make the journey   
 to St.Devenicks Church.               
 The proper name was Morisons          
 suspension bridge but it became       
 popularly known as the Shakkin        
 Briggie.The Shakkin Briggie's funds to
 keep it in order ran out.It was left  
 to rot and eventually the South side  
 of the bridge collapsed.              
 There is a fence to stop people       
 climbing onto the bridge.The coucil   
 saw that it was unsafe and took the   
 planks out leaving only the main      
 structure.There is only one quarter of
 this 19th century bridge left.
