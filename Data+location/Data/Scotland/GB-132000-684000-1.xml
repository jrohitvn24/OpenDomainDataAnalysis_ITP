		<content> "Island of Seals" - uninhabited island
 off the shore of Oransay, Inner       
 Hebrides - has rovided secure breeding
 grounds for Grey Atlantic Seal for    
 almost a century and hundreds may be  
 observed in the breeding season (late 
 September through October). Good rough
 grazing produced excellent lamb but   
 now abandoned and a large population  
 of rates is supported in part by ample
 supply of gulls eggs.  Heron's breed  
 in the ruins of a kelpers cottage, and
 there is a large, well developed otter
 holt.  An "erratic" bouler is reputed 
 to  hail from Iceland by Glacier      
 deposit.  Unmarked grave of an Italian
 internee washed ashore after  his     
 transport sunk by enemy action.  Last 
 chief of Clan Mc Phie slain here after
 his hiding place given away by clouds 
 of seagulls C1620.
