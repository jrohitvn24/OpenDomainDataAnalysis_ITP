		<content> Waternish is a peninsula in North-West
 Skye. Its population is fairly        
 scattered. It is very rural. Many of  
 the inhabitants are in-comers to the  
 area; having moved here from the north
 of England. There seems to be no      
 apparent reason for this. Many local  
 people have moved away in search of   
 work. One reason people might have for
 moving here is that there is a healthy
 and peaceful environment. The pace of 
 life is much slower. People might move
 away to be nearer shops or hospitals. 
 Some move because they don't like     
 living in isolated places. The        
 community has a fair cross-section of 
 ages. There are eighteen pupils of    
 secondary school age; sixteen of      
 primary age and twelve of pre-school  
 age. The oldest person in the         
 community is a lady of ninety-four    
 years of age.                         </content>
