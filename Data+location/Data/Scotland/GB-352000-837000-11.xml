		<title>11THE HUNTLY FIRE BRIGADE</title>
		<content> The town of Huntly has one fire       
 station with two fire tenders.  The   
 station is manned by part-time fire   
 men on a 24 hour stand-by system.     
 Each man has a radio pager with a     
 range of 7 miles which is activated   
 from the Head quarters in Aberdeen.   
 Huntly has a total of 16 fire men.    
 Both fire tenders carry hoses, ladders
 ,axes,foam and other equipment.  Each 
 mahine carries a crew of 6 men.  Most 
 tenders have a water tank large enough
 to hold 400 gallons of water.  The    
 uniform consists of a black jacket and
 trousers with a black peaked cap, but 
 when attending emergency calls the men
 wear leggings, a fire jacket,         
 wellington boots and safety helmet.   
 Call outs vary from month to month but
 on average the Huntly crew answer 60  
 calls per year.
