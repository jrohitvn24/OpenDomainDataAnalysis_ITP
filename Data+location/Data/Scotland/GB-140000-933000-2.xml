 Laxdale is primarily a rural district 
 and a crofting township. This leads to
 the majority of the houses having a   
 certain defined architectural pattern 
 as laid down by the{Crofters'         
{Commission.}This Commission is the    
 main governing body of the            
 crofters. It issues grants and        
 low-interest loans to crofters to help
 them build new homes and carry out    
 improvements to older ones. The       
 pre-war 1930 houses are of the two-   
 storey villa-type design. The recently
 built houses are of the one-storey    
 bungalow design.  All the crofting    
 land in the district is owned by a    
 body called the{Stornoway Trust}from  
 whom the crofter rents his land.  Thus
 the majority of the house-holders in  
 the area are tenants.                 </content>
