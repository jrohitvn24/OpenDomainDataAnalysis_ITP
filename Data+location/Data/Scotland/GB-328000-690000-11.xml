		<title>11RAVENSCRAIG CASTLE</title>
		<content> Ravenscraig Castle was started in 1460
 and finished in 1464. It was built by 
 James II as a coastal defence against 
 the English. It was the first castle  
 to be built for defence by artillery. 
 The most famous cannon was Mons Meg,  
 now at Edinburgh Castle. The tower of 
 Ravenscriag Castle was the residence  
 of Queen Mary of Gueldres. In it were 
 three rooms, her living room, her bed 
 room and a rest room. The water for   
 the castle came from a forty feet deep
 well. The kitchens were at the back of
 the castle. The walls of the castle   
 were 14 feet thick.                   
 After Queen Mary's death James did a  
 swap. He exchanged the castle for the 
 Orkney islands which were owned by the
 Sinclair family. The castle has been  
 taken over by the Department of the   
 Environment.
