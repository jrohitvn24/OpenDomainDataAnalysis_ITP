		<title>09Balmullo Gala Day Floats</title>
		<content> On the actual day, lorries are        
 decorated by various clubs in the     
 village and there is a procession of  
 the "floats" around the neighbourhood.
 Prizes are awarded to the three floats
 which are judged to be the most       
 imaginative or amusing.   This year,  
 the Cub Scouts' float won.   The theme
 was "Johnson's Babies" and they all   
 dressed up as babies in a playpen!    
 You can imagine how funny it was to   
 spot our eight to eleven- year old    
 classmates wearing nappies and bonnets
 and waving rattles, teddies and       
 dummies!   Our school float had a     
 theme of Twentieth Century Fashion and
 our parents helped us to make outfits 
 to represent different times during   
 this century.   We had everything from
 Edwardian ladies to Punks!
