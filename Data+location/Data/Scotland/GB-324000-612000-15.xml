		<title>15A TYPICAL DAY IN ETTRICK.</title>
		<content>   A shepherd's job has to change with 
 all the seasons.                      
   The shepherd gets up at 7.00 has his
 breakfast and is ready to go out of   
 the house at 7.30.                    
   He goes round the hill to check that
 no sheep are lambing with difficulty. 
 He has feeding bins out on the hills. 
 He feeds them because there isn't     
 enough grass to feed them on and to   
 make milk to feed the lambs with.     
   After he has done all that he goes  
 round the lambing fields and feeds    
 sheep there.After dinner he goes to   
 the nearby sheep and does a final     
 check that no sheep are lambing.He has
 his afternoon tea and goes further up 
 the hill to do a final check until the
 morning this is the busiest time of   
 the year.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
