 of Scotland and 1 Free Church of      
 Scotland.7 miles up the glen there    
 is an Episcopalian Church and nearby  
 in{Cannich}is a Roman Catholic Church.
    To examine the state of religion in
 this area we conducted a{survey}

{multi_denominational.}With 46%        
 belonging to Church of Scotland,23% to
 the Roman Catholic Church, 15% to the 
 Free Church, 2% to the Episcopalian   
 Church. The rest did not know which   
 religion they belonged to! We then    
 asked them how often they went to     
{church}:40% went occasionally,33% went
 often but 27% never went.We then asked
 if they went to Sunday School:28% did 
 go but 72% did not.Finally we asked   
 them"Do you believe in God?":55% said 
 yes,22% said no,24% said don't know.  </content>
