		<title>11SHOPPING SURVEY IN BALLATER</title>
		<content>       Most of the people that we asked
 during our survey were people who     
 lived locally.The people that didn't  
 live locally came from a number of    
 towns and cities throughout Britain   
 e.g. Glasgow and London.  We asked the
 ones that did live here how many times
 a week they shopped in the Mace food  
 shop; most of them shopped every day. 
 A lot of the people that we asked were
 over 50 and unable to do their        
 shopping in Aberdeen (40 miles away), 
 but the others could drive in more    
 often.                                
 The people that didn't live here were 
 visitors; most had been here before   
 and were staying more than 2 weeks. We
 asked everyone if they thought that   
 there were enough shops in Ballater,  
 most of them did.  Most of the people 
 were female and over 50 years of age.
