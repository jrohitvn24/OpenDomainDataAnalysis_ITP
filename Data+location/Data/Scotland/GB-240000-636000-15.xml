		<content> FARMERS IN THE KILMARNOCK AREA HAVE   
 BEEN BADLY HIT BY THE  WETTEST SUMMER 
 IN LIVING MEMORY WHICH HAS LEFT FIELDS
 AND PASTURE LAND VERY WET AND MUDDY.  
 MANY GRASS TYPE CROPS HAVE BEEN       
 DECIMATED,KNOCKED OVER BY HEAVY RAIN  
 THE CROPS HAVE NOT RECOVERED. MANY    
 LOCAL FARMERS FACE GREAT PROBLEMS     
 ESPECIALLY IN TRYING TO FEED THEIR    
 DAIRY HERDS DURING THE WINTER. MOST   
 AREAS' SILAGE CROP HAS BEEN CUT, BUT  
 BECAUSE OF CONTINUAL RAIN IT HAS NOT  
 DRIED AND IS THEREFORE NO USE AS      
 WINTER FEED.                          
    FARMERS MAY BE FORCED TO IMPORT    
 LARGE QUANTITIES OF FEED OR SLAUGHTER 
 THEIR HERDS.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
