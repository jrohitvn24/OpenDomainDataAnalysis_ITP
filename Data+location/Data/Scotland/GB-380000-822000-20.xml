		<title>20People of Bourtie</title>
		<content> Newcomers to Bourtie often remark that
 it takes ages to be accepted into the 
 community - that everyone seems       
 self-reliant.  From the Bourtie point 
 of view, may newcomers come to this   
 area to take advantage of earth's     
 natural resources; not to put much    
 back into the land.  Many new families
 choose Bourtie because of its rolling 
 vistas, unimpeded views of Bennachie  
 and accessibility to Aberdeen.        
 Because of their involvement in North 
 Sea Oil, many stay a couple of years  
 and thn leae.  Bourtie people are orn,
 work and die here.  Television plays a
 part in influencing lives; in a world 
 dominated by business an acquisiton,  
 it can be seen as portraying fact; in 
 Bourtie it is seen as portraying      
 fiction.  Bourtie's real world        
 consists of the primeaval elements:   
 air, fire, water earth.               </content>
