		<content>    Farms in the area concentrate on   
 pastoral farming for sound commercial 
 gain .Apart from Patterton Farm which 
 is a busy working farm the other three
 former farms now rent out land for    
 livestock .                           
    90% of the farm land is enclosed   
 rough grazing with the field size     
 generally small and with shelter      
 afforded by rows of mixed deciduous   
 trees .The upkeep of fencing in the   
 wake of vandalism and natural damage  
 is a major task .                     
    Farms concentrate in the main on   
 dairy farming with Patterton Farm the 
 main focus for milk production .Small 
 quantities of barley and hay are grown
 mainly for winter feed .Sheep are also
 grazed where suitable fencing has been
 installed .Paisley Market is the focal
 point for buying and selling in the   
 area .                                </content>
