 have a G.P.Room,a Resource Room and   
 two classrooms.The G.P.Room is used   
 for gym and we have our shool dinners 
 there.In the Resource Room we have our
 school library.Primaries 1,2,3 and 4  
 use the largest classroom and         
 Primaries 5,6 and 7 use the other     
 room.                                 
 There are four teachers in our school.
