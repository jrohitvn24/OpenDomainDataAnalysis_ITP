		<title>12ATTITUDES IN OUR BLOCK</title>
		<content> WE COMPARED THE ATTITUDES OF PEOPLE IN
 TWO DIFFERENT AREAS,GRACEMOUNT(A LARGE
 COUNCIL ESTATE)AND WINTON(A NEWLY     
 DEVELOPED PRIVATE ESTATE).            
 IN GRACEMOUNT PEOPLE WERE QUITE HAPPY 
 WITH THE AMENITIES PROVIDED BUT DID   
 SHOW A CONCERN FOR THE LARGE AMOUNT OF
 VANDALISM IN THE AREA.                
 HOWEVER,IN WINTON THERE WAS CONCERN   
 WITH THE LACK OF AMENITIES ESPECIALLY 
 SHOPS,SCHOOLS,PLAYGROUNDS AND         
 LIBRARIES.THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT       
 EXPRESSED REGARDED THE COST OF THE    
 RATES IN THE WINTON AREA.
