		<title>06The Village Nurse.</title>
		<content> Years ago the church or nuns helped   
 the poor in need.When Queen Victoria  
 celebrated her Golden Jubilee in 1887,
 all the women of Great Britain gave   
 one shilling(5p) as a gift to the     
 Queen.She was asked what she would    
 like done with all the money.She      
 decided to form an association to     
 train nurses.This helped the elderly  
 and the poor.This is how district     
 nursing started.                      
 Nurse Moffat has been the nurse in    
 Crawford for about 40 years.She is    
 soon to retire.When she first began   
 she had no car or bicycle and had to  
 walk.Sometimes she had to hitch hike  
 on lorries to Abington.She was        
 allowed to hire a car to go long      
 distances.When she went to Camps she  
 got a lift with the school car.       
 Nowadays things are much better.
