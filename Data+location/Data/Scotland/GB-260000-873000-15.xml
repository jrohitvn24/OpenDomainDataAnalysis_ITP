		<title>15Ardross: local government</title>
		<content> A two tier local government structure 
 operates in the area with the local   
 councillor, who happens to represent  
 the area on both District and         
 Regional councils, living within the  
 area covered by this block.           
 The Regional Council , covering the   
 whole Highland Region, operates from  
 its administrative base in Inverness. 
 The District Council has its base in  
 the town of Dingwall, about 8 miles   
 away.                                 
 The local councillor's family were    
 the owners of the castle until its    
 sale in 1977. The family still play a 
 very active part in the life of the   
 community and a great deal of support 
 was given during the compilation of   
 this report by the local councillor.
