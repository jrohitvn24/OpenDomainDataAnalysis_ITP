		<title>15CONSERVATION in EDINBURGH</title>
		<content> Originally the Grange area was a large
 country estate.  Most of the houses   
 were large villas.  A lot of these    
 have been split into flats, converted 
 into schools, small hospitals,        
 nursing homes or hotels, or           
 demolished. Oswald house was          
 demolished in the late sixties and    
 Oswald Court now stands on the site - 
 a complex of modern flats.Of 17       
 Victorian houses, 7 were divided to   
 flats.13 of these large houses had    
 had maids rooms.Cleaners were employed
 twice a week in 6 of the houses.      
                                       
 Grange Association was formed in 1980 
 to protect trees and buildings        
 in the area and is well supported     
 locally.  Trees cannot be cut down,   
 buildings altered or new houses built 
 without strict rules being adhered    
 to.                                   </content>
