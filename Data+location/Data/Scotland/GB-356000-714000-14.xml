		<title>14BOARHILLS POPULATION</title>
		<content> Although Boarhills was initially a    
 farming settlement,many of the houses 
 now belong to people who work in      
 St.Andrews which is only three miles  
 to the North East of Boarhills.       
    As with all commuter villages,     
 house prices tend to become rather    
 inflated. This is because commuters   
 enjoy the attractive setting of a     
 rural village and yet, in the case of 
 Boarhills, they have only a ten minute
 drive along quiet country roads to St.
 Andrews. Many of the commuters work in
 the University of St. Andrews.
