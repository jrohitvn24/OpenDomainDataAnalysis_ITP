		<content> The population of both East Wemyss and
 Buckhaven have fluctuated over the    
 years depending on which local        
 industry was flourishing. Today few of
 the people living in the villages     
 actually work in them. At the start of
 this century the communities increased
 in size rapidly with the growth of the
 coal mining industry. However the     
 recession of the coal industry along  
 with a general structural decline of  
 other traditional industries within   
 the area, such as fishing, the        
 communities have lost much of their   
 vitlity. Many of the younger families 
 have left to seek employment elsewhere
 while the less economically active    
 members of the community have had     
 little choice but to stay. Many people
 work at Methil docks and there are    
 still some miners who now travel to   
 Seafield Colliery in Kirkcaldy.       </content>
