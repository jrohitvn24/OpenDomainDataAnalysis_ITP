		<title>04POPULATION IN KIP VALLEY</title>
		<content> In this area the{population}is found  
 mainly in the village of Inverkip     
 (pop.2500), and part of a Greenock    
 housing estate called Braeside. In    
 Inverkip the houses along main street 
 are over 100 years old, compared to   
 the Brosely{housing}estate in Braeside
 which is only three years old. In     
 Inverkip the houses are mainly owner- 
 occupied. In Braeside, in the South   
 West of Greenock, most are rented from
 the council. In Inverkip many people  
 have come from other areas to retire, 
 so more of the population is of older 
 age. In Braeside it is almost the     
 opposite . Many of the families are   
 young couples and few are old. A very 
 few of the population live in         
 scattered farms.
