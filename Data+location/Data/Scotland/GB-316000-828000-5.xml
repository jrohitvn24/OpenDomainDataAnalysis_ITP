		<content>    The Glenlivet village hall is run  
 by  a  committee  made  up  of   the  
 representitives of the clubs who use  
 the  hall and  members of the  local  
 community  with the doctor, minister  
 and headmaster as trustees. Money is  
 raised for the upkeep of the hall in  
 the  summer by prize bingo sessions.  
   Adjoining the  hall is a {football} 
{pitch}and{caravan site.               
   The  football  pitch is used  by a  
 local  team   from   Tomintoul   and  
 Glenlivet  and they  play throughout  
 Moray in the Amateur League.          
   The caravan site is open to members 
 of the Caravan Club of Great Britain. 
 It is a small site and usually no more
 than five caravans are allowed at any 
 one time.
