		<content> This area of Orphir is very hilly with
 a rough moorland covering. This       
 included the summit of Ward Hill which
 is the highest hill on the mainland of
 Orkney. The southern side of the hill 
 is used by Territorial Army as a      
 training ground and rifle range. There
 are also peat banks on the hillside   
 which are still worked. Below the     
 hills is Orphir Village, this is a    
 group of small holdings and private   
 houses centred around the church. The 
 area around the village is intensively
 farmed grassland for cattle and sheep.
