    There is no pre_school provision   
 within this area. The nearest nursery 
 is in St.Andrews 7 miles away. Primary
 education takes place within a two    
 roomed building in the centre of the  
 area.                                 
    The roll of the school is 9        
 children. The teaching staff comprises
 one full time and one part time       
 teacher. The school is likely to close
 in July 1985. The children will       
 probably transfer to Largoward,2 miles
 away,or New Gilston,2.5 miles. All    
 children except 1 are transported     
 either by parents or minibus to       
 school.                               
    Secondary Education takes place in 
 St.Andrews at Madras College children 
 being transported by bus.
