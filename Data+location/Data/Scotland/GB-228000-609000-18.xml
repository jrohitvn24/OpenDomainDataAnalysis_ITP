		<content> Sometime after 1244 the monastery was 
 built. Patronage continued under      
 Duncans son Nigel and the de Brus     
 family when they acquired the earldom 
 through marriage. The future king     
 Robert the Bruce made his first       
 recorded official appearance as a     
 teenager at Crossraguel as witness to 
 a charter granted by his father. In   
 1404 king Robert the Third signed the 
 great Crossraguel charter giving the  
 Abbot eternal control over the abbey  
 lands with judgement over rape,murder,
 and robbery.The monks had their own   
 mills, brewhouses and fishings in the 
 river Girvan. During the Reformation  
 the protection of the Earls of        
 Cassilis allowed the abbey to remain  
 occupied till 1592. In 1689 the       
 remaining buildings and revenues were 
 annexed by the crown.
