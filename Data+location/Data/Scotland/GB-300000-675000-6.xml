		<title>06Linlithgow Loch and Peel</title>
		<content>     The{Loch}and the{Peel}together    
 make Linlithgow one of the most scenic
 places in West Lothian.It is also a   
 vast recreation area for the people of
 Linlithgow.                           
    {Linlithgow Loch}was formed by an  
 iceberg diverting the river Avon to   
 fill the Loch.It now provides         
 facilities for fishing,canoeing,      
 sailing,birdwatching and jogging.     
     "Peel" means pale or palisade and 
 the grounds within.{The Peel}has many 
 slopes on it because earlier there was
 a motte and bailey castle before the  
 present palace was built.             
     People come to the loch and Peel  
 to watch birds mainly the{grebes}which
 the loch is famous for,to walk round  
 the loch and play on the swings.We    
 interviewed visitors to the Peel and  
 one man said it was "the best place on
 God's Earth".                         </content>
