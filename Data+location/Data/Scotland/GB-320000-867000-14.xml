		<title>14ARDIVOT FARM LOSSIEMOUTH</title>
		<content>   The Grant family has owned Ardivot  
 Farm for nearly 100 years. The farm is
 148 hectares in size, and Mr Grant and
 two others work there. Mr Grant has 3 
 tractors, 1 combine harvester, 2      
 balers and a dung spreader.           
   Two crops are grown on the farm,    
 barley and grass, and there is a field
 which is leased to Moray Estates who  
 grow potatoes. The grass is made into 
 silage and hay for cattle feed. The   
 good barley goes to the maltings, then
 to the distilleries, while the poorer 
 quality barley goes to the cows.      
   Mr Grant keeps 104 beef cows, a     
 mixture of Aberdeen Angus, Charolais  
 and Hereford, all beef cows. He also  
 takes in around 200 sheep from a farm 
 in the Highlands for winter grazing.
