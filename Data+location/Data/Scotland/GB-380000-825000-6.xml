		<title>06Meldrum School, Oldmeldrum</title>
		<content> Of a population of 2,225 for the      
 combined parishes of Meldrum and      
 Bourtie and the town of Oldmeldrum in 
 1985, the primary school provides     
 education for 226 pupils ranging from 
 age 4 (nursery) to age 11.  There are 
 also two playgroups for 60 children.  
 Indications are that the community is 
 taking care of the rise in population 
 caused by the oil industry boom in    
 Scotland's Northeast and the presssure
 put on by Grampian Regional Council to
 house oil-related workers and their   
 families in Gordon District, within a 
 20 to 30-mile radius of Aberdeen.  A  
 regional plan has created dormitory   
 suburb conditions in Oldmeldrum, but  
 the children appear to take the       
 cultural mix well. Children of Scots  
 farming families make friends with    
 those from incoming families, from    
 German &amp; French to Japanese &amp; American</content>
