		<title>01Achnahaird Peninsula NE</title>
		<content> The Achnahaird peninsula is a low     
 lying area with a high lying range of 
 hills. E W long the centre.  The land 
 is mainly uncultivated or improved    
 with rough grazing for sheep. The     
 Northerly coast has access by means of
 a single track road which services    
 the village of Achnahaird with        
 supplies from  the nearest town       
 Ullapool 20 miles away.  The very     
 small population is engaged in farming
 as its main source of income with one 
 family supported by a caravan site    
 which could hold 100+ vans if full, at
 Â£2 per night and 25p per person.      
 There was no evidence of commercial   
 fishing  from the bay eventhough it   
 was well suited to landing of boats in
 bad weather. one boat was used for    
 lobster pot setting                   
 but this is not                       
 big business                          </content>
