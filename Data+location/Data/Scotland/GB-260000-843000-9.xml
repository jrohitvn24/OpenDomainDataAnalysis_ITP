		<content>   Most of the people in employment in 
 the area work in Inverness. There are 
 two small shops in the block and one  
 school with one teacher and one       
 canteen lady. There is also a crossing
 warden for the school children.       
   In the village of Bunchrew there is 
 a game dealer which employs about     
 eight people. There is a number of    
 small crofts and farms most of which  
 are worked by the owners and their    
 families. People who have a croft     
 usually have another job in Inverness.
 There are people employed on the      
 caravan site although this is mostly  
 seasonal work and some houses provide 
 bed and breakfast accomodation in the 
 summer. There is a residential        
 hospital in the area which employs a  
 number of people.
