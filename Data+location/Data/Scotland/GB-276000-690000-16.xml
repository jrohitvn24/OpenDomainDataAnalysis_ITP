		<title>16WHAT OUR AREA LOOKS LIKE.</title>
		<content> The{style of building}in our area     
 is wide and varied.We have areas of   
 Victorian style homes with large      
 gardens and modern detatched and semi 
 detatched villas and bungalows with   
 compact gardens.There are also Council
 owned flats and houses which serve a  
 large number of people.Overcrowding is
 not a problem in our block and there  
 are many{parks and recreation areas.  
  One of our modern schools, built in  
 1961, was designed A.J SMITH my       
 grandfather.Hotels also contrast      
 old,such as the Hollybank and new,    
 King Robert which was built next to   
 the site of the Monument commemorating
 his famous battle.The surronding      
{countryside}is unmarred by coalbings  
 or industrial sites and is either     
 natural hill landor farms. There are  
 no rivers or lochs but the land is    
 criss-crossed with large burns.       </content>
