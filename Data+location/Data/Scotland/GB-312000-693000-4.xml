		<content> Many of the miner's houses have       
 disappeared and been replaced         
 elsewhere in the village.  Some of    
 this type of housing still remains and
 has been purchased from the N.C.B.    
 These have been renovated and         
 converted to the owner's needs.  The  
 houses to replace the miner's houses  
 are built to the West of the village. 
 The original miner's houes were built 
 to the East of the village near to    
 where the collieries were.  Coucil    
 house building is now at a stand      
 still.  However, private house        
 building is taking place, again mainly
 to the West of the town.
