		<content> The newest housing area consists of   
 houses built by the council and let to
 tenants.It has the name of Crockett   
 View, a name chosen to commemorate a  
 famous writer Samuel Rutherford       
 Crockett, born at Little Duchrae farm 
 just outside the village of Laurieston
 in the parish of Balmaghie.There is   
 also a stone monument, on a small hill
 in a prominent part of the village, to
 his memory.S.R Crockett was born in   
 1860 and died in 1914.He is considered
 to be one of Galloway's most          
 distinguished literary figures        
 and became firmly established as a    
 romantic novelist.Among his many books
 are "The Raiders" and "Men of Moss    
 Hags", both of which have local       
 settings and themes and did much to   
 put Galloway on the English literary  
 map.The local inhabitants are proud of
 their famous "son".                   </content>
