		<title>11ROAD TRANSPORT IN BARR</title>
		<content> Roads in the Barr area are two        
 category-unclassified or"B"category.  
 These roads are not suitable for large
 vehicles and drivers of such often    
 find themselves in difficulties if    
 they venture along narrow hill-tracks.
 All vehicles in the area have to pass 
 through the village and quite often a 
 considerable variety can be seen eg.- 
 timber lorries,Land Rovers and other  
 four-wheel-drives,tractors with       
 various trailers,pick-ups used for    
 carrying hay and small numbers of     
 livestock,horse-boxes,cattle-floats   
 transporting animals to market.       
 The only regular bus into and out of  
 the village travels on the"B734"from  
 Girvan,going no further than Barr and 
 returning by the same route.In the    
 winter months the roads are hazardous 
 and villagers more than welcome the   
 snow-plough!                          </content>
