<title>23The new Ferry Terminal</title>
<content>

This is the Ferry at the new Ferry Terminal in Clachan. It was finished in August 2010. There was a special opening cermony and Raasay Primary pupils performed Gaelic songs for the Transport Minister.It was a very special day. We had to get a new Terminal because the one in Suisinish was unstable. This is the oil tanker coming off the Ferry to deliver oil to people&amp;#39;s houses.The Ferry Terminal opened on the sixteenth of August 2010. There is a new waiting room and big ships can now dock at the pier. Our Ferry takes twelve cars and can carry a hundred and fifty passengers. It is a beautiful Terminal in a lovely location and the ferry provides jobs for the local people.&amp;#13;&amp;#10;&amp;#13;&amp;#10; 28/9/11   &lt;br />
