		<title>10LAMB'S HOUSE</title>
		<content> Lamb's House is at the Shore in       
 Leith.In 1561 Mary, Queen of Scots    
 came over from France.She was waiting 
 for the Lord Provost who must have    
 been delayed by the fog.  She was     
 taken to a house of a merchant, called
 Andrew Lamb where she was given a     
 glass of wine and something to eat.   
 After that she went to Holyrood Palace
 Now Lamb's House is for retired       
 people. There is a games room where   
 they can play snooker, darts,dominoes 
 and scrabble.  There is also an art   
 and craft room, keep fit, drama and   
 dancing rooms.  On some days the      
 chiropodist and the hair dresser come.
 The old people enjoy each other's     
 company.  They also enjoy the food and
 the activities, like drama and        
 snooker.  But the most important thing
 is the company.
