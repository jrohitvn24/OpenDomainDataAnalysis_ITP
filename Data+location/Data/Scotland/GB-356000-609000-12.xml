		<title>12HOME LIFE</title>
		<content>{A typical weekday in the life of Diane
{Martin,aged 11,of Tythehouse Farm.    
 "My cat wakes me up at 7.15,and I get 
 dressed and downstairs at about 8 a.m.
 After breakfast my mother takes my    
 brother Scott and I to school,and our 
 neighbour Samantha.When I get to      
 school there is a short time to play  
 with my best friend Katy.We start our 
 work with Silent Reading followed by  
 various subjects like Mathematics and 
 writing.No-one at school goes home at 
 lunchtime,and we all play at break,   
 games like Kidnapping and horses.In   
 the afternoon we might have Art and   
 writing,and we can finish with a quiz.
 Samantha's mother collects us and when
 we get home,Mum is at the door to     
 greet us.We change into our old       
 clothes and help Mum and Dad,and after
 tea we usually stay in and watch T.V. 
 or read or play."                     </content>
