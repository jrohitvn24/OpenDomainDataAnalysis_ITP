		<title>05LOCAL TRAVEL IN CUMBERNAULD</title>
		<content> To travel around Cumbernauld we can   
 use paths or roads.For speed we       
 normally use the roads.We have three  
 main ways of travelling by road and   
 these are by cars,bus or taxi.In my   
 class of 25 children, 20 have cars at 
 home. This means we often travel      
 around or to and from Cumbernauld by  
 car.But if the car can't be used most 
 people then use the local bus.The bus 
 company is{W. Alexander &amp; Sons}and    
 they have services in the town and    
 into Glasgow and other nearby         
 towns,such as Stirling and Falkirk.We 
 can also,use taxis{which are popular  
{from the shopping centre at the       
{weekend.}Trains run from our town to  
 Glasgow or from{Croy village}which    
 also has trains to Edinburgh.
