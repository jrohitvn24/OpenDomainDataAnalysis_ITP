		<content> School starts at nine and we settle to
 work right away.A weeks work is set at
 the beginning of the week and we plan 
 through the week .                    
   A typical weeks work would include  
 maths,language,art-craft,environmental
 studies,music dance-drama,physical    
 education and free choice when we can 
 choose games,reading or any work we   
 want to follow up.                    
       In our work we use many pieces  
 of equipment including                
 computer,televisions,radios and video 
 recorders.                            
          At intervals we play a game  
 called"Catch five"where one person    
 throws a ball and everyone else       
 attempts to catch it.When one person  
 has caught the ball fives times they  
 become thrower.                       
        This is an example of a modern 
 school.                               </content>
