		<title>13AUCHINSTARRY QUARRY</title>
		<content>      At Auchinstarry there is a       
 disused quarry. Skilled quarrymen     
 worked the stone into sets,kerbs and  
 paving stones which were then taken by
 barge down the canal to pave the      
 streets of Glasgow.                   
                                       
      Now it is a good place to go     
 to spend the day. There are two pools 
 in which you can swim. Smaller        
 children go into the little pool. Some
 people dive off the rocks or the      
 bridge. Lots of people like to        
 sunbathe there if it is hot. Climbers 
 can often be seen scaling the quarry  
 sides, where nearly 100 feet of whin  
 is exposed. There are tables and      
 benches for picnickers too.
