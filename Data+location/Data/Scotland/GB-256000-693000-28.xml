<title>28BUCHLYVIE POST OFFICE AND BANK - updated 2011</title>
<content>

The Post Office, which had moved around the village in its many years of existence, eventually had to close. It has been replaced by a mobile Post Office van which calls at the Village Hall car park regularly at fixed times on weekdays for between one and two hours. Ironically it offers a broader range of services than did its predecessor. &lt;br />&lt;br />The Bank is no more, having departed the scene about the change of the Millennium. The building it occupied is now a private house. Some of the services it offered are now provided by the Post Office van. It should be mentioned that for the last two years the village has been visited weekly by a Royal Bank of Scotland mobile bank facility.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
