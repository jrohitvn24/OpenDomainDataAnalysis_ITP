		<content> Nowadays farming is very complex.To be
 a good farmer is to be a good business
 man.This area takes in eight farms.The
 total acreage comes to 1530 acres with
 the main crops being Barley,Potatoes  
 and Grass.There are 350 beef cattle,  
 100 dairy cattle,650 sheep and 10,000 
 chickens.                             
 Each farm is very different and so are
 the farmers.These are small farms     
 which are difficult to run profitably.
 One farmer operates as an agricultural
 contractor and the others combine with
 each other or other farms to operate  
 as larger units.These farmers all love
 their farms and will do anything to   
 keep them going.As one farmer         
 commented farmers have been around for
 12,000 years and should be around for 
 at least another 12,000!
