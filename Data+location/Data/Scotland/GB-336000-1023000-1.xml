		<content>   This is a parish on the West Main-  
 land bounded by low heather clad hills
 to the South and West, and by the sea 
 and islands to the North and East.    
   It is part of a submerged valley    
 system which has suffered marine      
 erosion.  It is largely composed of   
 limey flagstone, which has made the   
 area, despite Northerly exposure, one 
 of fertile soil, and so supports mixed
 types of farming.  In the past this   
 meant that there was a large farming  
 population but the pattern is changing
 and the population is shifting.       
   There is a wealth of indigenous     
 flora and fauna, and this sometimes   
 gives rise to differences of oppinion 
 between farmers and conservationists. 
 Nevertheless there is a strong        
 community spirit and an active social 
 community life which helps the parish 
 to retain it's identity.              </content>
