		<content> The Carse,Merkinch and Kessock once   
 had three Church of Scotland          
 congretations.Now it is one big parish
 of Trinity Church.Most people want the
 Rev.Norman MacRae for weddings,       
 funerals and hospital visits even if  
 they don't attend church.In 1984 he   
 had 67 weddings and 63 funerals.His   
 500 members and Sunday School also    
 come from other parts of town.In 1861 
 his Church began a mission here for   
 "4 000 souls",poor labourers who spoke
 Gaelic.There are more skilled workers 
 now.They have new houses and speak    
 English.There is a lot of unemployment
 Members of the Scottish Free Church,  
 the Baptist Church and the            
 Episcopalian Church also live here.   
 Children attend their Sunday Schools. 
 There is a Salvation Army Goodwill    
 Centre in Craigton Avenue.A few people
 have now become Mormons or Bahaists.  </content>
