		<content> Many small farms in Bourtie do not    
 eced 200 acres and are family-run     
 concerns, where farther and son work  
 together on the yearly routine.  But  
 at times like sowing, when greateer   
 manpower is required over a short     
 time, farmers on adjoining farms help 
 each other get the work done. Larger  
 equipment is used in etter growing    
 areas like the Garioch, the so-called 
 girnal (grainstoe) of Aberdeenshire,  
 but in Bourtie three men can combine  
 machine power to sow their neighbour's
 grain.  At silage-cutting in June, the
 combined cutting equipment of two frms
 works alongside in one 10 acre field  
 while grass sprouts into collectin    
 bins.  The exception comes at harest  
 where each farm generaly owns and     
 operates one combine harvester,       
 because it is usual for the rain to   
 ripen all at once and all hands needed</content>
