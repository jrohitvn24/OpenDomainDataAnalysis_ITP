		<title>03Ayrshire Dairy Farming (2)</title>
		<content> As well as the Friesian dairy herd    
 there are 140 cattle ranging from the 
 new calves to calving heifers. Among  
 these are 10 Romagnola cattle. This   
 breed,which originated in Northern    
 Italy,is known for its hardiness and  
 ability to withstand wet, wind and    
 cold.                                 
 The farm is run by Mr.Borland assisted
 by a staff of three including his son 
 who trained at an Agriculture College.
  Crops grown at Altonhill are used    
 for cattle_feed,together with         
 bought_in draff, (a by-product of the 
 brewing industry) potatoes and a mix  
 of concentrates_ all calculated to    
 give the cattle a well_balanced diet. 
 Like most modern farms it is highly   
 mechanised:it has an electronic       
 feeding system and a modern rotary    
 milking parlour, installed in 1970 at 
 a cost of Â£18,500.                    </content>
