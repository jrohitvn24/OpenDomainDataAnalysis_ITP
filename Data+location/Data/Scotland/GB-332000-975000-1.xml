		<content> Stroma is an island in the Pentland   
 Firth 3 kilometers northwest of John  
 O'Groats in Caithness.                
 The island is 3 kilometers long and 1 
 1/2 -2 kilometers wide. It was        
 inhabited unti the 1960s when its     
 economy declined and it was abandoned.
 There are several crofts and a school 
 all of which are now derelict. The    
 only inhabitants on Stroma now are  3 
 lighthouse keepers in the lighhouse at
 the north of the island at Swilkie    
 Point Access to Stroma is difficult   
 because there is no longer any boat   
 service.                              
 This area of the survey covers the    
 central and southern part of Stroma.  
 It covered with derelict crofts near  
 to the road which runs up the middle  
 of island. There is some moorland and 
 peat bogs on the west of island.
