		<title>20TRANSPORT IN CALLANDER</title>
		<content> Apart from trains and planes,all other
 means of transport are used in        
 Callander.                            
 Most homes have at least one car and  
 many have two.This is because many men
 travel all over Scotland.There is only
 an hourly bus service to the nearest  
 town and several families live outwith
 the bus service.Many lorries seen in  
 the town are only passing through to  
 and from the north.Some bring the     
 usual services to th town.Those       
 involved with local farming take      
 animals to the Stirling Auction Market
 and transport milk and hay.           
 All the usual {vans}may be            
 seen-tradesmen,milk,post,ice          
 cream,fish,and bread.In the           
 summer,many{touring buses}stop here to
 augment the number of mini,post,school
 and service buses.There are 3taxis,1  
 fire engine and 1ambulance.           </content>
