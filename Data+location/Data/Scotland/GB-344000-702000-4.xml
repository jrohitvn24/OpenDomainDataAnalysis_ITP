 55 pupils some of whom come from the  
 neighbouring villages of Arncroach and
 Kilconquhar.                          
   There are three classes :the 5-7    
 year olds are downstairs while the 8-9
 year olds and the 10-12 year olds are 
 in clssrooms upstairs.                
   After seven years at Primary the    
 pupils transfer to Waid Academy,
