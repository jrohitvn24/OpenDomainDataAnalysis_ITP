		<title>02Living in Grantown</title>
		<content>    Grantown is a pleasant place for   
 all ages. Tourists come here          
 throughout the year to enjoy the      
 scenery of{Speyside.}Even though      
 Grantown is quiet, there is a lot to  
 do. In the{pine woods}nearby where we 
 have{deer}and other{wildlife,}we can  
 go for{nature walks.}Both old and     
 young enjoy the quietness of Grantown 
 and the variety of walks, with many   
 places to explore. One of the main    
 attractions in summer is the{fishing  
{in the River Spey.                    
    In winter we can easily reach both 
 the{Cairngorm and Lecht Ski centres.  
 Grantown is a place where people can  
 relax. We can walk the streets at     
 night without the fear of being       
 mugged.                               
   {Come to Grantown to escape from the
{noise and the grime of the city.
