		<title>10Kennethmont: Local Climate</title>
		<content> Our local climate is temperate.       
 Summers here are usually warm or cool 
 with a few "hot" spells. Autumns are  
 often cool and dry and sometimes damp.
 Winter here is always wet and         
 cold.Often we get heavy falls of snow 
 combined with high winds,this         
 combination often leaves roads        
 blocked, sometimes for hours.Sometimes
 power cables are brought down by the  
 strong winds resulting in power       
 black-outs,and on occasions the school
 is closed due to severe weather       
 conditions. Spring is very often cold 
 and wet, and Summer tends to arrive   
 late.On the whole we are affected     
 quite considerably by our climatic    
 conditions. Late wet Springs affect   
 the farmers, damp Autumns affect the  
 harvest and during severe storms in   
 Winter we are all affected by blocked 
 roads, power cuts, closed schools,etc.</content>
