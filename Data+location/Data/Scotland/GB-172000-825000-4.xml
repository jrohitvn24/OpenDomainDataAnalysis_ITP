		<content> Every year the Provincial Mod is held 
 in Portree.Some of the children from  
 Kyleakin School go to the Mod and     
 recite Gaelic poems and songs.Some of 
 the people who go to the Provincial   
 Mod get to go to the National Mod.The 
 National Mod is held at a different   
 city or town in Scotland every year.  
 Most of the people who go to the      
 Provincial Mod have to be taken by    
 thier mum and dad.Each year we have   
 different events that most of the     
 village take part in.We have Ceilidhs 
 in the Summer and once a year most of 
 the people who live in Kyleakin go to 
 stand and lay a wreath to the men who 
 died in the War.
