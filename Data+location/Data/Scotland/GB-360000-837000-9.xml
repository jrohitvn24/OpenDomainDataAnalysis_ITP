		<title>09Food in Ythanwells</title>
		<content> We did a survey to find out how many  
 people in the district still eat the  
 traditional Scottish foods.The most   
 popular Scottish foods eaten are broth
 and stovies*.Many people still bake   
 bannocks and scones, but only three   
 women in the district bake their own  
 oatcakes,a food eaten daily and called
 "breid" locally.Most of the people buy
 their milk, butter and cheese,even    
 though several do milk a cow and make 
 cheese and butter.Girdle scones are   
 quite popular in the district.        
 Potatoes are part of the daily diet of
 the Ythanwells people.                
                                       
 *Stovies are made from potatoes,      
 onions, fat and leftover pieces of    
 meat and gravy.
