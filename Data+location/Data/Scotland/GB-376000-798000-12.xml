		<title>12CHANGING TIMES IN DRUMOAK</title>
		<content> The biggest change to be seen in      
 Drumoak is in agriculture and its     
 methods.Farms have become mechanised  
 and labour forces have decreased.     
 This has meant a decline in           
 agriculture related trades such as    
{saddlery,blacksmithing and meal       
{milling (oatmeal).  }                 
{Cottar houses}(farm labourers' houses)
 therefore are not now occupied by     
{fee'd men}(hired men),but have been   
 renovated and sold.                   
 Local tradesmen too,suffered when     
 everyone got motor cars,for housewives
 were able to travel to nearby towns   
 for their shopping,instead of relying 
 on travelling vans.Small shopkeepers  
 could not compete in goods or prices. 
{The Transport Act,1962,}meant the     
 withdrawal of all train services on   
 Deeside and{26th, February 1966}saw   
 the last passenger train in Drumoak.  </content>
