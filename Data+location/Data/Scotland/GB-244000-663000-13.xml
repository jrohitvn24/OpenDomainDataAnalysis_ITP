		<content>   Education plays a very important    
 part in the lives of the Linwood      
 community. In all there are 5 Primary 
 schools and 2  Secondary schools. We  
 have chosen only two of these as      
 examples;{St Brendan's Secondary}and  
{Mossedge Primary}. The Primary School 
 caters for children aged between 5 and
 12 years of age. The Secondary School 
 caters for persons between 12 and 18. 
 The Secondary sector is now being     
 expanded to cater also for{adults}who 
 have left school but wish to return to
 take{further education classes}in     
 their own area. Some of these classes 
 lead to certificates. The Secondary   
 School caters for children from a     
 Children's Home outwith the area. The 
 schools are also available for use by 
 the{community}. All the buildings are 
 of recent construction, the oldest    
 being 20 years old.                   </content>
