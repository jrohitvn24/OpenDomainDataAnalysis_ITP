		<content>{Nightlife in Clydebank}               
 There are two main nightclubs in      
 Clydebank which both have a bar and   
 disco. This is for over 18's.         
{Daytime entertainment in Clydebank}   
 Clydebank has a wide range of leisure 
 facilities for all ages during the    
 day. There are three main Community   
 Education Centres which cater for     
 everyone. All provide playgroups,     
 Registered Youth Organisations,cafes  
 and a large variety of clubs.         
{A large majority of Clydebank citizens
 think the entertainment is far from   
 satisfactory therefore they go        
 elsewhere for their leisure. Most     
 people enjoy parties,sport and discos.
 Clydebank does not have a cinema or a 
 concert hall for youths to see their  
 pop idols. To summerise this Clydebank
 does not supply enough entertainment  
 for everybody to enjoy.               </content>
