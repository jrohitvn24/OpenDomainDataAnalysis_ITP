		<content> The Supernatural in Pitreavie.        
 There are quite a few ghosts in our   
 local history. The most famous being  
 the Green Lady who is supposed to     
 haunt Pitreavie Castle. The story grew
 that her husband was killed in battle 
 in 1651. She died of a broken heart   
 and is still in search of him.  The   
 Grey Lady's story is very much the    
 same.  Another ghost is the Headless  
 Highlander who haunts Pitreavie       
 Castle. He is supposed to go round    
 looking for his comrdes and groaning  
 when he finds them dead. There is     
 another ghost in Alice Cox Walk in the
 Izatt Ave. housing estate. She was a  
 district nurse. She knocks on doors   
 and switches lights off &amp; on.         
 Skeletons have been found under       
 St Leonard's School,Fine Fare &amp; the   
 High School. Those were sites of      
 graveyards for Black Death victims.   </content>
