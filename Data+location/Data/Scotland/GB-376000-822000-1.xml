		<content>   Ten out of our twelve square        
 kilometres consist of farming units   
 which is not surprising as this has   
 traditionally been renowned as a      
 highly fertile land area.             
   Being at a latitude of 57 degrees   
 north means that we have a fairly     
 temperate climate with all year round 
 rainfall which,in conjunction with    
 good soil provides us with lush grass 
 for grazing.                          
   With the introduction of early      
 ripening varieties of cereals,farmers 
 can now diversify and not be totally  
 reliant on the produce of one aspect  
 of farming.                           
   The remaining two square kilometres 
 are largely occupied by relatively    
 recent town development in the form   
 of housing estates built on what was  
 formerly farm land.
