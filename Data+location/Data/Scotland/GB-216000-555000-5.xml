		<content> Within our school we found that 4% of 
 fathers were unemployed and that the  
 unemployment rate in our D_block is   
 average for this area.In{Glenluce}    
 village local hotels provide work for 
 some villagers,as do four builders,an 
 engineering plant and some farmers who
 employ teenagers on {Youth Training   
{Schemes.}Some women in Glenluce do    
 some type of domestic work.Other      
 people work in nearby Stranraer. The {
{arts and crafts }are typical of a     
 rural area. Knitting,sewing, toymaking
 and floral art are widespread.  Less  
 frequent are{leather and horn craft   
 and{wood carving.}Few blacksmiths are 
 left in rural areas but our local     
 smiddy not only makes and shoes horses
 but produces{wrought iron work.}The   
 village also has a{taxidermist,}a bit 
 of a rarity, and he also produces     
 polished blackthorn walking sticks.   </content>
