		<title>17THE CHANGING FACE OF PEEBLES</title>
		<content>  {Legend}has it that Peebles got its  
 name from the white pebbles washed    
 upon the banks of the{River Tweed     
 during the summer months.The true     
 meaning was formed from the Gaelic    
 word{"Pebyl"}which means              
 encampment.The King and his men used  
 to come here and hunt.They made their 
 encampment down a road now called     
 Kingsmeadows.                         
   In the eyes of most people Peebles  
 has improved.An old man we interviewed
 thinks Peebles has deteriorated       
 because of the steady population      
 growth over the years.He,though,has   
 not seen the new buildings that have  
 been built for our convenience.       
   There used to be a railway in       
 Peebles and its remains can be seen   
 around Peebles.This apart,life in     
 Peebles has changed only gradually.
