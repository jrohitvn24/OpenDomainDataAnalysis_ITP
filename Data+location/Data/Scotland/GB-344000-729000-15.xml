		<content> Most of this area, not very long ago, 
 used to be countryside overlooking the
 wide estuary of the River Tay.With the
 speed of housing development much of  
 this land is now covered by housing.  
 Green belts and parks help to retain  
 its character with of course the beach
 area providing a natural base.        
{FISHERHOUSES}Mention must be made of  
 the Fisherhouses which are a feature  
 of the harbour and beach area.        
 Outwardly little has changed but the  
 majority have been renovated and      
 restored internally.                  
{HARBOUR }In the past the Harbour was  
 used for the fishing fleet and ferry  
 crossing of the River Tay.  Now it is 
 used solely for pleasure craft. A     
 Lifeboat is stationed at Broughty     
 Ferry.
