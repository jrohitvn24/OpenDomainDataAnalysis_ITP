		<title>11SHOPPING FACILITIES</title>
		<content> Guardbridge has only a few facilities 
 providing the locals with very basic  
 goods. The post office/newsagent is   
 situated on Main road. It is visited  
 by alot of people, all year round. The
 sales are quite high for a            
 population of this size. They have    
 expanded alot since they first        
 arrived. The T.S.B is a very small    
 branch and no additional staff are    
 required other than the two that work 
 full-time. The bank is only open on a 
 Thusday and on Friday. Most people go 
 to Dundee for their weekly shopping as
 there is not alot of grocery in the   
 post office/newsagent.
