		<title>19A TRACTORMAN AT BLYTHBANK</title>
		<content> MY FATHER WORKS AT BLYTHBANK WITH A   
 GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO DRIVE TRACTORS,   
 MAINLY BRITISH LAYLAND. THEY USE      
 PLOUGHS, HARROWS, CULTIVATORS AND     
 ROLLERS TO WORK THE GROUND AND        
 SPRAYING AND DRAINING EQUIPMENT TO    
 KEEP THE CROPS CLEAN. TO HARVEST THE  
 CROPS THEY USE SILAGE MACHINES,       
 MOWERS, DIGGERS AND BALERS. FOR       
 STORAGE, THEY HAVE HAY SHEDS FOR HAY  
 OR STRAW, SILAGE PITS FOR SILAGE,     
 GRANARIES FOR GRAIN AND BARNS FOR     
 CATTLE AND SHEEP CONCENTRATE FEEDING. 
 THERE IS HOUSING FOR CATTLE, SOME     
 SHEEP, CALVES, A MILKING PARLOUR AND A
 PLACE FOR CLIPPING AND WEIGHING SHEEP.
 MY FATHER USUALLY WORKS FROM 7PM TO   
 5PM HAVING 1 HOUR FOR LUNCH, BUT EVERY
 2ND WEEKEND HE WORKS FROM 5AM TO 9AM  
 AND 2.30PM TO 5 PM.                   
 HIS LATEST TRACTOR IS A MARSHALL.
