		<title>02Fishing on Coll</title>
		<content>   Most Fishermen on Coll are part-time
 with a few exceptions.The most common 
 catch are velvet crabs and lobsters.  
 July,August and September are the best
 months for fishing.                   
   Most fishermen use homemade creels  
 but a few use commercially produced   
 ones.                                 
   Mackerel,saithe,liath,are caught    
 mainly to use as bait in creels.      
   The fishing on Coll depends greatly 
 on the weather and the state on the   
 tide.Most of the boats range from     
 fourteen foot to twenty-four foot.Most
 fishermen have outboard engines but   
 some have inboards.There is one boat  
 with an inboard-outboard engine.Two   
 people have pot-haulers(winches for   
 creels).Most boats have names but some
 have registration numbers.
