		<title>20A Day in an Adult's Life</title>
		<content>   As a working mother, I get up at    
 7.40 am each week day and I am washed 
 and dressed by 8.00 am when I have my 
 breakfast which consists of cereal,   
 toast and tea. I do the dishes and    
 make the beds before I leave at 8.50  
 am for school where I am a primary    
 teacher. I travel to school by car. I 
 teach maths and reading up until 12.30
 pm, then I have my lunch which        
 normally consists of fruit. At 1.30 pm
 we go to singing games. The children  
 go home at 2.30 pm. At 3.15 pm I can  
 go home but I only do so once I have  
 marked all the jotters so quite often 
 I don't get home until 4.00 pm.       
   When I arrive home I do housework   
 such as washing or ironing. Then I    
 prepare and have tea. After this I do 
 any preparation necessary for school  
 the next day. I have supper before    
 going to bed at 11.00 pm.             </content>
