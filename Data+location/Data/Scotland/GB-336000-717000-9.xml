  Cairnie farm lies north of Cupar and 
 has been in the Laird family since    
 1969. Originally the land was all part
 of the Ancient Barony of Pitbladdo,   
 but around the last centary the land  
 was sold.                             
  Cairnie itself wasn't originally     
 intended to be a working farm, it was 
 owned by a family of professional     
 soldiers, headed by General Fowlis,   
 who bought the surrounding 118 acres  
 for his family and wife to live in    
 while he fought in the Napoleonic     
 Wars.                                 
  The farm lies in the Parish of Cupar 
 and thus the Laird family should have 
 reserved pews in the Parish church.   
 The Cupar Parish boundary stretches to
 the Moonzie Burn which crosses the    
 south of this area.                   </content>
