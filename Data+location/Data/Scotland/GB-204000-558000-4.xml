		<title>04LOCAL HISTORY - STRANRAER</title>
		<content>  Stranraer is the main town in the    
{Rhins of Galloway}- the central point 
 for services,etc.                     
  The town developed from{Roman times} 
 mainly through the influence of       
 settlers, particulary from{Ireland.}  
  The old town was situated between two
 burns and consisted of three parts -  
 Hillhead, Clayhole and Stranraer. The 
 three villages grew together to form  
 the modern town of Stranraer.         
  Stranraer received its Royal Burgh   
 Charter in{1617}and has held its place
 of importance in the Rhins ever since.
  In more recent times the demise of   
 the Portpatrick/Donaghadee ferry      
 crossings led to the Stranraer/Larne  
 route being established. Stranraer is 
 now a busy ferry port serving mainland
 Britain and Ireland. The town has both
 grown in population and attracted     
 industries as a result.               </content>
