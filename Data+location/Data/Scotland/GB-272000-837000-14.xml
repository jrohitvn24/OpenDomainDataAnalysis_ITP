		<title>14FARMING IN DAVIOT TODAY.CTD.</title>
		<content>                                       
  {FORESTRY-}There are several         
 different forestry companies          
 harvesting trees in and around Daviot.
  FISH FARMING-One farm in the area has
 begun  this type of farming. At the   
 moment the ponds are stocked with     
 rainbow trout but there is    a       
 possibility they may stock with       
 salmon.                               
                                       
      {CROFTING.}There are still a few 
 crofts that farm in the old ways but  
 many of the crofts are no longer run  
 as crofts and some of the land has    
 been added to neighbouring farms, used
 as a caravan park or grazing for      
 horses.                               
        The{moorland,}and there is a   
 lot of it, is covered in{heather}and  
 may graze sheep.                      
                                       </content>
