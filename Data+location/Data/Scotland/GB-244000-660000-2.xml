		<title>02LEISURE SURVEY</title>
		<content> We asked 100 local people to give     
 their view on the leisure activities  
 in the area. This is the result of    
 the survey. Eight per. cent. said all 
 of thier spare time was taken up      
 gardening, 25% regularly go swimming  
 at Paisley or Barrhead, 12% said they 
 used the local library often,11% are  
 keen bowlers. The other popular       
 pastimes mentioned are visits to the  
 local public house, dancing and       
 sewing classes, racing pigeons,       
 squash, golf, badminton and fishing.  
 The local football pitches at Moredun 
 are also well used.However 31% of     
 those interviewed expressed a         
 dissatisfaction with the facilities   
 in the area. When asked to comment    
 many felt there should be more play   
 areas for the children, an indoor     
 sports centre and more outdoor tennis 
 courts for young and old alike.       </content>
