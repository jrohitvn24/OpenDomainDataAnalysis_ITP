		<content> At the school there is a community    
 club, where bowling and darts are     
 played.the members meet at 7 pm on    
 Monday and Thursday nights.There are  
 21 bowlers, 17 men and 5 ladies.All   
 the bowlers play darts too,but they do
 not have a darts tournament.There are 
 2 bowling tournaments every year, when
 people from a wide district flock to  
 Ythanwells.At the last tournament we  
 had 120 entrants from as far as Fintry
 Daviot and Turriff. The tournaments   
 last between 2 and 3 weeks. the ladies
 of the district provide tea,coffee,hot
 snacks and homebaking,and this helps  
 to raise funds for the prizes and the 
 upkeep of equipment.Last year surplus 
 funds were gifted to the cavitron     
 appeal,and Â£60 were donated to the    
 school for a computer.
