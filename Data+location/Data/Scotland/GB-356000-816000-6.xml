		<content> Each of the three parishes has its    
 own primary school.  Only Tullynessle 
 School lies in the survey area.  Older
 children attend Alford Academy - a    
 full six year secondary school.       
 Present rolls are Tullynessle 30, Keig
 22, Alford 183, Alford Academy 480.   
 The Education Act of 1980 enabled     
 parents to send their children to the 
 school of their choice. This right has
 been widely excercised. A variety of  
 vocational and non-vocational evening 
 classes are held in the schools and   
 Community Centre. An Information Tech-
 nology Centre at Alford Academy will  
 open in 1985 for community use. In an 
 effort to get an independent pay      
 review  Scottish teachers are taking  
 escalating industrial action -        
 strikes, cancellation of extra_       
 curricular activities and recently    
 voting to boycott external exams.     </content>
