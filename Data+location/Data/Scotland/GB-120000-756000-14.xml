		<content>     There are two churches on Coll,   
 the Church of Scotland and the United 
 Free Church of Scotland.  The         
 missionary, Mr. John Campbell, runs   
 the Church of Scotland, he is leaving 
 in July.  The Rev. Huite Sliep runs   
 the United Free Church.               
   Few people now attend church on     
 Coll.  There a few Catholics and      
 Episcopalians who are attended to by  
 visiting priests.                     
   There are two church buildings.  The
 Church of Scotland was built in 1907. 
 The minister at the time raised the   
 money to build the church by holding a
 three day Sale of Work in Inverness.  
   The minister for the Church of      
 Scotland Parish, which is linked with 
 Tiree, is the Rev. Donaldson from     
 Tiree.
