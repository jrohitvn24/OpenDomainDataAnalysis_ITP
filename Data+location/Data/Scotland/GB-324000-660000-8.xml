		<title>08PAPERMAKING IN PENICUIK</title>
		<content> Penicuik used to be one of the major  
 papermaking towns in Britain but      
 Dalmore mill near Auchendinny is the  
 only mill left. The mill was started  
 in 1837 by Mr. William Sommerville.   
 At that time the mill used rags as its
 raw material because wood pulp and    
 esparto grass had not been discovered.
 The mill started using esparto grass  
 around 1865 and was a pioneer in this 
 part of Scotland.  After teething     
 problems a successful operation was   
 developed which carried on for nearly 
 a hundred years.  During World War 1  
 the mill carried on with one machine  
 due to the shortage of materials and  
 labour.  During World War 2 this was  
 repeated.  Straw was used instead of  
 esparto grass and a modest amount was 
 produced.  Today the output is about  
 8000 tonnes per year and 160 people   
 are employed.                         </content>
