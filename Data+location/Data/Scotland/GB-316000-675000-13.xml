		<title>13CRAMOND :Dunfermline College</title>
		<content> Dunfermline College, a national       
 college of Physical Education, has    
 been in Cramond for about 20 years. In
 specially designed buildings with well
 equipped gyms and theatres and on fine
 playing fields, more than 3000 Further
 Education students have been trained  
 to teach Physical Education or have   
 been prepared for the British Leisure 
 and Recreation Industry. Most of the  
 students have been Scottish females.  
 There have always been students from  
 the rest of Britain and from overseas 
 The B Ed course is still all female   
 but the B A degree is mixed and from  
 next year there is to be no segre-    
 gation in the instruction of Physicakl
 Education. We hope that does not mean 
 the College will move away from       
 Cramond. We know that it can be       
 difficult to integrate football games 
 in our primary school.                </content>
