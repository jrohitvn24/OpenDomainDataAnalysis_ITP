		<title>08TOURISM, BONAR BRIDGE</title>
		<content> Years ago{Bonar Bridge}was known as a 
 picturesque holiday resort. Nowadays, 
 we would not really call it a resort  
 but it is a busy place in the         
 summer. Tourists come here as it is a 
 good{centre}from which to{tour}the    
 northern highlands. Many people stay  
 here on their way north or west. Some 
 tourists come for the{salmon fishing  
 on the Kyle and nearby rivers. The    
 village has three{hotels}and many     
{guest houses}and{bed and breakfast    
 places.                               
    Tourism also benefits the local    
 shopkeepers, garages and              
 post-office. The attractive nine-hole 
{golf course}in Bonar and the proximity
 of several good full-size courses     
 makes this area an ideal choice for   
 keen golfers.
