		<content>   Evie School was opened in April     
 1978, when 3 two-teacher schools      
 closed and combined in the new        
 open-plan school.  There are 7 classes
 , 58 pupils (aged from 5 to 12 years  
 old), 6 itinerant teachers of music,  
 art, P.E., remedial, swimming and     
 violin.  There is a janitor, an       
 auxiliary and 3 cooks.  The school has
 a nursery part-time teacher (three    
 mornings) and 20 nursery children.    
 Nearly all the children in the        
 catchment area of 11 kilometres       
 radius, are transported to school.    
   The school is well equiped with     
 materials, equipment and furniture.   
 There is a large hall which is shared 
 between the school and attatched      
 community wing.  The P.T.A., Schools  
 Council, Community Council and Centre 
 Committee all help in the running of  
 the school and it's facilities.       </content>
