		<title>18Battle of Camperdown (2)</title>
		<content> On the 17th of October 1797 Admiral   
 Duncan was created Viscount Duncan of 
 Camperdown and Baron Duncan of Lundie.
 He received the thanks of both Houses 
 of Parliament for his great victory   
 against the Dutch and a pension of    
 Â£2,000 per annum from the Crown.Early 
 in 1798 Lord Duncan visited Dundee and
 was received with great honour. A     
 portrait was painted and placed in the
 town hall of Dundee. The name of the  
 estate was changed from Lundie to     
 Camperdown to commemorate the great   
 victory. The estate continued in the  
 hands of the Duncan family into the   
 20th Century until in 1947, it having 
 been presented to the town, the estate
 was opened as a public park  by Her   
 Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth, who
 became our Queen in 1953.
