		<title>10CASTLETOWN - DOMESTIC POWER</title>
		<content> The main power source for domestic use
 is electricity from the National      
 Grid.As well as power from hydro      
 schemes and coal powered              
 stations,power is fed into the        
 National Grid from Dounreay Nuclear   
 Power Station which is the major      
 employer in the area.  Most houses    
 have chimneys and use open fires which
 burn coal,wood and peat.Many families 
 in  landward areas have peat banks    
 where peat is cut during the summer   
 months for use in the winter.There are
 two peat extracting companies in      
 Caithness which provide peat for      
 domestic use . Bottled gas is used by 
 some ,mainly for cooking ,as there is 
 no piped gas supply.  Alternative     
 power sources are not in evidence     
 apart from a windmill,built in 1982 at
 a cost of Â£40 000 ,which provides     
 power for one house.                  </content>
