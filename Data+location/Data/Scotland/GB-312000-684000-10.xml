		<title>10Oil Wells in Fife</title>
		<content> In the Autumn of{1981}test bores      
 reconfirmed the discovery of oil      
 (previously discovered in the{Second  
{World War,}and again in{1965)}in the  
 region of{Calais Farm}and{Dulloch}    
{Farm,}to the south-east of            
 Dunfermline.                          
                                       
 Previously, there was not thought to  
 be enough oil to be drilled           
 commercially, but with escalating oil 
 prices, and the fact that the oil is  
 on land and not much deeper down than 
 five hundred feet, the companies which
 have license for fifty-nine thousand  
 acres in west and central Fife, North 
{Sea petroleums}and{Pacific Basins (UK)
 believe that it may well be worth     
 drilling for what oil is there. It is 
 not known what they have decided at   
 the present time.
