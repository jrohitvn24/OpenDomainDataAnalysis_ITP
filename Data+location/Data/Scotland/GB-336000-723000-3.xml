		<content> In Gauldry three building companies   
 and the Council are building houses.  
 The building companies are Betts,     
 Interbuild and Frasers.Approximately  
 forty_five houses are in the Betts    
 complex,thirty houses in the          
 Interbuild complex,fifteen houses in  
 the Frasers complex,and the Council   
 have not started building yet.Some    
 people are objecting to the Council   
 houses being built,and are saying they
 would move out,rather than let the    
 houses be built while they live in    
 Gauldry.The village used to be small, 
 but it has grown considerably in the  
 last ten years.In recent years many   
 farm_workers cottages have been bought
 by private buyers and renovated.
