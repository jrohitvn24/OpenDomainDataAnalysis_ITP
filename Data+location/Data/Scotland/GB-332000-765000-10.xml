 Around the church there is a cemetery 
 with  53 gravestones in total. This   
 century there have been 26 gravestones
 erected. Six of the gravestones have  
 Celtic Crosses on them. The oldest    
 gravestone was put there in 1741 which
 makes it 244 years old. Before then   
 people were buried under the church   
 itself. One epitaph reads,            
  "Like crowded forest trees we stand  
   But some are marked to fall.        
   The axe that falls at God's command 
   It soon will suit us all."          
 The whole area of the graveyard is    
 1036 square metres.                   
 In and around the gravegard are trees 
 and bushes which help to make it very 
 picturesque. Many people have already 
 reserved their resting place in       
 Glenprosen Churchyard.
