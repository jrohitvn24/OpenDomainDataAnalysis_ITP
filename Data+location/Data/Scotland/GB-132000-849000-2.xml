		<title>02CROFTING IN EDINBURGH</title>
		<content> There are thirteen crofts being worked
 at present, but they do not produce   
 enough to support a family.           
 Black-faced sheep, cheriots and       
 crosses are raised, their number      
 controlled so that limited pasture is 
 not over-grazed. The sale of lambs and
 wool barley compensates for the cost  
 of winter feeding. Some crofters keep 
 one or two cows and there is a small  
 herd of highland cattle; all free of  
 TB and brucellois. A few goats,       
 hill ponies and hens are also reared. 
 Some land is cultivated, producing    
 potatoes, turnips and sometimes oats. 
 Grass can be cut for hay, but even in 
 good years, hay has to be bought from 
 central Scotland. Animals are sold at 
 markets in Portree or Dingwall. Some  
 hogs are sent to over-winter on the   
 mainland.                             
                                       </content>
