 In school we are taught mathematics,  
 language arts, environmental studies, 
 art, music and physical education.    
 Playtimes are fun and we play a       
 variety of games e.g.football,rugby,  
 chasing games and catching the girls! 
 I have a school lunch every day.      
 School finishes at 3.15 p.m. and I get
 home at quarter to four. As soon as I 
 get home I change my clothes, do my   
 homework, feed the dogs and take Jenny
 the cow and Dougal the calf back to   
 the byre. Tea is at half past five. My
 favourite is sausage,beans and chips. 
 I go and work with my dad until seven 
 o'clock then I watch television until 
 bedtime at 9 p.m. Mum and Dad go to   
 bed at 10 o'clock as they have to rise
 early.
