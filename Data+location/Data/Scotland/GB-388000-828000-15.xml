		<content> The field boundaries mainly consist of
{dry_stone dykes}which are covered with
{moss and lichen.}The majority of the  
 natural vegetation follows the lines  
 of the field boundaries and roadsides.
 This mainly consists of{grass,ground_ 
{elder}and other common  weeds such as 
{nettles and dockens.}There are also   
 various kinds of wild flowers for     
 example{Bluebells and Daisies,}the    
 pollen of which attracts{flies,bees   
 and{butterflies.}The area is also     
 inhabited by{rabbits,moles and birds  
 who are unpopular with the farmers    
 because they eat crops and dig up the 
 ground.These creatures are therefore  
 probably destroyed by the farmers to  
 prevent more damage.In contrast to    
 this there is an area of conservation 
 at{Pitmedden Gardens}where all plants 
 and wildlife are protected by the     
 National Trust.                       </content>
