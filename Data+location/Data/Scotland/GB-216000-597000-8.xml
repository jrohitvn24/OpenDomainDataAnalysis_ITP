		<content>    {GIRVAN}is well catered for health-
 wise with its own Cottage Hospital,Day
 Centre,Health Centre,two dental       
 surgeries and Ambulance Depot.        
     Many Girvan residents were born in
 the Davidson Hospital and now attend  
 the Day Care Centre as elderly        
 patients.Accident cases and sudden    
 illnesses are dealt with along with   
 routine nursing.Many of Girvan's      
 people have reason to be grateful to  
 the staff of this establishment.      
     The Health Centre provides a focus
 for doctors and patients although some
 older patients regret the rather less 
 personal touch.                       
     Three dentists practise in town   
 and the lengthy wait for an           
 appointment bears witness to their    
 necessity.The Ambulance attends       
 accidents and takes senior citizens   
 to Day Care.                          </content>
