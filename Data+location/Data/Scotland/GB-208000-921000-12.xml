		<title>12HIGHLAND INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> There is very little Industry in      
 Assynt due to lack of raw material &amp;  
 distance from the Market place. We do 
 have a thriving Pottery Industry &amp; a  
 small Plant-Hire firm. The Pottery was
 encouraged to Assynt by the H.I.D.B. &amp;
 was set up in 1974. They now employ 14
 people. Their markets are Scottish    
 Craft shops, London, &amp; the U.S.A.     
 Their material comes from Devon,      
 Dorset, &amp; Scotland. The Plant-Hire    
 firm services the Community with      
 various plant &amp; equipment. There is   
 also a new Shell-fish processing firm 
 called Gricks. They grade &amp; freeze    
 prawns caught near Lochinver. They    
 employ several people. There is       
 provision for future Industry in the  
 form of a proper Industrial site built
 by the Regional Council.
