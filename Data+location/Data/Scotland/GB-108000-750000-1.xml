		<title>01Caoles and the Isle of Gunna</title>
		<content> This block includes the southernmost  
 tip of the Isle of Coll in the Inner  
 Hebrides plus the small island of     
 Gunna. Apart from sea and coastal rock
 the vegitation comprises sand dune    
 grasses as well as heath and moorland 
 grasses over peat and rock. The       
 vegitation of this small area is the  
 single most important point of        
 interest, as the sand dune bent       
 grasses or Machair provide the cover  
 for many small and rare flowers and   
 plants which have persuaded the Nature
 Conservancy Council to designate the  
 Caoles and Gunna areas as a site of   
 special scientific interest. Seabirds,
 such as diving ducks and geese are    
 given ideal breeding and feeding      
 grounds round the shores, while inland
 sheep are farmed to utilise the fine  
 grasses over the area.
