 The Aboyne{Business Centre}was opened 
 at the beginning of 1984 and is       
 situated in the newly renovated       
 building of the old school.  It       
 attracted several{businesses}including
 a Hairdresser, an Architectural       
 Practice, a Dentist and a Home Design 
 Studio. Most of the businesses were in
 other premises before moving to the   
 centre and all would agree it is      
 suitable for their needs.  The only   
 disadvantage that the centre possesses
 is that it is slightly away from the  
 main centre where the shops are and   
 that there is a slight lack of sign   
 posts pointing to the centre.  The    
 centre offered larger premises and in 
 some cases more modern premises than  
 employers had previously been in and  
 all feel that it was to their         
 advantage moving there.               </content>
