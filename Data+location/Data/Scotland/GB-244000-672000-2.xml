		<content> On{Saturday  1st. June 1985}the       
 people of Old Kilpatrick celebrated   
 their annual{Gala Day.}               
                                       
 I woke up that morning to find the    
 sun shining brightly in my bedroom    
 window. It was such a lovely day, just
 perfect for the{Gala.}I was so        
 excited. The{Gala}began with a parade 
 of floats.                            
                                       
 The one I liked best carried          
{Charlene Robertson}who was chosen to  
 be this years{Gala Queen.}She was     
 sitting on her throne with a lovely   
 blue dress and a diamond crown. Her   
 attendants were standing at either    
 side of her.
