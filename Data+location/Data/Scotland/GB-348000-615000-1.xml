		<content> The area studied is the N.E. sector of
 Hawick, a Scottish Border Town famous 
 for high quality knitwear, a          
 formidable Rugby Union Team - the     
 "Greens", and a passionate support of 
 local traditions climaxed in the      
 "Common Riding". Set amid rolling     
 Border Hills on the banks of the      
 River Teviot (a tributory of the River
 Tweed), this town of l6,5OO people,   
 successfully combines a country       
 emvironment with those of a busy      
 manufacturing and market town. The    
 sector coveredd is representative of  
 the town in that it contains rough    
 hill grazing, pastureland, commercial,
 residential and industrial areas.     
 However in addition to these "typical"
 areas the sector is unique in that it 
 contains the largest housing estate in
 the Borders, Burnfoot, which comprises
 lOOl houses.                          </content>
