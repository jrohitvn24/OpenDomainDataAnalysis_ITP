		<title>11THE LOCAL PRESS</title>
		<content> Very much against the trend elsewhere,
 Renfrew is well supplied by local news
 papers. As well as the daily published
 Paisley Express which includes stories
 concerning Renfrew, there is the      
 Renfrew and Erskine Gazette which is  
 produced weekly on Thursdays. This    
 replaced the Renfrew Press in 1983    
 which was closed after being taken    
 over. The Gazette deals with items of 
 local news and local human interest   
 such as the proposed sports complex at
 the Deanpark Hotel, sports events and 
 photographs of local weddings. It also
 contains advertisements on local      
 house sales, jobs and items for sale  
 as well as commercial advertising.    
 Since 1984 a free newspaper has been  
 delivered by local children for       
 pocket money to households in Renfrew.
 It is sponsored by local commercial   
 adverts and fees from classified ads. </content>
