		<title>01General Review of Sorbie</title>
		<content>    On our allocated block, most of    
 the land is{farming}land.Some of it is
 hilly and some is bog land but a lot  
 of it is arable. There are eleven     
 farms in the block and most of them   
 are dairy farms.                      
    {Kilsture forest}is also in this   
 block. It attracts tourists from      
 cities because it has a forest trail  
 which gives people a chance to view   
 our countryside and wildlife.         
    Quite near the forest there is a { 
{Creamery}. It is the main source of   
 employment for the local people, who  
 live in the village of {Sorbie}.      
 Sorbie is a friendly, peaceful little 
 village, situated in south-west       
 Scotland in the region of Dumfries and
 Galloway. It is 13 miles from the     
 nearest market town, called Newton    
 Stewart. It is approximately 3 miles  
 from the coast.                       </content>
