		<title>10EMPLOYMENT IN CUMBERNAULD</title>
		<content> People work in 4 main areas here _ the
{Town centre}and the{Industrial Estates
 of Westfield,West Lenziemill and      
 Blairlinn. These estates are located  
 on the outskirts of the town,{away    
{from the houses.                      
 The factories are all {modern}in      
 design and neatly laid out. They      
 produce goods which are light and are 
 easily moved around by road. This area
 has been more fortunate than other    
 parts of the country in that fewer    
 factories are closing down putting    
 people out of work. This is because it
 is a{new town}and many factories are  
 given{help, such as grants and loans,}
 from the Development Corporation to   
 help them. The other main area of     
 employment is the Town Centre where   
 people work in the{shops and offices. 
 An important employer here is the{    
{Inland Revenue offfice.}              </content>
