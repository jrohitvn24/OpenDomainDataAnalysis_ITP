		<title>04CRAMOND :Primary School</title>
		<content> The 280 children of Cramond Primary   
 School are housed in two buildings    
 which are a ten minute walk apart.The 
 smaller and much older building, in   
 Whitehouse Road, has four classrooms  
 and accomodates three infant classes. 
 This stone building was first used as 
 a school in 1875.Prior to that it was 
 two dwelling houses - a fact that is  
 still fairly obvious from the front.  
 The large,light-coloured modern       
 building in Cramond Crescent which    
 was completed in 1975 has 8 class-    
 rooms,and two more are in a trans-    
 portable hut. Apart from 12 class     
 teachers there are part-time          
 specialists in music,craft and        
 remedial work. The school's large     
 grassy play area is poorly drained and
 very muddy. Aircraft noise is         
 something of a problem despite double 
 glazing.                              </content>
