		<content> . Ayr's big{employers}were engineering
 and carpet making. Carpet making has  
 gone entirely and engineering is      
 greatly reduced. 14% of the work force
 are unemployed. Finance limits the    
 council to providing 'nest' factories 
 to encourage small businesses to start
 up at low cost. We are building five  
 more this year..                      
   The{housing}waiting list totals 2000
 but finance limits the council to     
 building one bedroomed sheltered      
 housing for elderly people. This year 
 we are spending a million modernising 
 houses 30 years old _central heating, 
 insulation, fitted kitchens.          
   Three big{shopping}developments are 
 under construction and another is     
 planned. We protect the architectural 
 character of the town and insist on   
 housing for rent and car parking being
 built in with the shops.              </content>
