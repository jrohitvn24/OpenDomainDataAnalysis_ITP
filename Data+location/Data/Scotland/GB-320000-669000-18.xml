		<title>18SAUGHTON PARK CONT.</title>
		<content>  Most of the people who visited the   
 park, were between the ages of 41-65  
 and 31-40, and were housewives or     
 Civil Servants as their office is     
 just across the road. People like the 
 park because it is so quiet and there 
 are lots of birds and flowers. Most   
 people love to relax and have a sleep,
 or read or have a seat and eat their  
 lunch.                                
  Many people like the Park but a few  
 people complained about the vandalism 
 and would have liked less concreted   
 areas. Some people would have liked   
 more facilities in the Park such as an
 ice-cream van, a children's farm, a   
 shop, more trees and floodlights. All 
 of these amenities would attract more 
 people to spend time in Saughton Park 
 Gardens and they would have more fun.
