		<title>18Farming in Dalkeith</title>
		<content> My farm, Wester Cowden, is typical of 
 many in the area. We use machinery,   
 have some animals, but mostly grow    
 crops. The land is rented from the    
 Duke of Buccleuch. My father, the     
 Grieve, rents the land from the       
 farmer, in turn. Our animals are      
 mostly bullocks, which are taken to   
 the market for sale. We have a beef   
 herd, not a dairy herd. We grow wheat,
 barley, oats, corn, potatoes and      
 turnips. The biggest field is 60      
 acres. Altogether our farm is 600     
 acres. We pay people to pick the      
 potatoes for us. We have six Ford     
 tractors. My father drives the        
 Combine, Seeder, Plough, Dungspreader 
 and Forklift. Dalkeith has            
 established itself as a leading market
 town, with a cattle market on Mondays 
 and an agricultural show every year in
 July.                                 </content>
