 I had my breakfast at 9.30. We went to
 the shops in Crieff to buy papers for 
 my Dad, and a birthday present for    
 Fiona McGregor.We took Jinty, our     
 golden retriever for a walk at Lady   
 Mary's Walk till twelve. My lunch was 
 salad. In the salad was lettuce,      
 tomatoes , meat and cucumber.         
   After that I went to Fiona's party  
 from 2.30 till 4.30.First we played   
 musical statues, then went outside for
 the barbecue. It was just a snack. We 
 had beefburgers and sausages in a     
 roll. I went home and had my tea at   
 5.50  p.m. I went out and played with 
 my brother Sandy till 6.45 p.m. I went
 in and had my bath . I went to bed at 
 8 p.m.
