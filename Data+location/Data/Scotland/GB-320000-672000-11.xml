		<content>  Ancient maps and charters show that  
 there were once two villages in this  
 vicinity. They were called{Kirk Road  
{Haugh}and{Clarty Hole,}which later    
 became Blackhall.Today Blackhall is a 
{mainly residential}area of Edinburgh. 
 Which is situated a few miles west of 
 the city centre.Most of the houses are
{privately owned}and they are          
 peacefully sandwiched between two of  
 the city's busier roads.The main      
 village of Blackhall is built snugly  
 in a dip on the{Queensferry Road}and  
 has a variety of shops including      
 restaurants,clothes shops, banks and  
 grocers.The typical Blackhall family  
 lives in fairly comfortable house with
{approximately four bedrooms.}These    
 houses are either{terraced ,bungalows,
{or villas.}All of them have reasonably
 sized gardens and most have garages.
