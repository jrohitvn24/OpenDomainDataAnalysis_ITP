		<content>    The{clinic}has one full-time and   
 one part-time doctor and one full-time
 assistant doctor. There are four      
 nurses, one health visitor and one    
 full-time nursing officer. The dentist
 has one dental nurse and a chiropodist
 works part time in the clinic. In the 
 practice there are 2461 patients, 303 
 of whom are over the age of 65. About 
 20 babies are born each year.         
    The people of Balfron are more     
 fortunate than most as regards health,
 because they live in an area where    
 there are few{social problems,}little 
 unemployment and where people are well
 motivated to look after themselves.   
 The biggest problem in health care is 
 the growth in the number of elderly   
 people and the amount of{care}which is
 required, both in the community and in
 residential homes and hospitals, to   
 look after them.                      </content>
