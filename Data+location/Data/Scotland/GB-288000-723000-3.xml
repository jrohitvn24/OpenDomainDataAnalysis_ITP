		<title>03TYPES OF FARMING</title>
		<content>   The types of farming in the area    
 vary considerably.  In the lower areas
 arable farming is prodominant with    
 cereals being grown and sold to be    
 used for brewing.  Cattle are kept on 
 some farms and fattened up to be sold 
 for their meat.  They are stored      
 inside in Winter and fed on hay or    
 silage.  On the higher areas sheep    
 rearing is more viable than arable    
 farming due to the gradient of the    
 land and the depth of the soil.  The  
 sheep are kept for their wool rather  
 than their meat and this is then sold 
 at Stirling or Perth market.
