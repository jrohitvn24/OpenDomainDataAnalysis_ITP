		<title>17CROY HOUSING</title>
		<content> Long ago in Croy there were only      
 farmhouses and cottages.Today there   
 are mostly council houses.There are   
 two housing schemes one at DalCroy    
 Road and the other at ArdCroy         
 Road.ArdCroy Road is the bigger with  
 central heated houses.There are not   
 many old people living there because  
 in the winter the electricity         
 sometimes goes off and as there is no 
 heating they could get hypothermia and
 die.They prefer the coal fire houses  
 at DalCroy where I live.All we have is
 a good log fire to keep the house warm
 and it is cheaper than central        
 heating.I prefer DalCroy Road because 
 there are not many cars going up and  
 down making a noise.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
