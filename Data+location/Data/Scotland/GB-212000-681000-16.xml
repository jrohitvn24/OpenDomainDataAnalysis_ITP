		<content>   Rashfield School dinners are not    
 made in this school but come from     
 Sandbank Primary School which is 2    
 miles away.They  are delivered in     
 containers and put in a warming       
 cupboard then served to us at         
 12.15pm.Some people bring packed      
 lunches.                              
   One in every three children at our  
 school do not belong to our schools   
 catchment area.Parents have been able 
 to do this since 1980 when the Parents
 Charter came into force allowing      
 parents to choose which school they   
 wanted their children to go to.       
   Rashfield School does not have any  
 uniform but sweatshirts and teeshirts 
 with the school motto on it are       
 optional.The school motto is        { 
{AIM HIGH. }
