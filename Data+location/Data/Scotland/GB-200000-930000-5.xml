		<title>05INTERVIEW: FORMER TEACHER</title>
		<content>{MISS. D. KERR}taught in{Stoer School  
 from 1961 until 1978. She had attended
 the school herself and remembers when 
 there were around twenty pupils in the
 one classroom and four teachers       
 including the headmaster.She went on  
 to{Glasgow University}and completed   
 her training in{Jordanhill College.   
   In her first teaching post in       
 Glasgow she has 46 pupils to cope     
 with.When she returned to teach in    
 Stoer there were only 12 pupils from  
 Primary 1-7. Even with so few pupils  
 she still felt she was fairly strict, 
 only using the belt as punishment when
 it was necessary to make an example.  
   She also  remembers when there was  
 only a stove to heat the classroom.   
 After one particularly stormy day in  
 1965 when the classroom window blew in
 she convinced the Local Councillor    
 that some improvements were essential.</content>
