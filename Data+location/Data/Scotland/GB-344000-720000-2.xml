		<content> We found out from the old Statistical 
 Account (1795) that the name          
 "Leuchars" may be derived from a      
 Celtic word meaning a 'rushy or       
 marshyflat'.  Others think it is from 
 'lough-yards'.  Anyhow, it shows that 
 the area was low and level, almost a  
 loch, until it was drained in the 18th
 century.  It then became an           
 agricultural and forestry area as well
 as making use of its proximity to the 
 Eden River and North Sea to develop   
 industries.
