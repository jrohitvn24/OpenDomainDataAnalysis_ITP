		<title>01Cava &amp; The Barrel Of Butter</title>
		<content> Cava is about 1.5 kilometre wide.   It
 is covered with heather and peat.     
 Only two people live on Cava, in      
 separate homes.   Two kilometres north
 east of Cava is the islet called the  
 Barrel of Butter.   So named because  
 this was the rent paid for the right  
 to catch seals of the island.   The   
 barrel containing seal oil which was  
 known as butter.   Two kilometres east
 of Cava is a "single point mooring".  
 This is a remote loading point for oil
 terminals on flotta.  The oil is piped
 out to the SPM.  Between Cava and the 
 barrel of butter there there are,     
 underwater, several wrecks of the     
 German navy scuttler in 1919, these   
 are a great attraction for divers.    
 Reputedly this is the best diving in  
 europe.
