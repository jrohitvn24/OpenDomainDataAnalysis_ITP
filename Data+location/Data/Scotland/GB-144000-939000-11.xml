		<content>{HARRIS TWEED} is the basis of economic
 existance on the island.A large       
 percentage of the working people are  
 in this industry.The wool from the    
 sheep is washed,rinsed and dried.Dyes 
 are added.The processed wool from the 
 factory is distributed by lorry to the
 weaver's own home where it is woven on
 a loom.The weaver is self-employed.   
 When the tweed is complete it is      
 collected by a lorry and taken back to
 the factory where it is washed,mended 
 and{THE ORB-MARK}is applied.It is then
 ready for exporting and to be made    
 into clothing. Much of the tweed is   
 exported to the USA, Japan and Europe.
