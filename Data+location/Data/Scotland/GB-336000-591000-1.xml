		<title>01The Upper Ewes Valley</title>
		<content> Ewes Water, a tributary of the River  
 Esk, flows through a typical Border   
 landscape. The main Carlisle -        
 Edinburgh road parallels the river    
 here. There are 2 large hill farms -  
 one privately owned, and one run by a 
 trust - several smallholdings &amp;       
 private houses. The valleys of the    
 Mosspeeble Burn &amp; its tributary       
 streams, along with a strip of land in
 the east of this section, form part of
 a Site of Special Scientific Interest,
 considered by the nationally important
 as an example of Border Uplands. It   
 has a great variety of alpint flora   
 and native trees.                     
 Arkleton is an extensive hill sheep &amp; 
 cattle farm. The trust which runs it  
 studies new approaches to rural       
 development, with emphasis on         
 education &amp; training. Arkleton House  
 is used as a Seminar Centre.          </content>
