		<title>13LIVINGSTON DILEMMA</title>
		<content> In February 1985 Livingston           
 Development Corp. finally decided to  
 refuse{Union Carbide's}plans to erect 
 a gas processing plant in             
 Deans,Livingston.A recent disaster had
 involved Union Carbide's plant in     
{Bhopal,India,}when{2500 people}died   
 after a gas leak at their plant there.
 L.D.C.'s decision followed much debate
 in the area. On the one hand it would 
 provide needed employment and the     
 Company held public meetings to       
 convince the locals that public safety
 would be their most important priority
 but the public protested very         
 forcefully at these meetings. They    
 preferred safety in the environment   
 for themselves and their children.    
 L.D.C. paid heed to{public reaction.  
 Whether the Livingston public were    
 right or wrong,only future generations
 will be able to judge!                </content>
