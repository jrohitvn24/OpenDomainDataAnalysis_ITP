		<content> The Aberfeldy Recreation Centre,      
 situated next to Breadalbane          
 Academy, was opened in late December  
 1984.                                 
 We spoke to Mr.E.Cootes,the manager   
 who told us that the centre was built 
 to give a{much needed facility}to the 
 town -a swimming pool, squash courts, 
 games rooms and other desirable       
 sports.                               
                                       
 The centre could not have been built  
 had the{community}not{raised}the      
{money.                                
                                       
 Mr.Cootes has been working at centres 
 for 15 years,managing in London,      
 Norfolk and the USA.                  
 He said that coming to Aberfeldy had  
 been a challenge to make the ARC work 
 without help from the government.
