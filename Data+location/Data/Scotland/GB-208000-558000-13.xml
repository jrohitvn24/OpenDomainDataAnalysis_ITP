		<title>13The Southern Upland Way</title>
		<content> The Southern Upland Way is a{long     
{distance footpath}which runs from     
 Portpatrick on the East Coast to      
 Cockburnspath on the West.It is 212   
 miles long.It goes through Castle     
 Kennedy village and in front of the   
 school.It then goes through part of   
 the Stair Estate and along the road   
 to New Luce.It opened officially      
 in April 1984.                        
 We interviewed one of the walkers. He 
 is Tom Neville from Glasgow.He had    
 started from Portpatrick on Tuesday   
 and reached us the next day.He thought
 the coast was lovely but did not like 
 the parts on the roads.He had camped  
 near our village so did not need any  
 accomodation. Anyway there are very   
 few places for the walkers to stay    
 when they reach this section.He was   
 looking forward to seeing the Castle  
 Kennedy Gardens.                      </content>
