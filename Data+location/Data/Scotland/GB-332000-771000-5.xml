		<title>05CLOVA CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.</title>
		<content>  Clova Church is a single storied     
 stone building with a wooden  porch at
 the front. The church itself is 13m   
 long and 8m wide. The roof is made of 
 slates. On the roof of the porch there
 is a cross and on the roof of the     
 church there is a bell and a cross.   
 The church can seat about 154 people. 
 There are 4 lattice windows facing    
 South and 1 stained glass window      
 facing East erected in 1968 in memory 
 of local farmer William  Edgar from   
 Rottal. Two of his grand-daughters now
 attend Clova School. The church is in 
 need of repair and has very few       
 services; only occasional services    
 at Easter and Christmas. The last     
 wedding was in September 1979 when 2  
 Canadians were married, the last      
 christening was in August 1983 and the
 last funeral was in 1971.
