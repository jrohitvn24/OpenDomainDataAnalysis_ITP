		<content> Our school is situated on the western 
 edge of our block almost exactly in   
 the centre.   Only about one 1/24th.  
 of our area for study is taken up with
 housing and shops, the rest is        
 farmland.   To the north and west of  
 our school there are the Bathgate     
 Hills which are used by farmers for   
 grazing cattle.                       
      Although the farmers use these   
 large fields, much of it can be       
 visited by young and old people, who  
 can enjoy hillwalking,birdwatching and
 visiting historical sites.   Much of  
 this area is studied by our school as 
 part of our farming and historical    
 studies connected to our Environmental
 Studies.                              
      Most of the houses in the        
 residential areas of our block are old
 council houses,with only two small    
 privately owned estates.              </content>
