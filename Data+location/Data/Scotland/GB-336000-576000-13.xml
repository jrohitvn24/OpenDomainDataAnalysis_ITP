		<title>13A Typical Weekend</title>
		<content> Our family wakes up at about 9.00am to
 9.30am.My mum normally goes out into  
 the garden for 1 to 2 hours so we have
 to make our own breakfast.My dad feeds
 the hens and his pheasant chicks.Me   
 and my brother watch television for   
 about an hour.                        
 When my dad has finished he normally  
 sits down and watches television with 
 us.Sometimes he shouts my mum in to   
 make his breakfast.We usually sit     
 around and listen to the radio .      
 At about a quarter past twelve my mum 
 starts making our dinner.Then we have 
 it when we are ready to eat.I go      
 outside at about 1pm to play          
 football.My mum goes back out again   
 into the garden.                      
 After a bit of playing football I     
 collect the eggs from our hens.From   
 6pm onwards we all stay inside and    
 watch TV until 10.30 when I go to bed.</content>
