		<content> The hamlet of Monimail has 8 houses   
 with a total of 25 people.   There are
 2 farms; Pathcondie, and Sunnybrae    
 which is quite small.                 
 Monimail Parish Kirk is situated      
 between Letham and Monimail.  It was  
 built in 1792 and seats 500 people.   
 An important feature is the laird's   
 gallery.  It was meant for the        
 Melville family who paid for the      
 building of the church.               
 Recently the church was redecorated,  
 carpets were laid, and new lighting   
 was installed.   The present minister,
 the Rev. C. Strong, is our School     
 chaplain.                             
 There is a very old churchyard, no    
 longer in use, and remains of a       
 previous church.
