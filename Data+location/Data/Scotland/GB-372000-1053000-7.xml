		<title>07A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> I get up at 8.00 am and I play with my
 brother while mum makes the breakfast 
 Then mum lifts my brother up and we   
 all have breakfast together.          
 After getting cleaned up I pack my bag
 ready for school.My sister and I cycle
 to school most days but if it is wet  
 dad takes us up in the car.My school  
 starts at 9,00,pm when my techer says 
 the prayer.Usually we do maths next   
 and lots of other things.We have play 
 time then , go back into the          
 classroom.We do some more work and    
 then we have dinner.School finishes   
 at 3.30pm and sometimes my friend     
 comes home with me and  we play a     
 game together,then my friend goes     
 home .We all have tea and watch       
 television ,before bedtime I get      
 washed. I go to bed and sometimes I   
 read in bed before I fall asleep.     
 sleep.                                </content>
