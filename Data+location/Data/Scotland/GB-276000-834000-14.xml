		<content>  The farm is the Estate Farm. The Farm
 Manager lives in the Farm house. The  
 Dairy is now an office. A             
 self_employed joiner works in a small 
 part of the steading.                 
  The farm employs few people nowadays.
 In the last fourteen years people have
 left the area due to lack of work.    
  The farm has mainly cattle and sheep,
 providing calves and lambs for        
 market. The main crop is grass        
 for grazing, silage and hay. Other    
 crops are rape and roots. No          
 grain is grown nowadays. Crops are now
 gathered mechanically.                
  One very encouraging aspect is the   
 attention now being paid to the farm. 
 A new steading has been erected,      
 fences have been repaired and large   
 areas of marshland have been          
 reclaimed.
