		<title>02Population of Crathie</title>
		<content> There is no village as such at        
 Crathie. Most of the community live   
 and work on the Royal Estate or on    
 small holdings up in the hills. In    
 total there are 136 adults and 52     
 children. There are a few homes       
 alongside the Church and next to the  
 school. The former free church is used
 for a church hall. There is a bus     
 service which runs between Braemar and
 Ballater and Aberdeen. Many families  
 find it a necessity to own their own  
 transport. Employment in Aberdeen     
 makes commuting essential for some.   
 There are several families who have   
 lived in the area for a long time. The
 farms in the hills are run on         
 traditional lines with all work being 
 done by members of the family. The    
 children go on to secondary education 
 at Aboyne, about 17 miles away.
