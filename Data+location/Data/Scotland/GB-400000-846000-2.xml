 part of{Mintlaw}which fell within our 
 block.This comprises almost all the   
 original village including all the    
 shops,the pre-war additions to        
 housing,those in{50's,60's}and early {
{70's}and a large private estate built 
{1972-1985}.It does  not include the   
 350 council houses built in {1975-1978
 nor the private housing built in that 
 side of the village in the{80's}.     
   250 responses were received from the
 500 houses in the{Mintlaw}area which  
 was covered i.e.{50%}.The area was    
 canvassed by the pupils over one week 
 during the late afternoons or early   
 evenings.                             
   In {Longside }the whole village was 
 included but the survey was carried   
 out one morning.There were answers
