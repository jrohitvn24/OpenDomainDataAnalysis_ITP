		<title>04OLD TORRY</title>
		<content> Torry lost part of its heritage when  
 3.5 acres of OLD TORRY was razed to   
 make way for oil developments.        
 Gone are the "barking" sheds where    
 endless yards of rope were weather-   
 proofed.Vanished also are the "yawls" 
 which could be seen lying on this     
 south bank of the River Dee.          
 The cooperages which once enjoyed     
 untold prosperity at the turn of the  
 century when Aberdeen exported        
 1,000,0000 barrels of herring a year  
 to Russia alone have also disappeared.
 All that does remain today as a clue  
 to where OLD TORRY once stood is a    
 small white lighthouse known as the   
 "Leading Lighthouse" on Sinclair      
 Road,adjacent to the Shell Oil Base.  
 Also still existing today are a       
 generation of memories of those who   
 had lived in the tiny cottages, but   
 will these memories remain forever?   </content>
