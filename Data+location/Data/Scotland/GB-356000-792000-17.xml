		<title>17BEE-KEEPING IN FINZEAN.</title>
		<content> The ancient art of bee-keeping is     
 still practised by a few residents of 
 the area mainly as a hobby for older  
 people but with one or two youngsters 
 showing a keen interest.One of the    
 apiaries would qualify as a part time 
 occupation for its owner.             
 In early Spring the colonies(in hives)
 are fed sugar and water but, as the   
 season progresses, honey from{tree    
{blossom,clover,bell heather and       
{finally ling heather}is gathered.     
{Finzean heather honey}is particularly 
 popular.It is feared that the growing 
 popularity of oil-seed rape as a crop 
 may spoil local honey.                
 In Autumn the honey is removed from   
 the hive and extracted from the comb  
 often by the old method of 'squeezing'
 and gives an attractive blend in a jar
 selling from Â£1.25 -Â£2.80 .
