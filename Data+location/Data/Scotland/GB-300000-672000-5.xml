		<title>05FARMING: TROUT.</title>
		<content> Near the water sports centre at       
 Beecraigs loch is the fish farm.It was
 the first of its kind  to be developed
 by a local authority in Scotland.     
 Visitors to the farm can see the life 
 cycle of the trout in  different tanks
 on most days throughout the year.     
 The trout farm is operated as a       
 working unit and it supplies fish for 
 the table as well as  stocking rivers 
 and lochs for other local authority   
 areas and angling clubs. It stocks    
 Beecraigs loch as well.               
 Local schools are made very welcome   
 when they are doing a project on      
 trout.They are shown the early stages 
 of trout life by seeing the eggs      
 and alevins  in trays. The visit      
 usually ends with the children being  
 able to feed the trout in the large   
 outside tanks. Herons are a problem.
