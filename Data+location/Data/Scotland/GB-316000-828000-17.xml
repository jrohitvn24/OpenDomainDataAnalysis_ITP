   At Bridgend of Glenlivet  there is a
 picturesque old  bridge  spanning  the
 River  Livet.  It  consists  of a main
 arch in the manner of old bridges. The
 bridge is often attributed to  General
 Wade but it is  now  known  to be much
 older than the  road-making  period of
 that famous engineer.  Very likely the
 bridge was  built in  connection  with
 the Castle of Blairfindy  and  erected
 around the 1580's.                    
   Recently   the   bridge   has   been
 renovated  and  a  new  car-park   and
 picnic site  have  been constructed so
 that tourists can view the bridge.
