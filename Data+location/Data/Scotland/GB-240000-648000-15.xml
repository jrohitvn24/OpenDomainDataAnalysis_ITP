		<content> THE PRESENT CHURCH BUILDING IS 150    
 YEARS OLD. THERE HAS BEEN A CHURCH IN 
 DUNLOP FOR 900 YEARS. THE CHURCH WAS  
 DEMOLISHED AND REBUILT IN 1642.       
 DUNLOP KIRK IS WELL KNOWN FOR ITS     
 WINDOWS ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DONATED
 BY FAMILIES CONNECTED WITH DUNLOP.THE 
 WILSON WINDOW AND GARDEN WERE DONATED 
 IN 1968 BY MR. WILSON OF              
 THORNTONHALL.THE WINDOW DEPICTS THE   
 EVOLUTION OF THE WORLD AND ALL IS HELD
 TOGETHER BY THE CROSS OF SACRIFICE. AT
 NIGHT THE WINDOW IS ILLUMINATED FROM  
 WITHIN WHEN THE EFFECT, AS SEEN FROM  
 THE VILLAGE STREET, IS ARRESTING.     
 THE MOST EYE CATCHING THING OUTSIDE   
 THE CHURCH IS THE HANS HAMILTON TOMB. 
 MR.CURRIE;A WELL KNOWN BROADCASTER AND
 TRAVELLER;IS THE PRESENT MINISTER OF  
 DUNLOP AND HAS BEEN FOR THE PAST 13
