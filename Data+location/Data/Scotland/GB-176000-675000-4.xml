		<title>04Achahoish School</title>
		<content> Achahoish School was in existence in  
 1837 and probably for a long time     
 before that. It was a parochial school
 i.e. it was upheld by the landowner in
 the parish in terms of the Education  
 Act 1696.                             
 The present school is about 300 metres
 from the church. The present building 
 was built of stone in 1900 and        
 incorporates a schoolhouse. The old   
 schoolroom is now used as a room for  
 music, P.E. etc. This building has an 
 attached annexe built in 1966 which   
 has a kitchen and dining room. Meals  
 are cooked on the premises.           
 All teaching in this one_teacher      
 school is now done in a pre_fabricated
 building erected in 1976. It is       
 well_equipped and has a T.V.          
 video_recorder, and a computer. The   
 school's roll in June 1985 was 9      
 ranging in age from 5 to 11 years.    </content>
