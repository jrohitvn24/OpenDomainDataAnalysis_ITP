{"The meeting of the waters".}This     
 reflects the town's position on the   
 watershed between the rivers Forth and
 Clyde.Cumbernauld was designated as a 
 New Town in 1956.Since it's beginning 
 the town has seen steady and continual
 development in population, industry,  
 trade and leisure. The population of  
 Cumbernauld in 1984 is about 50,000-  
 the target population for the end of  
 the century is 70,000.                
    Taking into account all kinds of   
 business there are over 500 firms in  
 Cumbernauld. Some of these companies  
 come from countries overseas such as  
 USA, Sweden, West Germany, Iceland and
 Japan. Land is still available for    
 constructing factories, houses and
