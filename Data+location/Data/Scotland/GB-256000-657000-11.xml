		<title>11BRAIDBAR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school was intended to be used for
{CO-OPERATIVE  TEACHING}               
 This means that each classroom is a{  
{double unit}and can accomodate up to  
 60 children, and two teachers         
 In fact due to{FALLING ROLLS}this is  
 not the case                          
 Most of the double units contain only 
 one class and one teacher. This has   
 meant that we can spread ourselves out
 and have all sorts of interesting     
 areas and corners in our rooms        
 eg Computer Corners, Library Area,    
 Tape Recording spots and quiet corners
 where you can research project topics.
 Unfortunately this year some of our   
 classrooms are to be closed down and  
 classes of different age groups       
 squashed together to save on heating  
 and lighting.
