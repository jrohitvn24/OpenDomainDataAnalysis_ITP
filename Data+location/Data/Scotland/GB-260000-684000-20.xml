		<content>{The statistical survey for the        
{Domesday Project doesn't fit places   
{like this.}According to it we have no 
 bank, library or surgery. Well, these 
 might not be permanent fixtures, but  
 we have them; they come to us on four 
 wheels;  even the Police come in cars.
                                       
 The Bank comes once, the Surgery twice
 per week. They are held in the hall.  
 The Library Van visits weekly and     
 provides the same service as an urban 
 branch library.                       
                                       
 Fish, milk, meat, coal, oil, bottled  
 and bulk gas are all delivered. These 
 just costs more. It's extra tough on  
 those who lack the ability to take    
 advantage of town prices.             
                                       
 Public transport comprises the School,
 Post and once monthly Service Buses.  </content>
