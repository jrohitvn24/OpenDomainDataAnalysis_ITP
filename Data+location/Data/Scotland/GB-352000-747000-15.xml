		<content> "SELLAR'S" was built here in 1978     
 because Letham is central in an       
 agricultural area. It sells new and   
 second-hand tractors, combine and     
 potato harvesters, ploughs and other  
 farm machinery, also workwear and     
 tools. There is a large workshop for  
 servicing and repair of machinery.    
 Sellar's can also make parts in their 
 workshop. Customers come from all over
 Angus, Perthshire and even Orkney and 
 Shetland Isles.They also trade abroad,
 selling second-hand equipment to Ire- 
 land and Turkey while machinery is    
 imported from East Germany.           
   Twenty-two permanent workers,       
 increasing to twenty-five when busy,  
 are employed by the company which     
 originated 160 years ago in Huntly,   
 Aberdeenshire. There are branches in  
 Maud, Blairgowrie, Laurencekirk and   
 Oldmeldrum.                           </content>
