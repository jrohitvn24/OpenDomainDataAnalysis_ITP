		<title>09THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND ALVES</title>
		<content> Alves  Church, a Church of Scotland,  
 is situated half a mile west of the   
 village of Alves. It was built in     
 1878. The congregation of 125 of      
 which 16 have joined in the last two  
 years, come from a wide area around   
 Alves. The Church was linked with     
 Burghead Church in May 1982 so we have
 the same minister, the Rev. Roy       
 McKenzie who came to Alves in October 
 1982. Associated with the church are  
 the Sunday School and the Guild. The  
 Sunday School was only started on     
 Harvest Thanksgiving Day in 1984.
