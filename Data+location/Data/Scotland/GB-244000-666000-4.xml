		<title>04"EXCELSIOR" RECEPTIONIST</title>
		<content> The receptionist has to work shifts:  
 an early shift from 7am till 3pm,or   
 a late shift from 6pm till 11pm.      
     Most days for a receptionist are  
 extremely busy with telephones ringing
 non-stop and people constantly at the 
 desk as they arrive or depart.The main
 duties of a receptionist are to make  
 sure guests arrive safely and enjoy   
 their stay.                           
     "I particularly enjoy dealing with
 guests.But there are exceptions-for   
 example when guests have a little too 
 much to drink and try to annoy me     
 while I am working."                  
     A receptionist needs to have      
 patience and a pleasant personality.At
 the "Excelsior",which is situated     
 beside Glasgow Airport,the            
 receptionists meet lots of famous     
 people,from Duchesses to pop-stars,and
 everybody in between.                 </content>
