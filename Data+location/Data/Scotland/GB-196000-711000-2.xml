		<title>02ORIGIN OF VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Dalavich village was built in 1952.   
 People came here because there were   
 houses and jobs with the{Forestry     
{Commission.                           
   There are many more trees in the    
 forest today than there were years    
 ago.The population of Dalavich has    
 gone down a lot since 1951.When the   
 village started there were only 28    
 wooden houses,then came the stone     
 houses with wooden shingles on the    
 roof,making 44 houses altogether.     
   The bus taking the older children to
 high school in Oban started running in
 1961.                                 
   In 1951 nobody came to Dalavich for 
 a holiday but today holiday-makers    
 come to stay in cabins,which were     
 built 4 years ago.The church is the   
 oldest building in the village.(see   
 page 3).
