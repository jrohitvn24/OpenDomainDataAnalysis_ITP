		<title>15EMPLOYMENT in GLAMIS</title>
		<content>      Up to a generation ago, almost   
 all the people resident in the        
 Glamis area were employed locally.    
 There were many married farm servants 
 or "cottars" and single men in        
 "bothies". The Glamis Estate employed 
 gardeners, gamekeepers, foresters, and
 handymen. There was a bakers,         
 plumbers, blacksmiths, a carpenters   
 shop and a builders yard.             
     Since then, mechanisation has     
 drastically reduced the farm labour   
 force, and economic factors have      
 reduced the Estate staff.  There are  
 still a number of small businesses in 
 the area, and these may have even     
 increased recently.  However, the area
 is increasingly a dormitory for       
 commuters working in Dundee and       
 Forfar.  Among school leavers there is
 little prospect of local employment.
