		<content> The coastal plain around Alness is    
 fairly flat with fertile soils . This 
 combined with a favourable climate,   
 annual precipitation under 750mm.,    
 makes the area well suited for arable 
 farming. The main crops are spring and
 winter barley,wheat and potatoes;     
 grass is grown to provide hay and     
 silage for winter  feeding. Increasing
 quantities of oil-seed rape are being 
 grown because of E.E.C. pricing       
 policies.                             
 In winter sheep from nearby hill farms
 are brought down to the sheltered     
 lowland where most of the lambing     
 takes place.The main farm within the  
 study area,Dalmore Farm, also breeds  
 horses.                               
 Most lambs and calves produced locally
 are sold at Dingwall or Inverness.
