		<content>   {PRESSMENNAN FOREST TRAIL}          
 The trail opened in 1971 and is about 
 2 miles long.It can be walked in less 
 than 2 hours.In some places you can   
 get a good view of Stenton and lots of
 other places round about and also the 
 coast line.                           
            {Pressmennan }was once part
 of Beil estate.Now it belongs to the  
 Forestry Commission.It was once famous
 for its oakwoods but since 1955 other 
 species have been planted with the oak
 thus making fuller use of the ground. 
          From the picnic area you can 
 see the mouth of the River Tyne.In the
 foreground on the opposite side of the
 lake lies {Pressmennan }farm which is 
 an example of stone and pantile farm  
 steadings built in the late 18th      
 century throughout East Lothian.      
          We love to go up to {        
{Pressmennan }for a walk.{             </content>
