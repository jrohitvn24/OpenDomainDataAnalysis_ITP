		<title>01General Review East: FINTRY</title>
		<content> The area which people, who live here, 
 think of as Fintry, covers 4 squares  
 of this Domesday Survey. See also:    
                                       
{   02600687, 02600684, 02560687       
                                       
 This is an area of hill farming and   
 forestry. A peaceful and isolated area
 yet within thirty minutes driving from
 Glasgow. There is also a reservoir.   
                                       
 The two roads lead out of the village 
 to the east and south. The latter, one
 of Scotland's highest passes, is much 
 used by those who work in Glasgow.    
{There may be no traffic lights, but   
{watch out for low cloud and sheep.    
                                       
 At times snow blocked in winter, when 
 skiers come into their own, in summer,
 there is much gentle hill walking for 
 those who respect the countryside.    </content>
