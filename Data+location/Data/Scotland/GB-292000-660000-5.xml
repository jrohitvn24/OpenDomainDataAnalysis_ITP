		<content>            But  if  he  doesn't  break
 through  however ,the  team  that  he 
 didn't get through gets him. We  go on
 playing that until the bell rings.When
 it does, we  count  how many people we
 have and then  see  who  has  the most
 people and the team with most wins.   
            Dinnertime  comes  after   
 doing  work like  maths  or  First Aid
 in English, which come after playtime.
            After  dinnertime , which  
 lasts for  an hour, we go back to work
 with  something like project. We go on
 with  project until 3.00 then we start
 to tidy up.                           
            We  go home at 3.20. I then
 go a few  errands  or help to tidy the
 house. If  there  is enough time after
 that  I  can  either go out to play or
 stay in  to  watch {T.V.}I have dinner
 at 5.00 and play or stay in to discuss
 our day at work.{                     </content>
