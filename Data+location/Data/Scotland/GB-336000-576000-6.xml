		<content>{PLAYGROUND GAMES IN SCHOOL}           
                                       
  Children  of a younger age at our    
 school play chasing games; for example
 'stuck in the mud' and also 'pak man'.
 We found that the boys play games     
 which seemed to be more energetic. The
 girls went for quieter games such as  
 families and mummys especially.       
                                       
  As we go up the age group the girls  
 get mixed more in with the boys. Girls
 from the ages 9 and 10 were delighted 
 if they played races with the boys.   
                                       
  Nothing very exciting went on in the 
 age group of 11 and 12. Mostly all the
 boys played sporty activities.        
 Sometimes the older boys played       
 king_ball and last on high which are  
 forms of tig. The girls just wandered 
 around all break feeling very bored.  </content>
