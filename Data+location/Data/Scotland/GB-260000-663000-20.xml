		<content> This is a large area of vegetation    
 situated only 4km. from the city      
 centre, where the Clyde cuts a big    
 meander on the south bank. It is      
 generally flat, about 6 metres above  
 river level. Old mine shafts run      
 underneath and subsidence has taken   
 place. Dumping stopped about 15 years 
 ago and nature has almost reclaimed   
 the area. Plants such as giant        
 hogweed, japanese knotweed, butter    
 burr and willowherb cover the site.   
 There are also thickets of goat willow
 , hawthorn and elder. If left the area
 could revert to oak forest. Wildlife  
 is  abundant - heron, mallard, fox,   
 rabbit, mouse and mole. Mostly used by
 dogwalkers and naturalists, its future
 is undecided. At present when         
 Glasgow's wild areas are disappearing 
 fast it is a valuable urban wildlife  
 resource.                             </content>
