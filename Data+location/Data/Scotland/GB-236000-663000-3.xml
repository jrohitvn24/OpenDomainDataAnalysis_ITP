		<title>03BRIDGE OF WEIR - FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> My name is{Suzanne}.I am 11 years old 
 and there are 5 people in my family.  
 This is a typical Saturday for us.    
   My{dad}is a farmer.He does different
 jobs on a Saturday depending on the   
 weather.At the moment he is cutting   
 and lifting silage for the cows'      
 winter feed.My{mum}usually shops in   
 the morning and bakes in the          
 afternoon.My eldest brother{William   
 who works on the farm  attends        
 Oakridge Agricultural College near    
 Edinburgh on a  Saturday.{Hugh}who is 
 still at school helps my dad in the   
 morning and supports his football team
 in the afternoon.I help tidy up the   
 milking parlour after milking is over.
 Best of all I like to feed the calves 
 and help mum bake.                    
   In the evening we all go to check on
 dad's cows on other land close by at  
 Howwood,Inchinnan and Bishopton.      </content>
