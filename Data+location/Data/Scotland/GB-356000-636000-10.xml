		<content>{ Arable,sheep and beef}are the three  
 main types of agriculture.Farming is  
 easier now and a better business      
 because farmers have more machinery.  
  In{arable}farming, a large area is   
 grass.Some is used for hay and silage.
 Silage is used for feeding cattle and 
 is stored in a pit.There are some new 
 crops being grown such as oil seed    
 rape and peas.Oats are not so popular 
 but in the olden days they were very  
 popular.Turnips are grown as fodder   
 for sheep.                            
{ Sheep}farming is popular because of  
 the type of land.Lambing is normally  
 in Spring-the lambs being sold at     
 Newtown St Boswells.                  
{ Beef}cattle are fattened on hay and  
 barley before they go to the market   
 where they are sold to the butcher who
 takes them to be slaughtered.
