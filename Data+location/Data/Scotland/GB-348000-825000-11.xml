		<title>11AN INTERESTING SUNDAY</title>
		<content> On Sunday my family and I went to     
 Graigevar Castle which was pure pink. 
 Outside there were two huge trees, one
 was measured 90 feets and the other 80
 feet in 1975. They were presents from 
 Canada. The castle was seven storeys  
 high. It was built in 1625. It said   
 this in nearly every ceiling of the   
 castle, there were at least 4 or 5    
 rooms on each floor. It used to be a  
 guest house until 1972 when it was    
 given to the National Trust. There    
 were two rooms, one of them was a     
 nursery and another for upto 18 years 
 old. They were not allowed out of the 
 castle till then. There was one room  
 which was called The Tarten Room,     
 opposite this room was The Blue Room. 
 We were not allowed to go all the way 
 up because the castle was getting old 
 and it would not hold all of us if we 
 went up.                              </content>
