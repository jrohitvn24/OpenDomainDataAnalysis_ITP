		<content> Here are examples of some of the      
 fashionable clothes in use by         
 Musselburgh youth.  The wellknown     
 names in jeans are Inega and Levis.   
 Most young people shop in Edinburgh   
 in shops such as Chelsea Girl, Top    
 Shop, Clockhouse, Dorothy Perkins.    
 Young ladies like to wear long black, 
 blue, or cerise skirts, and long      
 shirts.  They also like coloured boots
 with flat heels.  Young men like to   
 wear trousers which are baggy at the  
 top and tight at the legs and black   
 flat heeled shoes.  For hairstyles    
 flat-tops (like crew cut) are         
 fashionable.  For lipstick the        
 fashionable colour is pinky-purple.   
 For jewellry, diamante earings and    
 broaches are worn.  Young men like to 
 wear leather ties and pink and yellow 
 shirts.
