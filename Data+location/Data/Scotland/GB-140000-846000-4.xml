    The area in question consists      
 mainly of rough pastures and          
 marshland.There are only a very small 
 number of people living here and these
 are mainly the older generation as    
 this area,like many others,is         
 suffering from rural depopulation.    
 There are just not enough jobs for the
 up and coming generation.             
        This area is as you would      
 imagine a typical Highland village to 
 be like.The small houses are situated 
 near the river as this is where the   
 best land is.There is little or no    
 recreational facilities except what   
 nature has provided.                  
     The main road runs close by and   
 this links this community with the    
 rest of the island of SKYE.
