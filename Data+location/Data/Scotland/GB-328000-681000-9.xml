		<content> Today the majority of the island is   
 neglected and overgrown. This makes   
 the island trecherous as the          
 undergrowth conceals many crevices and
 holes. In the past animals have been  
 kept on the island. In the 16th       
 century French troops were garrisoned 
 there and there horses thrived on the 
 lush grass. In the early 19th century 
 the lightkeeper and his family keep 7 
 cows on the island. There are no      
 animals kept on the island today but  
 the Principal lightkeeper has managed 
 to successfully cultivate a vegatable 
 garden on the slopes below the        
 lighthouse.
