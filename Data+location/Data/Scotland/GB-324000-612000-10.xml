   There is the Womens Rural Institute,
 which has a meeting on a Tuesday night
 once a month.It runs from September to
 May.The Badminton club is on a Wednes-
 day night and there is a junior club  
 which is held before the seniors. The 
 Keep Fit club runs when the junior    
 badminton is on so that the mums can  
 come to the keep fit whilst their     
 children are at badminton.There is a  
 bowling club held every Thursday night
 in the Winter.The monthly Whist is for
 any body to join in if they can play. 
   The Badminton and Bowlers sometimes 
 run matches and tournaments to play   
 other clubs in the Borders.The Bowlers
 also have open tournaments.           
   At the end of the Badminton and     
 Bowling season they both join up and  
 have a dance at which they present the
 prizes.                               </content>
