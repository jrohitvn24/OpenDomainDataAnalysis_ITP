		<content> Housing schemes around{Westmarch      
{Primary School}include                
 Westmarch,Kirkton,Trottick and        
 Downfield. Most of the housing is     
 situated near to the foothills of the 
 Sidlaw Hills. Because of this there is
 a lot of natural wildlife in and      
 around the area in the form of        
 mammals, insects and birds as well as 
 the odd schoolboy! Semi-detached      
 houses with gardens make up most of   
 the housing but there are also        
 tenements, bungalows, maisonettes,    
 multi-storeys and detached houses.    
{The Dighty Burn}flows parallel to     
 Harestane Road (across from our       
 school).At the moment it is really    
 rather a mess, but if it was cleaned  
 up it could be a nice place to visit. 
 It would take a long time to do this  
 but in the end it would be worth it.  
 Plants could be put in to improve it. </content>
