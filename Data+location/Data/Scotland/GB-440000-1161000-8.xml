		<title>08Peat Cutting in Voe.</title>
		<content> Peat provides many local families with
 a cheap form of fuel.                 
 Firstly the peat bank has to be       
 flaaed.This means you cut away the    
 heather and turf to get to the peat.  
 Then you cast the peats using a       
 tushkar and build the peats into a    
 dyke.The dyke has little gaps in it   
 that the wind blows through to dry the
 peats.                                
 The peats are then raised.This means  
 they are set up in pyramids to dry off
 completely.                           
 Now the peats are ready to be taken   
 home,usually by tractor and trailer.  
 Some people put the peats in bags     
 before loading them onto the trailer. 
 A peat cutting machine is now         
 available to hire at Â£20 per hour. It 
 cuts the peats in cylindrical shapes  
 and speeds up the casting process.
