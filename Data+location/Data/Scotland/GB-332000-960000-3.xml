		<title>03THE CASTLES</title>
		<content> There are two castles in the block.   
{OLD KEISS CASTLE}was built by the     
 Sinclair family in the late 16th.C, on
 top of cliffs which jut out into the  
 sea. The defence of the castle was    
 also helped by the design. Extra      
 turrets were built at two corners so  
 that marksmen could shoot across the  
 front of the walls, not just outwards.
 Only the outer walls remain. It is a  
 favourite walk for some, along the    
 shore and up to the castle.           
                                       
{NEW KEISS CASTLE}is much younger,     
 building commencing in 1763. It       
 is now owned by a family which comes  
 for holidays during the summer time.  
 Visitors - often Americans - go there 
 for holidays.  A family lives there   
 all the time looking after the castle.
