		<content>    Our school, St.Thomas R.C.Addiewell
 is unique.It is the only school in    
 Scotland to share a building with the 
 village's non denominational school to
 the extent that does.                 
    The school opened in 1978 and was  
 built to replace two separate schools.
 It is an open_plan building with four 
 main teaching blocks,two of which are 
 used by St.Thomas and two by Addiewell
 Primary.                              
    Although there are two headteachers
 there is only one secretary and one   
 janitor.The pupils and staffs work    
 very closely together.They share a    
 dining room and a staffroom as well   
 as large items of equipment such as a 
 photocopier and a video.Pupils go on  
 outings together,on residential visits
 as well as combining for football and 
 other team sports.
