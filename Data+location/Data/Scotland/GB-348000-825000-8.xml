		<content> dinner.   We had mince, potatoes and  
 cabbage and for pudding we had a thing
 which my sister made. After dinner I  
 got on my bike again and went over to 
 the farm, my friends were already     
 there when I got there, then they told
 me that they were taking cows out of  
 the sheds to go back to the fields. We
 thought when all the cows had gone out
 to fields the sheds all seemed bare   
 without cows, though we thought       
 it was great to go all through the    
 sheds  without disturbing the cows.
