		<content> For quite some time, Larbert seems to 
 have been the biggest village in the  
 immediate vicinity. For centuries it  
 had the{parish}church for the area.In 
 1881, its{population}was 6346, but by 
 1981, the population had shrunk to    
 4963, while that of Stenhousemuir,    
 2617 in 1881,had increased by 1982 to 
 9417 and is still increasing as a     
 result of private housing developments
 moving to the N.E. in the direction of
 the motorway. Stenhousemuir has       
 developed in recent times because of  
 its location,and seems to be becoming 
 a{dormitory}town.Out of 126 parents   
 questioned at a local primary         
 school,only 44 find{employment}in the 
 Stenhousemuir/Larbert area,while 27   
 worked in Falkirk,6 in Grangemouth and
 49 elsewhere _outwith the area.
