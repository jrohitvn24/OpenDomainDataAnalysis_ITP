		<content>       I rose about 9.ooa.m.because it 
 was the weekend.Then I mixed up a     
 gallon of calves' milk for Kevie, my  
 pet calf.(Kevie was bought to replace 
 a dead calf but then the dead calf's  
 mother died.So I was pleased to get   
 Kevie to look after. She is a Hereford
 Friesian cross and she is black,brown 
 and white.)The milk is a mixture of   
 warm water and milk powder.I get the  
 powder in the new shed and the water  
 in the kitchen.                       
    After that I went round the sheep  
 in three fields on my bike to see if  
 there were any on their backs.If they 
 stay on their backs they blow up and  
 die.But there weren't any.Then I had  
 my breakfast of bacon on toast and    
 juice.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
