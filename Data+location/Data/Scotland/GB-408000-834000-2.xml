		<title>02LOCAL HISTORY OF CRUDEN BAY.</title>
		<content> Fourteen people were interviewed. They
 had lived in Cruden Bay all or almost 
 all their lives, Most people in Cruden
 Bay went to Port Erroll School. They  
 used slates instead of jotters. In    
 their spare time some played football 
 or golf.                              
         Cruden Bay had a lot of       
 herring boats long ago. People left   
 school when they were fourteen. Some  
 got jobs like fishermen. The pay was  
 1O shillings a week. Others worked in 
 the local hotels or in the laundry.   
         Few people remembered the     
 castle being occupied, however many   
 could recall the famous peole who came
 to the large Cruden Bay Hotel in the  
 1920's and 30's. The Hotel was taken  
 over by the army  during the war and  
 closed in 1948. After that the Hotel  
 was demolished. All interviewed said  
 they liked Cruden Bay long ago.       </content>
