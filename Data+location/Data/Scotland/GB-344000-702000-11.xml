		<content>  In the hall a Playgroup is held two  
 mornings a week and a Mother and      
 Toddler group also meets there.  A    
 Youth Club is held one night a week   
 and three age groups of badminton     
 use the hall regularly on winter      
 evenings.                             
  Other activities are a weekly Sunday 
 School, a monthly meeting of The      
 Church Women's Guild and a monthly    
 meeting of The Women's Rural Institute
   Every Thursday afternoon, in the    
 coal-fired reading room of the        
 Library, the Social Club for Senior   
 Citizens meets.  The villagers fund   
 raise a lot for this club to give them
 a dinner at Christmas and to hire     
 buses to take them a summer time drive
 and treat them to high tea.
