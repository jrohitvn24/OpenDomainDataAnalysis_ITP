		<title>05SHOPPING IN BREICH VALLEY</title>
		<content>    In our area there is not a big     
 choice of shops.All three villages    
 have general stores and a Post Office.
 It is  possible to buy papers, small  
 gifts, sweets and groceries.However   
 there is not a wide choice and goods  
 are quite expensive.                  
    To buy clothes, hardware,          
 electrical goods etc.{people}have to  
{travel}to  one of the bigger towns    
 such as{Bathgate or Livingston.       
 Livingston is particulary popular for 
{weekly}food shopping because it has a 
 selection of large supermarkets and   
 because one of the supermarkets runs a
 free bus from this area on Tuesdays   
 and Fridays.                          
  The only chemist shop in the area is 
 in Stoneyburn.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
