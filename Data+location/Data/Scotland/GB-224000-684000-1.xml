		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE RHU AREA</title>
		<content> The D_Block which has been allocated  
 to our school lies just north of the  
 Highland Boundary Fault Line which    
 separates the Highlands of Scotland   
 from the Lowlands and is centred on   
 the Gareloch which is a fiord formed  
 by a glacier gouging down the valleys 
 to join the Clyde glacier.The block   
 takes in most of our village of       
 Rhu,the adjoining community of Shandon
 and the village of Clynder which lies 
 across the Gareloch on the Rosneath   
 Peninsula.All three communities are   
 similar in character in that they are 
 all rural districts with little scope 
 for extensive development due to the  
 nature of the terrain and therefore,  
 not densely populated with a total of 
 less than 2,500.Although in an area of
 scenic beauty,we tend to receive      
 mainly passing tourists which explains
 the lack of guest houses in our block.</content>
