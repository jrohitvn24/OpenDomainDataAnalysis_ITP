		<title>05Mains of Greenlaw</title>
		<content> This farm lies on both sides of the   
 main Ayr to Castle Douglas road.      
 Beside the road is an old track,      
 surrounded by trees, used nowadays for
 farm vehicles. It used to be a railway
 line.                                 
 The main crop on the farm is          
 intensively managed grass, used for   
 grazing sheep and cattle. Occasionally
 crops of barley are grown.            
 Near the Mains of Greenlaw is a mote  
 which still stands out, although worn 
 away. Also in that area is Greenlaw   
 Mansion which was a hotel until it    
 burned down in 1984.
