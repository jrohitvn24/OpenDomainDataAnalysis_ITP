		<title>07View From School Window 1</title>
		<content>    It is not a pretty sight, the view 
 from my school.   It shows rows of    
 houses, leaning on each other, as     
 though tired. The streets are deserted
 as if there's a bomb scare.   In the  
 distance there's a path which is like 
 a great snake slithering out of the   
 ground.                               
      The trees are restless and have  
 an urge to be up.  To the right we see
 a great mass of green rigid branches, 
 mesmerized by something.   On the     
 horizon vast armies of bushes are     
 ready to march .                      
      The sky is like a blue blanket   
 with bits of stuffing coming out.     
 Every now and then a bird flies by,out
 of place, against the blueness of the 
 sky.                                  
     The tall, slender lamposts are    
 like guardians watching over the      
 sleepy houses.   The cars are speeding</content>
