		<content>  Two hundred years ago, Rogart Hotel  
 was a croft house. Next, it became the
 Post Office. For the last number of   
 years it has been an hotel.           
  The Maclennan family, three brothers 
 and a sister, own it. Mr Charles Angus
 is their manager and he supervises the
 daily running of the hotel.           
  In the summer-time, visitors from all
 parts of the world, come to stay in   
 the small hotel. For the remainder of 
 the year it is a public house and     
 restaurant.                           
  The ever open hotel supplies meals,  
 bar lunches, coffee, tea,             
 non-alcoholic drinks, sweets,crisps   
 and alcoholic drinks. Whisky is the   
 most popular drink and fish and chips 
 are the most popular item on the menu.
  Games played in the hotel are pool,  
 darts, dominoes and cards. There is a 
 video machine too.                    </content>
