		<title>08     Barr's Irn Bru</title>
		<content> Barr's Mineral Water Factory is       
 situated in the Gallowgate near       
 Parkhead Cross. They have been in     
 business for l50 years and their most 
 famous product is 'Irn Bru'. (Made    
 from Girders). Irn Bru has a secret   
 recipe known only to Mr Robin Barr. It
 is sold to many countries, including  
 Canada, the U.S.A. and the Middle     
 East. Approximately l million bottles 
 of Irn Bru are produced in one week   
 and a normal year sees the production 
 of about 44 million bottles.          
 Many other flavours of mineral drinks 
 are made by Barrs, and their raw      
 ingredients are imported from many    
 countries including China, Germany,   
 Ireland and Cuba.                     
 They already have one very modern     
 bottling plant, and are hoping to     
 renew their other, older plant in the 
 near future.                          </content>
