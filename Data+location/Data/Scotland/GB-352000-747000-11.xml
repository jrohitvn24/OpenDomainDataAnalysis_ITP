		<title>11THE POTATO HARVEST</title>
		<content>   In October potatoes are             
 harvested.Sometimes a machine is used 
 but more often casual workers are     
 employed.Housewives and school        
 children earn from Â£9.00 for a "WHOLE 
 BIT" to Â£4.50 for a "HALF BIT" per    
 day.                                  
   Until last year school children had 
 2 weeks holiday at this time but in   
 1984 there was only 1 week allowed.   
 Fortunately the weather was good and  
 the potatoes were harvested as usual. 
   The farmers, teachers and others    
 protested and so this year in October 
 the holiday will be 2 weeks as before.
   Potato-harvesters (machines) are    
 improving and may soon take over from 
 people.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
