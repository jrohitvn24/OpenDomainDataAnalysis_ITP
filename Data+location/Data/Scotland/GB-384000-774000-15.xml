		<content> In {KINNEFF CHURCH}there are          
 approximately 300 in the congregation.
 About 30_35 go every Sunday. On       
 average there are 4 funerals, 10      
 christenings and 6 marriages a year.  
 The church is always open and holds a 
 service each Sunday.Between 10 and 20 
 children attend Sunday school.10      
 teenagers attend Bible Class, where   
 there is one leader.                  
 Since the church was built in 1843    
 there have been 7 ministers. Our      
 minister has been here for just over 2
 years. He is in charge of Arbuthnott  
 church too. There is a plan for the   
 future to link Kinneff, Arbuthnott    
 with Inverbervie churches. There are 8
 elders, 2 of them are women. Kinneff  
 Church is {PRESBYTERIAN.}Communion is 
 held twice a year. The congregation is
 responsible for the church bills but  
 the{CHURCH of SCOTLAND}helps.         </content>
