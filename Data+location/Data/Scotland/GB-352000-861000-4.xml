		<title>04 FARMING  AROUND  FORDYCE</title>
		<content>            - GENERAL -                
                                       
 There are 13 farms ranging from  60 to
 80 hectares.  Most of the buildings   
 date from the end of the 19th Century,
 and most are Mixed Farms.  The main   
 crop is Barley,although Oil Seed Rape 
 is common,and much of the ground is   
 used for grazing.  Oats and Wheat are 
 also grown, with Potatoes and Turnips 
 the main vegetables. Crops are usually
 well watered by plentiful rainfall,but
 water for animals is obtained from    
 springs on Knock Hill,Durn Hill and   
 other uplands.  Some farmers have as  
 many as 175 cattle,others as many as  
 350 sheep,for breeding or rearing     
 and selling to market.  There is only 
 l piggery which has recently changed  
 hands. All farms have very modern     
 machinery.  Much of the land is still 
 leased from Seafield Estates.         </content>
