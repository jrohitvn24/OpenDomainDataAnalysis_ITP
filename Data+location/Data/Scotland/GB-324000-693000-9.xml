		<title>09Housing in Kirkcaldy</title>
		<content> On the north side of {Kirkcaldy} there
 is the {Dunnikier}housing estate which
 is one of the biggest private {Wimpey}
 estates in Britain. There are over    
 1200 houses and they are still        
 building terraced, one and two bedroom
 houses costing from Â£22110 to Â£29680. 
 The firm cannot build on some pieces  
 of ground because of the old coal mine
 workings dug by monks.The types of    
 houses built so far are - villas,semi-
 detached, bungalow and chalet.Starting
 after the war the Town Council built  
 terraced and semi- detached houses    
 then in the 1950s going west there are
 3 storey blocks ,terraced houses then 
 6 storey blocks of flats. At the edge 
 of the town in the Torbain area there 
 is dense housing with service areas   
 and parking. This also includes small 
 blocks of sheltered housing for       
 elderly people.                       </content>
