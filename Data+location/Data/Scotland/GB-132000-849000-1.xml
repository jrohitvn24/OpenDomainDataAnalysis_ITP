		<title>01EDINABANE - PAST AND PRESENT</title>
		<content> Edinbane was planned as a model       
 village by Macleod of Greshornish over
 a century ago. The houses were built  
 on the hill-face beside a line of     
 springs. In Lower Edinbane he built a 
 school, a hospital, a mill and an inn;
 the first two still occupying the same
 sites, but modernized and extended.   
 Later lairds built a small            
 hydro-electric scheme serving the     
 lodge, the school and the hospital.   
 When the river was low, the power     
 sometimes failed. A private suply of  
 spring water was piped to the same    
 buildings and can be used today when  
 mains water supply is interrupted. A  
 belt of trees, planted about sixty    
 years ago to screen the lodge acts as 
 a windbreak in Lower Edinbane. A small
 hall, gifted to the township, is still
 used by the community.
