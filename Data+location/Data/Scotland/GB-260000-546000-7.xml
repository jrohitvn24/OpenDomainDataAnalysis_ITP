		<content> At one end of the building stands a   
 two storey stone built building which 
 is the local primary school.  The size
 of the building indicates that it once
 housed many more pupils.  It is known 
 as Borgue Academy and was built about 
 1802.  Secondary work continued at the
 school until 1947, after which all    
 children over 12 travelled to         
 Kirkcudbright Academy, 6 miles away.  
 Now we have only two classes - P1-3   
 and P4-7, as our numbers have dwindled
 to about 33.  This is probably because
 machinery has taken over man power on 
 the farms, and over the years there   
 has been a steady dwindling of people 
 away from the country into the towns. 
 However, a wide and varied curriculum 
 is taught, and children leaving the   
 school at 12 cope well with their     
 secondary education.
