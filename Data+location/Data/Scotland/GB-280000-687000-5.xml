		<title>05FARMING   PLEAN &amp; COWIE AREA</title>
		<content>   The main crop grown in this area has
 been{barley.}However, with declining  
 profits farmers are now turning to{oil
{seed rape and protein peas.}There are 
 now only{four dairy farms}in the area 
 so turnips are no longer in much      
 demand for feeding. As grain crops are
 no longer required for fodder they are
 sold.                                 
   In recent years beef requirements   
 have slumped because health conscious 
 people are reducing their red meat    
 consumption. Dairy farmers face a     
 compulsory reduction in milk output   
 due to Common Market milk quotas. Many
 farmers are turning to sheep rearing. 
   With decreasing profits, a more     
 efficient grassland management is     
 called for and farmers take a first   
 cutting of hay in July and a bonus    
 crop of round bale silage in October.
