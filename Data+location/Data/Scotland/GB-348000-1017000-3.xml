		<title>03FARMING IN 1911</title>
		<content> A long time ago{farming}was very hard 
 because there were no tractors or     
 combine harvesters.Everything had to  
 be done with horses or by hand.       
 On the{Waltness}farm there were six   
{Clydesdale}horses altogether.Two men  
 looked after them. Every day for an   
 hour they were groomed and had fresh  
 bedding.                              
{Farm servants  had to get up at 5am.  
 Breakfast was at 6am before going out 
 to work in the fields. At 11am they   
 fed the cows. The men got dinner of   
 tatties  pork and kale at 11.30am     
 A lot of turnips were grown on the    
 farm for the animals and the          
 people.Most of them were sent to      
 Shetland.                             
{The main crop was oats or bere}to be  
 ground in the mill at{Elwick.}The     
 farmer always kept a big pig fattened 
 up.They also had a lot of hens.       </content>
