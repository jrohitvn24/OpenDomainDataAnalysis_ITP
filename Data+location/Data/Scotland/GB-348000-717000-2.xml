		<title>02CONSERVATION OF SAND DUNES</title>
		<content> The sand dunes, running parallel to   
 West Sands Road, end just before Out  
 Head,the road being built on the      
 disused rubbish tip for St.Andrews.   
 They have been worn down by wind      
 coming off the sea, and by frequent   
 public use of the area. Hollows in    
 some of the dunes have been formed by 
 erosion and are used as picnic areas. 
 Over the years, the dunes have moved  
 about 100 yards further inland and the
 sea has encroached so that land is    
 being rapidly eroded.                 
 To preserve the dunes nearer the town,
 they have been fenced in to prevent   
 the public from using them as a       
 sheltered picnic area. Spruce trees   
 have also been planted to discourage  
 people from using the area. Plants    
 such as Sea Lyme and Marram Grass are 
 common and help to stabilize the      
 dunes.                                </content>
