 Pollok House is situated 3/4 of a mile
 from the Pollokshaws Road entrance of 
 Pollok Country Park. The house dates  
 from l752 and its design may have been
 influenced by the Scottish architects 
 Wm. and John Adam.  The outside of the
 house, a rather austere appearance,   
 contrasts sharply with the lavish     
 interior decoration.                  
 Perhaps the most famous of all the    
 collections within the house is the   
 Stirling Maxwell Collection of        
 paintings, which includes works by El 
 Greco, Goya, Murilla and the British  
 artist, Wm Blake. Also worth          
 mentioning is the tea room in the     
 house -  a restored Edwardian kitchen 
 and its most striking feature is a 3O 
 ft cast iron range complete with water
 driven spit.
