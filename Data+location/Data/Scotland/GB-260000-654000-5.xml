		<content>  The roads in East Kilbride are spec- 
 ially planned to keep through traffic 
 away from shopping centres. From the  
 main roads access to the residential  
 neighbourhoods is usually by means of 
 secondary roads feeding off from the  
 many roundabouts in the town, a feat- 
 ure which gives the town its Citizen  
 Band name of Polo Mint City. The main 
 road running through our area is the  
 A726 (Queensway) which takes traffic  
 to the south-west of Glasgow and      
 Paisley. From this road we have access
 to various areas of East Kilbride from
 the various roundabouts; to the Peel  
 Park planned development (see page 4),
 to the College Milton factories, to   
 the hospital at Hairmyres or further  
 to Kilmarnock via the B764, to Murray,
 Westwood or West Mains neighbourhoods,
 to the Town Centre, or to the National
 Engineering Laboratories.             </content>
