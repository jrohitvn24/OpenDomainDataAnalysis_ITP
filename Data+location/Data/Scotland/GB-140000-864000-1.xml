		<title>01The upland NE of Uig, Skye</title>
		<content> The upland is steeply sloping heather 
 and scrub moorland falling to the     
 west. Its eastern border ends in a    
 sheer cliff face of 300ft, a section  
 of the Trottenish Ridge. The area is  
 dissected by several streams which    
 form gorges and water falls. The area 
 is totally uninhabited and use is     
 almost exclusively sheep grazing and  
 marginal cattle grazing. Small pockets
 of the area are still used for non-   
 commercial peat cutting. The region is
 the natural habitat to varied bird and
 wildlife including eagles, otters,    
 buzzards and fox. Numerous species of 
 alpine and native flora exist         
 including wild orchid.
