		<content>{THE SHOP                              
 The small grocery supermarket is      
 situated at the crossroads in the     
 centre of the village.   The shop is  
 open each week day and Saturdays with 
 early closing on Thursdays. Newspapers
 may be bought there, having been      
 delivered by bus at 12.50am.  Milk may
 be purchased from the shop, but early 
 morning deliveries are not made to    
 homes.  The milk cartons are put out  
 at various places in the village by   
 the shopkeeper and customers go       
 to collect the number of pints they   
 have ordered. Customers pay for their 
 milk weekly at the shop.
