		<content>  There is no evidence of poverty in   
 this area. Most residents are very    
 prosperous and there is no  male      
 unemployment in the area. There has   
 been an increase in the number of     
 young residents who look to the       
 nearby city of Aberdeen to provide    
 both education and employment since   
 the oil industry arrived in the       
 1970's.                               
  This is a stable, mature society     
 which does not readily take up new    
 ideas which are seen by some as       
 overtly fashionable and wholly urban  
 concerns.                             
  One issue of concern is the condition
 of the environment. Residents, schools
 and District Council have worked hard 
 together to build a strong awareness  
 of the need to care for the area and  
 its natural beauty.
