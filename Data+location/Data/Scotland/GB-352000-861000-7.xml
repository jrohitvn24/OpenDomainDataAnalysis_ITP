 Fordyce Castle,which was built in 1592
 by Sir Thomas Menzies,is a picturesque
 old tower house built with an L-plan  
 structure.The rooms of the main       
 building are original,and decorative  
 mouldings have been revealed in the   
 recent renovations,especially the     
 sculptured monogram of the founder,the
 Laird of Durn.The Castle has been     
 bought by an American who,at present, 
 lives in Portugal.The 18th century    
 wing of the castle,which was occupied 
 by various tenants up until 1972,has  
 been modernised.     Many other houses
 having links with the past have been  
 restored,e.g.Academy Hse.,Old School  
 Hse.,Anvil Cottage &amp; Haughton Cottage 
 which used to be the old inn.
