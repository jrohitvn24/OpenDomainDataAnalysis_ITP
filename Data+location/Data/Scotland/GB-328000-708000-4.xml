		<title>04A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> A{typical day}for me would be to get  
 up at{7.30a.m. and get washed.}I then 
 have my breakfast of{tea and toast. At
{8.15a.m.}I go to the{newsagent}to     
 collect my{newspapers}and then deliver
 them. I go home and have a{short rest.
 At 8.30a.m. I collect my{schoolbag}and
{badminton racquet. After saying       
{goodbye}I head for school at{8.40a.m. 
 Arriving at school I put my bag in the
 line and have a game of{football}for  
{15 minutes. I spend the morning doing 
{maths, language and reading. In the   
{afternoon I either do project work,   
{music, games, activities, craft or    
{computer. After school I sometimes go 
{to clubs, play with my friends or     
{amuse myself at home.}In the evening I
 enjoy working with my computer.My     
 favourite computer game is            
{"WANTED_MONTY MOLE".
