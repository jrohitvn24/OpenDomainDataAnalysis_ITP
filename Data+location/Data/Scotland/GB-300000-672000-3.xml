		<content> We went to interview Mrs Aitken of    
 Riccarton farm.                       
 The farm is the largest in the        
 area.Mrs Aitken could not tell us its 
 size.The stock total is two thousand  
 animals.The farm is mixed.            
 The Aitkens own Riccarton hills,North 
 and South Mains as well as Cairn      
 Papple and the Longmuir plantation.   
 The fields nearest to them are the    
 Camp field and the Hen field.The Camp 
 field was used during the war as a    
 camp for British soldiers.            
 The farmhouse is about one hundred    
 years old.It was built by Lady        
 Hamilton when the old one was knocked 
 down.From the kitchen window Mrs      
 Aitken sees a large hill where badgers
 and foxes roam.                       
 Some interesting features are two     
 volcanic plugs.                       
 The employees number ten.             </content>
