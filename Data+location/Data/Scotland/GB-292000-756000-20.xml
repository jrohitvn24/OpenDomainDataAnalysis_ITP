		<content>  The Sports Dome which is the only    
 real sporting facility for both locals
 and tourists, will need replacing     
 soon. The committee are trying to     
 arrange the construction of a         
 permanent building, probably on the   
 site of the old dome, costing in the  
 region of Â£400,000.                   
  There are plans for an industrial    
 estate at Aldour. The location has the
 advantages that it is flat, has good  
 road access, has tree screening and   
 the ground is disused. There has      
 already been resistance to the        
 scheme by locals.                     
  The school is hoping to get a new    
 sports area, taking part of the Hydro 
 Hotel golf course which is scheduled  
 for re-development, thus allowing ,   
 for the first time, a rugby pitch, as 
 well as football pitches, an athletics
 track etc.                            </content>
