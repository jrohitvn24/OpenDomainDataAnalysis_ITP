		<title>05SHEEP AND LAMBS IN SKERRIES</title>
		<content> Looking after sheep and lambs involves
 a lot of work.Around April and May the
 sheep start lambing.This is a very    
 busy time of year.Twice or more each  
 day you have to go round the hills    
 looking to see if the sheep have had  
 any lambs.All the sheep are{marked}and
 every household has a different one   
 for their own sheep. If you find any  
 lambs and they are not your own you   
 have to report it to the owners. This 
 goes on for about a month.            
                                       
 A little while later the sheep have to
 be{dipped}to stop them getting        
 diseases and the lambs have to be     
 taken away from their mothers. The    
 sheep have to be{sheared}sometime     
 during the summer.                    
                                       
 There is a{fence}dividing the land and
 the ram is kept on one side of it.    </content>
