		<content> Our D_Block can be divided into two   
 parts,namely the slopes of Weddersbie 
 Hill and the lower, flatter land at   
 the foot of the slope (the present    
 line of the A 91 road is more or less 
 the dividing line).On the hill slopes,
 the farmers tend to plough along the  
 contours,so the rain water run_off and
 soil erosion are reduced.Water        
 diviners have been empolyed to help   
 locate water on Rossie Farm, as during
 dry spells (eg.the summer of 1983)    
 there is no water for irrigating the  
 crops.Further east, however, at       
 Caldwells and Meadowells, another     
 natural feature can be found.Natural  
 springs have been used since early    
 times and water extracted by means of 
 a few wells.A windpump, now disused,  
 pumped up the water for people on the 
 hillsides and on the valley floor.
