		<content>{Trade} has played a significant part  
 in the History of Lanark as a town.{  
{Lanark }is basically a market town    
 much of its {Trade} been centred on   
 the {Farming} community,who come to { 
{Lanark}for the animal sales and the   
 Agricultural machinery sales.Many     
 small busineses are dependant on the  
 support they get from the {Farming }  
 community.However there are new {     
{Industries} in the area like a firm   
 that makes biscuits.The other mainstay
 of {Trade} used to be Textiles,but the
 past decade has seen several          
 busineses  close due to foreign       
 competition.The food trade in the town
 is dominated by William Low's and     
 Presto but there are a considerable   
 number of other people in this {Trade}
 .Generally {Trade }has been affected  
 by the steep increase in rates,which  
 hss forced many out of business.      </content>
