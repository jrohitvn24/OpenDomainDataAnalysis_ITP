		<content> The block contains most of Johnstone, 
 part of Kilbarchan and the outskirts  
 of Elderslie in the Renfrew District  
 of Strathclyde Region. It lies approx.
 4 miles from Paisley and 11 miles west
 of Glasgow. The town with a population
 of 23,000, was planned by George      
 Houston in 1781, grew in the 19th     
 century during the Industrial         
 Revolution developing cotton and      
 engineering industries. It is a       
 residential area, most of the industry
 being to the north. To the south and  
 east it is mainly agricultural, rough 
 grazing. There is a station on the    
 railway line from Glasgow to Stranraer
 and a section of the A737, main links 
 Glasgow to Clyde coast. Both high     
 schools and most of the primaries are 
 also inside the area. The block       
 contains several parks and other      
 recreational facilities.              </content>
