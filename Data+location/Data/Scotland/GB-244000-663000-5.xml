		<title>05Social problems in Ferguslie</title>
		<content>   Our area has a lot of problems,     
 especially{Ferguslie Park},an official
 Strathclyde Region area of{"multiple  
{deprivation "}.The kind of problems   
 people have are {drugs,crime,         
{unemployment, alcohol and family      
{problems}and affect young people      
 especially.                           
   Social workers are seeing fewer     
 people because of demolition and      
 renovation of houses.Although the     
 number of cases has decreased, their  
 severity has increased.               
   Unemployment has increased in the   
 last five years and this seems to lie 
 behind most of the problems.          
   The district council are improving  
 many of the houses by rewiring,       
 installing new heating  and bathrooms 
 and general redecoration.
