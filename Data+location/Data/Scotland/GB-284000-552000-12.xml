		<content>   There are no streets or terraces of 
 houses in the area, and hardly any    
 pavements. Each house sits on its own 
 ground with its own garden.           
   The farms all have farm cottages in 
 which their employees live. As there  
 are fewer farm workers nowadays, some 
 of these cottages have been sold or   
 are let to holiday-makers.            
   About one third of the houses are   
 owned by people who live far away from
 the area. These are either let in the 
 summer holidays or occupied by the    
 owners for only a short time each     
 year.                                 
   The oldest house in Rockcliffe is   
 Auchenvhin. When it was built 120     
 years ago it was the only house in the
 bay, which is now surrounded by houses
 of all shapes and sizes. To-day new,  
 and very expensive,houses continue to 
 be built in other parts of the area.  </content>
