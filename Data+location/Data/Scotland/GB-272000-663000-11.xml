		<content> A Sunday in Coatbridge                
  First of all I would get up and go to
 church at 11o'clock and that lasts    
 about one hour.I go to the United Free
 Church. After that I have my lunch    
 then go out to play with my friend. We
 would look after my pet rabbit which  
 is a female called Snowy. Sometimes I 
 go to B.&amp;Q. our local D.I.Y. store    
 which is open every Sunday. My dad    
 might buy something for the house and 
 we always have a look at the          
 plants.After I have my Sunday dinner  
 of roast meat, roast potatoes, and    
 peas I go to my grans for a couple of 
 hours . In the evening I watch t.v.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
