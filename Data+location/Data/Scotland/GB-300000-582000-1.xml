		<content>      Our block consists of virtually  
 nothing but farmland.The land is      
 undulating,fairly steep in places with
 some farmers qualifying for Hill      
 Subsidies.There is some mixed woodland
 and the area is rich in wildlife.     
      There are hardly any public      
 amminities.We have no villages or     
 towns and any housing is privately    
 owned.Within the area,we have seven   
 farms as we know them plus one        
 croft.There is only one main road _   
 A701 Dumfries/Edinburgh.Until the     
 1960's,there was a very scenic railway
 line through the area Dumfries /      
 Lockerbie.This was closed and all the 
 track has been lifted.Some of the line
 has now been reclaimed  for arable    
 land.
