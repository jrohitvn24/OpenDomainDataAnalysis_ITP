		<title>11A Factory in the Country</title>
		<content> Nicholson's Plastic Factory is half a 
 mile west of the village, and is a    
 medium-sized brick building.          
 Mr.A.A.Nicholson owns the factory     
 which has been his for about fourteen 
 years. It is a family business. He has
 other businesses in Liverpool and     
 Surrey. The chemicals he uses are     
 polyester resin, catalysts and fibre  
 glass. From these chemicals, he makes 
 water tanks for domestic and hotel    
 use, and Baptismal tanks. He exports  
 some of his goods to the Middle East, 
 and he also sells his goods all over  
 Britain. Mr. Nicholson has a workforce
 of thirty-five. The small tanks are   
 painted by hand but the big tanks are 
 sprayed. It is an old Victorian       
 factory which used to make chenille   
 cloth.
