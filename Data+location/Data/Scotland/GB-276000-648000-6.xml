 FROM A SURVEY IT WAS FOUND THAT MOST  
 PEOPLE HAVE A FITTED KITCHEN MADE OF  
 FORMICA AND WOOD.MOST PEOPLE HAVE A   
 FITTED BATHROOM SUITE AND THE MOST    
 POPULAR COLOUR IS GREEN.IF LINEOLEUM  
 IS USED IT IS USUALLY IN THE KITCHEN  
 HOWEVER IN GENERAL CARPET TILES SEEM  
 TO BE MORE POPULAR IN THE KITCHEN THAN
 IN THE BATHROOM.MOST PEOPLE HAVE      
 CARPETING THROUGHOUT THEIR HOME.      
 TRADITIONAL WOODEN DOORS ARE VERY     
 COMMON.IN WINDOWS A LOT OF PEOPLE     
 STILL HAVE SINGLE GLAZING BUT DOUBLE  
 GLAZING IS BECOMING MORE POPULAR.MOST 
 PEOPLE PREFER SELF_COLOURED WALL PAPER
 TO BRIGHT PATTERNED PAPER AND PEOPLE  
 PREFER PASTEL SHADES TO DRIGHT        
 ONES.MOST PEOPLE LIKE PICTURES ON     
 THEIR WALLS.AND MOST PEOPLE GET THEIR 
 HOUSES  REDECORATED EVERY YEAR.
