		<title>14Banking in Milnathort</title>
		<content>   The block contains the two banks in 
 Milnathort, branches of the{Clydesdale
{Bank}and the{Royal Bank of Scotland.  
   Between them they employ about a    
 dozen people, including cleaners.     
   The banks' business includes much   
 farm-related work involving loans and 
 insurance for machinery and livestock,
 and property purchase.  The managers  
 often visit farmers to conduct their  
 business "in the field".              
   Two pupils of Milnathort Primary    
 School were among "extras" recruited  
 by a film company who were making a   
 television commercial for The Royal   
 Bank of Scotland. They were filmed    
 entering the Milnathort branch.       
   The village's only newsagent is a   
 busy place as it is also the village  
{Post Office.}Some people prefer it to 
 the banks for savings transactions as 
 the hours are more convenient.        </content>
