		<title>14Coastal walk.</title>
		<content> The start of the interesting coastal  
 walk in this area of study is found   
 at Lower Largo where there is a car   
 park known as the Temple. Near here   
 several of the buildings are of       
 importance such as Cardy House,       
 designed by two Italians below which  
 is the Net factory.                   
 Along the sandy shore there are       
 seaweed covered rocks exposed at low  
 tide.The sea wall base is of whinstone
 while the upper part is of red        
 sandstone.The older houses show some  
 fine examples of of local vernacular  
 architecture.Near to this part of the 
 coast is the statue of "Robinson      
 Crusoe".These stories were based on a 
 native of Largo called Alexander      
 Selkirk.                              
 Along the coastline above the high    
 tide zone there is marram grass grown 
 to control moving dunes.              </content>
