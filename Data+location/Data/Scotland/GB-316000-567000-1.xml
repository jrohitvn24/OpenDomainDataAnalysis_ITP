		<title>01Our Area</title>
		<content>    Our area is part of the town of    
{Annan}and the land to the north and   
 west which is mostly farmland.        
    Annan lies on the river of the same
 name, which runs into the northern    
 shores of the{Solway Firth.}The town  
 lies on the main{A75 'Euro-route'}to  
 Northern Ireland and is only some 15km
 from the border with England.         
    Annan has expanded greatly as a    
 town, the population having almost    
 doubled since the end of the Second   
 World War.                            
    Our block contains the north-      
 western area of the town, which       
 consists almost completely of housing 
 estates, mostly council, both pre-war 
 and post-war, as well as some modern  
 private housing.                      
    Plans are currently being approved 
 for a{by-pass}which will run through  
 the area under review.                </content>
