		<content> The side of Park Lane nearer the river
 contains 7 detached bungalows.Of these
 5 are privately owned factory built   
 kit type houses,and 2 are owned by the
 Forestry Commission to house forestry 
 workers.                              
 In a cul-de-sac by the station is     
 another private house.                
 The old station buildings still stand 
 and are used by the Forestry          
 Commission as a store (These were     
 until just recently the head office   
 for the Huntly district). The station 
 yard is still used as a Forestry      
 Commission store although it was      
 sold by them earlier this year.
