		<title>06A MINISTER'S DAY</title>
		<content>  Mr.Maclean told us on Tuesday about  
 how he spends his day.He takes a day  
 off anytime he likes.He has a very    
 long working day. In the mornings he  
 usually visits old people and goes to 
 schools. At about 7am he goes into his
 study and reads his Bible. Often he   
 has to go to Edinburgh for            
 conferences. He told us about his most
 embarrasing moment.It was when he did 
 a marriage, the bride fainted and he  
 blushed. He had to try and lift her   
 up. He has to do funerals,            
 christenings, and sometimes he is     
 faced with a problem. He will only do 
 a marriage if they have a licence.He  
 is going to appear on "Reflections" in
 August.{
