		<title>10LOCAL HISTORY OF FORFAR</title>
		<content>{Monuments}There is a small tower on{  
{Castle Hill}which in the olden days   
 stood in the middle of the town.It was
 called the Mercat Cross.All things    
 that the king wished the people to    
 know were read out from the top of    
 this tower.Sometimes people were      
 hanged there.As time went by,carts    
 began to bump into it and it was      
 getting ruined and so the Town Council
 took it apart stone by stone and it   
 was rebuilt on the mound where the old
 Forfar Castle once stood.Someone has  
 said it would be good if a circle of  
 stones could mark the old site of the 
 tower in the centre of town.          
 You can get the key of the tower from 
 Adamson the stationer along Castle St.
 Go along Canmore St.unlock the metal  
 gate, follow the path and you'll get  
 to Castle Hill tower.
