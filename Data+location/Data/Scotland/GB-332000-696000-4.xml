		<content> The exploitation of local coal        
 reserves transformed the 19th century 
 fishing villages of East Wemyss,      
 Buckhaven and Methil into industrial  
 towns experiencing rapid urban growth.
 The Michael Pit, at one time the      
 largest colliery in Scotlnd, and the  
 docks at Methil were soon the focal   
 points of the communities. Both       
 villages have suffered similar        
 problems of unemployment and decline  
 in the last 20 years as the coal      
 industry contracted. However Buckhaven
 seems to be approaching the problems  
 more positively, an example of this   
 being the projects they have done and 
 are continueing to do through the     
 Community Program Scheme. The largest 
 project completed to date is St.      
 Michaels House which accommodates a   
 number of small craft workshops with  
 central administration facilities.    </content>
