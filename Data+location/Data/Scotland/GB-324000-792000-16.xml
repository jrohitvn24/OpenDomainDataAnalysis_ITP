		<title>16Wild Life around Crathie</title>
		<content> In Crathie we are surrounded by a lot 
 of wild life. There are numerous tiny 
 animals around the trees. It is easy  
 to spot one of the many local red     
 squirrels. Plenty of rabbits make     
 their holes beside bushes and eat     
 everything in the garden. There are a 
 lot of moles too. In the woods and    
 forests there are roe deer and up in  
 the hills there are herds of red deer 
 which will move onto lower ground     
 during severe weather. Sometimes you  
 see a fox in the woods. Also up in the
 hills adders hide in the heather. They
 are very poisonous. Hedgehogs live    
 under cut down trees and if you touch 
 one it will roll into a prickly ball. 
 Sometimes if you are lucky you might  
 see an otter at a river bank. In the  
 winter the stoat and hare have white  
 coats. Possibly wild cats and pine    
 martens live in the more remote parts.</content>
