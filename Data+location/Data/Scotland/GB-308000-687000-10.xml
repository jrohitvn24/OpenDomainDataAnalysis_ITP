		<content> I wake up at about 6.45am and have a  
 hot bath.  I then have something to   
 eat, perhaps a bacon roll and a glass 
 of milk.  I leave for school at about 
 8.30am.  I take a slow walk up to     
 school after calling for a friend.  We
 line up outside the door at 9.00am    
 when the bell goes.  Our interval is  
 from 10.40am until 10.55am and we play
 games at this time.  We have an hour  
 for lunch between 12.45pm and 1.45pm. 
 During this time I go home for lunch  
 and return at about 1.15pm to play    
 hide and seek or maybe netball with my
 friends.    The afternoon school      
 begins at 1.45pm and lasts until      
 3.15pm, when we leave for home.       
 Usually I play outside for a while    
 until tea time at about 5.00pm and    
 then go to play outside again until   
 9.00pm.  At roughly 9.30pm I wash and 
 go to bed.                            </content>
