		<title>15TOURISM I</title>
		<content> It is great for tourists to come to   
 Powfoot in the summer,because it is   
 very hot.                             
  In Powfoot the sea is very warm in   
 summer.Lots of people swim in the sea,
 and lie in the sun.The sea is very    
 quick at coming in and there is a deep
 channel.                              
   The tourists (who I call touroids   
 because they bug me) come in the      
 summer.                               
 Many people stay in the Golf Hotel or 
 caravans. There is an old swimming    
 pool out on the sand.It is split in   
 half one side for women and one for   
 men. You can not swim in it any more  
 because there are lots of shells in   
 the bottom,that jag your feet.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
