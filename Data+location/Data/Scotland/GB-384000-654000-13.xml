		<title>13RELIGION IN CHIRNSIDE</title>
		<content> The original church in Chirnside was  
 built about 800 years ago. There is   
 still a Norman doorway, now protected 
 by a porch, and inside the building is
 an inscription dated 1573 _ "Helpe Ye 
 Pur". Also inside the building is a   
 marble relief of Lady Tweedmouth of   
 Hutton Castle. This was gifted by her 
 husband in her memory. To commemorate 
 his death an arched gateway with      
 wrought iron pelicans was built at the
 entrance to the church. Other famous  
 people buried in the surrounding      
 graveyard include Jim Clark, racing   
 driver, and Henry Erskine, minister at
 Chirnside in the late 17th century.   
 Many of the gravestones bear emblems  
 of the trades practised by the        
 villagers. Unfortunately the red      
 sandstone of the gravestones has not  
 weathered well and many are now       
 broken.                               </content>
