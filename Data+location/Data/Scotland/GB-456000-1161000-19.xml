		<title>19TOURISM ON WHALSAY</title>
		<content>  Whalsay,because of its remoteness,has
 in the past not been very accessible  
 for tourists.The difficulty of getting
 here has been added to in that there  
 has been no hotels or guest houses on 
 the island.                           
  Today tourists would have no problem 
 in getting here.There is now a guest  
 house,a self catering chalet,1 or 2   
 self catering caravans and at least   
 one place for bed &amp; breakfast.        
  Apart from seeing the island itself  
 anyone visiting could come for the    
 birdwatching,we get many rare migrants
 here;fishing,both sea angling and     
 trout;sailing;golf;walking.These are a
 few of the activities that would      
 interest a tourist.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
