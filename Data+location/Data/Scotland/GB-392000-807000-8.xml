		<title>08ABERDEEN: A CHILD'S TOY.</title>
		<content> Lego is a construction toy. It is     
 probably the most successful toy in   
 the world today.                      
                                       
 Lego is made of small plastic pieces  
 that can be pressed together to make  
 anything you wish. It is sold in kits 
 which contain lots of different       
 pieces. Most of the pieces are square 
 or rectangular although there are also
 wheels, triangular roof pieces and    
 clear bits that can be used for       
 windows. Lego is made in Denmark.     
                                       
 Both boys and girls play with Lego.   
 There is a more advanced type of Lego 
 called Technical Lego. This can be    
 used to make engines and gears. Lego  
 can be used by children from about the
 age of three. Technical Lego is for   
 older children - from about 10 years  
 old.                                  </content>
