		<title>07Houses in Durris</title>
		<content> In our block the style of housing     
 varies a lot. The old buildings are   
 different from the modern houses in   
 style and materials. There are quite a
 few farms in the block and some of    
 them have been partly knocked down and
 rebuilt into a more modern style.     
 Older buildings are made from grey or 
 red granite with slate roofs.The newer
 houses are bungalows and the older    
 buildings have mostly two stories.    
 Most of the roofs of the new houses   
 have red or grey tiles instead of     
 slates .In the block there are quite a
 few ruined buildings,including        
 farmhouses and mills.New houses here  
 are very expensive.In Woodlands Park  
 the houses can cost more than         
 Â£100,000.They were built in 1976.There
 are twelve houses beside our school   
 which were built around the same      
 time.One of them cost Â£70,000.        </content>
