		<content>{The}refusal of the authorities to     
 consider the people's wishes caused a 
 large secession from the Parish       
 Church. The seceders went to Midlem   
 where they established probably the   
 earliest Secession meeting-house in   
 Scotland.                             
{The congregation}of the dissenting    
 chapel in Midlem survived until 1912, 
 when the number of communicants had so
 declined they were unable to support a
 full-time minister. Services were then
 conducted by visiting ministers of the
 Secession Church and the Bowden       
 ministers took two services monthly in
 Midlem School. After 1929 the services
 dwindled to one a month, led by the   
 Bowden Kirk minister, which practice  
 continued until 1967. There is no     
 place of worship in the village now   
 and Midlem folk share in the life and 
 worship of the parish church of Bowden</content>
