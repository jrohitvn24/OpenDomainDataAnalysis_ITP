 community apart from Deanston village,
 is well served by a variety of clubs  
 for all ages &amp; interests providing    
 people are willing to travel using    
 their own transport as buses are      
 infrequent.Only two clubs actually    
 meet within the area _ Tuesday Club   
 run by Kilmadock Church for youngsters
 in the village &amp; Deanston Ladies Club.
 Other clubs available to the community
 are _ C.of S.Woman's Guilds, W.R.I.,  
 Brownies, Guides, Cubs, Scouts, Boys' 
 Brigade, Curling, Golf, Rifle, Bowling
 Young Farmers, Football, Rotary and   
 Scottish Dancing. These &amp; other clubs 
 meet in the surrounding towns and     
 villages. Membership of Masonic Lodges
 outwith the area is also available.

 the community are Bingo Clubs. Addicts
