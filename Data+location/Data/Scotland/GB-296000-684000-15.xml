		<title>15A COUNCIL HOUSE (2Oth CENT.)</title>
		<content>   When we first moved into our house  
 it was horrible.There was an old      
 fashioned bath on stands. The kitchen 
 had 3 cupboards up to the roof. There 
 was a coal fire in the living room and
 bedroom.Then the council modernised   
 it. We were given a nice bathroom     
 suite, lots of cupboards, a gas fire  
 and central heating. When we bought   
 our house from the council we changed 
 the shape of the kitchen and bathroom.
 We put in a burgundy bathsuite and a  
 shower. In the living room we put a   
 stone fireplace,wood panelling and a  
 smoked mirror alcove with a hanging   
 light.We put heaters in the bedrooms.
