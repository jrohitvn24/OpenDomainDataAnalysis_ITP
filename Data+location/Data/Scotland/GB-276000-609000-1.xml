		<title>01Sanquhar and its environs</title>
		<content> Our reference area is based on the    
 Royal Burgh of Sanquhar, which is in  
 the Nithsdale District of Dumfries and
 Galloway Region in southwest Scotland.
 A small town with a population of 2200
 Sanquhar stands on the main A76 trunk 
 road and close to the River Nith. Once
 a mining area, Sanquhar has had to    
 change its main industries since the  
 closure of the two local mines in     
 1964. Our modern factories produce    
 carpet yarns and tiles, school and    
 office furniture, knitwear, plastic   
 mouldings and fireworks. The town's   
 chief employer is an aluminium        
 processing factory. Originally called 
 Saen Caer, meaning "Old Fort",        
 Sanquhar and its environs are rich in 
 history of both local and national    
 importance-the "Sanquhar Declaration" 
 and Britain's oldest post office being
 but two examples.                     </content>
