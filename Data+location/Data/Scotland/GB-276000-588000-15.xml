		<title>15Crawfordton House School</title>
		<content> Crawfordton House is a preparatory    
 school in our area and we interviewed 
 its head,Mr.Morrison.                 
 Mr.Morrison always wanted to teach    
 from about the age of 10 and went to  
 college with that ambition in mind.His
 first job was at a preparatory school 
 in Belfast.He has held his present    
 post for 4 years. If he was not       
 teaching he would love to be a farmer 
 or a theatre director.There are 70    
 pupils at his school and they do 7    
 periods/day plus Saturday morning     
 study and have a wide variety of      
 clubs.One third of pupils come from   
 within 50miles,another third come from
 anywhere in Britain and the last third
 come from abroad.To be a boarding     
 pupil at Crawfordton costs Â£1100/term 
 and Â£700/term if you are a day pupil. 
 There are 3 term/year.Most parents are
 farmers,doctors or lawers.            </content>
