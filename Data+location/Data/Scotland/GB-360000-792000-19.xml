		<content>{Finzean Shop}in 1958 was a General    
 Merchant's business, selling almost   
 everything. There was also a van going
 round the valley , selling groceries  
 and general merchandise. There was one
 petrol pump, worked by hand, the      
 selling price of petrol being four    
 shillings and sixpence (24p)per gallon
{The price}of goods remained relatively
 stable,changing about once every six  
 months until decimalisation came when 
 prices increased monthly.             
{The van}had to be withdrawn because of
 increasing overhead expenses. The big 
 problem now for country shops is the  
 popularity of the supermarket and the 
 greater mobility of the shopper. They 
 must keep open after normal hours and 
 cater for passing tourist trade with  
 soft drinks, ice-cream, confectionary 
 and local produce to survive.
