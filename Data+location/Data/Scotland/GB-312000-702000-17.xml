		<title>17A Church in Milnathort</title>
		<content>   {The United Free Church of Scotland 
 (U.F.Church) has one building in this 
 area. It is right in the middle of the
 village and has a tall spire, stone   
 built, that can be seen for miles     
 around. This church looks very grand, 
 but it is in need of a little repair  
 and renovation.  There is only a very 
 small congregation, and they cannot   
 afford to keep the building as nice as
 it should be.                         
    Only about a dozen people attend   
 each Sunday morning service. To help  
 make money to pay for heating a scrap 
 paper collection is kept going all    
 year. They also hold coffee mornings  
 and sales of work.                    
    The flower-beds and lawns round    
 this church are kept neat and tidy.   
    Most Milnathort people are members 
 of Orwell Church of Scotland, which is
 on the hill at the top of North Street</content>
