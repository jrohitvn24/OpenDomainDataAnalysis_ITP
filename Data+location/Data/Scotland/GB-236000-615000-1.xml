 main road bisects area with a large   
 number of smaller little used minor   
 roads and lanes.  The land rises      
 towards the east and is reasonably    
 well drained to the river Doon. In the
 north east is a loch with course fish,
 some trout and a fine seclection f    
 water fowl.  This area also has a good
 number of wild mammals from voles to  
 red squirrel and deer.

 industrial estate where two companies,
 one scottish and one american
