		<content> The town of Renfrew is in the District
 of Renfrew in the Region of           
 Strathclyde. It is represented at     
 District level by Mrs Elizabeth       
 McIntosh of the Labour Party. The most
 pressing issue for her at present is  
 the resistance of people in the       
 Deanpark Housing Estate to proposals  
 to build a sports complex at the      
 Deanpark Hotel. At Regional level the 
 representative is Mr Thomas Graham,   
 also of the Labour Party. The issue of
 most concern to him at present is the 
 effect of the Conservative            
 Government's public spending cuts on  
 services in Strathclyde coupled with  
 the tripling of rateable values       
 resulting in an avarage rates rise of 
 30%. Many of the older residents of   
 Renfrew resent the passing of the old 
 Renfrew Burgh autonomy in the reorgan-
 isation of local government in 1975.  </content>
