 The police station is in Manse Road,  
 just down from the school. It is about
 80 years old. In the station is an    
 office and two cells.The cells are    
 only used by criminals overnight. For 
 longer stays they are transferred to  
 Dumfries Police Station. Six men work 
 at the station with the sergeant in   
 charge. There are two police vehicles.
 When dogs are needed they are brought 
 from Dumfries.
