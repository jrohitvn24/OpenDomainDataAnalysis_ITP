		<content> Mrs. Davies gets up at 0740 each      
 morning and comes to wake up her      
 children. For breakfast she has half a
 grapefruit, a piece of toast and a cup
 of coffee. After her children have    
 gone to school, she normally does some
 housework, or does something social   
 such as bridge, tennis, squash, etc.  
 For lunch, she has a snack such as a  
 sandwich or soup and a biscuit. In the
 afternoon she will do the opposite of 
 the morning. If she has done a social 
 thing in the morning then she will do 
 some housework in the afternoon. She  
 has her tea of mince or curry or chops
 with vegetables, at about 1800. After 
 tea she plays sport, tutors or watches
 television, or sometimes she takes the
 dog for a walk. At about 2330, she    
 goes to her bed.
