		<content> The{Hayfield Industrial Estate}was    
 opened in the 1960s to help with the  
 rising unemployment after the closing 
 of the huge linoleum factories. There 
 are sixteen units which provide a wide
 variety of services. There are depots 
 for National companies such as British
 Telecom and for local firms like      
 Douglas Grant the fish-merchant or the
 Co-op. Several are manufacturing goods
 like children's clothing, double      
 glazing, concrete products or wooden  
 tables and doors. Fife Regional       
 Council occupy one site with their    
 works department.One is engaged in    
 repairing and re-covering furniture   
 and there are two scrap metal yards.  
 One edge of the estate there is a     
 garage selling cars and a tyre and    
 battery supplier.
