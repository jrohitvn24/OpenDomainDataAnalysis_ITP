		<title>01DALRY(KIRK):A SCOTS VILLAGE</title>
		<content>    St.John's Town of Dalry, in the    
 Stewartry of Kirkudbright, is a small 
 attractive village in the Glenkens,the
 valley of the River Ken, in rural     
 Galloway.It is farming country.       
 Westward rise the Rhinns of Kells; to 
 the south there is the Solway coast.  
 The area is unspoilt by 'development'.
    Dalry's two principal streets run  
 uphill to join at the top of Main St.,
 which is part of the A702 terminating 
 in Edinburgh.Throughgate joins them   
 lower down to form the crossbar of an 
 'A' whose base stands on the A713 Ayr 
 to Castle Douglas road.There is a     
 standing stone of great antiquity in a
 nearby field, a 12th. century motte   
 and other historical monuments.       
    The Post Office and grocers shops  
 serve a wide geographical area.Those  
 fortunate enough to live in Dalry work
 hard to maintain its beauty.          </content>
