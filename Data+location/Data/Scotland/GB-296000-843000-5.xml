		<title>05HOUSING IN FERNESS</title>
		<content>    The village of Ferness was built as
 part of the Glenferness Estate and the
 houses date back to the mid 1800's.   
 The row of cottages included a school/
 schoolhouse, shop, shoemakers, smiddy 
 &amp; barber. They are all family houses  
 now. The houses are stone built -2 up 
 and 2 down.                           
    Just out of the main part of the   
 village are 7 forestry houses.        
 Originally built &amp; owned by the       
 forestry commission, they are with one
 exception now privately owned.        
    The other houses in the grid are   
 mostly rented or privately-owned      
 farmhouses.There is no council        
 housing and  no new private houses    
 have been built in the last 50-70     
 years. Many houses once occupied are  
 now derelict or maintained as holiday 
 homes, contributing to the gradual    
 depopulation of the area.             </content>
