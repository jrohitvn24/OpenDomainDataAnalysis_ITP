		<title>15Flod Prevention Scheme</title>
		<content> In February 1984 there was a council  
 meeting in Dumfries.  The meeting was 
 about the flooding in the burn at     
 Springholm, as several houses were    
 being flooded each year.  Four months 
 later the Flood prevention scheme got 
 under way.  The cost was to be        
 Â£150,000 excluding the hire of diggers
 which was Â£900.  They were going to   
 start work on the burn as it came to  
 the first flooded houses, (across from
 the Primary School).                  
 The workmen started work by damming   
 the burn about 500 yards from a Miss  
 Malia's.  Then the banks were         
 straightened and wire cages were      
 placed in, full of rocks.  Then they  
 put a net over the bottom of the burn.
 The cages went on for about 500 yards 
 on one side and 600 yards on the other
 side.                                 
                                       </content>
