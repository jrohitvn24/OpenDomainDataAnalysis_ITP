		<content> IN OUR SQUARE WE HAVE ONLY ONE SHOP.IT
 IS A POST OFFICE AND GENERAL STORE.AS 
 WELL AS GROCERIES YOU CAN BUY BIRTHDAY
 CARDS,NEWSPAPERS,EARRINGS AND         
 STATIONERY.MOST PEOPLE USE THE POST   
 OFFICE FOR THINGS THAT THEY HAVE RUN  
 OUT OF.OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR SURVEY    
 ONLY EIGHT BUY LOTS OF SHOPPING       
 THERE.BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER      
 SHOPS VANS COME ROUND. WE ASKED PEOPLE
 WERE THEY DO THEIR  MAIN SHOPPING.    
 WE FOUND THAT DALKEITH WAS THE MOST   
 POPULAR IT IS EIGHT MILES AWAY. NEXT  
 CAME EDINBURGH TWENTY MILES AWAY AND  
 AFTER THAT HADDINGTON TEN MILES AWAY. 
 THOSE WHO USE THE LOCAL SHOPPING      
 FACILITIES TEND TO BE THE ELDERLY AND 
 THOSE WITH NO TRANSPORT.ONE HOUSEHOLD 
 GETS A DELIVERY OF SHOPPING.
