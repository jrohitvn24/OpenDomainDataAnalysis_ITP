 The area is coastal with a rocky sandy
 shoreline.  To the west lies the North
 Channel, the hills of Ireland visible 
 on the horizon.  Inland are grassy    
 rolling hills.  Fresian cattle        
 dominate the scene with sheep         
 overwintering from places with a less 
 amenable climate.  Trees are scarce,  
 those that grow, lean away from the   
 periodic westerly gales.  Occasional  
 mists roll in from the sea enveloping 
 all in a damp softening cover         
 persisting at times for several days. 
 The coastal area is of archaeological 
 interest.  A fort once stood here with
 burial places, both now represented by
 grassy mounds.  Habitations amounting 
 to no more than 2 dozen, are evenly   
 spaced.  No village as such is here.  
 The few inhabitants are mainly        
 concerned with dairy farming.         </content>
