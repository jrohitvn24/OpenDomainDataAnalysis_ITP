 When I am outside I like playing Stick
 in the Mud. To play this game you     
 need several other children and       
 someone is elected as the "man"; this 
 person must try and catch the others .
 When caught you must stand with your  
 legs and arms open and straight. After
 being caught three times you are out  
 of the game.                          
                                       
 To get released from the standing     
 position someone, not the man, must   
 crawl between your legs. When someone 
 is between your legs they are safe    
 from the "man".This continues until   
 everyone has been caught three times  
 or when everyone is in the standing   
 position.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
