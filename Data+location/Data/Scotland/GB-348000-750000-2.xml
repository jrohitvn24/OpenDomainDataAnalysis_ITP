		<title>02CROPS AT MID-DOD FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
 The{farming}land and of Mid-Dod farm  
 is approximately 482 acres.  The three
 main{crops}are spring barley and      
 winter wheat and barley.  Mid-Dod is  
 mainly an arable farm.  Oil seed rape 
 and peas are relatively new crops and 
 seem to be developing fairly well.    
 The busiest time of year on the farm  
 is between July and September.        
                                       
{CROP MARKETING}- There is 70 acres of 
 barley on the farm, and all of this is
 sold to the Moray Firth Malting       
 Company in Arbroath.  The farmer keeps
 the stalks to use as animal bedding in
 winter.  The 30 acres of oil seed rape
 is sent down south to be crushed into 
{food}as edible fats and margarine.    
 The stalks are not good for bedding   
 so the farmer uses them as fuel.
