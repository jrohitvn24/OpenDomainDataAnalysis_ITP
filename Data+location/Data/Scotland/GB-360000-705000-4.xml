		<content> Catching Shellfish at Crail.          
 Fishing is still being done from Crail
 harbour although it is better known   
 now as a subject for artists, often   
 seen on pictorial calendars.  Recently
 part of the harbour wall was rebuilt  
 using original stones.  The harbour   
 was also dredged to clear out rotted  
 seaweed which was replaced by sand.   
 There are at present 12 boaats fishing
 from Crail for crabs and lobsters.    
 The lobsters are sent to Eyemouth and 
 from there to the Continent, and the  
 crabs are sent to canneries near      
 Berwick.   Some are kept for the      
 summer tourists.  The shellfish are   
 caught in creels like cages, made by  
 the fishermen from coarse netting on  
 wooden frames.
