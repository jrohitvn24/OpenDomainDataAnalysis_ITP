 There is an Inn in the village of     
 Guildtown. It is called The Anglers'  
 Rest and it, with two private houses  
 doing Bed and Breakfast, is the only  
 provision for tourists.               
                                       
 The Inn, as the local people call it, 
 has accomodation for ten tourists in  
 five bedrooms. All meals can be       
 provided.                             
                                       
 The Inn is on the Main Road and is    
 therefore well situated for those     
 travelling between Perth and the north
 towards Braemar and Aberdeen.         
                                       
 Anyone holidaying in Guildtown would  
 probably go fishing in the nearby     
 River Tay_ (which is not, however in  
 our designated map reference.)
