 animal of some kind. Most{household   
{pets}are dogs and cats but others are 
 rabbits, guinea pigs, budgie, goats   
 and one donkey.                       
  A typical{dairy farm}in this area has
 75{Fresian}cows and keeps lambs in the
 summer. One{beef farm}has 100 animals:
 -{Aberdeen Angus, Charolais, Hereford 
{and Simmentals.}They also have{3      
{ponies - a Shetland, a Highland and a 
{Welsh pony.}There is a{riding school  
 in  this area with horses and ponies.

 for{sheep grazing}but also has a large
 flock of his own mainly{Blackface}but 
 with some{Jacob sheep}too. The
