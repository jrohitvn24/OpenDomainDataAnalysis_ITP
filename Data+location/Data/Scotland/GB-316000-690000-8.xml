		<title>08Farming - Westerton</title>
		<content> Westerton, an arable farm close to    
 Lochgelly has a varied collection of  
 animals and crops.  The sheep and cows
 are evenly distributed throughout the 
 farm and around 225 of each are kept. 
    Regarding crops, there are         
 seventeen fields, each of seventeen   
 acres containing hay and barley.      
 Most of the hay is used for fodder;   
 any extra is sold.  Half of the barley
 crop is sold however, and only half is
 kept for fodder.                      
    The farmer has many kinds of       
 machinery, the most important being   
 harvesters, bailers and rollers.  The 
 farmer and his brother are the only   
 workers on the farm and often work up 
 to 17 hours a day to finish the job.  
   The public cause many problems for  
 the farmer unfortunately as they walk 
 over fields and allow dogs to run/
