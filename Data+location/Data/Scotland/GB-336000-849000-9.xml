 Until about twenty years ago, you     
 would only see black cattle on the    
 farms in this area.  These were       
 Aberdeen Angus, or a cross between    
 aberdeen Angus and other breeds.      
 But now there are many new breeds of  
 cattle kept by the farmers and you see
 very few black cattle.                
 There is a Market in Keith every      
 Tuesday for cattle being sold to the  
 butcher. Once a month, on a Monday,   
 there is a Market for one_year_old    
 animals.  Farmers in this area sell   
 most of their beasts as               
 one_year_olds.They are bought by      
 farmers from places where the grass   
 and climate are better for fattening  
 cattle.                               
 Farmers from the Mulben area also sell
 beasts at Markets in Huntly, Elgin and
 Aberdeen.                             </content>
