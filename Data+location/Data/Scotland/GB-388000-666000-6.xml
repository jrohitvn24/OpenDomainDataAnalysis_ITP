		<title>06VOLUNTARY  MARINE RESERVE</title>
		<content> ON 18TH.,AUGUST, 1985, DR. DAVID      
 BELLAMY  OFFICIALLY OPENED THE ST ABBS
 AND EYEMOUTH VOLUNTARY MARINE NATURE  
 RESERVE. THE AIMS OF THE RESERVE ARE  
 TO CONSERVE THE RICH VARIETY OF PLANT 
 AND ANIMAL LIFE OF THE INSHORE WATERS,
 AND TO ENCOURAGE  THE RESPONSIBLE USE 
 , BOTH RECREATIONALLY AND             
 COMMERCIALLY. THIS SHOULD PROVE       
 MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TO BOTH THE LOCAL 
 FISHERMEN AND TO THE MANY VISITING    
 DIVERS. THE COAST IS BOTH UNSPOILT AND
 VARIED WITH A GREAT WEALTH OF ANIMAL  
 AND PLANT LIFE , WHILST THE SEA       
 OFFSHORE IS CLEAN  WITH VERY GOOD     
 CLARITY OF WATER CONTRIBUTING TO SOME 
 OF THE BEST SCUBA DIVING IN SCOTLAND  
 IF NOT THE BRITISH ISLES. FOR MANY    
 YEARS  THERE HAS BEEN DIFFICULTIES    
 BETWEEN THE FISHERMEN AND THE DIVERS .
 HOPEFULLY THESE HAVE BEEN RESOLVED AND
 NOW THE SEA CAN BE FOR EVERYONE.      </content>
