		<content>  To the west of this area the number  
 of{unmetalled roads}increases, being  
 used both as access roads to fields   
 or remote farmhouses. There are only  
{two major roads}in the area; the{A920 
 (Ellon - Pitmedden) and the{B9005     
 (Ellon - Methlick). There is a{sparse 
 network of{metalled, single-track     
 roads which provide access to the many
 small farm communities in the area.   
  The{disused}railway line (Aberdeen to
 Peterhead, closed in 1978), which runs
 southwest to northeast through the    
 area is now used by locals for walking
 and there are plans for the future    
 development of the railway line as a  
{cycling track.}There is a limited bus 
 service in this area (three daily)    
 which runs along the B9005 to Methlick
 ,this is the{only}bus service in the  
 area.                                 
                                       </content>
