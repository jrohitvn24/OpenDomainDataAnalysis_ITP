		<title>06THE THURSO SALMON</title>
		<content>   Fishing for salmon has taken place  
 on{Thurso River}for hundreds of years.
 The biggest known single haul of fish 
 was in the 1750s when about 2,000 fish
 were taken. Today the catch for the   
 season is 3,000 salmon. The record    
 catch was taken in Cruives Pool, now  
 known as the Salmon Pool, which is    
 still a popular fishing spot today.   
   The salmon fishermen today use a    
 coble - the special kind of salmon    
 boat - with an electric engine but in 
 the past the boat would have been     
 rowed.                                
   This system of operation using a    
 coble involves four men. Two in the   
 boat and two on the shore. Up to 15   
 years ago six men worked as a team.   
 Four in the coble and two working the 
 nets from dry land.                   
   There is a ready market for the     
 catch in{Thurso}and further afield.   </content>
