		<content> Our school janitor is also our Dinner 
 Lady although she does not cook. Due  
 to the distance involved, no child    
 goes home for dinner. One third bring 
 a packed lunch while the other two    
 thirds have school meals. These are   
 made in Locharbriggs Primary and      
 brought to us by taxi. The children   
 have the opportunity to take part in  
 various school clubs-Computer, Country
 Dance, Keep Fit, Tennis and Recorder. 
 The school has an active, well        
 supported P.T.A. and several parents  
 help out with extra-curricular        
 activities such as Woodwork, Sewing   
 and Football.
