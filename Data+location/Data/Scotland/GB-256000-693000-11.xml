		<content> BUCHLYVIE W.R.I. was formed in{       
{JULY,1919}the first in STIRLINGSHIRE  
 and among the first in Scotland. At   
 the first meeting it was decided that 
 meetings be held on the second{TUESDAY
 of the month so that members could    
 have the light of the moon to guide   
 them as they travelled on foot or by  
 pony and trap. Today that date is     
 still 'Rural night' from September to 
 May. The emblem selected was that of  
 the{BARON OF BUCHLYVIE,}the famous    
 Clydesdale stallion. A varied syllabus
 is presented to the members throughout
 the session, and may cover such topics
 as cookery, gardening, travel, art and
 craft and flower arranging. Members   
 enter competitions, provide a         
 Christmas party for the children and  
 are involved in many activities which 
 benefit the community. Membership is  
 usually around{90 or 100}each year.   </content>
