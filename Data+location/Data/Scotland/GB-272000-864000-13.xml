		<content> Our group all live on farms around    
 our school, which is situated on the  
 north side of the Black-Isle. As we   
 are not on direct routes to the       
 school we have to get up early either 
 to walk, cycle or go in a car to reach
 the school bus. School starts at      
 9.15a.m. and we do lessons then till  
 10.45. We have a tuck shop then which 
 sells crisps, biscuits and chocolate  
 and a teacher runs it. Our school has 
 two teachers and 35 pupils. We have a 
 visiting gym teacher who comes once a 
 fortnight. We are also very lucky in  
 having parents who come every Thursday
 for netball and football.             
 The primary sevens from Newhall all go
 on to Fortrose Academy on the south   
 side of the Black-Isle which has about
 600 pupils, and is the only secondary 
 school on the Black-Isle.
