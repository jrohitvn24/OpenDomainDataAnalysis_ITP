		<title>17Mobile Library.</title>
		<content>  Leven has a Mobile Library van which 
 goes around the suburbs of the town   
 and also the landward area.           
  The van is driven by a man called Jim
 and a Library Assistant serves the    
 customers. It leaves in the morning at
 9.00 a.m. and goes to small villages  
 which dont have a library. People from
 farms and isolated cottages come to   
 the stopping places,such as Smithy-   
 green.                                
  Although they travel throughout the  
 year, sometimes on bad roads,they have
 never had an accident .               
               *       *               
  They have a variety of books,the most
 popular being Romances,Thrillers,     
 Westerns and Biographies.             
  They also stock childrens books and  
 large print books for people whose    
 eyesight is not so good. {
