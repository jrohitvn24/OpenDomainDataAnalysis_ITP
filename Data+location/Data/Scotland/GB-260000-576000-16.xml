		<title>16Life Styles,New Galloway</title>
		<content> The wide ranging life_styles in New   
 Galloway are closely connected to the 
 clubs described on page 9. Basically, 
 though, the villagers tend to go for  
 simpler forms of entertainment. We do 
 have more cultural activities e.g.the 
 DramaticSociety and Musical           
 Appreciation Society.There are many   
 Show Days for farming, flowers and    
 poultry. These are well attended      
 affairs. Evening entertainment tends  
 to centreround the hotelswhere darts  
 and pool are played.The majority do   
 football coupons but there are no     
 Bookmakers.Many youngsters tend to go 
 away to college/universities,only     
 returning for vacations.Those         
 youngsters who stay at home are       
 fashionable and aware of pop culture, 
 obviously due to their access to      
 media.In general, a peaceful tolerance
 reigns between the young and old.     </content>
