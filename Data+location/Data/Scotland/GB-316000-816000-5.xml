 The Lecht is 7 miles from Tomintoul on
 the Cockbridge road. The Ski Centre is
 open over the winter from nine to four
 each day. It has seven runs. The Wren,
 Robin and Petrel are easy. Kestrel,   
 Osprey and Eagle are intermediate with
 Falcon being the most difficult. Two  
 more tows are planned for next season.
 The prices for ski lessons and rental 
 are very reasonable. The centre was   
 established in the 1970's and in a    
 good weekend it can take in over      
 Â£3,000. The queues are large at the   
 peak of the season but off-peak they  
 can be very small, with very few      
 skiers on the slopes. Locally we are  
 lucky to have ski runs close by.      
 Skiing is a very popular pastime with 
 pupils at Tomintoul School and many of
 them are members of Tomintoul Ski     
 Club.                                 </content>
