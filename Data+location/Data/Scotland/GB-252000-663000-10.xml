 Govan Shipbuilders, which has         
 gradually declined, the workforce     
 reduced by thousands, although the    
{industry}is beginning to pick up new  
 orders, such as a Â£40 million ferry.  
 The area also includes Hillington     
{Industrial}Estate where there is a    
 Rolls Royce plant, furniture factories
 and depots where furniture is stored  
 and distributed; there is a glass     
 works in Ibrox which deals in sheet   
 glass.  Craigton{Industrial}Estate has
 some light industries.  In Shieldhall 
 there are also some light{industries} 
 and a food processing plant.  The     
 biggest decline in any one{industry}  
 has been that of the shipbuilders.

 there; now{17%}of that figure work    
 there, though more are being taken on.
