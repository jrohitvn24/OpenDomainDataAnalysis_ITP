		<content>    The climate in Cardross is a result
 of its position in Scotland. It is    
 kept warm by the Gulf Stream and wet  
 from the westerly winds which mass    
 over the Atlantic Ocean. The village  
 gets so much rain because Cardross is 
 on the edge of the Highland Line. Much
 rain falls on the hills.              
    The countryside surrounding        
 Cardross is very beautiful. The land  
 is mainly farmland but there are many 
 deciduous trees and shrubs on the     
 lowland,heather and bracken high on   
 the hills. There are many rights of   
 way which the Cardross Community      
 Council have fought to keep open. The 
 River Clyde flows along the shores of 
 Cardross, with its oyster catchers,   
 seagulls, mussels, crabs and seaweed a
 daily sight.
