 The western area of the landscape is  
 mostly housing and industry.  The     
 housing is built up right along the   
 main road on both sides.  There are   
 two big industries,one is the rubber  
 factory (UNIROYAL) and the second are 
 the quarries.  These quarries are     
 sandstone quarries used to build most 
 of the town. Some of the stone was    
 even taken up to Glasgow.  There is   
 also a technical college which is a   
 large building and has playing fields 
 too.  There is less farmland mostly   
 rough grazing but one or two fields   
 were ploughed up.
