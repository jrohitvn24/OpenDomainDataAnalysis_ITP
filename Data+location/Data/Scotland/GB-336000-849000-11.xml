 For many years and until fifty years  
 ago, all the farmers around Mulben    
 grew the same crop _ oats.The seed was
 planted in the Springtime and         
 harvested in the Autumn.  Oats was    
 grown for two reasons,firstly because 
 it would grow in the North of         
 Scotland, and secondly, because with  
 oats the farmer had food for his horse
 and cattle.  The farmer's wife fed her
 hens with oats. From oats, she made   
 porridge and oat_cakes for the family.
                                       
 As farms became mechanised, farmers no
 longer kept horses and so they no     
 longer needed  the same quantity of   
 oats.  Local Distillaries needed wheat
 and barley for whiskey_making.        
 Farmers stopped growing oats and      
 changed to producing wheat and barley 
 instaed.                              </content>
