		<title>14WALTER'S FAVOURITE SUNDAY</title>
		<content>   I get up at 10am on Sundays and have
 my breakfast. I then go out to my     
 motor bike and fill the tank and check
 the oil level. I get my protective    
 clothing on and test the bike. At 1pm 
 my Dad and I put the bike in the van  
 and go scrambling.                    
   We race every fortnight at different
 tracks.{Scrambling}is a form of racing
 on a dirt track. My bike is a 80cc    
 model and it will go about 70 mph.    
   My friend Tony, who lives down the  
 road, has a 125cc bike and comes with 
 us.                                   
   When we get to the track we all go  
 round the track once and then go back 
 to the starting line. There are       
 different races for different size    
 bikes.                                
   After the racing I go home and clean
 my bike and it takes ages !
