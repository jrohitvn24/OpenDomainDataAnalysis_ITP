		<content> We carried out a survey for sports and
 recreation in the Springfield area,   
 which is a modern Wimpey estate at the
 east end of Linlithgow.               
  People seem to take part in a lot of 
 sport.The most popular is swimming,   
 although people have to travel out of 
 Linlithgow unless they take classes at
 the academy,where there is a small    
 pool.                                 
  Sports clubs include athletics,      
 angling,badminton,bowling,canoeing,   
 cricket,football,golf,keep fit,       
 orienteering,rugby,sailing,squash and 
 tennis.                               
  One of the big complaints about      
 Linlithgow is that it has no swimming 
 pool apart from a private one at the  
 academy.People have to travel to      
 either Bo'ness or Grangemouth,or even 
 over 8 miles to Falkirk for swimming.
