 When I get up at ten past seven on    
 Friday morning,I dress and have my    
 breakfast.I walk to school at quarter 
 to nine.When the bell rings at nine   
 o'clock I go to the classroom and do  
 Language.Then I go out for a playtime 
 at 10.40.I come back into the         
 classroom at eleven o'clock,and then I
 do Maths until half past twelve.At    
 half past twelve I have my dinner,and 
 then go out for a playtime until half 
 past one.When I come in at half past  
 one,I read a book until our Art       
 Teacher comes.When our Art Teacher    
 comes,we do art until half past       
 three.At half past three,I go home.I  
 walk home,and I usually get home at   
 twenty to four.I have my tea at half  
 past four,and after tea I watch       
 television until about ten o'clock,and
 then go to bed.                       </content>
