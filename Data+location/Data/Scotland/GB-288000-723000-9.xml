		<content>   The population of Gilmerton consists
 of an even spread of age groups but   
 the majority of those interviewed were
 retired people or young mothers who   
 were generally the only ones at home. 
 The main leisure time activity is     
 gardening as every house has a garden 
 in this rural area.                   
   As the golf course borders the      
 village this is another activity much 
 partaken in.  There is a youth club in
 the village for the teenagers and a   
 small play area situated at the back  
 of the housing estate for the younger 
 childern.                             
   Other hobbies included photography, 
 embroidery, dress making and knitting.
