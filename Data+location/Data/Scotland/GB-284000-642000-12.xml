		<title>12Employment and Unemployment</title>
		<content> The men of this area are mainly       
 employmed as tradesmen such as        
 builders,joiners, electricians or     
 painters. There are a few             
 steelworkers, motor mechanics and     
 railway linesmen. We also have        
 signwriters, technicians, a printer   
 and a pharmacist. There are very few  
 agricultural workers considering that 
 this is a largely rural area. This is 
 due to farm mechanisation. There is a 
 considerable number of men unemployed 
 and there are about ten per cent of   
 the children living in one_parent     
 families. some of the women work in   
 local hospitals, shops or hotel.      
 Young people leaving school have the  
 usual problem of trying to find       
 work. There are a number of OAP's in  
 the area who are treated to an annual 
 holiday in the North of England paid  
 for by a lottery held in the village. </content>
