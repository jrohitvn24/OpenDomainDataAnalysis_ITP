		<title>15PAISLEY ABBEY TODAY</title>
		<content> Paisley Abbey is famous and well used.
 It belongs to Church of Scotland.  The
 minister is Johnston MacKay.  Its main
 purpose is to worship God being open  
 to all religious denominations.  It   
 has a membership of over 1,000.       
                                       
 Apart from Sunday Services, it offers 
 Brownies, Cubs and Scouts, Womens'    
 Guild and Choir.  Christenings and    
 Weddings are also performed (Weddings 
 - Â£150).  The main problem of the     
 Abbey is funding.  It is large,       
 difficult to heat and maintain.  Help 
 comes from the congregation, Teashop  
 proceeds, Historical Society, Common  
 Good Fund and Friends of the Abbey.   
 It is a centre for visitors and school
 children.  It has dominated Paisley   
 for 800 years and will hopefully      
 survive another 800 for the use of all
 Paisley Buddies.                      </content>
