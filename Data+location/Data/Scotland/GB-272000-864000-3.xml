  Ross, the assistant. took us out     
 to the fish farm in their boat from   
 Cromarty Harbour. It was a lovely day 
 and it was an interesting trip s there
 were several vessels as well as some  
 oil rigs out in the firth. The farm   
 consists of large rectangular cages   
 made of wood,bolted together with huge
 metal bolts, with a net suspended from
 each one. At present, there are seven 
 cages, all linked together, but the   
 firm plan to add another four cages   
 shortly. We walked round the wooden   
 catwalks surrounding the cages and    
 were able to see the trout and        
 salmon,about 17000 of them. We saw the
 big funnel shaped bins,suspended over 
 each cage which automatically tilt at 
 regulat intervals, to feed the fish
