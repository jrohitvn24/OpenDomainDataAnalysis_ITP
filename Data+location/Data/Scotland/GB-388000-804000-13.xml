		<content> Fine Fare Superstore, Aberdeen        
 The Fine Fare company was founded over
 1 hundred years ago, but the actua;   
 store has been there for only 20      
 years. The store sells fresh food,    
 garden products, fancy cakes. Business
 is always good especially on Fridays  
 and Saturdays. The General manager is 
 James Wildgoose with an assistant     
 manager and various department heads. 
 Altogether there are 28 employees.    
 Fine Fare at the Bridge of Dee is not 
 the only store owned by the company in
 the area. More middle aged people go  
 to Fine Fare than anyone else. There  
 are no more plans for the future      
 development of the store itself. There
 is another Fine Fare superstore at the
 Bridge of Don.
