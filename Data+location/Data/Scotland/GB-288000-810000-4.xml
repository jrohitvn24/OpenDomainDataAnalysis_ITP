		<content>{TROUT FARMING                         
 The fish farm was established in 1978.
 Every year 250000 young Canadian      
 rainbow trout are reared in 5 pools.  
 These trout grow twice as fast as the 
 native brown trout and one and a half 
 tons are sold each week.In the winter 
 a 24hr watch is kept for ice forming  
 because flowing water contains more   
 oxygen.A fishing loch is stocked for  
 anglers,and visitors can buy fresh    
 fish from the farm shop.{2)NATURE     
{CONSERVANCY}About 1225 acres of pine  
 forest and 14000 acres of high hill   
 and moorland form part of the         
 Cairngorm Nature Reserve,created to   
 conserve the wild life of the         
 mountains.{3)FORESTRY }There are 7450 
 acres of forestry on the estate,which 
 contains one of the few remaining     
 areas of naturally regenerating       
 Caledonian pine forest in Britain.    </content>
