		<title>13HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> The normal homelife of families are   
 almost identical to any in Britain.   
 Even meals are very similar with the  
 extensive use of oats disappearing    
 from the diet.                        
 The children's games have also changed
 with the times,most of the older games
 having died out.Firm favourites are   
 Chinese skipping (jumping over a long 
 loop of elastic held round the legs of
 2 friends),hopscotch (once called     
 hopping beddies) and a Gartly version 
 of cricket. The old hoop (rim of cart 
 wheel) has given way to a worn tyre.  
 Roller boots (girls) and racer bikes  
 (boys) are favoured today.  T.V. games
 and computers are now more common.    
 Many families are not active members  
 of any church,though most would       
 consider themselves Presbyterian. Some
 attend Gartly or Huntly churches.There
 are also some Roman Catholic families.</content>
