		<content> Longmorn Distillery is 91 years old.  
 The owner of Longmorn Distillery also 
 owns the Queen Anne Distillery. The   
 Distillery works all day and the      
 workers are organised into 3 shifts.  
 One shift goes to work at 6am and     
 finishes at 2pm. The next shift goes  
 on at 2pm and finishes at 10pm. The   
 last shift starts at 10pm and finishes
 at 6am. The distillery workers get 1  
 day off every 7 weeks. The workers get
 4 weeks off in summer. In total there 
 are 31 people who work at this        
 distillery. Since the 1970s 10 people 
 have been employed in making whisky as
 the demand for whisky has declined.   
 This is because wine can be produced  
 cheaply by many of the EEC countries. 
 Many people have stopped drinking     
 whisky and now enjoy wine.
