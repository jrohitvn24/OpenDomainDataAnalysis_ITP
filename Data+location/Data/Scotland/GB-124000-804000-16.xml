 My name is Haydn Samuels. I am one of 
 the two children who live on Canna. I 
 live in a modern, wooden bungalow. It 
 is a tied house to my Dad's job. It is
 a warm house because it has a stove   
 that burns anything. The stove heats  
 our water and 7 radiators which when  
 it is burning are piping hot. We also 
 have an immersion heater which warms  
 our water when the generator is on. We
 have an open fire in our living room. 
 We get our electricity from a 7 Kw    
 generator about 15 metres from our    
 house. The washing is done in a normal
 washing machine but to use the machine
 the generator has to be switched on   
  We can use the generator only when   
 we really need it because of the cost 
 of diesel.
