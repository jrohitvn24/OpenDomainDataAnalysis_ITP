		<content>{Milesmark Primary School} has 4       
 teachers and 70 children.  The school 
 was built in 1876 and is 109 years    
 old.  There are only 4 classrooms and 
 a hall in the school.                 
 The children are all aged between 5   
 and 12 years old.                     
 We take part in many activities.      
 There is a football team, a netball   
 team and we take part in the district 
 sports.                               
 A typical day for us at Milesmark     
 would be to do some maths work, some  
 handwriting, some reading activities, 
 gym and project work.                 
 We get a bottle of milk just before   
 interval and at interval the children 
 serve in the school tuckshop.         
 Most children go home for their lunch.
