		<content> steadings are empty and falling into  
 dilapidation, but the policy of the   
 owners has been not to sell to parties
 interested in restoring them.         
 The names of these farms and their    
 past history are locally well known   
 and accepted landmarks of the         
 Blackford community.                  
 Rabbits are the biggest pest on the   
 land and the few gamekeepers cannot   
 keep them under control.              
 Flocks of migrating geese in large    
 numbers are part of the colourful     
 Autumn scene at Blackford as they fly 
 in vast formations high above the     
 village with their haunting cry and   
 often be seen descending into the     
 fields to eat their fill of grasses   
 and seed.
