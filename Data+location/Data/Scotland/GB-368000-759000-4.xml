		<content>  Sunnyside Royal Hospital is a        
 hospital which caters for the         
 problems of mental health.It deals    
 with the{mentally ill}rather than the 
 mentally handicapped and has around   
 350 patients.The first Lunatic Asylum 
 in Scotland was set up in Montrose in 
 1781 due to the efforts of{Mrs. Susan 
{Carnegie.}It was moved to{Sunnyside,  
 Hillside in 1858 when the Main        
 Building was completed. There are     
 three kinds of patient in the         
 Hospital,short stay, long stay and    
 geriatric and there are as many staff 
 to care for them ranging from doctors 
 to cobblers. The one big change has   
 been the attempt to get more patients 
 to live in their own communities. Now 
 we recognise that mental illness can  
 be cured or kept under control and    
 Sunnyside is like any other hospital.
