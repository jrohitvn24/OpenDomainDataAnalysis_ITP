		<content> It should be a{Social Concern}that the
 lido or Crownest Park, in the centre  
 of Stenhousemuir has been allowed to  
 become a victim of{Vandalism}. It     
 always has been vandalised -as it was 
 in its very beginning when the        
 children played in the snad stores of 
 Carron Iron Works. But the vandalism  
 today has reached a point where local 
 children no longer find as much       
 pleasure from it. Some swings are     
 split down the middle, the tennis     
 courts have broken glass all over     
 them, the pond is polluted with       
 litter, oil drums, trolleys. When     
 asked by why the Lido was so{polluted}
 the Park Keeper said that the people  
 used the place as a{Rubbish Dump},    
 that the chutes, trampolines and      
 putting green were removed because of 
 incessant vandalism but the boats and 
 the football pitch are in good order. </content>
