		<content> When we went to a factory they told us
 that when the fish comes from the     
 market they are kept cold until the   
 filleters can fillet the fish.There   
 are 10 boxes of fish on a palet.There 
 are 100 fish in a box.                
 When the fish are filleted the bones  
 are kept.They are put in plate        
 freezers and they are taken to be made
 into dog food.One man was making a    
 pickle with salt and water.The English
 people like colouring but Scots don't.
 If the fish are not kept cool they go 
 bad.It is Â£30 for a box of fish.They  
 have to buy 15,000 boxes of fish a    
 week.                                 
 There is a grading machine.It has an  
 electronic eye that says to one of the
 pushers to push,and it pushes the fish
 into the box.They employ 72 people.The
 cold store is -40 degrees and all the 
 fish are kept in there.               </content>
