		<title>01THE BACK DISTRICT</title>
		<content> The{Back District}of the Isle of Lewis
 consists of the villages of{Back, Coll
{and Gress.}                           
                                       
 These villages lie on improved grass- 
 land between the rough interior moor- 
 land and the area of sea known as     
{Broad Bay,}once a noted haddock fish- 
 ing ground, but now depleted.         
                                       
 The surveyed area has 328 houses, and 
 is primarily a crofting community, but
 few inhabitants make their full living
 in this way.                          
                                       
 The Back District is highly dependent 
 for shopping facilities and employment
 on the town of{Stornoway}which is     
 7 miles away.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
