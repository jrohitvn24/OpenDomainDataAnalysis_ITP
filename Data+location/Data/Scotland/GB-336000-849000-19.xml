		<title>19Domesday Survey Day _ Mulben</title>
		<content>                                       
 To_day is a Domesday Survey Day.  I   
 got up at eight o'clock, my usual time
 for a school day. For my breakfast I  
 had tea and toast.  After breakfast, I
 set off for school, remembering to    
 bring my wellingtons. I would need    
 them for the visits to two farms where
 we were going to interview the farmers
 as part of our Class Domesday Project 
 Survey.                               
 The mini_bus arrived at 09.30, and we 
 set off. We drove along the A95 and   
 soon got our first view of the Hill of
 Mulderie.  At Mr. Addison's farm, he  
 told us about his prize _ winning     
 beasts.  We walked to the Level       
 Crossing and saw the Watershed of two 
 burns. On our way to the second farm  
 we passed Glentauchers Distillery.    
 Before returning to school, we visited
 the bonded warehouses.                </content>
