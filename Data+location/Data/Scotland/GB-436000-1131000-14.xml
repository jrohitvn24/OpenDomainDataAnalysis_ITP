		<title>14THE BRIDGES</title>
		<content>      BEFORE THE BRIDGES WERE BUILT    
 FROM THE MAINLAND TO BURRA AND TRONDRA
 PEOPLE HAD TO TRAVEL TO SCALLOWAY BY  
 A SMALL PASSENGER BOAT.WHEN THE BRIDGE
 CAME PEOPLE IN BURRA HAD THE          
 OPPORTUNITY TO WORK OUTSIDE,MAYBE IN  
 LERWICK OR AT SULLOM VOE.SOME PEOPLE  
 MOVED IN BECAUSE LERWICK IS ONLY TEN  
 MILES FROM LERWICK.MORE PEOPLE MOVED  
 IN MANY LIVING IN CARAVANS,AND THE    
 COUNCIL HAD TO BUILD A LOT OF NEW     
 HOUSING.THERE HAVE  BEEN A LOT OF     
 PRIVATE HOUSES BUILT AT BRIDGE END    
 TOO.CHILDREN FROM BOTH SCHOOLS WENT TO
 HAMNAVOE AND WITH AN INCREASE IN THE  
 NUMBER OF YOUNG FAMILIES A NEW SCHOOL 
 WAS BUILT.THERE ARE LESS SHOPS AT     
 BRIDGE END MAINLY BECAUSE PEOPLE DO   
 MORE SHOPPING OUTSIDE BURRA.THERE ARE 
 ALSO MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEISURE   
 ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE BURRA.
