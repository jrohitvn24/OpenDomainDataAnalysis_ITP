		<content> An Old Lady Remembers                 
 We went to Naver House,the old folks' 
 home in Thurso to interview some old  
 people about Thurso before Dounreay.  
 The old lady that we interviewed was  
 about 85 years old.She told us that   
 Thurso once consisted of fishing and  
 flagstone industries.The smaller      
 population was one of the main        
 differences and people were not as    
 friendly then as they are now.        
{"Punk Rocker"Fashions                 
{An extreme example of fashion to be   
{seen around Thurso is the Punk fashion
{-studded dog collars,nose and ear-    
{rings,tight bleached cotton trousers, 
{bleached cotton jackets with metal    
{chains and Mohican Indian hairstyles. 
{Ordinary people wear less exotic      
{clothes.                              
{
