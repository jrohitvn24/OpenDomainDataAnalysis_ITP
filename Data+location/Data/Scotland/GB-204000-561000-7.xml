		<content>      Our school, Sheuchan Primary, was
 built in 1862 and was originally known
 as Leswalt Sheuchan Madras School. The
 Leswalt part is easily understood     
 since the school lies in the Leswalt  
 Parish, but it is thought that the    
 Madras part was incorporated due to   
 the receipt of a grant from Dr. Bell's
 Madras Trust for building the school. 
 While it is doubtful if Madras aws    
 ever officially part of the school    
 name, there is no doubt in the mind of
 the general public that it is so, for 
 many of the older inhabitants of the  
 town still, to this day, refer to the 
 school as The Sheuchan Madras.At this 
 time Mr Pauling and Miss E Mc Lellan  
 were appointed as headmaster and      
 teacher, assisted by 4 pupil teachers,
 all in their teens. The school role   
 for this 3-classroomed school was 240 
 children.                             </content>
