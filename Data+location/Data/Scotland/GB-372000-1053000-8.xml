		<title>08NORTH RONALDSAY'S BIRDS</title>
		<content> North Ronaldsay is a very special     
 place for birds.Because of its        
 situation,migrating birds are seen in 
 large numbers in spring and Autumn    
 moving to and from the Scandinadian   
 countries as well as the island groups
 of Shetland and Faeroe,and also       
 Iceland and Greenland.Some even come  
 and go to Canada,and rare birds from  
 as far as Siberia arrive every year.  
 The birds concentrate on islands      
 because they connot rest on the       
 sea.The movement of seabirds is also  
 well seen from the top of the island  
 being the boundry between the North   
 Sea and the Atlantic Ocean,and in the 
 right season with suitable weather    
 conditions,tens of thousands of       
 seabirds can be seen moving between   
 the two.
