		<title>17CHEMICALS WALKERBURN</title>
		<content>{Rathburn Chemicals}opened in 1972,was 
 founded by Dr.Angus Mackay.There is a 
 small workforce.Most chemicals used,  
 are oil based.Materials of the best   
 possible quality are obtained,treated 
 in a variety of ways and finally      
 distilled.In some of the chemicals    
 used,impurities in 1 ml, must be kept 
 at less than one part per million.They
 use quantities of distilled water     
 which they make.We saw the process of 
 distillation.They purify solvent for  
 analytical chemists and supply        
 material used in protein analysis     
 chemistry which is one of the areas   
 being intensively investigated in     
 cancer research laboratories all over 
 the world.They export to U.S.A.       
 Scandinavia ,France ,Germany ,Austria 
 Switzerland ,Finland and to many other
 countries.They use polystyrene for    
 packing for export due to its weight. </content>
