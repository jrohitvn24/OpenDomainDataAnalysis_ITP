		<title>05GALA WEEK IN LITTLEMILL</title>
		<content> Every year our district holds a Gala  
 Week.This year it starts on Sunday 9th
 June.All the people in the village    
 decorate their house with flags made  
 out of cloth or coloured polythene    
 bags.The Gala Queen is chosen by lot  
 from all the girls who are 12 years   
 old or over and live in the           
 surrounding area.This year our Gala   
 Queen is Shawn McIndoe who lives on a 
 local farm.As well as a queen we have 
 two attendants and a page boy.They too
 are chosen by lot.It is unusual for   
 the attendants to be in the same      
 family but this year it has           
 happened.Jo-Ann,Jardene and Jamie     
 Ferguson are this year's              
 attendants.Usually our Gala Week      
 starts on a Monday,but this year we   
 are having a Fun Run on Sunday to help
 raise funds for the Gala Week.
