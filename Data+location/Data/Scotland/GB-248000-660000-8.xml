		<content>{Blackbyres Farm}is run very much on   
 the same lines as Harelaw.It takes up 
 150 acres. Instead of silage making   
 Blackbyres grows turnips to supplement
 the animals' food. They also keep     
 sheep but these are grazed in a rented
 field in Newton Mearns on the south   
 side of Glasgow. The farmer has had   
 experience of sheep worrying and has  
 been forced to use his gun on two dogs
 which savaged lambs and later came    
 back for more. Once a dog has tasted  
 blood it will return.                 
 Both this farm and Harelaw Farm,      
 described on Pages 6&amp;7 are            
 self-sufficient and milk producing.
