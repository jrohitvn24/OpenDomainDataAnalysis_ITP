		<title>12Recreation in Stirling</title>
		<content> Apart from church halls there are the 
 Cowane Centre and the Albert Hall,    
 where concerts, flower shows, antique 
 shows take place. In the winter there 
 are karate classes in the Tolbooth.   
 Stirling has an Amateur Operatic      
 Society and two drama clubs. The      
 cinema has two theatres which each    
 show films every day. In the same     
 building is a Bingo Hall. Two housing 
 areas have community centres where    
 many social gatherings, club meetings 
 and activities take place. There are  
 also several clubs such as the        
 Aquarist club, Art clubs, Writers'    
 Workshop, chess clubs and Conservation
 club. In Wallace High School they put 
 on plays run entirely by the children 
 and, only when needed, do the adults  
 help. They also have classes for      
 adults, during the winter. In Stirling
 there is plenty for all ages to do.   </content>
