		<title>15Means of Travel in Ceres</title>
		<content>  The majority  of  people in  the area
 have cars.  They  use them  mainly for
 work and shopping.                    
                                       
  Cycling is very popular with children
 but not with adults  possibly  because
 Ceres is almost surrounded by hills.  
                                       
  The buses are used mainly  by  senior
 citizens,  who enjoy free travel,  and
 younger people under seventeen.  There
 is  an  hourly  bus service to  Cupar,
 the nearest town,  and  this  is  used
 most often.                           
                                       
  The  nearest  railway  station  is in
 Cupar  and  travel  by  rail  is  used
 mainly for  visits  to  Edinburgh  and
 Dundee for shopping.
