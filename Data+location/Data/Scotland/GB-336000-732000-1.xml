		<title>01NORTH WEST DUNDEE</title>
		<content> Our area is located in the north west 
 of the city of Dundee and extends     
 beyond the boundary of the city into  
 some fine parklands and agricultural  
 areas.Dundee itself is an industrial  
 city of approximately 180,000         
 inhabitants.  The area contains       
 a mix of industrial developments and  
 agricultural land as well as a range  
 of housing and leisure facilities     
 which seem to us typical of the best  
 of Britain today. Perhaps the best    
 features of our area are the extensive
 Camperdown Park, Clatto Reservoir     
 Country Park and water sports centre, 
 and Downfield Golf Club, though we are
 also proud of the place Dundee (and   
 particularly our area) holds in terms 
 of industrial development and         
 leadership.We are the home of both    
 Timex and NCR, prominent in           
 electronics.                          </content>
