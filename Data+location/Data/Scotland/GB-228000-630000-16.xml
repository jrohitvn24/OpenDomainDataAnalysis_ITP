		<content> CLOTHES In school we have to wear a   
 formal uniform which we wear with     
 pride.The school tie has a crest on it
 which allows people to know which     
 school we attend.I always feel proud  
 to wear my school outfit.At home we   
 wear a variety of clothes.Some are    
 designed for leisure and others for   
 more formal events like discos and    
 family events.                        
 SHOES. These again vary with where    
 they are to be worn.We have laced,    
 buckled,court and training shoes all  
 in different sizes and colours.       
 HOBBIES.My hobbies are athletics,     
 swimming and tennis.Each Saturday I   
 get pocket money to spend on          
 recreation.If I have anything left I  
 buy cosmetics ,pencils, pens and books
 on my favourite sports.For seven years
 I have never been beaten at a sports  
 meeting.I was sports champion 1985.   </content>
