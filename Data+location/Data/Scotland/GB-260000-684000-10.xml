		<content> This area is dominated by steep slopes
 and high land reaching well over 400m.
 This high land is made of lava which  
 was probably extruded from the vents  
 at{Dunmore and Dungoil,}two prominent 
 hills.                                
                                       
 The valley of the{River Endrick}has   
 been given the characteristic wide{   
{U shape}by the ice flowing from Loch  
 Lomond during the ice age.{Striations}
 (glacial scratches) can be clearly    
 seen on{Dunmore.}A{glacial lake delta 
 is located at 635.858 along with {    
{fluvio-glacial deposits.              
{                                      
 River features are very varied ranging
 from the steep and dangerous{Gonachan 
{Glen}to the wide flood plain of the   
{Endrick.
