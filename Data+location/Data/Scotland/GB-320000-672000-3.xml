 I wake up and put my school uniform   
 on. I brush my hair.{The school       
{uniform is brown and pink.}I go up for
 breakfast. I have Alpen I put milk and
 sugar in it. I go to school in a car. 
 I wait in the playground till the bell
 rings at 8.55. I get hard work to do. 
 We go to watch a TV programme called  
 Watch. I go to school dinners I like  
 the macaroni.After lunch I go out to  
 play. I play  fairy houses. I come in 
 and I do some more work. I have a shot
 on the computer. Then I go home and I 
 watch TV. My favourite programme is   
 The Puppy's New Adventure.            
 I have some supper then I have a bath.
 I splash all the water out. I have an 
 apple before I go to bed. I do not    
 snore but Gaby my sister  does.
