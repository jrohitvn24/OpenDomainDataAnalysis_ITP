		<title>08SHOPPING</title>
		<content>  As there are no shops in Greenloaning
 everyone has to travel to shop.Most   
 people travel to Stirling to do their 
 main shopping at Tesco or Fine Fare   
 for groceries. The Thistle Centre has 
 lots of shops in it where you can buy 
 clothes, shoes, furniture, electrical 
 goods,books,meat,bread,cakes,medicines
 and almost anything you can think of. 
 The bus service is poor,one every two 
 hours, so most people drive there. The
 distance is about 20km. The nearest   
 shops are in Braco where there is the 
 Post Office,newsagents&amp; general store,
 and the V.G store. A butcher's van    
 comes on Tuesday and Friday each week 
 from the Butcher's shop in Dunblane,  
 and Sandy,the butcher, is always      
 cheery. The fishmonger comes early on 
 Wednesday morning with nice fresh fish
 from Arbroath.These are the only vans 
 that come to Greenloaning.            </content>
