		<title>13Farming - Denny &amp; Dunipace</title>
		<content> Denny and Dunipace lie just outside   
 the vast{Carse of Stirling,}one of the
 most productive areas in Scotland. Our
 land is made up from shale, sandstone 
 and coal. It is watered by the Carron.
 Fields are divided by{dry-stane dykes 
 and{hawthorn hedges}and there are a   
 few modern fences. Until a century    
 ago, our area was very  agricultural  
 and{Grand Ploughing Contests}were big 
 social events. Today most of the      
 fields are used for grazing both dairy
 and beef cattle. More grass than hay  
 is grown and kept for silage. Other   
 crops found are barley, a little wheat
 and a few potatoes. We saw one field  
 of oil_seed rape. This is the first   
 year it has grown here, due to{E.E.C. 
{subsidy.}The E.E.C. wants farm workers
 to earn as much as others and         
 encourages farmers to improve land,   
 equipment and buildings.              </content>
