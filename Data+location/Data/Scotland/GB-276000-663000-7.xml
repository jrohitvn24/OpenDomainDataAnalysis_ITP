		<content> IN JUNE 1985 THE ANNUAL FAIR WAS      
 HELD.AIRDRIE WAS GRANTED LICENCE TO   
 HAVE ANNUAL FAIRS IN 1695.AS IN THE   
 OLD DAYS,THERE WERE MANY OPEN STALLS  
 PLACED IN THE TOWN CENTRE WHICH WAS   
 PEDESTRIANISED FOR EIGHT HOURS.THERE  
 WAS THE USUAL DISPLAY OF HIGHLAND     
 DANCING,MUSIC BY VARIOUS BANDS        
 INCLUDING THE LOCAL BRASS BAND.THERE  
 WERE ALSO OTHER DISPLAYS EG. AN ARMY  
 RIFLE RANGE &amp; VARIOUS COMPETITIONS    
 SUCH AS QUIZZES AND CHESS.NOWADAYS    
 THERE IS NO LIVESTOCK SOLD.           
     IT WAS NOT SO SUCCESSFUL THIS YEAR
 AS IT WAS "AUFY CAULD"(AWFUL COLD).IN 
 THE EVENING THERE WAS A SPECIAL NIGHT 
 IN THE SIR JOHN WILSON TOWN HALL.     
       TODAY'S AIRDRIONIANS,LIKE

 FAIR DAY WITH DANCING.
