 The children of the island play       
 football, on the beach and on their   
 bikes. If they have to play indoors   
 they watch television if the generator
 is on, read or play lego.             
 Many of the adults are interested in  
 gardening, mainly vegetables to       
 supplement the supplies from Mallaig. 
 Many adults enjoy walking and collect 
 drift wood and fish boxes from the    
 shore.                                
 In winter it gets dark earlier than in
 summer so more indoor activities such 
 as home brewing, sewing, reading, wood
 working and watching television take  
 place. Last winter there was enough   
 snow for some people to go skiing on  
 Sanday.
