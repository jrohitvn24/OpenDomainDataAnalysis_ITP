		<content>{Skene school}is very small and old. It
 was built around the beginning of the 
 twentieth century.                    
 Miss Jamieson is the headteacher of   
 the school and has been for four      
 years. She is one of four teachers    
 .There are 75 pupils split into four  
 classes p1/2,p3/4,p5/6 and a small p7.
   Their school uniform is a grey skirt
 or trousers,blue or white shirt or    
 blouse and the school tie is a light  
 blue stripe and a dark blue stripe.   
   Skene school was a secondary before 
 it was converted to a primary in 1965.
   There are two sport's days per      
 year.One is an intersports when they  
 compete against Echt,Clunie,Midmar and
 Dunecht.The other is a school sport's 
 day.                                  
 The school has no full_time janitor so
 p7 are responsible for duties such as 
 ringing the bell,getting mail etc.    </content>
