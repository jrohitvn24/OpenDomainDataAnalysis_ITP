   There was a new Lairds Mansion built
 near the present Sumburgh Hotel in the
 17th century. All the Lairds were     
 fiercely disliked as they were harsh  
 rulers. The Lairds came from Scotland 
 as Shetland had been transferred as   
 part of the king of Norway's          
 daughter's dowry. Princess Margaret   
 married James 3 future king of        
 Scotland.                             
  Many Cairns, Burnt Mounds and        
 archaeological sites are to be found  
 in our area.                          
  More recently evidence of Shetland's 
 part in the two World Wars can be seen
 in old gun sites and air raid         
 shelters. Also there have been several
 plane crashes. The worst happened in  
 July 1979 when 17 people died.        
  Our area attracts many archaeologists
 and new sites are continually found.  </content>
