		<title>10CHANGES IN LITTLEMILL</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mr.John Brown who is   
 our school janitor.He has lived in the
 area for 60 years.He told us that the 
 biggest change which he had noticed   
 was that the village and surrounding  
 area was now sparsely populated where 
 as when he was a boy the community had
 been a thriving one.This change       
 appears to be due to the closure of   
 the local pits.Mr.Brown lives in a    
 cottage called the Castle.It got its  
 name when the local gamekeeper lived  
 there because he was a very important 
 person to the local people.Mr.Brown   
 enjoys living there because he keeps  
 greyhounds for a hobby and obviously  
 they need a lot of space.Mr.Brown and 
 his wife who is our dinner lady,were  
 married in the school by the Rev.     
 Blackadder who was the minister of the
 parish of Coylton at that time.
