		<title>14THE BEACH NEAR CARNOUSTIE</title>
		<content>   The stretch of{coastline}in this    
 area is excellent for its{rock pools. 
   There is a twice-daily tide cycle   
 and different things can be seen at   
 the various stages of the tide.  The  
 movement of the large boulders makes  
 them grind away at the bedrock        
 underneath until huge{potholes}are    
 formed.  These, of course, provide    
 homes for creatures which have to be  
 constantly surrounded by salt water.  
  {Starfish}and{sea-urchins}abound as  
 do many kinds of{crab. }Indeed there  
 are no fewer than 13 types of crab and
{lobster}to be found.  The most common 
 is the{Green Shore Crab,}others are   
 the{Edible Crab, Common Spider Crab   
 and the{Hermit Crab.} Many interesting
 shells are also to be found.          
 There are{limpets, periwinkles,       
{scallops, whelks, cowries,            
{mussels, cockles}and{razor shells.    </content>
