		<title>02DAY IN THE LIFE OF A PUPIL</title>
		<content> My name is Louise Williamson I am at  
 the Gordon Schools Huntly. I get up at
 7am and catch the bus at 8.10am. When 
 I get to school there is assembly     
 which starts around 9am. At assembly  
 the rector reads a short passage from 
 a book.After that there are some      
 anouncements. At the end everyone goes
 off to their own class. My best class 
 is Home Economics because I Iike      
 cooking and sewing. At dinner time    
 there is a school canteen and anyone  
 can staybut you must have a dinner    
 ticket which you can get at           
 interval. After I get home from school
 I watch TV most of the time and       
 sometimes I help my dad.On Mondays I  
 go to dancing I do Highland,National  
 and Tap and on Thursdays I go to      
 Karate.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
