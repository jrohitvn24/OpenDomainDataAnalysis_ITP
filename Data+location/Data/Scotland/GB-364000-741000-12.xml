		<content> Mary, who used to be both pupil and   
 cleaner,at our school came to talk of 
 the changes she had seen. She came in 
 1911 aged five.At this time there were
 coal fires,paraffin lamps,the desks   
 were in tiers  and lessons were       
 written on a slate We were very       
 interested to hear about 'school      
 dinners',when Mary came back to work  
 at the school.One of the outbuildings 
 was the soup kitchen.Mary had to light
 the fire to heat the soup ,and water  
 to wash the dishes . The soup was     
 carried into the school in buckets and
 the children  ate it at their desks.It
 cost one old penny for as much as you 
 wanted! Every morning at 7 a.m. she   
 had to stoke up the fires.Each month  
 about two tons of anthracite was      
 delivered so you can see how hard she 
 had to work!
