		<content> Wright and Greig,Scotch Whisky        
 blenders of Glasgow began building the
 distillery in 1898.It was built       
 because at that time there was a high 
 demand for malt whisky.It was built in
 a hollow which had the advantage that 
 the water supply came under           
 pressure.In the 1930s Dallas Dhu      
 closed down because of the economic   
 depression and again between 1940 and 
 1947 because of wartime restrictions  
 on the use of barley.In 1983 Dallas   
 Dhu closed down because of a decline  
 in the market for Scotch Whisky.There 
 used to be fifteen people employed    
 there but now there are only three    
 maintaining the building and          
 transferring the stock to other       
 distilleries.The Scottish Development 
 Department are interested in reopening
 the distillery as a museum showing how
 a Scottish Distillery operates.       </content>
