		<content> There are schools in both villages.   
 Both are long established, and both,  
 after many years of dwindling rolls,  
 now have fairly settled annual        
 populations of about 50 pupils.       
 Because they are fairly small, there  
 is a close-knit "family" atmosphere   
 about the schools, and the visitor's  
 first impression is that they are     
 happy, lively places, where the       
 children enjoy their school day.      
 Although basically rural in nature,   
 there is close liaison with           
 surrounding schools of the same type, 
 and there is is healthy competition in
 the football/netball leagues in which 
 even the smallest schools compete.    
 Thevillage schools are focal points   
 for the communities, and there is much
 two way co-operation, communication   
 and support between school and        
 community.                            </content>
