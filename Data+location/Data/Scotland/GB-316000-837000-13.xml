		<title>13LATER BALLINDALLOCH HISTORY</title>
		<content> The old turnpike road used to run from
 Peterfair down towards the church,past
 Pitchaish House to the ferry crossing 
 the Spey.This ferry was worked at one 
 time by brothers called Black,and from
 this comes the name Blacksboat by     
 which that place is now known.        
   The inscriptions on the gravestones 
 in the churchyard tell us that many   
 natives of Ballindalloch emigrated in 
 the past to places like America, the  
 West Indies and Australia, to make a  
 living and sometimes even a fortune.  
   On the gravestones are many names of
 crofts that have now vanished, due to 
 the effects of depopulation and land- 
 amalgamation into larger farm-units.  
  The gravestones show that families   
 used to have far more children, but   
 that many died in infancy,childhood or
 young adulthood from diseases like    
 diphtheria which are now very rare.   </content>
