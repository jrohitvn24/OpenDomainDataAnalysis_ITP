		<title>06THE CREEL INN</title>
		<content> The Creel Inn is a seafood restaurant.
 It specialises in lobsters and crab   
 caught locally.It has a bar, dining   
 room and a lounge. The Creel Inn is   
 recommended by Egon Ronay, a good food
 guide and has a reputation for really 
 good seafood. It is a very old        
 building and although it has been     
 modernized and extended people still  
 come to enjoy the old world           
 atmosphere.It is made up from 3       
 fishermens' houses. It is busy at     
 lunch-time and in the evenings and    
 although it is an Inn you cannot stay 
 overnight. It is usually run by a     
 family and some part-time helpers.
