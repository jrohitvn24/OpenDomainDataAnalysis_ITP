		<content>     {LEGEND OF ST.TROTHAN             
{ Andrew Gilbertson}was an unlucky,poor
 crofter living in{Murkle.} Hens went  
 missing and then his cow went dry.    
  One night he dreamt that a man told  
 him to walk the beach until he found  
 something that would make him rich.   
 This he did until he found a {chest}  
 with a cross on it.When he opened it  
 he found a baby girl whom he kept even
 though he had twelve girls already.   
  Then Andrew's luck changed.His cow   
 gave the best milk,his crops          
 flourished,his sheep lived and his    
 hens did not go missing.He bought a   
 larger farm at {Olrig}.The girl was   
 named Trothan.By the age of six she   
 had magical powers.She even had second
 sight.When she died she was buried in{
{Olrig Kirkyard}.On her grave is a hole
 which is always damp and, if tampered 
 with, disaster will follow.           </content>
