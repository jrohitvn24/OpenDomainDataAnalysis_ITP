		<title>13TAKING HOME PEATS</title>
		<content> The peats have to be taken off the    
 banks by tractor and trailer to the   
 road where they are often dumped off  
 while the tractor goes back on to the 
 soft moss for another load. Once it   
 comes back, the unloaded peats are    
 carefully stacked back on, and the    
 bigger, topped up load, goes off down 
 the road to the house.  Even then the 
 work isn't finished as the peats have 
 to be stacked carefully.  If you don't
 stack them they will be soaked in the 
 long wet winter, and all your work    
 will have been in vain.
