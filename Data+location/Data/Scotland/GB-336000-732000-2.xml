		<content> In our area there are a great many    
 different things to do in our spare   
 time.  We are very lucky to have so   
 many places where we can go in our    
 spare time.                           
 One of these places is{Camperdown Park
 where there is lots to do.  You can   
 play tennis or go bowling or play     
 pitch and putt.  There is a play park 
 with swings for younger children and  
 an adventure playground for older     
 children.  There is also a zoo which  
 has Jeremy the bear who was at one    
 time very famous in the Sugar Puffs   
 advert.  Throughout the park are a    
 number of picnic areas.               
 In another part of our area is the {  
{Dick McTaggart Centre}named after     
 Dundee's most famous boxer,  who won a
 gold medal at the 1956 Olympics.  At  
 this centre a whole range of sporting 
 activities may be carried out.        </content>
