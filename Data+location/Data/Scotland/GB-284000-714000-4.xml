 The church is a handsome sandstone    
 building erected in {1826} and the    
 bell was added in {1828. }In the      
 vestibule are memorial plaques. The   
 collection plates are of pewter and   
 dated {1808.}The church can seat 1400 
 but the roll in 1985 is {420}.A recent
 alteration is the division into the   
 main seating area with a small hall at
 the rear of the church for use with   
 smaller groups. This was named the {  
{Bruce Hall},after the previous        
 minister, Rev. Duncan Bruce. The      
 gallery is no longer in use apart from
 the taking of video films at          
 weddings.The present minister is the {
{Rev. Stanley Strachan} who is also    
 chaplain to the school and takes a    
 short service each week.The clock is  
 now back in working order and welcomed
 as the return of an "old friend".     </content>
