		<content> As there is no mains gas power in     
 Harris people rely on other sources of
 power.Propane gas is used for cookers 
 and heaters.Electricity is the main   
 source of power.Hydro-electricity is  
 produced at a generating station at   
 Loch Chliostair.Power is carried      
 overland to consumers as the rocky    
 land makes burial of cables expensive 
 and impractical.This makes them       
 vulnerable to the weather,especially  
 high winds;power cuts can be frequent 
 particulary in winter.Most people have
 open fires on which they burn coal or 
 peat.Peat is usually used and is cut  
 from the moors around Tarbert,mainly  
 during April and May.The dry peats are
 brought home during the summer.Working
 at the peats is a family activity,the 
 oldest to the  youngest  have  some   
 job to do.Wind and wave power have    
 been considered.                      </content>
