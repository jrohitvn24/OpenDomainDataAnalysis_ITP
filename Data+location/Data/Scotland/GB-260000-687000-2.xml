		<title>02The friendly folk of FINTRY</title>
		<content> Unlike some parts of the country where
 newcomers wait years to be accepted,  
 Scots hospitality is legendary. This  
 is nowhere more true than in Fintry.  
                                       
 The incomer is welcomed and if from   
 the more reticent south, can become   
 slightly overwhelmed by it all.       
                                       
 What do we find to do in such a small 
 village in the evenings ? Like many   
 such communities, the problem is more 
 one of trying to spend time at home.  
                                       
 You can live quietly, but most join in
 something. Everybody knows everybody, 
 and help when needed is always there. 
                                       
 When it comes to choosing somewhere to
 live, Fintry - like many similar sized
 communities - demonstrates that       
      {  "small IS beautiful".         </content>
