		<title>07HOLM EVANGELICAL CHURCH</title>
		<content>    This church was started in 1982 by 
 a group of Christians living in the   
 Holm area. The building once belonged 
 to nearby Drumdevan House (which has  
 beautiful peacocks roaming around) and
 was used as stables. Later, it was an 
 architect's office and house and today
 it is a church and Christian Centre.  
                                       
    We saw the{MOTHERS AND TODDLERS    
{GROUP}where we counted 16 babies of 2 
 years old and under with their        
 mothers. Some were playing with toys  
 while others were sleeping in their   
 prams. We had juice and biscuits.     
                                       
    There were only 12 present at the  
 first adult service in 1982. Today    
 over 90 regularly attend and plans are
 being considered to build a bigger    
 church.
