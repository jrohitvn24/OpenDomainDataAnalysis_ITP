		<title>20FISHING LANDINGS AT EYEMOUTH</title>
		<content> Fish are landed and auctioned at the  
 pier.Boatbuilding takes place in the  
 yard across the harbour and in yards  
 behind the harbour fish is still      
 filleted and smoked.During last       
 year(1984)the total weight of fish    
 landed was 10753 tonnes,with a total  
 value of Â£7772441.The bulk of fish    
 landed was haddock(3631 t),cod(2691   
 t),and whiting(1159 t).There were 207 
 tonnes of lemon sole,297 tonnes of    
 place and smaller landings            
 of saith,dogfish,halibut,monkfish and 
 lesser known varietes.The largest     
 landings of shellfish were prawns(1300
 t),and edible crabs(751 t).100 years  
 ago there were 90 herring boats in the
 herring fleet at Eyemouth,but,since   
 overfishing resulted in a ban on the  
 landing of"silver darlings"no herring 
 have been caught.
