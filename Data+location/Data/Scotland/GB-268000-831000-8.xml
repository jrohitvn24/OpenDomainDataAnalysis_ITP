		<title>08THE SHEEPFOLD AT GAICH</title>
		<content>                                       
  At Gaich there is a sheepfold which  
 used to be used for dipping sheep.    
  The sheep were put in a main pen.A   
 gate was opened to let in enough sheep
 to fill the second pen.When the men   
 were ready they grabbed one of the    
 sheep and dumped it in a dipper of    
 disinfectant that killed ticks and    
 other bothering insects.              
  The sheep then clambered into a third
 pen which would begin to fill up with 
 dipped sheep.                         
  The men would let the the dipped     
 sheep out into the field when the     
 third pen was full.                   
  This would carry on till all the     
 sheep in the main pen had been dipped.
  Sheep still have to be dipped twice a
 year by law to prevent the spread of  
 disease and pests but not in this     
 fold.                                 </content>
