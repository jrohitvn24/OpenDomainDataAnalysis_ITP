		<title>14TRANSPORT IN BREICH VALLEY</title>
		<content>    In our class of 22 pupils only five
 families have cars. This is normal for
 our area and means that most people   
 have to rely on public transport.     
     The most popular form of transport
 is bus.There are half hourly services 
 from both Stoneyburn and Addiewell to 
 Livingston and Bathgate. Breich is not
 so well served but it does have an    
 hourly service.                       
    No part of this area is more than  
 10 minutes by road from the M8        
 motorway which runs between Glasgow   
 and Edinburgh.                        
    Addiewell also stands on a railway 
 line and has an hourly service to both
 Edinburgh and Glasgow.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
