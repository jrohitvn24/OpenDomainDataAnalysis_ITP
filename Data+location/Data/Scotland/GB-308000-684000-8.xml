		<title>08Education, Pitreavie School.</title>
		<content> In 1969 Pitreavie Primary School (our 
 school) was built.  It was built on   
 farmland and started with 200 pupils. 
 Later it rose to 700 pupils.          
 There are 16 classrooms and rooms for 
 a headteacher, two assistants, a      
 secretary and a janitor.  There are   
 also 16 toilets, a gym/dining hall    
 with its own kitchen, a stage/T.V.    
 room and a medical block.             
 In one of the classrooms is a nursery,
 where 20 children attend in the       
 morning and a different 20 attend in  
 the afternoon.                        
 Our school is built on a square and in
 the centre is a play area with a sand 
 pit, adventure area and some rabbit   
 hutches.   We have a football pitch   
 and other grass areas and there is a  
 hard surfaced area with a climbing    
 frame and netball pitches. We have the
 local community hut in our playground.</content>
