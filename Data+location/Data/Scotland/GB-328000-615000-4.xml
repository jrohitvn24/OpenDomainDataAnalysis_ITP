		<title>04HISTORY - ETTRICK VALLEY.</title>
		<content>   East of the farm of Wardlaw is      
 Hopehouse, a shepherd's cottage on    
 Tushielaw, a row of three cottages    
 known locally as Needle Street - a    
 tailor had one of them and now a      
 caravan site is in the field that used
 to be Davie Moffat's cowgang and      
 Flockfield, once a small holding, is  
 now a pottery.  Built on the Tushie   
 Law are the ruins of Adam Scott's     
 Tower. He was a notorious border      
 reiver who was according to legend,   
 hanged on his own gallow's tree. The  
 remnants of the original Ettrick      
 Forest are the gnarled trees which    
 grow east of the tower and on the     
 Cacra Bank in Rankleburn.             
    Despite a lot of afforestation in  
 many parts, the chief industry in this
 little part of 'God's Vineyard' is    
 sheep farming.
