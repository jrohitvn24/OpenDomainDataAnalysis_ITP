		<content>{Seamill}is too{small}to have its own  
 school so all{primary school children 
 age four and a half to twelve years   
 have to{attend}the primary school in  
{West Kilbride.}When children get past 
 primary school age they have to get   
 the bus at one of the stops and travel
 to one of three secondary schools.    
 One is in Largs and two are in        
 Ardrossan which is five miles away.   
 They are Ardrossan Academy and St.    
 Andrews Academy.                      
{ The primary school has more children 
{starting each year.}Separate class    
 numbers have been getting bigger. It  
 has generally been decided that each  
 class should have a limit of thirty   
 three pupils but there are sometimes  
 more. As the numbers of new comers    
 increase each year it is possible that
 Seamill may get a school of its own.
