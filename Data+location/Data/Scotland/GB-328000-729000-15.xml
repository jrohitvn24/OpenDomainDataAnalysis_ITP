		<title>15LONGFORGAN - CHILDS DAY -</title>
		<content> My name is Jane and I am 10 years old.
 I woke up at 7.30 a.m. and dressed by 
 the fire downstairs. I had breakfast  
 and then washed and cleaned my teeth  
 and brushed my hair which is very     
 long. I walked to school and we did   
 maths and dictionary work and I also  
 had a shot on the computer. Lunch was 
 at 12.30 p.m. and I had hot-dogs and  
 orange juice at home. Back to school  
 for 1.30 p.m. and the afternoon went  
 very quickly. At playtime we played   
 skipping and one of the games was     
 called "one two three o'high". At 3.30
 p.m. we all went home. I did my       
 homework and watched Grange Hill on TV
 and had tea at 6.00 p.m. We had       
 chicken, runner beans and a new sauce 
 Mum had made. Dad and Mum and I had   
 tea together and it was delicious.Dad 
 works as a cartoonist in Dundee, and  
 after tea I practised piano.          </content>
