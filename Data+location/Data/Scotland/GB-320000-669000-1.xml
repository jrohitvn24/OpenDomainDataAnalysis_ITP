		<title>01S.W. EDINBURGH  INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>{ Our study area is located in         
 S.W.Edinburgh and is predominantly a  
 residential district.The houses       
 closest to the town centre were mainly
 built of local stone during the late  
 19th Century,but towards the fringe of
 the city there are 20th Century Local 
 Authority and private housing         
 estates.We were surprised to find so  
 much open space,some of which is being
 filled with small private housing     
 developments.Colinton Dell, for       
 example,is a peaceful,picturesque     
 place where people can                
 fish,paddle,picnic or stroll at       
 leisure.Other interesting features    
 include the Union Canal,which badly   
 requires to be cleaned up,Longstone   
 Bus Depot,Redford Barracks,Saughton   
 Park Gardens and Craighouse           
 Hospital.Our interviews included a    
 girl who escaped by boat from Vietnam.</content>
