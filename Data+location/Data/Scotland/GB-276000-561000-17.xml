		<content> Farms in this area are mostly dairy   
 farms. The breeds of cattle reared are
 Friesians and Ayrshires. In Summer the
 cattle eat grass. The farmers grow    
 more grass to make silage and hay to  
 feed the cattle over the Winter.      
 Cattle are sometimes fed on cattle    
 cake and brewers grain. A lot of      
 slurry and expensive fertiliser is    
 used to promote the growth of the     
 grass. Some cattle are fattened and   
 sold for their meat.                  
 Two examples of typical dairy farms   
 are "Leaths" owned by the McMiken     
 family, and "Upper Torrs", by the     
 Smith family.                         
 Unusually, for this area, there is a  
 farm "Meikle Knox", which specialises 
 in breeding and rearing pigs. This    
 farm also has a shop which sells a    
 variety of farm produce.
