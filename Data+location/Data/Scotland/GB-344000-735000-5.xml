		<content>     Although it is predominantly an   
 agricultural area, the latest census  
 indicated that only 14% of the working
 population in the Wellbank/Kellas     
 area were employed in agriculture, 79%
 in other jobs, and 6% unemployed.     
 This is indicative of a tendancy      
 throughout the area.                  
   Apart from agriculture, the main    
 local employers are two Haulage       
 Contractors, two                      
 Blacksmiths/Engineers,and one firm of 
 Coachbuilders.  The workforces        
 employed by these firms are quite     
 small (e.g. two firms employ 14 people
 each), and most of the people work    
 outside the area, mainly in Dundee.   
   With continuing mechanisation of    
 farm work there is little likelihood  
 that this trend will be reversed.
