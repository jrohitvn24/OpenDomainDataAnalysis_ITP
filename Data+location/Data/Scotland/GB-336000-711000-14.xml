		<title>14HILL OF TARVIT</title>
		<content>  The nature trail on the whole was fun
 to do because we got a lot of freedom 
 and trust put in us .We found out     
 about the lives of people gone by and 
 the wildlife around the gardens such  
 as{ladybirds,rooks,rabbits and roe    
{deer}(So I think).Our idea was to     
 show children how to act sensibly in  
 the countryside.The Treasure Trail    
 goes round the gardens of Hill of     
 Tarvit House.We looked for interesting
 features that were not obvious at a   
 glance.After a couple of minutes the  
 children relaxed and became more      
 interested in the trail.The children  
 also used the leaflets we made to     
 their best advantage.We learned about 
 the{Fife Hunt Ball in January 1930    
 by looking up the Dundee Courier and  
 interviewing a guest who attended the 
 Hunt Ball.
