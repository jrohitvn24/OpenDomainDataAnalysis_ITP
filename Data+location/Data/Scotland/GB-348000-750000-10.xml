 Rescobie loch is one of three lochs of
 glacial origin in the{LANDSCAPE}of the
 area. The loch is 1.5 km long and 0.5 
 km wide. In depth it ranges from 1_5 m
 but during the summer evaporation may 
 reduce this level.                    
 Under the loch is the{HISTORICAL SITE}
 of an old{CASTLE.}This was called     
 'Barnsdale' which means 'Valley of the
 Banes'. This name could be connected  
 with a{LOCAL MYTH}that states that    
 King Donald VII (Donald Bane) who was 
 the brother of Malcolm Canmore, died  
 there in confinement in 1097. Some say
 he was put to death by his nephew King
 Elgar.
