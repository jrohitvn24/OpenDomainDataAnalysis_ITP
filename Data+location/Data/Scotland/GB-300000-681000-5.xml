		<title>05BO'NESS  INDUSTRY - ENERGY</title>
		<content> People who live in this area are      
 dependant on energy for a livlihood as
 many are employed by British Petroleum
 in the oil industry at Grangemouth.   
 Coal mining was another source of     
 employment as Bo'ness was a coal      
 mining town. There are no coal mines  
 in Bo'ness now. Kinneil Pit to the    
 west of this area (GR 9881) closed    
 down in 1983. There used to be lots of
 mines in Bo'ness. St.Mary's School is 
 built of light weight material because
 there is a mine shaft underneath it.  
 One house in Grangepans had to be     
 demolished because it subsided due to 
 being built on top of a mine.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
