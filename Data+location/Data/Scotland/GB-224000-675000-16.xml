		<content> THIS IS A VERY HILLY AREA WITH THE    
 ONLY FLAT LAND BEING ON RAISED BEACHES
 ALONG THE SOUTH BANK OF THE RIVER     
 CLYDE. THE GOUROCK END IS VERY HILLY  
 AND MOST OF THE SLOPES ARE NOW BUILT  
 ON,ALTHOUGH SOME REMAIN AS MOORLAND OR
 WOODLAND. ONE SPECIAL FEATURE IS TOWER
 HILL,WHICH IS ABOUT 100m HIGH AND IS  
 MADE OF VOLCANIC ROCK. ON ONE ROAD THE
 GRADIENT IS 1:3 AND IS EXTREMELY      
 DIFFICULT FOR CARS.ON THE GREENOCK    
 SIDE THE RAISED BEACH STRETCHES       
 FURTHER INLAND AND IS COMPLETELY      
 BUILT UP. THE LYLE HILL AFFORDS AN    
 EXCELLENT VIEWPOINT OVER THE RIVER    
 CLYDE TO THE ARGYLE HILLS WHICH MARK  
 THE START OF THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS.  
 THIS IS AN ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL SENIC 
 AREA.
