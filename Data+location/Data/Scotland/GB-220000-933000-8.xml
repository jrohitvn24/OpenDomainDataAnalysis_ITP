		<title>08Working on the Kylesku ferry</title>
		<content>  My Grandfather worked on the ferry   
 from 1954 until 1984 when the ferry   
 stopped. As assistant ferryman he     
 worked seven days a week, 12 hours a  
 day in summer. Conditions improved    
 slightly in 1957 when a second        
 assistant ferryman was employed for   
 the summer months only. When the ferry
 finished, a crew of six was required. 
  During August 1957, 2,536 cars used  
 the ferry, compared with 19,148 cars  
 in August 1973. However by that time, 
 two ferries were in use. With the     
 increase in the price of petrol and   
 charges being introduced, the numbers 
 fell so that in 1982, only 12,188 cars
 crossed in the same month.            
  Winter was much quieter with very few
 crossings being made.                 
  My Grandfather really enjoyed his    
 work but says,"Thirty years sailing   
 the same waters is enough for anyone."</content>
