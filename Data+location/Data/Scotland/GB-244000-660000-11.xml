		<content> Tenants in the Rivers area of Foxbar  
 are fighting for safe play areas for  
 their children. They are holding a    
 meeting at the end of June in St      
 Paul's Primary School in Foxbar and   
 councillor Olga Clayton, convener of  
 the district council Arts and Leisure 
 Committee, and Mr Ian McAdam, director
 of Leisure and Recreation, have been  
 invited to attend.                    
 The tenants are arguing that the small
 park in the area is ill-equipped and  
 dangerous because the swings and the  
 roundabout are built on concrete.     
 One of the tenants who spoke to us    
 about the situation described the play
 facilities for the children of Foxbar 
 as 'a disgrace'.                      
 Other news is that Andrew McGeoch of  
 St Aelreds H.S. has won a prize in Wm.
 Grants and Sons painting competition.
