		<content> There are three churches in the area. 
 They are the Free Church of Scotland, 
 the Free Presbyterian Church of       
 Scotland and the Church of Scotland,  
 which is also known as the Established
 Church. The Church of Scotland was    
 built in 1826, by Thomas Telford. The 
 Free Church of Scotland was built in  
 the late 1840's. The Free Presbyterian
 Church was built in the 1890's, by the
 Beaton family, who still own the land 
 on which it is situated. The Church of
 Scotland was the first church to be   
 built since Trumpan Church, which was 
 burned down as a result of a clan     
 feud, in 1578. All the churches in the
 area do not have a resident minister. 
 All our ministers, who live in        
 Dunvegan, also serve the parishes of  
 Dunvegan and Glendale.
