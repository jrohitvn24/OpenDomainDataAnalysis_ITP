		<title>11GAMES WE PLAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  The games I enjoy playing in school  
 at playtimes are netball, skipping &amp;  
 football. I think these games are good
 fun. We have a netball pitch and a    
 football pitch marked out on two of   
 the four school fields. One day we    
 play football and the next we play net
 ball. The boys are practising for the 
 Rural Schools Tournament at Bells     
 Sports Centre in Perth &amp; we practice  
 for the Netball Tournament but at     
 school we play together and against   
 each other for practice. In netball   
 there are 7 players in each team but  
 in football you can either have 5 or  
 11 players. It is 5 a side football   
 that we play. I also enjoy skipping, I
 can skip forwards and backwards.I like
 skipping when two people hold the ends
 of the rope and turn it while a line  
 of us skip 2 and out building up to 10
 and out,when only 2 could still be in.</content>
