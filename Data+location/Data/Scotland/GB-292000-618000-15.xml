		<title>15Changes in Crawford.</title>
		<content> We tried to find out a little of what 
 Crawford was like in the past.We spoke
 to Mrs Brown,who has lived in Crawford
 for 80 years and Mrs Devlin ,who has  
 lived here for 75 years.They both went
 to the village school and it has      
 changed greatly since then.           
 Crawford used to be very popular for  
 holidays.People came by train to golf 
 and fish.The village was very quite   
 then as there were very few cars or   
 lorries.                              
 During the Second World War 8000      
 Polish Soldiers camped at Stoneyburn  
 Farm and the surrounding farms.This   
 made Crawford a very busy place.      
 Both Mrs Devlin and Mrs Brown have    
 seen great changes over the years,    
 although not always for the better.
