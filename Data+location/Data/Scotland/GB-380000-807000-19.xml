		<title>19Impressions of Westhill cont</title>
		<content> Westhill is a nice place in which to  
 live but there is not enough for the  
 young people to do. It would be better
 if there were a swimming pool and a   
 sports arena.The disco's ,organised by
 the Community Centre , are good but   
 there is not enough of them.          
 There is a good selection of shops    
 though it would be improved by a      
 record shop and a sports wear shop.   
 There should be a large play field for
 small children.                       
 A number of the adults would also like
 a bookmakers.                         
 Older children would like a cafe to go
 to and listen to records whilst they  
 eat snacks ( all the eating places    
 already here are very expensive ).Even
 the chip shop is dear, and young      
 people can't stay in it if it is wet.
