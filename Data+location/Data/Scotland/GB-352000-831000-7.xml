		<content> NJ522321 -{THE VILLAGE OF GARTLY}lies 
 alongside the River Bogie between the 
 A97 and the railway. It is roughly    
 L-shaped,with the base running from   
 the A97 across the railway (Station   
 Road),and the back (Park Lane) running
 vaguely parallel to the main road etc.
 Station Rd contains the oldest houses.
 Over the level crossing are 5 houses  
 (4 of them holiday homes) and 2 other 
 private houses in their own grounds.  
 Station Road continues up Tor Hill and
 4 miles on, meets the A96(T) road at  
 Slioch crossroads.                    
 Park Lane contains,on the side further
 from the river, a row and semi-circle 
 of 20 terraced and semi-detached      
 Council houses,some of which are now  
 privately owned,a block of 4          
 old-folks'houses(2 up,2 down)and the  
 school house rented meantime to       
 someone other than the Head Teacher.  </content>
