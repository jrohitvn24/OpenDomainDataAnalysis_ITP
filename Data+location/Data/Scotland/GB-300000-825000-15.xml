		<content>   Holmhill was opened in{April 1983,  
 but the official opening was on       
 October 13th 1983 by{Prince Charles.  
 He unveiled a plaque and planted a    
 tree in the garden. Afterwards he     
 looked around Holmhill and had tea    
 with the guests.                      
   Holmhill is a home for people with  
{Multiple Sclerosis}which is a disease 
 when the spinal cord is eaten away.   
   Visitors go on outings to the woods,
 Lochindorb, the River Spey and        
 sometimes they go up the Cairngorms.  
 It costs{Â£230 per fortnight,}which    
 covers{nursing}as well as full        
 accomodation.                         
   For meals they have no special menu.
 The two cooks stick to vegetable fats 
 because animal fats are bad for them. 
 They get their food from a firm in    
 Inverness and from Grantown.
