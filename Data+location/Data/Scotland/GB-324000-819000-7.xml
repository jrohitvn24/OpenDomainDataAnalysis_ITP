		<title>07BRAES HOUSING AND HEALTH</title>
		<content>   In the past almost all the houses in
 the Braes were either farms or crofts.
 With the  amalgamation of small crofts
 into  larger  units many houses became
 derelict. Some  have  now been  bought
 and renovated as holiday  accomodation
 while others are just heaps  of stones
 with a rowan  tree  close  by. In  the
 1970's  the  distillery was built with
 three houses for management and at the
 same time the Council built six houses
 mainly for the workforce.             
   The doctor  and  district nurse from
 either  Tomintoul or Glenlivet provide
 very good medical care, always willing
 to make  house  calls  when necessary.
 Serious cases are  sent to hospital in
 Elgin  or   Aberdeen.   Aberlour   and
 Dufftown  have  small cottage hospital
 mainly  for  geriatric  care  but  the
 nearest   maternity   hospital  is  in
 Elgin.                                </content>
