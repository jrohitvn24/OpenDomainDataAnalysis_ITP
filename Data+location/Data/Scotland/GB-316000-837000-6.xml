		<content> The Parish of Inveravon has one Church
 of Scotland church to which most of   
 the people belong.Others worship at   
 churches of their own denomination in 
 neighbouring districts.While adults   
 are attending  the weekly service the 
 children attend Sunday School in the  
 vestry of the church.                 
    The church occupies a site which   
 has been in religious use for many    
 centuries, perhaps from as early  as  
 the 6th Century.In the 13th Century   
 the Pre-Reformation church of St.     
 Peter was built.Apparently it was so  
 beautiful that a local name,          
 Belleheiglash, is probably derived    
 from both the Gaelic and French for   
 "beautiful church".                   
     After the Reformation,that church 
 was used for Protestant worship but   
 was eventually replaced.The present   
 church was built in 1806.             </content>
