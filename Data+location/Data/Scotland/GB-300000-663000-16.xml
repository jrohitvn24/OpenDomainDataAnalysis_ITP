		<content> The library is a feature of West      
 Calder and sits at the edge of the    
 village.If you are in need of any     
 information you can get it from the   
 library.It opened on the 30th July    
 1903 and now has approximately 10000  
 books.Information and other books can 
 be brought in from other libraries if 
 needed.Limefield House was once the   
 home of James Young but is now an old 
 folks home.Another feature of the     
 village is the co-op's clock.It was   
 laid on the 10th of June 1884 by Sir  
 William Maxwell then the president of 
 the S.C.W.S Ltd.The clock was on the  
 old co-op and was removed when it was 
 knocked down.In 1983 it was put up on 
 its own and now stands in the village 
 square.The event of its original      
 erection was talked of for many years.
