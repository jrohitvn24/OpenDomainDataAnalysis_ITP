		<title>01OUR AREA</title>
		<content> Our block is mostly farmland.The White
 Cart Water runs through it.The main   
 settlement is the village of Eaglesham
 with two outlying hamlets _Millhall   
 and Jackton.The land slopes up towards
 the top of the village_ altitude 210m.
 Eaglesham has a population of 3163,and
 lies 10 miles from Glasgow and 5 miles
 from the new town of East Kilbride.The
 farms round about are mainly dairy    
 farms.Eaglesham is now a dormitory    
 with no industry.The only employment  
 is in shops or farm work.Most people  
 work in Glasgow and many are          
 representatives and therefore mobile. 
 Eaglesham is still growing.There has  
 been a great deal of new building in  
 the private sector and an influx of   
 new people with a goodly number of    
 professionals and executives.Our      
 rainfall is 1428mm stored in a        
 reservoir and filter station.         </content>
