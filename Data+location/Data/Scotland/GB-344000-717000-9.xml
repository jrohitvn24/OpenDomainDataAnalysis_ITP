		<content> In this part, woodland is not an      
 important feature of the landscape,   
 most of which consists of large       
 cultivated fields.  Near Wester       
 Kincaple, there is a small area of    
 deciduous wood. Elsewhere there were a
 few copses and some shelter belts of  
 coniferous. Most of the large trees   
 are clusterd round farm houses.       
 Especially noticeable are those in the
 ground of Kincaple House where many   
 trees planted 150 years ago are about 
 30m high. Beech, sycomore, and some   
 exotic conifers are the main species. 
 there is little new planting to       
 replace the older trees; it seems that
 this countryside will become less     
 wooded in future.
