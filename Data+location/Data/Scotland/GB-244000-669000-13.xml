		<title>13THE CREST HOTEL IN ERSKINE</title>
		<content> The Crest Hotel opened in 1971.  There
 are eight floors altogether, six of   
 which are occupied by 200 bedrooms.   
 There is one restaurant with 200 seats
 and one function room which can be    
 divided into three.  The hotel employs
 a staff of approximately 140.  There  
 are many facilities available to      
 guests which include a shop, bar and  
 an exercise room. Weddings,           
 conferences and exhibitions are just  
 some of the functions which take place
 in the hotel throughout the year.  The
 hotel is popular with foreign guests  
 in the summer months, but it has      
 mainly British guests in the winter.  
 It is very well situated, near the    
 Erskine Bridge, overlooking the River 
 Clyde. It is a very good starting     
 point for visitors arriving at Glasgow
 Airport and making their way up to the
 north of Scotland.                    </content>
