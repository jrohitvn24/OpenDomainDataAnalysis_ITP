		<content> In March 1930 an unlucky Aberdeen     
 based trawler the Bendoran ran aground
 on the Ve Skerries.All the crew was   
 lost because the weather was too bad  
 for any boat to reach them _ despite  
 gallant efforts by the crew of the    
 Smiling Morn.(At this time the nearest
 lifeboat was based in Orkney.)        
   By 1933 a lifeboat (the KTJS) was   
 based at Aith and she went to the aid 
 of the Highcliffe in 1940 when she ran
 aground on Forewick Holm.All the crew 
 was saved as was the crew of the      
 Aberdeen trawler Juniper in 1967.     
   In 1977 the Eleanor Viking,another  
 Aberdeen based trawler ran aground on 
 the Ve Skerries,all the men were saved
 by helicopter,while a Nimrod aircraft 
 stood by to light up the area.        
   If the technology of 1985 was around
 in the 30's maybe the men of the      
 Bendoran would still be alive today.  </content>
