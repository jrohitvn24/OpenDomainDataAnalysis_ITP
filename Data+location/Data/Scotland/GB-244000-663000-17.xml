 1982 it left 3000 people unemployed   
 directly and a thousand more in other 
 industries on part time work.

 redevelopment in Linwood. The former  
 Talbot Car PLant has been split into  
 smaller factory units, and let at     
 reduced rates. This complex is known  
 as{JUNCTION 29}(referring to the      
 nearby motorway junction). The main   
 user is{BRITOIL}who have taken over   
 the office accommodation.Another main 
 user is{REID GEAR}. There is also a   
 company called{AIR PARK}offering a    
 secure parking service to business men
 using{Glasgow Airport}. In 1983 work  
 started on the development of small   
 modern factory units beside St        
 Brendan's High School. They employ    
 around 150 people and are a{Scottish  
{Development Agency}project.           </content>
