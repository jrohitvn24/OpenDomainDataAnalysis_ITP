		<title>07CLUBS IN SANDHEAD</title>
		<content> by Ian Rowan aged 12                  
    For such a small village, Sandhead 
 has a lot of clubs. Some meet in the  
 summer, some in the winter and some   
 throughout the year. Some clubs are   
 for adults, some for all ages, and    
 some for children. For adults we have 
 the Churhwomen's Guild and the Darts  
 and Dominoes Club. From about 9 years 
 old you can join the Bowling, Tennis  
 and Badminton Clubs. If you are still 
 at school you can be a Brownie, Cub,  
 Scout, or even as a young adult you   
 may be a Venture Scout. My Mum coaches
 the wee ones at the Tennis Club. It   
 costs Â£1 to be a member and 20p for   
 each game you play. You need to have  
 your own racket and balls. The Bowling
 Club charge Â£12 to join and 25p each  
 night you attend. They are building a 
 new clubhouse with a bar, snooker     
 table, and indoor bowling mats.       </content>
