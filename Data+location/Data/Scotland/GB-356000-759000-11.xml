		<title>11YOUTH CULTURES IN BRECHIN</title>
		<content> Over the last few years Brechin has   
 seen the emergence of many youth      
 sub-cultures, mainly in the form of   
 gangs of teenage boys. The main       
 groupings at present are the "Casuals"
 who are identified by being           
 well-dressed in expensive shoes,      
 trousers and sweaters. Dress is also  
 the symbol of two other boy gangs. The
 "Mods" wear large anoraks decorated   
 with Union Jacks and the "Bikers" wear
 motorcycle leathers. Other groups are 
 linked together by common habits      
 rather than clothing. The             
 "Breakdancers" all specialise in the  
 latest dancing craze and the "Bundies"
 are a group from the poorer part of   
 the town who tatoo their arms. At a   
 certain stage of emotional development
 many youths seem to need to belong to 
 a group through which they express    
 their personality.                    </content>
