		<content> Hayfield Riding School, Aberdeen.     
                                       
 Hayfield Riding School was established
 in 1957 and has had 3 owners, the     
 present owners being the Crawford     
 family. There is a large outdoor area 
 and 2 indoor schools which are in use 
 throughout the winter. There are 65   
 ponies and horses and the school can  
 cater for 240 children in a week with 
 Tuesday reserved for the disabled and 
 handicapped. Several people have their
 horses stabled at the school and train
 there to take part in show jumping    
 competitions all over the country.    
 Some of the older, more experienced   
 horses have had unusual jobs such as  
 Jackie who pulled Cinderella's coach  
 in the pantomime in His Majesty's     
 theatre and Calendar who has appeared 
 with Stanley Baxter.
