		<content> At 9o'clock on Friday 21st June 1985 a
 bus with children and parents aboard  
 left Glenisla School for the annual   
 school outing. Blair Drummond Safari  
 Park was to be our destination. It was
 very wet when we left and remained so 
 for the rest of the day! The bus drove
 round the safari park when we arrived 
 and we saw some lions, tigers, deer   
 and buffaloes. We had to look hard to 
 find them as they were doing the      
 sensible thing and sheltering from the
 rain. Later we were allowed to wander 
 by ourselves in the enclosed area. We 
 played on the motorbikes and moon     
 buggies, watched films on Cinema 180  
 and spent our money on ice cream and  
 sweets. We bought presents from the   
 souvenir shop. The astroglide, a giant
 chute, was closed as it was wet and   
 this was a disappontment.
