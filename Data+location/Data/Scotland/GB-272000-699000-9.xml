 "Someone is chosen to be hit. Then    
 you choose the number you will count  
 up to. The person who is hit will     
 count up to that number while the     
 others hide. When they have finished  
 counting they look for the others. If 
 those who were hiding all get Delta   
 Free-all. Then the person who was hit 
 has to be hit again. If the person who
 is hit catches anybody by saying Delta
 1-2-3 then the first person caught is 
 hit next time." KIRSTEN

   "In this game one person goes it and
 the others run around. The person who 
 is it chases the others. If he catches
 anyone he says "TIG". The person      
 caught becomes "IT". There is also a  
 den where anyone not it can go and be 
 safe." FRASER
