		<content>{Ladybank has an open-air station with 
{a regular service to two main cities. 
{It has a modern signal system         
{controlled from Edinburgh.}These      
 trains{run hourly.}We have a much{less
{regular service to Perth with a single
{line.}There used to be another line to
 Kinross which passed through many     
 towns like ours. This line was closed.
{Every Friday a privately owned train  
{comes into the sidings of the         
{junction.}It is called the{Royal      
{Scotsman.}The carriages can be hauled 
 by steam or diesel. The station now   
 employs  only three people. The sheds,
 once busy, now only hold coal and     
 rubbish. Although Ladybank workshops  
 are dead the junction very quiet,     
{there are still 18 or 19 trains       
{stopping compared with the few        
{stopping when Ladybank was a major    
{junction.                             </content>
