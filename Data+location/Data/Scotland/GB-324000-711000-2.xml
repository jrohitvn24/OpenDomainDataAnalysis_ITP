		<content> The main features of the physical     
 geography of this part of N.E. Fife   
 are the gently rounded hills sloping  
 down to the wide , flat valley floor  
 or strath through which runs the River
 Eden .The altitude range is 118       
 metres, the highest point being in the
 north on Weddersbie Hill(156m) and the
 lowest(38m) in the south on the valley
 floor. The area has a south_south_east
 aspect.The soil in general is deep and
 fertile, especially in the valley ,   
 but there are a few rock outcrops     
 occurring in the northern part of the 
 map. The area is mostly well drained, 
 but on the flatter land in the south, 
 closer to the river, there are some   
 areas of marsh. In the north on       
 Weddersbie Hill there is a small loch 
 called Red Myre.
