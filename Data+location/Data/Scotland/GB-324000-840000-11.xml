		<title>11A Day in Katherine's Life.</title>
		<content> I live beside the main street in      
 Aberlour. As I'm waking up, I hear the
 cars and lorries as they rumble over  
 the man-hole covers in the middle of  
 the road.                             
 I get up, put on my school uniform,   
 and go downstairs to have my          
 breakfast. I take a strawberry yoghurt
 out of the fridge and sit down to eat 
 it.                                   
 Today, when we get to school we begin 
 with Art. We draw doors and paint them
 with different textures. We then do   
 some Maths till break. At break, we go
 to the tucky and then go out to play  
 Donkey. About 6 of us throw a ball    
 about. Anyone who drops it, gets a    
 letter of Donkey. First to get the    
 whole word is out. I go home for      
 lunch. For tea I have pizza and chips.
 I play with Leigh, swinging on a tree.
 I watch T.V. and go to bed about 11.  </content>
