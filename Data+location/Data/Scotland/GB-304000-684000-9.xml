		<title>09CAIRNEYHILL CENTRE</title>
		<content> Cairneyhill Primary School ( page 8 ) 
 was purpose built to be not only a    
 school, but to also have the          
 facilities which were lacking in the  
 rapidly growing village of            
 Cairneyhill. The Community wing of the
 school is in almost constant use by   
 the villagers, and a survey revealed  
 that few Cairneyhill residents do not 
 use the facilities. A large range of  
 activities are available, including   
 mother and toddler groups, an old     
 folks' club, discos, roller skating,  
 and a variety of sports including     
 pool, short tennis, karate, bowls and 
 badminton. The centre also provides a 
 cafe for its patrons, and the school  
 grounds are used too for visits from  
 the mobile clinic.                    
    The Centre functions as a meeting  
 place for the whole village, acting as
 a modern day village hall.            </content>
