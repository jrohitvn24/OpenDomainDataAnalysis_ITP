 on the East mainland of Orkney.  Holm 
 Sound was until world war two one of  
 the entrances to the naval anchorage  
 of Scapa Flow.  This entrance was     
 blocked off by the construction of the
 Churchhill Barriers between Holm and  
 Burray.  Italian prisioners were used 
 for the construction and they were    
 responsible for the building of the   
 Italion chapel on Lamb Holm, by       
 converting one of the prision huts,   
 this is now preserved and is a popular
 tourist attraction. A salmon farm is  
 under construction on Lamb Holm served
 by fish pens 1/4 of shore.  the area  
 of Holm is intensively farmed         
 grassland for cattle and some sheep.  
 the area is rich with wildlife, Holm  
 Sound is popular for seals and is     
 visited by many sea birds.  It is also
 a good place for lobster fishing.     </content>
