		<title>19A Schoolgirl's day</title>
		<content> I always get up at 8.00am except on   
 Saturdays and Sundays.For my breakfast
 I have Rice Krispies or toast and tea.
 I go to school by bus. School starts  
 at  9.30 and we usually do  maths     
 first. At break time I have 30p for my
 tuck and I buy 2 bags of crisps and   
 biscuits.I get juice from my mum.     
 After break we do language and some   
 other subjects. Between 1.00 and 1.45 
 I have a packed lunch of sandwiches   
 juice, yogurt, biscuits and crisps or 
 chocolate.In the afternoon we might   
 get art or netball or football        
 practice. When I go home at 3.30 I    
 change my clothes then go up and meet 
 my sister from her work. After my tea 
 I do the dishes, my homework, and     
 watch television before going to bed  
 at 10.00pm.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
