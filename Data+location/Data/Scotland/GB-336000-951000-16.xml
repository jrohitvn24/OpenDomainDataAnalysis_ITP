		<title>16Wick Choral Society</title>
		<content> Wick has had a Choral Society for     
 several years. A Choral Society       
 differs from a choir in that it       
 performs choral works as opposed to   
 part-songs. Choral Works are works    
 composed exclusively for Choral       
 Societies, whereas, part-songs are    
 usually arrangements of unison songs, 
 e.g. "The Red Red Robin", arranged for
 four different voices, i.e. Soprano,  
 Alto, Tenor, Bass. On Saturday 11th   
 May,1985, the Wick Choral Society     
 performed a selection of choral works 
 in the Parish Church, Wick. The       
 programme consisted of "Zadok The     
 Priest" composed by Handel, Vivaldis  
 "Gloria", and Schuberts Mass in G. The
 soloists for this performance were    
 Carol-Anne Petherick - Soprano, Janice
 Bruce - Alto, Stuart Rathie - Tenor   
 and Charles Sinclair - Bass. The      
 musical director was Kyle Campbell.   </content>
