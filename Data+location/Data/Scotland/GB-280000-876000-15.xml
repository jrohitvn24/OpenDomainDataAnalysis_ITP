		<title>15Recreation areas in Fearn.</title>
		<content> In our area we have two swingparks and
 a football pitch.One of the swingparks
 is made of wood.It has a swing with a 
 tyre on it.There is a net that you can
 climb,a see-saw and a pole that you   
 can climb.                            
 The other park we have is beside the  
 football pitch.It has two swings for  
 older children and two swings for     
 infants.There is a climbing frame that
 is supposed to be a like a fire       
 engine.There is a little slide but    
 that doesn't work very well.Also there
 is a roundabout,but yiu have to push  
 very hard to get it going.An obstacle 
 course is alongside the pitch.The     
 football pitch is used for all sorts  
 of things e.g.our school sports and by
 the local football team.
