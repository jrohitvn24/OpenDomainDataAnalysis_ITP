		<title>05Garvald Farms</title>
		<content> The main farms in the area are Baro,  
 (Carfrae &amp; Danskine run as one unit)  
 Garvald Mains, Nunraw, Stoneypath     
 Tower, (Tanderlane incorporating      
 Garvald Grange, which is run as a     
 small pony farm) and snawdon. Most of 
 the land lies between 400' and 1300'  
 in the hillfoot area of the           
 Lammermuirs. Much of the underlying   
 rock is old red sandstone, but it is  
 often overlaid with glacial gravels   
 which although stoney is well drained 
 and productive.  The acreage of the   
 farms is big, ranging from 250 to 1500
 acres.  The land is highly cultivated-
 steep brae faces are sown in grass    
 using crawler type machines.  Many    
 fences between fields have been       
 removed and the gates widened to allow
 the most modern machinery to be used. 
 However, perimiter stone walls have   
 been retained where possible.         </content>
