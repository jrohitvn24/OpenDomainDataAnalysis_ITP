		<title>07LIFE IN LIVINGSTON</title>
		<content> My name is Graeme Mearns. I have lived
 in{Livingston}for four years. I used  
 to live in{Edinburgh.}The reason we   
 moved out here was because of the     
 violence caused by 'punks' and 'mods'.
 Not only that, my mum liked the houses
 and my dad had a job out here.        
 There are more games and activities   
 for children and adults in Livingston.
 For instance the B.M.X. track in      
 Staunton Rise, where people can amuse 
 themselves by trying to conquer the   
 obstacles. There is also a pond where 
 people can catch frogs and newts. On  
 Monday there is a Family Night at the 
{James Young High School}where whole   
 families can go and enjoy themselves  
 with a variety of fun games.          
 I enjoy living in Livingston better   
 than I did in Edinburgh.
