		<title>17CONCERN FOR FUTURE PLANS</title>
		<content>    Mr Graeme McLean of Ballumbie Farm 
 has outline plans for a development   
 which includes a supermarket,a DIY    
 centre,a sports hall, a petrol        
 station, a football pitch and a BMX   
 cycling park.Mr McLean's plans for    
 the development is a good thing but   
 there have been many objections. Local
 people feel that it would encourage   
 graffiti,litter and drunks. Others    
 said that there had been a lack of    
 leisure and sports centres.Most of the
 objections came from outwith the      
 Whitfield housing scheme.The Scottish 
 Secretary would have the final say as 
 agricultural land is involved.It could
 be that there will be a public inquiry
 over the development.
