		<title>11RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS</title>
		<content> In the area of study there are many   
 churches of different denominations.  
 In Casselbank Street, off Leith Walk  
 three denominations are to be found - 
 Baptist, Free Church and Pentecostal. 
 In Sheriff Brae  there is now a Sikh  
 Temple in a building which was        
 formerly a Church of Scotland.  In    
 Leith in the Kirkgate, we see South   
 Leith Parish Church as one of the     
 oldest churches in the area.  Their   
 church hall now stands on the site of 
 the former St. Andrew's Church.  In   
 Junction Street there is a Methodist  
 Church, part of which is up for sale, 
 as well as a Church of Scotland.  The 
 United Free Church, also presbyterian,
 is to be found in Bangor Road.        
 There is evidence of churches being   
 closed;e.g. St Ninian's, Ferry Road,  
 or amalgamated - Junction Road church 
 has joined with St. Thomas'.          </content>
