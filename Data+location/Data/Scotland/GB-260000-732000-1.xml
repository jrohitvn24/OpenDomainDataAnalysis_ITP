		<content> More than half the area is rough      
 grazing land which rises from 100m to 
 the loch shore to the pecipitous      
 mountain, Greag Ghablu 637m in sq 12. 
 The western side and the north fringe 
 are thickly wooded and there is some  
 reafforestation. Nearly all northern  
 edge of area is covered by Loch Tay.  
 Only road on the south side of loch   
 crosses the area through sqs5,2,3,4,A 
 broad stream, Allt Breaclaict runs    
 north through Sqs 9,10 and 6 into loch
 in sq 2. where there is a ruined      
 croft. On the loch shore at Fiddlers  
 Bay is a holiday home.  The only other
 habitation is the Edinburgh University
 Field Centre in sq5. Built in 1968    
 this is primarily a centre for outdoor
 sports, and besides it in a small     
 inlet is a 200yr old harbour which the
 Centre uses.                          
                                       </content>
