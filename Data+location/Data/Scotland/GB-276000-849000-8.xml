		<title>08THE CUBS JUMBLE SALE</title>
		<content> My name is Ewan.When I was seven I    
 joined the cubs.Cubs were started to  
 teach boys ways of looking after      
 themselves out of doors.We learn      
 knotting and make fires to cook our   
 food and sometimes sleep in           
 tents.Occasionally we need to raise   
 money for funds and we have a jumble  
 sale.I'll tell you about it.          
  Cubs collect old clothes,books,china,
 and things people no longer need.We   
 set out the jumble on tables in the   
 village hall and then put big notices 
 in the village telling the date of the
 sale.On sale day people queue up      
 outside.We charge 20p entrance.Cubs   
 and other helpers are waiting to      
 serve.Sales can be exciting because   
 there are lots of people anxious to   
 buy things.I get quite dirty helping  
 at jumble sales and afterwards need a 
 hot bath.                             </content>
