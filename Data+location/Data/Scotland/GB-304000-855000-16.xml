		<content> Blervie Castle was built about the end
 of the 14th century.Much of the castle
 was demolished and the stones were    
 used for the present mansion.The      
 castle is now represented by the 5    
 storey tower which commands a view    
 over 7 counties. There is a war       
 memorial which was erected in 1919 and
 contains 11 names of soldiers killed  
 in the Great war and 20 who were      
 killed in the second World War. The   
 only ancient monumentin our area is   
 Templestones.Four stones form a       
 rectangle 3.4m by 2.7m. This  is      
 thought to be an ancient burial ground
 dating back to the stone age.         
 Lady Duff's tomb is situated on the   
 ground of Marcassie farm,Rafford.It is
 dated 1808 and contains the remains of
 the wife of the Honourable Lewis Duff 
 an important land owner in the area.
