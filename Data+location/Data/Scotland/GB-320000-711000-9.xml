		<title>09Auchtermuchty Festival</title>
		<content>   For many years Auchtermuchty        
 Festival was a{one day gala}for       
 children and the Festival as we know  
 it today started in{1981.}It takes    
 about a year to organise and includes{
{a pageant, dances, St. Serf's Market, 
{traditional music competitions and    
{concerts, and fun and games.}Funds are
 raised from occasional discos but     
 mainly from grants from local bodies. 
 The Festival lasts approximately{2    
{weeks}and is held in the first two    
 weeks of August.                      
   This year the theme of the pageant  
 is{France}because some French people  
 from a village called{Saint Sandoux}  
 are coming over for the Festival and  
 they will be staying with local       
 people. Everyone is looking forward to
 meeting and making friends with them, 
 and perhaps learning some French.
