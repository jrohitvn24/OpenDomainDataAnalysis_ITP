		<title>06FARMING: DEER.</title>
		<content> The deer farm at Beecraigs country    
 park was started in the mid seventies.
 It covers a large area of ground that 
 was used for rough grazing at one     
 time.                                 
 The deer in the park are from the     
 native Red deer.The herd has grown    
 from six calves into a herd of about a
 hundred hinds and the stags.          
 There are two full time workers at the
 farm. Mr Dickson is the ranger in     
 charge and his assistant is a youth   
 employed through the Youth Training   
 Scheme. At busy times of the year     
 other casual labour is employed.      
 The public is able to watch the deer  
 from a specially built walkway through
 the deer paddock,there are also       
 viewing platforms.                    
 The venison is sold to the public and 
 to hotels.                            
                                       </content>
