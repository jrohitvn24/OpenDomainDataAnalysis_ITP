		<title>19CEMETERIES - DUNURE</title>
		<content> Old Kirkbride Cemetery on former Drove
 road parallel to A719 has many ancient
 gravestones broken overturned and     
 overgrown.The oldest legible          
 inscription is 29 April 1779.The last 
 villager to be interred was Sunday    
 School Superintendent Wm Wilson in    
 1931.Most interesting relic is        
 headstone carved with 2 figures one   
 bearing shears the other an iron      
 (tailor's trade mark).Spring          
 transforms dereliction when masses of 
 daffodils cover this disused burial   
 ground.Dunure Cemetery on hillside    
 above A719 is meticulously maintained 
 and includes at rear 2 rows of second 
 World War graves.Buried there are     
 members of Royal Air Forces of Canada 
 (6)Australia(8)New Zealand(6) and     
 RAF(8)one unidentified.No Dunure      
 residents were war casualties 1939/45 
 though many served Navy/Merchant Navy.</content>
