		<content>  {Thurso}is a peaceful, friendly town 
 of about 10,000 people in the north of
 Scotland.                             
   There are many people from outside  
{Caithness}living in the town. Most    
 came when the United Kingdom{Atomic   
{Energy}Authority built an Atomic      
 Reactor at nearby{Dounreay.           
   An American communications base just
 west of Thurso also brought many      
 American servicemen to live in the    
 area.                                 
   The town is a mixture of old and new
 buildings. The old town was a fishing 
 and market centre built beside the    
 river and the sea. The river mouth    
 made a fine harbour for ships.        
   After the expansion of{Thurso}many  
 new shops and services were required. 
 There is now a fine shopping centre   
 with a pedestrian precinct and the    
 town has good leisure facilities.     </content>
