		<content>     My name is Andrew Hewitt, age 12. 
     I have two brothers and a sister  
 and my parents.                       
     Every Monday, Thursday and Sunday 
 I go to the swimming pool at Cardenden
 in Fife.                              
     Down Burleigh Road there is a     
 castle.  I sometimes go there.        
     For tea we usually have bread and 
 butter, spreading cheese, jam and tea.
 Sometimes we have sausages and chips, 
 mince or spaghetti or salad.          
     After tea I watch TV and some-    
 times do art at home. I was given some
 brushes and a palette of paints for my
 Christmas. My mum and my big brother  
 are good at art as well.              
     For the summer holidays we go to  
 the seaside or to my granny's.        
     My dad is going to France for a   
 few days because of his work.
