		<title>01LANDSCAPE: CUMMOCK VALLEY-1</title>
		<content> The Cummock Water rises among the     
 conifers of Kyle Forest and flows     
 south-west over moorland to the Doon  
 Valley about five kilometres away.    
 The bottom and sides of its valley are
 covered by glacial drift and littered 
 with erratics.  In this cover there   
 are several short deep gullies some   
 with streamlets tributary to the main 
 river.                                
                                       
 On the north edge of Dalmellington    
 there is a former meltwater channel   
 which now carries the B741 road as it 
 drops down from the village before    
 turning north-east towards New        
 Cumnock.
