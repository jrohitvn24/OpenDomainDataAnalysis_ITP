		<title>11TOURISM - ETTRICK VALLEY.</title>
		<content>    While farming remains the mainstay 
 of valley life,opportunities afforded 
 by the influx of holiday makers are   
 not overlooked.   While one           
 enterprising lady tempts the passing  
 motorist with 'Scone Teas' and also   
 offers bed and breakfast facilities,  
 another runs a small stable with pony 
 trekking facilities.  A caravan and   
 camping site is fully booked during   
 the summer months.  An old and        
 well-known Inn is situated in this    
 area and fishing and walking holidays 
 are popular.  The area is also ideal  
 for bird wstching and occasinally a   
 local farm has bed and breakfast      
 facilities.                           
    It is an area popular with tourists
 drawn by the peace and tranquility    
 which exists.
