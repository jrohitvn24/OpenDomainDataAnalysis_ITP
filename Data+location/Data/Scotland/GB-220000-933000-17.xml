		<title>17Fishing at Kylesku.</title>
		<content>  In 1984, a new fishing jetty was     
 built to boost employment in the area,
 but fishing at Kylesku was at its best
 in the 1920s. Then, it is said, it was
 possible to walk across the boats from
 one side of the loch to the other.    
  Rowing boats, sailing boats, boats   
 from as far south as the Isle of Man, 
 came to the waters of Loch Glen Coul  
 and Loch Glendhu to fish the herring. 
 The curing of the herring was done at 
 Kylestrome and most of the catch was  
 sent off by sea, although some went by
 cart to Bonar Bridge. Gradually,the   
 shoals of herring became smaller and  
 smaller until no boats came in.       
  In the late 1960s, The Highlands and 
 Islands Development Board began to    
 encourage prawn fishing in the area.  
 The prawn fishing has had its good    
 times and its bad. At present six     
 boats are fishing from the new jetty. </content>
