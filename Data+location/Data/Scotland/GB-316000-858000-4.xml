		<content>                                       
 Springburn fishfarm is owned by one   
 man who runs it by himself but        
 sometimes gets help from a schoolboy. 
 The farm was started in 1981.         
 The fish eggs come from Denmark       
 because they are the best.About 25,000
 eggs were hatched this year.In the    
 hatchery 150 litres of water per      
 minute are used from a spring with the
 temperature always at 6* Celcius.The  
 eggs usually hatch in May.The eggs are
 transported from Denmark to Glasgow by
 air.                                  
 The fish produced are rainbow,brown   
 and sea trout which are fed on pellets
 of soya with added vitimins.There are 
 approximately 50,000 fish altogether. 
 The preditors are herons,gulls and a  
 young osprey. The water for the farm  
 comes from the Black Burn.About 350   
 litres per minute are used.           </content>
