		<title>07THE TOWN LANDS</title>
		<content> The town lands of Selkirrk were       
 granted to the Royal Burgh by Charter.
 In the past it was necessary to patrol
 your boundaries to ensurre that the   
 the boundary markers had not been     
 moved.                                
 Some of these lands still belong to   
 the town and are tennanted by the     
 present residents. Recent attempts to 
 sell off the lands caused considerable
 bad feeling in the town and the       
 attempt was abandonded.  Instead      
 improvements were made to increase the
 productivity of the farms and thus    
 improve the returns for the town on   
 this asset.                           
 The profits from the farms go into the
 Common Good Fund which is used for    
 projects within the town for which    
 there is no other funding.
