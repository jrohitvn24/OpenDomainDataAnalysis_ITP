		<content> Agriculture is the biggest employer   
 here although quite a lot of people   
 work at the distillery. Three teachers
 are employed at the local school and  
 eight other teachers visit the school 
 during the year. Four other people are
 employed part-time at the school.     
 Other jobs in the area are provided by
 the Post Office, the shop, the pub,   
 the garage (which employs mini-bus    
 drivers as well as a mechanic) the    
 church and at Leith Hall where guides 
 as well as gardeners are employed.    
 Many people live in and around        
 Kennethmont but travel elsewhere to   
 work, mainly to Insch or Huntly but   
 some travel to Inverurie, Turriff or  
 Aberdeen. Other people who have their 
 homes here are away for longer periods
 as they work offshore on the North Sea
 oil-rigs.
