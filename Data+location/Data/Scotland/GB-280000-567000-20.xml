		<title>20A view to the future</title>
		<content> We thought it would be interesting to 
 let you people of the future know what
 we think the future will be like.     
 There is a threat of nuclear war, but 
 if this fails to happen we think      
 medical care will be more advanced and
 will progress in finding cures for    
 diseases such as cancer and heart     
 disease. The food we eat will be      
 healthier. We hope cigarettes and     
 alcohol will be banned but as the     
 government rely on their income, we   
 doubt that this will happen.          
 We see machines playing a bigger role 
 in school and factories possibly      
 replacing teachers and increasing     
 unemployment in general; this will    
 increase free time and probably lead  
 to even more vandalism. More factories
 will threaten the countryside. Rich   
 countries will carry on helping poor  
 but our fear of nuclear war is strong.</content>
