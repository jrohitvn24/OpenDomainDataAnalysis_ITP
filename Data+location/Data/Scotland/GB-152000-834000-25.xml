<title>25Raasay House 2011</title>
<content>

Raasay House was burnt down in 2009 days before it was to be re-opened. It had been done up and re-modelled. The house may have got hit by lightning one night in January that year and all over Raasy you could see the flames.&lt;br />&lt;br />It is now being done and we hope it will be as beautiful as it was all those years ago. Due to the fire, work will have to start all over again in building Raasay House. The work starts in September 2011. Raasay House is a Georgian Mansion and sits in a beautiful location looking to sea and over the Cuillins. It is owend by raasay Community and twenty five people work at Raasay House at the height of the summer. They run courses in crating, archery, absailing, rock climbing, gorge walking, kayaking, canoeing, sailing, peir jumping and coastering. It is a brilliant business on our island.&lt;br />&lt;br />Chloe P6 &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
