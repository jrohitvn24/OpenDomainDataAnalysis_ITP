		<title>13PETERHEAD HARBOUR</title>
		<content> In Peterhead there are 2 harbours;    
 North and South. The Breakwaters,     
 which were built by prisoners, help to
 break the strong force of water from  
 the North Sea. Peterhead is often     
 referred to as the 'Harbour of        
 Refuge'. Around the harbour can be    
 seen many jetties, 2 ice factories and
 a dry dock for repairing vessels.The  
 new Harbour Office is situated near to
 the site of the old fish market. The  
 new larger fish market is at the North
 Harbour. The Coastguard services are  
 based in Keith House near here.The    
 Lifeboat Station is on the outskirts  
 of the South Harbour.There is a large 
 bridge in the harbour which Peterhead 
 people call the 'Queenie'.There is    
 also a new road which was built on    
 reclaimed land.
