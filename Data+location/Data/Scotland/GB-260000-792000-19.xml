		<content> Most people in the community find     
 unskilled employment in the form of   
 domestic or driving jobs for women and
 general labouring for men.Skilled     
 trades must be learned outside the    
 village but most people achieve an    
 amazing amount of trade-skills to     
 maintain a high level of self -       
 sufficiency.35% of the male population
 work on the 4 farms,tending beef      
 cattle,hill sheep and working some    
 hectares of barley,grass and turnips  
 for silage and fodder.20% are in      
 forestry and estate work,15% are self 
 employed(fencing,gardening etc.)2% are
 crofters working their strip of       
 land.1% are game-keepers.The rest are 
 employed out with the given area or   
 are retired "settlers".80% of the     
 female population work in tourism.
