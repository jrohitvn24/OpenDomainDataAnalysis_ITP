		<content>     East Calder and Kirknewton area is
 in the Central Lowlands of Scotland 19
 km west of Edinburgh and 5km east of  
 Livingston New Town. It is in the West
 Lothian district of Lothian Region.   
  East Calder(66HA),the larger of the  
 two residential areas,is situated on  
 the A71.There is little industry today
 in the area.The population is growing 
 because of the convenience of routes  
 east and west(A71,M8),north and south 
 (M9,M90,A70).Private housing has grown
 as houses are cheaper to buy than in  
 Edinburgh.                            
  Kirknewton(22HA),lies to the east of 
 the block,on the railway line from    
 Glasgow to Edinburgh.                 
  The surrounding area is mostly dairy 
 farmland with some small holdings,    
 poultry farms and  piggeries.In the   
 the north west of the block is the    
 Almondell Country Park on the R/Almond</content>
