		<content> This area which is bordered by sea and
 by sea loch Eriholl, was cleared      
 during the Highland Clearances and now
 has only two inhabited houses,        
 Rispond Lodge and cottage.            
 The land is acid, thin, badly drained 
 with rocky outcrops. Grazing sheep    
 have prevented regeneration of old    
 woodland. There is only poor grazing  
 for crofters North Coutry Cheviot     
 sheep.                                
 Rispond Harbour (b) is used by lobster
 fishermen. Loch Eriboll is a deep and 
 sheltered anchorge but is used only   
 as occasional storm, holiday or naval 
 anchorage. Ceannateinne beach (c) is  
 popular with summer tourists. The old 
 fishing village on Bagh Uamh Dhadhaidh
 (D) is long deserted and a few houses 
 in ruins.                             
 The rocky island Cluimhrig (D) is     
 inhabited only by seals and seabirds. </content>
