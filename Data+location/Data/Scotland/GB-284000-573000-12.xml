		<title>12CRAIG'S LIFE IN SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>   This is what Craig Harvey does on   
 the farm where he lives. In June he   
 gets up at 7.30am, has his breakfast  
 and then feeds the calves. After that 
 he checks for couped sheep and then   
 has a cup of coffee at 11.00am.       
                                       
   After his coffee he starts silage   
 with his dad. To get the silage in    
 they have to cut it with a mower and  
 lift it with a forage harvester which 
 chops it up into little bits and puts 
 it into a trailer. The trailer takes  
 it to the farm, tips it and then it is
 buckraked up into the pit. It is then 
 rolled, covered up and left until the 
 winter when it is fed to the cows.    
                                       
   Craig has his dinner from 12.30 to  
 1.00pm. He would then work until      
 10.00pm if it was good weather. Then  
 he will have his supper and go to bed.</content>
