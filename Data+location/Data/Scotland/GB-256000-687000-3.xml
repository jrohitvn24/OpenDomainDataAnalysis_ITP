		<title>03Village Magazine: FINTRY</title>
		<content> The community's newspaper is called { 
{The Focus}and provides an outlet for  
 news not covered by commercial media. 
 It is sold widely, wherever any of us 
 Fintronians have settled.             
                                       
 Founded by the late Douglas Wilson in 
 1975, the quarto-sized Focus comes out
 4 times a year. It usually contains 24
 pages printed on a hand-operated      
 duplicating machine. Collation is by  
 moving round the table and the odd    
 glass of wine!                        
                                       
 Written and produced on a voluntary   
 basis, it costs just 20p which covers 
 the cost of production. Most people   
 take out an annual subscription, which
 enables the producers to plan ahead.  
                                       
 The Focus has also printed tickets and
 programmes for village productions.   </content>
