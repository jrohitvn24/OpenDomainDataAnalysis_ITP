		<title>17Old Thoughts of Moy</title>
		<content>  We came to Old Manse as a Mum, Dad   
 and baby family. My father had a job  
 as Estate Forester (one of three). Moy
 Hall was a beautiful castle then.     
 Every summer it was occupied by the   
 Mackintosh of Mackintosh and his lady 
 and staff. A piper awakened the house 
 at 6.30a.m.                           
  In these days we all gathered at the 
 Dairy at 4.50a.m. to collect our milk 
 pails. There was a real social        
 gathering at the Dairy.               
  We had a hall which was originally a 
 Reading Room where up to 1950 a       
 "Northern Chronicle" was delivered    
 every Wednesday for the community to  
 read. We could travel by train from   
 Moy Station which had the Post Office 
 in an annexe.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
