		<content> Cairnsmore of Fleet, a hill rising 711
 metres above sea level, situation:    
 Galloway Hills east of Newton Stewart.
 Lower land area largely maintained by 
 Forestry Commission specialising in   
 planting of coniferous trees for      
 commercial purposes.  Conifers nursed 
 for 2-3 years then planted on the hill
 growing on average 300cm per yr for   
 25-30 yrs.  Land area at higher level 
 used for hill sheep farming. Wild     
 fauna and flora is varied and         
 interesting above the trees deer found
 grazing on heather with grouse making 
 full use of it as well.  Fallow deer  
 are plentiful on lower slopes. Hawks, 
 particularly Sparrow Hawks are less   
 evident it is reputed the reason for  
 this is that their natural prey is    
 being killed of by use of pesticides  
 on trees &amp; the hawks are being forced 
 into unborn areas for food.           </content>
