		<title>17ENTERTAINMENT FACILITIES</title>
		<content> The{provision of entertainment}       
 facilities in Kinglassie is to say    
 the least{very limited for young      
{people.   }                           
                                       
 A{new community hall}has been built   
 behind Kinglassie Primary School and  
 this represents the only major        
 community facility where people can   
 meet and take part in club activities.
 Initial enthusiasm for the new hall   
 has since declined and there is very  
 little in the way of sports or social 
 club activities in the village.       
                                       
 A{youth club}does run twice a week but
 again facilities are very limited.    
                                       
 Older people in the village are better
 provided for with an{old folks club}  
 which organises bowling afternoons and
 social activities.                    </content>
