		<content>  The Highland Aromatics soap factory  
 has been converted from a Free Church 
 to a soap factory.They also make      
 perfume and perfume pillows ,sachets  
 and talc.                             
                                       
  The business started when the owner  
 had to buy expensive soaps because she
 had sensitive skin, so she decided to 
 start her own business in the         
 Highlands.                            
                                       
  They even have orders for the Royal  
 family at Balmoral. But mostly the    
 soap and perfume are sold to tourists 
 who come and visit the factory.       
                                       
 The most westerly place catered for is
 Alaska. And it has been heard that the
 soap is being sold in Sydeny Opera    
 House.
