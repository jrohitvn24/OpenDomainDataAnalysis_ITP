		<content> The spinning mill was opened in l787, 
 l98 years ago. The mill was worked by 
 water which was stored in a dam. The  
 mill is now owned by Courtalds. l34   
 people are employed in the spinning   
 mill. The fibre that starts them off  
 is sheeps wool that gets made into    
 lambs wool and cashmere then that     
 fibre gets transported to Lyle        
 &amp; Scott's to get made into jerseys.   
 The factory has four floors but three 
 floors are only used. Now the building
 is worked by electricity. The machines
 used for spinning are called mules.   
 The spinning mill has its own Union   
 which is called the T.G.W.U. and the  
 mill is a listed building.
