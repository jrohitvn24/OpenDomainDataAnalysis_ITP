		<title>18A LOCAL HISTORY OF BUSBY</title>
		<content>  There is evidence of a{pre-Roman     
{settlement}on the west bank of the    
 Cart near Overlee.The name 'Busby' is 
 unusual for Scotland as it is a Saxon 
 word.Early water powered{mills}were   
 located on the east bank of the Cart  
 in the 17th century.However by 1860   
 cotton weaving was abandoned and by   
 1900 the last mill closed.In spite of 
 this the population grew with the     
 opening of a{railway}making Busby only
 a half hour's journey from            
 Glasgow.This made Busby popular with  
 rich Glasgow merchants whose houses   
 are now part of the Conservation      
 Area.This means Busby has been a      
{'commuter'}village for over 100       
 years.The sites of the old mills still
 exist as industrial estates.Some of   
 the old buildings such as Lower Mill  
 have been renovated and are used today
 for offices and small factories.      </content>
