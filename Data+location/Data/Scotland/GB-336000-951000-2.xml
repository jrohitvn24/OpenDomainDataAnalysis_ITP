		<content> One of Wick's four schools might be   
 closed in 1986 because we have too    
 many schools for such a small         
 town.Either the Hillhead School or    
 Pulteney town Academy might be        
 closed.Pulteney town Academy is being 
 considered for closure  because of the
 bad condition of the building.If the  
 Hillhead school is going to be closed 
 down it will be because it doesn't    
 have enough pupils.The North school   
 shall not be closed as it has a large 
 number of pupils and the South school 
 is a brand new school.Which ever      
 school they decide to close the pupils
 shall be sent to the North school.The 
 Wick parents are not pleased about    
 this and each school has had a        
 separate meeting so the parents of the
 children concerned can  express their 
 arguments to the Education Committee.
