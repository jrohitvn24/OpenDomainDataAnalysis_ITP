		<title>07CROMBIE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Crombie School, which was opened in   
 1928, now has a population of only{14}
 boys and{9}girls, although the janitor
 recalled a time when there were{68}   
 pupils in the school. Because of this 
 declining role, there are only two    
 full time teachers, although 4 part   
 time teachers, 1 secretary, 1 cook,   
 and the lady janitor, also help the   
 school to run efficiently. The two    
 classes, ages 5-8 and 9-12, work in   
 well equipped rooms, with plenty of   
 space elsewhere in the building for   
 project work, cooking etc.            
    The pupils all live within Crombie 
 village itself, or on nearby farms,   
 and they are like one big family.     
    When the pupils leave Crombie, they
 go to either Woodmill High School or  
 to Queen Anne High School, both in    
 Dunfermline, for their secondary      
 education.                            </content>
