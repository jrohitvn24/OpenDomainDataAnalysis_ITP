		<title>13THE FLOW</title>
		<content> This block is mainly heather clad     
 moorland on which black faced hill    
 sheep are grazed.                     
 In autumn and winter, flocks of pink  
 foot geese fly in and feed on the     
 landaround a small loch called the    
 Flow, rhyming with how. The geese fly 
 daily between the Estuary of the Forth
 and the moor. Their numbers, although 
 still substantial, are rather less    
 than they were some ten years ago.    
 During the shooting season, the       
 gamekeeper who lives in the village,  
 arranges grouse and pheasant shoots as
 required by his employers.
