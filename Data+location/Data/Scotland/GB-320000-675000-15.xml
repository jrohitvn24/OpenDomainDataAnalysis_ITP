		<content> There are many different types of     
 houses in the area. For example we    
 have{high-rise flats, bungalows,      
{semi-detached}and{detached housing}and
 there is even a{farmhouse}nearby.     
 Until recently all the local houses   
 were rented from{Edinburgh District   
{Council}but some of the  six in a     
 block{tenement}variety have been sold 
 off to private building companies in  
 an effort to improve the area. These  
 firms are also{renovating}other local 
 authority houses, which will be rented
 as before. This work includes fitting 
 sloping roofs, wooden window frames,  
 central heating and various other     
{improvements}that the local authority 
 could not afford to do by themselves. 
 We will have a mix of{owner occupied  
 and{rented accommodation.
