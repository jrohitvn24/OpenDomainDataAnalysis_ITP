		<title>19LOCAL ISSUES_PEACE CAMP.</title>
		<content> A major issue which is concerning some
 residents of Rhu and Shandon is the   
 Peace Camp which has been set up near 
 to the entrance of the Clyde Submarine
 Base at Faslane in protest over the   
 Government's decision to deploy       
 nuclear weapons.Whilst many people    
 agree with the principles behind the  
  campers'actions,some residents are   
 disturbed that such an unsightly      
 development has been allowed to remain
 in an area of high amenity and argue  
 that this is having an adverse effect 
 on the value and sale of nearby       
 properties.There have also been a few 
 incidents where the actions of the    
 peace campers have affected local     
 people with delays in getting to work 
 at the Base and long tail_backs of    
 traffic and many people have suggested
 that this is perhaps not the best way 
 to go about their protest.            </content>
