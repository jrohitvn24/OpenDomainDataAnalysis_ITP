		<content> Ballast was vital to survival and     
 70,000 tons came annually into the    
 town during the 19 Century.The Ballast
 Bank contained over 1 million tons of 
 of ballast was brought from many parts
 of the world but chiefly from         
 Ireland.Troon was fast becoming a very
 important sea/port.The sea wall was   
 rebuilt,the berth dredged providing a 
 depth of 20 feet at low tide.Imports  
 between 1902 and 1914 proved that     
 Troon was a viable port.Over 1250000  
 tons of iron ore were discharged      
 during this period.The ore was bought 
 by Lugar Irvine, and Dalmellington.The
 port was favoured by Mediterranean    
 commerce.The skippers from Quebec in  
 Canada,hibernated at Troon when the   
 St.Lawrence was closed with           
 ice.Thus,Troon became a port used by  
 ships from all over the world.More    
 about the port in further texts......t</content>
