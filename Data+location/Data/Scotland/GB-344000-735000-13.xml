 There is not much in the way of trade 
 in this area. There are only two      
 shops. They also have post-offices.   
 They sell groceries, confectionery    
 and tobacco. They are also newsagents.
 Although people buy odd groceries from
 them they do not buy all they need    
 there as they do not cover all their  
 needs and tend to be more expensive.  
                                       
 They mostly do their shopping in      
 supermarkets in the towns roundabout  
 eg. Tesco, Asda, Wm. Low, Presto and  
 Safeway.                              
                                       
 There is a baker's van going round the
 area selling rolls,also a butcher's   
 van , and a fish van.
