     The second event was the          
 publishing of a painting of Alyth by  
 J.Campbell Kerr as the fronticepiece  
 of the popular weekly "The People's   
 Friend ".                             
     Alyth Parish Church is a prominent
 land mark and is still the home of  a 
 very active congregation. The present 
 Church was built in 1839.             
 At the top of Toutie Street where it  
 joins High Street and Hill Street     
 stands the old Merket Cross in the    
 Grounds of the Former High Manse .    
 Behind the houses on the south side of
 High Street at the Cross are the old  
 arches which are part of the ruins of 
 the old Alyth Parish Church
