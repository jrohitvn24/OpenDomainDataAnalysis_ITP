		<content>    Out of the survey I did in my class
 I found out that 18 mothers and 22    
 fathers worked. Some of the mothers   
 are housewives which accounts for more
 women unemployed than men. Many       
 parents are employed at Glaxo and     
 Cadburys Schweppes, nearby factories. 
 Although the other jobs are varied, 8 
 of the parents are self-employed. 40  
 out of 54 parents work. 4 work at 3   
 nearby factories, 3 are teachers, 2   
 are secretaries, 2 cleaners, 2        
 joiners, 2 restraunt owners; there are

 docker, 1 farm worker, 1 childminder, 
 1 canteen lady, 1 electrician, 1      
 cashier, 1 milkman, 1 home help, 1    
 teaching auxiliary, 1 is a helper at a
