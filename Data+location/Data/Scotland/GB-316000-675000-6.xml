		<content> On schooldays I rise at 0730, dress   
 in my uniform and grab my schoolbag   
 before I dash downstairs for fruit    
 juice, milk and toast.I usually walk  
 to school in time for the bell at 0855
 when lessons in Language and Maths    
 begin. I enjoy my Environmental       
 Studies project, this term River      
 Studies. Last term I enjoyed handcraft
 and the gym we did in the hall. In the
 summer we have more sport out-of-doors
 and I'm not so good at that.Lunchtime 
 is 1205-1300. I have a pack of        
 sandwiches and fruit. I could buy a   
 school dinner for 50p. After school my
 homework takes about 30 minutes, then 
 I practice trying to ride my bicycle. 
 I like to read,write plays and make   
 models                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
