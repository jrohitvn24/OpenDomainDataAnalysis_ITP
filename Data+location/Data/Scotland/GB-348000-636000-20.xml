		<content>  THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN 
 WRITTEN BY TEENAGERS.                 
 GALASHIELS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL TOWN 
 BOASTING SOME TWELVE THOUSAND         
 INHABITANTS BUT, OWING TO ITS STATUS  
 AS SOCIAL CENTRE OF THE BORDERS,IT    
 ENJOYS A CONSTANT FLOW OF VISITORS    
 BOTH FROM SURROUNDING AREAS AND       
 FURTHER AFIELD,AND DURING THE SUMMER  
 IS A HUB OF ACTIVITY.                 
 HOWEVER BENEATH THE IDYLLIC VENEER    
 LURKS THE SEAMIER SIDE OF LIFE COMMON 
 TO MANY LARGER TOWNS.DRUG AND SOLVENT 
 ABUSE,ALCHOHOLISM AND VANDALISM,ARE   
 GROWING PROBLEMS.LICENCED CLUBS AND   
 PUBLIC HOUSES ADMITTING PEOPLE UNDER  
 THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN ENCOURAGES THEM TO
 PARTICIPATE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES,    
 ADDING TO TO THESE SOCIAL PROBLEMS.
