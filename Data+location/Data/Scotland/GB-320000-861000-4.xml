   Children nowadays have taken to pop 
 music.It is now part of their everyday
 lives.Top of the pops was voted best  
 pop show on the air and has been on   
 the air for about 25 years.Every year 
 people of the public are chosen to    
 vote at the awards for best male      
 singer,best female singer ect.In my   
 survey of the class wham was the most 
 popular with Paul Young second.These  
 pop artists have won several awards at
 the National Ceremony,Fankie goes to  
 Hollywood had 3 number one hits in a  
 row the first hit 'RELAX' was banned  
 by disc jockey Mike Read due to bad   
 lyrics.                               
   Young people today ecspecially girls
 go for good clothes and nice looks in 
 performers.There are  about twice as  
 many male as female singers.          
 Many females are in backing groups.   </content>
