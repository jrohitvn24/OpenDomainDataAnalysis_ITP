		<title>13Letham Glen.</title>
		<content>  Letham Glen has been a public park   
 since 1925 and was named after a local
 farmer.An open-air swimming pool was  
 replaced by a sunken garden and the   
 site of a coal pit was levelled off to
 form the car park.                    
  The Nature Centre,built from timber  
 from the glen itself,displays         
 information and pictures of many      
 types of wildlife .Animals from the   
 glen may be brought inside, allowing  
 children to gain a better under-      
 standing of the animals in their      
 studies.School projects are welcome   
 and can be displayed in the centre.   
  The pets corner has numerous         
 varieties of fowl, rabbits, deer and  
 donkeys. There are also goats in      
 residence which have proved to be a   
 great attraction.
