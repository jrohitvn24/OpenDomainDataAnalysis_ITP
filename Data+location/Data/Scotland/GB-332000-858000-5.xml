		<content>{ A PUPILS VIEW}of school begins,summer
  or winter,rain or shine,with the tune
 ful sound of the alarm clock  at      
 7.30am. Defying the urge to remain    
 curled up in his warm bed for just    
 another five minutes,he slowly makes  
 his way to the bathroom where he      
 washes himself mechanically in        
 readiness for his gruelling day at    
 school.                               
     Once suitably titivated, he       
 dresses himself in his extremely smart
 green and grey uniform,looks longingly
 at his crumpled bed,which still       
 appears very inviting and guiltily    
 puts away thoughts of an invented     
 ailment from his honest little mind.  
    After breakfast he leaves the house
 and either walks or catches a bus to  
 school,by which time he has realised  
 that the essay he thought was due on  
 Friday should be presented today.     </content>
