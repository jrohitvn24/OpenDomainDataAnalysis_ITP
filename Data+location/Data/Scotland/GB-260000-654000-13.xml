		<title>13Adult Opinions of E Kilbride</title>
		<content> ....We have a pleasant shopping centre
 with reasonable choice of goods though
 some items require a visit to Glasgow.
 The neighbourhood shopping centres are
 also a big advantage for handiness.   
 ....We have many social clubs (often  
 as part of a works organisation) and  
 excellent sports facilities. There are
 also organisations or classes for just
 about any hobby one could think of.   
 ....Surprisingly, for a town of its   
 size, East Kilbride has no Bingo Hall 
 as such, though games of Bingo are    
 played in the social clubs etc.       
 ....East Kilbride is only now develop-
 ing a character of its own. Previously
 it was very much just a collection of 
 people from Glasgow's overspill but   
 now first generation dwellers begin to
 feel a sense of identity.             
 ....Most socialising in clubs is very 
 much drink orientated.                </content>
