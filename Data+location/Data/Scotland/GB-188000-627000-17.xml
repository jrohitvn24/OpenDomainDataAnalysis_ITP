		<title>17Shiskine Valley Employment</title>
		<content>   A very large proportion of the      
 people resident in the Shiskine valley
 are self-employed, or are helping in  
 the family business.                  
   The valley is remarkably well off   
 for facilities and trade services. In 
 addition to the several farmers there 
 are the four hoteliers, a few shop    
 owners (including a butcher who is    
 trying to get an abattoir built), a   
 hairdresser, a builder,an electrician,
 a plumber, three joiners, a baker, and
 of course the garage and haulage      
 family business.                      
   Many of the private businesses      
 provide full-time employment (extra   
 part-time in summer) -hence no great  
 unemployment problem. Two ministers,  
 two doctors (spouses),three teachers  
 and three auxiliary staff at the      
 school completes the employment scene.
