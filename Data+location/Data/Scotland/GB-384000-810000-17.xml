		<title>17Newton Farm</title>
		<content>    {Newton Farm}is leased form an     
 Industrialist and is farmed part-time 
 by Mr.X. In the last few years, over  
 half the farm has been lost due to the
 progressive encroachment of the       
 near-by Industrial Estate. Mr.X.      
 regrets this development as it        
 jeopardises not only his livelihood,  
 but also his way of life. Many of the 
 neighbouring farms are also leased    
 from land speculators who have        
 purchased it in the expectation of the
 Industrial Estate continuing to move  
 outwards so allowing large profits to 
 be made on their investment.          
    Much of the land, at present on the
 fringe of the Estate, suffers from a  
 phenomenon known as{'Planning Blight'}
 where land due for development is left
 sterile and unused pending development
 which can often take years to         
 materialise.                          </content>
