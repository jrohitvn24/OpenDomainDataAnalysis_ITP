		<title>17MUTHILL CIVIC TRUST.</title>
		<content> In{1975}Muthill was classed as an     
 Outstanding Conservation Area by the  
 Historic Buildings Council for        
 Scotland.                             
 The appearance of the two main roads  
 (Drummond St and Willoughby St.)is    
 little different from 200 years ago,  
 although the houses have been         
 modernised internally.A group of      
 villagers formed the {Civic Trust}to  
 preserve the appearance of the        
 village.They check the plans for new  
 buildings to make sure they fit in.   
 They also renovated a burnt out house 
 for a{Museum.}It shows old coins,     
 photographs,weapons,antiques,clothes. 
 Of the interesting photographs, one   
 shows the fitting of an iron rim to a 
 wooden cart wheel at the former Smithy
 near the Post Office.The other is of  
 the mail coach coming up Willoughby   
 St. on its way to the train South.    </content>
