		<content> Housed in the old village school,     
 Ballater Field Centre exists to       
 provide support and accommodation for 
 Environmental Education in Grampian   
 Region. It is used by schools and     
 community groups. The aim is to give, 
 all the year round, a stimulating     
 learning experience in a diverse and  
 attractive environmental setting.     
 The Regional Council has recently     
 approved the Â£55,000 needed to bring  
 the sleeping and washing facilities   
 for both staff and students up to a   
 comfortable standard.The centre has a 
 well-stocked library and resource     
 materials of all kinds. A fully       
 equiped meteorological station is     
 maintained. For fieldwork trips while 
 staying at the centre the students use
 cycles or cross-country skiis. For    
 trips further afield there is a       
 mini-bus available.                   </content>
