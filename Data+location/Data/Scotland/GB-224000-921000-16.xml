		<title>16Inchnadamph Nature Reserve</title>
		<content> The reserve occupies{1,300 hectares   
{(3,200acres) between Loch Assynt and  
{Ben More Assynt}and lies south east of
 Inchnadamph.{Mr E.H.Vestey}(owner of  
 Assynt Estates) agreed with the Nature
 Conservancy that they would start a   
 Nature Reserve, in 1956. There are    
 interesting{limestone}formations in-  
 the{Stronchrubie cliffs (100m high).  
 The valleys of the{Traligill River    
 forming the Northern boundaries of the
 reserve are especially rich in{caves  
 and underground streamways.The caves  
 and holes were formed by acidic water 
 dissolving the limestone and the deep 
 crevices and corries by{glaciers      
 sweeping through Loch Assynt to the   
 sea. Many prehistoric bones were      
 stranded in the caves and found later.
 To encourage regeneration of trees    
 (felled for quick profit or damaged by
 fire) two{exclosures}keep out animals.</content>
