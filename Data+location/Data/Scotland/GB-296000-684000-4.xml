   The National Trust asked Mrs.       
 Porteous to leave their shop in Alva  
 to open one in Culross. They said they
 would give her one of their derelict  
 properties on condition that she      
 restore it. It was not easy. The      
 architect died in the middle of it;she
 had problems with the builder. Now,   
 the Tron Shop is very busy, especially
 in summer. Locals as well as tourists 
 buy the jewellery, pottery, musical   
 instruments and clothing, all Scottish
 made, and the Irish linen teatowels.  
  Just over a month ago a second shop  
 to attract tourists opened,THE        
 CURIOSITY SHOP.It specialises in      
 antiques and sells plants too.
