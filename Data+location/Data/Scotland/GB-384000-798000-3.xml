		<content> Kingcausie Estate is owned by the     
 Fortescue family whose ancestors have 
 lived in the area almost since the    
 time of Domesday Book. The estate     
 comprises 2,000 acres: 1200           
 farmland,600 woodland and 200 rough   
 ground.  There are 25 houses with some
 70-80 people living there. The family 
 have interested themselves in the     
 preservation of the countryside.  A   
 large scale replanting of trees was   
 undertaken after hundreds were chopped
 down to provide timber in two world   
 wars. Sadly, in the great gale of 1953
 more were destroyed but again planting
 has taken place. The name means "hill 
 of pine trees" and besides that being 
 assured many beautiful deciduous trees
 provide habitat for a variety of birds
 and small animals.
