		<content>   The{Links Market}has been coming to 
 Kirkcaldy every year for over{six     
{hundred years.}It began as a weekly   
 market in 1304 and in 1305 a fair was 
 permitted.Gradually the market        
 disappeared but the fair continued for
 the amusement of the people.          
   It is held in{April}and is here for 
 four or five days. The stalls and     
 amusements are set up along the {mile 
{long Esplanade.                       
   What the people like about the      
 Market are the crowds,the music,the   
 smell of hot-dogs and chips,the fast  
 rides,the colourful stalls and most of
 all the exciting atmosphere.          
   This year the Market was opened by  
 councillor King the chairman of       
 Kirkcaldy District Council.
