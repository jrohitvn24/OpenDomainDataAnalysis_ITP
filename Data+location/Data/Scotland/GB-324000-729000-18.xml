		<title>18CUSTOMS IN ABERNYTE</title>
		<content> Halloween is the 31st October.At the  
 school they draw pictures of ghosts,  
 witches and scary things.In Abernyte  
 there is a party in the school when   
 everyone ducks for apples and has fun.
 When it gets dark the children dress  
 up and go guising.Guising means they  
 go visiting round the houses wearing  
 fancy dress,singing songs, telling    
 jokes and playing tunes.The children  
 are given sweets,nuts and money.If you
 don't give the children something then
 the witches are supposed to get the   
 people.                               
 When it is snowy everybody goes with  
 their sledges to Abernyte Hill.People 
 use plastic bags, sledges and half of 
 a plastic barrel,Others go to the     
 Witches Dub above Abernyte to skate.  
 At midnight on Hogmany the church bell
 rings, no_one knows who rings it.
