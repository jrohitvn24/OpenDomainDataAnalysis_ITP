		<title>19The Game Keeper 3</title>
		<content>   There are also some poachers and    
 last year some of them dressed up as  
 frog men and speared the salmon that  
 were in the dam. They were caught and 
 convicted.                            
   There are fewer keepers now because 
 there is less demand for them. Only a 
 few Estates can afford keepers or to  
 take on apprentices. Some young people
 that want to be a game keeper go to   
 the forestry departmet to get a job as
 a ranger.                             
  One man can do the work of three men 
 with the help of an Argocat (a vehicle
 for travelling over rough ground) to  
 carry the animals.
