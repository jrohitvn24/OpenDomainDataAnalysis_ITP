		<content> We visited lady who has lived in The  
 Clachan since before last war. Regrets
 loss of view due to house building.   
 Used to see up loch to Garelochhead   
 and her house surrounded by fields    
 which now built over. Skyline has dark
 ened because conifers planted in place
 of broad leaved trees. Although she   
 preferred pre-war is not unhappy with 
 present and doesn't think will be much
 change in future. Old people not much 
 affected by bases except for traffic. 
 Indigenous population dwindling and   
 newcomers increasing. Former still run
 ning St.Modan's &amp; bowling club while  
 latter run Community Council &amp; Assoc.
