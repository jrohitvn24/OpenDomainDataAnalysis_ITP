		<content> For this we concentrated on the most  
 common items found in homes today,cars
 televisions,radios and computers.We   
 also found the proportion of Gaelic   
 speakers in our area because here a   
 lot of the conversation in homes will 
 be in Gaelic.                         
                                       
 In all but one of the houses we       
 visited there was a radio,87.9% of the
 houses owned a television,55.6% owned 
 a car and only 8.3% owned a computer. 
                                       
 In all we surveyed 108 homes in which 
 280 people lived,189 of whom were     
 Gaelic speakers and therefore         
 bilingual.
