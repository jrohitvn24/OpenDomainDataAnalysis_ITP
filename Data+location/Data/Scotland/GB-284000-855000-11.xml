		<title>11NAIRN:SCHOOL TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Nairn Academy is a modern school of   
 800 pupils.The school serves other    
 surrounding villages and towns eg.    
 Auldearn(3miles away)Cawdor(5miles)   
 and Ferness(9miles).Not all pupils can
 walk to school so many travel by      
 school transport.eg.taxi,bus or mini- 
 bus.These services run every day      
 during the school year.Bicycles are   
 also an important way of getting to   
 school.Taxis are used by pupils who   
 live in remote places or by pupils    
 that are disabled.A survey showed     
 these results:                        
 Pupils who walk to school: 56%        
 Pupils who travel by bike: 17%        
 Pupils who travel by taxi:  8%        
 Pupils who travel by bus : 17%        
 Pupils who use a mini-bus:  2%        
  We found that that more people walk  
 to school than any other way
