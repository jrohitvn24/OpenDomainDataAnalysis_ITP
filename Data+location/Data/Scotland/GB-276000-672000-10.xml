		<title>10MY HOUSE IN GLASGOW</title>
		<content> MY HOUSE IN GLASGOW WAS NEAR SHOPS. MY
 SCHOOL WAS NOT FAR FROM MY HOME.I     
 ENJOYED STAYING IN GLASGOW BECAUSE YOU
 WERE NOT FAR FROM A SHOPPING          
 CENTRE.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE ABOUT WHERE
 I STAYED WAS THAT YOU HAD TO CROSS A  
 MAIN ROAD TO GET TO THE SWING PARK. I 
 DID NOT LIKE ALL THE GRAFFITI ON THE  
 BUILDINGS BECAUSE IT RUINS THEM. I    
 LIKE MY HOUSE IN CUMBERNAULD BETTER   
 BECAUSE THERE ARE WALKWAYS FOR        
 PEDESTRIANS AND THE MAIN ROADS ARE    
 ONLY FOR CARS, BUSES AND LORRIES. THE 
 SWING PARKS ARE NOT FAR FROM YOUR HOME
 AND I AM VERY GLAD THAT I MOVED TO    
 CUMBERNAULD.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
