		<content> Within our area there are many        
{churches}representing a wide variety  
 of Christian belief. Most churches    
 have 2 services on a{Sunday}and some  
 hold other services during the week-  
 often to study the{Bible.}Many of     
 those responsible for the organisation
 of congregations have seen the        
 importance of the church being        
 involved in the community at all      
 levels-amongst{the young}-cubs,scouts,
 B.B.'s,Brownies,Guides;{the old}-'over
 60' clubs, coffee mornings etc; and   
{those in need}of help and support from
 the church. The church we know        
 most about is{Davidson's Mains Parish 
{Church.}It was built in 1948 and      
 D.Mains Primary School attends a      
 service there at the end of each term.
 The present minister is the{Rev.James 
{Monaghan}and he comes into the school 
 to take our morning services.         </content>
