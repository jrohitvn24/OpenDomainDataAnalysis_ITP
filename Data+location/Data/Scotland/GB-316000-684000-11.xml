 In the area we have got there are many
 old places of interest.There are five 
{dovecots}in our area.A{dovecot}is a   
 place where in the{18th}century they  
 fattened up doves for eating.There is 
 also a{castle}in{Aberdour.}It has been
 split up into three parts.The oldest  
 part is on the{Dour Bourn}which is    
 believed to have been built in the    
{18th}century .When the railway was    
 built in{1890}the{north wall}was      
 re-erected so that it was nearer to   
 the{castle.}Other small modifications 
 were made too.The middle part of the  
{castle}and the east wing are both     
 fairly modern built in the{19th       
 century.There is also a lookout tower 
 at{Otterston loch.}In the tower there 
 is a stone staircase called{Mount     
{Laura.}It was built in middle of the  
{19th}century.                         </content>
