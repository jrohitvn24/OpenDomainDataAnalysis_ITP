		<title>10Yetholm Parish Church</title>
		<content> The Minister also serves Morebattle,  
 Hownam and Linton, living in Kirk     
 Yetholm. Sunday worship is at 10am    
 attended by about seventy five adults 
 a mixed choir of young and old. The   
 congregation includes Episcopalians   
 and occasionally supported by a Roman 
 Catholic. The Yetholm roll numbers    
 250. Holy Communion is celebrated six 
 times a year. On Easter , Christmas,  
 Remembrance and Harvest Thanksgiving  
 Sundays numbers will rise to two      
 hundred. Most children will be        
 baptised and most young people will   
 become communicant members at about   
 eighteen years. With few exeptions    
 marriages are solemnised in church and
 funerals are invariably conducted by  
 the minister at church or home with   
 prayers at graveside or Edinburgh     
 Crematorium. There is no evidence of a
 decline in the Cristian presence.     </content>
