		<content> Carron Iron Works had a sand store    
 close to Stenhousemuir.Rain formed a  
 pool in the centre of the sand.There  
 were washing greens close by and the  
 area was used as a{play}area the sand 
 ,grass and water providing excellent  
 entertainment.When the Works stopped  
 using the sand,the local authority    
 took the area over,formed a boating   
 pond from the old pool,flattened over 
 the sand and created a grassy{park    
 known as The Crownest Park.It became  
 the George V Memorial Playing Fields  
 but is still best known as the{lido. }
 There were putting,trampolines,litter 
 bins,an old tractor,chutes,swings,    
 tennis courts,and a well used and     
 maintained boating pond.20 years      
 ago,it was a favourite place for      
 Sunday School Outings.
