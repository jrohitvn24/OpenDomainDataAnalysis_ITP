		<title>06LAW AND ORDER IN DALBEATTIE</title>
		<content> There has been a {police force }in    
 Dalbeattie since 1890.The most recent 
 police station was built in 1975.There
 are 6 constables and 1 sergeant.In    
 the station there is only one cell,   
 where up to three or four people may  
 be kept for a couple of hours,after   
 which they are usually taken to       
 Dumfries.The area covered by our      
 police force is about 30 square miles.
  In Dalbeattie we have two{justices of
{the peace,}who act as judges in local 
 district courts.Our nearest courts    
 are in Kirkcudbright.Minor offences   
 are dealt with there.The sheriff court
 deals with more serious crimes.Our    
 nearest high court is in  Edinburgh.  
 There, people accused of the most     
 serious crimes of all,such as murder, 
 are put on trial.
