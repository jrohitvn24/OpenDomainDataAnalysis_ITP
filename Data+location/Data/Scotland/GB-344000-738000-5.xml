		<content> All of the houses in the area are     
 either privately owned or privately   
 rented, and there is a mixture of     
 large farm houses and smaller farm    
 cottages, some of which are occupied  
 by people who are not agricultural    
 workers.  The most common stone used  
 for building is sandstone, and some of
 the older houses have been extended   
 and modernised.  The area contains    
 part of the Gagie Estate which was    
 originally owned by the Abbey of      
 Arbroath.  Gagie House is a large     
 private house built originally by the 
 Guthrie family in 1614.  Fire         
 destroyed a large part of it in 1890, 
 when it was restored with Victorian   
 additions.
