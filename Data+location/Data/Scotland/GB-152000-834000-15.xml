 CROFT TOGETHER AND WE HELP DAD WITH   
 THE FLOCK.SOMETIMES WE BRING THEM TO  
 THE HILL SO THEY GET THE RICH         
 GREEN GRASS. WE ALL HELP OUT, MY      
 SISTER' AND MY MUM AND DAD. WE MAKE   
 SURE THE ANIMALS ARE HEALTHY AND      
 WELL. WHEN THE ANIMALS TAKE ILL WE    
 HAVE TO CALL THE VET OVER FROM PORTREE
 ON SKYE BECAUSE THERE IS NO VET ON    
 THE ISLAND.

 KEEP THE ANIMALS IN GOOD HEALTH.
