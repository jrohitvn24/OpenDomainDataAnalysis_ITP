		<title>13VEGETABLE PROCESSING</title>
		<content> A major agricultural industry in this 
 block is the vegetable processing     
 plant at{INVERALDIE}6.5 Km. north of  
 central Dundee. It employs about 40   
 people (mostly women) and is noted for
 its{PEELED POTATOES}and processed     
 vegetables which include leeks,       
 carrots, turnips, onions and cabbage  
 but they also sell fruit. Vegetables  
 and fruit are obtained from{GLASGOW   
{FRUIT MARKET}and brought back to      
 Inveraldie for processing. There are  
 several chemical processes to preserve
 them and keep their colour. They are  
 delivered as far afield as Glasgow and
 Aberdeen, mostly to hospitals,        
 schools, hotels and{PRESTWICK AIRPORT.
 Onions are delivered to{DYCE}for a    
 meat packing firm. Waste is sent to   
 the local piggery.
