 forest deer. We were also very lucky  
 to see a couple of rabbits.           
 Rabbits try to find sheltered places  
 to live as much as possible for       
 example at the foot of the hill or at 
 the edge of the forest.               
 They usually eat grass, clover and    
 heather they mostly eat their food at 
 dusk and dawn.                        
 Rabbits are sometimes known as pests  
 because they eat farmers crops and    
 they are not particularly popular. We 
 also saw pheasants like the ones at   
 Gelston Estate.                       
 Thousands of reared pheasants are     
 released every year by gamekeepers    
 into woods in preparation for the     
 shooting season starting on October   
 1st. The male bird has lovely         
 colourful markings. However the female
 has only brown markings.              </content>
