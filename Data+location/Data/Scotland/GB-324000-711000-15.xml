		<title>15'MUCHTY..DISUSED QUARRY</title>
		<content> Rossie Den quarry, east of 'Muchty,   
 was worked untill the 1960's. It is   
 partly owned by Bell Bros (Newburgh)  
 Ltd., who took over Adamson brothers  
 who worked the basalt quarry, and by  
 Mr. Storrar of Rossie Farm.           
 The old quarry is quite well screened 
 from the A 91 cupar to auchtermuchty  
 road by deciduous trees, mainly       
 sycamores and hawthorn bushes.After   
 the quarry was closed, it was used by 
 people on motorbikes, as a scrambling 
 area.The quarry was also used as an   
 unofficial tip untill 1983 when it was
 fenced off and notices were put up to 
 inform people not to dump their       
 rubbish.Unfortunately, due to this    
 unofficial dumping, quite pleasant    
 area has been turned into an          
 unpleasant area. In the future the    
 quarry will probably be reclaimed.
