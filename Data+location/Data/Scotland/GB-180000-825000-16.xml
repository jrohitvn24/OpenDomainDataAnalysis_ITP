		<title>16BALMACARA HOUSE</title>
		<content> Balmacara House is a very old building
 on the shores of Lochalsh.The building
 must be about 200 or more years old.It
 was owned by a family called          
 Lillingston until they sold the Estate
 and built a smaller private house in  
 the vicinity. It was then leased by a 
 gentleman called Lord Blysthwood who  
 came there for his holiday every      
 summer.It was worked at all winter by 
 two old ladies from the village.After 
 Lord Blysthwood's death, it was taken 
 over by Sir Daniel Hamilton who had   
 bought Balmacara Estate. After his    
 death Balmacara House was bequeathed  
 to Ross-shire Education Authority as a
 boys' agricultural college.Following  
 that it is now leased out to the Royal
 Navy. They have done a lot of         
 alterations which is a big            
 improvement.
