		<title>12WATER OF LEITH,EDINBURGH..</title>
		<content> The{Water of Leith}is a small river   
 that runs through Edinburgh,passing   
 many of its{villages}as it goes.From  
{Stockbridge}it flows under the{Dean   
{Bridge,}designed by{Thomas Telford}in 
 1832, to the scenic{Dean Village,}dean
 meaning a gorge or deep village and   
 here it is possibly at its most       
 beautiful. Then it flows on to        
{Roseburn.}Its banks are put to use in 
 many ways. There is plenty of{wildlife
 to study and watch whilst many        
{fishermen}can be seen casting at its  
 side. Along its{footpaths}people      
 stroll with their pets enjoying the   
 peaceful surrounds. If you walk       
 upstream you can visit the{Dean       
{Cemetery}where many famous people are 
 buried.
