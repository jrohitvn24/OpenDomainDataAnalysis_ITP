		<content> There is one hotel and a guest house  
 in the area.The hotel is used by      
 holiday makers and visiting business  
 men.The guest house by Coulport       
 workers.These two places give employ- 
 ment to school leavers.               
    There are two builders who repair  
 old houses as well as building new    
 ones.They have apprentices who are    
 learning the trade.There is also a    
 joiner and a plumber who work in the  
 village.                              
   Although there are these small      
 employers it is obvious that the major
 source of jobs is the M.O.D.This means
 that if the bases were to close there 
 would be very high unemployment here. 
 The shops which are just outside our  
 area also give work but many people go
 to the supermarkets in Helensburgh and
 Clydebank for major shopping
