		<title>15A TEENAGER IN HOUSTON</title>
		<content> Young people feel that the village    
 lacks things to do. Much spare time is
 spent elsewhere. Glasgow and Paisley  
 have good shops and cafes, Bridge of  
 Weir has good golf courses and Linwood
 has a well equipped sports centre.This
 involves travel costs and time. The   
 local schools run clubs during the    
 day,e.g.chess,debating,volleyball,and 
 during most evenings e.g.film club. On
 Mondays the youth club is open to 12  
 to 16 year olds. Local rivers have    
 fishing clubs. 'Nightlife' is confined
 to occasional junior discos in the    
 village hall with 3 pubs for the over 
 18s.
