		<title>12Tourism in Edinburgh</title>
		<content> We interviewed tourists on the        
 esplanade of Edinburgh Castle which   
 stands at the top of the Royal Mile.  
 The Royal MIle has a lot of old and   
 famous buildings which depict         
 Edinburgh's{local history.}The        
 tourists came from places like Canada,
 U.S.A., Australia and Europe to visit 
 the{historic buildings}of Edinburgh.  
 Many of these countries have very     
 little history of their own.          
{Tourism}is very important to          
 Edinburgh's economy. Many{events}are  
 put on for the benefit of the         
 tourists. Each year on the Castle     
 Esplanade the military tattoo takes   
 place. This includes demonstrations   
 and displays by the {Armed Forces.}   
 Other tourist attractions include the 
 Festival and the Fringe, museums,     
 perormances in Princes St. Gardens,art
 galleries, etc.                       </content>
