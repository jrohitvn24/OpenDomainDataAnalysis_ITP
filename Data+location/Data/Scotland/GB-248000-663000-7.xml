		<content> Our school has about four hundred     
 and seventy pupils five percent of    
 which are Asian.                      
 Wun Man Chau is Chinese. His parents  
 were born in Hong Kong and came here  
 to find a business _ a Chinese food   
 carry out. His mum helps local Chinese
 people to learn English at night      
 school.                               
 At home the family speak Chinese and  
 English, they like to eat Chinese food
 and celebrate Festivals such as       
 Chinese New Year.                     
 Occasionally they visit relatives in  
 Hong Kong and sometimes aunts and     
 uncles visit the Chau's Paisley home  
 for celebrations and family           
 gatherings.  Wun Man feels more       
 Scottish than Chinese, wearing Western
 clothes and is involved in various    
 local clubs e.g. the B.B.  He has many
 Scottish friends and a local accent!  </content>
