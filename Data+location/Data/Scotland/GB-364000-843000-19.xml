		<content> sThe{weather}in this part of Britain  
 can be very cruel at times. Most      
 winters see a great deal of{snow      
 falling and much{drifting}results due 
 to the wind that often blows. This    
 drifting means that on occasions in   
 the winter the area is cut off from   
 the outside world. However this does  
 not usualkly last long due to the     
 excellent work done by{Snow Ploughs.  
 In winter the wind comes from the     
{north east}and can be extremely cold. 
 Nearly every home in the area faces   
 south due to this wind and many homes 
 have few if any windows facing north. 
 In the summer the wind is a{south     
{westerly}but the general openess of   
 the area tends to lead to{cool        
{temperatures.}Problems can arise in   
{dry spells}as homes, farms and school 
 are dependant on{wells}which often dry
 up in{droughts.                       </content>
