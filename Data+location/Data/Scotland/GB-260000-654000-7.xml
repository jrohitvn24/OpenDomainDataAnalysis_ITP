		<content>    The Town Centre is serviced by many
 bus services for both local and more  
 distant destinations. There is also a 
 very busy taxi-rank which many of the 
 laden shoppers use. Within half a mile
 of the Town Centre is the railway     
 station but here the picture is not   
 quite so bright. The railway pre-dates
 the New Town and for much of the way  
 to Glasgow is single track. This means
 there is a far less frequent service  
 than one might expect in a town of a  
 comparable size, with a further draw- 
 back that, although the station may   
 have been ideally situated for the old
 village, it is some distance from the 
 residential areas erected since the   
 New Town development. Another factor  
 worth mentioning at this point is the 
 higher than average incidence of car  
 ownership in the area which again does
 not help the rail travel problem.     </content>
