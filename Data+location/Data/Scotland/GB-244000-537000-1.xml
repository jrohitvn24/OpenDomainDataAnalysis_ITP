		<title>01Whithorn in Galloway</title>
		<content> Whithorn is a quiet residential       
 village with a high percentage of     
 retired people.  Quite a few of the   
 young folks go elsewhere to find      
 employment.  Others work in local     
 shops, farms or are unemployed.  One  
 of the features of Whithorn is that it
 is an Ancient and Royal Burgh.  Most  
 visitors go to see the "Vaults" where 
 the Monks lived long ago.  St. Ninian 
 is supposed to be buried there, also  
 there is a Museum which is interesting
 In 1984 there was an excavation which 
 uncovered an ancient burial ground.   
 There is Green Bowling and in the     
 winter, evening classes, 'Pool' in the
 local pubs, a library, Bingo Hall also
 Annual Flower Show.  The surrounding  
 area is all farm land with mostly     
 dairy farming. There is a bus service 
 but not always convenient &amp; one needs 
 a car to get around the countryside.  </content>
