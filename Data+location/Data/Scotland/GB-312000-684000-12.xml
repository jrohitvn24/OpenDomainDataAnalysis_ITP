 Fordell Castle was built in the early 
{16th century}and is a splendid example
 of a Scottish towerhouse. It was      
 rebuilt after a fire destroyed it in  
 1568. The castle was owned by James   
 Henderson and stayed with them for 400
 hundred years. Two of the lairds died 
 in battle wth the English and another 
 17th century laird was a mercenary    
 captain in the Mediterranean sea.     
 The family later moved into the newly 
 built Fordell House.When the estate   
 was broken up it was eventually       
 purchased by Mr Nicholas Fairbairn    
 (Solicitor_General for Scotland).     </content>
