		<title>15A FISHING LOCH IN STRACHAN</title>
		<content> Major &amp; Mrs Strachan bought Mill of   
 Strachan 20 yrs ago because it is pro-
 nounced STRONN as in their name and   
 it looked nice and had great poss-    
 ibilities. It took a lot of work to   
 convert it to proper living quarters. 
  Major Strachan has dug out holes with
 a JCB digger in the field to make the 
 loch.The water comes off the old mill-
 lade.                                 
 They were going to run a fish farm    
 but competition is now too keen so he 
 stocks it with rainbow trout and lets 
 out the fishing .                     
 We were told that the water is so deep
 that if Major Strachan were to stand  
 up in it and stretch up his hand he   
 wouldn't be seen.He is tall.He some   
 times goes boating on it.
