		<title>18MICRO HYDRO_ELECTRICITY,RHUM</title>
		<content> From the beginning of the 20th Century
 Rhum has benefited from hydro_electric
 power. However, the various systems   
 employed were inadequate and socially 
 unacceptable for the "high_tech"      
 electricity consuming 1980's. There_  
 fore,in 1983/4 a new 240 volt 50Hz AC 
 system was installed, producing a     
 maximum of 45 kilowatts. Islanders    
 could now use most contempory         
 electrical appliances. In the summer  
 of 1983 a new 1500 metre pipe line was
 laid (the original had been in        
 constant use since the early 1900's). 
 This carries water from a small dam   
 situated at 190 metres height. This   
 feeds water to a power_house in which,
 in early 1984, a new turbine of the   
 Pelton wheel type was installed. This,
 coupled to a 30 kilowatt, 3 phase     
 brushless alternator generates the    
 majority of the islanders' power needs</content>
