		<content> Platinum is sometimes found in        
 serpentine and as early as l925       
 it was looked for in the chromite     
 quarries.In February this year a      
 planning application was lodged by    
 Exxon Minerals Company to dig explor- 
 ation trenches at 3 sites in the area.
 Platinum was the goal. Each trench was
 to be l00 metres long with a 70 metre 
 cross trench.This area of serpentine  
 heathland supports a rich breeding    
 bird and botanical community including
 6% of the British population of       
 whimbrel l% of British Arctic skuas,  
 some golden plover, arctic terns and  
 less rare species.Objections were     
 raised so the application was refused.
 A random survey of 40 people in the   
 area showed an overwhelming majority  
 in favour of Exxon's proposals (under 
 strict control) to provide jobs.They  
 thought local consultation was needed.</content>
