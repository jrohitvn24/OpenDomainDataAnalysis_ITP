		<title>06COMMUNITY COUNCIL: SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>   The Community Council holds a       
 meeting in the school on the third    
 Tuesday of every month. It organises a
 sports week with games like bowls,    
 football, badminton, snooker and pool.
                                       
   It also organises the local craft   
 and produce show which has several    
 sections such as gardening, food and  
 one for children. There are small     
 money prizes for each of the sections.
 If you get more 1st, 2nd and 3rd      
 prizes than anyone else you get your  
 name on a shield.                     
                                       
   The Community Council helps with    
 local problems. For instance it asked 
 for extra road signs to make the      
 junction between the A75 and the      
 Shawhead road safer.
