		<title>11RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Melville House is a residential school
 in N.E. Fife. Once a private home,    
 this listed Georgian building is set  
 in 15 acres of land. In 1976 it was   
 bought by Fife Regional Council and is
 now run by the Social Work and        
 Education Departments. This sort of   
 management structure is unique in     
 Scotland.                             
 The school is for up to 40 boys who   
 have had problems coping with the     
 ordinary school system or are         
 considered to be outwith parental     
 control or have been removed from home
 for safety. It is open 365 days/year  
 and looks to fill 3 basic needs:      
 nurture: care: education.             
 Meetings, attended by everyone, are an
 important part of the working life of 
 Melville House. The boys are          
 encouraged to account for their       
 actions in front of their peers.      </content>
