		<title>10MINING PRESENT-CROSSGATES 2</title>
		<content> Before any mining could take place,   
 the coal seams had to be exposed. The 
 topsoil,then the overburden were      
 removed,being piled into{bings}which  
 sheilded the local villages of        
 Halbeath and Crossgates from the site.
 Then another natural obstacle was     
 discovered. Over 100 feet of porous   
 sandstone was excavated to expose the 
 top seam.Heavy equipment was brought  
 in _draglines,huge mechanical shovels 
 which could swallow 15 tonnes a time, 
 coupled with 50 tonne lorries,soon    
 bringing production up to 13,000      
 tonnes a week_ soon to be expanded to 
 80,000 tonnes. Four seams are         
 excavable but because of faulting,some
 of the coal is unobtainable.          
 The open cast mining process can be up
 to 60% more efficient than shaft      
 mining as in shaft mining there are   
 obvious safety reasons i.e. roofing.  </content>
