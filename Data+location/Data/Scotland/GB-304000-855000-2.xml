		<content> We went to the Rafford area to do our 
 Domesday project. Heather and I had to
 find out about Art and Craft.We sent a
 questionnaire sheet to 41 houses. We  
 found that the main craft was         
 needle-work. Almost 50% of the people 
 did needle-work. The next most popular
 craft was ceramics and another popular
 craft was model making.One man in the 
 village makes violins and repairs them
 as well.Another makes and sells       
 furniture. Other crafts were making   
 soft toys, carving and basket weaving.
 The most popular Art work was painting
 while 10 people did sketching.8 people
 did them both.Photography was also    
 popular and 6 people have exhibited   
 their work.
