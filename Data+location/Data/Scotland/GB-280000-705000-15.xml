		<content>  About 60 percent of the children at  
 the school are members of either The  
 Girl's Brigade or The Boy's Brigade,  
 both organizations are affiliated to  
 the church.The girls meet on Mondays  
 and the boys on Wednesdays in the     
 Church hall where they participate in 
 physical exercise, drama,handwork and 
 various other activities.Teenagers    
 tend to opt out of these organizations
 but become involved in the Youth Club,
  Young Farmers, Badminton Club,Scott- 
 ish Country Dancing or Drama Group who
 present excellent productions twice a 
 year. These activities all take place 
 in the village hall in Braco,just 2km 
 from Greenloaning.Older people also   
 belong to the last two groups and to  
 the Bowling Club which attracts many  
 young people too.Women are catered for
 particularly by the S.W.R.I. and the  
 Woman's Guild.                        </content>
