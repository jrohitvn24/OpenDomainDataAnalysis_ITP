		<content> Many adults work out-side the area    
 some in oil-related jobs. Most school 
 leavers have to look for work         
 elsewhere. Unemployment is not the    
 scourge it is in other areas.Some     
 youngsters are employed locally on    
 Youth Training Schemes and the        
 Manpower Services Commission provides 
 a part-time ranger and a labouring    
 squad for projects in the Country Park
 Farming no longer uses a large work   
 force and though tourism is growing   
 there are few full time jobs,many     
 being seasonal and part-time.Local    
 jobs are in farming,small private     
 businesses,the golf course,ambulance  
 and bus depots,the transport museum   
 The local authority provides jobs at  
 Tullynessle school,sheltered housing  
 the Country park,water and fire       
 services and the roads department.
