		<content> The small village of Keig, comprising 
 28 houses, a general merchant's shop  
 and sub post office and a primary     
 school, faces south over the Don      
 valley. The church is sited on the    
 hill behind the village.              
 Northwards is the road to Insch which 
 passes over the Brindy Hill where the 
 land becomes increasingly hilly and   
 barren compared to the fertile valley 
 of the Don.                           
 Much of the best agricultural land in 
 the area is in Castle Forbes Home Farm
 (part of Harthill Farms) through which
 the river flows.                      
 Buildings of note are Castle Forbes   
 which dates from 1815 and Auchnagathle
 House lying to the east of the Insch  
 road. Further to the east is the      
 densely wooded Lord's Throat road     
 leading to Inverurie.
