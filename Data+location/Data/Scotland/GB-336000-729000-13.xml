		<title>13MILLS OBSERVATORY, DUNDEE</title>
		<content> This astronomical observatory,        
 situated on the top of{BALGAY HILL }in
 the centre of Dundee, has the largest 
 telescope available to the general    
 public in Britain.                    
    Opened in 1935, the observatory has
 a dome-roofed observation room        
 equipped with a{10 inch Cooke }       
{refractor telescope}for the study of  
 the night sky, and{several large      
{terrestrial telescopes}are installed  
 on the balcony, giving extensive views
 across  the River Tay.                
  The viewing has been improved by the 
 reduction in the amount of smoke in   
 the atmosphere after the closing of   
 many mills; this is offset by the glow
 of extensive street lighting.         
  The observatory is also involved in  
 national &amp; international co-operation 
 such as the observation of{Halley's   
{Comet,}due in early 1986.             </content>
