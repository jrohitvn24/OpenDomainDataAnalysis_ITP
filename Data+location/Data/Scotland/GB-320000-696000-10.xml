		<title>10BOWHOUSE FARM : DAIRYING</title>
		<content>{Bowhouse farm}is situated around 0.75 
 kilometres to the south of Kinglassie.
 The farm is 65 hectares in size and is
 a{dairy farm}having been converted    
 from an arable farm 12 years ago in   
 order to allow the farmer to maximise 
 his profits                           
 At the moment the herd is slowly being
 changed into a{pedigree herd}in order 
 to produce better animals which in    
 turn will give a better yield of milk,
 butterfat etc.The herd consists of 110
 milking cows.The{average milk   }     
{production for the herd is 5500 litres
{per year,}the highest recorded yield  
 being 9000 litres. Lately, dairy      
 farmers have been hit by E.E.C.       
 restrictions on milk production (8%   
 reduction on output) but this has not 
 affected Bowhouse Farm too greatly as 
 in recent years milk output has       
 increased to supply a milk round.     </content>
