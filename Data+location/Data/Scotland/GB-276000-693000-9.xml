		<content> In the old part of the town the houses
 are about 300 years old. Some of them 
 have been modernised and turned into  
 flats. In Kelly Court new shelter     
 houses have been built for old people 
 with a warden and special             
 accommodation for friends and         
 relatives to visit. The houses in the 
 centre of the town are about 200 years
 old. Nearly all the ground floor flats
 have been made into shops.            
     Council housing estates were built
 in the Raploch area during the last 60
 years. Houses near the Gowan Hill were
 built with flat roofs but whenever it 
 rained dampness was caused so the     
 roofs were replaced with sloping      
 roofs. Other Council houses and flats 
 have been built on the other side of  
 the river, where there is also an     
 estate of private houses.
