		<content>   Three senior citizens were          
 interviewed - Mrs Graham (97), Miss   
 Vassie (88), and Mr McMartin (76).    
 All 3 remembered how the town had     
 burst beyond its 19th Century         
 boundaries, expanding south-east into 
 Ashfield and westwards into           
 Summerfield, Belhaven Road and the    
 'Tree Scheme'. The High Street has    
 remained comparatively unchanged but  
 the Harbour area (scene of            
 overcrowding in the 1920's) has been  
 largely rebuilt.                      
   The two ladies noted that though the
 town had expanded, the social life had
 contracted - Dunbar was a garrison    
 town between the Wars and had a lively
 social life - military parades and    
 bands, concerts of a high standard,   
 Pierrot shows in the Pavilion, Silent 
 Movies in the 'Dreadnought' by the    
 Harbour. (continued on next page)     </content>
