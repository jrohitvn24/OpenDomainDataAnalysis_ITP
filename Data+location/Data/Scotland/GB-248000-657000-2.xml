		<title>02Health in Barrhead</title>
		<content>   Barrhead is well catered for in the 
 area of health.We are lucky to have a 
 new{health centre.}As well as doctors'
 surgeries the centre runs other       
 clinics needed by the public.         
  These{clinics}include family         
 planning,chiropody,ante and post natal
  units.                               
  There are four{dentists}currently    
 working in the town and in this age of
 realising how important it is to care 
 for teeth, they are kept very busy.   
  The health of the{handicapped}is     
 further cared for by a day centre     
 which provides care and suitable work 
 for both mentally and physically      
 handicapped people.
