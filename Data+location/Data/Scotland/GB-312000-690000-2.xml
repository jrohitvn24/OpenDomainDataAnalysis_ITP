 The community centre in Hill of Beath 
 isn't very big but it is big enough   
 for our small village.I go to the     
 youth club which is held in the centre
 every Tuesday,Friday and Saturday but 
 every second Saturday there is a      
 disco.In the youth club there are four
 youth leaders who give us activities  
 and games to play.The two most popular
 games are table_tennis and pool.On    
 Wednesday evenings there are Scottish 
 Country Dancing classes which quite a 
 few people go to.There are villagers  
 who run the Playscheme for local      
 children,arranging trips during the   
 summer holidays.The councillor for    
 Hill of Beath often holds meetings to 
 discuss community business.
