 recently planted coniferous area.     
 Generally the areas are small. There  
 are some 13 farms in the area.They

 potatoes and in one case some summer  
 fruit. There is a castle, privately   
 owned and lived in and two large      
 residential houses. Apart from the    
 farms there are farm cottages, a few  
 modern houses and other estate houses.

 undulating are with open views on
