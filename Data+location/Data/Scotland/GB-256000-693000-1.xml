		<title>01BUCHLYVIE LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> The village of{BUCHLYVIE}lies between 
 the town of{STIRLING}and the city of  
{GLASGOW}and is within easy reach of   
 the beautiful scenic areas of the {   
{TROSSACHS}and{LOCH LOMOND.}The        
 village is surrounded, in the main, by
 farmland, and, to a lesser extent, by 
{CONIFEROUS FOREST}and{PEAT BOG}to the 
 North West. In this one small block   
 there are thirteen farms, many of     
 which have been run by the same       
 families for decades. There is some   
 historical evidence to suggest that   
 the village of{BUCHLYVIE}was erected a
{BURGH OF BARONY}as early as{1554.}The 
 origin of the name is uncertain but it
 may have been derived from the Gaelic 
{"BOTH LARNEUCH"}which means 'House for
 shooting' or 'Fortified house' and    
 there are remains of{PICTISH} or      
{SCANDINAVIAN FORTS}in the area.
