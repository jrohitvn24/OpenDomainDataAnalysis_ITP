		<title>14PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> The children at our school play a lot 
 of different games at the interval and
 at lunchtime. One of these games is   
 called RELIEVERS. You need two teams  
 of children, one team chases the      
 other. Once a member of the team is   
 caught they go into the 'den' and they
 have to wait there until someone from 
 their own team taps them on the       
 shoulder and shouts 'tig', then they  
 are free. However if all of the team  
 are caught then it is the turn of the 
 team who did the chasing to now go and
 hide and the team who have been caught
 seek them out.                        
 Another game is CHINKS, similar to the
 high jump except that elastic bands   
 tied between two people are used      
 instead of a bar and two poles. Seven 
 different heights are used. The       
 winners are those who can jump the    
 highest.                              </content>
