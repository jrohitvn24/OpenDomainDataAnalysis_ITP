		<content>{Town Yetholm}has the only shops in    
 this locality, two general stores, a  
 Post Office, a butcher and a garage.  
 Both stores are on the Main Street,   
 one next to the garage, delivers milk 
 four days a week and sells health     
 foods. The second, opposite the Plough
 Hotel, sells newspapers, opens seven  
 days a week and employs part and      
 full-time staff.The butchers, near the
 Plough Hotel, own a shop in Morebattle
 and do a village and country run. The 
 garage sells petrol, new and second   
 hand cars and carries out general     
 repairs and servicing. The Post Office
 is in Craiglea House and is well used.
 The Bank of Scotland and The Royal    
 Bank of Scotland open for half a day  
 each week in separate houses. A       
 fishmonger comes from Eyemouth on     
 Thursdays and a mobile baker comes    
 three times per week.                 </content>
