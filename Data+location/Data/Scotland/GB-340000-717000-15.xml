		<content> On the thirty first of May 1985,      
 Primaries five six and seven went on  
 a country walk to Craigfoodie House.  
 At Craigfoodie House the gardener told
 us that part of the house was built in
 the seventeenth century. At the back  
 of the house there is a dove cot where
 the owners once kept pigeons to eat.  
 We went further up the hill to some   
 cottages and an old farm steading.    
 There was a pen where some goats were.
 On the way back we stopped to look at 
 oil seed rape,young barley and        
 potatoes growing in the fields. We    
 also saw sheep and cows grazing and   
 a farmer from a tractor getting water 
 from Moonzie Burn. Miss Smith stopped 
 to talk to the farmer.
