		<content> Church attendance has dropped         
 dramatically. With the influx caused  
 by Nigg many other creeds are         
 represented. Roman Catholic, Jehovah's
 Witnesses, Baptists now have churches 
 in Easter Ross. At the same time      
 perhaps about a quarter of the        
 population have no church affiliation 
 at all. Fifteen years ago every child 
 in school would automatically bring a 
 Bible to school for religious         
 instruction. Today it is common for a 
 child to say that there is not a Bible
 in their home                         
 Until 1947 there was a regular service
 in Gaelic in Hilton. Since then the   
 use of Gaelic in church has           
 disappeared as it has amongst the     
 general populace. The Free Church     
 minister is able to preach in Gaelic  
 but none of the other denominations   
 claim the use of Gaelic               </content>
