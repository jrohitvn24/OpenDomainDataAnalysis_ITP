		<title>07A DAY AT THE TOURIST OFFICE</title>
		<content> I went with the schoolbus at 8.10am,  
 arriving in good time, so I swept     
 floors and dusted shelves. I checked  
 to see who got Bed &amp; Breakfast from   
 the office yesterday.I looked to see  
 what kind of day Monday was: the sales
 and people in.Council came with boxes 
 of stock to count. Phone kept ringing 
 between jobs with hotel vacancies for 
 the day.                              
 Man in from Aboyne wondering about a  
 Book a Bed Ahead in England. Chap     
 asking about Railway show; why so few 
 signatures in the book?I must remember
 to ask people to sign it. Lady in     
 wanting to know where she would find  
 Tibetan gardens in Scotland. The only 
 clues were Sherriff, which was the    
 name of the owners in the 1920's and  
 that it was in Scotland. Can I find   
 out where it is? A frantic search in  
 Scotland's Gardens book but no luck.  </content>
