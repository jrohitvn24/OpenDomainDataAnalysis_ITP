		<content> When the 1863 railway line from       
 Aviemore to Forres was opened,Aviemore
 was a very small community.Old        
 Aviemore House,an inn with stables etc
 was the only large building though a  
 few cottages and crofts existed.The   
 nearest shop and Post Office were     
 situated at Lynwilg.Aviemore became an
 important{railway junction}in 1898    
 with the opening of the second line   
 through Carrbridge to Inverness.22    
 houses were built on the NE of the    
 village to house incoming railway     
 workers.Many of these houses still    
 exist today.With this further rail    
 development 2 hotels and several large
 guest houses were built to provide    
 accommodation for summer visitors.The 
 larger,luxurious Aviemore Hotel was   
 destroyed by fire in the early 1950s  
 but the Cairngorm Hotel is still a    
 popular choice with locals.           </content>
