		<content>  Primarily a rich farming area, the   
 land supports crops of barley some    
 cabbage fields and other root crops   
 and some dairy farming on rough       
 grazing land adjacent to the railway. 
 The large fields, bounded by hedges   
 present an undulating somewhat        
 monotonous landscape broken           
 occasionally by the scattered farm    
 steadings, small villages and isolated
 farm cottages. Housing is             
 traditionally single storey often     
 using traditional stone and clay      
 partiled roofs. Many of the farm      
 cotages are tithed. Drem is the main  
 village but suppose only as small     
 general store and sub post office.    
 Population would be no more than 100. 
 An historic site, Chesters Fort, lies 
 just south of Drem and to the west is 
 situated the Motor Museum. The main   
 trasport lines through the area       </content>
