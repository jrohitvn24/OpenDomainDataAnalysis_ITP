		<title>17A Day in Fionnuala's Life</title>
		<content>  At 7 a.m. I get up and dress  and  at
 7.30 a.m. I  have breakfast and  brush
 my hair. At 8 a.m. I make up my packed
 lunch for school and watch the news on
 TV.  Later I leave for school  and  go
 down the road to  collect  my  friend,
 Jennifer. This takes five minutes.    
  We walk to school and  wait  for  the
 bell to ring at 9 a.m.   First we have
 assembly when the  minister  comes  to
 the school. After assembly we do maths
 for an  hour.   Our  break  lasts  for
 fifteen minutes and then we go back in
 to have an art lesson. Our lunch break
 lasts for an hour. We go  in  at  1.30
 p.m. and do language assignments.   At
 2.35 p.m. we  have  P.E. and  at  3.15
 p.m. the bell  rings  and  we  all  go
 home.                                 
  After School I go to Gymnastics Club.
  At 7 p.m. I have dinner then I  watch
 TV and go to bed at ten o'clock.      </content>
