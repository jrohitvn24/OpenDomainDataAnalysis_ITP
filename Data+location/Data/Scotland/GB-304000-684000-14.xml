		<title>14CROSSFORD GALA (continued)</title>
		<content> The main event of Gala Week is Gala   
 Day itself, 1st June 1985. The King   
 George V playing fields in the village
 are transformed for the day by the    
 Gala committee. A marquee is erected  
 for the distribution of lunch-bags, an
 arena roped off for performers and    
 competitions, and stalls and          
 side-shows (manned by members of      
 village organisations) set up around  
 the edges of the park.                
    It all starts at 11a.m. as the     
 parade of children, and adults, in    
 fancy dress, begins at the eastern    
 edge of the village and continues for 
 half a mile along the Main Street, the
 parade being led by bands and by the  
 Gala Queen and her attendants.        
 Following the judging of fancy dress  
 and floats, the park becomes one huge 
 picnic site as villagers settle down  
 to enjoy the rest of he day.          </content>
