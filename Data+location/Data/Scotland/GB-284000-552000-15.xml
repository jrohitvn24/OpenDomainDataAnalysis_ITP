		<title>15Colvend: Local History</title>
		<content>   Man has undoubtedly lived in these  
 parts since Stone Age times but the   
 Motte of Mark is the earliest of our  
 ancient monuments. It was an Iron Age 
 fortress and stands on a hill near    
 Rockcliffe overlooking Rough Firth.   
   The most colourful period was in the
 days of the 18th Century smugglers.The
 Isle of Man was a distribution centre 
 for brandy,tea,salt and tobacco from  
 France.The smugglers came across the  
 Solway Firth and beached their ships  
 on the rocky Colvend shore.They hid   
 their merchandise in the caves along  
 the coast until it could be taken over
 the hills to Dumfries by "Longtownmen"
   The Customs and Excise men were     
 constantly on guard along the cliff   
 tops. At least one man is known to    
 have been shot by the Excisemen,and a 
 monument on Castlehill marks the spot 
 where another was drowned.            </content>
