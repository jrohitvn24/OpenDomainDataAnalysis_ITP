		<title>04UNUSUAL HOUSING IN MONKLANDS</title>
		<content>   In{Old Monklands}there are two      
                                       
 detached{Mock Tudor Houses.}They      
 are very different from the{four in a 
{block houses}in which we live  and    
 also those in the surrounding area.   
   In{1904,}a man called{Sholto Douglas
 built a large{Mission House}for his   
 wife in{Mock Tudor style.}Later it was
 divided into{two semi_detached houses.
 These houses are unique in the{Old    
{Monklands}area.                       
   The houses are made of{stone and    
{wood.}Inside{gas central heating}is   
 now used although when they were built
 heating was probably by{coal fires}as 
 this was a coal mining region.        
   Some of  the{furniture}is{Mock Tudor
 which is very much in keeping with the
 surroundings.
