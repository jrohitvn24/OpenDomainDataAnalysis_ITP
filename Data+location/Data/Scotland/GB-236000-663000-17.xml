		<title>17BRIDGE OF WEIR - FARMLAND</title>
		<content>   The{farm land}around{B.O.W}is mainly
 arable land, with a bit of rough      
 grazing.{High Auchensdale}is a dairy  
 farm owned by{Mr.R.Carruth,}which lies
 S.W.of B.O.W at about{500}ft.above sea
 level. The house dates from{1745,}but 
 the land has been farmed since{1923}by
 Mr.Carruth's family, he himself taking
 over from his father in{1967.         
  There is a covering of light loam    
 soil, which is good land if it is well
 fed. The size of the farm has grown   
 from{118 acres}to{240 acres}present   
 day, and 240 acres are also rented for
 summer grazing.                       
  Mr.Carruth runs the farm with the    
 help of his wife and an agricultural  
 student, who is there for a year prior
 to college. His{3}sons help on a      
 part-time basis. Hopefully one of them
 will carry on the family tradition at 
 High Auchensdale.                     </content>
