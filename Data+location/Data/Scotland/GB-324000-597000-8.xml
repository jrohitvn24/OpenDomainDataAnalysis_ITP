		<title>08OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH</title>
		<content> With the decline of sheep farming and 
 the emphasis on forestry,employement  
 on farms has decreased.Mechanised     
 farming attracts the young  ,is now a 
 skilled job , and is eagerly sought.  
 Less popular with the young is        
 shepherding, although again mechanised
 transport eliminates weary miles of   
 trudging on foot over rough hill land 
 and some young lads still feel the    
 call of sheep and become dedicated    
 shepherds and eventually flockmasters.
  Haulage is necessary for both farming
 and forestry , and the mechanically   
 minded find great satisfaction doing  
 this The only disadvantage , as one   
 young haulier put it is distance from 
 town."I intend to marry soon. My      
 fiancee works in town fifteen miles   
 away .Fifteen miles of snow and a 9am 
 deadline to meet!".But we wont live in
 town!".                               </content>
