		<content> The  girls think there should be      
 hockey teams for them only as the boys
 have shinty teams.Nearly everybody    
 would like to see improvements on our 
 roads for safety reasons.The boys     
 would like better football and shinty 
 pitches and BMX tracks in this        
 area.Other people would like to see   
 youth centres and swimming pools      
 nearer to us.Some people would like   
 farmers to improve their fences as    
 sheep can escape and spoil gardens.   
 Boys would like to see rifle          
 clubs,where they could practice with  
 their air rifles.
