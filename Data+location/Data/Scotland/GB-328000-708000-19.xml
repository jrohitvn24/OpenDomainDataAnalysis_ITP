		<title>19HOWE OF FIFE</title>
		<content>{The Howe of Fife is a naturally       
{fertile valley sheltered from the West
{&amp; East by the Lomond and Kettle Hills.
 It is a{rich farming area with a large
{part of the land covered in coniferous
{woods. In March &amp; April the winds are 
{very strong blowing the top soil from 
{the fields across Ladybank, sometimes 
{blocking the roads.}This problem will 
{increase as the trees are being felled
 having reached{maturity. Ecologists   
 are{concerned about the effects on    
{wildlife, especially  the deer.}The   
{Sand &amp; Gravel Co.}are expanding       
{rapidly extracting large quantities of
{sand and gravel required for building 
{purposes. The river Eden flows through
{the valley from west to east heading  
{for St. Andrews Bay where it flows    
{into the North Sea. The river is used 
 for trout fishing and irrigation.
