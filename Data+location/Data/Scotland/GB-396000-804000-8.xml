		<title>08THE WORK OF A HARBOUR PILOT</title>
		<content> Most vessels,apart from trawlers have 
 to take a pilot onboard to navigate   
 them in and out of the harbour.       
 The pilot is taken out in a launch to 
 meet the incoming vessels.In choppy   
 seas it can be quite dangerous        
 clambering aboard but on warm sunny   
 days it seems to be a idyllic job!    
 The 10 pilots work shifts of twelve   
 hours now that Aberdeen is a 24 hour  
 harbour due to increased shipping     
 demands.The harbour can accomodate up 
 to 50 supply vessels and a pilot can  
 expect to deal with 20 vessels a      
 day.Some companies prefer to use      
 Peterhead Harbour since they dont     
 have to use pilots and berthing costs 
 are lower.It is the privilidge of the 
 longest serving pilot to bring in the 
 Royal Yacht 'Britannia' on her annual 
 visit to Aberdeen when the Royal      
 Family are in residence at Balmoral.  </content>
