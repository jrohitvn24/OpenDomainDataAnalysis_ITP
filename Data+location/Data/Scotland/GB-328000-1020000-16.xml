 This programme is about seven men     
 working on a building site in Germany.
 They are from Liverpool and I like    
 their accents. It is funny and I like 
 the way things work out for them.     
{"Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds" 
{(cartoon)                             
 I like "Dogtanian" because it has good
 characters. It is about their life in 
 France protecting the Queen's jewels. 
 I like the mouse which makes plans    
 that never work and the Muske which   
 shouts "All for one, and one for all!"
{"The Young Ones"                      
 This is a comedy about four men who   
 live in an old battered house; Rick,  
 Mike, Neil and Vivian. They do silly  
 things like putting the hamster in the
 toaster and fixing a bomb to the      
 doorbell so that they can hear it.
