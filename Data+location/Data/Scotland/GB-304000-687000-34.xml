<content>

Our Parish Minister is the Rev. Ian Thom. Before becoming a minister he was a chemist. The Rev. Thom is the minister at the North Parish Church in Golfdrum Street. He comes to school to speak at our assemblies. Some of his other duties include arranging weddings and funerals. He enjoys everything that he does at the church especially weddings, as these are happy occasions. The Rev. Thom gets 6 days off every year for his holidays and he visits other churches.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
