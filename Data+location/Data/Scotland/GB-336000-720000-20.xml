		<title>20Playground Game</title>
		<content> Our most popular playground game is   
{Exie.}You start by using a counting   
 rhyme to find who is IT.Once this is  
 decided IT counts to ten while the    
 others scatter and hide.After IT has  
 counted he goes looking for the       
 others.If IT sees one of the others he
 shouts "bang" and the person's name   
 and that person must stay still.As IT 
 moves away the other people run and   
 try to get to the den without being   
 seen.The people who are in the den    
 make a chain to touch and free the    
 people who are caught .The people who 
 have made it home safely to the den   
 can go out again without being seen   
 also to free people.If everyone is    
 caught the person who was caught      
 first becomes IT.This game usualy     
 takes a long time to complete.
