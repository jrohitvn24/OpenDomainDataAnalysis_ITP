		<title>19POLICE VISIT TO CLERMISTON</title>
		<content> One of the concerns the police have is
 to protect children.  One day recently
 two policemen came to our school to   
 remind us of the dangers of going with
 strangers.  They first told us that   
 there is no way to distinguish bad    
 people from others; they are not all  
 men;  they do not all live alone and  
 they do not all wear glasses.  We were
 shown a film in which a girl was      
 waiting outside a school for her mum. 
 A man in a car drove up and offered   
 her some sweets.  He said he knew she 
 wasn't supposed to talk to strangers, 
 but that he wasn't a stranger.  He    
 offered her a lift and she accepted   
 though she should have said no.  The  
 man took her to his own house and     
 attacked her. Her parents were very   
 worried, but she was lucky because    
 someone heard her scream and she was  
 discovered.  {SAY NO TO STRANGERS.}   </content>
