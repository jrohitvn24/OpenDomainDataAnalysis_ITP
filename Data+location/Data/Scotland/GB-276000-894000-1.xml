		<content> There are two large farms on the coast
 of the mixed type. Barley, oats,      
 grass, sheep and beef cattle. There   
 are few crofts on the upper land      
 growing similar things.               
 The two small forestry plantations are
 mainoy of Sitka and Larch. A pleasant 
 walk has been made through Skello     
 wood.                                 
 Loch Fleet is a large estuary with    
 extensive mud flats at low tide nd    
 many types of waders and sea birds can
 be found here.  In June and July      
 salmon can be seen heading up river,  
 though numbers have declined in recent
 years. Also the occasional grey seal  
 looking for fish. The hospital at     
 Cambusarie was bult for TB            
 patients,but is now used for          
 geriatrics.
