		<title>02ARTS &amp; CRAFTS FORRES WEST</title>
		<content> In Forres there is an institute called
 the Findhorn Foundation.This is a     
 place where people from all over the  
 world come and pay to stay there and  
 be employed.It is quite an expensive  
 place to stay at,so some who can      
 afford it stay for a long time.       
 The Findhorn Foundation has a small   
 craft shop selling among other things 
 small pieces of craft work made by the
 lodgers themselves.                   
 The grounds are picturesque and lovely
 especialy when summer comes round and 
 the flowers bloom.The gardens are not 
 private and are free for anyone to    
 take a stroll through.                
 The house surrounded by the beautiful 
 gardens looks spectacular just visible
 over the wooded rise of Cluny Hill.   
 Many people from other countries meet 
 each other,find out about other places
 and make long,lasting friendships.    </content>
