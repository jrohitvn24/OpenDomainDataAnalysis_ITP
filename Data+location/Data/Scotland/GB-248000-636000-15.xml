		<title>15HOUSING-GALSTON</title>
		<content> Housing patterns in Galston reveal a  
 very clear pattern of growth relating 
 to the historical controls which have 
 influenced the town.The central area, 
 dating mainly from the late 19th C has
 Victorian red and white sandstone     
 buildings with several examples of    
 Georgian architecture.The Victorian   
 buildings take the form of imposing   
 buildings e.g. Sharps hosiery factory 
 and St. Sophia's R.C. Chapel, semi-   
 detached and detached villas and      
 miners' rows.The latter have been     
 either demolished or completely       
 renovated leaving only the exterior   
 intact.There is a large inter-war     
 council housing estate and more recent
 private estates built in the last 20  
 years.There are plans to modernise and
 expand both sectors. Based on the most
 recent census Galston has 67% council 
 and 33% private housing.              </content>
