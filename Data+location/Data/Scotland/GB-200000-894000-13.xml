		<title>13HOUSES ON SCORAIG</title>
		<content> NEARLY ALL PEOPLE ON SCORAIG HAVE     
 HOUSES MADE OF TORRIDONIAN SANDSTONE, 
 BECAUSE IT IS PLENTIFUL,TRADITIONAL   
 AND PRACTICAL. SOME PEOPLE WERE ABLE  
 TO USE TRADITIONAL CROFT HOUSES BUT   
 OTHERS HAVE REBUILT RUINS AND         
 RE-ROOFED THEM WITH CORRUGATED IRON OR
 SLATES.MANY HAVE ADDED EXTENSIONS AS  
 THE ORIGINAL HOUSES WERE QUITE SMALL. 
 THE EXTENSIONS ARE OF DIFFRENT DESIGN 
 AND MATERIALS,SUCH AS STONE TIMBER AND
 CONCRETE.ALL TIMBER HAS TO BE BOUGHT  
 AND FERRIED ACROSS THE LOCH AS DO THE 
 OTHER BUILDING MATERIALS.             
    SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE BOUGHT SITE    
 HUTS,DEMOLISHED THEM,FERRIED THEM,AND 
 RE-ERECTED THEM AS HOMES OR WORKSHOPS.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
