  "The first sighting was on 12th      
 August 1969.                          
 .It was at a layby three miles        
 from {Dores}.I saw both the neck and  
 the hump.It was the grey colour of an 
 elephant.{Nessie}was half a mile away,
 too far for my camera.I recall that   
 water was cascading down from its     
 back, like a small waterfall."        
{Ronald MacLennan of MacLennan,The Old 
{Mill,Dores.}                          
 "The last time I saw {Nessie} was in  
 September 1983.The monster was about  
 150 metres from the shore in front of 
 our window.It looked like a large     
 submarine,black with additions,like   
 wheel tyres,the monster was about 40 -
 45 feet long.The monster stayed in    
 sight for about 2 minutes."
