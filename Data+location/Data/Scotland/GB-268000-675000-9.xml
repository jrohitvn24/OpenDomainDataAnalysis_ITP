		<title>09TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES</title>
		<content>      In Kilsyth in 1795 there were    
 quite a lot of industries such as     
 weaving,quarrying,farming,and mining. 
 Other people worked as masons,        
 blacksmiths or coopers.               
                                       
     Nowadays people don't work at     
 these jobs apart from farming. Few    
 people  work in their own area. There 
 are only about three big              
 companies in our area.Those three are 
 Nuttalls,Tube Developments and        
 George Beattie &amp; Sons. Mines are      
 not very common now.People don't work 
 as weavers or spinners either. Now    
 people work as lorry drivers, joiners,
 prison officers and so on.            
                                       
     Many people are unemployed,       
 especially teenagers who have just    
 left school.
