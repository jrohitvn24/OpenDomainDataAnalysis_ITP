		<title>19RECREATION AROUND HOWNAM</title>
		<content> The people who live in this area,near 
 the village of Hownam in the Scottish 
 Borders,do not regularly travel far   
 from home for entertainments sake. Not
 one goes to play bingo,and less than a
 quarter visit a public house often.   
 Most people only go out for a meal or 
 dancing occasionally, and only the    
 young adults travel to take part in   
 outdoor sports or swimming.About half 
 of the people play indoor sports,which
 is mainly the bowling at Hownam. Most 
 play cards or board games,about a     
 third go for walks,make jigsaws or do 
 home improvements.Almost half enjoy   
 photography,and 7 do flower arranging.
 A few do crosswords,painting,riding,  
 carpentry,fishing,painting,D.I.Y, or  
 bird watching,and 4 play a musical    
 instrument.There are 2 shepherds who  
 show sheep and 1 farmer who runs dogs 
 at many of the local shows.           </content>
