		<content> The School was built in the middle of 
 the nineteenth century and was a      
 two-teacher school with about 50      
 pupils.At that time the pupils        
 remained at the same school until they
 were 14. The roll fluctuated between  
 50 and 30 pupils, becoming eventually 
 a one-teacher school. However, a few  
 years later, with the influx of       
 children, it again became a           
 two-teacher school. From August,1985, 
 the school will be once again a       
 one-teacher school with a roll        
 standing at 16. The school is         
 sometimes closed for a few days in    
 winter because of snow. None of the   
 children need transport. The          
 atmosphere of the school is pleasant  
 and relaxed and visitors are made very
 welcome.
