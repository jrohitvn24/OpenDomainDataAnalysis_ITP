		<title>02FAMILY LIFE IN GULLANE</title>
		<content> Most fathers or mothers in the family 
 go to work in Edinburgh.They go by the
 family car,the company car or train.  
 Some others go to work in Gullane or  
 neighbouring villages and towns.      
 One hundred and sixty children attend 
 the local primary school.When they    
 leave primary school the majority of  
 them go to North Berwick High School. 
 Children travelling to the primary    
 school usually walk because Gullane is
 a small place.The children amuse      
 themselves with sports, clubs and     
 occasionally discos.                  
 Many families own a dog and enjoy     
 taking it for a walk.It is popular    
 because there is a lot of open space, 
 including the beach and the golf      
 course.In the evenings most families  
 watch television or go to clubs.The   
 popular clubs are swimming,tennis,    
 bowling and golf.                     </content>
