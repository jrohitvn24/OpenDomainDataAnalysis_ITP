		<content> Sinclairs Bakery was started in 1883  
 by Mrs. Andrew's grandfather and has  
 now been sold on her retirement. She  
 has now moved to Sunny Banl Bogie     
 Road, Rhynie. She has lived in Rhynie 
 for all of her 62 years. She said her 
 life was poorer than ours but she     
 enjoyed it. She notices the changes in
 Rhynie, like the shops.  There used to
 be many more shops including two      
 butchers, a shoemakers and a barber.  
 With the changes in the shops she has 
 noticed changes in the leisure in     
 Rhynie. There used to be a golf       
 course, tennis court, and a putting   
 green. The golf was situated at the   
 Mains of Rhynie, the putting in the   
 square and the tennis next to the     
 football pitch. She would like to see 
 more shops and more pleasures for the 
 young and Rhynie.
