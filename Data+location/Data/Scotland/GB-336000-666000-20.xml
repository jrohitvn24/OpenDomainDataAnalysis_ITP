		<title>20PETS - HOBBIES IN COUSLAND</title>
		<content> IN A SURVEY OF 35 CHILDREN IN OUR     
 VILLAGE SCHOOL, WE FOUND OUT THESE    
 FACTS.                                
 THE MOST POPULAR PETS WERE DOGS AND   
 CATS - 23 DOGS AND 20 CATS.  TROPICAL 
 FISH WERE OWNED BY 9 PEOPLE, HAMSTERS,
 HORSES AND RABBITS BY 2 PEOPLE.       
 OTHERS HAD HENS, OR A PHEASANT.  TWO  
 PEOPLE HAD THREE PETS, BUT 7 PEOPLE   
 HAD NO PETS.                          
 THE MOST POPULAR HOBBIES WERE RIDING, 
 FOOTBALL AND SWIMMING.  OTHER PEOPLE  
 LIKED COMPUTERS, FISHING, CYCLING,    
 READING OR DRAWING.                   
 MOST OF US LIKE TO WATCH TELEVISION IN
 OUR SPARE TIME.  THE FAVOURITE        
 PROGRAMMES ARE A CARTOON CALLED       
 "DOGTANION" BASED ON THE STORY "THE   
 THREE MUSKETEERS", AN AMERICAN SERIES 
 CALLED "STREET HAWK", ABOUT A SECRET  
 MOTOR-CYCLE DETECTIVE.  ALL KINDS OF  
 CARTOONS WERE POPULAR WITH EVERYONE.  </content>
