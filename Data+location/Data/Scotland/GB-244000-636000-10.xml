		<title>10A HOSPITAL IN KILMARNOCK</title>
		<content>{Kirklandside Hospital}was built in    
 1910. It is a{Geriatric Hospital.     
 There are 109 staff employed.         
 Thirty-four of the staff are full-time
 and seventy-five are part-time. The   
 staff in the hospital is composed of  
 trained and untrained nurses,         
 domestics, catering and porters. In   
 the hospital there are four wards.    
 The day we visited it,there were 107  
 patients. Since it can actually       
 accomodate 108, it was therefore more 
 or less full. The most common illness 
 is general debility. There are no     
 operating theatres. If people are     
 very ill, they go to other hospitals  
 for operations. According to the staff
 the hospital is not very well         
 equipped. The head porter looks after 
 the grounds, which seemed very        
 pleasant.
