		<title>01 UNEMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Unemployment in this area is          
extremely  high.Our area is situated in
a region    which has among the        
highest unemployment figures in        
Britain.Because companies prefer to be 
closer to the big cities,where they    
can get trade more easily,they situate 
themselves nearer to Glasgow.The       
opening of Prestwick Circuits factory  
and the SCI computer factory in        
neighbouring Irvine has helped to      
reduce the figures slightly.           
Springside is an old mining village    
and when the mines closed,most of the  
villagers found themselves without     
jobs to go to.Many of the people in    
this area will have to travel outside  
the district to find employment. There 
is plenty of work in this area if you  
happen to be a farmer.There are        
approximately twelve farms and also    
various small holdings.                </content>
