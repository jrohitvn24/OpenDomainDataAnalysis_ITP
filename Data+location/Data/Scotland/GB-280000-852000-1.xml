		<content>    {Gollanfield}area is mainly farm-  
 land.A railway runs through it and so 
 does an important road.The road{(A96) 
 links{Inverness}and{Nairn.            
    There are two Lochs,{Loch          
{Flemington}and the{Loch of the Clans} 
 where many birds  nest such as{Herons 
{Ducks}and even the{Osprey}.Beside the 
 Loch of the Clans,lie the{Kames,}which
 are thought to have been formed in the
{Ice Age}.There are some remains of a  
 lake village {(Crannog)}.There are no 
 rivers,just some streams .            
    We are near {Dalcross }airport     
 which is very intresting and          
 convenient if you wish to {travel}.The
 nearest town is {Ardersier }which is  
 two kilometres away.                  
   There are some {Tourist }           
 attractions including a {Pottery }    
 where you can see a potter at work.
