		<title>12   Rose Queen Day</title>
		<content> Every year Leven Civic Week starts off
 with the crowning of the Rose Queen.  
 After she is crowned she leads the    
 parade of coloured floats and people  
 dressed in fancy dress costumes down  
 Leven High Street.                    
   I am in the majorettes and we were  
 taking part in the parade.On Friday   
 night we practised our street parade  
 until it was perfect.                 
   The next morning, Saturday the 15th 
 June we met at Denbeath Scout hall and
 put our costumes on.Before going to   
 Leven we did a display for the scouts 
   Nicola Mcintosh was crowned Rose    
 Queen and then her cavalcade made its 
 way through the town followed by the  
 floats.There was one carrying a jazz  
 band,a Mad Hatter's tea party,a pirate
 ship with a damsel in distress but    
 Scoonie Church won with their Muppet  
 show.                                 </content>
