		<content> Most of the clubs are well supported. 
 All age groups are catered for, though
 a survey indicated a lack of provision
 for 14-17 year olds in St.Boswells.   
     The organisations generally meet  
 in the Village Halls or Schools.      
 Newtown has its own Community Centre. 
 In the Arts there are few clubs.Anyone
 interested in operatic singing must   
 travel to Melrose, Gala or Kelso. St. 
 Boswells boasts a 35 piece silver band
 which has members from both villages. 
 A drama group meets weekly to produce 
 an annual play, and the P.F.A.        
 produces a pantomime every two years. 
     Many of the recreational          
 activities are seasonal.People tend to
 be members of more than one club, and 
 fund-raising depends upon mutual      
 support.                              
    Despite the many clubs,many people 
 prefer to travel for entertainment.   </content>
