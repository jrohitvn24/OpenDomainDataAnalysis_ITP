		<title>05Recreation In Bathgate</title>
		<content>    Balbardie Park is a place to go to 
 practise sports.   As well as having  
 two football pitches, where Bathgate  
 Thistle play, there is also a golf    
 course.   In the last two years there 
 have been new things added onto the   
 park.   Last year a B.M.X. track was  
 opened and some people from our school
 had a race to open the track.   This  
 year a new running track has been     
 made.                                 
    As well as all those sports        
 facilities there are also the normal  
 swings and a chute, just as you would 
 expect to find in a park.   On top of 
 all that, there is a massive piece of 
 open land with some bushes and trees  
 scattered all over the place.   Our   
 school sometimes uses Balbardie Park  
 for things like football and rounders.
