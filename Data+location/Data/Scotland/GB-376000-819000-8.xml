		<title>08RIVER DON INVERURIE</title>
		<content> The River Don flows through Inverurie 
 on its way to Aberdeen, where it flows
 into the North Sea.                   
                                       
 A tributary, the River Urie, meets the
 Don at Inverurie. Both rivers are     
 popular with anglers. Trout are the   
 main fish in the Urie, while salmon   
 can be caught in the Don.             
                                       
 The Inverurie Bridge leads the traffic
 over the Don at the south end of the  
 town. Below the bridge, on the banks  
 of the river pathways have been laid  
 out so that walks can be made along   
 the riverside. A few benches have been
 set out along these pathways and many 
 local people, as well as visitors,    
 take advantage of these on warm summer
 days. Children enjoy swimming in the  
 river near the bridge in summer.
