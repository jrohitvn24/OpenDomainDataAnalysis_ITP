		<content> Thurso's Tourist Information Centre   
 has been in operation for seven and a 
 half years, firstly in the Town Hall  
 and then down by the riverside. About 
 1500 people visit it every year,mostly
 in July and August. The Centre is open
 from April to October, 10.00 to 18.00 
 and from 09.00 to 19.00 in July and   
 August.  Tourists visit the area for  
 the spectacular scenery and historic  
 buildings, such as Old St. Peter's    
 Church,the museums and the Meadow Well
 One museum is in the Town Library and 
 the other, showing life in Thurso long
 ago, is beside the Town Hall.  Most   
 visitors come from the continent but  
 the furthest travellers came from New 
 Zealand. Sporting facilities offered  
 are golf, river fishing, sea angling  
 and surfing. For entertainment,       
 visitors prefer music by Scottish     
 Dance Bands.                          </content>
