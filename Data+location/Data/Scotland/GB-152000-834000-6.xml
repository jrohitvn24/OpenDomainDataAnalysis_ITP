		<content> A CROFT IS A SMALL HOLDING.USUALLY IT 
 HAS ABOUT 40 TO 60 ACHRES OF LAND IN  
 IT.A CROFT IS MUCH SMALLER THAN A     
 FARM.A CROFT HAS A COMMON GRAZING     
 DETACHED TO IT.IF YOU WERE GOING TO   
 START BEING A CROFTER YOU WOULD HAVE  
 TO SEE IF THERE WAS A CROFT AVALIABLE.
 CROFTING IS QUITE A HARD JOB YOU HAVE 
 TO REAR THE SHEEP AND THE CATTLE.AND  
 SOMETIMES YOU GROW CROPS LIKE         
 POTATOES,GRASS AND OATS.ONCE A YEAR   
 YOU WOULD SHEER THE SHEEP AND DIP     
 THEM.ONE PERSON COULD RUN A CROFT IF  
 HE WAS FIT.SHEEP,COWS AND SOMETINES   
 HORSES ARE ON CROFTS.                 
 THE CROFTERS SELL THERE ANIMALS       
 BETWEEN OCTOBER AND SEPTEMBER. THE    
 VEHICALS YOU NEED ON A CROFT ARE A    
 TRACTOR OR A LAND_ROVER ON IT.CROFTS  
 DO NOT USUALLY HAVE THE SAME THINGS ON
 THEM.ON RAASAY THERE ARE ABOUT 20 TO  
 30 CROFTS.                            </content>
