		<content>    THERE ARE ELEVEN CHILDREN IN OUR   
 SCHOOL.   WE HAVE ONLY ONE TEACHER AND
 ALL AGES IN ONE ROOM.   WE HAVE TWO   
 CLASSROOMS.   ONE WE WORK IN AND ONE  
 WE PLAY IN.                           
    WE START SCHOOL AT HALF-PAST NINE  
 AND GO HOME AT HALF PAST THREE.   WE  
 HAVE TWO PLAY TIMES.                  
    THE SCHOOLHOUSE AND KITCHEN ARE    
 JOINED TO THE SCHOOL.   THERE IS A    
 HATCH THROUGH TO THE KITCHEN WHERE    
 JEAN THE COOK PASSES THROUGH ALL WE   
 NEED FOR LUNCH.   AFTER WE HAVE SAID  
 GRACE, JEAN PUTS OUT THE LUNCH.   TWO 
 CHILDREN SERVE.                       
    WE HAVE AN OPEN AIR SWIMMING POOL  
 AND PORTA-CABIN FOR CHANGING AT THE   
 BACK OF THE SCHOOL, BUT WE CAN ONLY   
 USE THIS IN SUMMER.                   
    I LIKE WEDNESDAYS ESPECIALLY,      
 BECAUSE WE HAVE P.E. AND ART.
