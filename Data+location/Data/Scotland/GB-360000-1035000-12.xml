		<content>  During the summer of{1983}a team of  
{archaeologists}from the{University of 
{Bradford}dug trial trenches to find   
 the site of the settlement. When they 
 uncovered the area, they exposed a    
 complex of buildings, which were      
 extremely well preserved. The         
 buildings consisted of{six}individual 
{house-like areas,}all conected through
 a labyrinth of{passage-ways}and       
{chambers. Doorways, steps, hearths}and
 a{floor}were found still{intact,}which
 gave great insight into{Iron Age      
{architecture and living conditions.}A 
 very significant find, which was made 
 in the summer of 1984, was what is    
 known as the{Ogam Stone.}It is a stone
 which was inscribed with letters of   
 the Ogam alphabet,which was thought to
 have originated in the{fourth century 
{A.D.
