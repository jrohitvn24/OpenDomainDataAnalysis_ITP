		<content>  St Anns church is linked with Westray
 Parish  Church. On Sunday the Church  
 of Scotland minister, the Rev. David  
 Dutton, crosses by boat to conduct the
 service. During the winter months when
 the sea  is rough Rev. Dr.A.C.Dow,    
 a retired minister who is resident on 
 the island and has served the church  
 for 60 years, takes the service. Hymn 
 singing is held on a Sunday night and 
 this is conducted by Mr J. Rendall.   
         There is also a Gospel Hall in
 which members of the Bretheren hold   
 their  meetings, these are taken by   
 lay preachers.
