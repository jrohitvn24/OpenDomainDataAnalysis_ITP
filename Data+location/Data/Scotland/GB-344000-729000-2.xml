		<content>{STANDARDS} Broughty Ferry residents   
 are immensely keen to retain their    
 independence and keep their suburb as 
 individual as possible.  The standard 
 of appearance of the houses, gardens, 
 Parks, beach and shopping centres is  
 indicative of this wish.              
{DOGS IN PARKS}Dogs roaming freely have
 recently caused a nuisance in parks   
 where children play.  Restrictions and
 heavier fines have been imposed to act
 as a deterrent.                       
{DEVELOPMENTS} Residents are quick to  
 form action groups to present their   
 attitudes in relation to developments 
 in the area. Meetings are speedily    
 arranged by residents to discuss any  
 proposed developments.
