		<title>18LAW AND ORDER IN CRUDEN BAY.</title>
		<content> There is a Police Station in Cruden   
 Bay with one Constable stationed in   
 the house adjoining it.When the local 
 constable,is not available police will
 come from Boddam or Peterhead.The     
 village is patrolled by a police car  
 and occasionally on foot , by the     
 local constable.                      
             There is little or no     
 vandalism in Cruden Bay,but youngsters
 on motor bikes sometimes disturb the  
 peace by riding around late at night. 
 When something like the 'Gala' is on  
 extra police and also special         
 constables are brought in.            
  When there is a 'disco' in the       
 Village Hall,the police keep an eye on
 the proceedings.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
