		<title>07Oldmeldrum School system</title>
		<content> During 1984 and 1985 teachers in      
 Meldrum School joined teachers        
 throughout Scotland in intermittent   
 strike action for better conditions,  
 disrupting education in the primary   
 school. The effect was to create a    
 lack of continuity felt especially in 
 the early stages i.e. children aged   
 4-7.  Parents in and around Oldmeldrum
 joined in the campaign, not only to   
 help the local teachers achieve their 
 aims but by using the pressure on     
 Grampian's Director of Education to   
 call for a better system of child     
 supervision. Children in Meldrum      
 School at the end of 1985 are still   
 not supervised in the playgrounds     
 during breaks.  Many parents found    
 this unacceptable and wrote to        
 education authorities, local          
 councillors and the Liberal MP for the
 District.                             </content>
