		<title>12FLOOD DAMAGE NEAR MENSTRIE</title>
		<content> Between the 3rd and 4th of November   
 1984, the Hillfoots underwent their   
 worst{disaster}for many years.        
 As a result of very heavy rain the    
 Carnaughton burn flooded,{landslides  
 began, main pipes failed to work which
 resulted in the Cleuch estates sewage 
 system overflowing. The{flooding}took 
 place at such speed that many         
 villagers were taken completely by    
 surprise. Many home accesories were   
 destroyed such as carpets, cookers    
 and furniture. The dispersing water   
 left a layer of black silt which      
 covered many homes. Menstrie burn also
 burst its banks on the same night. It 
 didn't have such devastating effects  
 as it did in Alva but the force of    
 water was great enough to uproot large
 trees.
