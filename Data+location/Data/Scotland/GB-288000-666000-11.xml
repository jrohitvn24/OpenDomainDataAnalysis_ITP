		<title>11Mining in Blackridge</title>
		<content>    The only trace of the pits are the 
 memories of the workers alive today,  
 the bings and{old railway}tracks.     
    The bings are spread all around    
{Blackridge. }But at the moment cranes 
 and trucks are removing the bings to  
 nearby{power stations. }These bings   
 are made up from silt from the        
 settling ponds.  Silt is coal dust.   
 The silt goes into ponds and the water
 dries and that's how the bings are    
 formed.                               
    There were six different pits in   
 Blackridge at one time.  The names of 
 these pits were Westrigg, Blackridge  
 New Pit No3, Standhill, Woodend,      
 Netherton Mine and Blairmuckhill.     
 Once a pit shut down the miners would 
 be transferred to another pit.  The   
 only other proof is the old miners'   
 cottages. {Westcraigs}is a row of     
 many old cottages.                    </content>
