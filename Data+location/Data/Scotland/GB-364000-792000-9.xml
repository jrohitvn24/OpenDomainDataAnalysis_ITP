		<title>09STRACHAN SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school is just off the B976 road. 
 It was built in 1876. The school is   
 heated by an old boiler in the west   
 classroom.The teacher puts coal on    
 during the day.                       
 There are 10 boys and 11 girls.Seven  
 more are starting in August.Some      
 children come to school by taxi.      
 There are two classrooms.We do not    
 have a hall.We have to use the village
 hall for P.E. and go there by taxi.   
 There are 2 teachers and some         
 specialist teachers visit.            
 We have to go outside to the canteen  
 and sometimes we get wet.Our meals    
 come in containers.                   
 We have 3 big old trees in our play   
 ground.Beside it is the school house  
 (1907) now bought by the recently     
 retired headmaster.Our school is very 
 old but we have a lot modern          
 equipment.                            </content>
