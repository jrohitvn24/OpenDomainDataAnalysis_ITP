		<title>08THE VILLAGE JEWELLER</title>
		<content> My father Mr.A.C.Reid has been a      
 jeweller in Dairsie for twenty years. 
 He makes his own jewellery and some-  
 times my mum helps with the designs.  
 A while ago he made a small silver    
 plane and I am trying to make an      
 aeroplane the same. The aeroplane I am
 making is going to be made of brass   
 and when it has been polished by a    
 buff it will be lacquered. The work-  
 shop is full of expensive tools and   
 equipment. The rolling mill is very   
 expensive it flattens pieces of metal.
 Other tools are the piercing saw, hand
 graver,chasing tools,scribe,drill,    
 shears,needle files,torch,vice,riffler
 file,centre punch. Every time the Open
 Golf tournament comes to St.Andrews my
 Dad makes jewellery to go on show.    
 Last time he made a rose which had a  
 lot of detail.
