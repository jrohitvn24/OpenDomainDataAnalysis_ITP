		<title>15Johnstone: Bus Service</title>
		<content> One day we went to the bus garage at  
 Milliken Park. There were 53 buses in 
 the station, 17 of which were long    
 distance coaches.                     
 Mr Gordon the depot manager, told us  
 that it costs Â£70,000 for a new double
 decker coach, but Â£5,000 could buy a  
 reconditioned bus from London         
 Transport. A new window for one costs 
 Â£400. They clean the vehicles every   
 six weeks with a steam cleaner. Each  
 bus has to make on average, Â£1.26 per 
 mile to make a profit. The tyres on   
 the vehicles last only 4000 miles and 
 then they are recut, but these recut  
 ones cannot be used on the front      
 wheels.                               
 The buses are at the moment being     
 painted a dark red and bright yellow  
 livery as they are becoming Clydeside 
 Buses; if the Transport Bill is passed
 all services will be privatised.      </content>
