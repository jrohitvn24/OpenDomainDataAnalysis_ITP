		<title>03 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF STUART</title>
		<content> I live at Ellick Farm which is 4 miles
 from Tomintoul.I get up at 7 o'clock  
 in the morning.On Fridays I get into  
 school with Skene's buses who are     
 based at the bottom of Tomintoul.On   
 every other day I get into school with
 my mum.In winter we take the          
 Land-Rover as the conditions are too  
 bad for any car to get through.On our 
 way to school in winter we have to    
 battle through drifts of snow up to 3 
 feet high.In the summer of 1984 we    
 were filmed by Thames Television for  
 CBTV and during the winter CBTV       
 showed the program nationwide to      
 show the contrast between summer and  
 winter.Our road is usually blocked as 
 the snowploughs are too busy clearing 
 the famous A939 Cockbridge to         
 Tomintoul to clear our roads.Our road 
 is rough for about 1 quarter of a     
 mile and then it becomes a single-lane</content>
