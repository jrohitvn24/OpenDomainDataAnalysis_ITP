		<content> Mr Edgar has been farming for 23      
 years. He has 196 acres, 155 acres of 
 arable, 40 acres of rough grazing,    
 including Threave Island and woods,   
 one acre for roads, buildings etc.    
 The National Trust took 7 acres in    
 1974. They planted trees and made a   
 car park for visitors to Threave      
 Castle.                               
 The main crop is grass. Mr Edgar does 
 not employ full time workers but he   
 employs people at busy times such as  
 harvest. The animals he has are sheep,
 store cattle and multi-suckling cows. 
 In the future he thinks it will be    
 difficult because people are buying   
 less dairy produce. Farms will be more
 computerised.
