		<title>05FIRE STATION,ANNAN</title>
		<content> The fire station in Standalane        
 was built in 1983 to replace the      
 old one in Port Street.This station   
 serves Annan &amp; District and is used   
 as a back-up service to Dumfries.The  
 station has two appliances.The firemen
 are all part-time and have day jobs in
 or near Annan.There are 17 men        
 altogether.                           
 When there is a fire they are summoned
 to the station by means of a pocket   
 alerter.In past days a siren was set  
 off.                                  
 Recently the call out system was      
 changed.If there is a small fire only 
 half of the men are called out.If     
 it is a fire which needs all of       
 the firemen the other half of the men 
 are called out 30 seconds later.This  
 saves all of the men being called out 
 only for some of them to be sent away.
