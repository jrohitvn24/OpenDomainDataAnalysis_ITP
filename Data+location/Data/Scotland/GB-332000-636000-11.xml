 Leithen Water divides Innerleithen    
 into East and West wards, which are   
 represented by two councillors at the 
 meetings of the Tweeddale District    
 Council.All the needs of the community
 are covered by the work of four major 
 committees_Finance,Technical Services,
 Environmental Health, Parks and       
 Amenities.                            
 Local residents keenly support major  
 projects e.g.drainage of the pond area
 at Victoria Park,which it is hoped    
 will be developed into a park with    
 childrens play area,raised flower beds
 and water flowing under a stone bridge
 A feasibility study is being carried  
 out by the Region re.drainage of area.
 There are plans to make the town even 
 more attractive with more flowers and 
 another picnic area near Cuddy Bridge.
