		<title>06THE LEGEND OF THE LOCH</title>
		<content> One of the most well-known stories    
 about the{wizard}was that he boasted  
 that he could drive a carriage,drawn  
 by two horses across the Loch of Skene
 on the first night it was frozen over.
 On the{first frosty night,}he told his
 coachman to drive the horses at full  
 gallop.When they set out over the loch
 there was said to have been a terrible
 noise_demons groaning and lashing the 
 water in their anger.When the horses  
 and the front wheels of the carriage  
 reached land the{coachman}looked round
 and saw the{Devil}himself sitting     
 beside the Laird.At this very moment  
 the back wheels crashed through the   
 ice and{two black dogs}were seen to   
 plunge into the water.Many of the     
 older people of Skene still say today 
 that marks of the{carriage wheels}are 
 still seen clearly when the Loch of   
 Skene is frozen over.                 </content>
