		<title>08ST.JAMES' CATHOLIC CHURCH</title>
		<content> In 1885,an iron church or "Tin        
 Tabernacle" was erected for Catholics 
 on the site where St.James' now       
 stands. In 1909 it was hauled away in 
 sections by a steam traction engine   
 and replaced by the present stone     
 church. Although described as being   
 "in the Lombardic style" St.James' is,
 in fact, in no style at all,save that 
 of a small Scottish Church.The little 
 spire imitates the taller spire of St.
 Salvator's College Chapel which       
 dominates  St.Andrews' skyline. An    
 attractive statue of the Virgin and   
 Child is sited under the West gable   
 and a staircase turret and baptistry  
 jut out of the Western facade.Inside, 
 the church is divided into three      
 sections- nave, sanctuary and apse.The
 marble interior gives an Italian      
 rather than a Scottish air to th      
 Church.                               </content>
