		<title>01South East of Braidwood</title>
		<content> The area slopes from Braidwood down   
 the escarpent on north of River Clyde.
 In places the slope is steep and cut  
 by the deep valleys of four streams   
 which join the river. In 1981         
 Braidwood village had population of   
 399 in 151 households. It has 1 main  
 street with Post Office/General Store 
 and one primary school with present   
 rol of 124.  The main land cover is   
 grassland and woodland. There are     
 about 12 farms and 1 large private    
 estate. Most of the farmland is used  
 for rough grazing with some hay and   
 silage production for sheep and       
 cattle. Quite a number of new houses  
 have been built privately recently in 
 the area.Many are occupied by people  
 who work in Glasgow and its industrial
 environs.
