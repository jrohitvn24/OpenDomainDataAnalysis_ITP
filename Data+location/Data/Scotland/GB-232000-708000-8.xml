		<title>08Clipping at Inversnaid</title>
		<content> Clipping is very arduous. You have 2  
 lots of clipping-eild ewes and hoggs  
 in June, and milk clipping in         
 July,when you work with double the    
 number of sheep.{(Scottish Blackface x
{Swaledale)}You usually get up         
 at 4.30am. You gather the sheep first.
 You can't gather if it is misty or    
 raining since you don't want wet      
 fleeces. Most shepherds work with at  
 least 2 good{border collies.}After    
 gathering you take the sheep to the   
 fank and shed off hoggs and eild ewes 
 and put them into pens for clipping.  
 The ewes with lambs are dipped and put
 into parks to mother up. Croggers take
 the sheep one at a time to the        
 clippers. Some one rolls the fleeces  
 and puts them into large bags to be   
 taken to the Wool Growers in Paisley.
