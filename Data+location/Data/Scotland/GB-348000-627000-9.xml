		<title>09THE SOUTH COMMON</title>
		<content> The South Common was replanted last   
 Year (1984) after much discussion with
 the local Community Council. The      
 conflict arose bbbecause of the needs 
 of the scenic amenity of the area and 
 the financial income available from   
 timber.  The financial advantages     
 ofplanting with conifer were          
 outweighed by the need to maintain the
 area as a local recreational facility.
 The heather had become over mature and
 the whin was threatening the general  
 appearance of the whole area.         
 The planting was therefore done with  
 beech, ash, oak, hazel, birch,        
 blackthorn, holly, scots pine, and    
 rowan(mountain ash).                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
