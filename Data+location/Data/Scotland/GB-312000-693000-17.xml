		<title>17MINING DISASTER</title>
		<content> Despite the large number of men       
 working underground there has only    
 been one major mine incindent, a      
 disaster.  In the Lindsay Pit in 1957 
 where nine men lost their lives in an 
 explosion.  Four of these men lived in
 Kelty.  There were many single deaths 
 caused by pit accidents involving not 
 just Kelty miners, but from other     
 surrounding tours and villages who    
 worked here.  The Lindsay disaster had
 a traumatic effect on Kelty.
