		<title>08Crathie Parish Social Life</title>
		<content> The social life of the parish is      
 mainly centred on visiting relatives  
 and friends in their homes. There are 
 badminton sessions held in the Church 
 hall. The Women's Guild meet regularly
 as do the Crathie and Birkhall Womens 
 Rural Institute.  There is a curling  
 club in the Winter, also cricket and  
 golf clubs for the Summer months. An  
 Old People's Welfare Committee runs a 
 splendid lunch party at Christmas.    
 Santa Claus meets every child in the  
 parish at the Women's Guild Christmas 
 Party. Regular whist drives attract   
 people even in cold winter weather to 
 come from Braemar or Ballater and     
 there are occasional concerts and     
 ceilidhs. Summer picnics are run by   
 the Sunday School and WRI and there is
 generally a full turn out for these   
 even if June is a cold month.
