		<content> OIL SEED RAPE                         
 This crop is new to our area and has  
 doubled in production over the last   
 year. When it is in flower it is a    
 very vivid yellow colour.  It is sown 
 in September and harvested in July.   
 The bright yellow flower appears in   
 May and dies down towards time of     
 harvest. It can be harvested in two   
 ways. 1-sprayed wuth chemical to      
 dessicate it.                         
       2-cut into swathes.Left to dry  
 in rows and then combined.            
 It is a high input crop because the   
 sprays and fertilizers are expensive  
 but the farmers are guaranteed a good 
 price at the end of the crop cycle.   
 When the rape is harvested the seed is
 crushed to make vegetable oil and the 
 residue for cattle feed.The farmer has
 a contract for the crop from a dealer.
