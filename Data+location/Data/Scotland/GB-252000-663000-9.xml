		<title>09MAN AND THE LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>   The relief in this area is mainly   
 very flat, level land with a few      
{drumlins}giving some hilly areas e.g. 
 Bellahouston Park, whose natural      
 looking state of rich grassy hills and
 abundant trees encompassing the       
 smooth dome_shaped top contrast       
 sharply with the straightness of the  
 motorway.  The oldest{man-made        
{landscape}is the mixed tenement and   
 industrial areas of Govan and Ibrox.  
 Cardonald and Mosspark have a suburban
 appearance with semi_detached and four
 in a block houses with gardens.  Near 
 the Clyde the land is very flat and   
 modern housing has replaced some of   
 the docks and shipyards.  Princes Dock
 is being filled in at present and is  
 to be used for a garden festival in   
 1988 and then housing.
