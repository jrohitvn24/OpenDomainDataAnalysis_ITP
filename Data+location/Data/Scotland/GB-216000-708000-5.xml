		<title>05Bird Walk</title>
		<content>   When I came home from school I      
 picked up my binoculars and went      
 outside.I looked for any birds in the 
 garden and there was a thrush sitting 
 on the grass.The thrush was trying to 
 peck a worm out of the ground and it  
 succeeded.I went on to the shore at   
 Rubhmor to look for some seabirds.As I
 came round the corner I saw two swans 
 with their seven cygnets.The little   
 cygnets were all fluffy and brown.I   
 came off the shore at the big house   
 and went up to the workshop where I   
 went up the bank and into the         
 forest.In the middle of the forest I  
 saw a little treecreeper climbing up  
 the side of a tree.I could not miss it
 because of its white breast and its   
 brown back.I still did not see the    
 golden eagle that is supposed to be in
 the forest.                           
                                       </content>
