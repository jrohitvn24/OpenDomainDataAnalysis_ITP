		<content>       An Annual Raft Race             
 There are not very many leisure       
 activities which take place in our    
 small area but one which starts here  
 is the annual raft race which is held 
 in midsummer. It starts at the caravan
 site, Shoremills and ends at the      
 little fishing village of Cromarty.   
 Rafts come from all over the Highlands
 to join in the fun. The course is     
 about two miles long and the rafts    
 have to go twice. There are quite a   
 lot of people who come to spectate and
 cheer on their raft.                  
 One of the rafts come from the local  
 smiddy which is near our school. They 
 call the raft the "Black Pig" and that
 is the one we cheer on, although it   
 does not often win.
