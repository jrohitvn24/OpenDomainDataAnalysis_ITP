		<title>16Yetholm Show</title>
		<content> The show of sheep is of special       
 importance with the two famous hill   
 breeds of sheep, the South Country    
 Ceviot and the Scottish Blackface     
 predominating, but with the Greyface  
 and half-bred breeds also represented.
 Another highlight is the sheep dog    
 trial, not only for the skilled       
 handling competitors, but increasingly
 to the many visitors from varied walks
 of life. Classes of foxhounds and     
 Border Terriers are also judged. The  
 Industrial Tent includes outstanding  
 exhibits of vegetables and flowers,   
 home made jam, home baking, knitting, 
 needlecraft and handicraft sections   
 are testimony to the industry and     
 skills of this relatively small       
 community.There is always an excellent
 exhibit both of craftwork and home    
 baking by the pupils of the local     
 school.                               </content>
