		<content> Take for example the cows.Many years  
 ago there were only 15 cows on the    
 farm. They were kept in a byre in     
 winter,and had to be milked and       
 cleaned out by hand.                  
   Now there are 120 cattle,kept in    
 straw courts in winter,and are milked 
 by machine. Potato planting and       
 harvesting have also changed greatly. 
 Not so long ago, people planted       
 potatoes by hand from an open sack    
 tied round their waist.It took around 
 four days to plant 15-20 acres.Last   
 week, Mr Stirling's farm workers      
 planted the 43 acre field beside our  
 school in three days.As well as       
 cereals ,Mr. Stirling,has started to  
 plant flax and oil seed rape.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
