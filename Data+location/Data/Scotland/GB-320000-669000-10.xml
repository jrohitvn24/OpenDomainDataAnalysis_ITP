		<title>10THE PRIEST</title>
		<content>  Mr Brockie is the priest who comes to
 our school on several Fridays         
 throughout the school year. He is the 
 priest of St Lukes Episcopal Church   
 serving the Gorgie, Dalry and Wester  
 Hailes area of Edinburgh. In addition 
 to our school, he also visits         
 Clovenstone Primary and Westburn      
 Primary.                              
  Mr Brockie's church is unique in that
 he has no specific building in which  
 to worship. Instead he uses peoples   
 homes or, when he requires larger     
 premises for special occasions, he    
 uses a hall. He felt that the money   
 required of a church and its upkeep   
 would be put to a better use helping  
 needy people.                         
  His parents were married in Glasgow  
 but moved to England where his father 
 worked on a ship. Mr Brockie          
 previously lived in England for 25yrs.</content>
