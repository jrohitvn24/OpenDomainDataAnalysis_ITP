		<title>17NEWTONMORE, THE VILLAGE  3</title>
		<content>  This has had a serious effect on     
 business prosperity with the loss of  
 passing trade. Local enterprise,      
 allied to aid from the Highlands and  
 Islands Development Board and other   
 national and Regional bodies has been 
 engaged over the last four years in a 
 special project: "The                 
 Newtonmore/Dalwhinnie/Laggan Project" 
 which has attempted to promote a      
 special effort towards recovery. The  
 communities look forward to a ski     
 development taking place between      
 Dalwhinnie and Newtonmore, hopefully  
 in the near future. Features of       
 interest developed over the last few  
 years are the "Clan MacPherson Museum"
 in Newtonmore and the tourist         
 reception area at Ralia, "the Gateway 
 to the Highlands". Newtonmore awaits  
 the major development of a Highland   
 Folklife Museum/Park very nearby.     </content>
