   THE CORNALEES BRIDGE INFORMATION    
 CENTRE LIES AT THE TOP OF SHIELHILL   
 GLEN. FROM THE CENTRE A TRAIL LEADS   
 ALONG THE BANKS OF THE HISTORIC       
 GREENOCK CUT, AN AQUEDUCT WHICH ONCE  
 CARRIED WATER FROM LOCH THOM  TO      
 GREENOCK, AND WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN 
 DESIGNATED AS A "NATIONAL MONUMENT".  
 THE TRAIL TURNS AWAY FROM THE CUT AND 
 GOES DOWN INTO SHIELHILL GLEN WHICH   
 HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS A SITE OF      
 "SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST"-AS IT IS
 ONE OF THE FEW NATURAL HARDWOOD GLENS 
 IN THIS PART OF SCOTLAND. TYPICAL     
 TREES ARE ASH, BIRCH, OAK AND ROWAN.  
   ON CLIMBING OUT OF THE GLEN ON THE  
 SOUTH SIDE OF THE KIP BURN, THE TRAIL 
 RETURNS THROUGH THE HEATHER MOORLAND  
 WHICH IS SHEEP FARMING COUNTRY.
