		<content>   AS WELL AS THE FALL IN POPULATION   
 AND THE COMING OF NON-GAELIC SPEAKERS,
 THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CHANGES AROUND   
 LITTLE LOCH BROOM IN THE LAST 50 yrs. 
   FIFTY YEARS AGO SMALL BOATS WERE    
 OPERATED BY SAIL OR OAR;NOW THEY ARE  
 POWERED BY OUTBOARD ENGINES. UNTIL THE
 EARLY 1950s A STEAMBOAT CALLED        
 REGULARLY TO SUPPLY THE 4 SHOPS THAT  
 WERE THEN THERE.                      
   PEOPLE AT THAT TIME GREW MOST OF    
 THEIR OWN FOOD ON THE CROFTS AND      
 USUALLY KEPT THEIR OWN MILKING COW.   
 FISH WERE MORE PLENTIFUL. MOST CLOTHES
 WERE MADE LOCALLY,HOUSES WERE LIT BY  
 OIL LAMPS(UNTIL THE EARLY 1950s). AT  
 THAT TIME ELECTRICITY WAS INSTALLED AT
 BADLUARACH AND RECENTLY WIND-POWERED  
 ELECTRICITY CAME TO SCORAIG.FIFTY     
 YEARS AGO PEOPLE WORKED ON THE ESTATES
 AT DUNDONNELL,REGULARLY OR SEASONALLY.
 LOCAL GIRLS WORKED IN THE LODGES.     </content>
