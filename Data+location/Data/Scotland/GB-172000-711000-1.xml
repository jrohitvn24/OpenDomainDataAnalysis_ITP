		<title>01Isle of Luing-North End</title>
		<content> About 70 people live in this block,   
 mainly in the village of Cullipool.   
 One of the main industries is farming;
 the "Luing" cattle are bred here, as  
 are many Scottish Blackface sheep.    
 Eight men in three boats fish out of  
 Cullipool for Lobsters, prawns and    
 other shellfish.   Tourism provides   
 other employment.   Cullipool "old"   
 village was built in the 1860's around
 the now defunct slate quarries.   The 
 centre of the village has now shifted 
 half a mile south, around the post    
 office and small council estate.  One 
 child in the block attends the island 
 school, &amp; seven are pupils Oban High  
 School.   Six of these travel daily,  
 the 7th boards weekly in the school   
 hostel.   On the east coast of the    
 block there are the remains of an old 
 fort, thought to be Pictish.
