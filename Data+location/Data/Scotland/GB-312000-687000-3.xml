		<content> The open-cast mine complex was opened 
 in 1982. It covers an area of about   
 175 hectares, although not all of it  
 is worked at the one time. The area   
 has a planned sequence of exploitation
 with mined sectors being landscaped   
 through a five year rehabilitation    
 scheme before handing it back to the  
 owner.                                
 Forty men are employed on-site, and   
 they control the machinery (draglines,
 tractor-shovels etc.) which provides  
 the Longannet power station with 13000
 tonnes of coal a week.                
 Before any coal could be              
 excavated, topsoil, overburden, and   
 sandstone (over 100 feet of it) had to
 be removed and stored in neat piles   
 called BINGS. These bings shelter the 
 nearby villages from noise and other  
 disturbances.                         
                                       </content>
