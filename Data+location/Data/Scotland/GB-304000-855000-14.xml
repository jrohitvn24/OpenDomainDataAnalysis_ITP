		<title>14LANDSCAPE&amp;BUILDING RAFFORD</title>
		<content> The landscape of our area is mainly   
 rural.Most of the land is either      
 farmland or forest.To the east the    
 ground begins to climb steeply to     
 form Califer hill at the top of which 
 is obtained a good view of the Moray  
 Firth.On the slopes of the hills there
 are fields of grass with cattle       
 grazing.                              
 The village of Rafford consists of    
 several groups of houses.             
 The largest building in the area is   
 Blervie House,a Georgian style mansion
 lying in its own grounds.The house has
 stood empty for 9 years and may soon  
 be used as a private school or an old 
 folks home.The ruined tower of Blervie
 Castle stands beside a modern farm.   
 There is a large quarry where mica    
 schist rock is quarried.
