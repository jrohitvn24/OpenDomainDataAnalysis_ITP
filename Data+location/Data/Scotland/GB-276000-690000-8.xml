		<title>08A CHILD ON HILLHEAD FARM.</title>
		<content> Living on a farm has it's{advantages  
 and it's{disadvantages.}There's no    
 hustle bustle of the city traffic so  
 you can imagine how peaceful it is.You
 have more freedom and more places to  
 play.You have plenty of places to grow
 vegetables and if you have cattle you 
 can get plenty of meat.If you are     
 interested in nature it is an         
 excellent place to live because this  
 particular farm has lots of woodland  
 so it is bound to have nature.But     
 living on a farm is not all easy as   
 there are some setbacks.You don't have
 friends round all the time and you    
 have to arrange for them to come and  
 play with you.But you can't play all  
 the time.There is always a lot of work
 to do whether you want to or not.Some 
 work like driving the tractor is good 
 fun but other work like picking       
 potatoes is not quite as good fun.    </content>
