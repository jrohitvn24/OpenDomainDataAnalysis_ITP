		<title>12Traffic Survey in Dalkeith</title>
		<content> The need for a decrease in the amount 
 of traffic travelling through Dalkeith
 perhaps brought about by the          
 construction of a bypass, was the     
 factor leading to this survey. The    
 group had to count the vehicular      
 traffic coming into and going out of  
 Dalkeith in one and a half hour       
 period, 9.30 to 11.00 am on Friday 24 
 May 1985. The group had to cover 5    
 points, 3 of which are very busy being
 on 2 of the main roads leading into   
 England, the A68 and the A7.          
                                       
 During the survey period 900 vehicles 
 came into Dalkeith and 892 went out   
 which gives and estimate of 1 vehicle 
 travelling in or out every 1 second.
