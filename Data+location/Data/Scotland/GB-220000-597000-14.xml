		<title>14Pollution in the R. Girvan</title>
		<content>   On the{21st.of October 1980}the R.  
 Girvan started to turn{red.}The cause 
 was severe pollution from the         
 Quarrelhill Burn near Dailly, into    
 which had flooded water from coal     
 mines closed in 1977.                 
   The{Dalquharran}mine in particular  
 has iron pyrites in the coal seams and
 it was iron from this which had       
 spilled into the burn and so to the   
 R.Girvan itself.                      
   It was not long before the complete 
 length of the river,{from Dailly to   
{the sea,}was a bright red colour.     
   Iron was deposited on the rocks, on 
 the banks and on the bridges and much 
 river life was destroyed, including   
 fish.                                 
   Happily the mine overflow now has   
 stopped, the river cleaned up, and the
 fish have returned.
