		<content> Because there are no shopping         
 facilities in Collessie almost every  
 household puchased its everyday goods 
 from a visiting van owned by Mr.      
 Ramsay. This van service travels daily
 from Kingskettle.                     
 For the main shopping items most      
 people go to the neighbouring towns of
 Cupar, Perth and Glenrothes, with a   
 few people travelling to Kinross and  
 Dundee. Almost every household in the 
 village owns a car with the exception 
 of a few elderly residents who use    
 public transport.                     
 From the suvey it appears that very   
 few people use the bus services due to
 its relative infrequency. The general 
 opinion of people in Collessie is that
 public transport services in the area 
 are totally inadequate.
