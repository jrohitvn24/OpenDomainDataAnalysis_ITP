		<title>06A Farmer's Day</title>
		<content>  Bleep,Bleep,Bleep goes the alarm     
 clock reading{7.00am}to wake up the   
 farmer for winter labour on his       
 217 acre farm{near Old Dailly.}After  
 his breakfast of hot porridge he      
 starts off on his morning round to    
 feed his animals. He then checks the  
 farm for any damage caused by the     
 weather or by his own animals.        
  Once again he tramps over the hills  
 but this time back to his wife waiting
 with some traditional hot farmhouse   
 broth cooked after his tiring but     
 enjoyable morning.                    
  He sets off once more after his feed 
 to finish his repairs and weather     
 permitting,maybe plough a field or    
 tackle the job of spreading dung.     
  After all this he can relax and enjoy
 a peaceful car drive in {Girvan,}the  
 nearest town,to buy food for his      
 evening meal.                         </content>
