		<title>07CASTLETOWN POLICE STATION</title>
		<content> Castletown has a one man police       
 station which is also the home of the 
 village policeman whose job is in many
 ways different to that of the city    
 policeman.Only a small part of his job
 is taken up with crime,his job being  
 to serve the community in many        
 ways.Apart from knowing the villagers 
 well,he must patrol the countryside.In
 a country area many farmers have      
 shotguns and the policeman has to     
 check suitability before renewing     
 licences.In a city many departments   
 deal with enquiries ,but a village    
 policeman has to deal with            
 everything.In summer his 8 hour day is
 often longer due to increased traffic.
 Motoring offences are the most common 
 offences.It is often thought that the 
 country is safe,but there are dangers 
 -the harbour,the cliffs,the beach,the 
 disused quarries and of course,farms. </content>
