		<content> WE INVITED A RANGER CALLED RICHARD TO 
 COME AND TALK TO US ABOUT HIS WORK IN 
 PALACERIGG COUNTRY PARK. HE TOLD US   
 THAT HE STARTS WORK AT 8.30 A.M. EVERY
 MORNING. AFTER PUTTING HIS BIKE IN THE
 SHED HE CHECKS TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING 
 IS IN ORDER. WHEN WORKING HE HAS TO   
 WEAR CLOTHES TO PROTECT HIM FROM ALL  
 KINDS OF WEATHER. OUTSIDE RANGERS GET 
 A GRANT FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE          
 COMMISSION OF SCOTLAND TO BUY WHATEVER
 CLOTHES ARE NEEDED SO LONG AS THEY ARE
 CAMOUFLAGE COLOURS. HE MUST ALWAYS    
 WEAR HIS RANGER BADGE.HE WORKS TO A   
 TIMETABLE AND A RANGER MUST BE        
 AVAILABLE FOR WORK ANY DAY OF THE     
 YEAR. HIS TIMETABLE INCLUDES SCHOOL   
 VISITS TO TALK ABOUT BIRDS, TREES AND 
 LOCAL HISTORY. HE ALSO DOES GUIDED    
 TOURS AND SLIDE SHOWS. HE ALSO FEEDS  
 AND LOOKS AFTER THE ANIMALS.
