		<content> The original site of the settlement   
 was the{Green}where the river is      
 bridged and the{Drovers Roads}met.    
 Many original houses still survive.   
{Lewiston}was founded in the late 18th 
 century. It was a self sufficient     
 community with smithy etc. and each   
 house having its own field. The old   
 terraced houses have mostly been      
 modernised.{Milton}was built about    
 the same time but has since been added
 to and improved.The nearby river      
 powered the tweed and grain mills     
 which are all now closed.             
 Recently the village has expanded.In  
 the 1950s a scheme of semi detached 2 
 storey council houses was built at    
{Druimlon}.In the 1960s and 1970s more 
 council houses were built at{Balmacaan
 including pensioners bungalows.There  
 has also been a lot of private housing
 developments since 1970.              </content>
