		<title>05Vandalism in Kirkcaldy</title>
		<content> Our local councillor said that proper 
 education could solve this problem and
 that the court should decide what to  
 do about what vandals have done.He    
 thinks parents should pay for the     
 damage that their child has done.They 
 should also warn their children not to
 spray paint on walls or to break      
 windows.In the town most damage is    
 done by spray paint rather than       
 breaking glass or pulling down fences.
 The most popular things that are      
 written are people's names and the    
 names of pop groups or gangs.People   
 think that vandalism is getting worse 
 so the council have formed a new group
 of council workers who are provided   
 with vans.Their job is to stamp out   
 vandalism by patrolling the streets   
 where problems are likely to occur.
