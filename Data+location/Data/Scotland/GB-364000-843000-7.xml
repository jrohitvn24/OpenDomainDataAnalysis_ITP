		<content> In our free time we do many different 
 things. Five people at school have    
{computers}and spend a lot of time     
 playing with them. One or two children
 make their own programs.{Football}is a
 popular game and we play it at school 
 in the playground. The two girls in   
 our class spend a lot of time with    
 horses.{Swimming}is also enjoyed by   
 most but we have to go to Turriff or  
 Huntly to do this. The children here  
 enjoy collecting things.{Stamps,      
{bottles, lorries, old model cars}are  
 examples.{Cycling}is popular and      
 nearly every child has a bike. A lot  
 of people like{pop music.}There is a  
 lot of good music in the charts. Every
 body likes pets. Cats and dogs are the
 favourite.
