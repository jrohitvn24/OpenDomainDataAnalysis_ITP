		<title>18The Worst Shiskine Summer</title>
		<content>  {1985}has been one of the wettest    
 summers in about twenty years. It has 
 affected the farmers very badly. Crops
 have been flattened, hay has been lost
 and farmers have lost hundreds of     
 pounds. On the{28th of July}the worst 
 thunderstorm for 60 years struck. Here
 is what happened:-                    
   There was a close and clammy feeling
 about the air. It was a nice night so 
 I went for a game of golf. We were at 
 the first tee when there was a loud { 
{boom!}It was thunder.Lightning flashed
 and it was very frightening. It soon  
 began to pour and pour and we ran to  
 get sheltered from it. When we were   
 back home I sat and watched the forked
 lightning zig zag in the sky. We tried
 the TV, but the lightning interfered. 
   It rained and rained all night. In  
 the morning our road had been washed  
 away!                                 </content>
