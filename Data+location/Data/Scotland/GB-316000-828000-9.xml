		<title>09FARMING IN GLENLIVET</title>
		<content>   The principle  forms  of agriculture
 in   Glenlivet  are  beef  cattle  and
 sheep.                                
  {Grass}  is   conserved   mainly   as
 silage although  some hay is made when
 the weather is favourable.Turnips also
 provide food for the winter along with
 the grain from  barley and oats, while
 the straw provides bedding.           
  {Calves}are reared and sold  at about
 one year old  in the  store  market to
 farmers   at   lower   altitudes   who
 specialise in fattening cattle. During
 the winter which  can  be  very severe
 the cattle are kept inside.           
  {Sheep}are mainly  outwintered. Lambs
 are   born  in  March  or  April  when
 hopefully the  worst of the  winter is
 past, and sold  around  September  and
 October.                              
   The farms are run by the family with
 casual labour employed at busy times. </content>
