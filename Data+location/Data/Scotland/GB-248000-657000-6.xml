		<content>   We have three events each year      
 which are of interest to our local    
 community.                            
   As a large part of our area is      
 farming land the main event of the    
 year is the{agricultural}show.The     
 Neilston Show has taken place since   
 1821 and is still as popular          
 today.Local farmers exhibit their     
 animals and there are competitions for
 baking,sewing and floral art.         
   In June each year one of the local  
 children is chosen as{Gala}Queen. She 
 rides through the town on a decorated 
 float on Gala day and presents the    
 trophies for the different            
 competitions which take place during  
 Gala week.                            
   On the final day of Gala week{pipe  
{bands}from all over Scotland come to  
 take part in the competitions.
