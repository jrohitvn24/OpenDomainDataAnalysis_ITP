		<content>   MAY AND JUNE ARE TRADITIONALLY THE  
 TWO MONTHS WHEN PEAT IS CUT.ON SCORAIG
 MOST OF THE FAMILIES PAIR UP WITH     
 ANOTHER FAMILY AND CUT PEAT           
 TOGETHER.THERE ARE ABOUT 3 MAIN PEAT  
 BANKS, BUT THEY ARE ALL PRETTY FAR    
 FROM WHERE ANYONE LIVES.IN BADLUARACH 
 THE PEAT BANKS ARE QUITE NEAR THE     
 ROAD.FOR TWO FAMILIES WHO HAVE JOINED 
 FORCES IT TAKES ABOUT TWO AND A HALF  
 DAYS TO CUT A BANK.CUTTING PEAT IS A  
 DIRTY,TIRING JOB.ONCE YOU HAVE CUT THE
 PEATS YOU LAY THEM OUT TO DRY. YOU LAY
 THEM OUT FLAT.AFTER ABOUT A MONTH YOU 
 PICK THEM UP AND BALANCE THEM SO THAT 
 THEY LOOK LIKE A TEPEE.WHEN THEY ARE  
 COMPLETELY DRY YOU COLLECT THEM AND   
 TAKE THEM HOME BY HORSEBACK OR        
 TRACTOR.MOST PEOPLE CUT PEAT.IF NOT,  
 THEY HAVE TO BUY AND FERRY COAL.
