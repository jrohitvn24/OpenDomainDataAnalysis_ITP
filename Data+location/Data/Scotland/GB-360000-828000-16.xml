		<content>  We then went to the Art Department   
 where we were shown the kiln room.    
 After that we visited the History     
 Department,where we were told about   
 the school rules and discipline.If we 
 do something wrong we will get punish_
 ment exercises or detention. When we  
 were finished in the History class we 
 went to the gymnasium where we spoke  
 to two gym teachers.Next we had our   
 dinner.I had a sandwich,juice and a   
 jelly.We then visited the Home Econo_ 
 mics Department where the teacher     
 talked mostly about cookery.Finally we
 entered a Geography class,where we    
 looked at some maps and found the     
 population of Scotland.               
  I enjoyed myself very much.I should  
 not have been so nervous because there
 was nothing to worry about, and now I 
 know something about the Academy.It   
 was a very interesting visit.         </content>
