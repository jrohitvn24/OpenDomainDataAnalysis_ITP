		<title>03HOLYDEAN CASTLE</title>
		<content> Holydean Castle is one of the Border  
 Reiver castles.It was the home of the 
 Ker family who are the ancestors of   
 the Duke of Roxburghe.                
    There are small parts of the castle
 which are still standing.The largest  
 remaining part is the bake house with 
 its arched ceiling.Legend has it that 
 there is a tunnel leading from the    
 bakehouse to the hanging tree which   
 stood in a field a mile away.No traces
 of the tunnel have been found and the 
 hanging tree is no longer there.      
    There also remains the main        
 entrance archway of the castle with   
 its walls 2 feet 6 inches wide.As well
 as the archway,there is an old well   
 and a turret wall overgrown with ivy. 
    An old chapel and Deer Park are no 
 longer there.
