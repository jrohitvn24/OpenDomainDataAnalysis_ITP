		<title>04HOUSING IN CRUDEN BAY.</title>
		<content> Housing in Cruden Bay consists of     
 various types. The village began as a 
 group of cottages, used mainly by     
 fishermen and their families. This was
 called Port Erroll.                   
        There used to be a large Hotel 
 situated at the South end of the      
 village(demolished in 1945). Several  
 bungalows were built on the road      
 leading up to the Hotel.As the oil    
                                       
 Industry grew in the '70s more houses 
 were built. A Council Estate of wooden
 Norwegian-type houses were built at   
 the south end and a private Estate was
 built by Barratt on the hill above the
 original village. This greatly        
 increased the village population, and 
 therefore included a new school to    
 accommodate 210 children.
