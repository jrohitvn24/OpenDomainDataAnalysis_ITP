		<title>13The Camps Petrol Station</title>
		<content> The Camps petrol station is situated  
 by the Service bridge in the camps    
 part of town. It has two petrol pumps 
 and though the building covers an     
 extremely small area it sells all the 
 basic things needed for car           
 maintainance. The garage employs two  
 people, Joan and an old man. They work
 on shifts, the old man from 9am to 4pm
 and Joan 4pm to 8pm. It averages about
 7 customers per hour. The station does
 not get much customers on a Monday but
 trade gets good at the end of a       
 working week, Thursday and Friday.    
 Round about Spring and Summer it is   
 not unusual to see people buying a    
 gallon of petrol in a can for lawn    
 mowers. Other things that can be      
 obtained from the camps are basics    
 such as oil, electrical goods and car 
 cleaning equipment.
