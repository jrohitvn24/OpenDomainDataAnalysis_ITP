		<content> A low % of the people in this area are
{car}owners.                           
 Most people uses {buses}, except in   
 snowy or icy conditions in wintertime.
 On some wintry days no vehicles can   
 get up or down the hills and people   
 have to walk.                         
 The bus service is a very reliable    
 one. There are three bus routes which 
 terminate in our area. Some people    
 think that there should be more bus   
 shelters, but most of them are very   
 pleased with the service.             
{Taxis} are very popular. They are     
 favoured because they are quicker and 
 they take their passengers directly   
 where they are going. Although taxi   
 fares are expensive, if four people   
 share, this works out cheaper than the
 bus fares which they would pay.
