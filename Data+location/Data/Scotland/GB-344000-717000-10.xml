		<content> There are about 200 houses in this    
 small village situated round the head 
 of the Eden Estuary between the Motray
 Water and the River Eden itself.  The 
 bridges across the rivers gave the    
 village its name.  Near the 2 bridges 
 are the oldest houses, built of stone 
 and some at least with red pantiled   
 roofs.  Along Main Street which links 
 the 2 bridges, terraced houses, 3     
 storeys tall occupy the west side     
 while the east side has the Paper Mill
 and its associated waste land. Also in
 Main Street is a former church,       
 recently converted into a house.      
 Within the last 30 years about 40     
 houses have been built on a flat site 
 just North of the Motray Water.       
 Otherwise little has changed and no   
 new building is in progress.
