		<title>06INDUSTRY IN GREENLOANING</title>
		<content>  Farming is the main industry in      
 Greenloaning. There are several       
 privately owned farms but much of the 
 land is owned and farmed by a large   
 concern. The main crops grown in the  
 area are potatoes,turnips,peas,barley,
 hay and oil seed rape. The growing of 
 oil seed rape is relatively new and   
 provides a lovely splash of colour,   
 with the bright yellow flowers. The   
 growing of peas in a big way, is also 
 a new crop for this area.             
  There are no dairy farms in the area 
 now,the cattle are mainly beef cattle;
 Aberdeen Angus,Hereford &amp; Charollais. 
 The sheep are mainly Cross Suffolk,   
 although one shepherd has a few Jacob 
 sheep. There is a fairly large pig    
 farm at Balhaldie . Poultry &amp; game are
 plentiful too,hens,ducks,turkeys,     
 grouse and pheasant. Free range eggs  
 are on sale at most of the farms.     </content>
