		<title>03FARMING : BOARHILLS</title>
		<content> There are three farms situated within 
 the village of Boarhills, each        
 privately owned.                      
 Most of the land which is farmed is   
 under some form of cultivation :      
 cereals, potatoes and vegetables, and 
 only on the higher more exposed land  
 are a few beef cattle kept. Farmers   
 aim to sell most of their barley for  
 malting, and vegetables go direct to  
 vegetable packing stations.           
 Trees,except those around the village,
 are relatively scarce in this area    
 because farmers use as much of the    
 land as possible and the only new     
 woodland areas are found on the       
 steeper slopes of the Kenley Burn.    
 Field boundaries are usually stone    
 walls, although hawthorn hedges line  
 the roads. These support many other   
 hedgerow plants and animals.
