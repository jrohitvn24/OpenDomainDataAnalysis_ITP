		<title>15Shopping in Johnstone</title>
		<content> Johnstone streets are busy with       
 shoppers on a Friday morning. We spoke
 to 26 members of the public and got   
 many different opinions about the     
 shops in Johnstone. These shops are   
 used daily by very many shoppers.     
 People come from{Houston, Linwood,    
{Bridge of Weir and Johnstone}itself to
 shop here.                            
 The majority of people thought that   
 the range of shops was satisfactory,  
 although some felt that more          
 department stores were needed. Most   
 people thought that the service in the
 shops was adequate, but some felt that
 the shops could cater more for old    
 people. Only a minority of shoppers   
 were unhappy about the hours of       
 opening. The people of{Johnstone}     
 appreciate their shopping facilities.
