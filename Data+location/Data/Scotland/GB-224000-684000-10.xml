		<title>10MR.WILLIAM PETRIE OF RHU.</title>
		<content> Mr. Petrie who owns the post office/  
 general store in Rhu has lived in the 
 area all his life and has been a      
 councillor for the past 19 years.He   
 has seen many changes in the district 
 but feels that the great increase in  
 housing and population,which at       
 approx.1600 is four times that of 50  
 years ago,is the most significant.At  
 present he is involved in two major   
 local issues:_1.The proposed expansion
 of the Clyde Submarine Base at Faslane
 for the Trident Development and the   
 effect it will have on our village.   
 2.The planned new road through Rhu    
 which will need careful consideration 
 in order to preserve the beauty of the
 Bay.Mr. Petrie's main hope for Rhu is 
 that it is not allowed to become so   
 large that it would lose its identity 
 and eventually become a suburb of the 
 neighbouring town of Helensburgh.     </content>
