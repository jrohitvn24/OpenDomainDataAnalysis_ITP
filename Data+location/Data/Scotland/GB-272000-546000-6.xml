		<content> The earliest records we have of a     
 school in  Dundrennan are dated 1746. 
 At the moment there are 27 pupils and 
 2 teachers. We also have 3 visiting   
 teachers and a cleaner,who also helps 
 in the dinner hall.                   
  The school has 2 classrooms, a hall  
 and 3 cloakrooms and a dining hall,   
 which is on the opposite side of the  
 road from the school.The dinners are  
 brought by bus from Kirkcudbright,    
 8km away.                             
  There is a tarred playing area, and  
 we also have use of the adjoining     
 playing field.                        
  Pupils stay here for seven years and 
 then they transfer to Kirkcudbright   
 Academy.
