 Apart from the farmhouses and         
 relatively large modern houses, a few 
{council houses}can be found at the    
 edge of the area. The houses are      
 pre-second world war ones and would   
 have been built as roadmen's houses   
 who were working on the upkeep of     
 roads at a time when public transport 
 was poor. The council houses found in 
 the area are semi-detached, brick     
 houses with chimneys and uniform      
 gardens. Overall housing is sparse as 
 agricultural land and rough grazing   
 areas cover most of the region.
