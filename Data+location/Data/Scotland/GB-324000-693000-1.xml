		<title>01North-West of Kirkcaldy</title>
		<content> The greatest part of the North and    
 West of this block is arable farming  
 land of a smooth rolling nature rising
 to a height of 110m above sea level.In
 the NW corner is the tiny village of  
{Cluny.}The southern section is covered
 by the {Kirkcaldy}council housing     
 built principally since the war, a    
 sixteen unit industrial estate at{    
{Hayfield} and the sprawling Wimpey    
 private housing estate at{Dunnikier}. 
 The main features of the town area are
 the mostly modern {Victoria Hospital},
 five primary schools built at regular 
 intervals after the war until 1971 and
 the split-site Junior and Senior      
 buildings of {Kirkcaldy High School.} 
 On the north edge of the town is the  
 modern Crematorium and to the east is 
 a large part of the {Dunnikier Golf   
{Club. }                               
                                       </content>
