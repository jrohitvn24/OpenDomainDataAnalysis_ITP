		<title>04CLYDEBANK WATERWORKS</title>
		<content> Around 1870 Hardgate and Duntocher    
 used Cochno Loch for their water      
 supply but in 1872 a shipyard was     
 built on the banks of the Clyde.By    
 1886 Clydebank was a town and needed  
 much more water.Greenside Loch was    
 added and that kept them going.Soon   
 they found that the water was coming  
 out of the taps dirty and sometimes   
 the pipes were choked so they built   
 filters at Cochno.By 1914 they found  
 that the two lochs were drying up so  
 they tried to find more water.        
 Eventually they found a massive       
 loch in the Kilpatrick Hills called   
 Burncrooks Loch.It could hold over    
 twice as much water as Cochno and     
 Greenside and so it was added to the  
 system.This has been sufficient for   
 Clydebank's needs ever since despite  
 the great increase in population and  
 the large demands by factories.       </content>
