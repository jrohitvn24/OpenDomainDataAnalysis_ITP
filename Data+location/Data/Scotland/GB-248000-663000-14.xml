		<title>14SPICE FACTORY - PAISLEY</title>
		<content> The factory is ninety years old,      
 covers 38,0000 square feet and employs
 one hundred people.  Before being a   
 spice factory the building was used   
 for soup making, potato crisps and at 
 one time was a bakery.  The main      
 products are Camp Coffee, a variety of
 relishes, cranberry sauce and spices. 
 The ingredients come to Paisley from  
 all over the world, being unloaded at 
 Grangemouth and Port Glasgow where    
 they are transferred to trucks to be  
 brought to the factory by road. Corn  
 from the U.S.A., sugar from the West  
 Indies and chickory from Belgium.     
                                       
 It costs Â£8,700 per day to run the    
 factory and the annual wage bill is   
 Â£750,000.  Each year 7,000 cases of   
 coffee (24 bottle per case), 30,000   
 cases of relish (12 bottle in each),  
 and 50,000  trays of spices are sold. </content>
