		<content> There was also a church and a joiners 
 workshop, also a blacksmith. Now all  
 these have been closed and the local  
 children now go by bus to school in   
 Methven. For entertainment, the local 
 community would assemble in the       
 school, the centre of all leisure     
 activity, where, on a Friday          
 night,they would enjoy a whist drive, 
 followed by a dance. A large number of
 people were engaged on the land and   
 they were employed by the farmer on a 
 six monthly contract. These contracts 
 were made at the Whitsun Term or the  
 Martinmas Term. The result of this    
 type of employment was that the school
 population virtually changed          
 completely twice a year. With the     
 coming of mechanisation this pattern  
 changed. The agricultural workers     
 lived in small tied cottages and would
 'flit' from farm to farm.             </content>
