		<content> I live in Laurieston village. Its     
 small but I like it. My house is in a 
 block of three. The outside is small  
 with two tiny gardens. Inside we have 
 four rooms upstairs and three rooms   
 downstairs. Upstairs there are two    
 bedrooms, a boxroom and a bathroom. My
 sister shares a room with me. It is   
 messy sometimes and the walls are     
 covered with posters. We have a       
 television and record player in our   
 room. The box room is full of junk.The
 bathroom is small, but neat. It       
 doesn't have a shower. Downstairs the 
 kitchen has a table, two chairs, a    
 cooker, a refrigerator and some       
 units.The living room downstairs has a
 sofa, two easy chairs,a table,        
 television and a wall unit. A cupboard
 under the stairs holds dad's tools and
 ironing board.
