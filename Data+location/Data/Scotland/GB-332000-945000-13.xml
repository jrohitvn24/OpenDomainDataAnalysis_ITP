		<title>13Trees-Private woodlands</title>
		<content> Deciduous trees are a rare feature of 
 the Caithness landscape.Surprisingly  
 two such plantings lie within our     
 block as there are only seven clumps  
 of deciduous trees from Wick to the   
 Ord.These private woodlands are found 
 at Hempriggs house (approx 150)       
 and Thrumster house (approx 300trees).
 The trees which form avenues along the
 driveways and around the mansions were
 no doubt planted to give privacy as   
 well as shelter from the biting winds 
 that sweep the countryside even in    
 summer.The commonest species are Elm, 
 Sycamore,Ash,Beech, Willow,Birch and  
 Rowan.Many are lichen-covered and not 
 fully in leaf till late May.These old 
 trees form ideal roosts for birds and 
 a habitat for woodland flora and fauna
 There is a fifteen year old planting  
 of evergreens at Thrumster house      
 (approx 400 trees).                   </content>
