		<title>15STRATHNAIRN ROAD TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>  There are several kinds of transport 
 used around our area.                 
{Road Transport                        
  Some people have normal town or city 
 cars like Fords,BMW's,Austins,Rovers. 
 Other people have jeeps,like Toyota   
 Datsun or Landrover because of the    
 rough ground and so that in the winter
 they can get out of the snow drifts   
 when ordinary cars have to stay at    
 home.                                 
 The main roads are tarred but not very
 wide so passing places are provided so
 that cars can overtake or pass.       
  Most of the roads running to farms   
 and houses are just dirt roads.There  
 are lots of dirt roads made by the    
 forestry companies into their         
 plantations.                          
  There is a local bus that runs the   
 secondary school children and others  
 to and from Inverness on week days.   </content>
