		<title>20Credits for Evie survey</title>
		<content>   Our survey was the result of        
 research and discussion between       
 parents, children and school staff.   
 This meant there was a considerable   
 amount of community involvement and   
 co-operation from all those concerned.
 Questionnaires which were made up and 
 delivered by the children, were almost
 all answered and returned.            
   We are indebted to Mrs Barbara Vesco
 who co-ordinated the study, Mrs       
 Kathryn Sclater who programmed the    
 entire survey and to Mr Bertie Baikie 
 who supplied the slide photographs.
