		<title>05Education in Edinburgh</title>
		<content> Central Edinburgh contains a number of
 major{education}institutions:-the     
 medical, law, arts and social science 
 faculties of the{University}are       
 situated in George Square; Heriot-Watt
 University has buildings in the       
 Grassmarket; Edinburgh College of Art 
 is in Lauriston Place, while Moray    
 House College of Education is on      
 Holyrood Road. All these institutions 
 are within a mile of one another.     
 The number of students in the area    
 gives it a youthful, non-conformist   
 appearance and contrasts with the     
 greyer image of the many financial and
 commercial institutions in the area.  
 Unusually for Scotland there are a    
 number of{private schools}dating from 
 the 17th and 18th centuries,          
 e.g.Heriot's, originally founded by   
 James VI's banker as a hospital for   
 destitute children.                   </content>
