    Cairney School is a two-teacher    
 school with 30 pupils of primary      
 school age - 5 years to 12 years. The 
 school has stood on its present site  
 since 1864.                           
                                       
     About 15 years ago there were     
 three schools in the district but     
 falling rolls has caused two of them  
 to close, the children being          
 transported to the school in the      
 central location.                     
                                       
     The children are very keen on     
 Scottish Country Dancing and over the 
 years have won quite a number of      
 certificates.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
