		<content> An attractive upland valley through   
 which runs the A924 from Pitlochry to 
 Kirkmichael.  This road, frequently   
 blocked by snow in winter, is the last
 east-west link before the Cairngorm   
 Mountains to the north.  Along the    
 bottom of the valley there are        
 cultivated fields but most of the area
 is rough grazing for sheep and at     
 higher altitudes open moorland.       
 Limited planting of coniferous trees  
 has been carried out.  The population 
 is sparsed and is confined to isolated
 crofts and farms along the valley     
 floor.  Most of the inhabitants are   
 connected with hill farming.
