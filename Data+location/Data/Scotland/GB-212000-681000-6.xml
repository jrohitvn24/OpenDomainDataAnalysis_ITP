		<title>06HISTORY OF BALLOCHYLE.</title>
		<content>   Years ago {Ballochyle Estate}was    
 owned by the {Campbell }family. One of
 the owners names was {William Rose    
{Campbell. }In his time in Ballochyle  
 there were very few animals. The      
 largest number of animals  was {16    
{sheep}. Now there are {2500 sheep,}20 
 cattle, 3 horses, 2 dogs and 2 goats. 
   A story about Ballochyle is that the
{Ballochyle Brooch}(still on Ballochyle
 Estate) was a cure for many illnesses.
 If someone in the house was sick they 
 were put in a tub of water with the   
 brooch and it was believed that it    
 cured them. People came from miles    
 away to try this cure. In the middle  
 of the brooch is a rock crystal charm 
 stone which is said to work wonders.  
   Another fact is there have been {two
{Ballochyle Houses. }The old one was   
 burnt down by Atholmen many years ago.
