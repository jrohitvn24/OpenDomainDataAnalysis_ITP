		<title>03Ardross - main settlement</title>
		<content> Ardross has one church: the village is
 small and set back from the main road.
 There are four sets of semi-detached  
 council houses, one bungalow and a    
 telephone box. Four sets of cottages  
 face the road: the rest of the village
 contains a further 7 houses whuch     
 face onto farmland. Most of the       
 surrounding land is cultivated.       
 The people of the village are mostly  
 elderly and retired: the rest are     
 married with children. Apart from the 
 4 semi-detached houses owned by the   
 council the rest (bar one) are owner  
 occupied or tied. Only one is a       
 'holiday home'. The tied houses are   
 occupied by the farm-workers.         
 Most of the villagers have their own  
 mode of transport due to the fact that
 there is no public transport. Most    
 villagers grow their own vegetables   
 complaining the shop is too expensive.</content>
