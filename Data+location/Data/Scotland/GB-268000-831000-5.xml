		<title>05PEAT AND ITS USE</title>
		<content>  Peat is a brown turf that covers     
 most of the Highlands.The Highlands   
 used to be covered by great forests.  
 When they died the trees and other    
 plants were pressed down by new growth
 which fell in its turn.After thousands
 of years this formed into peat.       
                                       
  The crofters cut it with a knife.This
 knife has a long handle.It is called  
 a taishker (tairsgearl).In this area  
 people cut peat for burning.They      
 harvest in spring and let it dry      
 during the summer then it is ready to 
 be burned.                            
                                       
  In other parts of the country they   
 have big machines and they get the    
 peat and sell it to people or to power
 stations to make electricity for      
 thousands of people.
