		<content>  In Bernera we cut peat for           
 fuel.Wehave to set a day in spring to 
 cut the peats with a team of six or   
 eight people then pay them all back   
 whenever they set a day aside for it. 
  The peats are cut with a 'tairsgear' 
 or peat_iron; one person cutting the  
 peats and another thowing them on to  
 the dry ground to dry out. Within a   
 fortnight (according to the weather)  
 the peats are ready to stand up in    
 small heaps until they are dry enough 
 to be taken home by tractor from the  
 peat bank.                            
  The tractor gets to the peat bank    
 and in a few loads takes all the peats
 home where they are made into a       
 "cruach" or stack which will last a   
 year.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
