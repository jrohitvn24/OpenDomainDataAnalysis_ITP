		<title>15Stalking  at Kylestrome</title>
		<content>  During the shooting season the       
 stalker collects the owner's guests   
 at 10.30 a.m. and sets off in the boat
 to Glendhu. From here he walks out the
 hill while the guests go out on the   
 ponies, led up by the gillies.        
  When the stalker  sees a suitable    
 deer,_ one aged between 6 and 10 years
 old or between 12 and 14st. in weight,
 his work really begins. He has to     
 bring the guest in as close as        
 possible to the deer. Keeping the wind
 in their faces and using rocks and    
 bushes as cover, they move in to      
 within 100 yards. Then the guest takes
 the rifle to try his shot. If he kills
 the deer, the gillie takes the carcass
 back to the boat. The stalker goes off
 again to look for more animals. Our   
 stalker thoroughly enjoys his work,   
 but his greatest pleasure is going off
 alone to enjoy the peace of the hills.</content>
