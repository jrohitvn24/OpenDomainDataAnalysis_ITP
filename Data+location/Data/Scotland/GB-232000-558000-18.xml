		<content> On {Sundays}most children went to     
 church four times a-day, twice to     
 Sunday School and twice to services.  
{Sunday School}was at 10am and 3pm and 
 services were at noon and 7pm.To go to
 church the children wore their Sunday 
 clothes and girls always wore button  
 up boots,hats and gloves.These clothes
 were only worn on a Sunday.Some people
 went to the {Band of Hope}on a        
 Thursday.Sometimes if there  was a    
 naughty boy sitting next to a girl    
 he would pull the elastic on her hat, 
 let it go and she would scream then   
 was given a row for making a noise in 
{church.}Girls had a hat for winter and
 one for summer.In Sunday school they  
 sang {psalms}and were taught {Bible}  
 stories .They would learn to recite   
 parts of the Bible.
