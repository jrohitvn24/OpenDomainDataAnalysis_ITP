		<title>12Silaging in Dundrennan</title>
		<content> Of the ten farms in our area half of  
 them produce silage.The silage is cut 
 late May/early June and during that   
 time many tractors and trailers can be
 seen on the roads.                    
    When the silage has been cut,it is 
 put into a silage pit and then sheeted
 with black tarpaulin,weighted by      
 tyres.                                
    The silage is ready for use in late
 September,and is used to feed the     
 older calves,cows and sheep.Farms     
 without silage feed hay and barley to 
 their beasts.                         
     Two of the local farms,Newlaw and 
 Overlaw produce 11.47% and 26.37%     
 silage respectively.There are silage  
 pits at each farm.There are four silos
 at Newlaw and Overlaw combined,for    
 storing grain.
