		<title>16FISHING IN ORKNEY</title>
		<content>  It is said that Shetlanders are      
 fishmen with ploughs and the Orcadians
 are farmers who fish.From their Norse 
 ancestors the Orkneymen have good     
 seamanship and they are known as first
 rate sailors . In the nineteenth      
 century the{herring}industry grew up  
 in Orkney.Insufficient capital made it
 difficult for Orcadian fishermen to   
 get big enough boats.Most of the catch
 was taken by outsiders so the main    
 local work was{gutting}and{salting.   
 The fishing industry declined as the  
 herring became scarce, and small      
 fishing villages{lost population.     
  The fishing industry has{revived}in  
 the last 20 years, especially in      
 Westray,Stronsay and Stromness.       
{Salmon, crab and lobster}are now      
 contributing to the islands' economy, 
 and freshwater{trout}helps to attract 
 tourists.                             </content>
