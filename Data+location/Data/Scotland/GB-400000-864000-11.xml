		<title>11Fraserburgh Beach</title>
		<content>  On 27.5.85 we were down at the       
 beach.We got some information.  There 
 was a whole lot of old tyres, nets and
 fish boxes.On the prom there are a lot
 of seats and litter bins.There was a  
 lot of weathering on the rocks and on 
 the steps.The beach is about 4km      
 long.At 2.20 pm a boat was coming in. 
 It was a fishing boat.                
    The width from the seats to the sea
 is about 8m.The dry sand is like a    
 yellow colour.The wet sand is like a  
 dark gold.There is a mini railway line
 and you get on for 15p.There is a     
 great big hill called Tiger Hill.It is
 about 100 feet steep.It got its name  
 because a tiger was killed on it.     
  There is a cement house that the     
 soldiers used during the war.There are
 five rectangular windows.Last summer  
 there was a door but it got filled up 
 with cement.                          </content>
