		<title>13The Black Isle</title>
		<content> The south east corner of our Domesday 
 area is the "Black Isle".The village  
 of Conon Bridge is in this area ,but  
 not Maryburgh.The division is made by 
 the River Conon.The "Black Isle" is a 
 peculiar name for this area,because it
 is neither  black nor an island.In    
 fact the whole area is a peninsula of 
 very fertile land with the Cromarty   
 Firth to the north,the Beauly Firth to
 the south and the Morray Firth to the 
 east.It is an area of intensive arable
 farming and the Forestry Commision has
 large plantations of Fir and Pine     
 trees.This timber is grown mainly for 
 the paper making industry.The timber  
 is felled and transport by ship from  
 Inverness to Scandinavia where it is  
 made into wood pulp.Tis wood pulp is  
 brought back to this country where it 
 is made into paper.As on Brahan Estate
 the main crop is Barley.              </content>
