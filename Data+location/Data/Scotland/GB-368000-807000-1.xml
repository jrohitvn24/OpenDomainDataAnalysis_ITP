		<content> Midmar is situated in the North-East  
 of Scotland, about seventeen miles    
 West of Aberdeen.It is between the two
 'Mars', Braemar and Cromar, and is in 
 the Gordon District of Grampian Region
 .The name Midmar is derived from the  
 Anglo Saxon 'Midd' (middle) and the   
 Gaelic 'Mar' (marsh).So Midmar is the 
 middle marsh, between 'hill-marsh'    
 (Braemar) and Cromar.It is very spread
 out, with the village centre at the   
 school, and the cottages around it.The
 land is mainly agricultural.The       
 village is very ruraland quiet.The    
 hall and the school are the main      
 'communal' places,around which are    
 farms and cottages!Overall,Midmar is  
 agricultural, and there are many farms
 or converted steadings, showing that  
 farming has always dominated the      
 area.Recently,oil related industry has
 brought more residents.               </content>
