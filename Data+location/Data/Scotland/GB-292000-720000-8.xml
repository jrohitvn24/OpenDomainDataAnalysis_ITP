 We were talking to our school cook    
 about when she was a young girl on a  
 farm in{Madderty in the 1940's.}Four  
 men used to work on their farm but    
 only one man works there now. Everyone
 in the family helped out with the farm
 chores. They had animals,cows and     
 sheep,just like today, which were fed 
 on hay and turnips as they did not    
 make silage then. Instead of machines 
 for milking cows, they{milked by hand.
 They used Clydesale horses instead of 
 tractors. The crops grown were mostly 
{oats and wheat.}During the war{flax   
{and sugar beet}were grown. To harvest 
 crops{a binder}was used instead of a  
 combine. The wheat was put into stooks
 and built into haystacks to dry. A    
{threshing mill}was used for separating
 grain. She liked the life better then.
