		<content>   The towns near to Glamis, and in    
 particular Dundee, provide much of the
 employment for people living in the   
 area. Locally based employment is     
 mainly on the farms or estate work.   
 The hotels, shops, and the school     
 provide some employment and there are 
 a number of small businesses based in 
 the area.                             
   There is a wide range of living     
 standard in the area, from prosperous 
 farmers to relatively poorly paid     
 estate workers, and a moderate level  
 of unemployment.  Youth unemployment  
 is a serious problem.                 
   There is a fairly strong sense of   
 local identity, even among relatively 
 recent settlers in the area.  The     
 school and to a much lesser degree the
 church provide focal points in the    
 community.
