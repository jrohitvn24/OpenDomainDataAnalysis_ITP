		<title>08Inchnadamph Hotel</title>
		<content> The busiest time of year is{May and   
{June.}Up to{50 people}can stay in the 
 hotel at one time. Most like to go for
 drives while some fish and some walk  
 looking for flowers and rocks. Many   
 come for a rest.They are all ages from
 primary school pupils to 90 year_olds.
 The hotel closes from Oct to March for
 repairs although the bar stays open.  
 Up to 7,000 guests come per year,     
 including sometimes Lords and Ladies. 
 14 staff are kept in the summer.      
     In 1758 an inn was already well-  
 established here and a licence to sell
 spirits was granted to Kenneth Mac-   
 kenzie about 1775 for Â£6.  The present
 owners came to Inchnadamph in{1919}and
 remember the difficulties of guests in
 travelling to and fro. They had to be 
 collected from the station at Lairg or
 Invershin by car as "well_appointed"  
 hire cars were kept at the hotel.     </content>
