		<content> This area is one of great natural     
 beauty. There are hills, forests and  
 moorland. Plants and wild life are    
 found in great numbers and varieties. 
 The people find work on farms, estates
 or in Lochnagar Distillery. Their     
 homes are scattered and there is no   
 village as such. There is a two       
 teacher primary school, a post office 
 and a shop and Crathie Kirk which is  
 attended by the local people as well  
 as the Royal Family. Social activities
 in the area include badminton, golf,  
 cricket, curling, clay pigeon shooting
 and various women's groups. During the
 summer the area is very popular as a  
 tourist centre. In the winter when the
 weather can be most severe, the more  
 outlying farms and homesteads are     
 often cut off by heavy snowfalls.
