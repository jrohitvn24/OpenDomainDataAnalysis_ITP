		<content>  While the competitions were contin_  
 uing a number of side_shows were      
 available.The Brownies ran a "Roll the
 Penny" stall and the Guides ran an    
 "Aunt Sally".There was a lucky dip, a 
 home baking stall,and refreshments    
 were available too.Besides having     
 horse back rides the children could   
 enter their pets in the Pet Show.     
  Continuing throughout the Gala week  
 there was an interesting "Walking     
 Treasure Hunt," with the clues based  
 on the village.                       
  To complete the week's events the    
 Gala Queen and her attendants,along   
 with Grampian Television personality, 
 Kennedy Thomson,sat down to a meal in 
 a local hotel and afterwards danced   
 the night away _ so ended a successful
 week for the community of Insch.
