 including two housing schemes. The    
 first housing scheme (Whitelaw) was   
 built 31 years ago. The second scheme 
 (Wirliegart) was built 6 years ago.In 
 Whitelaw there are 10 houses.In       
 Whirliegart there are 19 houses. 8 of 
 these houses are for old people and   
 there is a warden who looks after     
 them. Both these housing schemes      
 belong to the Shetland Islands        
 Council. 4 new houses are being built 
 at the moment.                        
 The number of houses on crofts is 24. 
 15 of these are of the traditional    
 stone-built type which are small with 
 thick walls and roofs of wood covered 
 in felt or, in a few cases, modernised
 with tiles.                           
 There are 57 houses burning peat as   
 fuel.
