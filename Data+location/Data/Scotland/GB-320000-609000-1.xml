		<title>01Ettrick Valley</title>
		<content> In this part of Ettrick Valley the    
 river falls quickly from its source 3 
 miles away through narrow rocky gorges
 and running SW  - NE. Due to heavy    
 rainfall there can be a rapid rise or 
 fall in water level. The land is      
 mostly rough grazing for Blackface and
 Cheviot sheep with summer grazing for 
 cattle.                               
 Large stretches of the hill on Nether 
 Phawhope and over onto the southern   
 slopes facing Eskdalemuir are planted 
 with conifers There are two farms     
 houses and one new holiday house, but 
 there is evidence of early settlement 
 at Over Kirkhope, site of an early    
 Mediaeval chapel and village from the 
 days  when the lands of Ettrick Forest
 belonged to Melrose Abbey. The ancient
 forest, hunting ground of Scottish    
 Kings was cut down to make way for the
 more profitable  sheep                </content>
