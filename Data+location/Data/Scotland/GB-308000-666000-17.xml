		<title>17Kirknewton Gala Day</title>
		<content> In the middle of the 19th century the 
 highlight of the year was the         
 Kirknewton Play.The people followed a 
 Pipe Band round the Parish getting    
 refreshments on the way.A dance was   
 held at night on the village green.   
  Later Kirknewton Gymnastic Games were
 held in August each year.There were   
 races for quarrymen,ploughmen and     
 other workers.A schoolboys' one mile  
 relay was run."Cutting the Goose" was 
 a race in which the women tried to    
 catch a pig.                          
  In 1928 Kirknewton Gala Day began.   
 There is still a procession after the 
 band. The election of a Gala Queen has
 been re-introduced recently.The       
 inter-school relay races are still a  
 big attraction. It is a happy day for 
 young and old.
