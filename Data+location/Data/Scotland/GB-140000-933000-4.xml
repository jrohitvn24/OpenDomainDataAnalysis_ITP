		<title>04Housing Scheme-"The Cearns".</title>
		<content>   This scheme was built in 1974.  It  
 comprises of 217 terraced houses and  
 24 flats, built in blocks of 12 courts
 each court named in Gaelic after one  
 of the multiplicity of small islands  
 dotted around the Western Isles       
 coastline.  The Gaelic word for court 
 is"cearn,"hence the local designation 
 for the scheme-"The Cearns." The court
 names are e.g.Cearns Ronaidh,Phabaidh,
 Easaidh,Hiort etc.  The houses are 3  
 and 4 apt.,housing in the main,       
 families of 4 and 6,with an average   
 weekly rent of Â£22. Amenities include 
 a shop,3 swing parks, a nursery       
 school,junior and senior youthclubs   
 and a Sunday fellowship. About 3 years
 ago,8 blocks of semi-detatched 4 apt. 
 houses were added to the scheme,thus  
 bringing the population total in "The 
 Cearns"to approximately 1600.
