		<content> The church in our area is Glencorse   
 Parish Church.  It is Church of       
 Scotland.  Glencorse Parish Church is 
 100 years old on December 14th 1985.  
 It has 400 members but has seating for
 600 people.  Roland Anderson was the  
 architect.  Inside the church are     
 stained glass windows, a pipe organ   
 and a medieval baptismal font from the
 old church.  The ministers have been  
 Mr. Strong, Mr. Begbie, Dr. Kellas,   
 Mr. Hall and the present minister Mr. 
 James Manson.  He is responsible for 3
 churches, Roslin, Glencorse and       
 Bilston but he has an assistant, Mr.  
 Alan Hutchison. Outside the church    
 there is a cup and ring stone which is
 thought to be 8000 to 9000 years old  
 and which came from the site of the   
 previous church.  The Church Hall in  
 Milton Bridge was previously a        
 lemonade factory.                     </content>
