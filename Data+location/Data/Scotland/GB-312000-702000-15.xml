		<title>15Work in Orwell &amp; Milnathort</title>
		<content>   Agriculture and its related work    
 accounts for most employment in this  
 area.  Although the farms are highly  
 mechanized there are certain times of 
 the year and some crops that need a   
 large workforce. The potato harvest   
 this year required much more manual   
 labour than usual where fields were   
 too soft for potato harvesting machin-
 ery. Mr Moran employs mainly women    
 seasonal workers in his potato squads.
 Mr Eadie also hires local labour when 
 needed in season and for work in his  
 potato store.                         
   The blacksmith and the garages must 
 be able to deal with farm machinery.  
   In Milnathort(the part in our block)
 there are 15 shops employing about 40 
 people, other employment accounting   
 for about another 40. Many are women, 
 some part-time.                       
   Some people work in other towns     </content>
