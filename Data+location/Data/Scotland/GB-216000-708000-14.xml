		<content>   Everybody who comes to Cairndow     
 knows Charlie.He is a five year old   
 golden labrodor who lives at the      
 hotel. Sometimes instead of being     
 taken for a walk Charlie takes the    
 people for a walk. He shows  them     
 round the pinetum and shows them the  
 dam.If you clap him he will come over 
 and sit beside you but when he gets   
 bored he would go away with someone   
 else.He is not always good sometimes  
 he bites car wheels and he always     
 jumps into other peoples cars and goes
 to sleep in them tut tut tut.There is 
 a lady who gets bones for her dogs    
 delivered to her and he steals most of
 them.Except for all of the bad things 
 he does we all really like charlie.
