		<title>11Stonehouse Farm</title>
		<content> Mr McDermid lives on Stonehouse Farm  
 outside Hardgate. He spent the early  
 part of his life in Ayrshire. He is   
 interested in Clydesdale horses, and  
 has five of his own just for showing. 
 A good Clydesdale horse would cost    
 around about 2,000 pounds. Mares are  
 wanted more than stallions. Stallions 
 go at a killing price of around 250   
 pounds to be eaten by the Belgians.   
 He has 185 acres of land, 45 of which 
 are hay and silage, 85 of which are   
 for barley and 55 for grazing his 130 
 cattle.                               
 There is a new weed that has been     
 troubling Mr McDermid. It is called   
 soft brome grass. It has been here for
 about 10 years and it comes from New  
 Zealand. It is a problem because it   
 seeds more than a month before        
 anything else, and this makes it too  
 tough for silage.                     </content>
