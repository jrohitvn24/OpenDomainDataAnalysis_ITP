		<title>12HEALTH SERVICES _ DUNDONALD</title>
		<content>  The modern Health Centre in Dundonald
 offers a wide range of services.      
  Because the village is more than     
 three miles from the nearest Chemist, 
 local people can,after seeing one of  
 the doctors, have their prescriptions 
 filled there on the spot from a       
 well_stocked dispensary.              
  The Child Welfare Clinic is also     
 housed in the Health Centre. Mothers  
 can take their childern there for     
 innoculations and to receive advice   
 on looking after their families.      
 Mothers can buy baby food,vitamins,   
 orange juice,etc. there on a token    
 system.                               
  Mothers can have their own health    
 looked after at the Ante_Natal Clinic 
 where a Health Visitor is always on   
 duty.                                 
  Once a week, the Clinic receives a   
 visit from a Social Worker.           </content>
