		<content> This is the name given to the area of 
 land which stretches from the western 
 edge of the bay to the north of the   
 village between the main road and the 
 sea.  It is said that the name derives
 from the cell of St Pansandus, a      
 Celtic missionary.  The scanty ruins  
 of Kilspindie Castle lie in a field   
 just below the parish churchyard.  At 
 Kilspindie Point itself is the former 
 custom-house, Aberlady once being the 
 port for Haddington.  The house is now
 converted to domestic occupation.     
 Next to it is the club-house of       
 Kilspindie Golf Course.  Golf is      
 played over the land that stretches   
 behind the shoreline to Craigielaw    
 Point, the eastern extremity of       
 Gosford Bay.  At present Kilspindie   
 has a membership of 450 men, 150 women
 and almost 50 juniors.
