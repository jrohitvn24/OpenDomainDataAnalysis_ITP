		<title>01DALWHINNIE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The coordinates 02600783 contain the  
 village of Dalwhinnie in the Badenoch 
 and Strathspey district of the        
 Highland Region. Within this area is a
 distillery, two hotels, a shop, post  
 office, school, garage and a railway  
 station. The main employment is       
 provided by the distillery and the    
 railway. The River Truim flows        
 alongside the village. Dalwhinnie is  
 the highest village in the Highland   
 Region standing at approximately      
 1100feet above sea level. It stands on
 the old A9 midway between Perth and   
 Inverness and was by-passed by the new
 A9 in 1975.                           
 The 1981 Census reported that         
 Dalwhinnie had a population of 119 and
 there are fewer inhabitants than that 
 today.
