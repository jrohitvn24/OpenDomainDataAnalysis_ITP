		<title>12Shopping in Aith</title>
		<content> There is only one grocery shop in     
 Aith. It sells a range of goods such  
 as clothes as well as groceries. It   
 also delivers supplies to old people  
 who phone in their orders. Some       
 customers have accounts and pay them  
 monthly. There are 5 people employed  
 in the shop.                          
 Many people go once a week for their  
 supplies from Lerwick where prices are
 lower.                                
 There are a number of vans visiting   
 the area such as the fish van and the 
 fish and chip van.                    
 There are also mobile banks and a     
 mobile library.                       
 Many people in the area buy goods from
 mail order clubs. This is because the 
 choice is better than in the local    
 shops and there is the option of      
 paying over a number of weeks.
