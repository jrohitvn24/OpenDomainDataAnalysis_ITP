		<title>08LOLLIPOP LADIES</title>
		<content> Lollipop ladies are School Crossing   
 Patrollers, who help children to cross
 busy roads on their way to and from   
 school.  They are called Lollipop     
 Ladies because they carry a pole      
 shaped like a giant lollipop with the 
 words{STOP CHILDREN}printed on it.    
 Mrs McCourt has been a Lollipop Lady  
 for nearly ten years.  She wears      
 special clothing which includes a     
 white linen coat, a fluorescent-yellow
 waterproof PVC waistcoat, white       
 waterproof trousers, a yellow and     
 white PVC hat and black gloves.       
 She was once nearly involved in an    
 accident when she was on duty.  A boy 
 was almost knocked down when a car    
 failed to stop at the crossing.  This 
 really upset her but apart from this  
 incident she enjoys her work very     
 much, but she still gets nervous with 
 cars and lorries speeding towards her!</content>
