		<content>{CLIMATE AND WEATHER }Broughty Ferry's 
 situation on the Estuary of the Tay   
 makes it subject to frequent coastal  
 mists and fog, spoiling summer days.  
 Winters are not usually severe, with  
 snow rarely lying for prolonged       
 periods. In the summer, sea breezes   
 keep temperatures lower than inland,so
 it is rarely very warm.               
{CONSERVATION }The Parks Department    
 keeps the Parks looking beautiful.    
 Attractive displays on the road verges
 greatly enhance the area. The Sea     
 Front is particularly attractive      
 especially in the area developed as a 
 rockery.                              
{POLLUTION }Dundee Harbour,with a small
 oil terminal, is a source of concern  
 regarding pollution. Strict codes of  
 practice have been set and to date the
 River is in a healthy state.
