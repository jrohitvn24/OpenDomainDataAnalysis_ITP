		<content>{ Arbuthnott Parish Church}is the local
 Kirk, and is one of the few           
 pre-Reformation churches still in use 
 for public worship. At 10am. on       
 Sundays an average of 20 people gather
 for Morning Service.  There are 9     
 Elders, 2 of whom are ladies.  The    
 Minister also has charge of Kinneff   
 Parish, and lives in the Manse at     
 Kinneff.                              
  The Arbuthnott Church stands         
 on ground which has been consecrated  
 since the 13th century at least.  It  
 was originally a Roman Catholic       
 Chapel, but is now{Church of Scotland.
 The burial ground surrounding the     
 Church contains memorials to many     
 local families, including the         
 Arbuthnott Family.                    
  The Roman Catholics and Episcopalians
 have to go outside the area to their  
 places of worship.                    </content>
