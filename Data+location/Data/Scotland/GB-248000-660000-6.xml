		<content> Altogether{Harelaw Farm}takes up 100  
 acres. Grass is grown and used for    
 making hay and silage. Barley is also 
 grown and with the silage is used to  
 feed the cows. Rain and drought       
 sometimes affect the crops.Last year  
 drought caused a lot of damage. There 
 are not many trees and what they have 
 are deciduous.                        
 Animals are fed by hand but most work 
 is done by machinery.They have{85 cows
{120 followers and one Shetland pony.} 
 Hay, barley and silage feed is        
 supplemented by a mineral cake the    
 amount of which given depends on the  
 milk yield of the cow.The higher the  
 yield the higher the quota of mineral 
 cake.Animals are rarely bought but    
 reared from their own stock.The       
 heaviest which they sold last year    
 weighed nearly 1 ton and fetched      
 Â£1000.                                </content>
