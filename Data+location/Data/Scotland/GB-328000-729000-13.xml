		<title>13LONGFORGAN - ANTIQUE DEALER-</title>
		<content> This business was started in a country
 location to take full advantage of the
 areas central location in relation to 
 Dundee,Perth,Edinburgh and Glasgow.   
 The rural location makes an excellent 
 environment for 'child-raising', and  
 the proximity of Dundee with its many 
 facilities and activities and shopping
 centres, make this location ideal for 
 our dual purpose needs. Our business  
 has flourished at this location,      
 probably due to the relaxed way of    
 conducting business, allied to easy   
 parking and a generally pleasant      
 environment. The burdens of city rates
 and planning authorities, and general 
 city life hustle, make a possible move
 for any trade a real choice and gives 
 the family a lot of scope for outdoor 
 leisure activities, which would not be
 available in a city environment.
