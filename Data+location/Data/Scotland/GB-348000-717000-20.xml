		<title>20FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS ?</title>
		<content> 3 development schemes were under      
 discussion in 1984-85.                
 EDEN ESTUARY. A plan to reclaim 200   
 acres of mudflats in order to build a 
 National Golf School,practice ground  
 and sports complex was proposed by a  
 group of businessmen. Strong protests 
 have been made that it would endanger 
 wildlife in the Estuary. ( Page 04).  
 STEP-ROCK. This,once popular,open-air 
 swimming pool is now derelict. The    
 District Council has been exploring   
 ways of redeveloping the site. A fish 
 farm or a sea-life centre have been   
 suggested. Discussions are continuing.
 WORLD OF GOLF MUSEUM.The District     
 Council launched plans in 1984 to     
 build a museum on the Bruce Embankment
 to house the Spalding collection of   
 golf memorabilia. It is hoped that    
 this can be completed by 1987 at a    
 cost of about Â£2.5 million.           </content>
