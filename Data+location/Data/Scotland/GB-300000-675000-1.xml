		<title>01      Linlithgow</title>
		<content>{ }Linlithgow,a very old historic town,
 is situated about three miles south of
 the  River Forth and about twenty     
 miles West of Edinburgh.The name      
 "Linlithgow" means "Lake in the damp  
 hollow".                              
   Today Linlithgow is growing quite   
 fast and now it is a big town with a  
 population of over ten thousand.There 
 have been more houses and schools     
 built in Linlithgow to keep up with   
 the increasing population.            
   Our class carried out a survey of   
 the good and bad points of            
 Linlithgow.Most people criticized     
 the town's lack of recreational and   
 community facilities and also its     
 increasing vandalism.However they did 
 feel that it had a very pleasant      
 environment and a good community      
 spirit and was a good centre for      
 access to both Edinburgh and Glasgow. </content>
