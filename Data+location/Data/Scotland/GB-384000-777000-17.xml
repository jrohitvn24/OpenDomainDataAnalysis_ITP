		<title>17THE YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content> One year ago, a youth club was started
 in Catterline. It has two snooker     
 tables and one  Atari which plays     
 Van-Guard and Pac-Man. Atari is a game
 which is played through a television. 
 We have table tennis and now after a  
 year's hard work of fund raising, we  
 have raised enough money to buy extra 
 equipment, which includes- another    
 Atari, a dartboard and darts and      
 swingball. We raised the money doing  
 sponsored walks which means that      
 people promise to give you money for  
 every mile that you walk. We raised   
 Â£310.00 on the first walk and Â£350.00 
 on the second walk. We have three     
 football teams including a girls'     
 team. We go to Mackie Academy to play 
 Unihok and also to swim. Mackie       
 Academy is the secondary school that  
 Catterline pupils go to when they are 
 about eleven years old.               </content>
