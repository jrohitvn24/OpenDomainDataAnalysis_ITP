		<content> The area's centre is Rhynie vilage    
 which for many centuries was an       
 important agricultural centre.   The  
 area is soaked in former glories and  
 history eg Mackay of Uganda, Anderson 
 Bay, Fortified Fort.   Housing is a   
 mixture of substantial private and    
 local authority.   The size and high  
 maintainance of the gardens           
 immediately strikes the eye.   Next   
 year a sheltered housing complex of   
 fourteen units will be opened.        
 Employment is a mixture of small      
 family businesses and employment      
 opportunities outside the area.   Very
 few are involved in the "Oil          
 Industry".   There is virtually no    
 long term unemployment in the area.   
 Entertainment is centred around the   
 two school halls and during the winter
 months there is a wide variety of     
 activities available such as bowling. </content>
