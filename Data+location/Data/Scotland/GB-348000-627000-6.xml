 nine holes just to the west of        
 Selkirk.  On the highest point is the 
 Slkirk Transmitter which broadcasts   
 television to the surrounding area.   
 Whitmuir Hall is a holiday self       
 catering accomodation with some       
 facilities for entertainment within   
 the Hall.  Their is an old resrevoir  
 which is used for fishing.            
 The main road which runs through the  
 area is the A799 selkirk to St
