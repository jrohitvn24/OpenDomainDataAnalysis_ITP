		<content> In the survey of our area the things  
 that give people most cause for       
 concern are unemployment, rates and   
 nuclear weapons.Thirty four per.cent. 
 of those interviewed gave rateable    
 values as their prior concern in 1985.
 Another 44% said it was               
 unemployment.The remainder mentioned  
 nuclear weapons first.                
 The local issues that are uppermost in
 their minds are vandalism, the state  
 of repair of council housing, the     
 state of the roads and pavements, the 
 lack of leisure facilities, the way   
 that ratepayers money is "squandered."
 Each of these issues were mentioned by
 between 10 and 12 per.cent. of those  
 interviewed.                          
 One person said he is annoyed by the  
 attitudes of Asian immigrants in the  
 area and the apparent apathy of the   
 local people.                         </content>
