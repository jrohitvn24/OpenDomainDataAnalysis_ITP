		<title>10The Big Tree</title>
		<content>   The tallest tree in Great Britain is
 at Cairndow in the gardens which are  
 owned by Lady Glenkinglas.Her husband 
 Lord Glenkinglas died last year.They  
 were the main founders of the         
 gardens.The gardens stretch from the  
 Rest and Be Thankful to the shores of 
 Loch Fyne.Part of the gardens is      
 called a Pinetum because that is the  
 name for a collection of trees.       
   The tallest tree in Britain is 200  
 feet high and 20 feet round the girth.
 It looks very imposing from any angle.
 The Pinetums collection of trees is   
 quite amazing.There are dozens of     
 rhododendrons in the walks of all     
 different colours:white purple red    
 pink orange and lots more.They have   
 also got azalea bluebells daffodils   
 and primroses.If you visit when they  
 are in bloom you would see a          
 spectacular display of colours.       </content>
