		<title>18Bourtie community spririt</title>
		<content> People in Bourtie have long been      
 adapted to the hardships of isolation 
 and weather and its is common for     
 neighbours to extend a helping hand in
 times of difficulty.  New members of  
 the community are welcomed warmly,    
 especially if they show an interest in
 the Kirk (church) at Kirton of        
 Bourtie, around which many activities 
 centre. For example, when the new     
 minister in 1982 thought the church   
 could do with sprucing up, the        
 community rallied and held a          
 barndance and barbecue on one of the  
 farms and all proceeds went twards the
 decoratin of the Kirk interior.  When 
 roads are closed by snowdrifts or one 
 person's well waer becomes            
 contaminated, as happened in a sudden 
 snow thaw in 1985, neighbours quickly 
 offer to shuttle in food on the       
 tractor or provide clean water.       </content>
