		<title>07KIRKCOWAN CHURCH</title>
		<content> In the past there have been 3 churches
 but today only 1 is used,while 1 is a 
 ruin and the other is used as a       
 workshop.In{1658}the original church  
 was built but was replaced by the     
 present building in{1834.}Because     
 there was a shortage of ministers,in{ 
{1982}Kirkcowan church was{linked with 
{Wigtown}8.7mls away.The manse in the  
 village was sold and used as a Guest  
 House,while the minister now lives in 
 Wigtown.Only 1 service is held on     
 Sundays.About 20 children attend{     
{Sunday School}which meets first in the
 church and then in the school,across  
 the road.Once a month about 15 members
 of the{Women's Guild}meet in the      
 Church Vestry.They have speakers who  
 demonstrate crafts and explain the    
 work of the church.They also raise    
 money to keep up the church.
