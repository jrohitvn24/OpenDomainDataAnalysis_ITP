		<content> Half of the area is partially wooded, 
 which is unusual in this region. The  
 trees have been planted and do not    
 occur naturally.                      
 The main feature is Haddo House, the  
 home of Lady Aberdeen. The house is   
 under the care of the National Trust  
 and is open to the public from May to 
 October.                              
 Haddo Country Park is open to the     
 public throughout the year and the    
 Haddo "Rangers" organise talks to     
 encourage a greater awareness of the  
 countryside.                          
 International concerts and Amateur    
 Dramatics are held in the Library in  
 the House and in the adjacent         
 Community Hall.                       
 The remaining area is rural - few farm
 buildings, rough grassland and        
 farmland. The land gently undulates.
