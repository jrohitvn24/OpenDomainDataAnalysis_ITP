		<content> THE {museum}moved to its present home 
 in 1858 and its independent funding by
 the Orkney Natural History Society is 
 jealously guarded. It has 6 monthly   
 exhibitions,Orkney/Stromness based.The
 most popular was 'SCAPA FLOW'and the  
 current one is 'SINKING OF ROYAL OAK  
 Mrs.Firth,the curator,aged 62,and     
 curator for 23 years,values all       
 exhibits esp.stuffed birds.           
 The {library,}built in 1900, has about
 200 members who borrow around 1400    
 books every week from its 9000        
 stock.Children can take out 2 and     
 adults 6. Valuable old Orkney books   
 are kept in the building for reference
 there. All topics are covered and     
 there's large print books for those   
 with poor eyesight. A reading room has
 newspapers and many come to read them.
 Sadly many books are never returned.
