		<title>01THE AREA AROUND BEN HOGH</title>
		<content> Ben Hogh is the highest hill on the   
 island of Coll, at 339 feet. To the   
 west lies the rocky and hilly coast   
 with Hogh Bay and its long white sandy
 beach backed by tall sand dunes and   
 Marram grass. To the north and east an
 area of usually wet boggy heather     
 covered peatground with 2 small       
 frashwater lochs and one cultivated   
 field of hay in the south in the      
 Machair area. there are 6 dwelling    
 houses in this area, 4 of which are   
 lived in. Also remains of old ruined  
 stone buildings. The land is scarred  
 from the past with the marks of       
 lazybeds. This is farming country     
 where sheep and cattle roam over the  
 rough grazing. There is some dencing  
 which seperates property boundaries,  
 rather than dividing fields.
