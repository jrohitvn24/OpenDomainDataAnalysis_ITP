		<content> Our doctor is one of 3 who look after 
 the well being of the communities     
 around the shores of Luce Bay, from   
 the Mull of Galloway almost to        
 Portwilliam, a distance of well over  
 40 kilometres of coastline. Like the  
 minister the doctor needs his car! He 
 travels extensively and often has to  
 visit patients in the small hospital  
 in Stranraer, where all but the most  
 dangerous illnesses are treated. Very 
 seriously ill people are taken either 
 to Dumfries, 120 kilometres along the 
 VERY BUSY A75 Euro-route, or to Ayr   
 which is 96 kilometres north on a     
 twisting twining road! The doctor's   
 surgery is in the village and in      
 common with his colleagues in Drummore
 and Glenluce, he does his own drugs   
 dispensing thereby alleviating the    
 need to visit chemists in Stranraer,  
 10 kilometres away.                   </content>
