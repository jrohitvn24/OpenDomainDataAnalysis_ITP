		<content>{Easterfield}is a small rural{school   
 which first admitted children in{1870.
 At that time the school comprised one 
 building and housed{three classes.}In 
{1921}the roll was{48}but attendance at
 school varied from day to day         
 depending on the needs of the local   
 farmers.{Potato picking}time was an   
 occasion when few children attended   
 school. The{weather}also played a part
 in restricting attendance as some     
 children had to walk several miles to 
 school. A{hall}was built in the{1930's
 which was used as a{Dance Hall.       
 Eventually this became part of the    
 school and is now a classroom for the 
{Infant Class.}The{Main Building}now   
 comprises{one class, kitchen, office  
 and{toilets.}In{1985}the roll is{26   
 with{2 full time teachers}and visiting
 staff in{Art, PE}and{Music.
