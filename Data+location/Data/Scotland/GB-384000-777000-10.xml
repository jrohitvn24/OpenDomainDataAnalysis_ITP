		<title>10FARM MACHINERY</title>
		<content> In 1985 the farmer has many machines  
 to help him. He has the tractor which 
 is now highly developed for work and  
 safety and can be up to 200           
 Horse Power. There are many           
 attachments for the tractor - ploughs 
 to turn over the soil, bogeys used for
 carrying, harrowers to cultivate the  
 soil and cover seeds, rollers to      
 compress the earth, sprayers to kill  
 weeds and promote growth, sowing      
 machines to plant seeds, mowers to cut
 hay and silage, turnip harvesters to  
 lift turnips, balers to compress straw
 or hay into bundles and machines for  
 lifting out stones. The farmer uses a 
 combine harvester to harvest the      
 crops. This machine cuts and dresses  
 which means separating the grain from 
 the straw. The grain is then poured   
 into a cart and stored in a granary   
 where it is heat dried.               </content>
