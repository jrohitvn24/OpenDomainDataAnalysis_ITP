		<content> Primary Schools in secluded glens fed 
 into Towie Junior Secondary which had 
 on average 140 pupils.Now it is a two 
 teacher primary with 30 on its role,  
 most other schools having closed in   
 the area.The 3R's were soundly taught 
 to children wearing short trousers /  
 skirts &amp; tackety boots or barefoot in 
 summer.Discipline was strict and      
 regimental,a sharp contrast to today's
 modern methods of teaching.           
 In living memory,8-12 crofts have been
 replaced by 1 large unit,denuding the 
 glens of families.The older generation
 remember a working day from 5.30am to 
 6pm and often at 9pm,the Clydesdale   
 horses were fed &amp; groomed before      
 tractors &amp; new machinery replaced this
 from the 1930's onwards.              
 Roads were not surfaced until the     
 1920's, hence were rutted &amp; dusty.
