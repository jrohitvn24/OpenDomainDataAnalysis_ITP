		<content> There are several disused serpentine  
 quarries in this area which were      
 worked extensively during World War   
 II.In the spoil heaps around them we  
 found a great variety of serpentine   
 samples of varying colour and         
 hardness.There were also traces of    
 many other minerals.At that time there
 was little mechanisation and we could 
 see the tracks that the 'bogies' had  
 followed when they were loaded and    
 man-handled down the rough hillside to
 the pier to await shipment.The        
 surrounding area of the quarries is   
 unimproved heathland with a great     
 variety of wild flowers including the 
 unique Edmondston's Arctic Mouse-ear  
 Chickweed.At Alma there is a disused  
 limestone quarry which was worked over
 many generations for building purposes
 The quarry floor was dry and no       
 heather grew on this limestone band.  </content>
