		<title>15Strathmiglo's Bus Service</title>
		<content> Not everyone in Strathmiglo has a     
 car,so many people depend on public   
 transport. There is one bus service   
 which serves Strathmiglo and that is  
 the one which links St Andrews -      
 Stirling/Glasgow.Some of the nearest  
 main towns are Perth, Glenrothes,     
 Dundee and Kirkcaldy. There are no    
 bus services to take people directly  
 to these towns. Glenrothes is about   
 ten miles away from Strathmiglo.You   
 can get there by car in about 15      
 minutes.To get to Glenrothes by bus it
 is necessary to go first from         
 Strathmiglo to Auchtermuchty to       
 connect with the service between Perth
 and Kirkcaldy which passes through    
 Glenrothes. The whole journey would   
 take at least an hour.Local people are
 worried that the privitisation of bus 
 services would mean an even poorer    
 service for Strathmiglo.              </content>
