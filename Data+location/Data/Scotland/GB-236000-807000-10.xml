		<title>10ABBEY SCHOOL,FORT AUGUSTUS(1</title>
		<content> The people of{Fort-Augustus}were      
 shocked to hear in March 1985 that{   
{The Abbey School }was possibly going  
 to close.The closure of this private  
 boarding school would have meant the  
 loss of almost 40 local jobs.These    
 included teachers,groundsmen,catering 
 staff and construction workers.The    
 principal reason for the school's     
 impending closure was lack of         
 pupils.They needed 100 pupils to be   
 viable and the roll was falling.      
   Almost immediately the local        
 district councillor organised the {   
{Save the Abbey School Action          
{Committee.}With some help from the    
 local district council this group set 
 about trying to save the              
 school.However things did not look too
 promising.
