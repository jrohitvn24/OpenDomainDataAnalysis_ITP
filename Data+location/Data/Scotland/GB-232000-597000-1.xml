		<content> Until 1979, these steep grassy hills  
 were upland sheep pastures, mainly    
 wet, soft and peaty, threaded by a    
 single narrow moorland road rising    
 from 200m a.s.l. to 337m in the North.
 The hills, though steep, are rarely   
 craggy.  There is only one inhabited  
 dwelling, the lonely shepherd's       
 cottage of Doughty.                   
                                       
 Since 1979, more than half of the     
 block - the Black Hill of Garleffin   
 - has been planted with conifers,     
 mainly by the Forestry Commission:    
 but square 1 was planted on behalf of 
 a private owner, by Scottish Woodland 
 Owners (Commercial) Ltd.              
                                       
 Garleffin Fell (425m) in squares 7/8, 
 forms the watershed between streams   
 flowing NE to the River Girvan and    
 those flowing SE to River Stinchar.   </content>
