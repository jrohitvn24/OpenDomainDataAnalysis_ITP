		<title>07The Glenisla Games.</title>
		<content> The Glenisla Games began in 1856. They
 are always held in the Haugh of Fortar
 on a Friday in August. Glenisla school
 pupils have a day off school and most 
 of them attend the Games. Although it 
 is a small Highland Gathering many    
 people travel some distance to attend.
 It is a happy occasion when locals and
 visitors alike have the chance to get 
 together and socialise. The events    
 which are held include tossing the    
 caber,hammer throwing,piping,Highland 
 Dancing and Cumberland Wrestling.     
 There are stalls selling home-made    
 sweets,baking etc. A marquee is set up
 in which food and drink are served. At
 the close of the games teams compete  
 in tug o'war and a race to the top of 
 Mount Blair is held. In the evening a 
 dance is held in the local hall to    
 round off the day.
