 often have to undergo a{"blackening"  
 ritual usually carried out on their   
 last day at work prior to being       
 married. The custom  is that they are 
 captured by workmates and friends and 
 blackened with{oil, treacle or shoe   
{polish.}Then they are either put on a 
 vehicle or walked through the streets,
 often accompanied by bell ringing and 
 very often ending up in the water.    
 Quite a number of womenfolk turn out  
 to see a wedding when the bride or    
 groom are well known in the area and  
 well wishers{throw confetti}over the  
 happy couple after the wedding        
 ceremony. It is also the custom for   
 the bride's father to{throw coins}from
 his taxi onto the road for the local  
 children who have gathered to scramble
