		<title>02ECOLOGY FIELD TRIP</title>
		<content> Today 30th May,1985 we went on a field
 trip to the Dornoch Links. It was very
 noisy because the R.A.F. jets  were on
 practice bombing runs over the firth. 
 We saw common and black backed gulls, 
 an oyster catcher wading in the burn  
 and a skylark was singing. The dunes  
 are covered in marram grass and many  
 rabbit burrows. Amongst the grass we  
 found common wild flowers such as     
 meadow buttercup, birds foot trefoil, 
 vetch and speedwell. Later we walked  
 across moorland to Loch an Treel. The 
 ground is peaty and mostly covered in 
 gorse,heather or reeds where it is    
 boggy. Curlews and seagulls were      
 nesting in the heather. Seagulls can  
 be a nuisance because they attack     
 lambs and damage young tree plantions.
 The numbers of seagulls are increasing
 every year so some of the eggs are    
 destroyed to control the population.  </content>
