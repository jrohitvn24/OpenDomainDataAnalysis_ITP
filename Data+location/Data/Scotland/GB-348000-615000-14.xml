		<title>14BURNHEAD TOWER.</title>
		<content> The tower was built in l487 just under
 5OO years ago. The tower was built of 
 stone on the flat because if the tower
 was built of wood and raised from the 
 ground it would be easy to set alight.
 The tower was owned by James Scott and
 built by him. In the years of the     
 Border raids all the men and boys were
 killed. There was only one person left
 in the tower and she married a man    
 called Watson and that is how the     
 owner's name was changed to           
 Scott-Watson. The house that is joined
 onto the tower was built in the       
 l7OO's. At the top of the tower is a  
 sort of ledge that they would light a 
 fire on and that would warn the other 
 towers that the English were          
 approaching. The door opened outwards 
 and it was made of iron so that it    
 could not be rammed down with a big   
 trunk.                                </content>
