		<content>     The Society was founded in 1967 to
 aid{preservation, development and im_ 
{provement}of features of public amen_ 
 ity.                                  
   We have succeeded in having Victor_ 
 ian facades retained in Ayr streets   
 where{redevelopment}has taken place.  
 We draw on the professional expert_   
 ise of our 150 members to make con_   
 structive comment on proposed new     
 buildings and to identify old features
 worthy of preservation.   We monitor  
 the{district planning register}to     
 identify proposals of interest and    
 this year commented on many features  
 of the{five year plan for land use    
 presented by the Council.   We have   
 funded a project to renew the garden  
 at{15th century Loudoun Hall}and      
 annually run a schools competition to 
 encourage children to extend their    
 awareness of their surroundings.      </content>
