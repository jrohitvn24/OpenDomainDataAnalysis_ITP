  Horticultural Society - Letham.      
                                       
 The society was founded in 1890.   A  
 summer show is held on the 2nd        
 Saturday in August and a Bulb Show is 
 usually held in February or March.    
 (This year, instead of a Bulb Show, a 
 Gardener's Question Time was organised
 in the Village Hall.)                 
 The main event is the Letham Show.    
 It is held in a field at a local farm.
   There is a large marquee where      
 people enter flowers, vegetables,     
 baking, jam, wine and craft work to be
 judged.   There are special           
 competitions for children.            
    In the afternoon a gym khana is    
 held.   Refreshments such as coffee,  
 ice cream and juice may be bought.    
 August 1985 will see the 83rd Show.   </content>
