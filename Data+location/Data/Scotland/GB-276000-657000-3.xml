		<title>03HOUSING IN THE LOCAL AREA</title>
		<content>  The majority of the houses in the    
 area were built by the council before 
 World War II.  These houses are now   
 being modernised which includes the   
 installation of full central heating  
 and the rewiring of the houses.  The  
 tenants of these homes are now being  
 given the opportunity to buy the      
 houses they now live in.              
  In this area thr are four large      
 private housing estates.  Other       
 private houses can be found throughout
 the area.  The age of these houses can
 vary from about 150 years to modern   
 kit houses which are just being built.
  In one of the six villages there are 
 blocks of three_storey flats.  These  
 have become run down and are now in a 
 serious state of disrepair.
