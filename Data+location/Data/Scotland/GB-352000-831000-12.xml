		<content> There were several schools in the     
 parish but only one (NJ522320 Duffs   
 School) was within this block. This   
 was closed 12th Nov 1962 after the new
 school in the Lane was opened in that 
 Oct with 49 pupils, rising to 65 with 
 the extra pupils. A two-teacher open- 
 plan classroom was added in 1980.     
 The area of the school and ground is  
 0.7411h. The average roll is 50 with  
 3/2 full-time teachers (depending on  
 numbers) and 6 visiting teachers. The 
 usual subjects are taught with main   
 emphasis placed on a good rapport     
 between staff and pupils. There exists
 also a large fund of good-will between
 home and school with parents helping  
 in various activities.We have an      
 annual concert/ play/pantomime and    
 party and annual outing for the whole 
 family. A play-group is run by parents
 for the pre-school children.          </content>
