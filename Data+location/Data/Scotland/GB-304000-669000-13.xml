		<content>   My favourite hobby is B.M.X.ing. I  
 like it because it is exciting racing 
 along the shale track and riding over 
 the jumps and bumps. I like to enter  
 competitions - it is great fun. If you
 come first, second or third in a race 
 then you get into the final and if you
 are placed in that then you get a     
 medal, a trophy or even a cash prize. 
 I once won Â£5 for coming second!      
 Another time I won a medal but I lost 
 it on the way home and I was pretty   
 upset about it. I still race          
 occasionally but not so often now as I
 am becoming more interested in        
 freestyling. I am not good enough yet 
 to compete but I can do a bunnyhop,   
 wheeliehop, kickturn, sidekick and    
 front and back hops. I hope one day to
 compete but at the moment I just have 
 fun practising.
