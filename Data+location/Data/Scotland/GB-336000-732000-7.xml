		<content>{Clatto}was opened as a Country Park   
 and watersports area in June 1979.    
 One really valuable service provided  
 by the park is the Ranger Service.    
 The Rangers are there to give advice  
 and help, to provide information, to  
 look after the park and its visitors  
 and to guard against all risks to     
 safety.  The Rangers know a lot about 
 the history of the park, about the    
 water system and about the animals and
 plants as well, of course, as all the 
 water sports.                         
 Available at{Clatto}are windsurfing at
 Â£2 per hour/Â£5 per three hours;       
 canoeing and rowing at 30p per half   
 hour; sailing at Â£4.50 and fishing at 
 50p per day (though you are not       
 allowed to take the fish home).
