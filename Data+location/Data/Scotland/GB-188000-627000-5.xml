		<content> **************************************
   Quite a few people come to Shiskine 
 and Blackwaterfoot for their holidays,
 mostly city folk from the mainland.   
   There are four hotels in the area,  
 and many people stay in them.         
 Traditionally, many people in the     
 valley let out cottages or even their 
 own house as they move out to a'summer
 house' for the summer. Some houses    
 provide bed &amp; breakfast, and there are
 some newer chalets for letting. Some  
 people, of course, own a second home  
 in Shiskine.                          
   Tourists may have a holiday golfing,
 pony treking, fishing or hill-walking.
 Blackwaterfoot has a safe sandy beach 
 in one part, and caves and rock pools 
 to explore in another.                
  {Many people come back to Shiskine   
{year after year.
