		<title>18LOCAL HISTORY - FORRES EAST</title>
		<content>  The site of the Tolbooth has always  
 been the same.  It is impossible to   
 say when the first Tolbooth at Forres,
 was erected.  As far back as the      
 Forres Records extend, the meetings of
 the Provost, Magistrates, and Town    
 Councillors are reported as being     
 convened in the Tolbooth.  At the     
 bottom of the Tolbooth is a jail which
 is no longer used and very important  
 scrolls or books are locked up in the 
 back of the room.  The inside is set  
 out like a court room with the judge's
 chair in the middle at the back.      
  The foundation stone of the present  
 Tolbooth was laid in 1838.  The       
 architect for the building was William
 Robertson whose design was based on   
 that of the previous eartly eighteenth
 century building on the same site.    
 The adjoining former prison was       
 completed about 1849.                 </content>
