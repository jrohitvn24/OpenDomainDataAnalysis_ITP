 breakfast which is usually toast and  
 tea.Then I get washed and dressed,get 
 my school bag ready and leave the     
 house about 8.30.It takes about 15    
 minutes to get to school and as I     
 don't start until 9a.m.I have time to 
 play before going in.I usually play   
 at Aunties and Uncles or skipping.When
 I go in I do mental and then maths.I  
 have a break of 15 minutes to play at
