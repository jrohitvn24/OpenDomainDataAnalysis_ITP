		<content>  Curling is the latest sport to catch 
 on in Pitlochry with a rink opening in
 1982, though for those playing several
 times a week it can be quite expensive
 - a sheet of ice for eight players    
 costs Â£28, for a game lasting two and 
 a quarter hours.                      
  Equipment, however, is not too       
 costly: a brush, needed for sweeping  
 the ice and keeping the stone on line,
 costs Â£15, while a slider kit , smooth
 soled footwear, is around Â£10.        
  The object of the game is to get your
 stones closer to the centre of the    
 house than your opponents'.With the   
 "skip" in the "house" telling the     
 players what to do, the stone is      
 played and the sweepers get busy. The 
 sport gets ite name because you turn  
 the stone to make it "curl" round     
 other stones. It is a much more       
 difficult than it looks.              </content>
