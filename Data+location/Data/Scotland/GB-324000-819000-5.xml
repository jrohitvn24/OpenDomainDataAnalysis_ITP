		<title>05THE BRAES HALL</title>
		<content>   The hall is run  by a committee made
 up of  all  interested  people  in the
 district. In  the  last  few years the
 committee has run a barbecue and dance
 in the summer both to entertain and to
 raise funds  for  the  upkeep  of  the
 hall. It also  organises a bonfire and
 fireworks  display around 5th November
 and at Christmas  there is a party and
 social.                               
   During the winter evenings  the hall
 is used by the local youth club and by
 the badminton club.  The youth club is
 open to all  children between 8 and 15
 with  archery, uni-hockey,  darts  and
 snooker a few  of  the  recreations on
 offer. The badminton club has a junior
 section for the under 11's, as well as
 a section  for  the  older  child  and
 another for adults.
