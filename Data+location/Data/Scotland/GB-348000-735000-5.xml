		<title>05CHURCHES:CHURCH OF SCOTLAND</title>
		<content> Both villages have a church, both     
 Church of Scotland. The churches tend 
 to reflect the nature of the          
 countryside and its inhabitants-      
 traditional and conservative- and both
 face slowly dwindling congregations.  
 Both parishes are linked charges, i.e.
 the ministers at each are responsible 
 for more than one church. Within the  
 past two years, the Hillocks Church,  
 linked with Newbigging Church, was    
 closed because the shrinking          
 congregation no longer justified its  
 existence. Also within the past two   
 years, the Churches at Newbigging and 
 Monikie, served by the same minister, 
 have been reduced to one weekly       
 service in rotation for a trial       
 period. At the end of this trial      
 period, if the numbers continue to    
 decline, the Church of Scotland will  
 insiston the closure of one church.   </content>
