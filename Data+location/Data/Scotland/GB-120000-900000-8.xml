		<title>08Telephone at Rhenigidale</title>
		<content> This is a radio telephone and the     
 instrument is not in a phone box but  
 in a house. You can't dial your number
 but instead you ring the operator and 
 tell them your number and they will   
 get you through. If you want to ring  
 Rhenigidale you ring the operator and 
 ask for Rhenigidale 1. The signal is  
 sent from a hut above the village to  
 Gairloch and then to the nearest      
 exchange at Ullapool, through which   
 all our calls in and out come. Mrs    
 Marion Macinnes is the attendant and  
 the telephone is in her house. the    
 operator tells you how much the call  
 costs and the attendant keeps a record
 of the number and the amount. This    
 money is sent off monthly. The        
 equipment is powered by car batteries 
 which are now charged automatically by
 electricity but previously these had  
 to be charged by the diesel generators</content>
