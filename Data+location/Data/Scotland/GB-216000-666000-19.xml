		<title>19NATURE IN SKELMORLIE</title>
		<content>  With the wind mainly from the south  
 west Skelmorlie is quite exposed.We   
 get a fairly high rainfall and can    
 also have some memorable gales.Near-  
 ness to the sea keeps our winters     
 milder than other parts of Scotland   
 and on average snow lies for about 14 
 days per year.Summer weather tends to 
 be cool and wet or absolutely         
 glorious.                             
  Trees and plants need to be able to  
 withstand wind and salt spray.The     
 Sycamore is the most abundant tree and
 wild rhododendrons grow everywhere.   
  In the woods around the village there
 are roe deer and they often are seen  
 in gardens.There are foxes,rabbits,   
 weasels and hedgehogs.                
  As well as common sea and garden     
 birds we often have gannets diving for
 fish just off the shore.              
  This is a good place to live.        </content>
