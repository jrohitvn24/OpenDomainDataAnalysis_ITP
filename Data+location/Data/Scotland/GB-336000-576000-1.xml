		<content> The only substantial block of housing 
 in our area is the village of         
 Canonbie. It is situated in the       
 Scottish borders about 14 miles north 
 of Carlisle. The river Esk runs down  
 the east side of the village. On the  
 East bank of the Esk is a small       
 church, a school and a cluster of     
 modern bungalows. On the west side is 
 the main village, comprising of mixed 
 council, Buccleuch Estate , and       
 private hpusing, two hotels, and three
 shops.                                
 The rest of the land in our block is  
 farmland, mostly pasture, devoted to  
 stock rearing and dairying.           
 There are two small hamlets at        
 Claygate and Hollows. At Hollows there
 is a fine example of a restored Peel  
 tower which is currently being used as
 a dwelling house.
