 When our mini_bus drove up to the     
 bonded warehouses, we could not get   
 inside until the security men raised  
 the barrier to allow us to pass. Mr   
 Sherrit met us and came on to our     
 mini_bus to accompany us round the    
 whole site.  When he took us inside   
 one of the warehouses, he told us that
 there are two locks on each one and   
 that two different men hold the two   
 different keys.                       
 At night, alsatian guard dogs are     
 brought from kennels in Keith to guard
 the warehouses during the night.      
 In case of fire, there is a hugh      
 reservoir of water nearby.  If the    
 temperature inside a warehouse rises, 
 an alarm sounds, and sprinklers are   
 set in action to bring down the       
 temperature. Whisky from 90           
 distilleries is stored there.         </content>
