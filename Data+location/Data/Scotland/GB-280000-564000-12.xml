		<content> One of the clubs I go to are 'Cubs'.  
  I go there every Monday night dressed
 in my uniform which is a green jersey 
 and a blue and yellow scarf.  At      
 'Cubs' I am in the red six, the other 
 is the white six.  The red six and the
 white six mostly play games together. 
 Which ever six wins each game gets a  
 pea.  At the end of the month the peas
 are counted up.  The six with the most
 peas wins and gets to keep a leather  
 shield for the rest of the month.     
 Soon I will become a seconder who is  
 second in charge of his six.          
                                       
 I am also a member of the 'Watch Club'
 which is a club that studies nature,  
 old buildings and sometimes goes      
 camping.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
