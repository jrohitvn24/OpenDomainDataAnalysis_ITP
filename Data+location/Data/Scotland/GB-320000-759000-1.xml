		<title>01About Glenisla.</title>
		<content> Glenisla is a beautiful Scottish glen 
 in the Perthshire hills.It is thirty- 
 two miles north-west of the city of   
 Dundee.The countryside is mainly rough
 grassland and heather.The main job    
 provider is farming.There are two     
 hotels,a post office,a primary school 
 and a church.The houses are widely    
 scattered in this area and the        
 population is small.There is a main   
 B-class road running through the Glen.
 This is a through route to Glenshee   
 and many skiers flock there in winter 
 to the ski-slopes.There are two pony  
 trekking centres one of which provides
 the opportunity for taking part in    
 sailing, canoeing, grass skiing and   
 cycling. The River Isla runs through  
 the heart of the glen.
