		<title>07CURRIE GARDEN CENTRE</title>
		<content> There are two garden centres in our   
 area.One of them is owned by Mr.V.    
 Mr.V also owns a shop which sells     
 garden accessories. He grows all the  
 plants himself. To work at the garden 
 centre you have to study horticulture.
 Mr.V's job is to supervise the work   
 which is done. He attends to customers
 and answers the phone as well. Mr.V is
 very experienced, he has worked at his
 garden centre for thirty-two years    
 now. The garden centre suffers badly  
 from break-ins and vandals who steal  
 plants and smash the glasshouses. The 
 shop receives around 500 customers a  
 week, and is busiest at weekends.     
 The busiest time of the year is from  
 March to June. Mr.V employs sixteen   
 people. Three work in the shop,five in
 the garden centre and eight work in   
 the nursery.Of the sixteen workers,ten
 are part-time staff.                  </content>
