		<title>19Stewartry Agricultural Show</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Stewartry Show is held annually on
 the first Thursday in August in the   
 market fields on the outskirts of     
 Castle Douglas.                       
 There are classes for the various     
 breeds of animals: cattle, sheep,     
 horses, goats, dogs and poultry. Many 
 local farmers show their best animals.
 Judges, invited from all over Scotland
 award prizes to the winners.          
 Also on show are farm machinery, and  
 other items of interest to the farming
 community.                            
 This show usually attracts a crowd in 
 the region of 5,000, many of whom are 
 holiday makers, however the majority  
 are from the farming community who    
 regard the show also as a social      
 occasion.
