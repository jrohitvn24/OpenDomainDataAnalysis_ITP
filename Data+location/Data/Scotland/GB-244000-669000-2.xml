		<title>02HOUSING IN ERSKINE</title>
		<content> In recent years the number of people  
 living in Erskine has increased and so
 more houses have been built by the    
 Scottish Special Housing Association. 
 A few years ago tenants were given the
 opportunity to buy their houses from  
 the SSHA or continue to rent,therefore
 Erskine is a mixture of private and   
 rented houses,all with gardens.       
 There are lots of different types of  
 houses-flats,bungalows for old        
 people,large family houses,and some   
 houses for handicapped people with    
 specially fitted equipment.The flats  
 have door entry security systems      
 fitted.                               
 The houses are attractively laid out  
 with lots of green areas round about  
 them.Other areas in Erskine have been 
 developed by  private builders,adding 
 to the variety of houses which can be 
 found in the area.                    </content>
