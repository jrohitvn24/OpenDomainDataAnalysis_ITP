		<content> by as if in a race.   Another car     
 pulls out to join in the race, signals
 left and is gone out of sight for     
 another day.                          
      Sudden noises fill the air as the
 children escape out of school and     
 become a circus, screaming and        
 shouting, the circus acts begin.      
 Clowns fooling around, monkeys        
 chattering and swinging on the        
 railings and horses parading about.   
 At the other side of the playground   
 acrobats go through their paces and   
 performing dogs yap, pose and play for
 their audience.   Suddenly all        
 attention is drawn to the far edge of 
 the circus ring.   Monkeys on one     
 side, horses on another - a battle    
 begins.....                           
 ...the school bell rings and all is   
 quiet once more, except for the       
 droning whistle of the wind.........  </content>
