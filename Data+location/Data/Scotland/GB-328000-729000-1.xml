		<title>01LONGFORGAN AND ENVIRONS "I"</title>
		<content> Longforgan is situated 8 miles West of
 Dundee city centre on the South side  
 of the A85 Dundee-Perth dual          
 carriageway. The village is situated  
 with the River Tay to the South and   
 the hills of Fife are seen beyond the 
 river, while to the North are the     
 Braes of the Carse and beyond into    
 Angus and the Sidlaw Hills. The       
 village is now to a large extent a    
 dormitory village for people working  
 in Dundee and surrounding districts,  
 and for pupils attending secondary    
 school in Dundee. The village is      
 served by public transport although a 
 large percentage of commuters use     
 private transport. Perth is also      
 easily reached and provides a pleasant
 alternative for shoppers. Longforgan  
 was designated a Conservation Area in 
 1976.
