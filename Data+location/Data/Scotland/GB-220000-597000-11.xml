		<title>11Mining in the Girvan Valley</title>
		<content>    Coal mining has been practised in  
 the Girvan valley since the 17        
 Century.  The coal seams to be close  
 to the surface around New Dalliy which
 was built primarily to house the local
 miners, although there is also NCB    
 terraced housing in Girvan.           
    Both coal and fireclay were mined  
 in the main pits of Dalquharran,      
 Romilly and Maxwell.  The miners came 
 from as far as Ayr and their heyday   
 these pits employed over 450 mimers.  
    By the 1950's the coal seams were  
 becoming to difficult to work and they
 closed down  one after the other, with
 the last Dalquharran closing in 1977. 
    However the NCB has intimated that 
 open cast mining may be possible in   
 the forseeable future to extract the  
 coal left near the surface.
