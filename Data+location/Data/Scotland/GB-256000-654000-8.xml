		<title>08SOCIAL SURVEY:CARTVALE(ONE)</title>
		<content>  Four members of the Domesday team did
 a{social survey}using a{questionnaire 
 for the parents of Primary 7 pupils of
{Carolside}and{Busby}Schools.          
 The survey revealed that in{Busby east
 32% of the housing is rented from the 
 District Council while in{Busby west  
 it is only 8%.This % is falling as    
 tenants choose to buy their houses.   
  There are no Council houses in       
{Thorntonhall,Waterfoot}and in the part
 of{Clarkston}in the survey area.The   
 most common house type is privately   
 owned semi-detached although bungalows
 and terraced houses are also common.  
 There are very few flats or tenements.
  The house sizes were:(all rooms)     
 4-20%;5-25%;6-14%;7-16%;8-7%;9-14%;   
 10 or more 4%.These figures indicate  
 the area has many large houses many   
 of which must be under-occupied as our
 survey population were families.      </content>
