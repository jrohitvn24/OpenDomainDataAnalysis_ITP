		<title>01LANDSCAPE AND INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>     This section lies 22km north of   
 Dumfries and covers part of the       
 Thornhill basin of the River Nith.    
  The flat, flood plain takes up the   
 middle of the section and to the east 
 and west the land rises in gentle     
 slopes to a max. height of 200m.      
 Beyond the section the land rises     
 steeply affording magnificent views of
 the Lowthers in the east and the Keir 
 Hills in the west. The scenery is a   
 pleasant combination of well worked   
 farmland, moorland and mixed woodland.
   Dairying is the mainstay of the     
 farms but some crops are  also grown  
 both as fodders for the cattle and to 
 sell.                                 
   In addition to a dense farm         
 settlement the section includes the   
 villages of Thornhill (pop. 1520) and 
 Penpont (330). Thornhill is the local 
 service centre.                       </content>
