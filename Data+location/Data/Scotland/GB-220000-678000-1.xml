		<content> Our block is almost half  sea.        
 However, this does not mean it is     
 uninteresting as there is much        
 continuous activity.  Many types of   
 vessel pass the coast each day,       
 container ships, river steamers, and, 
 of course, nuclear and conventional   
 submarines from Faslane.              
{ Shore Road}runs close to the coast   
 with large villas on one side and the 
 beach on the other.  Behind this is   
{Argyll Road}and behind that farmland. 
 This area provides accommodation for  
 those who work at the M.O.D. bases of 
{Coulport}and{Faslane}and also those   
 who work in Glasgow and surrounding   
 towns.  The character of the district 
 has changed dramatically in the past  
 twenty years with a great deal of new 
 building taking place.
