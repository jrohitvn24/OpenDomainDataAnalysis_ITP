		<content> In Crawford we have quite a few sports
 facilities.There is indoor and outdoor
 bowling,badminton,tennis,fishing and  
 football.This year the tennis court   
 opens for the first time.The football 
 pitch has recently been completed as  
 well.We would very much like our own  
 swimming pool,but enjoy the use of    
 Lanark Baths(20 miles)away when we can
 get there.                            
 During Gala Day various sporting      
 events take place.There is a raft race
 on the Clyde,a mini marathon,a sports 
 night,and a football competition.     
 At school we play netball and football
 and sometimes take part in            
 competitions against other schools.   
 In the summer we have a school sports 
 afternoon.We also take part in the    
 Upperward Sports for schools.We have  
 won our section for the last three    
 years.                                </content>
