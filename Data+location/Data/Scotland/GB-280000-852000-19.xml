   The swans around our area are called
 mute swans.They have orange-yellow    
 beaks and hardly ever make a noise .  
 A {cygnet }stays with its mother for  
 around two years and then it goes off.
 Not many swans survive for they quite 
 often fly into the electricity wires. 
  {COOT                                
{  }The coots are very fearful animals 
 and they hate anything going near     
 their nests but they have a good way  
 of chasing them away.                 
   {HERON                              
{   }The Heron is a tall dark-grey bird
 which eats a lot of frogs, but it is a
 very patient bird for it waits for    
 its prey to come to it.
