		<title>01THE ROAD TO LESWALT</title>
		<content> Our block rises in undulating grassy  
 slopes from the sea shore of Loch     
 Ryan, westward to the village of      
 Lestwalt (pop 200) hence              
 south-westwards up through the        
 wooded Glen of Aldouran towards the   
 grounds of Lochnaw Castle, the home of
 the Agnews.  Again, from the shore,   
 south to southwest across a fine 18   
 hole golf course, over the rich       
 dairy, beef and sheep farmlands       
 reaching its furzy and marshy height  
 of 120m above Allandoo and            
 Glenstockadale.  Sparsely populated by
 14 farms and few occupied cottages    
 outside the village, the area is      
 served by one church (C.of S.), one   
 primary school (pop 41), one shop cum 
 P.O., a car sales and service station 
 and 5 buses daily to Stranraer (pop   
 10,000), 3km east, with its  rail and 
 ferry terminal, shopping and          </content>
