		<content>{Labourforce}consists of six men who   
 work all year round.  They work to a {
{basic routine}each day,cutting grass  
 in summer,lining the rugby and hockey 
 pitches and painting rugby posts in   
 winter.                               
 They are traditionally known as{      
{Cameronians}but the name has been     
 forgotten by most over the years.     
 They are not affected by school life  
 or rules and have nothing to do with  
 the religious side of the College.    
{Cleaning ladies}are employed in the   
 College, all from local towns like    
 Methven, Harrietfield and Perth.  They
 work for most of the year and clean up
 rooms after the end of the school     
 term.
