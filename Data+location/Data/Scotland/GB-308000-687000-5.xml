    During the Summer there is a Gala  
 Day set up by the Carnegie Trust.     
 Gala Day includes a big procession    
 with all the Primary School children  
 wlking down from the Public Park      
 through the High Street to            
 Pittencrieff Glen.  Then there is a   
 picnic and games in the Glen.         
    The name Carnegie brings many      
 tourists, especially Americans, to    
 Dunfermline to visit his home and the 
 Carnegie Museum.                      
    Dunfermline was once the Capital of
 Scotland, and there is an old palace  
 and monastery.  Scottish Kings were   
 buried here, the most famous being    
 King Robert the Bruce, whose name is  
 part of the stonework of the Abbey    
 Tower.                                </content>
