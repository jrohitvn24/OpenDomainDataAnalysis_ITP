		<content> In  June 1985 in our block there were 
{70 people living here permanently.}The
 majority of them are retired.Families 
 rarely  move into this area perhaps as
 there are few employment opportunities
 to attract any young families to move 
 here.                                 
   Several men are employed  by       {
{Highland Regional Council}on road     
 maintenance. Some others carry out    
 building repairs,fencing, or part-time
 work at the nearby fishing port of    
{Lochinver.}We have a district nurse   
 living and working in this area.      
   The majority of residents are       
 involved in{crofting.}However only a  
 handful of people make their living   
 from crofting. Despite Government     
 aid (subsidies, grants etc.,)  most   
 people are only part-time crofters    
 keeping a few sheep, cows, pigs and   
 hens.                                 </content>
