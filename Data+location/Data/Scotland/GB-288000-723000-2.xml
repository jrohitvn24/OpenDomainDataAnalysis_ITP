		<title>02DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content>   This area is situated approximately 
 2 miles north-east of Crieff.  The    
 highest point is Milquanzie Hill(1000 
 ft) and the lowest point is southern  
 most in the area where the main       
 population centre is situated.  It is 
 a hilly area with the main road (A85) 
 running towards Perth through the     
 south of the area.  Another road      
 leaves the main road in Gilmerton and 
 runs up the Sma' Glen through Monzie  
 to Dunkeld.                           
   Both deciduous and coniferous       
 forestry is present but the majority  
 of the land is used for farming.  Loch
 Meallbrodden is found in the          
 north-east corner of the area         
 surrounded by forestry and moorland.
