 What will it be today? We usually play
{'TIG'}or{'COPS AND ROBBERS'.}In the   
 game of tig, we have one tigger or    
 catcher and when they touch someone   
 they are taken off to the tigger's    
 den! They can be released by someone  
 who has not yet been caught. When we  
 play 'COPS AND ROBBERS' either we     
 bring our own toy guns or use bats and
 skittles.                             
   On wet and windy days we ask if we  
 can play inside in the G.P.room. This 
 room is 11m long by 5m wide so there  
 is plenty room for laying out floor   
 games. We sometimes lay out the road  
 track,using blocks to make housing    
 estates. We normally play in two or   
 three groups and play with games like 
{SNAKES &amp; LADDERS, LUDO and GET FIT.   
 There are often rows caused by some   
 one cheating,  spoiling the game!     </content>
