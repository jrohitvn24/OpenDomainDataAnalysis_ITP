		<content>   Most people enjoy a good sweet now  
 and again.In Carnoustie our survey    
 showed that{Mars Bars}were the most   
 popular sweets.No-one at all seemed to
 enjoy a{Wispa.}Number 2 in the sweets 
 charts were{Marathon Bars,}followed by
{Opal Fruits.                          
   All the shops which were interviewed
 said that a great deal of money is    
 made by selling sweets.               
   Despite all this confectionary which
 is sold and eaten in Carnoustie,only  
 one child in a week goes to the       
{dietician}(someone who helps you to   
 understand the food you eat),at the   
 local health-centre.However the number
 of babies who attend is much greater. 
   It is recommended that children     
 should not eat sweets between meals.  
 However,if they must have something   
 the dietician recommends{crisps}rather
 than sweets.                          </content>
