		<content>{Tourism}is an important source of     
 revenue to the people of {Biggar}as   
 many people are attracted to the town 
 by its Museums and sites.The other    
 main attraction is that the layout of 
 Biggar has changed little since the   
 last century. Then of course there is 
 the nice scenery. Of these attractions
 the Historical ones probably rate the 
 highest. The {Biggar Museum Trust }has
 several places open to the public ,   
 the Gladstone Court Folk Museum and a 
 reconstructed seventeenth century     
 house,which has links with the        
 Covenanting times. There are          
 other sights like the {Biggar Gas     
{Works,}the Cadger's Brig connected    
 with William Wallace and the old      
 medieval {Church} of St Marys. Also   
 some visitors are attracted by the    
 charm of the old worldly hotels such  
 as the eighteenth century Elpinstone. </content>
