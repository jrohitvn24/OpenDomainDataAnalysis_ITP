		<title>10DORNIE SHORELINE</title>
		<content> The seashore is just outside our      
 classroom window. One day we went to  
 the shore to see what we could find.  
 Under the stones we found crabs which 
 looked like green moving stones.These 
 were shore crabs.We found sandhoppers 
 which are yellow,have lots of legs and
 jump out of your hand.The sea slaters 
 we found are round,flat and hard.They 
 are very fast and tickle you when you 
 hold them.There were a lot of dog     
 whelks and stones with barnacles on   
 them.The whelks eat the barnacles.    
 Under the brown seaweed was a         
 centipede and a white sea worm.Suzanne
 found a spiny sea urchin and Paul a   
 starfish.Sometimes we look out of our 
 window and see a heron.We have also   
 seen an otter,a seal,a swan and ducks.
