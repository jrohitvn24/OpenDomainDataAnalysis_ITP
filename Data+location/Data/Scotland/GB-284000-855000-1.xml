		<title>01NAIRN:THE AREA</title>
		<content> This area lies to the West of the town
 and consists of a variety of housing  
 areas from substantial 19th century   
 sandstone villas to modern            
 terraced,semi-detached and detached   
 bungalows.                            
   Outside the town is fairly fertile  
 farmland given over mainly to cereals 
 which have been very much on the      
 increase in the past few years.       
   The farms are traditional buildings 
 of slate and stone with typical       
 additions of silos with steel and     
 concrete sheds.                       
   There are considerable areas of     
 woodland usually on the poorer soils  
 and often sheltering very large formal
 houses.In some areas modern housing   
 is invading the edge of the woodland. 
   The main Aberdeen to Inverness trunk
 road bisects the area and is becoming 
 increasingly busy.                    </content>
