		<title>10Boats for fun in Uyeasound.</title>
		<content>   In Uyeasound a lot of people own    
 boats.People who have motor boats have
 them moored at the pier at the        
 Westside.People use these boats to go 
 out fishing,mostly beyond Muness.Some 
 lay creels to catch lobsters and      
 crabs.I sometimes have great fun      
 fishing with my cousin from his       
 father's speedboat.Speedboats are     
 sometimes used at the sailing events  
 as rescue crafts.                     
   Some people have sailing boats;maids
 or dingies.The shape of the maid is   
 far different to a dingie.Maids are   
 longer,thinner and have longer masts; 
 they are Shetland model boats.Dingies 
 take two people and maids take three. 
 In 1985 there are 4 weeks of Sunday   
 races in Uyeasound in the Sound of    
 Uyea.The maids sail for the Uyea Cup  
 and the dingies for the Chevron Cup.  
 The 1985 Regatta is on 29th June.     </content>
