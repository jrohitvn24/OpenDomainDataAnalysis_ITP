		<title>06CATTLE MARKETS IN PERTH</title>
		<content>{  Hay's}market is 152 years old and   
 covers about seven acres. There are   
 twenty full_time employees although up
 to twelve casual workers are taken on 
 for sales.                            
  Stock from all over Scotland is sold 
 to farmers from the south of England. 
 Although they do not have bull sales, 
 Hay's do auction other animals such as
 sheep in common with MacDonald and    
 Fraser's and they also sell horses.   
  The two markets function in basically
 the same way and although there is an 
 overlap of spheres of influence there 
 is a large enough demand for both to  
 survive.                              
  In the areas immediately around both 
 markets{agricultural suppliers and    
{services}such as farm machinery       
 distributors, veterinary services,and 
 financial advisors predominate.
