   I travelled with three of my        
 classmates with our teacher in his car
 to visit our 'patch'. We were simply  
 driving around the area to see what   
 kind of countryside we were going to  
 investigate. Our teacher, Mr. Wright, 
 stopped his car on the crest of a hill
 and we surveyed the land. We were     
 surrounded by farmland: barley fields,
 grazing land for cows and sheep, and  
 some forested areas. As far as the eye
 could see there were trees, fields,   
 green valleys and not a house in      
 sight. It looked a lonely, quiet area 
 and very different from the built up  
 housing area where I live. I think,   
 certainly at the moment I'd prefer to 
 live in our area where there's more   
 life and more to do. At first glance I
 didn't think there was much to see but
 I could see from the map I was wrong. </content>
