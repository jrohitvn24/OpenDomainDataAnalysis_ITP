 There are{four houses belonging to    
{Angus District Council.               
 Some four or five houses are rented   
 from a local owner, by{naval personell
{from the R.A.F.Edzell U.S. Base.      
 All the other houses in the village   
 are{owner-occupied.                   
 In summer, the gardens of the village 
 are noted for their beauty and colour,
 and people come from far and wide to  
 photograph them.                      
 Many of the{cottages on the           
{surrounding farms are now rented by   
{people who have no connection with    
{agriculture.                          
 The former{Station House}has been     
 converted into a beautiful home since 
{the railway line which linked the     
{parish with Brechin, Forfar, Glasgow  
{and London is now gone}and the{nearest
{railway station is at Montrose.       </content>
