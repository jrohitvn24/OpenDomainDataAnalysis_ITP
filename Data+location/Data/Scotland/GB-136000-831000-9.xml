		<title>09TYPICAL FAMILY SATURDAY</title>
		<content> We all get up at the usual            
 time-8 o'clock.We have breakfast      
 together.Afterwards,daddy goes out to 
 work in the garden-weeding or         
 digging.Perhaps he will work on his   
 climbing equipment,because he is a    
 mountain guide in the Cullins,near to 
 our house.Mummy usually does the      
 housework,while I play with my little 
 brother at football.Sometimes we go   
 fishing in the river nearby,but we do 
 not catch fish very often!            
 Lunch is normally soup and            
 sandwiches,and after it daddy and I   
 sit down with a cup of tea to watch   
 the football on television.I hope     
 Aberdeen win because they are my      
 favourite team.                       
 After tea,I play with my brother and  
 daddy and mummy write letters or      
 read.Before bed,we watch television   
 together for a while.                 </content>
