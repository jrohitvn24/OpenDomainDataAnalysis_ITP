		<title>18A COUNRY CHILD'S DAY.</title>
		<content> I get up at 7a.m. dress myself and    
 follow my dad outside. Itack my pony, 
 Heather and give her a trot and       
 sometimes a canter.  I get on my bike 
 and put out the sheep.  My mother     
 calls me in.  I have Kellog'S Country 
 Store for breakfast.                  
 At 8.30a.m. I catch the school bus.   
 When I reach school I have a talk     
 with my friends. When the bell rings  
 we go in and say a prayer. Sometimes  
 we do Maths. At 10.40a.m. we go out to
 play. When we come in we follow our   
 programme.                            
 At 12.30p.m. we have a school         
 lunch.School ends at 3p.m. and I go   
 home in the bus.  At 4.35 I bring in  
 the sheep with Glen. Then I go up the 
 hill to feed my sheep. Sometimes a ewe
 has lambed. It is great fun watching  
 the lambs take their first steps.     
 At 9p.m. I go to bed.                 </content>
