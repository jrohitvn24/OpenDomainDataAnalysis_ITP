		<content>    My name is Jimmy and I am nine     
 years old.  I live with my family -   
 Mum, Dad and sister Trudy who is      
 fifteen.                              
    At school I am in class P.5 and I  
 am not very fast at doing my maths. I 
 am also a little bit slow at doing    
 some of my other work.                
    My hobby is playing the bagpipes,  
 and sometimes I am good at playing    
 them.  Recently I was playing at a    
 competition and came in second.       
    I like to play on my bike, and make
 big jumps so that I can go over them  
 on my{BMX bike.} Sometimes I hurt     
 myself when I am doing this, but it is
 good fun just the same.               
    My sister's hobby is horse riding.
