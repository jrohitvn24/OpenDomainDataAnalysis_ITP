		<title>14RECREATION IN CHIRNSIDE</title>
		<content> In Chirnside there are many parks,    
 play areas and clubs. Berwickshire    
 District Council looks after the parks
 and play areas. When new play         
 equipment is needed the Common Good   
 Association has fun runs and other    
 activities to raise money for the     
 equipment. The Common Good organises  
 the old folks' trips. These trips have
 been going on for over 12 years. For  
 the ladies in Chirnside there are the 
 Wednesday Club, the Woman's Guild and 
 the Women's Rural Institute. The      
 WRI was founded in 1919 and is the    
 oldest WRI in Berwickshire. The Guild 
 and the WRI meet once a month, and the
 Wednesday Club once a fortnight.      
 The Keep Fit Club and the Royal       
 Scottish Country Dance Society meet   
 every week in the school, and there   
 are Sequence Dancing classes in the   
 local hotel.                          </content>
