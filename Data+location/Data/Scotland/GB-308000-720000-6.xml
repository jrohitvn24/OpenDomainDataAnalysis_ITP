		<title>06Craigie Clips- Part 2</title>
		<content>  The{Craigie}area has lost its vast   
 selection of shops due to more people 
 buying from supermarkets and using    
 cars to go into the town. The{main    
 area of{shops}is beside the railway   
 bridge at the{"Lollipop Clock".}The   
 main source of employment  is  not    
 now the railway. As this suburb has   
 grown in size the residents'{jobs}have
 become more diverse.Most work in{Perth
 but some{commute}to{Dundee,Glasgow}and
{Edinburgh}as the{road}and{rail}links  
 are good.                             
  There are good facilities for old    
 folk who cannot easily get to town as 
 there are two hairdressers, grocers,  
 post office, two butchers, a Launder- 
 ette and a newsagent. Local{businesses
 include a plumber, house decorator and
 joiner.                               
  The two{churches}run clubs catering  
 for the interests of young and old.   </content>
