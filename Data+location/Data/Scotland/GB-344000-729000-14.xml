		<title>14TRANSPORT IN BROUGHTY FERRY</title>
		<content> Public transport is provided by bus   
 and rail. Bus services extend from the
 centre of Dundee with inter-city bus  
 routes passing close to the busy      
 shopping area. In view of the large   
 population travelling to the city, bus
 times are frequent and, in the main,  
 satisfactory. The railway station is  
 situated close to the shopping centre 
 and provides links to the local and   
 inter-city routes.                    
{PRIVATE TRANSPORT}Cars and motor-bikes
 are used by commuters. Car-sharing is 
 a popular economy measure. Roads are  
 in good repair and traffic normally   
 flows freely.                         
{COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT}Light commercial 
 vehicles carry goods to and from the  
 shopping centres and small businesses.
 Larger lorries have difficulty        
 negotiating the narrow streets here.
