 The Mansion house is set in the wooded
{LANDSCAPE}of Crow Wood. The house and 
 estate which date back to the late    
 16th century and were used as         
 hospitals for the British and Polish {
{ARMED FORCES}during the II World War, 
 have been{RESTORED}to their former    
 glory after lying derelict for several
 years. Unfortunately one wing of the  
 house had to be removed due to dry    
 rot.                                  
 As well as the house there a set of   
 cottages along side an old stable,    
 coach-house and coachman's house. The 
 coachman's house is still lived in but
 the stable and coach-house are now    
 used as storage areas. The row of     
 cottages which were formerly used as {
{HOUSING}for the estate's workers are  
 also leased.
