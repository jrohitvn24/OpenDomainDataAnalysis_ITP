		<content>   Until 1969{Belmont High School}had a
 primary department. Then a new        
 building was opened to house the      
 primary children. This was built on   
 the site of a former market garden and
 was called{Castlehill Primary School.}
 The secondary school was extended to  
 include 5th. and 6th. year pupils and 
 was then called{Belmont Academy.}     
   In 1969 the roll at Castlehill was {
{579}but by 1985 it was down to{226}due
 to the fall in the birth rate and the 
 opening of nearby{Kincaidston Primary 
{School.}In Castlehill there are now 9 
 teachers, a Head Teacher, 1 part-time 
 secretary, 1 auxiliary and 1 janitor. 
 At the moment four empty classrooms   
 are being used by{St.John's R.C.School
 whose own school was destroyed by     
 fire. However their new school should 
 be ready by autumn 1985.
