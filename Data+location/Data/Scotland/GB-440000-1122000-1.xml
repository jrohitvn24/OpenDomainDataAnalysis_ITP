		<title>01GENERAL VIEW OF SANDWICK</title>
		<content>   Sandwick is a fairly compact rural  
 area 15 miles south of Lerwick and 12 
 miles north of Sumburgh.              
   It is not as dependent on farming   
 and crofting as other rural areas,    
 although it does have some, but tends 
 to be more of a village from where    
 many people commute to work in        
 surrounding areas, mainly Lerwick,    
 Sumburgh airport and the oil base at  
 Sullom Voe.                           
   The houses are quite near together  
 and are found in groups. Most are     
 built single storey because of the    
 wind in Shetland.                     
   The school accomodates local primary
 schoolchildren   plus the children    
 aged 12 to 16 years from Cunningsburgh
 to the north and all of the area to   
 the south.
