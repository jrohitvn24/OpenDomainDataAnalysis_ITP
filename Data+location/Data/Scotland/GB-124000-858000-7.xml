		<content> We have a district nurse based within 
 our community. Our doctor serves      
 several villages as well as us. He is 
 based in Dunvegan, which is about     
 twelve miles away. A surgery is held  
 in the village every Wednesday        
 afternoon. Should we need to consult  
 our doctor at any other time we need  
 to go to Dunvegan. Patients needing   
 hospital treatment must go to Portree 
 or Broadford, on the Isle of Skye or  
 Inverness on the mainland.            
 Occasionally some patients are sent   
 south to Glasgow.
