		<content> 1985 is the sixtieth anniversary of   
 the formation of{Royal Observer Corps 
 in Britain. The role of the original  
 members was spotting and identifying  
 aircraft. In the late fifties this was
 changed to include{detection and      
{monitoring of nuclear fallout.}At this
 time the United Kingdom warning and   
 monitoring organisation was extended  
 to include Orkney and Shetland.       
{Underground posts}were sited in       
 Deerness Kirkwall and Stromness.      
{Primary use}of Royal Observer Corps is
 public warning of air attack and      
 approach of nuclear fallout and help  
 should nuclear warfare ever occur.    
 Corps in Orkney consist of 33 highly  
 trained observers who give freely of  
 their{spare time}and whose main aim is
 to serve their country should the need
 ever arise.
