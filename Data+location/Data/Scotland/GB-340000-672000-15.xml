		<content>{GEORGE McNeill-world record holder of 
{110 metre sprint is a former pupil of 
{St Martins RCPS TRANENT.}When he left 
 school he had no real interest in     
 running but  turned instead to        
 football.He played for Hibs, an       
 Edinburgh team and it was these  few  
 years as a professional footballer    
 that cost him his amateur status and  
 the chance to run for his country in  
 the olympics.His speed on the field   
 was soon noticed.His first race was   
 the Powderhall sprint held every year 
 on the first of January in Edinburgh. 
 A newcomer to the scene he started    
 with a handicap but by the time the   
 final came he raced from scratch. He  
 once raced 100m against a race horse  
 and won.He races in Austrailia as well
 as in Britain.Success has not changed 
 George,he said on T.V. recently 'once 
 a TRANENT man always a TRANENT man!'  </content>
