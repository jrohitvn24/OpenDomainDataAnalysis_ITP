		<title>03FARMING IN DALBEATTIE AREA</title>
		<content> Altogether in our area of Dalbeattie  
 there are nine farms.Most farms rear  
 sheep and cattle for meat,but some are
 dairy farms.                          
  The dairy farms send their milk to   
 Dalbeattie Creamery where it is made  
 into cheese.This cheese is sold all   
 over the world.                       
  Every farm covers on average 350     
 acres of land.The most common crops   
 are barley,grass for silage and green 
 crop.These crops are grown mostly for 
 the farmer's own use.                 
  Some farms fatten up their animals   
 before taking them to market in Castle
 Douglas to be sold for butcher meat.  
  Mr Hyslop of West Logan Farm won a   
 major award at the Royal Highland Show
 this year with his prize Charollais   
 sheep.
