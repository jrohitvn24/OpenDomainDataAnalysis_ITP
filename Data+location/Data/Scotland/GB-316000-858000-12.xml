		<title>12MOSSTOWIE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school is now reduced to two full 
 time teachers but has five visiting   
 teachers of various subjects.There are
 thirty nine pupils,twenty six boys and
 thirteen girls which causes problems  
 in sports and other school events.    
 Being such a small school financial   
 pressure means we  are  unable to     
 obtain expensive equipment but because
 the school is so well looked after we 
 get money from the clerk of works to  
 improve the school facilities. 80% of 
 the pupils have always been at        
 Mosstowie School. The majority of the 
 pupils like it here because their     
 fellow friends and teachers are       
 friendly.P.E.,H.E.and maths are the   
 most popular subjects and the pupils  
 also like swimming.Pupils commented   
 that there is a need for better toilet
 facilaties and more gym equipment.
