		<title>08The Vet comes to Tongue</title>
		<content> 'One day our little pet lamb fell     
 ill.I went into the shed to feed him  
 and I gasped. He was lying down. We   
 had to call the {veterinary surgeon.} 
 He came to our house and went to see  
 the pet lamb. We kept our fingers     
 crossed. The vet said the lamb had a  
 fifty-fifty chance. He went back to   
 the lamb and gave him an {injection   
 and then went away. We gave the lamb a
 bedding of blankets and he was still  
 asleep.                               
 The next morning we all went out and  
 were relieved to see him up on his    
 feet and bleating merrily.'
