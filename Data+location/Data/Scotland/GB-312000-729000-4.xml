		<title>04Customs-GUILDRY VISITS</title>
		<content> 1The Guildry Incorporation of Perth   
 used to own Guildtown. They helped to 
 pay for the building of the School in 
 1875 and they built most of the old   
 houses you can see about 1820. That is
 why the present members visit the area
 and the school every year. At the     
 school there are races after the      
 refreshments. The winners each get a  
 gift voucher. After that we have a    
 scramble usually for brand new twos or
 one pences but sometimes they include 
 fives and tens. Next one of the older 
 boys or girls makes a speech thanking 
 the Guildry for coming. This visit    
 always takes place on the first       
 Wednesday in June. That that is Derby 
 Day is no co-incident.                
 The Guildry's other visit is to the   
 School Prize-giving Service on the    
 last morning of term usually at the   
 end of June,to give out Guildry Prizes</content>
