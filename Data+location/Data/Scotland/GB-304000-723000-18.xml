		<content> South of the village of Almondbank    
 which is situated to the north and    
 outwith our area, lies the only       
 substantial built-up area in our      
 survey location. This area can be     
 split up into two distinct parts.     
 Firstly, lying just north of the A85  
 and south of Almondbank village, is   
 the Royal Navy Workshops. This is a   
 fairly large complex of factory       
 workshops which in the past serviced  
 aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm.        
 To the north west of this instillation
 lies the derelict remains of an       
 industrial complex once busily        
 producing textiles for an ever eagar  
 market. Now, only the shell of this   
 once large, work intensive industry   
 remains. The buildings stand as a     
 memorial to the time when this was an 
 important centre in the dying, weaving
 and manufacture of linen.             </content>
