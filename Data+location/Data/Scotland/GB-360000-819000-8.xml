		<content> The small village of Keig consists of 
 8 traditional granite built           
 houses,four blocks of semi-detached   
 cottages built by the County Council  
 (some of which have now been bought by
 their former tenants) and a number of 
 modern detached houses constructed    
 within the past decade on land bought 
 from Forbes Estate.                   
 The mechanisation of farming has      
 resulted in considerable depopulation 
 of the area but the                   
 arrival of the "commuter", attracted  
 by the pleasant countryside, the      
 beautiful views and the availability  
 of cottages once occupied by farm     
 workers, has led to the modernisation 
 of many of these cottages and to the  
 building of new houses.
