		<title>15History of Cathcart</title>
		<content> The district of Cathcart is quite     
 famous in it's history and has one or 
 two noteable landmarks.  For example, 
 there is a stone in Court Knowe from  
 where Mary Queen of Scots is said to  
 have watched the battle of Langside.  
 On this stone is a monogram of her    
 name.  There is a place in Old Castle 
 Road known as the Old Smiddy which was
 originally a blacksmiths and the      
 famous poet Robert Burns often went   
 there to get his horses hooves seen to
 when he was on a very long journey.   
 The Old Smiddy is still there but now 
 people go there to get food because it
 is a restaurant.  Over from Court     
 Knowe there is an entrance to Linn    
 Park and here there is a tree stump   
 which is over 200 years old.  In Court
 Knowe there are huge quarries which   
 were dug for coal.                    
                                       </content>
