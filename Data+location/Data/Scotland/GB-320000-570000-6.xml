		<title>06Sheep milking/Creca</title>
		<content> Sheep have been milked since the dawn 
 of civilisation and the milk used to  
 produce a variety of cheeses.         
 Traditional British pressed cheeses   
 were all originally made with ewes    
 milk, and gradually became cow milk   
 cheeses as farming methods changed,   
 and fewer people worked on the land.  
 At Windyknowe farm one hundred ewes   
 are milked twice daily through a      
 specially modified milking parlour for
 nine to ten months of the year.       
 Freisland sheep bred for long         
 lactation are used, producing between 
 four and six hundred litres per ewe   
 per lactation. All the milk produced  
 is turned into a hard white cheese    
 called Barac. Freisland sheep can     
 produce two or more lambs, a heavy    
 quality fleece and a lean carcass as  
 an added bonus over conventional sheep
 -keeping.                             </content>
