		<title>03Fishing boat_The Carvida</title>
		<content> The Carvida travels out 200 miles     
 N.E.of Fraserburgh to their fishing   
 grounds. They have to stay within 3   
 miles of the harbour because that is  
 their territorial waters.They stay out
 for up to 10 days before they come in 
 and land their fish.The Carvida has   
 radars,echo sounders, VHFs,2 Deccas   
 and charts to help them.It can go on  
 automatic pilot but if it is bad      
 weather they just use the wheel to    
 steer.All boats do not travel to the  
 same area but the bigger ones do.     
 The Carvida is 80 feet long and it is 
 a wooden boat,6 years old.It has 9    
 beds,a shower and a toilet.           
 It is a red and gold boat and it has a
 black stone engine.                   
 The skipper has had 3 boats,2         
 called"Golden Promise"and the         
 "Carvida".He started fishing when he  
 was fifteen.                          </content>
