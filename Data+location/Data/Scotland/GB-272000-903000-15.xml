		<title>15Rogart - Farming</title>
		<content>  Davoch Farm, farmed and owned by the 
 Murray family is situated in the      
 Rogart Valley. It is 85 acres of      
 arable land. On the hillside, it also 
 has 500 acres of poor land.           
  The land supports 30-50 head of      
 cattle and 200 sheep. To feed the     
 animals in winter, hay and turnips are
 grown. Any other food needed, is      
 bought in.                            
  The family have all the necessary    
 implements. Ten years ago, a new      
 steading was built and soon there will
 be a new hay shed. The Fleet forms  a 
 boundary of Davoch Farm. Over the     
 years a bank of ground has been built 
 up, so Davoch does not suffer from    
 flooding when the river is in spate.  
  In the near future, Mr  Murray       
 proposes to sell his cattle and turn  
 the farm into a sheep-rearing         
 business.                             </content>
