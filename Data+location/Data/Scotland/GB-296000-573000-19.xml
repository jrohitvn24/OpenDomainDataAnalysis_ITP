		<title>19Arts Festival Music Concert</title>
		<content> As part of the annual Dumfries        
 festival, I attended a cushion concert
 by the Trio Zingara. There was a      
 pianist, a violinist and a cellist,   
 providing classical music of an       
 excellent standard. However I was the 
 only pupil from Primary 7 who attended
 the Trio Zingara's concert. This is   
 because nowadays classical music is   
 not popular, and is considered out of 
 date. At the end, the audience were   
 invited to ask questions about the    
 trio as they pleased. The concert took
 place at the Academy Hall in Dumfries,
 which is not far from my school.      
 Altogether I found it a most enjoyable
 afternoon.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
