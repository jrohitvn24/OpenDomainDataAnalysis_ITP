		<title>07TRANSPORT IN CUMBERNAULD</title>
		<content> Cumbernauld's transport today will be 
 the same in years to come because it  
 is unique. It was built with the motor
 car and the{pedestrian}in mind.       
 Firstly it was built to make sure that
 no pedestrians should be anywhere near
 the roads. They have their own paths, 
 bridges and underpasses.The road      
 system was built separately with      
 roundabouts and junctions so that     
 there is no need for any traffic      
 lights, which cuts down the number of 
 accidents.There are lots of bus stops 
 near the houses so that nobody has to 
 walk far to catch a bus. There is also
 a multiple track railway line with a  
 station in the south of Cumbernauld.  
 The bus passes through the station to 
 pick people up and drop them off.There
 is also an airfield at Wardpark which 
 is mostly used by gliders.
