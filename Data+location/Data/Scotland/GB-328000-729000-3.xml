		<title>03LONGFORGAN - CARMICHAEL FARM</title>
		<content> The farm extends to an area of 340    
 acres, comprised of 21 fields with an 
 average acreage of 16 acres. Field    
 boundaries  are mostly tree-lined with
 Elm, Oak, Ash and Chestnut. Most of   
 the Elms are presently being felled   
 due to Dutch Elm Disease. The soil    
 type is clay loam some of which is    
 over a base of gravel. The soil depth 
 is good and the farm is very fertile  
 and is basically an arable fruit farm 
 growing wheat,winter barley,oil seed  
 rape,linseed,potatoes,swedes,vining   
 peas and spring barley as arable crops
 and raspberries as a fruit crop. The  
 farm is on a South facing slope on the
 Braes of the Carse rising from 250 ft.
 to 700 ft immediately to the South of 
 Dron and North of Longforgan. The old 
 steading built circa 1889 has mostly  
 gone in favour of a modern concrete   
 and asbestos shed,150'x80'&amp;18" eaves. </content>
