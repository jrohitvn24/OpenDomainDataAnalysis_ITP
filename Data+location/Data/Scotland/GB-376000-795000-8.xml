		<title>08Woodlands school Durris</title>
		<content> Our school is in the Parish of        
 Durris.It is quite a small school,and 
 takes children from age 5 to 12.At the
 moment there are 37 pupils and two    
 teachers.The school was built in      
 1876,and a new part added on in       
 1979,because of lack of space.We have 
 a tarmac playground and no grass.The  
 older pupils are taught in the newer  
 part of the school and the younger    
 ones in the original part.We get      
 specialist teachers to help us.On     
 Monday we get music,on Tuesday the P.6
 and 7 pupils get swimming,and there is
 an open session in the evening.On     
 Wednesday the minister comes and we   
 get gym. On Thursday afternoon we have
 art and on Friday,home economics in   
 the morning and football and netball  
 in the afternoon. We have two pet     
 fish,some stick insects and a rabbit.
