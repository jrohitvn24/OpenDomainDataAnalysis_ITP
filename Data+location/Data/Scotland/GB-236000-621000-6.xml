		<title>06GETTING ON OUR HOBBY HORSES</title>
		<content>  Of all the days in the week Friday is
 my favourite,for this is the day when 
 Primary 7 classes  have their {Hobbies
{Time at Dalmilling Primary School.}All
 the pupils may choose to take part in 
 gardening,woodwork,macrame,painting or
 working with computers.So far this    
 year I have taken part in working with
 computers,macrame and painting.I liked
 computer work most of all _ especially
 the space invader games!              
  Some of our boys,who like gardening  
 have "taken over" the garden of one   
 of the pensioners who lives close to  
 our school. After digging and getting 
 the ground ready,they have planted    
 vegetables and flowers.This type of   
{community work}has given the boys a   
 great feeling of achievement.At the   
 end of term we are having a barbecue  
 in our "adopted garden"_thanks to the 
 kindness of a friendly pensioner.     </content>
