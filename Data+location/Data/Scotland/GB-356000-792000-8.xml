		<title>08A FINZEAN TEACHER'S DAY</title>
		<content> I have twelve children in a composite 
 class of Primary 1-4 which means age  
 range 5-8 years.The emphasis is on    
 meeting the needs of the individual.  
 During a normal day I expect to hear  
 each child{reading}from a set book at 
 his/her own level.                    
 The children will do{Maths.}which may 
 be of a practical nature.Environmental
 studies can be on a variety of topics 
 e.g.Myself,Food-usually around harvest
 time-or based on a TV programme.      
 This session the{computer}has taken   
 its place in the classroom and we have
 all enjoyed{Granny's Garden.This}     
 program has encouraged creative       
 writing as the children imagine what  
 might happen next at each stage in the
 exploration.Art work and co_ordinates 
 work in Maths.have emerged from it.   
 All have made Granny's Garden books.  
 .                                     </content>
