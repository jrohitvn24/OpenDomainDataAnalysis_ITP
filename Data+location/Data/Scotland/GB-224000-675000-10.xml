		<content> IN CENTRAL AND WESTERN GREENOCK THERE 
 ARE QUITE A LOT OF SPORTS FACILITIES  
 SUCH AS PLAYING FIELDS, SWIMMING POOL,
 TENNIS CLUBS, BOWLING CLUBS, CRICKET  
 AND RUGBY CLUBS AND A SPORTS CENTRE.  
 THERE IS ALSO AN ATHLETIC CLUB CALLED 
 GLENPARK HARRIERS.                    
 TO JOIN ANY OF THESE CLUBS YOU USUALLY
 HAVE TO PAY A MEMBERSHIP FEE EACH     
 YEAR, BUT FOR THE SWIMMING POOL AND   
 SPORTS CENTRE YOU ONLY PAY FOR A      
 SESSION. MOST OF THESE FACILITIES ARE 
 FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES, AND SOMETIMES 
 YOU CAN GET A FAMILY MEMBERSHIP IN    
 WHICH THE WHOLE FAMILY ARE MEMBERS.   
 THERE ARE ALSO PLANS TO BUILD AN ICE  
 RINK AS PART OF A REDEVELOPMENT PLAN  
 FOR AN AREA OF DERELICT DOCKLAND NEAR 
 GREENOCK TOWN CENTRE, THOUGH THIS MAY 
 NOT GO AHEAD DUE TO SHORTAGE OF MONEY.
