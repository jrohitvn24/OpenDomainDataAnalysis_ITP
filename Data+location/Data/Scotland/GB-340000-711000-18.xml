		<title>18Wildlife in Ceres District</title>
		<content>  Rabbits are the most common  mammals.
 Hares  are  most  often seen when  the
 fields are bare.  Foxes are often seen
 in car headlights  at  night  but,  so
 far, prefer not to visit the villages.
 Their numbers are  kept  partly  under
 control  by  Fife  Foxhounds  who hunt
 over the area.                        
  Groups  of  roe  deer  are  seen near
 woodland where there is enough cover. 
  As well as the more common birds like
 sparrows, blackbirds, starlings, rooks
 and thrushes, the area is visited more
 often nowadays by  herons  because  of
 the fish available in Ceres Burn and a
 pair  of  sedge  warblers  have   been
 nesting in an area of rough  ground in
 the area.  There  are  many  types  of
 finches.  Swallows, martins and swifts
 are regular visitors.                 
  Kestrels  are  seen  fairly often but
 the number of barn owls has decreased.</content>
