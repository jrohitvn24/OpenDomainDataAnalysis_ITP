		<content> With the closing of the local coal    
 mines, only two small companies have  
 come into the area to reduce the huge 
 numbers of young unemployed.          
                                       
 1. Carden Casting Co.                 
 This company was set up in 1967 as    
 part of the expansion program of a    
 Slough company. Cardenden was chosen, 
 firstly because the founder of the    
 company was a Scotsman and secondly   
 there was a good supply of unemployed 
 manual labourers in the area. The     
 company makes aluminium alloy         
 castings(sand castings and gravity dye
 castings). Their products are sold to 
 engineering and electronic related    
 industrys. Of the workforce of about  
 20 half come from Cardenden and the   
 rest from Kirkcaldy. At present the   
 company is struggling to stay in      
 business.                             </content>
