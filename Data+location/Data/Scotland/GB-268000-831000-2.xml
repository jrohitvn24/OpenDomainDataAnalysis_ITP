		<title>02FARMING</title>
		<content>  I live on a farm. The crops we grow  
 on the farm are corn, barley, silage, 
 hay, potatoes and turnips.            
  When the barley is cut it is taken to
 the farm by trailer. It is put into a 
 bruiser which flattens the barley.    
  We keep cattle and sheep. We feed the
 cattle the bruised barley or bruisen  
 with their silage and it makes them   
 fat so they make a good price at the  
 slaughter house.We feed the sheep hay,
 turnips and sometimes bruisen.        
  If you had a farm which was mostly   
 hill land your best choice of         
 sheep would be blackface.They can be  
 left on a hill for nearly a week      
 without getting stuck on their backs. 
  Some of the fields in the valley are 
 sown out in grass so there is enough  
 for the cattle to eat fresh in the    
 summer and as silage or hay in the    
 winter.                               </content>
