		<content> Out of a survey of 33 local people of 
 all ages only ten felt that there were
 adequate recreational facilities in   
 the area. Most of these were aged 12  
 years and under. Few people, however, 
 are willing to travel outwith the     
 local community to find additional    
 facilities. Local amenities include a 
 golf course, youth clubs, bowling     
 greens, a swimming pool, snooker club,
 community youth discos, and "Speakers"
 club with games room. Most of those   
 over 30 had home based interests such 
 as reading, knitting, and t.v.viewing.
 The most popular community amenity was
 the swimming pool which had the       
 highest usage rating in the survey. On
 average those interviewed watched 3.5 
 hours of television per day.Other     
 interests noted included gardening,   
 walking, ice skating,birdwatching,    
 dancing and canoeing.                 </content>
