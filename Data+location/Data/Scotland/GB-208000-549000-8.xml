		<title>08TOURISM NEAR SANDHEAD</title>
		<content> by Elizabeth Sime aged 10             
      Sandhead is very popular with    
 tourists. There are two very nice     
 campsites about one kilometre from    
 Sandhead. I am the daughter of Mr.    
 and Mrs. Sime, the people who own one 
 of the campsites. We have new showers 
 in just this week. There is a playpark
 for the children. There are toilets, a
 laundry, a washing-up place, a shop   
 that sells most things and a beautiful
 big beach. Along the beach from us    
 are some sand-dunes. We play there a  
 lot, jumping off them and sliding down
 them. The camp-site is called Sands Of
 Luce Caravan Park. We take tents and  
 touring caravans, and we allow dogs as
 well, but they must be on a lead on   
 the site. There are lovely walks to go
 on. Stranraer is about nine kilometres
 from our Caravan Park. We came from   
 Glasgow last year and we love it here.</content>
