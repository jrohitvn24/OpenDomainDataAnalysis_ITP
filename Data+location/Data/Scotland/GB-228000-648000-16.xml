		<content> Lynn Glen, S.W. of the town, is part  
 of the valley of Caaf Water.  It has a
 long history, with ruins of old mills 
 and houses, and folklore of witches   
 and fairies.  The Glen is a popular   
 beauty spot.  A band of limestone     
 forms waterfalls and cataracts.       
 Massive sandstone forms the cliff of  
 Pinnioch Point, called Peden's Point, 
 after the preacher who used it as a   
 natural pulpit in Covenanter times.   
 The woodland includes birch, hazel,   
 rowan,  beech and sycamore.           
 In 1979, a representative of the      
 Countryside Commission was invited    
 to come and a grant-aided project was 
 set up. Cars can now park beside a    
 path leading through deciduous        
 woodland to the waterfalls and picnic 
 areas near Peden's Point.  Steps,     
 safety fences and seats make the      
 area more attractive and accessible.  </content>
