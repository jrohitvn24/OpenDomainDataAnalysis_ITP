		<title>07The Gas Pipeline, New Deer</title>
		<content>   Beneath the fields of our           
 neighbouhood there runs a{1metre      
{diameter pipeline}carrying{natural gas
 from{St.Fergus Gas Terminal}to        
{Grangemouth,}well over 100 miles away.
   During the construction of the      
 pipeline a great deal of local        
 interest was shown in the activities  
 of the large{self-propelled machines  
{that dug the trench, lifted and moved 
{the pipes and serviced the welders.   
 There was even a most impressive self 
 propelled{machine for bending the     
{1metre diameter pipes!                
   All the{land was restored}to its    
 former use and all that shows is a    
 series of marker posts where the      
 pipeline crosses roads and also the   
{valve station at Auchmaliddie,}which  
 is maintained in a very tidy condition
 by the gas board.
