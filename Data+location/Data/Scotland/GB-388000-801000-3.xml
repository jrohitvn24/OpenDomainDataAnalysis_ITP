 Deeside Golf Club                     
 -----------------                     
 The Deeside golf course was opened in 
 1903 by George Davidson of            
 Wellwood.The course was originally    
 extended to an eighteen hole course.By
 then the membership was 460 and a new 
 club house was needed.In the last 25  
 years the course has been lengthened. 
 Now in 1985 it is very attractive.    </content>
