		<title>12Local History in Aboyne</title>
		<content>{Transport}in{Local History:}          
 Aboyne has changed considerably over  
 the past century with marked changes  
 in the road systems.  The old turnpike
 used to take a bend round by the old  
 Kirkton of Aboyne and the loch and    
 enter Aboyne above the present level  
 of the old railway.  A stretch of the 
 old highway runs in front of the      
 Aboyne Castle and can still be seen   
 today.  Here the road took a sharp    
 leftward bend and took us down to the 
 Station square.  The present day Boat 
 Inn, so called because of the{ferry}  
 crossing which operated in front of it
 around 1800 has changed dramatically  
 within living memory.  It is however  
 still in the same building, although  
 it has been modernised quite a bit.   
 There have been three{bridges}over the
 river, all built where the present day
 one stands outside the Boat Inn.      </content>
