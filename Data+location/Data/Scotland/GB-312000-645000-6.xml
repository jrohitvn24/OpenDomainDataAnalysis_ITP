		<content> OUR LOCAL FESTIVAL, IN EARLY SUMMER,  
 IS CALLED THE WHIPMAN PLAY AND IS     
 BASED AT WEST LINTON. IT STARTED ABOUT
 100 YEARS AGO WHEN SOME HORSEMEN      
 DECIDED TO FORM A MUTUAL BENEFIT      
 SOCIETY. THEY HELD PLOUGHING          
 COMPETITIONS AND CHOSE THE BEST       
 CARTHORSE. NOWADAYS WE HAVE ALL SORTS 
 OF RACES, COMPETITIONS FOR THE BEST   
 DRESSED FLOAT, A FANCY DRESS PARADE   
 AND TOSSING THE CABER. THERE IS ALSO A
 BONFIRE, BARBECUES AND DISCO DANCING. 
 THERE IS LOTS OF FUN FOR EVERYONE.    
 WE ELECT A WHIPMAN WHO HAS ONE YEAR OF
 OFFICE AND HE CHOOSES A LASS TO HELP  
 HIM IN HIS DUTIES. IT IS AN HONOUR TO 
 BE ELECTED WHIPMAN. THE PERSON CHOSEN 
 MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WORTHWHILE   
 FOR THE COMMUNITY. HE ALSO HAS TO BE  
 ABLE TO RIDE A HORSE AND HAVE A       
 PLEASING PERSONALITY TO REPRESENT OUR 
 PARISH WHEN HE VISITS OTHER FETES.    </content>
