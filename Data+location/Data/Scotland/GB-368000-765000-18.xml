		<content>    Two men from the{Forestry          
{Commission}told us about their work   
 and the forestry plantation at        
 Canterland, which covers around 3     
 square kilometres of our D-Block.     
 Canterland plantation is part of the  
{Forestry Commission's Kincardine      
{District}which has{22,050,000}trees   
 under its care.                       
    Before the trees are planted, the  
 ground is ploughed, fertilised and    
 then the young trees, which were      
 reared from seeds in the Commission's 
 nurseries, are planted with care.  At 
 planting time 18 men are employed     
 using ploughs and scarifiers.  The    
 trees are about forty years old when  
 they are cut down.  Dead wood is left 
 to rot because this provides cover for
 wild life and aids drainage if the    
 trees are growing on a slope.
