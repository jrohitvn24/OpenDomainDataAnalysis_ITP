		<content> The main attraction for tourists is   
 not hard to find;you just have to look
 around at the crags of Craigower      
 outlined against a deep blue sky,the  
 lush green fields with cows dotted in 
 picturesque patterns, and the swirling
 water of the River Tummel contrasting 
 with the calm of Loch Faskally.There  
 are a number of specially provided    
 nature trails in the vicinity of the  
 town.Special attractions exist like   
 the festival theatre, and the Dam and 
 fish ladder which lures approximately 
 500,000 visitors a year.There are also
 historical reasons for visitors with  
 strong Jacobite and late Victorian    
 connections.A Highland night is       
 presented twice weekly at the         
 Recreation ground complete with a pipe
 band and local singers and dancers.   
 In September there is the Highland    
 Games .                               </content>
