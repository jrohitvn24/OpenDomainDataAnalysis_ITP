		<content> With many farms now becoming mainly   
 arable, trading patterns have altered 
 to accomodate these changes. For      
 example, corn exchanges have closed,  
 stock is sold deadweight, there is    
 direct dealing with merchants offices 
 and warehouses and national companies 
 are replacing local merchandising     
 companies. These changes will have an 
 effect on the social gatherings and so
 social circles between farmers and    
 local people will collapse.           
  With the much reduced rural          
 population, this has brought about in 
 effect a social change with Collessie 
 primary school closing in 1981, post  
 offices shutting and the local church 
 now being linked up with the Howe of  
 Fife church. Public services to the   
 local farms improved with the         
 introduction of electricity in 1952   
 and mains water in 1953.              </content>
