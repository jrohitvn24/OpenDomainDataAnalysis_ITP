		<title>03OUR VILLAGE</title>
		<content> I like Eaglesham because it is in the 
 country and so has not so many people 
 as in a town.The centre of the village
 is old and shaped like and an "A".In  
 the centre of the "A" is a common     
 green called The Orry with a stream   
 running through it with two           
 waterfalls.At the top there is a wood 
 of broadleaved trees and then a grassy
 area with scattered trees.This is a   
 great place to have picnics,play in,  
 find plants,birds and animals and     
 climb trees.At night coming into the  
 village from East Kilbride the lights 
 up the streets look like a runway and 
 maybe someday an airliner might land  
 there.Over the years streets have been
 added on around the original Eaglesham
 and I think they have spoiled it.     
 However the centre still looks like a 
 picture book especially in winter when
 white with snow and sparkling frost.  </content>
