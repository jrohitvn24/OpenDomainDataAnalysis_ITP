		<title>14RASHFIELD SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>  This small two teacher, rural school 
 was built about 1890. The original    
 building consisted of 1 classroom and 
 later this was divided into 2.        
  A portacabin was erected in 1975 and 
 was replaced in 1980 by a new         
 extension to the original building. It
 consisted of a classroom, staffroom,  
 toilets, servery and cloakroom. A     
 tarmac playground was also provided.  
  The new extension has meant better   
 working conditions for staff and      
 pupils. The playground is more        
 suitable than mud or grass although   
 there is still grass and wooded areas 
 as well.                              
  The school roll has been down to 7 in
 1964 and 1968 and there was talk of   
 the school being closed. At present   
 there are 42 pupils rising to 45 or 46
 in session 1985-86.
