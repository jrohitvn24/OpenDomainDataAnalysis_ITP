		<title>03A TRIP WITH THE"RESEARCH"</title>
		<content>  I was off with the Research.We left  
 the pier and steamed for 24hours.We   
 sailed north then west through Yell   
 Sound turning south westerly and      
 sailing until we were off Foula.Then  
 we switched on the sonars and meters  
 and found a mark, this is what meter  
 readings for a shoal of fish is       
 called.While the net was shot the     
 boat steamed in a wide circle and came
 back to the buoy on the end of the net
 rope .This was taken aboard and the   
 ropes winched in.The rope on the net  
 bottom was pulled tight"pursing" the  
 net.The fish were trapped.The net was 
 brought alongside,the fish pump was   
 lowered into the net and the catch    
 pumped aboard.In one shot 60tonnes    
 of herring were caught. After one more
 shot the total,110 tonnes, was enough 
 to trip to Denmark with.The catch sold
 for about Â£25 000.                    </content>
