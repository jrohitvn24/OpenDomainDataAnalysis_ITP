		<title>08SHOPPING IN PETERHEAD</title>
		<content> Our group went into Peterhead's       
 shopping centre and asked people some 
 questions about the shops in          
 Peterhead.                            
 Most of them were young mothers or    
 middle-aged women.The general opinion 
 was that the centre could be improved 
 by adding large chain stores like     
 "Marks and Spencers"and also          
 "Mothercare"and by taking away some of
 the many shoe shops and               
 hairdressers.Most people bought their 
 week's groceries from "Presto"and"Fine
 Fare"because they are cheaper than the
 small corner grocery shops.Everyone   
 preferred Aberdeen for clothes as     
 there is a better selection there.We  
 think there should be more modern     
 boutiques with teenage clothes in     
 them.The general public think         
 Peterhead as a shopping centre could  
 be greatly improved.                  </content>
