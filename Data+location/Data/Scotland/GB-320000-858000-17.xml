		<title>17Cloddach Quarry.</title>
		<content>  Our first impression of Cloddach     
 Quarry was of sandy hills,machinery   
 and deserted landscape.However this   
 hid an unexpected abundance of bird   
 life.As we approached we were         
 surprised to find an oyster catcher   
 sitting on 3 eggs in a small          
 depression in gravel only metres from 
 the office door.Further away from the 
 vehicles and machinery were several   
 large ponds of water.One,thick with   
 reeds had made ideal nesting cover for
 water birds.Pairs of mallards and     
 coots with young moved quietly among  
 the reeds.Many nests,including a      
 swan's,were seen.Above wheeled black_ 
 headed,common and herring gulls while 
 others watched from low hills.A pair  
 of swans and six cygnets swam nearby. 
 The secluded quarry provided an ideal 
 site for large nesting birds.
