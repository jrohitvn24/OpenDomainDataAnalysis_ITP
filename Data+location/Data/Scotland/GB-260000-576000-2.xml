		<content>   There is one Primary School in New  
 Galloway, namely, Kells Primary. It is
 a three teacher unit with a present   
 roll of 60 pupils. Kells Primary has a
 wide catchment area, taking, not only 
 the village children, but also those  
 whose parents work for the Forestry   
 Commission at Clatteringshaws and the 
 Bennan.Almost half the children have  
 to be transported to school. The      
 school involves many members of the   
 community in its Project work. The    
 I.Q.of the children is above average  
 and they costantly show their talents 
 in sport and music at Regional and    
 National Festivals.                   
   The children transfer to Dalry      
 Secondary School, two Kilometres away.
 Here the children work to "O" Grades  
 and then they transfer to             
 Kirkcudbright Academy for "A"Levels.
