 The Timesharing scheme is a new       
 development of luxury chalets with a  
 choice of swapping your bought holiday
 week with one abroad.  A television   
 and press advertising campaign has    
 started in Scotland, and nationwide   
 but not yet abroad. It is thought that
 a lot of weeks will be sold to        
 Americans who are fond of holidays in 
 this area. There will be twenty-two   
 lodges by October and eighty-five     
 eventually. Timeshare owners will be  
 able to use the Country Club          
 facilities. Doubts have been expressed
 by some local people about the        
 scarring of the landscape and so on by
 this major building plan.
