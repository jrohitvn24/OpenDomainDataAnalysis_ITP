		<title>13NEWTON QUARRY</title>
		<content> NEWTON QUARRY STOPPED PRODUCTION ABOUT
 5 YEARS AGO.   THE SANDSTONE FROM HERE
 WAS USED FOR FAMOUS BUILDINGS, SUCH AS
 ST. ANDREW'S HOUSE IN EDINBURGH AND   
 THE CAIRD HALL IN DUNDEE.   THE STONE 
 WAS FORMERLY TAKEN BY CART TO EDROM   
 STATION.   THE OLD CRANES AND STONE   
 CUTTING SHED ARE STILL THERE.    THERE
 IS ALSO A CROW BAR NEEDING TWO MEN TO 
 LIFT IT.                              
                                       
 NOW THE QUARRY IS A WILD QUIET PLACE, 
 FULL OF TREES AND PLANTS, WHERE BIRDS 
 AND ANIMALS LIVE UNDISTURBED.   THE   
 FARMER WATCHED FOX CUBS PLAYING HERE. 
  THERE ARE TWO PONDS WHERE TWO        
 GOLDFISH, SET FREE BY A HOLIDAY MAKER 
 WHO WON THEM AT A FAIR, HAVE GROWN    
 QUITE LARGE.   THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF
 BEEHIVES BECAUSE OF THE SURROUNDING   
 FIELDS OF OILSEED RAPE, WHICH THE BEES
 LIKE.                                 </content>
