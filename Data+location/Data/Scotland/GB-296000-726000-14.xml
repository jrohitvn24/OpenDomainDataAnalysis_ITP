		<content> John Carnegie, 13 years old, studies:{
{Mathematics, English, History,        
{Geography, French, Latin, Science, Art
{and Divinity.} In his spare time he   
 mostly goes swimming or does some     
 other sport.  He enjoys boarding      
 school as most of the time there is a 
 lot to do.  As a second former he     
 believes that his work  is easy .     
 The relationship between junior and   
 senior boys is good  but the juniors  
 feel that some are too 'fascist'. He  
 feels that the running                
 of the school should be modernised, as
 should the buildings, e.g. the Science
 block.  The major disadvantage of a   
 junior boy is the labour and fagging  
 that must be done.                    
 This boy hopes that the Labour Party  
 will not abolish public schools,      
 should they gain power.
