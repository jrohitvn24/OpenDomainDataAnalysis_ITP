		<title>18Rural - Farming</title>
		<content> The farmland inthis area is all within
 3km of the coast and is therefore     
 totally within the very fertile       
 coastal plain of Fife. Fife has been  
 one of the most prosperous farming    
 areas of Scotland for many            
 centuries.James V described Fife as 'A
 reuch Scots blanket wi' a fringe o'   
 gowd.'(A beggers mantle with a fringe 
 of gold.)                             
 In the past few years there has been a
 considerable amount of Oil Seed Rape  
 grown. In May and June, when the Rape 
 is in bloom the countryside is        
 transformed by the vast areas of      
 bright yellow flowers. Government     
 incentives mean there is a similar    
 trend throughout the country. In      
 addition to the Rape the main crops   
 grown in this area are potatoes, grain
 crops and sown grass for grazing      
 animals (mostly dairy cattle) on.     </content>
