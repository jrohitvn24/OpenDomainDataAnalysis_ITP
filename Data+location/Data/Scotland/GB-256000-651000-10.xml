 and sport centre in East Kilbride and 
 also for shopping expeditions to      
 the very large shopping centre there. 
  There were very few users of the     
 A.S.D.A.bus on our survey which was   
 spread over all parts of the village  
 but as the bus is kept running weekly 
 we think it must be well used perhaps 
 by these local people without cars    
 On our survey of 122 families spread  
 over the village there were only 3    
 without cars. 48 families had two cars
 and about 6 had 3 or more.Of these 98 
 families had at least one company car.
 These which had second cars used them 
 a lot to carry their children to their
 various activities.There is a petrol  
 station in the village.Much of the    
 petrol is sold on company             
 accounts.There are numerous motor     
 repair shops in our area.             </content>
