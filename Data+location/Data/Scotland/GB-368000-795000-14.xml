		<content> Our class's favourite{Playground Game}
 is called{'Buzz Off'.}We often play{  
{Buzz Off'} because it is easy and good
 fun to play.{Buzz Off}is a game played
 with {3 }or more players.Someone is   
 given the job of{catcher}or{'it'}.The 
 game is played in an area which has   
{steps}and you run from one set of     
 steps to another.If someone comes to  
 your steps and tells you to 'buzz off'
 then you must leave those steps and   
 find another set.When you get to      
 another set of steps you must say     
 'Buzz off' and whoever is on the steps
 must leave.                           
  The{catcher's}job is to catch people 
 as they run from one set of steps to  
 another.If you get caught then you    
 become the{catcher}.By the way it is  
 important that there are more people  
 than steps so that there are always   
 people on the move.                   </content>
