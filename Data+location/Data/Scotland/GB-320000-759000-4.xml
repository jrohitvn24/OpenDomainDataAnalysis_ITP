		<title>04Glenisla Church</title>
		<content> Glenisla originally had two churches. 
 The Free Church is no longer there and
 the present church was built in 1821  
 although there is mention of a church 
 in Glenisla back in the 14th century. 
 The church to_day is a very simple    
 building with a seating capacity which
 has been reduced from the seven       
 hundred seats when it was built to the
 present one hundred and seventy seats.
 There are seventy two members in the  
 church. An average of only one wedding
 and one christening ceremony is held  
 per year. The Church of Scotland      
 minister travels to the three churches
 of Lintrathen, Kilry and Glenisla.    
 There is a one hour service on a      
 Sunday. There is a Woman's Guild and  
 Sunday School for the children.
