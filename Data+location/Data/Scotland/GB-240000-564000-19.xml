		<title>19ACID RAIN</title>
		<content>  { Acid rain}is one of the major      
 environmental issues in this area.It  
 is caused by{pollution}from power     
 stations,factories and cars. They emit
 SO2 and NO2 which are absorbed by rain
 and this falls as dilute  sulphuric   
 acid or acid rain.                    
   The problem is made even worse in   
 this area by{high rainfall,rock type  
 and{large forest areas.               
   The rock is mainly{granite}covered  
 with peat.Peaty soil is slightly      
 acidic  and contains little{calcium}so
 it cannot neutralise the acid rain.   
 Granite is non_porous and cannot      
 absorb the rain,so it filters down    
 into lochs and rivers.                
   Large forest areas in Galloway are  
 a problem.Experiments on Scots Pine   
 have shown acidity can be increased   
{ten times}by the time it has run      
 through the needles and down the bark.</content>
