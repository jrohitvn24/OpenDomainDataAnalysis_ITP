 I LIVE IN A FISHING FAMILY AND MY     
 FATHER HAS BEEN A FISHERMAN FOR ABOUT 
 25 YEARS. MY TWO GRANDFATHERS WERE    
 FISHERMEN TOO.                        
 MY FATHER LEAVES AT APPROXIMATELY     
 1O.3O PM ON SUNDAY NIGHT FROM THE     
 HOUSE. HIM AND THE OTHER FIVE CREW    
 MEMBERS TRAVEL DOWN TO PETERHEAD WHERE
 THEY ARE, AT THE MOMENT, FISHING OUT  
 OF. THE BOAT IS CALLED THE "MORNING   
 STAR". IT IS A BUCKIE REGISTERED      
 VESSEL AND THE NUMBER IS BCK 1O.      
 THEY FISH ABOUT 1OO MILES OFF OF      
 PETERHEAD. THEY HAVE TO STEAM FOR     
 ABOUT 1O HOURS BEFORE THEY REACH THE  
 FISHING GROUNDS. THEY HAVE SPECIAL    
 NETS FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF FISH. THE 
 AVERAGE BOXES OF FISH THEY CATCH IN A 
 WEEK WOULD BE ABOUT 15O.
