		<content> As there is no village school,limited 
 availability of employment,no shopping
 facilities,and a limited bus service, 
 nearly every family in this area      
 depend on their own transport,some    
 travelling several miles to work.     
 Primary children travel 5 miles,and   
 secondary children 7 miles to the     
 nearest schools. Some mothers go out  
 to work, though most look after the   
 homes.  Most families have pets,      
 television, telephones and hi_fi      
 equipment. As this is a more remote   
 village, the children are encouraged  
 to persue outdoor activities, and full
 use of the village park is made.      
 Cycling is very popular with the      
 children and more parents are becoming
 interested as the trend for health and
 fitness continues. All the parents    
 take a keen interest in their         
 childrens welfare.                    </content>
