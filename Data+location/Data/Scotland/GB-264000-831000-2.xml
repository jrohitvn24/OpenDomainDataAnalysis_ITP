		<title>02FARMING</title>
		<content>  I live on a farm. The crops we grow  
 on the farm are corn, barley, silage, 
 hay, potatoes and turnips.            
  When the barley is cut it is taken to
 the farm by trailer. It is put into a 
 bruiser which flattens the barley.    
  We keep cattle and sheep. We feed the
 cattle the bruised barley or bruisen  
 with their silage and it makes them   
 fat so they make a good price at the  
 slaughter house.We feed the sheep hay,
 turnips and sometimes bruisin.        
  If you have a farm that is mostly    
 hill land your best choice of sheep   
 would be blackface.They can be left on
 the hill for nearly a week and not get
 stuck on their backs.                 
  Some of the fields in the vally are  
 sown out in grass to feed the cattle  
 on so they have enough milk to feed   
 their calves.
