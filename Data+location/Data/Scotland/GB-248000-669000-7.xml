		<content> and 25% from the District Council.The 
 aim of the centre is to help combat   
 the effects of unemployment by        
 organising educational and rec-       
 reational activities eg.computer      
 courses and canoeing.Advice is also   
 given on such topics as welfare rights
 adult education and self-employment.  
 In a questionaire the average age of  
 interviewees was 20.Many were involved
 in training courses, some are trainee 
 instructors in outdoor activities.Some
 devote much time and effort to        
 youth organisations.All this combines 
 to give hope of a permanent job in the
 future.Other unemployed spend their   
 time in the centre using the available
 facilities.Only some are satisfied    
 with the YTS and all feel benefits are
 too low.The unemployed feel the       
 employed are unconcerned about them.
