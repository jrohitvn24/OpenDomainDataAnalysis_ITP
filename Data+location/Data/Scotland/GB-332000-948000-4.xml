		<content> It was reported in the John O'Groat   
 Journal in May 1985 that meetings had 
 been held in all four primary schools 
 in Wick to discuss the possibility of 
 closing one school, owing to the      
 falling roll.We, as pupils of         
 Pulteneytown Academy School, hope our 
 school will be kept open. In the last 
 three years our Parent Teachers'      
 Association have been helping the     
 school by raising money at different  
 events-Christmas Fayre, Barbecue,     
 Beetle Drive.On these occasions       
 parents come and enjoy themselves.The 
 money goes to the school funds. We now
 have five computers, disc drives and  
 a printer,which have allowed us to    
 take part in the Domesday Project.
