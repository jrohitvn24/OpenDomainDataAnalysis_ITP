		<content> The Dunfermline Police Force, which   
 now employs 650 men, has to deal with 
 approximately four arrests per day.   
 This number increased during the year 
 long miners' strike.  Nowadays the    
 Dunfermline Police find that younger  
 people commit more crimes than older  
 people.                               
    Few murders are committed in the   
 Dunfermline area, but Police find that
 drugs are an increasing problem.      
    There are four inspectors and nine 
 sergeants at Dunfermline Police       
 Station.  Eleven traffic wardens      
 assist the police.                    
    There are 17 cells at the new      
 police station: 14 for men and 3 for  
 women.                                
    A Sheriff Court has recently been  
 built beside the police station.
