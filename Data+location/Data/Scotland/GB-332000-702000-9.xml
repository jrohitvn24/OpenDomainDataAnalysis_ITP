		<title>09Churches in Kennoway</title>
		<content>  There are five churches in Kennoway, 
 four of which are still in use. The   
 Free Church of Scotland had to close  
 its doors earlier this year because of
 vandalism.                            
  Kennoway Parish Church was originally
 sited in the Causeway next to the     
 Mercat Cross but is now in Cupar Road.
 The church was founded in 1619 and has
 the second oldest communion cup in    
 Scotland dating back to 1671.         
  The Arnott Gospel Hall, also in Cupar
 Road, was originally a second Church  
 of Scotland church serving the people 
 to the north of the village but       
 changed to a Gospel Hall in 1977.     
  The Elim Pentecostal Church is in New
 Road at present but plans to move to  
 the disused Free Church premises, also
 in New Road.                          
  St.Giles Church, Langside Crescent,  
 serves the Roman Catholic community.  </content>
