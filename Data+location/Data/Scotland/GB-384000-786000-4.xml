 Stonehaven, therby letting vehicles   
 heading to/from Aberdeen avoid the    
 small town centre with its narrow     
 streets, were put forward as early as 
 1927. Work did not begin however until
 1982. Congestion in the town cene,    
 Allardyce street had reached          
 unacceptable levels. This was mainly

 Beneath the main railway line at      
 Fetteresso. The bypass then runs in   
 abroad sweep to the norh east,        
 crossing the deep gorge of the Cowie  
 Water. The dual carriageway is 8.3km.

 over one miilion cubic metres of earth
