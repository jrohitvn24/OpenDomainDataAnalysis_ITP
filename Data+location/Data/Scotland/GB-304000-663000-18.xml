		<title>18FACTORY VISITS IN LIVINGSTON</title>
		<content> We visited{Scintronix Ltd}which       
 designs and manufactures{Gamma        
{Cameras.}This is a camera which       
 photographs gamma rays instead of     
 light rays. If it is suspected you    
 have a cancer, you are given an       
 injection of radioactive material.    
 This chemical can be made to collect  
 in the organ of the body being        
 examined. It gives off gamma rays     
 which can then be photographed by the 
 gamma camera.                         
 At{Lothian Glass Products Ltd}we were 
 interested in seeing how a computer is
 used to do all the office work,       
 previously needing 3 office staff. The
 computer can keep an up to date record
 of stock; calculate the cost and print
 out invoices for customers; work out  
 the measurements of the glass needed  
 and even show how to cut the glass so 
 there is very little wastage.         </content>
