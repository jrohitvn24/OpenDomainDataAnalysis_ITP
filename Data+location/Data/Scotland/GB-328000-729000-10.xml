		<title>10LONGFORGAN - SNR.CIT'S.CLUB.</title>
		<content> The members of this club meet every   
 Tuesday afternoon during the period   
 September to May, and these social    
 occasions always prove to be very     
 interesting and enjoyable. The aim of 
 the club is to extend friendship and  
 help, as required. The membership fee 
 is nominal (usually 50p per annum) but
 the funds are augmented by a small    
 weekly charge for tea and a raffle,   
 and by the generosity of local        
 business people, and a sale of work.  
 These gifts enable the club committee 
 to organise, at no cost to the club   
 members, a summer outing and a        
 Christmas dinner. At the weekly       
 meetings the members play cards and   
 dominoes, have happy sing-songs, and  
 occasionally a film show. Longforgan  
 has many elderly residents, so this   
 club is very well utilised and very   
 popular.                              </content>
