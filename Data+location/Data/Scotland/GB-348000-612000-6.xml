		<title>06MEDICAL CARE IN HAWICK</title>
		<content> Hawick has a Cottage Hospital with    
 thirty beds.  It caters mainly for    
 minor emergencies, long-stay patients 
 and the elderly.  The nearest         
 hospital for serious emergencies is   
 Peel, half an hour's drive away.  Many
 patients are sent for specialist      
 treatment to Edinburgh, 55 miles away,
 where nearly two thirds of all        
 maternity confinements take place.    
 The town with its population of 17,500
 is served by ten full-time doctors    
 working from three practices.         
 Specialists travel regularly to hawick
 for diagnostic consultations.  The    
 most usual point of contact is the    
 traditional five to ten minute doctor-
 patient consultation.  As yet         
 computerization has not greatly       
 affected local doctors although       
 they anticipate that it will          
 increasingly do so.                  .</content>
