		<content> 1985 was a particularly bad year      
 weather-wise for farmers. The summer  
 was a wash-out and the grain crop     
 suffered very badly. Many farmers lost
 a substantial quantity of hay         
 resulting in a shortage of winter     
 feeding. 1982 and 1983 were memorable 
 for their severe winters. The winter  
 of 1982 was extremely cold with severe
 frost for weeks on end. 1983 gave us  
 much more snow than usual resulting in
 problems for the farmers with         
 livestock to feed. Roads were badly   
 affected for long periods of time. The
 local school was closed on many       
 occasions and the children from more  
 outlying areas did not attend school  
 for six weeks. Snow ploughs were hard 
 pushed to keep up and snow blowers    
 were needed many times to open roads.
