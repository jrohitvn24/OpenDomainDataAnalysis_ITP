		<title>14PARISH OF TIBBERMORE (7)</title>
		<content> The farmer told us that during the    
 last war, sixty acres of the farm were
 taken over by the R.A.F., who built a 
 small fighter station there. Also on  
 the farmland are two sand and gravel  
 pits which provide material for road  
 improvement schemes in the immediate  
 area.                                 
 We spoke to a retired headmaster of   
 Tibbermore Primary School, and we     
 asked him if he could tell us what the
 name "Tibbermore" is derived from. He 
 told us that the Gaelic word for a    
 well is "Tober" and the word "Muir" in
 Gaelic is Mary, so the meaning could  
 possibly be St. Mary's Well. He told  
 us when he was in the school about    
 twenty five years ago that he had     
 around fifty pupils. There was also a 
 post office, which not only sold a    
 wide variety of goods, but also acted 
 as an unofficial Community Centre!    </content>
