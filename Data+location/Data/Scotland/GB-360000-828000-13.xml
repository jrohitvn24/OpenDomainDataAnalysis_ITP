		<title>13Doctor Cooper from Insch.</title>
		<content>  When we visited Dr.Cooper he was     
 within one month of his 102nd birth_  
 day.We had to shout quite loudly      
 before he could hear our questions but
 he was happy to answer them all.      
  He was born in Kennethmont in 1883.He
 lives in Dunnydeer House which his    
 father built in 1909 for Â£1200.       
  His earliest memories are of his     
 schooling in the building in Commerce 
 Street,now "Simpson's Garage".When he 
 was twelve he went to Aberdeen Grammar
 School,but his father was disappoined 
 with the results so he was moved to   
 Gordon's College where he was very    
 happy and successful.                 
  In 1901 he went to Aberdeen Univer_  
 sity,qualifying as a doctor in 1906.  
 He wanted to get into the R.A.M.C. but
 this was not to be.So his father sent 
 a telegram to a friend, Dr.Durno, in  
 London.                               </content>
