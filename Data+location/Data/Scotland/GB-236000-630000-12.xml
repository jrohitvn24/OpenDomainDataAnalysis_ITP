		<content>                                       
    There has been a hairdresser called
{MYRA}in Symington for about 6 months. 
 They called the shop{MYRA'S }after the
 owner's name.{MYRA}gets about 17_20   
 customers in a day.The electrical     
 equipment used are hairdryers,        
 curling tongs, musical stereo and a   
 hotbrush.Their job is very tiring     
 because they have got to stand on     
 their feet all day and they get a sore
 back and sore legs. A Saturday is     
 their busiest day.The latest style is 
 very short hair.A haircut is Â£2.50,a  
 perm is Â£14_Â£16.Blonde streaks cost   
 from Â£9.00.Cut and blow dry is Â£5.70. 
 Shampoo and set is Â£3.00.Pensioners   
 get reduced rates.The shop opens at   
 9:00a.m.and closes at 5:00p.m.{MYRA}  
 did about 10 perms this week. Punks   
 come in and get their hair done and   
 the hairdressers don't mind.          </content>
