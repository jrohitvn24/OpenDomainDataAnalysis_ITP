		<title>05POPULATION IN SANDWICK</title>
		<content>   Sandwick has a population of 680.   
 There are 198 children and young      
 people, 58 of whom are under school   
 age. There are about 90 Senior        
 Citizens.                             
   Though stable again these numbers   
 were much higher from the middle to   
 late 1970's with the coming of oil    
 which increased activity at Sumburgh  
 Airport and brought workers and their 
 families to live in Sandwick.         
   People working in Lerwick find      
 Sandwick a convenient place to live.  
 In this way many young couples from   
 other areas make their homes here.    
   On the other hand young people      
 seeking work or further education must
 leave the community and very often    
 they make their homes elsewhere.
