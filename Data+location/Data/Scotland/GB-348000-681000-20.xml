		<content> The ruins of St.Andrews Church lie    
 just at the entrance to the village of
 Gullane.It was built in the 12th      
 Century, renovated in the 15th Century
 and fell into disuse around 1600 when 
 it became so overblown with sand that 
 it was deemed unsuitable as a place   
 fit for worship.                      
 The Smithy was probably built in the  
 16th century but nobody is sure.A     
 story told in the village certainly   
 illustrates the Smithy's existence in 
 the 17th Century, it is said that     
 Oliver Cromwell had his horse shod    
 there.                                
 Saltcoats Castle, now in ruins, was   
 built in the late 16th Century.It is  
 said to have been built for the       
 Livington family in return for having 
 destroyed a wild boar which was       
 ravaging the district.
