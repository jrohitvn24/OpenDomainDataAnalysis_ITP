		<content>   The area is provided with an art and
 craft centre in the old rural school  
 of Forgan. This centre is open to all 
 sectors of the public and they can    
 learn a wide variety of arts and      
 crafts, some of which are pottery,    
 drawing and painting, sculptures,     
 embroidery and tapestry work and      
 basketry. The centre also holds       
 regular exhibitions of people's work. 
 Once a year in the West hall there is 
 an exhibition of arts and crafts and  
 they also sell things like paintings  
 by the local people and jewellery.
