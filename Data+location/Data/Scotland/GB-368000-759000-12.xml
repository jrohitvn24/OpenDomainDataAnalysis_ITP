		<title>12Glenskenno Farm, Montrose.</title>
		<content>{Glenskenno Farm}covers{410 acres}and  
 is owned by Mr.Gall who runs the farm 
 with his father and a tractorman.     
{Seasonal help}is used to thin turnips 
 and pick stones.{Livestock}includes 51
 beef cows, 4 incalf heifers, 2 stock  
 bulls, 4 young bulls, 17 bullocks and 
 26 heifers for fattening, and 50      
 calves.{Crops}grown at Glenskenno are 
 winter and spring barley, winter      
 wheat, potatoes, turnips, oil seed    
 rape, and grass.Nowadays,{crop        
{rotation}is not as strictly adhered to
 because of the greater profitability  
 in cash crops rather than in          
 livestock. Therefore, less acreage of 
 grass is grown. However, there are    
 certain limitations to how often one  
 can grow a certain crop in the same   
 field due to disease.Potatoes are     
 grown 1yr. in 6 and turnips and oil   
 seed rape 1yr. in 5.                  </content>
