		<title>12SOCIAL WORKERS-GALSTON</title>
		<content> A social worker's role is to help     
 people over their problems.Financial  
 difficulties amongst elderly people   
 are common.Up until 1968 there were   
 many independent advice agencies.Then 
 the Scottish Social Working Act came  
 through and all agencies joined       
 together and formed the Social working
 system of today.The greatest change in
 Social Working is that they now are   
 forced to abide by a set of rules.In  
 Galston there is a ten-man staff who  
 find Christmas,New Year and the few   
 weeks before summer bad financial     
 times.They also write Social          
 Background reports for courts,        
 Children's  Panels and Adoption work. 
 The office is open ten hours every    
 week day.When closed a stand-by       
 service in Glasgow is put into action.
 The role of a Social Worker is very   
 wide and varied.                      </content>
