		<title>14Oldmeldrum Community Council</title>
		<content> The Community Council for Meldrum and 
 Bourtie plays an active part in       
 community welfare and representation. 
 It is awarded aproximately Â£200 each  
 year by Gordon District Council, plus 
 expenses, for use in the communtiy.   
 Meetings are held once a month in     
 Oldmeldrum Town Hall and members      
 include Chairman Cecil Webster,       
 secretary Mrs Gloria Fiddes, Mrs Ethel
 Manson, Ian Peddie, Forbes Green, Drew
 Phillip. The council is  supporter of 
 the annual Britian in Bloom contest in
 which villages and townships compete  
 for a horticultural prize.  Since     
 Oldmeldrum is the home of William     
 Forsyth (1727-1804), gardener to King 
 George III, after whom the shrub      
 Forsythia is named, the council       
 encourages local gardeners to extract 
 the most colour from their gardens for
 the beneit and pleasure of residents. </content>
