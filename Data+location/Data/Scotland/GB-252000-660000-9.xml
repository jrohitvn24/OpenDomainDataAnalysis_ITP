 I am Helen Clare McCrorie and I have a
 big sister called Marie.  On a Sunday 
 my dad, Marie and myself go to my     
 Grandma's house.                      
 We have to wait a while until lunch is
 ready.  During that time I occupy     
 myself playing games, talking or      
 sunbathing. When lunch is ready I come
 in.  We normally have stew or curry.  
 After lunch is finished I go and read 
 the Sunday Post.  When I have read the
 paper I like to tell my Grandma what  
 has happened during the week.         
 When we have said good-bye we drive   
 home.  In about five minutes we are   
 home. I go out to play or watch       
 television. At 7.l5 p.m. I watch Sorry
 a comedy series starring Ronnie       
 Corbett. From then till bedtime I     
 watch television or play with my games
 up in my bedroom.                     </content>
