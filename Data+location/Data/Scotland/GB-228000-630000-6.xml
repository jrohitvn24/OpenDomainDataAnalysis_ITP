 have joined together to pray for peace
 in the world.Each Church assists      
 deprived countries.On 6th. JULY 1985  
 all the churches are combining to     
 raise money for a water supply in     
 Uganda by holding a Fete.The Catholic 
 Church supports a village in Peru     
 named Recuay.The P7 class who wrote

 Coffee Morning in their School.Every  
 religious group plays its part to     
 make Troon a caring community.At      
 Christmas time TROON unites to praise 
 the birth of Christ.Religion plays a  
 major part in the life in TROON.
