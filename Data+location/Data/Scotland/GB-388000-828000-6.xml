		<content>  The area's housing consists of       
{farmhouses and cottages.}The cottages,
 some of them derelict or unoccupied,  
 are built with{granite and sandstone  
 walls. The roofs of the cottages are  
 made from{slate tiles.}They have no   
 upstairs windows apart from skylights}
 and the downstairs sash windows are   
{wooden framed.}The gutters and        
 drainpipes are made from iron. Some of
 the cottages that have been modernised
 have extensions and outside walls     
 which have been{harled.}These         
 extensions to the cottages are built  
 outwards from the back door. They have
{flat, felt covered roofs.}The walls   
 are built from{concrete}blocks which  
 have been harled afterwards.          
  The basic materials used for cottages
 have also been used for the farmhouses
 but the farmhouses are much larger.
