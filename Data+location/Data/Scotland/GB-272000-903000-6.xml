		<title>06Rogart - Lifestyle (Hall)</title>
		<content>  Until 1982, Rogart Hall was a wooden 
 hut. Then, it was replaced with a     
 brick building. Mr E. Davidson is the 
 caretaker and together with a Hall    
 committee, he cares for the Hall.     
  The W.R.I., British Legion, Red      
 Cross, Darts' Club, Badminton Club,   
 N.F.U., Crofters' Commission, Fiddle  
 Club, Golf Club, Brownies and Guides  
 meet there. Christmas parties, wedding
 receptions, dances, sales of work and 
 concerts are held in the Hall. The    
 Golspie doctor holds a surgery there  
 every Tuesday.                        
  Usually, it is local people who      
 attend functions in the Hall, but on  
 special occasions, people come from   
 quite a distance to attend.           
  The Hall is open six days a week. On 
 Sundays, everyone enjoys a rest.
