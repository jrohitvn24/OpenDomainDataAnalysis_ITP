		<content> SURROUNDED BY HEATHER AND BLAEBERRYS, 
 WILD FLOWERS AND TWO SMALL ROWAN TREES
 (IN SCOTLAND THEY KEEP THE WITCHES    
 AWAY) THE WATER COMES FROM            
 UNDERGROUND. IN THE PAST TRAVELLERS   
 LEFT SOME FOOD AT THE CHEESE WELL TO  
 KEEP THEM SAFE ON THEIR DANGEROUS     
 JOURNEYS ACROSS THE HILLS AND TO      
 ENSURE THE FRIENDSHIP OF              
 THE "WEE FOLK". WE PUT LITTLE PIECES  
 OF THE CHEESE BY THE WELL. WE DROPPED 
 THE FAIRY HATS THAT WE FOUND ON THE   
 PATH ON THE WAY UP, INTO THE WATER. WE
 MADE OUR WISHES AT THE WELL. SHIRLEY  
 SAW A FAIRY WITH A LEAF HAT. WE THINK 
 THEY LIVE IN TUNNELS BEHIND THE       
 STONES. SOME OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE CAME
 AND TOOK SOME OF THE FOOD THAT WE HAD 
 LEFT FOR THEM WHEN WE WERE'NT LOOKING.
 WE SAID GOODBYE TO  THE CHEESE WELL   
 AND THE WEE FOLK AND WENT BACK DOWN   
 THE HILL IN THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE.      </content>
