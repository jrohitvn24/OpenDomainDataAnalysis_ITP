		<content> WE HAD A VISIT FROM OUR REGIONAL      
 COUNCILLOR RECENTLY AND SHE TOLD US   
 ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. FIRSTLY, THERE
 ARE COMMUNITY COUNCILS. OUR COUNCIL IS
 CALLED THE LAMANCHA, NEWLANDS AND     
 KIRKURD COMMUNITY COUNCIL AND SOME OF 
 OUR PARENTS MEET EVERY MONTH TO       
 DISCUSS PROBLEMS OR SUGGEST           
 IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT.      
 THEN THERE IS THE DISTRICT COUNCIL FOR
 TWEEDALE, BASED IN PEEBLES. IT DEALS  
 WITH COUNCIL HOUSING, REFUSE          
 COLLECTION, TOURISM AND PARKS. NEXT   
 THERE IS THE BORDERS REGIONAL COUNCIL 
 WITH ITS HEADQUARTERS IN NEWTOWN ST.  
 BOSWELLS. MANY PEOPLE THERE DEAL WITH 
 EDUCATION, LIBRARIES, PLANNING AND    
 DEVELOPMENT, SOCIAL WORK, ROADS,      
 RATES, WATER AND DRAINAGE AND DECIDE  
 IN COMMITTEES HOW THERE BUDGET SHOULD 
 BE USED.                              
                                       </content>
