		<title>07Housing in Dalgety Bay</title>
		<content>{Dalgety Bay}is only twenty-five years 
 old. It was conceived as a{commuter   
 town for the middle classes, yet this 
 idea has altered since then, with many
 families moving in from other parts of
 Britain. Now there are{6500+          
 inhabitants with further development  
 continuing in the west of the Bay.    
 However concern has grown over the    
{lack of ammenities}in the area,       
 although the situation has improved   
 somewhat with the building of a new   
 shopping centre in the last two years.
 The{Industrial Estate}provides many of
 the inhabitants with jobs. There are  
 two primary schools, with plans for a 
 third. The nearby{Braefoot Bay}Liquid 
 Petroleum Gas terminal has also       
 provided many jobs in managerial and  
 construction positions. There is a    
 thriving{sailing}club on the shore of 
 the Forth.                            </content>
