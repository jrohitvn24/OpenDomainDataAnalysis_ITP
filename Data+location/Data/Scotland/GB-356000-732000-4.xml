		<title>04Carnoustie Area Coastguard.</title>
		<content>   All coastguards have a very risky   
 job,especially in the summer.Carnou-  
 tie lies just past the estuary of the 
 river Tay and at the east end of its  
 long golden beach stands the          
 coastguard's lookout tower.It is used 
 as by the auxiliary guards.These men  
 work only part-time and so to give    
 full cover,24 hours a day,they work in
 shifts.summer.The area which the full-
 time coastguard covers stretches from 
 Arbroath,north of Carnoustie,south    
 past Crail and Anstruther.Without his 
 auxiliaries,Mr Stewart,the full-timer,
 could not look after all his area.    
   Carnoustie's beach is a particularly
 safe one and the coastguard rarely has
 problems with thoughtless tourists (or
 locals) using air-beds,as the current 
 is not very strong.Most of his work   
 comes in rescuing people who are stuck
 on the cliffs further up the coast.   </content>
