		<title>11CHANGING TIMES IN DALBEATTIE</title>
		<content> In an interview with the grandmother  
 of one of our pupils we learned how   
 Dalbeattie has changed in her time.   
  In her schooldays pupils used slate  
 pencils and stood round an open fire. 
 In the street in summer they went     
 barefoot. At other times they wore    
 clogs or went "slipshod". The roads   
 were cobbled to help horses to take   
 grip to pull carts and on hot days a  
 watering cart came round to lay the   
 dust. On winter nights the "learie" or
 lamplighter lit the gas lamps in the  
 streets and threw the spent matches   
 away for the children to scramble     
 over.                                 
  Nowadays we have computers in school 
 as well as central heating, the roads 
 are covered with tarmac so that cars  
 and buses can run smoothly and safely 
 and streets are lit up at nights by   
 electric light.                       </content>
