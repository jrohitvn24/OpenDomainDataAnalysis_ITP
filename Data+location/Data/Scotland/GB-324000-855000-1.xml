 Estate gives way to uncultivated      
 moorland as we climb to Brown Muir    
 338ft above sea level where a trig    
 station and radio telephone mast are  
 situated.   To the west lies Hillbuies
 country park gifted to Elgin for      
 people to enjoy country walks, picnics
 or fishing.   Part of the estate is   
 given overto forest trees as a        
 commercial enterprise.   On the       
 surrounding hills crops are grown and

 unfortunatly ceased production on 31st
 April due to a recession in the       
 whiskey industry.   Few people live in
