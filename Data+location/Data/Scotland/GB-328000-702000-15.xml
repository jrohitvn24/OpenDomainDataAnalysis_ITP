 WOMENS RURAL INSTITUTE - The rural is 
 for grown-ups. They have a chat and   
 have food like bacon &amp; eggs etc. They 
 also have cake &amp; tea. They go to other
 places too.  {GREG WADDELL.}          
{YOUTH CLUB }- In the village hall I go
 to the youth club. We play games like 
 rounders, football, skipping &amp; chess. 
 The youth club leader is Jacqueline   
 Black's Grandad, William Shields. We  
 have a Christmas party and a          
 Hallow'een party. We dress up at the  
 Hallow'een party and have a fancy     
 dress competition. We duck for apples 
 which involves lots of apples in a tub
 of water while we try to pick the     
 apples out with our teeth.{SARAH WANDS
{SUNDAY SCHOOL }- The Sunday School    
 teacher is Mrs. Margaret Black.       
{BADMINGTON }- The club is held each   
 Monday evening in the hall.           </content>
