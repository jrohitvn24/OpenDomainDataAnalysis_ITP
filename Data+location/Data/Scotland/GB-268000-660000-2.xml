        Sport is very popular in this  
area especially among the young. We    
have an annual 'Fun Run'. Tom McKean, a
local runner, hopes to make the next   
Olympics. Many football teams operate, 
from under age 10 to under 18 as well  
as amateur sides and one Junior team,  
Thorniewood. Many of the boys who play 
out in the streets might become as     
famous as others from Viewpark.        
        Uddingston has a private tenn- 
is club as well as a rugby club. It    
also has an old well-known cricket club
which has won many honours in Scotland 
but not many children play this game.  
Both Viewpark and Uddingston have      
bowling clubs with many members.       
Birkenshaw Sports Centre has sports    
such as badminton, squash, football    
and roller-skating too.
