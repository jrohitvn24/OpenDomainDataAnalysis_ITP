		<title>18CHICKEN REARING</title>
		<content> My father is employed looking after   
 chickens for Invernairn Products who  
 also sell swimming pools.There are    
 54000 chickens in one shed.They are   
 taken in at two days old and taken    
 away at 4 to 5 weeks old to be        
 slaughtered for the shops.The sheds   
 were built in 1964.There are three    
 other companies that help Invernairn  
 Products,namely Grampian Chickens,    
 General Chip, and North Eastern.      
 Grampian Chickens stock day old       
 chicks .General Chip stock wood chips 
 and North Eastern stock feed.These all
 help Invernairn Products.There is     
 always a worry of suffocation because 
 car noises from outside frighten the  
 chickens causing them to run into one 
 corner of the shed.They are not kept  
 in separate boxes but in one big shed 
 heated by gas fan heaters.
