		<title>13A Mixed Farm</title>
		<content>  Dounepark Farm is a mixed farm,      
 typical of many in our area. It is one
 of the main farms around Banff, and   
 also one of the biggest. Although the 
 farm is mixed there is a main         
 industry. It is the beef industry. In 
 this the farmer buys young cattle at  
 the beginning of Autumn and fattens   
 them up during the winter months. In  
 the Spring they are sold for a good   
 price. Usually they are sold for      
 slaughter but sometimes other farmers 
 will buy them.                        
  Dounepark Farm has two big silos for 
 storing crops. The bigger of the two  
 holds haylage for feeding the cattle  
 in the winter months. Haylage is made 
 from grass which is chopped into small
 pieces. The smaller of the two silos  
 holds barley. Barley is the most      
 popular crop in this area.
