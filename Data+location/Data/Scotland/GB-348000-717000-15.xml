		<title>15OWNERSHIP OF THE LINKS</title>
		<content> Golf was originally played on common  
 land. To foil an attempt by the R.&amp; A.
 to set up a private course, 500 acres 
 of land were purchased from Mr Cheape 
 of Strathyrum by a Private Act of     
 Parliament in 1894. Till the local    
 government reorganisation in 1975, the
 links were owned by St.Andrews Burgh  
 Council. In 1974 the Links Trust was  
 set up by Act of Parliament to take   
 over responsibility for the courses.  
 There are 8 trustees:the M.P. for     
 North East Fife; 1 nominated by       
 the Secretary of State for Scotland; 3
 by the R.&amp; A.;3 by the North East Fife
 District Council. The management of   
 the courses is in the hands of the    
 Links Management Committee of whom 4  
 are nominated by the District Council 
 and 4 by the R.&amp; A. They employ 50    
 full-time greenkeepers with about 10  
 extra staff in summer.                </content>
