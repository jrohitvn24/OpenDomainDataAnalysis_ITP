		<title>02Farming in Blackridge</title>
		<content>   This is about{farming}in the        
 Blackridge area.  There is a lot of   
 heath around here. There are a lot of 
 dairy farms and mixed farms. The{crops
 are on the low land and the high land 
 is used for grazing. Some farmers use 
{hay}but most dairy farms use{silage.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
   {      *  *  *  *  *  *             
                                       
    The farmers take the {cows         
 to Lanark, Stirling or Biggar{markets.
 There are  slaughterhouses in Bathgate
 and Shotts  to take the fat{lambs}and 
 cows.                                 
   In one farm there is a{quarry}which 
 had been closed for 27 years. It had a
 big face on it.  In another is a      
 building for the quarry. It is called 
 the magazine for gun powder.          </content>
