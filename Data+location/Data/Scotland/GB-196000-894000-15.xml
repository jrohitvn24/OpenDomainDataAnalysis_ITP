		<title>15BADLUARACH CHILDREN-SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   IN THE 1930s THE CHILDREN AT        
 BADLUARACH WALKED 3 MILES TO GET TO   
 THEIR SCHOOL. IT WAS A ROUGH TRACK AND
 THERE WERE LOTS OF THINGS TO DISTRACT 
 THEM SUCH AS COLLECTING NUTS OR       
 PLAYING IN PUDDLES. THERE WERE 30     
 CHILDREN IN BADCAUL SCHOOL.CHILDREN   
 WOULD COME FROM AS FAR AWAY AS        
 CAMUSNAGAUL. THERE WERE SIDE SCHOOLS  
 AT DUNDONNELL AND GRUINARD.           
   TODAY THERE IS A SCHOOL BUS WHICH   
 COLLECTS CHILDREN FROM BADLUARACH,    
 DUNDONNELL,BADRALLACH AND CAMUSNAGAUL,
 SO THERE IS NO CHANCE OF PLAYING ON   
 THE WAY TO SCHOOL. NOWADAYS THE SCHOOL
 BUS LEAVES BADLUARACH ROAD END AT A   
 QUARTER PAST NINE AND SCHOOL STARTS AT
 HALF-PAST.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
