		<title>02HOW SHAPINSAY GOT ITS NAME</title>
		<content> Many years ago, it  was argued how    
{Shapinsay}got its name. It could have 
 meant{Sheep valley}because the{Saxons 
 thought "ay" meant valley, and "shap" 
 meant sheep. It also could have meant 
{Sheep Island}because in{Norse}"shap"  
 meant sheep and "ay" meant island.    
 Both explanations could be right,     
 because we know that the{Saxons}as    
 well as the{Vikings}have inhabited    
 this island.                          
 At the present time,{Shapinsay}has    
 only one farm which is purely a sheep 
 farm, but the nick-name of "Shapinsay 
 Sheep" still sticks to the islanders !
