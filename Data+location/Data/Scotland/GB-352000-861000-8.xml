 In  1976, European Architectural      
 Heritage year, Fordyce village, having
 earlier been made a conservation area,
 benefitted from Scottish Development  
 Dept. grants to preserve and improve  
 the village.There were 37 buildings   
 listed as having architectural and    
 historic inportance, owners being     
 offered financial help to bring these 
 up to standard.Overhead power cables  
 were repositioned underground,new     
 street lighting supplied,footpaths re-
 surfaced, street names &amp; traffic signs
 replaced,damaged buildings restored,  
 trees planted &amp; amenity areas for     
 adults &amp; children provided.Other im-  
 provements must now conform strictly  
 to conservation guidelines.Development
 of the village is therefore monitored.
