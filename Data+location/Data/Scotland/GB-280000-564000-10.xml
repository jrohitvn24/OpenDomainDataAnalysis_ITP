		<title>10HIDE AND SEEK</title>
		<content> This is a game played outside for two 
 or more people.  One person is chosen 
 to stand in the 'Den' and count up to 
 one hundred while the others go and   
 hide.  The person who is counting is  
 called 'The Seeker', and when they    
 have finished counting call out "Ready
 or not, here I come!".  The seeker    
 will then try to find the 'Hiders'.   
 If the seeker sees any of the hiders  
 he calls out their name and they're   
 caught.  The first person caught is   
 'it' next time.
