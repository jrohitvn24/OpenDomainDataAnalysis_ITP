    It was Tuesday morning and I was   
 awakened by my older sister drying her
 hair."Get up Diane" I heard my mum    
 shout upstairs.I had to be quick      
 because my mum was going to her work  
 early.I quickly dressed and hurried   
 downstairs  to have my breakfast.It   
 was just about time to leave for      
 school.I was just walking along the   
 road to Pauline's house when I        
 remembered we were going to walk from 
 Borthwick to Crichton castle today    
 with Mr Wright for the Domesday       
 project.Pauline and I walked down to  
 school together and met Michelle and  
 everbody else.When we arrived at      
 9.00am Mr.Smith the student was there 
 too.17 children, Mr Ross and Mr Wright
 squashed ourselves into the mini bus  
 and the remainder travelled with Mr   
 Smith in his car. (continued)         </content>
