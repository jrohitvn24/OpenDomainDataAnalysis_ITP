		<content> and rock. Two flyovers and three major
 bridges had to be built. After the    
 opening of the bypass in Nov. 84 there
 were complaints. Shopkeepers were     
 woried about falling trade. Garages   
 too for falling Petrol Sales. Fears   
 were expressed about Stonehaven's     
 Tourist trade. Would it benefit or    
 loose with the bypass?                
   But now as cars, lorries, busses,   
 vans all bypass Stonehaven it is      
 difficult to imagine that at one time 
 up to 12000 vehicles a day passed     
 along Dunnotar Avenue and Allardyce   
 street. Stonehaven still bussels with 
 trade. It is still dificult to park   
 your car on a Saturday morning. Trade 
 seems brisk. But gone are the smells  
 and vibrations of the juggernauts and 
 gone are the long waits of several    
 minutes to cross the road.
