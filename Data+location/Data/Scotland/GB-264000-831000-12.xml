		<content>  Millions of years ago the glaciers   
 covering Strathnairn carried large    
 rocks with them.These were left when  
 the ice melted.They can still be seen 
 all over our area.One on them on the  
 road between Dunlichity and Brin has a
 birch tree growing from it.           
  The land was once covered with       
 forests of Caledonian pine.Wolves,    
 bears,wild boar and lynx as well as   
 the animals we see today lived among  
 the trees.They were hunted by the     
 lairds and the kings. Crofters grew   
 crops and kept stock on the fertile   
 land near the rivers even though they 
 flooded after heavy rain when the snow
 on the hills melted.This still happens
  Much of the croft land became heather
 covered moorland so grouse could be   
 raised for shooting.Some is still like
 this but three forestry groups are    
 replanting the hillsides with conifers</content>
