		<title>15MILTON CHILDREN'S GAMES.</title>
		<content> For recreation in Milton we play      
 games.A favourite game at school is   
{High Tig.}We stand on the small wall  
 and one child stands in front.He is   
 'het',and he has to try to'tig'us when
 we jump off the wall to run to a den  
 and back.If he tigs you, you go 'het'.
    A game at the park is{Knockout.}A  
 person with a ball tries to hit his   
 friend who is on the swing,and if he  
 succeeds,they change places.          
   {Hide and Seek}is a good game round 
 the village.One person,facing a wall, 
 hides his eyes and counts to 50,while 
 others hide behind gates and hedges,in
 old buildings or in trees and bushes. 
 The counter goes to find each person  
 but they try to reach his wall before 
 he returns.If they succeed,he has to  
 be 'het' again.This game is even more 
 fun in the evenings when it is getting
 dark.                                 </content>
