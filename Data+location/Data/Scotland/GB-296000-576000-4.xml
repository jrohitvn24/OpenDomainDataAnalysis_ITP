		<content>{LAYOUT OF CENTRE OF DUMFRIES          
 Dumfries is a typical market,town with
 a typical market town layout.The main 
 shopping area of the town is the large
 High Street in the centre of town     
 which contains a lot of major chain   
 department stores such as Marks &amp;     
 Spencers,Presto's,Boots, etc.         
 There are several car parks placed    
 just around the major shopping area   
 allowing customers to visit the major 
 stores without having to walk too far.
 Visiting these shops are thousands of 
 customers crossing the High Street    
 many times a day while all the time   
 there is a constant flow of traffic   
 travelling up and down.It is because  
 of all these vehicles and the huge    
 number of shoppers;it has now been    
 proposed to pedestrianise the High    
 Street.
