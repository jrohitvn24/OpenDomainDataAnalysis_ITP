		<content> This block is divided by the A702 from
 Edinburgh to Biggar - Dumfries and the
 south, a road not built for the heavy 
 traffic it has to carry. The Candy    
 Burn flowing on the eastern side of   
 the road is the boundary between      
 Tweedale district of Borders region   
 and Clydesdale district in            
 Strathclyde. The larger centre of     
 population is Skirling (Skravelyn) in 
 the south east Tweedale with the small
 hamlet of Candymill in the north in   
 Clydesdale. The name derives from the 
 former Edmonster meal mill now made   
 into a fine residence. The nearby     
 Edmonster House is still also a family
 home. Shirling House, a fairly recent 
 half-timbered country mansion where   
 the Laird (squire) has died, is being 
 sold with the remains of the once     
 large Skirling Estate. It stands      
 beside the lovely village green.      </content>
