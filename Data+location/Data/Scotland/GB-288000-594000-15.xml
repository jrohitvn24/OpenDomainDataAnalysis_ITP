		<title>15Games for Young Children.</title>
		<content> The youngest   children  in   the     
 school picked  two  games   in a box  
 they like snakes and ladders and      
 Scrabble. Snakes and ladders is played
 on a board which has boxes numbered   
 from 1 to 100.The board has pictures  
 on it with  "Snakes" and "Ladders"    
 every so often.Each player takes a    
 turn to move a counter along the      
 squares after throwing a dice.If the  
 player lands on a square which is at  
 the bottom of the ladder he climbs to 
 the top of the ladder for his turn.If 
 he lands on a square with a snakes    
 head in it,he has to slide down to the
 bottom of the snake. Play goes on like
 this and the winner is the first      
 person to arrive at 100.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
