  Greenloaning is a small village with 
 about 30 houses,10 farms,a hotel,a    
 Little Chef restaurant and a riding   
 school called The Scottish Equitation 
 Centre. There was, until recently, a  
 church but this has been converted    
 into a dwelling house. The main       
 railway line runs through the village 
 but the station closed several years  
 ago and these buildings too,have been 
 converted into a house.Close by is the
 River Allan a fine river for fishing. 
  Our school, Greenloaning Primary     
 School is situated just off the A9,   
 the main road to Perth and the North. 
 At the moment there are 33 pupils in  
 the school, 15 in the infant class    
 Primary1,2&amp;3,and 18 in Primary 4,5,6 &amp;
 7. There are only 2 classes .         
  Farming is the only industry in the  
 village, most people commute to work. </content>
