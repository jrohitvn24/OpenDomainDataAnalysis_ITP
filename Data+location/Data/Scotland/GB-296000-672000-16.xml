		<title>16Torphichen Gala Day</title>
		<content> Every year in Torphichen a            
 celebration takes place on the second 
 last Saturday of June. This is        
 Torphichen Gala Day which is the      
 culmination of a week of social       
 events. A girl, chosen from the 12-13 
 year olds, is crowned Queen of the    
 Gala Day. The Gala Day is a pageant   
 with the Queen and her attendants such
 as Flower Girls, Knights of St John   
 and Fairies taking part. During the   
 pageant invited guests are presented  
 to the Queen who then makes a speech  
 thanking everyone including the crowds
 that come to watch. Some people who   
 have children in the Gala Day decorate
 their house traditionally with spruce 
 branches and bunting, then the morning
 before the crowning ceremony the      
 houses are judged. The Queen presents 
 prizes for the best decorated house.
