		<content> Most people like fashion. Everybody   
 has a different taste of clothes. I am
 going to tell you about the things    
 people wear in our area. A man usually
 wears a shirt, jumper, trousers, belt,
 socks and shoes or boots. A lady wears
 a dress, skirt, blouse, jumper,       
 cardigan, necklaces and shoes.        
 Children are much the same. Boys wear 
 jeans, shorts, T-shirt, jacket, socks,
 trainers or shoes. Girls wear dresses,
 skirts, jumpers, cardigans, blouses,  
 T-shirts, shorts trainers or shoes.   
 Some people at school wear a school   
 uniform which for girls is skirt,     
 blouse, tie, cardigan, jumper, socks, 
 trainers or shoes. We all like        
 different clothes. What will we be    
 wearing in 900 years? We'll just have 
 to wait and see.
