		<title>01The Smaller Ascrib Islands</title>
		<content> The smaller Ascribs are a scatter of  
 reefs and skerries to the north-west  
 of the main island South Ascrib. Their
 Gaelic names give some idea of their  
 characteristics - Eilean Iosal, the   
 low mean island. Eilean Creagach, the 
 rocky island, Sgeir a Chuain, Ocean   
 reef, Eilean Garbh, rough stormy      
 island, Sgeir a Chapuill, Horse skerry
 maybe, perhaps because of its shape.  
 They are lichen-covered outcrops of   
 basalt, homes for seals and roosting- 
 places for seabirds, cormorants,      
 seagulls, eiderduck, inhospitable and 
 uninhabitable. Recently the Ascribs   
 were bought by a man from England who 
 tried to gain planning consent for a  
 house on South Ascrib. This was       
 refused.
