		<content> The church in Aberlour dates back to  
 600 A D, when the monk St. Drostan    
 founded a church there.               
 The present church is situated in The 
 Square and dates back to 1812.        
 It was gutted by fire in 1861, leaving
 only the belfry tower standing. Some  
 of the stones blackened by the fire   
 can still be seen in the North wall.  
 Since then, it has suffered two       
 outbreaks of dry rot, in 1932 and     
 again in 1983.                        
 It has three stained glass windows,   
 all designed by the same person.      
 In the old part of the graveyard, can 
 be seen the gable end of the earliest 
 church to serve the parish of         
 Aberlour.Set in the wall is one of the
 oldest legible stones dated 1664.     
 Buried in the graveyard is Hare, who  
 with his partner Burke were notorious 
 grave robbers in the early 19th.C.    </content>
