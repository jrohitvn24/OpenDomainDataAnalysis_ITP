		<content> contd from p 11     from Jemimaville  
 and towards the west at Balblair      
 Point. Eelgrass and glasswort cover   
 the sand and cord grass, which was    
 planted to help reclaim land, is      
 abundant on the mud and also the      
 saltings below Gordons Mills. Mussel  
 beds are extensive where the Newhall  
 Burn runs into the saltings. All this 
 provides ideal conditions for the     
 amount of birds to be seen here. Large
 flocks of wildfowl and waders winter  
 here and the saltmarsh is one of the  
 best places along the Cromarty Firth  
 for seeing large numbers of these     
 birds without leaving the car. Birds  
 that can be seen regularly are        
 mallard, geese, swans, oyster         
 catchers, lapwings, curlews and       
 redshanks.
