		<title>08EDUCATION IN THE BRAES</title>
		<content>   At one  time  there was a school for
 all the children in the district close
 to the Catholic  Church. With the fall
 in the number of chldren in  the area,
 it was decided to close the school and
 transfer all the  pupils to Tomintoul.
 A bus load of youngsters now leave the
 Braes at 8.15am  daily,  returning  at
 4.30pm, thus providing the only public
 transport.  Tomintoul  has  a  Primary
 department with three teachers for the
 different  age groups, and a Secondary
 department  which  covers all subjects
 but only until the child is 16. If the
 child wishes to  study  for highers he
 must transfer to Aberlour.  There  are
 Colleges of Further Education at Elgin
 or Inverness as well as Aberdeen which
 also sports a University.
