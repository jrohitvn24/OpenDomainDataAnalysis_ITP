		<title>12KNITTING ON WHALSAY</title>
		<content>  Shetland is famous for its Fair Isle 
 knitting,not only Fair Isle but other 
 parts as well,including Whalsay.      
 There is a knitwear factory on        
 Whalsay where 3 women knit jumpers    
 with Fair Isle patterns.They use      
 machines more than they hand knit.It  
 takes 4 hrs to machine knit a jumper, 
 about 25-30 hrs to hand knit one. They
 use Shetland yarn that comes from     
 Shetland sheep.Once washed jumpers    
 have to be stretched on a board made  
 of wood shaped like a jumper,if you   
 don't do this they will shrink.Fair   
 Isle patternedjumpers are made with   
 pattern all over or just at the       
 yoke.Prices (June 1985) for an adult  
 size Fair Isle jumper are :hand       
 knitted Â£30-40,machine knitted Â£25.   
  Many people knit at home selling to  
 knitwear shops in Lerwick.
