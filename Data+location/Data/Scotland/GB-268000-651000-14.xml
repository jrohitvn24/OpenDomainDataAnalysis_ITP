   Apart from the various voluntary    
 play-groups, one of the few local     
 authority nursery schools is situated 
 at Cadzow Bridge (Holland Bush).      
{PRIMARY}                              
   The area has two RC Primary         
 Schools with another just outside the 
 boundary. One non-denominational      
 school has recently been built in     
 Woodhead. The non-Catholic children   
 travel to school outside the area.    
{SECONDARY}                            
   There are no secondary schools in   
 the area. The children over primary   
 age have to travel some distances, the
 RC children split between John Ogilvie
 Blantyre and Holy Cross in Hamilton.  
 The non-denominational pupils split   
 between Earnock High and Hamilton     
 Grammar Schools.
