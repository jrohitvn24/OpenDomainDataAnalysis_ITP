		<content> I am a member of Queen's Park Bowling 
 and Tennis Club. It was founded in    
 1867 and has grown ever since.  Now in
 1985 it has approximately 200 members.
  There are 3 large bowling greens and 
 3 tennis courts.  The clubhouse has   
 lounges, bars, changing rooms etc and 
 the rules must be obeyed at all times.
    The tennis teams are entered in    
 some of the top tennis leagues in the 
 West of Scotland.  Coaching is        
 available for everyone from age 9     
 upwards, on a Saturday morning.  A    
 junior tennis member pays Â£14 for the 
 annual subscription.                  
    When I have finished playing tennis
 I go upstairs to the T.V lounge.  I   
 have been a member of the club for 3  
 years and I enjoy it immensely.
