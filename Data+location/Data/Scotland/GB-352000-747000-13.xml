		<content> The village is a favourite with       
 visitors from Dundee and other towns  
 around for short afternoon outings    
 especially at the weekend.            
 At the Craft Shop they browse among   
 shelves loaded with materials for     
 almost any form of Art or Craft or    
 they enjoy coffee and homebaking in   
 the Coffee Shop.                      
 Across the road at Henderson's market 
 garden they buy bedding and greenhouse
 plants or tomatoes in season.         
 The Craft Shop &amp; Henderson's are so   
 popular parked cars cause traffic     
 problems at the north end of the      
 village.                              
 Whittons Emporium has a large select- 
 ion of new and second hand furniture  
 while in the Square among Blackstocks 
 second hand goods visitors hope to    
 spot a bargain antique.
