		<content> Gilmerton is positioned on either side
 of the A85 which runs through Crieff  
 to Perth.  There are, altogether,     
 three roads which lead into the       
 village from the surrounding area.    
 There is no petrol station in         
 Gilmerton and so the villagers must   
 travel to Crieff for petrol.  Many    
 farmers in the area have their own    
 pumps which decreases their travelling
 expenses.  The majority of the housing
 is on the north side of the A85 and   
 difficulties are experienced by the   
 old and the young in crossing the road
 to get to the bus or go to the Post   
 Office as there is no crossing.  If a 
 crossing was developed the danger     
 would be greatly reduced.
