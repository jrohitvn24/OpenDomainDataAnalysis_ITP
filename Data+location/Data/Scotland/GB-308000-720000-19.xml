 and  I am  the Under 16 boys' singles 
 champion there.I{started playing}when 
 I  was {8 years old. }I  had my first 
 Tennis lessons from the S.L.T.A.,then 
 I got through to special{Winter coach-
{ing}with Douglas Gibson{(S.L.T.A.).   
  I practice about six nights a week.I 
 have been to {Largs in Inverclyde}for 
 sifting to see if I could be in the   
 boys Under 12{Scottish Squad.         
  My other successes are being number  
 three seed in the{Perth and District  
 Tennis Tournament where I was beaten  
 in the  Quarter-Finals by the number  
 two seed.                             
  I own a Prince J/r Pro. and a Sondico
 Pro.Tennis racquet and a Prince bag.If
 I make the Scottish Squad, I hope that
 I might one day play on the Centre    
 Court at{Wimbledon.}By the way,{Steven
