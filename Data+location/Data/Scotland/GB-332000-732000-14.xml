		<title>14    CAMPERDOWN PARK</title>
		<content> To the North of Wester Gourdie        
 Industrial Estate there is Camperdown 
 Park.This park was named after the    
 Battle of Camperdown which took place 
 in 1797.The original imposing mansion 
 was built in the 1820's for Robert    
 Duncan, the son of Admiral Duncan who 
 was the victor of the battle.The house
 has seen many changes during its      
 lifetime.It is now a cafeteria, golf  
 shop and golf museum.                 
   The park consists of deciduous and  
 coniferous trees and is a popular     
 recreation area for the population of 
 Dundee.There is a renowned 18 hole    
 golf course which is open to the      
 public and tennis courts as well as a 
 much improved wildlife park which     
 houses all types of animals including 
 a bear,monkeys and Scottish wild cat. 
   There is also a nature trail which  
 the public can be guided around.      </content>
