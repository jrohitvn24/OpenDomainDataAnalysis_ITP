		<title>20EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Unemployment is a serious problem in  
 the Maybole area. As elsewhere,the    
 effects are most felt amongst the     
 young people in the community. There  
 was little awareness of local         
 facilities for the unemployed amongst 
 those contacted for this project.     
 Disillusionment on the part of the    
 young was matched by depression on the
 part of unemployed heads of families. 
 Even when another wage was coming into
 the household to supplement State     
 benefits, the total income was felt to
 be inadequate to meet their needs.    
 The community education service runs  
 various projects for the unemployed   
 liasing with government schemes. The  
 Speakers club provides a social       
 afternoon for the local unemployed.   
 Recent expansion of provision in      
 education allows unemployed adults to 
 attend local school courses.          </content>
