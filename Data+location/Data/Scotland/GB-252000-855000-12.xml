		<title>12The New Road</title>
		<content> There are still many,narrow,single    
 track roads,with passing places in    
 this area.However a new road is being 
 built at the moment which will greatly
 improve the communication with the    
 west of Scotland.It is being built    
 from Maryburgh to Moy Bridge and when 
 it is finished this will be the main  
 route to Ullapool,Gairloch and other  
 west coast villages.The road is being 
 built by Shanks,MacEwen,Engineers of  
 Perth.The completion date is set for  
 November,nineteen eighty five.This new
 road will link up with another new    
 stretch of road which was recently    
 built at Garve,and when complete will 
 greatly reduce the travelling time to 
 the west.This route is used greatly by
 fish lorries bringing the catches of  
 white fish from the west coast to the 
 markets and factories in the eastern  
 and central parts of the country.     </content>
