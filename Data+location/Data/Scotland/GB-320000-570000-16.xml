		<title>16Creca Village</title>
		<content> The village has one main street. Most 
 of the houses are re-conditioned old  
 cottages. There are two new houses.   
 There is a village hall, a telephone  
 box and a Post box. A small industrial
 estate lies to the east of the        
 village. There is a sawmill, pipe     
 factory, concrete manufacturers and a 
 garden centre. Most people in Creca   
 are employed at Chapel Cross Nuclear  
 Power station or are farmworkers.     
 There is a W.I. which uses the village
 hall. Beech Hill farm lies to the west
 of the village. It is a mixed stock   
 farm. Grass is cut for silage and a   
 little barley is grown for stock feed.
 Extensive drainage has been carried   
 out as the land ajoining Creca Moss is
 wet. Stock is mainly beef cattle and  
 breeding ewes.
