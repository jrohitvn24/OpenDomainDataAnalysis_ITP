		<title>12CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content> At Towerbank Primary School we carried
 out a survey of the pupils between 9  
 and 11 to find out the{most popular   
{playground games.}The six most popular
 games were:                           
                                       
 1.{Football.                          
 2.{"Helpy"}_ one person goes "he" and 
 as he catches people they also become 
 "he" and help him to catch the people 
 left.                                 
 3.{Hide and Seek}_ everybody hides and
 one person has to find them.          
 4.{"Dodgy"}_ this is played with a    
 ball and if it hits you then you are  
 out. Last man out is the winner.      
 5.{Tig}_ one person goes "he" and he  
 tries to catch someone else to make   
 him "he" in his place.                
 6.{British Bulldogs}_ a group of      
 people must get past one person or    
 more.                                 </content>
