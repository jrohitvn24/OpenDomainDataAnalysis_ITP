		<content>    THIS PART OF THE PARISH OF POLWARTH
 IS A WELL WOODED AREA OF GOOD FARMING 
 LAND, BORDERED ON THE NORTH WEST BY   
 GREENLAW MOOR WHICH, AT THE QUARRY OF 
 KYLE'S HILL RISES TO A HEIGHT OF      
 285 METRES.                           
    THE ANCIENT VILLAGE OF POLWARTH,   
 LYING HALF A MILE FROM POLWARTH KIRK, 
 ON THE A 6105 BETWEEN DUNS AND        
 GREENLAW, GAVE ITS NAME TO THE PEERAGE
 WHICH IS STILL EXTANT AND TO THE      
 THORN, IMMORTALIZED IN FOLKLORE, WHICH
 IS STILL IN EXISTENCE. NOW IT ONLY HAS
 THREE OCCUPIED HOUSES, THE MAIN CENTRE
 OF HABITATION BEING AT MARCHMONT AND  
 THE FARMS OF WOODHEADS AND SISTERPATH,
 APART FROM TWO MANSES AT POLWARTH     
 RHODES AND THE OLD POLWARTH MANSE AND 
 THE OLD MARCHMONT STATION.            
    THE LAND IS VERY FERTILE &amp; IS      
 WATERED BY A NUMBER OF BURNS &amp; SPRINGS
 &amp; BEARS A WIDE RANGE OF FLORA &amp; FAUNA.</content>
