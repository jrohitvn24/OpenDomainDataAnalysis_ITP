 Most families again owned a car, but  
 some did not.                         
   One question asked in our interview 
 was what did people do with their     
 leisure time. The answers varied from 
 person to person (ie.from bingo and/or
 the public house to involvement in the
 community centre or church groups).   
   The final question to be asked was  
 what annoyed people living in the     
 area and again there was a wide range 
 of answers. Anything from the         
 Government or Margaret Thatcher to    
 vandalism, and even pregnancy!!!
