		<title>14M/V RHOUMA,RHUM _ OTHER USES</title>
		<content> In addition to its use as a ferryboat,
 the Rhouma is also used for other     
 purposes.                             
                                       
 On occasions, she is used for bird    
 counts round the island cliffs, or to 
 bring home deer shot by the stalkers  
 on isolated stretches of the island.  
                                       
 There are times when she carries out  
 missions of mercy, taking sick or     
 injured persons to Mallaig, to go by  
 ambulance from there to Fort William. 
 She is also used for Coastguard search
 and rescue missions, or just to take  
 people, or the Doctor, or Vet from one
 island to another.                    
                                       
 So the Rhouma is the lifeline of this 
 island, and is also a link in the     
 chain of the Small Isles.
