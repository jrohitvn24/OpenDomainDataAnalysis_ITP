{                                      
{GRAPHIC ARTS :}JUST ONE HALF OF THE   
 SAMPLE WERE INTERESTED IN AND ACTIVE  
 IN PAINTING, DRAWING, ETC., AND MOSTLY
 TOOK PART IN IT AT HOME RATHER THAN IN
 A CLUB.                               
{SCULPTURE :}ONLY A QUARTER SHOWED ANY 
 INTEREST IN SCULPTURE AND ONLY 3% DID 
 ANY SCULPTING.                        
{HOBBIES :}TWO-THIRDS OF THE SAMPLE    
 USED ARTS AND CRAFTS AS A HOBBY FOR   
 PLEASURE RATHER THAN PROFIT.          
 OVERALL ARTS AND CRAFTS ARE ENCOURAGED
 IN OUR AREA WITH REGULAR DISPLAYS IN  
 PLACES SUCH AS THE TOWN CENTRE AND    
 COMMUNITY ESTABLISHMENTS. THE AREA IS 
 ALSO MADE ATTRACTIVE BY THE WIDESPREAD
 USE OF SCULPTURE, CARVING, ETC. ON    
 BOTH SMALL AND LARGE SCALES.          
                                       
                                       </content>
