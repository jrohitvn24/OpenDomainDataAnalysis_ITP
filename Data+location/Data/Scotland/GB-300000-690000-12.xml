		<title>12Local history of Saline Fife</title>
		<content> There is very little written in       
 history books about Saline. When it is
 referred to,it is named Saulyne,hence 
 the older villagers still use this    
 pronunciation. Saline is said to have 
 derived it's name from the Gaelic word
 meaning 'great' or 'big'. With the    
 'great' or 'big' thing locally being  
 Saline Hill,it is surmised that Saline
 is named after the hill.              
 The remains of Killernie Castle are to
 be found to the east of Saline. It is 
 thought that travelling monks may have
 used the Castle with it's proximity to
 a spring.                             
 Amenities in general have improved in 
 Saline over the years,but maps dated  
 1853 show Saline to have had in those 
 days a reading room,a cricket ground  
 and a Police Station. These amenities 
 are no longer in Saline.
