		<content> As has been shown (p.6),the people    
 of LINDEAN include a large admixture  
 (40%) of immigrants,mostly either     
 native English or"English-spoken".    
 Their vocabulary ,speech-patterns and 
 -above all else-pronunciation have so 
 completely supplanted the traditional 
 features of the local dialect that the
 local newspaper has for several years 
 published a weekly article by a native
 Borderer on dialect words that have   
 vanished from daily use and have      
 become "dictionary words". Limitation 
 of space prevent illustration of local
 speech except by quotation from a     
 printed source: an extract from a     
 fictitious verse epistle supposed to  
 have been written by an exiled        
 Borderer to a boyhood friend "at home"
 .The author,James Brown,better known  
 as "J.B.Selkirk",lived at Lindean.
