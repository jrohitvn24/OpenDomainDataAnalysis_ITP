		<content>   Unlike the cities,in the Carnoustie 
 area there are not many places where  
 people can pass their spare time.     
 There are no night-clubs,no cinemas,  
 no theatre, no ice-rink,no rollerama, 
 no swimming.                          
   There are many golf clubs in        
 Carnoustie and besides golf meetings  
 there are often social events         
 organized for members and their       
 guests.The{Carnoustie Golf Club}holds 
 about 14 dances each year and around  
 100 people attend each one.Each       
 evening members can use the bars      
 within the club.There are two _ one   
 for men only and one for men and      
 women.                                
   The{"19th Hole"}is one of several   
 Carnoustie pubs.About 120 people come 
 in every day.The most popular drink   
 there is lager.Sometimes on special   
 nights the pub has little parties.    </content>
