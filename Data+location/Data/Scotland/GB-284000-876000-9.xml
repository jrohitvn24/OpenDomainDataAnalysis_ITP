		<content> The church building in our block      
 belongs to the Free Church It was     
 built in 1898 when the Free Church    
 broke away from the established       
 church. Most of the people of Hilton  
 joined the Free Church and the Ashvale
 Rd was much used as was all the other 
 rights of way to the church in the    
 middle of the parish. It was built to 
 seat about 800 but by 1979  the       
 numbers attending were so small that  
 maintaining and heating the building  
 was difficult. Also the distribution  
 of the congregation had changed with  
 the great bulk now in the Seaboard    
 villages. A small building was erected
 in Hilton in 1979 with seating for    
 about 120. Until recently the Church  
 of Scotland, the Free Church, the     
 United Free and the Free Presbyterian 
 church were the only denominations but
 now there are great changes           </content>
