		<title>14SOCIAL SURVEY</title>
		<content>    From our social survey we found    
 that a lot of people would like a     
 by-pass.A by-pass would take a lot of 
 the heavy traffic out of the main     
 street(see page 15)                   
   A lot of people would like to see   
 more shops in West Calder such as     
 clothes shops,toy shops,freezer shops,
 shoe shops and a stationer.           
   The average time people have lived  
 in this area is 13 years.             
   Quite a lot of people use the       
 library.Over 50% use the bus service  
 but out of the people we interviewed  
 hardly anyone ever used the train     
 service.                              
   It seems that people in this area   
 dont think there is enough facilities 
 for the young to use.So they said they
 wanted a leisure centre ,tennis courts
 and more playgrounds for young        
 children.                             </content>
