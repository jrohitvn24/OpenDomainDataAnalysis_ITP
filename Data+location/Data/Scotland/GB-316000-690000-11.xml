		<title>11Trade in Cowdenbeath</title>
		<content>   In Cowdenbeath a survey was taken to
 find out about trade. 8/10            
 shopowners said that their busiest    
 time of the day was before lunch-time.
 The others either said that their     
 busiest time was was lunch-time or    
 later.  9/10 shopowners said their    
 busiest day of the week was Saturday. 
 Others said their busiest day was     
 Monday.  None of the shops surveyed   
 said that they were bothered by       
 shoplifting.                          
   Most shoppers said that they shopped
 every day of the week, but some around
 twice a week.  They also mostly       
 shopped in the mornings, but some     
 shopped in the afternoon.  Most       
 shoppers did not only shop in         
 Cowdenbeath but regularly journeyed to
 Dunfermline, Edinburgh and Kirkcaldy. 
 The average shopper's age is 40/45.
