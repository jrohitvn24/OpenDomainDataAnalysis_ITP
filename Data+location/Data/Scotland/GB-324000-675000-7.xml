		<title>07LEITH - REDEVELOPMENT?</title>
		<content>  The solution to Leith's problems has 
 been found in redevelopment.  This has
 been devised to suit the needs of the 
 20th century industry, commerce and   
 housing.                              
 The District Council policy towards   
 this is one of redeveloping existing  
 properties, rather than demolition and
 rebuilding.  The redevelopment is     
 being carried out by both the public  
 and private sectors. The public sector
 is financed by central government and 
 their agencies, such as the Scottish  
 Development Agency which deals with   
 general redevelopment; the Scottish   
 Special Housing Association has built 
 homes in Leith.  The Port of Leith    
 Housing Association has used          
 government grants and loans over the  
 last 10 years to invest, by the end of
 1984 over Â£12 million into housing for
 Leith.                                </content>
