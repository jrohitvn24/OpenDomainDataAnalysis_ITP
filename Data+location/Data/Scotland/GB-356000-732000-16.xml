		<title>16Popular Pets</title>
		<content>   Dalhousie Street and Holyrood Street
 were chosen as guides to find which is
 the most popular pet within our area. 
 These streets were chosen because one 
 street has big gardens and the other  
 has smaller gardens.It was thought    
 that whether or not pets were kept    
 would depend on the size of the       
 garden.These are the results:         
                                       
{DOGS           CATS       RABBITS     
  22             14         4

   Fish was the most popular pet       
 perhaps because they are easy to keep 
 and don't need to be taken for walks. 
 More dogs were kept in the houses     
 which have big gardens and often      
 several dogs were kept in one of them.</content>
