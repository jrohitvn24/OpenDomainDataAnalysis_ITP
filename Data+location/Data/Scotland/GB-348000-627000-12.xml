		<title>12THE RIG</title>

 The rig is used each year on the      
 afternoon of the Common riding as a   
 horse racing course. Many of the      
 horses which have taken part in the   
 event of the morning are given an     
 opportunity to show their speed in the
 afternoon.  The local people walk or  
 drive up to the Rig having been up    
 since before the sound of the first   
 drum at six in the morning.           
 This year (1985) it had been hoped to 
 have a second race meeting but after  
 one of the wettest summers in living  
 memory the course had become too soft 
 to allow racing to take place.        
 The race course is a point to point   
 course and therefore is not very long.
