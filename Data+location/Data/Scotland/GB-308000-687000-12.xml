		<content> In our area of Dunfermline there are  
 many facilities provided to do with   
 health.  As a result of the increased 
 interest in health over the past      
 years, many groups such as yoga,      
 keep-fit and karate clubs have been   
 introduced.  Many of these clubs have 
 their sessions in the Carnegie Centre 
 which offers many sports and leisure  
 facilities to the citizens of the     
 town.                                 
    There are also many sports clubs   
 for physically and mentally           
 handicapped children and adults.      
 These include riding, swimming and    
 ball sports.                          
    The citizens of Dunfermline are    
 lucky enough to have the Carnegie     
 Clinic which offers many services from
 psychology to chiropody.  There are   
 four doctors' practices in our area   
 and nine dentists' surgeries.         </content>
