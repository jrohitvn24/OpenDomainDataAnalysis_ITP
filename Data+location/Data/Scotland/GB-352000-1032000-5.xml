		<title>05THE EDAY FREE STONE QUARRY</title>
		<content>    The free stone quarry was in use on
 the West Side for over 100 years.     
 People took stone out of the quarry   
 either for their own use or for export
 to other islands and the mainland of  
 Orkney.                               
    The quarry opens on to the shore so
 it was quite easy to get the stone to 
 the boats. The stone was taken out    
 with picks, put onto trolleys which   
 ran along tracks to the small jetty.  
 The stone that came out of the quarry 
 was red sandstone.                    
    The stone was used for building    
 purposes, much of the stone used in   
 the building of St. Magnus Cathedral  
 in Kirkwall was from Eday.            
    The quarry is no longer worked as  
 it became too expensive to transport  
 the stone to other islands.
