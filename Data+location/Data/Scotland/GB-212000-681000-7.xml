		<title>07THE FORESTRY COMMISSION.</title>
		<content>   The Forestry Commission was founded 
 in {1919}just after the First World   
 War. It was set up to replant the     
 forests that had been destroyed to    
 supply the demand for wood in the     
 years of the first World War.         
   In the 1950's this changed when the 
 Forestry Commission decided to try to 
 increase the amount of wood produced  
 in this country as {96% }was imported 
 from other countries. The aim of the  
 Forestry Commission is to produce {ALL
 the wood needed in this country and to
 get more jobs for the unemployed.     
   The Forestry Commission don't just  
 plant trees they make paths and walks 
 for people to look at and enjoy the   
 many forests.                         
   There are{18 branches}of the        
 Forestry Commission throughout the    
 whole of Scotland.{
