		<title>07REDFORD BARRACKS</title>
		<content>  Redford Barracks, in Colinton Road,  
 was built at the end of the nineteenth
 century. The barracks were supposed to
 be built in India, but due to lack of 
 space in Calcutta, were located in    
 Edinburgh. The grounds are closely    
 guarded, increasingly so with         
 terrorist threats against the army in 
 recent years.                         
  The Cavalry section houses the horses
 which are used on parade and the      
 Infantry section provides             
 accommodation for the soldiers. Within
 the barracks there is an education    
 centre, a Chapel, tennis and squash   
 courts, gym, shop, bar, canteen,      
 medical centre and space for 750      
 trucks. Soldiers perform regularily in
 their own pipe and military bands, and
 are a popular item at the annual      
 Edinburgh International Festival.
