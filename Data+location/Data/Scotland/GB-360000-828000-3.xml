		<content>  The crowning of the Gala Queen and   
 her attendants preceded the Gala      
 Concert on the Wednesday evening.     
 Entertainment included fiddle music,  
 recitations,songs,dances and comedy   
 sketches.Such a variety of local      
 talent kept the large audience happy. 
  The following evening there was a 5_ 
 a_side football competition and on    
 Friday evening there was a Fancy Dress
 Competition and parade with many      
 colourful and imaginative costumes on 
 display.This was followed by an Under 
 13 Disco in the Community Centre.     
  Saturday saw an Inter Village Sports 
 Competition where football,netball,   
 relays,sprints and sack races brought 
 out the competitive instincts in young
 and old alike.The Dunnydeer Hill Race 
 brought out some fit and not so fit   
 athletes and the hot sunny afternoon  
 didn't make the race any easier!      </content>
