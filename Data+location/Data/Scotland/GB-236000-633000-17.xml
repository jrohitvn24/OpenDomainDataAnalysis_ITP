		<title>17EDUCATION:HISTORY:DUNDONALD</title>
		<content>  There is only one school in the      
 village of Dundonald and this is the  
 local Primary school.                 
  The history of the school goes back a
 long way. In fact,the school was first
 mentioned in the Minutes of the Church
 Session on 9th June,1605 but there was
 no proper school building until around
 1634 when a school building was put up
 in the churchyard and the school was  
 known as the Parish School.           
  The school was housed in this        
 building until the beginning of the   
 19th century when it was knocked down 
 and a new one built, again close to   
 the church. This building is no longer
 the school but is still in use as a   
 Community Centre and is called the    
 Montgomerie Hall.                     
  The present school building was built
 in 1897 and has been added to at      
 various times as the need arose.      </content>
