		<title>17NAIRN:NURSERIES</title>
		<content> The Lodgehill nurseries were formed in
 1885.They are situated at the west end
 of the Lodgehill area of Nairn.The    
 former owner,Mr Ferguson,sold it to Mr
 B.P.Williamson in winter 1980.Since   
 then the Nurseries have thrived,tended
 by the five staff employed by Mr      
 Williamson.                           
 The Nurseries serve about 100         
 customers daily.The customers can buy 
 a variety of crops and garden         
 products.The most popular type of     
 plant are the bedding plants.         
 Although pressed for space,the        
 owners have managed to fit in 7       
 greenhouses and their own house.They  
 also have four acres of fields full of
 plants and vegetables,eg.potatoes,    
 carrots and turnips.The main problem  
 is the freezing winters which may kill
 certain plants.
