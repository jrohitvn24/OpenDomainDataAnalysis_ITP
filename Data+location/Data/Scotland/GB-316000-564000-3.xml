		<title>03A day in the life of Angela</title>
		<content> I am 10 years old and this is how I   
 normally spend{a Saturday}or a day    
 during the school holidays.           
    I get up at 7.00am and get changed.
 Next{I do my mother's bingo game}in   
 the newspaper, then clean out the     
 budgie's cage and{watch some TV.}I go 
 into the kitchen and make myself some 
 toast and eat it in the living_room.  
 When I have finished I brush my hair  
 and get my coat on and{go to the shops
 for my mother.                        
    After I have done{the shopping}I go
 to my gran's and we go out and{do her 
{shopping.}When we come back{I bake a  
{cake with her}and then we go into the 
 greenhouse and{plant some seeds.      
    In the evening I{watch television  
 until I go to bed.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
