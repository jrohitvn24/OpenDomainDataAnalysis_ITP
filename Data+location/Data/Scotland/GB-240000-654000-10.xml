		<title>10THE MURE HALL</title>
		<content>    Uplawmoor village is fortunate in  
 having a well-appointed village hall  
 which was presented to the village by 
 the Mure family in 1914.The original  
 building was enlarged with funds      
 raised locally and is now the focal   
 point of much village activity.       
    Throughout the year it is home to  
 the Scottish Women's Rural Institute, 
 the pre-school playgroup,a Child      
 Welfare clinic and meetings of the    
 Community,District and Regional       
 Councils.                             
    In winter badminton,carpet bowls   
 and bridge are played in it.          
    In addition there are dances,      
 parties,wedding receptions,concerts   
 and exhibitions.                      
    In summer it is used by visiting   
 schools or for the church fete.
