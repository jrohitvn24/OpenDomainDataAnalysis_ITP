		<title>17INVERURIE BY-PASS</title>
		<content> For many years a by-pass for Inverurie
 has been talked about. The town lies  
 on the main route from Aberdeen to    
 Inverness. This means that many       
 vehicles are driven through the town  
 at all times of the day and night. The
 streets in the burgh were not built   
 for such traffic and at busy times a  
 line of traffic stretches through the 
 town causing traffic jams. Heavy      
 lorries annoy the inhabitants.        
                                       
 A number of factors have led to the   
 delay in the construction of the      
 by-pass. Recently this has been due to
 people objecting to the route of the  
 by-pass. However, at last it seems    
 that the new route will soon be built.
 It is hoped to commence work in April,
 1987. The estimated cost is 6.2       
 million pounds and it will be 5 miles 
 long.                                 </content>
