		<title>12Changing Times In Sorbie</title>
		<content>    During the years,{improvements}have
 been made in the old houses of Sorbie.
 They were renovated and had both      
 running water and electricity         
 installed.Once,there was an outbreak  
 of scarlet fever,but the people were  
 not seriously ill.As well as there    
 being a creamery,there  were grain    
 mills and  small damask{industries}.  
    In the 17th and 18th centuries 2   
 churches were built. The reason for   
 this was that because 100 years ago,5 
 times more people lived in Sorbie than
 today.                                
    In the 1960's the loacl {railway}  
 station was closed down.This was      
 caused by economimc reasons and       
 insufficcent travellers.Sorbie has    
 always been a centre of {agriculture} 
 and allied industries and because of  
 this the inhabitants are proud of     
 their village.                        </content>
