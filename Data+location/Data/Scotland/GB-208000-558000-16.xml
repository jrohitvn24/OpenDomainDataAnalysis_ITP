		<content> We play tig,football,houses,chase and 
 races. Skipping is popular,three games
 are,'I had a little bumper car,number 
 48,whizzed me round the corner police 
 caught me put me in jail how many     
 bottles of ginger ale' and 'Cowboy Joe
 from Mexico went to ride on a rodeo,  
 hands up stick em up drop your guns   
 and pick em up. O.U.T spells out' and 
 'Wibble wobble wibble wobble jelly on 
 a plate'. We play ball games such as  
 Ali ba ba. The rhyme is 'Ali ba ba    
 who's got the ball, is he big or is he
 small, has he whiskers on his chin,   
 Ali ba ba who's got the ball'. Another
 one is Plainy Clappy. You throw a ball
 at a wall, sing the rhyme and do the  
 actions. The rhyme is 'Plainy, Clappy,
 roll the wheels, tabacky,right hand,  
 left hand, right leg, left leg, touch 
 your toe, touch your heel, touch the  
 ground and burl around'               </content>
