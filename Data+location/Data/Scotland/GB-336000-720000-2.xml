		<content> In our area there is only one main    
 road,the A914,connecting Dundee and   
 Kirkcaldy with lots of B roads        
 adjoining it.Because of the very small
 population the service bus only passes
 twice a day on Tuesdays,Thursdays and 
 Saturdays and therefore most people   
 have cars.Cars are used as the B roads
 are very hilly and the A road is very 
 busy and therefore not suitable for   
 bikes.Children in this area are taken 
 to and from school by contract        
 buses.Our school has one mini-bus     
 hired by the region which brings us   
 all to school but bigger buses also   
 come down the A914 taking children to 
 the senior school,Bell-Baxter,in      
 Cupar.Apart from the service buses you
 can also get to town with the post bus
 which doesn't run on Sundays and      
 public holidays.This service can only 
 take few people as space is limited.  </content>
