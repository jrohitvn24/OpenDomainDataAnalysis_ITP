		<content> EVERY YAER AT CHRISTMAS TIME WE PUT ON
 A SCHOOL CONCERT. IT IS LOTS OF FUN   
 BUT IT IS HARD WORK. OUR MUMS MAKE THE
 COSTUMES AND HELP WITH THE SCENERY.   
 THE OLDER CHILDREN GENERALLY DO A     
 MUSICAL PLAY OR A PANTOMIME, WHILE THE
 YOUNGER ONES SING SONGS AND ACT OUT   
 NURSERY RHYMES. WE HAVE A CHOIR TOO.  
 THE CONCERT THIS YEAR WAS HELD IN THE 
 VILLAGE HALL AND PERFORMED IN THE     
 EVENING. IT IS ONE OF THE FEW TIMES   
 EVERYONE IN THE VILLAGE CAN GET       
 TOGETHER AND HAVE A GOOD TIME. AFTER  
 WE HAVE PERFORMED, THERE ARE BRING AND
 BUY STALLS. OUR MUMS AND FRIENDS HELP 
 US TO MAKE THINGS THAT ARE SUITABLE   
 AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS AND DECORATIONS AS 
 WELL AS HOME-MADE CANDY AND CAKES. WE 
 ALSO SELL OLD BOOKS AND JUMBLE. THERE 
 IS ALWAYS A RAFFLE. THERE ARE LOVELY  
 PRIZES. OTHER WAYS OF MAKING MONEY ARE
 GUESSING THE WEIGHT OF THE CAKE.      </content>
