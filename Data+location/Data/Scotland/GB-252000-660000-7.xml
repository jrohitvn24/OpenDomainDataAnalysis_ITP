		<title>07H20 POLLUTION SURVEY GLASGOW</title>
		<content>                                       
 On Monday the l3th of May l985 we left
 the school at 9.45 a.m. with Steve and
 Gerry (Countryside Rangers from Pollok
 Park) and we made our way to the      
 Levern Water.  We were going to study 
 the animal life and the level of      
 pollution.  We were separated into    
 nine groups of three.  Each group had 
 a large and small net, a tub and a    
 nature viewer.  The class managed to  
 catch a lot;  - Water louse, Sludge   
 worms, pondskaters, silver diving     
 beetles, sticklebacks, leeches,       
 snails, water mites, water boatmen,   
 frogs, blood worms, and snails eggs.  
 The level of pollution was C which is 
 quite polluted.  The possible causes  
 of pollution in the water were oil,   
 sewage, plastic, footballs, iron and  
 rust.
