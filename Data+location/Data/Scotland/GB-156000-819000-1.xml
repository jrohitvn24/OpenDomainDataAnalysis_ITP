 A fair percentage of this block       
 consists of uncultivated moor and hill
 grazing, but Kilbride has been fenced 
 and has some cultivation; while the   
 crofting township of Torrin consists  
 of 18 crofts and a few other houses,  
 here most of the land is fenced and   
 cultivated on a subsistence level.    
 Most of the houses are occupied but   
 the crofters have to go to Broadford, 
 7 miles away for school, shops,       
 medical treatment, entertainment etc. 
 The main occupation is crofting,      
 (sheep, cattle and their feed) with   
 some tourism and a little forestry    
 (Forestry Commission).  There is a    
 lime quarry (2) and marble quarry (7) 
 employing in all 15 men.  A fish farm 
 has been started (1,5) salmon rearing 
 tanks in the sea, and offices etc, at 
 Faoilean, at present employing 5 men. </content>
