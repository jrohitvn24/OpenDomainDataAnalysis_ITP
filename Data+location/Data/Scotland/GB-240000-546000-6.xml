		<content>     There are many things for people  
 who live in the Sorbie area, to do in 
 their spare time. Some of the older   
 people enjoy going for walks in       
 Kilsture forest, following the trail. 
 This is also an attraction for{       
{tourism}.                             
    In the summer, the outdoor{bowling 
{green}is open for anyone to join. It  
 costs Â£10 for seniors and Â£5 for      
 juniors.It has about 60 members this  
 year. When the bowling green is closed
 in the autumn, indoor bowling is held 
 in the village hall on Monday and     
 Wednesday evenings.                   
    For children there is a{swing park}
 which is used a lot, but television   
 takes its place when it rains. Some   
 people go to either Wigtown or        
 Whithorn to play bingo. The{village   
{hall}provides accomodation for indoor 
 football, badminton, clubs and discos.</content>
