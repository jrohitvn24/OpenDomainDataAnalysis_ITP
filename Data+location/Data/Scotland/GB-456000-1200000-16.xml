		<title>16Bird-watching in Uyeasound.</title>
		<content> There are many birds around Uyeasound.
 I like black-headed gulls because of  
 the way they fly and starlings because
 the light shows lots of colours on    
 their feathers.                       
   When we need to find out about birds
 we go and see a keen ornithologist in 
 Uyeasound.He has been interested in   
 birds for 15 years because he likes   
 nature.He is in the Shetland Bird Club
 and is interested in all birds.The    
 rarest bird he's seen in Uyeasound    
 this year is a bluethroat.If he can   
 get near enough he takes photos of the
 birds.He is sometimes involved in bird
 counts.In the winter of 1984/5 he     
 counted all the waders and eiders     
 along a stretch of coastline in       
 Uyeasound and Belmont,one hour after  
 low tide.He sent the census figures to
 the British Trust of Ornithologists.
