     Sometimes we say " di ya ken " ,  
 which means DO YOU KNOW; or " gi me   
 twa ", for GIVE ME TWO. Sometimes     
 Robert Oliver says " It's inalow the  
 desk " meaning IT'S BENEATH THE DESK. 
 If someone is eating sweets and offers
 you " yin " they are asking if you    
 want ONE; their " dug " is their DOG  
 just as their " coo " is their COW.   
     Sometimes people will build a high
 " wa ", or WALL, to " kep oot ",      
 meaning KEEP OUT, other " kyes or     
 beasts ", again being COWS. But these 
 " ana " ARE NOT " ah " ALL the Scots  
 words we use " cos " BECAUSE we say " 
 fitba " for FOOTBALL and " nicht " for
 NIGHT; while a person who is very     
 solemn or serious is sayed to be " an 
 awfy dour biddy ". Sometimes we forget
 when we are doing our reading and we  
 use a Scots word. Our teacher laughs. </content>
