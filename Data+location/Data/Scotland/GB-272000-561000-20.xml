		<title>20Threave Rovers Football Club</title>
		<content> Threave Rovers Football Club was      
 founded in the 1950's. An extension   
 was built onto the club house in 1973.
 The club was built to foster football 
 in Castle Douglas and the South of    
 Scotland. Threave Rovers have won     
 three cups in the last three years.   
 Mr David McLean is chairman and has   
 been for ten years. Ian Bendall is the
 Manager and Eric Houston is the       
 Secretary. There are about 16 players.
 The football pitch has always been    
 where it is at the bottom of Castle   
 Douglas across from the Scout Hall and
 beside the Ambulance Station.         
 Threave Rovers have appeared twice in 
 the Scottish Cup. They have also      
 played in the final of the Western    
 Amateur Cup.
