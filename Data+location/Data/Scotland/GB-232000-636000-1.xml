		<title>01IRVINE NEW TOWN S.E. AREA</title>
		<content>{  Dreghorn,}our village, is situated  
 near the south west coast of Scotland.
 It is part of{Irvine New Town,}the    
 only coastal new town in Britain.     
 Irvine was designated a new town site 
 in 1966.                              
{The land}in our area is mainly flat   
 with a few small hills.There are two  
 rivers flowing through the area, the  
{Irvine}and its tributary the{Annick.} 
 These rivers join together just       
 outside the town of Irvine, and flow  
 through the town to join the sea in   
 the{Firth of Clyde.                   
 As the new town has grown since 1966, 
 the population has increased from     
 thirty thousand to around sixty       
 thousand. New houses have been built  
 all around Dreghorn, as have new      
{industrial estates.}Recently, however,
 many of the factories have closed,    
 creating many unemployed.             </content>
