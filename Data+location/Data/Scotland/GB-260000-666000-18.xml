 1985.On 19th Dec.1984 the congregation
 entered the 3rd church building during
 that time.The first was in Tharsis St.

 by proposed realignment of Springburn 
 Rd.Repairs had not been done and it   
 was abandoned.Vandals set it on fire. 
 The congregation met in a school until
 the opening of the new church,the only
 centrally funded church built by the  
 Church of Scotland in 1984.From the   
 Rev.D.Forrest,the 1st minister in 1885
