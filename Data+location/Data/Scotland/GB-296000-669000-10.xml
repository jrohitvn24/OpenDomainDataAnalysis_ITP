		<title>10Family Size Survey Bathgate</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
      Over the last year we have been  
 doing street surveys in the Bathgate  
 area.   The survey we did was on      
 family size.   We decided to use 60   
 different houses in three different   
 areas of Bathgate.   We used one area 
 of old council houses, another area of
 old privately owned houses and the    
 last area of newer council houses.    
     Analysis of the results showed the
 three main groups covered in the      
 survey to be:-                        
 1.  Husband,wife with no children.    
 2.  Husband, wife with one child.     
 3.  Husband,wife with two children.   
 Surprisingly the highest of the three 
 groups was husband and wife with no   
 children, which had a total of 13     
 points, closely followed by husband   
 and wife with one child.              </content>
