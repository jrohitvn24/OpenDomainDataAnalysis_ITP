		<title>12Galloway News</title>
		<content> In July 1858 the Kirkcudbright        
 Advertiser now known as the Galloway  
 News was founded. The printers now in 
 Dumfries used to be in the Castle     
 Douglas office. They moved to make    
 more room. The Dumfries office employs
 55 people as well as 4 photographers  
 and 1 advertiser. The Galloway News   
 used to be owned by G Outram Ltd.     
 Each week the printers roll out about 
 8,500 copies. The paper covers mostly 
 the Stewartry District. The working   
 hours of the staff are from 9.00 am to
 5.00 pm. The old office is just a     
 couple of yards away from today's     
 office.
