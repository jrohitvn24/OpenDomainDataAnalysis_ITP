		<title>10LOCHGOILHEAD-TRANSPORT(1)</title>
		<content> Lochgoilhead's public transport is    
 limited to a bus service which runs to
 Arrochar Railway Station twice daily  
 to connect with the Glasgow train.It  
 also runs four times a day to{Carrick 
{Castle,}our neighbouring village,which
 stands,six miles away,at the head of  
 Loch Goil.The bus is used to convey   
 the primary school children from      
 Carrick Castle and the west side of   
 the loch to and from school.The bus   
 driver is Barry Cullen but is known to
 everyone as{Barry the Bus.}           
 Private car is the most common and    
 convenient form of transport. The     
 people are willing to pay,grudgingly  
 perhaps,over Â£2.25 per gallon for     
 petrol.The price of petrol is shared  
 by several people who group together  
 to go shopping in the large towns.    
 The cars are heavily laden with       
 groceries for several weeks.          </content>
