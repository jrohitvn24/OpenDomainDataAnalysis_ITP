		<title>19A Stalker's day in June</title>
		<content>{Most of the land in our block is owned
{by the Buccleuch Estates and the woods
{and the small bit of moor included are
{used for pheasant, grouse and deer    
{shooting. Here is the diary of Mr     
{William Bell, a Buccleuch Estates deer
{stalker for a typical day in June.    
{                                      
{4.30}Get up, check weather.If         
 fine and clear have cup of coffee,    
 toast whilst checking rifle,          
 ammunition,binoculars etc.Then proceed
 to ground we intend to stalk, as      
 planned previously. We must have      
 several options here,as it depends on 
 wind direction where we go,as deer    
 must always be stalked up wind. Whilst
 stalking we attempt to cull the old or
 weakly deer. We continue to stalk     
 until about 7.30_8am as by that time  
 most of the deer will have gone back  
 to thick cover.{Cont page 20}         </content>
