		<title>18PLANT LIFE ON WHALSAY</title>
		<content>  As Whalsay is at times subject to    
 severe weather with salt from the sea 
 in the air right across the island all
 plants have to be able to resist this.
  There are now no native trees on the 
 island,although evidence from peat    
 deposits shows that there used to be  
 varieties of willow and alder.        
  As much of the island is wet,acid    
 peat based soil mosses,grasses and    
 plants such as Bog Cotton,Common      
 Orchids and Butterwort thrive.In      
 sheltered places some ferns grow.On   
 drier areas vetches,thrift and sheeps 
 bit scabious are found.Over drier     
 areas of the hill there are amounts of
 heather.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
