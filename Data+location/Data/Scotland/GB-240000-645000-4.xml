 Secondary pupils in Stewarton moved   
 into the new Academy,a two-storeyed   
 building in the Robertland area on 5th
 June,1985.Mr Alan Barker, the         
 headteacher and his 65 staff now teach
 the 824 pupils from 1st to 6th Year in
 a modern,comfortable building instead 
 of the old building with its many     
 huts.Each group of subjects has the   
 rooms decorated with the same paint   
 and carpets.Among the facilities      
 are an ample library,a lecture theatre
 a gymnasium and a large games hall.The
 home economics,business               
 studies,art,computer studies,science  
 and technical departments are very    
 well equipped.Excellent meals and     
 snacks are provided in the dining     
 hall/cafeteria for the majority of the
 pupils.                               </content>
