		<title>07HOUSING-A CONTRAST</title>
		<content>    On one side of Parkhouse Road is   
 the built up area of South Nitshill . 
 There are lots of rented houses and   
 flats so many people live there .There
 are churches ,schools and some shops  
 and plenty of buses to serve the      
 residents .                           
    On the other side of the main road 
 and on an area which used to be all   
 fields you will find a new estate of  
 bought houses .How quiet it is here   
 overlooking green fields bordered by  
 hedges .We found no shops or schools  
 here in fact people have to own a car 
 to carry shopping and take their      
 children to school ."The place has    
 changed," said the farmer's wife at   
 Darnley Mill Farm which is at the     
 crossroads of busy Nitshill ,Parkhouse
  ,and Kennishead Road ."We have some  
 beef cattle and grow hay for the      
 Winter feeding on our farm still ."   </content>
