		<title>20A Day in the Life of Oscar</title>
		<content>   Oscar gets up in time to watch      
 Breakfast Television then he has his  
 breakfast of Frosties, milk and       
 coffee.                               
   At school he first reads a novel for
 half an hour then does maths. Next    
 comes atlas work.                     
   At playtime Oscar plays football    
 with his mates. The girls go in       
 huddles and talk. When he goes back to
 school he writes a poem. Then         
 everybody goes down to drama (Oscar   
 enjoys that).                         
   Now Oscar goes down to the dinner   
 hall. It's corned beef and potatoes.  
 Then he goes back to school and does  
 his project. Oscar is doing cooking.  
 Today it's Chinese Cooking.           
   When Oscar gets home, he settles    
 down to watch television. After tea he
 plays in the garden then he goes to   
 bed at 9.30p.m..                      </content>
