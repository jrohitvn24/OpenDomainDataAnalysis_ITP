		<content> Guardbridge is located in North East  
 Fife, at the head of the Eden Estuary,
 where the River Eden flows into the   
 sea.  It is a small village of 850    
 people and is surrounded by pleasantly
 rural countryside, containing several 
 large prosperous farms. Four miles to 
 the east lies the University town of  
 St Andrews, while north across the    
 Firth of Tay is the city of Dundee.   
 Guardbridge lies along the busy       
 routeway linking these two            
 settlements.  The village is dominated
 by a large and thriving paper mill    
 which is sited at the north of the    
 River Eden.  The water here is used in
 the paper making process and for the  
 disposal of waste products and is     
 therefore discoloured. The paper mill 
 is a major employer in the area.
