		<content> IN HUMBIE WE HAVE A VILLAGE HALL WHICH
 IS USED BY DIFFERENT GROUPS.SEVERAL   
 YEARS AGO THE VILLAGE HAD AN OLD HALL 
 AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT A NEW ONE     
 SHOULD BE BUILT.THE VILLAGERS HAD TO  
 RAISE LOTS OF MONEY FOR THIS AND MANY 
 FUND RAISING ACTIVITIES WERE HELD.THE 
 NEW HALL WAS BUILT TWELVE YEARS AGO ON
 GROUND NEXT TO THE SCHOOL AND WHEN IT 
 WAS FINISHED A SPECIAL CONCERT WAS    
 HELD.EVERYBODY TOOK PART.OUR HALL IS  
 USED REGULARLY AND WE DO GYM LESSONS  
 THERE.IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THERE 
 IS A FACILITY LIKE THIS IN A SCATTERED
 COMMUNITY LIKE OURS.
