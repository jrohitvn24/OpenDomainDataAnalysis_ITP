 Kirkpatrick Fleming village is named  
 after the Church, dedicated to St.    
 Patrick around 1190. The present Kirk 
 was built in 1733, and renovated in   
 1892. Seven  defensive peel-towers    
 were built by the Irving clan along   
 the Kirtle Water, at Kirkconnel,      
 Blackethouse, Bonshaw, Woodhouse,     
 Robgill, Stapleton and Cove. Bonshaw  
 Tower was the finest and earliest,    
 built originally around 1100.It was   
 clan home of the Irvings, and the old 
 clan bell still remains to summon the 
 clan in times of danger.Near the ruin 
 of Cove House is the cave, made by    
 prehistoric men standing on a         
 long-melted ledge of ice, where King  
 Robert the Bruce traditionally hid and
 saw the spider before Bannockburn.
