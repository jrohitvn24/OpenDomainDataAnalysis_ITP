		<title>16ALEXANDER MORTON - SAWMILL</title>
		<content> In Rumblingwell,near our school there 
 is a sawmill which is one hundred and 
 fifty years old.It employs fifty three
 people.                               
 The sawmill was modernised with new   
 buildings and machinery about         
 twenty-five years ago.A guard dog has 
 recently been acquired to prevent     
 theft.                                
 Different kinds of wood are           
 used-Hardwood such as Mahogany and    
 Ash and Softwood such as  Spruce and  
 Redwoods.                             
 The woods come from many different    
 countries-Finland,Sweden and Canada.  
 Alexander Morton sells wood to both   
 manufacturers and the general public  
 but do not make anything from the wood
 they buy and sell.The wood is cut into
 various sizes depending on the        
 customers' needs.Their busiest time   
 of year is Spring/Summer.             </content>
