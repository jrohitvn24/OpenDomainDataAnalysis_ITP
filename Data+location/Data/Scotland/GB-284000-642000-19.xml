		<title>19Bonnington Power Station</title>
		<content> Bonnington Power Station is one of the
 oldest power stations in Scotland and 
 was built in 1926. It is driven by the
 Bonnington Falls on the River Clyde   
 which makes it a hydro-electric power 
 station. The station is automatic but 
 six men keep it clean, working from   
 8a.m. to 4.30p.m. A man called John   
 Day who has worked there for 42 years 
 showed us the two turbines. The water 
 comes from a mile up the Clyde through
 two big green pipes to drive the      
 turbines. The falls have a drop of 190
 ft and four times a year the power is 
 switched off and the falls are open to
 the public. No back-up fuel is used   
 and the power produced is fed into the
 national grid.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
