		<title>18GAELIC LANGUAGE</title>
		<content> AT ONE TIME THE LANGUAGE OF THE PEOPLE
 OF RAASAY WAS THE GAELIC. HOWEVER WITH
 MANY PEOPLE LEAVING THE ISLAND AND    
 MARRYING NON GAELIC SPEAKERS AND      
 INCOMERS MOVING TO RAASAY, GAELIC HAS 
 BEEN REPLACED BY ENGLISH ALTHOUGH MANY
 OF THE OLDER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY 
 STILL CONVERSE IN GAELIC.             
 GAELIC IS NOW MAKING A COME-BACK AND  
 IS NOW BEING TAUGHT IN SCHOOL. RAASAY 
 SCHOOL IS ONE OF THE SCHOOLS IN THE   
 BI-LINGUAL PROJECT.                   
 IT IS NICE TO LISTEN TO SONGS AND     
 POEMS SUNG OR SPOKEN IN GAELIC.
