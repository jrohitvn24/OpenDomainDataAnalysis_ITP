  Our area is a conservation area and  
 all new buildings have to conform by  
 using local stone and pantiles.       
 Architects and builders buy houses and
 modernise them.Sometimes they live in 
 them and sometimes they sell them.    
  Several years ago there were quite a 
 high proportion of holiday homes but  
 now there are very few.               
  Two years ago a resident broke the   
 conservation rules by installing solar
 panels.This caused a furore,attracting
 the attention of the national as well 
 as the local press and they were      
 subsequently removed.                 
  We think that the housing in this    
 area is particularily attractive and  
 we enjoy living in them.
