		<title>04VILLAGE LIFE-OLD KILPATRICK</title>
		<content> The people of Old Kilpatrick were     
 asked to give their opinions on       
 certain aspects of village life.      
                                       
 Most villagers agreed that it         
 was a{lovely, peaceful, friendly      
 place to live, but feel that the      
{picturesque}look of the village is    
 spoiled by the massive support pillars
 of the Erskine Bridge.                
                                       
 In recent years the village has       
{expanded}with more council houses     
 being built and the proposed          
 construction in 1986 of 700 private   
 houses, will enlarge it even further. 
                                       
 The residents are{afraid}that through 
 this rapid expansion Old Kilpatrick   
 may lose its{close knit community     
{atmosphere.                           
 .                                     </content>
