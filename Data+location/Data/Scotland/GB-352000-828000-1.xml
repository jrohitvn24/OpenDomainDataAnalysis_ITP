		<title>01Kennethmont:An Introduction</title>
		<content> About 8 miles from Huntly on the      
 B.9002 and on the Inverness/Aberdeen  
 railway line lies the small rural     
 village of Kennethmont (popn 470      
 approx).The village streches along the
 main road for about a mile,although   
 population is most concentrated at two
 centres,"Kirkhill"at the western end, 
 and around Ardmore Distillery at the  
 eastern end.Halfway between these two 
 population centres lie the playing    
 fields,the Rannes Hall,the school and 
 the church. The National Trust For    
 Scotland owns considerable property to
 the north of Kennethmont,including    
 Leith Hall built in 1649. In this     
 predominantly agricultural area most  
 jobs are associated with farming.     
 Other employment is provided by a shop
 ,a Post Office,a garage,the school,the
 pub,a coal merchant's business and by 
 the local whisky distillery .         </content>
