		<title>03THE SCALAN IN THE BRAES</title>
		<content>   High up in the hills from  where any
 intruder can easily be spotted,  there
 is the former seminary of the Scalan. 
   In  1712  Bishop  Gordon  chose  the
 Scalan  to  build a college where boys
 could train  as  missionaries.  It was
 the only  training  place  in Scotland
 for students to the priesthood at that
 time. The original building was mostly
 of turf  and  could  accomodate  eight
 students, but after  being  raided and
 burned to the ground on four occasions
 between  1717 and 1746  it was rebuilt
 and  improved.  After  the  Battle  of
 Culloden the College was left in peace
 and  over  the  years  more  than  100
 priests  and 2 bishops were  ordained.
 In 1799 the  Bishop and students  left
 the Scalan to set up a  new college in
 Aberdeenshire.  Today the building  is
 preserved  by the  Scalan  Association
 and is visited by many people.        </content>
