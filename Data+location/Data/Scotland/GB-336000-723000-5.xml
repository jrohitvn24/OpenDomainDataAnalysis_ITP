		<content> The main Edinburgh to Aberdeen railway
 line passes through the area as it    
 approaches Wormit.The station in      
 Wormit was closed in 1969 and recently
 a committee has been formed to assess 
 public interest in a proposed new     
 station at Wormit.At a public meeting 
 in June 1985 it was stated that Fife  
 Region is to carry out a comprehensive
 survey later in the year to discover  
 who would use the station.The region  
 hopes that it would tempt car         
 travellers to use public transport    
 instead.The facilities proposed at an 
 estimated cost of Â£150 000 would cover
 two,six coach_length platforms,a      
 footbridge,shelters and a car         
 park.Tickets would be issued by an    
 autoslot machine.
