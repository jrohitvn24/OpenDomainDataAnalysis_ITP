		<title>12LAND COVER AROUND DALMALLY</title>
		<content> Land cover around this area is mostly 
 grass or trees, buildings are         
 definately in the minority. Most grass
 or heathland is used for garzing for  
 sheep occaisionally cattle. There is  
 no crop growth except for some hay.   
 Farms tend to cover a large area in   
 order that sufficient grazing of      
 quality may be found for the          
 livestock.                            
   Of the tree covered land some       
 belongs to the Forestry Commission and
 some to Economic Forestry. The        
 Forestry Commision use this area as a 
 nursery area for their trees. However 
 much of the area is too hilly for the 
 planting machinery and is therefore   
 left as grass. Spraying of the trees  
 with fertiliser  is done by           
 helicopter.
