		<content> The three main industries in the area 
 are Farming, Distilling and Baking.   
 The numbers employed in farming have  
 declined in recent years, but it still
 gives work to quite a few people.     
 Distilleries have also been cutting   
 down the number of people they        
 employ.                               
 The biggest employer in the area is   
 Walker's the bakery whose products go 
 all round the world.                  
 Some people commute to Elgin and      
 elsewhere to get jobs.                
 There are quite a few tradesmen in    
 Aberlour, electricians, joiners,      
 plumbers, and builders, and they      
 provide a lot of work for local       
 people, serving a wide area around    
 Aberlour.                             
 The schools, community centre garages,
 road haulage and shops also provide   
 employment.                           </content>
