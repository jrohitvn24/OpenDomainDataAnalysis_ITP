		<content> chose these breeds because they give  
 big calves which put on weight        
 rapidly.There are also sheep - Cheviot
 ewes and Suffolk rams: rearing fat    
 lambs for sale.                       
 The livestock have 29 acres of grazing
 28 of which are rotation grass. The   
 remaining 24 acres are under crops -  
 barley, grass (for hay) and turnips   
 mainly to provide winter feeding for  
 the animals. However if quality and   
 price are right the barley may be sold
 to a malting firm in Inverness.       
 Kincraig Farm (GR 694702) is a large  
 mixed farm and is worked by the owner 
 and three full-time employees. The    
 farm carries 150 cross-Hereford beef  
 cows which are served by Charollais   
 bulls. Again these breeds produce     
 large calves which are reared for 1-2 
 years before being sold for further   
 fattening.                            </content>
