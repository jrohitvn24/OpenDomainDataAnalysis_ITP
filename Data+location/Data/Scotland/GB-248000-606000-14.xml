		<content> The other employment sources in the   
 area are farming and forestry.  The   
 latter is quite a recent development  
 in the valley.  When the opencast site
 has been restored it seems likely that
 it too will be planted with conifers  
 as part of Kyle Forest.               
                                       
                                       
 On the southern slope above the mouth 
 of the valley there is a small factory
 run by the Carrington-Vyella Group.   
 Located on the northern outskirts of  
 Dalmellington it is used as a training
 unit for operatives in the main       
 factory in the town centre.  The main 
 product of the firm from these two    
 units is ladies' and children's       
 clothing.
