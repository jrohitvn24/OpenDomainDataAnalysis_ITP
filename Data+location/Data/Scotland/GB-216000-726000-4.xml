		<title>04THE OBAN TIMES</title>
		<content>  The local newspaper for this area is 
 known as The Oban Times, in it is     
 contained both local and national news
 items which will be of interest to the
 local population. Unfortunatly that   
 which tends to be of most interest is 
 often bad news. This is particularly  
 true if the incident invloves local   
 people. For instance there have been  
 over the years some plane crashes in  
 the hills around Dalmally. When such a
 disaster occurs people of the village 
 are directly involved firstly in the  
 search for the survivors and secondly 
 in caring for them until suitable     
 professional help can be summoned.    
 Such times although regretable bring  
 the people of the village together and
 prove how well they combine as a team.
 Often as well as such major crisis    
 search parties must organised to      
 search for lost hillwalkers.          </content>
