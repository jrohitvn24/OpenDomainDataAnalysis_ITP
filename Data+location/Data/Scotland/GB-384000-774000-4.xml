		<title>04THE OLD CHURCH OF KINNEFF</title>
		<content> The{original church}was opened in     
 1242,and was rebuilt in 1738 on the   
 same foundations. The church as it    
 stands today was rebuilt in 1876.     
 Within the last few years a           
{Preservation Trust}has been formed to 
 look after the building. The old      
 church played a very important part in
 stopping the{Scottish Crown Jewels    
 falling into the hands of Oliver      
 Cromwell. The crown,the sceptre and   
 the sword were in{Dunnottar Castle.   
 Cromwell besieged the castle hoping to
 get the crown jewels. One story says  
 Mrs.Granger,wife of the minister at   
 Kinneff old church, managed to smuggle
 the crown jewels out of the castle    
 hidden in bundles of flax. Mr.Granger 
 hid them under a slab in front of the 
 pulpit in the church. They stayed     
 there safe for 8 years till the       
 Restoration.                          </content>
