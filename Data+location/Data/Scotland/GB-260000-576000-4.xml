		<title>04Population,New Galloway</title>
		<content>  The New Galloway population consists 
 of retired people(many from England)of
 adequate financial means, the families
 whose fathers are involved in         
 Forestry and, in recent years, there  
 has been a great influx of people     
 whose attitudes and interests are very
 much different to the traditional type
 of family. This has caused dissension 
 in the village between those who      
 still exist in the "extended family"  
 situation and those at the opposite   
 extreme.                              
   As a result of our opinion poll, it 
 seems that this rival feeling is      
 becoming very deeply rooted which is  
 unfortunate as the poll also showed   
 that each side thought that the other 
 had a lot to contribute to the village
 life. The poll showed that neither    
 side was willing to move towards the  
 other.                                </content>
