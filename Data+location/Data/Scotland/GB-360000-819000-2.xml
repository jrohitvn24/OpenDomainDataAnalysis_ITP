		<content> The land is hilly and often rocky with
 considerable wear and tear on         
 implements. The rearing of beef cattle
 is the traditional local industry but,
 in recent years, the Aberdeen Angus,  
 the blue grey Shorthorn cross and the 
 white faced Hereford have been        
 replaced by, or crossed with,         
 Continental breeds - especially the   
 Charollais and Simmental.             
 .                                     
 Cropping is largely barley, potatoes  
 and turnips (although much less of the
 latter are now grown than a few years 
 previously). Winter barley and wheat  
 are increasingly grown and there is a 
 good deal of silage production for    
 winter feeding as well as a small     
 quantity of hay.
