		<content> This small factory on the main street 
 in Dalbeattie makes fashion and       
 leisure garments for mail order       
 catalogues in the U.K.The material is 
 bought both in U.K.and abroad.The     
 design is either customer specified or
 the factories own.The material is laid
 out in layers of 25 and the shape of  
 each piece stamped on it is then cut  
 using an electric cutting machine.The 
 next step is to mark each piece with a
 number so that the machinists know    
 which pieces to join.Here this is     
 known as soabar.The machinists sit in 
 rows each sewing their particular part
 of each garment which is finished with
 buttons or studs at the end of the    
 line.Each garment then has to be      
 passed and sent to pressers or back to
 be corrected.Some garments are washed 
 before pressing as this is fashionable
 at present.A laundry is on sight.     </content>
