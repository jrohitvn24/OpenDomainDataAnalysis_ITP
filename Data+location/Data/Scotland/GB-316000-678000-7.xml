		<title>07THE NAPOLEON ROOM (cont)</title>
		<content>  The room also contains the Emperor's 
 state chair and shaving stand as well 
 as Wellington's campaign chair.       
  One of the most interesting items on 
 view is the sketch by{David}of the    
{Coronation of Josephine.}This is      
 slightly different  from the finished 
 picture which hangs in the{Louvre.    
  The 5th Earl's interest prompted him 
 to write{"Napoleon:The Last Phase",   
 published in 1909. By writing about   
 Napoleon when he was a powerless      
 prisoner, the Earl captured the man   
 very effectively. He wrote about      
 Napoleon's political theories and     
 opinions sympathetically (his own     
 political experiences permitted this) 
 and convincingly shows how Napoleon   
 rose to power on the backs of the     
{Jacobins,}a French Revolutionary      
 group, but refused to turn to the     
 people to retain his throne.          </content>
