 entry to the village is a telephone   
 kiosk with an old coin-operated pay   
 box with a ten-pence and five- pence  
 slot,the latter one being sealed off. 
 The Post Office is now part of a house
 and the post box is situated opposite,
 on a metal post outside the old shop.

 the Post Office the post box was set  
 into the wall and  could be emptied   
 from inside the building).
