		<content> 'We asked all the children in the     
 class what job their father did and   
 then we made a pie chart. We found    
 that every father had a job, two were 
 teachers, two were crofters but all   
 the rest had different jobs. One or   
 two were self-employed such as the    
 joiner, the postmaster-genersl store  
 the fisherman, the mechanic and the   
 crofters. Two worked for a local      
 estate as gamekeeper and as farm      
 manager'.                             
 There is seasonal work available in   
 the hotels, but there are very few    
 opportunities  for girls in the       
 village to have regular employment.   
 Those who have college or university  
 education usually have to find a job  
 away from home.
