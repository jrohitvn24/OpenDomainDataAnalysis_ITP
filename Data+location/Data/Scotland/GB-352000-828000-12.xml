		<title>12Thirty Years Of Change Cont.</title>
		<content> Although trains still pass through    
 Kennethmont on their way between the  
 larger centres, the station is now    
 closed. Family size has greatly       
 changed, and where a family with eight
 or ten children was not unusual thirty
 years ago, two or three children is   
 now a more likely number. Improved    
 health care means that there is also a
 great difference in the age of the    
 population with more people living    
 longer. Many pensioners live in       
 Kennethmont, prefering a quiet country
 retirement to a home in the town or   
 city. Perhaps the biggest change of   
 all is in the attitudes of the people.
 Our survey suggested that most people 
 thought our society as a whole has    
 become more greedy, lazy, selfish and 
 mercinary than ever before, and that  
 we had lost our self-reliance and now 
 expected too much to be done for us.  </content>
