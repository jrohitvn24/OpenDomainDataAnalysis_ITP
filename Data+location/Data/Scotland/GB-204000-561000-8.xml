		<content>        Sheuchan Primary today is much 
 different from that of 1862. We now   
 have a new building built on to the   
 old one (since 1958) which gives us   
 many more classrooms. We have a       
 kitchen and a dining room for those   
 who wish to take school lunches. We   
 have specialist teachers for          
 Art,Music,Gym,Violin,Cello and Brass. 
 We also have a school dentist and     
 nurse.We have a hall with a stage and 
 outside we have a huge playing        
 field.In school we have a B.B.C.      
 Microcomputer,four televisions and a  
 video recorder.We also have radio     
 cassetes for listening to and         
 recording our radio programmes.A      
 mobile library visits the school      
 often.There are 263 pupils at present 
 in our school with 10 class teachers, 
 a remedial teacher,a secretary and our
