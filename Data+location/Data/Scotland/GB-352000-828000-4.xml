		<title>04Wildlife In Kennethmont 2.</title>
		<content> Numerous species of wild animals      
 are found in the Kennethmont area. The
 farmland is home to many hares, and   
 voles while the wood and bog areas    
 shelter red squirrels, roe deer,mice, 
 hedgehogs,rats,wildcats (not ferral   
 cats),foxes,stoats,weasels,rabbits,   
 mice and rats seem to be widespread   
 throughout the area. There are no     
 otters now and if there are badgers or
 mink they are not common.Frogs and    
 newts are numerous but we cannot      
 comment on the numbers of snakes or   
 lizards having seen none and having   
 heard from no-one who has.There is no 
 evidence in this area of agricultural 
 chemicals(fertilizers,weedkillers,pest
 controls,etc.) having done any serious
 damage to the environment.            
     There have recently been sightings
 of a large unidentified animal in the 
 woods at Leith Hall,a haggis perhaps? </content>
