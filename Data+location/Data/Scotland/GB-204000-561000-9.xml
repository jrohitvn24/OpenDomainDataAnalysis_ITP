		<content> Heading northward, a few hundred      
 metres from our school is Agnew Park. 
 This is a children's play area with   
 swings, see-saw, climbing frame, hobby
 horse, chute, maypole,and infant      
 swings.Here you can also have a game  
 of putting,crazy golf,or draughts.    
 Next to the park is The Marine        
 Lake.This is a man made boating pool  
 and swimming area.There is now        
 windsurfing,sailing,rowing, and paddle
 boats in the Marine Lake. Bordering   
 the Marine Lake on the east side is   
 the West Pier and the                 
 Harbour.Clustered around the harbour  
 are the streets; Fisher Street,Market 
 Street,Harbour Street and Kipper      
 Lane.These streets, now offices and   
 garages, were once inhabited by       
 seafaring folk.Indeed the beginning of
 Agnew Cresc.,we found from old maps,  
 was once called Neptune Place.        </content>
