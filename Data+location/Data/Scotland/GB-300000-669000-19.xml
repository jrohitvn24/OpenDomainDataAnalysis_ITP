		<content>{BANGOUR RESERVOIR}IS A PRIVATE        
 RESERVOIR,IT SUPPLIES WATER TO {      
{BANGOUR VILLAGE HOSPITAL.}IT HAS {    
{PRIVATE FISHING REGULATIONS.}IT IS    
 SURROUNDED BY TREES AND INTERESTING   
 PLANTS.ON ONE SIDE IT HAS THE REMAINS 
 OF A BRICK HOUSE.THERE IS A SMALL PIER
 WHICH STANDS OVER THE RESERVOIR AND IT
 IS INTERESTING TO VISITORS.THERE IS A 
 MIXTURE OF CONIFEROUS AND DECIDUOUS   
 TREES SURROUNDING THE RESERVOIR.THERE 
 ARE LOTS OF WATER LILIES IN THE WATER 
 AND BROWN AND RAINBOW TROUT AS WELL   
   THE RESERVOIR IS A NICE PLACE FOR A 
 FAMILY OUTING AND WE THINK THAT THE   
 LOCAL AUTHORITY SHOULD TAKE IT OVER   
 AND TURN IT INTO A {COUNTRY PARK}WHERE
 PEOPLE CAN GO AND PICNIC.
