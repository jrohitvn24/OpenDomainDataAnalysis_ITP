		<content>  AN AFTERNOON AND EVENING IN THE LIFE 
 OF A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD SCHOOLGIRL:   
  1.30-4.00 P.M. Charlotte follows her 
 usual timetable of classes at school. 
  4.00 P.M. She catches the school bus 
 to her friends house, collects her    
 bike and cycles home. She changes into
 jeans, a tee-shirt and helps her      
 mother make the tea. This night       
 consists of steak pie, potatoes and   
 peas, followed by rhubarb and custard.
  5.30 P.M. After washing up the dishes
 her mother takes Charolette into Cupar
 where she works in Templeton's,a local
 supermarket. She stacks shelves there 
 for three hours, three nights a week. 
  9.00 P.M. Her mother collects her    
 from work and takes her home, where   
 she has a cup of coffee and then goes 
 to bed.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
