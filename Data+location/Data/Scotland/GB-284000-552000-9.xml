		<content>   There are five farms in the area.   
 Glenstocken and Boreland each have    
 over 100 dairy cows, mostly Friesians,
 but with a few Ayrshires.West Barcloy 
 and East Barcloy raise beef cattle,   
 mainly Galloways,  Friesians  and     
 Herefords. Thorniehill is no longer a 
 working farm but lets out its fields  
 to other farmers for grazing.         
   The beef cattle stay out all year   
 but the cows are brought inside from  
 October to March. In the winter the   
 farmers buy in up to 200 sheep to eat 
 the grass. Boreland has some sheep all
 the year round and in Spring there are
 usually about 150 lambs.              
   For feeding,the farmers grow grass  
 for silage, and hay. Silage is mown   
 grass, chopped and wrapped up tightly 
 to keep the air out. The first cut is 
 in June and the second in August.
