		<title>17THE LANDSCAPE OF DUNS &amp; AREA</title>
		<content> MOST OF OUR AREA IS RURAL,WITH QUITE A
 BIT OF URBAN SPREAD THROUGHOUT.MUCH OF
 THE RURAL LANDSCAPE IS OPEN COUNTRY   
 USED FOR ARABLE &amp; LIVESTOCK.WOODLAND  
 IS MAINLY DECIDUOUS.THE LITTLE WATER  
 THERE IS,IS MAINLY MARSH.THE LAND IS  
 GENTLY UNDULATING &amp;LOW WITH FEW HILLS.
      THE RURAL ROADS ARE NARROW &amp; NOT 
 VERY GOOD.IN DUNS ITSELF,THE ROADS &amp;  
 STREETS WERE ONCE COBBLED BUT ARE NOW 
 TARRED.THE SQUARE IS BUSY AS IT HAS   
 MOST OF THE SHOPS.THERE IS A VARIETY  
 OF HOUSING IN DUNS.IN THE OLD PART OF 
 THE TOWN,THE HOUSES ARE BUILT OUT OF  
 STONE &amp;SLATE &amp;ARE BUILT TO THEIR OWN  
 DESIGN,WHEREAS THE MORE MODERN HOUSING
 ESTATES ARE BRICK &amp;TILED ROOFS &amp;BUILT 
 TO THE SAME DESIGN.THERE IS A PARK IN 
 THE MIDDLE OF DUNS &amp;SEVERAL PLAYING   
 FIELDS SO THAT THE URBAN LANDSCAPE    
 SEEMS TO MERGE WITH THE RURAL         
 LANDSCAPE.                            </content>
