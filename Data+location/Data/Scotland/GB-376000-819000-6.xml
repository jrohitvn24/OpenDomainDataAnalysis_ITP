 There are a variety of recreational   
 facilities in and around Inverurie.   
                                       
 The Community Centre has a Swimming   
 Pool and a Games Hall, which are used 
 by Inverurie Academy, but are also    
 available to the general public. The  
 games hall can accommodate badminton, 
 squash, indoor bowling etc.           
                                       
  The centre is used by various groups,
 but it also has Community Workers     
 employed who organise activities for  
 the community.                        
                                       
 For the young there are Youth Clubs   
 and Discos. A new group recently      
 formed is the Garioch Adventure Club  
 who organise activities for           
 families.The Community Centre also    
 caters very well for the disabled.    </content>
