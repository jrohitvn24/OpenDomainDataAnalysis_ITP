		<title>07VISCOUNT THURSO OF ULBSTER</title>
		<content>{  Viscount Thurso of Ulbster}lives at 
{Thurso East}close to{Mount Pleasant   
{School.}He succeeded to the title in  
 1964 on the death of his father, the  
 former{Sir Archibald Sinclair,}who was
 awarded the title in 1952 because of  
 his distinguished political career.   
  {Viscount Thurso}is Lord Lieutenant  
 of the County of{Caithness}and is an  
 active member of the{House of Lords.  
   His home, at{Thurso East, was once  
 the staff quarters of the now derelict
{Thurso Castle}dismantled in 1952      
 because of severe structural defects. 
    The walls of the present dining    
 room are adorned with portraits of    
{Lord Thurso's}ancestors and one, which
 was of particular interest to us, is  
 a Raeburn of{Sir John Sinclair}who    
 compiled the first Statistical Account
 of Scotland in 1790.
