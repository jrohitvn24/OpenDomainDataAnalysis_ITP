		<content> Other farm products include -         
                                       
 1.{Turnips}- animal fodder for both   
 sheep and cattle.                     
                                       
 2.{Oats}- animal fodder for both sheep
 and cattle. This year's crop had a    
 high moisture content because of the  
 unusually high summer rainfall. To    
 counter this high moisture level,     
 proponic acid was added - this has the
 effect of pickling the grain.         
                                       
 3.{Main crop potatoes}- sold on the   
 open market for domestic use.         
                                       
 4.{Oil seed rape}- This is a          
 relatively new crop which has been    
 introduced to the area in the last 4  
 years. The seeds produce a vegetable  
 oil which is used in the manufacturing
 of margarine.                         </content>
