		<content> ABERDEEN FOOTBALL CLUB.               
                                       
 Aberdeen Football Club's ground is    
 called Pittodrie Stadium, at the east 
 end of our area.                      
                                       
 In recent years A.F.C. has been very  
 successful - having won the Premier   
 League and European Cup Winner's Cup  
 - and thus have been able to modernise
 their ground until it is now one of   
 the best in Britain seating, as it    
 does a capicity crowd of 24,000.      
                                       
 Unlike some clubs, Aberdeen does not  
 attract many "soccer hooligans" and a 
 Saturday football match is still      
 considered a family outing.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
