		<title>14NEW ABBEY - LOCAL HISTORY(1)</title>
		<content>   Evidence of early occupation by man 
 is shown by a Neolithic burial barrow 
 on Lochhill,an Iron Age motte at      
 Ingleston, bronze finds at Kirkconnell
 and a crannog on Loch Kindar.         
   The village grew around Sweetheart  
 Abbey,at first outside the walled     
 precincts,but later also inside. After
 its dissolution about 1610, the abbey 
 stone became housebuilding material,  
 but there are fine remains of the     
 buildings,constructed of pinkish-red  
 sandstone.                            
   New Abbey has had many mills - corn,
 timber,snuff and flax - and two ponds,
 once stocked with monastic fish.      
   A century ago families were large   
 and many people were poor. Most people
 worked on the land.It was quite common
 for old people to have hardly ever    
 left the village. Now all that has    
 changed with the coming of the car.   </content>
