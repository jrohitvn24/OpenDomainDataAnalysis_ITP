		<content>   Our class takes part in a variety of
 leisure activities. Some go to the    
 Youth Club where they play rounders,  
 table tennis, pool, etc. They may have
 a disco or watch a video film.        
   Ten boys are members of Pentland    
 Boys' Club where they have football   
 training. Others, in the Scouts, take 
 part in outdoor hobbies like camping, 
 hillwalking and abseiling.            
   Many girls are interested in dancing
 of various kinds, Highland, Disco and 
 Ballet, all of which require special  
 outfits. Other girls attend Red Cross 
 to learn First Aid and Child Care.    
   The Swimming Club is popular and    
 members go to Edinburgh to compete.   
 Among the church organisations        
 attended are Girls' Brigade, Sunday   
 School, Campaigners and the Salvation 
 Army. During the winter most of our   
 class attend school badminton.        </content>
