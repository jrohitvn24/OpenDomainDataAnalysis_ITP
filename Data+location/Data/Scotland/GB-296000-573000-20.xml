		<title>20St.Michael's Church Dumfries</title>
		<content> St.Michael's Church is a Presbyterian 
 church, named after the patron saint  
 of Dumfries. In fact Robert Burns even
 came to this church. The ministers who
 work there are called John Pagaan and 
 Albert Elder. A lady called Miss Mary 
 Smith keeps the church in order.      
    The pulpit in the church is shaped 
 like a chalice and it cost six pounds 
 to build. There have also been a lot  
 of break-ins.                         
    During the last war the Norwegians 
 came to Dumfries, and each Sunday they
 went to St.Michael's Church. And when 
 the war finished and they left, just  
 to show how grateful they were they   
 left a plaque with the words:         
{When the Germans invaded our country  
{We Norwegians found in Scotland a home
{And in this house of God,             
{Peace and Strength.
