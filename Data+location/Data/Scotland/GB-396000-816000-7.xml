		<title>07A TYPICAL DAY, BY MARK</title>
		<content> I awoke yesterday morning at 8 a.m.   
 Ibrushed my teeth,washed my face and  
 hands.I got dressed and had coffee    
 and a buttery for my breakfast,with   
 my mum who is called Irene,my dad     
 Colin,and my sister who is called     
 Jenny.I set off for school about      
 8.40.I arrived at 8.50.We had some    
 maths and language,art and gym.We also
 did some work on the domesday project.
 When I arrived home I had a game of   
 football by myself.I was practising   
 free kicks.I came in about 5.20 and   
 watched connections on the t.v. for   
 20 minutes.It was a quiz game.I then  
 had my tea which was steak and chips. 
 I played with my toy tractors,and then
 played more football.I practised      
 heading the ball by myself,and then   
 went to my bed about 10.10p.m.It had  
 been a pretty average sort of day.
