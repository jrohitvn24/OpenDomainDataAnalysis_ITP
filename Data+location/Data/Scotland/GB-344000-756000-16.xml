		<title>16The Glenogil Gamekeeper</title>
		<content> Pheasant chicks are brought to the    
 estate in early July and are krpt in  
 pens. The keeper sees that the chicks 
 are fed and watered, given adequate   
 shelter and protected from predators. 
 The young pheasants are fed on various
 types of grain and special pellets    
 which contain vitamins to ensure their
 healthy growth. when the young birds  
 are strong and mature they are        
 released onto the estate but the      
 keeper continues to feed them to keep 
 them healthy and to ensure that they  
 remain on the estate.                 
 When the shooting season starts,      
 beaters are hired to drive the birds  
 out of cover towards the guns.The guns
 are lined up at good firing points.   
 Gun-dogs, mainly trained by the       
 keepers, retrieve the shot birds and  
 each gun is credited with the number  
 of birds he has brought down.         </content>
