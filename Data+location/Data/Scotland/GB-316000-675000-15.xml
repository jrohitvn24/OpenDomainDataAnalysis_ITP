		<content> 1985 is an important anniversary of   
 the Royal Burgess Golf Club which was 
 laid out by locals in 1735 where there
 once had been beautifual parkland     
 surrounded by mature trees. Recently  
 the course was improved by James Braid
 who twice won the British Open        
 Championship. There are more than 1000
 members, including about 50 juniors.  
 The Pro since 1973 has been George    
 Yuille. The Club has a Pro Shop.      
 Inside the clubhouse there is a       
 diningroom, a bar, a television room  
 and a billiard room, and strangely    
 enough a card room. There are lockers 
 and showers.                          
 The Royal Burgess runs alongside the  
 Bruntsfield Links Golf Club. On the   
 Dalmeny Estate side of the River      
 Almond there is the Earl of Rosebery's
 private course of nine holes. These   
 courses are all within the Green Belt.</content>
