		<title>12THE BRECHIN BY-PASS</title>
		<content> The by-pass was opened in I976. It    
 follows a route to the north-west of  
 the town. Its total length of 4 miles 
 incorporates 4 bridges and 2 pairs of 
 lay-bys.  Its average width is 9.3    
 metres. The removal of through-       
 traffic from the streets of Brechin   
 has made the centre less dangerous,   
 less noisy, less polluted and less    
 congested. A survey , on a typical    
 weekday morning, showed that traffic  
 was using the by-pass at the rate of  
 550 vehicles an hour. 34% of this flow
 consisted of lorries heading to and   
 from the thriving oil city of         
 Aberdeen. Cars accounted for 58% of   
 the flow and buses, vans, tractors and
 motorcycles made up the rest. Although
 good quality farmland was used up and 
 a petrol station on the old road      
 closed down most of the community has 
 benefited from this transport addition</content>
