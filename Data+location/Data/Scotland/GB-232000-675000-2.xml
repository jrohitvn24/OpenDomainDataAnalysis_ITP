		<content>    Cardross has a long history but the
 first most interesting information is 
 about one of Scotland's most famous   
 kings.In the fourteenth century Robert
 the Bruce lived in Cardross from 1326 
 to 1329, when he died.Robert first    
 came to Cardross because he owned land
 there.He died of leprosy on the 7th   
 June 1329.Unable to follow his desire 
 to go on a crusade, in his will he    
 asked that his heart be removed from  
 his body and taken to the Holy Land.  
 His body is buried in Dunfermline     
 Abbey. His heart was eventually buried
 in Melrose Abbey, as the proposed     
 crusade never reached the Holy Land.
