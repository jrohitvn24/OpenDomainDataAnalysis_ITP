		<title>06HIGH SCHOOL? BISHOPBRIGGS P7</title>
		<content> 1st and 2nd year pupils we met from   
 Bishopbriggs High School said we would
 like secondary school because:        
{We}will not be stuck with the same    
 teacher all day but have a variety.   
{There}are lots of out-of-school       
 activities although there were very   
 few this year because of industrial   
 action by teachers.                   
{Each}year the school puts on concerts 
 and a musical in the summer term.     
{Physical}Education is very good with  
 lots of opportunities to learn        
 different games and athletics.        
{There}were 8 periods in the day so we 
 would move around a lot. We might get 
 lost at first because the building is 
 so big but we would soon find our way.
{Practical}subjects like Home Economics
 Metalwork, Art, etc. were enjoyable.  
{With}almost 800 pupils (about 150 in  
 1st Year)we could make lots of friends</content>
