		<title>02HOUSING IN PERTH</title>
		<content>    Housing in Perth reflects both the 
 city's historical background and      
 recent developments. There has been a 
 gradual expansion westwards from the  
 medieval core of the town. This       
 development has been added to by      
 subsequent 20th century expansion.    
    The prime existing example of      
{medieval architecture}is the 15th     
 century St.John's Kirk in the town    
 centre. The only other significant    
 remnant of such heritage is the       
 gridiron street pattern of closes and 
 vennels in the centre of town.        
   {Georgian housing}occurs beyond the 
 boundaries of the long demolished city
 walls. Some houses are large and      
 impressive residences, often occupied 
 by surgeries and offices. The elegant 
 Rose Terrace is currently being       
 renovated and its facade preserved.
