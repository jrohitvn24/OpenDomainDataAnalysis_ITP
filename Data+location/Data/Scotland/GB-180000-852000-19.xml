		<title>19LIFE IN SHIELDAIG</title>
		<content>    SHIELDAIG  HAS SEEN MANY CHANGES IN
 THE PAST FEW YEARS.   ONLY IN THE LAST
 TWENTY YEARS HAS TRAVELLING NORTH AND 
 SOUTH ALONG THE COAST BEEN POSSIBLE   
 WITH THE OPENING OF ROADS TO TORRIDON 
 TO THE NORTH AND APPLECROSS TO THE    
 SOUTH.   THE ONLY ROAD WAS INLAND TO  
 LOCHCARRON.   THESE WERE JOINED ONLY  
 BY TRACKS.   MOST TRADE WITH THE      
 VILLAGES WAS BY BOAT.                 
    NOW EVERYONE ENJOYS THE CONVENIENCE
 OF THE MOTOR CAR, WHICH ALSO BRINGS   
 ONE  OF THE MAIN INDUSTRIES _         
 TOURISTS.                             
    THE VILLAGE IS BUSTLING IN THE     
 SUMMER MONTHS, CONTRASTING WITH THE   
 QUIET OF THE WINTER.   TOURISTS BRING 
 AFFLUENCE AND WORK TO MANY HIGHLANDERS
 AND SHIELDAIG IS NOW A PLACE WHERE    
 PEOPLE COME TO LIVE AND WORK FROM ALL 
 OVER BRITAIN.
