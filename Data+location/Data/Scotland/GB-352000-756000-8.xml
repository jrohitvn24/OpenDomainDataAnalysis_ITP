		<content> The wildlife here consists of deer,   
 rabbits, badgers, squirrels, foxes and
 weasels. There are also moles, and a  
 man comes round and traps them because
 of the damage they do. There are only 
 red squirrels here. There are red deer
 and roe deer in the forest. You often 
 see rabbits and hares running around  
 in the fields. You can tell the       
 difference between a hare and a rabbit
 because the hare has longer ears and  
 it is altogether larger.If you are    
 quiet in the wood you can see bats,   
 rats,mice and ferrets.
