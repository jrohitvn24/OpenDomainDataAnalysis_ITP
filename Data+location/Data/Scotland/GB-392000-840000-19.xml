		<title>19TREE NURSERY</title>
		<content> We did a project on trees and we found
 out there were not a lot of trees in  
 Auchnagatt, so we decided to plant a  
 few trees to liven up the Village.    
 We planted a few different types of   
 trees such as{Horse Chestnut,Broom,   
{Oak,Silver Birch,Weeping Beech,Rowan, 
{Elderberry,Elm Seeds,Alder.           
     First of all we arranged to go to 
 Aden park to collect seeds to plant in
 our Village. We left the seeds outside
 to break up(stratify).                
 Then we planted them in the greenhouse
 to grow up,once they were at a certain
 lenth we dug them up and planted them 
 in the tree nursery.                  
        We have planted{Elm}and{Broom} 
 in our tree nursery and are going to  
 plant acorns in a weeks time.We hope  
 that in the future you will look back 
 and see our trees that we have        
 planted.                              </content>
