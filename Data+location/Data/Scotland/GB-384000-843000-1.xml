		<title>01Cairnbanno, New Deer</title>
		<content>   This area of the countryside is to  
 the south west of New Deer village.   
 There are few trees, mostly clustered 
 around the scattered farmhouses, with 
 the occasional small plantation or    
 shelterbelt.                          
   The farms in this area are mostly   
 mixed livestock and arable units with 
 a few dairy farms as well.            
   The farmers in the district are very
 sociable and there is a thriving      
 Cairnbanno Community Club which is    
 affiliated to New deer Community      
 Association.                          
   The Community Club is centred on the
 old Cairnbanno School. The Members    
 have a lively calendar of activities, 
 including drama, bowling and whist.
