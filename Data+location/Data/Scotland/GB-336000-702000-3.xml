		<content>   After he was taken to England he    
 presented all the officers on the     
 shipwith a minature portrait of       
 himself, painted on bone.             
   Around the early 18th century when  
 there  was a great demand for coal and
 when coal was discovered on Durie     
 Estate the Christies brought miners   
 across from France to show the Fife   
 people how to sink pits.              
          The French people lived in a 
 place called Mont Fleurie.The Leven   
 people put the two words together and 
 it then became Mountfleurie.Mont      
 stands for mine and Fleur stands for  
 flower.                               
    The Christie's of Durie were  the  
 principal landowners and one of the   
 main streets is named after them,     
 Durie Street.
