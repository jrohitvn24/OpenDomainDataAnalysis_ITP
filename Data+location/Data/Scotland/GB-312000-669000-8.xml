		<title>08QUARRIES IN RATHO</title>
		<content> THERE ARE TWO WORKING QUARRIES IN THE 
 RATHO AREA. HILLWOOD QUARRY IS OWNED  
 AND RUN BY WIMPEY AND CRAIGPARK QUARRY
 IS OWNED AND RUN BY KINGS. BOTH THESE 
 QUARRIES PRODUCE THE SAME TYPE OF     
 STONE. THE QUARRIES WERE STARTED IN   
 THE EARLY 1900'S AND HAVE BEEN GREATLY
 ENLARGED SINCE THEN.                  
    THE QUARRIES ARE ABOUT 50 METRES   
 DEEP AND COVER AN AREA OF ABOUT THIRTY
 ACRES EACH. IN ONE YEAR THEY MINE     
 ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS OF   
 STONE.  THE STONE QUARRIED IS A BASALT
 WHICH IS VERY HARD AND IS USED MAINLY 
 FOR MAKING ROADS AND FOR MIXING WITH  
 CEMENT TO MAKE CONCRETE. THERE IS     
 BLASTING AT THE QUARRIES ABOUT ONCE A 
 WEEK. EACH BLAST TAKES ABOUT 2.5 TONS 
 OF EXPLOSIVE. WHEN THE BLASTING TAKES 
 PLACE, THE EFFECT CAN BE FELT IN THE  
 VILLAGE OF RATHO AS THE HOUSES SHAKE  
 FROM THE EXPLOSION.                   </content>
