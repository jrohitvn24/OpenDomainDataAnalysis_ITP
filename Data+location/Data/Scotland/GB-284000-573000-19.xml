		<title>19THE HEARSE HOUSE IN SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>   In 1814 the parish decided to have a
 hearse. One hundred and twenty six    
 parishioners paid a subscription      
 towards getting one. With the money   
 they bought a horse-drawn hearse and a
 hearse house which cost Â£16 12s 6d. It
 still exists near Shawhead shop and is
 now a garage with the rent paid to the
 Church.                               
   The hearse was free to subscibers,  
 others had to pay 4 shillings for     
 under 10 miles and 5 shillings for    
 over 10 miles. It was free to the     
 poor.                                 
   At a meeting, in December 1824, they
 decided to get a black box cloak to   
 cover the hearse. Also at the meeting 
 the driver was said to be picking up  
 people and this was causing damage to 
 the hearse. He was to be fined 5      
 shillings if it happened again.
