		<title>17THE BLACK WATCH</title>
		<content> In the 1700s,men were employed by the 
 Government to keep peace in the       
 Highlands.They wore a{dark tartan     
 which became known as the{Black Watch 
 Companies of these men were gathered  
 into a Regiment known as the Black    
 Watch or{42nd Regiment.               
 They first mustered in 1740 on the    
 north bank of the River Tay,opposite  
 Aberfeldy.                            
 The{Black Watch Monument}in Aberfeldy}
 on the south side of the Tay was      
 unveiled in 1887. It takes the form of
 a cairn on top of which stands a      
 kilted soldier.                       
 The Regiment received the{Freedom of  
{Aberfeldy}in 1970 when they exercised 
 their right to march "with bayonets   
 fixed,drums beating,colours flying'.  
                                       
 The{regimental depot}is now in{Perth.
