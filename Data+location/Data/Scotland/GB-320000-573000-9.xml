		<title>09AGRICULTURE IN EAGLESFIELD</title>
		<content>{ Farming}in this area of Scotland in  
 1985 will long be remembered as one of
 ,if not the worst in living memory.As 
 I write this at the end of October the
 harvest fields have just been         
 cleared,in some case the second cut of
 silage is now in and the potatoe crop 
 is being lifted.The{dairy farms}have  
 had to put the cows inside much       
 earlier than usual owing to the wet   
 conditions,which not only affected the
 fields but also the milk yields.      
  Most of the farms in this area are   
 mixed rather than specialising in one 
 branch of farming,some have dairy     
 herds and also grow barley and        
 potatoes, others have beef and sheep  
 enterprises with some{arable}ground to
 supplement winter feeding.There are   
 two specialist{chicken farms}which are
 engaged in scientific breeding        
 programmes.                           </content>
