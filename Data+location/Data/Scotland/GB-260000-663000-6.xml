		<title>06        The Barras</title>
		<content> The Barras as this market is known    
 today began in 1915/16 in the Green   
 Street, Stevenson Street area of      
 Calton by Margaret McIver.The name    
 originates from the selling of goods  
 from carts or barrows.                
 The Barras have now greatly expanded  
 in the Gallowgate area.They are       
 composed of six markets which rent out
 several hundred stalls, all under     
 cover.All sorts of new goods and food 
 stuffs as well as second-hand things  
 are sold.                             
 Almost Â£1,000,000 from S.D.A. was     
 recently spent on improvments through 
 The Barras Enterprise Trust.Their aims
 are to improve the appearence of the  
 market without changing it's          
 character.This area also contains     
 another famous Glasgow landmark 'The  
 Barrowland Ballroom' built by McIvers 
 in 1934.                              </content>
