		<content> Old name for the Parish,from old      
 church near confluence of Stinchar and
 Tig,was Kirkcudbright-Innertig.About  
 1604 a new church was built near Ard- 
 stinchar Castle and the present name  
 from Gaelic for "village on the shore"
 was given.The village became a Burgh  
 of Barony 1617.The date of erection   
 of the castle is unknown,certainly    
 complete by early 15th century.It fell
 into disuse in early 18th century.In  
 1770,stones from it were used to build
 the Stinchar bridge,an inn and several
 houses.It was a seat of a branch of   
 turbulent Kennedy clan,a young chief  
 of which was killed by cousins in 1601
 His tomb is in the remains of the 1604
 church,called "the auld aisle",in the 
 old graveyard.Present church built    
 c1819.Harbour built 1850,not a great  
 success.First school was a bequest    
 from Charles McNily,died 1730.        </content>
