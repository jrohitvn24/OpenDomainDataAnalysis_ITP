 British Telecom is situated beside    
 Fisherton Primary School.This is on

 visited regularly by local telephone  
 engineer.The Radio Station is also    
 owned by British Telecom and is       
 situated approximately 250 yards from 
 the school at the top of a road       
 locally known as "Coal Pit Road".This 
 station uses Microwave technique for  
 the transmission of telephone calls   
 across the Firth of Clyde to Arran and
 Mull of Kintyre.The transmitter and   
 receiver aerials are mounted on steel 
 structures approximately 80 metres    
 high which look like large saucers but
 are in fact called "Dish Arrays".
