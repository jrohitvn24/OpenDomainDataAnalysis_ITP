 congeries of little hills gentle in   
 their outline verdant on their        
 clothing and on some instances waring 
 crowns of platation on their summit.

 carse it has in general a high and    
 light soil and does not seem to have  
 been naturally fertile but by the best
 of known means has been richly        
 improved and now everywhere exhibits  
 a well cultured and cheerful          
 appearance with dry stone dykes and   
 hawthornhedges well maintained.
