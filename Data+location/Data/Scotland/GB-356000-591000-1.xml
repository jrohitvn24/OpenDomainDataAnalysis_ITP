		<content> The area covered by this D-Block      
 straddles the border between England  
 and Scotland,and is made up of open   
 moorland and forest.{Larriston Fells,}
 reaching a height of 512 metres above 
 sea-level, form the natural border,   
 whilst the administrative boundary is 
 to the east and slightly lower.       
 On the Scottish side the fell slopes  
 steeply towards{Larriston Rigg}and is 
 drained by a series of{burns} and{    
{sikes}. The gentler slopes to the east
 are covered by the{Kielder Forest.}   
 Cattle graze on the open moorland,    
 which is crossed by a track which once
 carried the cross-border traffic. At  
{Bloody Bush}a large stone pillar      
 records the tolls charged for the     
 passage of various livestock, as well 
 as distances to various locations.    
 There are no settlements in the area.
