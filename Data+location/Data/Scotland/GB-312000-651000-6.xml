{are 20 new "sheltered" houses being   
{built for the elderly.                
{  The most recently built large,      
{luxury houses are on the main road and
{to the northwest of the village. They 
{are also of timber frame construction 
{and follow the English design with    
{large hipped roofs. These houses are  
{attractive but are very expensive.    
{There is a great need in West Linton  
{for smaller houses for young married  
{people.
