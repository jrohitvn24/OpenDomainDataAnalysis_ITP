		<title>14Ceres Primary School</title>
		<content> The Primary School in Ceres  has  been
 in existence since 1836.  The original
 name,  Ceres  Parochial  Academy,   is
 carved in stone and can be seen  above
 the main entrance.  It  was  renovated
 in 1961 and additional classrooms were
 added.                                
  Today the school holds 86 pupils aged
 from five to twelve years.   There are
 four  class  teachers   and   visiting
 specialist teachers  of  Drama, Music,
 Art and Craft and  Physical Education.
  After school,  interested  pupils can
 attend a gymnastics  club  and, during
 the winter months, a badminton club.  
  There are also  evening  classes  for
 adults from October to March each year
 in Keep Fit, Scottish Country Dancing,
 Piping, and Choral Singing. A total of
 about 60 people attend these classes.
