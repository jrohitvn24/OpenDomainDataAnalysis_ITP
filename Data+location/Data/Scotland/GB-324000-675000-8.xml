		<title>08LEITH'S FUTURE</title>
		<content> A Redevelopment aims to encourage     
 investment, industrial growth and     
 the improved appearance of Leith. This
 is best shown by landscaping and the  
 conservationn of the Leith walkways.  
 House building by both sectors has    
 been given priority as long as their  
 designs are sympathetic to the        
 surrounding area.  All agencies must  
 conform with set regulations governing
 density and recreational ground.      
 Industry and commerce have not been   
 ignored.  Both are being safeguarded; 
 growth is being encouraged and Leith  
 Docks are being developed for port    
 related industries.                   
 Conservation is another priority.     
 Leith has 270 listed buildings and    
 their historical and architectural    
 character must not be impaired. There 
 are 28 sites to be developed and the  
 10 year plan is now half completed.   </content>
