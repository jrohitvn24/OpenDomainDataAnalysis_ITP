		<title>13THE ARTISTS</title>
		<content> The small fishing village of          
 Catterline has been the home of at    
 least five artists.Everyone of them   
 has fallen in love with the place as  
 soon as they set eyes on it.It is what
 you could call an artists haven, the  
 picturesque countryside being the     
 ideal setting for the artists to paint
 pictures of.We still have one artist  
 living in Catterline who has turned an
 old house on a cliff into an artists  
 studio.One of the artists who is now  
 dead is said to be one of Scotland's  
 greatest artists.Catterline is an     
 exciting place from an artist's point 
 of view.
