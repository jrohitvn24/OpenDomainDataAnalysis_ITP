		<content> Landscape: rocky coastline, islands,  
 undulating moorland,hamlet of         
 Badachro. people: some work locally   
 in fishing and in the Inn.  Many rely 
 on the seasonal tourist trade, letting
 caravans, houses, boats and going bed 
 an breakfast.  Others work away,      
 wherever work can be found.  The      
 community relies heavily on           
 Gairloch:there is only one local      
 shop/post office.  the mobile bank    
 calls fortnightly.  There is a small  
 amount of peat cutting for fuel.      
 Sheep roam the moor, which is owned by
 conon Estate, Inverness. there are    
 many pleasure boats, private yachts in
 the sheltered bay.  The jetting is a  
 focal point for visitors.  Boats are  
 for hire. The schools and shops are in
 gairloch 7 miles away. Further        
 education is even further!
