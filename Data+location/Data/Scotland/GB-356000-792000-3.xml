		<title>03THE FARQUHARSON FAMILY.</title>
		<content> As far back as 1382 one of the clan   
 was raiding the Forest of Birse       
 but land was not acquired until 1579  
 when{Donald Farquharson}purchased     
 Tillygarmont. He was the son of Finlay
 More,killed at the Battle of Pinkie,  
 bearing the Scottish standard.        
 The second{Donald,of Tillygarmont},   
 was killed in Aberdeen in 1645.His    
 nephew built Finzean House in 1686.   
 In 1708 Finzean was made a barony by  
 Queen Anne and the lands gradually    
 increased to over 40,000 acres by     
 1820.The family is now represented by 
 Alison Mary Farquharson,the 15th      
 Farquharson of Finzean.Her son        
{Donald's}coming of age is being       
 celebrated in Finzean Hall this year. 
 Will his descendants inherit the      
 still almost intact barony 100 years  
 on?                                   
                                       </content>
