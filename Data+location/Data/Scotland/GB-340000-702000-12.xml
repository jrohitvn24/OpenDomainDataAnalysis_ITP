		<title>12Strathairly game farm.</title>
		<content> The Strathairley game farm was set up 
 in 1970 and deals mainly with         
 pheasants and small numbers of        
 partridges. Partridges are bought as  
 eggs,hatched and then sold. The       
 pheasants are mostly of the English   
 ring neck variety.                    
 The game farm has an area of 45.2 h.a.
 but only half is used to rear the     
 birds as the area has a rotation plan.
 One area will grow barley one year and
 the other will be used to rear the    
 birds.This rotation is followed each  
 year.                                 
 All British pheasants were originally 
 introduced from Tibet and a great many
 now live in the wild having been      
 introduced by man in the past.The     
 farming area at the present time is   
 used for one large rearing field and  
 two smaller mixed pens for older      
 birds.                                </content>
