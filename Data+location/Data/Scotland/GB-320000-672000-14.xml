		<title>14RAVELSTON HOUSE,EDINBURGH.</title>
		<content>{ Ravelston House}in 1685 was the home 
 of Sir John Foulis and his eleven     
 children so it knew the sound of      
 children's voices.                    
   Today in 1985,it still rings with   
 this sound,the children now being the 
 pupils of the{Mary Erskine School}for 
 Girls.In the basement are sewing rooms
 and kitchens,upstairs are music rooms 
 and tucked under the roof is the      
 equipment room of the Radio Club.Other
 rooms are used for language practice,a
 Fiction Library,VIth Form Common Room 
 and a reception suite for important   
 visitors.                             
  Alongside the house is the modern    
 building that houses the rest of the  
 school.It is surrounded by playing    
 fields.From all points comes the sound
 of children's voices.Sir John would be
 pleased his home was still in use.
