		<content> The second area offers a distinct     
 difference from the first. In many    
 ways it offers a goldmine of          
 information and evidence to the       
 student of industrial archaeology. The
 broad but gently flowing River Almond 
 provided the source of power and water
 supply necessary to develop a         
 successful textile industry.          
 A local told us how, in the not too   
 distant past, the mills provided work 
 for most of the local inhabitants,    
 both male and female. The entire      
 process of the production of linen to 
 dying and distribution was carried on 
 in the various factory units.         
 Today, all that remains is the        
 derelict shell of the Pitcairnfield   
 works, the tram tines for moving      
 batches of cloth to the dying works   
 and several lades, weirs and water    
 wheels.                               </content>
