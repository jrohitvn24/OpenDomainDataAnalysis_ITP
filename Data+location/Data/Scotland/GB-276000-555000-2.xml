		<title>02Ingleston Farm</title>
		<content> Ingleston Farm is a beef and sheep    
 farm mainly, but they also grow crops 
 like silage, barley, hay and grass.   
 They have got blue-grey Hereford and  
 Charolais cows. The owners of the     
 farm have a lot of machinery and some 
 of it is contracted out in certain    
 seasons.                              
 Most of the trees on the farm are     
 deciduous, and have been grown as     
 shelter-belts.                        
 There are six people living on the    
 farm. They employ one worker. He lives
 in a cottage at the bottom of the     
 road. The two children who live on the
 farm do take an interest in the farm  
 by helping with chores.               
 The original farmhouse was built about
 1700.  Nowadays, visitors, mostly old 
 aged pensioners and young families    
 visit the house as bed and breakfast  
 facilities are available.             </content>
