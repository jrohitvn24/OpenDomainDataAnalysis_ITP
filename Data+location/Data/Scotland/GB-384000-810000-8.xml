		<title>08Wayfaring and Orienteering</title>
		<content>    {Wayfaring}is a Forest Walk with a 
 difference. Instead of following a    
 rigid and established path, one can   
 choose one's own route between various
 fixed control points, using a map as  
 the basis of your decision. It can be 
 as difficult or as easy as desired.   
    {Orienteering}is merely a highly   
 competitive variation of this. It was 
 introduced about 15 years ago from    
 Scandinavia. It can described as a    
 mixture of Cross-country running and  
 Map-reading. The object is for the    
 competitor to navigate round a        
 previously unknown route in the       
 shortest possible time. To prevent    
 "following", competitors are generally
 started out at one minute intervals   
 and forests are the most popular      
 habitat because they limit visibility.
