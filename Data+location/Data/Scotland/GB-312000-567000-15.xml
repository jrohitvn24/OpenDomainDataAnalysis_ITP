 estate.                               
                                       
 Every year{10 acres of new trees}are  
 planted. Fences have to be erected to 
 keep out deer which would damage the  
 young trees. A{gamekeeper}is employed 
 by the estate to keep down the pests  
 such as{rabbits}which would eat the   
 very young trees.                     
                                       
 The estate grows mainly{softwoods}such
 as{Spruce, Pine and Larch.}In the     
 making of the finished product a great
 deal of waste wood is left. The       
 smaller the size of the product, the  
 smaller the size of the waste wood.   
 This waste wood is very hard to       
 dispose of. Most of the waste wood is 
 sold to firewood merchants who in turn
 sell it the public.
