		<title>08ROADS OF FORFAR</title>
		<content>{Main Roads}The Carnoustie route no.is 
 A958.Another of the popular routes is 
 the Perth Road which runs through     
 Glamis, 3 miles from Forfar.The route 
 no.is A94.                            
{By-Pass}Forfar is going to have a     
 by-pass in about 2 years.Digging      
 work is about to start now.It will    
 join up the Dundee and Brechin roads  
 with a loop so that heavy vehicles    
 will not have to go through Forfar and
 the road won't be so busy.            
{Safety/Danger}Safety in Forfar is     
 quite a problem with its narrow,      
 twisting streets and hills.The Dundee 
 Loan is a hazard area and is worth    
 improving.The Dundee-Forfar-Brechin   
 road is one of the busiest in Tayside 
 and is quite dangerous with heavy     
 lorries, but we hope the new by-pass  
 will soon solve all that.
