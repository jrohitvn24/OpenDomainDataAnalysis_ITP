 old Caledonian Railway and was taken  
 over by British Rail, before finally  
 closing in 1967.                      
 All the goods previously carried by   
 the railway are now carried by road   
 transport and Loanleven farm is served
 by a variety of vans and lorries which
 take in farm supplies and carry away  
 all the farm produce.
