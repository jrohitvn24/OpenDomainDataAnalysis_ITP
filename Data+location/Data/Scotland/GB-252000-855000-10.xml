		<content> Most of the land in our Domesday Area 
 is used for agriculture,in fact,      
 seventy per cent of the land in our   
 Domesday block is agricultural land.  
 The most common crop is barley which  
 is used in the whisky making industry 
 and for the winter feeding of cattle. 
 Another extensievlygrown crop is      
 potatoes.The bulk of this crop is     
 grown for seed potatoes.The reason for
 this is that the soil in this area is 
 free from insects,like eel worm,which 
 attacks crops.On Brahan Estate they   
 grow new varieties, starting from stem
 cuttings. Very few cattle are kept    
 ,but sheep are brought in from the    
 out lying areas for fattening over the
 winter time .Farming is very highly   
 mechanised and as a result the number 
 of men working on the land is quite   
 small compared with fifty years ago.
