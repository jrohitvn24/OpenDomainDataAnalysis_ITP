		<title>20Dalkeith and Jarnac</title>
		<content> Twinning arrangements between Dalkeith
 and the French town of Jarnac were    
 forged 25 years ago.                  
                                       
 Activities are based mainly on the    
 exchange of pupils. During exchange   
 visits pupils stay in private homes.  
 Pen pals are an essential feature. The
 rugby clubs have close links. Many    
 individual families have entered into 
 private arrangements and there have   
 even been two marriages as a result of
 these links.                          
                                       
 1985 is the 25th Anniversary of the   
 link. Some 60 people from Jarnac came 
 over to attend the Week of Celebration
 and a similar number from Dalkeith    
 are to visit Jarnac.
