		<title>02ACROSS THE SEA TO IRELAND</title>
		<content> Stranraer to Larne, thirty three      
 miles, is one of the shortest         
 commercial sea routes to Ireland.The 3
 ferries currently using this route are
 the Antrim Princess,The Galloway      
 Princess and the Darnia.The Antrim    
 Princess is named after County Antrin 
 in Ireland,The Galloway Princess is   
 named after our region in Scotland. A 
 former ferry on this route,The        
 Caledonian Princess was named after   
 Caledonia;an ancient name for         
 Scotland.Originally in 1662 the cross 
 channel service was between           
 Portpatrick and Donaghadee, but in    
 1861 a private company was formed     
 witha view to running a service       
 between Stranraer and Larne to connect
 with the railway on the Scottish side 
 and the recently opened Carrickfergus 
 and Larne railway on the Irish side.
