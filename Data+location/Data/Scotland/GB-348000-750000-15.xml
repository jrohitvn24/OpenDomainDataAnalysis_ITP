		<content> The large stone building adjacent to  
 the Priory was built by a family trust
 in 1970 mainly for research and{      
{information systems.}It houses the    
 Scottish history{Library}provided by  
 the Graham Hunter Foundation and a    
 small number of museum exhibits,      
 including armour and swords. Two      
 members of the Hunter Family are      
 residential custodians of Restenneth  
 Library. The Hunter{Charitable Trust  
 have hosted Historical Society        
 meetings, Seminars, and{Conferences,  
 and on average, some 500 visitors come
 to the Library annually.              
 Funding had been made available to    
 complete the "Dictionary of the Older 
 Scottish Tongue" which will be a very 
 valuable work for students doing      
 Historical Research and a Scottish /  
 American exchange student scholarship.
