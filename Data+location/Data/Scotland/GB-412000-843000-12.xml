		<title>12PETERHEAD LIFEBOAT STATION</title>
		<content> The lifeboat service has been in      
 Peterhead for over 110 years. The     
 latest lifeboat,the James and Mariska 
  Joicey,has been in service since     
 1969.It is Arun  54'.When it was      
 bought in 1969,it cost Â£70 000.       
  Nowadays it would be worth over Â£430 
 000.The boat has 7 crew members who   
 are all unpaid volunteers.The lifeboat
 station is situated on Lodge Walk.The 
 steep slipway goes straight into the  
 South Bay.When an emergency           
 arises,the crew are alerted by two    
 loud bangs made by maroons. They rush 
 down to the station along with many   
 other Peterhead people who come to    
 watch the launch of the James and     
 Mariska Joicey.
