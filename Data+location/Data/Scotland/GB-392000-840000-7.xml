		<title>07HOUSES IN AUCHNAGATT.</title>
		<content>  As a part of our Domesday Project we 
 have to find out about "Houses in     
 Auchnagatt".                          
  There aren't any housing estates in  
 Auchnagatt.There are just two small   
 streets of Council houses.            
  Some peoples' houses are also used   
 for business.Jacky Brown's house he's 
 an Electrician,George Taylor uses part
 of his house as a shop.The Post Office
 and the hotel,all of these are used   
 for buisness.                         
 Just past the Council houses,oppisite 
 the playing field there are some      
 separate houses most of them have     
 different styles.One house has a      
 mansard roof 2 houses have pointed    
 windows and the others are the        
 same.There are about 6 council houses 
 in 1 row just left of the school.     
 There are not many houses in          
 Auchnagatt.                           </content>
