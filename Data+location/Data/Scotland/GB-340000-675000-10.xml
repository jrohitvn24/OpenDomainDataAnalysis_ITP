		<content> Old forms of the name {COCKENZIE}     
 were COWKENNY or COKENNY. Some people 
 still pronounce it COKENNY. The place 
 began as 2 rows of Fishermen's homes  
 on either side of a dirt track near   
 the shore.  There was a natural       
 harbour there protected by the rocks  
 or craigs.  It became a {BURGH}in 1592
 by permission of King James 1V.       
 Several harbours have been destroyed  
 by storms, the worst being in 1635.   
 Fishermen now use Port Seton harbour  
 opened in 1880 rather than the older  
 Cockenzie harbour.  Former{INDUSTRIES}
 included coalmining, saltpanning,     
 pottery, glassmaking, flourmilling and
 lobster fishing.  A very old wooden   
 railway used to bring coal in bogies  
 to Cockenzie harbour for export.  Salt
 too was exported and about 9000       
 oysters daily used to be caught.
