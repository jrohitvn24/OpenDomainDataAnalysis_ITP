		<title>03The Future Of Farming,Alford</title>
		<content> The viability of the area depends on  
 the farming industry which at present 
 is going through a difficult time.    
 Agricultural grants and government    
 policies in food production tempted   
 many farmers to borrow heavily, which 
 is costly. Many now realise that a    
 change in support for rural industries
 must come and the era of maximum food 
 production is ending.Subsidies to grow
 food which the market does not need or
 want makes no sense.Many realise that 
 new policies for supporting rural     
 population will be sought by the      
 government and the E.E.C.Some farmers 
 assert they are sympathetic towards   
 wildlife conservation but this needs  
 to be demonstrated by practical steps.
 Poor hay and cereal harvests caused by
 the very wet summer of 1985 may       
 bankrupt some farmers.
