		<title>14The Airlie Drummer,Cortachy</title>
		<content> The drummer of Airlie met his death   
 when Airlie Castle was attacked by    
 Argyll and his men in 1640. He failed 
 in his task to give warning of the    
 attack and was locked in the tower    
 when the castle was set alight. As the
 castle burned, the beating of the drum
 eerily continued. It has been heard   
 several times since then. In 1849 in  
 Glen Isla, a guest of Lord Ogilvy     
 heard its beat.The following day Lord 
 Ogilvy's father,the Earl of Airlie    
 died in London.It was heard in        
 Scotland before the 8th Earl died in  
 Denver,Colorado and it is said that   
 Lady Airlie heard it repeatedly before
 her husband,the 9th Earl was killed   
 fighting in the Boer War.             
 Today the remains of the drum are at  
 Cortachy Castle.American guests       
 unfortunately removed the scorched    
 skin to keep as a souvenir.           </content>
