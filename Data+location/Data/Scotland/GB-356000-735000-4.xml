		<content>   A walk in the woods round about     
 reveals a variety of trees, plants    
 and wild-life.  We visited a wooded   
 area in May and here is what we found.
   The predominant tree was the        
{beech,}with its new coat of pale green
 leaves.  There were also some{birch   
 trees, and the occasional{hawthorn,   
{lime}and{sycamore.                    
   There were signs that birds had been
 nesting in the wood, as the shell of a
 blackbird's egg was found.{Sparrows,  
{blackbirds}and{wood pigeons}were      
 the most common birds seen.           
  {Daffodils}and{bluebells}were growing
 in places and the odd patch of        
{heather.                              
   It was rather damp underfoot and the
 ditches which ran through the wood    
 were full of water.  A thick layer of 
{moss}made the ground very soft and    
 springy.                              </content>
