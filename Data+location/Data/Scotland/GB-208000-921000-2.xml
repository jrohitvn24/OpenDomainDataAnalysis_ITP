		<content> There are two types of crafts people  
 operating in Assynt. Those who        
 practise their craft for a living and 
 those to whom it is essential. Of the 
 former, we have three businesses. One 
 is a gemcutter who uses 10% of local  
 stones to make his work, another is a 
 local weaver who learnt her craft as  
 an occupational therapy course        
 (although there is a history of       
 weaving in the area) &amp; the third which
 is a siversmithing firm. All rely on  
 the Tourist market, although the      
 siversmiths are wholesalers. Knitting 
 &amp; Sewing is practised widely in our   
 area and is equally essential because 
 we have no drapery or proper clothes  
 shops in Assynt. Some of the knitters 
 sell any excess work to the visitors. 
 The businesses are all one or two     
 person ventures providing essential   
 part-time employment during the summer</content>
