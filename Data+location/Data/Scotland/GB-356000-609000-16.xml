		<content>{FARMING(cont)}occasionally keep a cow 
 for domestic milk.A mixture of breeds 
 is kept:Ayrshire, Galloway,Hereford   
 and cross-breeds.Continental Breeds   
 have also been introduced,e.g.        
 Charolais and Limousin.As most of the 
 farmland in the block is part of      
 bigger estates it is hard to be       
 precise about numbers,but at the time 
 of our survey Hartshaugh for example  
 had 340 of various kinds of cattle    
 plus two bulls,and nearly 1000 sheep  
 in our area.Much hearding and         
 shepherding is done with the help of  
 skilful trained{BORDER COLLIE DOGS.   
{HENS}are commonly kept for eggs but   
 not on a commercial scale-similarly   
 some {GOATS}are kept for milk.{HORSES}
 are kept for transport on some hill   
 pastures,but mainly for fox-hunting   
 and pleasure.
