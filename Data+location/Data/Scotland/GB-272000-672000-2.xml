		<title>02CUMBERNAULD,WHERE I LIVE</title>
		<content> I live in Westfield ,an area in       
 Cumbernauld New Town.Cumbernauld was  
 built to house people from the{       
{"Glasgow Overspill"}.The Glasgow      
 Overspill scheme began about thirty   
 years ago to provide houses for people
 who could not find a house in the{    
{City of Glasgow.}There was not enough 
 land in Glasgow to build the number of
 houses which people needed so the     
 government began to build{New Towns}  
 away from the city.In 1955 the land   
 between Cumbernauld Village and       
 Condorrat Village was chosen as the   
 site for{Cumbernauld New Town.}Since  
 then the population has grown to      
 50,000 and should go to 70,000 by the 
 end of the century. When the new town 
 is complete it will have done its job 
 and provided a place to live for many 
 people whose roots are in Glasgow.
