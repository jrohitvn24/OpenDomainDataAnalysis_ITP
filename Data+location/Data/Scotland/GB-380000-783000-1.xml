		<title>01Carron Valley Fetteresso</title>
		<content> This block forms the middle section of
 the valley of the Carron Water and    
 comprises mostly agricultural land    
 interspersed with small blocks of     
 coniferous plantations.   To the N of 
 the Carron (running W to E) the land  
 rises steeply, forming the flanks of  
 afforested hills out with the block.  
 To the S the land rises more gently to
 culminate in Carmont Hill (236m) in   
 the SW corner, which has a heathland  
 summit.   A network of minor roads    
 runs through the area and also the    
 main Aberdeen-London railway,         
 following the Carron Valley.   Some   
 strips of deciduous woodland are next 
 to the river eg. at Auquhiries Farm.  
 Small farms and crofts are scattered  
 throughout the area and there are no  
 major industrial, residential or other
 developments.   The carron is a trout 
 river although an occasional spillage </content>
