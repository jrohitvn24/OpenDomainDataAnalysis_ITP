		<content> The Jubilee Hospital was opened in    
 1888. Today it houses a Cottage       
 Hospital, a Maternity wing and the    
 town's Health Centre. There are 4     
 wards; 2 surgical(male /female) and 2 
 medical(male/female). There are 64    
 nurses(staff) and the 4 local         
 doctors attend patients. If operations
 are done the surgeon travels from     
 Aberdeen. The 4 doctors consult in the
 Health Centre using the appointment   
 system, but they can  be called out to
 your home. The Maternity wing is a    
 separate building because it was      
 opened in 1890 as an isolation fever  
 unit. It consists of a 1 ward of 6    
 beds and other necessary rooms and    
 nurseries.                            
 17 babies have been born there this   
 year already and they provide         
 post-natal care for mothers who choose
 to have their babies in Aberdeen.     </content>
