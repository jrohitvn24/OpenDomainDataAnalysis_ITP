		<title>14St. Giles' Cathedral</title>
		<content> The crown spire of St.Giles is, after 
 the Castle, probably the most famous  
 landmark of Edinburgh's Old Town. St. 
 Giles' may claim to be the centre of  
 Scottish national life, for it is the 
 'High Kirk' (main church) of our      
 capital city.                         
 Here the great services of  the       
 Scottish nation take place. When she  
 stays at Holyrood, the Queen attends  
 the services here.                    
 Over 1000 years St. Giles' has seen   
 many developments in religion and     
 many historical events. Inside        
 are memorials to outstanding Scots of 
 the past. Recently a central sanctuary
 has been made so that the people can  
 meet around the Communion Table. A    
 modern stained glass window, depicting
 the life of the poet Robert Burns, has
 just replaced an outworn one above the
 east door.                            </content>
