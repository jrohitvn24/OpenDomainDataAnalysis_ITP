		<title>01The Isle of May</title>
		<content> The Isle of May is the outermost of   
 the several rocky islands in the Firth
 of Forth. The island lies 8km (5miles)
 south-east of the Fife coast and 17km 
 (11miles) north of the East Lothian   
 coast. The island is 550m wide and    
 1600km long, its axis runs north-west 
 - south-east and it covers an area of 
 57ha a tenth of which is bare rock.   
 The Isle is owned by the Northern     
 Lighthose Board and has been          
 designated as a National Nature       
 Reserve because of the large numbers  
 and varieties of birds which visit the
 island.                               
 A small section at the southern end of
 the Isle is not within this "Domesday"
 square (it is in square 03640696),    
 however, it is felt that the island   
 should be dealt with as a single      
 entity. The text for both squares will
 therefore be the same.                </content>
