		<title>04Lord Stair-Castle Kennedy</title>
		<content> Lord Stair visited our school and     
 answered questions.He said that       
 because Lochinch Castle is quite      
 new there are not lots of historical  
 items but there are some weapons,flags
 and animal trophies. He told us about 
 visits by The Queen,Prince Philip,    
 Prince Charles and Princess Anne.There
 are several trees planted to mark     
 these occasions.He has seen many      
 changes in the last 25 years          
 especially in the reduction of staff. 
 Instead of twenty gardeners there     
 are only three. The Gardens now open  
 to the public every day and Lord Stair
 rents out the pheasant and the deer   
 shooting.He told us hoe several plants
 have been developed at the Gardens    
 including the beautiful Lochinch      
 Buddliae.His favourite parts of the   
 Gardens depended on the seasons but he
 especially liked the red rhododendrons</content>
