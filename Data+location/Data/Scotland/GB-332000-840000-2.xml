		<content> Dufftown 3 main areas of employment.  
 Glenfiddich Distillery employs a large
 majority of the populaton because they
 not only have the distillery but also 
 the bottling plant.                   
 Similarily the other 5 distilleries   
 employ,between them, a fair ratio .   
 However,the 3 DCL distilleries: Glen_ 
 dullan,Mortlach and Convalmore have   
 had their operations scaled down in   
 the last year and hence have had to   
 make some workers redundant.          
 The other main employer in the area is
 J Walker and sons of Aberlour _the    
 makers of shortbread and biscuits.    
 There is limited employment in the    
 village  as many of the businesses are
 family run.
