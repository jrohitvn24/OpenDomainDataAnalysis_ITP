		<content> Kettle Produce was established in 1972
 when C.Samson took over management and
 it provides employment for many people
 in the area.From 1926 until 1972 the  
 farm grew sugar beet for the old sugar
 beet factory in Cupar.Between 1972 and
 1975 Kettle Produce{supplied          
{vegetables}to a cooperative called    
{Fife-Grow,}then went private.         
 The decision to specialise in         
 vegetables was reached because a gap  
 in the market  existed.               
  At the moment{300 people}are employed
 for picking,planting,packaging and    
 distributing the vegetables.They      
{supply vegetables throughout Scotland 
{and also France,Belgium and Spain.
