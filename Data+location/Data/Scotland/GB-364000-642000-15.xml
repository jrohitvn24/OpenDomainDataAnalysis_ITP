		<title>15A DAY IN MY LIFE 1985.</title>
		<content>  I usually wake up about 7.50am.I get 
 up and change then I go for my        
 breakfast.I make my bed.Then I have   
 breakfast and clean my teeth and      
 wash.After I go to the shop for my    
 playtime piece and buy a packet of    
 crisps.My brother and I muck about    
 until 8.55am and then wave goodbye to 
 mum and go to school which is just a  
 minutes walk from our house.At school 
 we have choir,recorders and our usual 
 work.After school I go home and put   
 the t.v. on until 6.00pm which is     
 childrens programme time.I have no    
 favourite programme.Then I go and play
 on my bike.Lastly guides from 7.00pm  
 to 9.00pm which involves games, crafts
 and easy ways of making               
 presents.Survival is learned at       
 guides.
