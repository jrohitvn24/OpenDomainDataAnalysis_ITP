		<title>20Decision Makers of Westhill</title>
		<content> The main decision makers of Westhill  
 are the College Council,the P.T.A.,   
 Senior Community Education, Rector of 
 the Academy,Westhill Residents        
 Association,Gordon District Council   
 and Grampian Regional Council. Most   
 decisions which are made are planning 
 or housing decisions,improving housing
 ,pupil and staff welfare and helping  
 the PTA and College Council.          
 The people who serve the area are a   
 mixture of new (one only ten days     
 service) and experienced (ten years   
 service).                             
 All of these people's organisations   
 have others to help them with         
 decisions; most are democratic ,being 
 made by a majority of people. All our 
 decision makers communicate regularly.
