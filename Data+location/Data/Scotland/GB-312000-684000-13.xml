		<title>13Fordell Railway</title>
		<content> The{Fordell Railway}ran between{St.   
{David's harbour}and{Fordell mines.    
 It was used for the purpose of        
 carrying coal from the pits at Fordell
 to St.Davids harbour.In{1833}the      
 wooden rails were replaced by iron    
 rails and a tunnel was built under    
 the main road, now the{A92.}In{1867}  
 steel rails replaced the iron ones    
 and the introduction of steam engines 
 proved benificial. The Fordell Railway
 was different from other railways in  
 the way that it had a{4'4"}gauge, and 
 this was continued right up until it  
 was closed in{1946.}In{April 1896     
 there was a fatal accident, when one  
 of the locomotives blew up killing two
 men. On the railway there were a      
 number of branch lines, one even      
 leading up to the rear of{Fordell     
{House.
