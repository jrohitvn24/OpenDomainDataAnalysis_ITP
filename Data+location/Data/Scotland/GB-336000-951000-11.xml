		<content> On a Friday night at Kirkhill Hall at 
 7.00pm we have our Scout meeting.First
 we have inspection and a flag break.A 
 few games are played and we have      
 badgework,where the leaders take us to
 different parts of the hall to teach  
 us different things,such as           
 mapping,knife and axe handling,first  
 aid,etc.                              
 The scouts somtimes raise money by    
 having jumble sales book_sales,       
 discos,and sponsored bike runs for    
 equipment,tents,and other things for  
 the Scouts and for other funds.A whole
 load of hockey,basketball,baseball and
 football equipment has just arrived at
 the hall so the Scouts and Cubs can   
 have a better time at playing         
 games.The meeting finishes at 9.30pm  
 and the flag is taken down.We clean   
 the hall before we go home.
