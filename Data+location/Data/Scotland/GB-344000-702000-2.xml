		<content>   The chief building material of      
 houses on the Main Street is black    
 whinstone. They are between 150 and   
 200 years old.  Most are double       
 storey, three windows over two and are
 joined to give a long terraced        
 formation.                            
  Two council housing schemes have been
 built since 1940's. They are all      
 double storey blocks of two houses and
 have harled wall exteriors.  Most are 
 rented out but a few have been        
 purchased by the occupiers.  There are
 eight pensioner houses.               
  With little private land to develop  
 only one modern bungalow has been     
 built in the last ten years.  Three   
 more have just been begun.
