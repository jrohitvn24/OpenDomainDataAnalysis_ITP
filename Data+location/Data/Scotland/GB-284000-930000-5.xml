		<content> One of the main hobbies is fishing.   
 There are several lochs to go fishing 
 on for trout and there is a part of   
 the River Helmsdale where local people
 can fish for salmon. Bird watching and
 horse riding are hobbies of two of the
 children in our school. C.B.radio and 
 computers are a great craze. Half the 
 population have C.B. radios. Some have
 them for their work and others for    
 keeping in touch with local news.     
 Television is what everyone depends on
 for their enjoyment. Two fathers of   
 children in our school are amateur    
 radio enthusiasts. Some older folks   
 like gardening and clay pigeon        
 shooting. The teenagers' hobbies are  
 scrambling on motor cycles and playing
 darts. Another hobby of some of the   
 children and teacher in our school is 
 gold panning. One can find gold in the
 burns near our school!                </content>
