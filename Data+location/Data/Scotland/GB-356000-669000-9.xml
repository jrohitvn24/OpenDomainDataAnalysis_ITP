		<title>09Garvald Church Congregation</title>
		<content> The congregation is united with that  
 of the neighbouring village of Morham 
 and linked with the West Church in    
 Haddington.  One Minister, who lives  
 in Haddington, serves all 3 churches  
 and services are held alternatively in
 Garvald and Morham. Holy Communion is 
 celebrated 4 times a year. The        
 attendance has increased recently and 
 there is an average congregation of 25
 adults and 12 children, who go out to 
 Sunday school in the second part of   
 the service. There are about 120 full 
 members of the congregation, half of  
 whom live in the parish. The          
 neighbouring stables are used for     
 socials and barbeques for the         
 congregation and groups who come out  
 from Edinborough etc. to enjoy a rural
 retreat. On Christmas Eve almost      
 everybody in the village joins in a   
 nativity and carols on the green.     </content>
