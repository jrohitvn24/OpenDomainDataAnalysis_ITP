		<content> My name is Jenny HENDERSON. I live    
 at Udale Farm, near Jemimaville on the
 Black Isle. In my family there is my  
 little brother John, my mum and my dad
 who runs the farm and breeds          
 Clydedales, a type of heavy horse like
 the Shire. I have sixteen pets which  
 are seven horses, four donkeys, two   
 tortoises, one cat, one dog and a     
 goldfish. I have plenty of things to  
 do. For instance I can go riding my   
 pony, play with my pets, go on bike   
 rides or get my friend Morven up from 
 the village. The surrounding          
 countryside is mostly all farmland or 
 woodland. The Black Isle is a nice    
 place to live and I would not like to 
 move from it. I have lived on the     
 Black Isle all my life although we    
 moved from near Conon-Bridge, where we
 had another farm, to Udale because    
 Udale is a bigger farm.               </content>
