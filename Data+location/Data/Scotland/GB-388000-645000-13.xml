		<title>13Norham County First School</title>
		<content> AGE RANGE 4-9yrs. 12 boys, 14 girls.  
 Two full-time teachers.               
 Norham school is one of the few       
 village schools left in the country.  
    Although the children are few- only
 26- they enjoy a full and varied      
 timetable, and the school itself plays
 an essential part in village life.    
    Some children live within walking  
 distance of school, others travel, via
 mini-bus, from farms within the 4 mile
 radius. Pre-school children attend a  
 nursery class 3 half-days per week.   
    The Parent/Teacher Association in  
 this small village school is very     
 active. Through-out the year it       
 organises fund raising and educational
 evenings which not only provide       
 valuable equipment for school but also
 establish a good working relationship 
 between parents and teachers.
