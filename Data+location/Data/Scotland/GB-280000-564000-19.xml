		<title>19HALLOWEEN - 31st OCTOBER</title>
		<content> Halloween is a time when people dress 
 up as witches etc.  The reason why is 
 that this is the time of year when    
 spirits are supposed to sneak into    
 peoples houses to warm themselves by  
 the fire.  Children go to houses      
 dressed up and sing a song or tell a  
 story.  The people in the houses give 
 them sweets or fruit for entertaining 
 them.  Sometimes you play a game in   
 which you duck your head into a basin 
 of water with apples in it, you try to
 get an apple with your teeth.  Some   
 people carve out the inside of a      
 turnip to make a lantern, they carve a
 face on it and put a candle inside.   
 In Scotland this is known as          
 'guising'.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
