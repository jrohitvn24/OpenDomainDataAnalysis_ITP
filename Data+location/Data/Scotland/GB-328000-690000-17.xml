		<title>17INDUSTRIES II - HUTCHISONS</title>
		<content> Hutchisons was founded in 1827 by     
 Robert Hutchison, but the members of  
 the Hutchison family had been trading 
 in Kirkcaldy in the nineteenth        
 century.The business was sold to Pauls
 &amp; Whites Ltd. of Ipswich in 1972 and  
 they in turn have been taken over by  
 Harrisons &amp; Crossfield in 1985.       
 Ninety nine people are employed at    
 Kirkcaldy in the two businesses of    
 malting and flour milling. The flour  
 mill uses 60,000 tonnes of wheat each 
 year - 6,000 is imported from Canada  
 and the remainder is home grown. The  
 flour produced is sold to biscuit     
 manufacturers and bakers throughout   
 Scotland. The maltings process 40,000 
 tonnes of barley each year, all grown 
 in east and central Scotland. The malt
 is sold mainly to distilleres and     
 brewers in Scotland and  north England
  although quite a lot is exported.    </content>
