		<content> The area is very rich in birds as it  
 has trees,fields, moorland and houses.
 There are many birds of prey because  
 they get smaller birds to kill here.  
 The most popular bird of prey is the  
 buzzard.  It eats smaller birds and   
 mice.  The peregrine falcon kills the 
 racing pigeons of a local resident.   
 Crows and rooks fly over the school.  
 There are waders such as curlews and  
 peewits.  Dippers live by the Fruin   
 and a kingfisher has been seen by     
 Cross Burn.  The heron is usually seen
 in a field near the Duchlage Farm.  At
 Muirland Cottages there are always    
 house martins and swallows. They come 
 about the end of April.  There are    
 many wood pigeons in the woods and the
 wood pecker can be heard. The tree    
 creeper can be seen running up and    
 down the trunks of trees.  There are  
 wagtails in the playground.           </content>
