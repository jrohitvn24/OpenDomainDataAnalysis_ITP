		<content> IN OUR FIRST YEAR AT SCHOOL A DOCTOR  
 COMES TO EXAMINE US AND EVERY NOW AND 
 AGAIN, 2 NURSES COME TO CHECK OUR HAIR
 AND FEET AND HANDS. WE ALSO HAVE      
 VISITS FROM A DENTIST, AN OPTICIAN AND
 A PERSON TO CHECK OUR HEARING. WE     
 SOMETIMES GET KITS FOR TEETH CARE FROM
 THE DENTIST, CONTAINING PILLS, A      
 TOOTHBRUSH AND TOOTHPASTE. THE PILLS  
 TEST HOW WELL WE BRUSH OUR TEETH. IN  
 THE BORDERS, THERE IS A HEALTH &amp;      
 FITNESS VAN WHICH COMES ROUND TO SEE  
 HOW FIT WE ARE AND TO TEACH US ABOUT  
 HEALTH AND FITNESS. WE DO ALL SORTS OF
 EXERCISES AND TESTS. IT IS GOOD FUN.  
                                       
 IN AN EMERGENCY, CHILDREN CAN BE      
 TRANSPORTED QUITE QUICKLY TO THE      
 NEAREST HEALTH CENTRE WHICH IS IN WEST
 LINTON AND HAS A STAFF OF 3 DOCTORS   
 AND 3 DISTRICT NURSES.
