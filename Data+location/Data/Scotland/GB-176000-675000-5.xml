		<title>05Games We Play At School</title>
		<content> At school we play lots of different   
 games. We skip, we play with bats and 
 balls, and we practise scoring goals  
 at football. We like to play hide and 
 seek too. The person who is "It",     
 closes his eyes, and the others go and
 hide.Then the person who is "It" tries
 to find the others and catch them.    
 Sometimes we play Rounders. We are    
 divided into 2 teams. One team bats   
 and one team fields the ball. The team
 who are batting hit the ball and try  
 to run right round the pitch before   
 the fielding team get the ball back.  
 They try to get the batsman out by    
 stumping the corners of the pitch or  
 by catching the ball before it touches
 the ground. When the batting team are 
 all out they change places with the   
 fielders. The team with the most      
 rounders wins.                        
                                       </content>
