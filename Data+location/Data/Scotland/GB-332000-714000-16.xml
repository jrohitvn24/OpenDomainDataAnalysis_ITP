		<title>16LOCAL HISTORY..KILMARON</title>
		<content> This once splendid house was built in 
 1794 to 1795 by Admiral Maitland, one 
 of Nelson's commanders. Prize money   
 was probably used to finance its      
 construction. Designed in the Gothic  
 revival style by the architect,       
 Gillespie Graham, the building        
 unfortunately had built-in design     
 defects which meant dry rot became a  
 chronically serious problem. The      
 owners of the house finally decided it
 was uninhabitable and it was          
 demolished in 1983. The estate land   
 around the old house site remains much
 as it was in the 19th century, with   
 distinctive open parkland and mature  
 trees. The attractive woodland on the 
 slopes to the North of the ruined     
 house adds to the quality of this     
 estate and though the house at        
 Kilmaron Castle is no longer with us, 
 we hope the estate is maintained.     </content>
