 oil man.He was born early in the 19th 
 Century in Glasgow.He became famous as
 the first man to refine oil from      
 coal.He is the real pioneer of todays 
 oil business. At one time he lived in

 very good friends with David          
 Livingstone,whom he financed          
 often in his work.When countries were 
 gasping for new fuels he came up with 
 the solution,paraffin,that is how he  
 got his name.He bought new lamps and  
 tested it,soon everyone had lights in 
 their homes.He kept hard at his       
 business and moved to West calder to  
 refine oil out of shale,it was a      
 success and the population grew as    
 people came for jobs.This was when the
 5 sisters were made from excess       
 shale.When he died he was buried in   
 Inverkip near Greenock,Scotland.      </content>
