		<content>{GLASGOW Z00}is owned by the Zoological
 Society of Glasgow and managed by Mr. 
 O'Grady.It sits in 170 acres of       
 woodland.The animals range from rats  
 to Indian elephants.The zoo's role is 
 partly educational and partly         
 conservational.Animals are bred as a  
 precaution against extinction.Students
 can see and study animals at close    
 quarters.The welfare of animals is    
 paramount and their diet is monitored.
 The animals are in excellent          
 condition.A vet visits three times a  
 week.The lion, Ranger is a            
 favourite,as are some industrious     
 porcupines.A new enclosure is under   
 construction for two tigers arriving  
 in June.Surplus animals are sold to   
 other zoos or exchanged.The zoo plans 
 to introduce further interesting      
 animals.
