		<content> We looked at the houses in our area   
 and we found that they were all built 
 of sandstone, apart from the council  
 houses, which were built of brick and 
 harling. We noticed that the seven    
 farmhouses were very large indeed and 
 had mostly been built towards the end 
 of the 19th. century or at the        
 beginning of this century.            
 There were 32 farm cottages belonging 
 to the farms, many of which are now   
 let as holiday homes.                 
 We have a total of 14 council houses, 
 none of whose tenants are connected   
 with farming.                         
 The rest of the houses in the area are
 privately owned.
