		<content>          {THE ROPE WALK               
  The  rope factory was a place where  
 they made ropes. It was at the back of
 our school.                           
 There is a path at the front of our   
 school which is 475 metres long.      
 It is situated near the part of       
 the factory where the people who      
 worked in the factory used to measure 
 the ropes from the start of the path  
 to the end which made the ropes 475   
 metres long.That is how the path got  
 its name.Also you can see a door and  
 two windows sills.
