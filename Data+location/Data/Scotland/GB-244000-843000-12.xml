		<title>12PRIMARY SCHOOL-TEANASSIE</title>
		<content> The school isn't a very big one.It has
 34 pupils and 2 teachers.5 pupils are 
 leaving this year to go to Charleston 
 Academy in Inverness.8 new pupils are 
 coming to school next session.We have 
 visiting art and music teachers, and a
 minister who comes once a week.We have
 a tuckshop which sells crisps and     
 lemonade.We had an experiment using   
 health foods,which worked quite well. 
 We have a big shinty pitch and a      
 playground.There's a big hill in part 
 of the playground which is great for  
 sledging on in winter.In the winter   
 time we come sliding down on old      
 fertilizer bags  and things like      
 that.We have good snowball fights.The 
 wee ones love making snowmen.Sometimes
 in winter time we don't get to school 
 because the roads are too bad and     
 snowploughs have to clear them.
