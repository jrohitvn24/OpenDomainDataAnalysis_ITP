		<title>17Housing in Kinross.</title>
		<content> Since the 1970's{housing}in Kinross   
 has grown, particularly at the north  
 end of the town. At present 4 private 
 estates are being constructed. The    
 size and style of these houses are    
 largely aimed at the 40%+ of residents
 who work elsewhere or who will move   
 here.{These people are mobile}in house
 and job, but give considerable support
 to local activities.{Development}of   
 the older areas near the town centre  
 have tried to keep its character,     
 notably the renovation of Parliament  
 Square.{Council housing}(35% of total)
 has not been increased recently but   
 land is allocated for it. Just over   
 10% of council-built houses have been 
 bought by their tenants.
