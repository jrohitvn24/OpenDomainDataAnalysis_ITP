		<content>  Many of the families in{Dalmilling   
{and Whitletts}district have lived here
 right from the time the houses were   
 built over thirty years ago.Perhaps   
 this is the reason why the people have
 strong feelings of{community spirit   
{and pride}in their home area.         
  Variety of design and of building    
 materials of the houses show the      
 various stages of the community's     
 development. Timber and prefabricated 
 framed houses were erected three years
 after the Second World War.The later  
 stages show the change to brick built 
 semi_detatched villas and bungalows,  
 houses with pebble_dash finish and    
 finally, blocks of flats,three storeys
 high.Special smaller one bedroomed    
 flats have been built for the elderly.
  For the past five years a programme  
 of renovation and upgrading has given 
 the area a new lease on life.         </content>
