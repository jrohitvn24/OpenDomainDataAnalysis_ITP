		<title>05FARMING AROUND MILTON.</title>
		<content> I live in the gamekeeper's cottage at 
 Balgonie Castle,1 km west of Milton.My
 dad is the farm mechanic.Bellfield,   
 Bankhead,Duniface,Balfour Mains,Little
 Lun,Grantsfield and Cameron farms are 
 in our block,and much of Byresloan,   
 Treaton and Newton Hall.The McKendrick
 family,farming Bellfield and Cameron, 
 have prize winning{friesian dairy  }  
{herds.}All farms are now growing a    
 little{oil seed rape,}but,apart from  
 Duniface where crops grow,the rest are
 mainly cattle farms.Bellfield cows    
 have been inside all winter but now   
 they are in the fields beside the     
 school.Sometimes a field is let to a  
 shepherd.I went to see the{sheep}being
 dipped in a long pool.They went in at 
 one end and out at the other.The      
 shepherd pushed their heads under once
 with his crook to make sure they were 
 all disinfected.                      </content>
