		<content> There are 14 active quarries in N.E.  
 Fife and of these, 8 quarries for sand
 and gravel. Quarries cover 4.5% of    
 this D_Block. Kinloch Quarry (owned by
 Pioneer Aggrigates, an Australian     
 firm) covers an area of 22.1 hectares.
 It started in 1981 and has an         
 operational life of 8_10 years. 2     
 million tonnes of sand and gravel are 
 to be quarried.                       
 This quarry produces on average, 1000 
 tonnes a day. The operation is highly 
 mechanised and only 7 people are      
 employed on the site.                 
  90% of the sand and gravel is used in
 making concrete and is sent to firms  
 in Leven, Perth and Dundee.The rest is
 sold to local building firms and to   
 Scottish Gas who use it for bedding   
 their gas pipelines.
