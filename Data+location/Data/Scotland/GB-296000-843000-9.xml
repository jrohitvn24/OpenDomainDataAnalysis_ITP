		<title>09A FERNESS PUPIL'S DAY</title>
		<content>    I wake at about 6am when my dad    
 gets up. He is a shepherd and we live 
 on a small hill out in the country.   
 There is only one house near us. I get
 up at 7am and have my breakfast.      
 Afterwards I wash and dress. Between 8
 and 9am I feed my rabbit Blackie and  
 ride my bicycle.                      
    My school is 5 miles away. A car   
 picks me up at the end of our road    
 just after 9am. School begins at      
 9:30am.                               
    Because I live so far from school I
 have to stay for lunch. School        
 finishes at 3:30pm and the car takes  
 me home.                              
   I am an only child and none of my   
 friends live near so I have to play by
 myself or help my dad until 6pm when  
 we have our meal. I do my homework and
 watch TV until going to bed at 9pm.
