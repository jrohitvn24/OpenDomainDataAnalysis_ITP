		<title>04Road to Rhenigidale.</title>
		<content> The village of Rhenigidale is         
 surrounded by hills rising at the     
 highest point to{TODDUN}528m. The     
 primary land cover is uncultivated    
 non-woodland vegetation. There are    
 also extensive peat areas. The        
 villagers make a living by part time  
 employment and crofting. Sheep are    
 kept and this is the main source of   
 income. Some crops are grown for the  
 crofters and animals own use. For many
 years the villagers have been         
 campaigning for an access road to the 
 village. The isolation makes life here
 very difficult but the villagers were 
 determined to stay. This year work has
 finally begun on the first phase of a 
 road in from Maaruig. This phase,     
 covering 2 miles will be of a high    
 standard and will cost the{Western    
{Isles Islands Council}Â£500,000 but it 
 is worth every penny to the villagers.</content>
