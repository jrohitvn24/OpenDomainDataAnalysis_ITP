		<content> Under the entry "LINDEAN" a modern    
 gazetteer of Scotland merely adds:    
 "Ancient parish embraced by Galashiels
 parish". Long before the parochial    
 system was introduced or the place    
 name bestowed,hunters and fishers had 
 fashioned their flints on a bluff     
 overlooking the River Tweed near its  
 confluence with Ettrick Water.In or   
 about the first century B.C.native    
 tribesmen built forts on the summits  
 of local hills,e.g.,The Rink and      
 Cauldshiels.Early in the 12th         
 century,Prince David made a gift of   
 land near the burgh of Selkirk        
 -Selkirk Abbatis- to missionary monks 
 in the hope that they would use it as 
 the site of an abbey.They preferred a 
 more suitable site at Kelso and part  
 of -Selkirk Abbatis- was used as the  
 site of a parish church,originally of 
 Lindean and later of Galashiels.      </content>
