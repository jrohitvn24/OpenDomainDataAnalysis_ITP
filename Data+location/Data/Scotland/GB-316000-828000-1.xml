		<content>    This beautiful area is on the banks
 of the rivers Avon and Livet which are
 renown for good salmon fishing. It was
 here  that  the  first  legal   whisky
 distillery was built in 1822 and it is
 still in  production. Two hotels cater
 for   tourists  who   can  visit   the
 Reception Centre  from  where they are
 guided through the  distillery  before
 sampling  'The Glenlivet'  whisky. The
 waste  products  from  distilling  are
 processed  into  animal  feed  at  the
 drying plant  beside  the  distillery.
 These two industries provide the major
 source  of  employment  in  the  area.
 House for the  workforce surround  the
 distillery  and  nearby  is  the local
 Primary   School,   secondary   pupils
 having  to  travel  to Aberlour. There
 are no shops,  just a Post Office, but
 vans come weekly with  basic supplies.
 The surpunding countryside is farmed. </content>
