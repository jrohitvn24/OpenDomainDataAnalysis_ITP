		<content> The fault line which divides the      
 southern uplands from the central     
 lowlands runs across the area from    
 N.E. to S.W. The south east corner is 
 underlaid with hard ordovician rocks  
 that can be seen in the Thorter Glen. 
 Most of the rest of the base rock is  
 old red sandstone but volcanic rock   
 outcrop on the law knowles north of   
 the village.The rocks are overlaid    
 with glacial gravels which although   
 stoney provide good farming land. The 
 volcanic outcrops has poor pasture    
 used by ponies. The drainage pattern  
 is a result of post glacial erosion,  
 deep channels have been cut through   
 the gravels, one of these is occupied 
 by the Papana river. In places it has 
 cut into the soft sandstone as can be 
 seen on the steep south bank. The flat
 bottom of the Papana valley is covered
 with gravels and makes a flood plain. </content>
