		<title>15FRC DEPOT</title>
		<content> The FRC Depot in Carnock Road is the  
 Roads Depot for Dunfermline District. 
 There are also Water and Drainage     
 Depots in the area. Every vehicle has 
 its own radio for contact with the    
 offices. In winter, which is the      
 busiest time of year, there are two   
 shifts _ day shift and night shift.   
 The workforce of ninety includes      
 mechanics, foremen, drivers and office
 workers.In winter  some of the lorries
 are fitted with snow ploughs to clear 
 roads that are blocked with snow.     
 Gritters are called out to grit roads 
 when the tempature falls below a      
 certain number of degrees. This helps 
 to prevent accidents on icy roads. The
 lorries supply tar and tools for road 
 mending. The JCB digs out ditches,    
 tracks and drainage channels.
