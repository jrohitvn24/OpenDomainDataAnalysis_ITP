		<title>12GATHERING WHELKS</title>
		<content>  Several stony beaches in this block  
 are used by local Whelk Collectors    
 particulary Balichladich and Culkein. 
   Whelk collecting is very hard and   
 cold work. Waiting for low tide you   
 gather suitable sized whelks in a     
 bucket. A good whelk might weigh about
 2 grams. You then transfer them into  
 sacks of about 50kg. in weight.  These
 porous sacks are then placed in water 
 to keep the whelks alive.             
   About once a fortnight the whelk    
 buyer comes up and may offer the      
 collector Â£12- Â£22  per sack depending
 on the season and the quality of the  
 whelks.                               
   However this season the demand must 
 have been great as some travelling    
 whelk collectors came into this area  
 and cleaned out the beaches leaving   
 little shellfish left for the local   
 collectors.                           </content>
