		<content>{Curing a Sore}                        
 Long ago to cure a sore, a piece of   
 meat would be put on it.Some strange  
 gaelic words were said and then the   
 piece of meat would be buried! If the 
 sore didn't heal the meat was said to 
 be too fatty.                         
{The Island Of Eilean Hoan             
 Just off Durness is the small         
 uninhabited island of Eilean Hoan. On 
 this small island are the remains of  
 an old graveyard. Long ago when       
 vicious wolves roamed the Highlands   
 the people of Durness buried their    
 dead on the island. They feared the   
 wolves would dig up the graves and eat
 the bodies if they were buried on the 
 mainland.                             
{The Missing Dog                       
  One day a dog fell into Smoo Cave.   
 Some time later the dog appeared at   
 Sarsgrum with no hair on it's body.   </content>
