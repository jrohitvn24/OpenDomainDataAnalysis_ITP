		<title>19THE CLIMATE OF ESKDALEMUIR</title>
		<content> Featured so often in the weather      
 reports as the coldest or wettest     
 place in Britain .The climate would   
 appear to be unusually undesirable but
 fortunately there are long hours of   
 sunshine.                             
  In 1908 a meteorological station was 
 set up at an elevation of 800ft .     
 Records of all aspects of the weather 
 are compiled here.The average rainfall
 is between 55 and 60 inches. Snowfalls
 can be expected most winters.Severe   
 and gale force winds have been been   
 recorded in every month of the year.  
  Heavy rainfall results in the        
 flooding of fields as the tributaries 
 of the Esk rush down and swell the    
 rising river. Flockmasters remove     
 sheep and cattle to higher ground.    
  Snow brings hazards , icy roads and  
 snow bound homesteads, but main roads 
 are kept open by local snow ploughs.  </content>
