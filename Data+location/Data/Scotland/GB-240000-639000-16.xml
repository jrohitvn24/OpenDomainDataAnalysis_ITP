		<title>16Kilmaurs Gala Week (1)</title>
		<content> The village Gala Week, which is       
 financed by the villagers and         
 Community Association, is usually held
 in the first week in June. Prior to   
 this, the local Primary 7 children    
 meet and write an essay on a given    
 subject, usually concerned with the   
 village.                              
 The girl whose essay is judged to be  
 the best is the Gala Queen for that   
 year, the two runners-up being her    
 attendants.                           
 The boy whose essay is chosen is the  
 Champion and he has one helper.       
 "Miss Kilmaurs", "Mini Miss" and      
 "Teeny Miss" are elected at discos.   
                                       
 Celebrations, which continue          
 throughout the week, include tennis   
 and bowling tournaments, discos,fancy 
 dress competition, puppet show and    
 concert.                              </content>
