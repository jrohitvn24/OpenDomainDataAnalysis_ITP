		<content> Mrs. Martin has great memories of the 
 time she was at Crookedholm Primary   
 School. She started in 1911. The      
 headteacher was Mr. Adam Duncanson and
 she remembers him with great respect. 
 The school hours were from 9am to 4pm.
 Her favourite subject was Music and   
 her worst was parsing and analysis.   
 She lived at the Granary, Mill Lane.  
 During the war the school helped by   
 growing vegetables in the front       
 garden. Mr Paton, who lived at        
 Templeton Burn, gave picnics at       
 Templeton Burn and Xmas trips to the  
 Palace Theatre for Pantomimes. Boys   
 and Girls had separate playgrounds and
 didn't mix. The punishment was the    
 strap. At playtime they played        
 peevers, skipping and ball games. Mrs.
 Martin loved school and wanted to go  
 to the Academy but there was          
 fee-paying. She became a receptionist.</content>
