		<title>17 East Fife Football Team</title>
		<content> Bayview Park is the home ground of    
 East Fife our local football team.    
    The pitch was opened in 1903,a lot 
 of the work done voluntarily by fans. 
 It is in good condition,often playable
 when bad weather closes other pitches.
 The stadium holds 10000 people.The    
 grandstand, built in 1922 holds 1000. 
 It is needing rebuilt and they may be 
 able to if the government give clubs  
 money to help with new regulations set
 down after the Bradford City fire     
 disaster when over fifty people died. 
   The teams best days were just before
 and after the 1939-45 war.In 1938 they
 were the only 2nd division team to win
 the Scottish cup.Charlie Fleming,Alan 
 Brown and Henry Morris have played for
 them and only recently they sold      
 Gordon Durie to Hibs.They have avoided
 relegation to the 2nd division this   
 year.Well done the Black and Golds!   </content>
