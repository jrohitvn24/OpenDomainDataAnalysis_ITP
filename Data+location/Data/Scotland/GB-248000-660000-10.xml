		<content>{ A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LAURA           
 During Morning Interval we played{High
{Tig,}someone goes chaser and tries to 
 tig people who are on low ground.     
 Everyone on high ground is safe but   
 if the chaser manages to tig someone  
 that person has to be chaser.         
 During lunch hour we played{          
{Kiss,Cuddle or Torture.}-The boys     
 chase the girls and if they manage to 
 catch one they say Kiss,Cuddle or     
 Torture?                              
 Whatever the girl chose the boy did.  
 Everyone usually chooses torture.     
 After school I watched television-John
 Craven's Newsround and Emmerdale Farm.
 After tea my dad and I took my sister 
 Donna down to the{Fairway Club}which  
 is for handicapped, disabled and      
 able-bodied children.
