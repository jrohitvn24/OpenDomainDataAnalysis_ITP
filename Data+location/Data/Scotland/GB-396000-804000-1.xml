		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO OUR D-BLOCK</title>
		<content> The D-block is predominately sea and  
 harbour but also includes the coast-  
 line of Girdleness and Nigg Bay. The  
 small portion of land included is     
 primarily recreational comprising a   
 golf course,a park and part lies      
 within the boundaries of a 'Country   
 Park'.The land is mainly farmland and 
 heath.The coastline at Nigg Bay is of 
 significant geological value and is   
 used by the University for fieldwork. 
 The area is also steeped in history   
 and contains Bronze Age cairns,13th   
 Century church remains and more recent
 Napoleonic fortifications.            
 Tar area once supported a prosperous  
 quarrying industry employing almost   
 700 people in the late 1700's.Salt was
 panned and iodine manufactured from   
 seaweed during this time as well.It is
 the sea rather than the land which is 
 now of industrial significance.       </content>
