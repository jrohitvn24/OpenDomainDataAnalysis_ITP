		<title>12Fernie Castle.</title>
		<content> The first castle at Fernie was        
 recorded in 1353.                     
 Up until 1965, when it was turned into
 a hotel, the castle only had 3 owners.
 You can still see the fortified tower 
 with slit windows and, in the grounds,
 a large ice house once used for       
 keeping food fresh.                   
 The hotel has 15 bedrooms and attracts
 many visitors from abroad and mainly  
 America and Japan.                    
 They employ 18 people - 3 in the      
 kitchen, 3 at reception, 2            
 housekeepers, 2 gardeners and some    
 student helpers.  Few of these are    
 resident in the area.                 
 The castle is set in attractive       
 grounds where the owners hope to grow 
 sufficient vegetables to supply the   
 hotel kitchen.
