{Screaming Skull of Greyfriars},the    
 head of a monk which still haunts his 
 old monastery in St. Andrews.Then     
 there is{The White Lady}who was one of
 Mary Stuart's Maries .When her        
 sweetheart was beheaded she became a  
 nun and died of grief. She haunts the 
 square tower in the Abbey wall now    
 known as The Haunted Tower.One of the 
 most famous ghosts of St. Andrews is {
{The Veiled Nun of St. Leonards.}She   
 was a beautiful young girl who became 
 a nun to avoid marrying a young man   
 who had fallen in love with her.When  
 he went to find her he found that she 
 had disfigured her beauty by slitting 
 her nostrils, cutting off her top and 
 bottom lips and branding her cheeks.  
 The young man committed suicide and   
 the girl died from grief and remorse. </content>
