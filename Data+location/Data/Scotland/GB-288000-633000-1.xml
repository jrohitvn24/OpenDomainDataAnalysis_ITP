		<title>01Land around Howgate Hill</title>
		<content> This is a quiet peaceful area of grass
 covered rolling hills, cultivated     
 fields, grazing animals and few       
 inhabitants. The major features are   
 Howgate Hill (444m) and part of the   
 village or Rigside which is the only  
 area of concentrated population. The  
 and consists of hills covered in rough
 grass and fenced pasture land where   
 large numbers of sheep and beef cattle
 are grazed.Crops of wheat, barley, oil
 seed rape are grown as well as grass  
 for silage and hay. There are also    
 area of young and newly planted       
 conifers on Howgate Hill.             
 The inhabitants either live on the two
 farms or part of the village of       
 Rigside, which is now mainly inhabited
 by retired miners or those who        
 commute. The village offers few       
 amenities with only a few shops and a 
 limited bus service                   </content>
