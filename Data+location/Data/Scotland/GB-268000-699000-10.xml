  Visiting of neighbours on the first  
 of January,'FIRST FOOTING' soon after 
 midnight involves taking a gift of    
 food or drink and a lump of coal to   
 ensure a plentiful supply throughout  
 the ensuing year.                     
  On the last day of term nearest to   
 Easter primary school children in     
 Deanston look for,and always find,    
 Easter eggs left by the 'Easter Bird' 
 in the playpark.                      
  At local weddings coins are scattered
 in the street by the Groomsman and    
 the children watching SCRAMBLE to pick
 them up. A young man of the farming   
 community about to be married is given
 a 'blackening' the night before his   
 wedding by his friends. They cover him
 in chocolate, cocoa, treacle, or even 
 sheep dip. Friends?                   
  GUISING is popular at Hallowe'en.    </content>
