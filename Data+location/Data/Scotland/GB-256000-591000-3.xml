		<content>{LAMBING}In April the lambing          
 begins.Most of the lambs are          
 Blackface and most are born on the    
 hills. Some of the other lambs        
 are born in the fields around the     
 house.In May the lambing has just     
 about finished.If there is anything   
 wrong with the ewe the lambs are      
 brought in to be bottle fed.Sometimes 
 the ewes die from lack of calcium, and
 then the lambs are often twinned on to
 a ewe whose lambs have died.The ewes  
 have to be checked about twice a day. 
{GATHERING}After about two months the  
 ewes and lambs are gathered and taken 
 into pens to be marked.The tup lambs  
 are castrated.Some farmers use rubber 
 bands, others use bardizzos.This stops
 them from breeding and also helps them
 to put on more weight.
