		<content> PEOPLE IN GOUROCK ARE INVOLVED IN     
 VARIOUS LEISURE ACTIVITIES.TWO OF THE 
 FAVOURITE WAYS OF RELAXING FOR GOUROCK
 PEOPLE ARE GARDENING AND WATCHING     
 TELEVISION.IN A RECENT SURVEY A NUMBER
 OF PEOPLE STATED THAT THEY WATCHED    
 TELEVISION FOR AS MUCH AS 6 HOURS PER 
 DAY.                                  
 ONE LEISURE ACTIVITY WHICH IS MUCH    
 LESS COMMON TODAY THAN IN THE PAST IS 
 GOING TO THE CINEMA.THERE ARE NOW NO  
 CINEMAS STILL OPEN IN GOUROCK,AND VERY
 FEW PEOPLE TRAVEL TO THE CINEMA IN    
 OTHER TOWNS.                          
 WHEN ASKED ABOUT THEIR LEISURE        
 ACTIVITES A NUMBER OF LOCAL PEOPLE    
 SAID THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE       
 INVOLVED IN MORE SPORTS,AND FELT THAT 
 THE TOWN BADLY NEEDED A SPORTS CENTRE.
