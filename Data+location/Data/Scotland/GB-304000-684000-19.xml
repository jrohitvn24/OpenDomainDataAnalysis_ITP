		<title>19THE HALKETTS OF PITFIRRANE</title>
		<content> The Halkett Family of Pitfirrane has  
 been associated with estates of that  
 name as far back as the earliest      
 written records exist, the 14th       
 century. The first named of any of the
 family was a Robert Halkett, appointed
 sheriff of Kinross by Robert 2nd in   
 1360, and he has been followed by many
 distinguished ancestors, including    
 John Halkett, killed at the battle of 
 Pinkie in September 1547, Sir Arthur  
 Halkett Bart., and Wedder Conway      
 Halkett, Sir Arthur's only son, who   
 died of illness on the Nile expedition
 of 1885.                              
    The last of the family was Miss    
 Madeleine Halkett, and on her death   
 the mansion house and the grounds of  
 the Pitfirrane estate were purchased  
 by the Dunfermline Carnegie Trust, and
 then leased to Dunfermline Golf Club.
