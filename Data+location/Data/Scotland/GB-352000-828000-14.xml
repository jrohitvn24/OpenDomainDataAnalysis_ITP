		<title>14Leisure Activities</title>
		<content> Quite a number of people in the       
 Kennethmont area are actively involved
 with sporting activities such as horse
 riding, badminton, cycling, football, 
 swimming, bowling, fishing, shooting, 
 netball and golf. Many of the older   
 people spend their spare time drinking
 in the pub or walking in the gardens  
 at Leith Hall .Many women are members 
 of the W.R.I. or the "Guild". Whist   
 clubs are popular and so is gardening 
 during the warmer months. A number of 
 younger people  are fond of highland  
 dancing and playing musical           
 instruments and many people have      
 hobbies such as collecting stamps,    
 photography,and looking after  pet    
 animals.Adults go to dances and discos
 held at Huntly and sometimes Insch.   
 Probably the most of our spare time is
 spent watching television.
