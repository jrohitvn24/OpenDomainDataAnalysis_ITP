		<content> The Battle of Dupplin Moor was fought 
 to the north of Forteviot, beside     
 Bankhead Farm, in 1732.               
 John Balliol and his army encamped in 
 the Miller's Acre just to the east of 
 the present school. Balliol led the   
 English Army against the over         
 confident Scots at night, crossing the
 ford to the north west of the village.
 3000 were killed.                     
                                       
                                       
 Kenneth son of Alpin, the first ruler 
 of the combined kingdom of the Scots  
 and Picts, died in the royal hall at  
 Forteviot.A large stone arch was found
 in the River May and is supposed to   
 come from the royal chapel of the     
 Pictish times. Aerial photographs     
 highlight burial, and ritual or       
 ceremonial sites, possibly as early as
 2000 B.C.                             </content>
