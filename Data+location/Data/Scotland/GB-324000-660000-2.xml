		<title>02LOCAL EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Our area does not employ a great many 
 people.  We have an army barracks     
 called Glencorse.  There are 500      
 soldiers there.  They also have to    
 employ cooking and cleaning staff and 
 are therefore the largest employers in
 the area.  The next largest is        
 Rosslynlee Hospital which has 10      
 wards with 260 nursing staff, adding  
 in cleaning and catering staff brings 
 the total to 430.  Next come the      
 schools: Beeslack High School employs 
 65 people, Ladywood Primary 17,       
 Glencorse Primary 11 and Mauricewood  
 Primary 34. There are 7 large farms in
 the area employing a total of 35      
 people.  Glencorse Golf Course has 1  
 full time person, 5 part time people  
 and 1 kitchen lady.  The sewage works 
 employ 3 people.  Most people travel  
 to Edinburgh to work.
