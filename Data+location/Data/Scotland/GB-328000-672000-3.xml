		<content>{Duddingston}got its name from a knight
 in Norman times called{Dodyn.}There is
 evidence of a possible crannog in the 
 loch dated 8th century B.C. In the    
 year 1120 the monks of Kelso built a  
 church for the people of Easter and   
 Wester Duddingston.                   
  In{Wester Duddingston}there was      
 farming{(Northfield, Southfield and   
{Meadowfield)}and weaving of a coarse  
 cloth called Duddingston Hardings. In 
{Easter Duddingston}there were salt    
 pan workings at{Magdalene Bridge}from 
 the 17th to the 20th century. From the
 16th to the 18th century there was    
 also coal mining in the area and many 
 families were sold into slavery.      
  The name{Joppa}may be derived from   
 the old sea port in the Holy Land.    
{Portobello}is named after Puerto Bello
 in Panama, commemorating the defeat of
 the Spanish in 1739.                  </content>
