 house is still there with a pine wind-
 staircase typical of Telford.A moulded
 shield with the arms of the{Duchess

{Stafford}is above the entrance. There 
 is a circular drive and garden circled
 by alternate ash and sycamore planted 
 by Sutherland Estates.In 1774,they had
 asked John Home to survey Assynt. He  
 stayed at the old manse in Inchnadamph
