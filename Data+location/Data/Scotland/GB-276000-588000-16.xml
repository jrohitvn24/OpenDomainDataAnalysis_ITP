		<content> Mr. Grocer is the local correspondant 
 for the Dumfries And Galloway Standard
 since retiring from teaching at       
 Crawfordton House School.He can truly 
 say that he has his finger on the     
 pulse of the village since coming here
 to live in 1961.He has seen changes   
 since then but mainly in people with  
 births and deaths but some houses have
 been renovated and some knocked down. 
 He reports on anything which he feels 
 is interesting or important but what  
 he writes is not always what appears  
 in the paper as his editor edits his  
 work according to the available       
 space.He covers school events,        
 obituaries,stories of village life but
 the most important story,he feels,was 
 when he wrote about the Patterson     
 Evening.James Patterson the famous    
 artist lived in the village and his   
 grandaughter gave a talk and exhibited</content>
