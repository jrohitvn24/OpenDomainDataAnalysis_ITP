		<content> Gleniffer Home is more than 100 years 
 old and Mrs. McKnight has worked there
 for 24 years. We asked her some       
 questions about the place. She told us
 that the people there are all over 70 
 years old, but only one is disabled,  
 the rest can get around unaided. There
 are 31 beds in the home, but only 30  
 patients at the moment. Two of the    
 residents are Roman Catholics and the 
 chaplain, a Fr. Carroll visits them   
 once a week.                          
 The home provides employment for a    
 number of people. There are 8 day     
 nurses, 5 on nights, 1 matron in      
 charge, 7 domestic staff, 2 cooks, 1  
 doctor and a gardener. Mrs. McKnight  
 enjoys her work even though she has to
 wash, serve meals, make beds, bathe   
 the old and wash their hair if they   
 can't manage. She does not live on the
 premises, but on Glasgow Road, Paisley</content>
