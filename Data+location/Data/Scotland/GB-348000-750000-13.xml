		<title>13RESCOBIE'S DISTRICT NURSE</title>
		<content> Patients'{Attitudes}towards the       
 District{Nurse}are mixed. Some took a 
 while to get used to her as she is no 
 longer part of the community because  
 the nurse's house in Letham was sold. 
 One{Problem}is patient acceptance.    
 Some of them are difficult because    
 they live alone and want independence.
 She sometimes worries about the job as
 it is easy to get involved. The Nurse 
 enjoys her work but finds it very     
 demanding as there is no-one to help  
 her. She enjoys Midwifery but believes
 that she might move to Health Visiting
 eventually. It interferes with her    
 social life but she doesn't think it  
 is as bad as hospital duty. The       
 District Nurse considers she is       
 reasonably well paid since the nurses'
 big{Pay}rise in 1978 but she doesn't  
 mind about money, she would never     
 change jobs.                          </content>
