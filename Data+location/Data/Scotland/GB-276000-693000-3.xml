		<title>03Thistle Centre    Stirling</title>
		<content> The Thistle Centre is a very modern   
 shopping precinct. It is a busy centre
 and all the big stores such as Boots, 
 Woolworths, Frasers and Debenhams are 
 there. In the middle of the streets   
 there are rockeries, benches and      
 litter bins. All the shops in the     
 Thistle Centre are glass fronted so   
 people can glance through the windows 
 without going into the shop as there  
 is always a display in the window. In 
 all, there are 40 shops, 5 department 
 stores and a few restaurants.         
   The centre has a good security      
 system and there are quite a few      
 uniformed men looking out for trouble 
 makers. If they see them they will    
 contact their colleagues on their     
 Walkie-Talkies and put an end to the  
 troublemaking.                        
   Central heating makes the centre a  
 pleasant place to shop in winter.     </content>
