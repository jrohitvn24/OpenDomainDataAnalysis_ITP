		<title>01Lochnagr's Northern Slopes</title>
		<content> This block consists almost entirely of
 heather dominated rough mountain      
 terrain. The upper hill slopes are    
 boulder strewn and in some cases      
 precipitous, while the lower slopes   
 are more generally heathery with some 
 area of wet grassland and eroded      
 peat.The region is drained by the     
 Lochnagar Burn, which runs underground
 for part of its upper reaches after   
 leaving the Lochnagar Corrie Loch, and
 by other tributaries of the Gelder    
 Burn. The highest point in the block  
 is the summit of Lochnagar, on which  
 there stands a viewpoint indicator    
 erected by the Cairngorm Club in 1924.
 There is no human habitation in the   
 area, although the Meikle Pap and the 
 summit of Lochnagar are visited       
 regularly by hillwakers and climbers, 
 and there are few man made features   
 other than the paths and tracks       </content>
