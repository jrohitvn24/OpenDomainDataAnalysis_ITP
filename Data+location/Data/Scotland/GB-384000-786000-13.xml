		<content>  School Fashion, although not         
 completely in tune with Street        
 Fashions, frequently change. In 1982  
 tight minis were 'IN'. Ties were      
 large, any knot smaller than a fist   
 was called a 'Swot Knot'. Hair was    
 short and spiked. The idea was to look
 as far from neat and tidy as possible,
 for boys, fashion was not in fashion. 
 The only thing that really caught on  
 were skin tight 'Staypress' which     
 looked somewhat like shapeless        
 pyjamas. The shoe scene is pretty much
 the same. Girls are still favouring   
 Court shoes with varying heights of   
 stilleto heels. In 1982 Track shoes   
 and Trainers figured most in the life 
 of a male teenage foot.               
  Now in 1985, Skirts have dropped     
 below the knees ocassionaly coming in 
 to contact with the ankles. The
