		<content> Residents find the noise disturbing,  
 as traffic uses nearby country roads  
 as a short cut from the A9 South to   
 the A9 North. A new Western bypass,   
 opening in September 1985, five months
 ahead of plan will take much of this  
 traffic.                              
 Huntingtower Quarry, sometimes called 
 the Hermitage, is being filled in by  
 King and Company Ltd. It will take    
 between twenty and twenty five years. 
 The water, polluted and green, is not 
 clear. Two mallard ducks were         
 observed.                             
 There is a small upholstery buisness  
 in the village. It has been           
 operational for twenty years and work 
 is constant. The one man owner set up 
 in West Huntingtower in order to be   
 independent.
