		<title>08OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>     Our primary school has 4          
 classrooms but one of them is used for
 the pre-school playgroup. We have     
 3 teachers, two cooks, a secretary and
 two cleaners.  A music teacher comes  
 one afternoon a week. Our school is   
 quite small with just 53 pupils.      
     The things I like best are        
 swimming,singing,gym and some work    
 like language and art. I don't like   
 maths.                                
                                       
     When we leave Chapelgreen Primary 
 School we go to Kilsyth Academy. There
 are about 950 pupils there. They get  
 all sorts of work to do like sports,  
 wood-work, French and home economics. 
    I am a bit nervous of going  to    
 the academy.
