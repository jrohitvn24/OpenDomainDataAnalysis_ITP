		<title>06Population Dalgety Bay.</title>
		<content> The population of Dalgety Bay,made up 
 largely of professional people,tends  
 to fluctuate because many families    
 have to leave the area because of the 
 husband gaining promotion or being    
 moved to a different branch of the    
 company he works for,in a different   
 part of the country.Even although     
 families leave the area new families  
 move into the area so the population  
 of Dalgety Bay is still increasing. At
 present the population is around the  
 6000 mark.Many of the families staying
 in or moving into Dalgety Bay have    
 children of primary school age.This   
 information was gained by looking at  
 the rolls of the two local primary    
 schools.One school now has a roll of  
 approximately 470 pupils and the other
 over 500.Because of the increase in   
 children of school age the building of
 a third school has been proposed.     </content>
