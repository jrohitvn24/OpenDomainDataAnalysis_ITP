		<title>10SUPERNATURAL STORIES</title>
		<content> There is a castle just out of         
 Grantown.  It is called Castle Grant  
 it is supposed to be haunted by a     
 piper and a green lady.  The  story   
 is that a piper said he could pipe all
 the way to Inverness and back and     
 round the castle three times.  He made
 it to Inverness and back, but on the  
 third time round the castle he        
 collapsed and died of exhaustion.     
                                       
   The story about the green lady is   
 this, a lady of the castle went with  
 this man who lived in Huntlys Cave.   
 The lady's father wanted her to marry 
 this rich man but she wanted to marry 
 the man who lived in Huntlys cave.    
 Her father locked her up in a small   
 room and locked the door.  A good few 
 years later they opened the door and  
 there was nothing there.
