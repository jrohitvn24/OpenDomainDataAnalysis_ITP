		<title>12The Local Gala</title>
		<content> A gala is held in our village one     
 weekend every year during the         
 summer.The villagers meet at the club 
 and then follow in a procession up the
 Main Street behind the gala queen.They
 parade through the streets and end up 
 in Keir's Park.There are races for    
 mums and dads,grans and grandads.There
 are running races for toddlers and    
 upwards,obstacle races and a tug of   
 war.Also during the summer is         
 Cowdenbeath Civic Week.There is       
 usually a fancy dress competition and 
 all the entrants stand on lorries     
 called floats which have streamers and
 rosettes and coloured ribbons hanging 
 from them.The floats drive slowly down
 to Cowdenbeath Public Park with a     
 brass band marching in front and      
 everybody else follows at the         
 back.Once at the park a gala is held.
