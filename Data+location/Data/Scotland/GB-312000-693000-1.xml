		<content>{Kelty.} North edge of Fife coalfield  
 2M/3K North of Cowdenbeath.  Kelty is 
 a village with a population of just   
 over 5,000.  The highest point in this
 sector is some 210ms.  Kelty was,     
 formerly, a mining village but the    
 industry is now defunct.  The village 
 of Kelty is built on the side of a    
 hill with an Easterly aspect.  One    
 quarter of the sector is utilised by  
 forest, one half by farmland, and the 
 remainder by the village and other    
 settlement, including some by water.  
 To the East is a newly created Country
 Park called{The Meadows}which was     
 formerly a "derelict mining area".    
 There are four farms in the sector.
