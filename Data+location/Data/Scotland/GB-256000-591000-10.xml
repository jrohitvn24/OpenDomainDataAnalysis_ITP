		<title>10CARSPHAIRN CH/WOMAN'S GUILD</title>
		<content> So far as is known the Carsphairn     
 Church Woman's Guild began as a work  
 party, some time after 1925, with tea 
 seved in the manse by the minister's  
 mother.When the minister married, his 
 wife formed a guild.Fees were 2/6 per 
 year.Current fees are Â£1 per session. 
  Meetings are held in Lagwyne Hall    
 once a month from October to March,the
 October meeting being the dedication  
 service conducted by the minister.    
  A meeting consists of an opening and 
 a closing hymn,a bible reading, a     
 prayer and talk _ the subject usually 
 connected with church or missions.    
  There used to be an annual outing,   
 but this has been discontinued, though
 visits take place to other Guilds.    
  The Guild holds an annual sale of    
 work, where the proceeds go in aid of 
 the Christmas Treat for the senior    
 citizens of the parish,and to charity.</content>
