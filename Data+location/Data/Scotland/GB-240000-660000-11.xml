		<title>11St Cuthbert's H.S Johnstone</title>
		<content> St Cuthbert's is a purpose built Roman
 Catholic co-educational 6 year        
 comprehensive school, serving the     
 population of Johnstone and its       
 environs.It provides education through
 from first to sixth year, presenting  
 pupils for C.S.E. examinations at     
 'O', standard and 'H' grade and       
 Certificate of Sixth Year Studies.    
 It is situated on the south western   
 boundary of the town and was opened in
 1972 by Bishop McGill.                
 The present roll is 851 and there are 
 62 teachers, only 12 of whom were here
 in 1972.                              
 The roll of the school remained at    
 approximately 1000 from 1972 to 1983. 
 Then the roll began to fall, and by   
 1992 the roll is expected to be less  
 than 500.This will have grave         
 implications for the school's future.
