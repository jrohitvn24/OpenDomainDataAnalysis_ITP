		<content>       A playgroup meets twice a week  
 in Charleston Hall for pre-school     
 children.  It is run and financed by  
 the members.  The numbers vary greatly
 from year to year, depending on the   
 number of young children.             
                                       
      There is a non-denominational    
 Primary School in Glamis.  The roll   
 for a number of years has been in the 
 50's.  There are three class teachers,
 including the Head Teacher, for the   
 seven classes.  There are visiting    
 teachers for Physical Education, Art, 
 Music, and Remedial (mainly language).
 The Minister of Glamis Kirk is the    
 School Chaplain.  He visits school,   
 and end of term religious services are
 held in the Kirk.  The Head Teacher is
 the only male member of the teaching  
 staff.                                
                                       </content>
