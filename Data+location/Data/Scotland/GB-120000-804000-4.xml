 Canna consists mainly of basaltic lava
 flows, with some interbedded coarse   
 conglomerate and agglomerate, which   
 has been intruded by dolerite sills   
 that have cooled in sheets parallel to
 the flows.This has produced the       
 island's terraced topography.Regular  
 polygonal columns have formed         
 providing a very distinctive scene.   
 Around the coast there are some       
 natural arches and stacks which have  
 in the past provided sites for forts  
 for the population and are currently  
 popular as nesting sites for birds.   
 Compass Hill is so named because it   
 has a magnetic field that effects     
 compass readings.                     
 Wild flowers                          
 The island is a mass of colour from   
 May to September with a range of wild 
 flowers, some of which are rare.      </content>
