		<title>04HOUSING IN SANDWICK</title>
		<content> Sandwick has a total of 283 houses.   
 The majority of these are clustered in
 compact groups throughout the         
 district. Others on more solitary     
 sites are built on the crofts which   
 they occupy or because of the charming
 views they command.                   
   The types of houses vary from the   
 traditional stone built cottage to the
 more modern timber-framed building of 
 today. Many of the older and smaller  
 houses have been enlarged and         
 modernised.                           
   Thirty Norwegian-type wooden houses 
 solved the housing problems of the    
 early 1970's.                         
   During the oil boom in the 1970's   
 thirty houses were built in Sandwick  
 to accommodate pilots, engineers and  
 airport staff from Sumburgh Airport.  
 These houses have either been acquired
 now by the Council or rented.         </content>
