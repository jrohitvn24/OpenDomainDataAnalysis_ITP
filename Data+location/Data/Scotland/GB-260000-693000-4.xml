		<title>04LIFE STYLES IN ARNPRIOR</title>
		<content> The life style of the people of       
 Arnprior and the surrounding area,    
 while rural, is in no sense           
 remote. Almost all families have, or  
 have access to, at least one motor car
 and travel easily to the neighbouring 
 villages or, more typically to        
 Stirling.(There is also a regular bus 
 service.) Shopping for major          
 supplies,for clothing etc. is normally
 done in Stirling with farmers and     
 their wives traditionally going to    
 town on market day(Thursday). In      
 recent times one major shopping       
 expedition per week or per month has  
 become common. Similarly many people  
 now travel to Stirling or Glasgow to  
 work, and most families have at least 
 one member whose employment is outside
 the immediate area.
