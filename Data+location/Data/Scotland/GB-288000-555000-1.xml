		<content> In this block rounded hills on        
 'Siluman' rocks slope fairly steeply  
 towards a cliffed coastline.          
 Vegetation is rough moorland and heath
 with rocky outcrops apart from areas  
 near the few roads.  The main road    
 follows the coast.  Sandyhills villae 
 occupie the only level low ground,    
 where a stream reaches the sea.  Here 
 is also a Sandy beach.  Popular with  
 tourists and Dumfires residents in the
 summer.  However there are few        
 facilities and the trade is entirely  
 seasonal.  At Barend is a modern      
 chalet development with licensed      
 restaurant.  The tide falls to reveal 
 mudlats extnding severall miles out to
 sea, and the coast is teacherous.  At 
 the eastern end of the block is an    
 area of marshy wetland which forms    
 Southwick coast National Nature       
 Reserve. Perm Population is small.    </content>
