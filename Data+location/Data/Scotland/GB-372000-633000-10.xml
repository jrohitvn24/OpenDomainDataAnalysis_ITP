		<title>10Tweedside Sports Club, Kelso</title>
		<content> The{Tweedside Sports Club}has been    
 open for four years now. There are two
 squash courts, a gymnasium, a sauna   
 and jacuzzi, a cafe, a bar and the    
 Cellar Bar Disco. Now the club is up  
 for sale. The District Council are    
 thinking of buying it. We asked 150   
 Kelso people what they thought should 
 happen to the club. We found that more
 than half of the people we asked had  
 never used the club. We asked if      
 people thought the council should buy 
 the club.{71%}thought that they should
 and{19%}thought they shouldn't.{10%   
 didn't know. When we asked if part of 
 the club should become a mini cinema, 
{55%}said yes and{37%}said no. We also 
 asked what people would like to see in
 the club. Most people wanted a youth  
 club{(65%)}and keep-fit classes{(43%).
 We think the Council{should}buy the   
 Tweedside Sports Club.                </content>
