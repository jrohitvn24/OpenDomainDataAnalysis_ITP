 The town council went bankrupt after  
 building Union St. and had to sell    
 land. A piece was bought by           
 Mr.MacAulay in 1820 to build a house. 
 His house and land were subsequently  
 acquired by the Dept. of Ag.&amp; Fish who
 introduced soil research.This includes
 work on soil, soil maps,soil fertility
 and soil analysis.They give data about
 farmers' land and the Coll. of Agri.  
 advises the farmers. The institute    
 mainly works with Scottish soils.     
 Overseas visitors come for training.  
 There are 120 staff, about 80 Science 
 grads. They have 50 acres for         
 experimental farming. The 100 roomed  
 building costs Â£3.5M pa. 70% is spent 
 on staff and 25% on equipment.The DAF 
 gives the money by Grant, providing   
 research is published in Scientific   
 journals.They have a lot of computers.</content>
