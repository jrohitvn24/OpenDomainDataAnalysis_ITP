		<title>13PIERS AND GARDENS</title>
		<content> From the West Pier travelling east we 
 come to the East Pier. Both piers have
 been extended and enlarged this       
 century. Increased dredging has also  
 taken place to remove a large bank of 
 sand from between the two piers. At   
 the foot of the East Pier a large car 
 park was reclaimed from the loch at   
 Port Rodie.The Information Centre was 
 built here in 1977 for the ferry      
 passengers and the growing number of  
 tourists. Oposite this is The North   
 West Castle Hotel. At one time the    
 high tide would almost lap its walls, 
 and indeed the gates of its boathouse 
 can still be seen in the perimeter    
 wall. Next to this is the Garden of   
 Friendship or Rock Gardens.A piece of 
 land gifted to the town by Lord Stair 
 in 1931.They got their name because   
 people could donate plants and shrubs 
 to help the town council beautify it. </content>
