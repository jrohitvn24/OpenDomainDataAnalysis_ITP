		<title>18LUNAN AREA, LIFE STYLES.</title>
		<content> The quality of life in this area in   
 1985 depends a great deal on          
 transport. If you have got your own   
 transport to  enable you to shop, go  
 out to places of entertainment and    
 taxi your children to their various   
 activities outwith the Lunan area you 
 have the best of both worlds. The     
 beach, the countryside, the peace; a  
 very good environment, plus urban     
 amenities. If however, you depend on  
 public transport, your social         
 activities, especially for the very   
 old and the very young are greatly    
 curtailed.                            
 The teenagers in the area feel no such
 limitations, they go by bus to the    
 discos in Montrose, travelling back   
 by late bus or getting a lift from    
 parents. The older people appear to   
 enjoy their evenings watching         
 television.                           </content>
