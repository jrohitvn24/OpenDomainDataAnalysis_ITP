		<content>    When we went to the Police Station 
 we found that 16 people work there,   
 because it is the centre for the area.
 There is one cell for keeping         
 prisoners in, which has to be used    
 about twice a week. The{most common   
{crime}in the area is theft from cars. 
    The Police have to answer on       
 average about 30{emergency calls}each 
 week. We asked whether much detective 
 work was done or did they call in     
 special detectives. The Sergeant told 
 us they did both depending on the     
 crime to be solved. The policemen     
 patrol the area in police cars and are
 contacted by{radio}when they are      
 needed.                               
    The Police come to our{school}every
 year to teach us about road safety and
 to tell us we must not go with        
 strangers. We all think of the        
 policemen as our friends.             </content>
