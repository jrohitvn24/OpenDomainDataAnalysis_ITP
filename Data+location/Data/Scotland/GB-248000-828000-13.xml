 recreational sports in the Glen.Loch  
 Ness is a convenient spot for fishing,
 where Borlum Bay is good for{Brown    
{Trout}and even{Salmon.}There are a few
 pools on the River Enrick which are   
 good for{trout}and when the river is  
 in spate you can also catch{Salmon.   
 The hill lochs which surround the Glen

 foot.These lochs are good for{Brown   
{Trout}the lochs that are over 2000    
 feet have{Arctic Char}.A few of the   
 lower lochs are fished for{Pike}.The  
 fishing season is mostly in summer,   
 from March to September.The best bait 
 is worm but fly and toby are also     
 used.The{Otter Board}is a piece of    
 wood with a long line coming back to  
 the shore with flies dropping from the
