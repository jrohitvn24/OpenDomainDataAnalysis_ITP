		<content>  Mrs Pat Grant was nominated for      
 Business Woman of the Year in 1983    
 because of her part in the rapid      
 growth of the factory which started   
 from scratch ten years ago. She is    
 the Marketing Director,Chief Buyer and
 Personnel Director of{Norfrost}Ltd.   
  Mrs Grant believes women can be      
 better in business than men because   
 women look at a job more humanely,    
 whilst some men only look at the      
 money and the end results.            
  The company provides free transport  
 from{Morrison's, Castletown}and a     
 breakfast and two course lunch from   
{The Royal Hotel,Thurso,}thus helping  
{to }provide work locally.             
 She has been to many countries on     
 business trips,and her success is     
 based on hard work.
