 hated doing mathematics, but loved    
 poetry. He was a fisherman for 30     
 years.When he was 30 years old, he    
 started to write his own poems and he 
 became a poet. He has had 5 versions  
 of his book 'Mount Pleasant'          
 published.He lives in a house also    
 called 'Mount Pleasant', which over   
 looks the harbour. Peter Buchan's     
 first poem was 'Days Gone By' and his 
 most recent poem is 'Where There's    
 Life'. He has written 68 poems to

 watching, listening and talking to    
 people. He always writes in local     
 dialect. Although retired, he still   
 goes fishing in his own boat, but his 
 first love is poetry.
