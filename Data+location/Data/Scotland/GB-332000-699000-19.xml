		<title>19THE WILD FLOWERS OF MILTON.</title>
		<content>  In our study of the ecology of our   
 area,we noted the wild flowers growing
 on the path beside the River Leven,in 
 August,April and June.In{August,}we   
 saw rosebay willowherbs,some already  
 with parachute seeds,also pretty pink 
 mallows,herb roberts and prickly      
 thistles.{April}brought many flowers  
 including blue periwinkles on a wall, 
 yellow primroses in the woods,green   
 saxifrages and yellow celandines.     
 We found a few white anenomes.In{June}
 marsh marigolds or kingcups grew up   
 the riverbanks.A small area of blue   
 bugles was lovely.Big patches of      
 ransoms or wild garlic had a powerful 
 smell.Wild hyacinths or English       
 bluebells grew under the trees.We made
 a list of 52 wild flowers.There were  
 also 15 species of trees,but many were
 being felled.Would the flowers survive
 we wondered?                          </content>
