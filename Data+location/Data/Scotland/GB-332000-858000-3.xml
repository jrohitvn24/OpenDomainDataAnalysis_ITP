		<content>       MILNES PRIMARY SCHOOL           
                                       
   Built in {1938}to accomodate an     
 increasing roll, the six rooms were   
 added to in {1956}.With the           
 centralising policy of the 60's when  
{Spey Bay}and{Clochan}were added to the
 catchment area accommodation has      
 remained a major problem. However with
 the prospect of the Secondary School  
 moving the Primary will return to the 
 site it originally shared as{Milnes   
{Institution}.                         
   The School was split in 1977 when   
 the first Headteacher appointed was a 
 former pupil,Miss Margaret Riddel.Miss
 Riddel retired in 1985.               
   The roll in{1985 }was {191}with some
 of the pupils being taught in         
 classrooms vacated by the secondary   
 department.
