		<content> Many of the fields have been added    
 together and are bigger too.          
 The{loch of Skene}in 1931 was being   
 used as a reservoir to drive an       
 electric turbine to supply electricity
 to Dunecht house and to other estate  
 houses.This use ceased in 1964.Islands
 have been built on the loch for       
 shooting purposes.The loch is         
 extensively used for{recreation}by the
 Aberdeen,Stonehaven yacht club and is 
 a S.S.S.I. because of the vegetation  
 surrounding it and large numbers of   
 wild fowl coming to the loch in       
 winter.                               
 In 1931 many of the{Estate woodlands }
 were quite old and large areas blew   
 down in the great gale of 1953.all    
 these areas have been replanted       
 together with other areas not suitable
 for farming and shooting.
