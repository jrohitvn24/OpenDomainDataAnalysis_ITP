		<content>    There are 79 homes in our D. Block,
 with a population of 210.  70% were   
 born in Orkney, but less than 1/3 of  
 these was born in Evie.  Of the       
 incoming population  60% comes from   
 England.  Only 6 adults have always   
 lived in their present homes so there 
 has obviously been a great deal of    
 population movement. The reasons given
 by people coming into this area are as
 follows: 7% to be near relatives, 9%  
 because their house was good value,   
 28% to be near their work, and 54%    
 because they like living here.  The   
 quality of the environment and        
 community is twice as important as    
 financial considerations.             
   62% of houses are built mainly of   
 stone; most of the others of concrete 
 blocks. People generally have their   
 own transport, 1/3 of vehicles being  
 less than 3 years old.                </content>
