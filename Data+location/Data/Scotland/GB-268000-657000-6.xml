		<content> Malcolm Waugh, local regional         
 councillor for Hamilton North, is     
 Chairman of COSLA and was born and    
 brought up in{Blantyre.} In his       
 time, he has seen a small mining      
 community change into a thriving      
 town with a new shopping centre,      
 sports complex and a population       
 rise from 9,000 to 29,000.            
{Bothwell,}a residential area, has no  
 industry and people are quite         
 willing to travel to Blantyre for     
 shopping and leisure activities.      
 For the future Mr Waugh hopes to      
 create employment for 800 people      
 within 3 years by bringing one of     
 Europe's largest computer companies   
 to the industrial estate in           
 Blantyre.  At the east side of        
 Blantyre, there lies derelict land    
 and the plan is to construct a        
 centre for youth in the area.         </content>
