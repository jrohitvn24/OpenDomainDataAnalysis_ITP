		<content> General Description of area.          
 The square is mostly countryside which
 is very hilly.   The highest hill is  
 216 feet.   There are a number of     
 tracks leading into the hills.   There
 are some woods; more coniferous than  
 deciduous.   On the high ground, there
 are sheep; with cattle and crops on   
 the low ground.                       
 There are 2 small villages and 8      
 farms.                                
     On the eastern side of our area is
 the main road from Dundee to          
 Kirkcaldy.   The main village is      
 Letham.   Many people who live in the 
 area commute to the nearby towns and  
 cities.
