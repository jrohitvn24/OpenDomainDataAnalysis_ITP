		<content> This block is totally                 
 agricultural,mostly arable, with an   
 open rolling aspect, roads generally  
 straight and of good width, wide grass
 verges, hedges neatly trimmmd by      
 machine, often with shelter belts     
 beyond. This, together with the       
 general flatness of the land, gives   
 the area a feeling of spaciousness,   
 which is further emphasised by its    
 emptiness, as very few farmworkers are
 nowepoyed. There is no dairying, and  
 only a few fields have beef cattle or 
 sheep. The 8 farmsteds are in         
 generally good condition, the original
 buildings being mostly C19 stonebuilt.
 Two farms have new  bungalows for     
 workers, but most of the older        
 cottages are used for storage or stand
 empty. Silos break the skyline.  The  
 shelter belts and spinneys cover      
 about 10% of th land and house        </content>
