		<title>07A MOFFAT FARMER'S BOY</title>
		<content>    {ROBBIE GRAHAM,OAKRIGG FARM        
  Our farm,about a mile outside Moffat 
 consists of 270 acres of arable and   
 grazing land.It is a typical medium   
 sized farm in the area.The grassland  
 is all improved using animal manure   
 and artificial fertiliser.We have     
 started to grow our own crops(turnips,
 barley,potatoes),the barley being sold
 (the grain store is unfinished)this   
 year.No silage is made but hay is.A   
 new bailer has been purchased.Three   
 cattle sheds(one new)and a sheep shed 
 accommodate the stock.The stock       
 handling area has been enlarged which 
 makes dipping and dosing the stock    
 much easier.The hay crop will have to 
 be brought in quickly this year as the
 grass is growing quickly(lots of rain)
 Altogether the farm is quite          
 prosperous and top prices have been   
 made on heifers.I enjoy farm life.    </content>
