		<title>16TRANSPORT - STRANRAER</title>
		<content>  Stranraer is situated in the south - 
 west of Scotland and is served by two 
 'A' class roads, the{A75}and{A77.     
 The A75 is also called{The Euroroute. 
 It is so called because of the many   
 heavy transport vehicles that carry   
 goods along the road between the      
{English Channel Ferry Ports}and       
 Stranraer, which is an important Ferry
 Port to Northern Ireland. The A77     
 leads to Ayr and Glasgow.             
  Other forms of transport include the 
{Sealink ferries}and there is also a   
{train service}to Stranraer which still
 relies on diesel engines.             
  Many locals own cars as it is often  
 necessary to travel to larger towns   
 such as Dumfries or Ayr to shop or    
 find essential services, e.g. Garages 
 dealing in specific makes of car.     
  The nearest{commercial airport}to    
 Stranraer is{Prestwick.               </content>
