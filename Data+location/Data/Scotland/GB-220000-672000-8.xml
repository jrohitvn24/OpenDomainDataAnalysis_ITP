		<title>08COMMUNICATIONS IN KIP VALLEY</title>
		<content> Roads and a railway form the main     
 transport links in this area.  The    
 high,steep,slopes restrict these lines
 of communication to the lowlands of   
 the coast and the floor of Spango     
 valley.  The A742T runs through       
 Spango valley  and carries the        
 majority of the traffic. This road has
 been improved recently by widening    
 and straightening and the removal     
 of dangerous bends giving improved    
 access to the I.B.M. factory.The A78  
 follows the coast from Gourock and    
 meets the A742T about a kilometer east
 of Inverkip.  The railway is an       
 electric single track which runs from 
 Glasgow Central station to Wemyss Bay 
 station.  It runs through Inverkip.   
 There are a lot of tunnels on the     
 route because of the hilly landscape.
