		<title>05FARMING BALLINDALLOCH WAY</title>
		<content> Most of the farming here is mixed     
 farming.Because the land is hilly it  
 is fine for sheep,and the farmers also
 rear beef cattle,pigs,poultry and in  
 some cases goats.The crops grown are  
 barley,oats,turnips,potatoes,rape,kale
 and grass for pasture,hay and silage. 
 The greater part of the cultivated    
 land produces food for beef cattle.   
 Most of the farms are well mechanised 
 so they employ far fewer workers      
 nowadays than they once did.          
    Major trends in farming in the area
 include the installation of a large   
 piggery with over 2000 pigs at one    
 farm , and ploughing up areas of rough
 land to grow crops at other farms.    
    On the whole the farmers are a     
 contented lot,apart from a few        
 grumbles about the weather.
