		<title>14KINNEFF WOMEN'S GUILD</title>
		<content>{KINNEFF WOMEN'S GUILD}is held in the  
 Kinneff Church from October until     
 April. It is held every month and is  
 open to ladies of the community .The  
 Guild has a committee and various     
 delegates as well as afficials who are
 responsible for the organisation of   
 speakers and activities. There are    
 various speakers at the meetings      
 talking on subjects from "travel" to  
 "cruelty to children". There are      
 approximately 27 members mainly middle
 age women but younger members would be
 most welcome as there is not a young  
 mothers' group in the area.Any money  
 that is surplus is usually used to    
 purchase an article for use in the    
 church or the ground e.g. this year it
 was a lawn-mower. The meetings are    
 brought to a close with tea and       
 sandwiches.
