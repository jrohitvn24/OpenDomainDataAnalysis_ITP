		<content> We asked some people who had always   
 lived here what changes They had seen 
 since the end of the War.They told us 
 that it was much busier.They          
 remembered when the baker had a horse 
 drawn trap changed it for a van but   
 went back to the cart because he      
 prefered it.The refuse was collected  
 in a cart too.                        
 The population was smaller and there  
 were few new houses.People were either
 tradesmen,farm labourers,shop         
 assistants or they were businessmen   
 who left early to work in Glasgow     
 coming home by steamer.We asked if    
 there had been fewer shops and        
 although neither{Cove }nor{Kilcreggan 
 village is in our square we feel this 
 answer is of importance in            
 understanding just what has happened  
 here.The reply was there had been more
 shops and not just the village store  </content>
