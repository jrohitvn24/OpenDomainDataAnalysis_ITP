		<content>  Amisfield Primary is a rural,two     
 teacher school situated six miles from
 Dumfries. The first entry in the      
 original school log book is for       
 October 3, 1864 and reads "The School 
 was re opened after the vacation."    
 Unfortunately, no one seems to know   
 when the school was originally built. 
 At present, the school has thirty     
 pupils in all and has a wide intake   
 area. One child comes from four miles 
 away and, apart from four, all        
 children are transported to and from  
 school by car or mini-bus. As well as 
 two permanent members of teaching     
 staff, we have an itinerant Music and 
 itinerant Art Specialist, both of whom
 come for sixteen weeks per year. We   
 also have a Teacher for Children with 
 Learning Difficulties for two hours   
 per week.
