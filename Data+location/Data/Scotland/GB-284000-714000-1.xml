 Parish covers approximately {60} sq.  
 miles. The village population is about
{700} spread amongst just under {300}  
 houses. There are two churches, two   
 public houses and a small number of   
 shops.                                
{Farming} is the main industry of the  
 parish, while many find employment in 
 Crieff, Perth and further afield.     
{Muthill} is an old established        
 village where traces of former        
 industry, such as weaving, can be     
 seen. It is on the {A822} road. The   
 village was on the main drove route   
 for cattle going South, to the market 
 at {Falkirk}, and the drovers used to 
 rest at   the {Highlandman Park.}     
 Nowadays, many holiday makers use the 
 road, as it is part of a designated   
 tourist route, linking many attractive
 areas of Scotland.                    </content>
