		<content>   In{Banchory}there are many styles of
 homes consisting mainly detatched and 
 semi-detatched two storey buildings   
 with a liberal scattering of bungalow 
 types.Large Victorian era homes are   
 found near the centre of the town.An  
 unusual feature about these older     
 houses is that many of them have a    
 small cottage within their grounds    
 which had probably been the home of   
 the gardener.These dwellings are often
 now rented out as holiday homes.The   
 more modern architectural types are   
 part of the select estates built to   
 the North,East,and West of the main   
 thoroughfare.Along the high Street we 
 find mostly flats.These have been     
 built above the shops which line our  
 busy main street.
