		<content> Restored last century, it exemplifies 
 Scottish baronial revival architecture
 Considered to be "Ravenswood" in      
 Scotts," Bride of Lammermoor", it     
 presently serves as the Abbey guest   
 house. Visitors and staying guests are
 legion. Comfortable quarters are      
 avilable for beggars, all our welcome.
 Since conferences are also catered    
 for, it is a constant hive of         
 activity. By courtesy of the          
 community, the village hold their     
 annual Christmas party there. Of great
 historic interest is the chapel's 17  
 painted ceilings, the shields of      
 mediaeval monachs still faintly       
 discernable. On a balcony pulpit a fox
 is sculpted in monks clothing,        
 preaching to geese. Nearby is a 16    
 circular dovecot. Nunraw (Nun's Row)  
 had belonged to cistercian nuns in the
 12th century.                         </content>
