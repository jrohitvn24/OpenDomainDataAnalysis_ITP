		<content> There have been significant changes in
 social attitudes and class            
 differences.The local aristocracy had 
 the monopoly of land, employees, thus 
 power and received the salute from the
 local community. Employees were afraid
 of losing jobs and obeyed the employer
 at all costs. The Minister and Teacher
 would be saluted by members of the    
 community but the war diminished this 
 custom which can still be seen today  
 when a man raises his hat to a woman. 
{School Customs}- Educationally there  
 have been changes. Pupils were mainly 
 from ploughmans families while today  
 there is a greater social mixture -   
 professional, artistic, farming. Some 
 families who work in St. Andrews chose
 to live in Dunino. there were 60      
 pupils in the school - 30 in each     
 class when Mrs. McCreadie was a pupil 
 but today there are 19 in all.        </content>
