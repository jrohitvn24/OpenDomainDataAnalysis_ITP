		<title>09A DAY IN THE LIFE OF------?</title>
		<content> I live in Milton Of Campsie which is a
 small village near Kilsyth.I live in a
 family of 5 of which I'm the youngest.
 We have a lot of pets including over  
 50 pigeons,30 tropical fish,2 dogs,and
 a parrot.                             
    I get my breakfast at 7.30am then I
 take the dogs out for a walk.I watch  
 T.V. till it is time to get the bus at
 8.15am,then we pick up folk on the way
 to school.I get to school at 8.40am.  
 School starts at 9.00-3.35pm.We have 5
 subjects during school which are      
 Modern Studies,History,Maths,English  
 and Food and Nutrition.               
    After school is finished and I get 
 home, I sometimes play golf. After a  
 while I go in to get my dinner after  
 which I go to the pigeon club  for 3  
 hours.                                
    When we get home I watch T.V. then 
 I go to bed.                          </content>
