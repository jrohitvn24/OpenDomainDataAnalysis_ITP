		<title>15GAMEKEEPING (CONTINUED)</title>
		<content> The{gaming season}starts on the 1st of
 September.Grouse are the most popular 
 game.About 50% of the birds are shot  
 the others just fly away.Fox,crow and 
 rabbits are shot,snared or gassed     
 because they are{enemies}to gamebirds.
 There are quite a number of{Roe deer }
 on the estate which are to be seen in 
 family groups.The game is there       
 primarily for Lord Cowdray and        
 visiting guests.{Germans and Belgians}
 pay a lot of money to hunt the deer.  
 Mr McHutcheon has worked on the estate
 for 15 years and has 6 keepers who    
 work with him.His day begins at 6a.m. 
 in the morning and can continue       
 through until 11p.m. at night;        
 especially during incubation times.   
 There are two kinds of dogs kept by   
 the gamekeeper,labradors which        
 retrieve dead game and the spaniels   
 which hunt live game.                 </content>
