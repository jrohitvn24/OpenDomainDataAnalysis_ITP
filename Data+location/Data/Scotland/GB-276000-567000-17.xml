		<title>17Pollution in Galloway</title>
		<content> Most of the nuclear pollution comes   
 from Windscale. It is let into the    
 Solway. People have estimated there is
 about 0.25 of a ton in the mud and it 
 is increasing every year.             
 There is also acid rain in Galloway.  
 It comes from large factories and     
 power stations all over the world. The
 chemicals are let out of large        
 chimneys and rise into the air. It is 
 then blown around. Some goes to other 
 countries but quite a lot comes to    
 Galloway. When it finally falls as    
 acid rain it kills trees and as it    
 collects in rivers it kills water     
 life. In 1983 it was discovered there 
 were 7 lochs without fish and 11 lochs
 with hardly any fish in Dumfries and  
 Galloway.                             
 This just shows how much damage acid  
 rain does.
