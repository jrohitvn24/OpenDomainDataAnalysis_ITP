 Knockhill Racing Circuit is one of the
 biggest racing circuits in Scotland.  
 The circuit itself lies North West of 
 the town Dunfermline.                 
 The circuit is used for motor_car     
 racing,motor cycle racing,solos and   
 sidecars,kart racing and rally cross  
 motocross.                            
 It was established in 1971 when 200   
 acres of rough grazing was bought and 
 Knockhill Racing circuit was set      
 up. The circuit consisted of the track
 and a few public amenities.           
 At the end of 1984 a change of        
 ownership took place, 130 acres were  
 purchased, the other 70 acres reverted
 to sheep grazing. Many changes were   
 established. The track was improved,  
 surrounding areas were landscaped. Two
 permanent cafes and a bar were built  
 and toilet facilities were provided.  </content>
