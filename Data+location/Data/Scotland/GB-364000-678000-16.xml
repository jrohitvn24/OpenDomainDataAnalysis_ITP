		<title>16THE CLIFF TOP TRAIL</title>
		<content> The Cliff Top Trail covers the        
 picturesque area of cliffs between the
 Country Park and Dunbar castle.       
{Volcanic Features}The features have   
 been formed from the remains of       
 several volcanoes which were active   
 300 million years ago eg the Doo Rock.
 Erosion by the sea has created caves, 
 arches, stacks and reefs.             
                                       
{Vegetation}Man has influenced the     
 plant life along the Trail. The only  
 truly natural plants are those on the 
 cliff faces.Sea Pinks, Harebells,     
 Trefoil and Elderberry can be found.  
                                       
{Wildlife}Many different types of birds
 can be seen here. There are gulls,    
 waders, ducks and other surface       
 divers, as well as many land birds.
