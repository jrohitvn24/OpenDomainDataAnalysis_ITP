		<title>14EILEAN DONAN CASTLE,DORNIE</title>
		<content> The castle is often used by film      
 companies.This is mainly for          
 advertisements but recently it has    
 been the setting of a major motion    
 picture.This was difficult for the    
 staff of the castle as the film       
 company were very particular.They     
 required all sorts of changes to be   
 made including false windows and      
 chimney pots.There was some concern   
 about the use of the main bridge as it
 is not built to take heavyweights.It  
 was not expected that horses would be 
 ridden over it as it is mainly for    
 decoration.The film company had to    
 make many other changes including     
 getting rid of the tarmacadam road,   
 electricity and telephone lines,TV    
 aerials and fences.The castle is      
 popular with the film companies as it 
 has a good background colour and it   
 photographs well.                     </content>
