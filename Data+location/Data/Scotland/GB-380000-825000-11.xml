		<content> By contrast with many towns which rely
 on local government or Social Services
 departments to provide leisure        
 activities, Oldmeldrum has a long     
 tradition of running its own.  In     
 addition to the long list of social   
 clubs in the town, the sports groups  
 include the Meldrum and Bourtie Tennis
 Club, the Golf Club, the soccer and   
 rugby club, the badminton club and the
 rifle club.  There are several dozen  
 squash players in the town who use the
 facilities of the Garioch Squash Club,
 in Inverurie. Leisure activities      
 include aerobic dancing, the Keep Fit 
 class and the yoga group.  The Town   
 Hall in the centre of town provides a 
 meeting place for some activities and 
 the local primary school gymnasium for
 others.  All the active sports, save  
 squash, have pitches, courts and      
 greens around the Pleasure Park.      </content>
