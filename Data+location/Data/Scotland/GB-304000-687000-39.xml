<title>39Carnock Woods - September 2011</title>
<content>

In Carnock woods there were ravens flying around and lots of other birds, 8 or 9 small birds were singing. We saw a lot of ferns, blue berry plants, toadstools called Fly Agaric and an oak tree. There was also heather and logs lying around and a pine tree had fallen on the path. We saw some fungus on a tree. There were two swamps, a lot of bogs and rocks facing down into a giant hole filled with water. Lots of people must walk their dogs here as there was a lot of dog poo.   &lt;br />
