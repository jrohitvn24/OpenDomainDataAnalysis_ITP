		<content>{A NOT SO KINDLY MONSTER               
 There is another monster near us which
 has affected life and opinions in our 
 local area.This is Torness Nuclear    
 Power Station which is being built on 
 the coast six miles from here.        
      For some years now this has      
 caused divided opinions and heated    
 arguments among local people.Some     
 believe that Torness will provide     
 employment and prosperity and indeed  
 in the short term this appears to have
 been the case.                        
 Others are acutely aware of the       
 dangers of Nuclear Power and sevaral  
 pressure groups were formed to protest
 against the building of the power     
 station. The general feeling in       
 locally was that the last thing people
 wanted was a Nuclear Power Station on 
 their doorstep.At present the matter  
 is dormant.                           </content>
