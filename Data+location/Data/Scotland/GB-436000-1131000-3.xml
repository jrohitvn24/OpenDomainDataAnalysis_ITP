		<content> HAVRA IS AN ISLAND ABOUT ONE AND A    
 HALF KILOMETRES SOUTH OF BURRA. IT    
 TAKES ABOUT HALF AN HOUR IN A BOAT TO 
 GET THERE. IT IS UNINHABITED EXCEPT   
 WHEN BURRA CROFTERS GO FOR LAMBING OR 
 TO LOOK AFTER THE SHEEP AT OTHER      
 TIMES. THE LAST PEOPLE TO LIVE THERE  
 FULL TIME LEFT IN MAY 1923. THERE WERE
 ABOUT SIX HOUSES AND A SCHOOL. THERE  
 WAS NO ELECTRICITY AND WATER CAME FROM
 THE WELL.THERE ARE STILL THE REMAINS  
 OF THE HOUSES AND A WINDMILL.         
        FOUR FAMILIES SHARE THE        
 CROFTING RIGHTS TO THE ISLAND AND KEEP
 ONE HOUSE IN GOOD CONDITION. ALL ARE  
 DIRECT DESCENDANTS OF THE WILLIAMSON  
 AND JAMIESON FAMILIES OF HAVRA. CATS  
 WERE PUT ON THE ISLAND TO GET RID OF  
 THE RABBITS AND NOW THERE ARE NO RATS 
 OR MICE OR RABBITS. ON A FINE DAY IN  
 THE SUMMER  PICNICS ARE POPULAR HERE.
