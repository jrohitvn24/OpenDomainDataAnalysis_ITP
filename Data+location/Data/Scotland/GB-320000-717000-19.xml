		<title>19Newburgh in the Future</title>
		<content>    There is a old factory in Newburgh 
 on the shores of the River Tay which  
 made linoleum until 1979 when it was  
 burned down. It has lain empty        
 since then and now looks very ugly    
 against the lovely surrounding        
 countryside. The council are thinking 
 about making a harbour and a housing  
 scheme as it is next to the River Tay.
 This will enable more people to get   
 houses easier in the future.          
    If I had the choice I would make it
 into a sports centre. If it was made  
 into a sports centre there would be   
 more people visiting Newburgh that    
 would normally come. I would like to  
 see a swimming pool, a yachting       
 centre, squash and tennis courts, and 
 perhaps even a golf course. All these 
 things would help to attract more     
 visitors to my town.
