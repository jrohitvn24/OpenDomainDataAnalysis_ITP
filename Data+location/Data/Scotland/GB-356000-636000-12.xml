		<title>12Population,Earlston</title>
		<content> Although Earlston is just a village it
 has quite a large population.It is    
 split into three age groups_          
 pre_school children, school children  
 and voters.There are 150 pre_school   
 children,325 school children and 1296 
 voters making a total of 1771         
 altogether.Of course the population   
 has changed over the years because    
 there has been constant moving in and 
 out but in recent years new houses    
 have been built so the population has 
 risen.There is a big difference in the
 age between the oldest and youngest   
 resident.The youngest is not even one 
 and the oldest is 92.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
