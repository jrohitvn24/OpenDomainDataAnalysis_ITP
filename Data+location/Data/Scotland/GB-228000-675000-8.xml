		<content> Outside Mid Kirk Church, between the  
 church and the drinking well, there is
 a horse shoe in the ground.  The shoe 
 was put there to bring luck to the    
 church.  However, instead of pointing 
 towards the church, thus pouring good 
 luck into it, it is pointing towards  
 the River Clyde taking the good luck  
 away from the church.  Many children  
 sometimes play a dangerous game with a
 ouji board, calling up the spirits of 
 the dead.  One such group succeeded   
 but contacted a 'bad' spirit which    
 held them in a trance.  Luckily, the  
 door bell of the house was rung and   
 broke the spell but the girl who went 
 to answer the door fell down the      
 stairs.  When questioned about this   
 she said she had felt a hand pushing  
 her.                                  
                                       
                                       </content>
