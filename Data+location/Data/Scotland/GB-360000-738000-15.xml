		<title>15ATTITUDES OF ARBROATH KIDS 2</title>
		<content> Although most children appeared to    
 enjoy a wide variety of{recreational} 
 activites they were not short of ideas
 when suggesting what facilities the   
 area lacked.Not suprisingly in view of
 the fact that a lot of them listed ice
 skating as a hobby many of them wished
 to see an ice rink in the area.Also   
 the children said that although there 
 was enough parkland in the area not   
 enough use was made of this{landscape}
 .They wanted to see an adventure      
 playground with tarzan swings,a       
 roundabout,chutes,etc.For{leisure}the 
 children requested that a B.M.X.track 
 be built.Children said that they liked
 living in the area because of the     
 woods nearby,the closeness of the     
 beach,and the fact that they had good 
 friends who stayed close by.
