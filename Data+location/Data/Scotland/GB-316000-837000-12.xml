		<title>12EARLY BALLINDALLOCH HISTORY</title>
		<content> Attached to one wall  of the Church is
 an important group of four carved     
 Pictish Symbol Stones which were found
 originally under the earlier church or
 in the churchyard.They may date from  
 the 4th Century and show an eagle,    
 Celtic beast or elephant,mirrors,     
 crescents and V-rod symbols.          
  At Pitchroy two Standing Stones      
 remain from an early Stone Circle.    
  The waters of a well called St.      
 Peter's Well were once thought to     
 possess curative powers, and          
 votive offerings were found in it.To  
 this day,children of Ballindalloch    
 Castle are christened with its water. 
  Ballindalloch Castle has survived    
 some calamitous events in its history.
 It was,for example, plundered and     
 burned by the Marquis of Montrose in  
 1645, and flooded by the Great Floods 
 in 1829.                              </content>
