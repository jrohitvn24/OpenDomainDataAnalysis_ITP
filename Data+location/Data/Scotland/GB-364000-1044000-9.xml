		<content> In{Northern Burness}there are many    
 miles of sandy beaches which in our   
 area includes{Scar beach.}They are    
 exposed to the north wind and North   
 Sea which make them ideal for         
 beachcombing. On a fresh day you can  
 walk for miles with only the sound of 
 the sea and birds to be heard.        
                                       
 In suitable winds flotsam comes ashore
 making walks interesting. Bits of{fish
{boxes}and{scrap wood}are washed ashore
 and make good firewood.               
                                       
 The beachcomber mustn't take any wood 
 from above the high water mark, for   
 this has already been claimed by      
 someone else. Beachcombers look for   
 interesting objects,especially{bottle 
{messages.}These may have drifted for  
 years in the Atlantic and North Sea   
 tides which meet in Orkney waters.    </content>
