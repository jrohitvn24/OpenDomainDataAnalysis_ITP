		<title>05DALRY CIVIC COUNCIL</title>
		<content> The Civic Council in  Dalry  started  
 in 1974.Their job involves sports,    
 outings,discos,music and computer     
 clubs for youth who had nothing to    
 do in  their spare time               
 At Christmas the Music Club had a     
 concert in aid of Dr.Barnardos Homes. 
 Some ofThe Civic Council think that   
 the job prospects are not good        
 therefore youth organisations are very
 important.                            
 The Council meetings are held once a  
 month in the Community Centre in      
 Dalry, attended by about twenty five  
 people.A new Council is chosen each   
 year.The Council is elected by a      
 person being proposed and then the    
 people that attend the meeting vote   
 for the person they think most        
 suitable.
