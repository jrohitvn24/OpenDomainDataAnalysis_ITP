		<title>01COAST WEST OF TOTRONALD</title>
		<content> Most of GR01120756 is the Atlantic    
 Ocean, off the west coast of the Isle 
 of Coll with the exception of square  
 12 where the coast itself covers about
 half of that square. This area of     
 ground is used as rough grazing for   
 sheep and cattle. It is pretty rocky  
 between the vegetation with many bogs,
 the highest of the rocks being about  
 30 metres. The coast line is mainly   
 rocky with the exception of one or two
 sandy bays where dune grassland has   
 formed immediately after the beach.   
 The grassland has been drained in     
 former times by the use of "lazy-beds"
 and are today still quite obvious. On 
 these beaches a wide variety of drift 
 items line the hightide mark. There   
 are no trees or shrubs on the land.   
 There is also a few rocky islands just
 off the coastline.
