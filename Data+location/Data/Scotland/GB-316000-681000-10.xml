		<title>10Shopping in Dalgety Bay.</title>
		<content> Until 1983 Dalgety Bay had only a     
 small commercial centre comprising a  
 Chinese takeaway, a butcher shop and a
 general store which sold almost       
 everything including confectionery,   
 soft drinks, tinned food, fresh fruit,
 magazines, newspapers and toys. Trade 
 used to be very good until a new      
 shopping centre was built to the west.
 Now trade is not so brisk. However,   
 the butcher is the one shop in the    
 commercial centre that has retained   
 its regular customers because there is
 nowhere else in Dalgety Bay selling   
 fresh meat and poultry. The shopping  
 facilities in Dalgety Bay are         
 inadequate for there are no shops     
 selling clothes, babywear, footwear,  
 furniture, electrical goods or        
 materials for the DIY enthusiast.     
 These goods can only be obtained by   
 travelling to Kirkcaldy or Edinburgh. </content>
