		<content> Castle Forbes lies to the east of Keig
 village amidst wooded policies.  Built
 between 1815 and 1821 it is owned by  
 Malcolm, the Master of Forbes, and    
 occupied by his younger brother, the  
 Hon. Jonathan Forbes, his wife Nicola 
 and their two young daughters.        
                                       
 While not operated as a hotel, the    
 castle is open to paying guests, in   
 particular those from overseas whose  
 ancestors emigrated from the          
 Keig/Alford area and who wish to trace
 their roots by looking up parish      
 registers and other local records.
