		<content>    1891 was when Mrs Ross' house was  
 built.Fields were ploughed with horses
 and a single furrow. Roads were dusty 
 and they had big stones.Carts were    
 pulled with one horse.They planted    
 turnips,potatoes and corn,and they had
 barbed wire round the fields even     
 then.                                 
    People still use the mart the way  
 they do now.They had quite a few      
 windmills to grind the corn.They ate  
 oatmeal,milk, potatoes and berries in 
 the summer.You could only burn peat   
 and wood because they couldn't get    
 coal.For light,candles and paraffin   
 lamps were used.You would have to get 
 up at 5:00am to feed the cattle and   
 the horses.Farms had over 10 chickens 
 in those days and also pigs.
