		<title>16CLAN FRASER</title>
		<content> The Fraser clan is closely linked with
 this area and can be traced back to   
 the 14th century,when a Fraser chief  
 first added "of Lovat" to his title.  
 Fraser is the most common name in the 
 Kiltarlity area.                      
 The 12th Lord Lovat was involved in   
 the intrigue of the Jacobite Rebellion
 of 1745 and was in fact the last      
 person ever to be executed at the     
 Tower of London.The original castle,at
 Dounie,was burned down at this time by
 the Duke of Cumberland's army,and the 
 present Beaufort Castle was later     
 built close to the old castle site.   
 The 16th Lord Lovat,again a Simon     
 Fraser,is remembered as the founder of
 the Lovat Scouts,who fought in the    
 Boer war under the command of Lord    
 Lovat himself.A memorial in the square
 in Beauly commemorates Lord Lovat and 
 his Scouts for their gallantry.       </content>
