		<title>18GALA WEEK</title>
		<content> Each year towards the end of June we  
 have Gala Week.                       
 Events are organised by the Gala      
 Committee  throughout the year to     
 raise funds to cover the cost of      
 prizes and the events of Gala Week.   
 The Primary school is closely involved
 choosing the Gala Queen and her       
 attendants and entering the various   
 competitions.                         
 Local shops enter into the spirit     
 by presenting appropriate window      
 displays from which the youngest      
 pupils select a winner.               
 Gala Day at Victoria Park brings the  
 week to a climax with the crowning of 
 the Queen who then presides over a    
 variety of events.                    
 This year,however,the inclement       
 weather forced events indoors at the  
 Town Hall.                            
                                       </content>
