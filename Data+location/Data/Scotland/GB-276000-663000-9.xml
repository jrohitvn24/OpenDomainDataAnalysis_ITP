		<title>09AIRDRIE'S NEW HOSPICE 1</title>
		<content>  THERE IS A SMALL NURSING HOME IN     
 AIRDRIE CALLED ASSUMPTION HOUSE. THE  
 SISTERS OF CHARITY WHO WORK THERE,    
 DECIDED THAT AS IT WAS TOO SMALL      
 AIRDRIE AND ITS NEIGHBOURING TOWNS    
 NEEDED A HOSPICE- AND SO THE PROJECT  
 BEGAN.                                
      THE TOWN COUNCIL HAS LEASED THE  
 SITE OF THE HOSPICE TO THE SISTERS FOR
 99 YEARS. THE MONEY FOR THE BUILDING  
 AND EQUIPMENT IS BEING SUPPLIED BY THE
 ORDINARY PEOPLE. THE CHARITY DRIVES   
 ARE CO-ORDINATED BY A COMMITTEE WHOSE 
 CHAIRMAN IS BOBBY WATSON EX-PLAYER OF 
 GLASGOW RANGERS FOOTBALL TEAM AND EX- 
 MANAGER OF AIRDRIONIANS F.C. AT THIS  
 MOMENT Â£1,000,000 IS NEEDED STILL.    
      THE HOSPICE WILL PROVIDE THIRTY  
 PLACES FOR PATIENTS OF ALL            
 DENOMINATIONS.IT WILL COME UNDER THE  
 AUSPICES OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH       
 SERVICE BUT WITH 3 PRIVATE BEDS.      </content>
