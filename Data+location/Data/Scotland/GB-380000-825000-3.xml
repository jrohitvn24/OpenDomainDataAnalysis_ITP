		<title>03Meldrum and Bourtie Parishes</title>
		<content> The town of Oldmeldrum dominates from 
 its position on the ridge but         
 residents of surrounding farmland     
 consider themselves separate from the 
 town, and align themselves with the   
 old parish boundaries of Meldrum and  
 Bourtie. The town covers just about   
 half a square mile, whereas the parish
 of Meldrum covers 8000 acres to the   
 north and east and Bourtie 5500 acres 
 to the south.  Population figures for 
 1984 give an estimate of 1770         
 residents in Meldrum parish, of whom  
 1580 live in the town; Bourtie has a  
 population of 265. Meldrum acivities  
 centre on the town but Bourtie is a   
 thriving community whose farmers      
 organize an annual dance - the Bourtie
 Farmers' - in November and farmers'   
 wives meet every month in the church  
 hall for activities like flower bulb  
 shows and homemade jam &amp; cake displays</content>
