		<title>01   The GEAR Project.</title>
		<content> The Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal fund 
 was set up in the Seventies to        
 overcome the decline of the East      
 End.The priorities were jobs, housing,
 environment and the quality of        
 life.The project has cost millions of 
 pounds already and many organisations 
 have contributed.                     
 People in the area used to work in    
 huge engineering factories, but now   
 most of them are closed.G.E.A.R. has  
 set up new factory units, and training
 schemes for young people.Most of the  
 old tenements have been renovated and 
 hundreds of new houses, many of them  
 privately owned, have been built.     
 Many historical buildings have been   
 restored and the environment has been 
 improved by landscaping, tree planting
 and the creation of all kinds of      
 recreation areas, from small play     
 parks to the huge Crownpoint Complex. </content>
