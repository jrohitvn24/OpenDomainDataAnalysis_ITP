		<title>08St David's Harbour, Fife</title>
		<content> St David's Harbour is now closed and  
 is being considered for possible      
 housing development. It was still     
 working up to{1983}as a breakers yard 
 and storage dump for council road     
 grit.                                 
                                       
 The last major breaking job it had was
 the{HMS Revenge}which was hit by a    
 German freighter under the Forth Rail 
 Bridge and sunk. It was raised and    
 towed to St David's Harbour where it  
 was broken up.                        
                                       
 In former days St David's harbour was 
 used as a coal port for exporting coal
 to the{Netherlands}and{Belgium}and    
 many of Fife's roof tiles came as     
 ballast in the coal ships. This trade 
 ceased in 1946.
