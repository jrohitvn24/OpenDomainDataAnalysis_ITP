		<content> One farmer said that the opportunities
 for young people to take up farming   
 were a source of concern.             
                                       
 Mechanisation means that fewer people 
 are needed to do the jobs on the farm,
 and the larger sizes of farms means   
 that it would be difficult for younger
 people to buy them.  This means       
 there might be a greater number of    
 young people going into to the towns  
 for employment, perhaps getting houses
 there.  This would mean fewer people  
 in the country areas.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
