		<content> Oldmeldrum is a market town surrounded
 by prime farming land. Its name is a  
 corruption of the Pictish Celt Allt   
 meall druim, meaning the burn by the  
 rise on the hill. With the development
 of oil exploration in the 1970s,      
 Oldmeldrum became a dormitory town -  
 half the male population working on   
 oil rigs in the North Sea or in oil-  
 related industries in Aberdeen. It has
 retained its market character, in     
 spite of a rise of one-third in       
 population between 1980 and 1985. New 
 housing has been added on the fringes 
 of the town, maintaining the oldest   
 18th Century buildings within the     
 conservation area which focusses on   
 the Square and Town Hall. East of the 
 town the Pleasure Park host Oldmeldrum
 Sports held for the last 50 years.    
 Proceeds from this gala of highland   
 games to to local sports groups.      </content>
