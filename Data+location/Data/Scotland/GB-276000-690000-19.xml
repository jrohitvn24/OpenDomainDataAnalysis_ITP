		<content> Every Friday the whole of the Scown   
 family get up early. They get dressed 
 and go down for breakfast. After      
 breakfast Mr. and Mrs. Scown go to    
 work while the children go to school. 
 Mr. Scown is the Manager of a computer
 company and his wife is his secretary.
 After school both children go to table
 tennis and don't come home till six   
 o'clock.By the time they get home the 
 evening meal is ready. After tea they 
 do their homework and go swimming.    
 While they are swimming their Mum and 
 Dad go to squash. They all get home   
 around 8 o'clock when they usually    
 have their supper and a family        
 discussion. The children go to bed at 
 9.30p.m. and the parents go between   
 11.30p.m. and midnight. Every Saterday
 morning the family  play tennis, have 
 their lunch in the Pavilion and go out
 for the day.  (W.Brown, L.Scobie.)    </content>
