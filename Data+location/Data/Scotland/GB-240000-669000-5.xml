		<content>   The oldest remaining house is a     
 farmhouse called Bishopton Old Inn    
 which used to be a coaching inn on the
 route from Glasgow to Greenock. Most  
 of the other houses fall into 4 age   
 groups.                               
   Those built between 1900 and 1940   
 were for private owners. In the 1950's
 private houses were built by Keanie,  
 the local authorities and the Royal   
 Ordnance Factory. Wimpey built large  
 private estates in the 1960's and     
 1970's. Few houses have been built    
 since 1976 as most of the land for    
 housing has been used.                
   1 km west of Bishopton stand 3      
 houses known as"the 3 Bears" because  
 1 is big,1 is medium-sized and 1 is   
 small.
