		<title>18MONZIE ESTATE</title>
		<content>   Monzie castle and part of the estate
 are situated in the most western      
 region of our area.  The entire estate
 covers 1750 hectares and is inherited 
 by Mr Macgill-Crighton-Stuart.  20    
 people are employed on the estate     
 running both the farm and the joinery.
 90% of the estate is used for farming 
 most of which is upland and hill      
 farming.  The main farming activity is
 the rearing of lambs and suckled      
 calves.                               
   The joinery is a new venture for the
 estate using wood from Scandinavia and
 the U.S.A.  The produce is sold to the
 Scottish domestic market with very    
 little being exported.                
   The estate also has its own         
 electricity and water supply, with the
 excess being sold to the grid.  There 
 is also grouse shooting on the estate 
 but lately there have been few grouse.</content>
