		<title>16HOMELIFE  MY WEEKEND</title>
		<content>{ROSS EARLY   AGE 11                   
{SATURDAY:}I like Saturday. I waken up 
 at 7.30 a.m. have cornflakes, toast   
 and milk for breakfast. I then play   
 until my Mum wakens up. About 9 a.m. I
 go shopping in Dornoch with my Mum. We
 go to the newsagent, grocer, toy shop 
 and to the butchers. When we get back 
 to Camore I get my 35 pence pocket    
 money which I spend on sweets at the  
 local shop. After lunch which consists
 of sandwiches and a drink I play with 
 my friends or on my bike. After a meal
 in the evening I watch the television 
 before going to bed at 10 o'clock.{   
{SUNDAY: }I get up at 8 o'clock on a   
 Sunday and play. Mum makes breakfast  
 about 10 o'clock. I play until dinner 
 is made at 3 o'clock. Sometimes our   
 family goes for a walk. I watch T.V.  
 and have a snack supper before going  
 to bed about 8 p.m. Sunday is boring. </content>
