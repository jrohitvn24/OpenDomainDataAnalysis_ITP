		<content> A third of the block is sea the outer 
 Moray Firth. Golspie pier is in the   
 N, used now only for a few lobster    
 boats. To the S is Golspie Golf       
 Course, a fine links course with the  
 road to Littleferry running W of it.  
 Balblair Wood, a plantation of mixed  
 conifer and broadleaf trees, fills the
 SW corner. Between it and the A9 is   
 good farmland growing fine crops of   
 barley, oats, turnips, hay, potatoes. 
 No crofts here, only farms of some    
 size by local standards. They are     
 Sutherland Estate farms. Drummuie Farm
 is run by a resident farmer as a      
 training school for the pupils of     
 Golspie High School (secondary school 
 for all of Sutherland). The school's  
 technical annexe is beside the farm.
