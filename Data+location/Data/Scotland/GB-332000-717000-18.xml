		<content> IN{COUNTRYSIDE AREAS LIKE CREICH}AND  
{MOONZIE,}LIFE STYLES DIFFER           
 SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE OF THE TOWN  
 OR CITY_DWELLER.THE PRINCIPAL         
 DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE OF TOPOGRAPHY OF
 THE AREA;THE NEAREST TOWN IS 7\KM.    
 DISTANT,WHICH NECESSITATES THE DAILY  
 USE OF SOME FORM OF TRANSPORT FOR     
 THOSE (THE MAJORITY OF WORKERS) WHO DO
 NOT WORK LOCALLY.HOUSEWIVES HAVE TO   
 PLAN THEIR MEALS WELL IN ADVANCE,SINCE
 THERE ARE NO LOCAL SHOPS,EXCEPT FOR   
 MOBILE SHOPS SELLING MEAT,FISH,       
 GROCERIES AND BAKERY GOODS WHICH CALL 
 TWICE WEEKLY.BECAUSE THE HOUSES ARE   
 WIDELY SCATTERED,VILLAGE HALL         
 ENTERTAINMENT IS USUALLY VERY WELL    
 ATTENDED. MOST PEOPLE WATCH TV AND    
 LISTEN TO THE RADIO.THERE IS A VILLAGE
 COMMUNITY COUNCIL DEALING WITH        
 PROBLEMS CONCERNING THE UPKEEP AND    
 MAINTENANCE OF THE VILLAGE.           </content>
