		<title>06A Roof Over Our Heads</title>
		<content>  During the past ten years,{Banchory  
  ,a small eighteen miles west of      
 Aberdeen,has increased dramatically.  
 What was once a quiet, peacful, little
 community with a population of less   
 than two thousand has suddenly        
 exploded into a busy,bustling place   
 with over seven thousand inhabitants. 
 Originally our town catered for       
 visitors,and provided an ideal        
 retirement haven,but now many homes   
 are required for the vast number of   
 families who have come to live in this
 part of the world.                    
  We have many house types in our town 
 ranging from a "but and ben,"to four  
 or five bedroomed residences.While    
 some houses have been here since the  
 middle of the nineteenth century      
 others are only a few years old and in
 fact many are at this moment in time  
 under construction.                   </content>
