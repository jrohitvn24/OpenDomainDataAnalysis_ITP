		<content> The Scottish Fisheries Museum stands  
 by the harbour in the heart of the    
 Neuk fishing towns of - Crail centre  
 of local crab and lobster fishing - St
 Monans, where wooden fishing boats are
 still builts and - Pittenweem, the    
 present home of the East Neuk fleet.  
   It is housed in a group of buildings
 of historic and architectural interest
 around 4 sides of a cobbled courtyard 
 and illustrates every aspect of the   
 Scottish Fishing Industry.            
   You can see an Aquarium Room with a 
 large collection of fish caught in    
 Scottish waters, a display of model   
 vessels and the interior of a         
 fisherman's home around 1900.  The    
 courtyard has a few small wooden boats
 and a collection of nets and anchors. 
   The museum is proud to have obtained
 2 real fishing boats - a "Zulu" and a 
 "Fifie" which they are restoring now. </content>
