		<title>02   Linlithgow's Growth</title>
		<content>{  Linlithgow}originally started off   
 many hundreds of years ago as a clump 
 of houses around the Palace.As more   
 people came to live in{Linlithgow}    
 houses were built along the High      
 Street and gradually the population   
 grew.Many of these old houses remain  
 in the High Street and are now listed 
 buildings which means they are        
 preserved by the state because they   
 are historic buildings.               
   In 1977 eight and a half thousand   
 people lived in{Linlithgow }and by    
 1981 one thousand more people had     
 moved to the town.Since the 1970's    
{Linlithgow}has grown considerably.In  
 our area many new estates have been   
 built.{Springfield}was begun about 10 
 years ago and they are still building 
 onto it.Many people who live in       
{Linlithgow}feel that it is getting too
 big and would like building ended.    </content>
