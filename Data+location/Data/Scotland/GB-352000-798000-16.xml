		<title>16Changing Times in Aboyne</title>
		<content> Aboyne has changed within the past few
 years as much as it did within the    
 past century.  About ten years ago    
 there was a sudden influx of people   
 because of the{North Sea Oil}         
 development in Aberdeen.  This led to 
{houses}being built in every available 
 space throughout Aboyne.  New         
{businesses}were set up and Aboyne     
 started to take on a new look.  Aboyne
 Business Centre was opened at the     
 beginning of 1984 and included a range
 of businesses from hairdressing to    
 surveying.  Today Aboyne has much more
{tourism}than ever before and is well  
 equipped for it, hosting a caravan    
 park situated beside the loch, golf   
 course and a number of hotels and     
 restuarants.  Aboyne is now much more 
 commercialised and no longer the      
 sleepy village it was at one time.
