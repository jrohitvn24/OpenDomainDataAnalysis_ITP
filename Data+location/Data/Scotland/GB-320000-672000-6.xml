		<title>06GORGIE FARM,EDINBURGH.</title>
		<content>   Gorgie farm is a really good idea.  
 Five years ago it was started at a    
 dump in the middle of a very busy     
 district.It had once been railway     
 ground and they have a big problem    
 because of concrete under the shallow 
 soil.M.S.C.workers and volunteers     
 are managing to grow vegetables,which 
 are then sold.This year they are      
 trying to grow wheat,barley and oats. 
 In the small garden there is also a   
 large variety of herbs.               
   Rust the pig has two piglets,Pancake
 and Pizza.Black Shetland lambs with   
 their mothers,and a Jacob sheep live  
 in a large sunny pen.Anoushka,one of  
 the three goats has two friendly      
 kids.The largest animal is Pye,the    
 cart-horse,who used to do a milk      
 round in Gorgie until his firm retired
 all their horses.Local children visit 
 Gorgie farm and help with the work.   </content>
