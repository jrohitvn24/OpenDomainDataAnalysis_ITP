		<title>17FOSTERING CHILDREN</title>
		<content> Fostering is providing a home for a   
 child or children who for some reason 
 cannot be with their own parents eg.  
 because of illness, death or physical 
 abuse. The local authority place these
 children into foster homes, and an    
 allowance is paid accordingly to the  
 needs of the child. We took a boy who 
 had been locked up while his parents  
 went drinking. It was a long time     
 before he settled and would play with 
 a door shut. Another child would often
 be found sleeping on the stairs,      
 having crept down long after we'd     
 tucked her up in bed, fearing we'd    
 left while she was sleeping.  These   
 children have moved on but it is      
 important to them and others that they
 are welcomed both in the foster home  
 and the community. We find the people 
 of Dolphinton very helpful towards us 
 in this respect.                      </content>
