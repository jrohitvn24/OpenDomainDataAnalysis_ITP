 old.Most farms have buildings for     
 machinery like combine harvesters.    
 We have quite a lot of{cottages}in the
 area. Most of the cottages have four  
 or five rooms. They have two bedrooms 
 and a small living room. Most of the  
 cottages are in Little Ballinluig. Two
 or three people can live in the       
 cottages.
