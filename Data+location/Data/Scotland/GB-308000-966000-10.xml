		<content> William Alexander Smith was born in   
 October 1854 at Pennyland Farm,Thurso.
 He founded The Boys' Brigade in 1883  
 while living in Glasgow, although it  
 is claimed he formed the first company
 of boys in Thurso when he was only 11 
 years old. The movement was begun to  
 bring religion and discipline into    
 every boy's life.  Centenary          
 celebrations took place in 1983. There
 is a granite memorial set into the    
 wall of Pennyland House.  Robert Dick 
 who came to Thurso in 1830 lived in a 
 house near the harbour.He rediscovered
 the Northern Holygrass which was      
 thought to be extinct. His famous     
 collection of insects, plants, rocks  
 and fossils can be seen in Thurso     
 Museum.He had a considerable knowledge
 of botany and geology. The public     
 erected a memorial to his memory in   
 Thurso churchyard.                    </content>
