		<content> Two of the bus services through West  
 Linton to Edinburgh are from Biggar   
 and Dumfries. Some of the buses are   
 routed through Penicuik-a nearby town.
   There are only two return buses a   
 week to Peebles on Tuesday and Friday 
 morning. These are privately owned.   
   One of the two buses that takes the 
 pupils to Peebles High School during  
 the week is a regular service bus     
 supplied by the Eastern Scottish bus  
 company. Passengers can use it in the 
 mornings and evenings  .              
   There is little demand for buses to 
 Peebles as few people work there .    
 Edinburgh has many more shops with    
 greater variety than Peebles.         
   Trains were discontinued in 1934    
 and the demand for buses is not very  
 high as most people have their own    
 cars which they use to travel into    
 Edinburgh to work.                    </content>
