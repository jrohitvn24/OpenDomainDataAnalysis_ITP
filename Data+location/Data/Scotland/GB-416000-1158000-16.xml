		<title>16Archaeology on Papa Stour.</title>
		<content> Papa Stour (rhymes with cure) comes   
 from the Norse "{Papa ey Storr}" which
 means the big island of the priests,  
 (there is also a Papa Little).        
   The island has been inhabited since 
 the stone-age and archaeological      
 remains are abundant.There are        
 chambered cairns and broch sites as   
 well as the more recent remains of an 
 18th century leper colony and 19th.   
 century horizontal water mills.       
   The discovery of an ancient law     
 suite prompted Dr.B.Crawford to invest
 igate old place names,in an attempt to
 pinpoint the site of Duke Haakon's    
 palace(he later became king of Norway)
   Since then, digging has gone on at  
 the most likely site i.e.Biggins (old 
 name{Nordaflo"}).The foundations of a 
 substantial building have yielded some
 textiles and a lot of medieval pottery
  _but as yet nothing conclusive.      </content>
