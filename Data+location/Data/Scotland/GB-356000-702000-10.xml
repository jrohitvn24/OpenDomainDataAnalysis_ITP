		<title>10Anstruther Police Force</title>
		<content>  Anstruther Police Force consists of  
 12 officers covering an area from     
 Crail to Lundin Links which takes     
 about 30 minutes to patrol depending  
 on the traffic. Seven officers are    
 situated in neighbouring towns and    
 receive most of their instructions by 
 walkie-talkie or car radio. Based in  
 Anstruther are 5 officers who carry a 
 notebook, pencil, handcuffs, radio and
 whistle which is more for show now.   
  The Anstruther Station has 2 cars    
 both Vauxhall Astras. The station's   
 busiest time is in the summer when all
 the holidaymakers are here.           
  Our local sergeant helped to train   
 Cellardyke Primary's Cycling          
 Proficiency Teams who came first and  
 second in the Fife Competition to win 
 the RAC cup. This is the first year   
 the competition has been held and we  
 all felt very proud of our teams.     </content>
