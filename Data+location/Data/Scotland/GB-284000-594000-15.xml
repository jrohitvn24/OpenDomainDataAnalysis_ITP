		<title>15CLUBS AND EVENTS</title>
		<content>   Over 40 clubs exist in the Thorhill 
 area. These cater for a great variety 
 of tastes but fall into 4 main classes
 :- sporting clubs eg fishing, squash  
 and tennis; Youth clubs eg scouts;    
 Debating clubs including Young        
 Farmers, Rotary Club, WRI and craft   
 clubs such as dress making, fly tying 
 and crook making. Five years ago the  
 school offered the use of its premises
 and equipment at low cost to these    
 clubs during the winter season and    
 now, any week-day night the school is 
 bustling with adult education classes.
 Several clubs join the Community      
 Council in organising the annual      
 Thornhill Gala during the second week 
 of July. After crowning the "Queen",  
 activities during that week include   
 street parties, stunt riding, pipe    
 band displays, float processions,     
 street busking and various contests.  </content>
