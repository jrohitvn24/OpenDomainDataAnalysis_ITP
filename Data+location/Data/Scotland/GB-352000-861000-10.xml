 Our school used to be the very famous 
 Fordyce Academy.P.7 pupils had to sit 
 the "Eleven Plus" exam.&amp; went to Banff
 Academy or Buckie High School for     
 Language,Technical or Cookery Courses,
 to Macduff High for Secretarial or to 
 Fordyce for Languages only.Once there 
 were 100 pupils here,but this decreas-
 ed until in l964 the Secondary Dept.  
 closed &amp; the Primary moved over from  
 the old building.Academy pupils wore a
 maroon blazer &amp; badge with Fordyce    
 Castle &amp; motto "Praesis ut Prosis",   
 meaning "Get on in life &amp; help others"
 They also had a tie with maroon and   
 blue stripes which we have revived for
 the Primary School.We have now only 44
 pupils who move to Banff Academy, a   
 comprehensive school,on completing P.7
