		<content>  Access to the technology park was    
 convenient, and the nearby airport    
 provides a direct link to London and  
 Europe.                               
  The environment and views were       
 attractive. The S.D.A. restricted the 
 companies to non-polluting - e.g.     
 electronics or pharmaceutical. The    
 environment had to be safeguarded     
 because of the nearby Ninewells       
 Hospital. The area is to be landscaped
 with broadleaved trees and shrubs.    
  So far only one company has started  
 to build.W.L.Gore and Associates, a   
 multi-national company doing work for 
 the Ministry of Defence.              
   Phase 1- Co-axial cables.           
   Phase 2- Protective clothing.       
   Phase 3- To be decided.             
  The site of this factory is to cover 
 25 acres and they hope to employ 600  
 associates. Work commenced June 1985. </content>
