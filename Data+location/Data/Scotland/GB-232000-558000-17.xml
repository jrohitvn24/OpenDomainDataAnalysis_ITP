 families had a pump beside the sink in
 the kitchen.Others had their{pump}    
 outside,sometimes in the{wash house.} 
 For Saturday bath time water was      
 brought from the boiler into a bath in
 front of the{range.}For Monday{washday
 water was heated in the boiler and the
 clothes were scrubbed{on a wash board.
 Because there was{no electricity}the  
 houses were lit by{paraffin lamps}    
 which had to be cleaned,filled and    
 wicks trimmed ready for the next day. 
 By their light rag rugs were made on  
 hessian sacks.When going to bed,people
 carried a candle in a holder.In the   
 kitchen there was a range on which    
 they baked and cooked.There was a{swee
 where a pot or girdle hung above the  
 range.The{toilet} was a bucket covered
 by a seat in a hut in the garden.
