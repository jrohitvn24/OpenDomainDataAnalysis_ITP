		<content> Fordoun village used to be known as   
 Fordoun Station because this was the  
 only place the trains stopped in the  
 parish of Fordoun. The village grew up
 only because of the station and the   
 first buildings were erected in       
 Station road.  About the beginning of 
 the century houses were built in      
 Springbank Terrace.  Half the houses  
 in the village were built from 1960 to
 the present day.  These houses lie in 
 Toch-hill Road and Redhall Place.  Old
 Fordoun - The sation house was built  
 around 1836.  it was clsed in the     
 1960's.  The post office has been here
 since at least 1867.  letters are no  
 longer sorted there but nowadays the  
 shop also sells groceries.  The       
 baker's shop, cobbler, saddler, smidy 
 and sweet shops are all now houses.
