		<title>15HOUSING IN BALLATER</title>
		<content> During the reign of Victoria the      
 village of Ballater acquired its      
 regular pattern of streets and smart  
 new villas in Scottish Baronial style 
 and conversions of original thatched  
 cottages. More recent additions have  
 included small local authority housing
 schemes and some up-market private    
 development.                          
 Many of the small traditional houses  
 have become second homes for city     
 dwellers or are let to visitors. Many 
 of the Victorian mansion houses have  
 been converted into hotels or         
 old-folks homes. There has been some  
 imaginative provision of sheltered    
 housing for senior citizens by the    
 District Council.Property prices are  
 very high. Local residents are often  
 unable to afford to buy their own     
 homes and have to rely on public      
 provision.                            </content>
