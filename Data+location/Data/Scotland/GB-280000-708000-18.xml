 are races for different ages which    
 start with the flat race.  While the  
 races are going on there are different
 side shows set up by local groups.    
 There was a {fish for ducks }for      
 toddlers, an {aunt sally,}a {bottle   
{stall,}a tea and coffee stall and a   
 mini bar, {target golf }and {throwing 
{the wellie. }There were parachutists  
 who were brilliant, one of them landed
 in the Roman Camps though he wasn't   
 meant to! The pipers played some more 
 music then there was a tug of war.    
 The teams were {Landward, Ardoch      
{and Grinnan, Greenhaugh and the Alloa 
{Pipers. Landward } was the winner but 
 it was very close. After that was the 
 school relay, Braco against

{Fun Run}was next which goes right     
 round the Castle Drive (3 miles).     </content>
