 Cults East Church was built in 1901.  
 One Saturday in January 1941 the      
 church was burnt down.The fire started
 in the boiler-room and many people    
 think that it was caused by the boiler
 being stoked up too high with coal.   
 This caused the fire door to burst    
 open and hot coals set fire to the    
 building.                             
 There is now only a small part of the 
 old church still standing.The present 
 building was built in 1959.It was not 
 built in 1941 because the war was on  
 and only essential buildings were     
 allowed.Churches were not considered  
 essential buildings.The money for the 
 present church was provided by the    
 people themselves.                    
 The present minister is Donald Rennie 
 who has been minister for 11 years.
