		<title>11PORT ELPHINSTONE INVERURIE</title>
		<content> The "port in the country" is what Port
 Elphinstone is. It was the port at the
 inland end of the Aberdeenshire Canal.
 Many houses were built to provide     
 housing for people connected with the 
 canal. Today almost all that remains  
 to remind us of the canal are the     
 names of some of the houses and some  
 of the streets. e.g.Canal Road,       
 Ladeside Road.                        
                                       
 As well as houses, a number of mills  
 were built near the canal. These      
 included grain, meal and bone mills   
 non of which are still in use         
 today. The canal and the mills brought
 people to Port Elphinstone and the    
 community grew.                       
                                       
 In 1854 the canal was closed to be    
 replaced by a railway line which      
 followed the route of the canal.      </content>
