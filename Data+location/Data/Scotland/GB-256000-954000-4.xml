		<content> The following letter was sent to      
 'Blue Peter', the children's very     
 popular TV programme.                 
 'I am writing to tell you about our   
 conservation of frogs. Our teacher    
 found the spawn in a puddle between   
 the goal posts on our football pitch  
 in February. She took them home and   
 for  while they stayed in a seed box. 
 Then they were put in a fish tank with
 weeds.When they were brought into     
 school they were all sandy and we     
 didn't know if they would survive.    
 But now they are wriggling about and  
 some have legs.In a few weeks we are  
 going to let them go in a pond.'      
 Blue Peter answered the letter and    
 sent the writer a badge.              
 The tadpoles were released in two     
 batches and it is hoped that some of  
 them managed to survive.
