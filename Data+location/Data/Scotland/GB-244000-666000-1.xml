		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY OF LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> The area is north of Paisley and is   
 part of the Scottish midlands. The    
 land is flat, low-lying floodplain    
 drained by the rivers Gryfe and Black 
 Cart Water. Broom Hill(36m)is the     
 highest point, and to the north. The  
 area is mainly agricultural. There are
 intensive dairy farms due to mild, wet
 climate and deep, fertile soils giving
 good quality grass and high milk      
 yields for the large urban markets    
 nearby. The M8, A726 and B790 are the 
 main roads which pass through the     
 area. A British Rail railway line also
 passes through the area. Glasgow      
 airport occupies land in the          
 easternmost square. The airport is the
 major employer in the area. Road      
 widening and the new Barnsford Bridge 
 are under construction. Woodland to W 
 and NW occupies about 8% of the area.
