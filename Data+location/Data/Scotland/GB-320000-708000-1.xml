		<title>01Strathmiglo and its environs</title>
		<content> Strathmiglo  is a small village with a
 population of just over 900, situated 
 in the north west of Fife, in the     
 valley of the River Eden. Formerly the
 Eden was known as the Miglo at this   
 point, hence, Strathmiglo - valley of 
 the Miglo.The Eden divides the village
 into  roughly two halves. The High    
 Street,the main business street,with  
 its Town Hall (1734), is on the north 
 side and roughly parallel on the south
 side is Cash Feus and a continuation  
 known as Skene Street. The land rises 
 gently to the north and south of the  
 village towards the Ochil and Lomond  
 Hills. Most of the land is rich       
 farmland, the most important crops    
 being wheat and barley. Much of the   
 underlying rock formation is red      
 sandstone, which in the past was      
 quarried and used for many local      
 buildings.                            </content>
