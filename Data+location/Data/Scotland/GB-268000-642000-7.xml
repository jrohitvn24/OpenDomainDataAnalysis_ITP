		<content> According to the 1981 Census there    
 were more females than males in the   
 district.There were 3206 females and  
 2933 males,therefore the overall      
 population was 6139.On the day the    
 census was taking place however 30    
 people were visiting Strathaven and 84
 people were staying in Public         
 Establishments i.e. hotels etc.The    
 actual population was therefore       
 6109(2959 males and 3150 females).    
      About two thirds of the          
 population (4025) lived in council    
 houses and the rest (2084) owned their
 homes or were members of families who 
 did.We did a survey to see how many   
 people worked outside Strathaven and  
 found that 70 out of the hundred      
 people asked worked outside           
 Strathaven.From this we can see that  
 Strathaven is largely a town of       
 commuters(mainly to East Kilbride).   </content>
