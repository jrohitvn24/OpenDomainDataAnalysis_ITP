 Memorial on Corsdarder hill,is said to
 mark where this Celtic chief fell in  
 battle. It was broken during road     
 improvements,hence the iron bars      
 clamping it together.                 
{The Long Cairn}is a Bronze Age burial 
 site,complying with the specific      
 measurements used.It is in the woods  
 behind the War Memorial to the South.

 at Woodside of Ennochie joined by a   
 common branch.

 Feugh,was used to grind or bruise oats
 :meantime in need of repair and       
 renovation,unlike the sawmill and     
 turning mill further upriver,also     
 water powered but in full production.
