		<title>10TOURIST OFFICE</title>
		<content> This office is just across from the   
 Pier where the{St.Ola}docks with its  
 freight and passengers.From a small   
 beginning Mrs Garson, with sometimes  
 extra helpers ,deals with 12,000      
 people per year.The busiest months are
 obviously in the summer,and especially
 busy is Shopping Week,in July People  
 come from all over the World,but are  
 mostly British or American.Some can't 
 speak any English but there's always  
 someone around to interpret. The most 
 popular questions are about Skara Brae
 or transport to Hoy.Mrs Garson has had
 some funny experiences and she keeps  
 these in a book.Many have problems    
 pronouncing Orkney place names.The    
 Interpretation Room next door gives   
 extra pictorial information about     
 Orkney.There is also an accommodation 
 service linked with Scotland to make  
 sleeping arrangements easier.         </content>
