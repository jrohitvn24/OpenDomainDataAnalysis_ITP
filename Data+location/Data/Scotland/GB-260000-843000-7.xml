		<content>   The area we are covering is fairly  
 popular with tourists. A lot of people
 come from the south of Scotland,      
 England or even from abroad. In our   
 block there is a caravan site and     
 houses with bed and breakfast         
 available fot the tourists. While they
 are staying on the caravan site,      
 people can walk on the beach or the   
 children might play on the swings.    
 There is a shop on the site which     
 sells food and newspapers. There is   
 room for a hundred touring vans and   
 there are showers, toilets and laundry
 facilities. The cost for one night is 
 Â£3.45 or Â£4.10 at the height of the   
 season.                               
   Some of the houses in the area      
 provide bed and breakfast. My mum has 
 got room for 5 people. Although we can
 make lunch and dinner, most people go 
 away for the day.                     </content>
