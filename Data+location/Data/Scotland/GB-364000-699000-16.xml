		<title>16Ecology - Mammals</title>
		<content> There are three mammals which can be  
 seen on the Isle of May.              
 Rabbits are everywhere, and in        
 mediaeval times were farmed, providing
 a source of income for the monks who  
 owned the island. The black rabbits   
 which are sometimes seen are          
 decendants of pets kept by the        
 lighthouse keepers families.          
 The house mice are not easily observed
 but are the subject of research by    
 various Universities. There existance 
 has been sustained by the lighthouse  
 keepers although some are now adapted 
 to live outdoor all year round.       
 Finally, grey seals use the North Sea 
 as a hauling-out site and in recent   
 years a breeding colony has           
 established itself there, perhaps an  
 offshoot of the main east coast colony
 of the Farne Islands.
