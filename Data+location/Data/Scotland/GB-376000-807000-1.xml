		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF BLOCK</title>
		<content>  Most of the land in our block is{farm
{land.}There is some grazing land and  
 some fields which had been ploughed   
 for planting crops.Most of the animals
 we saw were cattle and sheep.         
{Skene school}lies in the south east   
 corner of our block.It looked small   
 and old.                              
 The{Loch of Skene}dominates almost one
 whole square.Aberdeen sailing club use
 the loch in the winter.We also saw    
 Dunecht power scheme built in 1923 not
 far from the loch.                    
 There are two tower houses beside     
 the loch which were built in 1923.    
{Game}like golden pheasant and grouse  
 are kept on the estate.There were a   
 few places where there was burnt      
 heather.This encouraged new shoots for
 the grouse to eat.                    
 We passed Gairloch's{blacksmith}which 
 used to be an old church.             </content>
