 Any number can play this game. One    
 person is the pig, the rest are flying
 things. Everyone stands in a space.   
 The pig shouts any word, then says    
 "Fly!" e.g. if the pig says "Superman 
 flies!" that's true, so everyone flaps
 their arms, but if he says "Horses    
 fly!" which is not true, and if anyone
 flaps their arms they are out. You can
 also be out if the pig says "Pigs     
 fly!" then everyone has to run away   
 from the pig. The person who is caught
 is out. The last one out is the       
 winner.                               
{Cheeky Nelly                          
 Cheeky Nelly is a game any number can 
 play. We knock on doors then run and  
 hide behind a wall or a corner. The   
 person comes out and is angry at us   
 and we laugh at him. Aren't we a      
 horrible bunch!                       </content>
