		<title>08INSH MARSHES - 1</title>
		<content>{Insh Marshes}are situated in the flood
 plain of the{River Spey}and are the   
 largest marshes outside Anglia.  In   
 1973, thanks to the Cadbury family,   
{The Royal Society for the Protection  
{of Birds}(R.S.P.B.) were able to      
 purchase 564 acres of marsh and       
 woodland and with subsequent          
 leasing from sympathetic landowners   
 now manage an area of{1215 acres.     
                                       
 At the south east corner two hides    
 have been built along with a visitor  
 reception centre which welcomed some  
{2000 visitors}in the summer of 1985.  
 The marshes are particularly well     
 suited as a reserve for many reasons. 
 The vegetation suits the needs of     
 birdlife; the{aquatic vegetation}is   
 very nutritious and{rare plants}such  
 as the least yellow water lily are    
 plentiful.{Birds of prey}are numerous.</content>
