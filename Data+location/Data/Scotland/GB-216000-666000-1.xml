		<title>01SKELMORLIE:RURAL VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  In our 12 square kilometre D-Block 9 
 are occupied by sea but the 3 remain- 
 ing kilometre squares are the site of 
 our village Skelmorlie.               
  Skelmorlie is situated on the Firth  
 of Clyde in the south west of Scot-   
 land. The village is 3km long by 1km  
 deep,the 3km length being parallel to 
 the coast.                            
  The village is divided into 2 parts  
 Upper Skelmorlie and Lower Skelmorlie,
 by a row of cliffs. Lower Skelmorlie  
 consists of 1 long road,Shore Road.   
 Upper Skelmorlie spreads out unseen by
 passers by on the main road.          
  The best view of the village is from 
 a boat out in the Clyde. The village  
 can be seen to be in terraces of red  
 sandstone houses,mainly facing to-    
 wards the sea. Behind the village are 
 woods and behind these moorland rises 
 as far as can be seen.                </content>
