		<title>08DRUMOAK DORIC WORD DATABASE</title>
		<content> In 1985 Drumoak School pupils as part 
 of their education worked on Scottish 
 poetry.They made lists of words which 
 they didn't know,found their meanings,
 then printed the Scots words into a   
 Computer Database. The pupils then    
 made lists of dialect words used by   
 the pupils and parents in everyday    
 communication.The pupils then made    
 another Database Dictionary of local  
 words still used in 1985.             
 Soon afterwards Mr Billy Kay,presenter
 of the BBC Television series Odyssey, 
 visited the school. Mr Kay, Mr Hendry 
 the Headmaster and pupils who had     
 worked on the Databases talked about  
 many of the words in the Databases in 
 an interview for a BBC Radio Programme
 about the use of dialect words in     
 everyday language in modern Scotland.
