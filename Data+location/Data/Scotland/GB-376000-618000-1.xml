		<title>01HOWNAM IN    ROXBURGHSHIRE</title>
		<content> This tiny area of the Scottish Borders
 has the Kale Water running north in   
 the centre, fed by 3 tributary burns, 
 the Beirhope Burn from the  west,the  
 Capehope and Hownam  burns from the   
 east,giving a pattern of hills and    
 vales,with the hamlet of Hownam beside
 the Kale,  between the highest hills, 
 Windy Law and Thowliestane Hill, both 
 over 300 metres.Hownam consists of a  
 Church, Hall, Post Office and only 9  
 houses,but is very much the hub of all
 the local inhabitants. The land is all
 used for farming, with almost equal   
 areas of fenced hill and worked grass 
 land, with very little cropping, only 
 turnips and cabbage for animal winter 
 feeding. Almost the entire permanant  
 population is involved in farming, so 
 most of the following pages are to do 
 with life in a very rural community,  
 it's farms, animals, and passtimes.   </content>
