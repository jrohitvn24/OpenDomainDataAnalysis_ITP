   Situated on the northern shores of  
 the {Firth of Tay}this predominantly  
 residential suburb of{Dundee}enjoys   
 magnificent views over the{River Tay  
{to North Fife.                        
 Originally a fishing village, the     
 expansion of the{City of Dundee}      
 has swallowed up Broughty Ferry       
 although it is very much an           
 identifiable and individual part of   
 the city.                             
  Most of the residents of this area   
 work in{Dundee}and commute by bus or  
 car. Virtually self- supporting with  
 its own shopping centre and necessary 
 amenities, this area is a much sought 
 after residential pocket of{Tayside   
{Region.}                              
 The Tay estuary sees much river       
 traffic to Dundee harbour mainly due  
 to North Sea Oil development.         </content>
