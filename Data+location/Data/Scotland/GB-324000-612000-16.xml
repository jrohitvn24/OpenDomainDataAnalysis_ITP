		<title>16AN ETTRICK FARMER'S WINTER.</title>
		<content>   Ettrick Valley is very cold in      
 Winter and very hot in Summer.In      
 Winter the valley turns white with    
 snow and the snow on the hills        
 drifts.The farmer has to feed the     
 sheep because there is not enough     
 grass for them all and if they don't  
 get enough they can't make milk for   
 the lambs when they are born.As well  
 as the sheep the farmer has to feed   
 the hill cows in the shed for the same
 reason.In March the cows which are    
 going to calf first are put out to    
 grass and get extra feeding.          
   In April the old ewes which were    
 tupped first are brought into the     
 fields to lamb.All the ewes that have 
 twins are moved to get more feeding.If
 the lambing started before April there
 wouldn't be enough food or grass for  
 them all.                             
                                       </content>
