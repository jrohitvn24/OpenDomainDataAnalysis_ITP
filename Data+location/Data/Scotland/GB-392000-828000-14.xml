		<content> Education provision in the Ellon area 
 is of both{primary}and{secondary      
 level. There is one secondary school, 
{Ellon Academy}with{1450 pupils,}which 
 is situated near the centre of the    
 town. There are also two primary      
 schools,{Ellon Primary School}and     
{Meiklemill Primary.}Both have about   
 three hundred to four hundred pupils. 
 On finishing primary education the    
 pupils go to{secondary education}at   
 Ellon Academy. These primaries are    
 only two of the{21}schools which send 
 their pupils to Ellon Academy. There  
 are no further education              
 establishments in this area because   
 population numbers do not justify     
 their existence and Aberdeen 16 miles 
 to the south provides such facilities.
 There is a demand for{Ordinary and    
{Higher grade evening classes.}There   
 are also several{nursery schools.     </content>
