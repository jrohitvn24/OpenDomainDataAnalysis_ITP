		<content>   St Michaels Parish Church is        
 situated just above the old school.   
 All around it is the graveyard. It has
 two doors, one at the front with a    
 path leading from the front gates to  
 the door. There are two glass windows,
 one at the back and one at the front. 
 The minister is called Mr Higham who  
 has just recently begun. There is a   
 bell tower which cannot be reached    
 because the steps have collapsed. It  
 can still be rung by a long rope and  
 rings out every Sunday at 10.15 am.   
   Although the church has many seats  
 not alot of them are full because the 
 numbers have dropped. This means that 
 St Michaels Church has to share a     
 minister and continually has to have  
 coffee evenings and charity evenings  
 to collect more money.
