		<content> Except for the marshy edge of the Eden
 estuary and the few steep slopes which
 are either grass or shrub. The entire 
 area is cultivated farmland .Six large
 farms, each over 150 hectares in size 
 and one small farm cover the area.    
 They are mainly owner-occupied. The   
 small farm and the one large farm are 
 run as dairy farms, while the rest are
 mixed farms with both cash crops and  
 beef cattle fattening. Principal      
 'cash' crops are barley, potatoes and 
 oil seed rape, with the occasional    
 field of peas; while rotation grass,  
 for grazing and silage, and turnips   
 are the main 'fodder' crops. All the  
 farms are highly mechanised; most have
 huge new barns reflecting the changed 
 methods of storing grain, potatoes and
 hay. Silage pits and silos are also   
 common.
