		<title>14A Dairy Farm</title>
		<content>  Gellyhill Farm is a dairy farm.      
 Altogether the farm has got two       
 hundred and seventy British Friesian  
 cows. The cows are milked twice a day,
 at half past four in the morning and  
 at three o'clock in the afternoon.    
 Gellyhill Farm has a milking parlour, 
 which can milk twenty one cows at one 
 time. The milking parlour is different
 to most because it rotates and when   
 one turn is made the cow that has gone
 round once should have finished being 
 milked. When the cow goes onto the    
 machine there is a feeding chute which
 gives it some food to eat as it goes  
 round the turnstile.                  
  The total acreage of Gellyhill Farm  
 is five hundred acres. The owners, one
 family, have several other farms in   
 the Banff area.They own almost 50% of 
 the land in this D-Block.
