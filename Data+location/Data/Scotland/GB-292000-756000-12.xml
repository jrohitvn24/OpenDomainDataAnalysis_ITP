		<content> One of the main ways the local        
 community meet and mix together is by 
 means of sport and social activities  
 linked to the various clubs:football, 
 curling, golf and so on.Perhaps       
 because of the lack of alternative    
 entertainment, the standard achieved, 
 in most sports, despite the small     
 population, is fairly high.           
 The local football team is called the 
 The Vale Of Atholl.The team consists  
 of local workers ranging from school  
 teachers to labourers.The Vale, a long
 established team, was founded in 1880 
 .This year they won the League cup    
 and Perthshire cup.                   
 The team arranges training for the    
 young,therfore ensuring the continuing
 sucess of the club.Paul Sturrock,star 
 of Dundee Utd,started his career with 
 the Vale Of Atholl.
