		<title>08Dumfries Pub Survey</title>
		<content> Many pubs we visited are over a       
 hundred years old. One of them is only
 five years old. The{Riverside} is not 
 old but is popular, especially on     
 Saturdays. They make around Â£1000 on a
 busy day. A pub for the young is      
{Valentino's.}Drink there is a bit     
 dearer than other places. They used to
 make their own beer.                  
    The most historic pub in Dumfries  
 is{The Globe.}It is over three hundred
 years old and it has been owned for   
 seventy years by Stephen Robb. Its    
 drinks are the cheapest in town and   
 its meals are recommended. They cannot
 sell The Globe because it belongs to  
 the{Burns Trust}and has links with the
 famous poet Robert Burns.
