		<content>    THE FARMS AROUND BARRY ARE         
 COTSIDE,GRANGE OF BARRY,RAVENSBY,     
 ,WOODHILL AND PITSKELLY. ALL ARE      
 MENTIONED IN PARISH RECORDS  DATING   
 BACK SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS.THE FARMS  
 ARE ALL MIXED FARMS,GROWING CEREAL    
 CROPS,POTATOES  AND THEY HAVE CATTLE. 
 NO FARM HAS A DAIRY  HERD NOWADAYS.THE
 GREATEST CHANGE IN THE LAST 50 YEARS  
 IS THE AMOUNT OF MACHINERY NOW BEING  
 USED ON FARMS AND THESE HAVE REPLACED 
 MAN POWER,SO THAT FARMS NOW EMPLOY    
 FEWER MEN TO DO THE WORK.POTATOES ARE 
 A POPULAR CROP IN THIS AREA ,WHILE    
 SOME FARMS HAVE INTRODUCED FRUIT CROPS
 SUCH AS RASPBERRIES AND STRAWBERRIES. 
    GRANGE OF BARRY  FARM DATES BACK   
 TO  THE 11TH CENTURY WHEN THE MONKS   
 FROM BALMERINO OWNED THE LANDS.IN THE 
 15TH CENTURY THE WELL WOODED LANDS    
 WERE USED AS HUNTING GROUNDS BY THE   
 KINGS OF SCOTLAND.                    </content>
