		<title>03FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> Most families in West Calder and      
 Polbeth like to live a quiet          
 life.They have three meals a day      
 usually breakfast,lunch and dinner.For
 dinner,which is the main meal and     
 eaten between 5p.m.and 6p.m.,most     
 people would have three courses being 
 soup,meat and vegetables and a sweet. 
 During the week days people go to work
 or school and most people wait until  
 Friday or Saturday to have an evening 
 out during the week they stay at home 
 and watch t.v.or follow a hobby.What  
 people wear depends on the weather.In 
 the Summer they wear light clothes but
 in Winter they wrap up well as it is  
 very cold here at that time of        
 year.The people here are generous and 
 contribute to many charities they are 
 also anilmal lovers and most have     
 pets.                                 
                                       </content>
