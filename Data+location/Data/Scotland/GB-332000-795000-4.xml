		<content> 2. The pinewood community.            
     Beneath the pine trees is a       
 characteristic ground cover           
 which includes blaeberry and          
 heather.  Other plants which are      
 often found include cowberry, wavy    
 hair-grass, chickweed wintergreen,    
 creeping lady's tresses, lesser       
 twayblade, the true wintergreens,     
 twinflowers and many mosses.          
     Roe deer,red squirrels and rabbits
 are common animals in the woods. In   
 winter when food is scarce they cause 
 harm by stripping the bark off young  
 trees. Wild cats and badgers are rarer
 animals that are sometimes seen.      
      Many woodland birds are to be    
 found in the area. The crossbill has a
 beak that is adapted for pulling the  
 scales from cones to get the seeds.By 
 far the most numerous however are     
 chaffinches,coal tits and bullfinches.</content>
