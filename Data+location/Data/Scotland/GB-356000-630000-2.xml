		<title>02Newtown Mart</title>
		<content> Newtown Mart was built in 1871 and is 
 one of two main livestock markets in  
 the Borders. Although now disused,the 
{railway}once ran through Newtown, and 
 as the village is in a fairly central 
 position,transport of livestock to and
 fro was facilitated.                  
     Marts are held twice weekly on    
 Mondays and Thursdays. There are two  
 main types of sales: fat sales where  
 livestock is sold for slaughter or    
 stores sales where animals are sold   
 for further rearing.Farmers,butchers  
 and members of the public come from   
 all round the Borders to sell or buy  
 livestock, or just to have a look.    
     Pigs are sold in a small ring     
 while sheep and cattle are sold in two
 large rings.Poultry is sold in a small
 shed near the pig ring.
