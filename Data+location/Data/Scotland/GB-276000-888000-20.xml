		<content> Dornoch was still the commercial and  
 business centre of the area in 1953.  
 There were 30 shops and 6 hotels. The 
 population in the burgh was 788. Now  
 it is around 900. Agriculture employed
 many people and there was hardly any  
 unemployment. The town council led by 
 the Provest looked after Dornoch's    
 affairs. Some older people still spoke
 Gaelic. Most people were church goers.
 Dornoch Academy was a primary and 6   
 year secondary school, with a roll of 
 300 pupils. These were local pupils   
 and boarders from the North and West. 
 Now the school is a two year secondary
 with 240 pupis. The coronation was    
 celebrated by sport in meadows Park.  
 Each child received a New Testament,  
 coronation mug and a pencil. Not so   
 many people had cars. Dornoch station 
 was still open and on this branch line
 were 2 trains daily to the Mound.     </content>
