		<title>10RECREATION OPERA DANCE</title>
		<content> The St.Patrick's Opera Group          
 produces an annual light opera, well  
 performed.                            
 The last three productions have been: 
  Die Fledermaus,The Yoemen of the     
 Guard,and The Merry Widow.            
 There have always been a number of    
 good choirs and choral societies.     
 In the past they have on occasion     
 combined to form a mass choir,as      
 during the Festival of Britain(1952). 
  The Minstrels is a male singing group
 much in demand for entertainments and 
 with a wide reputation.               
  Scottish and Irish dancing are still 
 well practised,and prizes are won.    
  Theatre is popular and has received a
 boost in the form of the Henderson    
 Theatre which has been recently       
 constructed in the Dykehead Community 
 Centre,situated in an old school.
