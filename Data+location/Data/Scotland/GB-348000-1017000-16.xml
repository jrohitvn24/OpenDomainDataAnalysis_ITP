		<title>16THE MILLDAM</title>
		<content> The{Mill}was built in{1883}and was    
 powered by water from the{Milldam}.The
 dam was worked by a screw which was   
 turned{anticlockwise}to open and      
{clockwise}to close.The Mill was       
 working from October to May and was   
 the island Mill.The folk came anytime 
 anyday with oats and corn to be       
 milled.                               
 The dam was full for working in winter
 and drained in summer for{peat        
 cutting.It was not good peat which was
 cut.One man tried to measure how much 
 moss there was and got down more than 
{20 feet of solid moss.                
 The mill shut down because folk       
 started feeding the oats to the hens. 
 Shapinsay sent eggs all over Scotland.
 The Mill Wheel is iron and the biggest
 in Orkney.It is in very good          
 condition.
