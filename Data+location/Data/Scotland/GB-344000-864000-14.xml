		<title>14PETER FAIR OR RATHVEN MARKET</title>
		<content>      THERE IS A ROAD CALLED THE SMIDDY
 IN RATHVEN.  IT TAKES YOU UP TO THE   
 MARCH ROAD.  IF YOU GO UP THE MARCH   
 ROAD ON THE 3RD THURSDAY OR FRIDAY OF 
 JULY, YOU START TO SEE LIGHTS AND YOU 
 START TO HEAR MUSIC.  AS YOU GO OVER  
 THE HILL, THERE IT IS - PETER FAIR!   
      USUALLY I GO WITH MY GRANNY AND  
 GRANDAD BECAUSE I GET "HEAPS" OF MONEY
 WHEN I GO WITH THEM.  THERE'S DODGEMS 
 AND SHOOTING, KNOCKING DOWN COCONUTS  
 AND CANS, THE TWISTER AND THE HELTER  
 SKELTER AS WELL.  I ALWAYS GO TO THE  
 WALTZERS FIRST.  I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT 
 IS FAST.  I LIKE THE TWISTER AS WELL  
 BUT YOU HAVE TO HANG ON VERY TIGHT.  I
 ALWAYS FEEL A LITTLE SICK AFTER THE   
 TWISTER BUT VERY HAPPY.  SOMETIMES WE 
 LIKE TO GO TO ONE OF THE MANY ARCADES.
 WE LIKE A SHOT OF EVERYTHING BEFORE WE
 GO AND WHEN WE LEAVE WE ALWAYS BUY A  
 SOUVENIR.                             </content>
