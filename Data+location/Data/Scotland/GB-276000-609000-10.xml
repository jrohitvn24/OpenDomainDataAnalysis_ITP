		<title>10Leisure time around Sanquhar</title>
		<content> For a town of its size Sanquhar has a 
 great number of leisure facilities for
 all ages. For children, there are the 
 usual organisations- Brownies and Girl
 Guides, Boys' Brigade and Youth Clubs.
 There are many other bodies which are 
 keen to allow children to join and to 
 make use of their facilities. The town
 has a Golf Club, Bowling Green, an    
 athletics club and a curling club, and
 they encourage youths to participate. 
 Other societies deal with karate,     
 fishing, badminton and football. For  
 the less energetic, there are clubs   
 for public-speaking, wine-making,     
 crook-making, fly-tying, keep fit and 
 yoga. There are clubs which are run by
 the churches for their congregations  
 and a few self-help organisations.    
 Other societies include the local     
 Silver Band and Horticultural Society.
 All these clubs are going concerns.   </content>
