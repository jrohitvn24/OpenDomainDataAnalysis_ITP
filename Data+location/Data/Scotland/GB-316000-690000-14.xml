 school the nursery contains children  
 of mixed religions.  The third primary
 school is Cowdenbeath Primary.        
 Although it has no nursery it is, with
 352 pupils divided into 13 classes,   
 the largest of the 3.  The school will
 accept both physically and mentally   
 handicapped children, but if it is    
 seen that no progress is made they    
 will be moved to special facilities   
 elsewhere.                            
   The only secondary school in the    
 area is Beath High School.  It takes  
 first and second year pupils before   
 they move to the senior building.     
 There are 720 pupils in 24 classes -  
 12 first year and 12 second year      
 classes. All the classes are mixed    
 ability. All the schools use computers
 and feel that it is a great help/
