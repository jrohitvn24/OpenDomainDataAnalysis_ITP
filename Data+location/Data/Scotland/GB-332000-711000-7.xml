 by children.{Rounders}is a game of    
 batting a ball and running. Two teams 
 play this game,one batting and one    
 fielding. A bat and ball and four     
 bases placed in a square are needed.  
 The bowler bowls the ball to the      
 batsman who hits it with the bat and  
 then runs round the 4 bases,while the 
 fielding team tries to touch a base   
 with the ball before the batsman      
 arrives there.{White Horse}is a game  
 where people stand like statues. One  
 person turns his back on the others   
 who try to creep up behind him. When  
 this person turns round the others    
 must stand like statues. The object of
 the game is to reach safety and shout 
 "White Horse" without being caught    
 moving.
