		<content> Most of the houses in our survey area 
 are made of stone. This is because    
 they are quite old, about a hundred   
 years approximately.                  
 Ochiltree Castle is the oldest        
 building, it has one part that was    
 built in 1540. This makes it four     
 hundred and forty_five years old.     
 There have been additions to it since 
 then.                                 
 There are, however, some modern houses
 scattered over the countryside. Some  
 of these are very modern bungalows    
 that are attached to the farms,       
 possibly for married sons or          
 daughters, other houses were built    
 about fifty years ago for the         
 water-board employees. These houses   
 are not particularly attractive.      
 In some places there have been stone  
 cottages, now derelict.
