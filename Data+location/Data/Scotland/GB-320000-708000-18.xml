		<title>18A Night Out in Strathmiglo</title>
		<content> Situated on the High Street are from  
 east to west,the Royal Hotel,The      
 Strathmiglo Inn and The Tavern. Though
 there is practically no through       
 traffic on the High Street nowadays,  
 it was originally the old Dunfermline 
 /Perth Road. The Strathmiglo Inn,     
 which dates back to 1710,became a     
 Coaching inn, much frequented by      
 travellers as well as local people. It
 may also have been used by residents  
 of and visitors to Falkland Palace.   
 Nowadays,it is also much frequented by
 travellers, especially business men,  
 because it is within easy travelling  
 distance of such places as St.        
 Andrews,Perth,Dundee and Edinburgh,   
 and has a reputation for a high       
 standard of cuisine. The present      
 owners plan to restore the Inn, with  
 changes to both the inside and        
 outside.                              </content>
