		<title>11LYLE AND SCOTT</title>
		<content>   Lyle and Scott's factory in Jedburgh
 was opened in 1956.It is a two-storey 
 building in Bongate,next to Garage    
 premises.They make Intarsia fronts for
 jerseys and jumpers mainly using      
 cashmere wool.This is done by hand on 
 machines by men.The backs and sleeves 
 come from Hawick,and at Jedburgh the  
 women do the collar-linking,binding   
 and hand-sewing.The finished products 
 goback to Hawick for washing and      
 dispatch to Japan,U.S.A.,W.Germany and
 elsewhere.                            
   The designing of the jerseys is done
 in Hawick,and they cost Â£100 to make, 
 but in the shops they will cost nearly
 Â£200.                                 
   There are other factories in Hawick 
 and Kelso employing about 600         
 altogether,with around 60 employed in 
 Jedburgh.
