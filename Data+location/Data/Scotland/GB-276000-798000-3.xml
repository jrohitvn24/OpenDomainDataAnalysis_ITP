		<title>03RUTHVEN BARRACKS - 2</title>
		<content> This site was a popular one for       
{castles}as far back as the thirteenth 
 century although the Barracks as we   
 see them today were built in 1715     
 amidst{Jacobite Risings.} Soldiers    
 were stationed there to patrol Wade's 
 roads and keep the Highlanders in     
 order.                                
                                       
 In recent years{restoration}work has  
 gone on making the building much safer
 for visitors. In 1985 a{well}has been 
 uncovered in the courtyard.           
                                       
{Barbeques and folk singing}nights have
 been held here in recent years.  A{son
{et lumiere}was tried by a local trades
 association but the squally night     
 spoiled the fun for participants and  
 audience alike.
