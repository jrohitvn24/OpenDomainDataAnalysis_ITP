		<content>   Many people come to visit Stirling  
 because of the shopping centre, sports
 and leisure facilites and the tourist 
 attractions such as the castle, the   
 Guildhall, the Holy Rude Church and   
 many other historical buildings which 
 have a very exciting past and are very
 interesting to look at. People come to
 live in Stirling because it is smaller
 and friendlier than larger towns and  
 cities.                               
   We interviewed 100 children in our  
 school and we found that 53 of them   
 were born in Stirling, but 68 of the  
 parents are newcomers to Stirling.    
 Only 45% of the fathers work in       
 Stirling but 55% work in Glasgow or   
 Edinburgh or outside Stirling. They   
 chose to live here because of the easy
 communications with other towns and   
 cities by motorway, train and bus     
 services.                             </content>
