		<content> Houses in the area of Ancaster Road   
 were built from the beginning of the  
 century.                              
 At the west of the town are some large
{Victorian villas.}In Victorian days   
 rich people would come from the cities
 to renew their health,staying in these
 villas for the summer.                
 Nearby at Tulipan,an estate of{timber 
{framed houses}has been built.         
 Leaving Callander going west to       
 Kilmahog there is a cluster of older  
 houses,each standing in its own       
 ground.These are over 200 years old.  
 Most of the houses in this area are   
 owener occupied.
