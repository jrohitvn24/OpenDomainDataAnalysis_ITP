		<title>05EMPLOYMENT - ETTRICK VALLEY</title>
		<content>      Surprisingly this area has  its  
 fair share of employment for the type 
 of area it is.  Farming is the        
 mainstay and there is an old Inn      
 which employs local people. A caravan 
 site and camping area offers          
 employment for one family - another   
 runs a pottery business.  One area has
 been cultivated for the growth and    
 sale of dried flowers and nearby is a 
 pony trekking establishment. While one
 enterprising family keeps bees and    
 sells honey, two local houses have bed
 and breakfast facilities and there is 
 a small tearoom attached to one of    
 them.                                 
    Others in the area travel to towns 
 for their employment.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
