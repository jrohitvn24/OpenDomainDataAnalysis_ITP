		<title>11EMPLOYMENT IN THE RHU AREA.</title>
		<content> As we live in a residential district, 
 there is limited opportunity for      
 employment within the immediate area, 
 however, from our local survey we     
 found that,despite this,there is a    
 high level of employment amongst the  
 residents.About 42% of the full_time  
 working population have jobs either in
 or related to the Faslane Naval Base, 
 35% travel to the Glasgow area whilst 
 23% find work in the community.Most of
 these jobs are to be found within     
 local authority establishments e.g. in
 St.Andrew's Residential School,Rhu    
 Primary School,Blairvadach Children's 
 Home and the Outdoor Centre.Other     
 sources of employment are in providing
 services for the local residents e.g. 
 in hotels,shops,small building firms  
 and sailing clubs.Many of the private 
 homes offer part_time domestic and    
 gardening jobs for local residents.   </content>
