		<content>{Preservation Order on Hallgreen Trees}
 Inverbervie Community Council have    
 been concerned about so many trees    
 being cut down because of new houses. 
 To prevent this, a tree preservation  
 order has been placed on all the trees
 in the Hallgreen Estate.              
 The district's Director of Planning   
 has been receiving letters from people
 who stay on the Betts' estate who are 
 worried about the trees around their  
 homes.                                
{Survey Backs Small Pool}              
 A recent survey in Bervie has         
 indicated that the public would like  
 to have a swimming pool. However there
 are snags. The area wanted for the    
 pool is part of the school grounds.   
 This might be needed for a further    
 extension to the school.
