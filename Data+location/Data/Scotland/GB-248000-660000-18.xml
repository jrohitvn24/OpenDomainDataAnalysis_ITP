		<content> On this page is explained the origins 
 of place names in Paisley and Glasgow 
 and what these areas are like now.    
{HAWKHEAD}the origin of this name is   
 not clear. Hawk used to be written    
 "Halk" which is an Anglo-Saxon word   
 meaning "corner"or "recess".Head means
 the end. The problem is where is the  
 corner or recess? Hawkhead is now an  
 area of private housing,a busy road,  
 and some Industry.It used to be the   
 residence of the Barons of Ross. {    
{NITSHILL }was originally              
 named "Nuttishill" as there was once a
 hazelnut grove there.It is now a large
 busy council housing estate on the    
 outskirts of Glasgow with a number of 
 shops and a railway station.          
{CHAPELHILL}derives its name from the  
 church that once stood in Blackhall.It
 is now an area of council housing with
 a large park.                         </content>
