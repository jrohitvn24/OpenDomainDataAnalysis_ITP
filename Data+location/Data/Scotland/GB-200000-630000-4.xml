		<content>    Lamlash,as a frequented village by 
 tourists inevitably has a large beach 
 which attracts tourists for leisure   
 and wildlife pursuits.At low tide the 
 beach reaches a length of 2km. from   
 North to South.                       
    There are two main rivers which    
 carry deposits down to the beach.These
 can stain the beach a muddy brown     
 colour especially after high rainfall 
 due to them eroding large amounts of  
 soil as they pass through the forestry
 and farming zones.                    
    Lamlash beach is mainly used as an 
 area for mooring and recreational     
 pursuits.Due to the sewage outflow it 
 is not as popular an area for swimming
 as other beaches around the island.In 
 some parts of the beach there are long
 Basalt dykes which are easily seen as 
 long black strips of rock on the      
 beach.                                </content>
