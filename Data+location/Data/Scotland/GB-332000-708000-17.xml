		<title>17Life as a schoolboy in 1910</title>
		<content>{Mr. John Garland}is a resident of     
 long_standing in the village of       
 Pitlessie,an octogenarian who         
 remembers,as though it was yesterday  
 life as a boy in Pitlessie in 1910.   
  Life at school then was somewhat     
 different from today.Classroom lessons
 were done on school slates although   
 each year the inspectors came and the 
 annual exam would be done on paper.   
 The boys used to play football on the 
 rough road outside the school,safe    
 enough in the days of no traffic.     
 Mr.Garland remembers that they did a  
 lot of gardening in the afternoons at 
 school. In the evening homework had to
 be done,followed by more football,tig 
 or hide-and-seek in the park.         
 Mr.Garland's vivid and lively         
 reminiscences brought to life         
 Pitlessie boyhood nearly a century    
 ago.                                  </content>
