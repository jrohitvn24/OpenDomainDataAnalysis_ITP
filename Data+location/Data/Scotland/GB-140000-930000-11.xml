		<title>11STORNOWAY S. LOCAL RADIO</title>
		<content> Radio Nan Eilean was started by the   
 BBC in October 1979 mainly because    
 they thought that the area to be      
 covered by Radio Nan Eilean (The      
 Western Isles,Skye and the West coast 
 mainland from Kinlochbervie in the    
 north to Kyle of Lochalsh in the      
 south) deserved more local programmes 
 especially in Gaelic. A lot of people 
 listen to the programmes. An audience 
 survey done some time ago showed an   
 audience figure of 86%, one of the    
 highest figures of any radio station  
 in the United Kingdom. People listen  
 most during the winter when there is  
 less work to do out of doors. The     
 staff at Radio Nan Eilean is 1 senior 
 producer, 1 General producer, 1 young 
 peoples programme producer, 2         
 secretaries and 1 part time cleaner.{
