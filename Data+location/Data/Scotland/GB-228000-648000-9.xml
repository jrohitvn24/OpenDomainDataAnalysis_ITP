		<title>09RECREATION IN DALRY</title>
		<content> There is not much entertainment in    
 Dalry.  The latest craze is BMX bikes 
 and there is a track in the park.  It 
 also has a tennis court, boating pond,
 and putting and bowling greens.       
 Children can bowl on Saturday morning.
 We have no swimming pool or cinema,   
 although there used to be two cinemas.
 The Community Centre runs a bus to    
 Kilbirnie swimmimg pool on Wednesdays 
 and runs regular discos.  There are   
 many clubs, like Girl Guides, Scouts, 
 Karate, Judo, Computing, Girls' and   
 Boys' Brigades etc.                   
 For adults there are pubs, bowling,   
 bingo on Tuesdays, a centre for senior
 citizens, and at the Community Centre,
 clubs like sewing, keep-fit and drama.
 Most people stay at home watching T.V.
 but there is quite a lot to do if they
 just look for it.I hope the Government
 will pay for better facilities.       </content>
