 Some people like having pets in their 
 house some don't.                     
                                       
 These are some of the pets in our area
 cats, horses, dogs, budgies, rabbits  
 and guinea pigs.                      
                                       
 When my Mum last had a dog he chewed  
 the table and chairs and they are     
 falling to pieces we have not had a   
 dog since.                            
                                       
 The people in our school own 10       
 cats, 5 dogs,1 budgie,4 rabbits,66    
 ducks, 2 geese and about 29 hens.     
                                       
 In the country having dogs is a good  
 idea but you can't let them roam free 
 because of the sheep.{DO NOT}let your 
 dog bother sheep.
