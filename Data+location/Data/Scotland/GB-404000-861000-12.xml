		<title>12North East Farming</title>
		<content> The North East Farming Industry is    
 a very competitive industry.There is a
{Mart}every Wednesday where sheep and  
 cattle are auctioned.Farmers from     
 inside and outside our area go there  
 to show off their prize cattle and buy
 some extra cattle.The cattle mostly go
 to a place called the{North Eastern   
{Farmers,}which owns a slaughter house 
 and there they  would receive a cheque
 for the amount they have sold.It is   
 not always the richest who produce the
 best meat.For those  who have farming 
 fathers there is a club called The    
{Young Farmers.}Pig farming is quite   
 common in the{N.E.}In our block there 
 is a pig farm owned by a Mr E Deltesta
 who has about{1500}pigs,including     
 pregnant sows.The North  East of      
 Scotland is mainly farmland.
