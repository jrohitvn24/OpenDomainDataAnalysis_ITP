		<content>    People in central Ettrick have     
 learned to be self sufficient.        
 Housewives are excellent bakers and   
 many public functions bear witness to 
 that with home made teas and suppers. 
 Men can turn their hands to most      
 things and many jobs around the farm  
 are done by farmer and farm workers   
 from machinery repairs to dyking and  
 draining.                             
    Entertainment is often home made,  
 Winter being the season for home      
 visiting.   Pleasures cost little yet 
 are every bit as enjoyable  as any    
 professional entertainments. During   
 the Winter months households have to  
 be well stocked and the womenfolk are 
 thrifty and adaptable and well able to
 cope with difficult weather           
 conditions.
