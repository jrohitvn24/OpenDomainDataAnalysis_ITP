		<title>20THE TOWER, MILLERSTON</title>
		<content>{  The Tower}was built in the late 19th
 century and is a two-storey and attic 
 Baronial-style tower house.  It is a  
 category C{Listed Building.} When     
 first built it was surrounded by farm 
 land but gradually this land was used 
 more and more by the local scrap metal
 yard.  The last occupants left in 1975
 and since then it has remained vacant.
 Vandals have broken the windows and   
 two alsation dogs keep further vandals
 at bay.                               
   On both the first floor and         
 attic there are two rooms, one tiny   
 one just over{six feet square,}and a  
 large room with a fire place.  Today  
 we find it hard to believe that people
 could live in such cramped quarters.  
 Our modern houses are a great         
 improvement, even if we do sometimes  
 think the rooms of some mass-produced 
 houses are too small.                 </content>
