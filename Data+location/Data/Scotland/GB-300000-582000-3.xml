		<title>03FARM LIFE AT BRUNTSHIELDS</title>
		<content>      Bruntshields Farm is mainly a    
 dairy farm. It has been in the        
 Shuttleworth family for thirty three  
 years. It is rented from Colonel      
 Charteris and covers two hundred      
 acres. The farm consists of one       
 hundred and five dairy cattle         
 (Fresian), fifty Fresian dairy        
 followers (these are calves which will
 become dairy cattle) and seventy beef 
 cattle. These are a mixture of Angus  
 and Limousin cross Fresians. The milk 
 tanker comes daily and collects, on   
 average, 1400 litres of milk. For     
 feeding, the cattle have grass during 
 the summer and silage (home produced) 
 plus cake and concentrates in the     
 winter.                               
      Bruntshields also has sheep - one
 hundred and twenty ewes, one hundred  
 and eighty lambs and three tips.
