		<content> TRADITIONAL                           
 Shetland has always been a fishing    
 centre.In the past men were involved  
 in the Herring fleet and the Whaling  
 industry.Many young men go to the     
 Fishing nowadays.They travel out of   
 our area to join the trawlers in      
 Burra,Whalsay and Lerwick.            
 SALMON CAGES AND MUSSEL RAFTS         
 There are now new forms of fishing in 
 the islands.Some people in our block  
 have got involved in farming Salmon   
 and Mussels.For mussels you position a
 raft in the voe,from this raft cables 
 hang down into the water.The mussels  
 grow on the cables.Salmon cages are   
 made of plastic.Most of them come from
 Norway.The salmon have to be fed 4    
 times a day with special food.The food
 turns the salmon red or pink.
