		<title>11Games we play in our area</title>
		<content> We take part in many sports in this   
 area but by far the most popular is   
 football.Both of the Primary Schools  
 have football teams and both villages 
 have a senior amateur team who play in
 the Ross_Shire Amateur League.There is
 also a team called Maycon ,which is   
 made up of boys under sixteen years   
 from both villages.There are even two 
 teams made up from the patrons of the 
 two local public houses,the Drouthy   
 Duck and the Cottage Bar.Badminton is 
 the most popular of the indoor sports 
 with indoor bowling growing in        
 popularity as well.At school girls    
 play Hockey and Netball while the boys
 play Shinty and Rounders.Shinty is the
 game of the Scottish Highlands.In some
 ways it is like hockey,but the field  
 is much longer and the clubs or       
 "camans" being triangular rather      
 then flat_faced.                      </content>
