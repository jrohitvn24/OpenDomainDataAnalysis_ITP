		<title>04GREENOCK CONTAINER TERMINAL</title>
		<content> THE CONTAINER TERMINAL IS SITUATED AT 
 PRINCES PIER. IT IS DIRECTLY ACROSS   
 THE RIVER CLYDE FROM HELENSBURGH. IT  
 IS A PLACE WHERE CONTAINER SHIPS COME 
 AND UNLOAD THEIR GOODS. BOATS COME    
 FROM COUNTRIES SUCH AS GERMANY, RUSSIA
 AND GREECE. NOT SO MANY SHIPS COME TO 
 THE CONTAINER TERMINAL AS BEFORE AND  
 THERE IS EVEN TALK OF CLOSING IT DOWN.
 THERE ARE LARGE STRADDLE CARRIERS THAT
 TAKE THE CONTAINERS FROM ONE PART OF  
 THE TERMINAL TO ANOTHER. LORRIES ARE  
 OFTEN SEEN LEAVING THE CONTAINER      
 TERMINAL TAKING LOADS TO FIRMS IN     
 GREENOCK AND OTHER TOWNS. SOMETIMES   
 PART OF THE TERMINAL IS PACKED WITH   
 CONTAINERS, AND THEN NEXT DAY IT IS   
 ALMOST EMPTY ONCE A SHIP HAS BEEN     
 LOADED.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
