		<title>06Adult Activities in Balmullo</title>
		<content> There are not many organised          
 activities for teenagers in the       
 village and so most of them visit     
 friends' houses and occasionally go to
 Cupar, Dundee or St. Andrews for      
 entertainment.                        
                                       
 For the adults in the village there is
 The Balmullo Inn, the Bowling Club,   
 the Burns Club, the W.R.I. and the    
 Senior Citizens Club.   This last club
 meets in our school each Thursday     
 afternoon for cards, dominoes, carpet 
 bowls and a chat over a cup of tea.   
 Popular hobbies among the adults are  
 sport, T.V., D.I.Y., crafts and       
 reading.   People accept that a wide  
 variety of entertainment/leisure      
 activities is not possibe in a village
 of this size, and so they are prepared
 to travel to nearby towns or cities   
 to use their facilities.              </content>
