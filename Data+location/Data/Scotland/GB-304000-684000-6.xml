		<title>06CROSSFORD VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Crossford is a rapidly expanding      
 dormitory settlement just 2 miles to  
 the west of Dunfermline on the main   
 Dunfermline to Kincardine Bridge Road.
 Growth has been rapid in the last 20  
 years, the population increasing by   
 more than 3 times as new housing      
 estates have been built. Being so near
 to Dunfermline, the village has less  
 facilities than might be expected for 
 a place of its size, but community    
 feeling is still quite strong, and the
 village Gala, held each June, together
 with a village newsletter (see page   
 12) help to promote this feeling.     
    Few of the residents work in the   
 village itself, the only sources of   
 employment being in the few small     
 shops,(a post office, general store,  
 cafe, butchers, hairdressers and      
 antique shop) the two 3 star hotels,  
 the school, or on surrounding farms.  </content>
