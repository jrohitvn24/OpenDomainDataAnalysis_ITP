		<title>14THE ELDERLY</title>
		<content> Thornhill's population includes 10%   
 over the age of 70.This is made up of 
 people who have always lived locally  
 and of others who have decided to     
 retire here because of the pleasant   
 rural surroundings;the reasonable     
 services and ease of getting to other 
 larger towns.                         
   Most of the incoming retired people 
 have bought bungalows in one of the 4 
 new, private housing developments.    
   Many of the retired locals still    
 stay in their own properties whilst   
 others are looked after by their      
 children or, find shelter in one of   
 the two old peoples' homes in         
 Thornhill.                            
   In May 1985 a sheltered housing     
 scheme was opened on the outskirts of 
 Thornhill with 26 self-contained, one 
 storeyed houses and a warden's house.
