		<content> The bell rings again at 1.30 and we do
 more work until 3.30 when school ends.
 When we get hame we usually play in   
 our gang huts or watch television     
 until supper. In the warmer weather we
 play out again after supper, but in   
 the winter we stay near the fire and  
 watch T.V. or read or play games.     
                                       
 We are three children in a group from 
 Newhall Primary School. We all live in
 different clusters of houses which    
 were originally built for special     
 workers e.g. foresters. We all get up 
 about 8.00am. to catch the mini bus   
 which will take us to school. When we 
 get to school we will have a short    
 time to play before the bell rings to 
 start school. There are eleven people 
 in primary 6 including us.
