 at about 8am!The breakfast bell goes  
 at 8.05 so everyone makes their way to
 the dining room.Breakfast ends at     
 about 8.30 then we have till 9 to make
 our beds,pack our school bags and tidy
 up.Classes are from 9.10 to 4.10 with 
 a break for lunch 12.25pm to 1.10pm.At

 what we like;chat to friends,watch TV,

 more free time in the evening.Our days
