		<title>10HARVESTING CHANGES</title>
		<content> The biggest change which people have  
 noticed since 1945 has been increasing
 mechanisation and reduced numbers of  
 farm labourers. Until the end of the  
 last war teams of men were employed   
 for the harvest. Everyone available   
 including wives had to help with      
 stacking{STOOKS.}It once took a       
 fortnight to harvest a field. Now,    
 with{COMBINE HARVESTERS}it only takes 
 a day.                                
 During the war horses were replaced by
 tractors. This saved time on the farm 
 because horses needed a two-hour rest.
 Now only an hour's break is needed.   
 Farmers' wives had to take 'pieces'   
 (sandwiches) to men who were          
 harvesting and provide meals for large
 numbers especially when the threshing 
 mill came. Today she only has to cook 
 for her own family.
