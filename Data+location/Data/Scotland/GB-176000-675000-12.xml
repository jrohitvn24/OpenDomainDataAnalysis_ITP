		<title>12Horticulture:Heather Nursery</title>
		<content> Achahoish Heather Nursery is situated 
 in Achahoish at the junction of the   
 private road to Ellary.               
 The nursery is run by the             
 owner/manager who has at time of      
 writing (June 1985) 6 adults and 2    
 girls under his direction (all living 
 locally). There are 75 varieties of   
 heather grown. Stock plants are kept, 
 and approx. 100 cuttings are taken and
 potted from each stock plant. The     
 heathers are potted in equal          
 quantities of peat and grit and are   
 housed in plastic tunnels. There are  
 approx. 25,000 heathers in each tunnel
 and there are 18 tunnels on the site  
 ,watered from a central pumped water  
 supply. The heathers are sold to the  
 trade at 20p each, though they can be 
 bought in local shops at approx. 70p  
 each.
