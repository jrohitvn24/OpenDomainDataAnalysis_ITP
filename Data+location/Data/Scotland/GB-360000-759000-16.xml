		<title>16Kings Cinema Sold</title>
		<content> The Kings Cinema in Brechin High      
 Street has been bought by two young   
 Brechin Businessmen who are expanding 
 their Interests.                      
   Mr Stuart Aitkenhead and Mr Michael 
 Swilinski who already own the Angus   
 Steakhouse, the Nova Lounge and the   
 East End Bar,take over on June 14.    
   They will continue to operate the   
 premises as a Cinema and Bingo Hall   
 with attached Launderette             
   Considerable improvements are       
 planned.Fears,both public and private 
 that Angus would lose one of its few  
 remaining Cinemas have therefore been 
 squashed.
