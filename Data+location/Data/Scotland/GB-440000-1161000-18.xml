 are over nine years of age are offered
 cycling proficiency at the Voe School.
 Two police constables from the Brae   
 station give the chilren weekly       
 lessons for six weeks.The children    
 bring their bicycles up to school for 
 the lessons and are taught how to     
 control them properly on the road.    
 Practise is given in stopping your    
 bicycle and taking right and left     
 turns.                                
 Road safety is also discussed and the 
 Highway Code must be learned.         
 After the six lessons each child is   
 given a practical cycling test        
 followed by an oral test on the       
 Highway Code.A police sergeant comes  
 along to give the test.               
 Those who pass are given a certificate
 and a badge.                          </content>
