 With the drop in school rolls some of 
 these schools have extra space now.   
 Others (e.g. Lasswade Primary) which  
 is in a very popular catchment area,  
 have the problem of overcrowding.     
 Parents have the right to send their  
 children to the school of their       
 choice. The primary school{curriculum 
 is divided into these main areas,     
{Language, Mathematics, Enviromental   
{Studies, Expressive Arts, and Social, 
{Moral and Religious Education.}Pupils 
 are encouraged to learn through       
 activity and discovery methods.       
 There is ample provision for the under
 fives in {nursery schools}and         
{playgroups,}so that the very young    
 child, whose parents so desire, may   
 have the benefit of the stimulatory   
 environment which these places        
 provide.                              </content>
