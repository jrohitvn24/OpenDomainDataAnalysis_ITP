		<title>09PRONY HILL FARM:AUT/WINTER</title>
		<content> The hill farm year begins at the end  
 of Oct. The farmer ensures that his   
 ewes are in good health so that many  
 lams will be born.A weak ewe is called
 and eilde.The sheep are dosed with an 
 anthilmintic, which kills worms found 
 in grass.Some shepherds say that a    
 sheep is really a worm in sheeps      
 clothing! The sheep are then put onto 
 fresh pasture. At the start of Nov the
 rams are mated with the ewes.The rest 
 of Nov and Dec the sheep fend for them
 selves and are fed only in bad weather
 At the turn of the year the sheep are 
 dipped to kill lice and keds,parasites
 which feed on flesh.  Afterwards the  
 sheep are fed on low ground and then  
 go to the hill each day.Sheep lick    
 high energy food blocks which are put 
 on the hill.In wintry weather the     
 farmer must clear snow to take feed to
 the sheep and dig them from snowdrifts</content>
