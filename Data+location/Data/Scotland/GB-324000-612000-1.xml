		<title>01ETTRICK VALLEY INTRODUCTION.</title>
		<content>   The centre of Ettrick Valley has    
 high hills on each side of the winding
 river.The hills on the North side are 
 rocky and not good for grazing but on 
 the South side they have good ground  
 and coniferous woods.                 
   The river runs East down the valley 
 and the road runs alongside.The water 
 comes from the hills in burns then    
 into the river.At the point where the 
 Tima Valley joins,the hills become    
 wider apart and wild,deciduous trees  
 grow naturally in the bogs.           
   On either side of the river Tima a  
 tributary to the river Ettrick there  
 are coniferous trees used for timber. 
    In the forests there is a lot of   
 wildlife.Birds come from different    
 lands for the summer.                 
   Most of the buildings are for       
 community uses.30% of the population  
 of the whole valley live here.        </content>
