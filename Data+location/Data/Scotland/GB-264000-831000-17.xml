		<content>{SWIMMING                              
  Swimming is a good sport.I quite like
 swimming there are lots of places you 
 can swim in our area like the river or
 a loch.It is pretty dangerous to swim 
 in lochs around here because the water
 is cold and there are strong currents.
 I can swim without armbands or a ring.
 I can only do two strokes,the breast  
 stroke and the front crawl.           
{HORSE RIDING                          
  I have never been out riding but I   
 have always wanted to very much.I see 
 lots of people riding in this area of 
 ours.A few people keep horses but it  
 is very expensive.                    
{CYCLING                               
  There are lots of people cycling in  
 our area like us biking to school.I   
 often like going on a cycling run.    
 It is real fun going down hills but I 
 dont like going up hills.             </content>
