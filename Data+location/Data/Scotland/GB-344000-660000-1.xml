 INCLUDES SIX FARMS.THE MAIN SETTLEMENT
 IS A SMALL VILLAGE CALLED HUMBIE WHERE
 OUR SCHOOL IS.THERE ARE ABOUT SEVENTY 
 FIVE HOUSES SCATTERED ROUND ABOUT AND 
 A NEIBOURING VILLAGE CALLED FALA WHICH
 IS SLIGHTLY BIGGER.THE SQUARE IS      
 SITUATED ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILES FROM    
 EDINBURGH NEAR THE A68 WHICH IS ONE OF
 THE MAIN ROADS FROM SCOTLAND TO       
 ENGLAND.THE ROADS OFTEN GET BLOCKED   
 WITH SNOW IN THE WINTER AS WE ARE     
 SEVEN HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL.   
 THIS MEANS WE SOMETIMES HAVE TO MISS  
 SCHOOL.IN 1983/4 WE WERE BLOCKED IN   
 FOR NEARLY A FORTNIGHT.               
 OUR SQUARE IS IN THE EAST LOTHIAN     
 DISTRICT OF LOTHIAN REGION.THIS WAS A 
 COUNTY WITH HADDINGTON AS THE MAIN    
 TOWN UNTIL REGIONALISATION IN 1975.
