		<title>19MAY DAY HOLIDAY IN KINNEFF</title>
		<content> I got up at 8.30a.m. My mum got up at 
 6.30a.m. so that she could open up the
 Little Chef Cafe where she works.     
  I played on my computer from 9a.m. to
 10a.m. Then my dad, my sister and I   
 went down to{Dunnottar Castle}for an  
 hour. After that we went home for our 
 lunch. Then we went to a{museum in    
{Glenesk.}My friend came with us. When 
 we reached the museum it was closed   
 so we went to Edzell for refreshments.
 We set off again in my dad's car. We  
 then went for a walk for 2 miles.     
 After that we went back to the car and
 drove home. We arrived  at 6.00p.m.   
 and had our tea. When we finished our 
 tea my mum came home. I went to bed at
 10.15p.m. after watching a film on    
 T.V.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
