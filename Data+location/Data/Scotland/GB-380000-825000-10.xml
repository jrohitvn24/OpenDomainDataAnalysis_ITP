		<title>10Oldmeldrum social life</title>
		<content> For a town the size of Oldmeldrum (pop
 1580, with approx 645 in the adjoining
 parishes of Meldrum and Bourtie),     
 there is a well-organized social life.
 All ages are catered for and only one 
 group, the Garioch Community Centre   
 Kindergym, is of local government     
 origin.  For the elderly there are the
 Evergreens, the British Legion local  
 branch, and the Church of Scotland    
 Women's Guild.  There are other church
 groups as well as local branches of   
 the Red Cross WRVS the SWRI (Scottish 
 Women's Rural Institute) and the      
 Bridge Club. Scouts, Cubs and two     
 Brownie packs cater for the young.    
 Intellectual stimulus is provided by  
 the Social Studies Group, the Literary
 Club and the Housewives' Register. As 
 well as educating and entertaining,   
 these clubs provide friendly venues   
 for local people.                     </content>
