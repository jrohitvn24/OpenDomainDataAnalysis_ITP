		<title>18EFFECTS OF THE MOTORWAY</title>
		<content> Since the building of the M8 motorway,
 taking through-traffic away from      
 Paisley town centre traffic congestion
 has been reduced.  The building of    
 the motorway meant that the road links
 with the rest of the country were much
 better and this encouraged businesses 
 to be set e.g. Hillington Industrial  
 Estate built next to the motorway.    
                                       
 To a lesser extent the small estate   
 including B&amp;Q and Bridges needs to    
 be next to the motorway so that cust- 
 omers can locate them.  It is also an 
 important road for Glasgow Airport.   
                                       
 This has meant that Paisley has a     
 relatively small amount of through-   
 traffic making the shopping streets   
 safer and putting less pressure on    
 narrow roads. It has possibly meant a 
 slump in passing trade for the centre.</content>
