		<title>03GLENLIVET RECEPTION CENTRE</title>
		<content> Whilst waiting for guided tours  round
 the  distillery,  tourists  visit  the
 shop  and  reception centre  which was
 opened  in  1978. The  building itself
 was  the  redundant  malting shed, and
 implements used can be  seen alongside
 cooper's tools,  old  photographs  and
 documents.  The  polished wooden floor
 reflects  copper  jugs,  brass  spirit
 safes and a  small  fire  engine.  The
 Landseer  painting   'Highland  Whisky
 Still' is recreated  as  a  life  size
 tableau  with genuine illicit  stills,
 highland  dress,  stuffed deer, grouse
 and dogs. In complete  contrast  is  a
 video showing the making and marketing
 of The Glenlivet Whisky.  At  the  bar
 visitors receive a tot of whisky. From
 May to October  14 people are employed
 to guide  approximately fifty thousand
 visitors through the distillery.
