 Olnafirth Primary School serves the   
 district of Voe. It was opened in     
 April 1961. The main building consists
 of two classrooms,a general purposes  
 room,toilet facilities,staffroom and  
 kitchen.In December 1983 a temporary  
 wooden classroom was erected due to an
 increase in the school roll.This was  
 caused by oil-related families moving 
 into the district.                    
 At the moment the school roll stands  
 at 48 and the children attending the  
 school are aged between 4.5 and 12    
 years.                                
 Mrs. Colligan has been headmistress at
 the school since December 1969.There  
 are two assistant teachers at the     
 school as well as nine specialist     
 peripatetic teachers.                 
 School dinners are provided for all   
 children by the two school cooks.     </content>
