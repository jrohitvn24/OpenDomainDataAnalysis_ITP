  The landscape is largely rural with  
 the exception of the derelict         
 industrial North- West corner around  
 Rosewell.                             
  Farming was improved at the          
 beginning of the century when         
 land-owners enclosed the fields and   
 shelter belts were planted to improve 
 the micro-climate of the land.        
  These shelter belts still exist but  
 gales have blown down many of the     
 mature deciduous trees. Japanese Larch
 has commonly been used to replace     
 them. They are faster growing and     
 being thicker they make better wind   
 breaks.                               
  In the deep river valleys there      
  are natural woodlands. Dutch Elm     
 Disease has infected many trees, so   
 they are being removed.
