		<content> In this area the population is now    
 concentrated in the two villages of   
 Mosstodloch and Fochabers. They have  
 grown extensively while the hinterland
 i.e. the farms have been depleted of  
 families.                             
   The coming of mechanisation on the  
 farm means that one man and a tractor 
 can now work the land previously      
 requiring five men and ten horses.    
   One combined harvester can do in a  
 day what it took several workers      
 several weeks to achieve.             
   Social life now revolves around the 
 village hall where people from all    
 walks of life gather. The farm worker 
 shares the village life, no longer    
 living in a tied house on the farm,   
 receiving his termly meal,sticks and  
 coal supplies but getting a weekly    
 wage like his neighbours.
