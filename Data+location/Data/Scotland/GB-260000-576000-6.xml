		<content> Every home has newspapers,            
 magazines and books and the           
 Mobile Library is extensively         
 used. Although the children are fluent
 readers, they are not keen            
 recreational readers. Unlike the      
 adults, the children do not use       
 the Library Service to its full       
 potential.                            
   All homes have a television and a   
 radio. 50% of the homes possess 2     
 radios. 75% of the villagers have     
 their own telephone and there is one  
 telephone kiosk in the centre of the  
 village. 25% of the villagers, now,   
 own video recorders.                  
   A Post Bus(for mail and             
 passengers)travels twice daily from   
 Castle Douglas to New Galloway.       
   Conversation is still very          
 important in New Galloway,with Broad  
 Scots being widely spoken.            </content>
