		<title>13Lochore House</title>
		<content>  People say that{LOCHORE HOUSE}is     
 haunted by a White Lady but she seems 
 to have no connections with "Bonnie   
 Jean Jobson"of Lochore.She married{Sir
{Walter Scott's}son in 1825 and the    
 house was built for them.The cedars at
 the front  were planted by Sir Walter}
 himself!                              
  The ground now belongs to the NCB    
 and during World War Two the manager, 
 head engineer and electrician from the
 Mary Pit occupied the house.          
  During the 1960's Lochore House Youth
 Club met there and was granted Â£12,000
 for a new gym to be built. Activities 
 at the time included country dancing, 
 gymnastics, boxing etc.               
 Later,the premises were vandalised and
 the{Scottish Spastics Association}paid
 for the repairs. Now spastics from all
 over Fife meet there regularly.
