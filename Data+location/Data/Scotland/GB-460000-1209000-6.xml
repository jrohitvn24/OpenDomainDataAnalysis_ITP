		<content> Unst is famous for it's lace-weight   
 knitting. The best nape wool was      
 'rooed',plucked by hand from the      
 Shetland sheep,then carded and spun to
 make a 2-ply yarn.Traditional patterns
 were used in knitting wedding veils,  
 christening robes and stoles. Although
 there is a revival of interest in     
 spinning,lace wool now usually comes  
 from Brora Mills. It may take many    
 weeks to knit a shawl.Cockleshell     
 scarfs take 15 hours to knit.         
 Jumpers,gloves,scarves,berets and hats
 are knitted in traditional Fair Isle  
 patterns using 2-ply wool,most of     
 which comes from the mills. Hand      
 knitting has largely been superseded  
 by machine knitting which is much     
 quicker and increasingly              
 sophisticated.Knitting provides a     
 useful income in many households.
