		<title>04HURLFORD/CROOKEDHOLM SHOPS.</title>
		<content> In Hurlford and Crookedholm there are 
 shops like the butchers, Co-op,       
 newsagents, grocers, post-office and  
 the bank. Most people do their        
 shopping during the week in those     
 shops. Then at the weekend they go to 
 the supermarkets in Kilmarnock, like  
 Wm.Lows, Tesco and Presto. Most people
 get their food in Kilmarnock because  
 there is the best variety of shops.   
 They get their clothes from Kilmarnock
 as well and also their shoes,         
 medicines and electrical goods. There 
 is a bank in Hurlford, the Clydesdale,
 so it is necessary to go to Kilmarnock
 for the other banks. The post office  
 is small but the G.P.O is in          
 Kilmarnock two miles away.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
