		<title>16SKELMORLIE LIFE STYLES</title>
		<content>  Fashion in Skelmorlie is informal.   
 People like to be up to date without  
 being extreme. Jogging suits are ideal
 for village life for all ages.Baggy   
 trousers drawn in at the ankles with  
 lots of pockets,coloured socks and    
 jackie boots are the present craze for
 teenagers.                            
  Many boys are wearing wrist bands,   
 neck chains,rings and ear-rings now-  
 adays,although older males like our   
 fathers don't wear such things,only   
 wrist watches and wedding rings.      
  There is no organised "night life" in
 Skelmorlie for teenagers or young folk
 Regular discos are held in Greenock or
 Largs. Some of the older people go to 
 the "pub" or local hotel for a drink. 
  Families go out together to a local  
 hotel for a meal on a special         
 occasion such as a birthday.
