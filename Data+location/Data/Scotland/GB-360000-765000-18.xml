		<content> Mr Pirnie, the Hospital Administrator,
 came to school to tell us about the   
 exciting things going on in his       
 hospital.The bit I was interested in  
 was the sewage works.I could hardly   
 believe what happened there.The dirty 
 water goes down the systems and into  
 the sewage pipe.All the dirt is dried 
 and so is the paper after they have   
 been skimmed off.This is taken to the 
 furnace where the dried sludge is     
 burned.                               
 Now you are wondering where the water 
 goes.It goes down to a gravelly bit   
 where millions of insects eat the dirt
 left in the water.When the water gets 
 higher,it goes over and there is a man
 with a tumbler who tastes the water to
 see if it is good enough.
