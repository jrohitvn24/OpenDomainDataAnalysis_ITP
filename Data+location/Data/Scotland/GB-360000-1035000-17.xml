		<title>17FARMING IN THE SUMMER</title>
		<content>  During the summer the farmers have   
 many important things to do to ensure 
 that their farm and animals survive   
 the long, cold, windy winter.         
  One of the most vital things is to   
 make sure the animals have food when  
 the fields are bare or covered in     
 snow. This involves hay or silage     
 making which usually takes place      
 through the months of July and August 
 - and occupies nearly all of the      
 farmer's time in those months. After  
 this there are usually oats to be     
 brought in; these are also fed to the 
 animals.                              
  Another important job is the         
 maintenance of farm buildings to make 
 them proof enough to last through the 
 gales and storms which often occur    
 during the winter.
