		<content>  The population of this area is 141.  
 Since there is 6.67 sq.km. land area, 
 this means that there are 21 people   
 per sq.km. The population is made up  
 of 72 females and 69 males. Between   
 the ages of 0 and 4 there are 4       
 people, between the ages of 5 and 12  
 there are 14 people, between 13 and 18
 there are 16 people and between the   
 ages of 18 and 69 there are 93 people.
 This is an area of considerable       
 population change because we note     
 that, of the 63 houses, only 11       
 contain families which have at least  
 one member a native of the parish;    
 this represents 17%. There are few    
 young people in the area and yet the  
 population is not falling for several 
 new houses have been built recently.
