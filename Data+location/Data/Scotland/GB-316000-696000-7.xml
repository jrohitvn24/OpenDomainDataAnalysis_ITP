		<title>07Westfield - Lurgi Gas</title>
		<content>  The Lurgi Gas Plant at Westfield on  
 the outskirts of Ballingry was opened 
 officially by{HM the Queen}on 27th of 
 June 1961,it having produced its first
 gas on Boxing Day 1960.{LURGI}is the  
 name of the process used, and its name
 is an abbreviation of the name of a   
 German firm. From 1960-74 the plant   
 was making gas at a much cheaper rate 
 of production than was possible any-  
 where else. It used the poor quality  
 coal which was available on the site  
 and which was of little use for much  
 else.                                 
  In 1974, Scottish households had     
 their gas appliances converted for use
 of North Sea Gas, but a year earlier  
 an American funded experiment had     
 taken place at Westfield - the only   
 plant in the world with the capability
 to do it..........
