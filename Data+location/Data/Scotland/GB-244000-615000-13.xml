		<content> We have made a survey about the       
 children in Littlemill Primary School.
 There are only two classes,because    
 there are not many pupils in the      
 school.Obviously the classes are      
 composite.The young class has 13      
 pupils aged between 5 and 8 years of  
 age.The older class has 19 pupils aged
 between 9 and 12.This makes a total of
 32 pupils.The children come from 24   
 families.                             
 We looked back through the old school 
 register and found that only 22 pupils
 have never been in another school. Ten
 of our present pupils are incomers.   
 We also found out that of our 24      
 families ,17 have always lived in the 
 village and 7 are incomers.These      
 figures show that there has been a    
 movement of the local people mainly   
 because of unemployment.
