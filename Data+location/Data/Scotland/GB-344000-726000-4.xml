		<content> Transport in our block consists of    
{cars,motor bikes,mopeds,bicycles and  
{buses.}We found out that 67.6% of     
 Tayports people travel about by       
 car.And that{4.1%}travel about by     
 motor bike{1.7%}of the people in      
 Tayport travel about by mopeds and    
 that most of the children have        
 bicycles.                             
    There are two long distance lorry  
 drivers,who own their{lorries.        
  We used to have transport by rail    
 and ferry across the river before     
 the Tay road bridge was built in{1966.
    The{bus service}runs every half    
 hour during weekdays and Saturdays to 
 and from Dundee and ST Andrews.On     
 Sundays they come every one to two    
 hours.
