		<content> The rural area within our D_Block     
 lends itself well to all sorts of     
 country pastimes. Walking and rambling
 along the many country lanes and old  
 coach roads is very popular for all   
 ages, while for the younger generation
 (and the more energetic elders!) there
 is motorbike scrambling along the farm
 tracks and in the Rossie Den quarry.  
 This does not meet with the approval  
 of the farmers and local land owners. 
 Some of the older members of the      
 community remember the times (pre WW2)
 when there was a golf course on the   
 western side of Rossie Farm.          
 Our map area has always been much used
 for outdoor recreation. Indeed, the   
 southern part of the map was part of  
 the hunting estate of Falkland Palace,
 a favourite haunt of Mary Queen of    
 Scots!
