		<title>10HOUSING-RURAL SETTING</title>
		<content>    Most of the houses are privately   
 owned here with gardens and trees .The
 secondary school is surrounded with   
 lovely playing fields and community   
 halls .The old quarry has been filled 
 in to make more space for houses and  
 factories of all different kinds from 
 a tea blenders to a tile factory which
 makes tiles for hospitals and floors  
 for big offices .There aren't many    
 shops here but most people have cars  
 and there is a railway station and    
 lots of buses .There is an area of    
 houses where people who were in the   
 Territorial Army live ,these houses   
 all look the same .Some of the streets
 here are very quiet even though there 
 are factories and buses .The factories
 are on a part of the district that is 
 like a country road on a hill and     
 hidden from view behind a beech hedge
