		<content>   Even though there are many beatiful 
 ,well kept homes with attractive      
 gardens in our town there is very     
 little employment for their           
 owners.Banchory is now regarded as a  
 dormitory community,for a high        
 percentage of the residents must      
 travel to Aberdeen,the massive oil    
 centre of Europe,for work a practice  
 which many people employ daily.       
   It is now very expensive to live in 
 this beautiful part of{Deeside}with   
 house prices ranging from forty       
 thousand pounds to well over a hundred
 thousand.A prospective buyer coming to
{Banchory}will find the veiws afforded 
 to them over the Dee Valley so        
 breathtaking  that very few leave with
 out deciding that this is where their 
 future dream home will be situated!
