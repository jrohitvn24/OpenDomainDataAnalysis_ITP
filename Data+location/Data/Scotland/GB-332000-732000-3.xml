		<content> Fowlis is a small village situated    
 approximately one and one quarter km. 
 north of the A85 Trunk road to        
 Perth.It consists of a                
 church,castle,school,old mill,smithy  
 and a few houses.In the past Fowlis   
 was heavily populated but it is now   
 occupied by families who commute to   
 Dundee and pensioners.                
     The school is due to be closed    
 summer 1985 because of the lack of    
 pupils. The site of the old church    
 dates from 1142 but the church itself 
 was not built until 1453 and boasts of
 being one of the oldest in Scotland.  
      The castle built in 1640 was     
 formally much larger but has recently 
 been renovated.
