		<title>15ESTATE LAND IN EDAY</title>
		<content>    For many years the majority of the 
 land on Eday was owned by one family, 
 the head of which was known locally as
 "the Laird".                          
    This family rented out many of the 
 crofts for a very small amount per    
 annum to the local people.            
    Lately legislation has come into   
 being to ensure that rented land can  
 be bought by crofters for fifteen     
 times their annual rent. Many took up 
 this option and now own the land.     
    Also the laird's family have been  
 willing to sell off hill land at a    
 reasonable price to enable farmers to 
 increase their acreage or allow new   
 farms to come into being. Therefore   
 much of the land on the west side of  
 the island, which was mainly rough    
 heather and peat banks, has now been  
 converted to grazing land.
