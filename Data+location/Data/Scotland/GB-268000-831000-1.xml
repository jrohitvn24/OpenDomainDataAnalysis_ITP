		<content>  The settlement of Farr stretches     
 along the B851 which leaves the A9 and
 leads to Fort Augustus.               
  As it is only about 9 miles from     
 Inverness it is becoming a popular    
 place to live for those who work in   
 town but do not like to live there.A  
 new water supply is making it possible
 for landowners to sell building plots 
 where there is no well or spring.     
  Sixty six people live in this block. 
 Eleven of them are children. The      
 people can use the post office,the    
 primary school,and the two churches   
 when they wish.                       
 The minister of the Free Presbyterian 
 Church lives in a manse opposite the  
 church while the minister of the      
 United Free Church on the B851 lives  
 in Tomatin.The members of these       
 churches have strict rules about      
 keeping the Sabboth holy.             </content>
