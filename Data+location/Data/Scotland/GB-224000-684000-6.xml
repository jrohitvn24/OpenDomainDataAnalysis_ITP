		<title>06NEW DEVELOPMENT IN RHU</title>
		<content> As we live in a Conservation          
 area,strict planning regulations have 
 to be met to ensure that the new      
 blends in discretely with the         
 old.While some remain family homes,the
 trend for the '80's is for the        
 sub_division of mansions into luxury  
 flats and the gardens split and sold  
 as building plots.Thus,new development
 tends to consist of detached houses,  
 predominantly of timber_frame         
 construction,interspersed amongst the 
 old houses on the fringes of the      
 village.An exception to this is the   
 new Broseley estate which includes    
 terraced houses and flats built by    
 traditional methods on the site of a  
 former orchard in the village centre. 
 Also in great demand are former lodge 
 houses and stable blocks for          
 renovation and conversion into homes.
