		<content>{Dysart}is an old market town which    
 used to depend upon the harbour for   
 its prosperity and trade. The{Market  
{Cross}dates back to 1837 whereas{The  
{Cannons},now a grocer's ,used to be a 
 ship-chandler's and had two large     
 cannon on its roof , hence its name.  
 The effect of the{Frances Pit}(locally
 called the 'Dubbie') on the           
 environment has been devastating. The 
 spoil from the bing has been washed up
 on the beach covering the sand.       
 The old name for the town was the{Saut
{Burgh}after the salt-pans which were  
 worked nearby. Another place of       
 interest would be the{McDouall-Stuart 
{Museum}named after the first man to   
 cross Australia. The{Clock-tower and  
{Town hall}date from 1576 and are often
 used as a subject for local artists.
