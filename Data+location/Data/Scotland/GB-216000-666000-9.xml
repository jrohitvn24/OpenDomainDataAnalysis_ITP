		<content> Each year the school organises some   
 events.The first event is a Christmas 
 Coffee Morning with stalls selling    
 handwork,baking,plants,books and toys.
 This raises funds for school use.All  
 the classes have Christmas parties.   
  The next event is the May Fete,held  
 outside,mainly with games although we 
 do have stalls with baking,handwork   
 and plants.                           
  June has Sports Day with all sorts of
 races.Points can be gained for your   
 House Team.The Houses are Kelly(green)
 Winton(yellow),Montgomerie(blue) and  
 Eglinton(red).                        
  The end of June brings prizegiving   
 with certificates for academic work,  
 progress and any special ability shown
 by a pupil.Prize giving is usually a  
 very happy event as it marks the      
 beginning of the summer holidays.
