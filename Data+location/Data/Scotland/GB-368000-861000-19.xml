		<content> Banff is changing all the time.Old    
 buildings are being put to new uses   
 and new houses and shops are either   
 being built or are planned for the    
 near future.                          
   The two most important developments 
 under way at present are the building 
 of a Fine Fare hypermarket by the     
 river,and of a William Low supermarket
 in the Bridge Street area. When these 
 are finished early in 1986,they will  
 have a big effect on shopping in the  
 town.                                 
   A sheltered housing unit has been   
 opened near the Deveronvale football  
 pitch.An old building in High Street  
 is being turned into flats by a       
 private builder. Our newest street is 
 Albert Place-47 houses built by the   
 District Council.                     
   Some new private housing is also    
 being built in Banff and Macduff.     </content>
