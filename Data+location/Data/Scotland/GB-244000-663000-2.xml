		<title>02Unemployment in Millerston</title>
		<content>   This survey included{72}people.Sadly
 a lot were unemployed{(36%)}.This is  
 a sad situation, as some are school   
 leavers who have never been employed. 
   Of the unemployed, some have been   
 out of work for a year{(8%)},but      
 more have been out of work for more   
 than 2 years{(12%)}.In the past 3     
 months a lot of older people have been
 made redundant{(27%)}.Some people have
 been unemployed for over 2 years{     
{(54%)}.                               
   We asked if unemployment had        
 affected people's way of life; most   
 said it had{(54%)}.Less money,        
 boredom, and a drop in their standard 
 of living were some of the            
 disadvantages of unemployment.The only
 advantage was that people had more    
 leisure time.
