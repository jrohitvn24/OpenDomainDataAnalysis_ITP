		<content> This area is{sparsely populated}with  
 no village as such, having only twelve
 main farms within its boundaries.     
 Previously, there were many smaller   
 farms and crofts, but because of      
 mechanisation and greater labour      
 costs, they became uneconomical to run
 as single units and have gradually    
 been taken over by neighbouring       
 farmers.                              
 Conversely, some farms, which were    
 formerly part of a larger estate, have
 been bought by their tenants.  Much of
 the population is{static. }In some    
 cases two generations of a family     
 are working on farms which have been  
 owned by their ancestors since the    
 last century.
