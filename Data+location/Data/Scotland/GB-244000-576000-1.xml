		<content>  Along the Northern edge of this block
 runs the only access route.  A land   
 rover track, from Loch Trool in the W.
 to Clatteringshaws Loch in the E.  The
 area comprises mainly 2 large hills:  
 The White Hill with its summit Curley 
 Wee in the West and the Black Laggan  
 ward in the East.  In between run the 
 White and Black Laggan burns, which   
 join each other just north of the     
 White Laggan Bothie after which the   
 burn flows into Loch Dee. The Bothie  
 is a little shelter-house, open to    
 anyone who will respect the rules of  
 the house - keep it clean. The house  
 looks out over the loch. The area is  
 mainly moor, ferns, heather &amp; bracken,
 but on the Eastern slopes the Forestry
 Commission has recently planted young 
 fir trees. The only other building is 
 the Black Laggan ruin, a former       
 shepherd's hut now deserted.          </content>
