		<title>05Peat Cutting Tongue</title>
		<content> Peat is formed when rotting vegetat   
 ion is compresed over the years until 
 it forms a black substance which, when
 dried, will burn  well and give a     
 clear fierce heat. Peat covers large  
 parts of the Highlands and is dug by  
 the crofters and used for fuel. A     
{flaughter spade} has a curved shaft a 
 cross bar and a sharp blade for       
 skimming the surface off the peat.    
 Then a{talisker}with a flanged blade  
 is used for cutting the soft peat.The 
 cut blocks measuring approx 25cmx15cmx
 20cm are thrown out on to the banks to
 dry after which they are built into   
 little heaps where the wind can dry   
 them thoroughly. At a convenient time 
 they are taken home usually by tractor
 and built into a peat stack near the  
 house.
