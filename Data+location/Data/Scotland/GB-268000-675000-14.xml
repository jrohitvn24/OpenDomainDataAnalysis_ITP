		<content>     I spend my spare time on a pony   
 called Judy. I am going to try and    
 make some small jumps for her. I      
 exercise her as much as I can and     
 clean out the paddock. A pony takes up
 a lot of time.                        
     My spare time is nearly always    
 spent fishing for trout. I used to do 
 course fishing in the canal. I would  
 catch roach,pike or perch.            
     I go to dancing lessons on a      
 Tuesday night in the Garrell Vale     
 centre. It starts with majorettes.Then
 tap dancing. Later we have disco      
 dancing. We have a show. I have 12    
 medals and 6 certificates.            
     Three times a week I go to        
 gymnastics. They are held in the      
 leisure centre. I have just learned   
 to do the splits. I will be in a      
 competition in October.
