		<title>01General review north:FINTRY</title>
		<content> The area which people who live here,  
 think of as Fintry, covers 4 squares  
 of this Domesday Survey. See also:    
                                       
{   02640684, 02600684, 02560687.

 Settlement is largely confined to the 
 narrow valley cut by Endrick Water    
 into the hills, that both surround and
 dominate all who live here. Locals say
                                       
{ "out of the world and into Fintry".} 
                                       
 Fintry north contains Culcreuch House 
 and the most recent housing. Landuse  
 is predominantly agricultural although
 few people actually work on the land. 
                                       
 The pages that follow cover aspects of
