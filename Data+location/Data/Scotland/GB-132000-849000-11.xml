		<title>11EDINBANE-HEBRIDEAN TOWNSHIP</title>
		<content> Edinbane is a small crofting township 
 on the Isle of Skye off north-west    
 Scotland. It lies at the head of Loch 
 Greshornish, fourteen miles from      
 Portree on the Portree-Dunvegan road. 
 The houses are situated round the head
 of the loch and in a line along the   
 hill-face with the croft land running 
 in strips down to the loch. Behind the
 croft houses is an area of common     
 grazing land, rough grazing merging   
 with heather. Surrounding Edinbane are
 areas of grass and rolling heather    
 moorland rising to 500ft. The soil is 
 acid and cannot be drained easily     
 because of ingneous rock formations.  
 This has led to the formation of peat 
 bogs. Where there is good drainage,   
 oats and potatoes are grown, but wet  
 weather can ruin the oats. Loch       
 Greshornish is a sea loch, part of    
 Loch Snizort.                         </content>
