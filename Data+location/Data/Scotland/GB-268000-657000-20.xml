 The attractive 18th and 19th C.       
 stone_built core of the commuter      
 village of Bothwell (population c5500)
 is a designated Conservation Area,    
 while part of the town of Blantyre    
 (population c20,000) has recently been
 identified as an area of multiple     
 deprivation requiring priority        
 treatment from the various agencies of
 Strathclyde Regional Council.         
   Throughout the study area change and
 environmental improvement are dominant
 themes despite the economic           
 conditions. Blantyre for example has  
 recently acquired a new health centre,
 a sports centre, a shopping complex,  
 sheltered housing and by_pass.
