		<title>17HAWICK COMMON RIDING.</title>
		<content> The Common Riding is the re-enactment 
 of the former Riding of the "Marches" 
 (Borderers) of the common land of the 
 people of Hawick.The commemoration,   
 has through the years become somewhat 
 embellished and parts of the ceremony 
 today relate to an alleged incident   
 following the Battle of Flodden. The  
 principals in the Common Riding are   
 the Cornet and the Acting Father, the 
 former representing the leader of the 
 young able bodied men and the latter  
 the senior magistrate or burgess of   
 the town.The actual riding of the     
 boundaries takes place on the 2nd last
 day of the festivities but this is    
 preceded by 6 Rideouts where the      
 principals and male mounted           
 supporters visit outlying villages. A 
 Race Meeting is the culmination of the
 festivities at the Moor.This is a     
 family day in the form of a picnic.   </content>
