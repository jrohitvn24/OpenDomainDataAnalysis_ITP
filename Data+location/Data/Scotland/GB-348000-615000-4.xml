 Long ago when the Hawick Auction Mart 
 first started in l8l7, it was         
 conducted behind the Tower Hotel.     
 Later in l883 the Mart was moved to   
 its present location. Mr. Kenneth     
 Oliver who is the owner has worked    
 there for 53 years. The man who told  
 us about it said that you have to be  
 experienced for this job. In the olden
 days it cost half a crown for a poor  
 cow. Nowadays it costs between Â£8O and
 Â£lOO. In season there is a sale every 
 Wednesday when they sell fatstock.    
 Every other Thursday there is a sale -
 these are store sales (mixture of     
 cattle). The Aucion Mart used to sell 
 young pigs and calves but nowadays    
 farms are more mechanised and there   
 aren't as many farms that keep young  
 calves and pigs to fatten up so there 
 are not as many to sell in the sales. </content>
