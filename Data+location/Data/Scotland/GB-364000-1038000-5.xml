		<title>05AIRFIELD ATTENDANT</title>
		<content> Mr. Lennie has worked 18 years for    
 Loganair. His duties are to attend the
 fire-tender. He arrives in a tractor  
 to pull the fire-tender when there is 
 an emergency. He goes up to the       
 airfield only for scheduled flights.  
 When there is an ambulance flight he  
 only needs to go at night. He is paid 
 for every plane that lands. He has    
 one assistant who helps him with      
 weighing the luggage and logging it.  
 Each flight is also logged. He spends 
 about 1 hour at the airfield, but     
 when there is fog he may have to stay 
 4 or 5 hours. Mr. Lennie has had one  
 emergency. On June 1st, 1984, one of  
 the planes crashed into a potato      
 field not far from the airfield. The  
 fire-tender was taken to where the    
 plane crashed, but wasn't needed.     
 No-one was injured but the plane was a
 write-off.                            </content>
