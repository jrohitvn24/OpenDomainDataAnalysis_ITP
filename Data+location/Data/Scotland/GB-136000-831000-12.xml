		<title>12TALISKER JUNIOR ARCHERS.</title>
		<content> This is a club for all the young      
 people in our area from 8 to 16.In it 
 we learn lots of interesting things   
 about archery as well as how to use   
 the bow and look after the            
 equipment.Safety plays a very         
 important part in the sport and all   
 Club members must obey the rules set  
 out.We have joined the official       
 organisations for archery, and hope to
 earn badges.When we are good enough,  
 we can take part in competitions.     
 To raise funds for the club,the       
 primary school and some parents put on
 a concert in the Village Hall. The    
 club also applied to the Sports       
 Council for grant aid.The community   
 also gave some other financial help,to
 get the club started.
