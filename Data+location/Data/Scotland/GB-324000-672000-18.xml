		<title>18Multicultural Education</title>
		<content>{Multicultural Education}is a system of
{education}in which the curriculum is  
 altered to involve the cultures of the
{minority groups}There are people from 
 India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and China 
 at Drummond Community High{School.}A  
 glimpse of the cultures of these      
 countries is given by the formation   
 of several clubs such as the 'Asian   
 Girls Club'. Performances by musicians
 of different countries and teaching of
 Asian languages outside school hours  
 all help to encourage appreciation of 
 cultures other than the British.      
 Stalls selling Indian, Caribbean and  
 Scottish food are often set up to give
 people a taste of what is eaten in    
 others' homes. As an Asian, these     
 changes, in my opinion, are helping to
 bridge the gap between the eastern and
 western cultures in the{school}where  
 we were once greatly divided.         </content>
