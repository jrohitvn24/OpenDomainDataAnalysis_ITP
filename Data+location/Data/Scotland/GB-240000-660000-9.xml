 Johnstone,and is still in good repair.
 St.Pauls, built in 1791, is also      
 Church of Scotland.Both are situated  
 in the town centre.St.Aidans is a R.C.
 church built in 1967 and it is very   
 modern compared with St.Margaret's,   
 another R.C. church which was built in
 1852,but is still in good condition.  
 Johnstone Castle has 2 churches and   
 Spateston has 1.In Johnstone Castle   
 stands St.Margaret's and St.Andrew's. 
 St.Andrew's was situated down the town
 untill 1978 when the original church  
 built in 1844 became in a bad state of
 repair. In Spateston there is also a  
 R.C. Church called St.Anthony's.Since 
 then a Church of the Latter Day Saints
 has been built.(A Mormon Church).All  
 of these churches have clubs for all  
 ages.                                 </content>
