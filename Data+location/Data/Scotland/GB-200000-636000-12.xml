		<title>12THE FORESTRY COMMISSION (1)</title>
		<content>   The Forestry Commission has an      
 office in Brodick and controls most of
 the forest land on the island except  
 that which is privately owned.        
   The Forestry Commission employ      
 eleven men on Arran and own           
 approximately 20,000 hectares of land.
 7,500 hectares of this is forested.   
   The types of trees on Arran are     
 mainly{SITKA SPRUCE}with some{LARCH   
 and hardwood species.  The Sitka      
 Spruce grows best on Arran as it grows
 very well in any tupe of soil.  Birch 
 saplings have been planted recently on
 the String Road.                      
   A landscaping officer draws up plans
 showing which trees are to be cut     
 down.  The trees are usually felled   
 when they are 50 years old unless     
 they have already been damaged by     
 storms or wind.
