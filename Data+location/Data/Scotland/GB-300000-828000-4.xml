 The oldest building in the area is    
 Castle Grant, a building which dates  
 form medievil times and is the home of
 the clan Grant.  As with most castles 
 it has been extended and changed      
 periodically.  Today it is being      
 restored and several rooms are open to
 the public.                           
                                       
 The town of Grantown-on-Spey contains 
 many buildings of a later vintage,    
 which are worthy of note.  The town   
 was planned around a green, known as  
 the Square.  A wide, tree-lined road  
 splits the square.  Most of the       
 buildings are of granite, including   
 Speyside House, which is capped by a  
 cupola containing a clock, erected at 
 the time of the Napoleonic wars.
