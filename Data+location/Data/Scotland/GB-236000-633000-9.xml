		<title>09DUNDONALD _ A TYPICAL FAMILY</title>
		<content>  My family live in the village of     
 Dundonald in a Local Authority        
 Council house. It is a five-roomed,   
 semi-detatched house with a fairly    
 small garden which my dad quite enjoys
 keeping tidy.                         
  My dad works as an engineer at       
 British Aerospace  10 miles away at   
 Prestwick. The firm has just won an   
 Â£84 million contract for their        
 Jetstream aircraft so my dad's job    
 should be safe for a while!           
  My Mum works too as an nurse at the  
 big new hospital at Crosshouse. She   
 likes it there because it is very     
 modern.                               
  My big brother goes to Marr College  
 and my little brother and I go to     
 Dundonald Primary School which we like
 a lot.                                
  We all like living in the village and
 would not like to go back to Glasgow! </content>
