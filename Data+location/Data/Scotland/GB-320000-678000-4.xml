		<content> This information was collected by     
 the members of Davidson's Mains       
 Women's Rural Institute with the      
 assistance of the Royal Society for   
 the Protection of Birds, for whose    
 help we are grateful.                 
                                       
  We should also like to acknowledge   
 the assistance of the Forth Ports     
 Authority who offered to take us to   
 the island in one of their ships.     
 However, the correct combination of   
 weather, tide, vessels and members has
 not been forth coming to date (24th   
 November, 1985) since our involvement 
 in the project.
