		<title>07NEW ABBEY - FARMING</title>
		<content>   Farmland is of a very high quality  
 being low-lying and sheltered. Farms  
 are usually between 100 and 200 acres 
 in size. Some are tenanted while      
 others are farmed by their owners.    
   Most of the farms have dairy herds  
 of 80-100 cows, nearly all Friesians. 
 Only two farms still use byres.Others 
 keep the cows in loose-housing and    
 milk them in parlours of the "herring-
 bone" type.                           
   Grass is grown in most of the fields
 and made into silage. Some farms grow 
 small acreages of barley but few root 
 crops.                                
   Some bullocks are fattened, either  
 Hereford cross or crossed with a      
 Continental breed such as Simmental,  
 Limousin or Charolais.                
   A few farms keep sheep, mostly      
 Blackfaces or Greyfaces,but not many  
 hens or pigs are kept.                </content>
