		<title>16A DAY IN MY LIFE  by ROBBIE</title>
		<content>   I  get up at half past eight and get
 dressed and have tea and toast for    
{breakfast.}Then I get a lift in the   
 school car if it is a wet day. When we
 go in we have a prayer, briefly do our
 News and then do our Mathematics      
 until half past ten. I may do my      
 kniting until it is time for break    
 which starts at eleven o'clock. We go 
 in at quarter past eleven and do      
 Spelling and maybe Cliffhangers until 
 our meal arrives from{Lochinver.      
    We have our lunch which today is   
 potatoes,stew,turnip and jelly and    
 cream for pudding.  We then have      
 another longer break in which we play 
{Cops and Robbers}or{Tig.}We go in at  
 half past one. We usually do something
 in our study book until half three    
 when I go home.I usually go out to    
 play and then have tea. I will then   
 watch T.V until bedtime at 9p.m.      </content>
