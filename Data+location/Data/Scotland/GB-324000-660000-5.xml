		<title>05BEESLACK HIGH SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Beeslack High School is on the        
 outskirts of Penicuik and is built in 
 the grounds of Beeslack House.It was  
 opened on the 15th August 1984. A new 
 high school was needed because        
 Penicuik High was overcrowded.  The   
 primary schools that feed into it are,
 Mauricewood, Ladywood, Glencorse,     
 Bilston and Roslin. It is a beautiful 
 school with facilities like a swimming
 pool, a games hall and 2 football and 
 1 rugby pitch.    The school is       
 surrounded by trees and large grassy  
 areas.  At the present time there are 
 454 pupils, although the school is    
 built to take a larger number.        
 There are 17 teachers and eighteen    
 different subjects which can be       
 taught. Presently only 1st to 3rd year
 pupils attend the school but it will  
 eventually become a full 6 year       
 secondary school.                     </content>
