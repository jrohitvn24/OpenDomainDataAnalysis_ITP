		<title>11CHANGES ON DUNECHT ESTATE</title>
		<content>{Lord Cowdray}has been involved with   
 the management of Dunecht Estate since
 1931 and there have been many changes 
 during that time.                     
 In 1931 very few of the houses had    
 bathrooms or running water,and all the
 Estate houses now have bathrooms.Water
 now comes to houses and farms in main 
 pipes where formally it came from     
 wells and ditches.                    
{Farms and houses}where they had       
 electricity,had their own generators, 
 but now they have mains electricity   
 from the Hydro Electricity Board.     
 Fifty years ago many of the farms on  
 the Estate had dairy cows,but now     
 there are very few and these farms    
 produce beef and sheep.               
 Many of the farms were originally     
 quite small,but as the tenants have   
 retired,the land has been added to    
 adjoining areas to form larger farms. </content>
