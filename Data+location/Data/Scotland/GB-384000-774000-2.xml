		<title>02MRS.ADAMS' DAY IN KINNEFF</title>
		<content> This morning I woke at 7a.m. I        
 switched on the television and woke   
 the children. We had breakfast. I     
 dusted and tidied the house and       
 switched on the washing machine. I    
 hoovered, made the beds and hung out  
 the washing. I took my son,           
 Christopher, to Inverbervie by bus to 
 the playgroup. I went shopping and    
 collected Christopher at 11.30a.m. We 
 had lunch at my mother's. We went home
 by car. I did the ironing. I prepared 
 and served the tea. After tea I       
 switched on the immersion heater and  
 washed the dishes. I bathed the       
 children and put Christopher to bed.  
 Angela, my daughter, put on the       
 electric blankets. We watched         
 television. At 9p.m. Angela went to   
 bed. At 10p.m. I made tea and toast   
 and locked the door. I switched       
 everything off and went to bed.       </content>
