		<content> The intertidal area at the estauries  
 of the Rivers Garnock and Irvine is   
 known as the Bogside Flats.This is a  
{Site of Special Scientific Interest}  
 which is the only salt marsh between  
 the Clyde and the Solway Firth.       
 It attracts thousands of waders and   
 wildfowl in the winter.               
{Some 2% of Britain's population of    
{golden plovers}winter on Bogside      
 Flats,along with hundreds of lapwings,
 teal and wigeon(to name but a few).In 
 late summer the estuary attracts      
 relatively rare birds such as         
 black-tailed godwits and greenshanks. 
 The highest grey heron count (55) for 
 Ayrshire was recorded there in 1984   
 and as many as 10 short-eared owls    
 were recorded on one occasion.
