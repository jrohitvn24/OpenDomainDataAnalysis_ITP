		<content> The Duke of Gordon built the          
 distillery at the beginning of the    
 19th century. It was rebuilt by John  
 Begg in 1820 after a fire. There are  
 12 people employed. There is a brewer,
 secretary, cleaner, cooper, 2 mashmen,
 3 stillmen,a tractor man, and a man   
 who does anything. My dad is the      
 Customs and Excise man also known as  
 'the gauger'. In the distillery there 
 are two dams which are used for the   
 making of the whisky. Inside the      
 stillhouse there is a glass case and  
 it shows you how to make whisky. Next 
 year there are plans to open a        
 Visitors' Centre. There are 4 or more 
 warehouses which my dad locks up. When
 the bottles were sold in square boxes 
 it said 'Lochnager 12 years Young'. My
 dad does the VAT and goes to Braemar, 
 Ballater, Tarland etc. A whisky lorry 
 comes on Monday and Thursday.         </content>
