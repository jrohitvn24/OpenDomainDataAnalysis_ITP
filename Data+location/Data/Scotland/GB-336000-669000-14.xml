		<title>14ST. CLEMENT'S WELL</title>
		<content> WE WENT TO ST.CLEMENT'S WELL EXPECTING
 TO SEE A WATER WELL.WE COULD NOT FIND 
 ONE.WE SAW A TALL SQUARE BUILDING.    
 INSIDE WE SAW LOTS OF LITTLE NEST     
 BOXES.THERE HAD BEEN A ROOF BUT IT HAD
 FALLEN IN.THERE WERE SMALL HOLES NEAR 
 THE TOP.WE DECIDED IT WAS PROBABLY A  
 DOOCOT_A PLACE TO KEEP PIGEONS. NEARBY
 WAS AN OLD UNUSED PETROL PUMP.  LONG  
 AGO THE PUMP WAS PROBABLY USED TO     
 REFUEL THE FARMERS TRACTOR. WE SAW AN 
 OLD RUINED FARMHOUSE AND BARN. THE    
 GARDEN WAS  VERY OVERGROWN BUT WE SAW 
 PANSIES,VIOLETS,LUPINS AND CLOVER.ON  
 THE WAY BACK WE MET A MAN  WHO TOLD   
 US THERE HAD BEEN A BREWERY  NEARBY.  
 THE BREWERY WAS WHERE THE NEW HOUSES  
 STAND.A BREWERY REQUIRES WATER.WE     
 THINK PERHAPS THE WATER CAME FROM     
 ST.CLEMENT'S WELL,BUT WE ARE NOT SURE.
