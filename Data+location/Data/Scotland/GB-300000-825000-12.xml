		<title>12Church of Scotland</title>
		<content>    The church was erected in{1885}by  
{Caroline Stuart, Countess of Seafield 
 in memory of her husband and son, the 
 7th and 8th Earl of Seafield who died 
 within three months of each other.    
    Originally it was called{Inverallan
{Church,}but when it{combined}with the 
{South Church}it served the new parish 
 of Grantown on Spey and therefore     
 became{Grantown on Spey Church of     
{Scotland.                             
    It seats 1000 people but           
 unfortunately Grantown does not have a
 reputation of being keen churchgoers  
 and there are seldom this many in     
 church.                               
    At a funeral recently, 1100 people 
 packed the church to mourn.           
    The present minister is{Rev. Colin 
{Alston.
