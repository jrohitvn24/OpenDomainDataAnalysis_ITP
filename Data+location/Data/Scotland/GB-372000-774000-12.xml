		<content> Parts of the A94 have recently been   
 changed into a dual crriageway to     
 provide a better link between Aberdeen
 &amp; Dundee.  The Fordoun by pass section
 was started in 1983 and finished 2\   
 years later in august 1985.  Since the
 A94's upgrading the journey to        
 Aberdeen takes 30 minutes instead of  
 45.  More lorries are using the cafe  
 although the hotel's trade has dropped
 since the road workers have left.  New
 bus bays have been made on the road   
 althouh the secondary school bus has  
 changed route and now goes along the  
 A92 for some distance.  Primary school
 children from Fordoun now travel along
 a slightly longer but safer route     
 using a new underpass to get to       
 Redmyre Primary School.
