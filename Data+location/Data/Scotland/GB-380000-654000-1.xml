		<content> One of the most tranquil parts of the 
 Scottish Borderland, lying in "The    
 Merse", a sheltered fertile valley    
 stretching inland from the eastern    
 coast roughly parallel to the course  
 of the River Tweed.  Magnificent views
 look north to the Lammermuir Hills,   
 eastwards as far as the coastline at  
 Berwick-upon-Tweed, 15 miles away &amp;   
 south to the Cheviot Hills in         
 Northumberland.  As in the rest of    
 this county, there are no traffic     
 lights, no pedestrian crossings &amp;     
 traffic is minimal.  Housing is almost
 entirely composed of farmhouses &amp;     
 their adjacent cottages.  Occupations 
 are mainly agricultural, with         
 supporting services.  Some workers    
 commute to Berwick, Eyemouth &amp;        
 Galashiels.
