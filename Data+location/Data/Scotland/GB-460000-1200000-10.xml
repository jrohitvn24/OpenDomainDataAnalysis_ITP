		<title>10Uyeasound Standing Stones.</title>
		<content> There are 2 standing stones near      
 Clivocast,one 8 feet high,the other 2 
 feet high.Myth says that trolls are   
 related to stone and earth.Trolls only
 come out at night and if they are     
 still out at sunrise they turn to     
 stone.                                
  There was once a troll called Spike  
 who liked to play tricks on people.He 
 went into a house just before sunrise 
 where a man was watching T.V.Grown-ups
 can't see trolls but children can.    
 Spike switched off the T.V. and the   
 man switched it on again.The son came 
 in and said,"there's a troll over     
 there,"to which his Dad replied,"you  
 must be seeing things." So Spike took 
 the boy and they ran past Clivocast   
 just as the sun rose but both were    
 turned to stone and the standing      
 stones remain to this day.
