 in the school grounds.                
 'It was a very hot day and we were    
 wearing T shirts. We found lots of    
 daisies and there were millions of    
 flowers on the whins. My collecting   
 tub was full with mosses and grasses. 
 I saw a big beetle. Alan picked it up 
 with two tubs and took it into the    
 classroom and put it into the sink.   
 We found narrow leaved plantain, dand 
 elion, ragwort, mouse-eared           
 chickweed,and hawkweed.There were lots
 of grasses which I didn't know.We went
 into the woods and onto the football  
 pitch. The last ones I saw were butter
 cups, sedge, clover, bird's foot      
 trefoil,tormentil and bracken. Later  
 in the summer there will be more wild 
 flowers to see.'
