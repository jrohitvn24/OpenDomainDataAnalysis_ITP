		<content> Carsphairn Women's Rural Institute was
 formed in 1935.The annual membership  
 subscription was 2/-.Meetings were    
 arranged for a Thursday evening when  
 there was a full moon to help the     
 ladies to see their way home on foot  
 or bicycle.An annual whist drive and  
 dance were held in November.Membership
 at its peak was over 50.              
  Meetings are still held each month,  
 with talks, demonstrations, light     
 entertainment, and competitions.There 
 is no longer any necessity to be sure 
 of the full moon, as most members now 
 travel by car!                        
  This year, 1985, is the Golden Year, 
 and it is to be celebrated in November
 with a supper party and entertainment 
 by a Young Farmers' Club.
