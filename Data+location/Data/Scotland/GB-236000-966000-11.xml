		<content>{Place Name} In Gaelic Durness is      
 spelt Diuranais. It is thought to mean
 black point. Dur meaning black (of the
 peat) and Ness a point (Farraid Head).
{The Clearances} When the clearances   
 took place last century,many people   
 were thrown out of their  homes, so   
 that there was more land for sheep.   
 There are still ruins of the little   
 croft houses on the rocky land at     
 Sangobeg where the people were forced 
 to live.                              
{Durness  Hotel}This large building    
 stood in the Square and was burnt down
 in 1908.The walls stood until the late
 1950's when it was demolished.        
{Sangomore Smithy}Built in 1910 using  
 stones and slates from the Durness    
 Hotel.Inside is the furnace and large 
 leather bellows.It is only used very  
 occasionally today.
