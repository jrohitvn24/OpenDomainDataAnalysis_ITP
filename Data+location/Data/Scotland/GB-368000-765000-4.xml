		<content>   The senior room runs a daily        
 routine.  We have 16 people in the    
 classroom including the head teacher. 
 There are 16 tables in the room, not  
 including the teacher's table.  Two of
 the tables are used for setting out   
 tests and books.  The school computer,
 a Sinclair Spectrum, is also kept in  
 the Senior's room.  In our room there 
 are three classes - primary 5, primary
 6 and primary 7.  There are five      
 pupils in each class.  The school pet 
 gerbils, Sweet and Sour, are looked   
 after by the Seniors.  Our visiting   
 teachers for gym, art, music and home 
 economics, come from Mearns Academy,  
 the nearest secondary school.  We     
 travel there by mini bus for swimming 
 lessons during the summer term.       
    During the year the nurse, doctor, 
 dentist and audiometrician visit the  
 school to check the pupils' health.   </content>
