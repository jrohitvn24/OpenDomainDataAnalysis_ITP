		<title>01THE ISLAND OF PAPA STRONSAY</title>
		<content> Papa Stronsay is a small island.      
 During most summers and some winters a
 family lives there. The familys only  
 source of power is two generators.    
 They look after their sheep. When they
 are not living there some men come    
 across every so often to check the    
 sheep. There are two derelict houses  
 of which one used to be a school      
 house. On Papa Stronsay there are two 
 piers and a light house. The island   
 has one nice beach. Before the war    
 during the herring season Papa        
 Stronsay was a busy community. Now the
 only thing that remains to show this  
 is am empty filleting station. There  
 is a light house on Papa Stronsay     
 which is maintained by people who go  
 out every so often to paint and       
 maintain it.
