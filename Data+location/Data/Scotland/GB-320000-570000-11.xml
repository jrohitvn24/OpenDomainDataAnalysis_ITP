		<title>11A farmworker's day in Creca</title>
		<content> My wife and I have lived in Creca     
 since we married over 28 years ago. We
 have two daughters who are now        
 married. A typical day starts at 7am  
 when I rise, have breakfast and read  
 the paper. A short walk takes me to   
 the farm to start at 8pm. As the farm 
 comprises mainly of beef-cattle and   
 sheep the first task is to check and  
 feed the animals which can take       
 anything up to two hours. After a     
 tea-break I bruise oats for feeding   
 the next day. I then clear out the    
 cattle sheds, and, as it is Autumn,   
 the sheep dipper. Once lunch is over I
 return to the farm and fix the hedge  
 cutter to the tractor in readiness for
 cutting. This done, I go to the field 
 and fence off a fresh strip of turnips
 for the sheep to feed on. Around 4pm I
 prepare the milk to feed the calves.  
 This done it is time to return home.  </content>
