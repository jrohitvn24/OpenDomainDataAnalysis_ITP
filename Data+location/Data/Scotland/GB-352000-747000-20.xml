		<title>20THE BLIND ARTIST</title>
		<content> Losing one sense,sight, Carolyn James 
 had to begin anew.Now she uses her    
 memory and her hearing.Her paintings  
 have been exhibited most recently in  
 Edinburgh and in Livingstone,near     
 Edinburgh.Her painting is more of a   
 career not a hobby.                   
  In her mind's eye she sees pictures  
 which she transfers onto paper,first  
 of all covering it with a wash,blue   
 for water and sky or green for meadows
 and trees.On this she paints details  
 as she imagines them using paints     
 arranged in a sequence which she      
 remembers;only once has she made a    
 mistake in which she painted the sky  
 brown!                                
  Carolyn also writes lyrics.On Sunday 
 16June,on ITV's Highway Moira Anderson
 will sing one of her ballads;Sir Harry
 Secombe,Dana and Ian Wallace are to   
 sing others on TV and record.         </content>
