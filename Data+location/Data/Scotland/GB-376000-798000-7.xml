		<title>07LOCAL HISTORY - DRUM CASTLE</title>
		<content> Drum Castle was in the possession of  
 one family, the Irvines, for 653 years
 until 1964 when the then laird        
 bequeathed it to the National Trust   
 for Scotland. Drum Park - from the    
 Gaelic 'druim' meaning a ridge - was  
 bestowed upon William de Irwin of     
 Woodhouse, by King Robert Bruce, for  
 his loyalty as secretary and armour   
 bearer. The Tower was built around    
 1286,strategically overlooking an     
 ancient drove road and the fords of   
 the River Dee.                        
 The Jacobean House,built in 1619 has  
 many family portraits,while the roof  
 of the Library is decorated by        
 heraldic shields of family connections
 of the wives. The Chapel contains a   
 silver figure of the Blessed Virgin   
 from Augsburg.                        
 The Castle opened to the public in    
 1976.                                 </content>
