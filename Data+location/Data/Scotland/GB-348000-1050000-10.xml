		<content> The day starts with the housewife     
 lighting the coal fire in the cooker  
 which also supplies the hot water.    
 Breakfast is then prepared and the    
 poultry fed while the menfolk attend  
 to the cattle and general farm work.  
     The housewife sets aside one day a
 week for washing and another for      
 baking, mainly Bere Bannocks floury   
 scones and cakes. The surplus is put  
 into the deepfreeze.                  
     Dinner at 1pm consists of soup,   
 main course and sweet, followed by tea
 or coffee. Some traditional courses   
 are Salt Pork and Cabbage, and Salt   
 Cuthes with melted butter or fat.     
     Tea is at 5.30pm and consists of a
 cooked dish followed by home baking.  
     The evenings are spent mending    
 clothes and knitting, supper is a cup 
 of tea and biscuits.
