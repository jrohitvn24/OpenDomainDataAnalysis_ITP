		<content>{Davidson's Mains}used to be a village 
 on the outskirts of Edinburgh but now 
 has been enclosed by the City's       
 growth.{Mr Gideon Whiteford,}93, is   
 one of its oldest residents and he    
 told us about its past.               
 Its nickname used to be{Muttonhole}as 
 sheep were brought there for          
 slaughter. At one time there were     
 5{dairies}in the village. The old     
{school}stood on the present school's  
 site.Classes averaged 40 pupils.      
{Roads}were made of chippings from the 
 local quarry packed down with earth.  
 The village had its own{station}and   
{trains}ran regularly into the city.   
 "Quality homes for quality people" was
 the slogan of{houses}built after 1900 
 giving Quality St.its name.{Buses}ran 
 to and from the city. The{railway line
 closed in the 50's. The village now is
 a busy{shopping}and{residential}area. </content>
