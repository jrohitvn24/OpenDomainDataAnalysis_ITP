		<title>07The Kylesku Ferries</title>
		<content>  July 1984 saw the end of a great     
 attraction at Kylesku, the Kylesku    
 Ferry. For more than 200 years some   
 sort of ferry service had been        
 provided.                             
  Till the early 1800s travel was by   
 horse and by foot over the rough      
 tracks made by drovers. At this stage 
 the ferry consisted of a rowing boat; 
 cattle and horses had to swim.        
  In the latter part of the 19th       
 century a six oared cobble with a     
 platform of turf was in use.          
  Later this type was replaced by a    
 cable operated steel barge with a hand
 winch which took four men to operate. 
  During the two World Wars the ferry  
 reverted to a rowing boat.            
  Various turntable vessels were used  
 until the last ferry, a large roll on 
 roll off ferry, came into operation in
 1977.                                 </content>
