		<title>08The Miners Strike: Dalkeith</title>
		<content> This is an account based on reports in
 the local newspaper, "The Advertiser".
 Many miners stay in Dalkeith and work 
 in the mining industry in nearby      
 Bilston Glen and Monktonhall pits.    
                                       
 The strike began in March 1984 and    
 local miners organised a rally in     
 Dalkeith. In June half the Dalkeith   
 strike committee were arrested during 
 a meeting. Picket line violence       
 escalated at Bilston Glen and         
 complaints were made by 33 miners who 
 were detained for 18 hours in police  
 cells in Dalkeith. In August Arthur   
 Scargill, President of the NUM        
 addressed a rally of 5,000 people in  
 Dalkeith. By march 1985 when the      
 strike ended 1,244 miners had drifted 
 back to Bilston Glen but only 632 had 
 resumed at Monktonhall.
