		<title>14HEALTH IN CUMBERNAULD</title>
		<content> My doctor's naame is Dr Kilpatrick. He
 works in the Health Centre at the Town
 Centre in Cumbernauld.{There are 4    
{health centres in our town}and all our
 doctors work in those except when a   
 new area is being built and then the  
 doctor's surgery is{in one of the new 
{houses}until a new health centre is   
 built. The health centres have        
 doctor's surgeries, dentist's         
 surgeries, treatment rooms, general   
 purpose rooms and at the town centre  
 there are x_ray facilities. There are 
 also clinics for things such as       
 expectant mothers and babies, to save 
 them travelling to hospital. If we    
 need to see the doctor we have to     
 phone the health centre and make an   
 appointment, often they are so busy   
 they can't see you that day. If you   
 are really unwell the dotor will come 
 to your home.                         </content>
