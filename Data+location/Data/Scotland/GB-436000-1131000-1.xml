		<title>01 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF NADINE</title>
		<content> I GET UP ABOUT QUARTER TO EIGHT AND   
 MOSTLY GET MY BREAKFAST MYSELF.I HAVE 
 FROSTIES,TOAST AND TEA.I GET MY       
 SCHOOLBAG AND CATCH THE BUS WHICH     
 USUALLY COMES AT NINE O'CLOCK.I TAKE A
 BUS BECAUSE I STAY AT BRIDGE END AND  
 OUR SCHOOL IS AT HAMNAVOE WHICH IS TWO
 MILES AWAY.                           
      ON MONDAYS I GET GYM, ON TUESDAYS
 ART AND I GET PIANO LESSONS. OTHER    
 THINGS AT SCHOOL ARE KNITTING AND     
 MUSIC.                                
      WE GO HOME FROM SCHOOL AT 3.30   
 P.M. THEN I CHANGE MY CLOTHES AND GO  
 OUT TO PLAY ON MY BIKE OR SIT IN AND  
 WATCH T.V. MY HOBBIES ARE PONIES,     
 READING AND GOING TO THE BROWNIES. AT 
 NIGHT I SOMETIMES FEED THE HENS AND   
 HELP DAD ROUND THE CROFT. AT TEN      
 O'CLOCK I GO TO BED AND SOMETIMES READ
 A BOOK.                               
                                       </content>
