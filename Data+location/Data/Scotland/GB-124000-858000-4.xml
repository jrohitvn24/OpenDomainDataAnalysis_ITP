		<content> At the turn of the century fishing was
 the main occupation in the area. It   
 gradually changed towards crofting.   
 Nowadays however very few of the      
 people are involved solely in         
 crofting. A few do still fish. Some   
 are also lobster fishermen. Most      
 people actually travel out of         
 Waternish daily  for their main       
 employment. Many families,however,do  
 keep sheep and a few keep cows and    
 goats. Very few families are          
 self-sufficient in milk. Most of the  
 milk consumed here is brought in from 
 either Inverness or Dingwall.         
 The people who have sheep and cattle  
 attend to them after work and at      
 week-ends.The Forestry Commission also
 give employment to a few. The         
 Commision moved in about twenty years 
 ago.
