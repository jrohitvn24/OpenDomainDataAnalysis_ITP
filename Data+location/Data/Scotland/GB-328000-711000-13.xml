		<content> 18% of the area is wooded. A small    
 proportion of this is for amenity     
 purposes and for windbreaks. The rest 
 is part of a 419 hectare Forestry     
 Commission plantation in the Ladybank 
 area. Most of the trees were planted  
 between 1923 and 1930. 80_90% of the  
 trees are Scots Pine, the rest are    
 Sitka Spruce, Norway Spruce and Larch.
 Some felling is now being carried out 
 and to avoid the impact on the        
 environment being too great, a        
 reaforestation programme is underway. 
 Felling of the original trees has been
 staggered and will continue until the 
 year 2010. Most of the timber is sent 
 to local sawmills with the smaller    
 pieces being used for chipboard or    
 pulping.                              
 The forestry commission are happy to  
 allow acess to the woodland by the    
 walking public ie. nature trails.     </content>
