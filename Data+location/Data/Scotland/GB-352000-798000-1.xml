		<title>01Introduction _ Aboyne Area</title>
		<content> The Aboyne Area is a mixture of the   
 village itself and rural surroundings.
 It presents the undulating Deeside    
 landscape and boasts wooded areas,    
 a loch and a stretch of the River Dee.
{Lifestyle}revolves around Aboyne      
 itself, a village of around 1690      
 inhabitants with a fine display of    
 amenities.                            
{Employment}is found in the village    
 but much of the local farming         
 population stay with farming for the  
 whole of their lives, although the    
 effects of the Aberdeen oil boom are  
 strongly felt.                        
 Local{events}concentrate on the       
 tourist trade, culminating in the     
 Highland Games.                       
 The actual{inhabitants}of the area are
 a mixed group.  The number of English 
 present a strong contrast to the more 
 established locals.                   </content>
