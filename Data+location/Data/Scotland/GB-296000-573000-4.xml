		<title>04Fashion in Dumfries</title>
		<content> People in Dumfries all have different 
 opinions about fashion in the town.   
    Some teenagers, girls and boys,    
 don't think there is any fashion in   
 Dumfries. Teenage girls like shops    
 such as{Chelsea Girl}and{Wrygges.}They
 like bright colours.Teenage boys shop 
 elsewhere. Although some like to shop 
 in{Burtons,}some boys like to get     
 their clothes from{Charity shops}and  
{Oxfam.                                
    Older women think that clothes are 
 badly made. They like{Marks and       
{Spencers, Binns, Barbours}and         
{Mothercare}for their children. They   
 think teenage girls and boys are      
 brightly dressed. Visitors in Dumfries
 think that everyone is smartly        
 dressed. Young men think clothes are  
 to expensive. Overall everyone thinks 
 that clothes are too expensive but the
 people dress well.                    </content>
