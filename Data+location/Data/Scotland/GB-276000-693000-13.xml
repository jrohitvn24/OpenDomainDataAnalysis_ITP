		<title>13The M9 Motorway  Stirling</title>
		<content> This is a main route for traffic going
 north and south quickly.  It is mainly
 used by cars, both private and        
 company.  As many as{ 400}can pass by 
 our area in half an hour, as many     
 going North as going south.  Mainly it
 is used by private cars at the weekend
 travelling quickly north to Perth,    
 Dundee or, perhaps in the other       
 direction, to{Glasgow}or{Edinburgh.   
 Cars can reach their destination much 
 quicker by using the M9.  Other       
 vehicles mainly using the M9 are      
 commercial lorries and vans some of   
 those are local, but most of the      
 lorries are long distance, carrying   
 goods of various descriptions.        
 Approximately 65% are Scottish        
 companies, 33% are English and a small
 percentage are Welsh or Irish.  Vans  
 tend to be local.
