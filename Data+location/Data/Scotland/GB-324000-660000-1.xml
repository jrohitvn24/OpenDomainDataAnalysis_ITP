		<title>01THE BLOCK BRIEFLY DESCRIBED</title>
		<content> This block is mainly a combination of 
 housing and farmland.  The eastern    
 third of the block contains mostly    
 housing and in the remaining two      
 thirds farm land predominates while   
 being interspersed with stretches of  
 mainly deciduous trees. The river     
{North Esk}wends its way through the   
 block from the south west to the north
 east and is the main geographical     
 feature of the area.  The block       
 contains the villages of{Auchendinny} 
 and{Milton Bridge,}both closely       
 linked with{Penicuik,}and the housing 
 estates to the eastern side of        
{Penicuik.} Perhaps the dominant       
 feature as far as buildings are       
 concerned is{Glencorse Barracks and  }
{Training Camp}in the north east of the
 block  The town of{Penicuik}(pop.     
 20,000+) has mushroomed around the old
{Penicuik village.}                    </content>
