 HAD                                   
 QUITE A FEW CHANGES, ONE OF WHICH IS  
 THE BUILDING OF MORE HOUSES. SHOPS    
 HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER BY NEW PEOPLE.   
 THE MAIN ROAD HAS BECOME A LOT BUSIER.
 THERE ARE FEWER BUSES GOING THROUGH   
 THE VILLAGE AND MORE PEOPLE OWN AND   
 USE CARS. THE POPULATION OF DUNLOP HAS
 GROWN.                                
  THE PETROL STATION HAS BEEN KNOCKED  
 DOWN AND HOUSES HAVE BEEN BUILT THERE.
 IN 1982 MR.ROBINSON RETIRED AS        
 HEADMASTER AND MRS.CUNNINGHAM WAS     
 APPOINTED. MRS.CUNNINGHAM MADE A LOT  
 OF CHANGES IN THE SCHOOL.

 YOUNGSTERS, LIKE THE YOUTH CLUB,      
 UNIFORMED GROUP AND GYMNASTICS.AT THE 
 SAME TIME THERE ARE FEW JOB           
 OPPORTUNITIES FOR SCHOOL LEAVERS.
