		<title>14INDUSTRY FORRES WEST</title>
		<content> In the west of Forres there is a whole
 range of different industries,        
 consisting of commercial and          
 industrial manufacturing.  In the     
 commercial sector there are different 
 kinds of work eg. shops, ranging from 
 small sweet shops to big clothes      
 stores.  There are also distributing  
 depots and warehouses, like White's   
 Removal Company and Tarmac            
 Construction is a big civil           
 engineering group.                    
 There are lots of factories at        
 Greshop, which is on the Western      
 outskirts of Forres.  There are       
 agricultural suppliers, wood          
 merchants, some garages and a big     
 dairy which serves most of Forres.    
 Forres hasn't got a lot of industries,
 but we think it has enough.
