 The 12 square kilometres of our study 
 is a rural area to the South East of  
 the ancient historical  town of St    
 Andrews.  The land is fairly flat and 
 arable.  Crops are varied, comprising 
 mainly barley and in addition turnips,
 wheat, potatoes, oil seed rape, peas, 
 etc. Apart from the tenanted Kingsmuir
 Estate all the farms are owned by the 
 farmers. Several houses scattered in  
 the area are not part of farming.     
 There is a school, church and items of
 archeological interest. The main road 
 from St. Andrews to Anstruther A959   
 almost bisects Dunino Parish which has
 survived, probably for wealth and     
 historical reasons, in spite of it    
 being surrounded by much larger       
 Parishes. Dunino appears to mean      
 fortified fort (Dun) by the           
 stream(Ino) Population 110 adults.    </content>
