 Our block includes our school and the 
 village of Hilton.Most of the children
 in our school come from Balintore     
 which also has most of the shops.There
 is only one shop in Hilton.Most of our
 block is farmland.It is very good     
 fertile land growing peas,potatoes,   
 oil seed rape,oats,wheat,barley and   
 spring barley.A crop introduced within
 the past  two years is oil seed rape  
 and this year sees the introduction of
 deer being reared on Balintore Farm.  
   Basic industries are Farming,working
 at the Highland Fabrication yard at   
 Nigg,steel fabrication at Balmuchy and
 fishing.The later two industries show 
  the area has changed.Salmon fishing  
 until a few years ago was the main    
 industry in Hilton. The season started
 in mid February and lasted till Sept. </content>
