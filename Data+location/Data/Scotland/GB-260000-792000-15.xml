		<title>15Talk of Laggan.</title>
		<content> It is now quite some time since Laggan
 was bi-lingual i.e.speaking English &amp; 
 Gaelic.Everyone now communicates the  
 spoken and written word in English.Due
 to economic restraints,Gaelic has not 
 been taught in the village school for 
 10 years, but is still encouraged and 
 taught in Kingussie High School.The   
 last Gaelic speaking resident died in 
 1979.There is no dialect as such but  
 conversation contains local phrases   
 "my hands are starved"-"my hands are  
 cold" or-"what gutters!"-"what a lot  
 of mud!"Occasional Gaelic words will  
 always prevail-----"Oichde mhath"     
 "Good-night"
