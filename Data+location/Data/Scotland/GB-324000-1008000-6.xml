		<title>06MR STEER'S LOBSTER POND</title>
		<content> At Mr Steer's Lobster Pond ,he usually
 gets in about 900 lobsters, which     
 weigh around 1500lb,in a week.Many are
 caught in the Sanday Sound.The        
 heaviest lobster ever was 9 and a half
 lb. In the pond they can usually put  
 3500 lobsters at one time.In          
 summer they're kept for ten days ,when
 they get nothing to eat,but they get  
 fishheads for their 2 months winter   
 stay.A lobster costs between Â£6&amp;Â£12.  
 Lobsters are sent to Billingsgate,    
 London,and even abroad to Hamburg,    
 Germany.Weak or unsold lobsters are   
 frozen.3 men are employed at the pond 
 in the summer &amp; they work every day   
 bar Sunday.Mr Steer never gets bored  
 at his work,but his wife doesn't enjoy
 him coming home with a smell of       
 lobsters.
