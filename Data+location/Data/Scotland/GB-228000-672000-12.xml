		<title>12WORK IN PORT GLASGOW</title>
		<content>{Port Glasgow}has a population of      
 approx 22,000. Traditionally the men  
 depended heavily on shipbuilding for  
 employment and in particular on the { 
{Scott Lithgow} complex.  Despite      
 massive redundancies recently marine  
 engineering is still the most         
 important local source of employment. 
 Partly as a result of these           
 redundancies male unemployment in Port
 Glasgow now runs at about 20%         
 Some Port Glaswegians work in         
 electronics firms in Greenock like IBM
 and National Semiconductors, the      
 latter of which has also experienced  
 recent redundancies. Much of the      
 factory space in Port Glasow's post   
 war{industrial estate}now lies unused.
 It seems easier for women to find work
 in Port Glasgow (shops, offices etc)  
 although much of it is part time and  
 poorly paid.                          </content>
