		<content> A summer Barbecue has become an annual
 event at Pulteneytown Academy Primary 
 School.This is run by the Parent      
 Teachers' Association and each year   
 has a different theme.When it took    
 place in June 1985 we had a Spanish   
 theme and pupils were encouraged to   
 dress up.Before the main attraction of
 the day parents and children paraded  
 to show off their costumes.Then came  
 the highlight,the arrival of the      
 matador and bull.The pantomime was    
 certainly enjoyed by young and old as 
 the bull showed its dislike of having 
 its tail pulled.This was followed by  
 five team games,with each team        
 consisting of two adults and five     
 children.Around the playground were   
 various stalls.Many children had a    
 photograph taken with the bull and the
 afternoon's events were all recorded  
 on video.                             </content>
