 In{1908}the family of Mr Rae,who still
 lives in the village took over the{   
{bakery}in a garage.Four people worked 
 there baking bread,scones and cakes to
 be delivered to local shops and houses
 and round the country by van.Flour    
 bought in Glasgow was baked in{Scotch 
{ovens,}12 feet by 10 feet.Loaves were 
 shaped and greased together before    
 baking.No tins were used.A 4lb        
 loaf,cut into 2 was sold for 3 pence  
 for each piece.When Mr Rae retired in{
{1969}the bakery closed.{Now}local     
 shops buy bread from Ayr,Stranraer and
 Glasgow.A van makes a delivery about  
 5.30am each morning.{The local grocer 
 feels that bread baked locally was    
 fresher than that delivered today.
