		<content> During the winter months aerobics and 
 keep fit classes are held in the town 
 hall. Community education classes are 
 held in the local secondary and       
 primary schools in a variety of topics
 and hobbies. For the youth in the     
 community there are voluntary         
 organisations such as Scouts and      
 Guides. There is also a majorettes    
 group and a Maybole Pipe Band.        
 The town has a number of public houses
 which also provide social facilities  
 such as darts teams playing in a local
 league. There is a local rugby club   
 and junior football teams. Local      
 churches also provide clubs and social
 gatherings for their members.
