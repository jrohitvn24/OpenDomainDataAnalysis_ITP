		<content>{TRANENT DISTRICT COUNCIL'S }aim is to 
 make the town a better place to live  
 in.The by-pass will reduce traffic    
 volume and shopkeepers are being      
 encouraged to up-grade their property 
 now that there will be less fumes and 
 noise.{WEST WINDYGOUL}- The council   
 own land here and application has been
 made for purchase by Castlerock       
 Housing Association to build 38       
 sheltered houses and by Edinvar for 32
 houses for handicapped or single      
 persons.There is also proposals for a 
 new primary school but with falling   
 roles in schools this may not         
 materialise.{HIGH STREET }- New       
 hypermarket to be built by East       
 Lothian Co-op.The location of the car 
 park is under discussion.             
 There are also plans to pedestrianise 
 the main shopping area but again lack 
 of funding restricts development.     </content>
