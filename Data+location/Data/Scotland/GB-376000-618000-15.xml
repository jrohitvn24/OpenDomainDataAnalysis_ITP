		<title>15A DAY IN MY LIFE AT HOWNAM</title>
		<content> I am a 16-year old schoolgirl.I live  
 on a farm near Hownam in the Scottish 
 Borders with my parents and 3 younger 
 sisters.Through the week I get up at  
 6.45a.m. and go out to put my horse   
 into the field. At 7:15 I have my     
 breakfast and leave for school at 8   
 o'clock.The bus arrives around 10 past
 and I get to Kelso High School at 20  
 to 9. School starts at 8:55 and       
 finishes at 3:45.  I have a morning   
 break and buy my lunch at the school  
 cafeteria.My timetable consists of    
 mathematics,english,geography,biology 
 and accountancy. I arrive home at 20  
 past 4 and I have my evening meal at  
 5. After that I catch my horse and    
 take him for a ride which lasts about 
 an hour,and then I stable him for the 
 night.I next do any home work that I  
 have, and then watch television or    
 read until its time for bed.          </content>
