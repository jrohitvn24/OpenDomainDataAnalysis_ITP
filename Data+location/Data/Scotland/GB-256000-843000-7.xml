		<content>  A popular landmark is Bogroy Inn     
 which has been closely associated with
 smugglers in the not so distant past. 
 Until the end of the 19th century     
 illicit whisky distilling appears to  
 have been fairly prevalent in the     
 Inverness district. As long as the    
 smuggler evaded the detection from    
 customs officers, whisky making was   
 quite profitable. A quarter of barley 
 cost about a pound to purchase but    
 many of these clandestine distilleries
 grew their own crops. From a quarter  
 of grain they obtained about 50       
 gallons of whisky. It sold at 18      
 shillings a gallon ,a considerable    
 difference from present day rates. Of 
 course the whisky was drunk by the    
 community themselves which lead to a  
 considerable amount of squalor and    
 drunkeness.                           
                                       </content>
