		<title>04BO'NESS CUBS</title>
		<content> I am in the Cubs and I like them. We  
 always meet on a Monday at 6.45pm. Our
 leaders are Baloo, Akela and Bagera.  
 They all respond to the Jungle Book.  
 Baloo is the bear, Akela is the wolf  
 and Bagera is the panther. We have    
 about 36 cubs altogether. Our number  
 is the Third Bo'ness but we are the   
 only cubs in Bo'ness. We play games   
 when all the cubs form a circle and   
 are each given a letter C.U.B.S. which
 stands for cubs. We put a bean bag in 
 the middle of the circle. Then Akela  
 shouts C. Then everybody with the     
 letter C runs round once and grabs the
 bean bag. I like learning things that 
 would help me sometimes. We are       
 trained in tracking things down as    
 well. I like going to the cubs.
