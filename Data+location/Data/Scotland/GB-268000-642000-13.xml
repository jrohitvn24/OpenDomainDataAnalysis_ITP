		<title>13ENTERTAINMENT</title>
		<content> From a survey we found that tastes in 
 entertainment varied between age      
 groups.Teenagers liked discos and pop 
 music while people over fifty tended  
 to orefer the theatre and classical   
 music-ballroom dancing and music      
 recitals were mentioned.Many people go
 outside of Strathaven to Glasgow,East 
 Kilbride or Hamilton for              
 entertainment.Many people thought that
 a cinema was badly needed in          
 Strathaven especially for young       
 folk(the last one was not             
 profitable),Teenagers also mentioned  
 a discotheque to give them something  
 to do.Money is being raised for a     
 swimming pool beside the Sports       
 Centre.The old Town Mill has been used
 as a local theatre for some time now  
 for both professional and amateur     
 productions.Nearby towns provide a    
 wide range of entertainment.          </content>
