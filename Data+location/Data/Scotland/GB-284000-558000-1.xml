		<content> The area is bounded by hills to he    
 North and East, forest to he west ad a
 valley runs south towards the shore.  
 Most of the land is ued for the rough 
 grazing of sheep, although there is a 
 small amount of arable land in the    
 valley. The forest takes up 3 km at   
 present this is run by the forstry    
 commission.                           
 Most of the people who live here,     
 around 20 either work on farms or are 
 still at school. Some people, travel  
 from Dalbeattie to ork at a regional  
 rubbish dump. This dump takes up      
 around 1/4 of km this is built on an  
 area of bog locally known as the mass.
