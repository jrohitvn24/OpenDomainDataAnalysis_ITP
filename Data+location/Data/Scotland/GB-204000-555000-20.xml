		<content>  Situated only 4km from the town of   
 Stranraer, the village of Lochans     
 obtains most of its services from     
 there including shopping, secondary   
 education, medical treatment, most    
 employment and even petrol.           
  The list of amenities in Lochans is  
 therefore very small and includes:_

{General  Store

{Public Hall                           
{Pub                                   
{Playing Field with soccer pitch       
{Sewage Works                          
                                       
  The village is also served by the    
 Stranraer - Portpatrick bus service.2 
 services per day in each direction.
