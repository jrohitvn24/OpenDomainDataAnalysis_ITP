		<title>17CHIRNSIDE CIVIC WEEK</title>
		<content> There is a treasure hunt, which is    
 very popular, bowling, discos which   
 are always a success, and a grand     
 concert which attracts a full house.  
 Each year during the week there is a  
 penalty-kick competition for juniors  
 and seniors, and for the first time,  
 this year a girl won the senior       
 penalty-kick competition.             
 The torchlight procession draws people
 from all around. To round off the     
 festivities a Gala Dance is held for  
 the whole community on Saturday night.
 A raffle is held there with a prize of
 Â£100.                                 
 So ends the highly successful and     
 increasingly popular Civic Week.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
