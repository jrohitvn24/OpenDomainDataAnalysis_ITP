		<title>05Colvend: Education</title>
		<content>   There is one school in Colvend. We  
 have ten pupils. Three of them live in
 Kippford,one in Southwick and the rest
 live in Colvend or Rockcliffe.        
   The school was built in 1875. It has
 one classroom and a cloakroom.There   
 are two toilets (outside!) for boys   
 and two for girls. Six of us are boys 
 and the rest are girls. We also have  
 four gerbils as pets. We have a radio,
 a film projector,a television and a   
 computer.                             
   Our teacher is Miss McDonald. We    
 have a cleaner and a lady who comes in
 to serve the dinners. Dinners are sent
 from Castle Douglas,which is about 12 
 miles away.On Wednesdays we go to St. 
 Peter's school in Dalbeattie for      
 physical education. On Thursdays Mrs. 
 Wallach,our music teacher comes.
