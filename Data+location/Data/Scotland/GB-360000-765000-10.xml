		<content>    My name is Sean Burke. I like      
 coming to school because it is not a  
 big school and there are a lot of     
 games to play including computer games
 We have a list so that everyone has   
 the same chance at the computers.     
    We get lots of visitors. Mr Smith  
 gives us Art on Mondays. Mrs Smith    
 comes on Tuesday for P.E. and Mr      
 Taylor is the vicar. We also have     
 Police Videos to instruct us in Road  
 Safety.                               
    The best thing about school,       
 however are the dinners. My favourites
 are Macaroni, Pizza and Spaghetti ....
 oh, and milk pudding.                 
    I come from Lichfield and my dad is
 a Marine Commando at Condor Base near 
 Arbroath.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
