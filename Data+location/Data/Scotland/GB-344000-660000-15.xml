 IN HUMBIE WE HAVE A CHILDRENS VILLAGE 
 WITH LOTS OF LITTLE HOUSES GROUPED    
 TOGETHER.IT IS A SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN  
 WHO ARE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED.SOME     
 CHILDREN GO EVERY DAY WHILE OTHERS    
 LIVE THERE.GROWN UPS AT THE CHILDRENS 
 VILLAGE TEACH AND LOOK AFTER THE      
 CHILDREN THERE.IT USED TO BE A HOLIDAY
 PLACE FOR POOR CHILDREN FROM          
 EDINBURGH.THEY CAME TO LIVE THERE FOR 
 A FEW WEEKS AND CAME TO OUR SCHOOL.WE 
 HAVE A BOOK WITH THE NAMES OF ALL THE 
 CHILDREN AND THE SCHOOLS THEY CAME    
 FROM.IT WAS BOUGHT BY A RELIGIOUS     
 GROUP SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHO WANTED TO 
 RUN A SCHOOL FOR MONGOL CHILDREN.SOME 
 OF THOSE FIRST CHILDREN HAVE LIVED    
 THERE EVER SINCE AND ARE NOW ADULTS.
