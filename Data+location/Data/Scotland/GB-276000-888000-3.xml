		<content>{CROPS:}The main crop grown in our area
 is barley. Other crops grown locally  
 are wheat, oats, potatoes, turnips and
 grass. Crops like protein peas and oil
 seed rape have been grown as new crops
 to this area.                         
{LIVESTOCK:}The main animals are sheep 
 and cattle. The most common breeds of 
 sheep are cheviot or greyface crosses.
 The cattle are a mixture ranging from 
 Aberdeen Angus to the Fresian Hereford
 cross. The cattle and sheep go to the 
 markets in Rogart, Lairg and Dingwall 
 to be sold.                           
{LAND:}The ground in our block is well 
 drained apart from the areas below sea
 level. The cultivated areas near the  
 sea have soft and sandy soils. Common 
 grazing on the Links is available to  
 the tennants of Littletown. For a fee 
 they can graze a tethered horse, a cow
 and a calf on the Dornoch Links.      </content>
