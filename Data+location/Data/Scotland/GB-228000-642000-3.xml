		<title>03FARMLAND IN KILWINNING</title>
		<content> Farmland surrounds much of the        
 town.Originally woodland but now      
 grassland which has been divided      
 into small farms.The land to the      
 west is poor while the best pastures  
 for providing sufficient grazing are  
 to the north,east,and south-east.Dairy
 farming predominates.A typical farm   
 is Castle Farm owned by Mr.Reid.He has
 fifty Friesian cows,a sheep dog and   
 hens.He works hard looking after the  
 land,maintaining two ancient tractors,
 and keeping his fences in good order. 
 Like many farms in the area his farm  
 is small,only fourteen acres,but his  
 farmhouse is large,attractive and     
 in good order.
