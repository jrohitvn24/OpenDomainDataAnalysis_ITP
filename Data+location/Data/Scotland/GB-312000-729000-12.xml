 Guildtown for recreation.             
                                       
 There is a local Football team called 
 Guildtown. They train in the Playing  
 Field and anyone over age ten can go. 
                                       
 In the Inn two Darts Teams meet and   
 practise. They are called Angler's    
 Rest and Guildtown.                   
                                       
 There is also a Pool table in the Inn.
                                       
 In the Village Hall you can play      
 Badminton and attend a Keep Fit Class.
                                       
                                       
 There are no other facilities         
 available.
