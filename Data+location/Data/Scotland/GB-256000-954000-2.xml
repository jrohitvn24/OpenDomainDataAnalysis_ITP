		<title>02Policing in Tongue</title>
		<content> Tongue has a {Police Station }and     
 house built less than ten years ago   
 which is manned by one officer. He has
 a beat stretching about twenty miles  
 east, west and south, and he is respon
 sible to superior officers in Thurso. 
 He has to deal with all police duties 
 e.g. {road traffic,crimes, poaching,  
{licensing laws, sudden deaths, school 
{liaison &amp; road safety, sheep          
{dippings,and offences against birds of
{prey,stealing of eggs etc. The most   
{common offences are road traffic and  
{poaching deer and salmon.             
 The officer in a small station has to 
 be prepared to be called out even when
 he is officially off duty; and he may 
 have to extend his beat if a          
 neighbouring station is unmanned.
