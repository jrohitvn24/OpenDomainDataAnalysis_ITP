		<title>17Presto's of Dumfries</title>
		<content> The person we interviewed was         
 Mr.Simson who was very kind to give us
 his time. He said that the spot was a 
 very good spot to build Presto's. He  
 also said that Presto's usd to be     
 across the street. The manager was    
 Mr.Ross but we did not see him.       
 Mr.Simson said that they got about    
 13-14000 shoppers a week, and he      
 employs about 150 people.             
    We asked Mr.Simson if they got good
 support from the council. He said yes.
 We also asked if they got on with the 
 other stores around them. He said yes.
 He also said they get more trade in   
 the summer because of all the         
 tourists. They send away for food a   
 week in advance. The building was     
 built in 1981-82. It is the third     
 biggest market chain in Britain. The  
 two other shops are Fine Fare and     
 Sainsbury's.                          </content>
