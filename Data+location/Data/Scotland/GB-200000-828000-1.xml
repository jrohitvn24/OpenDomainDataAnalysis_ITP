		<content> Carnach consists of one house and     
 outbuilding and a derelict small      
 shooting lodge.  About a mile further 
 along the road east is Duilleach which
 also has one house and outbuilding.   
 Both in a state of disrepair.         
                                       
 Behind these houses rise the mountains
 covered with heather, bracken and     
 rough grazing.  Red and roe deer,     
 sheep and highland cattle graze here. 
 Buzzard and Golden Eagle can be seen. 
                                       
 There are a few small hill lochs      
 where brown trout breed.  They are    
 also found in the river Elchaig which 
 lies to the south east.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
