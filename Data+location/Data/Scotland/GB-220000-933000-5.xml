		<content>  This area is of world wide interest  
 to geologists. Some of the oldest rock
 in Britain is found here, rock so old 
 that no fossils are found in it.      
 Younger rock has been found under this
 older rock _ this has been caused by  
 upthrusting and folding, "The Moine   
 Thrust".                              
  Many diffferent species of birds can 
 be seen. Terns plunge from the air on 
 the shoals of mackerel in the loch,   
 watched by the cormorants. On a narrow
 ledge on one of the cliffs is a       
 heronry. Oyster_catchers and gulls add
 their noise to the scene. On land pied
 wagtails are the first signs of spring
 joining the tits and finches which    
 have been looked after all winter.    
 Later the cuckoo and the summmer birds
 arrive. The buzzard is the largest    
 bird of prey seen in our area, though 
 eagles are found far up the glens.    </content>
