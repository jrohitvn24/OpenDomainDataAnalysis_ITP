		<content> It sits on top of its mound of earth  
 and only on close inspection do you   
 notice the damp riddled walls, the    
 cracked stone, the smashed windows,   
 etc.,etc.                             
                                       
    The history of this house, built in
 honey coloured Cumberland sandstone   
 is interspersed with the royal and    
 ducal families from the not so        
 disatant past.  From 1812 until       
 approximately 1930 the house was owned
 by the dukes of Buccleuch and         
 Queensberry and then in that decade   
 the house was sold to a member of the 
 Brooks family.This family who had     
 played a large part in World War I    
 were very friendly with the then Duke 
 of Gloucester and it was while he was 
 hunting with Colonel Brook that he was
 supposed to have been told about his  
 uncles (George VI) failing health.    </content>
