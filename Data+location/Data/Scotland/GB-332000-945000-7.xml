		<content> I am an eleven year old girl. I wake  
 at 10.00hrs. wash and dress,usually in
 jeans and T-shirt and go to the       
 kitchen and make a coffee. I return to
 my bedroom and listen to records. My  
 favourite groups are U.B.40 and Slade.
 About 11.00hrs. I put on my coat and  
 visit my friend next door. Sometimes  
 we sit on the porch and talk or cycle 
 till lunchtime when I usually have a  
 yoghurt. After lunch I wash and dry my
 hair and listen to records or watch   
 T.V. Then I go out to play again. At  
 17.50hrs. I go home for dinner which  
 might be pie and chips.               
 Then I wash and change into my good   
 jeans and jacket and go to the Sports 
 Club. Sometimes I play darts,ping-pong
 or pool or talk to my friends.        
 I return home by 23.00hrs. and have a 
 coffee before going to bed.
