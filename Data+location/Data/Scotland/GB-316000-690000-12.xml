		<content>   There are 5 banks in Cowdenbeath    
 High Street: Girobank, TSB , Royal    
 Bank of Scotland (2) and the Bank of  
 Scotland; 3 of which have cashlines.  
 There are also 6 building societies   
 giving Cowdenbeath 11 banking         
 facilities in a space of half a mile. 
   Since people have become very money 
 conscious, there has been a massive   
 increase in banking customers,        
 Cashlines are expecially popular, and 
 causes few problems.  These cashline  
 services bring a lot of business to   
 the banks which are making a          
 considerable profit in this area.     
 Building Societies have not introduced
 cashlines, but do have better opening 
 hours. The building societies do not  
 rely as heavily on computers as the   
 banks do, although the Girobank does  
 not have a computer.
