		<content>                                       
 There are many{skipping rhymes}that   
 are sung but maybe the most popular is
{"POLLY IN THE KITCHEN".}This can be   
 played with five or more people and a 
 long rope.Two people hold the ends of 
 the rope and swing it round as normal 
 then one person starts to skip and the
 rest sing{"Polly in the kitchen,doing 
{a bit o'stitching.In pops a bogey man 
{and out jumps she!"}At the words "In  
 comes a bogey man" another person     
 jumps in and Polly jumps out.This     
 carries on until you want to change.  
  The simplest game is {"SCALES".}The  
 first person goes right under the rope
 without jumping everyone follows her  
 doing the same,when it comes round to 
 the first persons turn again she jumps
 once,the game carries on like this    
 till ten  is reached,then you work    
 your way down to one.                 </content>
