		<title>11Local History in Barrhead</title>
		<content>  Many of our local{place names}are    
 Celtic in origin.  The most common are
 Auchenback - field on the moor        
 Craig - rock                          
 Levern - Noisy water                  
 Ars (now known as Aurs) - shallow     
 stream                                
  The only{ancient monument}is Arthur's
 Cross, a stone cross with Celtic      
 markings and designs.  It is named    
 after a knight who lived many         
 centuries ago.                        
  A{holy well}at Chappell was the site 
 of a religious settlement founded by  
 St. Conval in the sixth century.  It  
 is still in evident today.            
  The town has developed from many     
{little villages}which eventually      
 joined together in 1750.  The names of
 these original villages - Dealston,   
 Grahamston and Gateside are still in  
 use today.                            </content>
