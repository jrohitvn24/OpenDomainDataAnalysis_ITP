 The area is situated in the east coast
 of Scotland.The land is mainly used   
 for farming and there are many small  
 farms dotted around.There is a picnic 
 area in Killrenny common.In Kilrenny  
 there is an old church which dates    
 back to 1634.This was built by        
 St.Adrian. There are no shops.In 1926 
 two bronze age cists were found near  
 Caiple.There is a small area of       
 sea.This is the Firth of Forth.there  
 are not many inhabitants.The only     
 industry is farming although there    
 used to be a quarry but it has        
 been closed down.Alsothere used to be 
 a railway line open which took people 
 to Waid Academy (nearby school).It was
 closed down when the car became       
 popular.This area is not very         
 exciting.But there are some           
 historical places to visit.           </content>
