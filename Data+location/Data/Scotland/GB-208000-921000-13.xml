		<title>13THE LAST GREAT WILDERNESS?</title>
		<content> People came to Assynt &amp; Lochinver     
 because they were "cleared" by their  
 Landlords to make way for sheep. These
 people built shops first. The first   
 house in Lochinver is now the Doctor's
 surgery. Culag House (now a Hotel) was
 built by the Duke of Sutherland in    
 1870. It was rebuilt after a fire in  
 1929 by the Vesty family. The Church  
 is unique because it was dismantled &amp; 
 bought stone by stone by boat from    
 Nairn, &amp; rebuilt in Lochinver. It is  
 being re-roofed this year. Assynt &amp;   
 Lochinver is more famous for it's wild
 &amp; rugged landscape. Famous mountains  
 like Suilven, Canisp, Quinag, &amp; Stac  
 Polleidh, can all be viewed to        
 advantage from here. Our area has been
 described as "the last great widerness
 in Europe", a description that cannot 
 be bettered.
