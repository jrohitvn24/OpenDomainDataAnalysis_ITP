		<content> In a survey of second year pupils     
 about their political opinions we     
 received a variety of replies.        
 40% supported the CONSERVATIVE PARTY  
 30% supported the LABOUR PARTY ,10%   
 supported the ECOLOGY PARTY and 20%   
 were uncommitted.                     
        The local M.P. is              
 M.Miller(LABOUR),the Regional         
 Councillor is P.Waters(LABOUR),the    
 District Councillors are R.Cameron and
 A.Chalmers(both                       
 CONSERVATIVE).Generally speaking the  
 majority of voters in the town vote   
 CONSERATIVE while in the area around  
 Strathaven e.g. East Kilbride they    
 vote LABOUR.The survey therefore shows
 a similar pattern to those of adults  
 in the town so it looks as if the 1990
 elections will have the same results  
 as the last ones__perhaps someone     
 would care to check our prediction?   </content>
