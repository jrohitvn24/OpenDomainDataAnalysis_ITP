 Hawick is a town roughly 80 km        
 south-west of Edinburgh.   Its        
 population is approx. 16,000 and it   
 has two main rivers, the Teviot and   
 the Slitrig.   The main industry in   
 Hawick is knitwear, for which the town
 is famous, all over the world. The    
 town also has a unique sweet, the     
 "Hawick Ball".                        
                                       
 There are many sheep around Hawick    
 but nowadays their wool is not used in
 the local knitwear factories.   Most  
 of the cattle round Hawick are beef   
 cattle, not suitable for milking.     
                                       
 Wilton Lodge Park, with lots of       
 amusements, such as crazy golf,       
 putting,trampolining, six rugby       
 pitches, two bowling greens, etc. is  
 another special feature of Hawick.    </content>
