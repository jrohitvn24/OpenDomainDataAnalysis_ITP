		<content> There are about 10 people who live in 
 Kirkpatrick Durham who are members of 
 the CND. They are trying to end       
 nuclear weapons in Britain and all    
 over the world. They hope the world   
 will come to its senses and scrap the 
 nuclear weapons.                      
 At Greenham Common there are appalling
 conditions. In the winter the         
 people that were there nearly         
 died. The activities that they take   
 part in are wire cutting, singing,    
 talking, chanting and barrackading the
 gates with people or wire.            
 The rest of the people in the village 
 think it is a waste of time and       
 they won't get anywhere by protesting 
 against it. Most people don't like    
 nuclear weapons, but they think they  
 are a necessary evil.
