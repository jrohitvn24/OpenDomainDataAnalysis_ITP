		<content> Quarring :Planning considerations.    
 Land for quarring can be either       
 rented from the farmer or in some     
 cases bought outright from him.The    
 land at Kinloch Quarry is rented.     
 Legislation governs the quarrying     
 operation and environmental disruption
 is kept to a minimum. A belt of trees 
 runs along the quarry perimeters to   
 reduce the visual impact of the       
 proposed excavations. Top soil is     
 removed and stored ready to be        
 replaced later. Depth of working is   
 limited to the level of the water     
 table (down to a depth of two metres) 
 and must not be lower than that of the
 nearby road. Once the sand and gravel 
 has been removed, then the land is    
 refurbished to requirements and       
 farming will again take place on these
 quarry sites.
