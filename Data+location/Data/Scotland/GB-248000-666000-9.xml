		<content> Here are two local games.             
{RECORDS}_ This is based on football.  
 One player is in goal. Every one else 
 is outfield. The keeper kicks the ball
 out and and someone must pass the ball
 to a second player. A goal can only be
 scored by a volley or a header. If a  
 player scores then he becomes keeper. 
 If he misses, the keeper then takes a 
 penalty against him and if a goal is  
 scored he stays keeper if not he      
 returns outfield.The object of the    
 game is to get the{record}number of   
 goals against one keeper. When the    
 keeper changes the game begins again. 
{CHINKS}_ This is played by girls.     
 Elastic bands are tied together. Two  
 people hold the ends while the rest   
 jump over. The height of the rope     
 increases. If a player does not       
 succeed in clearing the rope it       
 becomes her turn to hold an end.      </content>
