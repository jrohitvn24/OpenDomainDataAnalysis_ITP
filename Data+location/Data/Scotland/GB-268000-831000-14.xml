		<content>  Millions of years ago during the ice 
 age the glaciers in our area carried a
 lot of rocks along with them.The large
 rocks left behind can still be seen on
 the school moor                       
   The strath was once covered with    
 forest but over the centuries people  
 started to clear away the trees for   
 their settlements.Some of these people
 set up the stone circles still around 
 today.                                
 Many of the kings and lairds hunted in
 the remaning forests for deer or wild 
 boar.More recently rich land owners   
 who spent a lot of their time in the  
 city let the farmland turn into moor  
 covered with heather for the grouse.  
  Now farmers grow crops and keep cows 
 on fertile land around the river and  
 sheep on moorland and hills.Forestry  
 companies are planting many hills with
 conifers.Sportsmen still shoot game.  </content>
