		<title>16Airlie Monument,Cortachy</title>
		<content>  Above the winding glen of Prosen,high
 on Tulloch Hill,towers the{Airlie     
{Monument.}It was erected in{1901}in   
 memory of the{9th Earl of Airlie}who  
 was tragically killed at the{Battle of
{Diamond Hill}on the 11th of June 1900,
 during the{Boer War.}A rough track    
 winds its way through the wooded hill 
 up to the monument.A hedge of         
 cotoneaster surrounds the base and    
 a few steps lead up to the door.Once  
 inside it is very dark as the windows 
 had to be boarded up because of van-  
 dals.A steep spiral staircase leads up
 to a small room with narrow windows   
 and continues upwards to a balcony on 
 top of the monument, from which there 
 is a beautiful view. On the balcony is
 a brazier which is one of a chain,lit 
 in succession throughout the country, 
 on the occasion of{Prince Charles's } 
 marriage to{Lady Diana Spencer.}      </content>
