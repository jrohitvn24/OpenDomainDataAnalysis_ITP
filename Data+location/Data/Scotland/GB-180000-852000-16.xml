		<title>16THE ROCKS OF SHIELDAIG</title>
		<content>    MUCH OF LAND AROUND SHIELDAIG IS   
 ROCKY.THE MOUNTAINS ARE TORRIDONIAN   
 SANDSTONE.   THEY WERE ONCE UNDER THE 
 SEA, BUT HAVE RISEN UP TO FORM LAND.  
 THE LAND WAS THEN WORN AWAY BY        
 GLACIERS.   THE ROCKS OF THIS TYPE ARE
 CALLED SEDEMENTARY ROCKS.             
    THE POINT BEYOND THE SCHOOL IS     
 CALLED CAMAS-RUADH.   THIS LAND IS    
 ROUGH AND ROCKS.   UNDER THE SURFACE  
 IS LEWISIAN GNEISS.   THIS IS SOME OF 
 THE OLDEST ROCK IN NORTHERN EUROPE.   
    THE BEACHES ARE ROCKY, WITH MANY   
 STONES.   THESE ARE MAINLY PINK IN    
 COLOUR BUT HAVE BEEN WORN SMOOTH AND  
 ROUND BY THE SEA.   THE BEACHES       
 CONTAIN A VARIETY OF STONES - GRANITE,
 QUARTZ, BUT MAINLY SANDSTONE.   THIS  
 VARIETY OF SANDSTONE IS VERY HARD AND 
 FOUND ONLY IN THIS AREA.
