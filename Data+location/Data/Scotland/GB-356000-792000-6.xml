		<title>06THE FINZEAN WOMEN'S GUILD.</title>
		<content> The Women's Guild, a{Church of}       
{Scotland}organisation,was formed in   
 Finzean over 50 years ago and during  
 that time has seen many changes. For a
 time there was both a Women's Guild   
 and a{Young Wives'Group}but due to the
 shortage of members,these have now    
 amalgamated.They hold six  monthly    
 meetings throughout the winter to     
 which are invited speakers on a wide  
 variety of subjects.                  
 At Christmas they organise an evening 
{Carol Singing}around the district when
 they are joined by others in the      
 community. The Guild ladies organise  
 Church fetes and cater for Church     
 functions.                            
 On the Guild's{51st birthday}the Kirk 
 Session took the ladies out to dinner,
 the 50th birthday having passed       
 unnoticed!
