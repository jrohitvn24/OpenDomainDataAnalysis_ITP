		<title>03MY FAMILY</title>
		<content> I live with my family in Haugh of     
 Urr.  We moved here recently and I    
 think it is a nice area.  We had lived
 in Sandbach, Cheshire but wanted to   
 live in the country.  My sister Wendy,
 who is 17, was doing her 'O Levels'   
 and we had to wait until she had sat  
 them before moving.  My dad still     
 works there so he is away four or five
 days a week.  My mum used to work for 
 'Rank Hovis McDougall' but now she    
 works with the 'Bradford and Bingley  
 Building Society' in Castle Douglas.  
 My Gran and Auntie Nett live with us, 
 they do the housework.  I have a dog  
 called Bruce, he is a Red Setter and  
 he is cute.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
