		<title>16THE RENFREW FERRY</title>
		<content> Renfrew, on the banks of the River    
 Clyde, was first granted a 'right of  
 ferry' by Robert lll in the 14th      
 century and there has certainly been a
 ferry since 1710. In 1984 however the 
 old chain driven ferry was replaced by
 two new motor ferries called the      
 "Renfrew Rose" and the "Yoker Swan"   
 after its ports of call.The names were
 chosen by local children. In 1984     
 the ferry carried about 200 cars and  
 800 people a day. However this level  
 of traffic is a marked deterioration  
 on the days before the Clyde Tunnel,  
 Erskine Bridge and the motorway so    
 that the old ferry was no longer      
 viable. Thus in July 1984 fares rose  
 by 25% and the two 60ft motor launches
 took over, signalling the demise of   
 the last chain driven ferry on the    
 Clyde and nostalgic names like "Number
 One".                                 </content>
