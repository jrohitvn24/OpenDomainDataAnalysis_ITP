		<content> Most of the houses in the main street 
 of Gordon are quite old. Some have    
 stones with the date inscribed on     
 them. The Gordon post office was built
 in 1851 and is still the original     
 building. A bit of the building was   
 called the Post Office Close. It is   
 used for a storeroom now. The post    
 office is about the middle of the     
 main street. Glebe Park is mainly a   
 housing area which is situated next to
 the road as you come in from the      
 Edinburgh side. Glebe Park is fairly  
 new because it was built within the   
 last ten years. Most of the houses in 
 Glebe Park are semi-detatched. They   
 are mostly centrally heated but some  
 are not. The houses have small gardens
 front and back. there are no shops at 
 all in Glebe Park.
