		<title>03Linlithgow Gala Day.</title>
		<content>  In Linlithgow traditional festivals  
 are celebrated, one of the main ones  
 being the Gala Day.It is a children's 
 festival which started in 1930 and has
 carried on since then_apart from when 
 World War II was in progress.         
  This year's dowager queen, who is an 
 ex_pupil of our school,said she found 
 the day"very tiring."She wore a dress 
 of white taffeta with lace on the     
 bodice and a frill on the hem.The lady
 who was chosen to crown last year's   
 queen was our Assistant Head Teacher. 
 She told us that she felt it was a    
 great honour to have been chosen      
 although she was nervous and excited  
 on the day.                           
  This year's queen,who is also a pupil
 of this school,said,"I think the Gala 
 Day will be one of the most exciting  
 and unforgettable days of my life!"
