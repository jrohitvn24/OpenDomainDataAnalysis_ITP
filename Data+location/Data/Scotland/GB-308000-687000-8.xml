 we have halls, a cinema, discos, bingo
 and travelling shows.                 
    The Carnegie Hall stages plays,    
 operas and pantomimes performed by    
 local groups and suitable for all     
 ages.  It has a Saturday morning club 
 for children to enjoy.  The hall is   
 rarely closed and is a great          
 attraction for visitors to the town.  
    Dunfermline has only one cinema,   
 the "Orient Express" but it shows     
 three films every night except        
 Wednesday.  It is easy to find a good

 films showing are listed in our local 
 paper, "The Dunfermline Press".
