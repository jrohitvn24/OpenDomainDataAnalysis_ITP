 Crofting has been the way of life in  
 the Scottish Highlands for the past   
 hundred years or so.                  
                                       
 This way of life involves the keeping 
 of livestock (mainly sheep and        
 cattle).  They are fed, at a great    
 cost, during the winter months but    
 during the rest of the year they are  
 put out to graze on the relatively    
 poor pastures. This land is called    
 Common Grazing which is divided       
 equally amongst the local community.  
                                       
 Crofting also involves planting crops 
 such as potatoes, turnips and other   
 vegetables which are used in turn to  
 feed the families. This is referred to
 as subsistance farming.
