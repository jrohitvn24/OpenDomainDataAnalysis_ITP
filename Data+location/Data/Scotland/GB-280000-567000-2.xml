		<content> During recent years there have been a 
 number of traffic accidents involving 
 the people of Springholm.             
 In the past four years there have been
 sixteen accidents involving vehicles. 
 There have been some very lucky       
 escapes,some very serious accidents   
 and two deaths. Most of these         
 accidents involved adults, not        
 children as you would expect. The     
 latest accident was on the 1st of     
 June,1985 involving two cars, one     
 pulling onto the road,the other       
 hitting it. Luckily enough it was not 
 serious. The speed limit of Springholm
 is 40 mph but motorists do not stick  
 to it. Instead of doing 40 mph they do
 50 mph. The people of Springholm and  
 other areas round about think that if 
 the speed limit was reduced to 30 mph 
 motorists might do 40 mph.
