		<title>13INDUSTRIAL WASTE, KIRKCALDY</title>
		<content> Within the vicinity of Kirkcaldy there
 are two areas of the landscape        
 currently marred by the dumping of    
 industrial waste.                     
 Three kilometres from Kirkcaldy on the
 south side of the A907 an area is     
 being used to dump slag from Seafield 
 Colliery.This black stony material    
 makes the land appear dirty, however  
 the plan is to eventually cover the   
 slag with topsoil and return it to use
 as farming land.                      
 The second area lies just off the B923
 to the west of Kinghorn Loch. This is 
 a larger area, and the material dumped
 here is waste from the British Alcan  
 alumina refinery in Burnt Island. This
 waste is bright red in colour and     
 causes a scar on the landscape, for   
 which it is very difficult to envisage
 any future solution. The approach     
 roads are also covered in red dust.   </content>
