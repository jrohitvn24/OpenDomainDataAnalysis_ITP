		<content> A few hundred yards to the east of the
 large farm of Scar there lies, upon a 
 small rise,a building known as the    
{Tower}which in appearance resembles a 
{Pictish Broch.                        
                                       
 When it is investigated it is found to
 be only{100_150}years old. It is{3.91 
{metres}high,{1.57 metres}in diameter  
 and it has a circumference of{4.93    
{metres.                               
                                       
 In the days of the{Orkney kelp        
 industry a{flag}was fixed atop the    
 Tower.If it was fully raised the flag 
 would signal that a kelp boat was     
 in.If it was at half mast it would    
 mean that a coal boat was in port.    
 There is a splendid view from the     
 top of the Tower which is the{highest 
{point}in Burness.                     
                                       </content>
