{butterfly farm }opened.It is located  
 at 313676 and is the latest edition to
 Dobbie's large garden centre.In the   
 U.K.there are three other such farms. 
 Already the project has been very     
 successful.Coach parties of school    
 children are a common sight.At        
 weekends many day-trippers from       
 Edinburgh pay a visit.It is a popular 
 tourist attraction.                   
 Many colourful types of tropical      
 butterflies fly freely round a large  
 heated greenhouse. Visitors have to be
 sharp sighted to spot every species in
 the guide book.                       
 There is an exhibition room where     
 display boards explain fascinating    
 details of butterfly life.Other live  
 insects such as tarantulas,bird       
 spiders and locusts may be seen in    
 glass cases.There is a gift shop.     </content>
