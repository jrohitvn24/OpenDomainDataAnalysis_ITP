		<content>{NORMAL HOUSING:}There is a variety of 
 housing in Dornoch ranging from modern
 council houses to traditional private 
 houses. Many of the older croft houses
 have been renovated to provide modern,
 comfortable homes. There has been an  
 increase in private house building in 
 recent years, mainly detached houses  
 on individual sites or in small groups
 such as at Lonemore. At Bishopfield   
 and Camore the local council have     
 built more houses. There is a waiting 
 list for council houses.              
{SPECIAL HOUSING:}Dornoch has a number 
 of listed buildings and most of the   
 older houses are large and are built  
 of sandstone. Dornoch's most recent   
 development is Stafford Court. It was 
 built by the British Legion specially 
 for retired ex-servicemen or their    
 families. Some large old houses have  
 been turned into shops and offices.   </content>
