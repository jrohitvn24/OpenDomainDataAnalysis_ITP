		<title>15A FERNESS GAMEKEEPER'S YEAR</title>
		<content>    A gamekeeper is concerned with     
 fishing, shooting (mainly grouse and  
 pheasants but also duck, woodcock and 
 pigeon) and stalking (mainly roe deer-
 bucks in summer, does in winter).     
 Vermin control is done throughout the 
 year, terriers being used to flush    
 foxes from burrows, and ferrets for   
 rabbits.                              
    Grouse shooting begins on the      
 'glorious' 12th of August and costs   
 about Â£10 per brace. In spring and    
 autumn heather is burnt in strips to  
 provide better feeding and cover for  
 the grouse. Pheasants are shot in     
 winter but chicks have to be hatched  
 and reared in spring and summer for   
 release and fed daily over the winter.
 Various breeds of dogs are used in    
 stalking. Scrub clearance along river 
 banks helps maintain fishing beats.
