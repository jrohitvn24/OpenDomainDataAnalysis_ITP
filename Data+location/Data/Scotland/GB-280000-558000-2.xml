 At Craignair Quarry near Dalbeattie   
 granite is excavated by blasting with 
 gelignite to bring the granite down   
 and if necessary secondary blasting to
 reduce the size of the pieces which   
 are further reduced by pneumatic      
 breakers.Crushed granite and granite  
 chipings are produced by a crushing   
 plant worked by 4 operaters.There is  
 also a coating plant where granite    
 chips are coated with bitumen to make 
 Bitmac for road surfacing.Some of the 
 products are used locally but mainly  
 they go to Central Scotland to        
 Builders Merchants. Granite has been  
 quarried here since 1820 and at the   
 present rate of extraction which is   
 125,000 tons per year it is estimated 
 that the quarry will last for over 100
 years.The 20 employees are mainly     
 drivers of large trucks and excavators</content>
