		<title>17HOUSING IN PAISLEY</title>
		<content> Housing in the area is extremely      
 varied and although some of it is now 
 over 100 years old, almost all of the 
 housing is in a good state of repair. 
 The dominant housing types are:-      
{-Victorian tenements}built for the    
 workers in the nearby mills.  The     
 poorest tenements have been demolished
 allowing road improvements and increa-
 sed office space, the remainder being 
 modernised.                           
 The eastern edge of the town is made  
 up of inter-war owner-occupied housing
 close to green areas.  It is unusual  
 for the eastern side of a town to have
 such a large are of low-density       
 housing and this has repercussions on 
 services and amenities. Small areas of
 new housing, private and council, have
 been built where a small site has     
 changed its land-use.
