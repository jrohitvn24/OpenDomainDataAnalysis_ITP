		<title>12DOUNE NATURE TRAIL/COMMONTY</title>
		<content>{ Doune Nature Trail}is an enjoyable   
 walk and starts from the Moray        
 Park. It follows the route of the old 
 railway line but now that is gone.It  
 is good for the general public as well
 as naturalists because there are lots 
 of plants and flowers and trees like  
 elm, willow, dog rose and elder; it is
 surrounded mostly by forest and       
 farmland. It is good also for bird-   
 watchers as there are many types of   
 birds to be seen _ chaffinches,       
 robins, thrushes, blackbirds, blue    
 tits, willow warblers and             
 whitethroats. When you have gone along
 about halfway you can turn on to {the 
{Commonty Walk.}It takes you along the 
 fringes of a coniferous wood and back 
 to Doune via the Springbank Quarries.
