 THERE ARE SEVERAL CHURCHES IN OUR     
 AREA. ST.AIDAN'S AND ST.NINIAN'S ARE  
 BOTH CHURCH OF SCOTLAND WHICH IS OUR  
 NATIONAL CHURCH. ST. NINIAN'S HAS A   
 MEMBERSHIP ROLL OF 1200 AND ST.       
 AIDAN'S IS SLIGHTLY SMALLER WITH      
 1009.THE ONLY CATHOLIC CHURCH IS      
 CALLED OUR LADY AND ST. ANDREW WITH A 
 ROLL OF 750. THESE THREE BUILDINGS ARE
 ALL MADE OF SOLID STONE, TWO OF WHICH 
 HAVE SPIRES. IT IS INTERESTING TO     
 NOTE THAT THERE ARE NO CHURCHES IN THE
 TOWN WITH TOWERS.NAMES OF VERY        
 IMPORTANT SCOTTISH SAINTS HAVE BEEN   
 GIVEN TO THESE THREE CHURCHES. ALSO IN
 THIS AREA ARE THREE SMALLER CHURCHES -
 BAPTIST (150 MEMBERS),CONGREGATIONAL  
 (140 MEMBERS),APOSTOLIC(75 MEMBERS).
