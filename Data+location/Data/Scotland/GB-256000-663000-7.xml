		<content> A typical day for me would be to rise 
 at 8.00.At 8.30 I have a breakfast of 
 corn flakes,bread and butter and tea.I
 leave the house at 8.50 and walk to   
 school. I go to school from Monday to 
 Friday.School starts at{9.00}and      
 finishes at{3.30.}My school day begins
 with prayers.Then I spend the morning 
 doing English,Maths and project work. 
 Lunchtime is at 12.15 and I go home   
 for lunch.                            
 After lunch we have painting,followed 
 by a visit to the gymn.At playtime I  
 enjoy playing at balls with my        
 friends.                              
 For the rest of the afternoon we can  
 continue with our projects or play at 
 chess.At 3.30 I go home with my       
 friends.When I get home I usually read
 an Enid Blyton book until it is time  
 for tea.                              
                                       </content>
