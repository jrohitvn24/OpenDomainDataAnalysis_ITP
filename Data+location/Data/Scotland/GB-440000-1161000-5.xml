 The Cruden houses were built just     
 after the Second World War and were   
 designed as temporary buildings with a
 life of about 10 years.               
 Tenants first moved into the Crudens  
 in 1949 and were in the same houses in
 1984. However,by 1983 it was decided  
 that the houses were unsafe and wooden
 batons were put up on the outside and 
 inside walls to strengthen them.      
 In October 1984 the houses were       
 vacated and major improvements began. 
 The families were housed in caravans  
 and vacant council houses.            
 Everything had to be cleared out of   
 the houses while new brickwork walls  
 were built,the roofs slated,central   
 heating installed and kitchen units   
 and bathroom suites fitted.           
 In March 1985 the families started to 
 move back into the renovated Crudens. </content>
