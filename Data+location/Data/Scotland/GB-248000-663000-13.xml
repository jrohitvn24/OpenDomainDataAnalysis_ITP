		<title>13THE NEW HARBOUR NEAR PAISLEY</title>
		<content> On the River Cart which runs close to 
 our school,there is the new Industrial
 Estate built by money from the E.E.C. 
 to create more jobs and a better env- 
 ironment for the people of the area.  
 Hidden in behind this is the site of  
 the New Harbour.  Map ref:-4865.  The 
 best view of the site is from the     
 swing bridge over the River Cart at   
 Carlvale Lane.  This harbour was busy 
 in the past but is largely unused     
 except for some development work which
 is taking place at the moment.        
                                       
 Periodically there have been articles 
 in the local newspaper about the      
 harbour being developed into a kind of
 leisure complex, with small boats     
 sailing on the river.  These would be 
 pleasure craft which local people     
 could use. Perhaps in time this will  
 come to be.                           </content>
