 The main land use in this sector is   
 where marshland has been drained to   
 provide rough grazing for sheep.There 
 are laso small crofts where a few     
 fodder crops and vegetables would be  
 grown.                                
      The large forestry plantations   
 are typically planted in rectangular  
 blocks and this provides shelter for  
 the surrounding plots of land.        
       There is also a large river     
 running through this area and is used 
 in assisting with the draining of the 
 marshland as it carries away the      
 runoff.                               
      This landscape is also reasonably
 hilly with the ground,in some places, 
 rising well over three hundred feet   
 above sea level.
