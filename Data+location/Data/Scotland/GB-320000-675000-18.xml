		<content> With the increase in working mothers  
 the '80's has seen an enormous        
 increase in the use of{convenience    
{foods}that are ready to serve after   
 heating. Within the last 5 years      
{microwave ovens}have been introduced  
 and they increase the speed of        
 cooking. Nearly every home has a      
{fridge}and{freezer}and there are many 
 shops selling only freezer food.      
 Ready-made foods contain many         
{additives}and{flavourings.}Some of    
 these cause concern among             
 nutritionists. Some have already been 
 found to have side effects. Because of
 this there has been a marked increase 
 in{wholefood}shops where{organically  
{grown}food can be bought. Many people 
 are becoming{vegetarian}through choice
 and economy as meat is an expensive   
 item. Foods such as yoghurt, muesli   
 and oven chips have become popular.   </content>
