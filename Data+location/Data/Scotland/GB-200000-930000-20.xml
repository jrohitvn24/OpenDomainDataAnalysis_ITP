		<content> WHAT IS THERE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO  
 IN THIS AREA?                         
 A Youth Club has been opened in our   
 new Community Hall. Every Saturday we 
 can spend two hours in the afternoon  
 and again at night.You can play darts,
 table tennis, snooker, billiards,     
 dominoes or cards. Teenagers can spend
 Saturday evening enjoying all these   
 activities as well. It is a welcome   
 change for all the young people to    
 spend time together rather than       
 sitting at home in front of the       
 television.  There are plans for adult
 groups as well.
