		<title>07HOUSES ON THE ESTATE 2</title>
		<content>     The houses have coal fires and    
 inset windows, of which there are 3   
 different types in the main room.     
     The cottage is rather small and   
 has only 3 main rooms, a bathroom and 
 a kitchen.  At the kitchen door there 
 is a porch which looks onto the       
 garden. The rooms in the cottage are  
 quite small and the biggest was the   
 2nd bedroom.  There are 2 halls in the
 cottage; one at the entrance and      
 another leading to the bathroom.  The 
 house and the garden cover at least   
 one acre.                             
     The house that was built on to the
 stables was one of 3 and is quite high
 and narrow.  It has 3 bedrooms, 1     
 kitchen, 1 bathroom and a sitting     
 room.  This house is estimated to be  
 worth Â£20,000.
