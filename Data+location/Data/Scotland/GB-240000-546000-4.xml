		<title>04History Of Sorbie Village</title>
		<content>    Sorbie village is full of {local   
{history}.It got its name from the     
 Saxons. They named it "Sour-by"       
 because the land where they lived was 
 so marshy that they were unable to    
 grow crops on it. That is why they    
 thought the land was sour. Through the
 years, the name was altered until it  
 became "Sorbie".                      
    The two{Churches}in Sorbie were    
 built many years ago. One is now an   
 antique shop. It used to be a         
 Reformist Church. The other one which 
 is in the old grave yard was a        
 Presbyterian Church. It is no longer  
 used. The grave stone of the first    
 school teacher to teach at Sorbie is  
 situated in this grave yard.          
    The {monument}in Sorbie was put up 
 in memory of the soldiers who died in 
 the first and second world wars. These
 men lived in the district of Sorbie.  </content>
