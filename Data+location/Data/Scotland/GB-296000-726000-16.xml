		<content> There is a wide variety of sports open
 to pupils, due to the extensive       
 facilities.  The major sports are     
 Rugby and Cricket, but minor sports   
 include Squash, Tennis, Swimming,     
 Basketball, Shooting and Athletics.   
                                       
 Rugby is played from September to     
 March and is compulsory for all boys. 
 There are fourteen teams, which       
 practise every weekday and play       
 matches on Saturdays and some         
 Tuesdays.                             
 There are similar arrangements for    
 Cricket, but it is only compulsory for
 junior boys, and there are far fewer  
 teams for that reason.                
 Nearly every minor sport has a team,  
 and a few fixtures are played. The    
 exception is hockey, which has almost 
 as many fixtures as the major sports.
