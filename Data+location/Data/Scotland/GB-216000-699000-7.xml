		<content> In 1984 there was a total of 84 crimes
 and offences,a drop of 8% on the      
 previous year.Of these 31 were thefts,
 the most common crime in the area.    
 Fortunately most crimes are solved and
 the detection rate is 65%.            
 Lochgoilhead Police Station has a cell
 but it is not{legalised,}it can be    
 used for detention only.If a prisoner 
 is to be held over-night he/she is    
 taken to Dunoon.                      
 Many of the offenders are sent for    
 trial to{Dunoon District Court}but for
 minor offences they are sent to{      
{Inveraray District Court.}For crimes  
 of a serious nature the offenders are 
 sent for trial to the{High Courts}in  
{Glasgow and Edinburgh.}Fortunately    
 this is a rare occurence.
