		<content> There is a small wooden shop in the   
 middle of village.The busy shopkeeper,
 Libby,lives near the shop with her    
 husband and two daughters.Libby whose 
 family have lived here for at least   
 five generations,is a church elder    
 and member of the village hall commit-
 tee.Local people and tourists can     
 buy all they need from the shop.The   
 postlady delivers supplies to more    
 isolated people who all have postboxes
 at their road end.If they have mail to
 be collected,they put a stone on top  
 of their box so the postlady will     
 know.                                 
 Libby gives tourists directions to    
 holiday houses,petrol and diesel      
 stations and fishing lochs.Notices in 
 the shop window tell about function   
 and activities.Her husband and brother
 bring groceries and special orders    
 from Glasgow cash and carries.        </content>
