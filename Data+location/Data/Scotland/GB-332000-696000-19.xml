		<title>19Rural - Woodland</title>
		<content> Although the rural area within this   
 square is predominantly high quality  
 agricultural land there are also a few
 sections of woodland. The woodland is 
 in two large areas in the north west  
 of the square. These consist of a     
 mixture of coniferous and deciduous   
 (mainly Birch, Elm, Ash &amp; Sycamore)   
 trees which were originally planted by
 the Wemyss Estate. These trees        
 therefore, belong to the Laird of     
 Wemyss and the only body who can      
 officially order the felling of trees 
 is the Wemyss Estate. There are quite 
 a few elm trees throughout this square
 but luckily, so far, very few have had
 to be felled as a result of Dutch Elm 
 Disease.                              
 The small wooded areas on the         
 outskirts of the villages provide well
 used recreational areas for both the  
 elderly and the young.                </content>
