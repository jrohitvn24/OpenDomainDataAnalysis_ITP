We undertook a traffic count of the vehicles passing the school from 12:00pm to 12:35pm. We found out that 57% of the cars went into Dunfermline and 43% went out. The five most popular car makes were 1st Ford, 2nd Vauxhall, 3rd Volkswagen, joint 4th Honda and Renault, 5th Peugeot. In the same traffic count 50% of lorries were going out of Dunfermline and 50% of the lorries were going into Dunfermline. The three most popular lorries were DAF, Mercedes and Iveco followed by Scania and Man.   &lt;br />
