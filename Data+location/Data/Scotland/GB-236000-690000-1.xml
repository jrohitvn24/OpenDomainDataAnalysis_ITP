		<title>01The Islands of Loch Lomand</title>
		<content> This block consists mainly of islands.
 Here are the details of a few:        
                                       
 INCHMOAN: This island once provided   
 fuel for the village of Luss because  
 of its stock of peat. It also has a   
 sandy beach if you are interested as a
 tourist.                              
                                       
 BUCINCH &amp; CEARDACH: These two islands 
 are owned by the National Trust for   
 Scotland. Ceardach is one of the      
 smallest named islands in Loch Lomand.
                                       
 INCHTAVANNACH: In the dark ages Celtic
 missionaries called their congregation
 by ringing a bell. There was such a   
 bell on the hill of this island and it
 is for this reason that the hill is   
 called 'Tomnaclang' or hill of the    
 bell.                                 
                                       </content>
