		<title>11Post Bus: Denny to FINTRY</title>
		<content> The only regular daily transport      
 service to the village, which is not  
 primarily for school children, is the 
 Denny Post Bus. Even this, saving     
 Fridays, is only a one way service.   
                                       
 The vehicle is a mini-bus which       
 combines postal collection with       
 pasenger carrying. Starting from and  
 returning to Denny, the service       
 operates throughout the year.         
                                       
 Monday to Thursday it runs in the     
 single direction to Denny and leaves  
 at 11am each day.                     
                                       
 On Fridays it returns and does an     
 additional trip at 4pm.               
                                       
 It is mainly used by tourists, as the 
 timetable is not very practical for   
 village folk.                         </content>
