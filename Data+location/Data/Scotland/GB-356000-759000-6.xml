		<title>06AN ARABLE FARM NEAR BRECHIN</title>
		<content>{Maisondieu}farm is on the northern    
 outskirts of Brechin.{Mr Mather}showed
 us over the{273}acre farm. He grows   
 barley on 185 acres of his gently     
 sloping land and he has grazing for   
 his 60 Cross breed beef cattle.  One  
 field (15 acres) of hay, 8 acres of   
 turnips and 18 acres of potatoes      
 (grown by a contractor) completes the 
 farm.                                 
 The old steading, soon to be entirely 
 renewed, provides cattle courts and   
 space for his range of machinery e.g. 
 3 tractors, combine harvester,        
 sprayer, baler and trailer. Storage   
 space for food concentrates and hay is
 also available.The farmer only employs
 one worker.Much barley is sold and    
 enters the large{EEC}store at{Dubton  
{of Stracathro.}The catle are sold at  
{Montrose}auction mart.These crop and  
 livestock sales provide the profits.  </content>
