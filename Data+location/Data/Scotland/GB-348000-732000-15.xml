		<content>   Monifieth is a good holiday centre  
 As the main Dundee-Arbroath-Aberdeen  
 Road runs just north of the town,there
 is easy access to other places.       
  The Caravan Site is popular specially
 in July when during the 4week period a
 1000 or more people may be staying.   
 Families with young children find lots
 to do-putting,go-karting and making   
 sandcastles.Beach leaders have a games
 programme.                            
  Older people enjoy quietness and the 
 pleasant seaside atmosphere.They like 
 the friendly assistants in the shops. 
                                       
  Ardestie Earth House is worth a visit
 Leave your car by the road and walk up
 to the Souterrain,a longcurved passage
 mostly underground,thatched-roofed.It 
 may have been used as refuge or stores
 The settlement,4 stone huts thatched- 
 roofed was occupied AD 1st-2nd century</content>
