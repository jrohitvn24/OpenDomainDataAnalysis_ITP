{Thomas Pollit}came from Failsworth,{  
{Manchester}to Gretna on 3/5/85 to get 
 married and visit the Old Smiddy which

 thought the registrar's ceremony was  
 lovely and that Gretna was a beautiful
 place.

 nicer than they had expected and it   
 had given them a lovely start to their
 married life.
