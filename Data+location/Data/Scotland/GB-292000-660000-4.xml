		<content>         I usually get up at about 8.15
 and get dressed, get  my  breakfast of
 cereal and milk straight after, but if
 there is no milk ,I  go to the shop on
 my {BMX }bike  which  is  a  specially
 built  bicycle  to  withstand  great  
 impact. Then  I  come  back  and watch
 television   until  9.00  then I go to
 school,which opens  at  9.10.We  start
 work  after  prayers  with  spelling ,
 S.R.A.,  maths  and  sometimes  Junior
 History.                              
         Interval is 10.45  until 11.00
 and we usually play{Red Rover}which is
 where there  are two  lines of  people
 facing  each  other and one side calls
 for someone{e.g.:" Red Rover,Red Rover
{send Paul Lee right over !"} Then Paul
 Lee has to try to break through a line
 of people holding hands,if he succeeds
 he then goes  back to his own team and
 they choose who has to come over.     </content>
