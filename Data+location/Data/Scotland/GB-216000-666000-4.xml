		<title>042nd DEVELOPMENT SKELMORLIE</title>
		<content>  While the end of the 2nd World  War  
 brought an end to the servant filled  
 life of the rich,it also brought about
 a rapid expansion of Skelmorlie.      
  During the Blitz of Greenock in 1941 
 many people fled to the surrounding   
 villages and spent the remainder of   
 the war years there as refugees.At the
 end of the war many of these families 
 wanted to stay on in Skelmorlie and   
 houses to rent were built to accommo- 
 date them.The local authority housing 
 grew.                                 
  There was not much employment in     
 Skelmorlie and people travelled to    
 Greenock and Glasgow to work.         
 Skelmorlie was becoming a dormitory   
 village.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
