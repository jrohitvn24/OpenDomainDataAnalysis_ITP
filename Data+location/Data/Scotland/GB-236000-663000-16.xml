		<content>  When the line opened in{1864}it ran  
 from{Princes Pier}in{Greenock}to      
{Glasgow.}It was used to transport coal
 , leather and imported Irish cattle.  
  Passengers from{Trans-Atlantic}liners
 calling at{Greenock}used boat-train   
 expresses on the line.                
  During the war it was used to carry  
 troops and supplies.                  
  Latterly passengers from the village 
 were shoppers, children at private    
 schools and business men commuting to 
{Glasgow.                              
  As more people bought cars, the line 
 had insufficient passengers to run at 
 a profit and was closed in 1983 and   
 replaced by an{express bus service.   
  A rigourous campaign to save the line
 was in vain and the tracks were       
 dismantled. Many villagers say it     
 should never have been closed while   
 others prefer new transport facilities</content>
