		<title>14Dr.Cooper from Insch contd..</title>
		<content>  And so he started in general practice
 in the slums of London. As a young man
 he caught "Consumption", a disease    
 better known today as Tuberculosis.In 
 1912 he was taken on as a partner and 
 stayed until he retired when he was   
 seventy eight years old.              
  Dr. Cooper was one of the seven      
 doctors who helped in the setting up  
 of the National Health Service.       
  Sometimes instead of money as payment
 for his services he was paid in kind. 
 We saw a picture in silk of lions     
 which he got from a man as payment.   
  He used to smoke but he gave it up a 
 long time ago because he realised it  
 was bad for his health.He doesn't     
 drink either.He says he has lived so  
 long because he has had nothing to do 
 with women! His family told us he has 
 no worries and is a very contented old
 man.                                  </content>
