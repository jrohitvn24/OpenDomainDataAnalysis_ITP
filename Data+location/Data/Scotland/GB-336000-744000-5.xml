		<title>05TOURISM in GLAMIS</title>
		<content>     Tourism is an important factor in 
 the local economy.  The nearby Glamis 
 Castle draws many visitors each summer
 and a few of these spend time in the  
 local shops and in looking at the     
 village of Glamis.                    
                                       
     Others come to see the village for
 its own attractions - the old         
 buildings in the main street, the folk
 museum, and the Kirk, dating from 1450
 which has a Celtic standing stone     
 dating from around 750 in the manse   
 garden.                               
                                       
    There is rather limited bed and    
 breakfast accomodation in the area.   
 The Strathmore Arms in Glamis has a   
 well known dining room, but no        
 bedrooms.
