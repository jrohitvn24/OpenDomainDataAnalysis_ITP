		<title>04The River South Esk.(cont)</title>
		<content>    Along the banks of the Esk can be  
 found the sites and ruins of many     
 water-mills.Some of these were meal   
 mills others supplied power for small 
 industrial and agricultural           
 enterprises.                          
    A sharp bend in the river,beleived 
 to be partly man-made forms part of   
 the defences of the ancient castle of 
 Brechin.                              
    The Esk runs into the great tidal  
 loch known as Montrose Basin.This     
 basin is the habitat of a wide range  
 of wild-fowl,some residents,others    
 migratory visitors.The basin is now a 
 nature reserve.                       
     The Esk reaches the North Sea at  
 the town of Montrose,with wide sandy  
 beaches to the North and a rocky      
 headland known as Scurdie Ness to the 
 South.
