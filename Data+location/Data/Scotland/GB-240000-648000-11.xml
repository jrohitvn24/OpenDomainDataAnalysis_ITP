		<title>11TRAFFIC PROBLEMS DUNLOP</title>
		<content> MAIN STREET IS THE BUSIEST STREET IN  
 DUNLOP,CARRYING BOTH LORRIES AND      
 CARS.THE HOUSES HAVE NO FRONT         
 GARDENS AND THEY HAVE NO GARAGES SO   
 THE PEOPLE PARK THEIR CARS ON BOTH    
 SIDES OF THE ROAD.THE ROAD  IS ON A   
 SLOPE FROM THE TOP OF MAIN STREET TO  
 THE CHURCH AT THE BOTTOM.THE ROAD IS  
 BAD IN THE WINTER BECAUSE OF THE      
 ICE.IN THE SUMMER THE ROAD IS NOT SO  
 BUSY.THE TRAFFIC STARTS ABOUT 6 AM IN 
 THE MORNING AND IS HEAVY THROUGHOUT   
 THE DAY.IT IS TERRIBLY NOISY;THERE ARE
 LOTS OF BUMPS AND SCRAPES BECAUSE OF  
 PEOPLE PARKING THEIR CARS ON THE ROAD 
 SIDE AND BECAUSE THE ROAD IS SO       
 NARROW. IT IS TERRIBLY HARD TO PARK   
 YOUR CAR.WE ASKED JENNY CARRUTHERS IF 
 THE ROAD AND THE TRAFFIC PROBLEMS     
 WOULD BE THERE IN A 100 YEARS TIME AND
 JENNY CARRUTHERS SAID"OH DEFINITELY".
