		<title>01The Hills West Of Cranshaws</title>
		<content> Gently sloping exposed heather hills  
 of the lammermuirs.   Vegetation      
 mainly heather moorland, broken by    
 steep sided valleys and squire shelter
 belts of coniferous trees.Hills and   
 farmland for black face sheep which   
 need to be fed hay in the winter and  
 red grouse is an important game bird. 
 Heather is burnt on a ten year        
 rotation so hillsides have striped    
 appearance sometimes the fern bracken 
 takes the place of heather which is   
 economically undesirable as it is     
 poisonous to livestock.   Human       
 habitat restricted to around Cranshaws
 shepherds &amp; gamekeepers work hard to  
 make ends meet.   mature trees being  
 extracted from hill wood and taken to 
 the road where the logs are           
 transported out.
