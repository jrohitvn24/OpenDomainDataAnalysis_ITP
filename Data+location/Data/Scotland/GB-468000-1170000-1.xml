{ Out Skerries}consists of three tiny  
{islands,}two linked by a bridge and   
 the third, across a narrow strip of   
 water, privately owned. These islands 
 form a superb sheltered{harbour}which 
 has made this rocky 600 acres a place 
 where fishermen have lived for        
 centuries.                            
 In a time when{remote communities}are 
 fighting for their survival, Skerries 
 is flourishing, with a new{ro-ro pier 
 and upgraded{airstrip (1985),}a{fish  
{farm}and{factory,}as well as a three- 
 boat fleet. Mains{electricity}was     
 connected in 1983.                    
 Enough young people remain to live and
 work on the islands to maintain a     
 viable community. Apart from teachers,
 nurse and missionary there are no     
 'outsiders' resident.The island has a 
{primary}and a{secondary school.       </content>
