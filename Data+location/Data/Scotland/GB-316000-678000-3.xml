		<title>03THE ROSEBERYS</title>
		<content>   The{Earls of Roseberys}have as long 
 and colourful a history as their      
 house. Sir Archibald Primrose was a   
 lawyer and Lord Clerk Register of     
 Scotland under Charles II.To the end  
 of the 18th century the Roseberys     
 lived in Barnbougle but the 3rd and   
 4th Earls undertook the building of   
 Dalmeny House.The 3rd Earl was bald   
 but vain.He even went to the lengths  
 of going to Edinburgh wearing a long  
 wig and returning wearing a short wig 
 as if he had had a haircut!           
  The{5th Earl}declared whilst still at
 Eton that he wished to marry a        
 Rothschild,win the Derby and become   
 Prime Minister.He achieved all his    
 ambitions as he married Hannah, sole  
 daughter and heiress of{Baron Mayer   
{Anschel de Rothschild,}was Prime      
 Minister between 1894/5 and won the   
 Derby on three occasions.(next page)  </content>
