		<title>07GROWTH OF CROSSGATES 1</title>
		<content>{                                      
{Crossgates}grew up mainly due to      
 mining industry in the area. It is    
 sited at the junction of the old{     
{Dunfermline}to{Kircaldy},and{Perth}to{
{Edinburgh}roads.The name{Crossgates   
  means{"cross roads"}in old Scots.    
  The village grew quite rapidly       
 between{1841}and{1891}.Most of its    
 inhabitants were colliers. In{1896}   
 the population was recorded as{1165,} 
 now it is{1636}. Although in recent   
 years the village has grown in size   
 with two new private housing schemes, 
 the population has increased little.  
  Around Crossgates the land is fertile
 and is used mainly as arable farmland 
 employing few people from the village.
 The coal mines have now all closed    
 down, but signs of shafts can still be
 seen around the area.
