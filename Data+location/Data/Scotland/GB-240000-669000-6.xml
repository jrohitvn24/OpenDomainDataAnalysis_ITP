		<content>   The earliest record of inhabitants  
 of the Bishopton district stems from  
 the 2nd Century A.D. during the Roman 
 occupation.                           
   The House of Bishopton, or          
 Bishoptoun, thought itself to derive  
 from "Bishop's Toun", was an ancient  
 country retreat of the Bishop of      
 Paisley.                              
   Bishopton as a village probably     
 dates from the early 18th Century,    
 when the Old Greenock Road was built, 
 and was centred  about the west end of
 the present village, site of the      
 Bishopton Old Inn.                    
   Robert Burns's brother is buried in 
 the local cemetery.
