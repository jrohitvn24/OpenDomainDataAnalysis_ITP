		<content>{STENTON FRUIT FARM                    
  I live on a fruit farm which is      
 probably the biggest in East Lothian .
 The summer is a hectic time, We have  
{strawberries, raspberries , black }and
{red currants }and{gooseberries.  }By  
 1986 we hope to have {brambles }and { 
{tayberries }. There is a shop for all 
 the fruitpickers and a carpark and    
 playground where every year we try to 
 add something new .                   
         Mum says "July and August to  
 us mean fruit . If the weather is     
 right fruit comes before anything else
 from 8 in the morning until 10 at     
 night "                               
        Good dry weather produces good 
 fruit and people come from far and    
 wide to pick it. Many of the local    
  young people work on the fruit       
 during their summer holidays          
   I like all the fruits we have.      </content>
