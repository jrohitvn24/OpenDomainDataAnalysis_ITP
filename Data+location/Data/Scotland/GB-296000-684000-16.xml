		<title>16THE REV. A.Q. MORTON 1</title>
		<content>   The Rev.A.Q.Morton,minister at      
 Culross Abbey, has a very interesting 
 hobby-Mr. Morton is an unusual kind of
 detective.He uses words and sentence  
 formation to find information just as 
 a conventional detective uses finger- 
 prints.This unusual hobby is aided by 
 the use of a computer-Mr.Morton is an 
 expert in this field too.He became    
 interested in computers in the late   
 l94O's,but it was the late '5O's      
 before he was granted permission to   
 work on Britain's only computer in    
 London University.One of his first    
 discoveries was that the New Testament
 had been written on 5 different sizes 
 of paper.He later found that Pliny(who
 lived in the 1st.Century A.D.)confirms
 this.                                 
  Mr.Morton has since written 5 books  
 on his subject.He has written 4 more  
 in collaboration with others.         </content>
