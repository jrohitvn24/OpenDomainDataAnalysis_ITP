 Every year in May there is a trip     
 day to Kirkwall on the mainland of    
 Orkney. The boat, the Orcadia, leaves 
 Sanday at quarter to eight and takes  
 about one hour forty-five minutes to  
 get to Kirkwall. The boat takes about 
 two hundred and fifty people. It also 
 takes cargo. Most people go to        
 Kirkwall to see friends and relations 
 and to do shopping; getting things    
 that they couldn't get in Sanday and  
 at a lower cost. On trip day you can  
 also go and see the sights, like the  
 museum, St. Magnus Cathedral and the  
 Standing Stones. The boat leaves      
 Kirkwall at about half past five and  
 arrives at Sanday about eight o'clock.
