		<title>01The Rhu Peninsula</title>
		<content> The Rhu peninsula reaches out from the
 road to Isles into the sea, dividing  
 the sound of sleat from the sound of  
 arisaig.  its rocky coastline is      
 punctuated with sand beaches through  
 the peninsula consits mainly of rock. 
 The several hills are richly covered  
 in heather and wild grasses. The small
 valleys between the hills are mostly  
 peat bogs where marsh grasses grow.   
 Rhu is mainly baren and wild with only
 occasional trees and clumps of ferns  
 to relieve the landscape.  Small rock 
 and sand islands surrounded its coast 
 and to the west, the islands of rhun  
 and eigg are visible.  The main       
 inhabitants are sheep-attended by he  
 one croft.  Most of Rhu has not       
 changed for decades and remains almost
 untouched by the society of the       
 1980's, though more holidaymakers are 
 using its single track than before.   </content>
