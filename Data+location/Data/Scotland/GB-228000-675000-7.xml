		<content> One week before a girl is married her 
 friends dress her up in funny clothes 
 and make up.  They take her round the 
 pubs and streets attracting attention 
 by banging pots and spoons.  Men kiss 
 the future bride and give her money.  
 She usually carries a chamber pot full
 of salt which is an old sign of       
 wealth.  After the couple have been   
 married they go on honeymoon for a    
 week or two.  When they return to     
 their new home the groom carries the  
 bride over the threshold so there is  
 no chance of her tripping as this     
 would be unlucky.  At the wedding the 
 couple are given silver horseshoes or 
 black cats as a sign of good luck.    
 After the reception, where everyone   
 has a meal and dances, the couple     
 usually leave in a car which has been 
 decorated.                            
                                       </content>
