		<title>03Housing Renovation-Denbeath</title>
		<content>      When the Wellesley Colliery was  
 closed in l967, miners moved out of   
 Denbeath and many of the houses became
 damp and overrun with mice through    
 lack of repair.                       
      Some of the pupils in our class  
 used to live in them until their      
 parents decided to move out of these  
 bad conditions into council houses.   
      In l981 seven streets of houses  
 were sold to developers, who decided  
 to renovate them.To date,parts of     
 Forth,Clyde.Tay and Tweed Streets have
 been renovated and sold.These houses  
 are now in better condition and have  
 central heating,which the old houses  
 did not have.This makes them warmer   
 although some owners are still        
 complaining about dampness.           
      The rest of the property bought  
 by the developers is in a derelict    
 state.                                </content>
