<title>21BUCHLYVIE LOCAL HISTORY - Updated 2011</title>
<content>

The 1986 description of Buchlyvie as being "within easy reach of the beautiful scenic areas of the Trossachs and Loch Lomond" remains true, with the village now on the edge of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park (created in 2002). The history of the village is, of course, also unchanged, except that some things that were not well-known in 1986 are now becoming recognised. Foremost among these is that Buchlyvie was an important "stance" for the cattle, sheep and horses being driven from the north and west of Scotland to the "trysts" or markets, held three times a year at various places around Falkirk in the 18th and 19th Centuries. Many of the routes followed by the drovers can still be identified and some of these are recognised rights-of-way.   &lt;br />
