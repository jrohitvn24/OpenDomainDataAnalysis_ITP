 The Church of Scotland Kirk of St.    
 Mary which is 800 years old has many  
 associations. e.g. Woman's Guild,     
 Youth Fellowship, Sunday School, Bible
 Class and Choir.  There are 560       
 members who attend regularly.  During 
                                       
 the Summer we hold an early service   
 for those wishing to spend the day    
 elsewhere..  In July a Summer Mission 
 team works for two weeks with the     
 children, organising services, bible  
 study, games and a coffee bar.  We    
 have recently sold our Church Hall to 
 the District Council.  As a step      
 towards integration we hold Episcopal 
 Communion services in St. mary's every
 2 months.  The Roman Catholic Church  
 of the Most Holy Trinity is a branch  
 of the Pittenweem Parish. There is a  
 membership of 33.                     </content>
