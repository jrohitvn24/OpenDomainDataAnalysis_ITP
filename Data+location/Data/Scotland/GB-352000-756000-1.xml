		<content> The two principal features of this    
 area are Forest and Farmland.         
 The {Forest},which is called          
 Montreathmont Forest(pronounced       
 Mon-tri-mond),extends to 1005 hectares
 and it has 1608000 trees (approx.).   
 However,only 307 hectares are in this 
 designated area.                      
 The forest is ministered by the       
 Forestry Commission and the oldest    
 trees were planted in 1936.There has  
 been a change in recent years, because
 of the interest in Ecology, and the   
 incidence of disease, and the         
 Commission now plant different kinds  
 of trees in each section_ a mixture of
 Pine, Larch, Sitka Spruce and Norway  
 Spruce.  Included are also other trees
 such as Birch and Sycamore.           
 The Commission has a history of       
 co_operation with other organizations.
