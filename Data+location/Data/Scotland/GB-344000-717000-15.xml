		<content> Guardbridge has two clubs, the youth  
 club for young people, and the sports 
 and social club for adults.  The      
 sports and social club is attended by 
 1200 members who make use of the      
 facilities - pool tables, darts,      
 dominoes and bingo.  The youth club   
 unfortunately is in danger of closing 
 down because of the poor attendance of
 only 30 members.  The feeling of the  
 children was that it did not provide  
 enough facilities for them.  There are
 also riding stables, one has 34       
 horses.  Trecking costs Â£2.50 for     
 children under 12 and Â£3.00 for       
 adults.  They get a lot of holiday    
 makers going out during the week days.
 They lease horses for Â£600 per year,  
 at the moment they have 6 leases.     
 They feed their horses on beet pulp,  
 oats, barley, mixed feed and pony nuts
 they get from local suppliers.        </content>
