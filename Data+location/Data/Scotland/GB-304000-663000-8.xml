		<content> We carried out a survey in square     
 03060665 with seventeen pupils from   
{Williamston Primary}which caters for  
{Murieston}and{Easter Bankton}housing  
 estates.We found that the most popular
 types of housing are terraced and     
 bungalows.These houses are all        
 privately owned.The average number of 
 rooms is seven,the average number of  
 people living in them is four.{Bankton
{Glade}is also in this area.A group of 
 people formed themselves into a self  
 build housing cooperative which gave  
 them the status of a Limited Company  
 and Charity.They were then able to buy
 a site from the{Livingston Development
{Corporation}at a price fixed by the   
{Disrict Valuer.}Torwood Homes supplied
 and erected twelve kit houses for     
 them.A sub-contractor laid drains,    
 roads and footpaths.Normally such a   
 group do all the work themselves.     </content>
