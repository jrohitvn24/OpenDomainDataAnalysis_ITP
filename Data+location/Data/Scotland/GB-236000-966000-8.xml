		<content> In Durness there is a mixture of      
 housing types. There are traditional  
 stone built houses, council housing   
 and a few modern bungalows. At Druim  
 Bhlar council houses were built in the
 early 1970's on bog land .They are    
 unsuitable houses for this area and   
 are beginning to subside .Recently    
 there have been two modern kit houses 
 built.One of them is being built by my
 Dad in Sangomore .He built the        
 foundations himself .Some men from Roy
 Construction of Thurso came to put up 
 the timber frame.He put up the outside
 wall himself .Some time after that Roy
 Construction came back with things for
 the inside of the house .Dad has put  
 up the tiles and found out that he was
 two rows short .He is now doing the   
 inside of the house.We hope to have   
 the house finished by the end of the  
 year.   {By Iona Macpherson,aged 9    </content>
