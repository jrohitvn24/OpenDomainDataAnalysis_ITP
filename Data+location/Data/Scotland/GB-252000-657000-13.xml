		<content>    Eastwood district has many examples
 of magnificent stone built churches   
 representing most denominations of the
 Christian faith .These churches are   
 well attended by both young and old   
 alike .                               
    Over the last 50 years there have  
 been 2 major migrations of ethnic     
 minorities into the area .The first   
 was a large influx of Jews who settled
 so well in the area that there are 2  
 synagogues ,one orthodox and the other
 reformed .The second migration is of  
 much more recent origin .Many people  
 from India and Pakistan have recently 
 taken up residence in the area        
 ,bringing with them their own         
 religions and customs .The area now is
 of a mixture of beliefs and           
 traditions , all of which live happily
 side by side in friendly integration .
