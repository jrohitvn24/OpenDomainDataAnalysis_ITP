		<title>01BOTHWELL WATER TO DUDDY LAW</title>
		<content> On the eastern slopes of the          
 Lammermuirs this area is dominated by 
 the deep winding valley of the        
 Bothwell water, a clear, clean, fast  
 running stream. The hills to the east 
 rise to 359 metres and are gently     
 rolling. Very exposed with little     
 shelter. Mainly rough grazing and     
 heather here with blackface sheep     
 which stay on the hill all winter, the
 main economic venture. Red Grouse are 
 an important game bird shot on these  
 hills. A large area of the block      
 recently planted with spruce trees as 
 an alternative to sheep farming. Human
 population sparse and confined to more
 sheltered valleys with agriculture    
 supplying employment. Natural tree    
 cover reduced to small patches of     
 birch trees on valley sides.
