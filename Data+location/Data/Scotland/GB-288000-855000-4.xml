		<title>04NAIRN SHOPKEEPER'S THOUGHTS</title>
		<content> A number of local shopkeepers         
 interviewed felt that the opening of  
 the modern shopping centre in{        
{Inverness}had badly affected their    
 trade.Only one shopkeeper felt he had 
 benefited from the trade attracted by 
 the new{Templetons}supermarket.His    
 shop dealt in televisions,videos etc. 
 and he said that the personal         
 guaranteed service he offered allowed 
 him to compete with the larger        
 electrical stores.                    
   Several shopkeepers blamed the      
{rising rates}for the closing shops    
 although some admitted that the rise  
 in rates was in line with             
 inflation.One shopkeeper felt however 
 that little could be done to attract  
 trade back to{Nairn}because peoples   
 shopping habits have changed and as   
 long as they could afford to travel   
 the larger centres would gain.        </content>
