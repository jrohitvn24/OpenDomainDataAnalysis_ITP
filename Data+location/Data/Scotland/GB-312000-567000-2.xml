		<content> The{mild damp climate}here enables    
 grass to grow quickly and gives a long
 growing season, so that the farmer can
 graze his cattle out of doors for a   
 good part of the year this means  he  
 does not need to use as much expensive
 fodder to feed his animals.  Most of  
 the crops grown are{fodder crops}but  
 potatoes are also grown as a{cash}    
{crop.}                                
                                       
 Few workers are needed on a dairy farm
 because most of the work is done by   
 machinery. The workers though are tied
 to their work and cannot get much time
 off as the cattle have to be milked   
 twice daily, usually between 6.45 am  
 and 8.30 am and then again between    
 4.30 pm and 6.00 pm.  There is also   
 the responsibility of looking after   
 the cattle properly.
