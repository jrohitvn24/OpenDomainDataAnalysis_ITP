		<content>  Electricity arrived in July,1981. By 
 that time I was six years old.        
  We used to have paraffin lamps, Gas  
 lamps and candles which we bought in  
 Lochinver, a small village about 29km 
 away. If we ran out of paraffin, gas  
 or candles we spent the night in the  
 dark!                                 
  Before we had electricity I had my   
 own candle which I would light when I 
 wanted to leave the kitchen. It was   
 early to bed in the wintertime.       
  Now my mother has many electrical    
 appliances to help with the housework_
 a washing machine, tumble dryer, iron,
 dish_washer, hair dryer etc.          
  My father has escaped the morning    
 task of filling lamps.                
   I can use my computer and can read  
 till all hours. My bedtime is much    
 later now in the Winter now.
