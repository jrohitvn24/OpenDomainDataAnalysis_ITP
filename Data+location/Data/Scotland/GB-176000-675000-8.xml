		<title>08Rebuilding Ellary Bridge</title>
		<content> About half a mile down the Ellary road
 is a beautiful old stone bridge. But  
 it is too narrow, and the angle is    
 wrong for lorries bringing in hay,    
 fertilizer etc. and the cattle floats 
 going out with animals at sale times. 
 It was decided to build a replacement 
 bridge beside the old one.            
 The work, which involved some         
 blasting, started in May 1984 and took
 6 months. The new bridge is made of   
 steel girders and reinforced concrete,
 and has new approaches from the       
 single_track road on either side.     
 All through the rebuilding the old    
 stone bridge remained open and it     
 has now been restored and repointed.  
 It is from these 2 bridges that       
 Achahoish Graveyard can be reached    
 (see page 3 of the printed text).
