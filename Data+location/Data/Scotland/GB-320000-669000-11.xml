		<content>  His services too are unusual. On Good
 Friday 1985 he led a congregation of  
 about 80 people on a walk from Balerno
 to the middle of Edinburgh: A distance
 of 8 miles. They carried a large      
 wooden cross and on occasions stopped 
 and read extracts from the bible. On  
 Easter Day they had an egg hunt while 
 they drank wine and ate unleavened    
 bread which was baked by a lady in his
 congregation. They had this service in
 and around the T.U. hut. This is a    
 wooden hut near Hailesland Primary    
 School. At Christmas he takes children
 round houses to sing carols but they  
 do not collect money.                 
  Mr Brockie enjoys his work most of   
 the time. His greatest fear is nuclear
 bombs. He would like everyone to live 
 in peace and is hopeful that there    
 will be more churches like this.
