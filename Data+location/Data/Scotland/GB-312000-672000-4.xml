		<content> HILLWOOD QUARRY NEAR NEWBRIDGE        
                                       
 We interviewed a local resident who   
 lives beside Hillwood Quarry.We asked 
 her how the Quarry affects her        
 life.She told use that her windows    
 were always covered with dust,that she
 had to wash her washing at least 3    
 times, that her whole house shakes    
 when the Quarry  is blasting and the  
 last blast is at 7p.m.She thinks  150 
 lorries pass the house each day taking
 rough gravel and tarmac to the new    
 road on the Corstorphine outskirts of 
 Edinburgh.The dust causes sore eyes   
 and sore throats. It is impossible to 
 sit out in the sun or to grow fruit   
 and vegetables because of the white   
 dust which blows from the backs of    
 uncovered lorries.
