		<content> Bettyhill is a small village in the   
 Highland Region. Although its postal  
 address is By Thurso, Caithness, it is
 part of Sutherland District.  It is   
 made up of scattered houses with only 
 a few council houses marking the      
 village centre.  It has a remarkable  
 number of facilities for such a small 
 place - a combined primary/secondary  
 school, a post office cum shop, a     
 store, a caravan site two churches, a 
 public hall, a bank and a museum.     
 Many of the people provide local      
 government services - teachers,       
 roadmen, dustmen and policemen.  The  
 only large scale industry is at       
 Dounreay, twenty-five miles away.  A  
 small building firm employs six       
 people, and the Forestry Commission   
 employs twenty-three people from the  
 area.  Part time work is available    
 seasonally in the two hotels.         </content>
