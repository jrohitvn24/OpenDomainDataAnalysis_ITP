{TELEPHONE :}VIRTUALLY ALL HOMES HAVE A
 TELEPHONE AND 50% PREFERRED IT AS A   
 MEANS OF COMMUNICATION, SPEED AND     
 HANDINESS BEING THE REASONS.          
 INCREASINGLY MODEMS ARE BEING USED TO 
 ENABLE COMPUTERS TO COMMUNICATE WITH  
 EACH OTHER DIRECTLY.                  
{ POST :}ONLY 2% OF THOSE QUESTIONED   
 USED THE POST AS THEIR FAVOURITE      
 METHOD OF COMMUNICATION. MOST MAIL IS 
 BUSINESS_TYPE MAIL SUCH AS BILLS,     
 CIRCULARS, ETC.                       
{PERSONAL :}HALF THE SAMPLE PREFERRED  
 FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS FOR REASONS SUCH
 AS CLOSER CONTACT, CHEAPNESS AND      
 SIMPLICITY. HOWEVER PEOPLE TALK LESS  
 TO EACH OTHER NOW THAN IN PREVIOUS    
 GENERATIONS.
