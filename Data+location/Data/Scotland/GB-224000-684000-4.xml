		<title>04HOUSING IN THE RHU AREA.</title>
		<content> Characteristic of the housing of Rhu, 
 Shandon and Clynder is the cottage and
 and villa style of building           
 constructed of stone and slate set in 
 quaint gardens .Another notable       
 feature is the numerous mansion houses
 built mainly in the mid 19th century  
 as family homes or country residences 
 for the rich Glasgow merchants.These  
 have long sweeping driveways,often    
 lined on either side by mature        
 rhododendron bushes,leading up to the 
 main entrance.At the foot of the      
 drives stand the lodge and nearer to  
 the main house ,what would formerly   
 have been servants' quarters and the  
 stable block.Listed buildings include 
 the Church,Rhu House on the main road 
 and Ardenconnel House.The development 
 of Local Authority housing in Rhu     
 since the 2nd world War now accounts  
 for 16% of all homes in the village.  </content>
