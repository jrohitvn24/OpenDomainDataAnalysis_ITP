		<title>15TRANSPORT IN INVERKEILOR</title>
		<content> The block is divided by two main      
 transport routes.The A92 main         
 Dundee_Aberdeen road and the main     
 Dundee_Aberdeen railway line.There is 
 also a good network of minor roads.A  
 bus service operates on the A92 which 
 can take local people to Arbroath and 
 Montrose for shopping,but the railway 
 station at the village of Inverkeilor 
 has been disused for many years and   
 recently been dismolished.            
 We found that most people use a       
 private car to get around but the     
 buses are also well used.             
 The A92 is a busy road with a lot of  
 heavy traffic.This means that         
 Inverkeilor village main street is    
 always busy and there is a dangerous  
 corner at the north end of the        
 village.Plans have been made for the  
 road to by_pass the village to the    
 west.This should be built by 1988.    </content>
