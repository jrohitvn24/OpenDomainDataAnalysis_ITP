		<title>19TRANSPORT IN DOLPHINTON</title>
		<content> The railway had come and gone within  
 the past 150 years. The Caledonian    
 line from Carstairs met the N.B.      
 railway to Leadburn, the line linking 
 the two stations passing under the    
 road bridge. Passenger service on the 
 N.B. ceased in 1932 and on Cale, by   
 then L.M.S. in the 1940's. Buses to   
 Edinburgh and Biggar started around   
 1926 becoming the only public         
 transport on the demise of the        
 railways. The service is now reduced  
 to 7 buses per day in either          
 direction. This is mainly due to the  
 increase in private motoring, the     
 majority of households having at least
 one car, many commuting daily to      
 Edinburgh. School children are taken  
 by bus to Biggar or Peebles. All goods
 to and from the village are           
 tranpsorted by road, and we have the  
 services of a mobile bank and library.</content>
