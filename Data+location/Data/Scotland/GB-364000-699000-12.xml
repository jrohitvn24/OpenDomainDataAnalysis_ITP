		<title>12Ecology - Nesting Birds</title>
		<content> The auks are perhaps the most         
 spectacular group nesting on the      
 island with the guillemots and        
 razorbills nestig on the sheer cliffs 
 while the puffins nest in burrows on  
 the top.                              
 The Kittiwake is a small gull which   
 builds a large nest of debris on the  
 most inaccessible ledges. The gull    
 which has caused most comment in the  
 past 20 years is the Herring gull. A  
 highly adaptable predator its numbers 
 have been doubling every 6 years. In  
 1972 there were an estimated 42000    
 birds on the island and faced with the
 prospect of large parts of the island 
 becoming devegetated and soilless the 
 NCC embarked on a carefully planed    
 cull. By 1976 there were about 5000.  
 Other nesting birds include eider     
 duck, oystercatcher, shag, fulmar and 
 lapwing.                              </content>
