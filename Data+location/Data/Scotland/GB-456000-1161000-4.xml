		<title>04A WHALSAY WEDDING 1/2</title>
		<content>  A Whalsay wedding is always          
 interesting.After the marriage        
 ceremony at the church the guests,up  
 to 800 invited from on the isle,go to 
 the public hall.There the Whalsay     
 band play.The 10 or more men of the   
 band take turns to play.The adults    
 always dance but children dance in the
 Boston 2 step,St Bernard's Waltz,and  
 Gay Gordons.Other dances include the  
 Eightsome Reel,Lancers and Quadrille. 
  There is a cookhouse where about 8   
 men cut up perhaps 12 sheep which are 
 then cooked in great big pots over an 
 open peat fire.The pots of mutton are 
 taken to the hall for the guests to   
 eat.Supper is served in a side-room,up
 to 8 sittings needed.With the mutton  
 are served bannocks(made of flour,    
 water,salt and baking soda) which are 
 dipped in the mutton"bro",gravy.Also  
 served are fancies,juice and tea.     </content>
