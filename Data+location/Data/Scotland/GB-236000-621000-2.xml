  It is very often the case that place 
 names reflect past history. Dalmilling
 district's name is derived from the   
 French{"Dalmulin",}meaning{"the mill  
{in the field",}because from earliest  
 times there was a mill,which is still 
 in existence to_day, on the north     
 bank of the River Ayr.                
  In ancient times the parish was known
 as{Senechar _"Sean Chear",in Gaelic,  
 meaning{"old fort".}Sanquhar,as it is 
 now known may have been a fortress in 
 Roman days.                           
{ Saint Quivox Parish}itself owes its  
 name to{Saint Kevoc,}the patron saint 
 of the church, which served the people
 of the parish, bounded south by the   
 River Ayr and east, west and north by 
 the parishes of Tarbolton, Monkton and
 Newton respectively.
