		<content> About half of our area is open        
 country and most of the rest could be 
 described as suburban residential. It 
 is almost on the edge of the Edinburgh
 city boundary and it is well served   
 for fast access to the town centre by 
 road, while still affording quick     
 access to the airport, part of which  
 lies within our Domesday Block. Many  
 of the houses are built on a hill and 
 have interesting views over to the    
 Forth Road and Railway Bridges to the 
 north. People coming to the capital   
 city from the west and north of       
 Scotland pass through this block. Most
 of the houses have been built in the  
 last 50 years, and some building is   
 still going on where there is land    
 available for the purpose. Most of    
 the shops are in the main street of   
 Corstorphine, which used to be a      
 village.                              </content>
