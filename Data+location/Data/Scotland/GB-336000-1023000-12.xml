		<title>12A local shop in Evie</title>
		<content>   Jock Spence is a local shopkeeper,  
 who has lived in Evie all his life.   
 He has a bar with his shop and both   
 are called Mistra.  He has worked in  
 local shops for 34 years and has seen 
 many changes.                         
   Mr Spence thought that there are    
 fewer customers using the local shops.
 They all flock to Kirkwall to the     
 bigger stores and supermarkets.       
   Sweets used to be very cheap.       
 Caramels, which are 34p per quarter   
 nowadays, were 2 old pence per quarter
 Boiled sweets were very popular and   
 chocolate was quite scarce.           
   Children got very little pocket     
 money.  People didn't have much spare 
 money after the war.  Mr Spence       
 remembered boys helping to fish for   
 lobsters to get a bit more pocket     
 money. They used to meet for a yarn or
 to play football.                     </content>
