		<title>04INTERVIEW: DOUNBY PENSIONER</title>
		<content> Mrs.Mary Stockan lives in Dounby and  
 has done so since 1948. Before that   
 she lived in Harray Post Office, just 
 along the road. She is an Old Age     
 Pensioner.                            
 The biggest{changes in Dounby}are the 
 new school and the amount of new      
 houses which have been built. This she
 likes, and would hope to see Dounby   
 expand even more.                     
 Not all things have changed for the   
 better however. She does not like     
 speeding cars going past the house and
 thinks that there is a lot more       
 drinking in pubs and bars than there  
 used to be.                           
 She would rather be a child now, than 
 when she was growing up, as they had  
 none of the privileges children have  
 now like Gym, sports and Instrumental 
 Tuition. She will probably live in    
 Dounby for the rest of her life.      </content>
