		<content> THE OPENING OF THE MOTORWAY HAS HELPED
 TO ATTRACT NEW INDUSTRY TO THE TOWN   
 AND TO ENCOURAGE THE CONSTRUCTION OF  
 NEW PRIVATE HOUSING ESTATES ON THE OUT
 SKIRTS OF THE TOWN AS MANY PEOPLE WHO 
 TRAVEL IN THE COURSE OF THEIR WORK e.g
 SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE ATTRACTED BY
 THE EASE OF ACCESS TO THE MOTORWAY    
 SYSTEM.IMMEDIATELY TO THE SOUTH OF THE
 TOWN RUNS THE A71 THE MAIN AYR TO     
 EDINBURGH TRUNK ROAD WHICH MEANS      
 LARKHALL BENEFITS FROM ITS LOCATION AT
 THE JUNCTION OF MAJOR NORTH-SOUTH AND 
 EAST_SOUTH ROUTES.                    
 THE PRESENCE OF MINING IN THE PAST    
 MEANT THAT THE AREA WAS WELL SERVED BY
 RAILWAYS.HOWEVER WITH THE DECLINE OF  
 THE INDUSTRY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF   
 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ROAD TRANSPORT     
 LARKHALLS RAILWAYS WERE CLOSED IN     
 1968.
