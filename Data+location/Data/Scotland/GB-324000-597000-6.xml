		<title>06ROAD HAULAGE AT ESKDALEMUIR</title>
		<content>  With the coming of motorised         
 transport the old custom of driving   
 cattle and sheep to market on foot    
 died out.Eventually in Eskdalemuir    
 this resulted in the establishment ,on
 one of the centrally situated farms,  
 of a small haulage and contrcting     
 business.  Managed by members of the  
 family assisted by fellow workers     
 whose homes are it the valley. This   
 firm provides a variety of services.  
  Lorries, with floats or containers   
 ,transport sheep and cttle to the     
 vrios markets.Sheep are sometimes     
 taken to "winter" on lower ground     
 elsewhere. Fertilisers and foodstuffs 
 are carried gravel is excavated from  
 the river bed for use at building     
 sites and reservoir stations.Roads for
 farming or forestry are cut out of the
 hillside and firmed with quarried     
 road-metal.                           </content>
