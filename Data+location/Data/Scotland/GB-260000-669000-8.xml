		<content>{Saturday Afternoon}                   
                                       
 In the afternoon my brother Anthony   
 takes one of the many buses which pass
 regularly through Bishopbriggs into   
 Glasgow. This is the advantage of     
 living in a suburb near a city, you   
 can enjoy all a city has to offer     
 while still living in a rural         
 environment. At 1:30pm. my dad and I  
 go to Celtic Park in Glasgow to watch 
 football. We travel by taxi as it is  
 cheaper and quicker than travelling on
 various buses.                        
 My gran, mum, and sister take a train 
 into Glasgow to shop in the many      
 department stores which can be found  
 there.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
