		<title>14Kirkconnel:The Gala</title>
		<content> Like many villages and towns with a   
 mining connection we have an annual   
 Gala (pronounced as in alarm)         
 The week-long celebration in the      
 middle of June includes sports, cycle 
 races,five-a-side football,talent     
 contest,fashion show,fire-works etc., 
 and culminates on the Saturday        
 with a parade of floats,which this    
 year numbered 20, bands and people in 
 fancy dress.When the parade has toured
 the village it makes for Riverside    
 Park, the home of Kello Rovers....the 
 local Junior League F.C., where a     
 picnic is held and various            
 entertainments are enjoyed.First      
 however the Crowning of the Gala Queen
 takes place. Each year a new queen is 
 elected from and by the senior girls  
 in the local Primary School.She is    
 supported by two attendants and a     
 page.                                 </content>
