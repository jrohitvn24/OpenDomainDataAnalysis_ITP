		<title>02    THE KILSYTH HILLS</title>
		<content> These hills, which form much of our   
 block, were formed by lava.This molten
 rock first appeared between two       
 million and four million years ago.   
 They are part of a range of hills     
 known as the{Campsie Fells}which run  
 for over 20 miles across Central      
 Scotland.They reach a height of over  
 450 metres,and can be seen from       
 Glasgow,17 miles away.                
  The hills are used for many purposes.
 The upper slopes form rough grazing   
 for sheep,with cattle on the lush,    
 lower levels.The open nature of the   
 hills is broken by only a few patches 
 of deciduous woods.                   
   A few old quarries and mine shafts  
 can still be seen,and a reservoir     
 which stores fresh water.             
   The hills are also a good place for 
 leisure                               
 e.g.walking,fishing,bird-watching.    </content>
