		<title>10ROSLIN GLEN NEAR PENICUIK</title>
		<content> At one time this was a flourishing    
 coal mining area. There was a         
 gunpowder factory in Roslin Glen which
 made explosives for the mines and     
 ammunition. Roslin Glen was chosen    
 because it was a secluded wooded area 
 with running water. The buildings     
 (which can still be seen) were set    
 into the hillside and spread over a   
 large area in case of accidents. The  
 workers used brass hammers and nails  
 to prevent sparks which might cause   
 an explosion. Despite these           
 precautions there were a few          
 accidents.   The gunpowder was        
 transported by rail to Leith Docks.In 
 1926 the factory was taken over by    
 I.C.I. When the area around Roslin    
 started to subside (due to the mining)
 the factory moved to Ardeer in the    
 west of Scotland. Roslin Glen has now 
 been turned into a country park.      </content>
