    In{April}the young sheep are       
 dipped, dosed and their horns are     
{branded}with an{"S"}which stands for  
{Stewart.}When the lambing is underway 
 the shepherds are very busy, because  
 the ewes have to be inspected every   
 day.Some of the ewes have their lambs 
 on the hill,the ones that don't, are  
 taken to{Auchlany}Greens.A fortnight  
 later the ewes which haven't yet      
 lambed are taken down to{Struan.      
    All the lambs are dipped given     
 medicine, and their ears are marked by
 cutting off a bit. The lambs are      
 dipped because they have ticks on them
 and the ticks suck the lambs          
 blood.A tick doesn't do them much     
 harm, but it spreads diseases like
