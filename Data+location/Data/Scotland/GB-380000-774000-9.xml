		<content> Unemployment is less noticeable here  
 than in the cities. There are only two
 men unemployed.  Most people are      
 engaged in{agriculture}- farmers are  
 self-employed, male workers are       
 employed full-time. {Women}work       
 part-time during seasons, picking     
 flowers, harvesting bulbs and         
 potatoes, berry-picking, roguing      
 grain, clearing stones from fields,and
 one or two women look after the calves
 on the dairy farms.  The fish factory 
 in Inverbervie employs several of our 
 women and girls. Some people{travel}as
 far as Dyce, Aberdeen to work,        
 and at least one man works off-shore. 
 There are a few{pensioners,}all       
 active, and most working much as      
 before retirement. Local{children}of  
 thirteen and over help with seasonal  
 work during school holidays.
