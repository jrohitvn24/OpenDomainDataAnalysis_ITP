		<title>07Transport In Newburgh</title>
		<content> Cars and buses are both used for      
 transport in this area.The bus service
 run by the Regional Council is limited
 because of the small population.It is 
 mainly used by older people.The 52    
 seater buses used are normally        
 sufficient.Many families have more    
 than one car and since most people    
 have to leave the village to go to    
 work the roads are busy.Further       
 traffic is added because of vehicles  
 passing through on their way North or 
 South.At certain agricultural seasons 
 the traffic is increased because of   
 more farm vehicles.There are two lorry
 companies in Newburgh.T.N.T.which     
 stands for Thomas Nationwide          
 Transport carries goods all over the  
 country and guarantees fast           
 delivery.The other firm, Cruickshanks,
 works locally,carrying cattle to and  
 from the market in Aberdeen.          </content>
