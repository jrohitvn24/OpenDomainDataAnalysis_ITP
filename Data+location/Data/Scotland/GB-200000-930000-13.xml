		<title>13WINTER CONDITIONS</title>
		<content>   The worst winter I can remember was 
 1983-4.  There had been a severe frost
 and a lot of snow.  On January 1st one
 of our electricity poles was hit by   
 lightning. Our house had a power cut  
 which lasted for four and a half days.
  The first day we managed to cook our 
 tea on the coal fire but the next day 
 we got the loan of a gas cooker from a
 neighbour.                            
   This area is very exposed and often 
 people remember the severe gales      
 rather than the effects of snow.  In  
 this same winter there were Force 12  
 winds battering the coastline. Several
 caravans were completed flattened or  
 overturned, luckily they were empty at
 the time.                             
   This last winter there was hardly   
 any snow.In fact the whole of February
 was completely snow-free. It was quite
 annoying not being able to play in it.</content>
