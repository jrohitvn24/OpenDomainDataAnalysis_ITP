		<content> Most children, on returning home from 
 school will have{homework}exercises to
 complete. In Primary 7 this usually   
 means about 30 minutes work per night.
 Afterwards, they might go out to play 
 or watch T.V.{In the summer}they might
 go to the seaside and{in the winter   
 they might sledge on the surrounding  
 hilly slopes.                         
 Children who live in West Kilbride    
 could never complain that there is    
 "nothing to do." There are many{clubs 
{and societies}which are well attended 
 and most families travel several miles
 to go swimming, ice_skating, etc.     
 Children receive approximately Â£2     
{pocket money}each week so they are    
 able to afford to buy sweets, records,
 comics, etc. Many families also have  
 "home entertainments" _ video         
 recorders, stereo systems, home       
 computers, etc.                       </content>
