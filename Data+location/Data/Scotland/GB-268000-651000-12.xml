   Since the area is largely rural, the
 number of amenities is small and conc-
 entrated in the area of residential   
 housing.{                             
{SHOPS}                                
   There is one small purpose built    
 centre at Woodhead. The rest of the   
 shops are either the "corner shop"    
 type of general store in the housing  
 estates or shops built in Strathaven  
 Road. There is no supermarket or large
 foodstore in the area.                
{TYPES OF ESTABLISHMENT}               
   Most shops are general stores or    
 newsagents. There is a number of carry
 out food shops and an assortment of   
 DIY shops, greengrocers, etc. These   
 are all run by their owners and their 
 families. The carry out food shops    
 are, with one exception, operated by  
 Italian families.                     </content>
