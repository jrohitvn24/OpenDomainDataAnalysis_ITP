<title>40BROCH AT BUCHLYVIE - updated 2011</title>
<content>

There have been no further excavations at the broch site but villagers and school children became more aware of what a broch was when the DVD "The Broch - a Scottish Phenomenon" was shown in the local museum, schools and clubs. There being no suitable site in Buchlyvie, and thanks to the generousity of the Forestry Commission, a section of a broch was built in Strathyre by drystone dykers using ancient methods of construction. These same dykers built a circular herb garden outside the Buchlyvie Medical Centre. This is now referred to as "the broch" and may be used as an outdoor waiting room.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
