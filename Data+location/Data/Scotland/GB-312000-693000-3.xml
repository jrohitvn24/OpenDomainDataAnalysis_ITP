		<content> Kelty musical produces a yearly show  
 ranging from light opera to musicals, 
 the venue Carnegie Hall, Dunfermline. 
 The production lasts for a week and is
 usually a sell out.  Not only does    
 Kelty have a brass band, it also has a
 pipe band, both appear at the annual  
 gala along with Kelty majorettes.     
 Gardening allotments still flourish on
 the outskirts which produce many      
 exhibits for Kelty gardening show held
 at the Moray Institute.  This         
 Institute is the venue for many       
 exhibitions.  The most recent "Kelty  
 Past and Present".  Kelty has no      
 cinema  showing films.  It is being   
 used as a "Bingo Hall".  An art shop  
 provides the community with art       
 materials and framing facilities.  The
 shop also sells original oil and water
 colour paintings done by local        
 artists.                              </content>
