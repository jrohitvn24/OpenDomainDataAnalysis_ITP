		<content>  Presently, the main tourist season   
 runs from Easter to the end of        
 October, but there are plans to make  
 Pitlochry an all-year resort.         
  The  chief development is the plan   
 for a new Recreation Centre which     
 would include a swimming pool, sports 
 hall, artificial ski facilities etc.  
 The nearby Dundarach Hotel is to be   
 converted into a health farm, and     
 there are also plans to include       
 facilities for conference and         
 exhibition purposes in the complex.   
  The finance for this venture is      
 available from various councils,      
 trusts etc and according to Mr Penker,
 Chairman of the local Tourist         
 Association, is well on the way to    
 fruition. Further employment would of 
 course result from the developments.
