		<title>10DEPENDENCE ON ROAD TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>{The population}of this rural area is  
 completely dependent on road          
 transport. Fortunately the area is    
 well served by roads, the A699 from St
 Boswells to Selkirk crossing from     
 north-east to west and branching south
 are the B6359 from Melrose &amp; the B6453
 leading through Midlem to Lilliesleaf.
{Roads}are kept in excellent condition 
 by the Border Region, and they are    
 rapidly cleared and gritted during    
 snowy weather. During recent flooding,
 the Council were immediately on the   
 scene to do the necessary repairs.    
{Many}of the region's residents are car
 owners, but for the old-aged          
 pensioners of Midlem for example, the 
 daily post-bus is their only means of 
 travelling to Galashiels. Similarly,  
 Peel General Hospital can only be     
 reached twice weekly by the Border    
 Courier Bus.                          </content>
