		<title>19Hempriggs Loch</title>
		<content> This is a shallow freshwater loch of  
 area 1sq.km.It is the only one of five
 similar lochs that lies within the    
 block.To the N. the site consists of  
 old flooded peat cuttings and a float-
 ing net of sedges and mosses which    
 reach into the loch.The dry ridges are
 dominated by heathers and a colony of 
 black-headed gulls breeds in the swamp
 edge.To the S. there is an area of    
 marsh but grazing animals disturb the 
 vegetation.Further S. the wetter areas
 are rich in plant species.The stony   
 bottom provides a good habitat for    
 flatworms and insect larvae and these 
 together with the vegetation support a
 large trout population and wintering  
 birds such as Widgeon,Mallards and    
 Swans.The loch is fished from the     
 shore and from boats.At one time the  
 water was used to make whisky by      
 Pulteneytown Distillery in Wick.      </content>
