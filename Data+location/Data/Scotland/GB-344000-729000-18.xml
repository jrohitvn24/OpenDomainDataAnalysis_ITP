		<content>    On{Easter Sunday}the Broughty Ferry
 children go egg rolling,signifying the
 rolling of the stone from Jesus'tomb. 
 They receive chocolate eggs,and they  
 also boil normal eggs and paint them  
 many colours.These eggs are rolled in 
 many different places.                
   On October 31st{Hallowe'en }the     
 children go "guising."For this they   
 dress themselves up in many weird and 
 wonderful disguises.They then approach
 a house and ask the occupants if they 
 wish to have guisers.If the occupants 
 agree,they recite poems,sing songs or 
 tell jokes for which they are         
 rewarded.Another{Hallowe'en}custom    
 is ducking for apples.Here basins     
 full of water are filled with         
 apples.Whoever is ducking kneels      
 before the basin and tries to reach   
 an apple with their mouth.
