 breakfast of tea and toast.I go to the
 bus-stop at 8:00am to catch the school
 bus at 8:00am.I travel 18km to school 
 and get there about 9:00am.Lessons

 mins.After another three periods I go

 1:50pm and afternoon lessons continue 
 till 3:50pm.I get home at 4:20pm and  
 do homework for up to an hour.After

 my Grandads who lives at {Scatness }

 used for crops,and I help him.On
