      When I get up I dress myself,    
 wash myself and brush my teeth. I get 
 my school bag ready then I eat my     
 breakfast. I usually have cereal or   
 toast. Then I brush my hair and go to 
 school. I go in a car to school.      
 School starts at half past nine. We do
 spelling and mental arithmetic which  
 are both tests. We have an interval at
 twenty to eleven. Then we do Maths and
 English. We have our dinner at quarter
 to one, then we go outside to play. We
 have teachers who visit us through the
 week to teach us art, knitting, music 
 and physical education. We have a     
 computer that we play games on and do 
 projects. We go home from school at   
 half past three by car.               
      When I get home I watch          
 Childrens' Television, which is a lot 
 of programmes for children.           </content>
