 Public transport to and from this area
 is pathetic. So much so that all      
 children must be transported by       
 private buses to their Secondary      
 Schools.                              
 Children from south of the Primary    
 School are carried by contract taxi   
 and those from north and east come by 
 contract bus.                         
                                       
 Despite the fact that the area is     
 served by two bus Companies, in a day 
 there are only four buses to and from 
 Perth. The latest of these goes in at 
 15.35pm and returns at 17.45pm. So    
 anyone who does not have their own    
 transport is deprived of all the      
 social and recreational facilities of 
 Perth.
