		<content> The high land in our area is          
 generally good hill grazing and the   
 low land is very well fertilised and  
 is good growing land. The high land is
 also mainly heathery and stoney. We   
 interviewed Cathy Williamson who      
 said,when we asked her about how many 
 sheep she had in the area,that it all 
 depended on how severe the winter was 
 because she could lose a lot of sheep 
 or in a mild winter she might only    
 lose two or three sheep.When we asked 
 her about how she worked with the     
 sheep she told us that they had to be 
 dipped in sheep dip,they also had to  
 be clipped , they have to be dosed,   
 marked with  clips in their ears -    
 these are called lug marks. In the    
 spring time they have to deal with the
 strains of the lambing. Crops grown   
 include,potatoes (tatties), turnips   
 (neeps) and cabbage (keel).           </content>
