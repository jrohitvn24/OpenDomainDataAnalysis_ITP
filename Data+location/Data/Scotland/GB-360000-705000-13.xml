		<content> The Gardens of Crail.                 
 The Crail and District Horticultural  
 Society was founded in 1951 and each  
 year they hold a garden competition,  
 flower show and a chrysanthemum and   
 vegetable show.  Approx. 500 entries  
 received 1984.  In past years Crail   
 gardeners have specialised in         
 achieving high standards of flower    
 growing.  Now some concentrate on     
 vegetables, again with excellent      
 results.  Recently Bob Roger's name   
 appeared in the Guinness Bookof       
 Records for having grown the world's  
 largest onion.  Since then his brother
 Bill has done better and now holds the
 title.  Crail one the Britain in Bloom
 competition in 1984.  Public Gardens  
 are neat and tidy and popular.  There 
 is a well stocked Garden Centre.
