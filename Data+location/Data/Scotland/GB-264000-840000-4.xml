		<title>04NESS SIDE HOUSE</title>
		<content>    The original mansion house was     
 built in 1883 by Mackintosh of        
 Holme but the present one was built by
 Joseph Godman in 1960.                
{   NESS SIDE COTTAGE}is a ghillie's   
 house. We saw five one_week_old       
 mallard ducklings being looked after  
 by a black hen. Their mother deserted 
 the eggs and the hen hatched them.    
 When the ducklings return to the River
 Ness the hen cannot follow them.      
{   MILTON OF NESS SIDE}is 250 years   
 old and has been renovated.           
    At{NESS SIDE FARM}we saw 2 stones  
 and a tree which are boundary lines   
 for fishing. Also near the farm is a  
 hut where deer used to be chilled. It 
 belonged to the Red Deer Commission.
