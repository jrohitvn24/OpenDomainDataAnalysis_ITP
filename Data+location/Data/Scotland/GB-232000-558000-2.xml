		<content>  We set off from {school}round our    
 block to see what the countryside     
 looked like. First we stopped outside 
 the Tarff House Hotel to look at the  
 ruins of the 300 year old {church}in  
 the graveyard. We crossed the Tarff on
 its way to meet the Bladnoch over     
 Johnston's Bridge. Round the corner   
 was a small deciduous wood called{    
 the{Crosherie Plantation.}We went to  
 Boreland Fell Quarry started in the   
 1930's but no longer in use. It is    
 hoped to open it again in the near    
 future. In a field between the river  
 and the main road was a{motte}once    
 used as a court hill for trials. In a 
 field nearby was the {White Cairn,}an 
 overgrown mound which might have been 
 an ancient burial ground. We climbed  
 Doon Hill to get a view all around.   
 Our last stop was at Wood Hill to see 
 where{Mindork Castle}once stood.      </content>
