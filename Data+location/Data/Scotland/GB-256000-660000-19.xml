		<title>19Railways in Cathcart</title>
		<content> There are two railway stations in     
 blocks 58oo 6ooo, 58oo 61oo Cathcart  
 and Mount Florida. These stations are 
 for trains which runs within the      
 Glasgow area and there are two        
 different services. One operates      
 between Glasgow Central and Neilston, 
 the other is a circular route from and
 to Glasgow Central.                   
  Daily 36 trains pass Cathcart Station
 going to Neilston (no trains on a     
 Sunday), 37 from Neilston (none on a  
 Sunday), 18 trains from Central       
 Station via Shawlands and 18 in the   
 opposite direction (none on a Sunday).
  In a survey it was found that the    
 trains were used mainly by women, the 
 people generally use the trains once  
 or twice a week and that they are     
 happy with the service provided. The  
 service is used by people who are     
 going to work or going shopping.      </content>
