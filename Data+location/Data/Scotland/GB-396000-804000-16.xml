		<title>16GIRDLENESS LIGHTHOUSE 2</title>
		<content> is subject to the notorious sea haar. 
 This fog sweeps in off the sea often  
 during warm,sunny weather smothering  
 the town in a cold,grey dank blanket. 
 Then the sound of 'Moanin Minnie', the
 lighthouse's foghorn is regularily    
 heard bellowing across Aberdeen Bay   
 and in parts of the city as well as   
 far out to sea.It is also commonly    
 heard during the winter months.       
 If one is standing too close at the   
 time the noise is deafening and one   
 can feel the ground and buildings     
 vibrate.                              
 The land to the rear, now part of the 
 Walker Park, was originally granted to
 the lighthouse-keeper to graze his    
 herd of cows on.                      
 Unlike many of the lighthouses today  
 this one has not been automated and   
 there is still a lighthouse-keeper who
 occassionaly shows visitors round.    </content>
