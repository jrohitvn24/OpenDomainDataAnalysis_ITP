		<title>09PEOPLE OF RHU AND DISTRICT</title>
		<content> In our area we have people of many    
 varied walks of life.There are those  
 whose families have lived in the      
 district for many generations,those   
 who have married into the community   
 and families that have moved here in  
 recent years.Reasons behind this      
 influx of newcomers include:1)many    
 have come to work in Base_related jobs
 2)as it is a pleasant area in which to
 live people choose to settle here e.g.
 elderly people like to retire here,   
 commuters to Glasgow buy homes and    
 those who enjoy sailing are enticed by
 the various facilities on offer.Until 
 recently,however,many young people had
 been forced to move to find suitable  
 accommodation but with the allocation 
 of more council homes to this age     
 group and the development of the more 
 reasonably priced,compact Broseley    
 estate, this trend is being reversed. </content>
