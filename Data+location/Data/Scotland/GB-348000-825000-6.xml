		<title>06Rhynie Gala</title>
		<content> The Rhynie Gala takes place every year
 when we get our summer holidays.   In 
 the Rhynie Gala things take place like
 football, races, tug of war, and      
 games.   There has been two Rhynie    
 Galas.   The third Rhynie Gala will   
 take place in about 6 weeks.   Last   
 year the football teams were trying to
 win the little medals and the team    
 that won was Rhynie Rovers and after  
 the football that day Rhynie Rovers   
 were playing Lumsden and Rhynie Rovers
 won.   After that we went  over to the
 Army and showed the people pictures of
 helicopters and at the end of the Gala
 the people who won something had to go
 up and collect it and at night we had 
 a dance.
