		<content> LIVING LESS HIGH IN EAST KILBRIDE     
   In our area there are many different
 types of houses such as semi-detached,
 detached, terraced, bungalows and     
 cottages. The most common type is the 
 terraced. This is because the         
 Development Corporation have built    
 more terraced houses than any other   
 type.                                 
   East Kilbride is a pleasant place to
 live as the Parks Department are      
 always planting more trees and more   
 flowers and the Development           
 Corporation have planned the houses   
 not in straight rows but in           
 interesting layouts. Most houses in   
 East Kilbride are situated around a   
 park or play areas so that there is a 
 place for children to play.           
   Because more people are moving to   
 East Kilbride the Development Corpor- 
 ation are having to build more houses.</content>
