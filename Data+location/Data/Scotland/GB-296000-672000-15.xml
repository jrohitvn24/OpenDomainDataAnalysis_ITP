		<title>15Torphichen Civic Week 1985</title>
		<content> Although Torphichen Gala Day has been 
 in existence for many years the Civic 
 Week has only recently started. The   
 Civic Week is the week leading up to  
 the Gala Day. It is a week of varied  
 events and lots of fun. The 1985 Civic
 Week started with a Gymkhana on the   
 Saturday followed by a Pet show on the
 Monday where children under 16 brought
 their pets to be judged by a stranger 
 to the village. This is to avoid any  
 accusations of favouritism. For the   
 first time there was a Fancy Dress    
 Football Match between the young men  
 of the village who had to dress up in 
 fancy dress and the Keep Fit Class who
 wore proper football strips. The men  
 had all sorts of tricks up their      
 sleeves such as water pistols, spray  
 streamers and powder puffs. On the    
 Thursday evening there was a Treasure 
 Hunt and later on there was a disco.  </content>
