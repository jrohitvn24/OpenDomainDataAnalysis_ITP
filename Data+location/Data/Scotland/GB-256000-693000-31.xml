Garden Estate is an agricultural estate.  The main house was built of stone taken from the demolition of the Tower of Garden in 1749. The front was added in 1830 in the Georgian style. The original estate was 3500 acres but is now 3000 acres, mostly tenanted farms and the estate includes the village of Arnprior. The house was bought by Sir John Stirling who was given the title of Lord Garden.&lt;br />&lt;br />Buildings at Ballamenoch now house The Green Gallery.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
