		<content> Most homes share in the commmunity    
 life of the town with members of many 
 families associated with the          
 activities of the town. Although there
 is a little unemployment and a few one
 parent families in the town the       
 quality of life is high. More and more
 people are buying fast foods but there
 is still a great interest in home     
 cooking and the Women's Rural         
 Institute and Cookery classes are well
 attended. With the prosperity of the  
 two health shops people are tending to
 have more nutritious food.People are  
 made aware of home and farm safety by 
 Health and Safety rules.Mr Robert     
 Wilson of Old Glasgow Road this year  
 was awarded a M.B.E. for his          
 contribution to Factory Safety. Many  
 families have dogs, cats, birds, small
 animals and fish. The pet shop Animal 
 Magic supplies goods for these.       </content>
