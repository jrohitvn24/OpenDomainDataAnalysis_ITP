		<title>02Sailing Club Dalgety Bay.</title>
		<content> The Sailing Club with its well        
 furnished Club House occupies a large 
 area of the foreshore. Many people are
 members of the Dalgety Bay Sailing    
 Club. Over the last year membership   
 has risen and many people own their   
 own craft which they moor in the new  
 harbour during the summer months.     
 During the winter months boats are    
 kept in sheds or in owners driveways. 
 The Sailing Club caters for the needs 
 of experienced sailors as well as     
 beginners. Lessons are available for  
 beginners given by qualified          
 instructors. To learn the basic skills
 of sailing inexperienced sailors      
 normally use a sheltered cove which   
 local sailors call Optimists Bay. The 
 Club also runs many social events     
 throughout the year such as raft      
 races, barbeques and discos.
