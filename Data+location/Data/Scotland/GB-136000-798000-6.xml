		<title>06RHUM COMMUNITY HALL</title>
		<content> This hall sits at the head of the bay.
 In the Rhum Community Hall there are  
 sometimes slide shows about the island
 so visitors can see them. The         
 Archaeologists also hold slide shows  
 about their work.                     
 Feature films are shown once a month. 
 There are often ceilidhs where people 
 enjoy dancing. The biggest dance is   
 the New Year Ceilidh. Near the end of 
 this everyone sings and plays music.  
 There is also something to eat and    
 drink. At the normal ceilidh people do
 not have something to eat.            
 Occasionally cruise ships call at Rhum
 and people come ashore to have a look 
 round. Then they come into the hall   
 where locals serve food and drink.    
 At Christmas a special party is held  
 for the children where the adults play
 the music for the games and they make 
 the food.                             </content>
