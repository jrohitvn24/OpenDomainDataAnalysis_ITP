		<content> MOST OF THE FISHERMEN IN ST ABBS ARE  
 INSHORE FISHERS. THEY GO OUT EVERY    
 DAY TO CATCH LOBSTERS AND CRABS. TO DO
 THIS THEY USE CRIBS. CRIBS ARE MADE   
 OF WOOD AND NET. THEY ARE SHAPED LIKE 
 A TUNNEL WITH THE NET STRETCHED       
 OVER THE HOOPS OF WOOD AND METAL.THERE
 ARE TWO HOLES ON EACH  SIDE OF THE    
 CRIB FOR THE SHELLFISH TO GO IN. THEY 
 CANT GET OUT AS THE HOLE SLOPES UP.   
 THE CRIBS ARE BAITED WITH ROTTEN FISH.
 USUALLY IN A SMALL BOAT THEY SHOOT A  
 FLEET OF 35 CRIBS BUT THERE CAN BE    
 AS MANY AS 65 IN A FLEET.MOST         
 FISHERMEN SHOOT 3 FLEETS OF CRIBS.FROM
 ONE SHOOT THAY CAN GET CATCH 3 BOXES  
 OF LOBSTER AND 5 BOXES OF CRABS. IF   
 THEY CATCH SOME FISH IN THE CRIBS THEY
 CAN USE IT FOR BAITING THE NEXT       
 FLEET.THE BEST TIME FOR CATCHING      
 LOBSTERS IS IN AUTUMN.
