		<content>   Mrs Jean Woodburn, who works at the 
 Ward-Toll Nursery, has written 4      
{pantomime scripts.}"Aladdin II",      
 "Fairy Steps", "Beauty and the        
 Beanstalk" and "Cinderella". She got  
 the idea of doing a pantomime after   
 seeing a school concert. The 1986     
 pantomime is to be "Off-White &amp; the   
 Seven Dwarfs". There will be 3 nightly
 performances with donations going to  
 charity. Last year's Pantomime was    
 about Aladdin when his daughters had  
 grown up. One married the Geni. Some  
 village children were in the cast, as 
 well as one of the teachers.          
   In the{swing park}we have a seesaw, 
 slide, roundabout, climbing frame,    
 rocket, 2 baby swings, 4 big swings, 3
 tunnels and a "Monkey Puzzle" frame.  
 We play{"Monkey Puzzle Tig".}1 person 
 goes "het". You have to go all over   
 the frame so that you are not caught. </content>
