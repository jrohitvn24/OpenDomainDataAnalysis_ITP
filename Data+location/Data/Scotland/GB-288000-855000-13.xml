		<content>{THE B.M.X.TRACK                       
 A{B.M.X.}is a bike which has 20inch   
 wheels You can use it as a race bike  
 or as a freestyle bike If you are     
 going to use it as a race bike the    
 idea is to make the bike as light as  
 possible You can do this by{taking the
{reflectors off and the front brake off
 The freestyle{B.M.X}is different it   
 has to have a{front brake}to do front 
 wheel tricks The Nairn B.M.X track was
 built on a spot of ground that wasnt  
 used much at the riverside The track  
 is three metres wide and has hill     
 areas built into it to do straight    
 jumps It also has a feature called a  
 quarter pipe which is built on a metal
 structure and allows arial acrobatics 
 by the cyclist.
