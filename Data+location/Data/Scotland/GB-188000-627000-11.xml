		<title>11Shiskine Fire Brigade</title>
		<content>{Shiskine Fire Brigade serves Shiskine,
{Blackwaterfoot,Kilpatrick and Torbeg. 
 They used to have a  Landrover which  
 was able to carry water.They got a new
 Ford van which cannot carry water. The
 members feel they would rather have   
 the old Landrover back as it was more 
 efficient than the Ford van.          
 There are round about eight men in the
 Shiskine Brigade.The men in the fire  
 brigade do not carry bleepers around  
 with them. There is a hotel that has a
 siren that tells the firemen when     
 there is a fire,a hidden button is    
 pressed to make the siren go off.     
 Shiskine fire brigade have had their  
 new Ford van for two years.When there 
 is a fire they can't go right up to   
 the fire with the Ford van but,with   
 the Landrover they could get right up 
 to it.That is why more people like it.
