		<title>05HISTORY OF GLENROTHES</title>
		<content> FROM 1957 NEW INDUSTRIES BEGAN TO POUR
 INTO GLENROTHES eg. THE SCOTTISH MILK 
 MARKETING BOARD AND BECKMANS. WITH THE
 CLOSURE AT THE ROTHES COLLIERY IN 1967
 THIS LEFT A BIG SPACE IN GLENROTHES   
 AND THIS HAD TO BE FILLED BY NEW      
 INDUSTRIES. IT WAS DECIDED THAT       
 GLENROTHES WOULD CATER FOR THE GLASGOW
 OVERSPILL AND SO THEY WOULD FILL SOME 
 OF THE HOUSING SPACES . WITH THE NEW  
 INDUSTRIES THE POPULATION OF          
 GLENROTHES RAPIDLY INCREASED AND      
 GLENROTHES SOON BECAME ONE OF THE     
 MAJOR PLACES IN SCOTLAND FOR          
 ELECTRONICS. TO CATER FOR THE INCREASE
 IN POPULATION,NORTH GLENROTHES WAS    
 EXPANDED AND AREAS SUCH AS BALFARG,   
 CADHAM, COLLYDEAN AND PITCOUDIE WERE  
 BUILT AND SCHOOLS WERE BUILT IN       
 COLLYDEAN AND PITCOUDIE.
