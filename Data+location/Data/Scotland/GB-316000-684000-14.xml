 school have just taken part in a      
{pageant}in{Aberdour.}The{pageant}was a
 play performed by{3}schools,{Dalgety  
{Bay Primary,Aberdour Primary}and      
{Donibristle Primary.}The children from
 the schools dressed up as people who  
 lived in{Aberdour Castle}in the early 
{17th}century.They dressed up as       
{falconers,servants,messengers}and     
{Lords}and{Ladies.}They performed a    
 play  about how people lived at that  
 time.They sung songs and danced. Even 
 the servants performed. The children  
 all made their own costumes to look   
 like dress from that  period. It was  
 arranged by two hisorians,{Mr and Mrs 
{Bagenal}who have been going round     
 other schools in{Fife}doing similar   
 projects.
