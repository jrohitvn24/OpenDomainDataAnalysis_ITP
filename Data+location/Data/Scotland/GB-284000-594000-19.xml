		<title>19HEADLESS H0RSEMAN OF TYNRON</title>
		<content> Sam Kirkpatrick of Cairneycroft stole 
 over to young Jean Fingland's one     
 moonlit night.On nearing Clonrae a    
 horserider wearing fine armour and    
 jewelled spurs approached him.His fine
 appearance  was marred by his lack of-
  A HEAD ! Kirkpatrick followed this   
 apparition to Penpont Cross where it  
 dismounted &amp; knelt on the ground      
 searching.After turning to look at a  
 barking dog, Kirkpatrick found the    
 apparition had vanished.This headless 
 horseman is supposedly a young        
 McMilligan who courted the daughter of
 McGlachan of Dalquhat.Her brother int-
 errupted their courting &amp; McMilligan  
 stormed off in a rage.Carelessly      
 riding over a steep crag his head was 
 severed from his body and rolled down 
 into St Bride's well. His spirit is   
 still seen in Penpont searching for   
 the head needed to enter heaven.      </content>
