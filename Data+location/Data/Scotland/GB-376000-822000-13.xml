		<content>   The farm of Hillbrae is owned by Mr 
 J. Collie who farms a pedigree herd of
 British Friesians and all of his 250  
 acres is geared to producing grass,   
 silage and winter feed for his cows.  
 Mr Collie inherited the farm from his 
 father who moved there in 1890.       
   There are 75 milking cows and a     
 pedigree British Friesian bull.  The  
 female calves are kept for            
 replacements in the herd or sold to   
 other breeders and the bull calves are
 sold to another farmer for fattening. 
 As well as using a bull Mr Collie uses
 artificial insemination to intoduce   
 new blood into the herd.              
  Mr Collie employs a dairymaid and a  
 tractorman to cope with the day to day
 running of the farm and employs       
 contractors to sow the seed and do his
 harvesting.
