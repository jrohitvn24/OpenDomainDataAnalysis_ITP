		<title>10Leisure Time in Glenisla.</title>
		<content> Although the population is small,the  
 leisure activities of the Glenisla    
 residents are many and varied. There  
 is a playgroup for the pre-school     
 children at which they can get to know
 each other. This is important since   
 homes are widely separated. It also   
 allows mums to get together to compare
 notes!  Glenisla has a fairly large   
 community hall in which many social   
 events or occasions are held. The     
 Games Club meets on a Monday evening  
 when carpet bowls and darts are       
 played. Badminton is held on Wednesday
 evenings for the younger people and   
 this is well attended. Shields and    
 trophies are competed for in both     
 clubs and a social evening is held at 
 the end of the season when prizes are 
 presented. Regular dances and concerts
 are held in the hall.
