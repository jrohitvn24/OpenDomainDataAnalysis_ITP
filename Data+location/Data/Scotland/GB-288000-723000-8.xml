		<title>08HOUSING IN GILMERTON</title>
		<content>   Gilmerton village can be divided up 
 into the old village, which dates     
 from the early ninteenth century, and 
 the new housing estate built on       
 council land within the last fifteen  
 years.  Building within the village   
 was restricted for a long time by     
 sewage problems in the nearby town of 
 Crieff.  However the council land     
 ajoining the A85 proved an excellent  
 site for the construction of the new  
 estate so that now there approximately
 3 new houses for every old dwelling.  
   The village has very few services,  
 the one shop serves the small         
 population of about 280 people as a   
 post office, newsagent and grocery.   
 For the young there is a small youth  
 club run in the old church.
