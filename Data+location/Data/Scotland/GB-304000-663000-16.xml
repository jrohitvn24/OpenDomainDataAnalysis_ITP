		<title>16A FARM NEAR BELLSQUARRY</title>
		<content>{Murieston Castle Farm},situated 1.5km 
 south of Bellsquarry Village, is a    
 dairy farm. Its main crops are winter 
 barley and grass to feed the cattle.  
 This year,for the first time, Mr.     
 Harry Russell,has grown{oilseed       
{rape}- to produce{cooking oil.}It was 
 used, at first, as a{break crop}- it  
 gives the soil a rest between the     
 growing of other crops, such as       
 barley. Its yields are high and it has
 become a very profitable crop. It is  
 cut by a machine called a{Swather}and 
 then{Combined}after it has dried. The 
 oil is now ready to be extracted from 
 the pod. The{European Economic        
{Community}has been encouraging farmers
 to grow oilseed rape, and we are now  
 seeing fields of this pretty yellow   
 flowered crop all over the            
 countryside.
