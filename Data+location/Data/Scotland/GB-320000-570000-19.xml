		<title>19Annual event at Creca</title>
		<content> Riding of the Marches takes place     
 annually. It is traditional for the   
 Cornet, Cornet's Lass, Standard Bearer
 and a following of 20 to 30 riders to 
 ride round the Borough Boundaries of  
 Annan and report back to the Provest  
 that all is well. The Belted Stone on 
 Creca Moss is one of the Boundary     
 markers and Creca is a refreshment    
 point where the riders dismount and   
 partake of drinks. The Cornet and his 
 followers then proceed out of the     
 village and leave the area at Creca   
 Hall. This event takes place in July  
 and is a ride of some 15 miles. It is 
 every young riders' ambition to take  
 part in this event and ride-outs are  
 held for two to three months          
 beforehand so that riders and horses  
 may get fit.
