		<title>16Hampden Park Football Ground</title>
		<content> Hampden football ground is in the     
 south side of Glasgow.  It is         
 conveniently situated for 2 railway   
 stations.  In the Hampden building    
 there are many rooms.  The board room 
 has all the trophies on display which 
 Queen's Park A.F.C have won.  In the  
 changing rooms there is a large square
 bath called a plunge.  There are also 
 showers and ordinary baths.  If       
 players are nervous before a game they
 can sit behind a partition to read.   
 Upstairs there are dark rooms and a   
 teleprinter room for use by the press.
 Photographs can be developed and sent 
 directly to the newspaper office ready
 to be printed.  The press box has     
 seats for 280 reporters.  The best    
 view of the pitch is from the press   
 box as its sloping windows do not give
 a reflection.  In May 1985 Hampden    
 passed its safety inspection.         </content>
