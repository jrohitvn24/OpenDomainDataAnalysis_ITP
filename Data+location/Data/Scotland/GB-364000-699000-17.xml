		<content> Access to the Isle of May, despite the
 short distance from Anstruther and    
 Crail is difficult - weather          
 conditions can often prevent a        
 crossing or landing. Thus trips have  
 to be made in settled weather         
 conditions and must be made when the  
 weather is right.                     
 Boats leave from the East Fife        
 harbours of Anstruther and Crail and  
 arrangemants must be made with either:
 (a) the few local boatmen licensed to 
     take parties to the island.       
 (b) the Observatory Committee if      
     visitors are wishing to stay at   
     the bird observatory. Only bird   
     watchers can stay overnight.      
 The Nature Conservancy Council station
 a warden on the island during the     
 summer to carry out mangement work and
 to help the visitors who come to the  
 island.                               </content>
