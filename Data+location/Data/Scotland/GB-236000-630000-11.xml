 The Community Centre used to be the   
 Symington School along time ago.      
   Today the Community Centre is used  
 for the Playgroup,Senior Youth Club,  
 Discos,The Senior Badminton and The   
 O.A.P's Evergreen Club.               
   The hall in the Community Centre is 
 quite small you can just fit a        
 badminton court in it.                
   There is a kitchen a cloakroom and  
 some toilets.                         
   It isn't used very much any more    
 because the new school has taken over.
   The Community Centre is quite near  
 the big park.You will pass the        
 Community Centre on the way or way    
 back from Kilmarnock.                 
   There are two lots of toilets.      
  The kitchen is used for refreshmants.
  The discos are good but the hall is a
 bit two small for about 50 people.    </content>
