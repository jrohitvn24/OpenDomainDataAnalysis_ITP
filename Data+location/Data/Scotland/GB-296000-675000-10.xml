		<title>10Employment in Linlithgow</title>
		<content>   We decided to start this project by 
 doing a survey in our school on how   
 many parents worked and if they worked
 in or out of Linlithgow.              
   Out of 135 children 69 dads work and
 42 mums work.Most mums didn't work    
 because they had to pick up their     
 children from school. The mums who did
 work were mainly based in Linlithgow. 
   Some of the dads work with Lothian  
 region, are civil servants, bankers,  
 work with computers, are mechanics or 
 engineers.                            
   There are 41 youngsters between 16  
 and 18 at present unemployed in the   
 Linlithgow area. Some young people are
 in the Y.T.S.                         
   There are 5 local jobs available at 
 the job centre and 15 vacancies on the
 board at the local library.
