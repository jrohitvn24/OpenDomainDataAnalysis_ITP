		<content> THE INDUSTRY IN OUR AREA HAS BEEN     
 GREATLY REDUCED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS 
 WITH THE{CLOSURE}OF SOME OF THE MAIN  
 FACTORIES IN THE AREA INCLUDING THE   
 GOODYEAR TYRE FACTORY AND ALSO THE    
 SINGER SEWING MACHINE FACTORY.BOTH OF 
 THESE EMPLOYED OVER{8,000 PEOPLE.}    
                                       
 IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN 
 RUMOURS ABOUT DIFFERENT COMPANIES     
 TAKING OVER THE GOODYEAR COMPLEX BUT  
 NOW IT LOOKS LIKE BEING MADE INTO A   
 SPORTS CENTRE.APART FROM THE          
 RELATIVELY SMALL FACTORIES (EG.FLECKS 
 BAKERIES)THERE IS THE BARR&amp;STROUD     
 FACTORY IN TEMPLE WHICH EMPLOYS OVER  
 1,000 PEOPLE IN MAKING EQUIPMENT FOR  
 THE ARMED FORCES INCLUDING PERISCOPES 
 FOR THE NAVY'S SUBMARINES.            
   ALL IN ALL THE INDUSTRIAL CLIMATE IS
 NOT SO GOOD AT THE MOMENT AS SEEN BY  
 THE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES.        </content>
