		<title>08BRODICK CASTLE</title>
		<content> Brodick Castle, a seat of the Dukes of
 Hamilton until 1895, was subsequently 
 the home of Marie Louise, Duchess of  
 Montrose, the only child of the 12th  
 Duke of Hamilton.  In 1958, a year    
 after her death, the castle and       
 contents were accepted in lieu of     
 estate duty by the Commissioners of   
 Inland Revenue and the Treasury       
 conveyed them to the National Trust   
 for Scotland.The castle is open to    
 the public every day from Easter until
 September. In 1984, 55,000 people     
 visited the beautiful rooms built at  
 different times since the castle's    
 origin in the 13th century.  These    
 rooms contain many fine examples of   
 silver, porcelain and paintings. The  
 castle has magnificent gardens and    
 7,300 acres of mountainous territory, 
 the latter the gift of Lady Jean Fford
 daughter of the Duchess of Hamilton.  </content>
