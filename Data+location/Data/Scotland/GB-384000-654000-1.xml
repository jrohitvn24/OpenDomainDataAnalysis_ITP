		<title>01CHIRNSIDE:SUMMARY</title>
		<content> The area we are investigating is part 
 of rural Berwickshire. It lies 9 miles
 west of Berwick-upon-Tweed. The       
 population is around 1200 and includes
 the 2 villages of Chirnside and       
 Allanton. There is a very limited     
 public bus service, most people having
 to rely on their own forms of         
 transport, so getting about is not    
 easy. Sixteen shops serve the         
 community, the most important being   
 the Post Offices. Steady employment is
 provided mainly by farms, a paper     
 mill, grain stores, and shops.        
 Children from a wide area attend the  
 local primary school at Chirnside. For
 a small area there is a variety of    
 activities for people to enjoy,       
 including many indoor and outdoor     
 sports. The Civic Week is held        
 annually with fun and games for all   
 the family.                           </content>
