		<content> Laurieston is a small country village 
 with a village hall, where a variety  
 of activities take place for children,
 e.g. village parties and badminton    
 which are organised by the community. 
 There is opportunity for sailing and  
 swimming at the loch  in the nearby   
 town  of Castle Douglas. Bicycles are 
 used a lot in this area, both for     
 transport and enjoyment. Bird watching
 is popular, both in gardens and in the
 countryside around the village, where 
 buzzards, waterfowl, finches and tits 
 are regularly seen. A few people enjoy
 horse riding. There is a play area    
 with swings. Games such as tig, hide  
 and seek, cops and robbers are popular
 for young children in the village. The
 local lochs are popular for fishing,  
 canoeing, sailing and swimming.
