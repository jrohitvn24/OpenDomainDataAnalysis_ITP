		<content> My home is in Ullapool,Scotland.We are
 quite remote as the nearest town is   
 over 50 miles away.                   
 In my family there are 5 people,my    
 father,mother,sister Lyndsey,brother  
 Aiden and myself.                     
 On a typical Thursday in my life,I get
 up about 8 a.m.,wash,dress and have my
 breakfast.At 8.55 a.m.my sister and I 
 go to school.                         
 Meanwhile my Mum does the housework   
 then makes lunch for Aiden,Dad and    
 herself while we have our packed lunch
 in school.                            
 Mum does the shopping and at 3 p.m.,  
 goes to visit my Grandma who sometimes
 asks her to drive a school car.       
 After school,I go to the Brownies     
 where we play games or go for walks.  
 At 5.30 p.m.I go home and have my     
 dinner,do my school homework,visit    
 the library,play and then bed at 9pm..</content>
