		<title>05A Bignold Hospital Cleaner</title>
		<content> A hospital cleaner has to do all sorts
 of jobs such as washing the dishes,   
 washing and polishing corridor floors,
 polishing desks, washing out sinks and
 setting the breakfast trolley. It is  
 important that the hospital is kept as
 clean as possible to stop germs       
 spreading. As the Bignold is an old   
 hospital it is not so easy to clean as
 more modern buildings. The cleaners   
 uniform is green with white piping    
 round the arms. The cleaners work on  
 different shifts throughout the day so
 that there is always someone available
 to do the cleaning jobs. Part time    
 cleaners get ten days holiday per year
 plus local holidays. When the new Wick
 hospital opens some cleaners will be  
 transferred there but others will stay
 at the Bignold as it will probably    
 change to another type of hospital.
