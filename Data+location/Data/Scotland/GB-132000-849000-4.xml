		<title>04EDINBANE SCHOOL - PAST</title>
		<content> In the middle of the 19th Century,    
 Macleod of Greshornish built a school 
 for his model village, Edinbane. Two  
 rooms accommodated a hundred children,
 but many missed schooling because of  
 seasonal work; gathering whelks,      
 herding, planting and lifting potatoes
 and gathering seaweed. There was a    
 great fear of infection with a rumour 
 of measles of scarlet fever producing 
 a "scare" which kept children at home,
 although the old log book tells wryly 
 how, during a "scare" they al turned  
 up for the Christmas treat supplied by
 the doctor. Auntie Maggie MacDonald   
 told how, about 80 years ago, she     
 walked barefoot and carrying two peats
 for the fire, the four miles to       
 school. "Often on a winter morning we 
 would put up the cattle so that we    
 could warm out feet on the ground     
 where they had been lying".           </content>
