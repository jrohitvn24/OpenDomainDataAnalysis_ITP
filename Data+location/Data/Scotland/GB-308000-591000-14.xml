		<content>   There is a small two teacher Rural  
 School at Johnstonebridge which has 26
 pupils at present.                    
   The school opened in 1873, a new    
 classroom, inside toilets and a staff 
 room were added about 16 years ago.   
   The lunches are cooked on the       
 premises by the school cook as the    
 school has its own kitchen and dining 
 room built about 20 years ago.        
 Twenty-five of the twenty six children
 stay for lunch. This is a great asset 
 socially as most of the children come 
 from fairly isolated farms and enjoy  
 the chance of eating and playing      
 together.                             
   The school holds a Christmas Concert
 each year and an End of Term Ceremony,
 always well attended by parents.      
  The Christmas and Hallowe'en Parties 
 as well as a Burns' Supper are annual 
 events in the school.                 </content>
