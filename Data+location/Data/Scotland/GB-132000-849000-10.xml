		<title>10EDINBANE - JOCK MACFARLOW</title>
		<content> Jock Macfarlow is a shepherd on       
 Greshornish Estate and sometimes I    
 help him on a Saturday, especially at 
 lambing. He is also a carpenter to    
 trade, but he changed to shepherding  
 because there was not any work. At    
 first he worked with his father; who  
 is a shepherd. Jock us well-known as  
 he has won a lot of prizes at         
 sheep-dog trials. This is the second  
 year he has won the top award for     
 dog-handling. About ten years ago,    
 Jock played shinty for Portree and for
 Skye. Once he played as a forward when
 the Skye team travelled to Killarney  
 to the Pan-Celtic festival. In his    
 spare time, Jock sometimes carves     
 handles for shepherd's crooks.
