		<content> Mass at the Catholic Church of St     
 Joachims starts at 11.30am but it     
 isn't usually dead on time. If the    
 priest Father Walls is ready and the  
 four alter servers are ready then we  
 begin. On Sunday 16th June seven      
 people made their first Confirmation. 
 Confirmation is when children reach a 
 certain age and they have to become an
 adult member of the church, but adults
 can be Confirmed as well. Three of the
 people who were Confirmed belong to P7
 of Hillhead School. We all had a      
 person who would help us to make the  
 Confirmation, a sponsor. The Bishop   
 came up from the Cathedral in Aberdeen
 to confirm us. He comes every year as 
 we write letters to him, asking him   
 up. After the mass we went downstairs 
 to a room where the rest of the church
 members were for a reception of       
 various refreshment and to take photos</content>
