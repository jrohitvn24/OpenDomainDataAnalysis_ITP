		<title>07A Crofting Year in Tongue</title>
		<content> 'Spring is avery important time in the
 crofting year because the crofter has 
 to work very hard. First the plough   
 ing has to be done with a tractor to  
 pull the plough. Sometimes the crofter
 harrows the ground with a frame that  
 has little spikes on it. He does not  
 do any sowing until the fertiliser is 
 put on, this can be artificial fertil 
 iser. Then corn, grass seed and       
 potatoes are sown. Then he hopes the  
 sun and rain will come to make things 
 grow. Weeds appear and have to be     
 taken out by hand or by using a hoe.  
 In autumn the crofter begins the harv 
 est. First he makes sure the crops are
 ripe and yellow. Thwn he cuts the corn
 with a combine harvester that takes   
 the grain away from the straw. Then he
 makes the straw into bales and stores 
 them in his barn. Then when the weath 
 er is good he lifts the potatoes.     </content>
