		<content>   The area was largely dominated in   
 the past by the coal industry. The    
 coal seams, owned by the Duke of      
 Hamilton were exploited by a number of
 mines, Eddlewood, Cadzow and (just    
 outside our area) Quarter. Since the  
 seams ran down towards the Clyde, they
 eventually undermined Hamilton Palace 
 itself.                               
{PLACE NAMES}                          
   Eddlewood means "Freeholding in the 
 wood". This is an area of land, held  
 without Few Superior, and the castle  
 that marked the estate stood at the   
 junction of the Blacklog and          
 Simpsonland Burns and was destroyed   
 after Langside in 1568.               
   Earnock means "The hill of the      
 sloes", but there is no sign of these 
 today.
