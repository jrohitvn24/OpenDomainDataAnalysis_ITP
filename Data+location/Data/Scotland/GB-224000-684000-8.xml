		<title>08GARDENS OF INTEREST IN RHU.</title>
		<content> Although most gardens are well tended 
 and attractive some,especially those  
 belonging to the mansion houses,are of
 particular interest to the public.    
 "Woodcote",in Rhu,is noted for its    
 array of most unusual plants,shrubs   
 and trees including a plant which is  
 over 300 years old, brought originally
 from Inverary churchyard and a very   
 rare Red Oak tree,of which we are told
 there are only 2 in Britain.Glenarn   
 House,also in Rhu has a most          
 beautiful garden noted particularly   
 for its many different species of     
 rhododendron and azalea bushes.Both of
 these gardens have been opened to the 
 public, the former on the basis of    
 once every alternate year with        
 proceeds going to a local charity and 
 the latter,although not at present,was
 open regularly in the past and hopes  
 to re_open in the near future.        </content>
