		<title>12FAMILY LIFE IN HAWICK</title>
		<content> In the last fifteen years Hawick clubs
 and pubs have opened their doors to   
 women, much to the detriment of the   
 once regular family gatherings and    
 weekly 'knitting bees'.  The tables   
 have indeed turned since the days of  
 the drunken stockingmakers of the 19th
 Century when their womenfolk suffered 
 so greatly.  Extended licensing hours 
 merely serve to underline the ever    
 increasing number of females, teen-   
 agers to middle-age and beyond, who   
 have invaded the once all male domain 
 to indulge their taste for alcahol.   
 "Women's Rights" have come a long way 
 since the turn of the century but     
 perhaps have not always progressed in 
 the right direction.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
