		<content> Leven is popular with holidaymakers as
 it has a sandy beach safe for children
 Along the promenade there are putting 
 and bowling greens,a golf course, an  
 amusement arcade,a paddling pool and  
 fairground and a caravan park.        
    Special attractions this year      
 should suit all the family. For the   
 children a fancy dress parade, Mr     
 Muscles competition or join the Chummy
 Fun Club.There is to be a dog show,a  
 whippet race but the biggest animal   
 attraction will surely be Hercules the
 Bear! Coming in his Hercmobile he will
 be wrestling with Andy Robin the      
 champion wrestler in an exhibition.   
    A hypnotist, comedians, pop groups,
 folk music and a pipe band will be    
 appearing in shows. With all that we  
 wondered if there could be complaints?
 Broken glass and litter on the beach  
 perhaps or rainy weather?             </content>
