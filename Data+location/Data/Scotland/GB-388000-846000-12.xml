		<title>12Old Graveyard, New Deer</title>
		<content>   In the old graveyard opposite St    
 Kanes Church, New Deer there are a lot
 of old tombstones, some upright but   
 many are large flagstones popular at  
 the time of the{body-snatchers}at the 
 end of the eighteenth century.        
   At least one occurrence of body-    
 snatching from New Deer is documented 
 in the{Aberdeen Journal.}This event   
 led to the construction of a{watch-   
{house}that later became a tiny        
{library}and finally was relegated to  
 being used as a gravediggers shed.    
 Traces of the building are visible at 
 the South-eastern corner of the       
 graveyard wall.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
