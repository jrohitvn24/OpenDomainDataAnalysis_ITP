		<title>02DALMALLY CHURCH</title>
		<content> Dalmally has many features of         
 historical interest. The main one     
 within the village is the church.     
    The church that stands in Dalmally 
 today is the third to be built in the 
 village.  It was built in 1807 and is 
 an octagonal shape.  The timber which 
 holds up the roof was the last of the 
 old forest in Glenstrae.  The slates  
 on the roof were brought from Easdale 
 Island. In the bell tower there is a  
 bell which weighs 190 pounds, it used 
 to hang from a tree but was later     
 moved into the bell tower. One        
 thousand and fifty five pounds was    
 spent to furnish the church in 1809   
 most of this furniture still remains  
 in the church. Each bay of the octagon
 contains on large arch pointed window 
 one having a wooden frame.            
   The church was paid for by the      
 fourth Earl of Breadalbane.           </content>
