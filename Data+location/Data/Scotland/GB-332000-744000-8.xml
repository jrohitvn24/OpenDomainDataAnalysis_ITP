		<title>08TOURISM AROUND EASSIE</title>
		<content> Eassie is in an excellent position to 
 offer the tourist many places to      
 visit. There are about ten holiday    
 cottages in our area, which are used  
 all summer.                           
 From Eassie visitors may go to Dundee 
 or Perth or explore the Angus glens - 
 Glens Prosen, Clova and Isla.         
 Glamis Castle, childhood home of the  
 Queen Mother, is only 3 miles away and
 guided tours take place throughout the
 summer. There is also a very good     
 museum in Glamis village.             
 Visitors can also come to Eassie in   
 winter as the Glenshee ski grounds are
 only an hour's drive away.            
 Shooting parties are arranged in the  
 Eassie area during the pheasant       
 shooting season.
