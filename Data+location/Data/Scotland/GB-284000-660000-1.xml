		<content>  The  population of{SHOTTS}is c.13000 
 SITUATION:Shotts is roughly half way  
 between{EDINBURGH}in the East and     
{GLASGOW}in the West,at the highest    
 point.The town itself is at an        
 altitude of c.230m-750feet and lies   
 between two main roads ,almost hidden 
 from both.                            
{LOCAL DIVISIONS}There are three areas 
 in the town:{DYKEHEAD  STANE} and     
{SPRINGHILL.}The areas are separate    
 physically and to some extent socially
{TRANSPORT}Shotts can be reached by    
 road or rail as an Edinburgh-Glasgow  
 rail route passes through.There are   
 bus services.                         
{CLIMATE}Shottsonians are quite proud  
 of their bad weather,which they may   
 occasionally exaggerate. Due to the   
 altitude winter lasts a little        
 longer and summer can be cold and     
 windy.                                </content>
