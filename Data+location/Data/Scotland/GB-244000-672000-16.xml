		<title>16LEGEND - OLD KILPATRICK</title>
		<content> It is thought that{OLD KILPATRICK     
 takes its name from the{legend}that   
{St Patrick,}the{patron}saint of       
{Ireland,}was born in the area, later  
 captured by the Romans and{transported
 to Ireland as a{slave.                
                                       
 Many Irishmen would of course{dispute 
 this story, but the area is steeped in
{Roman history;}full of{archaeological 
 remains,(it is the site of the western
 end of Antonine's Wall,and has the    
 remains of a Roman Fort,) that there  
 may be some{truth}to the tale.        
                                       
 A local{Well,}known as ST Patrick's   
 Well adds to the legend.              
 The large{Catholic}population of the  
 village are{proud}of the connection   
 with the Saint and have{honoured}him  
 by{naming}their new{church}after him.
