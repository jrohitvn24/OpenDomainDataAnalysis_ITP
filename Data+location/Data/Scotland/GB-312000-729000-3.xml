		<content>  1This year at the end of term        
 Prize-giving Service at our School the
 Dean of Guild of Perth Guildry        
 Incorporation came all dressed up in  
 his ceremonial robes and chain of     
 office. His cloak is scarlet with     
 ermine trimmings and his chain is     
 solid gold. Mr. Menzies is the Dean   
 this year.                            
 Our other guest was a lady from the   
 RNLI who came to receive the sum of   
 Â£203 which twelve of us had raised at 
 a Fun Run in Perth.                   
 The Guildry give us prizes when they  
 visit in June every year and we       
 thought it would be a good idea for us
 to be giving something to somebody    
 else on the day that the Dean came to 
 award the Guildry prizes for "Good    
 Citizenship".
