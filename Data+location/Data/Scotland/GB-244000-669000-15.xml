		<title>15WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF ERSKINE</title>
		<content>                                       
 We asked people in the community what 
 their thoughts were on Erskine.Here   
 are some of the answers we recorded.  
 The majority of people  thought that  
 Erskine was a good example of the     
 planning of a new town.The reason most
 people gave for liking Erskine was the
 mixture of housing areas with lots of 
 green areas.People felt the atmosphere
 of living in the countryside had not  
 been spoiled.Also,most people liked   
 the houses.However,there was one major
 complaint and that was the lack of    
 amenities in the area,especially for  
 younger people.A sports centre came   
 top of the list of amenities that     
 Erskine residents would like to see   
 being built in the future.A cinema was
 also a popular choice.
