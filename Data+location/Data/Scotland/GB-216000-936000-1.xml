		<title>01Duartmore Forest</title>
		<content> The area is a rocky, boggy, treeless  
 coastal area with a loch and          
 coniferous plantation partly within it
 The plantation has not grown well and 
 is a commercial failure.  The         
 forester's house is now the house of  
 the salmon hatchery manager.  It is   
 the only house in the area.  There are
 a few sheep on the heather and bog    
 covered hillsides.  The salmon        
 hatchery employs 3 full time and 3    
 part time workers.  The pure water    
 from the loch is vital to the         
 hatchery.  It is hard to find a good  
 level site such as this.  The firm    
 Joseph Johnston &amp; Sons Ltd of Montrose
 are very strict about visitors to     
 prevent infection getting in to the   
 hatchery.  Some of the fish go to sea 
 cages after 18 months, some are sold  
 to other fish farms.
