		<content> Leisure activities in this area tend  
 mainly to be connected with the       
 countryside and outdoor life. Many    
 people are interested in horse riding-
 there are a lot of suitable riders    
 around the tracks in the area and     
 local shows and gymkhanas are held all
 over the district.                    
  Walking and shooting are also popular
 outdoor pursuits here, and many people
 keep pets in addition to farm animals.
 To find any organised social          
 activities people have to trvel to    
 Cupar where there are pubs, discos and
 the swimming pool. However for more   
 sophisticated entertainment people may
 go to Kirkcaldy (cinemas,skating rink 
 and theatre) or Dundee and Edinburgh, 
 all of which involve quite a long     
 journey.                              
  Recently many people in this area    
 spent a day at the{Highland Show.     </content>
