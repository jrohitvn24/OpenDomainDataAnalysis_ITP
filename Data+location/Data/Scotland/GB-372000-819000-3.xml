		<content> Housing in the Burnhervie area.       
                                       
  The majority of domestic buildings   
 in the block are of traditional stone 
 construction, usually of granite from 
 one of several nearby quarries.       
  Most buildings in the area date from 
 the late eighteenth and nineteenth    
 centuries. This was a time when local 
 tenant farmers were prospering due to 
 farming improvements and could afford 
 to build new residences and cottages. 
  These farmhouses are substantial     
 dwellings of grey granite walls with  
 grey slate roofs. A few new houses    
 have been built near Burnhervie and   
 some attempt has been made to make    
 sure that these fit into the local    
 environment.                          
 Almost all houses here are detached   
 and are owner-occupied or rented      
 privately.                            </content>
