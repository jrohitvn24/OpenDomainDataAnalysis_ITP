		<title>07Arbroath Abbey, Custodian.</title>
		<content> Today we went down to the Arbroath    
 Abbey and we met the caretaker, Bert  
 Mc,Nulty and we talked to him about   
 his job, and what he had to do. He    
 said he had to make sure everything   
 was kept in good condition. He        
 polished the floors of the museum and 
 dusted but his main job is to show the
 abbey. He also helped the gardeners if
 necessary.The day we went, he was     
 trimming the edges of the grass.Mr    
 Mc,Nulty said the people he likes to  
 see are school children to rnow that  
 they are studying their Scottish      
 History.he said he could get around   
 60 thousand visitors each year each   
 summer and and the question he is     
 asked most is were the king was       
 buried?.We really enyoyed the vist to 
 the abbey because it has an atmosphere
 of its own                            
                                       </content>
