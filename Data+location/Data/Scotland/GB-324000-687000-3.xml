		<title>03ARABLE FARMING (1),KIRKCALDY</title>
		<content> Arable farming is the main commercial 
 activity in this part of Fife.        
 There are eighteen farms but these are
 not all worked independently, eg.,    
 Longloch and Glassmount are worked    
 together(560 acres), as are Banchory  
 and Craigencalt(686 acres), although  
 the emphasis in each is quite         
 different.                            
 By far the most abundant crop is      
{barley,}followed by{sown grass, wheat,
{potatoes,}and small amounts of{peas,} 
{turips}and{oilseed rape.              
 The more traditional methods of arable
 farming by crop rotation have been    
 replaced by intensive cultivation in  
 which successive crops of barley are  
 grown in the same fields, by using    
 modern chemical fertilisers and       
 pesticides. All of the barley grown   
 locally is taken to Kirkcaldy for     
 malting in the preparation of whisky. </content>
