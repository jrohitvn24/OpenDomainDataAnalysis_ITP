		<title>17Family Life in Thurso</title>
		<content> Our family normally gets up at about  
 6.45 a.m. because Mum and Dad both    
 work at Dounreay. Breakfast is cereal 
 and sometimes toast. When Martin and I
 are ready we go to a lady who looks   
 after us until it's time for school.At
 school we play until the bell at 8.55 
 goes for going in.We then do maths and
 at 10.35 we go out to play.Lunchtime  
 is at 12.45 and hometime is at 3.30.  
 After school I go swimming,brownies or
 out to play. Our house has thirteen   
 rooms and the heating is a pump which 
 pumps hot water heated by a coal      
 fire.In our family there are 4 people 
 but most families in Thurso have about
 4-6.Some of the machines that help    
 with housework are a microwave oven   
 and a vacuum cleaner.Our car is a     
 Caravanette which is white and is 3   
 years old.It holds lots of people.
