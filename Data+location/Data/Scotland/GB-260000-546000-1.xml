 This is a typical rural landscape     
 where landscape is the predominate    
 land cover.  The scattered farms are  
 generally units, with small fields    
 divided by stone walls.  The land     
 rises gently from the rocky coast to  
 about 100m.                           
 Although there is no commercial forest
 the area is quite well wooded round   
 the farms and village, with naturally 
 sown deciduous trees.  The ample      
 supply os stone is used in all the    
 buildings in the area.  The farms and 
 farm buildings, private houses, church
 and school have all made use of what  
 must have been a cheap local          
 commodity.  No part of this block is  
 more than 5km. from the sea.
