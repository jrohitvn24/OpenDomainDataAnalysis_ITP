		<content>{POLITICS -}CARDROSS IS REPRESENTED BY 
 AN INDEPENDENT COUNCILLOR, GEORGE HOOD
 ON THE LABOUR-CONTROLLED DUMBARTON    
 DISTRICT COUNCIL. APATHY PREVAILS. THE
 LOCAL COMMUNITY COUNCIL, A NON-       
 POLITICAL GROUP DOES NOT ENJOY MUCH   
 SUPPORT.                              
{STANDARD OF LIVING - }ON THE WHOLE,   
 THIS IS A MIDDLE-CLASS COMMUNITY.     
 THERE IS AN AMBIVALENT ATTITUDE TO    
 THE SITING OF NUCLEAR BASES LOCALLY.  
 PERHAPS APATHY ON LOCAL ISSUES IS DUE 
 TO THE LARGE PROPORTION OF TRANSIENT  
 FAMILIES!{                            
{QUESTIONNAIRE -}IN A SAMPLE SURVEY, IT
 EMERGED THAT DRUG-TAKING CAUSES MUCH  
 CONCERN, BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE  
 RECENTLY-ESTABLISHED REHABILITATION   
 CENTRE AT KILMAHEW IS VIEWED WITH SOME
 DISMAY. UNEMPLOYMENT IS ANOTHER CAUSE 
 OF CONCERN, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE      
 YOUNG.                                </content>
