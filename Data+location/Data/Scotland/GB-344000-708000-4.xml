   There are a few buses which serve   
  our area,but the bus service is very 
 poor.The buses run on a two hourly    
 service from 9am till 7pm.The bus     
 service is augmented by a post bus    
 service but this only runs once a     
 day.This post bus is really the postal
 deliveries mini bus and even this is  
 under threat.                         
   As a result of the poor bus service 
 many families require to run two cars,
 one for transport to work and the     
 other for use in shopping. This       
 increases the cost of living in this  
 rural area.                           
   The nearest railway station is in   
 Cupar seven miles away. Nearest       
 airport is in Edinburgh which is      
 approximately forty miles distant.
