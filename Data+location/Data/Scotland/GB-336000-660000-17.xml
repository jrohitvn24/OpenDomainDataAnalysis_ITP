		<title>17Crichton and Newlandrig.</title>
		<content>   There are two small villages in our 
 patch Crichton and Newlandrig.        
   Both are similar: small and very    
 attractive with old stone built       
 cottages most of which have been      
 modernised.                           
   It would be peaceful and very       
 pleasant in the summer.There are many 
 beautiful country walks around        
 Crichton castle and the valley of the 
 Tyne Water.You would probably be very 
 friendly with your neighbour.There    
 wouldn't be any heavy traffic on the  
 roads and you could keep pets         
 safely. There are more and more       
 problems in large cities nowadays.    
 Crime is on the increase and          
 employment is a problem. In the       
 country you could grow your own       
 vegetables and be more independent.
