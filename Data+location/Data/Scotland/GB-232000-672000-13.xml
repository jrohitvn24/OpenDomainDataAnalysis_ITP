		<content> Fashion and beauty is popular in Port 
 Glasgow. Both males and females are   
 very self-conscious about their       
 appearance and like to be up-to-date  
 in the latest fashions. There is only 
 one main fashion boutique in Port     
 Glasgow, this is Baxters in Church    
 Street and King Street.               
         Everyone in Port Glasgow has  
 their own type of dress sense. Almost 
 all of them follow the styles of their
 pop idols,as portrayed in the{media.  
         There is only one type of     
 gambling which takes place in Port    
 Glasgow, this is bookmaking. There are
 only two "Bookies" (as it is commonly 
 known) they are Ladbrokes and Tote.   
         There are only two cafes      
 namely The Apollo and Aulds. There are
 two main restaurants The Little Chef  
 and Fan King a Chinese specialist.
