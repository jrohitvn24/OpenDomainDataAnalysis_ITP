		<content> The majority of the area of the block 
 is occupied by Fans and Darlingfield  
 farms, two tenanted farms belonging to
 Mellerstain Estate. To the north lies 
 the farm of West Marriston, one of    
 whose principle enterprises as the    
 rearing of chickens. Otherwise the    
 land is arable with intensively       
 managed grassland for rearing beef    
 cattle and sheep. The population is   
 limited to some 15 families who live  
 and work on the farms. There are two  
 large coniferous plantations for the  
 production of softwood timber, and a  
 number of coniferous and deciduous    
 shelter belts to shelter livestock and
 farm buildings. The ground rises in   
 the centre of the block to the highest
 point in the area, Fans Hill, an open 
 grass hill of 246m high, which has a  
 triangulation point on it. The block  
 is well served by a variety of roads  </content>
