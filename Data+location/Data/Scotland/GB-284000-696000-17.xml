		<title>17CAUSES FOR CONCERN-MENSTRIE</title>
		<content> In our recent survey many of the      
 villagers expressed their concern over
 the amount of{vandalism}in the area   
 such as the{pollution}of the burn,    
 church windows being smashed,{graffiti
 on the park pavilion walls. Also      
 several newly planted saplings have   
 had their top branches taken off.     
    There is also concern that more    
{amenities}are needed. A large number  
 of people want a chemist and many     
 expressed a desire for a leisure      
 centre.                               
   A lot of people were displeased at  
 the amount of{noise}each night from   
 separate gangs and people leaving the 
 pub.                                  
  {Speeding motorists}are also a cause 
 for concern.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
