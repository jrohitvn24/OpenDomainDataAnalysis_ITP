		<content> Our school,built at the bottom of     
 Darklaw Hill is open to the wind.It   
 has two classrooms,two toilets and a  
 staffroom in the newer building.The   
 older building was the school until   
 the newer building was built in the   
 late nineteen twenties.It is now used 
 as a dining room with the dinners     
 brought from Cupar by van.One of the  
 classrooms is for the primaries 1-3   
 while the other is for the 4-7s.we    
 have a secretary who works between    
 Rathillet and Creich primaries.We have
 a T.V.,a video,radio-cassette         
 recorders, a small cooker and a BBC   
 model "B" computer with disk drive to 
 help us with our work.We share our    
 sports day with Creich and Dunbog     
 schools and our educational outings   
 with Creich as all these schools have 
 just over 20 pupils each.Five visiting
 teachers also attend our school.      </content>
