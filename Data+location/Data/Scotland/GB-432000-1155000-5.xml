		<content> There are 85 people in this block who 
 work outside the home. Crofting       
 (small-scale farming) is the most     
 common type of work. Roughly 24 people
 living in the area are crofters,      
 either part or full time. The school  
 provides full or part time work for   
 33 people though only 12 of these are 
 resident within the block. 6 people   
 work in shops. Fishing employs 5      
 people, some of these part time. 5    
 people work at a knitwear factory but 
 only 2 of those actually live in the  
 area. Salmon farming is just beginning
 in the area and provides part time    
 jobs for 6 people on 2 farms. A mink  
 farm and a sheepskin business each    
 provide work for 1 person. A number of
 people work outside the block mainly  
 in Lerwick or the Sullom Voe oil      
 terminal.
