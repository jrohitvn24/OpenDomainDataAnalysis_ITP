		<title>16Peat in Evie</title>
		<content>   Peat is made up of vegetable matter 
 which has died and rotted.  It        
 contains carbon which makes it burn   
 easily.  Most peat banks were given by
 the landowners to their tenants to    
 keep them in fuel.                    
   A{ritting knife}is used to open up a
 bank and take off the top turf, while 
 a{tusker}is the tool for cutting up   
 the peat.                             
   Whole families visit the peat banks 
 in May to spread peats for drying.    
 The peats are then raised for further 
 drying, rued (gathered into heaps) or 
 dyked.  In July the peats are taken   
 home for stacking.  5 to 7 tonnes are 
 required for a year's supply of       
 domestic fuel.                        
   Commercial vehicles are now moving  
 in to some areas but in Evie          
 traditional methods are still used.   
 Most people still burn peat for fuel. </content>
