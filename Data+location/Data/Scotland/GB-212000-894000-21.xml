<title>21Life of a Ten year old 25 years on</title>
<content>

Having found my entry in the original 1986 Domesday Project, I find it intriguing to compare my life as a 10 year old in a village in the Highlands of Scotland against the life of my ten year old daughter in a city in North East Scotland.  She too lunches at school, takes part in Brownies, goes to bed at 9pm and regularly visits the library.  Many things seem unchanged.  However, at 10 years old, 25 years on from my submission, she has her own mobile phone, she accesses the Internet to get her school homework and her mum works.  She doesn't have the freedom to play outdoors unsupervised, but she eats a lot more fruit and vegetables than I did!  She's travelled frequently by plane, whereas at 10 I had yet to enjoy my first flight.  Life has moved on vastly in the last 25 years, but having thorougly enjoyed being taken back 25 years by my article, I hope that in 25 years my daughter will be able to look back on her 10th year with as much pleasure!   &lt;br />
