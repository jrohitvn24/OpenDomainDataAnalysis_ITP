		<content>{Dairy Farming.}                       
 The kind of cows we keep are Friesians
 and a little Ayrshires. We put them on
 good grassland. The cows eat grass,   
 cake, silage, hay and barley.If the   
 calves are beef we keep them but if   
 they are dairy we sell certain ones.  
 An average dairy farm has 100 cows    
 which takes up 60 acres for grazing.  
 Most of the milk goes to the Carnation
 Condensing Plant.                     
{Sheep Farming.                        
 The sheep around here are mostly Swale
 dales, Suffolks, Greyfaces, Cheviot   
 and Border Leicester. The sheep graze 
 on grass they eat barley,hay and      
 turnips. We usually dip sheep in June 
 or July. We shear the sheep in June   
 or July  with electrical shears or    
 clippers.
