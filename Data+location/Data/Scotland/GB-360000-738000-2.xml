		<title>02TOURISM IN ARBROATH.</title>
		<content> In our area there is a wide spread    
 of activities for{tourists}to enjoy.  
 We have Kerr's miniature railway,     
 Smokey's discotheque,Pleasureland     
 amusement arcade,an annual circus and 
 fair, putting,tennis and crazy golf,as
 well as open space,beach and          
 sea.People from our area,as well as   
 tourists, flock to events such as The 
 Abbey Pageant commemorating the       
 Signing of the Declaration of Indep-  
 endence at Arbroath Abbey in 1322.Many
 hotels and guest houses lie in our    
 area making money from the tourists   
 who also help local{traders}make a    
 living.Smokey's used to be part of the
 large open air bathing pool which     
 closed about 5 years ago.Once a luxury
 and great attraction it was eventually
 overtaken by the indoor,heated baths  
 and{events}such as the beauty contests
 held there are held elsewhere in town.</content>
