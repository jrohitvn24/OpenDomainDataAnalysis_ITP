		<content> The name{Montrose}comes from the      
 Gaelic "mon-ross" meaning mossy       
 headland.                             
 There are reports of Viking attacks in
 the 10th century,but the discovery of 
 a Pictish stone at Inchbrayoch shows a
 settlement existed before this time.  
 Much of the Medieval Town was burnt   
 down in 1244.The new town received a  
 Royal Charter from David I in 1352.   
 The Old Pretender left for France from
{Montrose.}                            
 Famous people from{Montrose}include   
 Joseph Hume,a politician and William  
 Lamb,a famous sculptor.               
 Before 1793 the only way across the   
 River Southesk was by ferry.In 1793 a 
 wooden bridge was built but collapsed 
 in a gale in 1827.A new bridge was    
 built in 1829,but was demolished in   
 1929.The present bridge was completed 
 in 1931.                              </content>
