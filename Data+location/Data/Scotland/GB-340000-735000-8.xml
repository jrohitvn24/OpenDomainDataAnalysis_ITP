		<title>08THE PIGGERY</title>
		<content> Few farms keep pigs now and breeding  
 and rearing is concentrated in a few  
 small areas of the country.  There is 
 a{PIGGERY}at Muir of Pert which forms 
 part of a larger pig rearing business 
 in Scotland. The piggery uses part of 
 the disused airfield and there are 250
 sows and 20 boars. These pigs are kept
 purely for breeding. No pigs are      
 bought in. This prevents the spread of
 disease. Breeding is done using       
 artificial insemination and pigs are  
 kept inside all year round. A sow     
 produces about 10 piglets per litter  
 and there is an average of 2.3 litters
 per year. At about 2 months old the   
 piglets are sent to replace any needed
 at the other piggery at Crail in Fife.
 Some may be sold for fattening and    
 slaughter.
