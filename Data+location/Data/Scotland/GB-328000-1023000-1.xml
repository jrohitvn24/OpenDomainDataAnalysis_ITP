		<title>01Greeny And The Hillside</title>
		<content> An area of low, rounded hills with    
 water lying in all depressions.   This
 block is entirely rural, with a high  
 percentage of hill land.   There are  
 several farms, keeping mainly beef    
 cattle (wintered indoors) and sheep.  
 Some cereals, root vegetables and     
 fodder crops are grown.   Incomes are 
 augmented by B &amp; B and machine-       
 knitting.   Some people commute to    
 work in Kirkwall.   The nearest shops 
 are in Dounby, to the south.          
 Hundland Loch has good sport fishing, 
 mainly trout.   The old house of      
 Kirbister, between the lochs, is the  
 best preserved of the old style of    
 Orkney house with open central hearth.
 Most such houses were altered in the  
 19th century.  Once a private museum, 
 the old house of Kirbister now belongs
 to the islands council.   Durkadale   
 and north-east Greeny Hill are an RSPB</content>
