		<title>14Cults Limeworks</title>
		<content> Cults Hill overlooks Pitlessie and is 
 well known for its{lime}.The remains  
 of a few disused{limestone mines}still
 remain.{Lime kilns}can be found in the
 woods.When they were in use there were
 layers of stone and coal at the bottom
 of a kiln and men would shovel the    
 lime in to burn it.They had to wear   
 masks around their mouths because the 
 hot lime used to burn their skins.    
 Only one limestone mine remains today 
 and the lime dug from it is used for  
{liming fields.                        
 The{brickworks}lies below the present 
 day limeworks.It was opened at the end
 of 1962.Local lime,however is not used
 to make these bricks because it is not
 of suitable quality.
