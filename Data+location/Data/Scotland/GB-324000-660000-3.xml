		<title>03HOUSING IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content> A lot of our area is covered by hills,
 woodland and fields.                  
 Many of the new houses are less than  
 twenty years old. The land they stand 
 on was mainly farmland.  Most of the  
 houses are in estates called Ladywood,
 Greenlaw Mains one, Greenlaw Mains    
 two, Kirkhill and Bellwood.  There are
 also army houses belonging to         
 Glencorse Barracks.  The Council and  
 Wimpey built many of these houses     
 which are mostly semi-detached and    
 terraced with a few detached houses.  
 There are also some bungalows.  The   
 other houses in our area are mainly   
 cottages or large farm houses like    
 Auchendinny Mains. In addition there  
 are a few very large old houses like  
 Loganbank.
