		<content> Oldmeldrum, with a population of 1700,
 dominates the north West. Within      
 commuting distance of Aberdeen,       
 housing growth has recently been      
 steady and planning permission granted
 for further private housing south of  
 the school. More sheltered housing for
 old folk is meanwhile being           
 constructed. Population consists of   
 many oil related workers and retired  
 members of the farming community. The 
 school has a roll of 220, a government
 financed nursery and privately run    
 playgroup. Pupils must travel 5 miles 
 to Inverurie for secondary education. 
 Glengarioch Distillery employs 17     
 workers and produces 1,200,000 litres 
 of alcohol yearly. This was the pilot 
 plant for use of recycled heat and now
 produces 130tonnes of tomatoes yearly.
