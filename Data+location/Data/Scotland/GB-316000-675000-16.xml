		<title>16CRAMOND :Dalmeny Estate</title>
		<content> On 14 June four of us went to Dalmeny 
 Estate to interview the factor, Mr    
 Findlay and to meet Lady Rosebery if  
 she was there. We drove along all     
 the small estate roads before going to
 the Home Farm. Mr Findlay told us     
 there were 1700 acres in the park and 
 that there was more arable land than  
 woodland. The trees grown are for     
 hardwood which is sold to make furni- 
 ture. There is a seven year rotation  
 of crops, grass,wheat,barley, then    
 potatoes or turnips if there is a     
 disease that affects potatoes. There  
 is a 9 hole golf course for the family
 and the tenants of the 24 houses on   
 the estate and for all the employees. 
 "The only other sport is pheasant     
 shooting,"said Mr Findlay.There are   
 200 cows at the Home Farm and more    
 than 800 sheep. We saw a tractor      
 flattening the silage to expel all air</content>
