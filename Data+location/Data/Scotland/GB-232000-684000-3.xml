		<title>03Weather in Arden</title>
		<content> Arden is in the west of               
 Scotland.  The weather is very        
 mixed.  There is often a west wind    
 which brings rain.  There is some snow
 almost every winter and there can be a
 short drought in the summer.   In the 
 spring time there is often an east    
 wind which makes everything very dry. 
 There was a very  hot summer in 1984. 
 Some houses whose water supply came   
 from a spring were short of water.    
 The winter of 1983 - 1984 was very    
 snowy.  Some pupils could not get not 
 get to school and the school had to be
 closed for two days.  In autumn the   
 Loch Lomond road can be flooded.  The 
 damp climate makes the area very green
 and beautiful.
