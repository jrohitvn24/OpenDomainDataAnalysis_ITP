		<content>{Ruthven Barracks}puts{Kingussie}on the
 map!  When the new A9 trunk road was  
 built and Kingussie by-passed for the 
 first time in a long history of trade 
 with travellers on the trunk road.    
 Local folks feared they would be      
 overlooked.                           
                                       
 The community council, however,       
 supplied the manpower and with the    
 help of grants{Ruthven Barracks}were  
 floodlit.  They are now a magnificent 
 spectacle for the night traveller,    
 particularly from the new A9 and their
 setting against green hills is very   
 impressive during the day.  Holiday   
 brochures for the area feature this   
 view in a whole page advertisement.
