		<content> Cultivated farmland covers most of the
 area except for the Eastern part where
 rough grassland covers poor sandy     
 soils.  To the south Leuchars Airfield
 occupies land which would otherwise be
 farmland.  The farms are large,       
 concentrating on 'cash crops' such as 
 barley and potatoes; but they also run
 small herds of cattle for fattening.  
 To feed the cattle rotation grass and 
 turnips are grown.  Sheep are only    
 present in Autumn and Winter when they
 are brought in from the Highlands to  
 be fed on turnips for fattening.  Most
 of the jobs on the farms are now      
 highly mechanised with the result that
 a few skilled workers are now         
 employed.  Because of this trend many 
 farm cottages are either unoccupied or
 have been sold or rented to people who
 want to live in the counryside.       
 Farming in this area is prosperous.   </content>
