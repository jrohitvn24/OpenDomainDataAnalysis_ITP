		<title>16Coast - The Caves</title>
		<content> The Wemyss caves have been used by    
 many people over thousands of years   
 and for a variety of purposes: from   
 cave dwellers, the Picts, early       
 Christians, Norsemen and smugglers, to
 the present day. Unfortunately the    
 caves, which could be a major tourist 
 attraction, now suffer from misuse,   
 wilful damage and neglect.            
 The caves are well known in           
 archaeological circles for their      
 prehistoric carvings. It has been said
 that there are more markings in them  
 than all the other caves in Britain   
 put together. The markings can be     
 grouped under three headings: a) Pre- 
 Christian (Pictish); b) Christian     
 (Pictish); c) Viking. Sadly there are 
 many markings which have been etched  
 in modern days. These include         
 initials, dates, and there is even a  
 fish in Jonathan's Cave.              </content>
