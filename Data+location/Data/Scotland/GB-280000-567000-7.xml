		<title>07A local shopkeeper</title>
		<content> Mr Hardie is a shopkeeper and he has  
 stayed at Springholm for 5.5 years. He
 is selling the shop because he wants  
 to retire. The rates have gone up from
 Â£245 to Â£600 in one year. There is a  
 lot of traffic going through          
 Springholm. If Mr Hardie was not a    
 shopkeeper he would like to be a      
 farmer. He has no complaints about    
 Springholm. Mr Hardie had been at     
 Springholm on holiday and liked it so 
 he moved here. He would like to retire
 to one of the villages around here but
 would not like to live in a city. Mr  
 Hardie says that the drivers do not   
 stick to the 40 mile limit and the    
 reason it is not reduced is because   
 there are houses only on one side of  
 the road. He thinks there should be a 
 new rating system but he does not know
 how they're going to do it. He thought
 it was a good life.                   </content>
