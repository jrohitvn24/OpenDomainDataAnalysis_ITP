   James Hogg the Ettrick Shepherd     
 famous for his poetry and prose was   
 born in 1770 in a cottage which was   
 built on the site of the James Hogg   
 monument.                             
   He went to school for only a year   
 but when he went to work as a         
 shepherd,12 years later when he was   
 18,his employer at that time          
 encouraged him to read and write.     
   He met Walter Scott at Blackhouse in
 Yarrow and that was the begining of a 
 life long friendship which ended when 
 they met for the last time at the     
 Gordon Arms in 1830.                  
   James Hogg died in the November of  
 1835 but has been rembered ever since 
 especialy for poems about the fairy   
 people and his famous prose The       
 Confessions of a Justified Sinner.
