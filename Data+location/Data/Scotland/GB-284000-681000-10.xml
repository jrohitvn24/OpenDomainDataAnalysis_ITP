		<title>10Falkirk Tryst</title>
		<content> One of the main{events}of the area for
 the past 200 years is the Falkirk     
 Tryst which came to Stenhousemuir in  
 1785, and by 1850, this event was at  
 its zenith, selling overÂ£1,100,000 of 
 cows, sheep, horses and goats in three
{fairs}or{markets}annually-in Sept.,   
 Oct.and Nov. Tryst means"meeting      
 place" and Stenhousemuir,with its flat
 sandy well-drained fields, was a      
 suitable place for such a large       
 gathering. When the railways came     
 through Larbert there were two        
 stations built, one a{cattle}station. 
 Animals transported by train were in  
 better condition than those travelling
 along the drove roads. So the Tryst   
 declined, leaving the fair element    
 only.Some of the ground is now used   
 for football,golf,cricket and         
 dog-walking. The rest has been built  
 on.                                   </content>
