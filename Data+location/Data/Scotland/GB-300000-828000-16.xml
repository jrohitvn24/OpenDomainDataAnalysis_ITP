		<title>16ANIMALS IN GRANTOWN ON SPEY</title>
		<content> The forests and moorlands around      
 Grantown are rich in wildlife.  In the
 forests{Red Squirrels}are common and  
 in more remote parts{Pine Marten}and  
{Foxes}are to be found. {Rabbits}are   
 common near the sandy soils near the  
 river, with{Hares}being found in the  
 higher areas.  This provdes food for  
{stoats, weasels}and{polecats.         
                                       
 Deer also abound.  Near the town{Roe }
{Deer}are often seen, and{Red Deer}may 
 make their way down to the lower      
 slopes, especially in poor weather.   
 In recent years{Reindeer}have been    
 reintroduced to the Cairngorms.  Also 
 found in the remoter parts of the     
 hills are{wild goats,}which can cause 
 great damage to the grouse moor.      
 Many of these animals can be seen at  
 the{Highland Wildlife Park}at         
 Kincraig, about 25km from Grantown.   </content>
