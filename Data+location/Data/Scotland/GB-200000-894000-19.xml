    MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME TO LIVE  
 ON SCORAIG HAVE DONE SO BECAUSE THEY  
 ARE INDEPENDENT MINDED.THEY ENJOY     
 WORKING ON THEIR OWN TO PRODUCE       
 DEFINITE RESULTS FOR THEMSELVES AND   
 THEIR FAMILIES.MOST,BUT NOT ALL, WOULD
 BE HAPPY TO STAY ON SCORAIG.NOT ALL   
 PICKED SCORAIG BECAUSE OF ITS ISOLATED
 POSITION.MOST OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO 
 GREW UP ON SCORAIG WANT AT LEAST TO   
 TRY LIFE IN OTHER PLACES BEFORE THEY  
 CHOOSE TO SETTLE THERE.               
    THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE ON       
 SCORAIG WHO BELONG TO A RELIGIOUS     
 GROUP.MANY PEOPLE ARE AGNOSTIC.       
 POLITICAL BELIEFS ON THE WHOLE ARE    
 LEFT OF CENTRE AND THERE IS STRONG    
 SUPPORT FOR C.N.D.
