		<title>10BANGOUR VILLAGE HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> Bangour Village Hospital is for       
 treating mental disorders. It can take
 611 patients. Building started in 1906
 and was interrupted by the war and was
 finished in 1930. It was a{War        
{Hospital in World War 1}and a train   
 transported wounded soldiers from the 
 coast. It was called the{"Wee Bangour 
{Express"}and men from Deans Shale     
 Works used to listen for the train's  
 whistle when they would go down to the
 station at Bangour to help unload the 
 casualties. In the grounds there is a 
 Church which is{inter-denominational. 
 There is also a snack bar,a recreation
 hall and a shop. The idea of a Village
 Hospital was to make patients feel    
 they belonged to a community.{Future  
{plans}may be that it moves to the new 
{Livingston General Hospital}which is  
 being built.
