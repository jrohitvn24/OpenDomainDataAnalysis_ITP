		<content>{2.TEENAGER' VIEWPOINT}                
{                                      
  Like the children the teenagers hold 
 the view that Bellshill does not cater
 for their age-group.They think that   
 the facilities available are oriented 
 mainly towards the older adults.      
 Their suggestions as to what is       
 required includes better shops, more  
 discos for their age group,a cinema   
 and a Sports centre.                  
 Their activities include sport of some
 description ,Bowling,Badminton,Walking
 They also list Youth Fellowship as    
 part of their activities with school  
 homework coming at the end.           
   The say that Bellshill caters well  
 for the Sporting interests of their   
 age                                   
 group but lacks any provision at the  
 weekends for those to whom public     
 houses are age-barred.                </content>
