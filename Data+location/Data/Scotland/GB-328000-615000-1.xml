		<title>01INTRODUCTION- ETTRICK VALLEY</title>
		<content>    This area consists of part of the  
 upper Ettrick Valley, the floor of    
 which, some 700 metres wide, lies at  
 an altitude of 700ft.,enclosed by     
 hills rising to an average of         
 l500ft. above sea level. It is watered
 by the River Ettrick and several small
 tributaries flowing from the hillsides
 The valley bottom consists of         
 hayfields and rough pasture, whilst   
 the hills provide grazing for sheep   
 and cattle, though over the past few  
 years a certain amount of forestry    
 plantings of conifers has taken place 
 The dewellings consist of a few farms 
 with their associated buildings and   
 cottages, the remainder being private 
 residences and holiday homes.         
   It is an area popular with tourists,
 drawn by the peace and tranquility    
 which exists.
