		<title>17The Game Keeper 1</title>
		<content>   Cairndow is well known for its Game 
 Sports, Fishing and Hunting.The game  
 keeper of Ardkinglas Estate has to    
 patrol the river look after the traps 
 and if someone goes shooting he would 
 go with them.There are only two rivers
 in Cairndow that you need a permit    
 for.They are the Kinglas and the Fyne.
 There are four beats (stretches of    
 river for fishing) A B C and D. You   
 are not allowed to fish on a Sunday.  
 People often book the place for       
 fishing at a beat and it would cost   
 Â£265 pounds per week for two rods     
 which is quite cheap compared to some 
 other rivers .                        
   The people who come to Cairndow     
 shoot about 30 stags per year and the 
 keeper always goes with them. Deer are
 weighed in stones, last years average 
 weight was 13 stone 11 pounds  but    
 they can be as big as 21 stone.       </content>
