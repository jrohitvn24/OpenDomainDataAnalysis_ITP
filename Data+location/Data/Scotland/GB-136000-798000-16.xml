		<title>16THE RHUM MIDGE</title>
		<content> Rhum midges have a strange effect on  
 most people! From around June until   
 September they stop many people from  
 gardening, fishing, hill climbing, and
 many other outdoor activities! They   
 stop people from even venturing out   
 when they are really out in force.    
 The female midges lay several hundred 
 eggs in water in a mass of jelly which
 attaches to something solid. The eggs 
 hatch into larvae and these swim quite
 freely, but later, they  settle in the
 mud.                                  
 Midges live by sucking the blood of   
 animals, birds and insects. They also 
 bite humans! They cause irritation    
 when they bite as they pump saliva    
 into their victim to thin the blood   
 before sucking it. They are about 2mm 
 long.                                 
 They are at their worst during warm,  
 still weather in the evenings.        </content>
