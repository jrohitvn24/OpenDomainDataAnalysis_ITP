		<content>    Like many rural schools, there was 
 a questionmark over the future of the 
 village primary school in the 1970's  
 and early 1980's.                     
    In 1985 the school has 43 pupils   
 and 2 teachers, including Mr.Elrick   
 the headmaster.  There are visiting   
 specialist teachers in music, art, and
 remedial education.  The roll will    
 soon rise to over 50 pupils and an    
 extra teacher will be employed.       
    Secondary school pupils in         
 Fetterangus take the school bus to    
 Mintlaw Academy.  This comprehensive  
 school was opened in 1981 just south  
 of the survey block.                  
    The nearest technical college is at
 Fraserburgh and the F.E. institutions 
 in Aberdeen.
