		<content> SYCAMORE:Streets with this name in    
 Corstorphine were named after the     
 Corstorphine Sycamore Tree.  This     
 beautiful tree still exists opposite  
 Sycamore Terrace and is protected by  
 a Tree Preservation Order.  The tree  
 was originally in the grounds of the  
 former Corstorphine Castle and is     
 believed to be three hundred years    
 old. Under its branches, legend says, 
 the granddaughter of the 1st Lord     
 Forrester slew the 2nd Lord with his  
 own sword.
