		<content> My name is Scott Robertson and I am 11
 years old. I live in the Managers     
 House at the distillery where my dad  
 is manager. I get out of bed at       
 8.30a.m and have tea and toast for    
 breakfast. I go to school in the      
 distillery Land Rover. When I get to  
 school I play with the Lego bricks    
 with my friends. When the teacher     
 comes we have a hymn and prayer and   
 then clean our teeth. We do our maths 
 in the morning. At playtime I have    
 crisps and we play British Bulldogs.  
 At 12.30p.m I go home and have my     
 lunch. In the afternoon we do our     
 English. We go home at 3.30p.m and I  
 play with Donna, Stephen and Nicola.  
 I have my tea at 6.00p.m and do my    
 reading when I go to bed at 9.30p.m.  
 My hobbies are reading and working.   
 I have a brother Sean, 14. I have     
 two cats called Splodge and Patch.   0</content>
