		<title>09Farming at Balnault Farm</title>
		<content> Balnault Farm forms the way of life   
 and income for the Fraser family. At  
 times everyone- husband, wife and 2   
 young sons help on the farm.          
      The work involves rearing cattle,
 sheep and pigs, and growing fodder for
 these animals.  In summer most of the 
 work is based on growing and          
 harvesting the winter fodder mainly   
 hay, silage, barley, and swedes.  In  
 winter most time is spent feeding     
 livestock.                            
      Spring is the busiest time- crops
 have to be planted, and the sheep are 
 lambing. Everyone works from dawn to  
 dusk (and later) at this time.        
      Many jobs must be done at short  
 notice- repairing machinery, moving   
 animals etc. Some jobs are only done  
 once or twice a year- shearing sheep, 
 dipping sheep, repairing fences,      
 mucking out the cattle courts etc.    </content>
