   In June 1985 there were 508         
 grey-faced ewes.Because of the wet    
 weather many of the lambs have        
 suffered from pneumonia.The clipping  
 is now finished,done by a contractor. 
 He does 70 in 1.5 hours.Altogether 708
 lambs have been born and they will be 
 kept for six months then sold at      
 St.Boswells.                          
   Crops are grown mainly to feed the  
 animals,15 acres of turnips,40 acres  
 of barley,and 30 acres of hay.        
 There are two Ford tractors and one   
 International which has a loader.
