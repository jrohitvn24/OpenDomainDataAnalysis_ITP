		<content> Beecraigs Country Park which is owned 
 by West Lothian District Council      
 covers 880 acres of countryside near  
 Torphichen. It has facilities for     
 various activities such as archery,   
 climbing and canoeing. Instructors    
 are also available for groups who     
 come up to try these out. The ranger  
 service there organizes nature walks  
 on a variety  of subjects _ fungi,    
 plants or animals. The park is open to
 the public, both local and visitor,   
 and has miles of walkways. It also    
 contains both a trout and deer farm.  
 For those who have a taste for good   
 living trout and venison are sold in a
 shop at the trout farm. It is possible
 to catch fish for yourself in the loch
 with permits available from West      
 Lothian District Council. An excellent
 place to spend some leisure time.
