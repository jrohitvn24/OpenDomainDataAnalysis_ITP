		<content>  Island has seven working crofts, two 
 retired couples and one teacher. 27   
 residents and 4 secondary pupils in   
 Stromness who travel home at weekends.
 Main crop is hay and silage to feed   
 cattle and sheep bred on the island,  
 then mostly sold to mainlabd Scotland 
 for fattening. Most homes have mains  
 electricity and water from private    
 wells or springs, although a scheme is
 under way to pipe mains water from    
 Hoy. The island is served by a        
 passenger ferry 3 days a week (am and 
 pm) supplemented by a weekly cargo    
 boat. As there is no peat on Graemsay 
 the principle fuel is coal, delivered 
 from Stromness. The two lighthouses   
 are now automaticm so there are no    
 keepers. The school at present has two
 pupils, with a further three of       
 pre-school age to follow.
