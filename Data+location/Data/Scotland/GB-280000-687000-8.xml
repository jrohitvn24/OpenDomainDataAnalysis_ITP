   There is public transport to Falkirk
 and Stirling in the villages of Plean 
 and Cowie. However at West Plean there
 is no public transport. Children come 
 to school in a taxi provided by the   
 education authority. Others walk or   
 cycle. Every family in the school owns
 at least one car.                     
   The children remain in school at    
 lunchtime and meals are brought in    
 containers from Bannockburn High      
 School.                               
   Very few of the families use the    
 railway. Normally when going on       
 holiday families travel by coach or   
 car.
