		<content> Two thirds of this area is sea, Scapa 
 flow. The Wreck of Roal Oak sunk      
 during World War 2, rests in the south
 east corner. Oil still leaks from the 
 wreck now a war grave, a wreath is    
 placed over the wreck each year. The  
 A964 runs through the north west      
 corner of this square it is lined with
 dwelling houses and small farms,      
 mainly arable.Approximately two thirds
 of the land in this square is rough   
 heather and hill ground. Among the    
 other buildings is a breakdown and    
 general repair garage, a disused      
 school, now used occasionally as a    
 sunday school, and among the modern   
 housing development at Foveran, is a  
 guest house and restaurant (as        
 mentioned in the Good Food Guide).    
 This part of Scapa Flow is used as a  
 safe anchorage for oil &amp; gas tankers  
 waiting to be loaded at the Oil Term. </content>
