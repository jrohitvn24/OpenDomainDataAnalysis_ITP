		<title>06BOAT BUILDING ON SCORAIG</title>
		<content>   ON SCORAIG THERE IS A BOAT BUILDER. 
 HE BUILDS ABOUT 3 TO 4 BOATS A YEAR.  
 MOST OF THE BOATS HE BUILDS ARE COPIES
 OF OTHER BOATS,WHICH HE FIRST HAS TO  
 MEASURE VERY CAREFULLY.NEXT HE MAKES A
 FRAME ON WHICH TO BUILD UP THE PLANKS.
 THEN HE STEAMS THE PLANKS TO MAKE THEM
 BEND.THEY NEED TO BEND BECAUSE IF THEY
 DID NOT BEND THE BOAT WOULD LOOK LIKE 
 A BOX.SOMETIMES THE PLANKS ARE BENT   
 ANYWAY.HE BANGS THE PLANKS TOGETHER   
 WITH COPPER AND GALVANISED NAILS.THIS 
 IS CALLED CLINCHING,SO THE BOATS ARE  
 CALLED CLINKER-BUILT.                 
   WHEN THE BOATS NEED TO BE PAINTED HE
 USUALLY EMPLOYS SOMEONE TO DO IT.ON A 
 Â£1000 BOAT,ABOUT Â£250 IS SPENT ON     
 MATERIALS AND OVERHEADS.IT TAKES ABOUT
 200HOURS TO BUILD A BOAT,SO HE MAKES  
 ABOUT Â£4 AN HOUR.HE ALSO BUILDS WHEEL-
 HOUSES FOR LARGER FISHING BOATS.
