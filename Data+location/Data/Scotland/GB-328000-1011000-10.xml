		<title>10Post Office</title>
		<content>   The post office is situated on the  
 main Kirkwall/Stromness road and has  
 been operated from the same site since
 l947 by Mrs.Jean Muir. It caters      
 primarily for the parish but because  
 of its position on the main road it   
 gets quite a lot of passing           
 trade.About 40 customers on average   
 pass through the post office each day.
 By far the busiest day is Thursday,   
 not only because it is on this day    
 that the senior citizens collect their
 pension but also because it is        
 'Orcadian Day' that is the day on     
 which the Orkney newspaper is on sale!
 A small amount of hand-sorting goes   
 on in the Post Office into mail for   
 the Kirkwall and mail for the         
 Stromness area. Like most small post  
 offices, Mrs.Muir sells stationery,   
 hardware, sweets and postcards.
