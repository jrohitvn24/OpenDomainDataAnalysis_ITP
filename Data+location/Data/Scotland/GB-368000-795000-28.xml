Cops and Robbers: cops and robbers is an easy game to play and to understand. Here is how you play: 3 or 2 people are the cops and the rest are the robbers. Cops catch the robbers and put them into jail. You can decide where the jail is.The robber can only get out if another robber touches him or her.&lt;br />&lt;br />Shark&lt;br />&lt;br />Shark, or one man build up, as it is more commonly known,is a very easy game. There is someone it and they have to tag someone else, then they are it as well.&lt;br />&lt;br />Tag:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br />Tag is a game where sombody's it and they have to chase everybody else that is playing. When the person thats it touches somebody else then they are it and they do the same.It is my favourite game because it includes lots of running and it is a fun game to play.&lt;br />&lt;br />  &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
