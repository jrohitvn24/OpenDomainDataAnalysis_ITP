		<content>   There is no church in the area so in
 order to attend church people have to 
 travel to Largoward or Cameron        
 churches. Both of these churches are  
 Presbyterian (Church of Scotland).    
 Other people in the area travel to St.
 Andrews to church.                    
   Our area is within Cameron Parish   
 and is served by an assistant minister
 who is attached here from St. Leonards
 in St. Andrews on a yearly basis      
 therefore, there is no continuity of  
 minister  in the parish. The assistant
 minister conducts services weekly in  
 Cameron Church he is also Chaplain to 
 the school and visits fortnightly.    
   Roman Catholics have to travel into 
 St. Andrews to attend their church.
