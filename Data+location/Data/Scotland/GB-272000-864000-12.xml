		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> My name is Susan Bell. I live on a    
 farm called Farness. There are six of 
 us in the famly, I have three         
 brothers. Usually I get up at twenty  
 past seven and get washed and dressed 
 for half past seven. School starts at 
 9.15a.m.Usually at school in the      
 morning we get some English and some  
 Maths, then we have interval at 10.45 
 We go in again at 11.15. Then         
 sometimes we get History, Geography,  
 Art or Project work.Our lunch interval
 is from 12.30 to 1.30p.m. We then go  
 back in and work till 3.30p.m.        
 When I get home it is about five past 
 four when I do my homework before     
 going out to play. After supper at six
 o'clock I go to play again. I go to   
 bed at nine o'clock. One of my        
 brothers goes to bed at the same time 
 as me because he gets up earlier than 
 I do.                                 </content>
