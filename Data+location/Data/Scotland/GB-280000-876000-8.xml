 We did a survey in our school asking  
 the pupils what their parents did for 
 a living.Most of the mothers were     
 housewives, but there were also many  
 other occupations which varied        
 e.g.teachers,cooks, secretaries and   
 shopkeepers.Many more mothers work    
 nowadays than was the case some years 
 ago.The fathers' occupations were     
 mostly concerned with farming and     
 building.There is not an awful lot of 
 employment in our area since the oil  
 rig fabrication yard at Nigg made a   
 lot of people redundant.Some pupil's  
 parents have unusual jobs-one pupil's 
 father is a B.P. driver and another   
 pupil's mother is a                   
 physiotherapist.There are quite a lot 
 of retired people living in the area  
 who have also spent their working     
 lives here.                           </content>
