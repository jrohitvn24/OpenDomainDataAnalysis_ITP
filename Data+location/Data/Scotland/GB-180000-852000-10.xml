		<title>10TIGH-AN EILEAN HOTEL</title>
		<content>    TIGH-AN EILEAN IS A FAMILY RUN     
 HOTEL ON THE SHORES OF LOCH SHIELDAIG.
 THIS SMALL HOTEL HAS THIRTEEN         
 BEDROOMS.   MY FAMILY HAS TWO LITTLE  
 BEDROOMS AT THE TOP OF THE HOTEL IN   
 WHICH WE SLEEP.                       
    THE HOTEL OPENS IN APRIL AND CLOSES
 IN OCTOBER.   MY DAD HAS RECENTLY     
 OPENED A BAR NEXT TO THE HOTEL AND IT 
 IS DOING VERY WELL.   WE ALSO HAVE A  
 SHOP ON THE OTHER SIDE.   WE HAVE     
 PEOPLE STAYING FROM ALL OVER THE      
 WORLD.   WE SERVE MEALS IN THE DINING 
 ROOM AND BAR.                         
    PEOPLE MEET IN THE BAR.   ALL THE  
 FISHERMEN, SHEPHERDS AND WORKERS COME 
 IN TO HAVE A REST AND HAVE A DRINK.   
    OUR CHEF MARCUS IS AN EXELLENT     
 CHEF.   HE PUTS ON A THREE COURSE MEAL
 EVERY EVENING.                        
    MY PARENTS ARE ALWAYS VERY BUSY    
 WITH THE HOTEL OR SHOP OR BAR.        </content>
