		<content> The Community Centre is housed in     
 Speyside High School and was opened in
 1976.                                 
 The centre has a community lounge,    
 swimming pool, auditorium and games   
 hall. Any of the classrooms in the    
 school can be used as well.           
 It has a lot of different activities  
 such as gymnastics, carpet bowls,     
 badminton, keep fit, youth club,      
 swimming club, volleyball, etc.       
 The swimming pool is used during the  
 day by the schools and later by other 
 groups.                               
 Around 750 people use the centre in an
 average week, quite a few of these    
 from outside the area.                
 The centre has two full-time community
 education workers and a full time pool
 supervisor. In all, it gives full or  
 part-time employment to 15 people.
