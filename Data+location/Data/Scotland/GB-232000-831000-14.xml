		<title>14MORE HAZARDS IN CANNICH</title>
		<content> Dense forests in close proximity to   
 the{farming}areas provide excellent   
 cover for foxes which prey on sheep   
 flocks. Heavy losses are incurred at  
 lambing time and sometimes even older 
 sheep are attacked by these{vermin    
 during the Winter. Golden Eagles,     
 reputed to be rare, but in fact quite 
 plentiful, have been seen to attack   
 and devour quite big lambs, not just  
 young weak ones, but the{conservation 
 laws protect them totally. There are  
 many other{birds of prey}which present
 real dangers to sheep and lambs. Pine 
 Martens destroy poultry.  They too are
 on the increase in the forests.  It is
 thought they are also the culprits    
 when young lambs are bitten about the 
 head and ears but not killed          
 instantly. Infections develop and     
 death usually results a few weeks     
 later.                                </content>
