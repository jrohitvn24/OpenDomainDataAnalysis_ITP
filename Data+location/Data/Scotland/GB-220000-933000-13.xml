		<title>13Post Office at Kylesku</title>
		<content>  Unlike most regions in Britain we    
 have to wait until 5 p.m. for our post
 to arrive. However the post mistress  
 starts work before 9 a.m. Firstly, she
 prepares the mail for despatch. At    
 nine o'clock she sets off with it in  
 the Post Car to hand it over to the   
 Lochinver Post Bus which she meets    
 at the main road, seven miles away.   
 She is back in Kylesku with the Post  
 Office open for business at 10 a.m.   
  Our Post Office must be one of the   
 smallest, most photographed offices in
 the country _ an ex-garden shed.      
  At 2 p.m. the post mistress sets off 
 to collect our mail which has been    
 brought from Lairg by the returning   
 Post Bus. Her next task is sorting out
 the mail. This done, the mail is      
 delivered to the fifty houses on the  
 eighteen mile route and we can read   
 our morning papers at tea time.       </content>
