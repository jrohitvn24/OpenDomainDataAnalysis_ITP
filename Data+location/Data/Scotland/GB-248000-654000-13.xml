		<title>13CHILD'S VIEW 2-S OF BARRHEAD</title>
		<content> continued from page 12                
 The{Craigie}is used by many people in 
 the town for many different reasons.  
 Each year the{Craigie Race}takes place
 on Barrhead's{Gala Day}from the centre
 of town to the summit and return. The 
{Guides}and{Scouts}use it for{sausage  
{sizzles.}You can go and{fish,}go on a{
{family outing,}or even a{school       
{outing.}The view is lovely too. You   
 can go{camping}and have a{treasure    
{hunt}or go in{swimming}with your dog  
 in the dam. You can go for{nature     
{walks.}There are a lot of places to   
 hide and play{hide and seek.}You can  
 come down it easily but you can't get 
 up it as easily. On{Easter Sunday}we  
{roll our eggs}down the Craigie and go 
 exploring all over the place. You need
 to join a club before you can fish but
 you can watch birds or study the wild 
 flowers as there are lots about.      </content>
