		<title>05FARMING IN CUMNOCK</title>
		<content>    The farms in the Cumnock area are  
 mostly dairy farms.  The biggest farm 
 in the Cumnock district is Changue    
 Farm  which belongs to the Stevenson  
 family.                               
                                       
    They produce milk and sell it to   
 the local shops and round the houses. 
 The cattle are mainly Fresian and     
 Ayrshire.  A good dairy cow produces 5
 gallons of milk per day.   The cattle 
 are grazed on managed pasture land    
 which covers most of this area .   In 
 winter the cows are kept on silage    
 also turnips and potatoes.  The cows  
 are kept indoors in the winter but    
 are let out in the summer to graze.   
 The cattle are milked twice a day     
 about 6 am then again about 3 pm.
