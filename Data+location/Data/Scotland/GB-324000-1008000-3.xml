		<title>03MR RITCH'S FARM</title>
		<content> Mr Ritch is a local farmer who owns   
 174 acres. He enjoys farming although 
 it does not have regular hours. When  
 it's silage time they often work late 
 into the night to collect 600 tons    
 of silage for animal feeding.The vet  
 comes to the farm to look at the      
 animals about six times a year.Mr     
 Ritch employs two workers who help him
 to work with 108 animals.There were 63
 calves born last year.Sometimes Mr    
 Ritch gets hardly any sleep at night  
 because of cows calving.His cows      
 produce  around 200 gallons of milk a 
 week.A dairy farm has an early start  
 in the morning as the milk tanker     
 comes about nine to take the milk to  
 Kirkwall. His hens lay about 80-100   
 eggs a day. He thinks farming is an   
 enjoyable and reasonably profitable   
 business.
