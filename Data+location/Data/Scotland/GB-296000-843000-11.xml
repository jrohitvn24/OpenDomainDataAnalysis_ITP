		<title>11EDUCATION IN FERNESS</title>
		<content>   There are no nursery schools or     
 playgroups in the Ferness area.       
   At the age of 4-5 yrs children may  
 enrol at the local village school.    
 This is a single-teacher school with a
 current roll of 11 children. The      
 children remain at the primary school 
 until the age of 11-12 yrs when they  
 transfer to Nairn Academy - 11 miles  
 to the north.                         
   Primary children are brought to the 
 school by car - the furthest pupil    
 comes about 5 miles. School dinners   
 are cooked on the premises in the     
 fully equipped kitchen and most       
 children take advantage of this       
 facility. Secondary school children   
  gather to meet the school bus at 8am 
  in Ferness village and are returned  
  there at about 4:30pm. The nearest   
  colleges are in Inverness or Elgin &amp; 
 Aberdeen has the nearest university.  </content>
