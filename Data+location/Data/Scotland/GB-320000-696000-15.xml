		<title>15WESTFIELD MINE : ENV. IMPACT</title>
		<content> A person passing by Westfield Mining  
 Complex cannot fail to notice the     
 enormous impact which the mining      
 activities have had on the local      
 environment.                          
 The main features are the{spoil heaps 
 of overburden which has been excavated
 from the pit. The heaps have been     
 landscaped to form low hills but it is
 clear that they are{not natural.}Apart
 from the immediate area around the    
 mine where overburden was dumped, the 
 other main area is{Moss Plantation}to 
 the north of Auchterderran which has  
 been completely altered and is said to
 form the largest man made hill in     
 Britain.                              
 Changes are going to take place in the
 landscape around the pit in the near  
 future as the pit is going to be      
 filled in and obviously some of the   
 waste materials will be used for this.</content>
