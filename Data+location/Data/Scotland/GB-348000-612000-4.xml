 People now have the  opportunity  to  
 buy their council houses and in  the  
 last four years 220 houses have been  
 purchased .   These tend to be the    
 modern or recently modernised         
 buildings and are not restricted to   
 any particular area.                  
 The Housing Department are on the     
 whole satisfied with the standard of  
 housing but feel there's always room  
 for improvement.   They are making    
 efforts to provide for the needs of   
 both young and elderly single         
 people,and single parent families.    
 They would like to provide at least   
 50 more units of sheltered housing for
 the elderly.                          </content>
