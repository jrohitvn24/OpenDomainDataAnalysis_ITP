		<title>01Anstruther - Introduction</title>
		<content>   Our block lies to the SE of St      
 Andrews on the north coast of the     
 River Forth in a part called the "East
 Neuk" or east corner of Fife.         
   The block divides naturally into 4  
 bands - the sea, the foreshore, the   
 towns and the farmland.               
   The towns are Anstruther, Cellardyke
 and the small village of Kilrenny.    
   The area has been described as      
 delightful, charismatic, picturesque  
 and unspoilt and is very popular with 
 tourists.                             
   Many inhabitants of our area choose 
 to stay in these surroundings and     
 travel to work by car or bus to towns 
 such as Dundee, Glenrothes, Kirkcaldy,
 Leven and St Andrews.  Many men now   
 work away from home in the oil related
 industries.                           
 We enjoy staying in this area.  There 
 are always plenty of things to do.    </content>
