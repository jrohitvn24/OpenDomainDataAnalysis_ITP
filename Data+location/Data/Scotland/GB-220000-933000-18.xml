		<title>18Tourists at Kylesku.</title>
		<content>  Two of our regular visitors come up  
 to Kylesku 10 to 15 times a year. They
 come because of the mountains and sea,
 the fishing, sailing, walking in wild 
 places and the friendly people. Their 
 holiday home, built in 1805, was the  
 school at one time. It has an outside 
 toilet, no central heating and no     
 electricity. They enjoy "getting away 
 from their busy life style in         
 Pitlochry".                           
  Many people visit our area during the
 holiday season. Some tourists only    
 pass through because there is a bridge
 now, but others stay a while.         
  Most of the tourists I questioned    
 said the beautiful scenery and the    
 peacefulness were the main            
 attractions.                          
  Last year a new chalet park was      
 opened, giving more accommodation to  
 those wishing to visit the North West.</content>
