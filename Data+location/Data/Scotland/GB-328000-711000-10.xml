		<content> 20 is generally considered to be the  
 viable number for a rural primary     
 school. When numbers drop below this, 
 closure is threatened on both         
 educational and financial grounds.    
 The campaign by locals to save        
 Collessie Primary School began in 1980
 and included making representations to
 the Schools Council and Education     
 Committee. These efforts failed and   
 many felt that this was a great blow  
 to the community. Coffee evenings and 
 night classes had been held in the    
 school. The latter were held in the   
 village hall but ended within a year  
 because of lack of support. One parent
 felt that the closure of the school   
 "Had taken the heart out of the       
 community!". Former pupils attended a 
 function to mark the closure of the   
 school. The building itself was sold  
 and is now a private house            </content>
