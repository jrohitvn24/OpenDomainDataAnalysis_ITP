		<title>13Rowallan Creamery</title>
		<content> Founded in 1888 by three farmers under
 the name of "John Wallace &amp; Co. N.B." 
 (North Britain), in 1926 under the new
 ownership of Mr.Mair and Mr.Caddis it 
 was renamed "Rowallan Creamery" after 
 the nearby Rowallan Castle.           
 It is the oldest creamery in Britain  
 standing on its original site. The    
 modern three storey administration    
 building, factory, canteen etc.take up
 five acres of land. There are in total
 250 employees, 105 male and 145       
 female. Margarine and cooking fats are
 produced from imported oils of many   
 kinds and to a minor degree from rape 
 seed.                                 
 Under the trade name "Banquet",       
 Rowallan margarine is sold all over   
 Britain and Northern Ireland; under   
 other names it is sold by supermarkets
 and chain stores e.g.Tesco and Marks  
 and Spencers.                         </content>
