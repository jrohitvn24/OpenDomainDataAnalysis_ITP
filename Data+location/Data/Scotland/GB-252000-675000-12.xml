		<title>12MUGDOCK COUNTRY PARK</title>
		<content> Craigend Castle also needs repairing. 
 The stables near this castle are going
 to be converted into a visitor centre 
 and every body interested in the park 
 is looking forward to this.           
      On the top of the hill you can   
 see over into the valley of the Clyde.
 Here there is a second World War gun  
 site .The guns have gone but the      
 stands where they were are still      
 there.They helped protect Clydebank   
 from the German planes but did not    
 shoot down any.                       
      The country park gives employment
 to young people who work in the park  
 grounds and also the rangers and stone
 mason.It is a nice place to go for the
 day for all the people who live in the
 Glasgow area.
