		<title>09BALLATER CAR-PARKS SURVEY</title>
		<content> There are two main car-parks in       
 Ballater.                             
            Station Square             
 This is a rectangular shaped car-park 
 which may hold between 30 and 40 cars.
 It is just in front of the old railway
 station and near the shops.During our 
 morning study we learned that most    
 drivers parked for a short time only. 
 The same amount of vistors and locals 
 parked in the square.  Most of the    
 tourists visited the information      
 centre and cafe during the morning    
 survey.  In the afternoon there were  
 many more vehicles but again the same 
 number of tourists and locals.  There 
 were also three Swedish visitors in   
 the car-park. There are no charges    
 for using the carparking facilities in
 Ballater.
