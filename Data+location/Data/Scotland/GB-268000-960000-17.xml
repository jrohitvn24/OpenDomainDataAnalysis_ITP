		<title>17VILLAGE HALL BETTYHILL</title>
		<content> one of the most important buildings   
 in any Highland village is its village
 hall - a community centre usually     
 built and paid for by the people      
 themselves. To find out about the hall
 we interviewed the Chairman of the    
 present hall committee.               
 The Chairman told us he had been      
 involved with the running of the hall 
 since it was built in 1955. The       
 committee usually has a membership of 
 15 to 17. The hall was recently       
 renovated and reopened by the County  
 M.P. Mr Robert Maclennan on 16        
 December 83. The renovation cost      
 Â£52,000 which was made up of capital  
 grants from HIDB, the SED and the HRC.
 Rebuilding was done by local          
 contractors and took 6 months to      
 complete. Financially it is a success,
 but it is a strain on the community   
 finding money to keep it going.       </content>
