  The caravan park is situated behind  
 the Allanbank Hotel beside the River  
 Allan. It is a Caravan Club site and  
 only members of the Club may put their
 caravans on the site.                 
  Caravanners normally stay for 1 or 2 
 days or for a weekend, but some stay  
 for 1 or 2 weeks. Keen fishermen stay 
 longer as there is good fishing on the
 river. Lovely rainbow trout can be    
 fished there if you have a permit.    
  The site opens in time for the Easter
 weekend and closes at the end of      
 September.It is looked after by a     
 warden during the season that it is   
 occupied.It is a lovely flat site and 
 ideally situated for people who wish  
 to tour the beautiful countryside in  
 and around Perthshire.
