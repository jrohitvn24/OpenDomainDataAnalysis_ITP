		<title>18RELIGIONS IN KNIGHTSRIDGE</title>
		<content>   The majority of practising          
 Christians in Knightsridge            
 belong to the Ecumenical Parish       
 congregation which worships in        
 Knightsridge Primary School.          
   Roman Catholics from Knightsridge   
 worship in St. Peter's R.C. Church    
 which was recently built in           
 Carmondean. They previously used      
 Knightsridge Primary School hall but  
 Mass was celebrated at a different    
 time from the Protestant service.     
   Also in Knightsridge we have many   
 practising Jehovah's Witnesses who    
 have to travel outwith Knightsridge to
 worship as a congregation.            
   There is no provision made for      
 Baptists, Pentecostals or other       
 Christian denominations, nor for      
 Muslims although these groups are     
 represented in Knightsridge.
