 The farmers all provided housing for  
 their workers.Most of the farmers had 
 cows on their farms.Some had North    
 Country Cheviot sheep.The most common 
 crops grown were{wheat,barley and     
{turnips.}The farmers all used the     
 system known as{crop rotation.}       
     All were grateful for{pesticides} 
 although they thought they could be   
 harmful on occasion.                  
     Every farmer enjoyed his life and 
 wouldn't dream of changing their jobs.
 They all thought that farming has     
 changed tremendously during the last  
 30 years.With one exception they all  
 thought their farms were modern and   
 up to date.All of them use some acres 
 for{woodland}and{wildlife.
