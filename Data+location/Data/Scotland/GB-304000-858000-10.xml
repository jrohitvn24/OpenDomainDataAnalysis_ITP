		<title>10ATTITUDES FORRES EAST</title>
		<content> We asked some 13-year-old children    
 what their attitudes were on local    
 things. We asked them :-              
    If they would prefer to shop in a  
 supermarket which sells everything in 
 one shop or in a group of small shops 
 which sell different things. 78% said 
 they would prefer to shop in          
 supermarkets. 22% said they would     
 prefer to shop in small shops.        
    If they thought supermarkets should
 be built in a town centre or outside  
 the town where they were less obvious.
 86% said it should be be built outside
 the town, and 14% said it should be   
 built in the town centre.             
    If they thought Forres should have 
 more evening entertainment ie. discos,
 cinemas and dances. Everyone thought  
 it should have more evening           
 entertainment.                        
                                       </content>
