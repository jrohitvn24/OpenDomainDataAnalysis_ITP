   There are several people in the area
 who are  skilled  in  such  crafts  as
 painting, pottery, soft toy making and
 modelling. Many  of the women are also
 skilled  knitters  but  just  for  the
 family. Most of the crafts are hobbies
 although some articles like the models
 of birds and animals are sold  in  the
 hotels  to  tourists.  Some  paintings
 have  been  exhibited  locally and are
 offered for  sale.  Many articles made
 by the members of  the  Women's  Rural
 Institute are  exhibited  each year at
 the local agricultural  shows at Keith
 and Grantown.
