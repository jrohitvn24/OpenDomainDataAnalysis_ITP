         Most houses have calor gas    
 stoves and additional heating units.  
                                       
    SEWAGE AND WASTE DISPOSAL          
                                       
        There is no mains sewage. Each 
 new house that is built must have a   
 septic tank to treat the sewage before
 discharging it into the sea.          
     All combustible household waste is
 burnt. Waste metal and glass are      
 dumped at a chosen spot on the        
 coastline and are  hopefully washed   
 away to the depths or quickly rust    
 away.                                 
    A great deal of waste from passing 
 ships is washed up on the shore. Wood 
 is collected for the fires, and some  
 useful items are kept for possible    
 future use, but the majority of the   
 waste is an unsightly nuisance.       </content>
