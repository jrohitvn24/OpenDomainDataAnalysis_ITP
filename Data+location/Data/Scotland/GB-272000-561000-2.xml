		<title>02Midpark Area</title>
		<content> The Midpark Area is mainly grazing    
 land but it has a few areas of        
 deciduous trees. There are no farms.  
                                       
 TRANSPORT: The A713 is the Castle     
 Douglas to Ayr road and runs through  
 the centre of the area. There is a bus
 service twice a day that goes to Ayr. 
 A disused railway runs parallel to the
 road. It was closed down twenty years 
 ago. Since then the road has become   
 busier especially during the holidays.
                                       
 LAND USE: The land is used mainly for 
 sheep and beef cattle grazing. There  
 are no crops growing in the area      
 because the farms have more suitable  
 land outside the area.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
