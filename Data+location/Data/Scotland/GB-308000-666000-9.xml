		<content>  If you love animals and plants       
 you will love Almondell.              
  There is every kind of woodland      
 animal.There are foxes,squirrels,     
 badgers,rabbits and moles.The badgers 
 could be in danger because of badger  
 baiting. Badger baiting is done by    
 sending a terrier dog down the        
 badger's hole to fight.               
  The mink has been driving otters out 
 of their habitat.The Greater Spotted  
 Woodpecker has often been seen in the 
 park this summer.Kingfishers are often
 spotted near the sewage outfall.      
  Fishing down Almondell is good.Trout 
 is a popular catch and salmon have    
 been coming up the river this year.   
  The trees down Almondell are mostly  
 deciduous- Horse Chestnut,Oak,        
 Sycamore,Elm,Pine,Douglas Fir etc.    
 Elms are dying out because of the     
 Dutch Elm Disease.Helen &amp; Carol-Anne  </content>
