		<title>17Wildlife in Screel Area 1</title>
		<content> On Monday the 27th of May 1985, our   
 Domesday group went exploring our     
 area. The area, being very rural, has 
 lots of wildlife.                     
 When we walked along one particular   
 road we saw an adder. Adders have     
 black zig-zag markings on their backs 
 and the ones we saw looked exactly    
 like what I've described them like.   
 An adder is dangerous because of its  
 poisonous bite. If when you are bitten
 you rush around screaming, then the   
 poison gets through your body quicker,
 so you will most probably die but if  
 you keep still and stay calm for about
 half an hour then your blood would    
 clean away the poison and you would be
 fine.                                 
 We also noticed some deer when we were
 walking and we've learnt that they are
 red deer. In Scotland as forests      
 disappear it is becoming a moorland   </content>
