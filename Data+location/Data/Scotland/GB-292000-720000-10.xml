		<content>       {INCHAFFREY ABBEY               
 The Abbey was built about 1200AD by   
 Gilbert,Third Earl of Strathearn.     
 Many students came here to be taught  
 by the monks over the next four       
 centuries.                            
 Abbot Maurice ofInchaffrey was        
 chaplain to Robert the Bruce. Before  
 the Battle of Bannockburn,1214,he     
 blessed the Scottish army. During the 
 battle he carried a holy relic among  
 the troops,the embalmed arm of        
 St.Fillan. In thanks Robert gave money
 for the draining of the marsh lands   
 round the abbey by the digging of the 
 Pow Water,a drainage canal.           
 Bruce is also said to have met John   
 Comyn at this abbey when they were    
 Joint Guardians of Scotland.          
 The abbey was destroyed at the        
 Refomation.
