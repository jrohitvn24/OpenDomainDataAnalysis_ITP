		<title>16GAMES IN KILMARNOCK</title>
		<content> These are the two most popular games  
 that children play in New Farm.       
{SNOOKER-}To play Snooker you use a    
 Snooker cue to hit a white ball which 
 then hits a red ball. When the red    
 ball is potted you try to pot a       
 yellow, green, brown, blue, black or  
 pink ball. Each colour of ball potted 
 gets a different number of points     
 ;e.g. red- 1, black- 7. The player    
 with the most points at the end is the
 winner.                               
{CODES-}To play codes you pick teams   
 and one team is Runners and one team  
 is Chasers. If the Chasers catch one  
 of the Runners they tickle them to try
 to make the Runner tell one letter.   
 When the Chasers have caught all the  
 Runners, they jumble all the letters  
 up to make a word. Then the Runners   
 are Chasers and the Chasers are       
 Runners.                              </content>
