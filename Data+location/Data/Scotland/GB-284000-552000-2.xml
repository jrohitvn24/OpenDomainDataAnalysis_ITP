		<content>   There are two shops in the area     
 which open only in the summer for the 
 benefit of tourists.                  
                                       
   One is called "June's Pantry" and   
 sells tweeds,woollen sweaters,scarves 
 and tartan capes.It also has pottery, 
 ceramics and semi-precious stones.If  
 you wish,you can sit down and have tea
 or coffee and home-made scones.       
                                       
   The other shop is called "The Brae".
 It sells little gifts of all kinds,   
 honey,jam and pottery.                
                                       
   Very few of the goods sold in the   
 shops are made in the area. Most are  
 bought in from other parts of         
 Scotland.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
