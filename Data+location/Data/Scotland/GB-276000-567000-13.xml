		<title>13Our Birds</title>
		<content> We get lots of different kinds of     
 birds in Dumfries and Galloway but I'm
 only writing about the ones around    
 Kirkpatrick Durham and Bridge of      
 Urr.                                  
 The most common bird is the crow and I
 think the greater spotted woodpecker. 
 The ones in between are the swift,    
 wren, kestrel, buzzard, blackbird,    
 magpie, jay, great tit, blue tit,     
 nuthatch, tree creeper, wryneck,      
 swallow, yellow wagtail, rook, jackdaw
 and kingfisher.                       
 The kestrel is a bird of prey. There  
 are a lot of birds that are birds of  
 prey. Here are some birds of prey:    
 tawny owl, barn owl, buzzard and the  
 merlin. In the birds I just mentioned 
 the only dangerous ones are the owls, 
 but only if you go near the nests.    
 Some can be really tame like the      
 sparrows, tits and wagtails.          </content>
