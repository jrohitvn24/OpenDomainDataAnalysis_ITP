		<title>13A DAIRY FARM AT SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>   During July Mr Ross and his father  
 get up at 6.45am every morning and    
 start the milking. They milk 44 cows. 
 Breakfast is at 8.00am then they feed 
 the beasts, 20 Galloway beef cows. The
 milk tanker collects the milk every   
 second day.                           
   Before lunch which is from 12.00 to 
 1.00pm, they check for couped sheep.  
 Then they have lunch. The farmers have
 a helper called Ian who helps with the
 hay. First they cut the hay with a    
 mower and leave it to dry. Next the   
 haybob turns the hay over twice. when 
 it is ready they row it up, bale it   
 and stack it on a clamp which takes 17
 bales.                                
   The second milking is from 3.00 to  
 3.45pm. Tea is from 4.00 to 4.45pm.   
 After tea they work until all the hay 
 in the field is baled. There are 15   
 acres of hay and 45 acres of silage.  </content>
