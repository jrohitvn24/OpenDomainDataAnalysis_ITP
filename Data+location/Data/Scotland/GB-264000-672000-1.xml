    A mainly residential commuter town 
 for the city of Glasgow,our D.Block is
 surrounded by agricultural land.      
    Many people have come to live here 
 from Glasgow under the'City overspill 
 plan'which has been in operation for  
 the last twenty years.This has meant a
 large increase in population and the  
 building of new housing.This has also 
 meant an increase in schools,shops,   
 community centres,play areas and      
 public services such as Doctors'      
 surgeries and Public Transport.       
    Kirkintilloch is a busy friendly   
 town with a long and interesting      
 history but also with a young         
 population and hopefully a promising  
 future.
