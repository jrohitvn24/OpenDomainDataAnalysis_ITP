		<content> Agriculture is the main industry on   
 the island,almost every one's         
 involved.Most people farm sheep,but   
 some cows are kept.The lambs are      
 sold in autumn and shipped to the     
 mainland.                             
    Sheep are also kept for their wool 
 and they are sheared in early         
 July.(shetland wool is very warm      
 and light in weight).The {Shetland    
{sheep}are small but are often crossed 
 with larger breeds to produce bigger  
 carcasses. These large sheep eat more 
 and some supplementary foods are      
 needed in{Winter}e.g sheep nuts,      
 treacle,hay and silage.               
    There are few cows here, and their 
 main product is beef calves to sell.  
   Potatoes and other root crops are   
 produced for home consumption as are  
 pork and poultry.
