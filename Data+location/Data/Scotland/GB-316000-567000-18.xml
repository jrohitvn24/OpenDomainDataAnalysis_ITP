		<title>18Vandalism</title>
		<content>    Most children in Annan are usually 
 moaning about having nothing to do.   
 There are a few parks but most of them
 are unsafe or have been vandalised.   
 Vandalism was the subject of a meeting
 called by our school chaplain, the    
 Rev. Ferguson. The amount of vandalism
 in Annan is terrible. The toilets by  
 the bus station are disgraceful. Hard 
 luck for visitors wanting the toilet  
 when they get off the bus. Many walls 
 are covered in slogans written with   
 spray and pen that doesn't wipe off.  
 Derelict buildings soon have their    
 windows broken and litter lies about  
 the street waiting to be cleaned up by
 the road sweeper on his rounds. Most  
 people who live here think that Annan 
 has a place in the vandalism stakes.
