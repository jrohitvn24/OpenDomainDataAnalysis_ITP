		<content> There are several institutions of     
 education in our area.  Our own,      
 Clermiston Primary, takes children    
 from the local area from the age of   
 four and a half for seven years when  
 they move on to Secondary education.  
 There is also a nursery department    
 where they can begin at three years.  
 Other Primary schools in the area are 
 Corstorphine, Drumbrae, East Craigs   
 and Gylemuir.  The oldest Primary     
 school in our area is Corstorphine, a 
 large, stone-built structure.  East   
 Craigs is the newest, being modern    
 open-plan design instead of individual
 classrooms.  Craigmount High is the   
 only Secondary school, but there is an
 important college, Queen Margaret     
 College, which trains people for posts
 in speech therapy, physiotherapy,     
 dietetics, home economics etc.
