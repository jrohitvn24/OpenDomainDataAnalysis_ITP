		<title>13INTERVIEW WITH CELEBRITY</title>
		<content> We interviewed{Mr Edward McGregor,}one
 of our best known senior citizens. At 
 85 he is full of fun and is very      
 interested in young people. He was    
 born in 1899 in Deanston and then his 
 family moved to Doune in 1904 and has 
 lived there ever since. His school    
 life was very strict but happy.       
 Children enjoyed ball games, marbles  
 and skipping. They had to be in the   
 house by 8 o'clock, even as older     
 boys, to get up for school at 7 am.   
 He went to the navy as a youny lad;   
 on his return to Doune he admired the 
 work that Erskine Hospital was doing  
 so he started to row for charity.     
 He is well known for the large amount 
 of money he has raised through        
 sponsors. He saw the building of      
 Castle Hill Estate and the new housing
 since then. He prefers life now, but  
 says the old times were good too.     </content>
