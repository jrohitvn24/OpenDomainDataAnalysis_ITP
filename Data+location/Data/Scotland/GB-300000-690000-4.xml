		<content> Saline Primary School was built in    
 1875 with an extension being built in 
 1909. A second building was erected in
 1928 and the two buildings served as a
 Primary and Secondary School for the  
 village and surrounding area until    
 1955. Mrs Margaret Proudfoot is the   
 present Headteacher of Saline Primary 
 School, having a teaching staff of    
 nine, a nursery nurse and a teaching  
 auxilliary. The 206 pupils are taught 
 a wide variety of subjects in keeping 
 with the high standard of education   
 available in Fife Region. The school  
 children who stay at school for lunch 
 have witnessed a pleasant alteration  
 to the school building this year when 
 a classroom was converted into a      
 kitchen. This eliminated the transport
 of meals from a central kitchen 16    
 miles away.                           
 The school motto is Finis Coronat Opus</content>
