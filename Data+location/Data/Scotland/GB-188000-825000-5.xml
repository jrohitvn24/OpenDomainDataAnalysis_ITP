		<title>05CHANGES IN DORNIE VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> The main changes in the area have been
 the reduction in the number of houses.
 There were many more after the first  
 war.There were more women than men    
 after the first war. This meant more  
 cooperation between people than there 
 is now particularly in such activities
 as peat cutting. There were many more 
 shops than now.There were boatbuilders
 a china shop,a tailor shop,two        
 smithies,a bank and a butcher shop.   
 The houses were very poor with no     
 sanitation or power.There were few    
 tourists.Now there are very few       
 services.The village is untidy with   
 lots of garbage.It used to be tidy and
 no one put litter on the shore.There  
 were of course no tin cans or plastic 
 bottles which now litter the place.
