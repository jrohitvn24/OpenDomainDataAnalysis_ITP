		<title>06FARMING IN THE BRAES</title>
		<content>   With  all  the  land in the Braes at
 over 1000 feet  above sea  level,  the
 farmers  have  a  hard  task   raising
 cattle  and  sheep.  The  winters  are
 severe  with movement usually hampered
 by deep snow.  Most  cattle are housed
 from November till April but the sheep
 are outside all year. All  the animals
 have  to be  fed  with  hay  or silage
 which is  conserved  during  the short
 summer. The main crop is  grass,  with
 turnips  and  barley  grown for winter
 feed, and fodder  rape to fatten lambs
 which spend the  summer  on the hills.
 The  cows  rear  their  own calves and
 these are sold  at about 1 year old in
 the store  market at Tomintoul, Elgin,
 Dufftown or Huntly.  Lambs are born in
 April and May and these  are sold from
 September   onwards  with  the  farmer
 retaining the  ewe  lambs to enter the
 breeding flock.                       </content>
