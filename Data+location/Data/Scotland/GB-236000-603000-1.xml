		<title>01Area Surrounding Straiton</title>
		<content> A mixed farming area of hills and     
 small valleys.  The village of        
 Straiton is the focal point of the    
 area.  Sheep graze on the hills and   
 moorland and are mainly of the black  
 faced variety for production of wool. 
 There are signs of afforestation being
 undertaken by the Forestry Commission 
 on the outer limits of the block and  
 a small administration centre is to be
 found in the village.  Small pockets  
 of deciduous and coniferous trees may 
 be seen in the uncultivated areas.    
 The picturesque village is popular    
 with summer tourists and the day to   
 day needs of the local community are  
 served by only four commercial        
 enterprises, namely a garage, general 
 store, post office and small hotel.   
 The two teacher primary school has a  
 roll of 30.
