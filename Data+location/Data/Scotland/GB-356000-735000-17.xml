		<title>17GAMES IN CARNOUSTIE AREA.</title>
		<content>   Here are some of the games played by
 children in this area.                
                                       
{  RED ROVER} This is a game played by 
 any number of people.  There are two  
 teams, A and B, each team holding     
 hands.  Team A calls over someone from
 Team B, who tries to break through the
 hands of Team A.  If he succeeds he is
 allowed to go back to his own team,   
 but if he does not, he joins Team A.  
 This continues, with each team taking 
 it in turns to call, until all the    
 players are in one team.              
                                       
{  DRACULA  }All the players sit on the
 garden wall of one of their houses,   
 backs towards the house. One person   
 hides in the garden and the rest go to
 look for him.  When they get near him 
 he jumps out and tries to catch them.
