		<content>   Fresian is the main breed of dairy  
 cow although a few Ayrshires are kept.
 The cows are milked regularily, once  
 at about 0600hrs and again at about   
 1700hrs.  Some dairy farms milk in    
 tied byres, the milk being piped to   
 their dairies.  However herring-bone  
 parlours are becoming more common.    
   At peak production cows will yield  
 an average of about 34 litres per day.
 This milk is taken by tanker to the   
 Claymore Creamery where it is pastur- 
 ised and bottled for sale or made into
 'Orkney Cheese'.  Milk quotas have    
 caused an increase in sheep numbers on
 dairy farms.                          
   Beef and dairy farms commonly use   
 Shetland/Cheviot ewes sired by a      
 Suffolk ram.  Lambing is usually in   
 spring and the lambs are sold locally 
 the following October.  A few farms   
 house their sheep over the winter.    </content>
