		<content> When we were doing the Domesday       
 Project we found two shut down        
 schools.The Holy Family Roman Catholic
 School, which was an infant school,and
 Stockethill School.The Holy Family    
 School was shut down because there    
 weren't enough pupils. The school     
 transferred to different premises.    
 Stockethill was a secondary school,   
 and was used as an extension of       
 Northfield Academy. It was closed due 
 to lack of pupils. The pupils that    
 were left just went to Northfield     
 Academy which is nearby.
