		<content>    The area lies to the southwest of  
 Glasgow straddling the Ayr-Renfrew    
 county border and consists of gently  
 rolling farmland crisscrossed by small
 streams.Patches of mainly deciduous   
 woodland add interest to the scene.The
 one steep hillside borders the        
 northern shore of Loch Libo,a nature  
 reserve,rising to 259m at Corkindale  
 Law which offers a panoramic view of  
 the surrounding countryside.          
    The only centre of population is   
 the commuter village of Uplawmoor to  
 the southeast of the A736 Glasgow to  
 Irvine road.However newly-built       
 bungalows may be seen along many of   
 the sideroads which serve the farms.  
    A constant stream of commuter and  
 commercial traffic moves along the    
 A736 which runs parallel to the less  
 busy railway line to the coast.
