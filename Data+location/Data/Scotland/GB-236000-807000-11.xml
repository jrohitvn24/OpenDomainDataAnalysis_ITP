		<content> The{Save the Abbey School Action      
{Committee }wrote to all the former    
 pupils and parents of present pupils  
 explaining the position and asking for
 aid.They also advertised in the       
 nationat press and appealed through   
 radio and television.                 
    Happily financial aid and the      
 promise of additional pupils was      
 forecoming and it was decided that the
 school would not close.               
   Local people who are employed at the
 Abbey are hoping that the improvement 
 will continue and that they will not  
 have to endure a similar experience in
 future years.                         
 The school is part of a  {Benedictine 
{Abbey}which stands on the site of a   
 Government fort built at the time of  
 the{Jacobite Uprisings }in the early  
 eighteenth century.
