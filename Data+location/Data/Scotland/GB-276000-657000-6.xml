		<title>06FARMING IN THE LOCAL AREA</title>
		<content>  With the local area being mainly an  
 urbanised area with a damp climate the
 local farmers concentrate on dairy    
 farming.The farms are mixed with crops
 and dairy cattle.The crops are almost 
 entirely grass crops such a hay ,     
 silage and pasture grass.             
  This years hay crop was very poor    
 because of the very wet summer.       
  The two main types of dairy cattle   
 are Friesian and Ayrshire             
  There are also a few market gardens  
 within our area.These nurseries are   
 usually under glass and provide       
 vegtables,salad crops and cut flowers.
  Other uses of the land which is not  
 built-up include:                     
 Woodland (usually found along the     
 river valleys),                       
 and rough grassland
