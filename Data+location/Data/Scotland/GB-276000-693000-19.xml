		<title>19Cornton Vale Prison,Stirling</title>
		<content> This is the only{woman's prison}in the
 whole of Scotland. It is located in   
 our area because it is central for big
 cities such as{Glasgow, Edinburgh,}and
{Dundee.}These cities have higher crime
 rates. It is 10 years old and has 190 
 staff, 19 of whom are men. The prison 
 can hold{190}inmates in single room   
 accommodation. There are 5 main living
 blocks, 2 large workshops, an         
 education unit, cookhouse, laundry,   
 chapel, gym, and a large garden area. 
                                       
 All inmates are in full-time work in  
 those places. The prison has its own  
 earning scheme, but the pay is not    
 very high. The inmate's day starts at 
{6.30am}and they are locked away at    
{9.30pm.}At the moment there are 155   
 inmates from 16 years upwards, most of
 the inmates are in the 25-35 years    
 age group.                            </content>
