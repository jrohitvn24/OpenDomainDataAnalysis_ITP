		<content> There is a strong tradition in textile
 manufacturing in the Valley.At its    
 peak in the late 19th century over 400
 people worked in 6 mills in the       
 production of lace,madras and woollen 
 goods.This is now fallen to 108 people
 in 2 mills which produce woollen goods
 only.One mill specialises in Aran and 
 Shetland products.The goods are       
 produced for a foreign market and go  
 abroad by road.The second mill uses   
 wool and acrylic to produce jumpers   
 with sporting motifs for a home       
 market.The employees are              
 predominantly female.Of the total work
 force 88% are female and 12% male.    
  Their present locations reflect the  
 former water power requirements.
