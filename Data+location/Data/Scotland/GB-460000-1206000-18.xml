		<content> The families who now live in          
 Baltasound are usually people whose   
 families moved into the area from     
 north or south of the island.The      
 oldest residents are probably the     
 laird's family-the Edmonstons Saxbys  
 who have been here at least 150 years.
 Originally local names followed the   
 Viking system of using Patronyms,where
 the child took the fathers Christian  
 name as a surname.e.g.fathers name    
{John}son's name James{Johnson.}So     
 there are a lot of such names like    
{Hughson,Henderson,Johnson,Robertson   
 and{Thomson}though the Patronym       
 system  has died out. To avoid        
 confusion people were often given     
 nicknames like Jim o'the Point because
 he lives out at the point of Skeo     
 Taing.  These nicknames are widely    
 used today.
