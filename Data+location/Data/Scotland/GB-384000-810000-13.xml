		<title>13Life of a Helicopter Pilot</title>
		<content>   {Paul Evans,}an aimiable 25 year old
 from Eastbourne, is a pilot with      
 Bristows Helicopters in the North Sea 
 Operations Area.                      
    His normal working day begins early
 as he has to report in at least 1 hour
 before the usual departure time of    
 0700 hours. This check-in time is     
 vital as during it Paul has to        
 consider a number of "Operational     
 Criteria" such as Destination,        
 Weather, etc., which allows him to    
 compute the weight of fuel he is      
 likely to need. This then allows him  
 to calculate the "payload" available  
 to the Company chartering the craft - 
 number of men, luggage and so on.
