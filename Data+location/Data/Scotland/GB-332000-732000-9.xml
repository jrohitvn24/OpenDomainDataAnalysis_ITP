 Stoney Groves is a moderately sized   
 farm belonging to a Mr Clayhills-     
 Henderson. Across the way there is a  
 croft called "Little Stoneygroves."   
 This is surrounded by 14 acres of land
 which cultivates mainly root crops.   
 The land belongs to a Mr Hamilton who 
 also owns an area of woodland adjacent
 to his fields.                        
    The site and house are privately   
 owned.The house itself is built to    
 very modern standards and is presently
 owned by a Mr and Mrs Arnold who have 
 resided here for the past 15 years.   
     It is situated on a fairly busy   
 country road which acts as a main     
 routeway between Muirhead/Birkhill and
 the villages of Liff and Fowlis.
