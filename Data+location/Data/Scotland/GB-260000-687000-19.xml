		<title>19Working from home: FINTRY</title>
		<content> Having salesmen scattered from        
 Darlington in England to Inverness in 
 Scotland, I am responsible for the    
 recruitment, training, sales targeting
 and motivation of a sales team.       
                                       
 Fintry has good access to motorways   
 and airports, Edinburgh, Glasgow and  
 Stirling, therefore it is a site with 
 excellent communications.             
                                       
 Home offers peace and quiet and few   
 interuptions, unlike a normal office  
 complex, and yet gives access to all  
 facilities, equipment and support     
 staff, which makes for efficient      
 working.                              
                                       
 There are two possible drawbacks; the 
 loss of a room at home and the        
 inability, to slip in for a noggin on 
 the way home,{but neither apply to me.</content>
