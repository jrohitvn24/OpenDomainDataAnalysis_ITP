		<content> We interviewed Mr.A, the assistant    
 accountant at the Royal Bank of       
 Scotland. He told us that he took the 
 job because it was a step on the      
 ladder of promotion. He enjoys his    
 work but sometimes he gets bored. He  
 had to get special training and has   
 been working in the bank for three    
 years now. He starts work at 9.00am   
 and finishes at 5.00pm. He works five 
 days a week and gets 25 days of       
 holidays a year. Machines are used to 
 count the money in the bank and at the
 moment there is about 50-60 thousand  
 pounds in the vault. The building has 
 been there for sixteen years now, and 
 the "Cashline" machine for six years. 
 The bank's sign shows arrows pointing 
 into a circle, which represents money 
 coming into the banking circle. Mr.A  
 Lives nearby but still drives to work.
 He enjoys sport,gardening and reading.</content>
