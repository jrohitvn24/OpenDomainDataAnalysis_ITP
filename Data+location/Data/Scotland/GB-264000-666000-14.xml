		<title>14RESULTS OF THE  PIT CLOSURE</title>
		<content>{Q. What effect has the closing of the 
{pit had on the people in Cardowan     
{village ?                             
 A.  The village's population has gone 
 down because some of the workers have 
 transferred to other areas.  Local    
 shops have found that business has    
 fallen off due to the unemployment in 
 the area.                             
{Q. Did you have a choice whether or   
{not to accept redundancy or to move to
{another pit ?                         
 A. I could have moved to Frances      
 Colliery in Fife, but I did not want  
 to leave this area as all my family   
 live nearby.  So I accepted           
 redundancy.                           
{Q. Have you managed to find another   
{job ?                                 
 A. No, I have been unemployed since I 
 left the Colliery.
