		<title>09KNOCKNAGAEL STUD FARM</title>
		<content>     This is the main farm of a group  
 of                                    
 farms belonging to the Department of  
 Agriculture and Fisheries             
 (Scotland).The others are Balrobert,  
 Beechwood and Aberchalder.            
    It is a special farm because it    
 sends pedigreed bulls and rams to     
 crofting counties mainly in the{      
{WESTERN ISLES}of Scotland, to help the
 quality of breeding.                  
    There are 2 schemes _ the{SUPPLY   
{BULL SCHEME}and the{SHEEP IMPROVEMENT 
{SCHEME.}In 1985 there were over 200   
 bulls and 1500 rams available.        
    We saw Hereford, Aberdeen Angus,   
 Shorthorn and Luing bulls.The rams    
 were Blackface and Cheviot.           
    We saw Shetland cattle which are   
 smaller than ordinary cattle. There   
 was a 4day old calf. It was lovely.
