		<title>02LOCHALSH PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> A church has been recorded on this    
 site from about 600 AD.At the time of 
 its founding Lochalsh Church was in   
 the Celtic sphere of influence.The    
 present building was completed in 1641
 and reroofed in 1791.The same slates  
 are on the building today.The church  
 has seating for some 300 people and   
 over 30 children attend Sunday school.
 Six years ago a church hall was built 
 100yd to the west of the church.It has
 since had another room added.It is    
 used for Brownies and Sunday school   
 as well as by other organisations.    
  A burial ground surrounds the Church.
  A new burial ground has recently been
 consecrated further west near         
 Balmacara House.                      
  An ancient cemetery called "Cnoc-nan-
 Aingil" is on top of a knoll across   
 the rood. It means "Hill of the Angel"
