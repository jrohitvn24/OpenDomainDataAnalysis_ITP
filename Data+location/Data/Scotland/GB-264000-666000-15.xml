		<title>15BLACK AND WHITE WHISKY</title>
		<content>    The ancient Celts had a name for   
 the precious liquid they distilled -  
{"Uisge Beatha"}-the water of life.    
    On the outskirts of Glasgow in     
 Stepps is situated the{"Black and     
{White"}Scotch blending and bottling   
 plant which was opened in 1969.  It   
 consists of huge low buildings spread 
 beneath an office tower ten storeys   
 high which is a landmark for miles    
 around. Within these buildings the    
 many whiskies are blended and stored  
 ready for bottling.  The Black and    
 White company was founded by{James    
{Buchanan}and "Black and White" Scotch 
 Whisky was registered as a trade mark 
 in 1904.  Since the 1890's the Black  
 and White dogs, the Highland terriers,
 have been a feature of the company's  
 advertising.  Today Black and White   
 Scotch Whisky is sold in over 160     
 overseas markets.                     </content>
