		<content>{The Quod Sacra Parish of Finzean      
 covers a widespread area in the upper 
 Feugh valley in the district of       
 Deeside/Kincardine in the Grampian    
 Region of Scotland.The NE section is  
 intensively farmed with some forestry 
 and rough grazing.                    
 There is an old water-powered meal    
 mill,two houses over 200 years old,   
 plenty of animal and bird and a lively
 community with young couples building 
 their own homes tho' most must commute
 to work.A new sheltered housing scheme
 houses the elderly in contented       
 security.Here and there is a holiday  
 home or discreet caravan,signifying   
 that visitors return again and again  
 to enjoy the peace and serenity of    
 this lovely valley.Up the hill are    
 the  Church and the school, the old   
 school used as an Outdoor Centre.
