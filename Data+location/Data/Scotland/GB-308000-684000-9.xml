		<content> Religion in Pitreavie                 
 In out area we have St. Leonard's     
 Church in St. Leonard's Street.  It is
 one of only two churches in Britain   
 with a round steeple.  It looks very  
 old but it is only 82 years old.  It  
 was built for the houses in the       
 Brucefield area.                      
 St. Ninian's Church was built for the 
 new houses in the Abbeyview Estate.   
 It is Church of Scotland as well.     
 Our Lady of Lourdes Church is Roman   
 Catholic.  It is a new church between 
 Pitcorthie (Pitreavie) and Abbeyview  
 estates.                              
 Near St. Andrew's Street shopping area
 is the small Gospel Hall.  In the     
 north of Rosyth is a Methodist church.
  On the west side of the road, almost 
 opposite, is a Baptist church.        
 Services are held on Sundays but some 
 groups meet during the week.V Paterson</content>
