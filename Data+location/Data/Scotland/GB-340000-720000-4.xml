		<title>04Balmullo Primary School</title>
		<content> The Primary School was built in 1976  
 and it has quite an unusual design.   
 All the classrooms are built around   
 the circular hall.   So the basic     
 shape of the school is round, except  
 for the office area.                  
 There are six classrooms.   One is    
 used as a library/resources room and  
 one as a music/T.V. room.   The three 
 pairs of classrooms have "wet areas"  
 between them.   These areas have      
 sinks, art-storage drawers and vinyl  
 floors.   The toilets and coat        
 trolleys are in these areas too.      
 Outside we have a large playground and
 grassed area.   There is a football   
 pitch, a netball court and many       
 markings for games such as hopscotch. 
 At the moment, we have 110 pupils aged
 4 1/2 to 11 1/2.   When we leave P.7, 
 most of us will go to Bell Baxter High
 School in Cupar.                      </content>
