 The schoolhouse was built in in 1872  
 and has remained in use as such ever  
 since. Unfortunately there are no     
 records of admissions or log books to 
 be found in the school or Area        
 Education office. This is a great     
 shame as much information could have  
 been gleaned from such documents about
 the school and the island as a whole. 
 This position has been rectified      
 recently.                             
 There are currently 2 pupils from the 
 same family attending school.         
 Unfortunately in August there will    
 only be 1 as the older child leaves to
 go to secondary school. This will not 
 be the first time the school has had  
 only one pupil and there have been    
 periods when the school has been shut 
 because there were no pupils.
