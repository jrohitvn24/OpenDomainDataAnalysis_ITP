		<content> Our school is ST. PATRICK'S PRIMARY,in
 the sea/side town of TROON.There are  
 200 pupils in the school,8 teachers,1 
 headmaster and many back/up staff. The
 P.7 of 1985 consists of 28 pupils     
 working on THE DOMESDAY PROJECT which 
 we hope will give people in the future
 some idea what life was like when this
 information was written.Most of the   
 class are aged between 11/12 years.   
 Our teacher is Mrs.McALLISTER who is  
 married with a son aged 14. She also  
 has a dog, a SHETLAND COLLIE, named   
 LAD.The class join together for       
 lessons and social events. This year  
 we have enjoyed, swimming classes, a  
 disco at Christmas, an outing back in 
 history to an EDWARDIAN School and a  
 fantastic 5 day visit to an outdoor   
 pursuit centre at Glaisnock.More about
 our class in the final text.
