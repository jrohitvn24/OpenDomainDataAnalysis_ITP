		<content> In our area there is a marked contrast
 between old ,traditional styled farm  
 buildings and the new,mode            
 fabricated structures which now seem  
 to part of every farm.The old         
 buildings made from local whinstone   
 and sandstone,with slate or red pan   
 tiled roofs are attracted,but farmers 
 need the modern buildings to house    
 machinery and large numbers of        
 livestock.Hopefully farmers will be   
 prepared to preserve the old farm     
 steading buildings as they continue   
 to adapt and change there farms to    
 cope with new ideas about             
 cropping,machinery,and livestock      
 management.Most farm cottages are now 
 owned privately and they are all in a 
 good state of repair as they have all 
 been renovated in recent years.Local  
 authority grants have made it possible
 to keep these cottages in good order. </content>
