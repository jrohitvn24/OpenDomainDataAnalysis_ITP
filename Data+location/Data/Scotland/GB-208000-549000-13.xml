		<title>13POPULATION AT SANDHEAD</title>
		<content>   The population of our block is      
 concentrated in the village of        
 Sandhead - less than half of a square 
 kilometre containing almost all the   
 population! In the surrounding        
 countryside the remaining people are  
 to be found on the farms or caravan   
 sites where they work, or in farm     
 cottages no longer needed for farm    
 labourers, these people being either  
 retired or employed in Stranraer. The 
 village has a population of just over 
 200. In May 1984 a 5th Year pupil of  
 Stranraer Academy, Sylvia Bruton,     
 found the village population to be    
 219, and VERY HEAVILY WEIGHTED IN THE 
 OVER 60s AGE GROUP. The exodus of     
 young people from the district has    
 shown in the school role, which has   
 fallen from 170 in 1973 to 78 at the  
 present. Mechanisation of farm methods
 has cut the workforce 30% to 50%.     </content>
