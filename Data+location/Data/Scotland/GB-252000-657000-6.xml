		<title>06HOUSING-A BUSY COMMUNITY</title>
		<content>    In this area there can be found    
 grass ,flowers ,fields ,old and new   
 houses ,factories and even a reservior
  We talked to a farmer ,we talked to a
 librarian in a large housing scheme to
 find out all about the many bus       
 services .There are shops of all kinds
 and huge stores .We found lots of     
 primary schools but only one secondary
 school ,lots of flats where lots of   
 people live .There are plents of hot  
 food shops and there is usually a post
 office to be found where there is a   
 row of shops .There are detached and  
 semi-detached houses with green doors 
 and windows and red doors and windows 
  There is one small hospital and soon 
 there will be a new Health Centre .   
 Soon all the grassland will be built  
 on to supply houses for people who    
 want to live outside the city .
