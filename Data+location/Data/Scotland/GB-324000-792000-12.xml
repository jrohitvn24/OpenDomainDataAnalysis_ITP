		<title>12Balmoral Curling Club</title>
		<content> At the beginning of winter the curling
 pond is filled with water so that it  
 can freeze over (weather permitting). 
 The ice is marked out for the games . 
 The game is played by throwing granite
 stones, called curling stones,  along 
 the ice towards a target.             
    Often other teams come from        
 Tarland, Braemar etc.  Mrs Morrison   
 makes soup for the players and return 
 matches are arranged. The club has 24 
 members this year and it costs Â£1.50  
 to join.                              
    There are many trophies to be won. 
 Some of them date back to the reign of
 King Edward  7th. Rose bowl, small    
 King cup, large King cup, Tantalis    
 trophy, Caladonian medal, are joined  
 this year by two new trophies the     
 Invercauld trophy and the Hydrasun    
 trophy.                               
                                       </content>
