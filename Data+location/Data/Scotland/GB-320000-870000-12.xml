		<title>12CHANGES IN LOSSIEMOUTH.</title>
		<content> Between 1953 and 1985,Lossiemouth has 
 seen great changes.The decline in the 
 fishing industry has caused the loss  
 of many jobs.The closure of the       
 railway station some years ago has    
 caused most visitors to arrive by car 
 or by coach tour.                     
 A new High School and a new Primary   
 School have replaced an old Secondary 
 School with a Primary Department      
 attached to it.                       
 In 1985 people can watch television   
 and make use of the many facilities at
 the Community Centre. We now have the 
 advantages of refrigerators,freezers  
 and convenience foods.                
 In 1985, Ballroom Dancing has given   
 way to Disco Dancing to"Pop"records.  
 The shopping trade is gradually       
 declining due to the building of large
 supermarkets in nearby {ELGIN}.
