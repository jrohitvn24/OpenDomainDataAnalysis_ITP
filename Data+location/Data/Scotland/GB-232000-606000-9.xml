		<content> Crosshill used to have several shops  
 which sold groceries,newspapers,fruit 
 and vegetables,butcher meat,fish and  
 bread.Now vans visit the village,some 
 daily and others on alternate days,to 
 sell these goods to the locals.The    
 Post Office is also a food store.One  
 of the local farms has a butcher shop.
 Some families travel to Maybole or Ayr
 to do weekly shopping and to restock  
 the freezer.A Mobile Bank visits once 
 a week on a Monday morning.           
 Until four years ago there were four  
 shops in Kirkmichael.One was a butcher
 shop and the other three were general 
 food stores.There are now only two    
 food stores one of which includes a   
 Post Office.
