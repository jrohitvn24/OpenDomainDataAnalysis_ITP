		<title>05CROY UNEMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Unemployment is not an unknown thing  
 around Croy.Many people are unemployed
 and only a few lucky ones have jobs.  
 Some people whom I know are badly     
 wanting jobs.They went to places like 
 Glasgow for factory work,Nottingham   
 for computing and to Devon for        
 farming.One girl longing to get a job 
 had to move away from her family in   
 Croy over to a whole lot of strangers 
 in Paris.She's been there for about 1 
 year as a nanny.She has made lots of  
 friends she has said in letters to    
 her mother.A man who was brought up in
 Croy , had to move to Livingston near 
 Edinburgh at the age of 22.He tried to
 get a job but he did not get one.He   
 went back to Inverness where he       
 married a girl from Balmacara.He then 
 moved to Croy where he finally got a  
 job as a joiner.
