 There are only 5 species of native    
 trees and few individuals.This is     
 because trees were cut for firewood   
 when the island was well populated and
 the introduction of sheep and rabbits 
 have prevented regeneration.          
 Since 1881,40 different kinds of trees
 have been introduced, some of which   
 have become established. Dr Campbell  
 who has owned the island since 1938   
 has increased the amount of woodland  
 with the develoment of several small  
 plantations. This has benefited       
 birds and increased the number of     
 woodland species breeding on Canna.   
 Another conservation measure          
 instigated by Dr Campbell is a man    
 made pool on Sanday with reeds and a  
 small plantation of trees next to     
 it.This has benefited birds,          
 butterflies and moths.                </content>
