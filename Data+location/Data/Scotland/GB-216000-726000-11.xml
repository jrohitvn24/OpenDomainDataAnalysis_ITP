		<content>  Mr Arthur: Mr Arthur is a Senior     
 Agriculture Inspector, he is employed 
 by the Department of Agriculture and  
 Fisheries for Scotland. His office is 
 in Cameron House, Albany Street, Oban.
 His job involves assesing land cover  
 around the Oban area. To do this he   
 has to walk over all the land and     
 decide for himself the quality and use
 of the land. He does this to advise   
 local farmers about optimum use for   
 their land and to decide on grants    
 available to the farmers for things   
 like fencing. The information he      
 collects can be used by bigger        
 landusers as well such as, Forestry   
 Commision and Highlands and Islands   
 Development Board. Within a days work 
 he may well travel over one hundred   
 miles around the area.
