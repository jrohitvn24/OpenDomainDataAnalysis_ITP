		<title>04Netball</title>
		<content> We started playing netball at our     
 school at about Autumn.There are seven
 in our team and their names are       
 Margret,Heidi,Jennifer,Claire,Alison  
 and Diane.We have got a netball pitch 
 marked out.We have only had two games.
 Our first game was with Bridekirk.    
 They beat us easily by 9-3.But we     
 didn't expect to win in our first game
 anyway.They came to our school that   
 time.After our first game we knew the 
 main rules of the game.Our second game
 we played Eaglesfield.We played a bit 
 better with Eaglesfield but they still
 beat us quite easily,that time we went
 to their school the score was 11-4.   
 We haven't had any games with any     
 other schools recently.
