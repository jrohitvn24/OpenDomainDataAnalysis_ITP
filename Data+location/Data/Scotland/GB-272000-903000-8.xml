		<content>  Mrs Sutherland has been running the  
 local garage for six years. Her       
 husband ran it for forty years before 
 that.                                 
  The garage repairs cars. It does     
 welding, panel beating, respraying,   
 mechanical repairs and is an M.O.T.   
 Testing Station. They have many tools 
 in the garage, including all the      
 special eqipment required for M.O.T.  
 testing.                              
  Three people are employed here. They 
 sell petrol, diesel and Derv. Mrs     
 Sutherland hires and drives vehicles. 
 Daily she drives pupils to school in  
 her mini-bus.                         
  The most exciting day in the garage's
 history was last year, when it went on
 fire. Fortunately, no-one was hurt.
