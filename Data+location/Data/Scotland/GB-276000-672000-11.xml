		<content> MRS. HEANEY, WHO WORKS IN OUR SCHOOL, 
 HAS LIVED IN CUMBERNAULD A LONG TIME. 
 WE ASKED HER TO TELL US WHAT          
 CUMBERNAULD USED TO BE LIKE. SHE CAME 
 TO THE TOWN IN OCT. 1961. SHE WAS     
 PLEASED WITH HER NEW HOME IN KILDRUM  
 BECAUSE OF THE GOOD KITCHEN, BATHROOM 
 AND ALL THE PLANTS AROUND HER. TWENTY 
 FOUR YEARS AGO ALL THE HOUSES WERE IN 
 AFTON ROAD. WHEN A BUS CAME FROM      
 GLASGOW, IT CAME TO AFTON ROAD AND    
 TURNED RIGHT BACK TO GLASGOW. THE ONLY
 SHOP WAS A "SPAR" AND THAT WAS USED AS
 A POST OFFICE AS WELL. A VAN CAME     
 ROUND WITH GROCERIES. THERE WAS NO    
 BANK. SACRED HEART PRIMARY WAS THERE  
 BUT NOT THE CHURCH.THE Y.M.C.A. WAS   
 BESIDE THE SCHOOL BUT WAS UNUSED AT   
 THAT TIME. WE ASKED MRS. HEANEY IF SHE
 STILL LIKED CUMBERNAULD. SHE SAID THAT
 SHE LIKED THE LANDSCAPING BUT THE     
 LITTER MADE IT WORSE.                 </content>
