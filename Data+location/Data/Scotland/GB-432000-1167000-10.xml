		<content> SHETLAND KNITTING                     
 Knitting is not just a hobby in       
 Shetland it is also big business.In   
 our block there are two knitwear      
 shops,Shaela knitwear and Nordknit.The
 bulk of the knitting is done by local 
 women in their own homes.The          
 patterned work they do is known as    
 fair isle.The patterns used are very  
 traditional,large patterns are from   
 Norway and the smaller patterns are   
 from Shetland.Jumpers can have        
 patterns in a yoke around the neck or 
 all over.Scarves,hats and gloves are  
 also made.                            
 Machine made garments are less        
 expensive than hand made articles.    
 Some women work on industrial         
 machines,others on new punch card     
 machines.The women sell the jumpers to
 the shops,who in turn sell them to    
 tourists or to outletson the mainland.</content>
