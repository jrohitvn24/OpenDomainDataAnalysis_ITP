		<content> After consulting with members of the  
 public we, with their help have       
 reached some conclusions. Firstly     
 because of the new by-pass missing the
 Cowdenbeath area, much needed trade   
 for local shops is being diverted past
 Cowdenbeath. The exit road from the   
 by-pass is on Bridge Street which     
 means that there will be a heavy      
 influx of vehicles through the Main   
 Street of Cowdenbeath, which could    
 cause problems of safety for          
 pedestrians. The other problem for the
 local shop-keepers is the new         
 supermarket which is present under    
 construction. The shops at the bottom 
 end of the town are likely to lose    
 custom to a large supermarket. Another
 question raised was would the         
 supermarket be profitable. People     
 thought that this was a bad idea.
