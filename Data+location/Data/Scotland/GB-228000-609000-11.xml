		<title>11GOVERNMENT 2-FIRE SERVICE</title>
		<content> The fire service in Maybole is        
 voluntary and part time. On average it
 is called out three or four times a   
 week. Members carry a "pager" radio   
 device which bleeps when they are on  
 call. Most businesses are fitted with 
 automatic alarms to alert the fire    
 brigade. They also receive calls from 
 the general public to attend domestic 
 fires and road accidents.Their        
 equipment has changed a lot over the  
 past ten years with the introduction  
 of new appliances and chemicals. These
 include hoses, a portable resuscitator
 a "porta_power" generator, and oxygen 
 cannisters lasting 45mins each.       
 Maybole's single station and sole     
 engine covers Maybole, Crosshill,     
 Kirkmichael, Straiton, Kirkoswald,    
 Turnberry, and is support unit for    
 Girvan. The busiest times are the     
                                       </content>
