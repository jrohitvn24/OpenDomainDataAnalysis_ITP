 churches in Scotland.It used to be a  
 small chapel,which was established by 
 St Moluag of Lismore,Ireland around   
 566 A.D.The only relic remaining from 
 that time is the Elephant Stone.The   
 stone was uncovered whilst digging a  
 grave in 1925.In the year 1010 the    
 Battle of Mortlach took place in the  
 grave_yard.King Malcolm II of Scotland
 extended the church by 3 spear lengths
 after being victorious against the    
 Danes.There is also a Pictish stone   
 called the Battle Stone which is a    
 relic of that battle.The minister at  
 the present time is Rev.H.Smith.
