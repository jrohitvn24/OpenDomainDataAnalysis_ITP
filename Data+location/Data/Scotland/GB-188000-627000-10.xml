{a hundred acres of young trees}were   
 burned to the ground.Farmer Jack      
 Murchie was burning heather up        
 the hill behind Kilpatrick .Fire      
 engines from Blackwaterfoot,Lamlash,  
 Corriecravie and Brodick arrived at   
 the scene.With around fifty beaters   
 there.Two fire engines from the       
 mainland were called over to the      
 fire.A helicopter was reported to have
 been standing by.The cost of          
 replacement was estimated to be around
 forty thousand pounds.This was the    
 first time ever that a fire brigade   
 has been brought across from the      
 mainland.At six o'clock that evening  
 the fire hit a wet area.Firemen stayed
 there until nine o'clock to make sure 
 that the fire was completely out.     
 Firemen were very pleased when the    
 fire went out.                        </content>
