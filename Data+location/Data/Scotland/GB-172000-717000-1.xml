		<content> Southern Seil Island, northern Easdale
 island and Isle of Insh, Argyll.      
                                       
 This area comprises the southern end  
 of the island of Seil, the northern   
 end of Easdale island which is reached
 by ferry from Ellenabeich on Seil and 
 the island on Insh (sheep island)     
 offshore.  Seil, Easdale and its      
 neighbouring islands had a flourishing
 slate industry in the 19th Century    
 supplying slate far afield.  The great
 storm of 1881 devasted the area,      
 flooding the quarries (one is 300 ft  
 deep) and machinery deep below sea    
 level.  Pumping was unsuccessful, a   
 way of life ended and today the       
 villages of Easdale and Ellenabeich   
 support fishing and craft shops with  
 many villagers travelling to Oban (16 
 miles north) to work.
