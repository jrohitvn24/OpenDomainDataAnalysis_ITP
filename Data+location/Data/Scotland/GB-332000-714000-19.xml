		<content> Because far fewer people work on farms
 in our area many farm cottages are now
 occupied by people who are either     
 retired or who travel to work in      
 nearby towns.At Mount Farm three out  
 of four farm cottages are owned       
 privately.Mr.Eglen retired to one of  
 these cottages with his wife.He worked
 in Somerset for many years but his    
 wife was native to this area and they 
 decided to retire here.Mr.Eglen is    
 impressed with our local scenery which
 he thinks strongly resembles the area 
 of the Dorset Downs he knew many years
 ago.Being central to other parts of   
 Scotland is another advantage.Mr.Eglen
 especially likes the local climate    
 with its invigorating air,ideal for   
 his chest complaint.They are pleased  
 to be living in this part of the      
 countryside and are looking forward to
 a long and happy retirement.          </content>
