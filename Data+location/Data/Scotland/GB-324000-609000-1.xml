		<title>01Upper Tima, Ettrick Valley</title>
		<content> The Tima, a major tributary of the    
 river Ettirick runs from South to     
 North, fed by the Nether Dalgliesh and
 Glenkerry burns, through a wide flat  
 gravelled valley.  The hills on either
 side rise to a height of 500mts and   
 are almost entirely covered with      
 plantations of Sitka Spruce and Larch,
 with the exception of the highest tops
 which are ungrazed and unplanted.  By 
 the road side some deciduous trees    
 have been planted for their amenity   
 value.  The river bed is covered in   
 summer with a variety of wild flowers,
 and is the habitat of nesting migrant 
 birds such as Curlew, Oyster Catcher, 
 Lapwing, Plover, and Snipe.  All year 
 round there are heron and goosanders  
 and other native wildlife include Fox,
 Mink, Stoat, Weasel, Frogs, Toads and 
 frequent small herds of deer.
