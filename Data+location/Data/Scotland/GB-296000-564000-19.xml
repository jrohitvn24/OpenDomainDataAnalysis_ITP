		<title>19NEW ABBEY - SEA</title>
		<content>   In the east is the estuary of the   
 River Nith with its mud flats and     
 dangerous quick-sands.The course of   
 the river has changed over the years. 
 The New Abbey Pow burn was navigable  
 for about a mile inland to Bogue Quay 
 until l937. Goods for the mills were  
 landed or despatched here.            
   Many kinds of wild-fowl winter on   
 the shore.They are protected at       
 Caerlaverock Bird Reserve but, sadly, 
 they can be shot if they fly the short
 distance over the firth.              
   Haaf-net fishing is done in Spring  
 and Summer. The fishers stand in the  
 water at ebb- or flood-tide, holding a
 wooden frame across their shoulders.  
 From this frame hang nets into which  
 the salmon will swim. The average size
 of fish caught is 7lb.There are also  
 flounders,plaice,sea-trout and rock-  
 herring.                              </content>
