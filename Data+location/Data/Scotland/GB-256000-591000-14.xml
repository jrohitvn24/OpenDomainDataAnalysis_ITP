		<title>14LOCAL INDUSTRY,CARSPHAIRN</title>
		<content>{FARMING}One of the main industries in 
 the area is hill sheep farming.The    
 main reason for keeping the sheep is  
 for breeding lambs which are sold for 
 meat, but also  a small income is to  
 be gained from the sale of wool.Some  
 farmers have beef cattle. The native  
 breed is the Galloway.A few crops are 
 grown to feed the animals in winter_  
 rape, and grass for silage and        
 hay.Machines are now used to do many  
 of the jobs which provided employment 
 on the farm in the past.              
{FORESTRY}Some of the hill land        
 previously used for sheep has been    
 planted with conifers.The trees are   
 now reaching maturity and are being   
 felled and transported to             
 Dalmellington, where they are made    
 into pit props, to Irvine to be made  
 into chipboard, or to Sweden's pulp   
 mills to be made into paper.          </content>
