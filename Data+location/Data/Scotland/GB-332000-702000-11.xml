		<title>11Kennoway Carnival</title>
		<content>  This year, 1985, the{Kennoway Civic  
{Week and Carnival}was held for the    
 first time since 1957.                
  The main event of the Carnival was   
 the installation of the village{Lad   
{and Lass}and their attendants. These  
 children were elected from the three  
 Primary 7 classes in the village      
 school. The Lad(Thomas Bremner) and   
 the Lass(Leeanne Wishart) led the     
 carnival procession on a float        
 decorated with paper flowers.         
  The Carnival Committee organised     
 a treasure hunt, a pram race,         
 five-a-side football, a "fun run" and 
 a disco during the civic week.        
  In the school a Carnival Dance and   
 the investiture of the Ladd and Lass  
 took place.                           
  It is hoped that the Carnival will   
 continue to be held annually.
