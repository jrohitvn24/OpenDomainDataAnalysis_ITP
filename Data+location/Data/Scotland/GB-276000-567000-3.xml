		<content> Farmers use different machines in     
 different seasons.                    
 In SPRING we need tractors for        
 shifting food about to different      
 fields, a muck spreader for           
 fertilizing fields and a tractor to   
 pull it, a plough to plough the fields
 ready for scattering seeds, and for   
 that you would need a drill.          
 In SUMMER you need a forager to cut   
 the silage. Then you would need a     
 bailer if you wanted to bail your     
 silage. You would need a combine      
 harvester to cut the hay or barley,   
 then use the forager to pick up the   
 barley or hay and a bailer to make it 
 into bails, a crimper to pick up the  
 grain.                                
 In AUTUMN you sow grass so you would  
 need a rotator, a tractor and a drill.
 In WINTER you would need a tractor to 
 take the food to the cattle.          </content>
