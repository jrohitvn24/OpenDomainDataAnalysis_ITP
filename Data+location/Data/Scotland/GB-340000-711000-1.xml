		<content>  The land in our area is mostly arable
 fields.                               
{ Baldinnie}consists of a few privately
 owned cottages and farm buildings.  It
 lies  one and a half miles from  Ceres
 and  as  it  is  142 metres  above sea
 level there are very good views of the
 surrounding countryside.              
{ Ceres}is situated in a  small  hollow
 seven miles from St. Andrews, the home
 of golf.  It has not changed much over
 the  years  and  has  many  historical
 features.                             
{ Coaltown  of  Callange} now exists as
 only a couple of cottages  compared to
 the number  of  miners ' houses  there
 were when  the  mine  was  open.   Two
 hundred  years  ago  an aviator called
 Lunardi landed near this place.       
{ Pitscottie} is  largely  residential,
 with  a  population  of  approximately
 sixty people.                         </content>
