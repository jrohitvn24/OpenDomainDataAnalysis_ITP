		<title>19CRAIGHOUSE</title>
		<content>  Craighouse has, according to records,
 been in existance since the reign of  
 King David II. There is some evidence 
 that the house and grounds were owned 
 by the Abbey of Newbattle as far back 
 as 1528.                              
  Craighouse changed hands many times  
 during the 17th and 18th centuries,   
 one of the owners being Sir William   
 Dick of Braid, one of the wealthiest  
 men in Edinburgh at that time.        
  In 1746, the first of many extensions
 was built. Craighouse and its         
 surrounding land were sold to the     
 commissioners of the Edinburgh Lunatic
 Asylum in 1878, after which a series  
 of new buildings were added,and it    
 still functions as a hospital today.  
  There is an underground passage      
 leading from the basement which some  
 people believe eventually emerges at  
 Edinburgh Castle.                     </content>
