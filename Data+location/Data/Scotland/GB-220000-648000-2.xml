 the Seamill Store or the Post Office.

 sorts of things can be bought from    
 toilet rolls to sweets. It is open    
 every day. D.A Kerr runs the shop. One
 can also buy stamps and can post      
 letters. There is a house above the   
 store and a house is being built to   
 the right of it.{According to local   
{residents Seamill is a pleasant, well-
{located place in which to live.
