		<title>19The Bellfield Policies</title>
		<content> Bellfield House and gardens belonged  
 to the three Buchanan sisters.        
 Sixty-one years ago on the death of   
 the last sister, it was left to the   
 people of Kilmarnock and Riccarton.   
 Many people benefitted from the       
 Buchanan Bequest and the Mansion House
 was used as a library and tearoom and 
 was often used for wedding receptions.
  In 1970 the house was knocked down.  
 Nearby three trees were planted and a 
 plaque was plated in remembrance of   
 the three sisters.   Today Bellfield  
 Estate is a public park with areas for
 tennis, football and bowling.
