		<title>15FINZEAN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.</title>
		<content> The Finzean estate had built most of  
 its houses during the{19th century}and
 very little new building took placxe  
 until recently, principally because   
 the laird was forbidden to sell any   
 land from the entailed estate until   
 1935, when Joseph Farquharson died.   
 The land had then to be disentailed to
 pay death duties.                     
{Some ten new houses}have been built   
 recently, mostly by young Feughside   
 newly-weds who, hopefully ,will bring 
 up their families in the valley.{Some 
{estate houses have also been sold,    
 either to the sitting tenants or to   
 outside people. It is the policy of   
 the Farquharsons to cut down on the   
 burden of keeping up surplus buildings
 at a time of high inflation, since    
{rental income does not adequately meet
{the necessary expenditure.            
                                       </content>
