		<content> The Oakwood Motel, Elgin              
 The Oakwood - a log-cabin style       
 restaurant/motel - lies on the north  
 side of the A96 two miles west of     
 Elgin.  It was built in 1932.  The 14 
 cabins added in 1939 made the Oakwood 
 the first motel in Scotland, perhaps  
 in Britain.  The original cabins no   
 longer met modern requirements and    
 have recently been demolished.  Twelve
 new ones with modern facilities will  
 be built in 1986.  The restaurant has 
 been modernised by the new owners,    
 Messrs J &amp; V Miele and can seat 60.   
 The function suite can accomodate 120 
 and has a beautifully sprung dance    
 floor.  Five chefs and 10 to 15       
 waitresses are employed.  Most have   
 been trained at Moray College of      
 Further Education.  The 100m deep     
 Artesian well provides a never-failing
 water supply.                         </content>
