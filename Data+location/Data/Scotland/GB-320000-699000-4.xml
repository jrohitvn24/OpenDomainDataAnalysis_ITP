		<content> LITTLE HAS CHANGED IN THE FARMING     
 LANDSCAPE RECENTLY.A FEW OF THE THINGS
 THAT HAVE CHANGED ARE AS FOLLOWS:- THE
 MAIN CHANGES ARE OIL SEED RAPE IS NOW 
 BEING GROWN. SINCE THERE ARE NOW MORE 
 VARIETIES THERE IS A TYPE WHICH CAN BE
 GROWN IN THE SOIL TYPE AND LATITUDE OF
 THIS AREA.                            
    MUCH MORE WINTER BARLEY IS BEING   
 GROWN.THE BIG FARMS GROW IT TO SPREAD 
 OUT HARVESTING TIMES SO THAT THEY DO  
 NOT HAVE TOO MUCH WORK AT ONE TIME.   
 ALTHOUGH THIS CROP IS BEING GROWN MORE
 AND MORE IN THIS AREA, IT CAN ONLY BE 
 USED FOR FEEDING. ALSO, THERE IS A    
 BIGGER TONNAGE, THUS A BIGGER FARMING 
 INCOME.MORE LAND IS BEING DEVELOPED BY
 THE COUNCIL FOR HOUSING.              
    FINALLY, MORE LAND HAS BEEN        
 PLOUGHED FOR ARABLE INSTEAD OF FOR    
 CATTLE (DAIRY OR BREEDING).           
                                       </content>
