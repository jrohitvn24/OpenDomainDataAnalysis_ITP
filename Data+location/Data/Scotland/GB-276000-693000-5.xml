		<title>05Traffic  Parking  Stirling</title>
		<content> Stirling has a great many shops and   
 there are many traffic problems. These
 problems mainly occur on Saturdays and
 holidays in other towns. To cope with 
 these problems there are 10 car parks 
 in the centre of the town. There are  
 many parking meters in the streets    
 nearby but every year more and more   
 parking meters spread to streets that 
 didn't have them before. In the very  
 centre of the town it costs 15p for   
 half an hour. Further from the centre 
 it may cost 15p for two hours or even 
 the whole day!                        
   The traffic wardens patrolling the  
 streets help with the problems such as
 roadworks, parades, people parking    
 where they should not and traffic     
 jams. If you go into town on a        
 Saturday it is unlikely you will find 
 a space in the very centre unless you 
 go early in the morning.              </content>
