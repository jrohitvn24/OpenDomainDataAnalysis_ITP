		<title>16SOCIAL CONCERNS IN BALFRON</title>
		<content>    A social{survey,}involving 250     
 households in the Balfron area,       
 indicated that 99% of the adults were 
 happy to be living in the district.   
    Their{reasons were varied,}but the 
 most common were: the peace and quiet,
 the pure clean air, the friendliness  
 of the people, the attractive houses  
 and the good schools.                 
    When questioned about how the      
 village had changed, responses varied 
 according to the length of time spent 
 in the area. However, the general     
 concensus was, that on the whole,     
{changes}had been for the better- more 
{houses}(both council and private); new
 primary school, clinic, fire station  
 and telephone exchange.               
    Changes which did not meet with    
 general approval were the reduced bus-
 service and the introduction of double
 decker buses.                         </content>
