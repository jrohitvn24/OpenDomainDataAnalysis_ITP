		<title>15CROSSGATES_LAST 20 YEARS_1</title>
		<content>  During the last 20 years,there have  
 been a number of changes in and around
 Crossgates and Hallbeath.The main     
 changes have been made in{industry}and
{communications.}Previous to 1964,Fife 
 was a region much cut off from the    
 rest of Scotland,due to the River     
 Forth.Traffic could only cross the    
 river by the bridge at{Kincardine}much
 further up stream.This meant that     
 traffic by passed the main area of the
 region,making industry very sparce due
 to the cost of transportation of      
 materials and goods;But,in 1964 the{  
{FORTH ROAD BRIDGE}was opened,providing
 excellent road links,and a flood of   
 new industries taking advantage of the
 now prospering communication links.   
 Although the motor way leading up to  
 the bridge didn't go as far north as  
 Crossgates,in 1967 it was extended    
 ,just by_passing Crossgates.          </content>
