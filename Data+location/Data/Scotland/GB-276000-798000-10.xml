		<content> Work to improve the Reserve is        
 constantand is carried out by{one full
{time warden}and numerous summer       
 helpers.  Ditches are restored,, trees
 are planted and{free grazing}is given 
 to local farmers in an effort to      
 ccombat sedge and rushes and allow    
 other natural vegetation to grow      
 through.                              
                                       
 The Reserve is appreciated by local   
 people and visitor alike and there is 
 a{general interest in wildlife.} Bird 
 watching can be enjoyed during one's  
 ddaily life rather than on special    
 forays to such reserves.  Experienced 
 bird watchers and casual tourists come
 from all countries of Europe and      
 beyond.  Its proximity to the A9 and  
 its situation in an area of such      
{unspoilt countryside}adds to its      
 attraction.                           </content>
