		<content> Inadequacies of public transport also 
 commands an important role in peoples 
 concern and opinions.                 
  In Rosewell, poor housing and high   
 unemployment dominate. This old and   
 decaying "Company town", built by the 
 private coal company before           
 Nationalisation in 1947 is in bad need
 of renovation and rebuilding. The     
 N.C.B (National Coal Board) has done  
 little, except board up houses as they
 fall vacant. Ownership of the land    
 reverts to the leaseholder, Lothian   
 Estates in a few years time, so       
 nothing much is being done meanwhile. 
  Now that the local coal mine and     
 brickworks have ceased to operate,    
 employment opportunites are scarce.   
 Most of the working population travel 
 elsewhere for work-such as Bilston    
 Glen Colliery, or service industry    
 jobs in Edinburgh,or closer at hand.  </content>
