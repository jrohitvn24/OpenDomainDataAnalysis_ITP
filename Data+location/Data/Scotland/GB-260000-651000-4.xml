		<content>      On a Saturday morning I usually  
 get up between 9.00am and 9.30.When I 
 get up,I watch T.V.,have my breakfast 
 and get dressed.At about 12.15pm I    
 leave to go to dancing which starts at
 12.30pm.I do tap,modern and majorettes
 which is on until 1.45pm.After dancing
 I go straight home and have my lunch  
 which is usually a sandwich and a cup 
 of tea.Then I change into my new or   
 good clothes to go over to my gran's. 
                                       
      At about 3.00pm I get a bus over 
 to Glasgow where she lives.My mum and 
 I arrive between 4.15pm and 4.30pm.   
 When we get there,we have a cup of tea
 and I watch T.V.At between 5.30pm and 
 6.00pm we have dinner and afterwards I
 watch T.V. or read,and between about  
 10.00pm and 10.30pm,I go to bed.
