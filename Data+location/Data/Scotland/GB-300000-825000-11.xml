		<title>11Winter Sports (Curling)</title>
		<content>    In winter, local people enjoy      
{curling}at the{Aviemore Ice Rink.     
 Curling is a sport similar to Bowls   
 played on ice and for all ages.       
    If it is a very cold winter and    
 temperatures stay below freezing for a
 long spell, curling can be played     
 outside. Such an occasion is called a 
{BONSPIEL.                             
    On the{Grantown curling pond,}there
 can be several rinks, and on each     
 there would be two teams of four      
 players playing.                      
    There is a cup to be won and many  
 people go to watch. Everybody loves a 
 Bonspiel.
