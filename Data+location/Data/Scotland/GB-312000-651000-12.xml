		<content> In our village we are very fortunate  
 as the standard of health is very     
 high. This is no doubt due to the fact
 that there are no poor people and we  
 all get enough food. We also have very
 good medical and hospital care.       
   The National Health Service provides
 us with free treatment for any        
 illnesses and hospitalisation.        
   The most common illnesses for adults
 are coughs,colds and flu. For children
 it is colds,ear and throat infections.
   Our doctor, who visited our class   
 recently told us that most adults die 
 from heart trouble and cancer. Few    
 children die but those who have died  
 recently have been involved in road   
 accidents.                            
   We do not have problems like glue   
 sniffing and drug addiction.          
   Most parents have their babies      
 innoculated and vaccinated.           </content>
