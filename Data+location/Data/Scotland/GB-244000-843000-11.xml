		<title>11WORKING FATHERS-TEANASSIE</title>
		<content> Many fathers work locally-35%         
 do.They work in forestry,or for the   
 North of Scotland Hydro-electric Board
 or in local industry.But the main     
 percentage work in Inverness. One     
 boy's father works 111 miles away     
 in Wick.It is obvious from the graph  
 on page 8 that oil-related jobs have  
 made a difference to employment in    
 this area.Nigg,Ardersier and Wick are 
 the areas involved in the oil indus-  
 try.Many fathers work far away        
 because that is where the employment  
 is. They drive to work and and some   
 are away from home during the         
 week and come home at weekends.All    
 families have at least one car as     
 public transport is limited in this   
 area
