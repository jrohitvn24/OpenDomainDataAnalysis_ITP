		<content> The area has long been settled and has
 many associations with the past.      
{St. Fillan,}a Celtic monk is said to  
 have performed miracles. Holy         
 wells,like that of St.Peter, north of 
 Houston,were once visited by the sick.
 Nearby stood the{Barochan}Cross,now in
 Paisley Abbey. It is a 10th century   
 sculpture with inscriptions of a      
 phoenix,pelican and lamb.             
{Craigends House}was the home of the   
{Cunninghame}family who feuded with    
 other powerful landowners. In 1553 the
 Laird of Craigends was murdered by    
 friends of the Semples of             
 Lochwinnoch. The assailants were      
 executed.Manor houses still in use are
 Barochan House and{Houston House,the  
 latter an imposing building standing  
 in a large wooded estate. Its tall    
 turrets remind people of the areas    
 links with medieval times.            </content>
