		<title>19INVERURIE-PORT CROSSING</title>
		<content> Due to the heavy flow of traffic      
 through Inverurie there has been a lot
 of concern about the dangers of       
 crossing the road in the Port. (Port  
 Elphinstone is referred to locally as 
 the Port)                             
                                       
 A traffic census carried out by pupils
 in Port Elphinstone School showed that
 on average 350 vehicles passed in an  
 hour. At peak times this is greatly   
 increased. It is very difficult to    
 cross the road and there are a lot of 
 elderly people in the community as    
 well as young children.               
                                       
 A petition was circulated asking      
 people to support the construction of 
 a Pelican Crossing. This was then sent
 to Malcolm Bruce, the M.P. A reply had
 been received from Mr. Bruce but no   
 plans for the crossing have been made.</content>
