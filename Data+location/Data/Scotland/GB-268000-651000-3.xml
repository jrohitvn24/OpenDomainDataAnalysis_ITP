		<content>   There is little industry in the     
 block due to its largely rural        
 character, although it once had       
 several large mines.                  
   The main source of industrial jobs  
 is the Cadzow Industrial Estate.      
 This was the site of a large          
 light-engineering plant (Maclean's    
 Windows) which employed roughly 1500  
 people. Now it has several small,     
 Hi-tech Firms instead. The area was   
 once the site of Cadzow Colliery.  The
 number of people employed was around  
 250.                                  
   Other industrial concerns include 2 
 Garden Centres, a large Bus Company,  
 and a Plant Hire Firm. These employ   
 very few in comparison to older times.
