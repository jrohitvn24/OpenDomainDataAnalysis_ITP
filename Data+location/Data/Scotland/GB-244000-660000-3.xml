		<content> Some of the school pupils were asked  
 how they spend their weekends and     
 these are some of the replies.        
 "I normally go runs on my bike which  
 is a 5 speed racer. Sometimes, early  
 on Saturday mornings, I go fishing. On
 Saturday afternoons I often go to the 
 Flamingo which is an amusement arcade 
 down town. If it's wet I stay in and  
 play computer games or watch a video. 
 Last Sunday I saw 'Night of the       
 Demons' which is about a group of     
 campers attacked by a hairy monster." 
 "My mum and me often go shopping. Last
 weekend she bought me new trainers, an
 Adidas cagoul and bleached jeans. On  
 Saturday night I do my homework and   
 punishment exercises for school."     
 " On Saturdays me and my boyfriend go 
 down town to look at records. Our     
 favourite singers are U2 and Paul     
 Young. At night we go to the cinema." </content>
