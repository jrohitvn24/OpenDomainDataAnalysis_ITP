		<content> It is a sparsely populated area,      
 containing 3 small villages, each with
 a disused grain mill and linked by    
 streams.                              
 The landscape is                      
 undulating,agricultural land with     
 small farms and patches of coniferous 
 woodland. Farming is traditional, with
 a mixture of cereals and animals.     
 Wildlife is rich and varied (e.g. roe 
 deer, hores, bats). The nearest       
 Doctor, secondary school and shops are
 in Insch or Inverurie (each 7 miles   
 from Wartle).  A mobile library, fish 
 and grocery vans come to the villaes  
 and a school bus collects the children
 daily. The railway line is now        
 derelict.                             
 The church of Rayne and the Bank Inn  
 are the only places for residents to  
 meet. They are mostly farmers
