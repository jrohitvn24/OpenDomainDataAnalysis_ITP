		<title>19SPORTS AND HOBBIES.</title>
		<content> Most of the summer sports in this     
 block are related to natural out door 
 activies i.e. angling, hill-walking,  
 sailing,cycling.                      
  There are very few team sports played
 as there are no facilities in the     
 area and even the children do not play
 at football or cricket etc. as there  
 is very little flat land around. There
 is one private tennis court and the   
 new owners have encouraged local      
 people to use it this year and this   
 has proved popular.                   
  Every house has a garden and         
 gardening is a popular past-time in   
 spite of the notorious "Midgies".     
  The community hall is the main venue 
 for sport in the winter. Badminton and
 indoor bowls are both played there and
 there is a local darts club in the    
 local pub. Friendly matches are also  
 played away from home.                </content>
