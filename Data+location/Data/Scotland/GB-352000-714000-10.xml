		<title>10THE BELL ROCK LIGHTHOUSE</title>
		<content> A dangerous red sandstone reef, about 
 two miles long, lies some twelve miles
 from the mouth of the River Tay and   
 Forth. A small part of the reef is    
 uncovered at each tide and is         
 completely submerged by 16 feet of    
 water at high tide.A Government Bill  
 to erect a lighthouse on the site was 
 passed in  1806 and John Rennie, an   
 Engineer, was invited to be Chief     
 Engineer with Robert Stevenson as his 
 assistant. Rennie's design of a stone 
 lighthouse was adopted. Due to the    
 shortage of time available for working
 in the rock, the stones were shaped   
 and dovetailed at Arbroath. Rennie    
 acted more as a consultant and he     
 appointed Stevenson as works engineer.
 He spent much of his time at the rock 
 and was a vigorous leader. The light  
 was first switched on in 1811 on      
 1st February.                         </content>
