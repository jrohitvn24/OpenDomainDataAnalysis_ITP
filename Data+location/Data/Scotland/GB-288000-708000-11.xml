		<content> Most of the farmland around Blackford 
 is on the Blackford Estate and is     
 owned by private investors from the   
 Arab Emirate States and the farmland  
 is managed and worked by Blackford    
 Farms Ltd. on their behalf. A small   
 number of farms belong to owner       
 occupiers and were purchased from     
 previous estate owners in the past.   
 A large area of the land is regularly 
 ploughed and produces barley,         
 potatoes, swedes and various green    
 crops for cattle food. Hay and silage 
 crops are also produced from the      
 intensive grassland.                  
 The livestock are mainly beef rearing 
 cattle, usually suckling herds and    
 flocks of sheep and the land farmed by
 a small highly mechanised mobile      
 workforce who in most cases do not    
 live at their place of work.
