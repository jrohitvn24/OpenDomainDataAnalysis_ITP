		<content> Lovers from the South of the Border   
 quickly took advantage of the {       
{Scottish }Law and it resulted in a    
 thriving marriage trade being set up  
 at {Gretna Green.}                    
          The old village {Gretna Green
  is now linked with the new{Gretna }  
 township on the west side of the main{
{Glasgow}and {Gretna A74 }road. It was 
 built in 1916 to accommodate thousands
 of workers engaged in the vast {Gretna
  Munitions factory.The present        
 population is approximately 3000.{    
{Gretna's }population is growing       
 because of the new houses and         
 buildings which have been erected.{As 
{long as the world loves a lover,      
{Gretna will find a place in the heart 
{of the people the world over.
