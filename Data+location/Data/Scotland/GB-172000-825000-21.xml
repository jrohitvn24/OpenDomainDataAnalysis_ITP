<title>21Trade in Kyleakin</title>
<content>

Kyleakin has no shops as such, since Cameron's closed, though there is a small Store (mainly for Residents of the Hostel there) at Saucy Mary's Hostel.  There is a Tourist Information Point at the Bright Water Centre.  Since the Youth Hostel closed and was converted into affordable housing, there are now no facilities for visiting Yachts, ie: showers, launderette etc. The nearest Filling Stations are either in Kyle or Broadford.  There is no longer a Garage in the Village.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are two Hotels - Mackinnon Country House Hotel &amp; The Kings Arms, a Coffee Shop and two Restaurants (one currently closed).  There are a large number of Guest Houses and B&amp;B's and three Backpacker Hostels.  There are three Public Houses - the Haakon (closed), Saucy Mary's and The Kings Arms.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
