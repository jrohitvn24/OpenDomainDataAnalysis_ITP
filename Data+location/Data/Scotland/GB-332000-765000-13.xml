		<title>13WILDLIFE : BIRDS</title>
		<content> Glenprosen has all the common birds   
 as found in Britain.72 have in fact   
 been authentically seen. We have our  
 favourites however. The{Cuckoo }is a  
 summer visitor who comes at the start 
 of May. We see and hear him from the  
 playground.{House Martins}nest under  
 the eves around the school. Their     
 numbers have been decreasing in recent
 years and this year we have only 3    
 nests. About 15 years ago there were  
 57 nests counted. {Short Eared Owls } 
 had a fairly dramatic increase a few  
 years ago owing to  planting of trees 
 which increased Vole population on    
 which the owls feed. {Sand Martins    
 no longer breed at Buckhood but still 
 do at Dykhead, 5 miles down the glen. 
{Green Woodpecker and Great Spotted    
{Woodpecker }breed but both species    
 took a set back in the severe winter  
 of 1982-83.                           </content>
