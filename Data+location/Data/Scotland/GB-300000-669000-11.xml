		<content> Bob Taylor is a quiet phlegmatic Scot 
 but on the{9th November 1979}he was   
 incredibly affected by the sight of a 
{spaceship}in a clearing at{Deer Hill. 
 It was a dark,grey dome with a flanged
 rim. Two spiked spheres appeared and  
 seized Mr.Taylor. The only sound was a
 sucking,plopping noise but a strong   
 acrid smell filled the air and        
 rendered him unconscious. He awoke to 
 hear his dog barking and he recollects
 hearing a whirring noise.The{spaceship
 had disappeared. He could neither walk
 nor talk. The incident was reported to
 his boss and his doctor who were shown
 where it had occurred. Tracks were    
 left on the spot but none in or out of
 the clearing. This is a classic case  
 of a{"Close Encounter of the Second   
{Kind".
