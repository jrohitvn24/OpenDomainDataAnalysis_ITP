		<content> Between 1878 and 1881, three gun      
 batteries were built on the           
 north-west, north-east and south      
 headlands, but only two are visible   
 today. They are constructed of rubble 
 and are partly subterranean. To       
 support the Inchkeith batteries a     
 similar one was constructed on        
 Kinghorn Ness.The Inchkeith batteries 
 are listed building, but may soon be  
 demolished. During the early 1900's   
 the island was heavily armed and      
 formed the principal part of the Forth
 defences in both World Wars. The      
 military equipment has all been       
 removed and the batteries, canteen and
 barracks stand derelict. Part of the  
 "military" road is still visible      
 because it is used by the lighthouse  
 keepers to reach the foghorn on the   
 north-east headland. Only the area not
 overgrown is that at the lighthouse.  </content>
