		<title>19PAYROLL ROBBERY AND MURDER</title>
		<content> On Thursday 17th January 1985 just    
 after 9 a.m. an army landrover left   
 Glencorse Barracks with three army    
 personnel on board, a driver and two  
 others .  They were Major David       
 Cunningham (retired), staff sergeant  
 Terrance Hosker and Private John      
 Thomson (driver).  They went to the   
 Royal Bank of Scotland at 42 John     
 Street, Penicuik.  They collected the 
 money from the bank by using the rear 
 entrance which opened onto the car    
 park in Jackson Street. Shortly       
 after this the Police Station at      
 Penicuik were informed that the Land  
 Rover had failed to return to the     
 barracks with the money. A search of  
 Penicuik and the surrounding area was 
 started.  At about 11 a.m. the empty  
 Land Rover was found lying in a ditch 
 approximately half a mile from the    
 Flotterstone Inn                      </content>
