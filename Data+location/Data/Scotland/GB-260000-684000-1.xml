		<title>01General Review south: FINTRY</title>
		<content> The area which people who live here   
 think of as Fintry, covers 4 squares  
 of this Domesday Survey. See also:    
                                       
{   02640684, 02600687, 02560687}      
                                       
 Settlement is concentrated around the 
 Fintry Cross, where the Kippen road   
 passes over Endrick Water. This is the
 new town area of the mill-working     
 days. The Cross is also the site of   
 our second village school, presently  
 the Leisure Centre. The first school  
 is now a private house on the corner  
 at the Denny Cross. This is the site  
 of old Fintry and while several       
 dwellings persist, others, remembered 
 and lived in by older folk have sadly 
 disappeared.                          
                                       
 Predominantly a farming area, though  
 most people work in neighouring towns.</content>
