		<title>14DUNDONALD AREA _ HOUSING</title>
		<content>  Around the village of Dundonald there
 are many farms and also a few         
 small_holdings.                       
  These small_holdings were built after
 the First World War to provide work   
 for soldiers returning home from the  
 war. Each house stands in an acre of  
 land and has a large barn at the side.
 Some of the small_holdings have been  
 converted into very pleasant modern   
 homes with extensions and other       
 improvements made.Many of them are    
 still run as small businesses.        
  In the village itself, there are more
 modern,privately_owned houses which   
 were built in the 1960's in the       
 grounds of the Old Auchans Estate.    
 These houses are mostly quite big and 
 have large gardens and lots of mature 
 trees. All the houses have garages and
 lots of them have extra rooms built   
 on.                                   </content>
