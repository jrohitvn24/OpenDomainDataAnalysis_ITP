		<title>19Town or Country Life?</title>
		<content> Twenty four parents and children of   
 Glenisla School were asked three      
 questions concerning their attitudes  
 about whether or not they preferred   
 country or town life giving reasons   
 for their choice and the              
 disadvantages, if any, against their  
 choice. Twenty three people chose the 
 country way of life in preference to  
 living in a town or city.The twenty   
 fourth person thought living in the   
 country to be lonely for adults and   
 children alike and that town life     
 offered more amenities and a wider    
 range of recreational activities.     
 There were no stated disadvantages.   
 The rest found country life to be     
 quieter, more peaceful and things     
 moved at a far more leisurely pace.   
 The environment is much healthier,    
 especially for the children.
