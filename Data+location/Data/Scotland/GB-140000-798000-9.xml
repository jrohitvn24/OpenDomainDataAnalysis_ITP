		<content> A supply of free loan library books   
 are sent to Rhum from Inverness. The  
 adult books go to the library in the  
 shop while the children's books go to 
 the school. These boxes of books are  
 changed every three months or so.     
                                       
 The children are also members of      
 various bookclubs. The children choose
 the books they wish to buy, if any,   
 and the order is sent off by the      
 teacher. These books are sent by post 
 and are distributed by the school.    
                                       
 The school also has a small selection 
 of children's fiction and non_fiction 
 materials which they may borrow at any
 time.
