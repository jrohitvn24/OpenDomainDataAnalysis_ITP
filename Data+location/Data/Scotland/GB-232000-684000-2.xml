		<content> The River Fruin runs through the area.
 Long ago a glacier ran down Glen      
 Fruin, now the river has taken its    
 place.   There are two sand and gravel
 quarries beside the Fruin.   One is at
 Dumfin which is not worked at present.
 The other is at the mouth of the      
 Fruin.  This one is being worked and  
 produces high quality sand which is   
 used for concrete. It employs about 20
 men.   There are many different kinds 
 of stones to be found on the shores of
 Loch Lomond near the mouth of the     
 Fruin.   They are - sandstone, quartz,
 granite, slate, mica schist and       
 conglomerate.   Fishing is a popular  
 pastime in the area.  Salmon and      
 sea trout are caught in Loch Lomond   
 and the Fruin.
