		<title>08Staxigoe Harbour</title>
		<content> Staxigoe was famous for Herring       
 fishing and was the main port of      
 Caithness at one time.                
 It now has about eight small boats    
 which are kept there when they are not
 in use.                               
 They fish for crabs, lobsters, herring
 and mackerel around the coastline of  
 Staxigoe. During stormy weather the   
 boats are taken out of the harbour by 
 their owners so that they don't get   
 damaged.                              
 Builders have started to improve the  
 harbour by making a new road leading  
 down to it, a new slipway and a picnic
 area.                                 
 In the summer Staxigoe harbour is a   
 very popular place for swimming in.   
 Many tourists come to see and take    
 photos of the Stack-rock which is     
 beside the harbour and gave the       
 village its name.                     </content>
