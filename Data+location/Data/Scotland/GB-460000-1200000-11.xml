		<title>11A Uyeasound Grandad.</title>
		<content> My Grandad is a very healthy,lively   
 octogenarian. He is one of the oldest 
 men on Unst. He lives in the Uyeasound
 Sheltered Housing.                    
   He gets up at 8-00 and has a cup of 
 coffee before having a wash and shave.
 At 9-00 he has breakfast. If it is    
 Monday he washes his clothes and works
 in his garden. At 11-00 he prepares   
 and cooks dinner for himself, his son 
 and anyone else working on the farm at
 Clivocast. After lunch he washes the  
 dishes and then spends about an hour  
 at the farm. He returns by 3-00 and   
 rests until 5-00 when he makes and    
 eats tea. He then rests during the    
 evening.                              
   He bakes lots of muffins and salts  
 fish whenever the family come home    
 with a good catch. He is well known as
 an auctioneer at Unst Charity Sales.
