		<title>19CRAMOND :A Local Mum</title>
		<content> We interviewed ten mums to ask their  
 opinions about living in Cramond. The 
 lady June, Paul, Susan and I          
 interviewed on 17 June 1985 was Mrs   
 Aitken. She is the secretary of the   
 Cramond Association. This Association 
 was formed because residents wanted   
 Cramond to be pleasant and tidy and   
 they wanted to organise entertainments
 and to share their hobbies. Mrs Aitken
 has lived in Cramond for about thirty 
 years. She lives with her husband.    
 They have a pet. It is a cat called   
 Tibby. Mrs Aitken thinks that the     
 local shop prices are average. The    
 shops she visits most are the         
 supermarkets at Barnton, East Craigs  
 and Davidsons Mains. She usually      
 travels in her car which is a mini.   
 When she has any spare time she       
 watches TV, reads books and does      
 gardening. She goes to Cramond Kirk.  </content>
