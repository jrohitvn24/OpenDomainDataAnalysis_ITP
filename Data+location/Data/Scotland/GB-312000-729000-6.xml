		<title>06Events_ GUILDTOWN GALA</title>
		<content> A Village Gala was held in the School 
 Playing Field on Saturday, 8th June.  
 It was an long and exciting day out   
 for all the family. From 9am. all was 
 preparation. Men were erecting the    
 marquee for all the stalls, putting   
 the nets up for the Seven_a_side      
 Football, marking out the car park and
 laying out the sports equipment.      
 Everything was coming into shape. At  
 12 noon cars were arriving even       
 although the Gala was not due to start
 till 2pm. Soon there were people      
 everywhere_ buying, selling, watching,
 doing.                                
 Kinrossie won the Football and        
 Guildtown A team won the Mini_sports. 
 Everyone was very tired by the end of 
 the day but were pleased at raising   
 over Â£800 despite the terrible weather
 there had been. The money was shared  
 among all the local participant groups</content>
