  Carrington is practically isolated   
 and it is essential to have a car, but
 if you are unlucky enough not to, this
 could become a problem. The post      
 office runs a 'post bus' service but  
 this is a problem as the bus leaves   
 Carrington at 11.00 am and takes      
 passengers to Gorebridge.They then    
 have one hour to hang around as the   
 bus returns at 1.00 pm.               
  Rosewell has a main bus service      
 running through it and a bus comes    
 every 30 - 35 mins taking passengers  
 to Bonnyrigg,Dalkeith and Edinburgh.  
  The 1981 census illustrates the      
 contrast between local bus services   
 and the need for private cars in the  
 two communities.
