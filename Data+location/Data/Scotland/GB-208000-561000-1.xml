		<content> East of Stramraer from Innermessan to 
 Lochinch.                             
 On the extreme west the sea-coast of  
 Loch Ryan cust slightly into the      
 block.  Moving eastwards the terrain  
 is composed  of rolling fields of     
 arable and grazing land.  The majority
 of the block lies on the isthmus which
 connects the Rhins to the Machars and 
 is only slightly above sea level.     
   In the southeast corner lies Stair  
 Estates with Lochinch Castle situated 
 between the White and Black Lochs.    
 This area is heavily wooded with      
 mainly deciduous trees in contrast to 
 the western area which has few tres.  
 To the extreme east the land rises in 
 hills which are almost covered wih    
 conifer plantations (highest point 193
 metres in square 4).                  
  There are ten farms in the are and a 
 number of cottages roun Lochinch      </content>
