<title>21Glasgow (Calderpark) zoo update</title>
<content>

The lands of Calderpark which straddled both banks of the North Calder Water were purchased on 15 May, 1939 by the Zoological Society of Glasgow. The estate extended, then to about 93 acres which in later years was increased by purchasing waste land to the north of the original property. &lt;br />&lt;br />The zoo was built in the period immediately after the Second World War, 1946-49 using many materials surplus to military requirements and construction was helped by officer cadets.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Uddingston to Glasgow tramline as well as regular bus services from Lanarkshire to Glasgow passed by the front gates of the and British Railways opened a station named Calderpark Halt adjacent to the entrance in 1951 but it had a short life and closed in 1955. It was therefore well served by public transport.&lt;br />&lt;br />The zoo closed in October 2003 through lack of funds and a withdrawal of support from Glasgow city council amidst controversy over a proposed sale of land surplus to requirements. The last Head Keeper was William Linton. &lt;br />&lt;br />As of the period of record - 2011 - the land lies derelict and vandalised.   &lt;br />
