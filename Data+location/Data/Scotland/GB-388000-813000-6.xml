    The A947 through Dyce is a very    
 busy main road.                       
    During a 15 minute survey we       
 counted 93 cars going north and 58    
 cars going south. Also there were 26  
 heavy lorries and a mixture of other  
 vehicles on the road.                 
    This shows that the road is very   
 busy and dangerous. Many people cross 
 it every day - 38 during our 15 minute
 survey.

    The station closed in 1964 due to  
 lack of use. It was re-opened in 1984 
 and has been a big success as a       
 commuter line since then.
