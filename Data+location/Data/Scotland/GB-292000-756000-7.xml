		<content>   Farming is the main primary industry
 with the area divided between large   
 estates with only a few owners.       
   One such is Mr Alistair Ferguson. In
 general the ground is good quality and
 grows crops well, usually potatoes,   
 barley, swedes, rape grass and some   
 soft fruit. A lot of the grass is made
 into winter fodder for the animals:   
 Blackface sheep with some Suffolk-    
 Border Leicester, and Friesian        
 heifers.                              
   Modern farming employs much         
 expensive machinery: Mr Ferguson owns 
 five fairly new tractors, a combine   
 harvester, forage harvester and a New 
 Holland bailer plus various implements
   The area of ground he owns stretches
 from Auchnayle to Killiecrankie, with 
 heights ranging from 2,575 to 350     
 feet. Three shepherds control the     
 flocks which wander the high ground.  </content>
