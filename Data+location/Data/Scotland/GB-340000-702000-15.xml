		<content> Other things that can be seen on the  
 walk through the village include the  
 old railway viaduct, Crusoe hotel, Man
 Friday's cafe. To the west of the     
 hotel lies Kiel's burn which has been 
 used by mills in the past.            
   Access to the shore is obtained by a
 causeway and this leads on to a       
 beautiful sandy beach with substantial
 dune areas.                           
   From here the path passes a         
 beautiful beach play park.There are   
 wartime pillboxes near Lundin Links   
 golf course.Marram grass is again     
 prominent with 5 year old Scotch pine 
 to stabilise the dunes.Beyond the golf
 club house there are further defences 
 against the sea using railway         
 sleepers. From here the trail leads SW
 along the beach to Leven.
