		<content> The Dorran Tarran houses, two         
 dwellings per block, were erected in  
 1949 by the County Council for        
 agricultural workers and have recently
 been modernised and brought up        
 to standard. Through this             
 building in 1949 mains water          
 and drainage were brought to          
 the area.                             
 The only street lighting in the       
 whole of the area is in Imrie         
 Crescent where the above houses are   
 situated.The two roads in this area   
 are unlit and, as there are no        
 pavements along the road sides walking
 can be hazardous, especially in the   
 dark evenings and with the ever       
 increasing amount of traffic.         
 Also in this area are a church, an    
 hotel and historic monuments. {
