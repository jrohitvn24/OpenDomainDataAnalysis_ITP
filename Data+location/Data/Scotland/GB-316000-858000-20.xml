		<content> The 12sq km area allocated,proved to  
 be full of interest which went well   
 beyond the initial expectations.      
 The depth of researching and reporting
 required support from the teaching    
 staff especially for the younger      
 pupils but nevertheless,with limited  
 guidance,all the pupils found the     
 project great fun.                    
 The overall view of both pupils and   
 staff was that the project was very   
 worthwhile,everybody learning in great
 detail about the industries,the       
 trades,the farming methods,distilling 
 and working and living standards of   
 the people in the immediate area of   
 the school.
