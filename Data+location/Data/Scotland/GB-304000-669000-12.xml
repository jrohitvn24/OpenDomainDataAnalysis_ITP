		<title>12AN ORDINARY DAY</title>
		<content>   I wake up at about 8 o'clock, I get 
 dressed and I have my breakfast and   
 then I get ready for school. At around
 8.40 I start to walk to school with my
 sister. I meet my friend and we talk  
 until it is time to line up to go into
 school.                               
   In school we work in groups and my  
 group usually does Maths or Language  
 work first. We also use the computer  
 to help us with some of our work and I
 always enjoy that. In the middle of   
 the morning we have a break and I     
 usually have crisps to eat, I share   
 them with my friend.                  
   After lunch we do various activities
 - P.E.,music, art, project work and   
 sometimes our teacher reads to us. At 
 3.15 we go home and I play football   
 with my friends until tea-time. I play
 with my computer until bed-time and   
 then read until I fall asleep.        </content>
