		<content> There are no churches in our area.    
 Most of the area is in the Parish of  
 Ceres. The church is Chusch of        
 Scotland.                             
 The parish church in Ceres has a      
 Sunday School for local children which
 meets in Craigrothie Village Hall. At 
 present it has 23 children. Children  
 attend from the age of three until    
 they go to Secondary School usually at
 twelve. The Sunday School has 1 leader
 and 2 helpers.                        
 There has been a Sunday School in     
 Craigrothie since 1896. The rental of 
 the Hall is paid from Church Funds and
 the offering given each week by the   
 children goes to the Mission and      
 Services Fund of the Church which     
 sends bibles overseas.
