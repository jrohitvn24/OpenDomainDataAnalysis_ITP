 It is a{nine hole course}over which   
 both friendly and competitive matches 
 are played. Holes are of different    
 lengths and some have bunkers. One    
 hole goes along{the beach}and many    
 golf balls have been lost in the      
 seaweed  or{"swept out to sea."}      
                                       
 The "club house" is a caravan, along- 
 side which is a small hut where the   
 mower, flags and some of the twenty   
 member's clubs are stored.            
 The holes all have local place-names, 
 names of Orkney birds, or have been   
 named after people who helped to      
 establish the club in 1977 _ here are 
 the names:-{Newark Ho; The Warren;    
{Cooquoy Brae; Green's Fancy; Whaup's
