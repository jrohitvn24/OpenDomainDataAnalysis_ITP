		<content> The{largest group}regarding population
 movement in Banchory-Devenick is the  
 people who have{come into the area}in 
 recent years. The{smallest group}is   
 made up of{those who go out}of the    
 communtiy. The reason why people move 
 in is because mostly they, or their   
 husband, work in the Oil Business or  
 some{oil-related industry.            
  Because Banchory-Devenick is near the
 city of Aberdeen many people can      
 easily drive to work and enjoy city   
 life while having the peace of the    
 country at home.                      
  In the old days people left to look  
 for work elsewhere. Now the in-comers 
 leave if they are transferred, but    
 many people settle here.
